England were on Friday placed on a World Cup semi-final collision course with the holders Brazil (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

If England win Group B and the team of Ronaldinho and Adriano claim the high ground of Group F, they will share the same half of the draw and, if they both successfully negotiate subsequent knock-out ties, will meet in Munich on July 5 for a place in the final. 

England must first negotiate their way past South Americas fourth-placed nation, Paraguay, in Frankfurt on June 10, in Nuremberg on June 15 and finishing against Sven-Goran Erikssons native Sweden in Cologne June 20. 

Some might feel England would be better served finishing as runner-up to remove them from Brazils side of the draw. 

If England are to lift the World Cup for the second time in their history, they will have to do it the hard way, overcoming the team of all the talents on the autobahn to the July 9 climax in Berlin. 

Memories will flood back of Englands quarter final defeat to Brazil at the 2002 World Cup, where Ronaldinhos free-kick sent David Seaman into tears and Sven-Goran Erikssons side out of the tournament. 

Eriksson knows the sort of gifted players who stand between his team and the World Cup. Ronaldinho is the best in the world, said the Swede. If you give him space, he will kill you. You have to pay him a lot of attention. 

Watching events here in the birthplace of Richard Wagner, the creator of Gotterdamerung, Eriksson understood the situations demands. When you go to the World Cup, the pressure is on from the moment you get there, he reflected. Football is never in the middle ground. You are either the best or the worst. 

During the ceremony the World Cup ball was unveiled, followed by a televised endorsement from David Beckham who praised it for going in the right direction, which is encouraging. 

The World Cup trophy was handed over by the Brazilian holders to the German hosts, having spent a short spell being cleaned in Milan. 

The Brazilians sprinkled Caiprinhia on it, Fifas president, Sepp Blatter, smiled, mentioning the giggle juice of choice of the boys and girls from Ipanema. 

In a rare serious note during proceedings, which included footage of cows playing a match on a sloping white-lined field (with nets), Blatter said he hoped the tournament would prove a platform for promoting peace. The world is crazy, aggressive, he said. Let the positives of football be carried into the world to make it a better place. 

Now that Englands itinerary is known in what looks like a straightforward draw, Eriksson called on the teams followers to conduct themselves as they criss-cross Germany. 

We have shown great improvement in fan behaviour but I would urge our supporters to stop chanting the song about 10 German bombers, he said. 

This is clearly very disrespectful and it is important that we respect our German hosts. If we can live without having those chants, just their support, it would be perfect. 

It is important that our fans show the great behaviour they have done in the last two tournaments. They were voted the best fans in Japan and Korea and also in Portugal, not only in numbers but also the colour they brought to the tournament and their behaviour. Its really important they continue that in Germany. 

Englands players are to record pleas to supporters to desist their chanting about Two World Wars, One World Cup and the Bombers anthem. The Football Association (FA) are also to avoid showing advertisements for the RAF, as appeared during the friendly with Argentina. 

Eriksson will meet his coaching staff in Manchester to analyse further, and talks may touch on whether to deploy Steven Gerrard as his holding player, a role the coach wishes to use against more creative opponents in Germany. Gerrard is not keen to do it, Eriksson said. 

He has too much energy at the moment but in the future he will be a fantastic sitting midfielder. Against Argentina (in last months friendly) he was outside-left, central and then at right-back, where he put in the cross for Michael Owen. He can play everywhere, absolutely. 

Ledley King can do it. Hes showed it many times. Against Argentina it was not easy because they are technically very difficult but he did well and can do it. 

Eriksson will be keeping experimentation to a minimum in the three remaining friendlies, and will not be shifting from a back four. 

 We dont have enough time to practice a 

 back three before the World Cup, he said. Its 

 too late to try something complicated now. Last nights 

 draw has certainly focused Englands minds.

 Hari held by Ukraine GM

Dos Hermanas: World junior champion P. Harikrishna survived some anxious moments before drawing with world?s youngest ever Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine in the sixth round of the category-16 Dos Hermanas International chess tournament here. 

The hard-earned draw helped Harikrishna retain his joint fifth spot in the overall standings in this round-robin tournament that carries the winner?s purse of Euros 6000. 

However, little changed at the top as draws ruled the roost in the sixth round and Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan maintained his slender half point lead over nearest rivals Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia, Ruben Felgaer of Argentina and Karjakin who all have 3.5 points in their kitty. 

Harikrishna is next in line along with defending champion Alexander Rustemov of Russia on three points. (PTI)

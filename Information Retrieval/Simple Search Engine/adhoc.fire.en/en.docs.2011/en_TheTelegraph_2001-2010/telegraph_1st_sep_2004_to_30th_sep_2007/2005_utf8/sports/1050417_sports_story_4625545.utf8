 The board strikes back

 Kasparov feels the attack was politically motivated 

Moscow: Garri Kasparov, the world?s former No. 1 chess player who quit the professional game last month to focus on politics, said Saturday that he had been hit on the head with a chessboard in what appears to have been a politically motivated attack. 

Kasparov was not injured Friday when he was hit with the chessboard after signing it for a young man at an event in Moscow. Marina Litvinovich, a spokeswoman for Kasparov, said the assailant told the chess champion: ?I admired you as a chess player, but you gave that up for politics.? 

She said the unidentified attacker ? who did not reveal his political allegiance ? had tried to hit Kasparov a second time but was hauled away by security guards. 

?It was a fairly nasty incident, it was not very pleasant psychologically,? Kasparov told the private NTV television. ?Yesterday, I was just about able to muster up enough humour to joke darkly that, luckily in the Soviet Union, chess and not baseball was popular.? 

The 41-year-old Kasparov, a brilliant and aggressive tactician regarded by many as the greatest chess player of all time, has been ranked No. 1 in the world since 1984. 

But the outspoken critic of president Vladimir Putin retired last month, saying at the time that he planned to focus on politics and do ?everything in my power to resist Putin?s dictatorship.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?India start favourites?

A STAFF REPORTER

 Steve finds Pathan ?most promising? 

Calcutta: Pakistan?s ?unlimited potential? notwithstanding, India start favourites in the forthcoming home series, feels Steve Waugh. 

?In the recent series Down Under, Pakistan have failed to sustain the momentum and succumbed under pressure. They need to harness their talent properly to harbour hopes in the series against India. 

?They played well in Australia in patches, but did not prove very competitive in the long run. If they are consistent, they will do well in India. 

?India will definitely start favourites. They are a very good team? They have good young bowlers and also possess a strong batting line-up,? Steve said on Thursday. 

The former Australian captain singled out Irfan Pathan for special mention, terming him as ?most promising?. 

Describing Shoaib Akhtar as a ?top-bracket fast bowler?, Steve said the controversies surrounding him were internal matters of the side, and hoped all will be sorted out in time. ?It?s the coach?s job to get all going. Bob (Woolmer) is a strong coach and can handle matters on discipline.? 

This year?s Ashes, Steve believes, will pose a new challenge for the Australians. ?England are well led, their body language positive, they?ve played with purpose so far, they?re enjoying the game and there is a togetherness in the side.? 

Steve picked Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff for special mention and felt they have played a big role in the turnaround in England?s fortunes. 

?Australia will find the New Zealand tour coming up before the Ashes pretty tough. The wickets and conditions will suit New Zealand and Australians will have to fight it out.? 

Steve said it was up to Glenn McGrath to decide whether he could carry on till the 2007 World Cup. ?In cricket, two years is a long time away. Only McGrath can decide on this. The Australians are a very good side, there?s a lot of depth.? 

He also lauded Michael Kasprowicz?s efforts. ?His success reveals his character and desire to excel. He is an excellent teammate, the unsung hero in the team. ? 

Steve also welcomed the new ICC ruling on illegal bowling actions. ?Previously, the decision on whether a bowler was chucking depended on personal judgement. Different Match Referees and umpires saw it differently. This in turn led to a lot of confusion. 

?One may still have his own viewpoint on what constitutes chucking, but now at least people know clearly what the rule is. Anything below 15 degrees is legal and above 15 is illegal.?

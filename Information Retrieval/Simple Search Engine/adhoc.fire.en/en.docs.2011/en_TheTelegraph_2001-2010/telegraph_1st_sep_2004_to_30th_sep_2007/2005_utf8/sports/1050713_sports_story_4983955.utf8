The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

We appear to be going backwards

- I wish I could promise fans a better show at my home race: Michael Schumacher 

KEVIN EASON 

 Schumacher doesnt want to offer any 

excuses 

It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that 

reverse is the wrong gear in which to attempt to win in Formula One, so it is 

little surprise that a disgruntled Michael Schumacher left Silverstone for his 

castle in Switzerland, where he will be ruminating on a British Grand Prix that 

was little more than an embarrassment for a man who once made a habit of winning.

He knows that he will soon be handing over the world 

championship title that has been his for the past five years and seven times in 

all. Retaining the title, he said, is little more than a distant, distant 

hope. He has only one victory to his name this season and that came at the 

United States Grand Prix ? the one in which only three teams raced. So not much 

of an achievement there, then.

But it was a win and a rare moment of triumph, as 

well as a complete contrast to his brutal assessment of the Ferrari he drove at 

Silverstone on Sunday. As he surveyed the wreckage of a race in which he finished 

sixth, he said that he never came within shouting distance of Juan Pablo Montoya, 

the winner, or Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen, the top two in the world championship 

standings after 11 races of a long season. Or even Jenson Button, who might have 

been an unhappy fifth but comfortably outstripped the Ferraris.

Schumacher could have attempted a few excuses, particularly 

after being held up behind the Toyota of Jarno Trulli in the first stint of Sundays 

race, but there was little point. Clearly, we are simply not fast enough 

at the moment, the German said.

If I had not been delayed by Trulli, I might 

have been able to fight with Button, but I am not keen on using the word if 

as an excuse. If you compare our performance from the two North American races 

to the last two, we appear to be going backwards instead of forwards.

We are just not on the pace of our main competitors 

at Renault, McLaren or BAR. I am now looking forward to my home race (the German 

Grand Prix) in Hockenheim (on July 24) and I wish I could promise the fans there 

a bit more than this. 

But I am not sure I can.

Who takes over from Schumacher and gives Formula One 

its first new champion since 1999 only makes the season more intriguing. Montoya 

refuses to rule himself out, but the sensible money is on a confrontation between 

Raikkonen, his McLaren Mercedes teammate, and Alonso, of Renault. 

The Spaniard leads by 26 points, but only a run of 

appalling luck, exemplified by a blown engine in practice at Silverstone, has 

robbed Raikkonen of a sequence of wins that would have put him in the leading 

position.

His performances are so strong that Martin Whitmarsh, 

the McLaren chief executive, has said that his two drivers could carve up the 

remaining eight races this season between them, and that from a man not given 

to idle boasts.

We could have won the last eight races and we 

can win every remaining race, he said. Both of our drivers can, unquestionably 

at the moment, beat Alonso and if we do that and we have good reliability and 

Renault make a slip or two, then were in there to win.

Refreshingly, there is no question of team orders 

in the McLaren camp and Raikkonen and Montoya will be free to race each other, 

a mouth-watering prospect, particularly when Alonso enters the equation. They 

have a tremendous amount of respect for one another but they want to beat the 

hell out of each other, Whitmarsh said. Kimi knows hes got to 

win, so he will be absolutely fired up to go over and win the next race.

A sunny Silverstone was a pleasant change from the 

rancour that has surrounded Formula One and there is a chance of peace breaking 

out. Representatives of the seven teams found guilty of effectively bringing the 

sport into disrepute over the debacle of the US Grand Prix will meet Max Mosley 

to seek a resolution. It is part of a round of peacemaking visits, with the 25 

Formula One drivers also invited to attend a meeting with Mosley next month to 

discuss their concerns.

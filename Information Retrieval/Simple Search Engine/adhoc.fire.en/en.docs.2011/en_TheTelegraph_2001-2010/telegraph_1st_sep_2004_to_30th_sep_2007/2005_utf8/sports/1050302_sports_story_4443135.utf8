 Mahmud joins protest

Dhaka: Former Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud was among protesters who staged a token seven-hour hunger strike on Tuesday against a government decision to change the venue for Test and one-day Internationals. 

Over 50 people, including former officials of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, club officials and players, squatted at one of the entrance of Bangabandhu National Stadium to take part in the hunger strike. 

The Bangabandhu National Stadium has been the venue for 17 Tests and 58 one-dayers since 1955, but Bangladesh will now play at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur, 10km away. 

Last week, several hundred fans staged a noisy demonstration in the capital against the decision. The board has, however, said that the new stadium will be beneficial to the game.

 Bopanna for Mankad 

New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna was rewarded for his successful return from a long injury lay-off with a place in the Indian Davis Cup team for the crucial World Group play-off tie against Sweden to be held here from September 23 to 25. 

Making way for Bopanna was Harsh Mankad who has been named the reserve player in the team comprising Leander Paes (captain), Mahesh Bhupathi and Prakash Amritraj. 

All India Tennis Association (AITA) secretary Anil Khanna said the selection committee finalised the team late Thursday night after a discussion with captain Paes, currently playing in the US Open Grand Slam. The committee, however, has conveyed to the captain that it was his prerogative to name the team, Khanna added.

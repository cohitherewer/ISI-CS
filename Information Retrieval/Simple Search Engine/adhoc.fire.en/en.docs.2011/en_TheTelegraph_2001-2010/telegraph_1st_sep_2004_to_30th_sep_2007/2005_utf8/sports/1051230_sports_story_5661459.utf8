Calcutta: Overnight joint leader Bitan Banerjee lifted The Telegraph Schools Chess championship title with a score of nine points out of a possible 11 at the Alekhine Chess Club in Gorky Sadan on Thursday. 

Bitan, a class VII student of Baruipur High School, also became the youngest player to win the premier school chess meet after it was recognised by Fide eight years back. 

The 11-round Swiss league tournament was presented by Linc and co-sponsored by Bata. 

It was a tough battle for the top-slot, as three players ?? Bitan, Debaditya Sinha Biswas and Kaushalendra Kumar ?? were in contention for the top honours. All of them drew, but Bitan, a student of the Goodricke National Chess Academy, was declared champion while Debaditya came second on account of better progressive scores. Kaushalendra Kumar of Bihar had to be content with third spot. 

Bitan received The Telegraph School Trophy and a cash prize of Rs 15000 from chief guest Lakshman Singh, a former Asian Games double gold medallist in golf. 

Speaking on the occasion, Singh said: I am happy that over the years this tournament has become the breeding ground of best players. 

Playing on the top board with black, Bitan opted for his favourite Najdorf Sicilian against Kaushalendra Kumar, but could make little headway. Unwilling to take further risks he called it a day. Debaditya, seeing Bitan held, on the second board, tried to win desperately against Soumya Thakurta. But Soumya thwarted all his attempts by defending well and forced a draw in 43 moves. Avi Bagdi of Madhya Pradesh, who drew with Suman Basu, was placed fourth with 8.5 points. In a queens pawn opening, Bagdi offered to split point on the 16th move, which the latter accepted quickly. 

The surprise package of the meet turned out to be the nine-year-old Chandrasish Majumder, a class IV student of St Xaviers who finished with eight points and was placed 15th. 

Also present were Deepak Jalan (MD, Linc Pens amp; Plastic Ltd), Yu N. Zozulya (director, Gorky Sadan), Asoke Ghosh (life president, Alekhine Chess Club), K.S. Bagchi (president, Alekhine Chess Club) and D.D. Purkayastha (executive director, ABP Pvt Ltd). 

St. James School, represented by Soumya Thakurta (8.5), Abhratanu Dutta (8.5), Nilabhro Datta (7.5), and Saurav Chakraborty (7) was declared the best school with 31.5 points for the fifth consecutive time. 

Students of Louis Braille Memorial School for the Sightless, Uttarpara ? Ganesh Kisku (7), Sambhu Murmu (7), Ajhar Alam (6) and Sudip Rajbanshi (5) ? were awarded special prizes.

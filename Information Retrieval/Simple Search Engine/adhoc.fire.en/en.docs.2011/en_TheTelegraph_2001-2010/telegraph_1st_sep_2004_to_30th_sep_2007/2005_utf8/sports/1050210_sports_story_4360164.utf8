 Dempo loss takes East Bengal to top

Margao: Federation Cup champions Dempo suffered their first defeat as they went down 0-1 to debutant Fransa in the seventh round of the ninth National Football League here on Wednesday. 

The result took East Bengal (14 points) atop the standings. Dempo have 13 from as many matches (7). 

The winning goal came in the 69th minute when Sebastiao Endro back headed a lob by defender Cersson Antaos to beat the advancing Dempo custodian Satish Kumar. It was not Dempo?s day on this day with the woodwork twice stalling their attempt to go into the lead before the breather. Dempo even wasted a penalty in the second half when Fransa keeper Kalyan Chaubey, who was declared the Man of the Match, dived to his left to thwart Ranty Martins attempt from the spot. 

The penalty was awarded by Subrata Sarkar when A.S. Feroze brought down R.C. Prakash inside the box. (PTI)

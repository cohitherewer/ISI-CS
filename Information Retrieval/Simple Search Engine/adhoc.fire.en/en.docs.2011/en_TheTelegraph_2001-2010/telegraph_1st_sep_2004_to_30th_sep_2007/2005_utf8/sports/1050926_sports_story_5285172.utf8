 Narain 17th in qualifying

Sao Paulo: Narain Kartikeyan finished seventeenth, four places behind his Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro, while Spaniard Fernando Alonso bagged the pole position for Sundays Brazilian Grand Prix after final qualifying on Saturdy. Karthikeyan finished a trouble-free qualifying lap in 1:14.520 minutes. 

Alonso improved his chances of a podium finish that would make him formula ones youngest champion by completing in 1.11.988 minutes. Kimi Raikkonen, winner of three of the past four races, finished fifth. 

I consider the whole day as positive. I completed nine laps in the morning in the first session. Then I completed eight laps during the fourth practice session. I clocked a fantastic quick time of 1.13.242 that brought me to fifth fastest time first until the classification stabilised in 14th position at the end of the session, Karthikeyan said. 

But this placed us very close to the front runners, Schumacher, Barrichello or Montoya. This afternoon for qualifying, following my good result at the Belgian GP two weeks ago, I had the advantage to leave for my qualifying lap as the track was cleaner. We are on different set-up and different strategy for the race. I am satisfied with the day and the balance of my car and I am confident on the tyre choice, the Indian said. 

Monteiro, the second Jordan man, finished 13th with a time of 1.13.387 minutes. 

After a perfect lap on Michelin tyres, Alonso, 24, bagged the pole position for the eighth pole time in his career. 

McLarens Raikkonen the last of the drivers to leave for qualifying on an improved track, blocked one wheel in the first sector and lost enough time that he was only fifth with a difference of 0.793s to the pole man. 

Raikkonen, Alonsos contender made a drivers mistake missing the braking on the first corner. This mistake costs him 0.793s of difference against Alonso and he only scored fifth quickest of the session.

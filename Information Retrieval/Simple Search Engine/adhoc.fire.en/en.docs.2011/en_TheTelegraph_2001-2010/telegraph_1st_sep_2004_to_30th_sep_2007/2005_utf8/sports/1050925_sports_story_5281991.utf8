 Chowrasia claims title

Chennai: Calcuttas S.P. Chowrasia claimed the glittering Hindu Open Trophy two strokes ahead of defending champion Ashok Kumar in the third leg of the Amby Valley PGA Indian Golf Tour here on Saturday. 

Ashok Kumar, who was tied with Chowrasia for the honours on Friday, has only himself to blame as his wayward tee shot resulted in a disappointing day. Chowrasia capitalised with a birdie to lead by one stroke when Ashok Kumar bogeyed the short par-3 fourth hole. (PTI)

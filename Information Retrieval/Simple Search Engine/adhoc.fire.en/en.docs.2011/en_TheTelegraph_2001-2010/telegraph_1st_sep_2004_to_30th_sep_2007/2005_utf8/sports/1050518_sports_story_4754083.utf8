 Lara rested for ODIs

 - SERIES vs PAKISTAN 

 Lara needed a rest, feels chief selector Carew 

London: Brian Lara is being rested for West Indies three one-day Internationals against Pakistan this month so that he is ready to face them in the two-Test series. 

The selectors left the batsman out of West Indies 13-man squad for the three one-dayers in St Vincent and the Grenadines on May 18 and in Saint Lucia on May 21 and 22. 

Head of selectors Michael Joey Carew said they needed to rest Lara before the Tests against Pakistan starting later this month and thought the one-day series was the correct time. 

His absence puts a lot of additional responsibility on the team and we look forward to them taking up this challenge, Carew said in a statement. 

As we had stated earlier we would be trying different combinations and we have brought back Wavell Hinds and Pedro Collins, he added. 

West Indies are reeling under the shock of losing 0-5 at the hands of South Africa in the recently-concluded one-day series, making them the first West Indies side to be whitewashed in a home one-day rubber. 

We have to put the South Africa series behind us and take what we learnt from it into the matches against the Pakistanis and I look forward to some measure of success in this series, added Carew. 

The first Test is scheduled for May 26-30 in Barbados with the second test from June 3-7 in Jamaica. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan manager Salim Altaf believes the West Indies were still dangerous, even after South Africa completed an unbeaten Caribbean tour at the weekend. 

The West Indies are an unpredictable side, Altaf said on Monday. Just to say they have been beaten by South Africa, quite frankly that doesnt mean anything to us. 

Pakistan faces the West Indies in the first of three one-day Internationals on Wednesday in St Vincent, followed by Tests in Barbados and Jamaica. They have never won a series on West Indies soil. 

West Indies lost the last limited-overs match on Sunday to South Africa, who won the ODIs 5-0, and the four-match Test series 2-0. It was the first time the West Indies failed to win a home ODI. 

But Altaf said Pakistan respected the abilities of the home players, especially Ramnaresh Sarwan, captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Chris Gayle. 

Each (one-day International) has to be played as a separate entity, Altaf said. We are fully aware of (their) capabilities. 

THE WINDIES SQUAD 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul (captain), Christopher Gayle, Xavier Marshall, Runako Morton, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Wavell Hinds, Dwayne Smith, Dwayne Bravo, Courtney Browne, Corey Collymore, Daren Powell, Pedro Collins, Ian Bradshaw.

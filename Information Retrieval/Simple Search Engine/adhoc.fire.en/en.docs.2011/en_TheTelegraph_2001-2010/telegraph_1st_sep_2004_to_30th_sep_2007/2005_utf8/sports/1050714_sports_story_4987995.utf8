 Haris winning streak continues

Taiyuan: World junior champion P. Harikrishnas top form continued as he out-manoeuvred GM Zhang Zhong of China in the fourth round of the Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters chess tournament here. 

With his fourth win on the trot, Harikrishna continued to lead the table with four points. Following him a half point behind is GM Tigran Petrosian of Armenia, who scored his third win of the meet, accounting for English GM Luke McShane. 

Former Russian champion Alexander Motylev and Chinese duo of Wang Yue and Bu Xiangzhi are next with 2.5 points apiece, but holding the edge here is the Russian as he still has a game in hand against Chinese GM Ni Hua that will be played on the rest day. 

With seven rounds to go in the category-15 round robin event, Wang Hao of China is sixth with two points. He is followed by McShane and Ukrainian GM Sergey Karjakin. 

The opening featured the Leningrad Dutch where Zhong played black. Steadily Harikrishna got a slight advantage in the middle game. 

As the game progressed, it was evident that black had some counterplay and Zhong found some solace after losing a pawn that led to a seemingly drawish endgame with regular exchange of pieces. 

Harikrishna then obtained a central passed pawn and slowly increased his advantage by marching the king in to heart of blacks position. The marathon ended after 109 moves, the highest in the tournament. 

For Petrosian too, it was a very satisfying day with McShane falling to some deft planning in 59 moves. 

For the second day running, Motylev recorded a smooth victory in a king and pawn endgame. On the receiving end was former world junior girls champion Zhao Xue of China, who lost in just 37 moves. 

In other games of the day, Wang Yue defeated Wang Hao, while Karjakin, the worlds youngest-ever GM, registered his first victory of the meet, beating Ni Hua of China. 

The lone draw of the day was between Chinese Bu Xiangzhi and Zhang Pengxiang.

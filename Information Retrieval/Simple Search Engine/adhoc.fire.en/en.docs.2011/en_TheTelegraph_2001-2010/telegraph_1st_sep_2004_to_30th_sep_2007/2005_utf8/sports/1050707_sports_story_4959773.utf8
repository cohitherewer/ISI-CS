 Ill never coach a foreign team: Kapil 

 Kapil 

Bangalore: Former India captain Kapil Dev says he will never accept an offer to coach a foreign team and if ever he wants to do that job, it will only be for his home country. 

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a press meet to announce the induction of former India sprinter Ashwini Nachappa as a member of the Hero Indian Sports Academy, the legendary allrounder said he had never ever aspired to coach a foreign team. If I ever want to do (coaching), I will only do it for my country, Kapil said. 

On Sourav Gangulys poor run with the bat, he said the Indian captain should be given some more time to deliver. 

Asked about the new ICC rules regarding one-day Internationals, he said if those were aimed at making the game more enjoyable and spectator-friendly, then it was a welcome move. However, Kapil cautioned against going in for too many experiments, saying these could kill the game. (PTI)

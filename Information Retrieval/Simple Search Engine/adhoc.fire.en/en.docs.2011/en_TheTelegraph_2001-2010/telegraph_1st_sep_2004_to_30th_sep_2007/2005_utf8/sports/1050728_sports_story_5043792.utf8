Karunagela: Touring Indian cricketers sought to get into the groove ahead of the tri-series as they spanked a local outfit by 93 runs with nearly 14 overs to spare. 

There were some hiccups for the Indians though in the match against Karunagela XI. After finding themselves in dire straits, they were rescued the blade of young Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who made 88 and but for whom even a score of 250 with 50 extras from 42-odd overs would not have been possible. 

The locals in reply were all out for 157 with Irfan Pathan picking up three for 20. Ashish Nehra, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh claimed two scalps each. 

The Indians dozed, sang and came utterly bored to the venue after nearly two hours of drive from their hotel in Dambulla and their spirits dampened further when they found a wet outfield and an overcast sky. Match began nearly an hour late as Indians chose to take first strike. 

VVS Laxman was rested so it gave Dhoni a chance to stake his claim for the openers berth with Virender Sehwag. Runs came in torrents and it was already 50 plus on the board in the fifth over. 

Then wickets fell and the innings was completely transformed. Sehwag was bowled by first change mediumpacer Udara Waruna and Yuvraj Singh, promoted to No. 3, found a sluggish pitch and local mediumpacers too much to get past the square. After he had managed a couple of boundaries through the off-side, he cut left-arm mediumpacer Tilina Thushara straight into third mans hands. 

The middle-order caved in without much fight as spinners took centrestage. Captain Rahul Dravid fell leg-before to the left-arm spin of Ajith Ekanayake and Mohammed Kaif edged a catch behind of off-spinner Mohammed Suraj. 

Young guns ? Suresh Raina (29) and Yalaka Venugopal Rao (13) ? steadied the ship for a while before the final four wickets fell for the addition of only 23 runs. 

India were all out for 250 in the 43rd over against the non-descript side and things would have been far worse had Dhoni (88) and extras (50) not contributed their bit. Dhoni made his 88 runs from 97 balls with six fours and two sixes. 

The Indian batsmen were completely stifled in the middle overs by the spinning trio of Ekanaake, Suraj Mohammad and Jehan Mubarak who conceded only 79 in 24 overs between them. 

Irfan Pathan struck twice in his first spell but was running in gingerly rather than steaming in at the batsmen. Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra experimented a lot which allowed the locals to reach 103 in only the 23rd over of the innings. Nehra was once hit disdainfully over midwicket for a six by Mubarak. 

The local team had four internationals in their ranks. While Jehan Mubarak, Lanka de Silva and Tilina Thushara have represented them in Tests, Tilina Kandambi turned up in a few one-dayers. 

 Chappell unfazed 

Coach Greg Chappell shrugged Indias indifferent performance as one of those things and also made light of couple of injuries currently dogging Indian cricketers. 

I am not worried about these performances. Obviously you would like to do better all the time but what would matter to me is how this side performs in the tri-series, said Chappell. 

There also appeared to be some injury issues concerning Dhoni and VVS Laxman. 

Dhoni is suffering from a slight niggle while Laxman had a back problem which has been accentuated by muscle strain in the thigh, said Chappell. 

However, the coach said these were minor niggles. 

Asked if he thought it would be as much a contest between India, Sri Lanka and the West Indies as between the three Australian coaches in him, Tom Moody and Bennett King, Chappell replied. It is not a contest between us but between the teams who will fight it out in the park. Obviously we are known to each other and we are new to our jobs so thats where the similarity begins and ends, he said. 

Chappell confessed that his team had prepared in detail against Sri Lanka but there was not much information he had about the West Indies. Obviously, Sri Lankan team is well known and India has played against them often so we are aware of their capability. As for West Indies, they are a new unit and we suffer lack of knowledge in that area. 

Brief Scores ? India 250 in 42.2 ovs (MS Dhoni 88, S. Raina 29, Dilan Krunakare 3/47). Karunagela XI 157 in 36.2 ovs (Irfan Pathan 3/20, Ashish Nehra 2/36, Virender Sehwag 2/18, Yuvraj Singh 2/2). India won by 93 runs.

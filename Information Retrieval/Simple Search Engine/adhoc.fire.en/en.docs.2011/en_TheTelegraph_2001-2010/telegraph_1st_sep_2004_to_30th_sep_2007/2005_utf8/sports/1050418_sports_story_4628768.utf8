The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan hope to turn tide

 Caution is Dutta?s mantra versus Vasco 

Margao: With the threat of relegation looming large, former champions Mohun Bagan will be hoping to garner full points when they take on bottom-placed Vasco in the 18th round of the National Football League for ONGC Cup the at Nehru Stadium on Monday. 

Mohun Bagan, placed eighth with 17 points from as many matches, will hope for a win Monday so as to change the course of their relegation threat and also avenge their first leg defeat. 

With two defeats and two draws under his belt, new coach Amal Dutta has no option but to play a safe game and not lose further points before their crunch match against the arch-rivals East Bengal on Sunday. 

Dutta admitted that he can?t afford to go all out to fetch victory as they are left with only one striker in Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? with Ashim Biswas and Sunil Chhetri injured. Defender Mani Tombi Singh has been ruled out due to injury he suffered against Sporting Clube de Goa, and he will be replaced by Dulal Biswas. 

?My first priority is to play a safe game as we do not want to lose further as it will push us to the brink of relegation. We will adopt a defensive game and attack on the counter. If we win we will welcome it as a bonus point,? Dutta stated. (PTI)

 Mosley cancels meet with drivers

 - David Coulthard remark irks FIA boss 

London: Max Mosley, the head of Formula Ones governing body, has cancelled a meeting with drivers at Silverstone on Friday because of comments made by Briton David Coulthard. 

In a letter to the Scot obtained by Reuters, Mosley regretted that Coulthard had used the prospect of this meeting as a reason to air your personal views on current regulations to the press. 

Your press comments have distorted the purpose of the Silverstone meeting and made a calm discussion of a major safety issue impossible. As a result the meeting will not now take place. 

Mosley had been due to meet all drivers belonging to the Grand Prix Drivers Association (GPDA) at the British Grand Prix. He said he would now invite them to a meeting in Monaco or Paris at a mutually convenient date. 

The Silverstone meeting was to have discussed safety measures at test sessions while also giving the drivers a chance to air concerns following the US Grand Prix tyre fiasco at Indianapolis last month. 

British newspapers quoted the Scot on Tuesday as condemning rules introduced by the FIA in recent years such as single-lap qualifying and 10-place penalties on the starting grid for unscheduled engine changes. 

Coulthard, who drives for Red Bull, is a GPDA director. Tuesday, Coulthard received a years extension on his contract with Red Bull next season, the Formula One team said. A team spokeswoman said the Scot had signed an extension for 2006. 

Red Bull will have Ferrari engines next season.

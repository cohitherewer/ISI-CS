Calcutta: Bengal captain Devang Gandhi scored an unbeaten 131 to steer Bengal to a huge eight-wicket victory over Tripura in the national one-dayer (East Zone) match at the Eden on Thursday. 

The victory helped the hosts collect five points (including a bonus). 

Put into bat, Tripura posted a competitive 242 in the allotted 50 overs. Number four batsman Manoj Singh hit a brilliant unbeaten 106, while captain Tariq-ur Rehman (59) and R. Prasanna (42) contributed handsomely. 

The hosts, in reply, achieved the target losing two wickets, that of openers Subhomoy Das and Arindam Das. For Devang, this was his ninth one-day century in the meet. The last time he scored a ton was against Assam in the previous season. 

With the wicket having little to offer, Bengal bowlers were made to toil. Except Ranadeb Bose, who used the windy morning conditions pretty well. The lanky medium pacer took three for 58. 

Ranadeb struck in his second over when he dislodged R.C. Shanbal?s off stump with a sharp in-cutter. He again struck in the eighth over when he forced Ansul Lamba to give a simply edge to wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta. 

Sanjib Sanyal, who was the most economical bowler, reduced Tripura to 78 for three, when he had R. Prasanna caught by Arindam. With three down, in came Manoj, and together with his captain Rehman, steadied the Tripura innings. Manoj?s 106 came off 161 deliveries with 10 boundaries. Rehman?s knock of 59 came from 93 balls that included three boundaries. 

Chasing 243 to win, the hosts were in early trouble after they lost Subhomoy Das? wicket in the fourth over. He edged Timir Chanda to wicketkeeper R. Shanbal, whose half-hearted appeal was upheld by umpire B. Ravi. It looked a doubtful decision. 

Devang joined Arindam in the middle. The captain was at his best and remained unbeaten on 131 from 151 deliveries with four sixes and 10 hits to the fence. He shared a 154-run second wicket partnership with Arindam, who scored 78. The opener perished when he tried to hit Lamba over mid-wicket and was caught by R. Prasanna. 

Former captain Rohan Gavaskar chipped in with 24. The winning runs were fittingly scored by Devang, when he lifted C. Sachdev for a six. 

Bengal have seven points while Tripura have one from two outings.

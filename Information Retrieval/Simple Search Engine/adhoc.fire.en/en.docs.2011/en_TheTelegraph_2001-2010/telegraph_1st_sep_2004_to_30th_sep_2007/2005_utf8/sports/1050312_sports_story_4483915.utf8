 Seis Corona for main event 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Caprese, Fort Knox and Seis Corona are the three horses who stand out in a field of six vying for the 1,400m Karnataka Trophy here on Saturday. The first two are winners over the shorter sprints, and in impressive manner too. Seis Corona, on the other hand, was not so lucky but placed twice behind a highly-rated Galloping Bay over the slated distance. The N. Ponnappa-ward, with Appu in the saddle, therefore, holds the edge.

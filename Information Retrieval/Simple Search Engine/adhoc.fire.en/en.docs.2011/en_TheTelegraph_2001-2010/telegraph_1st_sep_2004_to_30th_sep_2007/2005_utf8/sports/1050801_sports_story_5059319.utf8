The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Raina not short on confidence; Venugopal 

 banks on self-belief

 - A Telegraph exclusive - Gifted Indian newcomers open up 

 in Dambulla 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dambulla: At 18, Suresh 

 Raina is Team Indias baby face. Yalaka 

 Venugopal Rao, too, is young (23). Both spoke to The Telegraph 

 on Friday evening and, briefly, on Sunday ? the morning 

 after getting their maiden cap.

 The following are excerpts

 On their background

 Raina: Im the youngest among 

 four brothers and a sister... The family stays in Muradnagar 

 (near Ghaziabad), but our roots are in Pathankot. Of course, 

 Ive been in Lucknow from 1999... Im doing honours 

 in economics.

 Venugopal: I come from a middle-class 

 family in Vizag... My father (Matcheshwara) was with Hindustan 

 Zinc, but took VRS two years ago... Were five brothers 

 and Im No. 4... To pursue cricket, I shifted to Chennai 

 five years ago... I did my graduation from there as well. 

 I play for Indian Overseas Bank, though Im not on 

 their rolls.

 On missing 

 home

 Raina: (Laughs) Baat 

 hoti rahte hai...

 Venugopal: One way of not feeling 

 that way is regularly talking with those at home.

 On their idol

 Raina: Rahul Dravid... I admire 

 the way he concentrates... Unko dekhne se bahut accha 

 lagta hai... Now, hes my first India captain.

 Venugopal: Sachin Tendulkar... 

 I would bunk school to watch him on the TV... I was speechless 

 when I met him for the time, at the MRF Academy, before 

 the 1999-00 season.

 On whether they have had 

 a personal coach

 Raina: Not really, but Ive 

 worked with Deepak Sharma at the Sports College (Lucknow) 

 and with Pramod Gupta at the Sports Hostel (again, in Lucknow)... 

 However, I gained most during the National Cricket Academy 

 camps. Working with Air India coach Pravin Amre has also 

 helped... Im not employed by the airline, but have 

 a scholarship.

 Venugopal: Eldest brother Sai 

 Kumar, who played age-group cricket for Andhra. My parents 

 (Matcheshwara and Appalkonda) wanted me to study through 

 the day, but he persuaded them to be lenient.

 On their Ranji debut

 Raina: In 2002-03.

 Venugopal: Was in 1999-00.

 On the turning point

 Raina: The U-19 World Cup last 

 year and last seasons Deodhar Trophy. The recent probables 

 camp in Bangalore as well... I did just about everything 

 right and got rewarded.

 Venugopal: The unbeaten 228 against 

 England A in the 2003-04 Duleep Trophy... That knock meant 

 a lot not only for me but also Andhra... Then, my consistency 

 in the last season.

 On their selection for 

 the tri-series

 Raina: Irfan Pathan told me before 

 anybody else, at the KSCA Stadium... Later, mamma (Pravesh) 

 and papa (Tirlok Chand) called.

 Venugopal: I was watching a movie 

 in the hotel when my parents telephoned... They heard of 

 my selection on a news channel.

 On being part of Team India

 Raina: Sharing the dressing room 

 with greats is a terrific feeling... Obviously, its 

 a dream come true, but merely being selected isnt 

 enough.

 Venugopal: Theres much more 

 responsibility... I have to make the most of every opportunity.

 On their debut (versus 

 Sri Lanka)

 Raina: I was told about my playing 

 in the morning... Its difficult describing how I felt... 

 I wouldnt say I was nervous... I failed to score, 

 but the bigger disappointment is we fought and still lost... 

 Woh dard ki baat hai.

 Venugopal: It was only in the 

 morning that I learnt I would make it... I was overwhelmed 

 and couldnt react... I accept I was a bit nervous, 

 but thats part of the game.

 On whether theres 

 a preferred batting position

 Raina: No, but Ive been 

 batting at No. 3 for UP.

 Venugopal: Ive got to be 

 flexible, but Im usually at No. 4 or No. 5.

 On what coach Greg Chappell 

 said at their first interaction

 Raina: That Im talented 

 and must continue playing my natural game... Once set, I 

 shouldnt give my wicket away.

 Venugopal: That I must enjoy what 

 Im doing and stay focussed. He talks cricket, nothing 

 else.

 On the pressure factor

 Raina: Will be there, but Im 

 not short on confidence... In fact, I got some runs on the 

 colts tour of Sri Lanka in 2002 and, so, know the 

 conditions. Moreover, Im in a team sport and the seniors 

 are around to make things easy.

 Venugopal: Self-belief counters 

 pressure... Ive come through the ranks and have been 

 absorbing it... I try not to be overwhelmed by situations.

 On hobbies

 Raina: Listening to Jagjit Singh 

 and Sonu Nigam... Im fond of pool and basketball ? 

 I play both. Then, I love watching tennis and (Maria) Sharapova 

 is my favourite. She isnt just a nice looker, but 

 a fine player... I follow Andy Roddick as well. He has the 

 attitude of a winner.

 Venugopal: Im fond of old 

 Hindi songs... Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar, Mohammed 

 Rafi... Telegu songs, too... I also enjoy Chiranjeevi films... 

 Whenever theres time, I head for table tennis and 

 catch tennis telecasts... Pete Sampras game fascinated 

 me and, nowadays, I admire Roger Federer. Hes in the 

 Sampras mould.

 Finally, on being superstitious

 Raina: Im not.

 Venugopal: (Laughs) Ive 

 got to speak to my parents before every match...

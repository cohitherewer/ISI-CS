The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Siliguri to host EB-Vasco match

Margao: The final-round National Football League match between East Bengal and Vasco SC, scheduled to be held at the Salt Lake Stadium in Calcutta on Friday, will now be held at Kanchenjungha Stadium in Siliguri on Saturday. 

The change of venue was due to the municipal elections in the state and the unavailability of adequate police force for the security, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said in a press release on Tuesday. 

The match has been postponed by a day and consequently, the following 22nd-round matches have also been deferred to 21 May, he said. That means, the title of the ninth NFL will be decided on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, it will be pride at stake when former champions Salgaocar and JCT meet each other in their final round engagement at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Tuesday. 

Salgaocar, who lost 0-3 in the away tie in Ludhiana, will surely be looking for revenge at home and coach Shabbir Ali maintains that garnering three points will be his teams motive. 

Salgaocar are currently on 25 points after 21 round with six wins, seven draws and eight defeats. JCT, who are placed one slot above the Goans, are sixth in the race with 28 points having won seven, drawn seven and lost an equal number of ties. 

Salgaocar will be without Mickey Fernandes (red card) and the injured Roberto Fernandes for the tie. 

 The MAY 21 schedule 

East Bengal vs Vasco SC (Kanchenjungha Stadium, Siliguri); Dempo SC vs Tollygunge Agragami (Tilak Maidan, Goa); Sporting Clube de Goa vs Mahindra United (Nehru Stadium, Margao).

- Sourav?s men pull off innings win vs Bangladesh 

Nagpur: East Zone crushed Bangladesh by an innings and 149 runs on the penultimate day of the Duleep Trophy cricket match on Thursday. 

The Bangladesh resumed at their overnight score of 123 for eight after following on and delayed the inevitable for 45 minutes as the last two wickets added 40 runs this morning. 

They were all out for 163 in 40.3 overs giving the Sourav Ganguly-led team a comfortable win at the Vidarbha Cricket Association ground. 

For the visitors, Abdur Razzak remained unbeaten on 58, which came after his impressive bowling performance on Wednesday. 

Among the East bowlers, mediumpacers Shib Shankar Paul (3/30), Ranadeb Bose (3/50) and Sanjib Sanyal (3/34) shared the spoils as they exploited the ideal conditions to humble the Bangla batsmen. 

Earlier, Paul had claimed six for 45 to skittle the visitors out for 142 in the first innings. 

 In reply, East zone declared at 454 for six powered by Sourav?s 170. 

With this outright win that gave them five points, East somewhat recovered from their defeat to Central Zone in Gwalior last week.

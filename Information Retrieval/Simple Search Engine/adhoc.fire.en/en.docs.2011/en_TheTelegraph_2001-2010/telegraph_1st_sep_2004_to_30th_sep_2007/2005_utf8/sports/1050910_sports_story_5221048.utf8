 Indians on the rampage

 - Warm-up tie 

 Virender Sehwag en route to his 123 in Mutare on Friday 

Mutare: The Indian top order came up with solid performance with three centuries, finishing at 365 for two against Zimbabwe Board XI on the second day of the warm-up tie here on Friday. 

The Indians, at stumps, were ahead by 71 runs in reply to 294 for nine declared. They will now be looking for a result on Saturday at the Mutare Sports Club ground. 

Openers Virender Sehwag (122) and Gautam Ghambir (126) put on a partnership of 196. It was padded further by an unbeaten 102 from Rahul Dravid, who had VVS Laxman (9) for company at close. 

Sehwag was contemptuous in his strokeplay, mostly not bothering to run as the quick outfield took the ball past the ropes. Sehwag simply relied on placements. 

He then went on to smash a six and a four off leg-spinner Graeme Cremer before another dash down the track connected little with the ball taking the middle stump out of the sockets. 

He stayed at the crease for 144 minutes, facing 118 balls with 22 fours and two sixes. 

Gambhir, on the other hand, was extremely watchful and it looked like he had a century in mind. He finally raised it in the final session with a cut for two to the third man. He played for 275 minutes, facing 169 with 16 fours, besides a six.

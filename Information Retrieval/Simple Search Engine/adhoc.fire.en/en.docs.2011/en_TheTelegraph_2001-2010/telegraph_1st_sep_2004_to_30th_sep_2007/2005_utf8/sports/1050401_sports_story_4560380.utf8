The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav to come in at No. 3

 - Younis Khan unwell, doubtful for kochi One-dayer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar will open in Kochi 

Kochi: A different opening combination was seen in each of the three ODIs against Bangladesh, over three months ago. However, the one which did duty in the last face-off ? Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag ? will be seen in a similar role here, versus Pakistan. 

The six-match series gets underway on Saturday. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, captain Sourav Ganguly is going to bat at No.3 and will (as of Thursday night) be followed by: Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan and Lakshmipathy Balaji. 

Out of contention, then, are Dinesh Mongia, Murali Kartik and Ashish Nehra. 

While the Indians don?t have worries over fitness (at least), the visitors are concerned about in-form vice-captain Younis Khan?s illness. 

Younis, MoM in the Bangalore Test, is down with a chest infection-induced fever. ?He?s being treated, but I?m not sure if he?s going to be fit for Satu rday, quot; remarked manager Saleem Altaf. 

Pakistan, it may be recalled, have won the last four ODIs against India. 

Lanka visit uncertain 

Meanwhile, there?s uncertainty over the proposed visit by Sri Lanka for five ODIs immediately after the series versus Pakistan ? thanks, of course, to the problem between Sri Lanka Cricket and the government. 

?The picture, frankly, is pretty hazy,? is how a source put it.

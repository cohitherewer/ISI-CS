Wellington: New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin destroyed the cream of Sri Lankan batting with career best figures of six for 54 as the Black Caps dominated the opening day of the second Test at the Basin Reserve here Monday. 

Sri Lanka were all out for 211, recovering from seven for 86, and New Zealand were 52 without loss at stumps. 

Playing his 23rd Test, Martin?s return topped his previous best of six for 76 against South Africa in March last, while Thilan Samaraweera survived on luck to top-score for Sri Lanka with his eighth Test half-century before being the last wicket to fall for 73. 

With a cool southerly breeze at his back Martin had his first wicket within three balls after New Zealand won the toss and elected to bowl. 

He unleashed a sharp inswinger and had first Test century-maker Maravan Atapattu edging a full delivery to Lou Vincent at third slip. 

Martin completed his morning demolition job when he bounced Tillakeratne Dilshan who gloved a simple catch to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum, and he finished the morning with five for 29 off 11 overs. 

After lunch he had Test debutant Shantha Kalavitigoda caught by Vincent for seven, while Chaminda Vaas was undone from James Franklin and bowled for five. 

But as much as Martin had been a lethal one-man strike force, he received little assistance at the other end until Nathan Astle came into his own to mop up the late resistance. 

Standing in as captain after Stephen Fleming left the field following a painful blow on the knee, Astle had Test debutant Farveez Maharoof caught by substitute fielder Jamie How for 12 and then wrapped up the innings with the dismissal of Samaraweera to finish with three for 35. 

Franklin who was taken out of the attack after his first two overs conceded 17 runs, ended the day with one for 51 off 11. New Zealand openers Craig Cumming and James Marshall showed no repeat of the wobbles they suffered against Lisath Malinga in the first Test as they racked up 52 runs before bad light ended play 15 minutes early. 

Marshall was on 24 and Cumming 14. 

New Zealand named an unchanged team from the drawn first Test in Napier.

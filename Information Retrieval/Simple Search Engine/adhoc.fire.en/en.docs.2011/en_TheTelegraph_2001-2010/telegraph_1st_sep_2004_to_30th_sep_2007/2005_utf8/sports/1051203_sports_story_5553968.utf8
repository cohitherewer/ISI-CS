 East Bengal to wait and watch

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: For a club which prides itself on setting new standards and expanding the horizon of Indian football, this will be a blow hard to digest. No wonder the news of coach Subhas Bhowmick getting arrested by the CBI for accepting a bribe came as a rude shock to everyone associated with East Bengal. 

The administration has adopted a wait-and-watch policy, but the officials are mentally gearing up to tackle the biggest crisis to have hit the club in recent times. 

Losing to Mohun Bagan twice en route to surrendering the local league title to their arch-rivals, an early exit from the Federation Cup and Thursday nights shocking ouster from the IFA Shield semis ? East Bengal have nothing to show this season. 

And now this, six days before the teams departure for Delhi where they are scheduled to kick off their Durand Cup campaign on December 11. 

Something very unfortunate has happened, was East Bengal president Dr Pranab Dasguptas initial reaction on Friday evening. 

As of now, he (Bhowmick) has been accused, not convicted. We have a soft corner for him as he has been one of our best coaches? we cant take any decision in haste, said the president. 

According to Dr Dasgupta, the club will wait for one or two days before deciding on the next course of action. I will be meeting the other club officials on Saturday to discuss the matter, lets see. 

It had been business as usual the morning after the demoralising defeat at the hands of Ever-Ready, which denied East Bengal a crack at the Bayern Munich reserve side in Sundays final. Bhowmick was there at the ground to oversee the physical workout of his boys. 

As a couple of players remembered, Bhowmick was very upset over the unexpected loss to Ever-Ready, but did call on the team to forget the past and get ready for the Durand Cup. The coach had announced a two-day holiday and practice was due to resume on Monday. 

Little did anyone know then that an unthinkable piece of news ? much more shocking than the defeat to Ever-Ready ? was to reach them late in the afternoon. 

The club president may have taken a sympathetic stand for the time being, but the fact is, a section of the administration doesnt want Bhowmick to continue. Calls for his removal are bound to grow louder. 

The image of the club will be tarnished if such a man continues to coach the team? East Bengal Club is much bigger than any individual, said somebody who has been associated with the club for several years. 

Bhowmick did guide East Bengal to the ASEAN Cup title as well as a couple of National League crowns. But he also has an unhealthy knack of getting involved in controversies, on and off the field, thus making many enemies. 

As East Bengal brace up for a tough time, Bhowmicks very image could go against him in the discussion on whether to show him the door permanently. 

If Bhowmick is sacked, Manoranjan Bhattacharjee could get the job a second time.

Sydney: Concerned that his pate is starting to resemble an old cricket pitch thats devoid of turf, Shane Warne is undergoing replacement treatment to regenerate his peroxided blond locks. 

The notoriously image-conscious Warne, never afraid to test the boundaries of what is acceptable in the often macho forum of Australian cricket, discovered he was losing his hair dur-ing a recent trip to a hairdresser. 

The 35-year-old Australian leg-spinner, who holds the world record for most Test wickets at 583, signed up with a hair replacement company that has previously featured retired international cricketers Graham Gooch and Greg Matthews in its advertising. 

Warne reportedly will feature in TV and magazine advertising campaigns in Australia. 

Its great. My hair is growing back and my hair loss has stopped, Warne said in a statement. The treatment does not involve surgery, wig implants or hair attachments ? although with his coiffured and peroxided locks it would be harder to pick than his flipper if it did. 

Warne also was undergoing weekly laser therapy and taking regrowth pills, the paper said. (AP)

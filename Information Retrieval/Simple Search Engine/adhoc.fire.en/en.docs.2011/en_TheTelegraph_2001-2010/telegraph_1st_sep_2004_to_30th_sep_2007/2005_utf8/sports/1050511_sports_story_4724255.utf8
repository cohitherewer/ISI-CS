The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Steve to be in city today 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Steve Waugh will be here on Wednesday, making a return some three months after his first largely business trip. 

That the iconic Australian could be back very soon was reported by The Telegraph last week. 

Apparently, Steve is going to start off by again interacting with top real estate developers. 

Yet another meeting with state chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee isnt, of course, ruled out.

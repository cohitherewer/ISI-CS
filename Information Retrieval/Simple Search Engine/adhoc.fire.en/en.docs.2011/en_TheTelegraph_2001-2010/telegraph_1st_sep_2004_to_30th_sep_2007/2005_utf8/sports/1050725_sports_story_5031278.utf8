Montreal: Olympic champion Hu Jia of China nailed his final dive to win the 10m platform title at the Fina world championships on Saturday, giving a resurgent China their second gold medal in as many days. 

After leading through first four dives, Hu appeared to give the gold away with a woeful fif-th attempt which scored mostly 3.5s and 4.0s from the judges. 

But he rebounded with a dazzling dive on his final effort to score 9.0s across the board and finish with a winning total of 698.01. 

Jose Antonio Guerra Oliva earned Cuba their first medal in Olympic or world championship competition by taking the silver with 691.14, while Russias Gleb Galperin completed the podium securing the bronze with 656.19. 

While Guerras silver medal will be viewed as a huge success in Cuba, China, already with 10 medals including four golds, are not as easily satisfied. 

After claiming six out of eight gold medals at the Athens Olympics, Chinese divers were expected to dominate the world championships but have found their road to the top blocked by Canada and the United States. 

China captured gold in the opening two events but did not return to the top of the podium until a one-two finish in the womens 3m springboard on Friday. 

The open water competition concluded on Saturday with Spains David Meca, once banned for testing positive for nandrolone, claiming gold in the mens 25km open water event. Meca posted a winning time of 5::21.4, sprinting home just 2.2 seconds clear of Australias Brendan Capell. 

The Spaniard failed the drugs test at a World Cup meet in 1999 and had a two-year suspension reduced to one.

 Kumble ready for Rlys test

New Delhi: Anil Kumble would be keen to prove his fitness and form as Karnataka take on reigning champions Railways in a Ranji Trophy Elite group A opener beginning here on Wednesday. 

The 35-year-old, with 465 scalps and three short of his 100th Test, will be playing in a first-class match after a gap of six years. Coming back from a two-month rest to treat his lower back, Kumble was only too aware of his responsibilities. 

It is the start of a season and it is important for me to begin on the right note, the veteran leg-spinner said on the eve of the match. 

Former champions Mumbai and Delhi will be looking to fill up the vacuum left by the exit of key players when they clash in another elite group A opener. (PTI)

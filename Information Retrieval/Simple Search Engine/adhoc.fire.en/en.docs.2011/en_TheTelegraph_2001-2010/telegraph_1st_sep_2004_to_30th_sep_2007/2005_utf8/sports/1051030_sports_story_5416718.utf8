The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tharanga should open, not Sangakkara

Straight Talk

 Arjuna Ranatunga

There are different strains of themes, which I have noticed from the first couple of matches. Sri Lanka have slipped to a new level of incompetence and India are on the rise. Theorists would also adjust their landscape of favourites for the 2007 World Cup. For me, the disturbing signals are from seniors who have to provide leadership to a touring party. 

Sanath Jayasuriya, Maravan Atapattu, Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan are our favourite sons. A few failures cant revise their reputations. They now have to dig their heels deep to ensure the team is not redefined if another week, god forbids, of similar intensity is going to rock our boat. 

A few things have been beyond control. Jayasuriya might be a little out of touch but his injury hasnt allowed him to be his ebullient self. He alone now can answer the charge if he is now a foot slow or if his reflexes and eyesight are not what it used to be. 

Murali has been confronted by a real quality batsman in Sachin Tendulkar after a long time and if there are only hundred-odd runs to defend, it restricts even his options. 

Mahela Jayawardene then has to attend his wedding and I dont blame him either for it was arranged before the present schedule was announced. 

I am concerned at the collective batting failure. I also dont approve of Kumar Sangakkara as an opener. The opening combination was duly tinkered but he wasnt the man to be the face of it. 

Upul Tharanga needs to be brought out of the closet as an opener. 

It is easy to overreact on such terrible reverses and I hope such a thing is not happening behind the closed doors of dressing room. There is nothing wrong with the quality of these batsmen. Most who go out of form suffer because they start believing their best has deserted them. 

Pathan is now deserving a closer look as a world class allrounder in the making. Even though he, and his captain Rahul Dravid, wouldnt like this extra weight of expectations to be placed on his shoulders, it is an inescapable offshoot of good performances. 

As for Sachin, he has lifted modern-day mediocrity with his sublime genius. Men like him inspire a generation of youngsters to pick up the game and create a different level of creativity.

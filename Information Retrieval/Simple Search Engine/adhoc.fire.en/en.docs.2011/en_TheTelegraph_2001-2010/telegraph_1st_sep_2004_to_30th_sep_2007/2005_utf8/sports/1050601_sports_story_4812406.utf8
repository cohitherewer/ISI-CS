Kuala Lumpur: Indias chances of a podium finish virtually evaporated after being steamrolled 4-1 by South Korea 4-1 at the Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Tuesday. 

The Asian Games champions dominated proceedings and earned the meets first penalty stroke, and India were lucky to change ends with the scoreboard showing 1-1. 

In an earlier match, Olympic champions Australia rode their luck to hold a Pakistan 2-2 at the Bukit Jalil Stadium. 

This was Pakistans first draw after winning their first three games. They top the table with 10 points, followed by Australia (8). 

The much-awaited India versus Pakistan clash comes off on Wednesday. 

India took the lead through Len Aiyappa. The Koreans bounced back with the equaliser in the first half before striking three times in a span of six minutes after the break. 

Korea, who earned five penalty corners in the first 15 minutes without converting any, levelled the score through Kim Kyung-seuk. They also missed the penalty stroke in the first half. 

In the second half, Kang Seung-jung scored twice in quick succession to make it 3-1. You Hyo-sik rounded off the tally with a field goal. 

The Korean attack lacked the sharpness of their earlier outings here as many unforced errors were committed against the tentative and toothless Indians. 

Korea, who were beaten convincingly by India in their last meeting at the Athens Olympics, forced seven penalty corners in the match as against two by the Indians. 

The defeat was Indias second in four matches. With just four points, India are still to play the meets top two teams ? Pakistan and Australia ? who were involved in a thrilling deadlock on Tuesday. 

Pakistan produced consistent top-flight attack to dominate their more fancied opponents. 

Pakistan, who could have scored in the opening minute, broke through soon after when Shakeel Abbasi deflected home a spectacular Rehan Butt cross. 

The Aussies found the equaliser in the 28th minute off their second penalty corner as Luke Doerner flicked low to the custodians right. 

Pakistan continued with the same rhythm and fluency in the second session with their forwards utilising the flanks. 

They shot into the lead in the 42nd minute when a penalty corner was awarded after Aziz was stick-checked in the circle by Aaron Hopkins. Mohammad Imran made no mistake. 

The Aussies, defending champions here, fought back tooth and nail to draw level in the 63rd minute when Livermore converted a setpiece penalty corner. (PTI)

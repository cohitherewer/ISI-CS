 Changed tactics help Aperitivo win 

 STAR RACER

 C. Alford 

 Calcutta: It was a dramatic reversal of form as Diffident-Dramatic Irony son Aperitivo made a great finishing effort in the final stretch to claim the Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, the prime attraction in the Sunday race card. C. Alford partnered the Vijay Singh-trained less fancied horse to a shade under a length victory over his friendless stablemate Formal Invitation. The course-favourte Star Angel was a poor third.

 Ridden for speed in the Guineas? mile, Aperitivo made a poor match for Moon Emperor last month. However, the changed tactics paid off handsomely for the 5-1 shot over the 2,400m course. 

 Hot-pace strategy of Vijay?s stable also worked to the winner?s advantage. Make A Wish, from the rival camp, tried to generate a moderate pace from the flag fall but she was pushed to the hilt by the opposition. The ploy worked and it unsettled Moon Emperor and the 7-4 favourtite Star Angel as well. The Star Angel did takeover the running in the final stretch but she looked to be tiring. Formidable Invitation and Aperitivo, thereafter fired all cylinders to shoot ahead and save the filly from further agony. Alford booted home two more while Vijay saddled four winners.

 The Derby attendance matched the New Year?s Day?s crowd figure of 14,000 but RCTC totalisator made a new history collecting about Rs 88 lakh. City Mayor Subrata Mukherjee presented the trophy to the winning owner and also acknowledged racecourse being a landmark in the city.

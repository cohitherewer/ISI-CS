 Virk pips Ranjit to title in play-off

Shillong: Jaiveer Virk emerged victorious at the inaugural Airtel PGA Shillong Open, beating Chandigarhs Ranjit Singh by a birdie on the first play-off hole. 

He carded a final round two-under 68 for a par 280 aggregate, and then had to wait for Ranjit to finish . 

Ranjit, one-under for the day and also even-par after seventeen, over shot the 18th on his second shot and then left his chip 15 feet short of the cup. But he kept his cool to make the hole and force a play-off. 

The play-off was more like matchplay, with the pressure on Ranjit. But he showed composure, sticking his approach five feet from the pin.

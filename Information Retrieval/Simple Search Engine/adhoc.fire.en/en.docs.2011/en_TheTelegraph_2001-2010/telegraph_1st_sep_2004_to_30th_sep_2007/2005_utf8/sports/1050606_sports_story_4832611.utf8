 Atwal tied 42nd after Round 3

Dublin (Ohio): American David Toms reeled off an ace, an eagle and four birdies in a flawless eight-under-par 64 as he moved into a four-way tie for the lead in the Memorial tournament third round on Saturday. 

Indias Arjun Atwal carded a one-under 71 for a total of 214. He thus moved up from tied 49th to tied 42nd. 

Runner-up last week at the St Jude Classic and a winner in February at the WGC-Accenture Matchplay Championship, Toms made a blistering start at the Muirfield Village Golf Club before finishing on 12-under 204. 

Overnight leader Sluman, winner of the 1988 USPGA championship, carded a four-under-par 68 while 1992 US Masters champion Couples and Bryant both returned 66s. 

Lurking one stroke off the lead at 11 under were Woody Austin (65) and Jonathan Kaye (68) with Australian Peter Lonard a further shot back in seventh after a 67. 

Three-time champion Tiger Woods carded a 71 for a share of 10th place at eight under. (Reuters)

 Fijian closes in on Tiger

London: World No. 2 Vijay Singh closed the gap on top-ranked Tiger Woods after winning the Wachovia Championship in a playoff at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday. 

The Fijian Singh, who edged Spaniard Sergio Garcia and American Jim Furyk to clinch his third PGA Tour title of the year, now trails Woods by just 0.18 points in the official world rankings. 

The pair have tussled for the top spot all season, each having enjoyed two spells as the games leading player. 

Singh climbed to No. 1 for the first time with victory at the Deutsche Bank Championship last September, when he ended Woods five-year reign at the top. 

Nine-times major champion Woods has been in pole position since winning his fourth US Masters crown at Augusta National last month. 

Garcia, who led the field by six strokes going into the final round at the Wachovia, climbed one spot to eighth in the rankings, replacing Irishman Padraig Harrington who slipped to nine. 

In the only changes to the worlds top 10, American Chris DiMarco and Australias Adam Scott traded places, DiMarco moving up to six and Scott dropping to seven. 

DiMarco, who lost out to Woods in a playoff for the Masters four weeks ago, finished fourth at the Wachovia while Scott tied for 16th.

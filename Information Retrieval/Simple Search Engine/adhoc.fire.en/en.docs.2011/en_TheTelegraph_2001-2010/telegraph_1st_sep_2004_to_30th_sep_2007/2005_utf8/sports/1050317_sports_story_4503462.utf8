The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sachin is No. 1, says Inzy

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: ?Main Sachin Tendulkar ko 

badhai dena chahta hoon? Woh No.1 batsman hain,? is how Inzamam-ul 

Haq complimented the Indian icon. 

Speaking to The Telegraphon Wednesday evening, 

some hours after Sachin joined the 10,000 Test runs? club, the Pakistan captain 

added: ?He?s the only one to have got 10,000 in both Tests and ODIs and, so, that 

confirms he?s the best?? 

While Inzamam has himself joined the 10,000 ODI runs? club, he trails Rahul Dravid in the list of those closest to making it in Tests. 

?Getting to 10,000 Test runs is a target? Inshallah, I?ll get there,? he remarked. His tally reads: 7,195. 

Inzamam, by the way, was off the Eden turf for much of the second Test?s first afternoon. It was his return, incidentally, which ?inspired? Pakistan?s fightback in the final session. 

It?s another matter that the Indian batsmen made it easier. 

?Kya karen, I began to vomit and was advised 

to rest for some time,? Inzamam explained, adding: ?I?m absolutely fine now.?

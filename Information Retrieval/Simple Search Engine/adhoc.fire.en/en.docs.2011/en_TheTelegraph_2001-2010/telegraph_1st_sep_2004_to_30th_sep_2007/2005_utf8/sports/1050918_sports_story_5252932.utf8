Calcutta: East Bengal limped through the first session but gallopped in the second to brush aside Mohammedan Sporting 3-0 in a CFL Premier Division clash under lights at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

Arun Malhotra put the red-and-golds ahead four minutes into the match. Alvito DCunha doubled the advantage nine minutes after half-time, while the prolific Syed Rahim Nabi booted home the third a little later. 

East Bengals second-half resurgence was all the more creditable as afternoon showers made underfoot conditions treacherous. It took a heavy toll on limbs and muscles, with the referee having to stop the game times without number. 

There were a couple of casualties as well, with Covan Lawrence and Jiten Rai colliding mid-air in the 65 th minute and falling heavily on the slippery turf. 

Both had gashes on the forehead, and needed five stitches each at IFAs on-site medical unit. The duo could be out of action for a week. 

Till the time he was on field, Rai ? in tandem with Amjad Ali Khan, Satyajit Bose and Ghanaian debutant Patrick DSouza ? been a source of harassment for the East Bengal defence. Rai, in fact, tried two left-footers which missed the mark by not much. Amjad had done the spadework on both occasions from the right flank. 

Just before half-time, Satyajit and Patrick set up an inviting ball into the East Bengal penalty box, but M. Suresh was quicker to the ball than Rai. 

East Bengal got an early goal, thanks to Malhotras opportunism. As a Jatin Bisht free-kick swerved into the danger zone, the East Bengal defender stretched a leg out amid a forest of defenders and tapped the ball through the untenanted second post. 

But for that goal, it was Mohammedan Sporting who called the shots in the first 45 minutes. 

The wake-up call must have come in the dressing-room, for East Bengal looked a much sharper outfit after the lemon break. Bisht was captain of the ship, controlling the midfield and switching the ball to the hitherto unused flanks. Side-backs Surya Bikash Chakraborty and Saumik Dey responded well, so did Nabi and DCunha. 

The hard-running Mohammedan Sporting boys suddenly looked to have run out of gas. Bisht bulldozed his way past Muhammad Mukhtar and laid the ball on a platter for DCunha to run in and place it past Gopal Das. 

Bisht had a major role in the third goal as well. The energetic medio picked up a pass from DCunha and forwarded charge to Nabi. The goal-hungry striker saw custodian Das leaving charge and promptly pushed the ball past him. 

This was Nabis seventh goal of the competition, putting him on par with Mohun Bagans Gley Yao Rodrigue atop the scorers list. East Bengal (25 points from 11 matches) may not have any realistic chance of denying Mohun Bagan the title, but Nabi can still pip the Togolese striker to the highest scorers accolade. 

Nabi, in fact, could have got goal No. 8 on Saturday itself. A Saumik cross found him five yards from the goal, but the keeper made a desperate lunge to get the ball out of harms way.

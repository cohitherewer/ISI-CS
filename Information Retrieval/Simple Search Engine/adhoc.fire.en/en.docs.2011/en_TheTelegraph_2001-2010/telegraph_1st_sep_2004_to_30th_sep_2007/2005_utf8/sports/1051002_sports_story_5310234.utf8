 Gerrard: We must be more adventurous 

 - Liverpool focused on putting Chlsea in place

OLIVER KAY

 Gerrard is hoping for a bit of luck 

Lost amid the finger-jabbing and the caustic comments traded at the end of Liverpools much-hyped Champions League match against Chelsea on Wednesday evening, was an exchange of a different type between Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. 

After the final whistle at Anfield, the England teammates swapped shirts and Gerrard instinctively went to put the blue one over his head. 

At the last moment, he realised how such an act may be interpreted and thought better of it, hanging it over his shoulder instead. 

In one way it was a nothing incident, but in another it said much about the improvement in Gerrards state of mind after 18 months in which it was riddled by uncertainty and doubt. 

Chelsea figured so prominently in his thoughts last season that he would have been fully conscious of the significance of putting on the shirt of the club he was expected to join. 

One summer of soul-searching and one spectacular volte-face later, having finally nailed his colours to the red mast, the Liverpool captain finally feels able, or very nearly able, to drop his guard. 

Now, with his team about to face Chelsea for the second time in four days on Sunday, Gerrard is urging Liverpool to do the same. 

He was delighted with much of their performance in shading the draw between the teams in the Champions League match, but the final scoreline in that game, 0-0, was disappointingly familiar. 

Four clean sheets in five Premiership games are testament to what Liverpool are doing right under Rafael Benitez, but the other side of the coin is a miserly return of three goals at the other end, two of them away to Birmingham City a week ago. 

For all that they were denied at least one clear-cut penalty on Wednesday, Liverpool did not once seriously test Petr Cech, the Chelsea goalkeeper, and the difference between controlling games and winning them is one that Gerrard feels could be put right on Sunday by a slight change of emphasis in attack. 

I think we could do with being a little more adventurous in certain areas and push on just that little bit more, he said on Friday, although a bit of luck wouldnt go amiss either. 

Rick Parry, the chief executive, admitted on Friday that he hoped to talk to Benfica in the January transfer window about Simao, who was extremely impressive on the left wing against Manchester United on Tuesday. 

That is a signing that would meet with Gerrards approval, but such concerns, happily, no longer seem to prevail at Anfield, where everyone, not least their captain, is focused on plotting the downfall of Chelsea.

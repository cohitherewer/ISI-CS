The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Off-the-field battle also in focus

 - Opposition gearing up for reconvened AGM 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Jaipur: The on-field cricket is all too visible, not so Board-specific behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings. 

Nagpur, Mohali and, now, Jaipur... Its an unusual coincidence that the first three ODIs against Sri Lanka have all been in opposition territory. In fact, barring Ahmedabad, the associations headquartered in the three other remaining centres ? Pune, Rajkot and Vadodara ? are also in Union minister Sharad Pawars camp. 

So, interest isnt just on the India versus Lanka face-offs, but the firming of the opposition strategy to counter Jagmohan Dalmiya and his man ? current president Ranbir Singh Mahendra. 

Former Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra, though, insists that too much should not be read into a string of anti-Dalmiya centres being the hosts in quick succession. Fact is everybody is busy hosting the ODIs... But, yes, Mr Pawar is going to contest the presidentship when the AGM gets reconvened, he told The Telegraph on Monday. 

While Raj Singh Dungarpur, Niranjan Shah and Lalit Modi were in Bindras Mohali for last Fridays ODI, the opposition stalwarts are here in strength as well: Bindra, Raj Singh and Shah... Jaipur is Modi territory. 

While Bindra said he wasnt aware of any move towards a Pawar-Dalmiya compromise, Shah asked: Why should we go for one? What for? Clearly, hes convinced that the camp he belongs to has the numbers. 

Unsure of how the voting script would unfold, Dalmiya (a former president) and Pawar had agreed to a temporary draw before the AGM got adjourned last month. Now, when its reconvened in a few weeks, former chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy will be the observer. 

Both parties have agreed to that ? before the Supreme Court.

 Zidane mulls early retirement

 - Cant say Im satisfied with season 

 Zinedine Zidane in Madrid on Wednesday 

Madrid: Three-time World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane has said he could retire before his contract at Real Madrid expires in 2007. 

I will definitely retire in 2007 and Im not ruling out going before that, but I will take the decision when the moment comes, the French midfielder, who is 33 next month, was quoted as saying on the Real Madrid website on Thursday. 

Zidane, who joined Real who joined Real for a world record $66 million from Juventus in 2001, said he still had an appetite for the game but he was disappointed with both his and his teams performances this season. 

I cant say that Im satisfied with the season. The aim was to win a 10th European Cup and the league. We were knocked out of the Champions League very early and all that is left to us is the league and that is very difficult now. 

On a personal level it hasnt been a good season, but all Im thinking about now is finishing, having a holiday and returning with my motivation intact. Next year the motivation will still be there. 

The last two years have been difficult, but that is what makes football so great. You cant always win even when though you dont lose your motivation. 

Real have won their last seven league matches but remain six points adrift of Barcelona with just three games left to play. 

If the Catalans win their match against Levante on Saturday or match Reals result at third-placed Sevilla they will claim the league title, while their arch-rivals will complete a second successive season without a major trophy. 

Zidane, who won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European championship with France, retired from international football after Euro 2004 and said he would not reconsider his decision to help his country qualify for the 2006 World Cup. 

My decision is irreversible, he said. France will qualify. The situation is difficult but Im sure they will do it. 

France top their qualification group, but are level on points with Israel and have played a game more than both Ireland and Switzerland who are a point behind them in the standings.

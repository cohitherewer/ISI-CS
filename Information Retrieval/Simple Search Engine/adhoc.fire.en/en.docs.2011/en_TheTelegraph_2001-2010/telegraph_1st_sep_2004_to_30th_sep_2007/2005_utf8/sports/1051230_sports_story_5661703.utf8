London: Chelsea extended their Premier League lead to 11 points after Joe Cole earned the champions a 1-0 win over Manchester City and rivals Manchester United were held 2-2 by Birmingham City on Wednesday. 

European champions Liverpool ran out 3-1 winners over Everton, who finished with nine men in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park to close within four points of United. 

There were plenty of goals in London where Arsenal crushed Portsmouth 4-0, Fulham drew 3-3 with Aston Villa and Wigan Athletic beat West Ham 2-0. West Bromwich Albion were surprise 2-0 winners over Tottenham Hotspur at the Hawthorns. 

Chelsea, whose only league defeat last season came at the City of Manchester Stadium, had to wait until the 79th minute for the matchwinning tap-in from Cole after an Eidur Gudjohnsen shot was parried. 

Its probably the toughest game weve had all season, Cole said. 

But we passed the ball well and in the end deserved to win... and it was a great win, especially with Manchester United dropping points. 

It was a frustrating night for Alex Fergusons United, who led twice against Birmingham through Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy and England strike partner Wayne Rooney. 

They were pegged back for a draw by a side battling relegation after a late equaliser by Walter Pandiani which left them on 41 points, compared to Chelseas 52, from 19 games. 

Liverpool stay third after a ninth league win in a row but closed in on United with 37 points from 17 games, three points ahead of Spurs and Wigan. 

Liverpool captain Steve Gerrard did the damage, setting up their first goal for Peter Crouch and scoring the second. James Beattie pulled one back for Everton but a solo effort by Liverpools French striker Djibril Cisse sealed the win. 

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez was not fully satisfied with their performance. 

I am very happy, but at times in the first half Everton caused us problems in the air and we were not winning second balls, he told the clubs website. 

Tottenham coach Martin Jol, a former West Brom player, made an unhappy return to his old club as Spurs went down to two goals from Nigerian striker Nwankwo Kanu. 

Kanus old club, Arsenal, moved up to sixth place on 32 points from 18 games with their thumping win at Highbury. 

All the goals came in the first half ? with captain Thierry Henry scoring twice, including a penalty, and Dennis Bergkamp and Jose Antonio Reyes getting the others. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was in optimistic mood. 

I have always said there is a lot of potential in the team and we can grow quickly because we have many young players and from month to month theyre playing better, he said.

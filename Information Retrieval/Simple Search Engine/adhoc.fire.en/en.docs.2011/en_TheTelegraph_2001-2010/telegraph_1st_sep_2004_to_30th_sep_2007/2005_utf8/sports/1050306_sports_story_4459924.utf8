The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Players must understand their role

 - Dangerous to go into series with pre-conceived ideas 

JAVED MIANDAD 

 Inzy can?t be blamed for losing 6 of the last 8 Tests 

I have often wondered if Pakistan have enough batsmen who can bat an entire day and whether a score of 500 is possible. Or bowlers who would not spoil two good balls with two full-tosses and long-hops. Is there enough quality at the top? 

Is there an allrounder who is willing to make number seven all his own? What about the balance in bowling? There are questions, far too many of them. 

In search for these answers, we are sadly barking up the wrong tree. Too often, we say that the team is young and inexperienced. It drives me mad. Test cricket is not a classroom where you get admission to learn. Learning must end at domestic level. Once you are representing your country, you are believed to be ready. 

And by the way, who are the youngsters we are talking about? Yasir Hameed has been around for two years, as also Taufeeq Umar. Abdul Razzaq and Shahid Afridi are not greenhorns. And Mohammed Sami? Or Arshad Khan? What about Shoaib Malik and Salman Butt? But for Mohammed Khalil, everyone has been around for at least two years. 

Under the new regime of Inzamam-ul Haq and Bob Woolmer, five or six series have been played. I am not sure if a single pattern has emerged which could indicate the team has pursued a line of action passionately. Either individuals have not been assigned their roles, or they have not fulfilled them. 

Whenever a team fails, a captain is hauled over the coals. But a captain is as good as his team. He is run by his players. During my time, the West Indies had players who had talent and understanding of their roles. Clive Lloyd earned a reputation because of them. Inzamam is not to blame for the team winning two and losing six Tests out of the eight it has contested since 2004. 

This is not to suggest Inzy should not have a strategy in place. But it is dangerous if you go into a game with pre-conceived ideas. I-will-only-attack or I-will-only-defend is not the way it works in Tests . 

In recent times, we have heard murmurs in the media that Shoaib Akhtar was not used well by Inzamam. Of course, every individual has his own limitations. But when you are playing for your country, you have to do everything. You have to see the team?s point of view. 

That?s what the present team would do well to remember in India. We all know they can make attractive 50s and 60s. But what the team needs from them is big hundreds and long hours at the crease. 

I sincerely believe this Pakistan team is very talented. But players must understand their roles.

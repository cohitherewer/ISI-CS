The Telegraph - Calcutta

 WTA clears star, flays minister

 - Doping Charge

 Protective veil around Kuznetsova 

 Svetlana Kuznetsova took ephedrine, not banned in out-of-competition events 

Melbourne: The cloud of suspicion over Russia?s US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has yet to lift, despite the Women?s Tennis Association (WTA) clearing her of a doping offence and saying that the Belgian government official (minister) who made the accusation got it wrong. 

Belgian regional sports minister Claude Eerdekens announced on Monday that the world No. 5 had tested positive for ephedrine at a charity exhibition tournament in Charleroi last month. 

However, the WTA said ephedrine, a stimulant found in over-the-counter cough and cold remedies, was not on the list of prohibited drugs if taken in out-of-competition events such as last month?s charity event. 

That wasn?t clearing the issue, though. Tennis officials threw a protective veil around Kuznetsova here Tuesday. Kuznetsova did not play at Melbourne Park Tuesday but still drew more attention than most of the players who were in action. Five security officers were assigned to escort her to the outside courts for her practice session with Colombian Fabiola Zuluaga. 

The pair spent an hour on court and Kuznetsova appeared relaxed despite all the attention. 

She signed autographs and chatted with fans but refused to answer questions from the media though she later issued a statement through the WTA. And the Belgian minister at the centre of the scandal refused to apologise for announcing she had tested positive. ?I will never offer an apology,? Eerdekens said in a telephone interview in Brussels. 

WTA chief executive Larry Scott has demanded an apology from Eerdekens. But Eerdekens said: ?If this is the conception of sport at the highest level... there is something rotten in the world of sport,? he said. 

?I think what he (Eerdekens) has done is disgraceful. I know our players would like to see an immediate apology for the damage that its done to our sport already,? Scott said. ?It?s just shameful what an irresponsible person like this can do to the reputation of a clean sport.? 

Kuznetsova protested her innocence on Tuesday, saying she had taken cold medicine. 

?I pride myself on being a clean athlete of the highest integrity and am offended by these disgraceful accusations,? she said in a statement. 

?I am sure of my innocence and I will not allow these irresponsible accusations, which do not comply with credible anti-doping procedures, to distract me or my performance at the Australian Open.? 

 Exhibition tournaments like the Charleroi event are regarded as out of competition and players can also apply for an exemption to the rules if they are taking cold medicines which may contain ephedrine, Scott said. 

Kuznetsova?s doubles partner, Australian Alicia Molik, typified the anger felt by players. ?I bought every single newspaper in the convenience store and threw them away. That?s how strongly I felt about the issue,? Molik said. 

?How can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping?? Dechy had mediamen Friday. Dementieva said: ?You have no idea what I have been through all these days. It?s been too hard on me. 

?The WTA are trying to handle this problem by saying there is three victims, but I see only two victims in this story ? me and Nathalie Dechy, who really have nothing to do with this.? 

?To be honest with you, I don?t feel like I want to talk to Sveta (Kuznetsova) at all. I?m just very upset with the way everything has happened. I don?t feel like I want to talk to her, that?s it,? Dementieva said. 

Other leading players were also quick to show their support for the three women. Briton Greg Rusedski, who was at the centre of a doping scandal last year before being cleared of any wrong-doing, said he sympathised with the three women and blamed the Belgian official. 

?It should never be made public, these sorts of things, until all the facts are out, until there?s a tribunal, until everything goes through,? he said. ?I just wish he just would have kept his mouth shut and dealt with it properly.?

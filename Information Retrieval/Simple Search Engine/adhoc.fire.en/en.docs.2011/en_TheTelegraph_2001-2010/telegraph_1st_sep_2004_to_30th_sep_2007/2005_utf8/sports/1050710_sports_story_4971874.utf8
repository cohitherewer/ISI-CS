Silverstone: Formula One title favourite Fernando Alonso seized pole position for Sundays British Grand Prix after a blown engine scuppered Kimi Raikkonens chances. 

The championship leaders fourth pole for Renault in 11 races came as a surprise after he had talked down his teams chances in a race that appeared to favour Raikkonens McLaren above all others. 

His lap also dashed Jenson Buttons hopes of starting his home race from the top slot. 

The BAR driver had been in line for pole until the Spaniard, winner five times this year, lapped the former wartime airfield circuit in one minute 19.905 seconds. 

Button will still start alongside the 23-year-old after Raikkonen, who was second fastest and just 0.027 slower than Alonso, dropped 10 places as a penalty for having his cars engine changed. 

It was the Finns second engine failure in two races and he will start 12th. Its a great result for us, said Alonso, who leads Raikkonen by 24 points with nine races remaining. 

McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya could prove a bigger threat than Raikkonen, the Colombian starting on the clean side of the track in third place with Italian Jarno Trulli for Toyota alongside. 

Ferraris seven time world champion Michael Schumacher, winner at Silverstone last year, qualified a disappointing tenth. 

Raikkonen finished second in France after starting 13th and Silverstone is a circuit that plays to the McLarens strengths. He refused to give up hope despite his evident frustration.Theres nothing I can do, I just have to drive as quickly as I can and well see what happens, the Finn said. 

Narain Karthikeyan took the 17th position on the grid. Narains performance made up for the disappointment of his Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro being relegated to back grid as a penalty for engine change during the practice sessions Friday. 

Monteiro will start 20th last after he completed a formal one lap at the qualifying at the Silverstone circuit. 

I had a decent lap today, Narain said. I think the wind was a bit stronger compared to this morning so it changed the balance of the car a little but I think my time was pretty good.

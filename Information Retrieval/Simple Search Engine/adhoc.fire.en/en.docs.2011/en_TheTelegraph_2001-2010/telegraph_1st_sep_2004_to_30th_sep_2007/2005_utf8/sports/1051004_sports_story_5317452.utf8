 Give Sourav some time: Mahendra

London: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has virtually put captain Sourav Ganguly on notice, saying the selection committee may have to take a decision on his future if he failed to come out of the prolonged form slump he is going through. 

According to BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra, it wouldnt be prudent to hastily judge coach Greg Chappell, whose spat with the captain made headlines recently. 

Mahendra said the Board was concerned with Souravs poor form, but believed it was appropriate to give all players, and especially the captain, some time to get back form. 

You should give the selection committee and the players, particularly Sourav, some time. If, in the coming days, the performance doesnt improve, the selection committee will keep in mind the feelings of crores of fans and make an appropriate decision, Mahendra told BBC Hindi in an interview. 

On whether Sourav should continue as captain, Mahendra said: It is for the selection committee to decide and the Board will not interfere. 

The BCCI chief also refuted suggestions that the Board was turning a blind eye to Souravs poor form and his tendency to get embroiled in controversies. 

See, what you are saying could also be what cricket fans in the country are saying. But let us all not forget that Sourav scored a Test hundred in Zimbabwe, he said. 

In answer to an observation that Chappell had brought tension to the team, he said: An opinion should not be formed about an individual in haste. We would be doing grave injustice to him by passing judgement so soon. 

We have to give Greg time, and then I think such opinions will change. At times, when the team is not performing up to mark, and is passing through a critical phase, thoughts like these do come to mind. But my view is that jumping to conclusions so soon about the coach would not be fair. (PTI)

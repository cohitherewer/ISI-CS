Centurion: Andre Nel claimed the important wicket of Andrew Strauss to have England at 114 for four as bad light and storms brought a premature end to the third day?s play of the fifth and final Test here on Sunday. 

 The weather took another 50 overs out of the match after the entire first day was lost at Centurion Park through rain on Friday. 

England lead the series 2-1, having won the first Test by seven wickets and the fourth by 77 runs. South Africa won the third Test by 196 runs, while the second was drawn. 

Strauss battled his way to 44 as he found batting difficult for the first time in the series. He struggled for 191 minutes and faced 124 balls. 

He eventually fell after some aggressive bowling from Nel, who hit him on the shoulder, found the outside edge as Strauss tried to drive and was caught by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 

Undefeated at the close was Graham Thorpe, who fought even harder to reach 32 off 115 deliveries as England attempted to rebuild the innings after the visitors had slumped to 29 for three. With him was Andrew Flintoff, who did not face a delivery. 

South Africa put England on the back foot early on day 3 as the tourists lost three vital wickets to be 66 for three at lunch. 

England lost three key wickets quickly. First to go was Marcus Trescothick, who managed 20 before being run out by Nicky Boje after facing 26 deliveries. 

Then Shaun Pollock struck with the wicket of Robert Key, who rolled a delivery off the face of the bat down the leg side into Boucher?s gloves for one. 

Pollock then claimed the wicket of Michael Vaughan, who skied an attempted pull shot to Jacques Rudolph and was dismissed for a duck. 

Gibbs fined by team 

Meanwhile, Herschelle Gibbs was fined his entire match fee for staying out late during the third Test in Cape Town. 

Gibbs was docked 25,000 rand after a disciplinary process conducted by the team management. The offence was Gibbs? sixth serious run-in with cricket?s authorities.

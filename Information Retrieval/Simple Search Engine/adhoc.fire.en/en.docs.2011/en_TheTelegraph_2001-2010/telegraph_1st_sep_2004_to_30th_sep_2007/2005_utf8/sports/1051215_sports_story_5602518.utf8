 Michelin snaps ties with Formula One

Paris: French tyre group Michelin on Wednesday said it was ending its involvement with Formula One after the 2006 season following a decision by the organising body to prefer only one tyre supplier. 

This leaves Bridgestone 108.T of Japan as the single supplier. 

He said the uncertainty thrown up by the F1 authorities did not give sufficient guarantees to justify long-term investments. 

Michelin supplies seven of the 10 Formula One teams and Bridgestone the rest, and in 2006 they will have an equal split as Williams and Toyota are leaving Michelin. 

The French tyre maker, the worlds biggest, clashed with the FIA over the US Grand Prix fiasco in June when their seven teams failed to start due to tyre safety concerns at Indianapolis. 

The French group said that after consultations with its teams ? McLaren-Mercedes, BMW-Sauber, Renault and Honda Racing ? it seemed the move to one tyre supplier was unavoidable. 

It promised full support to the teams in 2006 and said it could come back to the sport if the rules were changed profoundly in the future.

Paris: Nikolay Davydenko moved closer to a Masters Cup slot when he beat fellow-Russian Dmitry Tursunov 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters on Thursday. 

Davydenko, seeded third, one of several players fighting for a place in the eight-strong season finale from November 13 in Shanghai, made many unforced errors and needed more than two hours to overcome qualifier Tursunov. 

Davydenko, a semi-finalist at this years French Open, will make sure of a ticket to Shanghai if he reaches the final. 

Six players have already secured a spot in the Masters Cup, Argentine Guillermo Coria joining the list after Russias Marat Safin pulled out because of a knee injury. 

The last two spots will be determined this week in Paris. 

Former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, seeded 13th, became the latest casualty of a tournament missing many top names because of injuries when Czech Tomas Berdych beat him 7-5, 6-7, 6-4 in a third-round match. 

Berdych held his nerve throughout a close battle which lasted two hours 32 minutes. 

The 20-year-old fired 20 aces, the last one giving him three match points. A service winner on the first sent him through to the last eight. 

Spains Tommy Robredo, the 14th seed, also advanced to the quarter-finals, ending the run of Serbia and Montenegros teenage hope Novak Djokovic with a straightforward 6-4 6-3 win.

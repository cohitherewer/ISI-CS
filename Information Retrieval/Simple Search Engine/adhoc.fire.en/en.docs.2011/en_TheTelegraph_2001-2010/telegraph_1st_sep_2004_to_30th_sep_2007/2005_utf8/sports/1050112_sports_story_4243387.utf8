 Tough to match MCG proceeds: ACC

Sydney: The funds generated from the Melbourne match has raised the benchmark and it could be tough for Asia to match the figures, feels the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). 

Proceeds from Monday?s game amounted to a whopping Aus $14.6 million and the figure is expected to increase from an on-line auction of cricketers? merchandise. 

ACC chief executive Syed Ashraful Haq said he has been overwhelmed by the response but was not sure if Asia, which is to host the second fund-raiser, could match it. 

?I really don?t know whether we can raise the same amount of money,? Haq said. 

?It is quite a tall figure. People in the subcontinent are giving to charitable causes every year, because of some natural catastrophe or other,? he was quoted as saying on Tuesday. 

However, he expected Asians to show solidarity. 

?I think this is something that is helping to put the world together again,? he stated. 

Meanwhile, Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young said there would be some increase in the amount raised during Monday?s match. 

?The bulk of the work has been done, but there will be some additions,? Young said. 

Revenues from telecast rights in 122 countries are still to be finalised, besides the proceeds from the auction.

Helsinki: Russias Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own world pole vault record minutes after winning her first world title on Friday. 

The 23-year-old Olympic Champion, the first woman to clear five metres in London last month, got over 5.01 metres to set the new record after earlier clearing 4.70 to take gold. 

She had secured the title when Polands Monika Pyrek failed twice at 4.70 and once at 4.75. Pyrek won silver and Czech Pavla Hamackova the bronze. 

European indoor champion Ladji Doucoure of France won the mens 110 metres hurdles title on Friday ahead of Chinese Olympic champion Liu Xiang. 

Doucoure flashed across the line in 13.07 seconds, one-hundreth of a second in front of Liu. 

American Allen Johnson, who was bidding to win a record fifth world track title, took the bronze. 

Sergey Kirdyapkin filled the void left by Pole Robert Korzeniowski to lead home a Russian 1-2 in the 50km walk. The 25-year-old led from the very beginning to take gold in a personal best of 3::38:8, lowering his previous best by over three minutes. 

Olympic bronze medallist Aleksey Voyevodin gave tough competition till halfway but was shaken off, settling for silver in 3::41:25. Italys Alex Schwazer, who was seventh at the halfway stage, rallied to take bronze in 3::41:54. 

Defending champions the United States failed to finish their first round heat in the mens 4x100 relay on Friday. The baton was dropped in a bungled changeover between leadoff runner Mardy Scales and Leonard Scott. 

The elimination of the US team means world 100 and 200 champion Justin Gatlin cannot win a third gold medal. Its disappointing because I had high hopes I would go out and bring home the gold, he said. 

On Thursday, Gatlin sped through the rain to complete the mens 100-200 double on a night of triumph for the United States. 

Americans won three of the five titles at stake on the sixth day and US sprinters took the first four places in the 200 metres (reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

Olympic 100 champion Gatlin confirmed the impression that he is in a class of his own in Helsinki by winning in 20.04 seconds before a sell-out crowd on another cold, wet and generally miserable night at the Olympic stadium. 

I consider myself right now the king of sprints, Gatlin said. When I came off the turn I was going to gun it, thats what I did then I had to have enough in the tank at the end. I had to make sure I was calm, patient and made my way strong throughout the race. 

Gatlin led off the bend and had the race won in the straight, glancing to his left to confirm he had defeated teammate Wallace Spearmon. 

Spearmon, selected for the US team when Olympic champion Shawn Crawford withdrew with a foot injury, was second in 20.20. John Capel, who had an automatic place in the championships as defending champion, was third in 20.31 just ahead of Tyson Gay. 

Three titles were decided in the space of a minute in the field events. 

American Walter Davis recorded his winning leap in the mens triple jump, Franka Dietzsch of Germany took the title-deciding lead in the womens discus and Dutchman Rens Blom clinched the mens pole vault. 

Michelle Perry won the 100 metres hurdles for the United States after her teammate and Olympic champion Joanna Hayes crashed into the penultimate flight. 

Blom overcame cramps in his legs and an indifferent start to give the Netherlands their first pole vault title at either a World Championships or Olympic Games. 

He cleared 5.80 metres on an awkward evening for vaulting to relegate favourite Brad Walker of the United States into second place. 

He did not start well, however, as he only cleared 5.50 on his third attempt and then just made 5.65 on his second in front of his idol Sergei Bubka, who was looking on from the stands. 

It was in the Finnish capital that the great Bubka took the first of six consecutive world golds 22 years ago when the championships were first staged. 

The Ukrainian watched Walker and Blom match each other vault for vault until both cleared 5.75 on their second attempts. 

Then the Dutchman, struggling with leg cramps, set a seasons best of 5.80 on his first attempt, just one centimetre below his personal best. 

Walker had tried once at that height already and failed so he moved up to 5.85 but did not get over on his two attempts. 

The 28-year-old Blom, whose biggest feat was a world indoor bronze two years ago, got a sportsmanlike hug from Walker and then ran up into the crowd to kiss his teary-eyed girlfriend. 

Perry, who has converted from the heptathlon to the hurdles this season, clocked 12.66 to take gold ahead of Jamaicans Delloreen Ennis-London and Brigitte Foster-Hylton. I was able to run without hitting any of the hurdles, she said. During the race I didnt even notice what happened to Joanna.

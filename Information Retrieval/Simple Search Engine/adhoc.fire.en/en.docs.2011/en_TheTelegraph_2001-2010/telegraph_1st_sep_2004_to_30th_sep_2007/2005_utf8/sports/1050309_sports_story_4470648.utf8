Calcutta: There?s caution in the air as East Bengal and Muktijoddha Sansad of Bangladesh prepare for Wednesday?s AFC Cup preliminary face-off at the Salt Lake Stadium. East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick is ?worried? that the Bangla team had a month and-a-half worth of practice and Muktijoddha coach Safiqul Islam Manik believes all these matches in the National Football League have ?polished? the red-golds to perfection. 

Whatever the status of the match, neither Bhowmick nor Manik is willing to talk about a draw. ?I keep East Bengal the favourites for tomorrow, more so because they are playing at home? Manik said at a press meet Tuesday afternoon, ?but we surely have come here to win.? 

?Believe me, the difference between football in India and Bangladesh is nominal today,? said Bhowmick. To that extent, there isn?t a clear front-runner, he believes. But Bhowmick, too, makes it clear that a win is the only clear target. 

The problem with East Bengal, of course is in injuries. Douglas da Silva?s shattered shin bone, to be specific. And Deepak Mondal isn?t available either. The defence does worry Bhowmick, ?but I am not despairing,? Bhowmick says. ?I have a bench, that can give me support.? Reference, was to rearranged responsibility for Debjit Ghosh, and even Madhab Das. 

Already, Bhowmick is looking ahead to the quarter finals. ?I believe this group league is more difficult than the quarters will be,? he says. ?I believe the Jordanian team Al Faisaly will be the strongest. Important, thus, is the job at hand, tomorrow?s match being the first step.? The other team in the group are Turkmenistan?s Nebitchi FC. 

Bhowmick seems also rather worried over the ?pressure? he says that has developed, in the form of demands from the team ?by fans, officials, even the media.? At the same time, he also says he is ?saddened? that fans aren?t turning up in numbers for the matches. ?Their vocal support used to start the team off two goals in the black,? he says. His focus seems a trifle diffused here. 

The moot point for Bhowmick, is one Marcos Secco, Douglas? brother from Brazil. ?He is a good player. Very intelligent. He can play in deep defence, and in midfield, as well as side back for overlaps,? said Bhowmick. ?His game-reading is s good as Douglas?, but in on-field performance he may be better than Douglas.? 

Even as this seems like an end to Bhowmick?s immediate problems, the coach warns that ?there will, probably be a time lag while Marcos gets attuned to the needs of the team and teammates. Also, it isn?t easy to get used to the demands that are made of this team.? Quite a lot of air has been given to the report that East Bengal are the fifth Asian Club team today. Manik pointed out with a smile: ?Yes, but these rankings vary from time to time.? 

And Manik is sure that the best he will have to contend with is Bhaichung Bhutia. ?India?s best player, we will look out for him.? 

Bhowmick?s other nagging worry, if it may be called that, is in the two foreigners in the Muktijoddha team ? Ghanaian Charles Hansa Benin and Rwandan Habimana Hary. ?We know little about them, we need to,? he said. Manik isn?t as eloquent about them either, the team having played no formal practice matches before their arrival here. 

Manik hastens to add, though, that he, too, will be missing two key players through injury and a foreigner because of international transfer certificate problems. 

Muktijoddha?s last tourney was in September when they lost 0-3 to East Bengal and 1-3 to Mohammedan Sporting to bow out at the league stage of the IFA Shield. Bhaichung, of course, believes the team will suffice, Douglas or not. ?Douglas? absence will be felt, but we play as a team.?

 Madrid: Claudio Ranieri, who was sacked as Valencia coach on Friday just eight months into his second spell in charge, says he takes full responsibility for his failure to get the best out of the Spanish champions.

 ?I have always tried to create a group of players that battle hard and work together, but this time I couldnt do it,? the 53-year-old Italian told Radio Nou. ?I accept complete responsibility because the team is a reflection of the character of the coach and this time I couldn?t achieve that.?

 Ranieri was fired after his side?s shock elimination from the Uefa Cup by Steaua Bucharest on Thursday, when they let slip a 2-0 first-leg lead and lost on penalties. He was already under pressure because of Valencias poor form in the Primera Liga after a six-game winless run had dropped them to sixth place in the 20-team standings. 

 Yokohama: Tokyo Verdy overcame Japanese champions Yokohama F-Marinos 5-4 in a penalty shoot-out to win the J-League Super Cup for a third time on Saturday.

 Yokohama had been seconds away from breaking their jinx in the annual season curtain raiser but Brazilian striker Washington snatched a stoppage-time equaliser for Verdy to level the score at 2-2.

 New signing Washington?s second goal sent the match directly to penalties under competition rules and Emperor?s Cup holders Verdy converted all five of their spot kicks. 

 Milan: Italy?s government has approved an 80 million-euro ($106.1 million) funding boost for the cash-strapped 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, a spokesman for the organisers said on Friday.

 A decree authorising the cash transfer was the first contribution by the government since it told the International Olympic Committee (IOC) earlier this month that it would make up a 170 million euros shortfall in the budget for the Games.

 With less than a year to go before the start of the Winter Olympics, a lack of expected sponsorship deals has left the budget shortfall. 

 New Delhi: Indias Ashok Kumar came up with a superb seven-under-par 65 to jump into second spot behind favourite Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand after three rounds in the Myanmar Open in Yangon on Saturday.

 Kumar recorded a three-day total of eight-under-par 208 to trail the title favourite by two shots at the Yangon Golf Club. He had ended the first day with a score of 75 before improving with a 68 in the second round, according to information received here.

 Among other Indians, Arjun Singh was sharing the fifth spot with a total of 211 after recording scores of 71, 70 and 70 in the three rounds. Mukesh Kumar (70, 71, 74) was in joint 14th place with a total of 215. 

 Indore: Judokas from six countries, including Pakistan 1ill be seen in action in the two-day South Asian judo meet beginning here on Sunday.

 ?Six teams including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, besides India will take part in the championship,? Judo Union of Asia (JUA) president Yoshinori Takeuchi said on Saturday.

 SA involve Jonty Rhodes 

Durban: The South African cricket team has called on former Test cricketer Jonty Rhodes to help them improve their fielding in preparation for the tour to India later this month. 

Rhodes expressed his willingness to help out the side whenever they needed. 

I am only too willing to help out whenever the boys need my advice, he said, while joking and passing on tips to the team.

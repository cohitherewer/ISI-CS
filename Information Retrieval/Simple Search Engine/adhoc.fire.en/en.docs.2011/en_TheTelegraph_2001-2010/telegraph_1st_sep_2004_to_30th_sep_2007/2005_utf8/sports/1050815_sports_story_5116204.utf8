Helsinki: Briton Paula Radcliffe ended her long wait for a first global gold by winning the world marathon title on the streets of the Finnish capital on Sunday. 

The 31-year-old world record holder put her Athens Olympics disappointment behind her, when she failed to finish the marathon and 10,000 metres, to win in a championship record of two hours, 20 minutes and 57 seconds. 

This was for me, said Radcliffe. It was important for me to win this title because I knew I was capable of doing it and my team knew that too. I knew I was in good shape. 

The Englishwoman, cheered on by a vociferous British contingent in a near-empty Olympic stadium, raised her arms in triumph at the finish before embracing husband Gary Lough. 

Radcliffe, whose winning time was over five minutes slower than the world record she set in London in 2003, then sportingly clapped silver medallist Catherine Ndereba home.

Ndereba clocked 2:22:01 and Romanias Constantina Tomescu (2:23:19) won the bronze after battling it out with Radcliffe through the middle stages. 

Meanwhile, Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba followed in the footsteps of her celebrated male predecessor Miruts Yifter by completing a global 5,000-10,000 double (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Dibaba prevailed in a sprint finish with Olympic champion Meseret Defar to lead three teammates across the line in the womens 5,000 final on the penultimate day of the championships. 

She is now the only person to win the double at a world championships, succeeding where her male compatriots Haile Gebrselassie and Kenenisa Bekele have failed. Yifter, who won both races at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, was the last person to win the double at a global championships. 

Dibaba clocked a championship record 14 minutes 38.59 seconds with Defar taking the silver. Her elder sister Ejegayehu, third in the 10,000 last Saturday, collected another bronze and Meselech Melkamu was fourth. 

Justin Gatlin led an American quartet across the line in Thursdays mens 200 metres final, the only other time one country has supplied the top four at the world championships. 

Ethiopia now possess three distance titles from the worlds after Bekele retained the mens 10,000 crown last Sunday. At the end of competition on Saturday they were third in the medals table behind the might of Russia and the United States. 

Moroccos Jaouad Gharib became the second athlete to retain the marathon title at the World Championships on Saturday morning. Spains Abel Anton is the only previous person to win consecutive gold medals. 

Gharib made his move shortly after 25 km of the 42.195-km race to win in two hours 10 minutes 11 seconds.

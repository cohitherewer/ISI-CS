 Breathing problem forces Sharapova out 

Paris: Russia?s Maria Sharapova pulled out of the Paris Open on Wednesday citing breathing problems, organisers said. 

The Wimbledon champion, who was seeded third, was to meet France?s Tatiana Golovin in the second round. She was replaced by Croatia?s Sanda Mamic. 

?I fell ill during the trip from Tokyo to Paris,? said Sharapova, winner in Japan last week. ?My throat hurts, I have breathing problems and I?m not 100 percent fit.?

 Trescothick century in Englands 10-wkt win 

London: Marcus Trescothick clattered a 76-ball century in his 100th one-day International as England annihilated Bangladesh by 10 wickets at The Oval on Thursday. 

The opening game in a triangular series, also involving Australia, always smacked of mismatch but Trescothick, who ended 100 not out for his ninth one-day ton, and Andrew Strauss turned it into a nonsense as the home team won with 25.1 overs left. 

Trescothick, who also struck two big centuries in two innings in the whitewashed Test series against Bangladesh, hit 16 fours as the home side won a one-dayer by 10 wickets for only the second time in 414 matches. 

England were set to chase 191 to win after paceman Steve Harmison took four for 39 and seamer Jon Lewis three for 32. 

The opening innings lasted 45.2 overs and could have ended earlier still but for Aftab Ahmed, who made 51 and put on 76 for the seventh wicket with Mohammad Rafique (30).

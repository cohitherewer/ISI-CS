 A look into the world that Rooney left

 - Exclusion is not the answer in Croxteth?s streets 

 PAUL HAYWARD 

Croxteth (Liverpool): At Bargain Booze the bottles are all behind partitions of the sort that protect cab drivers from violent passengers. You walk into the glass cage and shout for your cans of beer or your ? 8.99 bottle of whisky. Next door, the Treetops day nursery is defended by a spiked metal fence and coils of barbed wire. 

On the street outside, a portable toilet has been turned upside down, and lads with hoods pulled over their heads climb over walls or stare at you from shop doorways, many of which are boarded up with security grilles. There are two betting shops, the Britannia kebab outlet and a sign that says, mysteriously, ?Pat A Dog ? Around This corner?. The Sefton Arms opposite the school is a Tetley?s pub, though the letters say ETLEY?S ? because the ?T? has fallen off, or been pinched. 

The Queen of Martyrs Parish Centre is fortified by formidable steel stars embedded in the walls. The echoes here are of Northern Ireland, where so many public buildings look like compounds waiting for the next attack. Few activities can turn the children of Croxteth into global figures and multi-millionaires, but football is one of them. 

This is Wayne?s world. Or the world he left behind, anyway. Where Wayne Rooney went to school in Croxteth, in the suburbs of Liverpool, the teachers doubtless struggle daily against poverty and petty crime. 

Plainly, it?s not part of their mission to turn children from disadvantaged backgrounds into pariahs, as the English Schools Football Association did this week by dropping Rooney from a children?s tournament on the grounds that he?s an unsuitable role model. 

There are so few people in football taking a stand against obnoxious conduct that one hesitates to come down too heavily on John Read, the ESFA?s chief executive, who justified his decision by saying: ?We felt under the circumstances that we could find a better role model.? 

But this unfeeling, muddled gesture sends the wrong message. 

It tells Rooney that the world of education looks down on him, and doesn?t believe that exposure to other young lives might make him think more clearly about his behaviour on and off the pitch. It does what educators are supposed never to do: it excludes a young ?sinner? by erecting a wall between him and his contemporaries. To the children who have missed out on the chance to be coached or encouraged by Croxteth?s most famous son, it says that Rooney is somehow unworthy of their time, and can be watched in England colours but not admired. 

Given the burgeoning rate of childhood obesity, English schoolboy football could also find a ?better? sponsor for their Under-13s National Cup in Middlesbrough than Coca-Cola, who tend to circumvent the objections of health experts by shelling out a lot of money. But for now we?ll let that go. 

As I drove around Rooney?s schoolboy patch Tuesday, there was a temptation to ask children of the Our Lady and St Swithin?s Roman Catholic Primary School and the De La Salle Secondary whether they considered Rooney a decent ?role model?, despite his prolific swearing on the pitch, his allegedly violent disagreements with his girlfriend and his earlier wanderings through Merseyside?s red light zone. 

A resounding ?yes? would have been the probable answer ? especially among the kids booting a ball around in the playground of Rooney?s old primary school, next to which is a disused Catholic church, St Swithin?s, where even the surveillance cameras have their own security: wire cages to protect them from vandalism and theft. These scenes can be found a five-minute drive from Goodison Park, where the best young striker in Europe signed schoolboy forms, and a similar distance from Anfield, where hundreds of millions of pounds worth of talent clashed in Tuesday?s Liverpool-Chelsea Champions League semi-final, watched, of course, by the billionaire Roman Abramovich. 

Rooney?s escape from Croxteth ? if it can be called that without patronising the inhabitants ? began with that five-minute, mile and-a-half journey. He may not be a role model to the headmasterly types at the English Schools FA, but you can bet your life he inspires his fellow teenagers at De La Salle. Even the hardcore Evertonians who resent his defection to Manchester United probably can?t help regarding him as a pathfinder who has proved that a modest beginning need not lead to a thwarted life. 

A more compassionate and constructive course would?ve been to get behind Rooney?s involvement in Middlesbrough and hope his presence among some of country?s best under-13s might prompt him to think more deeply about the effect his actions have on young audiences. 

To punish him by exclusion is to follow the Victorian principle of forcing an offender into isolation in the hope he sees the error of his ways. All it will do to Rooney is increase his mistrust of the establishment, and perhaps prompt him to ask why the English game is so happy to sell shirts with his name on while treating him like a pariah who needs to be kept away from ?respectable? kids. 

To demonise Rooney in this context is deeply sad. It belittles him and sends him back to the streets around De La Salle, where even the buses have a combative streak. In Liverpool city centre Tuesday afternoon, a bus went steaming across traffic and smashed a car on an intersection. It was the 5C to Croxteth.

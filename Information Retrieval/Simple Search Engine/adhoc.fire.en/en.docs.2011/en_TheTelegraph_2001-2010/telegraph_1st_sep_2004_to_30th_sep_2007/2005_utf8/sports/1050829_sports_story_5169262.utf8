 Ricky Ponting faces disciplinary hearing

 Ricky Ponting walks back after being run out on Saturday 

Nottingham: Australia captain Ricky Ponting faces a disciplinary hearing after venting his frustration at being run out by one of Englands substitute fielders late on Day III. 

Ponting, who scored a match-saving hundred in the drawn third Test at Old Trafford, was on 48 when he was run out by 23-year-old Gary Pratt on Saturday. 

Damien Martyn called for a single after pushing an Andrew Flintoff ball into the covers, where Pratt swooped and threw down the stumps at the strikers end with Ponting short of his crease. 

Ponting stormed off the field, making comments to the England players. Umpires Steve Bucknor and Aleem Dar referred the matter to Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, who will hold a hearing after stumps on Sunday, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said. 

Australia was forced to follow-on at Trent Bridge after being dismissed for 218 in reply to Englands first innings of 477. Australia resumed at 222 for four in its second innings, still 37 runs behind. Pratt was on the field for Simon Jones, who bowled only four overs in the second innings before being taken to hospital for tests on his injured right ankle. 

Pratt wasnt in Englands 12-man squad, but was drafted in as a specialist fielder from county side Durham. The substitution of Pratt for Jones in the field was cleared by the umpires, meaning Ponting had no right to challenge it.

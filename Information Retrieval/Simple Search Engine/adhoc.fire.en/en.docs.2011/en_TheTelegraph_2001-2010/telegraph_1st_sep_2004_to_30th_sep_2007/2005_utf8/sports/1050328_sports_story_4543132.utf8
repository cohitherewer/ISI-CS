The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal, Ghei, Kapur joint 19th

Jakarta: Thailand?s Thaworn Wiratchant romped to a sensational five-stroke victory Sunday in the $1 million Indonesian Open golf tournament where the Indians in fray finished way down the leaderboard. 

Arjun Atwal, who had a fine start to the event, Gaurav Ghei and Shiv Kapur all finished joint 19th with identical scores of 12-under-par 268 in the competition, which was won by Wiratchant after shooting a final round of seven-under-par 63. 

Two other Indians Harmeet Kahlon and Amandeep Johl finished tied 31st and tied 63 rd, respectively. 

On an amazing final day at the par-70 Cengkareng Golf Club which produced some glorious golf, the Thai with the unorthodox swing triumphed in style with a four-day score of 25-under-par 255, the lowest 72-hole total on both the Asian Tour and European Tour. 

Thaworn?s success, worth $166,660, will go down in the history books along with several other wonderful achievements. It was his fifth Asian Tour title and first on the European Tour. 

Frenchman Raphael Jacquelin, who got to within one stroke of Thaworn on the 11th hole, settled for his career?s fourth second-place finish after a closing 65 for a 260 total while Australian Adam Fraser sank a magical hole-in-one en route to a 62 for third place, a further stroke back. 

?Winning a co-sanctioned event has been on my mind. I?ve been trying for a while and my dream has now become a reality,? said Thaworn, who joins Thongchai Jaidee as the only Thai winners on the European Tour. (PTI)

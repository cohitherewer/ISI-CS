Lahore: Rampant Pakistan, spearheaded by fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, won the third and final Test against England by an innings and 100 runs on Saturday to take the series 2-0. 

The fiery Shoaib, with five wickets and leg spinner Danish Kaneria with four, including three wickets in five balls after lunch, combined to crush Englands final-day resistance. The visitors were all out for 248 after the last eight wickets fell for 43. 

Ian Bell (92) and Paul Collingwood (80) had looked to be steadying Englands second innings with a third-wicket stand of 175 until Collingwood became the first of Kanerias victims, caught by Hasan Raza in the first over after lunch. 

Kevin Pietersen followed, caught by Raza for one, and Andrew Flintoff was bowled in the first ball with a well-disguised googly. 

Kaneria came close to a hattrick when he again deceived Geraint Jones with a googly but umpire Darrell Hair turned down the big shout. 

Shoaib, who had removed Marcus Trescothick (nought) and Michael Vaughan (13) on the fourth day, then got into the act. 

He trapped Bell leg before with a slower ball after he had faced 189 balls and hit 13 fours. Englands hopes of a face-saving draw faded with Bells departure. 

Jones (five) was unlucky to be given out leg before to Shoaib when television replays showed that he had got a big inside edge. 

Liam Plunkett was out leg before to another Shoaib slower ball. 

Shaun Udal, who had delayed the inevitable with a stubborn 25 runs off 34 balls, finally fell to Mohammad Sami ? caught by Salman Butt at slip ? and Kaneria bowled Matthew Hoggard in the next over to give Pakistan their first home series win since October 2003. 

Pakistan, who won the first Test in Multan and drew the second in Faisalabad, had bowled out England for 288 in their first innings, and then piled on the runs to declare on Friday at 636 for eight. 

Inzamam, named Man of the Series, led by example, passing 8,000 Test runs during his innings of 97 on Friday. He also scored centuries in each innings in Faisalabad. 

Shoaib finished the innings with figures of five for 71 for a series total of 17 on good batting wickets. Kaneria, four for 52, enhanced his growing reputation as a leg spinner with a series tally of 11 wickets

Ostrava (Czech Republic): Jamaicas Asafa Powell sent a message to his rivals across the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, running the 100 metres in a blazing 9.85 seconds at the IAAF Golden Spike Grand Prix meet. 

In his first race of the season on the European circuit, Powell blew away the competition to run the second fastest time of the year despite unseasonably cold and rainy conditions. He was slightly helped by a 0.6-metre per second wind at his back. 

Powells time was just one one-hundredth of a second slower than the 9.84 he clocked on May 7, the fastest official time this year. 

Only Americans Tim Montgomery and Maurice Greene have run faster than Powell and the Jamaican feels it may not be long before he races past them as well. 

Im very surprised I ran so fast under such bad conditions. I didnt expect the race would be so fast. My goal is to get the gold medal at the world championships. And the record? Well see, the soft-spoken runner said after becoming the first man ever to break the 10 second mark in the Czech Republic. 

Nigerias Olusoji Fasuba was second in a time of 10.17, followed by Jamaican Michael Frater in 10.20 seconds. 

Olympic 400 metres champion Jeremy Wariner, who has targeted fellow American Michael Johnsons world record of 43.18 seconds, won his event in a time of 45.58 seconds, well behind his 44.53 posted in May, the fastest 400 in the world this year. 

Russian world champion and double Olympic bronze medallist Sergey Makarov won the javelin with a throw of 88.84 metres, the longest in the event this season. 

Bulgarias Ivet Lalova posted a time of 11.03 seconds in the womens 100m, tying the second fastest time in 2005. 

The mens 5000m was won by Kenyas Sammy Kipketer in 13:19.46. Making it a 1-2 for Kenya was Sigei Kipngetich in 13:21.01, while Bahrains Mushir Salim Jawher took third place in 13:21.63.

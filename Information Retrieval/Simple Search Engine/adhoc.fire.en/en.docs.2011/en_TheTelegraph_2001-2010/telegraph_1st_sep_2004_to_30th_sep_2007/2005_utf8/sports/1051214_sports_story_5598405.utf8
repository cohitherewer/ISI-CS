 Gambhir place in jeopardy

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: Virender Sehwag has declared himself fit for the third Test against Sri Lanka, starting in Ahmedabad from Sunday, but his availability may mean an unsavoury situation for his opening partner Gautam Gambhir. 

Confirming that they have received the fitness certificate from Sehwag on Tuesday, two of the selectors, however, made it a point that performance of Gambhir ? who made 2 and 3 in the ongoing Test at the Kotla ? is a serious concern to them. 

Yuvraj Singh further queered the pitch for Gambhir, by making his case stronger with a well-crafted unbeaten 77 on Tuesday. One selector didnt specify whether Gambhir would be retained for the third Test, but indicated that the likes of Wasim Jaffer and Dheeraj Jadhav might come up for discussion. 

The five selectors ? all have already reached the capital ? will pick the Ahmedabad-bound squad on Wednesday, after the match. 

Gambhir also failed in the lone innings during the rain-marred opening Test in Chennai. 

Incidentally, it was in Ahmedabad last month that Gambhir made a strong return to the One-day team with a scintillating hundred versus Sri Lanka.

 London: England?s Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher have signed new deals with Liverpool that will keep them at the club until 2009, the European champions said on Friday.

 Captain and midfielder Gerrard, who only last week looked on the verge of leaving the club for Chelsea, and central defender Carragher signed extensions to their existing contracts, Liverpool said on their official website. 

 ?It?s a massive weight off my mind,? Gerrard said. ?Over the last twelve months there has been a lot of speculation about my future and it hasn?t helped my football. 

 Madrid: Inter Milan have signed Argentina midfielder Santiago Solari from Real Madrid. Solari agreed a three-year contract with the Serie A side after passing a medical in Milan, said Real in a statement on Thursday.

 Spanish media said Solari, who agreed a new four-year deal with Real in January, would move for a nominal fee because a clause in his contract allowed him freedom to leave if he did not complete a set number of games with the Madrid club. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil striker Robinho, angry with his club Santos after they turned down an offer from Real Madrid, continued to boycott training with the Brazilian champions on Thursday. Robinho, one of Brazil?s most exciting new talents, has defied orders by Santos to rejoin their squad since returning from the Confederations Cup in Germany last Friday. 

 Santiago: Chile?s professional soccer players are to go on strike from next week in protest at unpaid wages, Footballers? Union (SIFUP) officials said Thursday.

 The union says the clubs owe their members a total of around $1 million in outstanding wages. ?I can say with certainty that there will not be any football on the next weekend (July 16 and 17),? SIFUP president Carlos Soto said. 

 Athens: Greece on Friday invited bidders to submit offers for the use of three of its Olympic Games venues in the capital, nearly a year after Athens hosted the Games.

 Since the Olympic Games last August, almost none of the 36 purpose-built stadiums, which cost more than 3 billion euros ($3.61 billion), have been used.

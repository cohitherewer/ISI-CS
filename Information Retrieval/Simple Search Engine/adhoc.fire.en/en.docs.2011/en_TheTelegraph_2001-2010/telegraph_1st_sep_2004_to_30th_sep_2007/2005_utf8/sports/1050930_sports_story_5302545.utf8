 Love letters to wrong Alonso

 Fernando Alonsos namesake has been getting letters from eager women 

London: A quiet bachelor who does not drive is being inundated with love letters because his name is Fernando Alonso and he lives in the same town as the newly-crowned Formula One champion. 

A British tabloid reported on Thursday that the 27-year-old publisher, who comes from northern Spain like the Renault driver and also lives in Oxford, has been getting letters from women eager to meet him. 

They say things like I want to get to know you and you are a great driver, which is funny as I dont have a car, he told the newspaper. 

When I got the first letter I soon realised it was not meant for me. She said she loved me. It was from a girl called Astra from Holland. She asked me to ring her. 

Alonso, 24, became Formula Ones youngest champion at the weekend after finishing third in the Brazilian Grand Prix to take an unassailable lead in the standings. Now he is getting more and more famous, I think I will start getting more and more letters, said the bicycle-riding publisher.

 Serena eyeing a third crown

 - Williams sisters battle decline and fall 

 Serena sees herself winning at the All England Club again, while Venus has shown sparks of renewed enthusiasm 

London: Until last year the Williams sisters ruled 21st century Wimbledon unopposed, their modern brand of womens power tennis crushing all before them. 

The London Grand Slams fast grass suited the Americans uncompromising style. They could serve and volley opponents off the court. 

The womens game has caught up since, however, and after Serenas shock defeat by then 17-year-old Russian Maria Sharapova in the 2004 final, a whole raft of upstarts fancy their chances against the sisters. Many even feel their time is up. 

The theory is that injuries, weariness of the tour, outside interests as well as an ever growing army of eastern European teenage talent are making dents so deep in their reputations, that the damage is beyond repair. 

Venus Williams made her Wimbledon debut in 1997, having just turned 17, and won over the All England Clubs traditionalists with her grace and enthusiasm on court, her disarming smile and her innovative choice of sportswear. 

Beaded hair flying, the taller and slenderer of the Williams sisters covered the courts in giant steps, looking sharper and more athletic than any player before. 

She won the title in 2000 and 2001, beating first Lindsay Davenport and then an emerging Justine Henin in the finals. She then handed her mantle to Serena, 15 months her junior, losing to her sister in the 2002 and 2003 finals. 

While Venus star faded Serena shone and the younger sibling went on to win seven Grand Slam titles, the last in Australia in January, eclipsing her sisters four. 

The Australian Open win was that much sweeter because people are always wondering whats happening to us. Its nothing. Were just working really hard, said Serena. 

Her win in Melbourne was her seventh Grand Slam victory ? she now stands equal eighth on the all-time list of winners alongside Evonne Goolagong-Cawley and Maria Bueno. 

Venus appeared to have lost some of her hunger and went down in the second round last year to Croatian Karolina Sprem in a controversial match marred by a wrong call from the umpire. 

Though a lowly 16th in the rankings now and seeded 14 at next weeks Championships, Venus has shown sparks of renewed enthusiasm this season, however, beating her sister for the first time in more than three years in Miami in March, then winning her first tournament for a year in Istanbul last month. 

The sisters have suffered family trauma over the last two years with the murder of an older sister and the break-up of their parents marriage 

They have also suffered injuries. Serena had a long lay-off and knee surgery after her Wimbledon triumph in 2003 but looked resurgent this year. 

She was going well until she twisted her ankle at Amelia Island in April which forced her out of most of the clay court season including Roland Garros, so she is short of match practice. 

The pair has stuck to their Wimbledon warm-up routine, however, avoiding competition and practising in peace. Serena said match toughness would not be a problem. 

Ive been playing a long time and I know what I need to do to win, she said in a telephone conference on Thursday. Im here. Im healthy and Ill do the best I can. I feel good and if Im not ready now then more than likely Ill never be ready. 

The sisters are in the same quarter of the draw for the tournament, which starts on Monday, and could face each other in the fourth round. 

Serena, seeded four, meets 103rd ranked compatriot Angela Haynes in what should prove a gentle first-round workout. Venus is up against a qualifier, but her opponent will have the advantage of having earned her grass legs after going several rounds on the lawns in nearby Roehampton. 

If all goes to plan, Serena will meet last years nemesis Sharapova, seeded two, in the semi-finals but only if she can overcome French Open champion Henin-Hardenne in the quarter-finals. 

The Russian and the Belgian will be anxious to prove that last year was not a blip but signalled an end to the Williams Wimbledon hegemony. 

Serena said she had been making some changes to her game, working on aspects she could improve and knuckling down hard. Her aim is a third title. 

It would definitely be awesome, she said. I see myself doing it. (AGENCIES)

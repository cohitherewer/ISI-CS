 Shoaib hurt by Akram, Waqar criticism 

 Shoaib is optimistic about Pak?s chances in India 

Islamabad: Under-fire speedster Shoaib Akhtar has lashed out at former captains Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis for making him a scapegoat whenever things go wrong, but being generous in their praise of Irfan Pathan. 

?I respect Wasim very much, he was a great bowler but his comment that I am no longer a matchwinner has really hurt me. I would say that he should keep his views to himself,? Shoaib said here Monday. 

?If you pick up the records when Wasim was the captain, you would know who was taking most of the wickets,? said Shoaib, who has been under attack recently for his frequent breakdowns and off-the-field conduct. 

?I have been made the scapegoat whenever something goes wrong.? 

Shoaib said he was surprised that while Akram and Waqar were so generous in their praise of Pathan, they did not support and encourage their own countrymen. 

The bowler was also optimistic about beating India during the forthcoming tour. 

?It is going to be tough but I think we can win there. Our team is inconsistent, a lot would depend on how the seniors fare. I don?t think they?ll make fast wickets in India.? 

He dismissed as trash recent pictures showing him flanked by girls in a nightclub and termed it as an attempt by that lobby to degrade him. 

Asked whether he was vying for the captain?s slot, Shoaib said it was a matter that should be left to the PCB. 

On the criticism about frequent breakdowns, he said it is normal for pacers to get injured because too much cricket is played these days. ?Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and others all suffer injuries.? (PTI)

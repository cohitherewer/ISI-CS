The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand honoured for fourth time

 - CHESS OSCAR 

New Delhi: Viswanathan Anand became the undisputed top-rated player of the world as he won the coveted chess Oscar for the second time in a row and the fourth time in his career. 

For Anand, 35, the only non-Russian to achieve the feat, this is the second double as he had earlier also successively claimed the honour in 1997 and 1998. 

The Indian, who has 5205 points, will be presented with the bronze statuette of ?The Fascinated Wanderer? by the 64 magazine. 

?It is always an honour to be acknowledged for your performance. In chess, winning an Oscar means the pundits have acclaimed your success. In 2004, I played the best and I silenced the classical chess critics by also winning all the classical events I played in,? Anand was quoted as saying in a statement. 

The Indian ace was in the top 10 list of each of the 445 chess experts, including 74 GMs from 75 countries. 

??The Tiger from Madras? has a unique collection of the first places at various tournaments in classical and rapid chess. Anand was certainly a leader of the Indian team at the Olympiad in Spain. In general, his present victory, as well as the previous ones, is undisputed,? the oscar.Fide website said. 

Garri Kasparov of Russia is the only other player 

to have achieved the same in 1995-96 and 2001-02. Kasparov and Anand together 

have received 9 of 10 Oscars from 64 magazine. Vladimir Kramnik won the Oscar 

in 2000.

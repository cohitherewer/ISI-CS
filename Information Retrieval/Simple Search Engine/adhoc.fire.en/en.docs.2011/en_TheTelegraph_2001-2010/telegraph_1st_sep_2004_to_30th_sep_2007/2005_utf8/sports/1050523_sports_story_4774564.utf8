 Late bogeys sink Arjun

Manila: Two late bogeys robbed Arjun Singh a chance of registering his second straight top-10 finish, as he ended up tied 18th in the $200,000 Philippines Open at the par-71 Malayarat Golf and Country Club. 

Arjun, tied eighth at previous weeks Macau Open, carded an even par 71 and a total of one-over 285 following bogeys on the 15th and 16th holes. 

But for the two bogeys, Arjun would have ended in a tie for sixth with five other players.

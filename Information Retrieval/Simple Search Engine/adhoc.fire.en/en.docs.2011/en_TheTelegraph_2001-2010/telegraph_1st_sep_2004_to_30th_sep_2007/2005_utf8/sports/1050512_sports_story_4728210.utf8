 Woolmer sets conditions for Shoaibs comeback

Karachi: A day after Shoaib Akhtar demanded an explanation from the cricket authorities for his ouster, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer today spelt out the conditions for the fast bowler to make a comeback into the national team. 

The selectors have said it quite categorically that he has to get fit and should bowl 25-25 overs in both the innings of a five-day game, Woolmer said at the airport here shortly before his departure to Dubai on way to Antigua where Pakistan opens its tour of the West Indies with a one-day practice match on May 15. 

(After he achieves that) obviously we will be very happy to have him back, said Woolmer. 

Shoaib was called halfway through the Australian tour with a hamstring injury that forced him to pull out of the tour of India later. 

Shoaib, 29, played in two 50-over-a-side and three Twenty20 Cup matches in the domestic circuit but has yet to make an appearance in the longer version of the game. 

However, Shoaibs exclusion has become a mystery in world cricket as the Pakistan Cricket Board and the team management have come up with contradictory statements. 

Shoaib, who is one of the Pakistan cricketers in the ICC probables list for Octobers Super Test and one-day series against Australia, expressed his anger and frustration demanding an explanation for his exclusion. 

Woolmer also contradicted the statement of skipper Inzamam-ul haq who had told reporters that if Shoaib regains fitness, he could be called up for the Test matches in the Carribbean. 

I cant see that possibility because it is a very short tour, the Pakistan coach said. 

Woolmer said Inzamams suspension from the Barbados Test can tempt the team management to award Test cap to young Bazid Khan whose grandfather Jahangir Khan played Tests for India while his father Majid Khan and two uncles Javed Burki and Imran Khan captained Pakistan. 

Obviously Inzamam is a fine player and he has been captaining very well. So, its not an ideal situation. However, it is an opportunity for young Bazid Khan to show his mettle and for Younis Khan to know how to handle things in Test matches. 

We cant under-estimate the West Indies because it is a very short tour. We have to hit the ground running and have to make sure that we are on top of every ball, Woolmer said. 

We cant live on that performance in India. It is history now and we have to move forward. We have to work at every aspect of our cricket and improve, he said.

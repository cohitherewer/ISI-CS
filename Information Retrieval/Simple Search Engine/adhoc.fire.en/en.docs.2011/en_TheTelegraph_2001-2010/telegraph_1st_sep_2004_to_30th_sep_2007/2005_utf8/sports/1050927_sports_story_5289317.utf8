 Itll be a challenge for Australia: Hohns

Lahore: Winning the 2007 World Cup will be a challenge for Australia as they start to rebuild the side after their Ashes defeat to England, Australian chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said on Monday. 

Hohns is currently touring Pakistan with Australia A to spot future talents in the aftermath of Australias first Test series loss to their arch rivals in 18 years. I suppose winning the World Cup is a challenge now, Hohns, who played seven Tests for Australia in the late 1980s, said. 

We won the last two Cups, so it would be nice to win three in a row and we consider the timing is right to start juggling our side, he added. 

Last week, Ashes flops Damien Martyn, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz were axed from the Super Series Test squad against the World XI. 

Gillespie, Kasprowicz and opener Matthew Hayden were also dropped from the one-day side. But Hohns, 51, denied that Australia were on the road to decline. I dont agree. We have been beaten by England, who are a very, very good side which Pakistan will see very soon, said Hohns. 

The future of Australian cricket is very strong. We may not win all the time, sooner or later we had to lose because others are trying to come up to our level, said Hohns. (AFP)

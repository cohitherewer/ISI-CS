Calcutta: Top seed Irina Brar of Chandigarh reached the final of the 88th all-India Visa ladies? golf championship at the Tollygunge Club on Friday. In a keenly contested semi-final, Brar beat Neha Majithia on the 17th hole. 

The other semi-final produced an engrossing battle between two teenagers. Bangalore?s Sharmila Nicolet (13) was up against Delhi girl Vaishavi Sinha (14). There was very little to choose between the two and it was Sinha who won the play-off on the 21st hole. 

Battling it out for the Vikramaditya Cup will be Saroj Saran and Sonia Barman. On Friday, Saran beat Rita Punwani on the 17th hole while Barman overcame Tara Halwasiya on the 16th. In the DT Salver Trophy, Rashmee Singh will face Rita Dogra in the final.

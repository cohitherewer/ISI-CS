 Prakash to ride despite fall 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Mystical, a runaway winner in both his previous two starts, is set to chalk up another win when the S. Ganapathy-ward takes on seven three-year-olds for the rich 1,600m Usha Stud Bangalore Summer Million, the main attraction here on Sunday.

 The Alnasr Alwasheek-Mystic Memory gelding is in the pink of condition and going by his last two wins, the MAM Ramaswamy-property, to be ridden by B. Prakash, will take some stopping. The focus of attention, in fact, will be the fight for minor placings between Galloping Bay, Fedora and Risada

 Our Turf Correspondent adds: Jockey Prakash, who had a fall from Sweet Angel in the last race on Saturday, the division II of the Col Rajkumar C. Desraj Urs Memorial Cup, escaped unhurt. Trainer S. Ganapathy when contacted over his cellphone said: Prakash is perfectly fine. He will fulfil his engagements on Sunday.

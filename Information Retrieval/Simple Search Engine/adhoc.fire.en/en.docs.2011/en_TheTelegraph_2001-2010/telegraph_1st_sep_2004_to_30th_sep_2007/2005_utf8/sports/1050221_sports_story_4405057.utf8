Akram pins hopes on ?exciting? spin duo

- Ex-captain welcomes Shoaib Akhtars brave decision to withdraw

 Arshad Khan 

Karachi: Legendary left-arm seamer Wasim Akram is pinning his hopes on the ?exciting? Pakistani spin duo of Danish Kaneria and Arshad Khan to trouble the prolific Indian batsmen in the forthcoming series. 

Akram said the two spinners would play an important role in ensuring Pakistan ?stay in all five days? of the three Test matches that the two teams are slated to play. 

?It is an exciting spin combination. To stay in all five days of a Test in India, you need spinners who can take wickets and contain the batsmen. I think this combination has the class and variety to do that,? Akram told reporters here on Sunday. 

Akram was the last captain to lead Pakistan in a Test series in India when his side played three matches in 1999. Skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, Yousuf Youhana and Shahid Afridi are the only surviving members from that tour on which Pakistan won in Chennai and Calcutta while losing in New Delhi, thanks to a perfect 10 by Anil Kumble. 

The 34-year-old Arshad was on Saturday recalled to the Pakistan team after nearly five years in wilderness. He last played his eighth Test against England in November 2000. Kaneria, a wrist spinner, has played 23 Tests in which he has bagged little over 100 wickets. 

?Kaneria is probably the most improved spinner in the world whereas I am pleased with the return of Arshad Khan. I am sure the lanky Pathan must have matured since he last played nearly five years ago,? remarked the former captain, who came here for a commercial shoot. 

?Arshad is not afraid of giving the ball air and I 

have been told that he is bowling a good doosra. He has a big role to play 

in India because I think the wickets there will suit his type of bowling,? Akram 

said. 

?I think the selectors have done the right thing to recall Arshad. I am expecting that the combination of experience and youth will create problems for the Indians,? said the bowler, who took 414 Test and 502 one-day wickets in an illustrious 17-year career. 

?I am not saying it?s going to be easy for the two. But in the presence of Kaneria and Arshad, Pakistan will remain all five days in the Tests,? the 39-year-old stated. 

Akram believed that the forthcoming series would be well-fought. ?I know that the Indians have a strong and matured batting and also a balanced bowling attack. But the way the Pakistan team fought back in the tri-series in Australia and that too without Shoaib Akhtar, it is commendable. 

 Danish Kaneria 

?Pakistan was a feared team in the ?90s because it had tremendous skills to stage a fightback when the chips were down. I saw the same zeal and determination in the tri-series because don?t forget, they had entered the competition after being literally thrashed in the Test series,? said Akram. 

 Akram, who led Pakistan in 25 Tests between 1993 and 2000 in four stints, also welcomed Shoaib?s ?brave? decision to withdraw from the series, saying an unfit Shoaib would have been a liability on the team. 

?I think he has made the right decision. A half-fit Shoaib would have become a liability on the team. Besides his own performance would have been affected badly. 

?I believe he was mentally also disturbed knowing that he was not fit. And now that he has made a brave decision which, of course, must not have been easy, I am confident that he will now concentrate on his fitness and would join the squad when he is convinced he has regained complete fitness.?

 Cracks appearing in Australian empire 

 under Ponting

 Guest Column 

 Michael Atherton

 Consider these words: Although 

 still relying heavily on pace they did not strike fear into 

 the opposition... while their batting overall did not have 

 the depth of old. They seemed to be on a slow downward curve, 

 while ours was continuing to slope upwards. It was purely 

 a question of whether the two lines had yet crossed.

 Now change the tense to the present 

 and they could be words uttered by any England player about 

 Australia before events at Durham dished up a disturbing 

 dose of reality. 

 In fact, the words are Shane Warnes 

 (page 75 of his autobiography) looking back at Australias 

 tour of the West Indies a decade ago. It was on that tour 

 that a vibrant Australian team toppled a side who had been 

 world champions for over a decade. It brought the curtain 

 down on one era and heralded the start of another. 

 Clearly, and especially since 

 their resuscitating victory on Thursday in Durham, it is 

 too early to call time on the Australian empire, but the 

 cracks in the monolith have started to appear. The obvious 

 question is whether Englands upward curve and Australias 

 apparent downward curve are on collision course. In 1995, 

 the West Indies were captained by Richie Richardson, who 

 had taken over from Viv Richards. Teams often exhibit the 

 characteristics of their leaders and there is no doubt that 

 was the case with the West Indies. Richards team, 

 like the man himself, was brooding, intense and fearsome. 

 Richardson was more laidback and so were his players. 

 On what we have seen so far the 

 same could be said of Pontings Australians. Both in 

 body language and tactics, the intensity and aggression 

 that we came to expect under Steve Waugh has been largely 

 missing this summer under Ponting. 

 At Bristol, Ponting was curiously 

 conservative in his field settings. Even at Durham there 

 was a reluctance to attack Englands tailenders to 

 close out the game. 

 Contrast that with 2001 when Waughs 

 ultra-aggressive tactics in the one-day series put England 

 on the backfoot for the rest of the summer. Pontings 

 Australians seem to be quieter, too. 

 Warne remains the most competitive 

 Aussie cricketer

 Dav Whatmore commented on their 

 lack of intensity after his team had humbled Australia ? 

 although it must be said that defeat seems to have shocked 

 them into showing a little more of their old fire. Nevertheless, 

 it is hard to imagine Waugh lecturing his players on the 

 need to be winners and nice guys, as Ponting has done. 

 Like the West Indies of 1995, 

 this Australian team has players who are long in the tooth. 

 At the start of this tour, Ponting was asked about the age 

 profile of his team and he quipped that well, were 

 only two months older than the last time we played, and 

 it didnt seem much of a problem then. 

 Of their likely Test team, only 

 Brett Lee and Michael Clarke will be under 30 by the summers 

 end. Equally, only Warne and McGrath are at an age where 

 the doubts really set in. Ultimately desire, not age, is 

 the key. If a generalisation can be made I would say the 

 older a player gets, the less brightly the flame of desire 

 burns. There are obvious reasons for this: the need to prove 

 yourself diminishes; the advent of children and family life 

 puts the game into perspective so that it is no longer the 

 most important thing. For all but the most obsessive, maturity 

 brings with it a lessening of the competitive instincts. 

 Richards was an exception; a classic 

 case of a cricketer for whom the desire never dimmed. Every 

 time he pulled on a West Indies shirt there was a sense 

 that he was playing for a higher cause; that he was intent 

 on making a statement on behalf of his people. 

 The questions of age and desire 

 make Lee and Warne crucial figures in Australias team. 

 Lee will surely play his first Test for 18 months at Lords: 

 his youth, overt aggression and pace will spice up an attack 

 that looks bland without him. 

 Warnes fixation with his 

 hair, and his antics that continue to make the front pages, 

 suggest that he has never really grown up at all ? which 

 is probably why he remains the most competitive of cricketers 

 wearing the green and gold. It is his competitive instinct 

 as much as his leg-spin that Australia have missed during 

 this one-day series.

 Dislocated shoulder no bother for Sanath

 - Dravid-Chappell partnership begins with defeat; Laxman uncertain for todays match as well

Dambulla: It took time 

 for the hosts to put the India flag right at the picturesque 

 and blustery Rangiri International Stadium. Team Indias 

 repair job, though, took longer. 

Yet, bettering the average first innings score here (196) wasnt enough and Sri Lanka won the IndianOil Cup opener with much to spare: Three wickets and almost two overs in hand. 

Saturdays match wasnt anywhere close to a classic. Nobody, however, will forget veteran Sanath Jayasuriyas statement-making unbeaten 43 off 50 balls. 

He isnt quite the Smiling Assassin of the mid-Nineties, but still makes the opposition cry. Continues to collect MoM awards as well. 

Forced by a right shoulder dislocation (while fielding) to bat at No. 6, Jayasuriya used the experience of 334 one-day appearances to thwart India. As important, he nursed the less experienced. 

 Not too long ago, Jayasuriya told 

 The Telegraph nothing motivated him more than playing 

 for Sri Lanka. Perhaps, nothing gets him more charged 

 ? with or without pain-killers ? than the blue of the Indians. 

Requiring 206, Jayasuriyas winning-pull took Sri Lanka to 209 for seven on the second ball of the 48th over. 

We fell short of the target we would have liked to set... It was a 250-wicket... Having said that, the boys fought hard and I couldnt have asked for more on the field, observed Rahul Dravid, leading India for the first time with independent charge. 

Dravid and coach Greg Chappell (also making his debut) would have given their right arm for a different bottomline, but the chance to pull something back isnt far away. 

Given the tournaments schedule, India face the West Indies in less than 18 hours. Incidentally, the one-time masters of limited overs cricket have lost their last eight ODIs. 

Captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul, though, believes anything is possible and cited the West Indies Champions Trophy success last September as an example. 

V.V.S. Laxman, who got omitted owing to back spasms, is uncertain for match No. 2 too. 

To return to Saturdays face-off, fielding just four specialist bowlers when a Sachin Tendulkar isnt around proved disastrous. Not that the presence of seven batsmen (including Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who opened) made the expected difference. 

The powers-that-be probably need a reminder that Anil Kumble should feature in big matches ? the season-launcher certainly was one. 

Both Suresh Raina and Yalaka Venugopal Rao got capped after Laxmans non-availability and a rethink on Jai Prakash Yadavs comeback. The hosts XI was on expected lines. 

Raina, whose roots are in Kashmir, fell on the very first ball. However, he did make some impression by running out Maravan Atapattu with a direct hit. Venugopal looked organised. 

 The stand-out debutant, though, was Dilhara Lokuhettige 

 (two for 31 and 21 from 20 balls). Hes an allrounder 

 for the future and could be an asset in the 2007 World Cup.

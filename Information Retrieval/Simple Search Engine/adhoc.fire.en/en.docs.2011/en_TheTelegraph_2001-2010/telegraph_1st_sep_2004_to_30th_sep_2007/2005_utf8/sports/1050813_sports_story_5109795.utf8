 Ramesh is champion 

New Delhi: Grandmaster R.B. Ramesh ensured his second title by maintaining an unassailable one-point lead with yet another draw in the 12th and penultimate round of the 43rd National B Chess Championship on Friday. 

Ramesh, on 10 points, is followed by 10 players on nine points, all of whom have almost secured their berths among the 14 qualifiers for the National A Championships. 

This means the last round will be a battle for the remaining slots for which as many as six players, who are third with 8.5 points, need to reach the magical 9.5 mark. 

These players include D.K. Sharma, K. Rathnakaran, Arghyadip Das, P. Konguvel, Abhijeet Gupta, Deep Sengupta, M. Panigrahi and V. Saravanan. 

Asian junior champion S. Arun Prasad, IMs B.S. Sivanandan, P.D.S. Girinath, defending champion Sriram Jha and Lanka Ravi, B.T. Muralikrishanan, Diwakar Prasad Singh, Himanshu Sharma, M.S. Thej Kumar and Vikramaditya Kamble are all placed joint second. 

Meanwhile, WGM Nisha Mohota, IM R.R. Laxman, Dronavalli Harika and 12-year-old M.R. Lalith Babu spoilt their chances of a National A berth with defeats in crucial matches. Valay Parikh may still hope to salvage some pride owing to his better overall record in the tournament.

Christchurch: Australia crushed New Zealand by nine wickets in the first Test at the Jade Stadium on Sunday to take the lead in the three-match series and claim their sixth successive win. 

The world?s top-ranked side cruised to their victory target of 133 in less than 32 overs with a day to spare after bowling out New Zealand for 131 before tea. 

The match had been in the balance at the start of the fourth day with the Black Caps 10 runs in front and all their second-innings wickets intact. 

New Zealand, however, lost five wickets before lunch and the remaining five in the middle session as Australia seized control after trailing for most of the first three days. 

?The boys are pretty proud of what we?ve just done,? Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. ?Coming here today the game was even, to think that it?s over and done with now is pretty remarkable.? 

The fast bowlers ripped through New Zealand?s top order with Jason Gillespie capturing three for 38 and Glenn McGrath and Michael Kasprowicz bagging one each. 

Leg-spinner Shane Warne destroyed the tail, taking five for 39 from 14 overs to notch up his 29th five-wicket haul in Tests and sail past 1,000 first-class wickets. 

Unlike the first innings when they piled up 433, New Zealand were more tentative second time round. Seven of their 10 batsmen fell leg-before, equalling the world record for a Test innings. 

Four batsmen made at least 20 but none did lasting damage, Brendon McCullum top-scoring with 24. 

?We let ourselves down,? New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said. ?Day Four got us again through poor batsmanship and lack of application. We need to take the game by the scruff of the neck. At the moment we pinch the scruff of the neck and let it go.? 

Australia suffered an early setback when Matthew Hayden was dismissed for 15 from the last ball before tea, caught in close by Craig Cumming off left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori. 

But Hayden?s departure had no effect on the result as Justin Langer and Ponting shared an unbroken stand of 110 to steer the team home. Adam Gilchrist was named Man of the Match for his 121 in the first innings. 

New Zealand have named the same XII for the second Test. 

Warne to shift base 

Meanwhile, Warne on Sunday revealed he is going to make England his permanent base but will continue his Test career for Australia. 

?If I can keep that going, playing for Victoria, Hampshire and enjoying playing cricket for Australia, that?s my lot at the moment and it seems to be going pretty well,? he said. (Reuters)

Lisbon: Sporting coach Jose Peseiro says his side can draw inspiration from Portos success in Europe when they take on Russias CSKA Moscow in the Uefa Cup final on Wednesday. 

Under Jose Mourinho, Porto lifted the Uefa Cup in 2003 and followed that up a year later by winning the Champions League. 

For a Portuguese side to reach a Uefa final for the third season in a row shows we are stronger than we think, Peseiro told a news conference on Tuesday. 

Our success has to do with the infrastructure, quality of Portuguese players and our coaches. We have high quality players ? just look at some of the Portuguese playing for the best teams in Europe. 

Sporting, who needed a stoppage-time goal in extra time to overcome AZ Alkmaar in their semi-final, take on CSKA at their own Alvalade stadium in Lisbon, looking to secure their first European trophy since the 1964 Cup Winners Cup. 

Peseiro said CSKA, who will be playing in their 19th European game of the season having played in the Champions League group stage, represented Sportings toughest test yet. 

They counter-attack quickly and keep possession well. We know all about them, said the coach. 

Meanwhile, CSKA coach Valery Gazzayev believes his team has every chance of achieving their dream by following the Greek example. 

We have a plan for the game and I hope we are able to stick to it all the way through the game, he said. It is important that we do that and play with confidence and self-control. (REUTERS)

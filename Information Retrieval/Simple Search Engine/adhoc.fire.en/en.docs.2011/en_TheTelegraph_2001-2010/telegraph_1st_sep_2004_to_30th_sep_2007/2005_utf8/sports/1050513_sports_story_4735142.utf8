 Sao Paulo: Real Madrid striker Ronaldo and MTV Brazil host Daniella Cicarelli has said that they were breaking up.

 ?(They) have officially separated and reserve the right to not give any additional details about the episode,? they said in a short joint statement released to the media.

 The announcement comes just two weeks after Cicarelli, who?s also a model, had a miscarriage.

 Ronaldo and Cicarelli had planned to marry later this year, but local media had widely reported that the couple?s relationship was undergoing a crisis and that they were hardly seeing each other recently.

 On February 14, the 28-year-old three-time Fifa Player of the Year and Cicarelli threw a lavish party for more than 200 guests at France?s Chantilly Castle to celebrate their engagement. 

 Bogota: A supporter of Bogota team Santa Fe was stabbed to death and another 25 fans hurt at a match on Wednesday in Colombia?s worst soccer violence for years, police said.

 Another man was in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed by fellow Santa Fe supporters and hitting his head when he threw himself off a terrace to escape at the match against Cali team America in Bogota?s Campin stadium.

 In another incident, dozens of Santa Fe fans invaded the pitch during the local first division game that their team lost 2-5.

 Madrid: David Beckham is doubtful for Real Madrid?s league match at Sevilla on Saturday because of a muscle strain in his left leg, club doctors said on Thursday.

 The 30-year-old England captain, who has been in fine form for Real in recent games, has been unable to train fully for the last two days and will have a fitness test on Friday.

 In training on Thursday, Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo tried out Spanish international Guti in place of Beckham rather than his more natural replacement Luis Figo, who has fallen out of favour in the last month.

 Brescia: Former Barcelona and Spain midfielder Josep Guardiola was sentenced to seven months in jail on doping charges.

 Guardiola, 34, is the first soccer player sentenced under an Italian law created in 2000 making doping a criminal offence. Guardiola, who denied taking banned substances, appealed the sentence on Wednesday and is free to leave the country. He currently plays in Qatar.

 No date was immediately set for the appeal hearing. Guardiola, who played for Brescia from 2001 to 2003 in the Serie A, tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in November 2001.

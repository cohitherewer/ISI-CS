The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Amardip, Sandeep in joint lead

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Meeruts Amardip Sinh Malik and Sandeep Syal from Chennai took the lead on the opening day of the Hero Honda Open East at the RCGC. Both returned cards of 4-under 68, and led locals Feroz Ali and Uttam Singh Mundy, at 3-under 69, by just one stroke. 

Mundy, who is trying to make his mark on the Asian circuit, played his first tournament on the Indian tour. He had an erratic start, but then steadied himself to finish with two birdies ? on the 12th and 16th. 

Mukesh Kumar ended the day at 2-under 70, followed by G.S. Sethi and an amateur, Akshay Butta at 1-under 71.

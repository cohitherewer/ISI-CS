 Sharma registers double win 

 Ganguly held GM Zvjaginsev 

Moscow: National champion and Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly held higher rated GM Vadim Zvjaginsev of Russia to a draw in the third round of the International Open chess tournament here. 

The Indian contingent, meanwhile, continued to look for elusive victories and on the third day only International Master Dinesh Kumar Sharma could manage wins, and that too in B group. 

Sharma accounted for Chouchanik Airapetian of the US first on a double-round day in this section and later put it across Ahmet Hazauri of Russia. 

In A1 section, GMs Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Andrei Kharlov of Russia emerged joint leaders. 

As many as 10 players are half-a-point behind while another pack of 22 is another half point adrift. Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda, with 1.5 points in their kitty, are next in line along with 34 others. 

Chanda, too, settled for his third draw on the trot after sharing honours with Russian GM Alexander Riazantsev. 

Sasikiran also registered a draw against veteran GM Oleg Romanishin of Ukraine. 

In A2 section, GM Tejas Bakre was held to a draw by International Master Tarvo Seeman of Estonia and Tania Sachdev?s quest for the final Women Grandmaster Norm suffered a blow as she lost her second successive game, going down to Jaroslav Ulko of Russia. 

Women Grandmaster Eesha Karvade and S. Kidambi came out with their first draws. (PTI)

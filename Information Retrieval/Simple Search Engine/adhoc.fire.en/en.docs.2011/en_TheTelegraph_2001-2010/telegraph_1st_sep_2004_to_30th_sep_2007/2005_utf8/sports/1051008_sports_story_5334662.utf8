 Karthikeyan 22nd at practice

Suzuka: The weather gods granted Narain Karthikeyans wishes as it poured heavily at the Suzuka circuit, but it soon turned out to be more than what the Indian had asked for on the first day of free practice at the Japanese Grand Prix here. 

An excessively wet track, combined with minor work needed on the car meant that Karthikeyan lost out valuable lap time, denting an otherwise satisfying day for the Jordan driver. 

I had a first good session this morning but then in the afternoon I lost of bit of time as we wanted to change some parts of the car and also because of the rain, said the 28-year old Indian. 

 Kathikeyan was 22nd (1:37.154) and Tiago Monteiro 24th (1:38.250). It is a pity the track got wet as I could not try a new set of tyres, contrary to my teammates.I really like the circuit at Suzuka, it is one of my favourites in the calendar so hopefully I will be able to do well here, Narain said. Karthikeyan completed 13 laps in the morning, but could do only seven in the afternoon on the first day of practice for the penultimate round of the Formula One World Championship. Karthikeyan and teammate Monteiro were joined by Japanese driver Sakon Yamamoto and the trio spent the day working on their car set-up and evaluating the Bridgestone tyres available. (PTI)

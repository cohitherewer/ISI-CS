 Vijay may rule Day I 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh is expected to rule Day I of the winter season beginning on Thursday. However, his quartet of Clockwork, Alcades, Regal Romance and Bountiful Pleasure hardly promises much returns in terms of money to make a visit to the racecourse worthwhile.

 While Vijays four will have the services of a seasoned jockey, C.Alford, the rival camps seem almost withdrawn from the fray. The likes of Melvyns and Amandeeps are unlikely to lower the Khaitans gold-and-red belt colours.

 While Alcades is going from strength-to-strength, Clockworks recent win indicated that the filly is much improved. Regal Romance, on the other hand, has returned from the south as a mature horse and the Royal Kingdom-Celestial Heights colt would be hard to down in the Turf Hawk Cup. Bountiful Pleasure, though running after a long lay-off, is looking fit to lift the Rising Star Cup.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

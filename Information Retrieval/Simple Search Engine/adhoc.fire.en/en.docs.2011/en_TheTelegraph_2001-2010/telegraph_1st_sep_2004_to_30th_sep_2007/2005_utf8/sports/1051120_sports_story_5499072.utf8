Faisalabad: England captain Michael Vaughan has been passed fit to play in the second Test against Pakistan starting on Sunday. Vaughan missed the first match, which England lost, after aggravating a knee injury. 

I have passed the fitness test and have had a good few last days, Vaughan told a news conference. Its always a slight risk when you come back from injury, but I am confident I can get through the game and thats really all that counts. Day by day the recovery process has progressed well and it is getting better, he added. 

The England captain said with his return it was obvious that either Paul Collingwood or Ian Bell would miss out. 

England are keen to have their captain back and raise their intensity level after being outclassed on the final day of the first Test in Multan after controlling the first four days. 

England lost by 22 runs on an exciting final day after needing 198 runs for a win. 

Vaughan has led England to 19 wins in 31 Tests since taking over from Nasser Hussain two years ago, including the recent 2-1 Ashes win. 

Its tough because in the circumstances we have to win both Tests to win the series. Winning the toss and getting off to a good start will be crucial tomorrow. We want to put Pakistan on the back foot as early as we can. 

He said the toss would be vital as the wicket was very dry in this part of the world. 

Whatever we do tomorrow we have to make sure we start well and put Pakistan under pressure as we did in Multan. 

We were going at a position when we could have won that game. We performed well for four days in Multan and on last morning we got unstuck. We just have to try to improve in this match. 

Asked about the threat posed by Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria to his batsmen, Vaughan said he was probably the best young leg spinner in the world. 

Kaneria took four wickets on the final day in Multan. 

He is a good bowler and we knew he would cause some concern for us on the final day. He has a few different deliveries, he stated. 

Meanwhile, it was confirmed that Pakistan pacer Shabbir Ahmed, who was reported for a suspect action for the second time this year, would miss the second Test. 

Coach Bob Woolmer said Shabbir was the only likely change from the first Test that they won. 

A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) source said the team management had been advised not to play Shabbir. 

We are very intent on finishing the series here. We realise we have a momentum going and if we play well here we can beat England and win the series. Woolmer said. 

England have not batted well. They have batted well in bits and pieces but they havent batted well throughout the series so we need to take this opportunity. Its there for us. 

Woolmer said Rana Naved could be picked for the second Test as he had taken 11 wickets in a domestic match in Faisalabad. 

Woolmer also wants the ICC to revise how it deals with bowlers with suspect bowling actions. 

I am not criticising the ICC or the process. But we are dealing with peoples lives here and I cant understand how a bowler who has been cleared by scientists (biomechanic specialists) after proper tests can be called again by umpires, Woolmer said. 

What is happening is that biomechanic scientists are saying one thing the umpires are saying another thing. Each one of them has a job to do but I feel sorry for the affected bowlers, the former England player and ex-ICC high performance manager said.

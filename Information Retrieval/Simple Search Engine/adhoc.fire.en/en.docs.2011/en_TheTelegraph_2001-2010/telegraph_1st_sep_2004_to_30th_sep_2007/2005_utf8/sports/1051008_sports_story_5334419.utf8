Tokyo: The sensational Sania Mirza upset top seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia in a thrilling three-setter to storm into the semi-finals of the $170,000 AIG Japan Open Tennis Championship on Friday. 

Seeded eight in this tier III event, Sania fought her way back after conceding the first set to carve out a 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 win against the 22-ranked Russian in 2 hours 28 minutes. 

The win fetched the Indian, placed 37th on the WTA rankings, a semi-final date with third seed Tatiana Golovin of France who won 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 against local favourite and fifth seed Ai Sugiyama in the quarter-finals. 

Fourth seed Maria Kirilenko of Russia, fresh from her first career title at the China Open two weeks ago, joined Sania into the semi-finals after beating the 2002 Japan Open champion, American Jill Craybas, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2. 

Sanias form, however, eluded her in the doubles where pairing with Israels Sahar Peer, she lost 1-6, 4-6 to the second seeded duo of Gisela Dulko and Maria Kirilenko in the semi-finals. 

Second seed Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic defeated Sofia Arvidsson of Sweden 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 for a place in the semi-finals against Kirilenko.Sania broke Zvonareva twice in the opening set, but each time surrendered the advantage on her own serve before hitting an easy overhead into the net at 30-40 in the 12th game to lose the set. 

But she rallied in the second and third sets, firing her forehands on both sides of the court for a series of winners and never allowing Zvonareva to go up. 

Sania, a trail-blazer back home in womens tennis, was pretty pleased with her quarter final effort. 

I think I played one of my best matches, said the 18-year-old after the match. 

On the important points, she would play a great point with good ground strokes, which kind of confused me. She was the No. 1 seed, and Im happy that I was able to play my game, Sania said. 

Zvonareva blamed her defeat to a loss in concentration. 

I started out ok. I think I played well in the first set, but then I lost my concentration and couldnt get my game back. 

Shes a good player. For me, it was important to concentrate on my game and do what I needed to do, but I couldnt play good tennis throughout the whole match, she said.

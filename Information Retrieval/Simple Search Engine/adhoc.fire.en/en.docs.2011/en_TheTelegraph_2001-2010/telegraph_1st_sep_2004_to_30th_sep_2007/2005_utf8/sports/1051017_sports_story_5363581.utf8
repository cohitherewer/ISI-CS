 Ashes just a dim and distant memory Down Under 

 - Australia is a country that sallies forth into the future 

 Andrew Flintoff, Kevin Pietersen and Michael Vaughan celebrate their Ashes win in London 

Excuse me, but havent Australians missed something? I realise (because Im writing this feeling completely jet-lagged) that there is a considerable time difference between the two countries and that the Ashes series would have been on television screens late at night Down Under. But Im also told that the viewing figures over here were pretty good, so we can safely assume that some Australians stayed up and watched. And lets not forget that 11 Australians actually took part and can, therefore, attest to the fact that it did actually happen. 

Its just that during the last week that Ive been in Sydney, you wouldnt have thought that the Ashes had actually taken place at all. Certainly, it has not helped matters that the World XI have been so feeble. But nobody is too keen to talk about the Ashes and the Australian team seemed to have done to it what Lenin tried to do to Trotsky ?? that is, airbrush it completely from history. 

The Australian players have certainly got their bounce back. Heres Shane Warne this week: I still believe Australia are the best team in the world in both forms of the game. And Ricky Ponting: Weve won consistently home and away now for a long time and I still think were the best team in the world. And Matthew Hayden: If we play our best cricket I dont think that any team can beat us. 

Of course, these three great Australian cricketers are entitled to their opinion but isnt that why sporting contests are played out: to settle differences of opinion so that instead of guessing who might be the best team we have empirical facts? And, just so that readers of this newspaper dont forget, this particular difference of opinion was settled decisively in Englands favour. 

Not just in three one-day games (and suddenly, Australia seem very keen to invest the recent Super Series one-day games with extra meaning). No, the Ashes were contested over five Test matches and England won so decisively that it is difficult to think of a session that Australia dominated after the first Test at Lords. Without rain England would probably have won 4-1. 

The only clue over here that something rather momentous recently happened in the cricketing world, is the absence of Damien Martyn, and the presence of an all-rounder, Shane Watson. After years of telling the world that four bowlers are enough in Test cricket, suddenly Australia have picked five-copying Englands successful strategy-and giving Stuart MacGill his long-awaited recall. 

Otherwise it is business as usual. On the first day of this game, Australias coach John Buchanan was re-appointed until 2007 along with a ringing endorsement from his employers. The job was not put out to tender and no alternative was discussed. Buchanan did off his hat in Englands direction suggesting that Australia would look at employing more specialist coaches in future. So far this week, though, the only noticeable change to Australias support staff has been the presence in the nets of Australias fastest female bowler, Cathryn Fitzpatrick. She has been giving Buchanan a helping hand, which should at least have sent the visiting MCC president, Robin Marlar, into a tailspin. 

The reaction over here to the Ashes is instructive when you consider what might have happened in England had the cycle of Australian dominance continued. Duncan Fletcher might well have been re-appointed but not without surviving a searching interrogation of his methods. 

There would have been a period of civil war within English cricket: arguments would have raged as to whether the system was faulty and archaic; whether there was a need to cull a few counties and end a few careers. The period of reflection would probably have lasted until the next Ashes series. 

Australia, in contrast, has rapidly moved on. It is said that one of the key differences in attitude and outlook between England and Australia is that Australia is a country that sallies forth into the future whereas England is constantly glancing backwards over her shoulder. 

The Ashes? you hear them saying here. Its only 14 months away. Cant wait. Bring it on. It is one of the reasons why Australia are so good at sport. It is why Hayden can claim without any sense of irony or ridiculousness or embarrassment that no team can touch Australia at their best. 

It is why Adam Gilchrist, after months of uncertainty against Andrew Flintoff, can come out and belt a hundred against him as if nothing had happened. It is why Australian sportsmen are tremendously resilient. It is why, despite the fact that the fault-lines still exist within this Australian team, the Ashes will be hard to retain.

 Suspended Canas denied entry

 Neil Harman in New York 

 Guillermo Canas, the Argentinian 

 who received a two-year ban from tennis last month after 

 he was found guilty of taking a banned diuretic, has been 

 refused permission to enter the grounds of Flushing Meadow 

 ? as a spectator.

 The world No. 28, who is appealing 

 his sentence to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), 

 wanted to come to the US Open on Wednesday to watch his 

 girlfriend, Maria Emilia Salerni, playing her second-round 

 match against Daniela Hantuchova. 

 It would not have been a long 

 stay, for Salerni, an Argentinian, lost 0-6, 1-6, but Canas 

 was turned away by the United States Tennis Association, 

 which said that if he tried to come in, he would be escorted 

 from the grounds.

 Under the rules of the ATP, a 

 player who is banned cannot be given an accredited pass, 

 but it is an absurdity to suggest that Canas simply watching 

 tennis is going to contaminate the event and is a justifiable 

 reason to ban him from the grounds. 

 A desperately upset Canas had 

 to watch on Television.

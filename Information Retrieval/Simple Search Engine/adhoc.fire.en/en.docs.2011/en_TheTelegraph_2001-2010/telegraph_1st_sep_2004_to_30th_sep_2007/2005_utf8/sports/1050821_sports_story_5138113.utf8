Durban: Kumar Sangakkara led Asia XIs batting revival with a stylish 61 to help his team post 267 for seven in the second one-day International against Africa XI on Saturday. 

His Sri Lankan teammate Mahela Jayawardene also came good with a composed 52, while experienced Yusuf Youhana contributed a vital 42. Virender Sehwag made 38 at the top of the innings while skipper Inzamam-ul Haq made an unbeaten 32. 

The Asians, who suffered a two-run loss in the first ODI on Wednesday, found conditions at Kingsmead suited to their style of batting. 

Asia XI pulled off a 17-run victory as Africa XI were all out for 250 in 49.2 overs. Zaheer Khan was the wrecker-in-chief with three for 43. Shoaib Akhtar took two for 30. Steve Tikolo scored 43. 

The pitch, readied in less than two weeks, offered reliable bounce at slow pace. 

Sangakkara, in particular, made the most of the short square boundaries using the cut and pull strokes to good effect. 

He did have a close shave on 10, when his hook shot off Monde Zondeki was almost caught at fine-leg. Boeta Dippenaar erred in positioning himself a few yards inside the fence and the ball went through his fingers over the rope. 

Sangakkaras strokeplay more than made up for Shahid Afridis two-ball dismissal and an unusually subdued innings from Sehwag. 

Afridi fell leg-before to Heath Streak after lofting the first ball for six. Sehwag needed 51 balls for his 38, and although there was a trademark flat-batted six over point off Zondeki, the cavalier Indian opener was happy to let Sangakkara do most of the scoring. 

Sangakkara ultimately fell to the pull shot, top-edging Thomas Odoyo to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. The left-handers partnership with Sehwag for the second wicket was worth 91 and came off 101 balls. 

Jayawardene played the sheet anchor, Youhana was more adventurous. 

The experienced Pakistani planted Zondeki over backward square-leg and leg-glanced him for a six and a four in the same over. Youhana was hit Justin Kemp straight into Shaun Pollocks hands .

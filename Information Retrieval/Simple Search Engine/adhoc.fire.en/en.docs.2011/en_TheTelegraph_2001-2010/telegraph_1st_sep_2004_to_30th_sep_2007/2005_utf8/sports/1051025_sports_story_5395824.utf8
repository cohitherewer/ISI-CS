Nagpur: For a fast bowler, he certainly doesnt fit the bill ? slightly built, baby faced, comes across more as a scholar. But S. Sreesanth is determined to make a mark for himself. As and when the 22-year-old makes his debut, he will be the second Keralite ? a state more famous for its footballers and athletes ? after Tinu Yohanan to play for India. 

Having impressed Greg Chappell during his stint at the NCA in June-July, Sreesanth features prominently in the coachs scheme of things. 

He spoke to The Telegraph on a wide range of topics. 

The following are excerpts 

On his early days 

I moved over to Bangalore when in class VIII and studied in Florence Public School. It was then that I took cricket seriously. I learnt the tricks of the trade at A. V. Jayaprakashs academy. But despite my best efforts, I failed to make the grade in the Karnataka age-group teams. So I decided to go back to Kerala when in class XI. Playing in the Kerala U-19 side I got a hattrick against Karnataka and that was sweet revenge for me. 

On why he took up fast bowling 

Initially I started off as a leg-spinner. It was only after I quit school that I took to fast bowling. The decision was driven more out of a rivalry with my brother, Dipu, who also bowled medium pace. I simply wanted to bowl faster than him and that drove me during those days. The move paid off as I achieved success. 

On his idol 

Sachin bhai without any doubt. On the fast bowling front, Dennis Lillee and Allan Donald. I learnt a lot from Dennis Sir during my stint at the MRF Pace Foundation. As for Donald, I used to copy his action when I started off. I simply loved his smooth run up and his aggro. 

On coaches who have made an impact 

Dennis Sirs work ethics was exemplary and helped me a lot when I had a hamstring injury. His mantra helped me in setting targets and achieving the same. I was always motivated by his action and his ability to get the ball moving. He changed my action to side-on. 

I always used to write down whatever Dennis Sir had to say at the camp. His keep at it slogan was a great source of encouragement. 

T.A. Sekar Sir has also been of great help and a source of constant encouragement. During the early years, it was P.V. Srishant of Kerala. 

On his hobbies 

I love to write poems and paint. I am also fond of music ? generally soft but it depends more on the mood ? and occasionally like to put on my dancing shoes. 

On the turning point of his career 

Though I have a hattrick in Ranji Trophy (versus Himachal Pradesh in Palakkad 2004-05) too, I would rate the one I achieved at the under-19 level as the turning point. I was trying to make a statement after being ignored by Karnataka? I had to be successful, otherwise... I still remember the batsmen who were dismissed ? Sudhir Rao, Stuart Binny and Deepak Chowley. That match gave me the confidence. It also made people sit up and take notice and helped make my Ranji debut the following season (2002-03) versus Goa. 

On being part of Team India 

Feels great... I have been waiting for this day when I would share the dressing room with such stalwarts as Sachin, Dravid et all. I cant wait to take the field. 

On what Greg Chappells message has been 

His message has been simple: You must do well, its a good opportunity... Keep working hard... You never know what awaits you. 

His manner of handling things is much the same as Dennis Sir. The work ethics are the same. So thats been of some help. 

On how he hopes to handle pressure 

I never thought of making it to the team when I was picked to play for the B team in the Challenger. Now Im in the Indian squad, the only new face, and only hours away from making my debut. It all seems so much like a dream. 

Thankfully, I havent yet felt the pressure. I will consult my seniors if needed, but I should be able to cope with it. 

The responsibility has boosted my confidence and Ive got to keep doing what Im supposed to do. 

On being adjudged Man of the Series in the Challenger 

When my name was announced, I was shocked. Just couldnt believe my own ears. I was hoping someone like Venugopal Rao would get it, but the unexpected happened. I hope I can prove worthy of the faith imposed on me. That will go down as one of the biggest moment of my career. 

On his biggest asset 

Being able to swing the ball both ways.

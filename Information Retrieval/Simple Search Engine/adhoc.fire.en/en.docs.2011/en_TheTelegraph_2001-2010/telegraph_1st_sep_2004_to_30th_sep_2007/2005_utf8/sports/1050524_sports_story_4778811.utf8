The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI must take much of the blame 

 - Misbehaviour by Two seniors was reported by The Telegraph last november 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Sunil Gavaskars comments on John Wright in his latest column ? specifically, the bit about his being told off and sworn at by some players ? has set the proverbial cat among the pigeons. 

However, misbehaviour by two seniors was revealed by The Telegraph as far back as November 20 last year. 

Indeed, a report by this correspondent from Kanpur mentioned: Perhaps, it has something to do with Wrights image, but he hasnt got the credit he deserves. Worse, and this is shocking ? recently, a couple of seniors werent exactly respectful towards him. 

Its to Wrights credit that he hasnt allowed a particularly unpleasant incident to influence his own opinion about the duo. Rather, he has even gone out of his way to protect them. 

Both misbehaved at the start of the 2004-05 season, with one even challenging Wright to get him dropped. Apparently, they sought to behave like Shoaib Akhtar and it fell on the then coach to remind them of their responsibility towards Team India. 

They felt offended. 

Significantly, among other reasons, its to keep the duo (and those similarly inclined) on a leash that the BCCI chose Greg Chappell as Wrights successor. 

Gavaskar, for his part, has written: One of the things that may have made up Wrights mind to not renew his contract could have been the way some players treated him in the last year. 

He was told off and sworn at by some players and one thing is for sure that however inefficient an Indian coach may be, there is little chance that he may be abused by any of the players, however big the current players may be. 

Frankly, the BCCI has to take much of the blame for what happened. 

For one, Wright never had the comfort of a two-year contract (sensibly given to Chappell) ? instead, he kept getting extensions and that diluted his authority. 

Then, theres no professional manager to enforce discipline and allow the coach to focus wholly on matters cricket. 

Also, the coach is only invited to selection committee meetings and doesnt have a vote. 

Given what exists, it didnt surprise that just hours before ending his four-and-half year innings with Team India, Wright (in an interview to this newspaper) called for overhauling the selection process. 

Now, Chappells moves on selection will be watched with interest.

 Shoaib inks PCB contract

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Islamabad: Even as Pakistan quick Shoaib Akhtar Thursday signed on the dotted line for the central contract of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after it revised some clauses in view of his prior commitments, PCB boss Shaharyar Khan expressed support for Bob Woolmer, a day after Australia swept the series against Pakistan 3-0. 

Shoaib had refused to sign the contract, even though 14 of his teammates had accepted it before the Australia tour, leading to a lot of speculation. 

PCB director Abbas Zaidi confirmed that the board had revised some clauses in Shoaib?s contract because of his prior commitments. 

?Shoaib has commitments with a number of sponsors and is also playing County cricket next year. He was a bit uncomfortable with some particular clauses, which have now been revised to the satisfaction of the board and his lawyers,? Zaidi was quoted as saying in The News Thursday. 

Woolmer, picked for the coaching position by the PCB this year, had meanwhile, faced increasing criticism in the Pakistan media as his team?s failures mounted on its Australian tour. 

Woolmer has also come out against Shoaib, questioning the Rawalpindi Express? commitment. 

?There is no question of removing him (Woolmer)... He?s one the finest coaches in the world and his removal is not under consideration,? the PCB chairman said. Khan did not comment on the reasons for Pakistan?s poor performance against Australia. 

Pakistan?s batsmen failed to deliver during the three-Test whitewash, while the team?s bowlers only occasionally troubled the Australian line-up. 

But Woolmer on Wednesday said his team was improving and learning some valuable lessons against the world?s best cricketers, which should set them up well for their next Test series in India. 

Shortly before its defeat in the third Test, Pakistan team managers announced the recall of allrounder Azhar Mahmood and three other players for this month?s three-nation, limited-overs series in Australia. 

The 29-year-old Mahmood will join the Pakistan team along with opening batsmen Mohammad Hafeez and Taufeeq Umar, and seamer Rao Iftikhar. 

 Inzy under fire again 

Pakistan?s sports minister has questioned the efficiency of skipper Inzamam-ul Haq for the 0-3 defeat to Australia, a report from Islamabad adds. 

Muhammad Ajmal Khan accused the players and ?especially? the captain for the humiliation, while asking the PCB to explain the reasons for the whitewash.

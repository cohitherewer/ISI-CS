The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting face Bayern test today

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The opponents are the worlds famous Bayern Munich, but Mohammedan Sporting are taking heart from East Bengals shocking loss to Ever-Ready on Thursday. 

Mohammedan Sporting usually dont find too many chances of challenging a foreign side, but when they clash with the Germans ? in the second semi-final of the IFA Shield at the Salt Lake Stadium ? they will certainly not be short on motivation. 

That we are going to play against a top-class foreign team is enough motivation for the boys. They are aware of the challenge and know the prestige of the country is associated with them, the clubs stop-gap coach Jagadish Ghosh said on Thursday. 

Captain Suley Musah also voiced a similar view. On paper they (Bayern Munich) are world beaters, but we are not going to keep too much pressure on us. If we play to our potential, we can also beat them, the Ghanain said. 

Musahs return to action after a two-match suspension ? slapped on him by the AIFF following his misdemeanour in the Federation Cup ? is a welcome boost for the black-and-white side, felt Ghosh. 

Bayern, on the other hand, played an exhibition match with the students at the Howrah Municipality Stadium. But head coach Hermann Gerland insisted the team had come here to win the tournament only. 

Apart from the Ghanian captain Christian Saba, the visitors (though a second-string side) have three other foreigners ? Stefan Maierhofer, Philipp Rehm (both Austrian) and Jose Luis Ortiz Melgar of Bolivia.

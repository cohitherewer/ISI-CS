The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Serena clash on Sania?s mind

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Having made a ?dream debut? in Melbourne on Monday, Sania Mirza is now thinking big. 

The 18-year-old admitted her first-round win over local challenger Cindy Watson in the Australian Open took a great deal of pressure off her and she is relishing the prospect of a probable third-round date with Serena Williams. 

?It will be such an exciting occasion if I manage to play against Serena. She?s one of the best players in the world and I really wish I get the privilege to challenge her and enjoy the occasion,? Sania told The Telegraph from her Melbourne hotel, a few hours after her 3-6, 6-3, 6-0 win over Watson. 

For that wish to be fulfilled, Sania has to get past Hungarian Petra Mandula in the second round on Wednesday. 

?The possibility of facing Serena is certainly back at the back of my mind, but I?m now more focussed on the match against Mandula. She?s a tricky customer. I?m praying to God that I can stick to my basics and play well against her,? the Hyderabad-based teenager remarked. 

Describing her landmark triumph over Watson ? which helped her match Nirupama Vaidyanathan?s feat as the only Indian woman to have won a match in any Grand Slam ? as a ?dream debut? in Grand Slams, Sania is aware she can?t afford to sit on her laurel. 

?It?s difficult to describe what?s going on in my mind. I?m so excited. But come tomorrow (Tuesday), my preparations against Mandula will start and I?m determined to give it my best shot,? she maintained. 

We can surely trust the young girl.

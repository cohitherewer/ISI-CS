The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No comments on Bulawayo episode 

 - More wants one selector to always be on tour with Team India 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Not wanting to add oxygen (as Greg Chappell would put it) to Indian crickets biggest controversy since the match-fixing revelations in 2000, chief selector Kiran More has taken a no comments stand. 

Being thousands of miles away from Bulawayo, I dont know what transpired between Chappell and Sourav Ganguly on the eve of the first Test. Therefore, I have no comments to offer, More told The Telegraph. 

The Vadodara-based More also played it safe when asked whether the coach could ask/advise the captain to step down when the selectors have already appointed him for the full tour. 

Im not sure about the rules? The Board will have to clarify? What I know is that the captain, vice-captain and coach function as selectors on a tour? I wouldnt like to add till I get the manager (Amitabh Choudhary) and the coachs reports from the Board once the team is back, he said, on Friday evening. 

Thats going to be after next weeks AGM in the city. More, of course, is expected to retain his position. 

Interestingly, he felt one of the five selectors should always be part of a touring squad. 

Quite a few countries (Australia and South Africa, for example) have a policy whereby somebody from the selection committee is always at hand on a tour? Our Board must look at something similar, More observed. 

Four members of the 2003-04 panel ? Syed Kirmani, More, Pranab Roy and Sanjay Jagdale ? did visit Pakistan during the Revival Tour, but only as guests of the home Board. 

Kirti Azad couldnt make the trip owing to political commitments.

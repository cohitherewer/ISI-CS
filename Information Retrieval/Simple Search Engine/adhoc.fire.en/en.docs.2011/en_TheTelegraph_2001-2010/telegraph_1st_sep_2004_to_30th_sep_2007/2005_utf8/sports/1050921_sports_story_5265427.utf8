The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pawar plays teasing game

 - BCCI AGM 

 Dalmiya group prepares for yet another election 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Till late on Tuesday, Union minister Sharad Pawar hadnt exactly revealed his AGM-cards, but the dominant Jagmohan Dalmiya group has begun preparing for another Board election. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, those currently in power have declined to give an assurance that they will back Pawar in 2006 when, technically, West can field a candidate for the presidency. 

Norths turn began last year and Haryanas Ranbir Singh Mahendra won on Dalmiyas casting vote. Its going to continue till the 2006 AGM (at least). 

Assuming Mahendra gets re-elected here on Thursday, he will be eligible to seek a one-year extension in 12 months time. However, the rules wont disallow a challenger from West. 

If Pawar chooses to contest this year, too, he must again be nominated by one of the affiliates from North. 

The Mumbai Cricket Association chief came through Punjab in 2004 and, this year, theres speculation he could be nominated by Jammu amp; Kashmir. 

We havent yet received a request from Mr Pawar, but if he does seek help, our administrative committee is going to take a decision, remarked Punjab Cricket Association chief Inderjit Singh Bindra. 

The savvy Bindra, who is a former Board president, arrived in the city (from New Delhi) late in the evening. Another Pawar backer (and a former Board president as well), Raj Singh Dungarpur, has also landed. 

Ironically, not many years ago, both were Dalmiyas closest allies and his group saw Mahendra as an outsider! 

But, then, Board politics is such that it doesnt take long for a friend to turn foe and vice-versa. 

On record, Pawar has said he will wait for the court verdict on the disputes concerning affiliates like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. 

More than that, he wont risk it ? despite appearing keen ? unless hes satisfied with his own assessment. 

According to a source close to Pawar, hes not going to rely only on the assessment made by loyalists. 

After all, it backfired last year. 

Not that a major political player like Pawar has anything to gain even if he does become the Board president. 

Significantly, unlike last year when the pitch was high, Pawars campaign this time has been Dalmiya-like. 

Teasing, really. 

Because next to nothing has been revealed, Dalmiya has been made to work overtime in ensuring his flanks are covered. 

He certainly is confident. 

Returning to the disputes, Rajasthan is pro-Pawar, while the other two affiliates are in Dalmiyas bag. 

As of now, though, its unlikely that the courts will give a ruling before the AGM ? incidentally, being held here for the fourth year in succession. 

Like the permanent Test centres, Calcutta is on its way to becoming a permanent centre for AGMs. 

Intriguingly, but not surprisingly, the nuisance-creating Chennai-based Netaji Cricket Club has again gone to court and sought the appointment of an independent authority to conduct the AGM. 

That, of course, has been challenged by the Board. One hopes last years unpleasantness is avoided. 

While Mahendra may remain president, secretary S.K. Nairs three-year term is over. 

If theres an election, those in power could field Brijesh Patel. Otherwise, it seems joint-secretary Goutam Das Gupta is going to be elevated. 

The Pawar group, one understands, could again back Niranjan Shah. 

If Das Gupta is to move up, then a new joint-secretary will have to be identified by those currently calling the shots. 

Unless theres an election and an upset, Jyoti Bajpai should continue as the Board treasurer.

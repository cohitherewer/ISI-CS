Indore: South Zone recovered from a poor start to post 327 for nine at stumps on the opening day of the four-day Duleep Trophy league match against North Zone here on Tuesday. 

The South innings was built mainly around opener Robin Uthappa?s 80 (15x4). He shared a century stand with Sridharan Sriram (25). A 87-run stand for the fifth wicket between V.V.S. Laxman (55) and S. Sharath (60) also boosted the total. 

Wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik, named in India?s squad for the first Test against Pakistan, remained unbeaten on 49. 

For North, left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra showed a return to form ahead of the Test series to return with figures of four for 110 in 23 overs. 

Earlier, Uthappa and Sriram added 113 for the second wicket after South suffered an early blow with the run out of Swapnil Asnodkar in the third over after electing to bat. South?s recovery received a blow when the latter was bowled by Nehra. 

The gangling pacer also got rid off Uthappa having him caught by Harbhajan Singh to reduce South to 123 for three. 

Harbhajan, back from Australia after undergoing corrective measures for his action, then sent back Arjun Singh to reduce South to 145 for four before some stubborn resistance from Laxman and Sriram stemmed the rot. 

Laxman warmed up nicely for the tough battle ahead with an elegant half century that contained seven fours. 

The India star and Sharath, who struck 11 fours in his half century, added 87 for the fifth wicket to take the team past the 230 mark. 

Brief scores: South Zone 327/9 (Robin Uthappa 80, V.V.S. Laxman 55, S. Sharath 60; Ashish Nehra 4/110) vs North Zone. (PTI)

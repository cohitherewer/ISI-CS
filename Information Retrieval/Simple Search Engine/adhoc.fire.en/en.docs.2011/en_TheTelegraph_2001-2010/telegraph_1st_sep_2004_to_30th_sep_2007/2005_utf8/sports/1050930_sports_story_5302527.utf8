 Anand crushes Judit

 Anand won in 41 moves 

San Luis (Argentina): World No.2 Viswanathan Anand justified his top-billing, crushing worlds best woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary in the first round of the World Chess Championship here on Wednesday. 

World No.3 Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria also made a fine start, defeating another Hungarian, Peter Leko. 

Rest of the opening round games ended in deadlocks as Peter Svidler of Russia split point against Michael Adams of England, while defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan missed out on chances against Russian Alexander Morozevich. 

The championship this year is being played on a double round-robin basis between eight players under classical time control. 

Playing with black, Anand started off the proceedings with Caro Kann, which left Polgar confused. Her first few moves were indication enough for Anand that she was unsure whether to take things easy or go for some constructive attacking plan. 

With the middle game almost in a haze, Polgar got an illusionary attack rolling on the king side, but Anand simply rotated his queen over to the queen side, and once his pieces got the coordination he was looking for, the finale was short and sweet with a knight sacrifice on the 34th move. The game lasted 41 moves. 

Grandmaster Veselin Topalov also came out trumps with black pieces, albeit luckily, against Leko who failed to capitalise on his advantage. 

It was a Sicilian Nazdorf wherein Leko restored faith in the English attack. However, Leko missed an opportunity to open the game on his 17th move and Topalov squeezed back in to the game with some deft manoeuvres. 

After trading queens on the 24th move, Lekos advantage was nullified and it was Topalov who gained the upper hand. Leko resigned on the 40th move, already down a pawn and massacre in sight. (PTI)

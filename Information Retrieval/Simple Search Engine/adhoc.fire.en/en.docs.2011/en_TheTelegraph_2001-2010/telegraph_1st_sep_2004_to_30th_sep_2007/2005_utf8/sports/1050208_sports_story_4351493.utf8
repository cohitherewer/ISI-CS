Madrid: Atletico Madrid threw the Spanish title race wide open on Sunday when a Fernando Torres double consigned Barcelona to a 0-2 defeat, their first home loss of the season. 

The 20-year-old striker got Atletico off to a flying start at the Nou Camp when he guided home in the first minute after a stunning back-heeled assist from playmaker Ariel Ibagaza. Ronaldinho fluffed a 70th-minute penalty for Barcelona, before Torres completed a shock victory when he blasted home a spot kick deep into injury time. 

Atletico?s victory meant that Real Madrid, who beat Espanyol 4-0 on Saturday, are four points behind Barcelona in the standings with the two sides yet to meet at the Bernabeu. 

Earlier, Seville moved into fourth after a 3-0 win over Levante with striker Julio Baptista?s superbly struck 25-metre free kick five minutes from time the goal of the match. Villarreal climbed into fifth, one point further behind, with their fifth win in-a-row after they rallied from a goal down to beat 10-man Racing Santander 2-1 at home. 

Atletico got off to an explosive start thanks to some great skill from Ibagaza.With his back to goal the Argentine midfielder hooked a pass over the defence with his heel to give Torres a free run on goal and the striker outpaced defender Carles Puyol before threading the ball past Valdes inside the far post. 

Barca threw players forward in search of an equaliser, but were thwarted by the watertight Atletico defence and they grew increasingly frustrated as their constant stream of attacks failed to pay off and Samuel Eto?o and the lively Ronaldinho were reduced to trying their luck with long-range efforts. 

Atletico almost snatched another goal at the end of the half after the ball fell to Torres inside the area, but Valdes made a fingertip save to turn the shot around the post for a corner. 

Barca pinned Atletico back in their own area for most of the second half, but rarely troubled keeper Leo Franco and only had a chance to equalise when they were wrongly awarded a penalty when Perea clipped the heel of Eto?o outside the area. Ronaldinho slammed his spot kick wide of the post, but Torres made no mistake with his when he was felled by Valdes as he raced into the area three minutes into stoppage time. 

In Premier League, England keeper David James made a string of saves as Manchester City held leaders Chelsea 0-0 at Stamford Bridge ( as reported briefly in Monday?s Late City edition). 

The result most benefited City?s neighbours Manchester United but they still trail leaders Chelsea by nine points with 12 games to go and manager Jose Mourinho was quick to put the matters into perspective. 

?Before this game we needed nine victories and one draw (to clinch the title), in this moment we need just nine victories,? he said. 

?They fought a lot, they defended a lot, they had a great goalkeepeer, they were lucky and they got a point,? Mourinho said. 

Chelsea did, however, set a new Premier League record two minutes before halftime when they surpassed the 823 minutes without conceding a goal that Arsenal achieved in 1998. 

Earlier on Sunday, substitute Marcus Bent struck an injury-time equaliser as Everton came from behind for a 2-2 draw at Southampton. 

England striker James Beattie scored his first Everton goal against his former club after only four minutes but Saints hit back with goals from strikers Peter Crouch and Henri Camara. 

Southampton remain one from bottom while Everton stay fourth, 17 points adrift of Chelsea. 

Meanwhile, in Italy, champions AC Milan cut Juventus? lead at the top of Serie A to two points when a stoppage-time goal by Hernan Crespo earned them a 2-1 win over Lazio. The result gave Milan 48 points from 23 matches. Juventus are on 50 after losing 0-1 at Palermo on Saturday. 

Milan appeared to be on the verge of their third defeat in four matches when Massimo Oddo put Lazio ahead from the penalty spot in the 56th minute following Jaap Stam?s foul on Tommaso Rocchi. 

With 18 minutes remaining, however, a superb 30-metre free kick Andriy Shevchenko put the hosts level. 

In the final minutes, Milan besieged the Lazio goal, Cafu and Stam blazing shots narrowly over the bar and Lazio keeper Angelo Peruzzi smothering a Crespo header at his near post. In the fourth minute of stoppage time, Crespo sealed a last-gasp victory by poking home the rebound after a Kaka shot struck the post.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chelsea soar to 94 pts with 3-1 victory

 - Manchester United lose match, Premiership records 

HENRY WINTER at Old Trafford

Manchester Uniteds hopes of proving a point or three against the new champions disappeared in embarrassing fashion here last night. Goals from Tiago, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Joe Cole not only inflicted upon United their only home league defeat of the season but it allowed Jose Mourinhos men to rewrite the record books. 

Victory allowed Chelsea to break Uniteds Premiership record 92 points and 28 wins in a season. After going behind to Ruud van Nistelrooys goal, Chelsea took comfortable control and now have an astonishing record of 94 points and 29 wins. Those United fans who remained to the end stayed on to clap Chelsea off the pitch. 

Uniteds manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, was reminded painfully how far his team are behind Chelsea. While Uniteds in-house television company had been hosting a debate on Are Chelsea worthy champions, their manager was lauding Mourinhos formidable achievement. Writing in his programme notes, Ferguson promised no cheap Portuguese plonk in the managers office tonight, but fine wine deserving of a champion. 

The visitors brought some vintage flourishes of their own, notably the Premier Cru finishes of Tiago and Gudjohnsen. Ferguson had made his players form a guard of honour for Mourinhos title-winners, a sporting gesture although possibly done to remind his charges their standards have slipped. 

Old Traffords reaction to the sight of the new champions was warm applause, albeit spiced with a flurry of boos. Have you ever won the Treble? came the query from the Stretford End. Chelsea fans reacted by chanting One Malcolm Glazer. Even the visitors baiting of their United counterparts failed to raise the temperature much. This was after you Claude Makelele fare. 

In the first half especially, the game had the low-heat feel of a Community Shield, which it could well be if United overcome Arsenal in the May 21 FA Cup final. United appeared to have one eye on Cardiff, while Chelsea had two on Cancun and other imminent holiday destinations. The pervading spirit of pacifism did not suffuse two men in red. Rooney and Roy Keane have their pride and each powered into Chelsea. Keane was soon cautioned for catching Joe Cole, and could have walked for upending Lampard. 

By then United had scored, and both Keane and particularly Rooney played significant parts in Van Nistelrooys eight-minute poachers goal. From the wreckage of a United corner, Keane laid the ball back to Paul Scholes, whose firm shot was diverted by Robert Huth to Rooney. The England international drilled the ball into the box for Van Nistelrooy to pounce from close range with a confident flick. 

Chelsea screamed for offside but Glen Johnson had played the Dutchman on and then failed to react to the incipient danger. Chelseas defence is simply not the same without John Terry, who spent yesterday undergoing an operation on his troublesome toe. Chelsea responded stylishly to the rare indignity of falling behind in a Premiership game. Within 10 minutes, the champions were level, Tiago collecting possession 35 yards out, spotting that United players were dropping off him, expecting a pass to a blue shirt, so he seized the moment and let fly. 

The Portuguese international caught the ball beautifully, but it was still extraordinary that Carroll failed to move. Maybe the United keeper was expecting the ball to speed wide but it faded in. United briefly threatened, Ricardo Carvalho denying Van Nistelrooy with a wonderful late interception, while the busy Rooney also went close. 

But cometh the hour, cometh Chelsea again, with an attack that cut straight through United. Lampard fed Tiago, whose driven low pass was controlled and dinked over the onrushing Carroll. The champions twisted the knife with 10 minutes remaining, although the verdict from Uniteds perspective was death by misadventure. Wes Browns suicidal clearance was cut out by Lampard, who darted into the area and cut the ball in to Cole. 

Exploiting astonishing largesse from the linesman, the clearly offside Cole turned the ball home. Cole was then replaced by the home-grown defensive midfielder Anthony Grant, whom insiders at the Bridge has a real chance.

 Ronaldo wants to win Nobel

Sao Paulo: Brazil striker Ronaldo wants to win the Nobel peace prize. 

In an interview with a Brazilian news magazine, Ronaldo said he doesnt only want to be remembered for his goals, but also for his work as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations. 

I will work my entire life for this, and battle very hard to win a Nobel peace prize, ronaldo said. It would be very satisfying, worth the sacrifice. 

Ronaldo, a three-time Fifa Player of the Year and a twice World Cup winner, made a goodwill tour of Israel and the West Bank in May. The Real Madrid striker said his visit was part of his campaign against poverty around the world. 

Ronaldo also says he has a personal ambition to break Peles scoring record for Brazil in World Cups. Ronaldo is tied with Pele on 12 goals, two shy of the overall record held by Germanys Gerd Muller, who played in the 1970 and 74 Cups. 

Ronaldo said it is too early to say whether he will be able to play his fifth World Cup in 2010 in South Africa, surpassing Peles total of four. Time will tell, I want to keep playing as long as it gives me pleasure, Ronaldo said.

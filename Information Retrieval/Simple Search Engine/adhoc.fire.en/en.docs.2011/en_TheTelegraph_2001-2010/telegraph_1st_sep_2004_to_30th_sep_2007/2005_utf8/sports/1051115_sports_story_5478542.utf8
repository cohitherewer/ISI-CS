 West regain Duleep Trophy

 - Martin, Parthiv frustrate East 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Martin remained 52 .. 

Ahmedabad: West Zone regained the Duleep Trophy defeating East Zone by five wickets with more than two days to spare at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera on Monday. 

This is Wests 16th triumph, the most by any zone. North have won the crown 15 times. 

Resuming their second innings on Day III at 176 for nine, East could add only five runs to their total, thus setting West a 175-run victory target. 

Leg-spinner and captain Sairaj Bahutule took the last East Zone wicket in the morning to finish with three victims. Another experienced customer Zaheer Khan took four wickets for a match haul of six for 76. 

The left-arm seamer, who played a significant role in Wests Duleep campaign, will have to be seriously discussed when the national selectors next meet to pick the squad for the fourth and fifth ODIs against South Africa. 

West started on a disastrous note. They were three down for 35, with Akash Christian, Dheeraj Jadhav and Wasim Jaffer back in the pavilion. 

They lost two more wickets in quick succession when Ramesh Powar and Niraj Patel departed at 103 and 105. 

But former India players Jacob Martin and Parthiv Patel played sensible knocks to see West through. 

Martin, who hit the winning runs, remained unbeaten on 52 which came off 135 balls and included seven fours. Patels unbeaten 39 (48 balls, six fours) spanned an hour. 

Shib Shankar Paul claimed two wickets. Meanwhile, it was learnt that Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Zaheer, who were involved in a heated discussion on Sunday, were both summoned by Match Referee B. Raghunath. 

I just wanted to know what happened in the middle? I also spoke to the East captain (Sourav) and decided not to penalise anybody, Raghunath told The Telegraph on Monday. 

According to Raghunath, it was Souravs intervention that helped calm the situation.

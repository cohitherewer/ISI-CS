 Auction today 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Twelve of the 13 well-bred horses catalogued in the annual RCTC auction of the two-year-olds, will come under hammer from 7 pm at the racecourse on Saturday. There is no reserve price on any lot. Bidding is expected to be brisk on lots between 4 and 10 which looked quite impressive during the pre-sale parade.

 The club has made elaborate arrangements for sales ? entertainment, food and a lot more ? for about 600 bidders.

 Sales are also meant for owners/syndicates owning less than 10 horses. Moreover, RCTC is also offering run incentive for the juveniles who will be making their debut in the coming winter season. Veterinary service charges between March 1 and 31 October 2005 will also be waived by the club. A special maintenance cost incentive, amounting to Rs 36,000, will also be offered to each lot sold in the ring.

 Injury scare for Paes

New Delhi: Leander Paes? preparations for the Australian Open suffered a setback on Thursday when the Indian injured his foot during the doubles quarter finals at the Sydney International meet. 

The 31-year-old Paes and his Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic were leading 3-1 in the first set against third seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge when the Indian Davis Cup captain injured his left foot while trying to make a return. 

The pair soon conceded the match as Paes was taken to the hospital on a wheelchair, according to information received here. 

There were other casualties on a blistering hot day at the Olympic tennis centre. 

Russia?s Nadia Petrova, the world No. 13, quit her match against Chinese Peng Shuai because of heatstroke and big-serving American Taylor Dent retired halfway through the first set of his clash with Max Mirnyi as the temperature soared to 42 degrees Celsius. 

Fourth seed Romanian Andrei Pavel and Spanish fifth seed Feliciano Lopez both succumbed to lower ranked opponents (Czech qualifier Ivo Minar and Radek Stepanek respectively). 

While his main rivals all melted in the heat, Lleyton Hewitt breezed into the semi-finals with a 6-1, 7-6 win over Swede Thomas Johansson. 

 Fracture suspected 

 A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: According 

 to Dr Vece Paes, the seriousness of his son?s injury can 

 be gauged only after he a specialist studies the X-ray and 

 MRI scan plates on Friday. 

?Leander twisted his left ankle? he may have fractured the big toe,? said Dr Paes. 

If there is a fracture, Paes will be out for three-four weeks. ?In case there is no fracture, he will work with the physio of the Aussie Davis Cup team in Melbourne,? Dr Paes said. (agencies)

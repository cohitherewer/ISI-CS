 London: McLaren celebrated the arrival of a fit and healthy Montoya on Tuesday ? the new-born son of injured Colombian Formula One driver Juan Pablo. A team spokeswoman said the Colombian?s first child, Sebastian, was born in Miami on Monday.

 While son and wife Connie were doing well, the outlook for the 29-year-old racer remained uncertain after he suffered a hairline fracture of the shoulder last month before the Bahrain Grand Prix.

 Although the team hopes Montoya will be available for next week?s San Marino Grand Prix, the driver will have more scans before a final decision.

 Manchester: Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney denied reports that he slapped his fianc?e during an argument in a nightclub. A British tabloid reported in a front-page story on Tuesday that 19-year-old Rooney hit 18-year-old Colleen McLoughlin in the Brasingamens club in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on Sunday night, a day after Manchester United lost 0-2 to last-place Norwich.

 ?They did have an argument in public at the nightclub and left together and spent the night together,? Rooney?s management company said in a statement. ?Everything is fine between them.? 

 London: France striker Louis Saha will miss holders Manchester United?s FA Cup semi-final against Newcastle United in Cardiff on Sunday because of a calf problem. ?Louis is suffering from a calf injury and is likely to be out for two weeks,? a club spokesman told United?s official website on Tuesday.

 Saha, who moved to Old Trafford from Fulham for 12.8 million pounds ($24.19 million) in January 2004, has struggled with injuries all season, making only seven Premier League starts.

 Washington: Mike Tyson is returning to the ring. The former heavyweight boxing champion will fight for the first time in nearly a year, facing journeyman Kevin McBride on June 11 at Washington?s MCI Center, a boxing source said on condition of anonymity on Monday.

 The 38-year-old Tyson is 50-5 with two no contests and 44 knockouts. He lost two of his last three fights. In his most recent outing, in Louisville on July 30, he was stopped in the fourth round by Danny Williams after tearing cartilage in his left knee. 

 Chennai: The top 12 teams of the country will vie for honours in the 82nd Murugappa MCC hockey tournament that begins here on Thursday. It is the country?s richest prize money (grade-A) hockey event with the winner set to get Rs 1.30 lakh and a glittering gold cup from this year. 

 London: World women?s marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe said she was on a strict diet before Sunday?s London Marathon after dropping out of last year?s Athens Olympics event.

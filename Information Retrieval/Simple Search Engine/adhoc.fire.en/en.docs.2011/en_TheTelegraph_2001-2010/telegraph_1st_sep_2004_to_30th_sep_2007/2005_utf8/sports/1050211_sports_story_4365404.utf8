 SA may allow coach free hand

East London: United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) chief-executive Gerald Majola has said there was a possibility of a future coach being allowed to select teams himself. 

?If it makes our structures work, and depending on the coach?s presentation, then we can look at it,? he said. ?It?s not out of the question.? 

Majola said that South Africa would advertise the vacancy of national team coach after England?s tour ends on Sunday. Ray Jennings has been appointed interim coach until June. 

?Jennings is in an advantageous position just by being involved with the team,? Majola said. ?He?s done a good job up to now, he?s followed his mandate.? 

The process of appointing a new coach would take up to two months, Majola said. 

Majola also has moved to end speculation that South African cricket is losing top players because it is politically driven. 

Several South Africans, including England?s Kevin Pietersen, have left the country in recent years.

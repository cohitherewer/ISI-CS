Calcutta: Defensive worries dog Mohun Bagan on the eve of their National League encounter against Fransa Pax Club of Goa on Saturday. 

The green-maroons had hoped to sign Nigerian defender Ajibade Babalade prior to the sixth round of the National League tie for the ONGC Cup, but he couldn?t be registered as his international transfer certificate (ITC) arrived only on Friday. 

According to AIFF rules, a player can take to the field only if he is signed 48 hours before the match. But since Babalade signed on Friday, he will not be eligible to play. 

The team has been further hamstrung by double booking to Brazilian stopper Eduardo Coelho. Midfielder Noel Wilson is expected to take his place. 

The 0-2 defeat to Dempo Sports Club of Goa in their previous match is weighing heavily on Mohun Bagan and Wilson felt the only way that could be overcome is by winning against Fransa. 

?It?s a marathon league, but we need to win against Fransa to be in contention for the title. We will be going all out and have to perform, since we didn?t do well against Dempo,? he said on Friday. 

His words were echoed by coach Subrata Bhattacharya. ?I am sure the boys will be playing well. We need to win,? he said. 

Their opponent, however, are treading a cautious line. ?We don?t want to return empty-handed,? said goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey, who missed the last tie against Tollygunge Agragami due to injury but is expected to start against Mohun Bagan. 

?Losing two consecutive away matches will put pressure on us and we want to avoid that. Hence, Saturday?s match is very crucial. Even if we don?t get three points, we will be satisfied with one.? 

The custodian went on to add: ?Having lost their last tie Mohun Bagan will be coming hard at us. We are expecting a difficult match.? 

Coach Norbert Gonsalves also said that they would be happy with a single point. ?A win will be a bonus, but a draw won?t be bad either.? 

Both Mohun Bagan and Fransa have seven points from five outings, but while the home team is placed seventh, the visitors are fourth with a better goal average.

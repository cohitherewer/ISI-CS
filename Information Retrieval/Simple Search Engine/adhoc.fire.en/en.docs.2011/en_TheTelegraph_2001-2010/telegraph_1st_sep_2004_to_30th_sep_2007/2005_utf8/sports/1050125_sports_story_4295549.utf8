Madrid: Real Madrid clawed back to within seven points of Primera Liga leaders Barcelona after a hard-fought 3-1 home win over relegation prospects Real Mallorca on Sunday. 

A Luis Figo penalty, a tap-in by defender Walter Samuel and a brilliant shot from substitute Santiago Solari in injury time secured the victory that puts Madrid on 41 points from 20 games. 

Meanwhile, Samuel will undergo surgery after breaking his nose in the match. The 26-year-old Argentine international suffered a multiple fracture after a clash of heads with Mallorca striker Bernardo Romeo in the first half. Real said on Monday that Samuel would have the operation on Tuesday to help reduce inflammation and immobilise the bone. 

Their battling display keeps Real?s slim title hopes alive after Barcelona beat Racing Santander 3-0 on Saturday. 

Third-placed Valencia fell further off the pace after losing 1-3 at Villarreal thanks to a hattrick from Argentine playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme who put on an inspired performance. 

Valencia are 12 points behind Barcelona. 

Espanyol slipped to fifth place after a 4-1 drubbing at Deportivo Coruna with the Galician side finding the key to unlock what had been the Primera Liga?s tightest defence. Sevilla moved into the fourth Champions League qualifying spot with a comfortable 2-0 victory at lowly Albacete. 

Meanwhile in England, Chelsea are now 10 points clear of Arsenal, who beat Newcastle United 1-0 at Highbury, and 11 ahead of Manchester United, who won 3-1 against plucky visitors Aston Villa. 

In Serie A, Juventus extended their lead at the top to five points after they defeated Brescia 2-0 and closest rivals AC Milan lost at Livorno. 

David Trezeguet?s close range finish and Maurizio Domizzi?s own goal ensured three valuable points for Juve. 

Juventus have 47 points from their 20 matches played, while AC Milan have 42, eight more than third-placed Udinese who crashed to a 0-2 home defeat to Calabrian side Reggina.

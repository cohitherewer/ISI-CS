 Opportunities create appeals: Steve

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Steve Waugh doesn?t believe the Aussies intimidate umpires through their appealing. Responding to former New Zealand opener Mark Richardson?s observation that international umpires are in awe of Australians, Steve said: ?It?s just that the Aussies create more opportunities and when you create more opportunities there is bound to be more appealing? 

?The Aussies are definitely the best side by quite a distance.? The former Australian captain visited Eden Gardens in the morning and also briefly spoke to the India under-19 players. 

?It?s a wonderful ground and I love coming back here,? Steve said. Coach Venkatesh Prasad, who requested Steve to meet the players, said he stressed on the need to have the right attitude.

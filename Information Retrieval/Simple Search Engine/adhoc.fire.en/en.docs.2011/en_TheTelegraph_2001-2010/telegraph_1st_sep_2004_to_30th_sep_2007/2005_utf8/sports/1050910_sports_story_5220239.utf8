 Bhupathi, Hantuchova capture crown 

New York: Mahesh Bhupathi won his ninth Grand Slam title when he lifted the mixed doubles crown with Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia at the US Open late on Thursday (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

Bhupathi and Hantuchova needed an hour and a minute to beat Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia and Katherina Srebotnik of Slovakia 6-4, 6-2. 

It was a special moment for Hantuchova, who, thus, completed a full set of Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. This was also her second major mixed doubles crown of the year after triumphing at the French Open with Fabrice Santoro. 

On the hand, this was Bhupathis five Grand Slam mixed doubles title. Interestingly, he won all of them with different partners. 

In the final, Bhupathi and Hantuchova were in good form. The Indian, in particular, was dominant at the net. The duo capitalised on some poor net play by Zimonjic to gain a break in the seventh game of the first set. 

Bhupathi and Haneutchova were immediately up 1-0 in the second set, breaking Zimonjic when his partner Srebotnik put a high forehand wide. They then forced three break-points on Srebotniks serve in the seventh game and went up 5-2. 

Zimonjic and Srebotnik made late fight as they forced a triple break-point on Hantuchovas serve. But it was all too late and Bhupathi intercepted a backhand service return from Zimonjic to seal the match. 

We had a lot of fun, Bhupathi said after the win. We saved a match point in the first round and after that she (Hantuchova) told me were probably going to win it now. 

It feels great, Hantuchova later said. This was the last one I was missing and finally I got it, thanks to an unbelievable partner at my side. Im so happy right now.

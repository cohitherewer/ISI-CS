 NZ reach 452 on Day I

 New Zealands Brendon McCullum after scoring his century in Harare on Sunday 

Harare: Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori blazed centuries to turn New Zealands fortunes around on the first day of the first Test against Zimbabwe on Sunday. 

McCullum scored 111 and Daniel Vettori made 127, the fastest Test century by a New Zealander, to guide the visitors to 452 for nine at stumps after they were sent in to bat. 

The aggressive McCullum drove, cut and pulled with gusto from the outset after arriving at the crease with New Zealand teetering on 113 for five. 

McCullum faced 112 balls and hit 15 fours and a six. He and captain Stephen Fleming, who scored 73, steadied the innings with their sixth-wicket partnership of 120. 

The less elegant but equally effective Vettori smashed and grabbed his runs off 98 balls with 20 fours and two sixes. 

He reached his century off a record 82 balls with 15 fours, and was yorked by Heath Streak two overs before the close.

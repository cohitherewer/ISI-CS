Ahmedabad: If you thought Greg Chappell was feeling the heat following the tidal wave of sympathy that has engulfed the nation after Sourav Gangulys removal, he is not willing to show it. The Indian coach appeared relaxed at practice and even showed good humour when responding to questions at the media conference. 

He knows only success can divert the attention of fans from the hot topic. Ive never been the sort who will be happy sitting on a 1-0 lead, said Chappell, making his intentions clear at the outset. 

If the Indian coach was perturbed by Rahul Dravids illness and his subsequent unavailability, he was not speaking his mind. He merely dwelt on the aspect that the team had got some good backup. 

The third Test of the Videocon series, which gets underway in nearby Motera Sunday, has two milestones waiting to happen ? Anil Kumbles 100th match and Virender Sehwags debut as captain. 

Sehwag was unavailable for the Kotla match after a bout of viral fever. He has since recovered, though the bug has laid low Sri Lankas Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando. 

 Kumble will be the fifth Indian after Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar to have achieved the feat. 

The Indians, already 1-0 up, are eyeing a series victory that will ensure they climb up to second spot in ICC rankings after Australia. 

Kumbles bowling has been an eye opener in Delhi. He has proved yet again that despite advancing years he has not lost a wee bit of his accuracy and effectiveness. 

No less successful has been Harbhajan Singh. He may not have picked too many wickets but his variation and versatility at the other end has made things a tad easier for Kumble. 

The pitch looks the same as seen during the one-dayer? Looks a good scoring game is on the cards, was Moodys reading. It will be battle of wits and patience, felt Chappell. 

The Indians, who have included Mohammed Kaif and Wasim Jaffer in the XII, are toying with the idea of playing both Gambhir and Jaffer. In such a scenario, Sehwag may come in at No. 3. 

Jaffer, too, has impressed Chappell. He looks very organised and will do well if and when the opportunity comes. 

The coach, one learns, wants to have a look at Jaffer before the Pakistan tour. But that will mean Kaif having to sit out. 

The Lankans have come to realise the hard way that Muttiah Muralidharans ? the off-spinner is reported to be fit ? efforts alone wont be enough to push the Indians into a shell. 

 Vaas and Fernandos illness has further complicated their team composition here. 

The Lankans are likely to try out Lasith Malinga, the pace bowler with a slingshot action, as a surprise weapon in place of Fernando. There is also a possibility of Upul Tharanga replacing Avishka Gunawardene at the top of the order.

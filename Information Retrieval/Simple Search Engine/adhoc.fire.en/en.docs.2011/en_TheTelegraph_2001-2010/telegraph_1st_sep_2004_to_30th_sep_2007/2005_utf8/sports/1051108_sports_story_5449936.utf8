Madrid: Champions Barcelona produced imperious form to complete an emphatic 3-1 win over Getafe that allowed them to regain second spot in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

A second-minute strike from Samuel Eto, a slick finish from midfielder Ludovic Giuly and a sweetly struck Thiago Motta free kick helped Barcelona end Getafes 11-month unbeaten home record and secure the Catalans a fourth league win in a row. 

The victory came as an ominous warning to arch rivals Real Madrid who scraped a 1-0 win at home to Real Zaragoza thanks to a late penalty from Roberto Carlos. 

The two sides meet at the Bernabeu in their next league match in two weeks time. 

Surprise packages Osasuna top the table with 24 points from 11 games after inflicting a first home defeat of the season on Real Sociedad with a 2-1 win at Anoeta on Saturday. 

Barcelona lie second on 22, a point ahead of Real and two clear of Celta Vigo who notched a 2-1 victory at home to struggling Alaves earlier on Sunday. 

The Catalans could hardly have made a better start against Getafe with Eto notching up his 10th league goal of the season with just over a minute on the clock. 

The Cameroon international drilled home at the near post when Silvinho laid the ball off to him after pouncing on a sloppy pass from defender Ruben Pulido. 

Getafe bravely tried to fight their way back into the match, but were unable to keep pace with the Catalans who extended their lead with a superbly fashioned second. 

Ronaldinho picked out Eto with a lofted pass, the striker controlled with his chest and squared the ball to Giuly who steered home with his first touch. 

Midfielder Motta wrapped up the win and took his sides tally to 18 goals in five games when he curled a free kick into the corner 19 minutes from time. 

Argentine defender Mariano Pernia grabbed a late consolation for Getafe, however, with one of the candidates for goal of the season when he sent a wonderful 20-metre volley into the far corner. 

An injury-hit Real made a promising start at the Bernabeu with centre-backs Jonathan Woodgate and Sergio Ramos putting early pressure on the Zaragoza defence from two David Beckham free kicks. 

The unfortunate Woodgate, however, hobbled off the pitch with a hamstring injury after 23 minutes. 

Real soon lost their momentum and, although Beckham swept in a succession of dangerous crosses into the area, his forwards were unable to take advantage. 

Robinho was denied by a fine reflex save by former Real Madrid keeper Cesar on 25 minutes and again at the start of the second half while Raul ballooned a header over the bar, all three chances created by Beckham. 

Zaragoza then seized control of the game, Argentine striker Diego Milito slamming a close-range shot against the woodwork and Real old boy Savio being denied by a superb point-blank save from Casillas. 

Just as Real appeared to be wilting under the pressure, however, Robinho won a penalty when he went down in the area. 

Cesar saved the Brazilians spot kick but three minutes later he earned another and compatriot Roberto Carlos took the ball and slammed it past his former team mate. 

AC Milan, meanwhile, crushed Udinese 5-1 to rack up their eighth successive Serie A win but stayed second behind Juventus, who enjoyed a smooth 3-0 win over Livorno. 

Juventus now have 30 points from 11 matches, two ahead of Milan and five clear of third-placed Fiorentina who beat Ascoli 2-0. 

Elsewhere, Chievo Verona beat Siena 1-0 to climb to fifth on 19 points, one fewer than Inter Milan who drew 0-0 with Lazio on Saturday. AS Roma climbed to sixth with a 2-0 victory over Messina. 

Livornos resistance finally cracked on the hour. Patrick Vieira hoisted a long ball into the area and Ibrahimovic conjured up a spectacular lob-volley over Amelia. 

A minute later Trezeguet grabbed Juventus second, his fifth goal in four matches, with a header from Gianluca Zambrottas cross. 

Having lost control of the game, Livornos players began to lose their discipline. Diego de Ascentis was red-carded for kicking out at Adrian Mutu and Alessandro Del Piero wrapped up the result with a goal on the break in stoppage time. 

Milan wasted little time breaking down Udinese, taking the lead in the 25th minute, when Alberto Gilardino gathered Filippo Inzaghis low cross, turned his marker and poked the ball past keeper Gabriele Paoletti. 

Inzaghi was instrumental in creating the second goal too, teeing up the ball on the edge of the area for Clarence Seedorf to blast into the bottom corner. 

Andrea Pirlo added Milans third with a free kick on the stroke of half-time and Gilardino got his second shortly after the restart. 

Udinese striker Vincenzo Iaquinta pulled one back from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Gennaro Gattuso, but Kaka completed the rout 13 minutes from time.

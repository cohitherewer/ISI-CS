The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jury fails to reach verdict

 - LINEKER-KEWELL LIBEL CASE 

 Gary Lineker 

London: A jury hearing Australian international Harry Kewells high court libel battle against former England striker Gary Lineker and The Sunday Telegraph was discharged by the judge on Thursday. 

After a seven-day hearing, a jury of six men and six women could not reach a verdict. Kewell took libel action following comments in a newspaper article written by Lineker over the Australians move to Liverpool in 2003. 

There was no immediate decision on a re-trial or allocation of costs, estimated at ?200,000 ($364,500). 

Its in our hands because we are bringing this claim, Kewells lawyer Chris Farnell told Sky Sports News. I need to sit down with Harry and see what he wants to do. 

Asked if Kewell was disappointed with the verdict, Farnell added: He has to take time to think in relation to that. I didnt get a reaction from him in that sense at all. I think we have a very strong case but its up to Harry to decide which way we go. 

Lineker, who looked impassive as the judge dismissed the jury, told reporters he was surprised by the judges decision. 

It looks as if it could be a replay. But I cant say anything else because we dont know what is happening. 

Lineker wrote in the article that Kewell and his agent Bernie Mandic had cleverly circumvented the sports rules on transfer negotiations. 

Both men denied any wrongdoing in Kewells ?5 million move to Liverpool which earned Mandic a fee of ?2 million ($3.62 million).

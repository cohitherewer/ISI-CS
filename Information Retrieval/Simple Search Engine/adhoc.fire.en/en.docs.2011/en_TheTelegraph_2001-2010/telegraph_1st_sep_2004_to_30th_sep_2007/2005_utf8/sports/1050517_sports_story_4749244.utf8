 Injury rules Henry out

London: Arsenal suffered a major blow when French striker Thierry Henry was ruled out of Saturdays FA Cup final against Manchester United. Henry, the Premier Leagues top scorer, had suffered a recurrence of a long-standing Achilles problem, the club said on Monday. 

Henry did not feature in Arsenals final league game against Birmingham City on Sunday which they lost 2-1. He had played 45 minutes in midweek after returning from a groin injury in the 7-0 thrashing of Everton. 

Henry, scorer of 25 league goals, has had an exhausting season. He played every first team game for Arsenal ? excluding the League Cup ? until January when he was rested for the FA Cup third round match with Stoke City. 

Arsenal have played in three of the last four FA Cup finals but Henry is yet to score in the showpiece occasion.

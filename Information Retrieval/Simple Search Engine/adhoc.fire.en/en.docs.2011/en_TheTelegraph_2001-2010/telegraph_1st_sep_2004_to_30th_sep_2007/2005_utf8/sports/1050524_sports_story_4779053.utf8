 Challenge for Montgomerie

London: Three-time winner Colin Montgomerie goes into this weeks BMW Championship at Wentworth requiring a top-five finish to secure his place at Pinehurst for next months US Open. 

Montgomerie, ranked 53rd in the world, needs to return to the top-50 by next Monday if he is to book a berth in the second of the years four major championships. 

The seven-time European No. 1 could qualify for the US Open with a top-16 finish at Wentworth, but other factors would have to go his way, according to world rankings organiser Ian Barker. 

A top-five finish at Wentworth would definitely do it for Montgomerie but there are a few variables, Barker said on Monday. 

There are two guys not playing in the US or at Wentworth this week ? Australias Mark Hensby and American Jonathan Kaye ? who will have a direct bearing on what will happen with the worlds top-50 for next week. 

Hensby, currently ranked 45th, is projected into 44th place for next Monday while Kaye, currently 51st, is projected at 50th. 

Barker said anyone who could overhaul Hensbys points average total by Monday would cement a top-50 ranking. 

For Montgomerie, outright fifth or better at Wentworth would send him past Hensby while 16th place would send him past Kaye, added Barker.

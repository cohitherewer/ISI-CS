 Barcelona crush Zaragoza, extend lead 

 - EURO ROUND-UP 

- Samuel Eto?o faces racial abuse

Madrid: Barcelona increased their lead at the top of the Primera Liga to a provisional seven points with a 4-1 win at Real Zaragoza on Saturday. 

Champions Valencia?s faint hopes of retaining their crown faded even further with a 1-2 home defeat by Deportivo la Coruna that leave them trailing Barcelona by 16 points. 

Barcelona, who faced a shock 0-2 defeat to Atletico Madrid in their last match, teamed up well to notch up a win at the La Romareda stadium since 1997. 

Zaragoza fell behind to an own goal by defender Delio Toledo in the second minute as he tried to fend off Ludovic Giuly, and the French international was on target himself after half an hour to increase Barcelona?s lead. 

Samuel Eto?o put the game beyond the home side when he found the net nine minutes later and although Luciano Galletti scored in the second half, Mexico international Rafael Marquez sealed the victory with a header in the 71st minute. 

However, the match was marred by racial chants directed against Eto?o. He was greeted by monkey chants when he touched the ball and peanuts were thrown on to the pitch after he scored. 

Eto?o, who scored his 17th goal of season, said that his celebratory dance after scoring was a response to the racist abuse he received during the game. 

?I danced like a monkey because they treated me like a monkey,? said the 24-year-old Cameroon international, who is widely expected to be named African Player of the Year for the second season in succession next week. 

Referee Fernando Carmona Mendez did not mention the incidents in his match report, commenting only that the behaviour of the crowd was ?normal?. 

Several clubs have been fined for the racist behaviour of their fans this season but the Spanish Football Federation cannot take any action unless the incidents have been reported by the referee. 

Deportivo went some way to wiping out the painful memory of a crushing 1-5 defeat at home to Valencia earlier this season as they cheered their fans with just their second win in 11 games. 

In Italy, two Sinisa Mihajlovic free kicks gave Inter Milan a 2-0 victory over AS Roma on Saturday and moved them into third spot in Serie A. 

Inter jumped two points ahead of Udinese to 42 from 24 matches, eight behind leaders Juventus. 

The 35-year-old defender broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute, when he curled the ball past Ivan Pelizzoli from a wide position outside the area. 

Roma pressed forward in search of an equaliser and only a last-ditch tackle by defender Ivan Cordoba prevented Vincenzo Montella finishing from close range just before the break. 

They continued to look lively in the second half but were unable to find a chink in the home side?s defence. Their hopes ended in the first minute of stoppage time, when Philippe Mexes was sent off for a second bookable offence and Mihajlovic rifled in the resulting free-kick to seal victory. (Reuters)

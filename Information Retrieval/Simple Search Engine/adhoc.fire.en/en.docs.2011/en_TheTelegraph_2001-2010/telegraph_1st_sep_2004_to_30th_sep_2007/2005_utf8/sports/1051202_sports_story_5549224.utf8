Hong Kong: South Korean Kang Wook-soon left some of Europes top players in his wake by shooting a six-under-par 64 for a one-stroke first round lead at the Hong Kong Open on Thurs-day. 

Both Briton Colin Montgomerie and defending champion Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain shot modest 69s to lie five shots off the pace at the $1.2 million event, which is jointly sanctioned by the European and Asian tours. 

Wook-soon, twice winner of Asian Order of Merit, shot six bogies, including five in a row to the 17th hole, to get an excellent start to a tournament he won in 1998. 

One shot behind Kang were Martin Erlandsson of Sweden, Jyoti Randhawa of India and Canadian Rick Gibson. Englands Richard McEvoy, Frenchman Francois Delamontange and Soren Kjeldsen of Denmark are a further stroke behind. 

I was misreading the greens at the start, said 39-year-old Kang. 

And then I also thought of the memories of my win back in 1998 and suddenly everything started to fall into place. 

Montgomery, European Order of Merit winner for 2005, got off to a poor start following a bogey at the second and a double bogey at the third in what is techni-cally his second tournament of the 2006 season. 

But four more birdies to add to the one he hit at the first hole helped him bounce back to respectability at the par-70 Hong Kong Golf Club course in Fanling. 

Two over after three is not a great start, but it was nice to get back into red figures at the end of the day, he said. 

I could have shot a 66, but it is no big deal. There are three more rounds to go. 

Spains Jimenez only managed two birdies all day as he struggled with his putting to also finish five shots off the pace. 

I hit the ball okay, but I didnt put it close to the hole as I would have liked, he said. It could have been worse but an under par round is never bad. 

I only had one bogey though which was pretty good. It was a solid start and I just hope that I can hit it a little closer the rest of the week and hole a few more putts. 

Ryder Cup star Paul Casey, winner of the China Open last week, failed to make the most of perfect conditions and floundered to a disappoint- ing 74.

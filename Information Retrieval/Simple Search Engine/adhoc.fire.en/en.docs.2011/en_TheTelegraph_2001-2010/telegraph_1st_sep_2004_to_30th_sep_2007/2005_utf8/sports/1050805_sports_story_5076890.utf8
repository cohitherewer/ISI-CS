Birmingham: Australia, deprived of the services of Glenn McGrath following a freak injury before play started, weathered a battering before dismissing England for 407 on an enthralling opening day of the second Test on Thursday. 

Australia looked set for a tricky 20-minute batting before stumps only for rain to end play early. The home side, 0-1 down in the five-match series after being outclassed at Lords, dominated the first two sessions as they galloped to 289 for four at tea, with Marcus Trescothick making 90. 

Kevin Pietersen, with a run-a-ball 71, and Andrew Flintoff, with an even quicker 68 including five sixes and six fours, put on a century stand for the fifth wicket to keep England on top. But the world champions, who put England in on a slow-paced Edgbaston pitch, kept chipping away to take the last six wickets for 117. Shane Warne cleaned up the tail to take four for 116. 

It was Englands best score on the first day of a Test against any opposition since World War II. In all, their batsmen hit 10 sixes and 54 fours in 79.2 overs as they averaged over five an over. 

Flintoff said: We are pleased with the total and the fashion we got it. I think weve had a decent day. 

Pietersen, who has now hit three half-centuries in his first three Test innings, said: We lost the toss and we were chucked in. I think we did well. 

The 35-year-old McGrath, Man of the Match in the first Test with nine wickets, stepped on a cricket ball during a game of touch rugby in the morning and damaged ligaments in his right ankle. He is doubtful for the third Test at Old Trafford too. 

Michael Kasprowicz, McGraths replacement, took three for 80. Strike bowler Brett Lee, however, suffered. Hit for a string of sixes. 

Englands approach on Thursday was in stark contrast to the first Test when, strangled by McGrath and Warne, they made only 155 in their first innings and 180 in the second. 

This time there were early boundaries to all parts, Trescothick hammering three of them off Lee through extra cover in the third over of the day. When Jason Gillespie did get it right, the edge from Andrew Strauss bat skimmed low to first slip where Warne failed to hold on to the chance with his left hand. Even Warne could not help initially. 

Strauss, who made 48 in an opening stand of 112, kicked away his first three balls, then drove him over his head for four. Next over, he hit two more boundaries. 

Trescothick joined in with a straight drive for six, and then hit an upper-cut six off Lee and three more fours as 18 came off six balls.

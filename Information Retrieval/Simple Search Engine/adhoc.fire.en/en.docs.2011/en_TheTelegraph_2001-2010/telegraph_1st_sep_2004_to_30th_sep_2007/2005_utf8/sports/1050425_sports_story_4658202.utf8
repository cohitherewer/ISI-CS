 SA chase victory 

 - Ntini, Nel rip through Windies top-order 

 Kallis contributed with 78 runs 

Bridgetown: Pace bowlers Makhaya Ntini and Andre Nel ripped through the West Indies top-order to give South Africa a glimpse of victory on Day IV of the third Test in Barbados on Sunday. 

The West Indies, who need 252 to make South Africa bat again, limped to lunch on 36 for three in their second innings after the tourists had declared on 548 for nine having batted on for just 5.5 overs of the morning session. 

Ntini bowled a bristling first spell of four overs in which he took two for eight, while Nel took one for 12 from six overs. 

The West Indies? problems began in the sixth over when Chris Gayle fended a delivery from Ntini to Graeme Smith at first slip to be dismissed for five. 

Ramnaresh Sarwan came in and took his eye off the first delivery he faced, the ball catching the shoulder of his bat and flying to Herschelle Gibbs at third slip at the end of Ntini?s third over. 

Nel struck two balls later when Wavell Hinds, who scored 11, played forward and edged to Gibbs again at third slip. 

The West Indies were reeling at 17 for three in the seventh over having lost three wickets in the space of four balls without the addition of a run. 

Brian Lara was in next and defended confidently against Ntini?s hattrick ball. 

Earlier on Saturday, Abraham de Villiers, Boeta Dippenaar and Jacques Kallis earned South Africa a commanding lead. Opener De Villiers scored a career-best 178, Dippenaar made 71 and Kallis hit 78.

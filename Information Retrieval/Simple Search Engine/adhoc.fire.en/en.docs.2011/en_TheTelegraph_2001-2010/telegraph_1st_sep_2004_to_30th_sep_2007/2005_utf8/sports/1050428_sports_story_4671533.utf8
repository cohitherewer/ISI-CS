Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will leave for Ludhiana Thursday morning with little promise and one foot in the ?demotion? ditch. 

With just three rounds to go and the team staring relegation from the National Football League?s elite tier, coach Amal Dutta has warned the wards of a make-or-break battle. 

?We have no option but to win all the three matches,? the veteran coach said after the team?s practice Wednesday morning. 

Mohun Bagan take on JCT away Saturday and then return to host Tollygunge Agragami on May 5. The date of their final-round match ? against Churchill Brothers at home ? is yet to be announced. 

Ashim Biswas, who had said earlier that he was ready to serve the club?s cause under exigency, didn?t turn up at practice and is not going to Ludhiana. Injured Rennedy Singh has also been ruled out. But in a late development, Noel Wilson had been declared match-fit and will accompany the squad. 

After 19 rounds, Mohun Bagan are placed ninth with 18 points, ahead of SBT (14), Tollygunge Agragami (16) and Vasco SC (17). Churchill Brothers have slightly improved their position by beating Mahindra United in their last match and are now on 20 points. 

Four teams will move down from the NFL elite tier. 

Current leaders East Bengal, on the other hand, will face Salgaocar in Goa and Mahindra in Mumbai on May Day and May 4, respectively. 

Coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, believes Mohun Bagan won?t be demoted. ?They can?t? I don?t believe they?ll relegate,? he insisted. 

Bhaichung Bhutia amp; Co. did light practice. ?I want to face the away matches with as less pressure as possible,? Bhowmick said. 

Debjit Ghosh felt that Tollygunge, by holding Sporting Clube de Goa, helped their cause to a great extent. ?It?s now up to us to complete the job,? he said. 

While Debjit was speaking of a ?mission? to complete, there was none on the other side of the fence, in the green-maroon camp, with such vision. 

Instead, Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra?s camp, on Wednesday, held a protest at the club tent, asking for removal of the high court-appointed special officers from the club?s football-related affairs. 

Mitra is also not keen to accompany the squad in Ludhiana.

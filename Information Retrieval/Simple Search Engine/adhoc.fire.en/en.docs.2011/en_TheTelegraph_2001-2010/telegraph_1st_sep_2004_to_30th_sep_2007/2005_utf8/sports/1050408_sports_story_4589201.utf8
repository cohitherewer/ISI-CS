 Salgaocar down Vasco

Margao: Riding on Fabio dos Passos? solo effort in the first half, Salgaocar edged past Vasco by a solitary goal to earn full points in the 16th round of the National Football League at the Nehru Stadium here Thursday. 

Salgaocar held territorial advantage in the first half and created more scoring chances. 

Fabio Passos, who played upfront along with Felix Ibrebru, missed a couple of chances but made amends in the 35th minute when he ran solo almost from the centreline, beat defender Kamal Thapa and on entering the box got past the onrushing ?keeper Virender Singh before placing the ball into the empty net. 

Salgaocar now have 19 points from 16 matches while Vasco stay in 11th place. (PTI)

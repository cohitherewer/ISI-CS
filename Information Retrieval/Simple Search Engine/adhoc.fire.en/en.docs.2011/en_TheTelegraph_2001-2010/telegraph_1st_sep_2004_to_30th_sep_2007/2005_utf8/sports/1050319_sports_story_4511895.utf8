 Shift to Pak if May deadline is not met

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

New Delhi: The ICC Friday said it would relocate next year?s Champions Trophy to Pakistan if India failed to take a decision on giving tax-exemption by May. 

?The board has resolved that the 2006 Champions Trophy be held in India subject to clearance on tax matters,? ICC chief Ehsan Mani said here after the ICC?s two-day executive board meeting. 

?We understand that the government and the BCCI need more time. So we will wait till May,? said Mani, who had held talks with the Indian officials last month asking for 100 per cent tax exemption. 

?I had talks with Mr P. Chidambaram and Mr Sunil Dutt, both of whom gave a patient hearing. At this stage I believe his (finance) ministry is looking into the matter. So obviously nothing to be concerned. 

?But we have given them a deadline till May. We want a 100 per cent exemption. Tax is an issue when you plan to host major events like F1 and tennis.? 

Mani said he was not in favour of the Indian cricket board offering to bear the taxes so that the event could be staged in the country. ?It would be unfair for the ICC to expect the BCCI to do so. Anyway, the BCCI is in touch with relevant authorities,? he said. 

Decisions were taken at the meeting on many important issues. 

The ICC decided to give official status to all the Super Series matches ? the three one-dayers and a six-day match to be played between Australia and the World XI in Melbourne. 

The board also voted to extend the term of ICC president Ehsan Mani by 12 months, which means Mani, who has been in office for the last 21 months, will continue till June next year.

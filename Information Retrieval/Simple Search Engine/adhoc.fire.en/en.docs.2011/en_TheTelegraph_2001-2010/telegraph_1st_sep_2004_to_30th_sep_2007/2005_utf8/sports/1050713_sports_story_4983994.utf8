 Aussies blow England away

London: Australia, with the irrepressible Adam Gilchrist back at centre stage, completed a timely Ashes warning by routing England by eight wickets to win their one-day series 2-1 on Tuesday. 

With the first Test just over a week away, the world champions produced a clinical performance, first to restrict England to 228 for seven, then to win with 15.1 overs to spare. 

Gilchrist, owing his teammates more than a hard-hit cameo, blitzed 121 not out, his highest score of the English summer. He scored his runs off 101 balls, hitting two sixes and 17 fours. 

Jason Gillespie, though, was as much a cherry on top of the Australian cake. Woefully off-colour and struggling for form, the fast bowler bounced back with three for 44, including the wicket of Kevin Pietersen. 

Pietersen, the one England highlight and hoping to be selected for the first Test at Lords starting next Thursday, made 74 off 84 balls, including two sixes, before going off the field during Australias reply with a groin strain. 

Australia, beaten in the series opener at Headingley, outclassed their hosts at Lords on Sunday and repeated the dose at The Oval on Tuesday. 

England, put in and tied down, lost five wickets for 49 to slump to 93 for six, forcing Michael Vaughan to replace pace bowler Simon Jones, who had yet to get on the field, with supersub batsman Vikram Solanki. 

The ploy reduced English blushes just a shade, Solanki making 53 not out and putting on 93 with Pietersen to give the home side a total to defend. 

But Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden soon made a nonsense of the contest. When Hayden lashed three fours off Darren Goughs second over, Gilchrist trumped him with four tracer-bullet boundaries off the next from Steve Harmison. 

The pair scored 45 in the first five overs ? England had taken 13 overs to get to 44 for two ? and got to 91 before Hayden, on 31, edged Gough behind. 

Gilchrist just carried on. At times, he seems to obey different rules compared to other batsmen. Holding the bat right at the top of the handle, he swung at everything and everything seemed to go for four, whether off the middle, the splice or the edge. 

Ponting, meanwhile, who made a century at Lords 

on Sunday, also looked back to his best. Two shots, consecutive needle-threading 

on-drives for four off Andrew Flintoff, said it all. He made 44 off 43 balls before 

being stumped off Ashley Giles. (reuters)

San Luis: Viswanathan Anand overshadowed Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan to emerge clear third after the 11th round of the World Chess Championship here. Kasimdzhanov had beaten Anand in their previous meeting in the championship. 

The fourth victory by the Indian ace also helped him move within two points of championship leader Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria who survived a scare before drawing against Michael Adams of England. 

In the other decisive game of the day, Peter Svidler made his bid for the second place, defeating Alexander Morozevich of Russia, while Judit Polgar held fellow Hungarian Peter Leko. 

With just three rounds remaining in the $1 million event, Topalov inched closer to the world title, moving to 8.5 points out of a possible 11. 

Svidler took his tally to 7 points while Anand is on 6.5 points. Morozevich fell behind after losing to Svidler but maintained the sole fourth spot on 5.5. Leko is next in line on 5, half point ahead of Kasimdzhanov, while Adams is placed seventh on 4 points. 

Judit Polgar, on three points, is almost certain to finish last. 

Playing the white side of an English attack, Anand came up with a surprise knight manoeuvre that rattled Kasimdzhanov right from the early stages of the middlegame. 

Once the pieces got together in the centre, Kasimdzhanov knew the end was not far. Anand got his rook to the seventh rank to register a satisfying victory in just 29 moves. 

Adams came close to causing a sensation, but Topalov managed to survive. 

It was a Sicilian Scheveningen in which Adams, playing white, first sacrificed a pawn and gained control of the weakened dark squares around the black king, later winning an exchange through a knight sortie. 

However the English came up with a temporary rook sacrifice to pierce the black king side which was only good enough for a draw in 45 moves. 

Morozevich failed to put up the desired resistence against Svidler in a slightly inferior endgame arising out of a Peroff Defence. 

Playing white, Svidler tightened the noose around the blacks weakened pawn structure and knocked down one pawn. 

However, once on top, Svidler showed signs of complacency as his technique was found wanting to convert the winning bishop and pawns endgame. 

Simultaneously, Morozevich was also completely off colour and after 70 moves Svidler eventually got the important full point he was looking for. 

In the next round, Svidler will have black pieces against Topalov and fortunes of the championship can change only in the unlikely event of a Svidler victory. 

Anand will play with black pieces against Morozevich in the other important clash. 

In the other game of the day, Polgar held Leko in just 25 moves.

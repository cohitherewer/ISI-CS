 Sukhwinder yet to get any intimation 

New Delhi: Even as the date for the proposed appearance of national coach Sukhwinder Singh before All India Football Federation (AIFF) draws near, confusion reigned supreme as neither the date nor the agenda of the meeting seems to have been decided as yet. 

To make matters worse, Sukhwinder is yet to get an official intimation about appearing before the AIFF chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and what he needs to explain. 

I havent received any communication from the federation and cant comment on what I am required to do at the meeting, Sukhwinder said over phone, adding whatever I have heard in this regard is through the media only. 

The AIFF Executive Committee, in its meeting here on September 7, had decided to ask Sukhwinder to appear before Das Munshi on Thursday to present his future plans for the team. 

Sukhwinders job appears on the line following Indias 1-1 draw in Pakistan and 0-3 loss in Fiji. (PTI)

 Randhawa tied 27th

 Tiger Woods acknowledges cheers after completing his round at the WGC Championship in San Francisco on Thursday 

San Francisco: Indian ace Jyoti Randhawa opened the $7.5 million American Express WGC Championship with an even par 70 that placed him at tied 27th after the first round on Thursday. 

In a field that is quite easily one of the strongest in the world, Randhawa, the 2002 Asian Tour No. 1, made a fine comeback on the back nine with three successive birdies from fifth to seventh. 

Meanwhile, Colin Montgomerie fired by his first win in 19 months last week at Dunhill Links, carded a sizzling 64 to grab a three-stroke lead ahead of the worlds No. 1 and No. 2 players, Tiger Woods and Vijai Singh. 

John Daly, Mark Calcavecchia, Olin Browne, Sergio Garcia, David Howell, Fred Funk, Ian Poulter, Chad Campbell and Rod Pampling all shot a 67. 

Randhawa started on the 10th and immediately had a setback with a double bogey on the par-three 11th. He made up with birdies on the 14th and 16th, but two more bogeys on the 17th and 18th meant he was two over for the front nine. 

On the back, he hit birdies from fifth to seventh putting him one-under at that stage. But a bogey on eighth, the 17th hole for him, saw him fall back to par. 

Randhawa, who needed 27 putts, trailed first round leader Montgomerie, who is looking for his first win in the US, by six shots.

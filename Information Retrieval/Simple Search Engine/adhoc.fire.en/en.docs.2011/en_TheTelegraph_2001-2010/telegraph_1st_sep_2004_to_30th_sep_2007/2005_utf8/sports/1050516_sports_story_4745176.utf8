Rome: Amelie Mauresmo fought back from a set and a break down to win her second consecutive Rome Masters title by beating eighth seed Patty Schnyder 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday. 

It was a well-deserved win for Mauresmo, who went into the final with an impressive record in the Italian capital. 

The Frenchwoman was contesting her fifth Rome final in six years and had not drop-ped a set on way to Sundays final, while Schynders best previous result in Rome had been a semi-final back in 1997. 

Mauresmo had also won six of their last eight meetings, though the left-handed Schnyder had been in superb form all week, shattering Mar-ia Sharapovas hopes of claiming the world No. 1 spot when she defeated her in semis. 

From the start Schnyder used the same tactic that had worked effectively against the Russian, varying the pace and spin on her shots, making it difficult for her opponent. 

Mauresmos usually reliable groundstrokes flew long and wide. A wayward backhand gave Schnyder break-point in the third game. The Swiss then showed great anticipation to home in on a poor half-volley and flick back a crosscourt pass to seize control of the set. 

Four more errors by Mauresmo allowed Schnyder to stretch her lead to 5-2. Mauresmo hit back in the next game, creating three break-points, but Schnyder lifted her game each time before closing out the set with an ace. 

The second set went with serve until the fifth game, when Mauresmo netted the simplest of volleys to give Schnyder a break-point, which she converted with a great wrong-footing pass. 

Mauresmos bad-tempered discussion with umpire Romano Grillotti over whether a Schnyder first serve had landed wide failed to halt her new-found momentum and she fired a forehand down the line on the way to breaking for a 5-3 lead to level the match. 

The second seed then served out for the win.

 Mhambrey: Dont expect miracles 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Mhambrey takes charge on Saturday 

Calcutta: Paras Mhambrey arrives in the city on Saturday with an open mind. He knows Bengal havent done well over the past couple of years in the Ranji Trophy, barely managing to stay afloat in the Elite group. He is not looking at creating miracles and is focusing more on a steady progress. 

Im coming with a positive mind. I aim to focus on small things at all time. The process of growth has to be continuous. You cant expect miracles. 

You can only improve... Im looking at a steady progress, Mhambrey, who takes charge as Bengal coach Saturday, told The Telegraph on Friday from his Mumbai residence. 

I will stress more on the quality of practice and not the quantity? on issues that need special attention. I believe a short session of nets can be more useful than a prolonged one, he explained. 

Mhambrey, who was chief coach of Maharashtra last season and is just back from coaching North Maiden Head Cricket Club in England, has followed Bengals fortunes in the past few seasons closely. He has also done the necessary homework, having spoken to Rohan Gavaskar and Devang Gandhi already. 

Ive got a fair idea from them. Theres just no lack of talent. The team hasnt done on expected lines and is capable of going further. There is definitely something amiss. Once I have a first-hand knowledge of the players, selectors, officials and the structure, I can work on the improvement, he remarked. 

Mhambrey, though, hasnt managed to speak to Karsan Ghavri, his predecessor and currently in charge of Mumbai. 

He would not compromise on discipline, saying: Only if discipline is maintained, success will be achieved 

He is aware CAB has the latest software for analysing the players performances. Technological advancement has meant players getting to the root of their problem. Competition has increased manifold. Its difficult for an individual team to dominate. 

Mhambrey is also keen on speaking to former players and coaches like Arun Lal, Sambaran Banerjee, Ashok Malhotra and others. Their opinion is valuable and one can work on it. Im always open to suggestions and will approach them. I am coming with an open mind and certain assessment of the team. Others can always guide you.

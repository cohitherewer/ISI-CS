The Telegraph - Calcutta

 This is a big series... I?m aware of what?s expected of me: Dhoni

 - ?Keeper-batsman quits Railways, set to join Indian Airlines 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kochi: Mahendra Singh Dhoni was at his smashing 

best during the Team India nets on Friday. ?Arre Dhoni...? Harbhajan Singh 

pulled his leg, but coach John Wright had something substantial to say. 

?You kept picking the right balls... Good... You were 

good... In a match situation, look to getting fours and sixes... Just keep working 

hard,? is how he encouraged the wicketkeeper-batsman after five-six minutes of 

action. 

Dhoni, who made his one-day debut in Bangladesh last December, grinned from ear-to-ear. 

?Yes, I?m a bit excited at being hours away from my 

first match at home... However, I?m not getting carried away... Not allowing myself 

to get distracted by the occasion,? he told The Telegraph. 

Looking back on the three ODIs in Bangladesh, Dhoni said: ?That launching pad-exposure was good... I gained and, now, have to go forward... This is a big series and I?m aware of what?s expected of me...? 

Actually, the heat and humidity is about the only worry for Jharkhand?s first India cricketer. ?The itinerary is such that it?s going to get hotter and hotter,? he remarked. 

Dhoni?s parents (Pan and Devki) apparently wanted to see him in the India colours here, but the 23-year-old asked them to stay put in Ranchi. 

?Having the family around will mean more pressure... I?d rather establish myself first,? he pointed out. Well, his priorities can?t be faulted. 

Right now, Dhoni is seen as a one-day specialist. It?s in his hands (and gloves) to shake off that ?label? and work towards bigger things. 

Incidentally, Dhoni has quit Railways and is set to 

join Indian Airlines. ?I?m just awaiting the NOC,? he informed.

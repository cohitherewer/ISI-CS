Calcutta: East Bengal on Wednesday cleared the pending dues of Bhaichung Bhutia, but the move didnt pave the way for a fresh contract. 

Bhutia, who held a meeting with the East Bengal officials for about 20 minutes at the club tent, was learnt to have expressed his displeasure at not clearing his last seasons dues. 

I had a few differences with the club and those have been cleared, Bhutia said after the meeting. A senior East Bengal official also hoped that both parties would soon sit across the negotiation table. 

We cleared his dues today, but nothing concrete about a fresh contract with him was reached at the meeting, the official said. 

Its likely that the UB Group, sponsors of the club and which has the player as its brand ambassador, will play a key role in breaking the impasse. 

East Bengal, however, took exception to the way Bhutia was insisting on having his dues cleared before entering into a new contract. 

Meanwhile, former international Surajit Sengupta, also a former East Bengal captain, paid a surprise visit to the club during the teams practice under Subhas Bhowmick. He also had a brief meeting with the coach.

Springfield: This is what the world must look like in Tiger Woods nightmares. He is grinding in the stifling heat just to make the cut, his best shots unrewarded, his worst ones punished doubly. Giant tree limbs are falling out of nowhere at his feet. Arch-rival Phil Mickelson, his gleaming score staring down at Woods from every scoreboard, has already showered, downed a nice glass of Chardonnay and changed a couple of diapers somewhere in his blissful Daddy-land. 

Surely, this was the apocalypse. But no, this was reality early Friday evening, as Woods wrapped up a bizarre, exhilarating, unusually eventful second round of the 87th PGA Championship by two-putting for birdie on the 18th hole to squeak by into the third round and avoid what would have been his first missed cut ever in a major. And yet, does it even matter? 

Mickelson, after a brilliant early-morning round of 65, leads the tournament at the mid-point with a score of eight-under-par 132, three shots ahead of Jerry Kelly (135) and four shots ahead of a trio of golfers that includes 1997 PGA champion Davis Love III (136). 

Woods, meanwhile, made the cut by the narrowest of margins with a 69 on Friday, for a 36-hole score of four-over 144, and trails Mickelson by a staggering 12 shots. Unless he throws up a couple of 63s over the weekend, his hopes of winning his third major of the year appear remote at best. 

It was a day on which Mickelson emerged like a rocket out of a crowded pack of first-round leaders ? six players had shared the lead after Thursdays play, and 21 more golfers had been within two shots ? with a sizzling 31 on the back-nine, which Mickelson played first. 

It was a day on which disaster was barely averted, as a large tree limb fell without warning beside Baltusrols fourth green in the afternoon, just as Woods, perhaps 40 yards away, finished playing a chip shot. Three people were injured, and Woods group had its round delayed by about 10 minutes.

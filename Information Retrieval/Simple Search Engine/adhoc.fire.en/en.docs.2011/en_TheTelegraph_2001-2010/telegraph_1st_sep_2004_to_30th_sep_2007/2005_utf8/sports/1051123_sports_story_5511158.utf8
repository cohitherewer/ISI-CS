The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When More didnt do his homework?

 - Dravid happy, excited, honoured 

 Rahul Dravid 

He added: Were not happy with Souravs performance over the past couple of years. Rahul, on the other hand, has been performing consistently. 

Dravids consistency is definitely worthy of envy, yet in the past couple of years Sourav has only had one truly poor Test series ? versus Pakistan, at the end of last season. 

More, obviously, didnt do his homework. 

He did emphasise that Souravs spat with Greg Chappell didnt have a bearing, but the coach is bound to have conveyed his thoughts to him. 

Thanks to an e-mail which got leaked, its no secret that Chappell has strong reservations about Souravs presence in the dressing room. 

Chappell and More have reached a perfect understanding. 

Actually, the Sourav-Chappell truce ? brokered by the BCCI on September 27 ? isnt going to be put to test as one is now sans authority. 

As of late tonight, Sourav will figure in the squad for the first Test against Lanka (to be picked tomorrow), but being just another player isnt the same as being the captain. 

Sourav declined to comment on his removal ? Right now, Im looking forward to the Ranji match versus Maharashtra ? and Dravid didnt say much either. 

Chased by the media after the third ODI got abandoned without a ball being bowled, he merely said (at the team hotel and not the Chepauk): Im happy? Excited? Honoured? 

Sourav indicated he would either call Dravid or congratulate him via an SMS. 

He has already gone on record saying talk of his possibly having misgivings about playing under Dravid was without basis. 

Dravid has handled the Harbhajan Singhs superbly. However, a bigger man management role awaits him.

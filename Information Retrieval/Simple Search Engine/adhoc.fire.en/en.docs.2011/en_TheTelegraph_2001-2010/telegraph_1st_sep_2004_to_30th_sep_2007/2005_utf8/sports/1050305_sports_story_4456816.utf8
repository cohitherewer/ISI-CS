The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No pressure on me: Marcos 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal?s new Brazilian recruit, 

Marcos Secco is not thinking too much about his debut for the club in an international 

tie against Muktijoddha Sansad of Bangladesh in the AFC Cup on Wednesday. 

He replaces his brother Douglas, who suffered a right shin bone fracture and subsequently operated upon. ?I don?t feel any pressure and will try to bridge the gap that has been created following Douglas? unfortunate injury,? Marcos said after practice at the East Bengal ground on Friday. 

Marcos is a free-kick specialist like his brother. ?The basic difference between me and my brother is the power, his (Douglas?) power is more than mine, otherwise our styles are almost similar,? the Brazilian said. 

Marcos is likely to step into the defensive screen?s role, his brother had been playing for the red-and-golds, against the Bangladesh outfit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Test cricket couldn?t have hoped for a better advertisement?

 - Advantage is with Pakistan in ODIs, feels legend Hanif Mohammed 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: Pakistan?s fantastic series-levelling victory, on Monday, came in the presence of the country?s first cricket superstar ? Hanif Mohammed. 

The former captain, understandably, was thrilled. 

?It?s a great win for us, yes, but I feel it?s a great victory for the sport as well... After all, the Test got decided with only a few overs remaining,? Hanif told The Telegraph. 

In between offering tips to an almost-at-attention Salman Butt (and nibbling at a sandwich), the legend added: ?Test cricket couldn?t have hoped for a better advertisement... Zabardaast match raha...? 

Hanif did say he was ?surprised? by India?s tactics on the last afternoon, but felt ?batting becomes difficult? if the wicket deteriorates rapidly and a game plan isn?t in place. 

In his opinion, Pakistan?s comeback in the Tests is going to have a bearing on the six ODIs. 

?There?s always that hit-or-miss element in limited overs matches, but momentum is a factor on any tour... After the result here, the advantage is with Pakistan,? Hanif insisted. 

For the time being, yes. In any case, Pakistan have won the last four ODIs versus India ? in Colombo, Amstelveen, Birmingham and Calcutta. 

Meanwhile, Asim Kamal (who was within earshot) chipped in with an absolute gem: ?Yeh khel aap ko hasata hai, aur rulata bhi... So, one should stay level-headed...? 

One can?t disagree.

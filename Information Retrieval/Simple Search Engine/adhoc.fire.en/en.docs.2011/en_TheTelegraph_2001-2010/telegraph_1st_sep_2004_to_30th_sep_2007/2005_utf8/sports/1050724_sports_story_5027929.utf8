 Sandipan cruises 

Pardubice: Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda started his campaign with an easy win over local hope Jan Lerch in the first round of the Czech International Open chess meet. 

Top seeded Evgeny Najer of Russia was held to a draw by Frances Charles Monory. 

Third seed Jiri Stocek of Czech Republic also could not do much against his compatriot Jan Vokoun and signed peace, while fifth seed Daniel Fridman of Latvia survived many anxious moments before getting the same result with Russian Evgeny Golcman. 

The Indians had a great day with 10 of them scoring victories. Only Krutika Nadig and Eesha Karavade were held to draws, by Markus Schaefer of Germany and Korinek of Czceh Republic, respectively. 

Also winning were IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury and GM norm holder S. Kidambi, who beat Romanian Marin Ramesa and Jan Barts of Czech Republic. GM Tejas Bakre accounted for Stefan Fruebing of Germany. WGM-in-waiting Tania Sachdev beat Erina Grigorova of Russia.

 Injury puts Vaughan in doubt

Lahore: England captain Michael Vaughan underwent a scan on Monday to find out if an old knee injury will keep him out of the first Test against Pakistan. 

The 31-year-old Vaughan faced just one ball before retiring hurt in Englands second innings against Pakistan A. 

A team spokesman said the results of the scan would be known on Tuesday. 

We need 24 to 48 hours to see how he responds to treatment and, of course, see the extent of damage in the scans but he is in pain and limping, England team doctor Paul Gregory said. 

Vaughan was taken to Imran Khans Shaukat Khanum hospital by team doctor Paul Gregory. A local official with the England team said Vaughan was struggling with an injury similar to the one which kept him out of a Test last year against New Zealand. (REUTERS)

 SLC elects new body

Colombo: Top Sri Lankan officials and former national players rose in revolt against the government?s suspension of the country?s cricket board, electing a new committee headed by controversial former president Thilanga Sumathipala. 

The committee also includes Aravinda de Silva, Duleep Mendis and Romesh Kaluwitharana. 

?We feel that the decision of the sports minister will have a very bad impact on Sri Lankan cricket and therefore we decided to put this new body in order,? De Silva said. 

?Time has come to tell this cricket-loving nation that there ought to be total care for the sports and nothing else,? Sumathipala said. 

The administration of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) was taken over on Friday by a committee appointed by the government, which said the board had mismanaged funds and did not follow government-laid guidelines. 

Sports minister Jeevan Kumaratunga was also displeased with the board?s decision to send Sumathipala to represent it at International Cricket Council (ICC) meetings. 

?We disagree with the decision and decided to elect a new committee today,? Sumathipala said, adding ?what matters in the end is the game, how we play it and how we organise it.? 

Sumathipala held the board presidency from 1999 to 2003 and, in between, was sacked by the then sports minister over unproven corruption allegations. 

Sumathipala said he and the seven-member committee was elected unopposed at the board?s meeting attended by 94 per cent of the members. (AP)

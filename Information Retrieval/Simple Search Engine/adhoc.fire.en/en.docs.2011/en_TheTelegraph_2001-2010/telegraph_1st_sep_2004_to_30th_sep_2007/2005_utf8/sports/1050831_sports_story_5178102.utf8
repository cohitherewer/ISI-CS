 Tokyo: Former Japan coach Philippe Troussier has expressed his interest in the vacant South Korea job.

 The Frenchman, who guided Japan to the second round of the 2002 World Cup, believes he can help the Koreans challenge at next year?s finals, although he favours a short-term deal.

 ?I am available. I am considering this mission,? Troussier said on Tuesday. ?The country have qualified for the World Cup and their potential is very high when you look at their performance in 2002.?

 Co-hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals of the last World Cup under Dutchman Guus Hiddink but are currently seeking a replacement for his compatriot Jo Bonfrere. 

 Rome: Inter Milan captain Javier Zanetti could be out of action for up to three months after injuring his thigh during the 3-0 Serie A win over Treviso at the weekend.

 Zanetti tore an adductor muscle in his right leg and will begin treatment on it after a few days rest, the Inter website said.

 The Argentine international could miss Inter?s next eight Serie A fixtures, including the away match against Italian champions Juventus on October 2.

 He also risks being sidelined for Inter?s Champions League Group H games against Artmedia Bratislava, Rangers and Porto. 

 Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia?s tourism ministry has entered into a deal with defending Premier League champions Chelsea to be its official travel destination, reports said on Tuesday.

 Malaysia will be one of the sponsors of Chelsea, whose home matches are watched by about 350 million viewers in 168 countries.

 The one-year sponsorship deal, worth ? 1 million, will allow the Malaysian tourism ministry to display digital signboards and promotionals around Stamford Bridge.

 Zagreb: Croatian Janica Kostelic, the triple Olympic and world Alpine ski champion, has recovered from knee surgery and is set to start training next week.

 ?I can?t wait for snow and ski training. I really miss it,? she was quoted as saying on Tuesday. Kostelic underwent surgery on her problematic right knee in June after experiencing pain while training.

 The 23-year-old is also preparing to defend her Olympic medals in Turin, Italy, next year. ?Obviously, Turin is the primary goal, but we will not sacrifice the World Cup because of it. After all, it starts in October, and the Games are in February,? Kostelic said.

 She won three golds at the World Championships in Bormio in February as well as at the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. 

 New Delhi: Olympic gold-winning shooter Ahmed al Maktoum has expressed his objection to and asked for immediate removal of any reference to him as a hired assassin in the Hindi movie Sarkar.

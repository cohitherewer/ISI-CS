 Tania back to winning ways

Istanbul: Woman Grandmaster Tania Sachdev came back into reckoning with a thumping victory over Evgenia Meshcheriakova of Russia in the seventh round of the World Junior Girls Chess Championship here on Thursday. 

The victory helped Tania jump to joint fifth spot in the standing list with six rounds still to go in the strongest girls event of the world. 

It turned out to be a better day for Indian girls with WGM D. Harika also coasting to a fine positional victory. 

The rest day after the sixth round helped Tania a great deal to compose herself. 

Playing the black side of a Sicilian Defence, Paulsen Variation, Tania was in her elements right from the start and knocked down a central white pawn to realise her advantage in the middle game. 

Looking for some elusive counter-play, Meshcheriakova gave up another pawn in the vain hope of finding perpetual checks but the Indian was alert enough to thwart all her attempts. The game lasted 51 moves. 

Indian IM S. Poobesh Anand drew with Farid Zeynalov of Azerbaijan, while Deep Sengupta and national junior champion G.N. Gopal signed peace amongst themselves. 

Ending on the losing side was Akshat Khamparia who failed to match the skills of local talent Yagiz Yasin Emrah.

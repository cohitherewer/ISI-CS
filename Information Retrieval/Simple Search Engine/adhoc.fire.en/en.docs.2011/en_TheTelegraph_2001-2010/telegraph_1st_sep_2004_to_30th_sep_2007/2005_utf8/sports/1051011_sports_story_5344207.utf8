 Giant leap in rankings a small step for Clijsters

Neil Harman

Even though she jilted a ferociously competitive former world No. 1 two months before their date at the altar, had lost four Grand Slam finals, was the No. 2 in a small country behind someone who barely conversed with her and had doctors suggesting that she may not play at the top level again, it is difficult to imagine anyone in sport who had ever been less in need of psychological help than Kim Clijsters. 

Yet that is what the Belgian press ? more likely the French-coloured section of it ? had begun to hint at, as this year, Clijsters tried to determine whether starting from scratch at No. 133 in the world was what she wanted to do. Last month, she won the US Open, in the next she may become the world No. 1 for the second time. In two years, she is going to lay down her rackets and start to live life to the full. Who needs help now? 

Frankly, it is a wonder that anyone who stays at the top of womens tennis for too long stays sound of mind. Clijsters was beaten for the first time in 24 matches in the quarter finals of the Porsche Grand Prix on Friday (she kisses her opponent on both cheeks at the end regardless of result), she has played 69 matches this year and lost seven, she is marvellously well-adjusted and only turned 22 in June. 

Two images of her are vivid. There is one with her left wrist heavily bandaged, held against her cheek as she watched Lleyton Hewitt, her former beau, compete at Wimbledon in 2004; the second is of a racket on the ground in front of her, hands clasping the sides of her face at the moment of her triumph in New York a month ago. In 16 months, from flat out to upside down and back again. 

When she flew to Indian Wells in March, hoping to pick up the pieces of a career threatened by two wrist surgeries, doubts shrouded her every move. I still think of that time, she says. I was talking to the WTA about setting a schedule but I didnt know how I would get into the tournaments with my ranking so low. 

I didnt care if I didnt play well there, I just wanted to get back into rhythm again, to be able to play some more matches. She won the title, the lowest-ranked Tier I winner in history. Then she won in Key Biscayne as well, beating five of the worlds top six inside a month, rising in the rankings to No. 17. There had been no pain, all gain. 

When I first set out with Carl Maes, my first coach, I needed someone to tell me, OK, this is what you eat, OK, its time for the shoulder exercises, and that was important, she said. Now, I know those things and how important it is to take care of my body. 

People have asked me why Im going to stop at the end of 2007. Honestly, I cant wait to be at home. Tennis is important to me, but its not the most important thing in my life, not at all. I want to be able to see more of my grandma, Ive missed my sister [Elke] growing up and I regret that.

 Villarreal, Betis claim elite berths

 - Forlan overtakes Eto as top-scorer 

Madrid: Villarreal qualified for the Champions League for the first time and sent opponents Levante down to the second division when they came from behind to secure an emphatic 4-1 win at the Madrigal on Sunday. 

Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan completed a memorable night for Villarreal when he struck twice to overtake Barcelonas Samuel Eto and become the leading marksman in Spain this season with 25 goals. 

Real Betis joined Villarreal in the third qualifying round of Europes elite club competition after a 1-1 draw at Hector Cupers Real Mallorca, who just about clung on to their top flight status in a nerve-racking final day of the season. 

Espanyol completed their best campaign in nine years when they secured fifth spot and booked themselves into the Uefa Cup thanks to a 2-0 home win over Athletic Bilbao. 

The Catalans will be joined in Europe by Sevilla, despite their 0-2 home loss to Andalucians Malaga. 

Champions Barcelona, who wrapped up their victorious campaign with a 0-0 draw at Real Sociedad on Saturday, ended the season with 84 points from 38 games. 

Real Madrid finished four points behind on 80 and a massive 15 ahead of third-placed Villarreal who ended up three clear of Betis. 

Levante, who dropped into the relegation zone for the first time this season last week, looked as though they might stage a dramatic escape after they took a shock lead at Villarreal. 

Argentine striker Gustavo Reggi got between two defenders to head in from close range midway through the first half. 

But the home side dashed their hopes when they pulled level four minutes before the break, midfielder Josico directing a clever header back inside the near post after Juan Roman Riquelme had dinked the ball in from just outside the area. 

Forlan made it 2-1 to Villarreal when he slid in at the far post on the stroke of halftime. The Uruguayan notched his 25th goal of the season a minute from time with a classy strike from the edge of the area and then completed a dream night by setting up fellow striker Luciano Figueroa for his sides fourth in stoppage time.

 Mizoram hold Bengal

Aizawl: Defending champions Bengal was held to a goalless draw by hosts Mizoram in the inaugural match of the national Junior football championship on Wednesday. 

In the second match, Maharashtra beat Tamil Nadu 2-0 to begin their campaign on a winning note. 

Egged on by the home crowd, the agile Mizoram boys thwarted the attacks by Bengal forwards and held the favourites goalless at the Assam Rifles ground.

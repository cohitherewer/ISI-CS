The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Our confidence is still way up there: Smith

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The halt of South Africas unbeaten streak just at the doorsteps of breaking the record in Bangalore may be disappointing, but Graeme Smith feels it didnt hand the hosts a momentum, going to the fourth ODI at the Eden on Friday. 

I dont think the momentum is with India, the South African captain on Thursday. When you come that close, you want to go all the way. But record is not going to bother us too much. Tomorrows game is a fresh call. Our confidence is still way up there. The guys are looking forward to the match and hopefully, we win it, he remarked. 

Smith didnt spell out his strategy for the match, but revealed that part of it would be on spoiling the party for Sachin Tendulkar on the maestros record-breaking 357th match. 

We know Sachin is carrying a lot of pressure. So we have to put him under pressure as soon as possible? We have good frontline bowlers and with new balls, you know you always have a chance, he said. 

Asked if there was any such strategy for Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Smith said: In a team of 12, you cant take anyone for granted. 

When asked whether hes comfortable with the super-sub rule, the opener said: We need to rethink whether the super sub can be chosen after the toss to balance the advantage to either side. 

Smith maintained that the new-look squad is meant for the 2007 World Cup. 

Are the new fast bowlers at his disposal good enough to carry on legacy of Alland Donald? Smith pointed out that patience is the key. I think they can match up to Donalds record one day. We need to be patient? the guys have the ability. We are looking for a squad for 2007 (World Cup).

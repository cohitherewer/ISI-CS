 New York: Indian teenage 

 sensation Sania Mirza registered her best Grand Slam performance 

 by storming into the fourth round of the womens singles 

 of the US Open here on Friday. 

Sania, the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam at the Australian Open early this year, moved into the last 16 with a crushing 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 victory over Marion Bartoli of France at the Armstrong Stadium. 

The Hyderabadi will now face top-seeded Russian Maria Sharapova, who beat Germanys Julia Schruff 6-2, 6-4. 

The 2003 Wimbledon junior doubles champion overcame a poor start when she was broken in her very first game. She then faced a minor lapse in concentration as Bartoli took a medical time-out with scores level at 5-5. 

But she bounced back in the tie-breaker, dominating with winners both on serve and return. 

Her powerful ground strokes were too hot for the 19-year old Bartoli to handle as the latters defensive tactics backfired against Sanias aggression. 

Sania dictated each point but made too many unforced errors ? 49 compared to 14 by the Frenchwoman. But she also had 45 winners to four by Bartoli. 

In the second set, Sania completely outclassed her opponent despite Bartoli catching the Indian off-guard in the first game. She forced four break points and converted the last by attacking the latters second serve. 

But Sania had little difficulty in recovering the set. A feather-touch drop shot from her, followed by a double-fault, left Bartoli with triple break points. 

Sania converted the first with a forehand winner. She then saved three break points in the next game to hold on to the advantage. 

As the game progressed, Sanias serves became stronger, marked by two aces in the seventh game. 

Serving to stay in the match, Bartoli was greeted with a stunning backhand cross-court winner. 

The French teenager then found the net. 

 Soon, Sania rifled a backhand service return for two 

 match points. Bartoli saved the first before a forehand 

 winner sealed the match in the Indians favour.

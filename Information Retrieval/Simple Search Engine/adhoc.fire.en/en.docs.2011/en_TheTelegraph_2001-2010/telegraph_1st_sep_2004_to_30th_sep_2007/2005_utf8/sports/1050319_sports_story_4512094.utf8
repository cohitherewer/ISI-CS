London: Sporting Lisbon stayed on course for a place in the Uefa Cup final at their own Jose Alvalade Stadium when they beat Middlesbrough 1-0 to reach the quarter finals 4-2 on aggregate on Thursday. 

The goal came just before the end of an evenly-balanced second round return leg knock-out match when Pedro Barbosa struck the ball just out of reach of Boro goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. 

That guaranteed Sporting a place in the last eight along with AZ Alkmaar and Newcastle United, who sealed their places on Wednesday, and CSKA Moscow who won earlier on Thursday. 

Austria Vienna, Parma and AJ Auxerre also advanced, with the final place to be decided on Sunday when Villarreal meet Steaua Bucharest in their delayed second leg match. The first leg ended 0-0. 

CSKA qualified with a 2-0 home victory and 3-1 aggregate success over Partizan Belgrade who finished with nine men after Nenad Djordjevic and Ivan Tomic were sent off in the last seven minutes. 

Austria Vienna qualified on the away goals rule after throwing away a 2-0 lead at Real Zaragoza in a match that ended 2-2 on the night for a 3-3 aggregate result. 

Parma, Uefa Cup winners in 1995 and 1999, also advanced against Spanish opposition, seeing off Sevilla with a 19th-minute goal from Giuseppe Cardone, the only one scored over the two legs. 

Auxerre went through 1-0 on aggregate against French rivals Lille after the sides finished goalless at Auxerre, who won the first leg 1-0. 

It was a miserable night for Lille, who have not won a match since January and finished with 10 men after Milovoje Vitakic was sent off 14 minutes from time for a foul on Auxerre midfielder Lionel Mathis. 

Newcastle beat Olympiakos Pireaus 4-0 on Wednesday to advance 7-1 on aggregate and AZ Alkmaar qualified with a 2-1 home win over Shakhtar Donetsk for a 5-2 aggregate success.

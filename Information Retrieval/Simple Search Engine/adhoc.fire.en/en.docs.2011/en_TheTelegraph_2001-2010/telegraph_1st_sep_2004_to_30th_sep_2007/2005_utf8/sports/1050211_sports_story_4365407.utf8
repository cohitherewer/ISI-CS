The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India hope to wrap it up

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India will look to wrap up the five-match one-day series Friday itself when they meet their under-19 England counterparts at Eden Gardens. The hosts, who won the three-?Test? series 3-0, lead 2-0. 

?The boys are on a roll, We?ll try and keep the momentum going,? said Manoj Tewari. The India under-19 captain is also hoping to make a century on his home turf. 

?I?ve failed to build on the 30s and 40s and hope things will change. A century is on my agenda,? he said. 

England coach Andy Pick thinks fatigue can play a role in Friday?s game. ?We played on two consecutive days in Agartala,? he said.

 PSB annex maiden title

Hyderabad: Punjab and Sind Bank (PSB) annexed the Major Rangaswamy Cup, defeating Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) 2-0 in the final of the 61st senior national hockey championship here Wednesday. 

Navpreet Singh (14th minute) put the PSB in the lead and skipper Gurvender Singh (53rd) sealed the game 2-0 to give the Punjab bank their maiden senior national win. 

The game started on a high note with both teams playing a blend of caution and aggression with the deep defences excelling in patches. 

However, Navpreet Singh?s drag-flick put the bankmen ahead. The teams were back on defensive immediately after and the bankmen changed ends in the lead. 

There were a few missed chances in the second half before a spectacular goal by PSB skipper Gurvender showed who were the best. He beat three defenders and drew out the goalkeeper before netting the winner. 

IOC stepped up the offensive despite PSB?s better ball possession. The leaders, though managed to keep the rivals at bay till the hooter sounded. In the bronze medal match, Indian Airlines defeated Services 2-0 to redeem pride. 

Sameer Dad put Airlines ahead in the 16th minute while Brojen Singh?s 60th minute goal sealed the fate of the vanquished.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Former Pak players laud Inzy amp; Co.

Karachi: Pakistan?s former greats have saluted skipper Inzamam-ul Haq and his young brigade for pulling off a brilliant 168-run win in the Bangalore Test to share the series. 

?Hats off to Inzamam and his boys. They played marvellous cricket and were deserving winners,? former pacer Sarfraz Nawaz said. ?They have shown they have the talent and potential to take any team head-on. The only thing questioned in the past was commitment and unity. But in this series, they showed they are a well-knit unit.? 

Sarfraz lauded Inzamam, saying he emerged a better captain than Sourav Ganguly. 

?I think Inzamam stood out as a better captain than Ganguly. Inzamam performed well with the bat, led the team better and above all, made a bold declaration in the final Test.? 

Former captain Moin Khan felt the victory would boost confidence of the young Pakistan team. ?I think this victory heralds the start of a new era. I can imagine what this victory would do to the confidence of the young players.? 

Saleem Yousuf, a member of the 1987 team that beat India in Bangalore, said: ?What makes me happy is the fact that it was a complete team effort. Every player contributed. The team is now playing like a unit and when this happens with Pakistan, they become very dangerous.? (PTI)

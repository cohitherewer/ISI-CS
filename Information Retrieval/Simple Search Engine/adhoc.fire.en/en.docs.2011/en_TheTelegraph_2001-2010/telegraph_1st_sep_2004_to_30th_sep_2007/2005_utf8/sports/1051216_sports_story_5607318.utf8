New Delhi: Substitute goalkeeper Abungobi Singh became a hero for Army XI when he saved the spot-kick by Harish Sharma of JCT Mills, Phagwara to send his team into the final of the Durand Cup football tournament via a 5-4 tie-breaker victory here on Thursday. 

Abungobi, who was warming up in the team bench for the entire match, had a crucial role to play when he replaced Robi Kanta Singh in the middle of the shootout with both teams having already converted two kicks each. 

Robi Kanta had sustained a side injury while diving to save a kick by JCTs Parveen Kumar. Both the teams were locked goalless till the extra time. 

All the previous nine penalty kicks have been converted and Abungobis save off Harish Sharmas attempt saw the mill men out of the competition. 

All the five Army men-Nguernilal, Vijay Thapa, Thirunavukarsu, S. Ramesh and Raghu Kumar converted their spot-kick while Sunil Chhetri, Parveen Kumar, Jaswinder Singh and Daljit Singh were on the mark for the losing side. 

Army XI will now face Sporting Clube-de-Goa in the title clash on Saturday. (PTI)

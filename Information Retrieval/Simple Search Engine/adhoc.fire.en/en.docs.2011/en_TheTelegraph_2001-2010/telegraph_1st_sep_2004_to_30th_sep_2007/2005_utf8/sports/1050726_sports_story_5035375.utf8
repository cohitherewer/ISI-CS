 Indian boys, girls finish 5th

New Delhi: China and South Korea set up title clashes in the boys and girls team events of the 11th Asian junior table tennis championship here on Monday, even as the Indian boys overcame a stiff resistance from Iran to finish fifth. 

In the boys semis, China beat Chinese Taipei 3-1 and Korea beat Japan by an identical margin to reach the final. 

The Indian boys faced a stiff challenge from their lower ranked opponents who at one point were leading the tie 2-1. But in the reverse ties, Soumyajit Sarkar and Aniket Koparkar blanked their rivals. (PTI)

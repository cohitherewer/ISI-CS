 Vijai in world Hall of Fame

Houston: Three-time major champion Vijai Singh has been voted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. 

Singh will be part of the 2005 Hall of Fame class, of which additional members will be announced at a later date. Induction ceremonies are scheduled for November 14. 

The native of Fiji was named on 56 percent of the returned ballots in voting by writers, historians and golf dignitaries from around the world. 

He did not receive the required 65 percent of the vote for induction, but the rules state that if ?no candidate receives 65 percent, the nominee receiving the most votes will be inducted, providing he is named on at least 50 percent of the ballots returned.? 

The vote was close, as Larry Nelson received 55 percent and Curtis Strange garnered 50 percent. 

The 42-year-old Singh will become the youngest member to be elected on the PGA Tour/Champions Tour ballot. 

?On the heels of one of golf?s finest single seasons, this is a richly deserved honour for Vijai and one he has dedicated his life to earning,? said PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem in making the announcement at the site of the Houston Open. 

?Adding World Golf Hall of Fame member to his resume assures his rightful spot among the game?s elite.? 

Singh has captured 25 PGA Tour titles, including the 1998 and 2004 PGA Championships and the 2000 Masters. 

In 2004, he had one of the most incredible years in recent memory with nine victories on his way to becoming the No. 1 player in the world. Singh became the first player with earnings of more than $10 million and captured the PGA Tour Player of the Year honours.

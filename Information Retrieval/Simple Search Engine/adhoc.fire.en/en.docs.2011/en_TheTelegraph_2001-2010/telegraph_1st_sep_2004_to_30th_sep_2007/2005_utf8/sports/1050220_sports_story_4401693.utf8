 Caniggia hangs up boots 

Buenos Aires: Claudio Caniggia, one of the stars of Argentinian football during the last decade, has announced his retirement at the age of 38. 

Caniggia, who played alongside Diego Maradona when Argentina went all the way to the 1990 World Cup final although he was suspended for the defeat by the then West Germany, played 50 matches and scored 16 goals for his country in an international career which spanned 15 years from 1987. 

The striker, who had been playing in Qatar, told Argentinia?s Radio Del Plata: ?The truth is that after seven months of inactivity, and although I train every day and I am very well physically, I have decided to retire. ?I had offers but I wasn?t enthusiastic about them. I was bored in Qatar and it did not add anything to my career.? (AFP)

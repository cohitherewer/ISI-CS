 Harikrishna enters semis

Lausanne: World junior champion P. Harikrishna moved into the semi-finals of the Lausanne Young Masters International Chess Tournament with a draw against Magnus Carlsen of Norway in the final game of the two-game mini match. 

Having won the first, a draw was enough for Harikrishna which he achieved precisely after 66 moves, notching a 1.5-0.5 victory over Carlsen. 

The Indian will now meet top seed and former Ukrainian champion Andrei Volokitin. 

Fourth seed Harikrishna was the only favourite to concede a half point to Carlsen, as the remaining three knocked out their opponents with a 2-0 margin. 

In the remaining three matches of the eight-player event, Volokitin, US champion Hikaru Nakamura and former world junior champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan ended as winners for the second day running against Elisabeth Paehtz of Germany, Nana Dzagnidze of Georgia and Maxime Vachier Lagrave of France, respectively. 

The other semi-final will be played between Nakamura and Mamedyarov. 

Carlsen exchanged the queens on the 45th move, not judging the endgame well enough. Harikrishna, with his perfect defence, thereafter forced his opponent to split the point. 

In the other matches, Volokitin defeated Paehtz in 55 moves. Nakamura, playing black, defeated Dzagnidze who blundered away a seemingly equal endgame in the Grunfeld defence. Mamedyarov defeated Vachier-Lagrave in 44 moves.

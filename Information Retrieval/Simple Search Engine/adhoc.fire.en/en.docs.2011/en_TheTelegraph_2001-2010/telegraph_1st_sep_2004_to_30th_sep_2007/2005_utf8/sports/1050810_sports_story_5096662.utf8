The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fears that gnawed our mind

Guest Column 

Marcus Trescothick

 I have never felt physically sick 

 at the end of a cricket match before. We came in on Sunday 

 morning expecting to have such a great day, but when Australia 

 only needed a handful of runs to win I was thinking: Oh 

 my God, how are we going to react to this?

 To be 0-2 down with three matches 

 to go, playing back-to-back Tests, would have crucified 

 us. Terrible thoughts start running through your head. First 

 it was: This cannot be happening. Then, when 

 a ball from Freddie (Andrew) Flintoff hit the footholds 

 and flew over the wicketkeepers head: Why is 

 everything going against us?

 Youre not giving it up, 

 but at the same time you are gripped by an awful sense of 

 the inevitable. In those last few moments, the game did 

 seem to have gone.

 Then Steve Harmison dug one in, 

 Geraint Jones dived forward and the whole place went crazy. 

 The arguments will continue as to whether the ball came 

 off Michael Kasprowiczs bat handle or the glove, and 

 whether he was even holding the bat when it hit him. But 

 frankly I dont care.

 It was a massive moment in the 

 development of our team. We have fought so hard over the 

 last 18 months to get to this position, and if we had snatched 

 defeat from the jaws of victory on Sunday, it would have 

 been a real hammer blow.

 Following the initial moment of 

 exultation, the guys were actually very subdued after the 

 game. It was so frightening, we felt we had aged 10 years 

 out there. We were in the ground for another couple of hours, 

 then had a few drinks at the team hotel and dinner. It wasnt 

 a big one; everybody was absolutely shattered, and just 

 trying to unwind from all the pressure.

 The whole day was quite surreal. 

 Even Shane Warnes dismissal was something you could 

 hardly have imagined, when he flicked his heel around and 

 kicked the stumps. But we were glad of it because we were 

 starting to wonder where the next wicket was coming from. 

 The pitch was playing so flat, under a clearer sky than 

 we had seen for the previous two mornings, and the ball 

 wasnt reverse-swinging.

 For us, the closest thing we have 

 experienced was probably the Karachi Test five years ago 

 when we won in the dark. But given the pressure of this 

 match and the situation of the Ashes, this one is way out 

 in front. When all is said and done, Edgbaston has to go 

 down as one of the greatest Test matches, not just of my 

 career but of all time.

 We started out on the first morning 

 determined to play positively and were delighted to hear 

 that Ricky Ponting had stuck us in. I struck the ball nicely 

 in my 90 which was an important innings in terms of its 

 pace.

 The pitch was quite slow so I 

 knew I could ride anything short and try to score most of 

 my runs off the front foot. It was disappointing to get 

 out pushing at a wide one after having played so well. I 

 was guilty of a lapse in concentration, nothing to do with 

 being in the nineties, just a misjudgement of the ball.

 Even though Kasprowicz got me 

 out, Australias back-up seamers are not finding things 

 easy right now. Were playing them well, upping our 

 game to be more aggressive and putting the pressure back 

 on them.

 It will be interesting to see 

 how they respond at Old Trafford. The wicket up there is 

 generally pretty hard and a bit bouncy, so that should suit 

 our tall quicks.

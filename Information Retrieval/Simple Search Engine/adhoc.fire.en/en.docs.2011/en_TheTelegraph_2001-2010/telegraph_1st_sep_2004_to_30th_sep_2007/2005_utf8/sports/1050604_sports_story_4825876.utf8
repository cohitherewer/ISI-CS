 Question marks against favourites 

 Epsom: One of the most compelling Derby statistics is that 28 of the past 42 runnings have been won by the favourite or second favourite. The problem with Saturdays Vodafone-sponsored renewal, though, is that those at the head of the market have question marks against them. 

 Take Motivator, the favourite, for example. His success in the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster last autumn marked him down as a leading Derby candidate and he endorsed that view with a smooth success in the totesport Dante Stakes on his reappearance at York last month. However, he is unraced on anything other than softish ground and, with his dam being a miler, his stamina is not guaranteed. Perhaps more significantly, he has inherited some of the quirks of his sire, Montjeu, a brilliant but flawed performer. 

 Motivators reputation as a highly strung horse goes before him and it was no accident that he was brought across to the racecourse stables at York late and in horse box. He had two handlers in the paddock and, in the race itself, hung when invited to put his seal on the race. Epsoms lengthy pre-race preliminaries could be an ordeal for him and, once the gates open, it will be fascinating to see whether he can keep his mind on the job.

 Dubawis odds shrunk after his scintillating success in the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh last month. There can be little doubt that Frankie Dettoris mount is a class act, but he is unproven beyond a mile and is blessed with so much speed that it seems fanciful to think he will stay the distance. He had also veered off a straight path in both his races this season.

 Other horses prominent in the ante-post betting are Oratorio and Gypsy King, both trained by Aidan Brien. Oratorio was just below the best as a two-year-old and, after finishing fourth in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, was then put in his place by Dubawi at the Curragh. It could be that he will find a bit of improvement upped in distance. Mick Kinane rides the horse.

 The twice-raced Gypsy King is more interesting after his remarkable success in the ten-furlong Dee Stakes at Chester last month. Asleep when the stalls opened, he then threw in an early fly-jump before failing to understand that his jockey, Kieren Fallon, wanted him to engage top gear. Despite doing his best to run off the track, Gypsy King got his nose in front, where it mattered most. THE TIMES, LONDON

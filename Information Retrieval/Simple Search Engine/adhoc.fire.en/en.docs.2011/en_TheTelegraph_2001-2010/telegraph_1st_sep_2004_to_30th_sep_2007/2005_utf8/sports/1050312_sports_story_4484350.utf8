 Streak, Blignaut in rescue act

Centurion: Allrounders Heath Streak and Andy Blignaut rescued Zimbabwe with battling half centuries on Day I of the second Test against South Africa on Friday. 

Streak (85) and Blignaut (52), both back from a year-long exile from the national side after a dispute with Zimbabwe Cricket, guided their side to 269 all out just before stumps. 

South Africa were 13 without loss at the close with captain Graeme Smith on three while Abraham de Villiers was on nine. (Reuters)

 Sasikiran in another draw

Malmo: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran played out another draw, this time with by Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova, in the third round of the Sigeman chess meet on Monday. 

US teenaged prodigy Hikaru Nakamura confirmed his status as one of the game?s rising stars by winning a marathon 100-move game against Swedish Hilarp Persson. It took Nakamura to the joint leader?s position, along with Iordachescu and Jan Timman (three points apiece). Timman got the better of Jonny Hector in Round 3. 

Sasikiran and Curt Hansen occupy the next slot, with 2 points each. 

Nakamura is generally flashy but against Persson his aggression was a bit restrained after the latter, playing black, went for the French defence. The advance variation gave Nakamura a tangible edge in the middle game when Persson went for trading of pieces at the cost of a wrecked pawn structure. 

The US champion was unfazed by the exchange of pieces at regular intervals and relentlessly tried to make a foray in the minor piece endgame wherein Persson?s bishop was gasping for breath till the end. 

A piece sacrifice resulted after Nakamura had made a foray with his king and knight and black?s position fell apart soon after. (PTI)

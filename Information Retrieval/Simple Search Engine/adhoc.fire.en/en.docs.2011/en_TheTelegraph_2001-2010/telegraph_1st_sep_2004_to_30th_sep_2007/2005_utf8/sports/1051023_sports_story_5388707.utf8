 Flashing Star set to strike 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Although seven colts are in the fray for the rich 2000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby, here on Sunday, it looks to be easy picking for the Robert Foley-trained ward Flashing Star. The easy winner of the 2000 Guineas will be partnered by B.Prakash. The Razeen-Altitude gelding looks in fine fettle. He has also been blazing the track during his workouts. 

 Flashing Star has beaten most of his rivals in Bangalore with the exception of Holding Court, who proved to be better in both the colts Stakes and Derby. In the absence of Holding Court, who has been rested in view of long winter season ahead, Flashing Star looks home and dry in the Classic event. The one who may finish close to the hot-favourite could be the vastly improved Psychic Strength, who left his rivals standing while winning a 1800 metre event in a very smart timing. However, it is hard to visualize the Flashing being upset in seasons main attraction which also brings down the curtain on the season.

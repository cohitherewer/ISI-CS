 The Bangalore advantage... 

 - Ex-India speedster David Johnson now looks for a coaching career 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: Lucky that David Johnson happens to be from the most happening city cricket-wise, or else he may have struggled to put together a benefit game. 

Thanks to his parent association, Karnataka, and support from the Rahul Dravids and Anil Kumbles (not to speak of oldtimers Jawagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad), the benefit comes off here Sunday. 

The day-night match, which will also serve as a practice game for the Team India probables, is expected to raise a tidy sum for somebody who apparently hasnt handled his finances most judiciously. 

With Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar not around, the teams are to be led by Dravid and Virender Sehwag. The latter, by the way, was a screen-boy during Johnsons debut Test ? against Australia, at the Kotla, in October 1996. 

The speedster played just one Test more. Many, though, feel he deserved better. 

Now 33, Johnson has already done a bit of coaching and intends making that a career. Ive stopped bowling fast, today Im into learning fast... Im keen to quickly become a qualified coach, he remarked during an interaction with the Media. 

Incidentally, in a chat with The Telegraph, a Team India senior accepted that the (newest) players association ? launched with fanfare almost three years ago ? needed to get active and do its bit to ensure the Eknath Solkars dont pass away with little in the bank. 

He said as much on learning that Indias finest close-in fielder had to overcome both illness and a cash crunch in the months leading up to his recent demise. 

Well, the senior in question and some of the others simply have to take the lead in pushing the association. Not everybody, after all, can be as lucky as Johnson.

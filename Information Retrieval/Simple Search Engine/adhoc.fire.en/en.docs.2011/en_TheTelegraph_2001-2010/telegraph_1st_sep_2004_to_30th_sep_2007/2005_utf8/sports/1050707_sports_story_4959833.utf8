 Sensational U-turn by Gerrard 

 Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard now wants to stay at Anfield 

London: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard executed a bewildering u-turn on Wednesday, telling the European champions he now wanted to stay at Anfield. Less than 24 hours ago, Gerrard said he had made the toughest decision of his life to leave his first and only club six weeks after lifting the Champions League trophy in Istanbul. 

He wants to stay. He realises how much the club means to him, Liverpool chief excutive Rick Parry said. I couldnt be more delighted. 

Parry said that in a series of telephone calls he had apologised to Liverpool-born Gerrard for any misunderstandings about the clubs desire to keep their talisman. 

Weve cleared all of that and I dont think it will happen again. It hasnt been easy for him but as far as we are concerned it is the right decision. 

Parry indicated Gerrard had agreed to sign a new contract which could make him one of English soccers highest-paid players, earning an estimated ?100,000 pounds a week. 

The five-time European champions rejected a bid for the 25-year-old from Premier League champions Chelsea earlier this week. Newspapers reported Chelsea had bid a British record ?32 million. 

Gerrards change of mind is a carbon copy of the situation 12 months ago when the player appeared set to join Chelsea, only to follow his heart and stay with his hometown club. 

The last six weeks have been the toughest of my life and its the hardest decision I have ever had to make, Gerrard had said on Tuesday. 

I fully intended to sign a new contract after the Champions League final but the events of the last five or six weeks have changed all that. 

Newspapers reported Gerrard had been upset by the slow pace of his contract negotiations since the Istanbul final. 

Manager Rafael Benitez said on Monday he wanted the midfielder to stay at Liverpool for the rest of his career and believed he could even become the clubs next manager. 

Gerrard scored one goal and set up another against AC Milan when Liverpool rallied from 0-3 down to reach 3-3 and a penalty shootout victory after extra-time in the Champions League final. 

Following the game, he appeared to pledge his future to the club. How can I leave after a night like this and all the nights this season? he said in Istanbul. (Reuters)

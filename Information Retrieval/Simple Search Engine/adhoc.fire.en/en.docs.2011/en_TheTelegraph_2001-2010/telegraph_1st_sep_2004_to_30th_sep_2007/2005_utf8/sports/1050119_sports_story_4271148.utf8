The Telegraph - Calcutta

Harsh?s resolve has to be applauded

A superb final provided a fitting finale to the recent 

Chennai ATP meet. In a match of the highest quality Carlos Moya the handsome 28-yr 

old 6? 3? Spaniard defeated Paradorn Srichaphan the smiling spiky haired popular 

Thai, Asia?s best, in a pulsating finish. 

Indian hopes crashed when the wild cards Prakash Amritraj 

and Karan Rastogi both lost in the first round and made no impression on their 

opponents.

Prakash Amritraj standing at over 300 on the ATP rankings, 

carrying the burden of high expectations due to his surname, has developed an 

impressive physique. A service at 217 kmph and a powerful forehand showed that 

he has potential. His game seemed a bit raw and still not fully mature. Continuous 

competitive play, a deeper second serve and higher level of all round consistency 

could raise his game a vital extra notch.

Karan Rastogi was unfortunate to play Bjorkman who 

is a wily much-feared competitor even at the topmost levels of the game. Even 

though he is very talented, Karan has some tough years ahead of him. The standard 

of play is so high nowadays, that it demands total commitment and much sacrifice 

to reach the elusive top hundred.

Three years younger than Prakash, Karan has time on 

his side. Hopefully, his sponsors will support him to work with a world-class 

coach, at whatever cost.

 Harsh must continue his efforts with greater fervour

For India, the man of the tournament was Harsh Mankad. 

Winning through the three rounds of qualifying and having a very close match in 

the first round of the main draw of an ATP tournament is a high-class performance. 

I wish Harsh had broken through and managed to win 

his first round in the main draw. Confidence, is one of the main factors, which 

opens the door to the top echelons of the game. One has to applaud Harsh?s resolve 

and hope that he continues his efforts with even greater fervour. 

Their chest thumping days over, Paes and Bhupathi 

were in opposite halves of the men?s doubles draw with new partners. Sadly, it 

brought into focus the possibility of a ?blood match?, where the winner could 

assuage to some extent his bruised ego. But this was not to be as Paes and Zimonjic 

lost in the semis of the men?s doubles to Schuttler and Lu, an unseeded pair who 

went on to win the doubles title beating Bhupathi and Bjorkman the top seeds.

Chennai deserves the highest praise for organising 

and getting sponsors for a high cost tournament. The warm hospitality and superb 

organisation has been much appreciated by the foreign players and has made India 

a favoured tennis destination.

Since my junior days I have always talked about the 

Chennai crowd, which is easily the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable in India. 

There is an intense passion for the game in Chennai, which has been stoked by 

the Krishnans and the Amritrajs, India?s tennis icons. When I was in Chennai last, 

some years ago Ramesh Krishnan told me of a ball boys? tournament, which received 

more than 600 entries; such is the interest in the game.

The promotional glitz and glamour attract and inspire 

young aspirants to the game. Besides, our promising youngsters and coaches are 

able to see at close quarters the latest techniques and tactics employed by top 

rung players. Ramanathan Krishnan told me that he was really inspired when he 

saw Frank Sedgman the great Australian play in Chennai in 1952. But of what use 

is all this if there are not enough courts and training facilities. 

While warmly congratulating the group of sporting 

industrialists and all those who sponsored and supported the ATP tournaments I 

would like to make a request. Their efforts must extend beyond the week of the 

tournament. They must apply their minds, with Vijay Amritraj at the helm, to set 

up meaningful world-class facilities with plenty of courts. Else, the 80/100 crores 

or so spent in the last decade on ATP tournaments will not bear any fruit. The 

dreams of youngsters inspired by watching great players will sadly never come 

true. 

If we had spent 15/20 crores on coaching and training 

during the same time, we would have many high calibre players. 

The roots of tennis in India need to be carefully 

nursed. The game can only flourish if Indian players are able to compete with 

the best and breakthrough to the top levels of the game.

 India, Korea in same group

 - Win only target vs Holland: Coach 

Rotterdam: Asian giants India and Korea would be placed in the same group in the second round of the Rabobank Junior World Cup hockey championship for men as per the draws made available here Friday. 

The top three teams from each of the four pools advance to the next round. The 12 teams are then divided into two pools for another round of league where they play sides they have not met in the preliminary league. 

Also, all the teams carry forward the points they have scored from their matches against other qualifiers from their pool. The top four teams from the second phase will advance to semi-finals. 

India and Holland, who play each other Saturday, have already qualified from pool D and the third team from this group could be either Poland or Egypt depending on the result of the match between them Saturday. 

From pool A, Korea have advanced to the Super 12 stage, winning both their matches and take on England, Saturday. 

Meanwhile, Argentina, having won both their matches in pool B, have booked their berth in the next round. The other likely qualifiers from this pool could be Germany and Malaysia, both with one win apiece against South Africa who meet Argentina Saturday. 

Defending champions India have maintained a clean slate, going by the one match at a time and the maximum points mantra. 

It does not matter at this stage whether you win by a dozen goals or one (versus Holland). The important thing is to come away with maximum three points and qualify for the next stage, coach Harendra Singh said on Friday. 

Looking ahead to the game vs Holland, Harendra felt: I will not be surprised if we win tomorrow. We will be having a video session today prior to some light practice at the ground in the evening. (PTI)

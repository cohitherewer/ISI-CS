Big guns get ready for Pak battle

Nagpur/Hyderabad: The big guns were out, oiled and cleaned and ready to fire. Two Duleep Trophy matches in two centres, Nagpur and Hyderabad, were poised clearly to test the battle readiness of the Indian armoury. 

With the Pakistanis scheduled to arrive, this was the final test case. 

In Hyderabad it was Master Blaster who was being followed. Not that his tennis elbow was being used to effect, but the way he fielded, he looked pretty much at ease. 

He did not bowl, hasn?t batted yet, but no discomfort was visible for Sachin Tendulkar. Bad news for the Pakistanis. Sachin had missed the last match because he wanted to rest his elbow a little more. Tuesday, though, he was seen to be easy going. The big question will be answered, though, when he takes up the willow Wednesday. 

In the Hyderabad match Ramesh Powar claimed seven wickets for 44 runs for West versus South Zone, who collapsed for 187. Not that West were in good shape, losing three wickets for 71 by stumps. Skipper Sachin has a tough task of steadying this ship now. 

There was a bit of disappointment in India?s most dependable line with Rahul Dravid managing just one run. 

 Sourav hit a century

Dravid became the first of the seven victims of Powar, 

caught by Neeraj Patel for one. 

Zaheer and Irfan Pathan also proved that they were fully fit and their body language suggested that they were enjoying the game. The two quicks are expected to be the Pakistani bugbears on the tour. 

Zaheer bowled a neat spell, though he managed only one wicket. 

In Nagpur, of course, Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly, was making merry, batting on 110. His match readiness had already been proved when he had scored a century versus Madhya Pradesh, but this, probably was a somewhat bigger stage. 

Laxmi Ratan Shukla also cracked a hundred as East Zone made a powerful start against Bangladesh Tuesday. 

Shukla raced to 123 in 143 balls. 

Wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni laid a goof foundation 

for East with a 51 off 71 deliveries. Sourav and Shukla took over from there to 

wrest the initiative for East Zone.

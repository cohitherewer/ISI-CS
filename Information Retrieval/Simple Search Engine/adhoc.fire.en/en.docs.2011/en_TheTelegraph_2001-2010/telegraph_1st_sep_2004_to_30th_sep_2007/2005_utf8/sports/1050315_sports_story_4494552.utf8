The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We need killer instinct, says John Wright

 - Coach says India hungry to make amends at the Eden

Calcutta: Team India coach John Wright feels that his boys will be hungry to make amends at the Eden after failing to win in Mohali. 

?It?s disappointing not to have won from the situation we were in,? Wright said before the Indian team?s practice session on Monday. 

Asked about the bowlers? failure to polish off the Pakistan tail on the final day of the first Test, the coach said: ?Top sides would have done it. We also have to get it done. It is an area we are looking into. We need the killer instinct. We are getting better. Hopefully we will show that in the remaining matches of the series.? 

The coach parried a question on the player who might face the axe if Harbhajan Singh made his way back into the team, saying: ?I won?t speculate on that. We just need to have the right combination in place.? 

He, however, indicated that they may go in with two spinners in the second Test starting Wednesday. ?It?s a good chance for Harbhajan to return to the team. He has always done well here and Sourav (Ganguly) and the selectors would decide on the final XI,? Wright stated. 

But he ruled out the prospect of going in with a five-prong attack as there?s Sourav, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, who all can roll their arms if needed. 

The coach informed that all members of the side, including pacer Irfan Pathan, were fully fit. 

?We just have to ensure that we play to our potential,? he maintained. 

Wright did not agree that India frittered away the chance of a victory because of their slow batting in the first essay. ?After Sourav got out, we were not in a position to go for quick runs.? 

He, however, seemed happy with youngster Dinesh Karthik?s performance with the big gloves. ?Though he conceded a few byes, he kept well to (Anil) Kumble and took all the catches that came his way.? 

He maintained that though Danish Kaneria is a good bowler, Indians are not finding him tough to play. ?He?s bowled well, but our boys usually do play leg-spinners well.? 

Wright didn?t seem too concerned with the wicket. ?This seems normal Eden wicket which is usually a good one,? he opined. 

On whether the current engagement was his last as coach of Team India, Wright informed: ?This series is much more important to me. So, I?m not thinking about anything else?. 

Indians had a light practice session in the afternoon, but had to be called off due to bad light followed by slight drizzle.

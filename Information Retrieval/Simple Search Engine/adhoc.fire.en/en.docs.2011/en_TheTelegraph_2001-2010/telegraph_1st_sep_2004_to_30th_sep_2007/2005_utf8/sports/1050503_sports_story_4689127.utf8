 Terry: Pressure is more on us

London: Liverpool have home advantage, but Chelsea have the English Premier League title in their cabinet and an unshakeable belief in their own destiny heading into the second leg of the all-English Champions League semi-final at Anfield on Tuesday. 

A goalless draw in last Wednesday?s first leg at Stamford Bridge would have left Liverpool feeling very positive about their chances of reaching the final against either AC Milan or PSV Eindhoven in Istanbul on May 25. 

But they face a Chelsea side brimming with confidence after clinching the championship for the first time for 50 years on Saturday with a 2-0 win at Bolton Wanderers. 

Chelsea stayed in the north for the second leg and despite a few knocks and bruises, coach Jose Mourinho will send out his strongest squad at Anfield as he attempts to repeat with Chelsea what he did with Porto last season. 

Twelve months ago Porto drew 0-0 at home in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Deportivo Coruna before winning the away leg 1-0 en route to a winning 3-0 finale against AS Monaco. 

With both first-choice full backs and both wingers out of action, Chelsea lack natural width, though they are still likely to play with Mourinho?s preferred 4-3-3 formation. 

But skipper John Terry believes Chelsea are capable of realising their dream of a treble haul of trophies. 

Terry said: ?Winning the championship gives us confidence for Liverpool, but there?s a bit more pressure on us now. It?s a chance to win one of the best competitions in Europe. We?re not going to throw that chance away.? (Reuters)

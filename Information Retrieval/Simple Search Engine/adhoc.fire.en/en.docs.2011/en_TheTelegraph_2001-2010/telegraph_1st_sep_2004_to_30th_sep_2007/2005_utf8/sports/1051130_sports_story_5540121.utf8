The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pro-Sourav selectors shown door

 - Biswal replaces Pranab as Easts man on committee 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pranab is out, along with Yashpal and Gopal Sharma 

Calcutta: The three senior national selectors widely seen as pro-Sourav Ganguly ? Norths Yashpal Sharma, Centrals Gopal Sharma and, of course, Easts Pranab Roy ? have been given the boot. 

While Kiran More (West) and V.B. Chandrasekhar (South) have retained their seats, Madhya Pradeshs Sanjay Jagdale makes a return after a year. Punjabs Bhupinder Singh (Sr) and Orissas Ranjib Biswal are in for the first time. 

As a selector can be around for a maximum of four years, Pranab could have had stayed for 2005-06 too. Poor Yashpal and Gopal, they got sacked after just one year. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the new dispensation had almost decided on nominating Vidarbhas Ashok Bhagwat as the new man from Central, but somebody then suggested Jagdale be brought back. 

Ironically, even Pranabs home association (Bengal) went along with the intra-zonal decision to nominate Biswal, a former Congress MP. 

Like Jagdale, though, Biswal hasnt played international cricket. 

Bhupinder, it may be recalled, appeared in two ODIs during the 1993-94 Asia Cup. More recently, he was associated with the Punjab Ranji Trophy squad.

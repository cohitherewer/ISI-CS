 Gloster to decide on Souravs fitness

 - Team India physio to examine captain in the city on Friday 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys participation in the October10-13 Challenger Trophy in Mohali will be known on Friday when Team India physio John Gloster gives his opinion on the MRI done on the captains troublesome right elbow. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the report has already been forwarded to Gloster, but the physio is to make an on-the-spot decision after examining Sourav in the city. 

He has been having a problem from the Zimbabwe tour and fears the early stage of a tennis elbow. 

Sourav has already been named the India Senior captain and that squad is to be coached by Greg Chappell. Its to be seen whether (after all) hes going to attend the ICC-organised captains summit in Sydney on October 12. 

That cant be ruled out if Gloster decides that Sourav needs to stay away from competitive cricket ? for a while, at least.

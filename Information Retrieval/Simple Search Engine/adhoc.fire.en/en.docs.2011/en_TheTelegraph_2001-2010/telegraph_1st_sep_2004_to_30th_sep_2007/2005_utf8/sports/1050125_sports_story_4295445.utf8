The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tickets may be priced at Rs 300, Rs 600

A STAFF REPORTER

 Rehman is likely to sing the theme song 

Calcutta: Tickets for the second tsunami fund-raiser, scheduled to be held at Eden Gardens on February 13, are likely to be priced at Rs 600 and 300. Clubhouse tickets may be available for Rs 8000 (lower tier), Rs 4000 and Rs 6000 (upper tier). 

The proposals were put forward at an informal meeting on Monday evening when CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya met other association officials and representatives of affiliated units. 

Among other significant ideas floated was a theme song by A.R. Rehman, to be sung by him before the start of the day-nighter. The Asia XI versus ICC XI one-day International is being organised by the CAB on behalf of the ACC Tsunami Relief Trust. 

M.F. Hussain may be asked to design a special logo which will be sold to the public. A special memento in the form of a coin may also be up for sale and can be booked through an e-mail or SMS. 

Friday?s working committee meeting of the CAB will have to ratify all these proposals. 

Meanwhile, the squads for the match will be selected in the first week of February, either in Malaysia or Bangladesh.

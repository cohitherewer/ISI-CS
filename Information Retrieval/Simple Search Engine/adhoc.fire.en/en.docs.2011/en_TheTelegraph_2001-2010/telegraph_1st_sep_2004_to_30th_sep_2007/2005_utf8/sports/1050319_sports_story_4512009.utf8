 Amandeep tied at 20th

Hainan Island: Amandeep Johl emerged as the best Indian by carding four-under 68 to be tied 20th while Jyoti Randhawa missed the cut on the second day of TCL Classic meet at the Yalong Bay Golf Club here on Friday. 

Johl had five birdies and just one bogey, only his second in two days, and Randhawa, who shot 72 and 71, let go chances for a few birdie putts and they proved costly. 

Besides Johl, two other Indians Jeev Milkha Singh and Harmeet Kahlon also made the cut. Shiv Kapur and Rahil Gangjee remained unlucky to miss the cut in an extremely low scoring event. 

Alejandro Quiroz of Mexico, playing his first event in Asia after earning the tour card in the qualifying school earlier this year, was leading the event, co-sanctioned by Asian and European tours. (PTI)

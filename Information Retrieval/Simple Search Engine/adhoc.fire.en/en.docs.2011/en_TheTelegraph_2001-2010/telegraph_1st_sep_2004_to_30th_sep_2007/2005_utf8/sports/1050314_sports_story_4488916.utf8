 Ogilvy in joint lead

Toronto: Australia?s Geoff Ogilvy erased an eight-shot deficit when an eight-under 64 gave him a share of the third-round lead with American Brett Wetterich at the $ 5.5 million Honda Classic in Florida Saturday. 

Fresh from his first PGA Tour win at the Tucson Open two weeks ago, Ogilvy began the day with two birdies at the Country Club in Mirasol in Palm Beach Gardens and ended the same way by picking up strokes on 17 and 18 to finish on 12-under 204. 

Ogilvy, who had been eight behind overnight leader Wetterich, reeled off nine birdies at the Sunrise course and dropped only one shot, on the par-three eighth. 

?I played definitely the best round I?ve played all year today,? said Ogilvy. (Reuters)

 Lara cleared to play for ICC XI

Melbourne: West Indies captain Brian Lara was Monday given the official all-clear to play for the ICC XI against an Asia XI in a tsunami relief cricket match here on January 10. Lara, along with teammates Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo, was given the go-ahead by the team management which was originally hesitant to let all three play because of the potential injury risk on the squad of 14 players. 

Lara will join Australians Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Matthew Hayden among others in the world team, chosen by former Australian captain Steve Waugh and New Zealand Test great Richard Hadlee.

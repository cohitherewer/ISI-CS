 Sydney: Former Australian No. 1 Mark Philippoussis has rejected a wildcard offer for the French Open later this month.

 Tennis Australia spokesman Peter Johnston said the world No. 183 was offered a wildcard by Roland Garros officials but turned it down to focus his attention on the Wimbledon in June, where he reached the final two years ago.

 ?Mark has been working hard in the US with his new coach Andrew Florent. However, he advised us he wouldn?t be ready in time to contest the French Open and was going to focus his energies on the grasscourt season leading up to Wimbledon,? Johnston said in a statement.

 Johnston said the two Australian wildcards for the French Open had gone to Peter Luczak and Sophie Ferguson under a reciprocal agreement between the two countries. 

 Seoul: Shiv Kapur slipped down the leaderboard as he shot a four-over 76 on the third day of the $ 500,000 SK Telecom Open golf tournament here.

 As Kapur slid to the 19th spot at one-under 215 for 54 holes, home favourite Choi Kyung-ju remained on course for a third Asian Tour victory, posting a four-under-par 68 to catch up with the overnight leader Andrew Buckle.

 Kapur, who scored 69 and 70 on first two days, admitted that he struggled with his putting.

 ?I just struggled with my putter all day, even though I hit the ball great,? Kapur said. 

 London: Queen Elizabeth II will officially open the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Buckingham Palace said.

 The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, will visit Australia from March 12-16. The games run March 15-26. 

 In Canberra, Australia?s Prime Minister John Howard welcomed the Queen?s acceptance of an invitation to open the games.

 ?I know that all Australians will welcome her Majesty and his Royal Highness with the warmth for which they are renowned,? Howard said in a statement. 

 London: Manchester United are having contract extension talks with US goalkeeper Tim Howard, manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday. The 25-year-old Howard, who moved to Old Trafford in 2003, has struggled to hold down a first-team place this season in competition with Northern Ireland?s Roy Carroll.

 ?He (Howard) is still a young goalkeeper who needs experience. That is the area we know we will see improvement in him,? Ferguson told Manchester United TV. ?Tim?s people have been in talks with (chief executive) David Gill, so we are on the move with that one.? 

 Nyon (Switzerland): Uefa said it will investigate an incident during the Uefa Cup semi-final second leg between CSKA Moscow and Parma when a firecracker thrown from the crowd left a player hospitalised.

 The firecracker was thrown in the ninth minute of Thursdays match in Moscow and exploded near Parma goalkeeper Luca Buccis head. Bucci was substituted shortly after and later taken to a hospital for treatment to his ear.

 Parma hasnt asked for a forfeiture of the match, but may make a more specific protest later, the spokesman said. 

 Madrid: Portuguese rider Nuno Ribeiro has been sacked by the Liberty Seguros cycling team after failing a health check before the start of the three-week Giro d?Italia. ?The board of the Liberty Seguros-Wurth team met ... after Nuno Ribeiro failed the health test and ... it has been decided to rescind the contract between the two parties,? the team said in a statement.

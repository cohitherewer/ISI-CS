 Im not losing my sleep: Ponting

Ashford: Ricky Ponting has claimed he is not losing any sleep about becoming the first Australian captain to lose an Ashes series for almost two decades. 

Alan Border was captain when Australia last lost to England in 1986-87. Since then Border himself, Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh have presided over eight straight wins over their oldest enemy. 

Ponting took over from Waugh when the latter retired in 2004 and when he landed in England Sunday to prepare for this years renewal, he insisted he was not fretting about being the one to lose Australias proud record. 

Ponting said: Im not looking at it as being the first to lose them (the Ashes), Im looking at being another Australian captain to retain the Ashes. 

It comes back to us being here and preparing well. There is no more pressure on this team than in any other series. In every series we have played for the last ten years we have been favourites and it might be the same this time. It is not something we have thought about ? we are here to play the best possible cricket. 

Englands resurgence in form in the last two years, under the captaincy of Michael Vaughan, has seen them move up to second place in the ICC World Rankings. In the hugely unlikely event of them beating Australia 5-0 in the Ashes series they will take over at the top of the table. 

But several of the Australians have played County cricket in England and Shane Warne, who will just be playing in the Test matches, is currently captaining Hampshire who are top of the English county championship.

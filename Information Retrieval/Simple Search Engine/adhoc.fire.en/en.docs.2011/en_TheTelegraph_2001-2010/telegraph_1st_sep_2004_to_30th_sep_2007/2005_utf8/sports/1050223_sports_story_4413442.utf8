 Shivraj still not out of danger 

Mumbai: Ace polo player Shivraj Singh, who suffered a head injury during a match last week, continued to be in coma and was still not out of danger. 

?Singh is still in coma and not out of danger. However, we find he is stable and in a better condition than yesterday,? CEO of the Bombay Hospital, Ashwinikumar Tiwari, said on Tuesday. 

The 27-year-old, the only son of the erstwhile royal family of Jodhpur, had fallen down from his horse while playing in the Birla Cup in Jaipur on February 18 and was rushed to a nearby private hospital and later to the S.M.S. Hospital there. 

He was brought here on Monday from Jaipur. ?The next few days would be crucial and Singh would be under observation,? Tiwari said.

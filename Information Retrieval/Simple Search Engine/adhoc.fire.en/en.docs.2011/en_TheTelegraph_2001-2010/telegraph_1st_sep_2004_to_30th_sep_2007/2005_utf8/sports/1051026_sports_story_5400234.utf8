 Shoaib threatens to sue TV channel

 Shoaib will get PCB backing 

Karachi: Pakistan paceman Shoaib Akhtar, in an effort to restore his battered pride and dented reputation, has threatened to sue a leading satellite sports TV channel for derogatory remarks made against him during a show. 

ESPN-STAR, in its Monday bulletin, carried a story on Akhtar joining the camp, used a phrase in Hindi that annoyed the temperamental fast bowler who has taken up the case with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). 

The Hindi phrase compared Akhtar with the tail of a dog that never straightens, with reference to the bowlers indiscipline and lack of commitment. 

I have brought the issue to the notice of PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan who has assured me that the board would fight my case. 

I demand an unconditional apology from the channel and if they dont, I will be left with no option but to file a case of defamation, Akhtar said in a brief statement. 

Akhtar, along with Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, met Shaharyar on Tuesday morning and showed him the programme footage. 

We will not allow any channel to use derogatory remarks against any Pakistan cricketer. The expressions or words used have hurt the feelings of not only the player but the board and the players supporters. 

We will write to the sports channel to express our annoyance and will demand an unconditional apology. In case it doesnt come, we will take a legal course, a PCB spokesman said. 

The satellite channel, in the past, made derogatory remarks against several other Pakistan cricketers, including Inzamam and former captain Moin Khan.

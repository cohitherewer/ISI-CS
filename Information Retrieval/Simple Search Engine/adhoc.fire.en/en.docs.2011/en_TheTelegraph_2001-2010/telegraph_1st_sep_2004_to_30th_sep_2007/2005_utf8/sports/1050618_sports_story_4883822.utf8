The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lanka set to see family history

 - Chappells to be together overseas for the first time 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ian, Trevor and Greg Chappell at the SCG in 2001 

Bangalore: Each brother will be busy with a different assignment, but the tri-series beginning in Sri Lanka next month is going to see family history: The coming together of the three Chappells outside Australia. 

Honestly, I cant recall if all three of us ever happened to be overseas at one place at the same time... In that respect, then, we will be creating our own little piece of history, Greg told The Telegraph on Friday evening. 

While hes going to be around as the Team India coach, elder brother Ian will be doing TV commentary. As for Trevor, a one-time fielding coach of Sri Lanka, hes going to be working at a private academy. 

Interestingly, even though the Chappells collectively featured in 165 Tests and 110 ODIs, all three never made the same XI ? not even at home. 

I suppose there will be opportunities to get together, in Colombo, Greg remarked, adding that the brothers met over dinner (in Sydney) as recently as Monday. 

It wasnt a send-off for me, but we happened to dine not many hours before Judith and I left for India... It felt good, he said. 

Did Ian, in particular, offer advice? 

Actually, we hardly spoke about my job... Ian has strong views about coaching and, so, do I... I agree with some of his thoughts and disagree with the rest. Its the same with Ian, Greg replied. 

Ian and Trevor (he is the Kings School coach) stay in Sydney, while Greg has returned to native Adelaide. 

Incidentally, Greg turns 57 during the tri-series ? on August 7. That, perhaps, is going to be the day when the brothers author a bit of Chappell history.

 Jyoti now in third spot

 Jyoti Randhawa moved up after his Malaysian Open show 

Kuala Lumpur: Riding on his impressive performance at the Malaysian Open two weeks ago, Jyoti Randhawa has moved to the third spot in the Asian Tour order of merit. 

Thailand?s Thongchai Jaidee extended his lead at the top after a third-place finish at the Myanmar Open. 

The Thai, last year?s Asian No. 1, has accumulated $212,860 from three tournaments this season. Jaidee is followed by Japan?s Kiyoshi Miyazato with $193,423 who won last December?s Okinawa Open, an Asian Tour release said. 

India?s Randhawa is at third position with a total prize-money of $140,545, thanks to his second-place performance at the Malaysian Open. 

Thongchai won the Malaysian title and finished top of the leaderboard in Yangon on Sunday to pocket $11,200. 

The result also saw Thongchai move up to 57th place on the official world ranking as he continues his push for a US Masters slot in April, which requires him to be inside the top-50 a week prior to the Masters. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, with a prize-money of $56,287, occupies the sixth spot. 

Ashok Kumar, who tied for third spot alongside Jaidee in Myanmar, is No. 35 on the merit list.

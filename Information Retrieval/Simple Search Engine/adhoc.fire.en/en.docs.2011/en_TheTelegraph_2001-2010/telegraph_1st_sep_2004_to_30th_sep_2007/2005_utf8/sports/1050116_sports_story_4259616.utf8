 STAR RACER

 Bath

Calcutta: Trainer Harvinder 

 Singh Bath?s Star Magic produced a brilliant gallop in the 

 home stretch to canter home with the 1,200m Calcutta Champions? 

 Sprint Trophy, the main attraction of Saturday?s race card. 

 S. Shanker partnered the seven-year-old horse, who went 

 to the start as a 5-4 favourite, to an eight-and-a-half 

 length victory over Gypsy King.

 In the process, the Alnasr Alwasheek son earned his ticket for Chennai to contest the Sprinters? Trophy during the Invitational weekend on the first Saturday of March this year.

 It was the easiest of Star Magic?s three wins ? in succession ? scored by him since migrating from Mumbai this winter season.

 The other impressive winner was the Vijay Singh-trained Romantic Liaison in the Alokananda Stakes. Ridden by C. Alford, the filly helped her schooler win his first juvenile race this season. Alford also helped Vijay?s Absolute Luxury and Arakawa win thier respective events. The afternoon was dominated by favourites with five of them coming good.

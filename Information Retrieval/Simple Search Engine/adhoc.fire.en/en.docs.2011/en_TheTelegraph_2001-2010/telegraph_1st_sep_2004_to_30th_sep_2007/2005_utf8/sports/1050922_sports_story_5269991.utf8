The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The economics involved in a WTA tournament 

 - Bhupathi hoping to break even this year itself 

MADHUMITA GANGULY 

Calcutta: The Sunfeast Open has regenerated interest in tennis in the city and most roads are leading to the Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

But what does it take to host a tournament of this dimension? What are the economics involved? How is the money generated? 

Here is a look at the inside story. 

It takes about Rs 4 to Rs 4.5 crore to host a meet of this level, minus prize money and infrastructure, says Anirban Das Blah, vice-president of Globosport, the sports and event management company which has brought this meet to Calcutta. 

The prize money at the Sunfeast Open is $170,000, the minimum necessary to host a Tier III WTA tournament. The West Bengal government has taken care of the infrastructural expenditures. That is, minus all expenditures incurred on the court. 

And, of course, appearance money has to be paid to stars. Organisers cant disclose those figures. 

Just to give an example, a Maria Sharapova charges up to $ 500,000 to put in an appearance at any of these lower-rung meets. 

Except for the infrastructure, all other costs are, of course, borne by the sponsors (ITC, who are the title sponsors, and associate sponsors Bengal Peerless, Tata Steel and Kolkata West International City). 

This being a first-time event, says Das Blah, we have to convince others of our ability to deliver the goods ? in order to draw more sponsors in the future. For, by no means do we intend to make it a one-off event. In order to make commercial sense, the tournament has to become an annual affair. 

In order to do so and to attract more sponsors, organisers have to be able to convince the sponsors of their ability to (a) deliver a quality event; (b) ensure high media coverage; (c) of having all other logistical capabilities. 

And will the tournament break even in the first year? 

Globosport supremo Mahesh Bhupathi feels it will. A great achievement that, considering the Chennai ATP meet needed a good 3-4 years to do so. 

Minus capital expenditures, of course, adds Das Blah. 

And what would it take to upgrade this tournament to Tier II? 

Says Tour supervisor Guilia Orlando: First the prize money has to go up significantly. While a Tier III event must have a minimum prize money of $170,000, a Tier II tournaments prize money must be a minimum of $5,85,000. (A Tier I meet needs a minimum of $1,30,000). 

The points in these tournaments differ significantly, too, and thus has a great amount of bearing on rankings. While the winner of a Tier I WTA meet gets 325 points, Tier II fetches 195 and Tier III 120. 

Also, continues Giulia, and this is very significant, in order for a meet to be upgraded, there has to be a slot free. 

The number of Tier II tournaments is fixed at 13 (and 9 for tier I). So, in order for a meet to move up from Tier III to Tier II, apart from fulfilling other criteria, somebody in Tier II must be willing to sell the position. 

Tennis is Bhupathis labour of love and thus his effort to popularise the game in India. Of course, with an eye on the commercial prospects too. 

Hence the effort to make the tournament more interactive. And hence the Design-the-Trophy contest and the fashion shows. Hence the signing of autographs and distribution on T-shirts by Sania Mirza ? the idea being to use an icon to capture interest ? particularly the kids. 

The way Sony television used Mandira Bedi to take cricket inside homes and to housewives. 

They have, it must be admitted, made a sure start in that direction.

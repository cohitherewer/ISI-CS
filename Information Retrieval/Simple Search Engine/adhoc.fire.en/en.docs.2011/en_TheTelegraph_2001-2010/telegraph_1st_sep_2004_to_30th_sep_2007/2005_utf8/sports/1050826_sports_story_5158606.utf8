 Vandana takes first-round lead 

Chennai: Former champion Vandana Agarwal of Calcutta shot into the lead, enhancing her hopes of winning the Madras Ladies Open Golf Championship here. 

In the penultimate round of the four round 72-hole competition, Vandana got her wonted form, as indicated by her performance in the front nine. 

Coming up with a birdie on the sixth besides parring the rest on her outward journey, Vandana had problems with her putts and her four bogeys but a double in the last 18th was enough to take the lead with a total of 225, three strokes ahead of Irina Brar of Chandigarh and Jamshedpurs Shraddanjali Singh, who were in joint second place. 

Bangalores Sharmila Nicolett and overnight leader Sonam Chugh (Mysore) were joint third with an aggregate of 230 each, followed by city veteran Lalitha Balasubramaniam (232). 

Mysores Bhavana Shetty carded the days best (73), while Indias top golfer Irina was yet to come to terms with the course as she had a treble bogey on the third hole. Like Vandana, Irina also returned a card of four over 72, in the gold division. 

In the junior section, Sharmila Nicolett and Sonam Chugh were joint first with 230 each, Rani Chadda continued to lead the bronze division with a total of 298 followed by Aditi Mehta of Pune on 309.

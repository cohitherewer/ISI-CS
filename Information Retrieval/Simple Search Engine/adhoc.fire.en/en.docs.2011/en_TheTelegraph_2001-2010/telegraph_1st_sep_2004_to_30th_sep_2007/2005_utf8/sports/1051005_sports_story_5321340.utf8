 India aim for better show against NZ

New Delhi: India have managed to keep a clean slate despite not-so-impressive performances in their two matches so far, but will look to raise their level against a tough New Zealand in the Indira Gandhi International Gold Cup womens hockey tournament here Wednesday. 

India lead the points table but they are yet to meet the top two teams in the championship ? Australia and New Zealand, both lying joint second with one win and a draw each. 

The hosts, who were completely off-colour in their first tie against Malaysia, could show only a little improvement in their next match against Italy blanking them 5-0 but failing to make a mark. 

Indias problem in the tournament has been the penalty corner conversion and lack of co-ordination in the forward line. We cannot afford to miss so many penalty corners and also we will have to check the gap that is created in the midfield, M K Kaushik said at the National Stadium. 

Next two matches are important for us and we will have to see that we dont repeat the mistakes, he said. 

Kaushik said the girls were, however, confident. We had a good practice today and the girls are confident of putting up a good show, he said. 

New Zealand, who have been experimenting with the team because of the Commonwealth Games will field a strong side in the match as four regular players joined the team. 

The Kiwis have restrained themselves to defensive hockey. They managed to hold the Aussies to a goalless draw and scored a last minute goal against Italy to win 2-1. (PTI)

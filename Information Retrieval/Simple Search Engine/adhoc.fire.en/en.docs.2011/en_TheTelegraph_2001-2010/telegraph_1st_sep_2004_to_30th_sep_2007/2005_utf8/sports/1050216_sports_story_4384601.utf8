 Nehra wrecks West

 Nehra took six for 57 

Lucknow: Left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra scalped six wickets as North Zone dismissed West for 201 on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy match here Tuesday. 

Nehra wrecked havoc to claim six for 57 as North, after bowling out their rivals for a modest total, helped themselves to 114 for two at stumps at the K D Singh Babu Stadium. 

North raced to 50 in just 44 balls and crossed the 100 mark at the end of 19.4 overs on a slow wicket. At close, Akash Chopra was batting on 44 while Ravneet Ricky was on 19. 

Earlier, Nehra?s devastating spell saw West being dismissed for 201 despite a fighting 55 by Parthiv Patel. 

Nehra literally ran through the West line-up, which was reduced to 87 for 5 at one stage before Patel and Ramesh Powar (35) added 52 runs for the sixth wicket to stem the rot. Pawar was more aggressive of the two and hit eight fours in his knock which came off just 48 balls. 

BRIEF SCORES: West Zone 201 (Satyajit Parab 32, Parthiv Patel 55, Ramesh Powar 35; Ashish Nehra 6/57). North Zone 114/2 (Virender Sehwag 33, Akash Chopra batting 44).

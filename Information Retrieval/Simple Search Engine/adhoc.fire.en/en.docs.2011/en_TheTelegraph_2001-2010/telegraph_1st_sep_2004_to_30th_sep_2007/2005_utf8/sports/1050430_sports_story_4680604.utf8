 Silverstone testing sharpens Narain

 Narain Karthikeyan 

London: Narain Karthikeyan said he was looking forward to the next Formula 1 race ? the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona ? after coming up with the fastest lap for his team during the testing at Silverstone in England. 

Karthikeyan took one minute, 22.75 seconds to emerge the fastest among the Jordan drivers on the final day of the two-day testing on Thursday to prepare himself for the May 8 race. 

The Indian ace was, in fact, the second fastest among all drivers who took part in Thursday?s testing. He finished 0.583 second behind William?s Nico Rosberg who topped the time sheet at Silverstone. 

?I am quite happy with the progress we are making and can?t wait to drive at the Circuit de Catalunya, the first track I know so far this season,? Karthikeyan said. 

The Indian?s Portuguese teammate Tiago Monteiro came up with a timing of 1:23.39 while Jordan test driver Nicky Pastorelli clocked 1:27.27. 

The Jordan drivers? programme focussed on conducting tyre-testing for Bridgestone and chassis set-up work in preparation for the Spanish GP and forthcoming races. 

Karthikeyan, who did not take part in the first testing on Wednesday, said ?these two days at Silverstone were constructive for the team. 

?The weather was not too bad and we managed to do many laps, testing different types of tyres and a new gearbox,? Karthikeyan said. 

Meanwhile, Toyota have dropped their appeal against Ralf Schumacher being stripped of a point in Sunday?s San Marino Grand Prix. 

The decision, announced by the Formula One team on Friday, confirmed Germany?s Nick Heidfeld as the eighth placed and final points-scoring driver for Williams and relegated compatriot Schumacher to 11th. 

?The team lodged an appeal on the evening of the race because it wanted the opportunity to undertake a detailed analysis of the incident,? Toyota said in a statement. 

?After an exhaustive review of the data, the team feels that the evidence is not conclusive and has decided not to take the matter further.? 

The hearing had been scheduled for Paris on Tuesday, the day before one involving BAR that could see heavy sanctions for that team and further amendment to the results with Briton Jenson Button in danger of losing third place.

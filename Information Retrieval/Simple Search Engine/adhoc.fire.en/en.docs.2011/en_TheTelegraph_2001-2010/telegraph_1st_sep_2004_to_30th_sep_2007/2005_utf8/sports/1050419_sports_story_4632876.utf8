 Teenagers out to challenge hierarchy 

 - We?ll see a lot from Nadal: Federer 

 Nadal became the youngest winner of the Monte Carlo meet since Wilander in 1983 

Monte Carlo: The evolution of men?s tennis took another leap forward in Monte Carlo last week when two 18-year-olds showed they are equipped to challenge the sport?s established hierarchy. 

Spanish left-hander Rafael Nadal became the youngest winner of the prestigious Masters Series claycourt tournament since Mats Wilander in 1983 and is already a favourite for this year?s French Open. 

French qualifier Richard Gasquet may be a little way behind his fellow 18-year-old, but his performance in ending world number one Roger Federer?s 25-match winning streak in the quarter finals was breathtaking. 

While Gasquet is still a work in progress after a rocky start to life on the Tour, Nadal looks certain to challenge at the game?s highest level. 

He has the best record on clay this year, with three titles already under his belt, and came within two games of beating Federer earlier this month in the final of the Masters Series in Miami. 

?That was a great match for me because he?s going to be a great player, we?ll see a lot from him in the future,? four-time Grand Slam champion Federer said after their Miami showdown. 

The 23-year-old Swiss also got a first-hand look at Gasquet in Monte Carlo and believes the French player has the tools to challenge for major titles, providing the hype does not weigh to heavily on his shoulders. 

?I know exactly what he is going through but he?s shown in the last few weeks that he wants to get to the top.? 

Gasquet burst on to the scene three years ago as a 15-year-old at Monte Carlo, gaining a wildcard into qualifying before beating tough Argentine Franco Squillari in the first round to become the youngest player to win a main tour match. 

Since then he has struggled, languishing at 101 in the world rankings and drawing criticism from a French media desperate to discover the next Yannick Noah. 

Nadal took his first Masters Series title firmly in his stride, and is already looking at how he can get better. 

While Nadal and Gasquet have grabbed the headlines in the past week, there are others waiting in the wings for their chance to break through. 

Gael Monfils, another 18-year-old French player, reached the fourth round in Miami last month and looks destined to compete at the highest levels of the game. 

Donald Young, the 15-year-old American prodigy who gained wildcards at Indian Wells and Miami this year after becoming the youngest ever winner of the Australian Open junior, also offers a glimpse of an exciting future.

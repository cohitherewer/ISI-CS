 Message of hope from players

London: Five ICC XI players, who would be taking part in the tsunami charity match against Asia XI in Melbourne on Monday, have sent out messages of hope to the countries devastated by the disaster. 

Darren Gough, Daniel Vettori, Chris Gayle, Chris Cairns and Dwayne Bravo pledged their support to the cause while urging survivors ?not to give up?. 

?It will be a brilliant game of cricket played in a good spirit and all to support people who really need our help,? England fast bowler Gough was quoted as saying by an ICC media release here Saturday. 

Gough mentioned that the disaster had moved his children who had contributed their pocket-money to the relief fund. 

?Cricket fans across the world have always enjoyed seeing players from Sri Lanka and India in action, now it is time cricket gave something back to these tsunami hit parts of the world,? he added. 

New Zealand allrounder Cairns said the ?world must unite to assist the victims of the disaster?. 

Joining in the appeal to people worldwide to donate for the relief efforts, his compatriot Vettori said recovery was going to be a long haul, and ?this appeal is not for one day or one week, it?s about being there for as long as it takes?. 

Bravo, the youngest player in the ICC side, said if people came out and supported the game, it would be appreciated by the survivors and the players. ?Do not give up and thank God for life,? he said in his message to tsunami survivors. 

His senior teammate Gayle echoed similar sentiments.

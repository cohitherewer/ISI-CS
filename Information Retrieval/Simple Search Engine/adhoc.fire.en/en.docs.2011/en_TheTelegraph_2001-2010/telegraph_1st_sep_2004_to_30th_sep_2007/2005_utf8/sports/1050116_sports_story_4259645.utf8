 New Delhi: India?s Rajeev Bagga once again displayed his supremacy in badminton as he won the gold in the men?s singles as well as doubles in the 20th Deaflympic Games in Melbourne Saturday. Bagga, the defending champion, first thrashed Nattachai Unsomsri of Thailand 15-7, 15-8 to retain his singles title and then paired up with Sandeep Dhillon to beat Bong Lee and Woo Sin of Republic of Korea 3-15, 15-13, 15-9, according to information received here.

 The two-time national champion, who was conferred the honour of Deaflypian of the Century in 2001, has now won 14 gold medals in various categories of the Deaflympics since 1989. The Indian, however, failed in the mixed doubles as he was made to bite the dust in the pre-quarterfinals.

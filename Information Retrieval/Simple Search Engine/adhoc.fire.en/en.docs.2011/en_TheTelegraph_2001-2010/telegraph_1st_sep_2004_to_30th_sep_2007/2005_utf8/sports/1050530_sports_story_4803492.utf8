Bridgetown: West Indies completed a commanding 276-run win over Pakistan on the fourth day of the first Test on Sunday to restore some pride after a dire run of form. 

Pakistan, who had been set an improbable victory target of 573, began the day on 113 for four and were bowled out for 296. 

Pakistan lost four wickets after tea within the hour after resuming on 278 for six with Chris Gayle picking all four to finish with five for 91. 

The victory gives the hosts a 1-0 lead in the two-match series with the second Test scheduled in Jamaica from June 3. 

Their march towards a morale-boosting win was held up in the first session by some fireworks from flamboyant allrounder Shahid Afridi, who scored his third Test hundred from only 78 balls, the second-fastest century by a Pakistani. 

It was the third century of the match after Brian Laras 130 in the West Indian first innings and captain Shivnarine Chanderpauls undefeated 153 in the second. 

Pakistan managed just 144 in their first innings, conceding a first innings lead of 201 to the victors. 

On Saturday, the West Indies march to only their second win in 19 matches was held up by Asim Kamal and Shahid Afridi as Pakistan ended the third day on 113 for four at Kensington Oval. 

Left with the unenviable task of scoring 573 to win the match or bat out seven sessions for a draw, Pakistans frail batting was exposed again as they lost four wickets in the final session and were reduced to 16 for three at one stage. 

Salman Butt, Younis Khan went for ducks, Yasir Hameed for 11 and Bazid Khan for 23 even though West Indies lost pacer Fidel Edwards, who had a first-innings haul of five for 38, to a hamstring injury. 

Edwards went off having had Butt caught-behind but the other pacers carried on the good work done by skipper Shivnarine Chanderpaul. 

He remained unbeaten on 153 after scoring his 14th Test hundred to put his team in command before they were bowled out at the stroke of tea for 371 (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

The West Indies had taken a first-innings lead of 201 after bowling out Pakistan for 144 on the second day. 

Chanderpaul, who fell for 92 in the first innings, guided his team to a position of strength in a fourth-wicket stand of 134 with Wavell Hinds (52) on the third morning.

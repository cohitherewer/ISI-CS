 Sasikiran opens with victory

Malmo (Sweden): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran started off with a crushing victory over Emil Harminsson of Sweden in the first round of the Swedish chess tournament here. 

Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova, Jan Timman of the Netherlands, Jonny Hector of Sweden and Sasikiran emerged early leaders on one point and they are followed by top seed American teenager Hikaru Nakamura and Curt Hansen of Denmark who drew a tantalizing battle amongst themselves. 

Ending on the losing side were Tiger Hilarp Persson of Sweden, who was outclassed by Iordachescu, Sune Berg Hansen of Denmark, who fell to Hector, and Dane Davor Palo, who found his nemesis in Timman. 

The 10-player round robin event is being played in two parts: the first five rounds will be held here while the remaining four will be played in Copenhagen. It was a cautious start by Sasikiran, playing black, as the Indian has not quite been displaying his best form in the past few months. However, once Sasikiran got a position to his liking, he held Hermansson in a vice like grip and never let the advantage slip. 

The opening was Sasikiran?s pet brayer variation in the Ruy Lopez and it took a little time for him to get the dynamic balance ticking in his favour. A blitzkrieg in the centre in the middle game followed soon after, resulting in a loss of pawn for Hermansson, who failed to recover from the deficit. 

As the technicalities remained, Sasikiran was a class act in masterminding his winning plan in the rook and pawns end game as Hermansson watched Sasikiran?s king marching to the heart of his defences, doing the damage in quick time thereafter. Even though the game lasted till move 74, the result was anyone?s guess after move 50 itself. 

Even though Sasikiran was very impressive, oldest participant Timman recorded the most flamboyant victory of the day with his white pieces against Palo in an English opening game. 

Taking the game to unexplored territories in the middle game, Timman was quick to pounce on an opportunity to enter a better rooks end game and knocked down one pawn on the king side to romp home in 46 moves. 

Iordachescu had less hard work to do against Persson. The Pirc defence by the Swede gave Iordachescu an easy advantage in form of space control in the middle game and the latter nurtured it quite well to come out on top after a simple oversight by his opponent that netted a rook for knight. The game lasted 39 moves. (PTI)

 Argentina in quarters

Paris: Slovakia dethroned Spain as Davis Cup champions to reach the quarter finals where they will be joined by Australia and Argentina, who also wrapped up their World Group first round clashes. 

Claycourt specialists Spain were never comfortable on the fast indoor carpet surface in Bratislava, and were quickly put out of their misery on Saturday. Karol Beck and Michal Mertinak downed Rafael Nadal ? a hero of last year?s Davis Cup triumph ? and former French Open winner Albert Costa 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) to take an unassailable 3-0 lead. 

Australia completed a 5-0 whitewash of Austria in their first round tie by winning both the dead singles rubbers at Sydney?s International Tennis Centre on Sunday. Todd Woodbridge, drafted into singles in place of Lleyton Hewitt, beat Austrian stand-in Marco Mirnegg 6-3, 4-6, 7-5. Chris Guccione, also handed his first Cup match, beat Alexander Peya 6-3, 6-4. 

Australia will play Argentina in the quarter finals in Sydney in July. 

David Nalbandian and Guillermo Canas secured Argentina an unassailable 3-0 lead over the Czech Republic after winning the doubles in Buenos Aires, beating Jan Hernych and Tomas Zib 6-3, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. 

Arnaud Clement-Mickael Llodra gave France a 2-1 lead over Sweden. (AGENCIES)

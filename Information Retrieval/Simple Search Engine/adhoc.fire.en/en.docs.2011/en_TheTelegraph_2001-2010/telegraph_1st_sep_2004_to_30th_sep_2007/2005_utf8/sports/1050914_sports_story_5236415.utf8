 Moscow: A Chechen soccer club facing relegation from the Russian premier league has asked President Vladimir Putin for help, saying its survival would boost peace efforts in the volatile Caucasus region. Terek Grozny, sitting bottom of the table with eight games left, accused referees of trying to ensure that the club was relegated from the top division by repeatedly ruling against it.

 ?Today, Terek are more than a team for the Chechen Republic,? the club wrote in an open letter to Putin, published on its website www.terek-grozny.ru. ?It is annoying that the fate of a whole nation, its mood, is decided by referees... Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), we ask for your intervention in the situation.? Although the Kremlin has yet to respond to the letter, the pleas may strike a chord with Putin, who has been keen to stress that normality is returning to the war-ravaged region.

 Seoul: South Korea named former Holland manager Dick Advocaat as coach on Tuesday, entrusting their World Cup fortunes to another Dutchman. Advocaat becomes the third Dutchman in less than five years to take charge of South Korea after Guus Hiddink led the team to the 2002 World Cup semi-finals. Jo Bonfrere guided the Koreans to their sixth consecutive World Cup, in Germany next year. ?Dick Advocaat will lead the South Korean national team from Oct. 1,? KFA media director You Young-chuel said by telephone. ?The contract will run until the end of next year?s World Cup finals. There is an option to extend it if both parties agree.?

 London: Formula One?s governing body says it will help new teams into the sport in 2008 by slashing hundreds of millions of dollars off the cost of competing.

 ?New teams intending to apply to enter the championship in 2008 have all made it clear that they can do so only if costs are greatly reduced,? the International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in a statement on Tuesday. ?Current teams which are already committed for 2008 fully agree.?

 The FIA said it was, therefore, reviewing draft regulations for 2008 with a view to eliminating ?unnecessary and excessive? expenditure while permitting technology of public relevance. 

 London: The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), the governing body of British tennis, has put London?s historic Queen?s Club up for sale, it said on Tuesday. The sale is a 120-year lease. The LTA is relocating its headquarters by early 2007 to its new state-of-the-art tennis academy, the National Tennis Centre, currently under construction in Roehampton.

 The club will be sold on the basis that it will retain a rackets club and that the Stella Artois Championships or any future tournament remains unaffected.

 ?Moving to our new National Tennis Centre is an integral part of our plans for finding and developing future British tennis champions,? said LTA chief executive John Crowther.

 Queen?s boasts 29 outdoor courts ? of which 13 are among the finest grass courts in the world, eight are shale and clay, four plexi and four artificial grass.

 Beijing: Beijing will make a profit of about $16 million from the 2008 Olympics and the city intends to spend less than the previous hosts, Athens, on the mega sporting event which had cost the Greek capital $2.4 billion, a senior official said. ?Beijing will adhere to the principle of ?frugal Olympics? in organising the 2008 Games,? executive vice-president of Beijing Organising Committee Jiang Xiaoyu said.

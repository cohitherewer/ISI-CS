 Maharashtra enter final 

Kochi: Maharashtra put paid to Keralas aspirations of successful title-defence by notching up a solitary goal win in the first semi-final of the Santosh Trophy at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Friday. 

Reuben DSouza scored the all-important goal in the 51st minute. The defending champions dominated the proceedings but failed to capitalise on the innumerable chances that came their way. 

With time running out, Kerala coach Peethambaran brought in experienced I.M. Vijayan in place of medio Abdul Noushad, but the move didnt yield any result. 

Meanwhile, the tournaments disciplinary committee has recommended that action be taken against Manipurs Ingobi Singh, Manitombi Singh, Dharamjit Singh and Samson Singh for their on-field conduct in the quarter final league match against Goa. 

The match turned violent when Manipur players protested a goal scored by Goa with a few minutes left for the final whistle. They claimed that the game was restarted after a goal of their own before their team could settle down. (PTI)

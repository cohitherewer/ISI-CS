The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Refereeing irks Subrata

A STAFF REPORTER

 Subrata 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya wasn?t too willing to speak to the media after their pathetic 1-1 draw versus State Bank of Travancore (SBT) in their National Football League match. When he was coaxed into the press conference room, all he would talk about was the penalty that the club was denied in the 64th minute of the match. 

?Was that not a penalty?? he asked. ?Why are Mohun Bagan being always discriminated against? Why is it that we are the only ones that have goals against us disallowed? 

?I am telling you, and let this be said, that I am sure that was a penalty. Let the recording of that incident be studied. If I am proved wrong, I will resign, or let them (the AIFF) ban me. But if I am right, let them suspend the referee (Deepak Singh Bist of Delhi),? he said. ?This indirect free-kick inside the box is ridiculous.? 

However, according to Fifa rules, as clarified by refereeing expert Milan Dutta, ?infringements like obstruction, dangerous play (to an extent) will be an indirect free-kick anywhere on the pitch, even inside the box. However, if it?s a penal offence like tripping or pushing, it results in a penalty.? 

Whatever the formal opinion, the club has decided to go by the coach?s version, and will send a ?complaint to the AIFF against the referee?, as revealed by Balaram Chowdhury, the club?s assistant secretary. ?We will ask Alberto Colaco (the AIFF secretary) why we are always being discriminated against by referees in this league,? he said. There is a clause of viewing the recording as well. 

Bhattacharya was also not willing to accept that Mohun Bagan are out of the title race.

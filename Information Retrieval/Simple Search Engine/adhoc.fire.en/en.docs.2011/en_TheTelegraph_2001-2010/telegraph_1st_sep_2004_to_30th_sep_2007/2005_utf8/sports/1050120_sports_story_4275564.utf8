The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Clearance may come today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Asian Cricket Council and the Board of Control for Cricket in India are hopeful of a positive response from the Union finance ministry regarding tax exemption for the second tsunami fund-raiser. 

It is learnt that the clearance could come by Thursday afternoon, thereby facilitating holding of the match at the Eden in the second week of February. 

Meanwhile, International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed said in New Delhi on Wednesday that the decision on the venue will be made latest by Thursday. He also hoped that Eden Gardens would get to host the match. ?It will most likely be Calcutta,? Speed said. 

The delay on the decision on the match raised the spectre of the match?s likely shift from Calcutta. 

And the New Zealand matches apart, helping hands are available elsewhere as well, adds another report from London. 

English county side Surrey will stage a Twenty20 match between Asia and an international side at The Oval on June 20 to contribute to the tsunami appeal. 

Surrey said in a statement that the fixture had been 

approved by the ICC and the England and Wales Cricket Board. No teams have yet 

been announced but the club promised ?a galaxy of international stars?.

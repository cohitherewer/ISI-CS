 Sao Paulo turn heat on Liverpool

Tokyo: Sao Paulo turned the heat on Liverpool at the Fifa World Club Championship on Tuesday, with coach Paulo Autuori dismissing the English sides title ambitions. 

European champions Liverpool arrived in Japan on Monday with manager Rafael Benitez and his players expressing confidence they could return to England with the trophy. 

Autuori was unimpressed with Liverpools swagger. 

You must do your talking on the pitch, Autuori said on the eve of the South American champions semi-final against Saudi Arabias Al Ittihad in Tokyo. 

Liverpool can say what they want. They still have to back it up on the pitch. Right now Im more worried about Al Ittihad than Liverpool. 

We also have high expectations and feel confident we can take the Cup back to Brazil. 

Liverpools confidence was bolstered by a seventh straight Premier League victory at the weekend ? a 2-0 victory at home against Middlesbrough ? equalling a club record of 10 clean sheets. 

Benitez and captain Steven Gerrard said they had come to Japan with the aim of winning the revamped Fifa tournament. 

Liverpool are expected to beat Costa Ricas Deportivo Saprissa in Thursdays second semi-final and set up a showpiece final against Sao Paulo on Sunday. 

If much of the talk from the two camps is being lost in translation, Autuoris edginess has not been helped by Ittihads progress in the six-team tournament. 

Autuori had predicted Sao Paulo would be playing African champions Al Ahly, only for Ittihad to snap the Egyptian sides 55-match unbeaten run with a 1-0 win at the weekend. 

Ittihad work hard, they have quick players and they are tactically sound, said Autuori, who led Sao Paulo to their third Libertadores Cup title in July, two months after quitting as coach of Perus national team. 

But my players are all aware of their responsibility and Ive got faith that they will do the job tomorrow (Wednesday) and again on Sunday. 

Brazilian players have that little bit extra individual quality and I expect them to demonstrate that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 3-yr agreement

The following are the excerpts from the Media release issued in Kuala Lumpur on Friday: 

 The Asian Cricket Council and African Cricket Association have come together in a venture to promote and develop cricket across Asia and Africa. Peter Chingoka, president of the ACA, affirmed: We are confident that this agreement between the ACA and ACC will further strengthen existing ties between us. In a time of increasing global division, the body we have formed, the Afro-Asian Cricket Co-operation will be a substantial symbol of international unity. 

The agreement runs for three years, said Chingoka. Ten per cent of the net revenue from the staging of these ODIs will be donated to charity. 

The convenor of the Afro-Asian Cricket Co-operation will be Syed Ashraful Huq. There will also be a committee comprising three ACC and three ACA representatives. 

Huq, chief executive of the ACC, declared: We are joining in this landmark association in order to promote cricket at all levels. There will be representative age-group matches between the two continents in tournaments organised by us.

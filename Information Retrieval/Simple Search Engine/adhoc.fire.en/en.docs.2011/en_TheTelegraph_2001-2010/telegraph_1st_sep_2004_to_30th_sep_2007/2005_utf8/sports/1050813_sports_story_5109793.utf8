Springfield: Momentum is usually an important ingredient for golfers heading into major tournaments, but Thursdays opening round of the 87th PGA Championship at Baltusrol Golf Club proved to be an exception to the rule. 

Phil Mickelson, who hasnt been in contention at any of the years first three majors, found his way to a share of the lead with five others. Tiger Woods, looking to win three majors in the same season for the second time in his storied career, plunged to a tie for 113th in the field of 156. 

With a 3-under-par 67, Mickelson is tied at the top of the leader board with former British Open champion Ben Curtis, Stuart Appleby of Australia, transplanted Canadian Stephen Ames and a pair of South Africans, Trevor Immelman and Rory Sabbatini. 

Woods was eight strokes behind after equalling his worst score of the year, a 5-over-par 75. 

Youve got to stay patient, said Woods, who has won four times this year, most recently in last months British Open at St. Andrews. Its a process. The guys are not going to go out there and shoot 63s every day. (Im) still in the tournament, no doubt about it. 

Others were even more in the tournament than Woods. 

Eleven players, including two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa, former PGA champion Steve Elkington of Australia and Davis Love III, as well as two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer of Germany, were one stroke behind the leaders. 

Another 10 players, including former PGA champion and Ryder Cup captain Hal Sutton, former British Open champion Justin Leonard and Fred Funk, were two strokes behind at 1-under-par. A dozen more, led by two-time and defending champion Vijai Singh, were at even-par 70. 

The performance by Mickelson was reminiscent of what he did last year at the Masters in winning his first major championship. After taking three weeks off to prepare, he seemed more in control of his game and certainly more relaxed than he was at the years first three majors. 

A lot of times youve got to wait until you make a 35-footer for birdie, he said. Its very difficult to get the ball close to some of these pins. If you try to force it, youre going to end up making bogeys. 

Just ask Woods, who made four bogeys and a double bogey before finally making a birdie on his next-to-last hole.

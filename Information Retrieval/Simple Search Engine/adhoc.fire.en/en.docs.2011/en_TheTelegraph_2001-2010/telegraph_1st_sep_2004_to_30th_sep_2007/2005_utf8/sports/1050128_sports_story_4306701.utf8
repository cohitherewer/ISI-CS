 Gordon scripts a workbook

Sydney: Sachin Tendulkar and Ravi Shastri were among the 14 past and present Indian cricketers interviewed by Australian sports psychologist Sandy Gordon who has now come out with a workbook outlining the characteristics that defined tough Indian players. 

Gordon, who worked with the Indian team during the 2003 World Cup, has prepared a 24-point mental toughness ?inventory? and a 46-page workbook. ?After the World Cup I was approached and I think the feeling in India was that they wanted to improve their mental toughness.? Gordon said. (PTI)

 After Chelsea, City eye Manchester United 

 - PREMIER LEAGUE 

 Wright-Phillips will be itching to hit the target 

London: After throwing an unlikely spanner in Chelsea?s Premier League title bid last week, Manchester City will attempt to do the same against local rivals United on Sunday. 

Kevin Keegan?s team eked out a 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge, cutting Chelsea?s lead to nine points, and having claimed an identical result at United this season will be confident of upsetting their neighbours with home advantage. 

United, who have won 12 out of their last 14 league matches to keep within sight of leaders Chelsea, will have a point to prove after a 4-1 hammering in the corresponding fixture last season, a result that ended their title hopes. 

Shaun Wright-Phillips scored City?s fourth goal in that victory last March and the young striker will be itching to hit the target after wasting several chances in his first start for England against Holland on Wednesday. 

City ?keeper David James was inspired against Chelsea, producing a brilliant one-handed save to deny Frank Lampard in the dying minutes, and he will need to be at his sharpest to keep out United. 

England?s Wayne Rooney has scored five goals in his last seven games for Alex Ferguson?s side, while French striker Louis Saha is enjoying a run in the team after recovering from a persistent knee injury. 

A United win is essential if they are to keep up the pressure on Chelsea, who can move 12 points clear if they gain three points from a trip to fourth-placed Everton on Saturday. 

The Londoners will be without winger Arjen Robben, who has a broken foot, and coach Jose Mourinho will hope his team can continue to find attacking inspiration in the Dutchman?s absence to take full advantage of their remarkable defensive solidity. 

The Manchester City game was their ninth successive Premier League clean sheet and Everton strikers James Beattie, Marcus Bent and Duncan Ferguson will be hard-pushed to find a way past goalkeeper Petr Cech. 

David Moyes?s side claimed a last-gasp Bent goal to secure a fortunate 2-2 draw at Southampton last time out and their resilience and discipline should provide a tough test for Chelsea.

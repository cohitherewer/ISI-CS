 Setback for Sandipan

Pardudice: International Master S. Kidambi and S. Satyaprgyan made their presence felt, as most of the other Indians drew their games, on Friday, in Round VIII of the Czech International Open chess tournament. 

Kidambi beat Vladislav Kaprivin of Russia. But GM Sandipan Chanda received a set back, as he was held by Jakov Geller of Russia. The draw dashed Chandas hopes of finishing among the toppers.

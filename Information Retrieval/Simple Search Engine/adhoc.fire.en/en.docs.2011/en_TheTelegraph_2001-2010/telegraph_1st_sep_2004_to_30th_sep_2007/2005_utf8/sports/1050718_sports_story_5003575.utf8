Madrid: Russias Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva broke the womens pole vault record by sailing over 4.95m at the IAAF Super Grand Prix meeting on Saturday, (as briefly reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

The 23-year-old cleared the bar on her second attempt to break her own mark of 4.93m set in Lausanne on July 5. 

It was the 15th world record of Isinbayevas career and took her another step closer towards the record total of 35 set by Ukrainian pole vaulter Sergey Bubka. 

Bubka embraced the former gymnast after she soaked up the applause of an appreciative crowd in sweltering heat at the Vallehermoso Stadium. 

I knew I was ready to break the record again but it was quite difficult out there, said Isinbayeva. It was very hot and the wind was tricky too, but my coach kept telling me that my technique was good. 

It was a triumphant return to Madrid for the Russian who set her world indoor record of 4.92 when she competed in the Spanish capital at the European indoor championships back in March. 

Madrid is a very special place for me as Ive broken two world records here and the spectators were fantastic once again, she said. 

Isinbayevas latest record was a break from tradition, though, as she tends to set new marks one centimetre at a time but on this occasion she beat her previous best by two centimetres in her second attempt at the height. 

In Greece I failed at a new record of 4.94m so this time I decided to go for two more centimetres instead, explained the Russian. 

Im certainly on my way to reaching 5m but well just have to see when it can be done.

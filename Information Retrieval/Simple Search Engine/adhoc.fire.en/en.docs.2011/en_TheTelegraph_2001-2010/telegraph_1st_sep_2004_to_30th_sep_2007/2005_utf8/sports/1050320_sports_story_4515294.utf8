The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dravid made my task easier: Karthik

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Dinesh Karthik, whose career-best 93 and 165-run partnership with Rahul Dravid put India on a firm footing on the fourth day, was not affected by the pressure when he walked in to bat. India were 154 for four then and V.V.S. Laxman had just retired hurt (temporarily). The Pakistan bowlers were threatening to call the shots. 

?I was not really under pressure. Dravid was there at the other end and that made my task easier? I had confidence in my abilities,? the wicketkeeper-batsman said. 

Dravid, too, was all praise for the youngster. ?It was a crucial partnership, a critical phase of the match. Dinesh played beautifully, it was a fantastic knock by a youngster under pressure. 

?The balance could have tilted either way, but he played a stand-out innings. I just told him to believe in himself. He took time to settle down and then played his strokes,? the vice-captain explained. 

Karthik, too, did not forget to offer that congratulatory pat on the back of his senior partner once Dravid was dismissed for 135. ?I just told Dravid it?s been a great knock,? he said. 

But didn?t missing out on a Test hundred hurt him? ?I don?t know if it will hurt me for long. It?s sad to miss out on the hundred? Having contributed to the team cause gives immense satisfaction.?

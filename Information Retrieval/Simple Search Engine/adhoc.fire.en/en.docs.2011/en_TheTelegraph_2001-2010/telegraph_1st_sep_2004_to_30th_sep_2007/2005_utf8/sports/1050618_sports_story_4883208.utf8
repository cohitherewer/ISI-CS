 Greeks surrender 0-3 to Brazilian magic

 - Even without Cafu, Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo, world champions could have done more

Frankfurt: World Cup champions Brazil overwhelmed European champions Greece 3-0 in the Confederations Cup ? and it could have been worse for the Greeks. 

With both teams near full strength, Brazil dominated on goals by Adriano, Robinho and substitute Juninho Pernambucano (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

The eight-team Confederations Cup is a low-key prelude to the next years World Cup finals in Germany. But there was nothing laid back about Brazils win. 

For an opening game, Im satisfied with our performance, Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said. The balance was very good today. Everybody did his job, we played as a team. Weve still got a lot to do before the World Cup, but it was very encouraging. 

Brazil pressed for most of the first half before Adriano broke through with a spectacular goal in the 41st. Standing on the right wing, he faked left and right, and then stepped into a left-footed shot that slammed into the net from 25 m ? squeezing in between Greece goalkeeper Antonis Nikopolidis and the post to his left. 

Only 40 seconds into the second half, Brazils Robinho made it 2-0. After missing several chances in the first half, he scored coming down the right side, knocking the ball in off a pass from Gilberto. 

Juninho entered in the 77th, and scored four minutes later on a 25 yard free-kick that curled in high to Nikopolidis right. 

Its a big thing just to be here. We did what we could, Greece captain Theodoros Zagorakis said. We could have done better but it was a great experience for us. 

Brazil were missing fullbacks Cafu and Roberto Carlos and striker Ronaldo. All three are being rested. 

Greece were also nearly complete, featuring 18 players from last summers European Championship team. 

Mexicos win over Japan gives them a chance to make the semi-finals. 

Parreira says the depth of attacking talent at his disposal is causing him problems with the World Cup less than a year away. I can only play with two men up front and have five to choose from, Parreira said with a wry smile after the win. 

It is a major headache, but one that I have to solve. 

Robinho is a reality. He is a treasure, the coach enthused, adding that despite his relative youth and inexperience he was close to winning a starting place line-up. 

Midfielder Pernambucano is yet another attacking option in Brazils already formidable arsenal. 

The 27-year-old attacking midfielder, who has just won the French title with Olympique Lyon, believes the competition for places can only be good for the world champions. I am very pleased to hear Parreira say he has a problem and I am pleased he is talking about Robinho being in the team. That proves to me that Brazil are not just 11 players ? a first team and the reserves, he said. 

If the coach has a selection headache, it means he has a lot of options. It means he can adapt the team exactly to counter the opposition while keeping the basic line-up. 

It also means that he is looking to the players who are on the bench, it is a good situation to be one. 

Pernambucano came off the bench to replace Kaka after 77 minutes and made the most of his opportunity by scoring just four minutes later. 

I practise free kicks all the time in training, he said. And Ive scored 19 with Lyon in the last four years. That was my first for Brazil and I hope it will be the first of many.

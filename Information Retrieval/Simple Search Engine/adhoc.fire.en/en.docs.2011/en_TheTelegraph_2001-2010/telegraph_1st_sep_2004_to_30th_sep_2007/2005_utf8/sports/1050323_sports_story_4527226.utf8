 Injured Pollock ruled out 

Durban: Shaun Pollock?s ankle injury has ruled him out of the first Test against West Indies which starts in Georgetown, Guyana on March 31. 

?Shaun has a chronic, deep tendonitis injury caused by over-use and is taking a little bit longer to respond to treatment which is not uncommon with these types of injuries,? South Africa physio Shane Jabaar said on Tuesday. 

The United Cricket Board (UCB) said in a statement that seam bowler Pollock would remain at home in Durban to undergo treatment and a rehabilitation programme. 

?He will be monitored on a constant basis and should he show sufficient improvement and be able to bowl symptom-free, a decision on when he will join the tour will be taken at that time,? Jabaar added. 

The UCB did not name a replacement for Pollock. 

Pollock has struggled with the injury since England?s tour to South Africa earlier in the summer and he missed all three one-day Internationals and one of the two Tests South Africa played against touring Zimbabwe. 

South Africa?s other injury concerns yielded better news, with fast bowlers Charl Langeveldt and Andre Nel passing fitness tests on lower back and hamstring injuries respectively. Jabaar said allrounder Jacques Kallis was ?80 percent fit? following his hip injury. 

South Africa leave for the Caribbean on Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, South Africa coach Ray Jennings has targeted a 4-0 whitewash in the Test series against a West Indies side hit by a long-standing contract dispute. 

?With or without their best players, I want wins in the Tests and one-day Internationals. It?s the most crucial series of my career. I?m looking for a whitewash,? said Jennings.

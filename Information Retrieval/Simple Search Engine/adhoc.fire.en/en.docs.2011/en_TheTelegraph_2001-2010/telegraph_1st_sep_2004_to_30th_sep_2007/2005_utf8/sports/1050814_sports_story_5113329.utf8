The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg talks, but only generally

 - Sourav keeps low profile at 1ST selection meeting after getting back captaincy 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Greg Chappell 

 may have identified the players whose attitude was found 

 wanting in Sri Lanka, during his interaction with Board 

 secretary S.K. Nair and chief selector Kiran More on Friday, 

 but spoke in general terms at Saturdays 

 selection committee meeting. 

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, the coach talked about the casual approach 

 to nets and gym work on the part of some during the 

 recent tri-series, but didnt mention names. 

Surprisingly, the selectors ? who picked the tri-series and Test squads for Zimbabwe ? didnt ask Chappell to be specific either. 

Perhaps, it suited everybody to not open up the proverbial Pandoras box at a critical moment for Team India? 

To speak of the meeting, one learns neither the coach nor captain Sourav Ganguly sought the inclusion of anybody in particular and seemed happy with the job done by More and his colleagues ? Yashpal Sharma, Pranab Roy, Gopal Sharma and V.B.Chandrasekhar. 

Having just got back the captaincy, Sourav probably kept a low profile intentionally. 

Meanwhile, the exclusion of Anil Kumble and V.V.S. Laxman from the tri-series squad suggests their ODI career is over. 

Making a comeback is going to be very tough for Laxman. 

The recall of Ajit Agarkar and Murali Kartik, by the way, has much to do with the experimental ODI rules being in vogue during the August 24-September 6 tri-series. 

Kartik, after all, can be fielded as a bowler and Agarkar brought on as his substitute ? exclusively for batting, that is. 

Equally, Agarkar may be played as a bowler and, then, substituted by a specialist batsman. 

Its because of the substitution rule that Jai Prakash Yadav retained his berth even though he didnt make the XI in any of the five matches in Sri Lanka. 

Yadavs presence will give the thinktank options, is how one of the selectors put it. 

The selectors, one understands, havent decided on a stand-by for Sachin Tendulkar. 

If the maestro doesnt recover even for the Test series, either Suresh Raina or Yalaka Venugopal Rao could stay back. 

 Sachin, who underwent surgery on his left elbow in 

 London, has been off cricket for almost three months.

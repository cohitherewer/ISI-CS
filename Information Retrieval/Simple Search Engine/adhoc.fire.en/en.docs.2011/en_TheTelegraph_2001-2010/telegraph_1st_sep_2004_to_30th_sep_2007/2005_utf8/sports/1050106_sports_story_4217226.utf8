 Satyapragyan in 4-way lead

New Delhi: Overnight joint leader Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte surprisingly settled for a quick draw as lower ranked players took the honours in the fourth round of the third Parsvnath International Open chess meet here Wednesday. 

International Master S. Satyapragyan, R.R. Laxman, Deep Sen Gupta, R. Preetham Sharma made most of their opportunities to maintain a cent percent win record and lead the 283-player fray with four points each. 

Fifteen players, including top seed GM K. Sasikiran and Kunte chase the leaders and are half-a-point adrift with seven rounds to go in this Rs six lakh prize money event. 

On the top board, Kunte, with black pieces, employed Retti opening and to the surprise of his opponent, D. Sai Srinivas, offered truce after just 12 moves. The Andhra youngsters had little hesitation in accepting the draw offer to take his points tally to 3.5 points out of possible four. 

Satyapragyan played irregular opening and advanced in an ?unplanned? fashion which his Uzbek opponent IM Bahodir Holmirzaev could not counter and blundered with a pawn at G4. (PTI)

Montreal: Plenty of questions were left unanswered at the 11th World Championships that finished on Sunday even if there were no major surprises. 

Swimmings world order remained the same as at last years Athens Olympics with the United States retaining their position at the top and Australia closing on them in second place. 

There was little significant movement from the other nations although Africa confirmed its position as a growing force in swimming with Zimbabwe and South Africa each winning two titles. 

The Netherlands, without Pieter van den Hoogenband and Inge de Bruijn, failed to win a single gold while China also came up empty-handed. 

Everyone expected the Chinese to resurface as a power with the countdown to the 2008 Beijing Olympics gathering pace but a dismal performance left rivals confused and set tongues wagging. 

When theyre not participating like they were expected to here, then you kind of wonder what are they doing, who are they hiding? US mens head coach Dave Salo said. 

Michael Phelps finished the eight-day meet as the most decorated athlete with five gold medals but the jury is still out on his performance. 

The American had been attempting to win a record eight titles, a task made even harder by his decision to drop some of his favourite events in search of new challenges. 

Phelps retained his 200 metres individual medley crown and won his world freestyle title with victory in the 200 but bombed out in the heats of the 400, finished seventh in the 100 final and second behind Ian Crocker in the 100 butterfly, blowing his chance of swimming the medley relay final. 

This has been a big wake-up call, Phelps said. What happened here Im going to use as motivation in the coming year to get back to my best times. 

The absence of so many Olympic champions, including Ian Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, de Bruijn and Yana Klochkova of Ukraine, led to calls for the championships to be switched back to every four years instead of every two. 

There was little argument over who was the success of the meet as Australias Grant Hackett, 25, put Phelps and the absent Thorpe in the shade with stunning victories in the 400, 800 and 1500. He won the 400 to become the first swimmer to win gold medals at four world meets, broke Thorpes world record to add the 800 and then demolished his rivals to win the 1500 and become the first swimmer to win the same event four times and the first to win seven individual world titles in a career. 

South African Roland Schoeman broke the world record twice in 24 hours to win the 50 metres butterfly and then added the 50 freestyle title to enhance his claims as the worlds fastest man in water, while 35-year-old German doctor Mark Warnecke became the oldest world champion in history with a shock win in the 50 metres breaststroke. 

Zimbabwes Kirsty Coventry was a deserving winner of the award for the best female swimmer after winning two gold and two silver medals, single-handedly ensuring her troubled nation finished third in the medals table.

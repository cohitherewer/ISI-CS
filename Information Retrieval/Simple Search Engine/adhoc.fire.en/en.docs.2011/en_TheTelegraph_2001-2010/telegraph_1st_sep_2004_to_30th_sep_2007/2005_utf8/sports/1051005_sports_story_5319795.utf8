 London: South Korea?s K.J. Choi climbed 17 places to 30th in the world rankings after winning his first PGA Tour title in three years at the Greensboro Classic in North Carolina.

 The 35-year-old fired a six-under-par 66 for a two-shot victory over Japan?s Shigeki Maruyama at Forest Oaks Country Club on Sunday.

 Choi?s third career title on the PGA Tour was his first since the 2002 Tampa Bay Classic.

 On the European Tour, Colin Montgomerie secured his first win in 19 months at the Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews on Sunday and returned to the world?s top 20 after an absence of two and a half years. The 42-year-old Briton, second in the world rankings in 1996 and 1997, climbed seven spots to 16th.

 Paris: Juventus striker David Trezeguet is out of the France squad to face Switzerland and Cyprus in their last two World Cup qualifiers, the French federation announced on Tuesday.

 Trezeguet picked up a thigh injury during his club?s 2-0 Serie A victory over Inter Milan at the weekend and Juventus said on Monday the player would have to rest for up to 10 days.

 France will also be without Thierry Henry (groin injury) and Gael Givet (thigh injury).

 France travel to Switzerland on Saturday and entertain Cyprus four days later.

 Madrid: Argentine teenage prodigy Lionel Messi could again find himself barred from appearing for Barcelona in the Primera Liga because of arguments over the validity of his playing licence.

 A lawyer acting for Deportivo la Coruna told the Spanish football federation (RFEF) on Monday that the 18-year-old should not be allowed to play because he had been granted Spanish citizenship after the August 31 deadline for registration of players.

 Last week Messi was granted Spanish citizenship and went on to play in Barca?s 2-2 draw at home to Real Zaragoza in the league. If his registration is declared to be unsound then Zaragoza could try and get the result of the game overturned.

 London: World No. 5 Justine Henin-Hardenne will not play in next year?s Fed Cup for Belgium due to health reasons. The French Open champion, who has been dogged by fitness problems over the past two years, told a Belgian newspaper that her priority was to win back her No. 1 ranking.

 ?I will not play Fed Cup in 2006,? she said. ?This year has been hard enough as regards my health and I want first of all to see if I can last a whole season. I want to regain the number one ranking in 2006. I don?t think it is impossible.?

 Her decision, while not unexpected, is a blow to Belgium who could face Fed Cup holders Russia in April without their two best players. The participation of Kim Clijsters is also in doubt.

 London: Tennis is stepping up its fight against drugs cheats by unifying the sport?s Anti-Doping Programme.

 The ITF, which organises Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup, is to manage and enforce the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (TADP) at men?s ATP events from next year.

 The move will unify drug-testing in the sport and the ITF also hopes to bring organisers the WTA into the fold. 

 The TADP is fully compliant with the WADA code.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Slovakia crush Argentina to title

 Slovakia?s Daniela Hantuchova and Dominik Hrbaty hold up the trophy while Lucy Hopman, widow of Australian legend Harry, congratulates them in Perth on Saturday 

Perth: Slovakia clinched the Hopman Cup for the second time when they crushed Argentina 3-0 in Saturday?s final. 

Daniela Hantuchova and Dominik Hrbaty had given Slovakia an unassailable 2-0 lead before they won the final mixed doubles via a walkover because of Guillermo Coria?s sore back. 

Former world No.5 Hantuchova recovered from a terrible start to beat Gisela Dulko 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 and put the third seeds ahead. 

Hrbaty, who had not lost a set in his three singles matches in the group stages, then upset world number seven Coria 6-4, 6-1 to help erase the memories of 2004 when the Slovaks lost to the US in the final. 

?I would like to congratulate Daniela,? Hrbaty said. ?I was so nervous watching her today, I almost had a heart attack. 

?I also feel a little sorry for Guillermo because I get very excited whenever I play for my country. I show lots of emotions and played such good tennis today.? 

World number 14 Hrbaty was in imperious form as he sauntered past Coria in just 58 minutes. 

The Argentine struggled with a sore back in the second set but Hrbaty showed no mercy in wrapping up victory with another backhand winner. 

World No.31 Hantuchova, ranked two places above Dulko, had won two of her three matches in the run-up to the final but looked nervous as she dropped the first four games of the match. 

Dulko, who had lost all three of her singles matches in the group stages, grew in confidence and took the first set in just 27 minutes before Hantuchova hit back in a second set littered with breaks to draw level. 

Dulko had an early chance to break in the second game of the deciding set, but the contest stayed with serve until the seventh game when a double fault from the Argentine gave Hantuchova the vital break. 

?I was so nervous because I really wanted to win for the team and for Dominik as he played so well all week,? Hantuchova said. 

?I didn?t think I was playing my best but I just tried to hang in there and fight hard for every point for my country.? 

With Coria nursing his back, the walkover completed a 3-0 win, although Hrbaty and Hantuchova beat Dulko and her brother Alejandro 8-4 in an exhibition pro set. 

Slovakia won the Cup on their first appearance in 1998, when Karol Kucera and Karina Habsudova led them to victory over France.

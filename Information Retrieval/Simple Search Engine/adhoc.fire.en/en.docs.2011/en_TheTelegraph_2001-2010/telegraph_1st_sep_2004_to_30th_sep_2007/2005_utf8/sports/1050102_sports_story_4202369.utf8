Chennai: In what promises to be a veritable treat for tennis fans, defending champion Carlos Moya of Spain, Paradorn Srichapan of Thailand and a host of other top players will battle it out in the ATP Chennai Open beginning on Monday. 

Defending champion and world No. 5 Moya, who scored over Srichaphan for the title last year and went on to win three singles titles on the tour before his sweetest victory over the US to clinch the Davis Cup for Spain, is the favourite to retain the title. 

As for the chances of the Indians in the fray as per the draw taken on Saturday, it would a Herculean task for them, perhaps, excepting Paes, a wild card entrant, who is pitted against Yen-Hsun Lu of Taipei, ranked 86 in the world. 

Prakash Amritraj, the highest ranked Indian in singles play on the ATP circuit at 222, would clash with Ivo Heuberger of Switzerland but has a tough road ahead. If Amritraj wins his first-round match, he has the difficult task of beating Moya in the second round. 

Another wild card, Karan Rastogi, the up and coming star from the country, will play fourth seed Bjorkman in the first round. 

Meanwhile, India?s Olympic partners Mahesh Bhupathi and Paes were set to face off in the doubles final after they were seeded one and two respectively in the meet. 

Bhupathi and Swedish partner Jonas Bjorkman were top seeded while Paes will pair up with Serbia?s Nenad Zimonjic. 

Bhupathi and Paes won four titles here in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2002. 

Amritraj cousins, Prakash and Stephen, were drawn in the same half of Paes with a wild card. 

The only siblings to have won the doubles event in the tournament?s history are the Black brothers ? Byron and Wayne of Zimbabwe ? in 2001. 

Vishal Uppal and Mustafa Ghouse are the other wild cards. 

Bhupathi also said on Saturday that the ideal doubles final match in Chennai Open should be between his team and Paes?. 

?That should be the ideal final. We have to win three matches like Leander and company. But Bjorkman and I are focussed on winning the championship,? Bhupathi said, while talking to reporters at the draw ceremony. 

Bjorkman said: ?I am right now focussed with Mahesh for the year. Mahesh is an excellent player. I also revel in backhand court play like him (Mahesh). Hope, I will be able to match his game and win many tournaments in 2005,? the Swede said. 

On whether he will partner Australian Todd Woodbridge again, the Swede said ?only the future can tell.? 

The tournament in its ninth year, which is getting stronger and stronger by the year vis-a-vis participation of top 100 players, would be held at the SAF Games Tennis Stadium from January 3-9.

 Prakash: Issue wont affect us

New Delhi: Prakash Amritraj said on Saturday that the controversy over Harsh Mankads selection will not affect the Indian teams morale. 

It is difficult to pay attention to these things. Personally, I have been practising hard and if all the players are focussed on getting themselves prepared, that is what matters, he said. 

Harsh Mankad had earlier confirmed on Friday that he would be joining the Indian Davis Cup squad for the world group play-off tie.

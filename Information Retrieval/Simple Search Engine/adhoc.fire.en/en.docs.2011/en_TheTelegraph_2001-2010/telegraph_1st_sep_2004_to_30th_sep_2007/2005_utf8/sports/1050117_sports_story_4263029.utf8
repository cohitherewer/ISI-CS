 Dempo beat JCT 1-0

Margao: Dempo Sports Club beat JCT 1-0 in the opening round of the ninth National Football League at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. 

The all-important goal was scored in the 63rd minute by Riston Rodrigues. 

The Dempo players, who were mourning the tragic death of Brazilian striker Cristiano Junior, wore black arm-bands as a mark of respect. 

The Goans controlled the proceedings and had more of ball possession in the first-half which was mostly confined to the midfield as both the teams failed to take proper shot on goal. Though Dempo created more openings they were kept at bay by the JCT defenders. 

Changing ends, Dempo continued their dominance and after missing a close chance, took the lead when Rodrigues? 30-yard-shot off a pass from Man-of-the-Match Jose Colaco found the net. 

Sangram injured 

East Bengal captain and custodian Sangram Mukherjee required four stitches on his head following a goalmouth tussle in a inter-railway football tie at Kalyani on Sunday. Sangram was playing for Metro Railways against South Central, adds A Staff Reporter from Calcutta. 

Sangram said it was ?nothing serious?, and was hopeful of travelling with East Bengal to Goa Monday for their next set of National Football League matches.

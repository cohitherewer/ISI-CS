 Maiden title for Bhupathi, Woodbridge

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and his new partner Todd Woodbridge claimed their first title on Saturday, thus warming up nicely for next week?s Australian Open. 

Third seeds Bhupathi and Woodbridge beat Frenchmen Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra 6-3, 6-3 in the final of the $419,000 ATP event in Sydney, according to information received here. 

Earlier, the Indo-Australian pair had defeated Jurgen Melzer and Max Mirnyi 6-1, 6-3 while Clement and Llodra had got the better of Igor Andreev and Nikolay Davydenko 7-6, 6-3. 

This is Bhupathi?s 37th career doubles crown. In three previous partnerships with the legendary Woodbridge, though, the Indian had drawn a blank. (PTI)

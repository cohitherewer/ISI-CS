The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid should come in at No. 3

Sri Lanka pulled off a splendid win over India in a low-scoring game where the thrills came from the fall of wickets than any spectacular display of shot-making. It was that talented batsman, Mahela Jayawardene, who swung the game around for the hosts with a display of grit where he first tried to get his form back and then with the gutsy Chandana, saw his team through with a couple of overs to spare. 

The Indians tried everything, but were simply unable to break the partnership and had to come second-best again. This game was important from the psychological point of view as a win here would have boosted the Indian teams morale for, in recent times, they have not been able to beat the Lankans, especially on their pitches. 

Sri Lanka were also without their two experienced players Sanath Jayasuriya and Chaminda Vaas, and they did not miss them. By resting them and giving them the chance to get fitter by the final on Tuesday, the Lankans have shown farsightedness. Even when it rains in Sri Lanka, the temperature hardly goes down and the increased humidity can really take a heavy toll of ones energies. 

India, therefore, have to look at that aspect when they pick the team for the game against the West Indians. Though they would no doubt want most of their players to get as much match practice as possible, it still makes sense to look at the workload that the players are going to have, particularly the bowlers. 

Ganguly and Laxmans return meant Raina had to go down the order once again. The former captain took his time and understandably so, for he was coming back to international cricket after a while, and it was a good thing to see him become the second Indian to get to 10,000 runs in limited overs cricket. 

And to think if he hadnt hit that bad patch, he could well have become the fastest to that mark, but cricket history is strewn with instances of players somehow losing their form as they near a mark. 

With V.V.S. Laxman also taking his time to settle down, India were pushed back in the scoring rate. While a newcomer would have been pilloried, there wont be much comment on the seniors slowing it down. 

The new-ball bowlers gave the team a good start, but with Jayawardene finding form at the right time, the Sri Lankans were through comfortably. India can learn a lesson from the way Jayawardene and Chandana applied themselves and, more importantly, made sure that the win was not left to somebody else to complete. 

India have some other problems too, and thats the form of Sehwag at the top of the order. He is struggling a bit on the slowish pitches and hasnt been able to get into any kind of rhythm. Dravid is the only batsman in any sort of touch, and he has to look at coming at his usual number three, for the man in form has to get as many balls to score off, than a batsman out of touch. 

India have shown that they are not going to stick to the orthodox methods as far as selection is concerned, so there could well be some changes for the next game against the West Indies.

London: Former winners Feyenoord and Galatasaray bowed out of the Uefa Cup on Thursday as Rapid Bucharest and Tromso secured surprise places in the group stage. 

Holders CSKA Moscow made light of an injury crisis to ease through 6-2 on aggregate against FC Midtjylland. Brazilian playmaker Daniel Carvalho repeated his first-leg feat by scoring twice in a 3-1 win in Denmark. 

Dutch league leaders Feyenoord, who won the trophy at their own De Kuip stadium in 2002, lost 0-1 in Romania as Rapid Bucharest advanced 2-1 on aggregate. 

Mugurel Buga headed Rapids winner after 12 minutes. Tromso, a modest 10th in the 14-team Norwegian championship, dumped out 2000 winners Galatasaray after a 1-1 draw in Istanbul put them through 2-1. 

Canada midfielder Patrice Bernier fired Tromso ahead before Hakan Sukur replied late on. Bayer Leverkusen, still searching for a coach after Matthias Sammer turned the former Champions League finalists down earlier this week, were knocked out by CSKA Sofia. 

The Bundesliga side, who lost the first leg at home 0-1, a defeat which led to the dismissal of coach Klaus Augenthaler, succumbed to a 67th-minute goal by Moroccan international Mourad Hdiouad as the Bulgarians booked their place in the group stage with a 2-0 aggregate victory. 

Bundesliga rivals VfB Stuttgart sneaked through despite a 0-1 defeat in Slovenia against NK Domzale.

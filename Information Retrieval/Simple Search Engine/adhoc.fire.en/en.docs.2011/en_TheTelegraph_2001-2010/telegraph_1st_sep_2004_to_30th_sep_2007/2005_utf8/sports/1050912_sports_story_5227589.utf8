 Another 5-wkt haul for Kartik

London: Murali Kartik stole the show by taking 10 wickets ? five in each innings ? for Lancashire in their four-day match against Essex in a Frizzle County Championships (Division II) match on Sunday. 

The Indian left-arm spinner, who returned impressive figures of five for 93 on his debut, took five for 75 in the second innings as Essex were bowled out for 227 shortly after resuming on Sunday at 144 for six. 

Kartik, who took four for 33 Saturday, scalped Andre Adams (19) for his fifth wicket. 

Yesterday, he had opener Williams Jefferson caught by Anderson when he was blazing at 35 off 36 deliveries, before removing the middle order by ousting Flower brothers Grant (13) and Andy (Five) to leave Essex struggling at 84 for four. His fourth victim was Darren Gough (15). 

Earlier, Lancashire made 340 in reply to Essexs 267 in their first innings. (PTI)

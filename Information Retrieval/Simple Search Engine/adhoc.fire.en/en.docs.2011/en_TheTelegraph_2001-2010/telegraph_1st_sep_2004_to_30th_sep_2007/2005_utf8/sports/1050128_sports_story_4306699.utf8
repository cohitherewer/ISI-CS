 Petition filed against BCCI

New Delhi: A petition demanding that the government take over the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has been made to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. 

The petition, filed by Bangalore-based advocate S. Umesh, demanded that all government privileges extended to the BCCI be withdrawn with immediate effect since the board has taken a stand that it was a private club. (PTI)

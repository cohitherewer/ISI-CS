 Gayle, Sarwan end conflicting contracts

Georgetown: Two West Indies players ended endorsement contracts with a telecommunications company that resulted in their omission from the Test squad against South Africa, their lawyer has said. 

Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle ended their contracts with Cable and Wireless ?in the interest of their careers and, they believe, in the interest of West Indies cricket,? said Sanjeev Datadin, an attorney for both men. 

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said it was aware of the decision by Sarwan and Gayle but said the 13-member squad for the first Test, which started on Thursday, remained unchanged. They could possibly play in the remainder of the series. 

Sarwan and Chris Gayle were among six players with Cable and Wireless contracts who were barred from playing in the first Test against South Africa in Georgetown. The WICB said their contracts conflicted with the board?s sponsorship deal with Digicel, a Cable and Wireless competitor. 

Captain Brian Lara also initially was barred but later invited to play. His contract with Cable and Wireless differed from the other six because it had been signed with the boards consent. Lara, however, said he wouldn?t accept the invitation unless the six others also were allowed to return. (AP)

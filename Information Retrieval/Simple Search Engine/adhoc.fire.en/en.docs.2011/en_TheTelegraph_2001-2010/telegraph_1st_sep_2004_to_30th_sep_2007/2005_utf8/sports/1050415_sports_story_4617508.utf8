 Player arrested on pitch

 Rio de Janeiro: An Argentine footballer was 

 arrested on the pitch for racially insulting an Brazilian 

 opponent during a Libertadores Cup match in Sao Paulo on 

 Wednesday. 

 Quilmes defender Leandro Desabato was arrested at 

 the end of his team?s 1-3 defeat by Sao Paulo over an incident 

 involving rival striker Grafite during the first half. 

Desabato was taken to a nearby police station with club officials for questioning, Brazilian television said. He spent Wednesday night in custody, a Sao Paulo police spokesman said on Thursday. 

The incident took place during first half injury time. Desabato appeared to make a comment to Grafite who pushed his hand in Desabato?s face. Grafite was sent off along with Quilmes midfielder Carlos Arano, but no action was taken against Desabato by the referee. 

 Quilmes left the field at the end of the game amid 

 chaotic scenes that continued outside their dressing room 

 where dozens of Brazilian cameramen and photographers waited 

 for the visiting players.

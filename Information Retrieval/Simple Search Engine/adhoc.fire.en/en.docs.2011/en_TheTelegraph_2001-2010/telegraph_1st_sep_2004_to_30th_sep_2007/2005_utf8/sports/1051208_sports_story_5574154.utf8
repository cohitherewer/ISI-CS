The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav among 7 invited today 

 - Sharad Pawar takes initiative for interaction 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly 

Calcutta: Sharad Pawar, who became the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president last week, has invited seven seniors for a chat in New Delhi on Thursday evening. Not that the Union minister needs to introduce himself, but that will still be his first interaction as supremo. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, both current captain Rahul Dravid and predecessor Sourav Ganguly are on the list of invitees. The others are: Vice-captain Virender Sehwag, senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, V.V.S. Laxman and Harbhajan Singh. 

All are in the Team India squad for the second Test against Sri Lanka, at the Kotla, from Saturday. 

Till late on Wednesday, coach Greg Chappell wasnt an invitee. Mr Pawar has indicated he wishes to have a session with the players only. Of course, he may change his mind, a source pointed out. 

Among other things, Pawar could use the occasion to talk about the contracts which have to be offered afresh quickly. The ones signed last year, after many rounds of dialogue between the BCCI brass and the players, lapsed on September 30. 

Meanwhile, the BCCIs marketing committee is to meet earlier in the day. Key decisions are awaited.

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly didnt expect his six-match ODI ban to be reduced to four. Frankly speaking, I am a bit surprised, Sourav said on Friday. 

Sourav, who has been included in the Sri Lanka-bound squad as the 16th member, will now head for Colombo on Sunday. I will try to perform well there and Im ready to bat at any position according to the teams priority. But it is true that I have got most of my runs as an opener? he stated. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC)-appointed arbiter Justice Albie Sachs, on Thursday, recommended to reduce the ban by one-third. Sourav has already sat out for two matches and so is eligible to play from the third match of the tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

The elegant lefthander, however, seemed relieved after Sachs decision. Its definitely a good opportunity for me to get back to international cricket and I feel Im in good form at the moment, he said. 

On playing under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid, Sourav said: I have no problem playing even under the likes of Harbhajan Singh or Virender Sehwag. Its an honour to play for the country and Im keen to do so. 

On reaching Colombo on Sunday, he may join teammates in Damulla on the very day. 

Sourav also visited a city hospital to see his ailing grandfather Sachchidananda Chatterjee, who suffered a cerebral attack on Tuesday afternoon. Sourav turned up at the hospital early in the morning and spent more than an hour there. 

In the evening, Sourav sweated it out for an hour at the CAB gymnasium. He also had a brief discussion with East Bengals British physical trainer Peter McKnight, besides having a one-on-one session with Bengal fitness trainer Ranadeep Moitra.

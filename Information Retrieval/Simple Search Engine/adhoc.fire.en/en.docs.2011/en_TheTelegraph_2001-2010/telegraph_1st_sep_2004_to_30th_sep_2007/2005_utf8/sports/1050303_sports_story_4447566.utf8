Calcutta: Winston Churchill once said that a pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity whereas an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. 

Going by the recent show of Mohun Bagan under Subrata Bhattacharya, one wonders how many people would raise their hands for the optimist?s role as the team?s self-belief seems to have taken a dip. Spirit and sprightliness of the players has settled in a desert of despondency. 

Wednesday?s listless, yawn-generating goalless draw with Salgaocar in the National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium lends further credence to the fact that an air of ennui is deep-rooted in Bhattacharya?s brigade ? so deep that it seems even a psychiatrist one day, Team India captain Sourav Ganguly another, or may be even a Churchill on some other day, is not the solution. 

Mohun Bagan and Salgaocar are both on 12 points, but the former have played a game less, at 10. 

Against Salgaocar, Bhattacharya opted for a double-pronged attack in Roberto Mendes Silva Beto and Ashim Biswas, with clear indications that the midfielders must reinforce the offensive moves every now and then. 

So you got crosses from the wings ? mostly ill-directed ? and Mehrajuddin Wadao and Eduardo Coelho moving up in case of set-piece moves. 

Salgaocar, predictably, decided to offer resistance instead of being adventurous. Savio Medeira went for a ?cone? formation, as the Goan visitors lined up seven players at and around the base, with Bello Rassaq leading the charge in emptying out the rival thrusts. Salgaocar were intent on possessing the ball as long as possible and not quite on utilising the breaks. 

Mohun Bagan clearly missed a leader in the midfield ? Rennedy Singh is yet to get into groove and his substitute, Basudeb Mondal, was slow in creating spaces for the offensive line. 

Then, there was Beto, the Man of the Match and the only player in the Mohun Bagan team, who at least was honest with his efforts. A couple of his side-volleys went off target and on another occasion, he could not convert a brilliant solo run into the goal. 

If Beto could be pardoned, at least for the way he had tried to make things happen, Sunil Chettri should be blamed for ruining a clear sitter. Dharamjit Singh?s long pass found him in the clear around the rivals? half-line. But his cut-back was awful, allowing the defenders to catch up with him from behind. 

Finally, there was the coach Bhattacharya. He once again skipped the post-match press conference and left by the team bus to the crowd?s jeers.

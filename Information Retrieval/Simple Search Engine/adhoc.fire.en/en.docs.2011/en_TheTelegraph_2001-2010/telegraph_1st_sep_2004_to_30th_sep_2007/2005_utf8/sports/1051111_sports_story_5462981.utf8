 IN THE CITY

 Following a request from the East Bengal Club, AIFF is likely to allow three foreigners for the IFA Shield, Durand Cup and Rovers Cup this season. ?Since the players will be in the national camp, the club teams will be weaker, and so if we can allow three of the foreign recruits to turn out in these meets, it will help them,? AIFF vice-president Subrata Dutta said on Thursday. 

 A total of 12 teams will be taking part in the seven-a-side invitational football meet for the Playwin Trophy at the Deshapriya Park on Saturday-Sunday. The meet jointly organised by IFA and DKS will involve top 10 teams from the Buladi Pada Football and two other local teams divided in four groups.

 Pankaj Advani starts with thumping win 

New Delhi: Former world champion Pankaj Advani registered impressive breaks en route to a thumping 4-1 victory in the opening round of junior section in the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championships in Manama, Bahrain, on Tuesday. 

The 20-year-old Indian, who had a below-par outing in the Asian Championships in Bangkok last month, proved to be a big bet for Patrick Einsle, Germanys No. 4, in the 73-45, 75-0, 108-4, 30-59, 60-7 win in group UD, according to information received here. 

Advani warmed up in the first frame by leaving space for the Einsle to score points but thrashed him in the next frame notching up a break of 73. 

He decorated his score by crossing the century mark in the third frame but faltered in the next. However, he came back strongly in the last frame asserting his superiority. 

Mumbai-based Rishabh Thakkar has decided against taking part in the competition as he is suffering from leptospirosis. 

Geet Sethi will begin his campaign against Guloom Abbas of Bahrain in group SB1 in the seniors category. 

Meanwhile, Sethi, former world billiards champion, feels Advani has the potential to win 10 world billiards titles, if he opts to stick to the three ball game instead of snooker. 

Sethi, who has won seven world billiards crowns, says Advani is capable of breaking both his records ? the highest break of 1,276 and the number of his world titles.

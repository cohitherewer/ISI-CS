 Das, Gavaskar take Bengal to 220/4

 Rohan Gavaskar is unbeaten on 71 

Mumbai: Bengal batsmen were ultra-defensive after having conceded a first innings lead to Mumbai and crawled their way to 220 for four in 102.4 overs in their second innings on Day III of the Ranji Trophy Elite Division group A match here on Sunday. 

Resuming at 37 for no loss after a first innings deficit of 73 runs, Bengal made it clear that their aim was to deny Mumbai an outright victory and an additional two points from the tie. 

Arindam Das, who took over seven hours in making 70 from 266 balls, and former captain Rohan Gavaskar, who remained unbeaten at close with 71 after a stay of 217 minutes, epitomised their goal. 

The third wicket duo put on 97 runs in 37 overs as the score advanced from 92 for two to 189 before Das gave a catch to Onkar Khanvilkar off Nilesh Kulkarni. 

Earlier, his opening partner Subhamoy Das was out for a more strokeful 42 with seven hits to the fence and one-down Devang Gandhi fell for 14. 

At stumps, Rohan, and Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta were at the crease. The visitors were ahead by 147 runs with six wickets in hand.

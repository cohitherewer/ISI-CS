Port Elizabeth: Justin Kemp survived a number of chances to smash 78 not out and steer South Africa to a five-wicket win over Zimbabwe (as reported in Thursday?s Late City edition) in the third and final one-day International on Wednesday. 

Kemp, who enjoyed the benefit of doubt on a caught-behind decision first ball and was dropped twice, lifted South Africa from 79 for four to 207 for five in 46.3 overs. 

Zimbabwe, aided by the return of former captain Heath Streak ? who was making his first international appearance since ending a year-long dispute with the Zimbabwean board ? made 206 for eight in their 50 overs. 

Streak, who scored a battling 68, steadied the innings after the visitors had slumped to 35 for five, with partnerships with Brendan Taylor (41) and Gavin Ewing (46) to post a respectable total. 

?I was a bit nervous, especially because of the situation when I came in to bat,? said Streak. ?The important thing was to chip in. 

?I decided to stay till the end of the innings and play each ball on its merit. The important thing was to keep the ball on the ground and not try to play too many special shots.? 

Zimbabwe?s fielding was their biggest problem, as they dropped four catches after they had put South Africa under early pressure. 

Openers Adam Bacher (7) and A.B. de Villiers (9) were dismissed early before Tawanda Mupariwa removed Herschelle Gibbs (21) and Jacques Rudolph (33) in quick succession. 

The medium-pacer appeared unfortunate not to include Kemp amongst his victims when the allrounder seemed to edge the first ball he faced to Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu, though he was given the benefit of the doubt. 

Kemp and Ashwell Prince then put on 59 for the fifth wicket to steady the innings, before Kemp and Mark Boucher sealed the win and a 3-0 series whitewash by scoring the last 69 runs in just 8.3 overs.

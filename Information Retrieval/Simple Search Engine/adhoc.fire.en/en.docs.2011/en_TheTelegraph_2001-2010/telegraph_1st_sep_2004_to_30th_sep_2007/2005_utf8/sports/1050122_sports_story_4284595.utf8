The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I surprised myself, says Sania 

 - Brad Gilbert expects the Indian to be in top 50 within a year

Melbourne: Sania Mirza said on Friday that she surprised herself with her gallant performance against American superstar Serena Williams at the Australian Open and would not settle for any thing less than a top-10 ranking in her career. 

The 18-year old said she had proved that she had the potential to become a world-beater. ?I?m really happy because although people have spoken about potential and I have always believed in myself, you never know for sure until you play the best,? Sania said here. 

?Regardless of ranking I believe Serena is the world?s best player and I am happy that I could compete. I showed that I can really play at a top 10 level if I keep improving. 

?I felt that if it was one of the other seeds today and I played the way I did in the second set I would have won. That gives me the encouragement to work on my second serves, my variation, my fitness and my court coverage. 

?I don?t think I should be happy with top-100 or top-50. I want to perform at the highest level consistently.? 

Sania said she was jittery at the start of the match but once she settled down, she was able to play her natural game. ?I was a nervous in the beginning and had butterflies in my stomach. She is good enough to double-bagel a lot of much more highly ranked players,? she said. 

?So in the beginning, I was feeling the pressure to just register on the scoreboard. Once that happened I was a lot more confident and was able to play my natural game,? Sania said. 

?Once the confidence came and the natural game returned, I think I surprised myself. Especially in the first half of the second set where I seemed to be in control of the games and Serena faced three break points. 

?I honestly did not expect that I would be able to match her for strength and power,? she said. 

Sania had said before the match she wanted to feel for herself how hard Serena hit her strokes. She came back more than overawed from the match at Vodafone Arena. ?I have never faced a serve like hers. The power on the first serve was incredible,? she opined. I have rarely enjoyed myself more on a tennis court and it was very satisfying to fight back.? 

?You could feel the change of mood in Serena. In the first set she was very relaxed but she got more and more animated. I could see her pump her fists and say ?come on? and her grunts got louder and her strokes harder. It was incredible feeling that intensity rise.? 

?I think I learnt about myself and I learnt from a true champion. It amazed me how every time she faced any pressure she raised the game.? 

?She was really sweet. She said that it was great playing someone from India and that at age 18, I have a lot of potential, and that I would make India proud,? Sania said. 

Sania?s performance at the Vodafone Arena drew the attention of no less a coach than Brad Gilbert, who had worked with Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick. 

?He said that he expected me to at least be in the top 50 in the next 12 months,? Sania beamed. (PTI)

 Jeev out of contention 

Florida: Jeev Milkha Singh put himself out of the contention for a berth into the final stage of the US PGA qualifying school with yet another lacklustre round of three-over 75 at the Bayonet Golf course in Seaside. 

With a total of eight-over 224, Jeev is now lying tied 53rd and way outside the top-19 and ties, who will qualify for the third and final stage, where the top 35 and ties will get a full PGA Tour card. 

Asian Tour player Jeev had a string of bogeys, four in five holes from the fifth to the ninth and it ended all his chances. New Zealander Steven Alker retained a share of the lead at the Bayonet Course with 69 to move to seven-under, where he was joined by Gabriel Hjerstadt (67). 

Tommy tolles (64) set the pace on 17-under and leads at nine-under at Lake Jovita.

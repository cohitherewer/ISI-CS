 Churchill eye full points

Margao: Almost certain to face relegation, State Bank of Travancore, placed at the bottom with 14 points, will be playing for pride when they take on Churchill Brothers in a National Football League match at the Nehru Stadium here Thursday. 

SBT would be deprived of the services of captain Shabbir Ali, who along with goalkeeper Harshal Rehman and striker Anil Kumar, is nursing an injury. 

SBT coach Mohammed Najeeb, who is optimistic that his boys would put up a good fight against the Goa team whom they beat at home comfortably, said, ?we have enough strength in the reserves to make up for the trio?s absence.? 

Churchill, who breathed freely after they beat Mahindra, are now on eighth position with 20 points from 19 matches and need to win two out of the remaining three matches to avoid relegation. 

Team manager Santiago Alphonso said: ?Tomorrow?s match is important and we need to win. My boys need to play in the same vein as they did against Mahindra. 

?The return of Osuman Hussein after two match suspension will strengthen our defence. It?s up to our midfield to support strikers Yusif Yakubu and Marcos Pereira, who have been our trump cards,? Santiago added. ?Hopefully our team will rise to the occasion,? he said. (PTI)

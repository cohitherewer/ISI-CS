First and foremost, its great for the sport that shes coming back. We just dont know whether it will be in Australia, McNamee told Australian Associated Press. 

Shell be very popular and very welcome, but I know she definitely has not finalised her plans as to when shes returning to the Tour. 

She has not made up her own mind yet when shes coming back.Were hoping its Australia but its not a fait accompli.

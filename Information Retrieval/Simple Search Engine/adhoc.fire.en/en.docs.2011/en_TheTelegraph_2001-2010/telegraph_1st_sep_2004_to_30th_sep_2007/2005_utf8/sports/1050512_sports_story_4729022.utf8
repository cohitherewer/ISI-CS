 Dippenaar powers SA

Bridgetown: Boeta Dippenaar hit a one-day best 123 to power South Africa to 284 for six in the third one-day International against the West Indies on Wednesday. 

The opener struck 12 fours in a handsome innings lasting 129 balls after the tourists had been put in to bat. The elegant Dippenaars previous highest score was 110 not out against Pakistan in Lahore in 2003-04. 

South Africa, who triumphed 2-0 in the Test series, won the first two games in Jamaica at the weekend and victory here would earn them an unassailable lead in the five-match series of one-dayers. 

West Indies, who dropped three catches, delivered another ragged performance in the field before claiming five late wickets for 39 runs. 

Dippenaar and Graeme Smith began the innings briskly, but the captain went for 28 after a brilliant catch in the gully by Dwayne Smith off left-arm pacer Ian Bradshaw. 

Jacques Kallis came in and he and Dippenaar had taken the total to 142.

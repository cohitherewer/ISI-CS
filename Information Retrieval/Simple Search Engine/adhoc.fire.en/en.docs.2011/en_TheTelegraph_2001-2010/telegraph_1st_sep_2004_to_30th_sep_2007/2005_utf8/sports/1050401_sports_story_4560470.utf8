 Chisty 

 Calcutta: Jockey Imran Chisty paid for his heroics in the saddle on Thursday, after he was caught and handed a six-week suspension for going easy on Daniel David?s Exotic Strides in the Maltese Prince Handicap. The race was won by another of Daniel?s ward, Generous Gesture. The horses went to the start as an even-money favourite but scraped home just about, courtesy Exotic Strides who placed bottled up third. 

 Daniel, however, had no reason to complain as the champion schooler went on to dominate rest of the card to push his day?s tally to four, including the chief event in the seven-event card, the Altimara Cup ? won by Steinlen with Chisty in the saddle.

Vilamoura (Portugal): India Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa scored 73 to slip to joint seventh after Fridays foursomes at the $4 million World Cup of Golf at the the Victoria Clube de Golfe, as reported in Saturdays Late City edition. 

They now have an aggregate of 133 after Thursdays 60 had taken them to an overnight joint second spot. 

Meanwhile, Argentinas record-breaking foursomes score of 11-under-par 61 left Angel Cabrera and Ricardo Gonzalez just a stroke off a three-way tie for the lead on Friday. 

The Argentines stormed up from last place in the 24-team field to fourth spot behind champions England, Sweden and Wales who all finished well at the Victoria course to tie for the lead on 16-under-par 128 with the Netherlands a further stroke back. 

However, it was Argentina who were the driving force on the day as they bettered the foursomes 62 set by Fiji in 2002. 

It was Argentinas second World Cup record in five years. Cabrera and Eduardo Romero hold the fourball record of 57 from the 2000 World Cup in Argentina. 

This years pairing put their names in the history books by running up an eagle and nine birdies, playing alternate shots, to produce the best score of the day by six strokes. 

Although it was a dramatic improvement from their opening effort of four-under in the fourballs that left them sharing last place, neither felt they had improved their play tee-to-green but they putted far better. 

Cabrera, who had his 14-year-old son Angel junior, a five-handicap golfer, caddying for him, added: I said to Ricardo, we can get close to the leaders if we play the same, but this time hole a few more putts. Thats what we did, just holed a few more putts? 

Englands Luke Donald and David Howell are on course to retain the trophy won last year by Donald and Paul Casey.

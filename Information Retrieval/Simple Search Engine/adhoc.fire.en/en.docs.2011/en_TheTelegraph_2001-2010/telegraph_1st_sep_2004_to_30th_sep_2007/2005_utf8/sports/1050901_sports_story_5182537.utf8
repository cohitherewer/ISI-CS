 Owen better than Becks, says Best

Madrid: Former Manchester United great George Best rates Michael Owen more highly than David Beckham and says the England striker will prove that Real Madrid have made a mistake in selling him to Newcastle United. 

For me Owen is better than Beckham, Best told a Spanish sports daily on Wednesday. Owen is great whereas Beckham is just good. 

Owen is direct, quick and is a natural goalscorer. Beckham has his own strong points, but what makes a player different is the threat he poses to the opposition area and that is where Owen beats Beckham. 

Of course, Beckham knows how to play and hes a good footballer, but his importance as a media star is greater than his importance as a player. His club will make a lot of money from him, though, and thats a good reason to have him. (Reuters)

 I see my own image in Flintoff: Botham

 Botham

Birmingham: Ian Botham has said Andrew Flintoffs performance in Englands nail-biting two-run second Ashes Test win here were reminiscent of his displays against Australia 24 years ago. 

The highest compliment I can pay Freddie Flin-toff is that it was like watching a throwback to the good old days of 1981, legen-dary allroun-der Botham wrote in his column in a British daily. 

Flintoff has not always appreciated direct comparisons between himself and me, but his performance was magnificent... When I watch Flintoff bat, I see a player in my own image. 

The 27-year-old Lancashire star, like Botham a hard-hitting batsman and aggressive pace bowler, played a vital role in the closest victory in 128 years. 

Man-of-the-Match Flintoff returned figures of seven for 131 and made dynamic scores of 68 and 73 as England, just as they had done in 1981. 

Since Bothams heyday in the 1980s many England players have found themselves burdened with the tag of new Botham. It is no surprise that Flintoff has fought shy of the label, insisting again at Edgbaston after Sundays thrilling win: Im just me.

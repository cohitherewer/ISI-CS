The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Laxman injury 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: V.V.S. Laxman, who had to retire hurt after being hit by a Mohammed Sami delivery in the morning session, was back on the field in the afternoon and was reported to be fit. 

The impact of the short delivery hitting the visor of the helmet resulted in a swollen left eyebrow. He was forced to retire due to problems of vision resulting out of the knock. 

?There was a swelling in his eye but no cut. We had kept him under observation,? a spokesman said. 

Laxman was attended to by physio John Gloster. He recovered, came back later and scored 22 more runs.

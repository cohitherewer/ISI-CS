 Puerta banned for eight years

London: The tennis career of Argentinas Mariano Puerta lay in tatters on Wednesday after he was banned for a record eight years after a positive drugs test. 

The International Tennis Federation said its independent Anti-Doping Tribunal had ruled that 27-year-old Puerta tested positive for the banned stimulant etilefrine after his French Open final defeat by Spains Rafael Nadal in June. 

In accordance with the WADA World Anti-Doping Code the tribunal therefore imposed an eight-year suspension from competition, commencing June 5, 2005, the ITF said in a statement on its official website. 

No tennis player had previously been banned for more than two years. 

It was Puertas second doping offence and the unprecedented length of the ban effectively ends his career, although it fell short of the lifetime ban which could have been imposed under the rules. 

Puerta served a nine-month ban after testing positive for the banned anabolic agent clenbuterol in 2003. 

The Tribunal determined that Mr Puertas analytical positive result was caused by an inadvertent administration of etilefrine, the ITF added. 

It said Puertas results at Roland Garros would be disqualified and he would forfeit the ranking points and 440,000 euros ($523,000) prize money he won in the singles and the 3,282 euros he won in the doubles. 

In addition, all results achieved by Puerta since the French Open will be disqualified and he will lose the entry ranking points and prize money of $330,925 gained in those events. 

Puerta, who was ranked 13 in the ATPs entry system before Wednesdays ruling, has three weeks to decide whether to lodge an appeal against the decision with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne. 

A French newspaper reported in October that Puerta had returned a positive test after traces of etilefrine were found in his urine after the Roland Garros final against Nadal, which Puerta lost 6-7, 6-3, 6-1, 7-5. At that time Puerta had said there was no truth in the report. 

The French Tennis Federation (FFT) on Wednesday welcomed the eight-year ban on Puerta but said the case should have been dealt with more quickly, adds another report from Paris. 

A statement said: The FFT welcomes (the fact) that the rules in the anti-doping programme of the ITF have been implemented by the tribunal which was dealing with a case of second offence.

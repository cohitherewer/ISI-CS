 ?Choice? may strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Straight contests between fancied runners may be the order of the day in most of the six events on Tuesday. However, a three-way battle cannot be ruled out among Karan?s Choice, Royal Bounty and Ever Lasting Love in the main event, the 1,200m Shiseido Cup.

Karan?s Choice, a Harvinder Singh Bath-trained filly, 

however, gets the first call. The Sizzling Melody-Rush O Gold daughter was impressive 

in her last outing when she placed a decent fourth behind Arapahoe ? a good sprinter. 

More importantly, Royal Bounty, though a better rated horse, may have blunted 

his speed after his unproductive exploits in mile races. Ever Lasting Love, on 

the other hand, may have to overcome her age and handicap disadvantage against 

Karan?s Choice who will be partnered by C. Alford.

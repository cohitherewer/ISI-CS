 Owen on mission to make amends for Belfast

 - Players are fully behind Eriksson, says England forward

 Owen is convinced England will qualify for Germany 

Michael Owen has articulated the desire of the England players to make amends for last months shambles in Belfast with victory over Austria on Saturday. The Newcastle United striker added he was confident that he would recover from a dead leg in time to show England supporters his true worth in such an important World Cup qualifier. 

I have been impatient for these matches to come along since the defeat by Northern Ireland, Owen said. This is our chance to put things right, and Im confident we will. There was a lot of criticism after that game and we have to take it on the chin. 

We know the performance was not acceptable. We are all much better players than that. There was a lot of frustration at the way we performed in Belfast. We let ourselves and the fans down. We are determined to channel that frustration into much better performances. 

Owen was also eager to address suggestions that not all the players were as supportive of the head coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, as they had been. Eriksson has always prided himself on enjoying the complete backing of the squad, but a few have privately begun to question some of the Swedes methods. 

Englands vice-captain insisted all the players remained loyal to Eriksson. There has been a lot written about supposed disharmony in the dressing room, Owen said. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a tight squad, with a firm belief both in ourselves and in Sven-Goran Eriksson and the coaching staff. 

The players are fully behind the manager. His record in competitive games is outstanding, and people seem to have forgotten that the defeat against Northern Ireland was his first in a qualifier in over four years. Perhaps we have got used to a certain level of success under Sven. I have not changed my belief that he is the right man to lead us to Germany and achieve success there. 

David Beckham also rallied to the cause of the much-criticised Eriksson, arguing that the more brickbats slung the coachs way the stronger the bond with players themselves used to being arraigned in the court of public opinion. 

I dont think Sven will ever lose appetite for football because he is one of the best managers in the world, the England captain said. Hes as dedicated as ever. 

He came out and said: No, Im not walking away from this. Im going to stick by the team and stick by the players. That is what the players need. The way he controls the team is important for the players. We are a better team than the other teams in the group and weve got better players so we should be all right. 

Owen agreed. We still have automatic qualification in our own hands, and two victories will see us in Germany next year as group winners. I am convinced we will get those wins. The World Cup is the pinnacle of any players career. We are all determined to get to Germany and test ourselves on the biggest stage of all. Its important all the fans know that we crave success as much as them. 

Owen will probably be partnered by Peter Crouch, unless Darren Bent catches Erikssons eye in training, and Beckham was looking forward to having a target-man to ping balls at. It gives you an extra option when you have someone to aim for with the crosses, said Beckham, who insisted that he was unperturbed by the appointment of Kim Milton Nielsen, who sent him off in St-Etienne against Argentina at World Cup 98, as referee for the Poland tie. 

Rooney was dismissed by the Danish official for Manchester United last month. With Beckham on the right, Joe Cole argued for a chance on the other flank. I feel I can do a great job on Saturday and Wednesday, said Cole. It was very important for me to play with England coming up and Im looking to start.

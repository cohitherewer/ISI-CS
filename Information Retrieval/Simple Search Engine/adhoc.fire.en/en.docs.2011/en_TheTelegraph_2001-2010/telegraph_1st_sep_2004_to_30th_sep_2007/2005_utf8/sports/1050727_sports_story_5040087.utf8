 Sania a lucky loser

 Sania made the main draw despite losing to Peer 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza earned a main draw entry as a lucky loser after a heartbreaking defeat in a thrilling final qualifying round at the $ 585,000 WTA Tour event in Standord. 

Sania put up a brave fight before going down 2-6, 6-7 (10-12) to Israeli Shahar Peer Monday, but she entered the competition proper after Chanda Rubin pulled out with an ankle inflammation. 

Sania will now play wild card Eleni Daniilidou, currently ranked 58th in the world. A win over the Grecian would pit the 18-year old Indian against second seed Venus Williams who has a bye in the first round. 

Interestingly, a win over Peer could have set up a repeat clash with German Anna-Lena Groenefeld whom Sania defeated in the first round in Cincinnati. Groenefeld now will tackle peer in the top half of the draw. 

However, there was no such luck for the Uberoi sisters, Shikha and Neha, as both went down in the final round of the qualifiers. 

Shikha went down to Marissa Irvin of the US 2-6, 4-6 while Neha, who represents her adopted country, the US, lost to Alina Jidkova of Russia 4-6, 4-6. 

The trio had scored tough wins in the earlier rounds, with both Sania and Shikha knocking out a top-100 player each. 

Sania accounted for Maureen Drake and Lindsay Lee-Waters, ranked 96th, while Shikha overcame local challengers Shenay Perry and Jill Craybas (58). 

Neha on the other hand tamed Teryn Ashley and Melen Tu, both her compatriots. 

[Meanwhile, Harsh Mankad strengthened his case for an entry into the US Open qualifiers after edging out 470th ranked Toshihide Matsui in the $ 50,000 ATP Tour Granby challenger first round.] 

Venus, after successfully adopting a new relaxation technique to end her four-year Grand Slam drought at Wimbledon, is determined to continue her resurgence during the US hardcourt season, adds a report from Stanford. 

Williams outlasted fellow American Lindsay Davenport in the longest womens singles final in Wimbledon history to capture her third All-England Club crown earlier this month. 

The world number 10 is now aiming for a third title at the Stanford Classic and she begins her campaign against either Daniilidou or Sania later this week. 

I needed to slow things down in my mind, the five-time Grand Slam champion said Monday. You have to be able to relax. I was putting way too much pressure on myself all the time before Wimbledon. Now I know not to think too far ahead. 

I felt like I was so close so many times to winning another Grand Slam and just needed to keep giving myself more opportunities. This time, I came good on it. Im now looking forward to following up on my success. (Agencies)

 PCB to back Inzy if he skips trip Down Under 

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Monday that it would back skipper Inzamam-ul Haq if the star batsman decides not to travel to Australia for next months captains conference and Super Series. 

The PCB will back Inzamams decision if he decides not to travel to Australia. But if he decides to accept the invitation, he will have to break his journey to-and-from Australia to avoid back trouble that was identified when he missed the last two tests late last year, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

For PCB, a fit Inzamam for the England series is more important than playing in the super series, Shaharyar said. The decision on Inzamams inclusion will be taken on September 21 after Sachin Tendulkar conveys to the ICC about his fitness. 

Indications are that Inzamam might skip the Australian tour after being originally left out of the World XIs. Inzamam has also been nominated for three awards that will be awarded in Sydney on October 11. (PTI)

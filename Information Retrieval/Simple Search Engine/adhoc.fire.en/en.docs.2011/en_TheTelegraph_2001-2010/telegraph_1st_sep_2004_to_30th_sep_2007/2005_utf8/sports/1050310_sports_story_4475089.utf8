 Indian colts hold SA

Lahore: India twice came back from the jaws of defeat to hold South Africa to a 4-4 draw in the four-nation junior hockey tournament here on Wednesday. 

India drew first blood in the fourth minute when Birendar Lakra scored off a Hari Prasad pass. Austin Smith scored the equaliser in the 17th minute from an indirect penalty corner drill and Matthew McConkey gave South Africa a 2-1 lead seven minutes later when he found the net from a penalty corner rebound. 

After the change of ends, South Africa extended their lead to 3-1 in the 43rd minute when Pierre Geldenbuy?s angular and accurate carpet shot sounded the board. 

Five minutes later, India scored twice in as many minutes to level the game 3-3. Sardar Singh scored off a feeble push from the first penalty corner in the 47th minute and in the next minute Lakra scored his second goal. 

In the 58th minute, South Africa regained their lead to be 4-3 through McConkey but India drew level again through Hari Prasad in 61st minute.

 Harbhajan thanks Board, teammates 

 - ?I bowled the doosra because I haven?t been advised to stop doing so? 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: Harbhajan Singh, who emerged most successful in his very first outing after his doosra got questioned yet again, has thanked the ?Board and teammates? for overwhelming support. 

India?s No.1 off-spinner ended with six for 152 in the first innings of the final Test here. 

?Having been reported to the ICC wasn?t there at the back of my mind as the Board is taking care of that. Moreover, teammates have been so supportive... It has been overwhelming,? Harbhajan pointed out. 

?I did bowl the doosra because I haven?t been advised to stop doing so... Maine khul ke bowling ki,? he added. 

Harbhajan insisted his confidence hadn?t ever taken a beating and also ?thanked? former captain (and Team India consultant) Sunil Gavaskar for ?tips? during Day II. 

As reported by The Telegraph, Harbhajan was almost out of the XI. At the 11th-hour, though, the thinktank decided not to bring back Zaheer Khan and retain the 2-2 attack. 

Well, destiny...

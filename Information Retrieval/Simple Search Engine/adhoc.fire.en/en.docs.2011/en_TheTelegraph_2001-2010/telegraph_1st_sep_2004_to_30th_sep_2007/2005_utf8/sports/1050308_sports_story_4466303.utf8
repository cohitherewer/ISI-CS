 Anand in sole second spot 

 Anand beat Kasimdzhanov in Round XI

Linares: Viswanathan Anand closed in on leader Garri Kasparov of Russia with a brilliantly-crafted victory over Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the 11th round of the Linares Super Grandmasters meet now in progress here. 

As reported in Monday?s Late City edition, Anand took his tally to 5.5 points out of his 9 games so far but still remained a full point adrift of Kasparov who has an enviable score of 6.5 out of 9. 

However the Indian ace moved to sole second spot following his victory as Bulgarian Veselin Topalov was pushed back to the third spot after he could do little against Corus champion Peter Leko of Hungary and had to concede a draw. 

The other game of the day between Francisco Vallejo Pons and English Michael Adams also ended in a draw. 

With just three rounds to go, Kasparov still remains the hot favourite for his ninth Linares title but Anand remains in pursuit as he is slated to play two of his last three games with white pieces. 

Topalov on 5 out of nine games stands third, while Leko is next in line with a 50 per cent score, having drawn all his games. 

Adams occupies the fifth spot with 4 points out of nine games in his kitty, while Kasimdzhanov has 3.5 points from as many encounters in the tournament that carries a euro 100,000 prize for the winner. (PTI)

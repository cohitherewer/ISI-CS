 Shanghai: Dubai plans to build a $360 million Formula One theme park with work getting underway next year, Bernie Ecclestone said on Sunday. The park, at Motorcity, the Emirate?s existing race track, will cover five million square feet and include a hotel and conference centres. Despite having a track, Dubai is not on the Grand Prix calendar. The only race in the Middle East takes place in Bahrain.

 The park is due to be finished in 2008, which could open the door for Ecclestone to approve the staging of a race in the UAE. 

 Phillip Island: Valentino Rossi won his 11th MotoGP of the season and Daniel Pedrosa took his second successive 250cc world title after his nearest rival crashed out at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday.

 Rossi equalled his personal best for victories in a season, just one from the record of 12 set by Mick Doohan in 1997. It was the Italian?s fifth successive win at the Phillip Island track.

 Kutre Dulecha completed an Ethiopian double by winning the women?s race in 2:30:06.

 Paris: French club rugby set a national crowd record for a regular-season match in any sport as Stade Francais inflicted the first defeat of the season on European champions Stade Toulousain at the Stade de France on Saturday.

 Bangkok: Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic ground out a 6-1, 6-7 (5-7), 7-5 win over Russian top seed Nadia Petrova to win the Thailand Open on Sunday.

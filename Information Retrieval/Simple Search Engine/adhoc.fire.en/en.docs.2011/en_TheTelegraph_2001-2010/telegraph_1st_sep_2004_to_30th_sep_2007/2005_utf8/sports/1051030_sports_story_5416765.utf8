 London: Former Manchester United soccer great George Best is making slow but steady improvement from the infection which has kept him in intensive care for almost a month, his doctor said on Saturday.

 Best, who was described by his agent as being close to death earlier this week, is still on a ventilator and has some internal bleeding although his condition has improved.

 ?He still is seriously ill but there?s no doubt there has been some improvement in the last 48 hours,? Professor Roger Williams said outside the private Cromwell hospital in west London where Best is being treated. 

 Lagos: Nigeria will play a friendly match against South Korea on November 17 as part of their preparations for next January?s African Nations Cup tournament.

 Nigeria Football Association spokesman Robinson Okosun said on Friday: ?The venue will be announced after finalising other arrangements concerned with the game.? The Nigerians will also take on Nations Cup hosts Egypt in France in a warm-up in January before their opening group game against Ghana. Africa?s soccer showpiece is scheduled to run from January 20 to February 10.

 Nigeria, who won the Nations Cup in 1980 and 1994, have failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup finals. 

 Madrid: Double world champion Sebastien Loeb and his Citroen team mate Francois Duval held the top two positions after stage eight of the Rally of Catalunya on Saturday.

 Loeb has a 52.4 second advantage over Duval, while third-placed Marcus Gronholm, in a Peugeot, is another 24.6 seconds behind the Belgian. 

 St Petersburg: Australian Open champion Marat Safin has not fully recovered from a knee injury and will miss next month?s Masters Cup in Shanghai. Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpishchev, also the country?s Davis Cup captain, said on Saturday that Safin would rest for the remainder of the year in order to be fit for next season.

 Tarpishchev said, ?He must first get 100 percent healthy before stepping on the court again. The most important thing is to prepare well for the Australian Open, where he must defend his title.? The world No. 5 has been troubled by a ligament tear in his left knee since Wimbledon.

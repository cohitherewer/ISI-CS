 Tirkey doubtful 

New Delhi: Indias prospects at the upcoming Champions Trophy hockey tournament received a setback on Thursday with doubts over the participation of captain Dilip Tirkey. 

The ace defender is suffering from high fever and typhoid like symptoms for the past few days, sources in the IHF said. 

It is also learnt that the IHF has asked William Xalxo to leave for Chennai on Friday and join the Indian camp as a back up for Tirkey. 

However, the sources said the IHF was not pressing the panic button as yet to announce a replacement for Tirkey as more than a weeks time was there for the tournament to begin. 

We dont want to press the panic button now as the tournament is scheduled to begin on December 10, the sources said. (PTI)

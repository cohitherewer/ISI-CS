Calcutta: An early Belal Ahmed goal saw Mohammedan Sporting scrape past Eastern Railway in their Premier Division tie on Wednesday. The glamour side could, however, consider themselves lucky considering the way Eastern Railway came close to equalising on a couple of occasions. 

The enterprising show put up by the men in black-and-white in the first session faded in the face of some attacking display by their rivals. The Mohammedan Sporting wingbacks were the worst on display and it was left to stoppers Madhusudan Majumder and Rodingson to wither the challenge. 

Rodingson, the youngster from Shillong and in his maiden season in the Maidan, looked impressive. He showed good anticipation and was athletic in approach. 

Mohammedan Sporting started on a positive note. The forwardline and midfielders combined well as the rival defence was stretched to the hilt. The forwards were creating open spaces, there was the overlapping of wingbacks leading to more men in attack but poor finishing came in the way of their not increasing the margin. 

Jiten Rai, despite all his flourish, held onto the ball for long and spoiled a couple of moves. He missed a golden opportunity in the 26th minute when he delayed in shooting, only to be dispossessed in time. 

In the final minute of stoppage time Jitens shot, however, hit the crosspiece. 

Mohammedan Sporting forged ahead in the third minute. Goalkeeper Surabuddin Chowdhury failed to intercept Mohammed Nadims cross from the middle and the ball ran loose to Belal on the right corner of the box. Finding an open net in front, he made no mistake. 

Mohammedan Sporting survived a scare in the 48th minute when Farid Ali Mollahs shot grazed past the far post by a whisker with the defenders caught unawares. That was supposed to be a warning but Mohammedan Sporting defenders paid no heed to it. 

Binoy Sahas shot was narrowly saved by Gopal Das and then Farid Ali again missed the target by a whisker with an open goal in front. 

Mohammedan Sporting defence was in tatters by then and it required all their ten players to fall back and stop the flow of attacks. Poor shooting came in the way of railwaymens inability to draw level. 

Mohammedan Sporting face East Bengal on Sunday and unless Biswajit Bhattacharjee works overtime to plug the loopholes, especially in the defence, Subhas Bhowmick can breathe easy. The broad smile on the face of Bhowmicks assistant Bikash Panji ? who watched the match on Wednesday to assess their opponents ? was not to be missed.

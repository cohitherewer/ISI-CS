The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Judges not surprised 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A little after the division bench stayed the appointment of two additional observers, Justice (retd) K.N. Singh and Justice (retd) M.M. Punchi were escorted out of the AGM by Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

They did not wait for the court order to arrive and left when they were intimated about the development over telephone. 

Justice Punchi said: There is no surprise element involved? We have been asked by the court to leave the meeting. We are here to execute the court orders and nothing else. Im leaving and it is for the court to decide the future of the AGM. 

Justice Singh was also forthright. The division bench has dismissed the order under which the two observers were appointed. In this context, out stay here is meaningless. 

Were bound to respect the order and going to leave by the next available flight, he said.

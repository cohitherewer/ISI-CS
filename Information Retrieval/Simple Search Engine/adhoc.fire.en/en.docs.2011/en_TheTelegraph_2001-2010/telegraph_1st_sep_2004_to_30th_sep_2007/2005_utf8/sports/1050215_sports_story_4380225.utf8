 Frankfurt: Betting in football will be at the top of the agenda at next month?s meeting of Fifa?s executive committee as the sport?s governing body looks for ways to prevent further match-fixing scandals. Fifa president Sepp Blatter, in Frankfurt to open a referees? workshop, said the sport had to take heed of the corruption case that has engulfed German football.

 ?The German case is a warning shot,? Blatter told German magazine Der Spiegel in an interview on Sunday. ?The topic of bets will be the most important thing under discussion at the executive committee meeting on March 7 and 8. We need information on unusual activity in betting.?

 Madrid: World Player of the Year Ronaldinho and European Footballer of the Year Andriy Shevchenko will lead two teams at the Nou Camp on Tuesday in a benefit match to raise funds for the tsunami affected.

 The Football for Hope match will feature more than 50 of the worlds best known players including Real Madrids Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham.

 Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira and Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard will manage Brazilian Ronaldinhos World side while Italy coach Marcello Lippi and Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will manage the European team.

 Istanbul: French striker Nicolas Anelka scored his first goal for his new club Fenerbahce at the weekend as his team stayed top of the Turkish League and chalked up their tenth successive home win since the start of the season.

 Anelka, playing his second match for the Istanbul club, scored his first goal for them with a 63rd minute tap-in off a cross from Umit Ozat after heading against the bar a few minutes earlier.

 He also set up a goal for Marcio Nobre and was widely praised in the press for his performance.

 Bucharest: Romania striker Daniel Niculae will miss next month?s World Cup qualifiers against Netherlands and Macedonia because of an ankle injury, local media said on Monday.

 The Rapid Bucharest player suffered the injury while playing against second division Unirea Urziceni in a training match at the weekend. Club doctors said Niculae needed between six and eight weeks to recover.

 Niculae, who scored 13 goals in 15 league matches, was seen as the solution for a Romania attack weakened by injuries to Ionel Ganea and Marius Niculae and Adrian Mutu?s doping ban.

 Melbourne: Minardi team owner Paul Stoddart said on Monday he would take motorsport?s governing body to court if it prevents his team from racing at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne next month. FIA, quoted on several Motorsport web sites, said it could prevent Minardi from racing at Melbourne?s Albert Park on March 6 because the team plans to use an updated version of their 2004 model car for the first three races of the season.

 However, Stoddart said any attempt to prevent them racing would be protested, possibly in court in Australia?s Victoria state, thereby allowing the team to take part before the case was heard.

 Hissar: The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) on Monday announced a 14-member team which will participate in the international Takhti Cup wrestling championship to be held in Iran from March 2 to 4. According to WFI, the selection was made on the basis of the performance during the senior national meet held in Nidani in Haryana recently.

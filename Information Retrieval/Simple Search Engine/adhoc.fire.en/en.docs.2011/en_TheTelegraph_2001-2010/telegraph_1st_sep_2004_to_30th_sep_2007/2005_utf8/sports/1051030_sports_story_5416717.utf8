The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav still has a lot to contribute: Kirmani

 - I dont see him coming back into one-day squad: Bedi 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Bishan Singh Bedi

New Delhi: Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi and ex-chief selector Syed Kirmani view Sourav Gangulys plight differently. While Bedi (a known Sourav-baiter) feels he should quit one-day cricket, Kirmani is of the opinion that he has to be patient. 

Both spoke to The Telegraph on the short-haul Jet Airways flight from Chandigarh on Saturday afternoon. This is what they said: 

BEDI: Sourav must read the writing on the wall... I dont see him coming back into the one-day squad and, so, he should say good-bye... In fact, Im not sure whether he will be able to return to the Test squad as well... I accept Sourav led India well and the country must thank him for that... Yet, thats history... Sourav, I feel, shouldnt have opened his mouth in Bulawayo (on his face-off with coach Greg Chappell)... That compounded his problems... Im not in favour of a coach from overseas, but given that we continue to have one, its only fair that Chappell gets time to implement what he thinks is best. Rahul (Dravid), too, needs to be given time. Today, he has the potential to be our finest captain. 

 Syed Kirmani

KIRMANI: Sourav still has a lot to contribute... In fact, seniors like him are needed... Theyre the ones to guide the less experienced. However, at this point, theres no place for him and Sourav has to wait for somebody to fail... Had I still been chief selector, even I wouldnt have brought him back yesterday. At the same time, I would let it be known that Sourav continues to be in the frame... He has been an achiever and shortcomings ? or a loss of form ? can be overcome. My advice would be that Sourav continue getting runs in domestic cricket. Once thats done, he has to be patient. Also, he ought to keep his mind free. 

Footnote: Both India and Sri Lanka are to reach Jaipur, venue of the third ODI (Monday), early on Sunday. They broke journey in the capital ? the murderous blasts occurred after their arrival ? to attend series sponsor Videocons dinner.

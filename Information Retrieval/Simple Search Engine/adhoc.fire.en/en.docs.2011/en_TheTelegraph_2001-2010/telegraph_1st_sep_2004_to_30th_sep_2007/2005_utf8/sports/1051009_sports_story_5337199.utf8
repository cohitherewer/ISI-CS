 Madrid: Spain have named former player Emilio Sanchez as the new captain of their Davis Cup team following the sackings of previous skippers Jordi Arrese and Juan Avendano.

 Sanchez Vicario is the eldest brother of former world No. 1 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and has made a living as a coach and television commentator since his retirement from the ATP circuit.

 ?Emilio is a great professional, a hard worker and a proven success,? Spanish Tennis Federation president Pedro Munoz told a news conference on Saturday. 

 Brussels: British teenager Andy Murray was forced to pull out of a Challenger event in Mons after suffering a hamstring injury on Friday.

 The 18-year-old conceded defeat to local favourite Xavier Malisse. ?I felt my left hamstring pull and after that I couldnt really move to my backhand well,? Murray said.

 Murray, who travelled straight to Belgium from Thailand for the second-tier challenger event, conceded the third-round match to second-seeded Malisse after losing the opening set 7-5.

 Washington: World Cup ski champion Bode Miller has questioned why some performance-enhancing drugs are illegal, saying they might improve the safety of tired skiers.

 Miller, the first American to win the overall title since 1983, believes an endurance-boosting drug such as erythropoietin (EPO) could keep oxygen flowing to the brain of a skier battling fatigue on courses where speeds of 150 kph can be reached.

 ?I?m surprised it?s illegal,? said Miller, 27, an Olympic medal favourite, in an interview this week. ?Because in our sport, it would be pretty minimal health risks, and it would actually make it safer for the athletes, because you?d have less chance of making a mistake at the bottom and killing yourself,? he said.

 Madrid: Real Madrid have launched an unprecedented attack on the impartiality of the referee of next week?s league game against city rivals Atletico Madrid.

 Real, whose president Florentino Perez recently said that the club would do all they could to help referees do their job more effectively, said that Bernardino Gonzalez Vazquez had a record of prejudicing their interests in past encounters.

 They also claim that Gonzalez Vazquez has been appointed after pressure from their opponents Atletico and that he is a self-confessed supporter of arch-rivals Barcelona.

 Rome: Injury-prone striker Filippo Inzaghi moved a step closer to returning to top-flight football when he was selected to play for AC Milan?s youth team this weekend, the Serie A side said on Friday.

 Inzaghi, who has scored 113 goals in Serie A and 15 for the Italian national team, has been plagued by injuries during the past two years. An operation on his left ankle forced him to miss Euro 2004 in Portugal.

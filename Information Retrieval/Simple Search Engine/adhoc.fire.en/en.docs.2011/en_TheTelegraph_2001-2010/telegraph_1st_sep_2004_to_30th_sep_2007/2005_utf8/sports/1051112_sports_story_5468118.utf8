 Rao may pip Sourashish

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: East Zone are likely to play S.S. Rao in place of Sourashish Lahiri in the Duleep Trophy final against West at Motera. The five-day match begins Saturday. 

Shahbaz Nadeem will also retain his place. 

Allrounder Sanjib Sanyal experienced chest pain during practice on Friday. However, doctors ruled out any cause for worry after X-rays were done. 

West captain Sairaj Bahutule appeared confident, saying Wasim Jaffer would be their mainstay in batt- ing. 

West Zone could also play a third seamer in place of Rakesh Patel and a final decision would be taken only in the morning. 

After two back-to-back victories, an inspired West Zone will rely on experienced players to come up with a good show against East, led by former India captain Sourav Ganguly. 

East have a young and talented side wherein the likes of Arindam Das, Shiv Sundar Das, Deep Dasgupta have the ability to put up inspired performances. 

East is being led by Sourav, who is an inspiring leader and can motivate youngsters to perform above their potential, West Zone coach Balwinder Singh Sandhu said. 

We have to dig deep into the experience of players. The pace department will be led by the in-form and experienced Zaheer Khan, Sandhu said. 

Zaheer looks to be in good form, he said. 

The pitch is the same that was used in the recently held one-dayer between India and Sri Lanka. It is likely to favour batsmen while offering some assistance to the seamers as well.

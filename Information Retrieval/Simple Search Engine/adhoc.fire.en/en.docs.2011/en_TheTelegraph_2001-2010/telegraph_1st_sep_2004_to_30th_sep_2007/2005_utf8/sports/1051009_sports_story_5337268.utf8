New Delhi: India eves succumbed to pressure in the tie breaker as defending champions Australia ran away with the title for a second time on the trot by defeating the hosts 5-3 in the Indira Gandhi Gold Cup womens hockey on Saturday. 

With both teams tied at 2-2 at the hooter and failing to break the deadlock through a golden goal in the extra time, the match had to be decided in a tie-breaker where Australia slammed three penalty strokes against Indias one. 

For Australia, captain Nikki Hudson, who also scored in the regulation time, Arrold Nicole and Sanders Rebecca netted goals in the penalty shoot out. 

Subhadra Pradhan was the lone scorer for India in the tie-breaker. 

Australian goalie Imison Rachel denied Jasjeet Kaur and Pradhan the oppurtunity to score making brilliant saves while Mamta Kharabs crucial shot, when Indias fate was hanging in balance at 2-1, went wide. Rebecca made no mistake in Australias fifth attempt in the tie-breaker and ensured the victory. 

Earlier, Indian eves started with promise as Mamta scored in the eight minute while Jasjeet Kaur Handa slammed another in the 18th minute to consolidate the lead to a comfortable 2-0 till the breather. 

But the Australian fought their way back into the game from 0-2 down by converting two penalty corners through Taylor Sarah and Nikki Hudson to keep their hopes alive for the title. 

India called the shots in the first half and drew first blood when Mamta Kharab pushed Subhadra Pradhans free hit into the cage. Indias forward line played in tandem displaying fast, skilful hockey and kept the Aussies on the backfoot for most of the first half while Jasjeet converted a penalty corner to give the hosta their second goal. 

The second half saw the Aussies stepping up their attacks and making relentless efforts to narrow down the margin. But they succeeded only 15 minutes before the whistle when Nikki Hudson converted a well-executed set-piece in the 55th minute. Taylor Sarah carried out another conversion in the next minute to level the scores. 

Earlier in the day, Italy upset New Zealand 2-1 for a third place finish in the tournament, which was being held after a gap of nine years. 

Italys Faustini Francesca scored a brace in the first half. New Zealand, had to be contended with Kayla Sharlans goal in the 41st minute.

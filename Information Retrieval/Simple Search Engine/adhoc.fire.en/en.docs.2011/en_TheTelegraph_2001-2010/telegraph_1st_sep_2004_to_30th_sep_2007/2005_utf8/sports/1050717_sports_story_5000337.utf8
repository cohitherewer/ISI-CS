From the road alongside the 18th green of the Old Course, from the grandstands, from windows and balconies and rooftops, applause cascaded upon Jack Nicklaus, a 65-year-old golf legend playing his last round in a major championship. 

It ended, appropriately, with a long birdie putt, a wave to the fans and, after he wiped away tears, a short walk up the steps of the weathered, gray, stone clubhouse of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, cheers still reverberating off its darkly tinted windows. 

At exactly 6 pm at St Andres on Friday, the Nicklaus era ended in professional golf. He shot even-par 72 but missed the cut in his 38th British Open, a tournament he played for the first time in 1962. Nicklaus had said the Open Championship would be his last tournament, but he has hinted he might play again at his own tournament, the Memorial, held at his home course in Dublin, Ohio. 

The throng of spectators for Nicklaus farewell spilled over the back of the green, where his family looked on. If it was a going-away party, it was a Nicklaus family affair. One of his sons, Steve, caddied for him, and savoured the moment. I know he hates to say goodbye, but youve got to say goodbye sometime, Steve said. 

Nicklaus wife, Barbara, two more of his sons, Gary and Jackie, and his daughter, Nan, greeted him as he left the 18th green. I sort of let my emotions go, he said. The people were fantastic. Actually, as I was coming down the last few holes, Im saying, Man, I dont want to go through this again. Maybe its just as well I miss the cut. 

It was a warm and respectful reception for Nicklaus, much like what Arnold Palmer received when he made his final appearance at the British Open, at the Old Course in 1995. 

Jacks given a lot to the game of golf, said Phil Mickelson. I think it was the team effort of the rivalry with Jack and Arnold that propelled golf. I dont think one could have done it without the other. 

Nicklaus place in the pantheon of golfs greatest players is secure because of his record in the sports biggest tournaments. His 18 major professional titles are seven more than Walter Hagens second-place total. Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Tiger Woods are next, with nine. 

Woods said he was honoured to be included in any comparison with Nicklaus. Hes the greatest champion thats ever lived, Woods said. Hes been the benchmark for every player thats ever played the game, at least in my generation. Before him, it was probably Bobby Jones. 

Woods this week is attempting to join Nicklaus as the only players to have won all four majors at least twice. Nicklaus won each of the four at least three times, including a record six Masters. 

The record will show that Nicklaus could have had even more ? he was second in 19 majors. At the British Open alone, Nicklaus was second seven times. In an 18-year span from 1963 through 1980, he had 17 top-six finishes in the British Open. 

His PGA Tour victories number 73 ? his first the 1962 US Open; his last the 1986 Masters. Sam Snead is at the top of the victory list with 82. Nicklaus shares with Palmer the record for consecutive years ? 17 ? winning at least one tournament. 

He finished in the top 10 in 243 of 357 PGA Tour events from 1962 to 1979, and from 1971 to 73 he had 41 top 10s in 55 events, including 19 victories and seven seconds.

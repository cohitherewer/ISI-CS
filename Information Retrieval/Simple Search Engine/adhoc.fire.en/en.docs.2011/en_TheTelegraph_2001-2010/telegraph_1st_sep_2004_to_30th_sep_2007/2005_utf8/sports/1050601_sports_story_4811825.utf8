 Fallon yet to decide on horse 

 Fallon

 Epsom: It has become a tough call for Kieren Fallon to choose between Gypsy King and Oratorio for Saturdays prized event, the Vodafone Derby at Epsom Downs. Fallon, it is learnt, has left it to trainer Aidan Brien to make a final decision. The jockey has already won the 1,000 and the 2,000 Guineas for the trainer this season.

 The Irish jockey is also looking for his third successive Derby victory having won the Classic with Kris Kin in 2003 and North Light, last year. The jockey has a particular motivation for getting it right - victory would make him the first jockey since Steve Donoghue in 1923 to win the Derby three years in succession. Michael Stoute, responsible for his winning mounts in 2003 and 2004, has been left without a runner, dashing his hopes of becoming the first trainer to secure the race three years in a row. 

 Fallon and Aidan are expected to make up their minds by Wednesday, though the jockey feels it is a toss up and a very difficult decision between the Dee Stakes winner Gypsy King and Irish 2000 Guineas runner-up Oratorio.

 I will probably let someone else make that decision for me because that way, if it doesnt work out, I can blame someone else, Fallon is learnt to have said. 

 Oratorio has the form, but my heart says Gypsy King. He was always going to be my Derby ride but then Oratorio went and ran so well at the Curragh in the Irish Guineas.

 Oratorio is the most experienced of the Aidan quartet. In the mile-and-a-half event, he stayed on nicely behind Dubawi in the Irish 2000 Guineas.

 He is the horse with the Group One form and he has learned a lot and has taken the race well. He didnt have a hard race at the Curragh, I didnt punish him, yet he ran a great race and he will stay, better than Dubawi.

 Both Gypsy King and Oratorio will have one more piece of work each in the next couple of days but I have always loved Gypsy King since Chester. I gave him a terrible ride at Chester, but he still won and hes learned a lot. To me he is a serious Derby horse.

 At the five-day stage a total of 15 horses stand their ground, meaning connections of favourite Motivator may get their desired small field.

 Motivator, the Michael Bell-trained colt is the 9-4 favourite with William Hill after recording an impressive success in the Dante Stakes at York. It was just a third career start for Motivator. The favourite has also been impressing in his workouts. Bell is hoping everything will go to plan this week.

 Bell was only worried about Johnny Murtagh whose three-day ban at a Jockey Club appeal on Wednesday needs to be reduced if he is to ride Motivator. Murtagh had put so much effort into helping prepare the horse for the Derby that it would be pretty desperate to miss the Classic because of a minor riding infringement in an all-weather race, said Bell. Darryll Holland is on standby if the three-day ban for careless riding is upheld.

 Godolphin stables Dubawi will be trying to succeed where his sire Dubai Millennium failed as Godolphins talismanic runner suffered his only defeat at Epsom in the 1999 Derby.

 It is likely that Kinane will be riding the Brien second-strings in the Derby and Silk And Scarlet in the Oaks. 

 Kinane, now 45, returns to the stable he had left with little goodwill on either side. He had volunteered his services on Briens less fancied runners in the two Guineas but was overlooked. (Agencies)

Rayong (Thailand): Indias Shiv Kapur lost the play-off and the title to an amateur Chinarat Phadungsil in a shocking finish at the $300,000 Double A International Open at the St Andrews Hill Golf Club here on Sunday. 

The Indian star, who led by one shot at the start of the 18th hole on the final day, needed only a par on the closing hole to win the title. 

But he bogeyed it for a one-under 72 and tied with Chinarat who then won on the second play-off on the 18th hole. 

Despite the loss, Kapur got a cheque of $47,250. But what he lost out was a place in the lucrative $5 million HSBC Tournament and a two-year exemption on the Asian Tour. 

This was Kapurs career-best finish and also his fifth top-10 in last six starts. His earnings crossed the $100,000 mark and came to just under $115,000. 

Four Indians finished in top-10 with Harmeet Kahlon tied fourth, Amandeep Johl sole eighth and Rahil Gangjee tied ninth. Gaurav Ghei ended tied 12th and Digvijay Singh was tied 18th, making it six Indians in top-20. 

Another Thai, Thongchai Jaidee birdied the last hole, but still had to be content with the third place at 13-under 275, while Thammanoon Srirot, who was the premier challenger for Kapur in the morning, ran short of birdies on the back nine and ended with a 71 that saw him finish at 12-under 276 and in tied fourth place. 

When play started in the morning, Chinarat was hardly a contender in tied ninth place and there were no indications of his challenge even on the front nine, which he played in two-under. 

Then he exploded on the back nine birdying the last three holes to finish at 14-under. 

His back nine had five birdies and one bogey and threw a spanner in Kapurs plans. 

In contrast, Kapur who had dropped three shots on last three holes in third round, began the final day with a birdie and went to 14-under and two clear of his nearest rival Srirot.

 Rooney covets central role

 - He?s not wasted on left: Sven 

HENRY WINTER 

 Wayne Rooney 

Wayne Rooney said on Thursday that playing out wide for England was ?OK? but he would prefer to operate more centrally. England?s head coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, was criticised for not switching Rooney closer to Michael Owen when the 4-3-3 system was obviously misfiring during the 0-0 friendly bore with Holland on Wednesday. 

Rooney began on the left at Villa Park and occasionally switched flanks with Shaun Wright-Phillips. Asked if he would rather play more centrally, Rooney said: ?I think I would. Obviously I?m just proud to play for England and I?ll play wherever I?m picked. I did well in Euro 2004 in that (central) position, but obviously it?s good to try different things in friendlies in case we need it in a tournament. 

?I?ve played there (the left) most of the season for Manchester United, so it was nothing new for me. I?ve scored 12 goals from that position for United this season, and that?s more than I?ve scored in any of my other seasons.? 

Yet even seasoned Old Trafford experts such as Paddy Crerand have been noting that the team?s attack possesses a greater cutting edge when Rooney and Louis Saha work more in tandem. In his MUTV commentary for the Middlesbrough game, Crerand quite rightly cited the example of Saha?s nod-down for Rooney?s phenomenal volley. Rooney?s best position is marauding from a support-striker?s role. Euro 2004 confirmed that. 

Eriksson refused to accept that Rooney had been emasculated on the left. The coach does not do public displays of emotion, but even his inscrutable face flickered with a trace of animation on Thursday when the accusation was made that it was a ?waste of talent to play Rooney wide and out of position?. 

?Absolutely not,? Eriksson countered. By the Swede?s non-confrontational standards, this was an emphatic retort. But not convincing. 

Eriksson remained on the defensive, arguing that the teenager?s broad range of qualities allowed him to prosper all over the field. ?Rooney can play centre-forward, second striker, right, left and offensively in the midfield diamond,? Eriksson stressed. 

Rooney is a prince of all positions, but a king through the middle. England?s head coach clearly harbours reservations about Owen and Rooney as a partnership.

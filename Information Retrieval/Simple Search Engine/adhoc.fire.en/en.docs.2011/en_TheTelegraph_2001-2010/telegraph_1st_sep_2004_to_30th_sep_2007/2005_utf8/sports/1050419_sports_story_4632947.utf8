 Tikolo returns to lead Kenya

Nairobi: Cricket selectors on Monday re-appointed former captain Steve Tikolo to lead Kenya in April?s ICC Intercontinental Cup match against Uganda in Kampala. 

The 33-year-old batsman had announced his decision to step down last September and was among the senior players who walked out of the team over a pay row. 

?We have settled on Tikolo for the sake of continuation,? said his brother, Tom, who chairs the national interim selection committee. (AFP)

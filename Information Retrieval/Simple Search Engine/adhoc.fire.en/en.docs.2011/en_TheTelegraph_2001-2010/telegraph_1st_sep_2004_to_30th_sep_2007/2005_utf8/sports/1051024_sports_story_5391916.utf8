Bloemfontein: A quickfire 73 from Justin Kemp helped South Africa to a two-wicket victory with three balls to spare in the first one-day International against New Zealand on Sunday. 

Kemp dominated the closing overs to score his runs off 64 balls after South Africas middle-order had rallied from 85 for four to 182 for six. 

Craig McMillan had earlier scored a composed half-century to steer New Zealand to 249 for eight after they won the toss and chose to bat. 

McMillan was dismissed in the 43rd over when he tried to chip Kallis over the infield and lobbed a catch to Prince at wide mid-on, giving South Africas premier all rounder his 200th one-day wicket in his 221st International.

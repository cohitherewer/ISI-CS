 ICC stands to gain $2m annually: Mani

Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will make annual savings of around $2 million when its headquarters move from Lords to Dubai at the start of August. 

We do stand to gain a lot by way of taxation since the tax structure of Dubai is very competitive, Ehsan Mani, president of the ICC, said after performing the ground-breaking ceremony for the governing bodys base at the Dubai Sports City on Wednesday. 

The additional saving by the ICC would mean each Test country will get an extra $150,000 each year in grants and the funds of the associate members will shoot up another $500,000. This will help further globalise the game. 

Mani was joined at the ceremony by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed and board members Teddy Griffiths of the West Indies and Bob Marriman of Australia. (Reuters)

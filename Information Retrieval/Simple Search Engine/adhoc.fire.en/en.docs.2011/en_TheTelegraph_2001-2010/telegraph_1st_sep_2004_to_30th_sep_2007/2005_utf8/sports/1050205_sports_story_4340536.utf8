The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Clean sweep by India

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nadeem finished with 10/131 in the match 

Jamshedpur: Jharkhand left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem returned with a match haul of 10 for 131 to thrash England by an innings and 137 runs on the penultimate day of the third and final under-19 ?Test? at the Keenan Stadium, Friday. The Ambati Rayudu-led Indians made a clean sweep by winning the series 3-0. The hosts had already posted big victories in Bangalore and Calcutta to bag the series. 

Bokaro-based Nadeem, who bagged four for 108 in the first innings and six for 23 in the second, bowled exceedingly well on a placid track to return with a such a rich haul. The spinner, who made his Ranji debut this season, concentrated on flight and fully exploited the weakness of the English batsmen against the spinners. 

The visitors made a mockery of the whole situation thanks to their insipid batting on a track where the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara and Manoj Tewari revelled. Puajara was adjudged the Man of the Match. Poor shot selection and failure to properly read the deliveries was instrumental for the collapse of English batting. 

Made to follow on, after being dismissed for 258 in the first essay, the English side was sent packing for a paltry 77 just over half-an-hour before tea. Nadeem, who mixed his flighted deliveries with the flatter ones, foxed the visiting batsmen time and again. The youngster, who was overlooked for the first two ?Tests?, justified the trust reposed in him. 

Nadeem, who picked up four for 108 in the first innings, scripted the collapse after the dismissal of openers Michael O?Shea and Joseph Denly. He evicted skipper Steven Davies by having him caught by Rayudu and later claimed Ben Harmison by trapping him leg before with one which went straight off the arm. England were in dire straits at 28 for four and Nadeem showed no mercy by picking up wickets at regular intervals. 

John Simpson was the next to depart when Rayudu caught him off leggie Piyush Chawla. Nadeem came back to wrap off the innings. 

Earlier, resuming at 189 for four, England were dismissed for 258, falling 64 short to avoid the follow-on. Barring a painstaking 65 by Ben Harmison and an unbeaten 29 by Steven Mullaney, others failed to contribute. Nadeem claimed four for 108 while Chawla returned with three for 59.

 Its back to 

1-session qualifying

Paris: Formula One racing will change to a one-lap, one-session qualifying format from the European Grand Prix next weekend, the sports ruling body announced on Monday. 

Qualifying will take place on Saturday over a one-hour session, involving a single timed lap, the FIA said in a statement. 

The controversial Sunday qualifying has been axed. Races so far this season have adopted an aggregate format with the grid decided by the times from Saturday and Sunday. 

Meanwhile, struggling champions Ferrari hopes change to Formula Ones qualifying system will boost Michael Schumachers chances in his home race at the Nuerburgring next weekend. 

The change would be effective from Sundays European Grand Prix in Germany. 

I am sure it will not disturb us. I think it will probably be better for us, team boss Jean Todt told reporters in Monaco on Sunday after his team had extended their losing streak to seven races. 

Seven-time world champion Schumacher, who won the first five races of 2004, has just 12 points after six races this year. 

Ferrari, winners of 15 of the 18 races last year, have struggled with new rules this season that state drivers must use the same set of tyres for both qualifying and the race. 

Last year, when teams changed tyres at pitstops, Ferrari clearly had the best for short sprints. 

They had problems in getting performance from the Bridgestone tyres over a single lap in Monaco, where qualifying is crucial, but were untroubled in the race. 

We dont have good enough tyres for the qualifying and the others dont have good enough tyres for the race. At the moment it seems its better to qualify in front rather than be very strong during the race, said Todt. (Reuters)

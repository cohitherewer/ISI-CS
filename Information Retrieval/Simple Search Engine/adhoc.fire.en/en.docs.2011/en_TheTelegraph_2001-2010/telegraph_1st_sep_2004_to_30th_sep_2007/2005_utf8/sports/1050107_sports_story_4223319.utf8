 Indian football team to tour Pak

Islamabad: Indian team is expected to tour Pakistan for its first ever football series in the country in June, Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) officials have said. 

?The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to send their team to Pakistan in June this year to play the first ever three-match series between two countries,? PFF?s Director Technical Lt-Col (Retd) Mujahidullah Khan said. 

The Indian team was earlier slated to visit here in February on the invitation of PFF secretary general Arshad Khan Lodhi but the AIFF had deferred the tour citing their busy domestic circuit. 

The officials of the two countries had met last month in Kuala Lumpur where AIFF secretary general Alberto Colaco informed about India?s decision to postpone the tour. 

Colaco had promised to send their team later after his Pakistan counterpart Agha Liaquat had expressed disappointment over the decision. 

?Now, the Indian federation has agreed to undertake the first ever tour to Pakistan, which would also be the first ever series between the two countries, in June 2005,? Liaquat was quoted as saying in The News Thursday. 

Although the AIFF was keen to play three matches, the PFF was insisting on five matches as it wanted to hold a match at every provincial capital in Lahore, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar and Islamabad. 

?Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad will host the matches if the series consists of three games,? he added.

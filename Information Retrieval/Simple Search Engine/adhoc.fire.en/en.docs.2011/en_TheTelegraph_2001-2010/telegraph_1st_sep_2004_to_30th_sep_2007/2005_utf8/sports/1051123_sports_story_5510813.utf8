 Wie expects to make cut

Kochi (Japan): Michelle Wie expects to make the cut and finish under par at this weeks Casio World Open on the Japanese mens Tour. 

Hopefully Ill be able to put together four good rounds under par, the 16-year old Hawaiian said after practising at Kuroshio Country Club on Tuesday. Im feeling great. My aim is to win the tournament. 

Wie will be making her sixth start against the men in the $1.7 million JGTO Tour event which starts on Thursday, and her first since she turned professional last month. She is yet to make the cut. 

You never know whats going to happen, said Wie. I could play bad ? but hopefully I can be consistent and play well. 

This weeks tournament will be Wies first since she was disqualified in her professional debut at the Womens World Championship in Palm Desert, California, last month when she fell foul of a drop violation in her third round. 

Wie took a drop after hitting her ball into a bush and was adjudged to have dropped the ball nearer the hole. She forfeited the fourth place and $53,000. 

However, the Honolulu schoolgirl said she was not overawed at competing against men and reiterated her long-held desire to play in the US Masters at Augusta National. 

To play in the mens tournaments I have to keep getting stronger and get more distance, Wie said. 

There are so many great players on the mens ? and womens ? side. Hopefully, I can keep improving and eventually play in the Masters. 

Swedens Sophie Gustafson missed the cut at the 2003 Casio World Open, the only other time a woman has played in a JGTO Tour event. 

Wie said she had become more motivated since turning professional, but was anxious to point out it had not changed her outlook on life. Turning pro has made me a lot more motivated than I was before.

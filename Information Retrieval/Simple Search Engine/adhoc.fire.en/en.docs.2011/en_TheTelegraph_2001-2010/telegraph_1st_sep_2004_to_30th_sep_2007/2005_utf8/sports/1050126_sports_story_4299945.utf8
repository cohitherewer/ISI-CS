The Telegraph - Calcutta

 While fielding, watch ball from bowler?s 

 hand

Ravi Shastri

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 I am very weak on offside while facing fast bowlers. How 

 can I overcome this problem? 

 (Avijit Saha, 16, Bardhaman)

 Check on your grip. There may 

 be a problem in the way you hold the bat. Also you will 

 need to work with your coach on your footwork.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. 

 What is the length I should concentrate on when bowling 

 a bouncer? 

 (Harshjyoti Das, 15, Guwahati-19)

 It should be an effort ball used 

 as a surprise weapon. It should be high enough and well 

 directed to make it awkward for the batsman.

 I am a righthanded batsman 

 and like to play shots from the outset. But this often leads 

 to my dismissal. Should I cut down on my aggressive approach?

 (Sovan Basu, 21, Athpur, North 

 24 Parganas)

 Be watchful early on and get used 

 to the pace and bounce of the wicket. Be selective in shotmaking.

 I am an off-spinner. What 

 length should I bowl to when trying to get leg before decisions 

 against a lefthander?

 (Narendra Lunawat, 23, Bongaigaon)

 Make sure it pitches around middle 

 and leg and the goes on to hit the stumps.

 I am a mediumpacer. I often 

 fail to hit the right line when bowling an outswinger. I 

 try and bowl from as close to the stumps as possible. Why 

 does this happen?

 (Rathin Deb, 17, Calcutta-4)

 Make sure that you are not falling 

 away at the time of delivery. And also try and get into 

 a good side-on position.

 I am a lefthanded batsman. 

 I often fail to judge the incoming ball from a mediumpacer. 

 As a result, I get bowled. Please help. 

 (Tapan Dutta, 18, Calcutta-42)

 You are obviously not watching 

 the ball close enough. Watch the position of your feet as 

 well.

 I am a righthanded batsman 

 and often get caught in the square leg region trying to 

 defend a bouncer. Please help.

 (Arijit Roy, 17, Calcutta-10)

 Keep your eyes on the ball and 

 also play with a loose bottomhand in front of your eyes 

 so that the ball goes to the ground.

 How can one improve concentration 

 when fielding in the slips?

 (Aveek Saha, 21, Calcutta-37)

 Lots of practice and watching 

 the ball all the way out of the bowler?s hand all the time.

 I am a wicketkeeper. I often 

 fail to anticipate balls that deviate and go down the leg 

 side. Please help.

 (Ravi Jha, 17, Jamshedpur)

 Work on your footwork when moving 

 sideways. Also don?t get up too early.

 Which life do you enjoy 

 more ? a cricketer or a commentator.

 (Roshan Nayak, 17, Sambalpur)

 Nothing beats playing for your 

 country against tough opposition and performing. Commentary 

 is the second best thing to playing Test cricket.

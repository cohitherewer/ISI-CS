 Mukesh beats rookie Malik in play-off 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mukesh Kumar came from behind to win the inaugural Hero Honda Open East at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Saturday, edging out rookie Amardip Sinh Malik from Meerut in a play-off. 

He carded a final day one-under 71 to finish with an aggregate of 4-under 284 over four days. 

Malik brought in a fourth-round 74 for an aggregate of 4-under 284 to force the Mukesh into the play-off. 

Local lad Sankar Das almost pushed his way into the play-off too, but he bogeyed the 18th to finish at 3-under 285. 

He was one of only two players on the final day to shoot a 2-under 70, the other being Mohammed Salim. 

In the play-off, Mukeshs experience pulled him through. Malik nearly sunk in a putt from about 30 feet away on the 18th green, the play-off hole, to shake Mukesh a bit. 

Mukesh however kept a calm head, to finish on top yet again. 

Firoz Ali, leader for the last two days, started the day at 9-under 207 but missed the pin almost on a regular basis to finish with a seven-over 79 for the day. He finished in fourth place, with a total of 2-under 286. 

Akshay Butta came from behind to pip Ranjit Singh as the best amateur. With scores of 71, 78, 76, 74 over four days, Akshay had a total of 11-over 299, a narrow one-stroke lead over Ranjit, who ended at 12-over 300.

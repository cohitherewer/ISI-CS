The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kothari to train Myanmar team

A STAFF REPORTER

 Kothari will be on a 15-day trip 

Calcutta: Former world amateur billiards champion and Indian national coach Manoj Kothari will train the Myanmar national billiards side. Kothari was approached by the Myanmar government during the Asian billiards championship held in Pune from February 19 to 26. Kothari will leave for Myanmar on April 21 and will be there till May 5. 

It was learnt that Myanmar, who won the silver medal at the Busan Asian Games, are now focussing on the SEA Games and are keen to win the gold there. ?I was offered a stint of one month, but ultimately I will go for a 15-day camp and if needed, I will make further visits in future,? Kothari told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

According to Kothari, there will be around eight players who will get training during his stay. Two of the players ? Kayaw and Ang Tsan Oo ? have also fared well in the just concluded Asian meet and are common faces in Asian billiards circuit. ?Most importantly they don?t have any formal training in the sport, all they have learnt is by managing few cassettes of Indian players, especially Geet Sethi,? Kothari revealed. 

Previously, the Billiards and Snooker Federation of Myanmar (BSFM), on behalf of their government sought permission from the Billiards and Snooker Federation of India (BSFI) president P.N. Roy for hiring a coach from this sub-continent. ?BSFI has granted permission to me despite being a national coach as it is not clashing with our national side?s engagements,? Kothari stated. 

Quite interestingly, Kayaw and Tsan Oo were among spectators in Bangalore when Kothari won his world title in 1990.

Paris: Rangers rewrote the record books by becoming the first Scottish club to make it into the last 16 of the Champions League with a tense 1-1 draw against former title-holders Inter Milan. 

Despite the result, under-fire manager Alex McLeish was uncertain whether this welcome bit of good fortune would save his job after a disastrous domestic campaign. 

When asked if this would be his last match in charge of the Ibrox team, he told a television channel: I dont know. We will have chats over the next couple of days with the chairman. 

Im sure we will have something to say in, maybe, 48 hours or so. 

He called the result a great night for Scottish football. 

I am absolutely jubilant because they played a very disciplined performance tonight (Tuesday) against a very dangerous team. The players were magnificent ? fantastic. 

We are through troubled times ? none more so than myself ? and we showed character and spirit that befits this club. 

Over in Italy, Milan only narrowly escaped an ignominious exit from a competition they have claimed six times. 

The European campaign of last years finalists was on a knife-edge going into their final group match against Schalke 04. 

Six-time former champions AC Milan were pushed all the way by Schalke at the San Siro before clinging on for a 3-2 victory that put them through as group winners, with Brazilian midfielder Kaka scoring twice. 

So tight was group E, however, that a 3-3 draw would have meant Schalke went through at the Italian clubs expense and there were ugly scenes at the final whistle with punches thrown in scuffles among the players. 

Kaka refused to take all the applause for steering Milan into the knockout stages. Im just happy to have helped the team, said the 23-year-old Brazil international. Now we have to keep calm and maintain the same mentality. We survived a difficult group. 

Dutch side PSV Eindhoven went through in second after beating Fenerbahce 2-0. 

The glamour game of the night was played out at Stamford Bridge where reigning champions Liverpool drew 0-0 with English Premiership title-holders Chelsea. 

Both teams had already done enough to qualify with the result leaving Liverpool topping group G. 

The game was marred by an atrocious, shin-high tackle on Dietmar Hamann by Chelseas Ghanaian midfielder Michael Essien. 

But as had been the case with his sickening studs-up thrust into the knee of Boltons Tal Ben Haim earlier this season, Essien stayed on the pitch. 

Mystifyingly, German referee Herbert Fandel not merely saw nothing amiss, but gave the free-kick Chelseas way. 

That may be a mixed blessing for Chelsea, though, for the fact that the referee apparently did not see the incident allows European soccer governing body Uefa to impose its own, retrospective, punishment. 

The challenge clearly upset Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez at the time, and at the post-match press conference he remarked: I could see the tackle. It was just in front of the bench. 

Ive also seen Dietmar Hamann s leg. I have an idea that in this kind of situation they (Uefa) should look at the video. 

Real Madrids first game in the post Wanderley Luxemburgo era ended in an embarrassing 1-2 defeat to Olympiakos. 

The Greeks first win of the 2005-06 Champions League season was achieved against a weakened Spanish opposition when Brazilian striker Rivaldo scored in the final three minutes. 

Real, with second team mentor Ramon Lopez Caro in temporary charge after Luxemburgos sacking at the weekend, took the lead when 19-year-old defender Sergio Ramos headed a Raul Bravo free-kick in the seventh minute. 

Turkish defender Erol Bulut levelled in the 50th minute before Rivaldo claimed the winner.

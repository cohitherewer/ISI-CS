 Chanda, Kunte in joint fourth spot

 - Kunte draws with Lordachescu 

 Sandipan Chanda 

Dubai: Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda stole the third round honours after defeating David Navara of Czech Republic in the Dubai International Open chess championship here. 

Overnight joint leader GM Abhijit Kunte, white, drew with higher rated Viorel Lordachescu of Moldova but went out of the leading pack in this $40,000 prize money tournament being played under Fide?s Swiss rules. 

With six rounds still remaining in the 147 players event, Zhao Jinchao of China and Georgian duo of Merab Gangunashvili and Georgi Kacheishvili emerged as joint leaders with three points each from as many games. 

Kunte and Sandipan, after the win over his third-seeded rival, shared the fourth spot jointly along with top seed Alexey Motylev of Russia and 16 others while GM Koneru Humpy, International Masters Lanka Ravi and S. Kidambi were amongst 48 players who have two points apiece. 

The Indian players again came up with good performances in the third round as Humpy drew with GM Sergey Volkov of Russia showing resilience during her tight ropewalk. 

Kidambi was also impressive in holding Chinese GM Ni Hua and Lanka Ravi easily outplayed Samer Mehdi of Iran. 

Also reaching a respectable score of two points were IM norm holders G. Rohit, Parimarjan Negi, and Abhijeet Gupta who all had relatively easier outings against Aswin Jayaram, Antoine Kassis of Libya and Alexander Menshikov of Russia respectively. 

The other Indians to move in to the two pointers group were International Women Master Eesha Karavade, G. Balaji and N. Srinath who also came up with victories in the third round. 

On the receiving end was GM R. B. Ramesh who failed to deliver the goods against Chinese GM Zhang Pengxiang. 

Playing white, Sandipan expectedly did not venture into the Marshall gambit and instead went for a fashionable variation in Ruy Lopez. 

The Indian gained the bishop pair advantage in the middle game and after the exchange of queens had some advantage, thanks to better space control. Navara did quite well to maintain the balance for a long time and steered the game to a drawn rook and pawns endgame despite being two pawns less. 

Harikrishna held 

World junior champion P. Harikrishna survived some anxious moments before drawing with world?s youngest ever GM Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine in the sixth round of the category-16 Dos Hermanas International chess tournament. 

The draw helped Harikrishna retain his joint fifth spot in the overall standings. 

However, little changed at the top as draws ruled the roost in the sixth round and Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan maintained his slender half point lead over nearest rivals Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia, Ruben Felgaer of Argentina and Karjakin who all have 3.5 points in their kitty. (PTI)

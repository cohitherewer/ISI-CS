Calcutta: Only a miracle can now save Tollygunge Agragami from relegation to the second division of the National Football League as they were thrashed 1-3 by JCT at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

After the 18th round, Tollygunge are now on 15 points, ahead of Vasco (14) and SBT (13). 

It was once again the defence in general and Suley Musah in particular, that had let Tollygunge down against JCT. The Ghanaian, who was looking awfully short on match fitness, was an immobile spectator when JCT scuppered the home team?s hopes with two quick goals in the first half. 

Their goalkeeper Sudip Sarkar was also equally responsible in conceding the first in the 16th minute as he reacted late to a thumping 22-yard grounder from Man-of-the-Match Manjit Singh. Musah didn?t show any intention to block the JCT player at that time. 

The next blow for Biswajit Das? team came after 13 minute. Musah didn?t move as Sukhjinder Singh met a cross from the right and promptly squared the ball for Sakatar Singh to drive in. 

JCT deservedly extended the lead in the 73rd minute. Substitute Baldeep Singh?s attempted low cross took a deflection off Isiaka Awoyemi and fell in the path of Harvinder. The latter didn?t have any difficulty in completing the formality. Suman eventually managed to pull one back for the home team with four minutes to go, but his effort too late to change the course of the action.

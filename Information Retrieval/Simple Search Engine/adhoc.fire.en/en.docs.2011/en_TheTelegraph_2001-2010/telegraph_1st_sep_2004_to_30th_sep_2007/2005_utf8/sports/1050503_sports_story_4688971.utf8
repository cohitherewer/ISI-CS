 Shoaib Malik in squad despite one-Test ban

Karachi: Shoaib Malik was on Monday banned for one Test and fined 75 per cent of his match fee but was still named in a 17-member squad that did not include an unfit Shoaib Akhtar and Moin Khan for the upcoming tour of the West Indies. 

The decision to ban Malik was taken by the PCB?s ad-hoc committee which met on Monday to finalise the squad as well as decide the fate of the allrounder who admitted conceding Sialkot Stallions? Twenty20 Cup match against Karachi Zebras. 

Malik, who was immediately fined Rs 10,000 by match referee Rizwan Khateeb, later appeared before a three-man inquiry committee constituted by the PCB that submitted its findings to the disciplinary committee. 

The committee found Malik guilty and recommended penalties in accordance with the level II of the ICC Code of Conduct that recommends a match fine between 50 per cent and 100 per cent or ban for one Test or two one-day Internationals. The allrounder will thus miss the first Test starting in Barbados on May 26. 

The committee also decided to include uncapped opener Bazid Khan while leaving out pacemen Mohammad Sami. It seems Moin had to pay the price for the leakage of the Pakistan team two days before the meeting, forcing the selectors to be a little different.

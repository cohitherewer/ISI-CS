 London: Manchester United are investigating a bugging incident at Old Trafford after audio tapes were offered to a newspaper, the club?s website said on Saturday.

 The tapes were apparently recorded in the home dressing room last Sunday, the day United beat champions Chelsea 1-0.

 The contents reportedly include pre-match and halftime team-talks, plus celebratory comments following the victory, the website said.

 The paper handed the tapes to United on Friday before publishing details in Saturday?s newspaper.

 Guwahati: The 33rd National Games, scheduled to be held here in December-January, was postponed to October, Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi said here on Saturday.

 The postponement had been taken in view of the upcoming elections in Assam and a crowded sports calendar in the first half of next year across the country, Kalmadi told a press conference.

 quot;IOA is not in a hurry to hold the Games and would prefer deferring by a few months than compromising on the quality of construction works. Every thing has to be perfect and well organised, quot; he pointed out.

 Inspecting some Games sites, he said, quot;the infrastructure coming up in Assam is so far the best among what I have seen in recent times and it can easily hold big games like the Asian Games quot;.

 The IOA president also said after Assam, the next Games would be held in Ranchi.

 Doha: China?s Gu Wei set two world records while sweeping the women?s 58kg competition at the centennial World Weightlifting meet here on Friday.

 Wei won the snatch and the clean and jerk on way to the overall gold with a total lift of 241 kg, a kg better than the previous world record of compatriot Wang Li set in Bali in 2003. She also set a new world mark in the clean and jerk, with her third lift effort of 139 kg proving a whopping four kg better than Thailand?s Wandee Kameaim, who had hoisted 135 kg a few minutes earlier.

 Beijing: China on Saturday issued a series of postage stamps commemorating the 2008 Olympic Games, one day after the 1,000-day countdown to the event?s opening ceremony.

 The stamps, six in a set, feature the 2008 Olympic Emblem and the five doll mascots, which were unveiled Friday at a grand ceremony in the Chinese capital.

 Sydney: Ian Thorpe will make his long-awaited comeback to competitive swimming at next weekend?s World Cup meet in Sydney.

 The Australian swimmer has not competed since winning the 200m-400m freestyle double at last year?s Olympic Games in Athens but has been back in training since July this year.

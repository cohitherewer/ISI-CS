 Bangkok: Europe?s elite players will take on the best of Asia in a Ryder Cup-style competition in Thailand in January, organisers said on Wednesday. Five-time major winner Seve Ballesteros has been named as Europe?s non-playing captain for the inaugural Royal Trophy event at Bangkok?s Amata Spring Country Club from January 5-8.

 The competition, which will be an annual event comprising eight players on each team, has been sanctioned by the European, Asian and Japanese tours. The teams will compete in 16 matches involving foursomes, four-ball and singles. 

 The first five years of the competition are expected to be played in Bangkok with the event after that alternating between Europe and Asia.

 Taipei: Gaurav Ghei, in contention till the closing stages of the Taiwan Open last year, returns to the $300,000 event with greater hope on Thursday along and Arjun Singh, Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon and Shiv Kapur. There is a lot at stake as they all make a bid for good finishes to ensure a full card for 2006. 

 Last year here, Ghei had shared the lead after three rounds. On the final day, he finished with a two-over card and ended tied third, as Charlie Wi rocketed to the top with a four-under 68. This year Wi is missing as he is playing on the US Tour, but Terry Pilkadaris, who was second, is back. The field is led by Thaworn Wiratchant.

 The Grand Slam is scheduled for November 22-23 at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Kauai, Hawaii. The meet features a total purse of $1 million with $400,000 going to the winner.

 ?I was very angry when I went home,? said former Argentina Maradona, who has taken on a role as Boca?s football vice-president. ?I?m sure the people who insulted Basile are not supporters of our team.?

 However, Maradona conceded that Boca?s performance against Argentinos Juniors left much to be desired. 

 Madrid: Villarreal?s Argentine playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme will miss his side?s Champions League group D clash against Manchester United due to injury, the club said on Wednesday.

Centurion: In a nail-biting finish, Africa XI edged out Asia XI by two runs in the first match of the Afro-Asian Cup here on Wednesday. Chasing a target of 199, last man Ashish Nehra was castled by South African paceman Dale Steyn off the first ball of the penultimate over when only three runs were needed for victory. 

The Asia XI got off to a brisk start, thanks to Virender Sehwag and Kumar Sangakkara, who survived a few anxious moments against Africa XI captain Shaun Pollock and Dale Steyn. 

They added 50 runs for the opening wicket in 10 overs before Pollock showed why he is regarded as one of the great seam bowlers of the current era. 

In one over, the Africa XI skipper removed Sehwag, Yousuf Youhana and super-sub Mohammad Ashraful to reduce Asia XI to 52 for three. 

The Asians were looking towards captain Inzamam-ul Haq to bail them out but, for once, he fell to a mistimed pull off African substitute Justin Kemp. 

Shahid Afridi hit out for a while but it was too good to last and when Sangakkara also played on to Kallis, the visitors were reduced to 96 for six. It needed the experienced Anil Kumble and Abdul Razzaq to steady the ship with a 56 run stand which brought the Asians back. Just when it seemed the Asians would make it, Kallis trapped Kumble lbw for 24. Zaheer Khan joined Razzaq and they took the team close before the latter nicked to Boucher for 38. 

Earlier, Africa XI relied on Ashwell Princes unbeaten 78 to recover from early jolts and post a fighting total. 

The Africans crumbled to 57 for five before recovering through an 84-run stand between Prince and Boucher. Zaheer Khan struck three quick blows. (agencies)

 Aussies to target Mithali Raj

 Mithali Raj 

Durban: India?s impressive run in the women?s World Cup has forced four-time winners Australia to guard against complacency as the two teams get ready for the title-round clash at Centurion?s Supersport Park on Sunday. 

Australia are undefeated in the tournament so far, but captain Belinda Clark doesn?t want to take any chances and has urged her players to put up a disciplined performance. 

Clark said her team would be targeting her counterpart Mithali Raj, who is in superb form averaging a tournament-high of 64 with the bat. 

?We?ll be looking to see her back as soon as possible,? Clark said of Mithali, whose unbeaten 91 off 104 balls helped India secure their maiden World Cup final at the expense of New Zealand. ?They rely on their opening bowlers, the spinners, and we?ll need to be disciplined to survive them.? 

The Aussies had won the one-day series in India in November-December 4-3. 

Australian coach Steve Jenkin said the team was looking forward to beating the Indians. ?The women are really keen to play them. They?re the only team we haven?t played and beaten yet,? he was quoted as saying by an Australian website. The round-robin clash was out without a ball being bowled. 

?They?ve beaten us more than any other side in the past four years. They?re a better team now than they?ve ever been, they?re a lot fitter, a lot more agile, and it?s going to be a tough game.? 

Jenkin said thoughts of the previous World Cup final, when Australia narrowly lost to New Zealand, would not interfere with Sunday?s performance. ?We?re not looking at four years ago, we?re looking at Sunday,? he said. ?We made a commitment to ourselves not to think about it or talk about it. It?s in the past.? (PTI)

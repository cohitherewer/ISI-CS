The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Fine confirmed

New Delhi: Sourav Ganguly has been fined 70 per cent of his match fee for his side?s slow over-rate during the third ODI in Jamshedpur on Saturday, the ICC said on its official website Sunday. 

?India have a history of bowling their overs slowly in one-day cricket but past events couldn?t be taken into consideration in this case because they happened outside the previous 12 month period,? Match Referee Chris Broad was quoted as saying on the website. ?Ganguly accepts responsibility for? slow over-rate and will aim to improve things for the forthcoming matches in this exciting series.? 

That his penalty will be restricted to a fine was reported by The Telegraph on Sunday. (PTI)

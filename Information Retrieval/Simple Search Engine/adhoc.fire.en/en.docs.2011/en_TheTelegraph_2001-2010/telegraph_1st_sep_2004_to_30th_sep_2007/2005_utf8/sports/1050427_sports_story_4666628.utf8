The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sachin, Lara will lead teams

London: Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar will lead the two teams in the tsunami appeal match at Lord?s on June 14. 

India?s Tendulkar will captain the MCC side with West Indian Lara leading the International XI, the MCC said in a statement on Tuesday. 

This, however, is not an officially sanctioned game unlike the Asia XI versus ICC XI clash on January 10. 

?Last month, we were delighted to announce that the two best spinners in the world ? Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan ? had kindly agreed to play in this very important fund-raising fixture. Today, we can announce that it will feature arguably the world?s two best batsmen as well,? the MCC said. 

Other players lined up to take part in the Lord?s match include Stephen Fleming and Graeme Smith. (Reuters)

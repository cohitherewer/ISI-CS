 Shane Warne dropped the urn

Guest Column

When Shane Warne dropped Kevin Pietersen at first slip, little did he know that he had just dropped the Ashes. 

If he had caught Pietersen at that time, England would have been under tremendous pressure and I think Australia would have won. 

From that moment, Pietersen attacked, and I am delighted for him and England that it worked brilliantly. He is not very good at defending because his game is based on confrontation. 

Some people can play long, defensive innings, like Michael Atherton or myself, but its not a strategy that works for most people. Its important to know what your strength is. And Pietersen played to his. 

Certainly he had a slice of luck. But youve got to be good enough to grasp that bit of fortune and make it work for you. 

Some people might think that Matthew Hayden also had an opportunity to pick him up at slip off Warne. But the fact is that the ball hit the wicketkeepers glove and Hayden had no chance of catching it. 

Everyone has been dropped at some time or other, but the key is what you do after being dropped ? whether youve got the mental strength, the ability and the technique under pressure to take advantage. 

Full marks to the lad because hes done terrifically well. Ive been saying he hasnt made a major contribution to England for five innings, but when its mattered he has come good. 

Ill say again, he has to go up to No.4. He is capable of taking the game away from the opposition and you have to have someone at No.4 who can do that. 

Im sorry, but for me Ian Bell looks like a rabbit frozen in the headlights. If he is going to play he has got to do it down the order. 

Pietersen is a belligerent individual. He is cocky and confident; there is a touch of arrogance about him. I love it, so long as he produces runs. 

All the great players have had self-confidence and self-belief. They have all been full of themselves. But the point is that they have delivered. Up until this point, Pietersen has had the persona but he hasnt had the runs. All we want now is for him to take a catch, and then he has cracked Test cricket. 

Australias problem was that after the initial wickets, you only felt they would make progress from Warnes end. After a while Ricky Ponting asked Brett Lee to bowl into the body. 

It didnt work against Pietersen, who smacked him everywhere, but it caused problems for Ashley Giles and Paul Collingwood. So where were the fielders at bat-pad and leg gully when the ball was getting up to hit the gloves? 

I know that Warne is a match-winner but even his fingers must get tired bowling from one end. When Australia got stuck, why didnt Ponting give him a couple of overs rest and try Michael Clarke or Simon Katich, then bring on Warne from the other end, just for something different? 

When you get stuck and cant get wickets youve got to try something different, even if he is the greatest spinner of all time. 

When you start against a good spinner who is turning the ball, its damn difficult with three or four men around the bat. But once you stay in for a while and get runs it becomes easier. You get used to the pace of the pitch and the amount of spin. 

When Pietersen had got his hundred, his confidence was so high that he was playing Warne with my old favourite, the stick of rhubarb. He went ages without missing one, and even when the ball turned on him, he had the confidence to run it down past slip. Thats why you have to change the bowling round. 

Michael Vaughan has won the battle of the captains. He has been far superior in his imagination and inventiveness, both with field placings and bowling changes. That is a tribute to him but also to the coach and his back-room staff, who have had a big input. 

Unlike England, Australia are not used to being in these tense positions. They have always stuck to the simple plan: make a big total then pressurise the opposition with Warne and Glenn McGrath. 

Englands seam bowling has been better than Australias in this series. The batting has probably been equal, but we have had the most influential player on either side in Andrew Flintoff. At crucial points, he has been able to lift the team and the public with his batting and bowling. Flintoff has been the match-winner. 

I played in four Ashes-winning sides, so when you think that England havent won the Ashes in 18 years, I have been lucky. Today I just feel pleased for the team and for the country. 

Many doubted it could happen. I for one thought Australia would win 2-1, because while I was always confident that we had the attack to bowl them out, I was worried about their much-vaunted batting. Englands top and middle order seemed a bit wobbly; theirs had so many big guns. It just shows that you can never be quite sure in sport.

 Souravs presence a boon: Deep 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta feels presence of Sourav Ganguly comes as a boost for Bengal in their Ranji Trophy match against Maharashtra, but the former India captain is always made for the national side. 

We would always wish to see Sourav playing for the national side? that is what he is made for, said the Bengal vice-captain on Saturday. 

Bengal leave for Pune on Monday and Sourav would join the team a day later. 

We dont expect Sourav to be with us continuously. But his presence will always be a boon against a tough side like Maharashtra, Deep said. Sourav will lead Bengal in Pune. 

Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey also said that the team is mentally prepared to miss Sourav in the season.

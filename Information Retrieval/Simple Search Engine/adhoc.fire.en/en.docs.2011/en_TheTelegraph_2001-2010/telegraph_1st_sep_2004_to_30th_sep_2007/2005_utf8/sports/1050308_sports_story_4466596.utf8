 Former Pak stars wish team luck 

 Karachi: Former Pakistan captains Fazal Mahmood and Moin Khan joined the bandwagon of cricket fans who wished the national team ?best of luck? ahead of the first Test against India. 

?Just play your best cricket and forget everything else. For the next five days, you should be thinking of the Test match and nothing else,? Fazal, who led Pakistan on the 1960 tour of India, said from Lahore. 

He advised them to forget their recent debacles and start afresh Tuesday. ?I have complete faith in my team. What has happened before is history. 

?Tomorrow will be a new day and they should start afresh. The team should give their best shot and performance, and leave the rest to the almighty,? Fazal said. 

?Pakistan cricket team has our complete support and blessing. They should take inspiration from the last two tours and think positively,? Moin Khan, who is favourite to join the team for the one-day series starting from April 2 in Kochi, said. 

?My advice to the boys is to remember their cricketing achievements. I mean Inzamam, Youhana, Younis should recall their glorious innings while Kaneria, Sami should remember their best bowling achievements. 

Moin also said Pakistan were now a well knit and united team. ?Inzamam has gelled the team well and together, they were one unit. I think this will be the secret to their success because in the past also, we won because of team spirit and unity.? 

Iqbal Qasim, who bowled Pakistan to a historic win over India in Bangalore in 1986, said: ?We read the team wrong and consequently, selected the wrong playing eleven. 

?But we had the spirit, determination and commitment which helped us win that Test even after we were dismissed for 116 in the first innings,? Qasim, now a national selector, said. (PTI)

 Montreal: Rome has been chosen to host the 2009 world swimming championships, the sport?s governing body FINA said on Saturday. Italy?s capital city fought off competition from Athens, Moscow and Yokohama for the right to stage the 13th edition of the event.

 ?The difficulty of our choice proves that these four bidders were excellent,? FINA president Mustapha Larfaoui told a news conference in Montreal, the city that is hosting the 2005 championships.

 ?FINA is very proud to count on these prestigious candidates. Their effort is the guarantee that the FINA brand and the impact of our sports worldwide is constantly improving.? 

 Jerusalem: Israeli police cancelled an event on Sunday with Mark Spitz due to a barrage of Palestinian mortar and rocket fire, organisers said. Spitz, who won seven golds in the 1972 Olympics, was scheduled to give swimming lessons to 100 children in Sderot in an act of solidarity with the Israeli city that has been targetted by Palestinian rockets and mortars during nearly five years of fighting.

 London: Premier League champions Chelsea agreed a fee with Manchester City for their England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips on Sunday. ?As a result of Shaun?s request to speak to Chelsea we have conducted a series of complex negotiations with Chelsea,? Manchester City?s communications chief Paul Tyrrell said on the club?s website. ?A fee for Shaun?s transfer has been agreed and consequently we have granted his wish to talk to the other club.? 

 Dubai: Former Netherlands coach Dick Advocaat signed a one-year deal on Sunday to take charge of the United Arab Emirates national side.

 The Dutchman, who led the Netherlands to the Euro 2004 semi-finals, replaces compatriot Aad De Mos. quot;The one-year contract will expire six months before the (2007) Gulf Cup, but he has given his commitment to renew the contract if he performed to our satisfaction, quot; Khaled bin Faris, head of the UAE Football Associations technical committee said.

 Advocaat resigned as Borussia Moenchengladbach coach less than six months into the job in April. 

 Bolton: British fighter Amir Khan marked his professional debut in stunning style by stopping compatriot David Bailey in the first round.

 The Olympic Games lightweight silver medallist twice had his more experienced opponent on the canvas with a blistering combination and the bout was then halted by the referee after just 109 seconds.

 The 18-year-old produced a devastating display to underline his potential in the paid ranks after thrilling his hometown crowd with a brief but brilliant display.

 Khan floored his opponent twice before overwhelming him with his blurring hand speed and accuracy of his punches. Bailey, 24, had lost four of his seven fights before facing Khan and never posed a problem for the teenager. 

 Las Vegas: Jermain Taylor battled his way to a stunning upset win over Bernard Hopkins on Sunday, the challenger edging a split decision to become the new middleweight world champion.

 Suffering a first loss in more than 12 years, 

 Hopkins failed in his bid to record a 21st straight defence 

 of his crown after letting Taylor dictate the early rounds 

 of the contest.

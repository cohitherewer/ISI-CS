 Harikrishna back in business after draw 

Taiyuan: World junior champion Grandmaster P. Harikrishna crashed threw the defences of Tigran Petrosian of Armenia to return to his winning ways in the second Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters tournament here. 

It turned out to be another fine day for the Indian stalwart after he was temporarily halted by Wang Yue of China in the previous round on Friday. The victory gave Harikrishna another reason to celebrate as he extended his lead yet again to a whopping 1.5 points in the category-15 double round-robin event. 

With just four rounds remaining, Harikrishna took his tally to an extremely impressive 6.5 points out of a possible 7 with his sixth victory in the tournament. Following him is Chinese GM Bu Xiangzhi, who drew with compatriot Zhang Zhong. 

Earlier in the day, Harikrishnas dream run was halted by Yue in the sixth round. Playing white, Yue adopted a rather safe approach. After the early trading of queens in one of the main lines of the opening set-up, Harikrishna had a comfortable position on board for sometime but jitters came along when Yue got his rook penetrated to the seventh rank. 

However, correct planning by the Indian led to series of exchange leading to a bishop and pawns endgame with no chances for both players. The game lasted 64 moves. (PTI)

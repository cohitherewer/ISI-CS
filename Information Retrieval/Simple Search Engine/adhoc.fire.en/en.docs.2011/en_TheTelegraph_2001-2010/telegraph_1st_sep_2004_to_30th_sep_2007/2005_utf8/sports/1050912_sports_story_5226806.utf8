 Aussies get death threats

 London: Australian cricketers 

 have received death threats via e-mail during their Ashes 

 tour. 

A spokesman for the Metropolitan police informed on Sunday that officers had arrested a 32-year-old man on Friday in Stoke-on-Trent in Northern England in connection with an allegation of making threats to kill. 

It appears the Australian cricket team was the target, the spokesman said. 

The police have released the man on bail, ordering him to return to a local police station on October 27. The man wasnt booked under any offence. 

No details regarding the threats were given except that officers from the computer crime unit were leading the investigation. 

 A Cricket Australia (CA) spokesman, speaking on conditions 

 of anonymity, said that the threats were sent at a generic 

 e-mail address.

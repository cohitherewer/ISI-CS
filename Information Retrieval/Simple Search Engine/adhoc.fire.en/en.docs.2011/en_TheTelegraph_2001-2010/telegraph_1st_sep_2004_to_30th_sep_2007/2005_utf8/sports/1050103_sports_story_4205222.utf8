Sydney: Pakistan lost eight wickets for just 87 runs to slump to 292 for nine and squander a brilliant start by Salman Butt and Yasir Hameed on the opening day of the third and final Test with Australia on Sunday. 

Butt celebrated his maiden Test hundred with a fine 108 while Yasir blazed 58. 

However, their efforts were wasted when the tourists? batting crumbled yet again as it did in the previous two Tests which ended in heavy defeats. 

Recalled leg-spinner Stuart MacGill captured five wickets while in-form paceman Glenn McGrath bagged three to leave the world champions in a strong position when play ended early at the Sydney Cricket Ground because of bad light. 

?I was pretty nervous today. I haven?t played for a long time and I didn?t start the way I wanted to but things got better,? MacGill said. 

Butt and Yasir put on 102 for the opening stand and Butt also shared a 91-run partnership with Younis Khan to help the tourists race to 193 for one when the wheels suddenly fell off. 

Younis departed for 46 when he drove MacGill straight to McGrath at mid-off, triggering a collapse that included the loss of three wickets in seven balls without any addition to the scoreboard. 

MacGill, playing his first Test in nine months after he pulled out of Australia?s tour of Zimbabwe last year on moral grounds, ripped through the opposition to finish the day with five for 87. 

McGrath, who took career-best figures of eight for 24 in the first Test in Perth, claimed three for 38 including two wickets in one over while Shane Warne took one for 84. 

With the team ravaged by injury, Pakistan were not expected to provide much opposition for the Australians but they defied the odds during the first two sessions with a determined display, albeit with a little bit of help from the Australians. 

Yasir could not believe his good fortune when he was dropped on successive balls in the second over of the day from paceman Jason Gillespie. Warne spilled a straightforward chance at first slip off Gillespie?s third delivery and then wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist failed to hold a thick edge off the next ball. 

Yasir made the most of his let-off. He struck six boundaries and hooked Australian debutant Shane Watson for six to reach 54 at lunch. He was dropped again on 56 but his luck eventually ran out on 58 when he top-edged a sweep from Warne to Michael Clarke with the total on 102.Butt was initially less aggressive than his partner but raised the tempo after lunch. 

He brought up his second half-century of the series with a boundary off MacGill and then reached his first Test hundred with a four off Warne, celebrating his achievement by kissing the pitch.

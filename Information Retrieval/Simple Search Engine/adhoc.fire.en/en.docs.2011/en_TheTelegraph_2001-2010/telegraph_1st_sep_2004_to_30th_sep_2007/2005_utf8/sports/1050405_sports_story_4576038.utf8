 Injury-time goal saves Barcelona

 - EURO ROUND-UP - Owen scores his 10th as Real beat Albacete 2-1 

 Real Madrid?s Michael Owen celebrates his goal against Albacete at Carlos Belmonte Stadium on Sunday 

Madrid: Giovanni van Bronckhorst scored an injury-time equaliser to earn FC Barcelona a 3-3 draw with 10-man Real Betis in the Spanish League, while West Brom and Fulham both won and improved their chances of staying in the Premier League next season. That was a day of soccer action in which all Serie A matches were postponed out of respect for the Pontiff?s death. 

Van Bronckhorst, who replaced midfielder Xavi Hernandez in the 76th minute Sunday, equalised in the fifth minute of injury time when he seized on a long pass by Portugal midfielder Deco and lifted the ball over goalkeeper Toni Doblas. 

Samuel Eto?o, the league?s leading scorer with 20 goals, twice scored from the penalty spot to help Barcelona rally back from a two-goal deficit. 

Joaquin Sanchez scored two goals and Ricardo Oliveira added the other for Betis, which had central defender David Rivas ejected in the 14th minute. 

?We didn?t play well but we gained a point,? Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard said of the draw which extended the team?s unbeaten run to eight games. ?We showed team spirit. You need that to change a result which looked negative.? 

Later Sunday, Real Madrid beat hosts Albacete 2-1 and cut Barcelona?s lead in the standings to nine points. 

Ivan Helguera and Michael Owen scored for Madrid, who can move closer to their rivals next Sunday when they host Barcelona. 

All Spanish League games were marked by tributes to Pope John Paul II, who died Saturday night. A moment of silence was observed at some stadiums, while music was heard and prayers were said at others. Some teams wore black armbands. 

In other important matches Sunday Sevilla beat Numancia 1-0, Espanyol beat Racing Santander 3-1; Deportivo la Coruna beat Levante 1-0 and Atletico Madrid beat Mallorca 4-0. 

Barcelona have 69 points, followed by Real Madrid with 60. Villarreal are next with 50 and a game in hand. Betis, Espanyol and Sevilla have 49 each, two more than Valencia. 

Madrid, who played without the injured David Beckham and suspended Zinedine Zidane, beat Albacete 6-1 last November but found their 19th-placed rival much tougher this time. 

Albacete took the lead in the ninth minute when midfielder Pablo Redondo fired a shot which first went through the legs of defenders Walter Samuel and Helguera and then goalkeeper Iker Casillas. 

Madrid levelled six minutes later when Helguera soared to head home Luis Figo?s corner from the right. 

Owen, who replaced Raul Gonzalez in the starting line-up, fired Madrid?s winner on the stroke of halftime after a forceful run by midfielder Jose Maria ?Guti? Gutierrez. 

The goal was the England striker?s 10th in the league this season. 

West Brom defeated Everton 1-0 and Fulham beat Portsmouth 3-1 Sunday, important victories for teams fighting relegation. 

Zoltan Gera drove home an 8m header in the 63rd minute for West Brom, giving the Baggies 27 points along with Southampton and moving them into 18th place. Southampton have the edge on goal difference. Norwich remained last in the 20-team Premier League with 20 points, six behind Crystal Palace. Portsmouth are in 16th with 31 points, and Fulham and Blackburn have 33 each. The last three teams are relegated. 

In the other game Sunday, late goals from Brian McBride and Luis Boa Morte lifted Fulham past Portsmouth. 

Mcbride, a US international who returned from North America late this week after duty for World Cup qualifiers against Mexico and Guatemala, scored in the 81st and Boa Morte added the clincher for the London club in second-half injury time. 

Lomana Lualua gave Portsmouth a 1-0 lead in the 32nd, but Andy Cole equalised in the 63rd and set the stage for the two late goals. 

At the top of the Premier League, Chelsea lead with 80 points, followed by Arsenal and Manchester United with 67 each. Everton have 51 points and Liverpool 50.

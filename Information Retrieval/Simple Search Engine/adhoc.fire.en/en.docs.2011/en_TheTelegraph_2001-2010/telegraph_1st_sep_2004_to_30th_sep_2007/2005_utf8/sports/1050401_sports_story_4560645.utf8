 Victory reunites friends 

 - Former Pakistan captains congratulate Inzamam 

Inzamam

Karachi: A great victory not only unites the team further but even repairs the severely dented and crippled relations between the best of friends. 

The most recent example of reunion with friends was when Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq received a surprise telephone call from former captain Rashid Latif who last year during the home series against India had accused the team of throwing the fourth one-day International. 

?I tried calling him several times after that to tell him I was sorry about what had happened and that I had made a big mistake. I spoke to him once last year when he was in Holland but it was just a brief hello and he was very cold,? Latif was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. 

?(But after Bangalore victory), I got his number from the team?s assistant manager and called him. This time he received the call properly and the first thing I told him was congratulations, you have proved us all wrong and made us proud.? 

The relationship between the two had touched rocked bottom 12 months ago when Latif?s allegations of match-fixing had annoyed Inzamam to an extent that he and three other senior cricketers had threatened to skip the Test series if the PCB didn?t initiate legal action against Latif. 

The matter was, however, hushed up but Inzamam never spoke to Latif. 

?Inzamam then spoke in his normal manner and for the first time in a year we discussed and cleared up a lot of things. I told him he is in fine form but his foot still keeps falling across,? Latif said. 

?He (Inzamam) said that is an old problem and why bother about it after scoring so many runs in international cricket. We laughed and joked and he finally told me he would like to see me in New Delhi next month in the final one-day International,? Latif, who was succeeded by Inzamam as Pakistan captain in November 2003, said. 

Latif was not the only one who patched up with the Pakistan captain. Waqar Younis, Inzamam?s childhood friend, also telephoned and congratulated him. 

Waqar had not telephoned him until Tuesday because he was unhappy with Inzamam for not helping him get the bowling coach?s job. 

But on Tuesday, he telephoned Inzamam and cleared the air, local media reported. (PTI)

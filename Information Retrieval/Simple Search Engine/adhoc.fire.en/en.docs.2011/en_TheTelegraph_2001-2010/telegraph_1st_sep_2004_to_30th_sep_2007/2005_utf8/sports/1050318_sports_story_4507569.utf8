The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Inzamam in portrait 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

 ?Chacha? cheers at the Eden on Thursday 

This is the story of a unique fan-cum-painter. If you approach this shy young man, he?ll quietly introduce himself as Ramzan. But his portraits of famous cricketers are not uncommon to players whenever any international match takes place at the Eden. 

During the Test against South Africa here, he gave a portrait of Graeme Smith to the visiting team?s captain. Smith?s Pakistani counterpart, Inzamam-ul Haq was also presented with the same at the team hotel on Thursday. 

Inzy smilingly accepted the wooden frame from Ramzan and even said a few words in praise of his artistry. 

 Meanwhile, an artisan from Kumartuli created a full-size 

 figure of the Pakistan captain in clay. 

 A pat for the Eden crowd

 The hospitality of Eden Gardens crowd has absolutely 

 bowled over the globe-trotting Pakistani supporter Abdul 

 Jalil. 

?It was a remarkable experience. The crowd here is so loving that I am moved by their reception,? Jalil, who has been travelling with the Pakistan team since 1981, said on Thursday. 

Jalil, popularly known as Chacha, however, felt that if Pakistan manage to take a considerable lead in the first innings, they might be in a position to win the Test. 

Meanwhile, the Eden received another Pakistan fan, Akhtar Khan, on Thursday. The Karachi based businessman was a guest of a city dweller, who befriended with Akhtar during the Karachi ODI between Pakistan and India last year.

London: English Premier League champions Chelsea have a score to settle against reigning European champions Liverpool in Wednesdays Champions League match at Anfield. 

The seven straight wins with which Chelsea have started this Premiership season has not eased the pain over last seasons Champions League semi-final defeat at the hands of the Merseysiders. 

Meanwhile, Spaniard Nacho Novo has been ruled out of Rangers trip to Inter Milan and other big matches include 2003 winners AC Milan at Germanys Schalke 04, Real Madrid hosting Olympiakos and 2004 champions Porto against FC Bratislava. 

Blues skipper John Terry made no bones about the fact that he will lead his side north to Liverpool with a score to settle. 

Terry was left distraught when a highly controversial goal from Luis Garcia secured Liverpools place in the final, the England defender having been convinced that the ball had not crossed the line. 

Terry reflected the mood among Chelsea players earlier this month when he remarked: It was a terrible night with bad memories for everybody. This will be our chance to get revenge. 

The theme was taken up by teammate Frank Lampard, whose goal helped Chelsea get this seasons campaign in Europe off to a winning start at the expense of Belgian outfit Anderlecht. 

There will be an added dimension to the game, he warned. We all know what happened last season and we want to put it right. 

The hype surrounding the match has been all about Chelsea taking revenge for last terms defeat by Liverpool that sent Rafael Benitezs men to Istanbul. 

But boss Benitez and fellow Spaniard Xabi Alonso have made it clear that Liverpool do not fear the English champions. 

Benitez, whose own side have lost just once in 16 league, European and friendly matches since winning the European Cup last May, said: Chelsea are not unbeatable. 

We have beaten them before and we can beat them again. They are a better team than they were last year but were a better team as well. 

Rangers manager Alex McLeish must do without the clubs top-scorer Novo for the group H tie against Inter Milan after he limped off midway through the 0-1 defeat at Hearts on Saturday with an ankle injury. 

McLeish said: Losing Nacho was really disappointing because we felt he could get in behind Hearts and cause them trouble. He is out of the Inter game now and that is another disappointment. 

Last seasons finalists AC Milan hope to get an early stranglehold on Champions League group E when they travel to German side Schalke 04 on Wednesday. 

Milan ran out 3-1 winners over Fenerbahce in their opening match and another three points would see the six-time European champions live up to their billing as group favourites. 

We travel to Gelsenkirchen with the right focus, said Milans Ukraine international striker Andriy Shevchenko. If we go in with no fear we can win. 

Real Madrids midfield maestro Zinedine Zidane may be fit for Wednesdays group F home game against Greeks Olympiakos after being out of action for the last three weeks. 

Zidane ripped his right adductor muscle in Frances 1-0 World Cup qualifying victory over republic of Ireland on September 7, but according to Madrid club doctors he could be available for selection.

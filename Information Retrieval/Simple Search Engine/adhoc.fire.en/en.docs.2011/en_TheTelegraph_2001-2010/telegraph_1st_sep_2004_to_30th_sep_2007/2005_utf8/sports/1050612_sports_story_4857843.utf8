 Brilliant start by Anand

 - LEON MEET 

 Kasimdzhanov too good for Shirov, enters final 

 Viswanathan Anand beat Carlsen in 30 moves 

Leon: Viswanathan Anand scored a fluent victory over Magnus Carlsen of Norway taking an early lead in the second semi-final of the 18th Magistral Ciudad de Leon chess tournament here. 

It turned out to be another mismatch with a twist in the tale as the world rapid champion Anand, gave no chance to his 14-year old opponent forcing a victory in just 30 moves. 

The event that is being played on a knockout basis has already seen Fide champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov emerge as a finalist after he beat Spaniard Alexei Shirov in a one-sided contest on Friday. 

Kasimdzhanov had won both his black games to knockout Shirov by a 3-1 margin in the four-match game. 

While Anand still has to play his remaining three games in the match against Carlsen, in all likelihood he is going to be the other finalist of this rapid event to cross sword with Kasimdzhanov in the final slated for Sunday. 

Carlsen backed the Petroff defence and was in for a surprise as Anand did not employ the in-vogue variation. 

The Indian ace played the opening in copy book fashion, exchanging pieces at will after Carlsen sacrificed a pawn and reached an endgame almost in a jiffy. 

The final position saw Anand sacrificing his rook for a knight to march his pawn to glory. 

Kasimdzhanov put up a splendid show to beat Shirov in the first semi-final. he drew the inconsequential fourth game. 

It turned out to be a dramatic first day in the three-day rapid event as local hope and favourite Shirov just could not get going. The Latvia-born Spaniard was a pale shadow of himself right from the word go as he lost the first and the third game with white pieces and drew the remaining two to bow out of the event. 

Kasimdzhanovs big achievement is the Fide world championship title he won last year in Tripoli. There, too, the Uzbek was at his best in tackling the shorter time control games. The time control here is for the fittest ? 20 moves for the entire game with a ten-second increment after every move is made. 

The dice was cast when Shirov could not match the attacking skills of Kasimdzhanov in the first game. Starting off with the Sicilian Nazdorf as black, Kasimdzhanov rolled his queenside pawns in the English attack and won Shirovs queen for little compensation. 

A further tactical melee resulted in some sharp play by both sides but Kasimdzhanov forced resignation after 41 moves. 

I wanted to try my new preparation against a sharp player like Shirov and I am pleased that it succeeded, Kasimdzhanov said. 

The second game was drawn..The next game was another delight for the spectators as Shirov threw everything at Kasimdzhanovs king but found his opponent well-armed. (PTI)

 New Delhi: Grandmaster Koneru Humpy annexed the North Urals Cup women?s chess tournament in Krasnoturinsk, Russia. The top seed played out an easy draw with WGM Natalia Zhukova of Ukraine to score six points out of a possible nine, according to information received here on Thursday.

 Humpy was the only player to go undefeated in the 10-player double round-robin event.

 Beijing: The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will send an inspection team to the 10th National Games of China, hosts of the 2008 Olympic Games, in October, media reports said on Thursday.

 An official of the State Sports Administration of China said the team would be headed by Wada chief Dick Pound. The Chinese Olympic Committee will increase dope tests at the National Games by more than 20 per cent. HGH (human growth hormone) will also be tested for the first time.

 Bangalore: It would indeed be a trip down memory lane for former All England champion Prakash Padukone as he catches up with some of the former stalwarts of the sport at a ?Legends Badminton Masters Reunion? in Jakarta this weekend.

 Stars of yesteryear are slated to play exhibition matches on July 16, a day before the final of the Asian junior badminton championships, and Padukone is pitted against Lie Sumirat of Indonesia, a former Thomas Cup player.

 Madrid: Real Madrid included Luis Figo in their squad for a pre-season tour of the US and Asia, which kicks off in Chicago on Saturday. However, Real Madrid vice-president Emilio Butragueno said on Wednesday that Figo?s future with the club was still ?up in the air.?

 Liverpool want to sign the 32-year-old, who has one more year on his Real Madrid contract, but are stalling over Real?s demand for a transfer fee. Inter Milan are also interested in him.

 Rio de Janeiro: Romario has denied reports that he has effectively taken over the coach?s role at Vasco da Gama from Dario Lourenco. Brazilian newspaper reports on Wednesday said Romario had given a team-talk and then picked the two teams at a training session earlier this week, while Lourenco remained silent on the sidelines with his back to the pitch. But the 39-year-old said he was merely performing his role as captain of the struggling team.

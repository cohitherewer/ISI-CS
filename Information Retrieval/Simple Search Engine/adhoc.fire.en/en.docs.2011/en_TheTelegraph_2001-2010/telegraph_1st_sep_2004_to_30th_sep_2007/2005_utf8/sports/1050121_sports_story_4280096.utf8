 United survive a scare

 Cristiano Ronaldo drew first blood 

London: Holders Manchester United were given an FA Cup fright before beating minor league Exeter City 2-0 in a nervy third round replay on Wednesday. 

Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo scored after nine minutes but the Conference side put United under pressure midway through the second half and had a potential equaliser disallowed before England striker Wayne Rooney killed the tie in the 87th minute. 

United, whose second string side were held to a shock 0-0 draw at Old Trafford on January 8, lined up an all-Premier League fourth round tie at home to Middlesbrough. 

Two other Premier League clubs made it through their replays against second division opponents, with Fulham beating Watford 2-0 and Blackburn Rovers seeing off Cardiff City 3-2. 

Fulham?s reward is a tie at second division Derby County on January 29, while Blackburn host third division Colchester United. 

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson paid tribute to plucky Exeter after it took two of the best players at Euro 2004 to see off the minor league team. 

?It?s just a great reminder of the romance of the FA Cup,? he said. 

As for the game at St James? Park, he said: ?They kept us hemmed in our own half, with the wind and the crowd behind them, and there was a lot going for them in the second half.? 

The comfortable scoreline belied the fact that United had to scrap for their win in the blustery conditions. (Reuters)

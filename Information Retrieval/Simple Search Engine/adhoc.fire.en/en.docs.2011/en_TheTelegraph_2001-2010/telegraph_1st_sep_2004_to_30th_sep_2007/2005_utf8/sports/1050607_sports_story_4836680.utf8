Bridgetown: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq scored his 22nd Test hundred against the West Indies in Kingston on Monday to leave the second and final Test wide open. 

The 35-year-old hit an undefeated 115 to keep his teams chances of squaring the two-match series alive by guiding them to 307 for nine at lunch on Day IV. 

Pakistan lead by 277 runs despite a career best four-wicket spell from fast bowler Tino Best. 

Best, who had bowled inconsistently and without luck earlier in the match, came back strongly in the morning session. 

He took the wickets of Shahid Afridi (43), Abdul Razzaq (2), Kamran Akmal (1) and Shabbir Ahmed (0) to reduce Pakistan from 267 for four to 280 for eight. 

Pakistan lost four wickets in 33 balls for just 13 runs but Inzamam stood firm with his fourth hundred against the West Indies. 

Resuming on 223 for four, Inzamam continued to make the home side suffer for dropping him off the first ball he faced on Sunday from Corey Collymore, reaching his century from 164 balls with 12 fours. 

It was also Inzamams second successive hundred following the 167 against India in Bangalore in March in his 100th match. 

Suspended for the first Test in Barbados for excessive appealing by his team in the Test in Bangalore in April, Inzamam resumed on 64 and batted with relative authority on a pitch with variable bounce. 

His only blemish came when on 92 he was caught behind by Courtney Browne off Reon King off a no-ball. 

He put on 73 valuable runs with fellow overnight batsman Afridi, who hit the first ball of the day for a six. 

Best had Afridi caught at mid wicket by Devon Smith and then bowled Razzaq with an in-swinger. 

He had Akmal caught behind by Browne and bowled Shabbir to finish with four for 44. 

King bowled Naved-ul Hasan Rana for nought off an inside edge in between. 

The highest run chase at Kingstons Sabina Park has been the 212 for three made by the home side against Sri Lanka in 2003 to win the match. 

Earlier, Pakistan reached 223 for four at close of Day III, 193 runs ahead of the home side, despite brilliant bowling from pacer Corey Collymore who has taken 10 for 114 in the match inKingston. 

Collymore became the first West Indian bowler to take 10 wickets in a match since Cour-tney Walsh took 10 for 117 aga-inst England at Lords in 2000.

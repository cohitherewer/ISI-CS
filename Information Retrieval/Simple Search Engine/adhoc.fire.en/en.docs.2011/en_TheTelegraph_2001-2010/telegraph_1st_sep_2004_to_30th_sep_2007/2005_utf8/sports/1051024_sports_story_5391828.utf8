 Warne better join queue: Ponting

 - AUSSIE CAPTAINCY 

 Ponting says he is firmly in control 

Sydney: Ricky Ponting has defiantly told would-be suitors to his Test captaincy that hes staying put and not going anywhere. 

Ponting, who along with team coach John Buchanan received most of the fall-out from Australias relinquishing of the Ashes to England last month, says he is running the show and intends to remain captain. 

Ponting has denied champion legspinner Shane Warne virtually ran the team in England, and responded to calls for Warne to become Test captain following the loss of the Ashes. 

There was only one person in charge on the field and that was me, Ponting wrote in his soon-to-be-released book, Ashes Diary 2005. 

If he does still have captaincy aspirations he had better join the queue, because I am not planning on going anywhere just yet. 

Ponting also admitted in his new book that he initially wanted Andrew Symonds sent home after a late-night drinking binge forced him out of the one-day match against Bangladesh in Cardiff last June. 

Bangladesh stunned the cricket world when they beat the Australians by five wickets, winning only their 10th match in 108 one-day Internationals at the time. 

Ponting described the defeat as dreadful and embarrassing, and allrounder Symonds behaviour as unacceptable after it became clear during the warm-ups that he was intoxicated. 

When Gilchrist and I got to Symonds, I did not beat around the bush, Ponting writes. His eyes looked puffy and I could smell alcohol on his breath. Were you out late last night having a drink? I said. Yes, he replied. what time did you get back? I responded. About 1.30, I think. 

Given the state he was in eight hours after that, I found his claim hard to believe. My blood was beginning to boil. I did not shout, but let Symonds know exactly what I thought about his behaviour. (AFP)

 Tolly coach rues missing win

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami coach Biswajit Das said on Monday that a win against Sporting Clube de Goa would have been a perfect gift to East Bengal. 

?I would have been happier if my team had won the match. That would also put East Bengal on a more advantageous position,? Das said after the match. 

?Everybody played as a unit and contributed to the result. I know it would help my own cause little, but I can take heart from the fact that another team from Bengal (East Bengal) has an advantage now (in the title-hunt),? Das pointed out. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukwuma saw a conspiracy against his team. ?Tollygunge, on the advice of another club (an obvious reference to East Bengal), targeted my key players. I had to take off Joseph Pereira and Chidi Edeh because they were constantly being nagged from behind and received injury,? he added.

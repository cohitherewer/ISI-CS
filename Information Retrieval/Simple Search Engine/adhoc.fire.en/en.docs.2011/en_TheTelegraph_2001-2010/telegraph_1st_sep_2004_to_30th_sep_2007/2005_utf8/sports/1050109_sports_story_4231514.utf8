 Second loss for Barua

 Sasikiran has Kunte joining up at top 

New Delhi: Former national champion Dibyendu Barua?s bad run continued as he succumbed to his second defeat in the eighth round of the Parsvnath international open chess tournament here Saturday. 

GM Dmitry Kayumov of Uzbekistan also joined Barua in the casualty list in the morning session even as GM Abhijit Kunte, after a relatively slow start to his campaign, joined top seed GM Krishna Sasikiran in the lead at the Bapu Samaj Seva Kendra here. 

While Barua was made to bite the dust by Mehdi Hasan of Bangladesh, K Ratnakaran got the better of Kayumov to take his points tally to 6.5 from a possible eight. 

Barua, who suffered his second loss, is languishing in joint fifth place with merely five points from eight outings, with four wins and two draws and is almost out of the title race. 

Former title holder R B Ramesh defeated IM R R Laxman to move into joint second position with Ratnakaran, IM Saptarshi Roy and N Sanjay of Karnataka with 6.5 points while GM Alexander Fominyh of Uzbekistan was among the pack of players on third spot with six points each with only three rounds remaining in the 11-round event. 

Ratnakaran, who has one GM-norm, employed Guico Piano opening with white pieces but despite an unclear middle game he gained advantage by sacrificing an exchange in the 39th move. With a strong King side positioning in the end game Ratnakar pulled the win in 53 moves. 

On the top board, Kunte beat IM Deep Sengupta in an English attack with black pieces. Deep paid for his blunders as he lost the match in 30 moves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Japan clubs shocked

Tokyo: Japan?s Yokohama F-Marinos and Jubilo Iwata suffered 0-1 defeats to Chinese opponents in their opening Asian Champions League games on Wednesday while South Korea?s Suwon Bluewings and Pusan I-Park posted crushing wins. 

Japanese teams failed to go beyond group stages in the first two years of Asia?s most prestigious competition and Yokohama and Jubilo did little to suggest they can reverse the trend. 

China?s Shandong Luneng upset J-League champions Yokohama thanks to a 68th-minute strike from Gao Yao at Mitsuzawa stadium. 

Visiting Shandong had China midfielder Zheng Zhi sent off in the 80th for a second bookable offence but they still comfortably hung on to win their group F opener. 

Indonesia?s PSM Makassar beat Thailand?s BEC Tero 1-0 in Bangkok to go joint top of group F with Shandong. 

Jubilo were beaten away by Chinese champions Shenzhen Jianlibao in group E.

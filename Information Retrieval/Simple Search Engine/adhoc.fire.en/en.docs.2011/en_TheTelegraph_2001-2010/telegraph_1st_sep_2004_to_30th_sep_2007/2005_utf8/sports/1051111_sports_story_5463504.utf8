 Federer plays down chances

 - ATP Masters Cup 

 For Roger Federer, health comes before success 

Shanghai: World number one Roger Federer is doubtful over his chances of successfully defending the Masters Cup title in Shanghai owing to an ankle injury sustained last month. 

To be honest, I dont know my chances of winning the tournament here because of my foot, a Chinese newspaper on Thursday quoted Federer, in Shanghai for the season-ending tournament beginning on Sunday, as saying. 

Definitely, Im here trying to defend my title but health comes before success. So now I just hope I can play the opening game without any pain. 

The Swiss superstar sustained the injury while practising four weeks ago and was forced to skip the Madrid and Paris Masters as well as the Basel tournament last week. 

Despite playing down his chances, Federers recovery has been fairly quick, which could spell bad news for his rivals in the eight man-field at the $4.45 million tournament at the brand new Qi Zhong Stadium. 

Injuries have forced the withdrawal of some of the biggest names for Shanghai, which gathers the top eight players for the season. (AFP)

 Marshall hits maiden century

 Hamish Marshall 

Christchurch: Hamish Marshall scored his maiden Test hundred and Craig Cumming hit a half-century on debut to help New Zealand pile on 265 for three on Day I of the first Test against Australia here on Thursday. 

Marshall, appearing in only his third Test, struck 14 fours and a six in an unbeaten 103 to put New Zealand in a strong position after they were thrashed 0-5 by the world champions in the one-day series. 

?It was pretty tough. I?m pretty tired now and feeling a little bit jaded,? said 26-year-old Marshall, who had scored just one first-class hundred in nearly seven years as a professional cricketer. ?But I loved every moment of it, I wouldn?t chuck it away for anything.? 

Marshall shared a 97-run partnership for the second wicket with Cumming, who repaid the selectors for promoting him to the Test side with a patient 74 after captain Stephen Fleming had gone for 18 before lunch. New Zealand also lost Lou Vincent for 27 after tea but Nathan Astle made 29 not out in an unbroken stand of 66 with Marshall to give his side the upper hand at stumps. 

Shane Warne, paceman Michael Kasprowicz and part-time spinner Michael Clarke captured a wicket each for Australia, who surprisingly left out quick bowler Brett Lee then handed the opposition first use of a placid Jade Stadium pitch after winning the toss. Australia could have been in a better position but let themselves down with two catches going down off McGrath?s bowling. (REUTERS)

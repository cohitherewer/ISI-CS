 Juventus lead pared 

 Paolo Di Canio 

Milan: Lazio enjoyed a 3-1 derby win over AS Roma with Paolo Di Canio on target as coach Giuseppe Papadopulo made a winning debut in Serie A on Thursday. 

Juventus, who were held 1-1 at Parma, led through a 64th minute header from Swedish forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic before Marco Marchionni?s 85th minute goal ensured Fabio Capello?s side?s lead at the top was cut to just two points as they moved on to 40 points. 

Third-placed Udinese suffered a 0-2 defeat at Sampdoria, leaving them nine points adrift of Juve, while Inter Milan won 2-0 at Livorno to stay fourth. 

Juventus looked to have picked up a win after Ibrahimovic headed home a cross from Mauro Camoranesi. But with five minutes left, Juve defender Paolo Montero?s miskick let in Marchionni, blasted in the equaliser. 

Meanwhile, Argentine striker Hernan Crespo hit a hattrick as AC Milan beat Lecce 5-2 to move within two points of leaders Juventus.

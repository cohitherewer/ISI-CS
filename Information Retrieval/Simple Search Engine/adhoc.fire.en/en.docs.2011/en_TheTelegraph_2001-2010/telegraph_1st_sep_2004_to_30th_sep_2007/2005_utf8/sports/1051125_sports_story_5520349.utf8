 Observer circular on BCCI polls

New Delhi: The observer to the BCCI elections issued a circular on Thursday, which formulates the guidelines for the contest, making it free for any one to contest from any association. 

The ruling, by former election commissioner T. S. Krishnamurthy who has been appointed as observer to the elections to be held on November 29 and 30, would be a boost for Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) chief and Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar who narrowly lost the battle last year while contesting as Punjab Cricket Association nominee. 

Krishnamurthy has also asked Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) as well as the National Cricket Club (NCC) in Calcutta to pass a resolution among them before attending the elections, according to BCCI sources. 

Krishmurthy said that both DDCA and NCC have not conducted elections for the past two and three years respectively, which was against their own constitution. 

It is also understood that the president may no longer have one vote by virtue of being the president and a casting vote too. Instead he may have just one vote. 

Krishnamurthy also declared that Bihar and Rajasthan had the right to vote, the sources said. 

The right to vote for Bihar means a no for Jharkhand. 

The sources said former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya had disaffiliated Bihar, who have been a member of the board since 1945, on the flimsy ground that Jamshedpur, where it was headquartered, lay in the newly formed state of Jharkhand after the bifurcation of states. (AGENCIES)

 Tait, Hogg out with injuries

Melbourne: Australian pace bowler Shaun Tait and allrounder Brad Hogg have been ruled out of Australias squads for the one-day International Super Series against the World XI with injuries, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Monday. 

Tait tore a cartilage in his shoulder, CA said in a statement, while Hogg has damaged a cartilage in his knee. Both will undergo surgery this week. 

Tait, who is expected to be out of action for three months, has been replaced by fast bowler Stuart Clark, while Victoria state captain Cameron White will join the one-day squad to replace Hogg, Australian captain Ricky Ponting said. 

Brads just been ruled out today with a knee injury, Ponting said. I think, from all reports, that hell probably have to have an operation pretty soon as well, which is bad news for him and I guess its a bit of setback for the team. 

Cameron White will come into the squad and will probably play as well. Theres a good opportunity there for an up-and-coming leg spin bowler to play some cricket for Australia. With a negative there always comes a positive and thats the positive. 

Tait, 22, who made a promising Test debut against England on the recent Ashes tour, was also ruled out of the six-day Super Test in Sydney from October 14-19. 

Clark was called into the Australian squad during the Ashes series as cover for Glenn McGrath, but didnt play. White, 22, has been groomed for international cricket for several seasons and has been captain of Victoria since he was 20. 

Meanwhile, Australias chastened cricket team on Monday summoned American baseball coach Mike Young to help rid them of the fielding fumbles that blighted their Ashes campaign against England. 

Young, who once managed the Australian national baseball team, has worked with the Australian one-day cricket team for five years. He conducted fielding drills during the teams training on Monday. (AGENCIES)

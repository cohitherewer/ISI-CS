Le Mans: Valentino Rossi extended his domination of MotoGP racing on Sunday with victory in the French Grand Prix. 

The world champion made it three wins out of four races by narrowly beating Honda rider Sete Gibernau into second place at the Le Mans track. 

Rossi has moved on to 95 points in the overall standings with compatriot Marco Melandri on 58 and Gibernau on 53. 

The 26-year-Italian, chasing a fifth world title in the premier class, seized the lead on his Yamaha with just over seven laps remaining in a race held in cloudy but dry weather. 

Spaniard Gibernau, winner here for the past two years, failed to become the first rider with three Le Mans wins in the showcase category. 

Gibernau threatened until the last few bends but Rossi showed his class under pressure, beating the circuit record in the last lap. 

Rossis teammate Colin Edwards led for most of the race but the American had to be content with third place, his first podium finish this season. 

Setting off from pole position, Rossi, who won in Le Mans in 2002 but has often struggled on what is not his favourite track, had a poor start. 

He was in sixth position for the first few laps but soon worked his way up the field and was second just behind Edwards after eight laps. 

Brazilian Alex Barros, the only man to have beaten Rossi this season with victory in Portugal, crashed out on his Honda with 15 laps remaining. 

In the 250cc class, Spains Daniel Pedrosa captured the lead in the world championship standings with a dramatic victory. 

Swiss teenager Thomas Luthi recorded his first victory with a commanding performance in the 125cc race. The 18-year-old Honda rider, starting from pole position for the first time, led from start to finish.

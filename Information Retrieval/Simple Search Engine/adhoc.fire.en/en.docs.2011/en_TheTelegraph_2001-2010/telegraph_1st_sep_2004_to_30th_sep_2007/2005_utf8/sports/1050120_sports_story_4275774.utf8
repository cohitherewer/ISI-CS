 Traore howler punishes Liverpool 

Henry Winter

On a raw Lancashire night that demanded the presence of men, not boys, Liverpool were deservedly punished for taking the FA Cup lightly and fielding a weakened team. How fitting that this desperately embarrassing defeat should be sealed by an own-goal, an extraordinary one from Djimi Traore. 

To complete Liverpool?s night of ignominy, Antonio Nunez was sent off for elbowing Tony Grant, a former Everton player. Struggling financially, Burnley will celebrate this famous evening long and hard, the score reflecting their 1914 FA Cup final success over Liverpool. 

Steve Cotterill?s men played with pride in their shirt and with an appreciation of the Cup?s traditions, and constantly threatened through the outstanding Richard Chaplow, Jean Louis Valois and Mo Camara as they progressed to a fourth round tie against Bournemouth. 

Following the original weather-induced postponement and an additional 15-minute traffic-related delay, it was no wonder that Cotterill?s neat championship side had been so eager to test the mettle of their Premiership guests. Running hungrily and intelligently across a pitch made playable by intense activity from the Turf Moor ground staff, Burnley took the game to Liverpool, their industry rewarded seven minutes after the break by Traore?s astonishing own-goal. 

How the home fans delighted in the clever movement of Chaplow and the dribbling of Valois. An interval lead would certainly not have flattered Chaplow, Valois and company. Traore?s gift was gratefully accepted. No wonder the visitors? supporters were chanting for Milan Baros. 

Exploiting the lack of understanding inLiverpool Burnley began creating chance after chance.Burnley went for Liverpool again, breaking through after 52 minutes. The danger seemed to have expired when Chaplow crossed low and hard from the left. The opposition presence in the six-yard box was minimal, but Traore panicked, executing a bizarre turn that clipped the ball into Dudek?s net. Embarrassment was writ large.

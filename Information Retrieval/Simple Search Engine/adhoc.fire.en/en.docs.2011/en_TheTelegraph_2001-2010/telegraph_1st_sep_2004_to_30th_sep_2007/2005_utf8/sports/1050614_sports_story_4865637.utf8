 Lanka to play 7 ODIs in India

Colombo: Sri Lanka will play as many as seven one-day Internationals during their tour of India later this year, a cricket official said here Monday. 

We will play seven one-dayers instead of the five that had been planned earlier along with three Test matches, Tryphon Mirando, secretary of the cricket interim committee, said. 

Mirando said that apart from Sri Lankas tour of India in November, they were also likely to visit India for a tri-nation series next year. 

Sri Lanka were originally scheduled for a five-match one-day series in India in April but the tour was called off due to the reluctance of Indian players to take part soon after a gruelling tour by Pakistan. 

Mirando, who visited India over the weekend to discuss the schedule, said the two countries were also planning a series between their A sides. 

Sri Lanka have a packed schedule from July this year to July 2006 during which they will play 15 Test matches and a minimum of 44 one-dayers. 

Sri Lanka will host the West Indies for two tests in July after which India will join them for a tri-series from August 2-14.

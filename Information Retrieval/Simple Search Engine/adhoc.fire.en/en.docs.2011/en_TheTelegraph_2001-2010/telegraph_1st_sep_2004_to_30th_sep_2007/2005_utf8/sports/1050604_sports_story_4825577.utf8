 Bakre in freak accident

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Grandmaster Tejas Bakre, in the city to participate in the rapid chess meet organised by the Chess Players Association of India (CPAI), had to be hospitalised after meeting with a freak accident on Thursday night. 

According to GM Dibyendu Barua, who also happens to be the CPAI president, Bakre tried to scale the railing of the IPS guest house ? where he was put up ? around 12.30 pm as he found the main gate locked. 

He slipped and fell on an iron railing which pierced his stomach, Barua said. 

He got himself admitted to a private nursing home. Though he is still in hospital, he is now out of danger, Barua added. 

Bakre wont be able to take part in the meet.

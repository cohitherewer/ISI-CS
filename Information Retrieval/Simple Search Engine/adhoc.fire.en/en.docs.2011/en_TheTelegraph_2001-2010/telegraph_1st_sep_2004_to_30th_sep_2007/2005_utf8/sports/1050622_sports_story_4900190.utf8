 Only pride at stake for Greece 

Frankfurt: Greece surprised everyone by lifting the Euro 2004 title in Portugal but the European champions are merely playing for pride in the Confederations Cup match here on Wednesday when they face a buoyant Mexico. 

Greece are the only team yet to score in the tournament after losing to Brazil (0-3) and Japan (0-1) while Mexico have already qualified for the semi-finals with a maximum six points. 

Mexico produced the biggest shock of the tournament by defeating world champions Brazil 1-0 in their last group match. 

Its satisfying to see how were growing and able to beat great teams. Were getting better all the time, warned Mexico coach Ricardo Lavolpe. 

In contrast, Greece have been on a downward spiral since Euro 2004 and their German coach King Otto Rehhagel has seen his red carpet swept away. 

I really thought my team would have played better in this tournament, said Rehhagel. After a dreadful tournament Rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 World Cup. We have a very important match against Kazakhstan on September 7. That will be something else, promised Rehhagel. 

While Greek fans are ready to go home, Mexican supporters are dreaming of a repeat of their 1999 success in this competition. That year Mexico also defeated Brazil, winning the final 4-3 in front of their home fans, and a point against Greece would secure top spot in the group B. (AFP)

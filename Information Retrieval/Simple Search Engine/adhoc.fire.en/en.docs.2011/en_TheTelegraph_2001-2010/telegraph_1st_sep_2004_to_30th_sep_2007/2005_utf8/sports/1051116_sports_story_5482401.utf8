Multan: England, chasing 198 to win, lost Marcus Trescothick for five after pace trio Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard bowled Pakistan out for 341 on the fourth day of the first Test on Tuesday. 

At close, England were 24 for one. Andrew Strauss was on seven and Ian Bell on 12 when play was called off nine overs early due to poor light. 

Stand-in captain Trescothick, who scored 193 in the first innings, went cheaply the second time round, dragging a ball from outside the off-stump from Shabbir Ahmed on to his wicket. Strauss and Bell survived some anxious moments as Shoaib Akhtar and Ahmed steamed in on a flat track. 

A thick edge from Strauss fell just wide of keeper Kamran Akmal before Bell hooked Shoaib for a six over fine leg. Strauss also survived a close run-out chance. 

Flintoff (four for 88), Harmison (three for 52) and Hoggard (two for 81) had earlier sliced through the Pakistan second innings to bowl them out in 25.5 overs with the second new ball. 

After opener Salman Butt hit a fine 122 and shared a fourth wicket stand of 135 with captain Inzamam-ul-Haq (72), the home team subsided. 

From 266 for three, Pakistan lost their last seven wickets for 75 on a pitch still good for batting and on which the Flintoff company really bent their backs. 

Hoggard stuck with only his second ball with the new ball when he trapped Inzamam leg before, with the captain offering no shot to an in-dipper. 

Butt, who survived a caught behind on the first ball of the day off a no-ball from Flintoff, went on to complete his second Test hundred on the second ball after lunch, playing Ashley Giles down to fine leg with Pakistan looking comfortable. 

Butt, top-scorer in the first innings with 74, batted for 410 minutes, facing 256 balls, hitting 12 fours in his best Test score before falling to Hoggard, caught behind. 

England allrounder Flintoff said: We knew we had to dry up the runs and we bowled well as a group. 

There was no reverse swing for us and we knew we had to use the new ball effectively because Pakistan could have got away from us. It is good we came back hard and are in a position to win the Test. 

He added: Theres no doubt the bowlers changed the course of the Test and it was a crucial session for us before tea as Butt and Inzamam were batting very well.

 Shock loss for Anand

 - CORSICA MASTERS 

 Anand pocketed 12,000 euros for his second-place finish 

Bastia (France): Unfancied Swiss Grandmaster Vadim Milov shocked five-time champion Viswanathan Anand in the tiebreaker to clinch the Corsica Masters Chess Title here. 

A strong favourite for the title, Anand had won this knockout rapid chess event five times in a row from 2000 to 2004. 

In the final, Milov won the first game before Anand drew parity by winning the next to take the match into tie-breaker. 

The tiebreaker saw Milov get the better of the Indian GM in the two games and clinch the title 3-1. 

The Swiss Grandmaster, rated way below the Indian ace, was richer by 20,000 euros while Anand pocketed 12,000 euros for his second place finish. 

In the semi-finals, Anand drew the first two games against Englishman Michael Adams and took the match into a tie-breaker, which the Indian GM won with both black and white. 

He had earlier beaten Mikhail Gurevich 2-0 in the quarter finals.

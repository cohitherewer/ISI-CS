The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sania must not lose focus 

Serve Volley

 Naresh Kumar

 One of the conclusions of a Harvard 

 case study of the Women?s Tennis Association (WTA) Tour, 

 as reported in the International Herald Tribune was: ?Stars 

 in women?s tennis, unlike most high level corporate employees, 

 have a damagingly short-term perspective, one in which extracting 

 maximum gain in a minimum of time trumps the long-term viability 

 of the enterprise?. The study also concluded that starting 

 from scratch you would be nuts to adopt tennis?s current 

 organisational structure.

 Yet, the hungry youngsters keep 

 coming, like lemmings, drawn into the vortex powered by 

 the existing structure of the game, the promotional endorsements 

 and the irresistible lure of more money. Seldom do you find 

 a day when someone has not pulled out of a tournament due 

 to injury or withdrawn during a match.

 Sania has shown that success 

 at international levels is within reach

 Sania has been pitchforked into 

 this swirling arena. Sucked up by a starving media to fill 

 the vacuum in the slot of a female sporting icon, Sania 

 has been transported into a world of glamour, far beyond 

 her modest achievements. Sania?s youthful fresh looks, with 

 a metallic ring in her voice project an admirably positive 

 attitude.

 Her recent victory over the world 

 No. 6 and reigning US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, 

 has raised the bar of expectancy to an unrealistic high. 

 Sania?s fans, specially the masses, now expect her to pole 

 vault her way to the top. When I asked Vijay Amritraj about 

 Sania he said: ?It is amazing what she has achieved considering 

 the weakness in her serve, volley and poor movement?. He 

 praised her ground shots, specially the lethal forehand 

 and her fighting spirit.

 One is happy to read the reports 

 about the sponsorship millions pouring in but at the same 

 time is concerned about Sania?s future. To achieve her potential 

 she has to continue to work on her weaknesses, and at the 

 same time maintain a level of tournament results acceptable 

 to her sponsors and the public. 

 A few early losses, which are 

 unavoidable, and the loyalty of the adoring but fickle fans 

 will wear thin. While raking in this bonanza, Sania must 

 not lose her focus and ambition to get to the top. Experts 

 can talk about forehands and backhands but there is no plumb 

 line to measure human resolve and a fighting heart. They 

 only come to the fore when pressure puts them into a corner. 

 Sania?s options are to sit comfortably on a pile of money, 

 and live happily ever after, or to believe in herself and 

 push relentlessly to achieve her potential. This is no easy 

 task. 

 If she wants to do it, she has 

 to find the correct balance between Spartan physical training, 

 working on her weaknesses, a wise tournament schedule, meeting 

 her promotional commitments and at the same time perform 

 at a level to keep her sponsors happy. All this is not enough. 

 She must keep herself injury free and not succumb to the 

 burnout syndrome.

 Sania is now participating in 

 a Tier I WTA event in Miami. A Tier I tournament is just 

 one level lower than the Grand Slams, which means it has 

 the strongest possible field. Her statement: ?The ankle 

 is 80% fit, and I have been able to train well? is baffling. 

 Taking on the best in the world with a suspect 80% ankle 

 seems foolhardy. 

 Whether Sania makes it to the 

 top 20 or not, her contribution to the emancipation of women 

 in India will be very significant. 

 In Andhra Pradesh, hoardings with 

 Sania?s picture with the slogan: ?Your daughter may be the 

 next champion? send hopes skyrocketing. While wishing her 

 well, one hopes that these are not soap bubbles drifting 

 in the wind.

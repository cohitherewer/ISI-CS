 Railways hope to make most of depleted Punjab 

 Mongia assisted Punjab teammates at nets on Tuesday 

Mohali: Railways hope to cash in on the absence of key players in their opponents? camp when they take on Punjab in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group final, starting Wednesday. 

Punjab will be missing the services of regular captain Dinesh Mongia, Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh ? all on national duty for the one dayers against Pakistan ? and the visitors will surely try and make most of the opportunity. 

In absence of Mongia, who was present to assist his team members at the nets on Tuesday, wicketkeeper Pankaj Dharmani would be in charge of the side. 

Railways, playing in their third final in five years, have a relatively full strength squad since only left-arm spinner Murali Kartik, also selected in the Indian squad, will be missing. 

But Railways have a good new ball attack in Harvinder 

Singh, J.P. Yadav and captain Sanjay Bangar and if they bowl to their potential 

on the lively track here they would surely cause problems for the hosts.

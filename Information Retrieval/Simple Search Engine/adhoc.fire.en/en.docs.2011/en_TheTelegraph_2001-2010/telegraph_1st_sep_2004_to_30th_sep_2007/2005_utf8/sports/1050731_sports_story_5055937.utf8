 Overtaking virtually impossible at 

 Hungaroring

My last race in Germany, at the 

 Hockeinheim circuit, was eventful. But, the important thing 

 was that we managed to bring both cars home. It was a circuit 

 where I had never raced before, but I managed to get a grip 

 of it quickly. It was good to finish in Germany after having 

 failed in the earlier races. I managed to finish ahead of 

 my teammate Tiago Monteiro who also had a very eventful 

 race.

 The Hungaroring circuit is another 

 where I have never raced before. But unlike the others where 

 it was easy to get a hang of the track, this one looks more 

 challenging. The Hungaroring is a very technical circuit, 

 which has one corner leading to another and doesnt 

 allow the driver to relax at all for the entire duration 

 of the lap. 

 This circuit is used only once 

 a year and clearly you can feel the slippery nature of the 

 circuit due to the dust and other debris on the track. It 

 thus becomes essential to follow the racing line to avoid 

 collecting the debris. 

 Due to this, and the tight and 

 twisty nature of the track, overtaking is virtually impossible 

 here and it all depends on who takes the lead going into 

 the first corner of the race. For us, it will get tricky 

 when a car comes to lap us since that would mean moving 

 over the racing line and collecting the debris and on this 

 circuit it takes two full laps to clean your tyres and get 

 them back to racing quality.

 The FIA regulations allow only 

 two hours of practice on Friday and Saturday. So the aim 

 on both these days was to get as many laps under my belt 

 as possible. I have to admit this is one circuit which is 

 quite hard to learn. I expect this weekends race to 

 be really hard for us.

 The weather conditions also look 

 really challenging. It is extremely hot here with the track 

 temperature being around 50 degrees centigrade. It is physically 

 very demanding and the drivers are always working due to 

 the fact that there are no straights except the start-finish 

 one.

 Johnny Herbert has joined our 

 team as the sporting relation manager. It is great to have 

 his 11 years of Formula One experience with us. It was something 

 the team needed and I feel its a big move. It was 

 his first day in office on Friday and I am sure as time 

 goes along he will prove to be very useful to us.

 As usual, the Mclaren-Mercedes 

 easily are the fastest cars on the circuit. However, reliability 

 issues have, on some occasions, spoilt their party. If they 

 can sort out that one issue, I am sure we will see them 

 take the chequered flag at Hungary.

 KARTHIKEYAN SO FAR...

 In the Formula One world championship, 

 so far, Narain Karthikeyans best result has been at 

 US Grand Prix in Indianapolis where he finished fourth. 

 Of course only six cars took part after the rest pulled 

 out due to fear of Michelin tyres not being safe. His next 

 best was at the Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang where he 

 finished 11th. The following is his performance in the first 

 12 races of the season:

 Felix strike sinks Bagan

Margao: Man of the Match Felix Ibrebru?s second half strike enabled Salgaocar down Mohun Bagan by a solitary goal in the ninth National Football League for the ONGC Cup here today. 

Both the teams played attacking football but failed to make constructive moves in the first half. 

Bagan had the first chance to score but defender Dulal Biswas? fierce shot was well saved by Salgaocar custodian Juje Siddi. 

Salgaocar, who had more of the ball possession, had two scoring chances in the first half. The best was in the 36th minute when unmarked Ibrebru failed to guide his header on target on a cross by Francis Andrade from the left. 

However, Ibrebru made amends for his first half lapse when he chipped the ball into the net after seeing ?keeper Bivash Ghosh out of position, off a defence-splitting pass by Rocus Lamare in the 74th minute. 

Bagan, who made four changes from their last match which they lost against Fransa, failed to show urgency in their attack. 

It was only in the closing stage after they conceded the goal that they woke up and made desperate attempt to find the equaliser but failed to score as Siddi came up with brilliant saves. The win took Salgaocar to seventh place while Bagan are in eighth spot. 

Meanwhile in Mumbai, Mahindra United were held 1-1 by Goa?s Vasco at the Cooperage Ground here on Friday.

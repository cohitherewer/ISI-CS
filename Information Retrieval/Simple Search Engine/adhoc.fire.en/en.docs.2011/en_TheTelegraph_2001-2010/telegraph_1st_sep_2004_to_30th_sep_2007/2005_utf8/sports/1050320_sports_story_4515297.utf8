 Shoaib wants more time: Bari

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar has asked for more time to be fit for the ongoing series against India after failing to recover completely from a hamstring injury, chairman of the Pakistan selectors, Wasim Bari, said on Saturday. 

?I talked to Shoaib Akhtar and his trainer Grant Compton on Friday evening and Shoaib told me that he needs more time to get fit,? Bari said. 

?We all know his capability so we are not going to judge that. But he needs to declare his fitness and until last evening, Shoaib Akhtar was not sure of himself and had asked for more time to get fit,? Bari said. 

Asked if that meant Shoaib may miss the entire India tour, Bari refused to draw any conclusion.

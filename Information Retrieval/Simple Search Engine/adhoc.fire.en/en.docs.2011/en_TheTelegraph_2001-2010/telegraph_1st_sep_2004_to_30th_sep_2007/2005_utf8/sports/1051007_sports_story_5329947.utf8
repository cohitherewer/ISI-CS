The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni likely to be deputy

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is likely to be appointed vice-captain of East Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Sourav Ganguly will retain the captaincy provided he decides to play. 

East open their campaign against North Zone in Rajkot on October 20. 

If Sourav agrees to play, he will be the automatic choice for leadership. Otherwise, Dhoni, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Shiv Sundar Das and Rohan Gavaskar are in the running. Dhoni being a current national player will be preferred, a source said. 

The East Zone selection committee is scheduled to meet here on Friday afternoon. Besides Shukla and Gavaskar, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul, Sanjib Sanyal and Arindam Das are almost certain to be in the squad. 

Former Team India glovesman Deep Dasgupta is unlikely to get a berth in the 14-member squad as Jharkhand keeper Dhoni is an automatic choice. If Dhoni is available, Deep will not be there, the source informed. 

Meanwhile, Sourav had one-and-a-half hour session at the Pankaj Gupta indoor gymnasium, besides nine laps at the Eden on Thursday. All the other Bengal probables had nets at Jadavpur Universitys Salt Lake Campus.

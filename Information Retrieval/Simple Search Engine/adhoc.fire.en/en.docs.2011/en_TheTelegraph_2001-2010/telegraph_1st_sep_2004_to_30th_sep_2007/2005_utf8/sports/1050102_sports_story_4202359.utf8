 Sharapova, Venus set for showdown

Chiang Mai (Thailand): Venus Williams and Maria Sharapova both rode elephants Saturday, a day before playing an exhibition match in northern Thailand as part of their preparations for the Australian Open. 

?I think 2005 will be a great year for me,? she said here. 

Saturday she visited an elephant training centre and rode one of the giant symbols of Thailand. 

Sharapova trained in the morning and then also hopped on the back of an elephant in the afternoon.

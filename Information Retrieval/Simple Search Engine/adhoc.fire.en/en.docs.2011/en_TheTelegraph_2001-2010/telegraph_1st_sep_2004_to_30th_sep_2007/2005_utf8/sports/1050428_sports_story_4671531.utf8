 Romario still around as ?others weak?

Sao Paulo: Former World Cup striker Romario says he is still playing professional football in Brazil at 39 because the rest of the players are not up to much. 

?Something that motivates me is that, technically, the gang (other players) is really weak,? he said at a media conference on the eve of his official farewell international. 

Romario, who was apparently referring to the standard of domestic football, has been picked as the 23rd player in the squad for Brazil?s friendly at home to Guatemala. 

Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said the former PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona and Valencia striker is likely to play the first few minutes before being substituted. 

?This is definitely my last game for Brazil,? said Romario, adding he would have favoured the match in Rio de Janeiro?s Maracana Stadium than Sao Paulo?s Pacaembu. ?It would not be true to say that this is the ideal place for my farewell. I?ve always told the truth and I?m not going to stop today,? said Romario. ?The ideal would be the Maracana because Rio de Janeiro is my home.? 

Wednesday?s game could provide the chance for Romario to line up, albeit briefly, alongside Robinho, considered the best of Brazil?s latest generation of players. The Santos striker, 18 years Romario?s junior, avoided comparisons. 

?Romario is Romario, Robinho is Robinho,? he said. 

Brazil have picked a squad of home-based players for Wednesday?s game, which has been arranged to celebrate the 40th anniversary of a TV network. Guatemala were the fourth choice opponents after Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador all turned down the invitation. 

For Romario, it?s a triumphant return to the national squad after a four-year absence. And Parreira is glad to have him. ?He?s still vibrant, he?s happy, he?s playing well for Vasco,? said Parreira. ?It will be a well-deserved tribute.? (Agencies)

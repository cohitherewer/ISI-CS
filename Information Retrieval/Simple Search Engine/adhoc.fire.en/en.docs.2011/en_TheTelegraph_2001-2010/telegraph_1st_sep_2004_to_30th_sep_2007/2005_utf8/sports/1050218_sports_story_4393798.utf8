 Gambhir, Yuvraj help North Zone crush West

 Yuvraj scored an unbeaten 

 100 off 115 balls.

Lucknow: Yuvraj Singh took a big stride towards regaining his place in the Test XI, hitting a swashbuckling unbeaten century to help North Zone record a nine-wicket victory against West Zone in another Duleep Trophy league game. 

Chasing a target of 207, North romped home with Yuvraj remaining not out on 100 (with 16 fours) on the penultimate day at the K.D. Singh Babu Stadium. 

Man-of-the-Match Yuvraj was involved in an undefeated 170-run stand with Gautam Gambhir, who was equally impressive in scoring an unbeaten 79. 

The stylish Punjab left-hander, who came in after the dismissal of Virender Sehwag (15), exhibited an array of attractive shots on either side of the wicket and raced to his hundred in 115 balls. 

Yuvraj was particularly severe on star pacer Zaheer Khan, carting him for four boundaries in two successive overs. 

West, resuming Thursday morning on 146 for five, were bundled out for 201 in 63.1 overs with leg-spinner Amit Mishra scalping five for 52. West lost their last six wickets for 81 runs. 

North, who began their chase on a cautious note, soon lost Sehwag when he lofted a flighted delivery from Rajesh Pawar to Zaheer at long-off. 

Gambhir, however, blossomed after a careful start and struck nine boundaries. 

But the star was undoubtedly Yuvraj, who delighted fans with some powerful strokeplay off both pacers and spinners. 

BRIEF SCORES: West Zone 201 amp; 201 (W. Jaffer 47, R. Pawar 39; A. Mishra 5/52). North Zone 196 amp; 208/1 (Y. Singh 100 not out, G. Gambhir 79 not out). North won by 9 wkts.

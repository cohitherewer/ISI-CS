 Aiyappa hattrick fells Sultans

 - Premier Hockey League 

 Sohail Abbas gave Sultans early lead 

Hyderabad: Len Aiyappa struck the first hattrick of the competition as Bangalore Hi-Fliers beat Hyderabad Sultans 3-2 in a tier-I match of the Premier Hockey League here Sunday. Riding Aiyappa?s brilliance, Bangalore came from behind to hand Hyderabad their first defeat in the tournament. 

Aiyappa struck in the 14th, 49th and 51st the minutes after Sohail Abbas gave Hyderabad the lead in the 12th minute. Wasim Ahmed slammed home five minutes before the final whistle. 

After the Bangalore team messed up a penalty corner, the world?s highest goal-scorer Abbas lived up to his reputation with his trade mark drag-flick to the right corner of the post to put the hosts in the lead in the first quarter. 

But minutes later Len Aiyappa scored the equaliser through a similar flick infusing tempo into the game played before a sizeable Sunday crowd which included former Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin. 

Aiyappa struck in the next two short corner opportunities and the Hi-Fliers took a 3-1 lead. 

Stung by the reverse, Vikram Pillay, Susan Toppno and Sameer Dad raided the opponent citadel with some incisive moves but could not pull out any thing positive. 

Sultans, who had more control of the ball, could not capitalise on a few lapses by the Hi-Fliers and Abbas too missed one penalty corner. 

After Bangalore took a 3-1 lead, the hosts looked a bit upset and their running went awry and at times could not regroup effectively while their opponents maintained their cool. 

Tushar Khandekar and Arjun Halappa combined well and moved in tandem for the Bangalore team tearing apart the defence of the Dilip Tirkey-led team. 

Earlier, Gurcharan Singh netted three as Delhi Dazzlers outplayed Imphal Rangers 5-2 in a tier-II match. 

Gurcharan (17th, 64th and 65th), Raju (25th) and Amit (45th) scored for Delhi while Shanta Kumar (eighth) and Brojen Singh (66th) scored for Imphal Rangers. The win also helped the Dazzlers join the Chandigarh Dynamos at the top of the table with 15 points.

 Bangladesh set up clash with India

Karachi: India would take on defending champions Bangladesh ? who defeated hosts Pakistan ? to enter the final of the South Asian Football Federation Championship scheduled for Saturday. 

Mohammad Sujan converted a penalty in first half injury time on Wednesday to send Bangladesh to their third consecutive final of the tournament. 

Sujan was also the scorer of the decisive goal in the 2003 SAFF final penalty shootout win against the Maldives. 

The penalty came about when Pakistans Abdul Aziz brought down Firoz Mahmud Titu inside the penalty area and Iranian referee Khodadad Afsharian immediately pointed to the spot. 

This was the first goal conceded by Pakistan skipper and custodian Jaffar Khan after 225 minutes of football. 

India had earlier made the final after beating the Maldives 1-0. The three-time champions would be without Mehtab Hussain who was red-carded in the semi-final for a dangerous foul. (PTI)

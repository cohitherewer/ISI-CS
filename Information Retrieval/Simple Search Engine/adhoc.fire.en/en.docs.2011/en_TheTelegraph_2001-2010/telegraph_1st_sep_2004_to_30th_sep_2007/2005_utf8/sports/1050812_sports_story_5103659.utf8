 Zidane makes official return 

Paris: Zinedine Zidane made his official return to international duty when he was included along with Lilian Thuram and Claude Makelele in the France squad to play Ivory Coast in a friendly next Wednesday. 

All three players, who announced their international comebacks last week after a year in retirement, have been picked by France coach Raymond Domenech in a 21-man squad for the game in Montpellier. 

Its an important game, so I needed to gather everyone. Even if I can only use 18 players, I decided to pick 21 so that I can see everybody, Domenech told reporters on Thursday. 

Makeleles recall meant Olympique Lyon midfielder Benoit Pedretti, a regular since Domenech took over from Jacques Santini after Frances failure at Euro 2004, was omitted from the squad. 

Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires, who won his 79th cap in Frances 2-0 win in Cyprus on October 13, 2004, has once again been left out. 

David Trezeguets call-up comes as a surprise as he is nursing a slight ankle injury and will be suspended for Frances next two World Cup qualifiers.

 Star Magic for ?Sprint? 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Favourites may find the going easy 

in a well-filled Saturday?s eight-event card, which features the 1,200m Calcutta 

Champions? Sprint Trophy, a prestigious race.

 The Sprint may also see the public-choice Star Magic delivering the goods. The Harvinder Singh Bath-trainee has struck twice this season in as many starts. The fact that the seven-year-old is favoured by the terms of the race, it may not come as a surprise if he comes good again in the hands of S. Shanker.

Romantic Liaison, in the Alokananda Stakes, may end 

trainer Vijay Singh?s drought for winners in the juvenile races. The filly needed 

her last run.

 Aquilo romps home with Derby 

HONKY DORY

 Trainer Cooji Katraks Aquilo treated the field of 15 horses like a bunch of novices and walked away with the 2,000m Nanoli Stud Pune Derby, the star attraction in Sundays race card.

 Mallesh Narredu had the Storm Trooper-Ravij colt settled off the pace in the first half of the journey but improved his position significantly 800m from home. Aquilo shot into the lead 600m from home and drew away from the field instantly to leave a yawning gap between himself and rest.

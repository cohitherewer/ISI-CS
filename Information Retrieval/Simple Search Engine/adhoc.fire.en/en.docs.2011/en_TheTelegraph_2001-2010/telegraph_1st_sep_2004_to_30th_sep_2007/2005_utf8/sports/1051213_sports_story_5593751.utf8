Lahore: Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal scored a majestic hundred and Shoaib Akhtar took five wickets to lead Pakistan to an emphatic seven-wicket win over England in the second one-day International on Monday. 

Inzamam-ul Haq made 31 not out as the hosts reached their target of 231 with six overs left. The Pakistan captain, in his 349th appearance, also became only the second batsman to hit 11,000 runs in one-dayers, joining Indias Sachin Tendulkar. 

The 35-year-old Inzamam plundered four boundaries in one Liam Plunkett over to leave the five-match series level at 1-1 after England won the first game by 42 runs. The third match will be held in Karachi on Thursday. 

Inzamam was full of praise for the efforts of his bowlers on a good batting wicket. 

They didnt give enough room to the batsmen to play their shots and it was a good comeback from the defeat in the first match, he said. 

Pakistan dominated from the start, fast bowler Shoaib taking five for 54 to bowl out England for a modest 230 in 48.4 overs. 

Man of the Match Shoaib removed Marcus Trescothick (16) and Andrew Strauss (duck) in the same over. 

Only a record ninth-wicket stand of 100 between Plunkett (56) and super sub Vikram Solanki (39 not out) rescued England from 130 for eight. 

Akmal then struck 102 from 111 balls to notch his second one-day century.

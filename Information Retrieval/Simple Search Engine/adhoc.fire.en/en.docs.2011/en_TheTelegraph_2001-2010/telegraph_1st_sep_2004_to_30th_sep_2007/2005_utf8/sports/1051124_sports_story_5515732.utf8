 More: We expect Dhoni to reproduce ODI form

Chennai: It was a memorable day for two East Zone cricketers. Sourav Ganguly, having lost the captaincy and an ODI berth, retained his Test slot, while Jharkhand wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni got his maiden call-up for the longer version of the game at Dinesh Karthiks expense. 

Young paceman Rudra Pratap Singh was also named in a Test squad for the first time. 

Pacers Zaheer Khan and Lakshmipathy Balaji did not find favour with the selectors for the first Test against Sri Lanka beginning in Chennai on December 2. 

The selectors also retained the same squad for the last two ODIs against South Africa. 

[That the same XV will be named for the Calcutta and Mumbai games was reported in these columns on Monday.] 

Explaining why Dhoni made the cut, selection committee chairman Kiran More said he had created a niche with his outstanding performance in the one-dayers. 

He has also shown that he can perform well at different positions in the batting order. When he comes at six or seven in Tests, we can put the opposition under pressure. 

Of course, Karthik has done well in the past but Dhoni has been selected on the strength of his ODI performances and we expect him to do the same in Tests. 

The meeting, attended by captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell, also discussed some other talented youngsters with an eye on the future. 

We discussed a lot of other boys looking at the future? we have some very good players who could not make it to the squad this time, More said. 

Reminded of the V.R.V. Singh episode, which saw the rookie pacer being named in the squad (for the Rajkot and Vadodara ODIs versus Sri Lanka) only to be sent home before the Rajkot game as he was not fit, More said: He is still not totally fit. He is a talented bowler and can make the team in the future.

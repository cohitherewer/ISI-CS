Los Angeles: Australia?s Adam Scott won the rain-hit Nissan Open in a sudden death play-off on Monday, becoming the first PGA Tour winner in nine years to be crowned champion after 36 holes. 

The 24-year-old edged out American Chad Campbell at the first extra hole, where he tapped in from three feet for a par, after the tournament was reduced to two rounds following four days of heavy rain at the Riviera Country Club. 

The Nissan is the first PGA Tour event to decide a winner after two rounds since Michael Bradley won the 1996 Buick Open. 

?It has been a tough week, a very unusual week... a win is a win and it?s nice to be playing well here,? said a jubilant Scott.

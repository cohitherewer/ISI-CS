 Edwards for Collins 

 Edwards has been forced to remodel action as part of his recovery 

Bridgetown: Fast bowler Fidel Edwards will replace his older brother Pedro Collins in the West Indies squad for the third Test against South Africa this week, cricket officials said. 

There is one other change for the match that begins on Thursday at Kensington Oval in Barbados ? allrounder Ryan Hinds replaces batsman Donovan Pagon, the West Indies Cricket Board said. 

The 23-year-old Edwards, of Barbados, has not played for the West Indies since the final Test of last year?s tour of England in August. Chief selector Joey Carew noted that Collins was suffering a minor back injury and would miss the match in his native country. 

Hinds played in the first Test but missed the second with a viral infection. He has since recovered. Edwards returns after having received treatment for a back injury. Two days ago, his physiotherapist Jacqui King-Mowatt said he had recovered. 

Edwards has been under the watch of his personal coach Wendell Coppin during his recovery and has been forced to remodel his action. He has played three matches for Barbados since being injured in England to ensure that he was ready for a return to the international stage. 

South Africa lead the series 1-0 after winning the second Test in Trinidad. The first match in Guyana ended in a draw. 

Meanwhile, Boeta Dippenaar advanced his claims for a Test recall by top-scoring with 184 for South Africa in their drawn two-day tour match against a University of the West Indies Vice-Chancellor?s XI at St Augustine on Sunday. 

Dippenaar, who could replace the out-of-form Jacques Rudolph in the third Test, made the most of almost seven hours at the crease, striking 21 fours and two sixes in 278 balls. Rudolph withdrew from the team for the tour match because of a back injury.

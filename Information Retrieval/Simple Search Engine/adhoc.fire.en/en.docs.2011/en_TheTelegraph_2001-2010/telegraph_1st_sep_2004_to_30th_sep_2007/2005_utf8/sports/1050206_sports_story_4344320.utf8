Calcutta: An accomplished midfielder in the guise of a central defender, a hardcore striker as linkman. Mohun Bagan were bound to pay for such lack of professionalism sooner than later. 

Goa?s Fransa Pax FC profited from Mohun Bagan?s poor form at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, overcoming the three-time NFL champions 2-1. 

After Jules Alberto fired the visitors in front with a stunning right-footer in the first half, Robert Mendes Silva Beto headed in a smart equaliser in the 69th minute. Substitute Joseph Ogor made capital of a Noel Wilson error 13 minutes from full time to ensure three points for Fransa. 

Three losses in six matches for a tally of seven points may not sound alarming yet, but with four teams due to be relegated from this year?s competition, Mohun Bagan fans have already started praying. Fransa, who had been shocked by Tollygunge Agragami the other day, moved into the top-four with 10 points. 

Past the halfway stage of the NFL?s first phase, all major contenders for the ONGC Cup have more or less identified the right combination and the reserves. Mohun Bagan, meanwhile, continue to struggle with team formation and bench-strength. Wilson had to again fill in for a regular stopper (Eduardo Coelho was out with a double booking) while Ashim Biswas was used as Tomba Singh?s replacement in the midfield. 

The long-haired Wilson, for all his commitment and intensity, made two dreadful mistakes. First he pulled down a goal-bound Sebastiao Endro inside the penalty box when the game was 62 minutes old. It was a clear penalty, but referee Chamchuk Lama thought otherwise. 

Wilson?s second folly came 15 minutes later, but this time he didn?t get away lightly. His careless clearance found Ogor who moved up menacingly, drawing Prasanta Dora out. The Nigerian weaved past the diving custodian and pushed the ball into an untenanted goal. Mehrajuddin Wadao sprinted back but his desperate attempt to scramble the ball out of harm?s way was futile. 

Till Alberto found the mark with a booming 25-yard right-footer in the 17th minute, most of the action was in the Fransa half of the field. Despite Mohun Bagan?s territorial advantage, though, they could barely rip open the Goans? defence. Ashim looked lost, Dharamjit Singh didn?t show his customary agility and the off-form Mehtab Hussain had to be replaced by Basudeb Mondal before the clock had registered 25 minutes. 

Fransa settled down after going ahead, with Desmond Fernandes and Peter Rodrigues combining effectively with Benjamin Ansah. But even the visitors were hard pressed to create clear-cut openings. 

There was hard tackling at both ends, and the stretcher had to be summoned half a dozen times. Fransa, in fact, suffered two crucial blows when stopper Sanjiv Maria and medio Rodrigues had to be taken off ? within a span of three minutes in the second half ?following aerial duels. 

Maria, a Mohun Bagan-reject, had to be taken to the hospital and needed stitches on the head. According to coach Norbert Gonsalves, he will be out for about two weeks. 

Mohun Bagan upped the tempo as Fransa were forced to introduce two substitutes. Three promising down-the-flank runs produced three good crosses, but Beto, Sunil Chhetri and Ashim took turns to misdirect their headers. 

Beto did make amends, outjumping the Fransa defenders to head in a curling Basudeb cross for his third goal of the competition. The only other scorer for the green-and-maroons has been Chhetri. Four goals scored and six conceded in six matches is an apt commentary of Mohun Bagan?s performance thus far.

Melbourne: Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag will have a key role to play as World XI take on Australia in the first one-day International of the ICC Super Series here on Wednesday, with the hosts determined to prove they are still the undisputed champions despite the Ashes debacle. 

Dravids stature as one of the worlds leading batsmen got a fresh confirmation as he was awarded the crucial No.3 spot in the star-studded World XI line-up in what promises to be a riveting contest. 

The explosive Sehwag got the nod ahead of West Indian Chris Gayle to open the World XI batting in the first of the three ODIs to be played at the Docklands Stadium here on Wednesday.

Australia, led by Ricky Ponting, will be under pressure to maintain their reputation as three-time World Champions and the No.1 Test team following the stunning defeat in England this summer. 

The Super Series comprises three ODIs, with the second and third to be played on October 7 and 9, followed by a six-day Super Test from October 14 to 19. 

The ODIs would be played at the flood-lit indoor stadium Telstra Dome while the Test will be held at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

The series will also witness the trial of several innovative concepts including the option for on-field umpires to refer decisions, including those on leg before wicket, to the TV umpire. 

Sri Lankas Kumar Sangakkara would partner Sehwag at the top of the order that also includes West Indies world record holder Brian Lara, followed by allrounders Jacques Kallis of South Africa and Andrew Flintoff of England. 

There would also be some cavalier batting on display with Kevin Pietersen and Shahid Afridi also figuring in the 12-man squad led by South African allrounder Shaun Pollock. 

Dravid, Lara and Kallis bring to the world team a combined wealth of 25,425 runs through 42 hundreds and 172 half centuries from 735 matches. 

The bowling will be spearheaded by Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Murlidharan, who has taken 381 wickets from 247 one-dayers. 

 With Pollock (321 wickets from 236 matches), Rawalpindi Express Shoaib Akhtar (192, 123), Kallis (197, 217) and Daniel Vettori (146, 154) ready to go for their neck, the Aussies were bound to have to some rough time ahead. 

Ponting seemed wary of allowing umpires to refer all decisions to technology. 

I dont think anyone is going to really know about how this will go, he said on the eve of the match. 

There are a lot of things the umpires are going to be looking at and testing, but as far as the players are concerned all we can do is play the game the same way and let the umpires and third umpires look after all those decisions. 

Pollock was a bit more optimistic. 

There is a time where technology needs to be tried and thats what is going to happen in this series and after this we have a reference point where we can refer back to, he said. 

I think its important that we take it in that spirit. If there are too many stoppages and hiccups and things dont seem to be running smoothly then Im sure they will be put aside, Pollock said. 

For Australia, Simon Katich will open with Adam Gilchrist after Matthew Hayden lost his ODI slot. 

Australia also lost their pace hope Shaun Tait owing to an injury as also Brad Hogg. Stuart Clark and Cameron White were the replacements but the former was not in the 12 named by Australia on Tuesday.

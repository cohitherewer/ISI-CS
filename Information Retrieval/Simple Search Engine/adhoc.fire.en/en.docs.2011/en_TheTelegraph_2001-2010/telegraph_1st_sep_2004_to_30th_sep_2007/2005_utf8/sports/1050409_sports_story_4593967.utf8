 Lara goes past Sachin

Port-of-Spain: Brian Lara was in fluent form on his return to the West Indies team for the second Test against South Africa on Friday. 

Lara blasted an unbeaten 41 as the hosts put on 71 for two at lunch on the first day. West Indies were wobbling on 13 for two at that stage but solid batting from opener Wavell Hinds and Lara halted the slide. 

In reaching 41 Lara moved up to third on the all-time list of Test batsman, going past Indian Sachin Tendulkar?s total of 10,134 runs. (Reuters)

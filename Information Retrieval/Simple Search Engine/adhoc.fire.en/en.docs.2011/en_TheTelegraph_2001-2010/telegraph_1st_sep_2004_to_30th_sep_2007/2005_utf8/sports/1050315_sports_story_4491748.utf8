 Pakistan unhappy

Karachi: The Pakistan cricket team management has expressed displeasure over the standard of umpiring in the Mohali Test by giving umpires Rudi Koertzen and Darrell Hair negative ratings. 

Bob Woolmer and Inzamam-ul Haq have not only given negative ratings to the two umpires but also expressed concern that there was no consistency in the umpiring, reported a Pakistan daily. 

It also described Koertzen?s decision to give Sachin Tendulkar not out in the first innings as a ?shocker? after the maestro had got an inner edge off Danish Kaneria. It also criticised Hair for giving Inzamam leg before off Anil Kumble in the second innings when the Pakistan captain was on 86. 

?Everyone saw what happened. Make your own judgement,? Inzamam was quoted by the newspaper as saying when asked to comment on the standard of umpiring.

 Vijay holds aces again 

 STAR RACER

 Vijay

Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh, who has a penchant for trophy events, will be the man to watch out for again on Saturday. He has two star performers from his stable ? Anzello and Serrafina ? running for the 2,000m Hyderabad Race Club Cup and the Baqlava Cup over 1,600 metres respectively.

 Both horses have been showing steady improvement this season and they are also heading for their third straight victory.

 The 1,400m Calorescence Cup may, however, see Jaggy Dhariwal?s Autocop revealing his South India form. The Burden Of Proof-Traffic Police filly was a total failure in Classics, but in the open Class she is expected to down Santarelle who has been well penalised for her last runaway victory. 

Raging Tide, a half-brother to Alaskan, is also expected 

to lift the 1,200m Revelation Plate.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name,

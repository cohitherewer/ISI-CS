The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Centuries versus India, Australia main boosters for Salman Butt

 Butt was critical of the Dharamshala wicket 

Dharamshala: Pakistan?s opening batsman Salman Butt has brushed aside talks of the team being inexperienced and said the youngsters in the visiting side were keen to make the Indian series a stepping stone to future success. 

?Well, we are not going to gain experience sitting outside the ropes. Whether we make a 100 or a duck we have go inside and perform,? the 20-year old Butt said. 

?And this is the time that is going to help us. These are going to be very good and the most important phases of our career. The earlier we have them the better.? 

Butt, who made his Test debut against Zimbabwe at home in 2003, must know a thing or two about the significance of performing against after scoring a sparkling century in the platinum jubilee one-dayer in Calcutta last year. 

The left-handed opener said the century at Eden Gardens as also the ton against Australia on their home soil recently had given him immense confidence going into the high pressure series. 

?Definitely it helps. One, in a pressure situation against India and the other against Australia, the world champions in their conditions. These are two knocks any Pakistani batsman would like to have to his name, thank god I have them early in my career.? 

Butt however refused to rate them. ?No, I would not like to choose between either one of them. Not one of them is more important to me than the other. Both of them are like dreams coming true at an early age.? 

He was critical of the pitch at the HPCA Stadium here.?It (the pitch) is a new one and it is very very low. Even if you plant your front foot, you could play the whole day, that is what I think. 

?I don?t think this is good for cricket. The one in Calcutta was a good cricketing track. Even in Pakistan the wickets are much bouncier and faster. Hopefully the wickets in Tests will be much better.?

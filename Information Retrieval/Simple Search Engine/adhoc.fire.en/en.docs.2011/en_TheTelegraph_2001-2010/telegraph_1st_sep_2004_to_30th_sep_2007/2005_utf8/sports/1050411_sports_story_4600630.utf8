 Pulling down shutters Vijay?s wise move 

 STAR RACER

 (Top) 

 Daniel, Chisty 

 Daniel David?s late surge, that helped the trainer pick up 14 winners in eight calendar days, was a remarkable effort. He is just a winner away from trainer Vijay Singh at the top of the championship table. There being so much juice in the stable, it may be a mere formality for him to overtake the leader in the concluding meet of the season on Wednesday.

 Most of Daniel?s winners during the back-to-back fixtures, last week and the week before, had done little or nothing in the past, yet they went to the start as hot-favourites and scored at will, too. It required smart planning and execution, utilising the depth in the stable. Jockey Imran Chisty was mainly associated with Daniel?s upswing. 

 Daniel still has a dozen or so more to be exploited. Therefore, there?s no ruing the fact that Vijay had pulled down shutters on his stable nearly a month ago as any target, at the championship table, was achievable for Daniel. With most of Vijay?s lots having already pushed to handicap limits, they would have managed to place good seconds to Daniel?s certainties, whose weights were carefully crafted downward over the months. 

 Daniel, therefore, made hey, during the period mentioned, leaving stipendiary stewards confused. Of course, they had been questioning about the sudden spurt at the performance level of Daniel?s runners but excuses ? varying from switching to a shorter distances from long, or the other way round, and also a three-week mandatory gap between poor runs to winning ones ? had been coming handy. It may not, though, convince most, but things were happening in such manner since a month.

 One need not be an expert to gauge potentials of Daniel?s runners or winners after they were exposed in races. The likes of Pacific Jewels, Wild Flowers and Silver ?N? Golds have already collected seven wins among them and are quite capable of increasing Daniel?s

 tally if saddled again. Generous Gesture, Hunter?s Paradise, Ocean Spirit and Mr Darcy, on the other hand, are some of the other Daniel winners set to score an encore if they get a chance to do so. Add to the list the likes of Astra Fields, Beachamp Heros, Presidiums, Mighty Flashs and Poetic Moments, who served notice of their improved form. But there is going to be only seven-event card on the concluding day. Daniel is going to have a handful of winners and there is no point reviewing the performance of his winners or losers, who might have needed forward runs, or had gone easy for some reason or the other.

 Those deserving an equal amount of credit during the Wednesday-Thursday fixtures include apprentice Vinay Jaiswal, whose admirable dare-devilry in the saddle, on Wednesday, lifted his profile by a few notches. And also the trainer-jockey combination of Dipak Karki and Md Islam deserve kudos for their back-to-back winning efforts on Sea Legend, the following day. The horse had recently joined Karki?s stable from trainer Errol Bhungard?s.

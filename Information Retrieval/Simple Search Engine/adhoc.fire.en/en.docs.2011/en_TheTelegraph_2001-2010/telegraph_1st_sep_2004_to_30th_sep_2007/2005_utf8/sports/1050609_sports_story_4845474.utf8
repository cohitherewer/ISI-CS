 Pursuit set for encore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Foolish Pursuit, 

 a runaway winner over a mile in his last start, looks good 

 for an encore in the 1,800m Kollegal Plate here on Thursday.

 The Kristal Rock-Merry Madonna gelding, from Vishal Yadavs yard, with apprentice Ch. K. Chary to guide him, may not be troubled by any of his six rivals who are considered suspect over the trip.

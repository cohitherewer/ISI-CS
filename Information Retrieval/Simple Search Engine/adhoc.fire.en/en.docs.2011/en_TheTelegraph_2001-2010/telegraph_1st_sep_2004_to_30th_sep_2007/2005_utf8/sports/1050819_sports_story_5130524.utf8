Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar had his second light practice session at the MIG Club ground in Bandra on Thursday, under the watchful eyes of Team India physio John Gloster. 

Sachin, who started light practice sessions with a special ball on Tuesday, faced balls thrown at him at a gentle pace. 

Zimbabwe-bound Ajit Agarkar was also present at the afternoon practice session. 

Sachin has not played since he underwent surgery for the tennis elbow injury on May 27 in London. 

The master blaster will miss the tri-series in Zimbabwe, for which the Sourav Ganguly-led squad will leave on Monday, but will join a 15-strong party for the two-Test series from September 13 if declared fit. 

I hope to take gradual steps? Its important I look at long-term plans instead of short-term goals. Thats why I feel even if it takes a couple of weeks more (in making the comeback), its okay, Sachin said on Wednesday.

 Back to the grind for Hewitt

London: Lleyton Hewitt will go home and work even harder to try and bridge the gap to world No. 1 Roger Federer, the Australian said on Friday after losing to the Swiss in the Wimbledon semi-final. 

Ive got to bide my time, keep grinding away and try and look for the answers I guess, said the 24-year-old world No. 2 who was swept aside 6-3, 6-4, 7-6, his eighth successive defeat by Federer. 

I felt like Ive lifted my game over the last 18 months or so. Ive got no doubt that I feel like Im the second best player going around right now. Its just that the best player is pretty bloody good. 

Hewitt, the last player to win Wimbledon before Federer burst through to take the title in 2003, denied the Swiss had a psychological edge over him despite his overwhelming superiority in the past two years. 

I dont think (my record) psychologically had much to do with this match, said Hewitt, who last beat Federer in a Davis Cup tie on hardcourts in 2003. 

Youre always looking for ways to improve, otherwise theres no point in continuing playing. As long as Ive got small areas to work on, its got to be a positive. 

I dont know what hes got to work on. Roger is one of the best players Ive ever seen. 

Hewitt has not won a Grand Slam title since beating Argentine David Nalbandian here at Wimbledon in 2002, the year after he stormed through the US Open. 

Since then he has had several near misses, including at last years US Open where he was thrashed by Federer in the final. 

He also lost in the final of the Australian Open to Marat Safin earlier this year. 

Its a huge positive that I keep putting myself in these positions, he said. 

But of course when you get to a semi-final, final of Slams, you want to try and take that next step and hold up the trophy. 

Im obviously doing something right. But, you know, to come awfully close so many times now...

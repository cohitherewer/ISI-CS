The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sasikiran a draw away from title

New Delhi: GM Krishnan Sasikiran showed his class when he took advantage of a minor mistake by GM R.B. Ra-mesh to shoot into sole lead af-ter the penultimate round of the Parsvanath International Open chess meet on Sunday. 

The 24-year-old is now just a draw away from the title. 

Other overnight joint leaders, GM Abhijit Kunte and En-amul Hossain of Bangladesh played a quick eight move dra-w and were joined in the second spot by IM Anton Filipov of Uzbekistan and Saptarshi Roy in the Rs six-lakh prize money event. 

Meanwhile, R. Balasubramanium completed his third and final IM norm beating statemate M.B. Muralidharan and young talent Mary Ann Gomes achieved her maiden WIM nor-m with a win over Devraz Chatterjee of Bangladesh. 

On the top board, former champion Ramesh committed a simple mistake before proposing a draw on the 25th mo-ve and the top seed, sensing a chance of victory, not only declined it but also consolidated his position to wrap up the issue in 46 moves. Elsewhere, Saptarshi beat Himanshu Sharma. (PTI)

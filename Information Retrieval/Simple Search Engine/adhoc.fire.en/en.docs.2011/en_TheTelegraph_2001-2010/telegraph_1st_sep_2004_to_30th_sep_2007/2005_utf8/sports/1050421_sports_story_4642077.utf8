 SA look to seal series

 - THIRD TEST vs WI - Pollock not in frame just yet: Smith 

 Boeta Dippenaar may replace Jacques Rudolph 

Bridgetown: For South Africa, the third Test, beginning here on Thursday, is crucial since a win will give the visitors their fourth straight series victory over the West Indies. 

South Africa lead the four-Test series 1-0, following their comfortable eight-wicket triumph in the second Test at Port-of-Spain. The first Test at Georgetown ended in a draw, and the fourth and final one at St John?s, begins April 29. 

Though the Proteas have been fortified with the return of veteran fast bowling all-rounder Shaun Pollock ? who was sidelined for the first two Tests with an ankle injury ? captain Graeme Smith said later on Wednesday that Pollock won?t feature in the third Test. 

?It would be great to have him in the side but we need to decide whether he can bowl 25 overs a day,? Smith said. ?It?s not about ability or anything else with Shaun, it?s about whether he can last five days.? 

?The way we have been thinking is that to play him in the fourth Test would be ideal,? Smith said. 

The visitors? other major concern is Jacques Rudolph. The left-hander injured his back in the nets last Friday and a cloud hangs over his participation. 

Should Rudolph fail to overcome his injury, or the tour selectors agree that his form is limited, Boeta Dippenaar seems the obvious replacement, following his 184 in the two-day practice match against the University of the West Indies? Vice Chancellor?s XI last weekend. 

For the Windies, the selections seem straightforward. 

Left-hand slow bowling allrounder Ryan Hinds and fast bowler Fidel Edwards should replace the out-of-favour Donovon Pagon and injured Pedro Collins, respectively. 

?Hopefully, we can pull off a win on Barbados. For me, it will be difficult playing in front of my home crowd, but I think it will motivate me,? Edwards said.

Houston: Australia?s Gavin Coles and American Brett Quigley moved into a share of the lead at the Houston Open on Friday, with defending champion Vijai Singh and John Daly lurking one stroke back after the second round. 

India?s Arjun Atwal hit a two-under second round to be tied at 19th position. 

Atwal?s round was even, so to say, 35 out and 35 on way back. He had four birdies, two of them offset by bogies. 

Despite being one of the smallest players on the PGA Tour, Coles turned in a big effort at the Redstone Golf Club to card a three-under 69 and climb to the top of the leaderboard on 10-under-par 134 alongside Quigley, who recorded a second straight 67. 

The 7,508-yard Redstone layout and its wide open fairways hold mouth-watering appeal for the tour?s heavy hitters and Daly took full advantage, mixing seven birdies with a pair of bogeys to reach nine-under 135 through 36 holes. 

Singh, who had held the overnight lead after equalling the course record with an opening round eight-under 64, was unable to build on his momentum and had to settle for a one-under 71 that included nine consecutive pars to finish the round. Joining Singh and Daly at nine-under are Americans Joe Ogilvie and Jeff Maggert (Reuters)

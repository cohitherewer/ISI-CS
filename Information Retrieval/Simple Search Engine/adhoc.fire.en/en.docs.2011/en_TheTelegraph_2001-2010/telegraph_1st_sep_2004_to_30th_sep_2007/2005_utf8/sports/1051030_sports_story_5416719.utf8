 ODI in Goa subject to BCCI nod

 - Delhi, Kanpur, Chennai to host Tests against Lanka 

New Delhi: Goa Cricket Association, currently facing a inquiry by the cricket board over alleged malpractices during the one-dayer against Australia in 2001, will host England for a ODI provided the centre is cleared by the BCCI. 

Goa will host a one-day International against England provided the report of the BCCI disciplinary committee exonerates it and the findings are ratified by the boards working committee, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said, adding you can say it is a conditional allotment. 

The state association is facing charges of selling duplicate tickets for the ODI played on April 6, 2001. 

The BCCI programmes and fixtures committee allotted the three Test matches to be played against Sri Lanka in December to Delhi, Kanpur and Chennai, on Saturday. 

The matches would be held on December 2-6, December 10-14 and December 18-22 but the order of the venues would be decided later taking into account the travel plans of the Sri Lankan team. 

The Sri Lankan board had not asked for a warm-up game before the Test series and as of now, there is no plan to organise such a match. 

Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Mumbai would host Test matches against England next year. The dates for the matches are March 8-12, March 16-20 and March 25-29 to be followed by seven ODIs on April 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 and 22. 

Apart from Goa, the visiting Englishmen would play the remaining one-day Internationals in Indore, Guwahati, Faridabad, Cuttack, Kochi and Visakhapatnam. 

They are also scheduled to play two three-day warm-up matches to be played between February 25-27 and March 2-4, the venues for which would be decided later. 

We had to decide on the venues for the series quickly as England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) wanted to finalise their travel schedules, Nair said. 

We previously wanted to take a decision in this regard after the annual general meeting of the Board but since it is adjourned at the moment, the prevailing committee had to take the decision, he said. 

The centres were allotted the matches according to the BCCIs rotation policy and the decision has to be ratified by the working committee of the board, Nair said. 

If the ECB so chooses, they can send its teams to access the venues decided for the series, he added.

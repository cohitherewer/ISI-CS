 Oakland: Anastasia Myskina has pulled out of Russia?s Fed Cup tie against Italy in Brindisi on April 23-24 with a shoulder injury.

 Myskina?s coach Jens Gerlach said the French Open champion decided after last week?s tournament in Charleston that she needed to give her sore shoulder a rest. Myskina was upset in the second round by Czech 15-year-old Nicole Vaidisova at the Family Circle Cup.

 ?We decided it was better not to take any more risks because we have Roland Garros coming up,? Gerlach said over the telephone.

 The Russians have yet to announce a replacement for Myskina, although world No. 12 Nadia Petrova is a possibility. Captain Shamil Tarpischev has already named Elena Dementieva, Elena Bovina and Dinara Safina to the team.

 London: Paula Radcliffe was named on Tuesday in the British marathon team for the August world championships although she has yet to decide whether she will run over the roads or on the track in Helsinki.

 The 31-year-old world record holder clocked the third fastest time ever in Sunday?s London Marathon after failing to finish in last year?s Athens Olympics.

 She heads a five-strong women?s team for the championships, which incorporates the World Cup team event.

 Despite being acclaimed by London race director Dave Bedford as the best women?s distance runner ever, Radcliffe has yet to win a medal at a world championships or an Olympic Games.

 Colombo: Former England cricket captain Ian Botham is to visit Sri Lanka?s tsunami-hit southern region on Wednesday as part of efforts to raise money for survivors, officials said. Botham is to visit the Galle International Cricket Stadium, 115 km south of Colombo, as well as villages ravaged by the December 26 tsunamis that claimed nearly 31,000 lives in the island.

 Organiser Kushil Gunasekara said Botham was visiting the island as an ambassador for a British charity helping tsunami victims and in Sri Lanka he will be hosted Muttiah Muralidharan.

 Australia?s Shane Warne travelled to the south of the island in February. 

 Barcelona: A group of Real Madrid fans has been reported to the Spanish football federation for racist chanting during their side?s league match at Levante during the weekend. Referee David Fernandez Borbalan noted the behaviour of visiting fans in his report on the match which Real won 2-0.

 ?During the second half a group of Real Madrid fans... shouted monkey noises whenever Levante?s two coloured players wearing the numbers seven and 16 touched the ball,? said Fernandez Borbalan.

 Colombian forward Edwin Congo and Ivory Coast midfielder Felix Ettien were the two players targeted by the supporters who appeared to belong to the club?s radical Ultra Sur group of fans.

 Hissar: The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has selected 28 probables for attending the national coaching camp in preparation to the 18th senior Asian women wrestling championship to be held in Wuhan, China, from May 24 to 29.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 PMs tribute to stylish batsman

AGENCIES AND A STAFF REPORTER

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Saturday joined the many mourning voices at the passing away of former Indian skipper and great Test opener Syed Mushtaq Ali. The Prime Minister said Ali was one of the finest all-rounders who represented the country with great distinction and that he will be remembered for his stylish batting, quality spin bowling and for carrying on highest traditions of sportsmanship. 

The following are the other tributes: 

 GREG CHAPPELL: Its a great loss to the 

 cricketing world. He was one of the greatest batsmen of 

 all time with a destructive style. My condolences to the 

 family. 

 JAGMOHAN DALMIYA: He played in style. He was unorthodox but elegant, flamboyant and immensely popular, yet a perfect gentleman. Even in his last days, he had offered tips to youngsters. 

 POLLY UMRIGAR: He was a fearless hooker of 

 the ball, one of the finest to play the shot, and used to 

 step out and play the shot against the fast bowlers. He 

 was an attacking batsman right from the word go. He was 

 also a thorough gentleman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Superwoman Elena saluted

 Paris: France captain Georges Goven did not hesitate when asked the reason for his teams 2-3 defeat by Russia in the Fed Cup final at Roland Garros. 

Elena Dementieva, he told newsmen. 

The combative baseliner was indeed instrumental, winning both singles matches before teaming up with Dinara Safina to beat Amelie Mauresmo and Mary Pierce in the decisive doubles. 

Shes Superwoman, Goven said of the pony-tailed 23-year-old, who held her nerve throughout the weekend to inspire Russia to their second successive final win over France. 

The elegant Russian was the nearly woman of tennis last year, losing in the French and US Open finals to compatriots Anastasia Myskina and Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

This weekend, however, she did everything right, unlike Myskina, who had been the key to Russias triumph last year but lost both singles matches at Roland Garros. 

Nastya (Anastasia) may have lost but if she had not beaten Venus Williams (in the semi-final), we wouldnt have been here, Dementieva said. 

Its not my victory. Its a team effort. All the girls played their part. With a formidable line-up in former world No. 1 Mauresmo and Pierce, a finalist at this years French and US Open, and the support of a partisan crowd, the home team was full of hope. 

Amelie and Mary did not fail but the Russians were just too strong, Goven said.

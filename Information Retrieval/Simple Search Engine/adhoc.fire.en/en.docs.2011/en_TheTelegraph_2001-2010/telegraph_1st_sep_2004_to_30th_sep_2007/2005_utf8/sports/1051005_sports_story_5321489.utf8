 Sania strolls into second round

 - Indian downs Castellvi in straight sets 

Tokyo: Sania Mirza began her Japan Open campaign with a crushing 6-1, 6-3 win over Puerto Ricos Vilmarie Castellvi on Tuesday. 

The eighth seed looked at home in her first senior match in Japan, taking less than one hour to wrap up victory. 

It was a welcome victory for the 18-year-old Sania, who suffered early losses in her two previous appearances ? in Bali and the Sunfeast Open in Calcutta. 

Im human, said Sania, who won her first WTA Tour title in her home city of Hyderabad in February. I hit some good shots and I made some errors. No one can play perfect tennis all the time but its great the way I played today. 

The 18-year-old, who has achieved cult status in India through her on-court energy and colourful ear-rings and T-shirt, next takes on Japans Aiko Nakamura. 

Nakamura beat last years runner-up Mashona Washington 6-7, 6-1, 6-1. 

Top seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia overcame Colombias Catalina Castano 6-2, 7-6 while fifth seed Ai Sugiyama beat Russian Alina Jidkova 6-1, 7-6. 

No. 4 seed Maria Kirilenko of Russia, who won her first career title in Beijing two weeks ago, beat 15-year-old Japanese Ayumi Morita on her professional debut 6-4, 6-4. 

Sixth seed Gisela Dulko of Argentina was stretched by Su-Wei Hsieh of Chinese Taipei before coming through 2-6, 7-5, 6-2. 

Jill Craybas defeated fellow-American Jamea Jackson 1-6, 6-1, 6-1 to also make the round of 16. 

The seeds continued to fall in the mens draw with American Vince Spadea and Czech pair Ivo Minar and Robin Vik bowing out in the second round. 

Eighth seed Spadea was beaten 4-6, 5-7 by German Bjoern Phau while No. 14 Minar lost 4-6, 2-6 to Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus. 

Vik, seeded 15th, was thrashed 2-6, 4-6 by American Kevin Kim. 

Australian Open champion Marat Safin, Briton Tim Henman and Argentines Gaston Gaudio and David Nalbandian all pulled out of the tournament through injury. 

French Open finalist Mariano Puerta was elevated to top seed.

 New Delhi: The Professional Golfers? Association of India (PGAI) has launched a ?Hall of Fame? and held its first award function here on Thursday night. 

 Among the first to be honoured was Calcutta?s Basad Ali who holds the record of maximum wins in a season.

 The others were Billoo Sethi, who won the Indian Open as an amateur; Rohtas Singh, winner of over 100 tournaments in a career spanning 35 years; and Ranjit Nanda, India?s first and arguably the best golf course architect.

 London: Mark Philippoussis of Australia, James Blake and a group of up-and-coming Americans were on Friday handed wild cards into the main draw of the US Open starting later this month.

 Philippoussis, runner-up in New York in 1998, has slumped from a high of number eight to 202 in the world because of injury and no longer qualifies for top-flight events through his ranking.

 Blake is currently ranked 70th, but had been ranked 107 and missed direct acceptance at the time of the entry deadline.

 They are joined by Jan-Michael Gambill, Brian Baker, Scoville Jenkins, Rajeev Ram, Bobby Reynolds and Donald Young in the main draw of the August 29-September 11 grand slam.

 London: Ghana midfielder Michael Essien has passed a medical and agreed personal terms with Chelsea, the English champions said on Friday. Chelsea said in a statement that a club record fee ? put at 38 million euros ($46.47 million) by Essien?s former club Olympique Lyon ? had been agreed.

 Essien has secured a work permit and the club is awaiting international clearance for the 22-year-old to play, potentially on Sunday at home to Arsenal.

 The protracted transfer was marked by the reluctance of Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas to lose the player but Essien stated his desire to join Chelsea.

 Helsinki: Former Blackburn Rovers, Inter Milan and Switzerland coach Roy Hodgson signed a contract on Friday to become the coach of Finland?s national team in just under a year?s time, the Finnish football association said.

 Hodgson, who is currently at Norway?s Viking Stavanger, will take over from interim coach Jyrki Heliskoski on August 1, 2006 as Finland start their qualifying campaign for the European championship in 2008 in Austria and Switzerland.

 Zagreb: Striker Ivica Olic will miss Croatia?s remaining World Cup qualifiers after suffering a serious knee injury in Wednesday?s 1-1 friendly draw against Brazil. The CSKA Moscow forward will have to undergo surgery and will be out of action for at least six months, the a Croatian newspaper quoted a team doctor as saying.

 Lisbon: Benfica defender Miguel Monteiro has joined Valencia of Spain on a five-year contract, the Lisbon club said on Thursday. The 25-year-old, who cancelled an extension of his contract to 2008 with the Portuguese champions, will complete the move after medical tests.

 MacGill takes a dig at selectors

Sydney: Stuart MacGill, who watched helplessly as Australia crashed to a Ashes series defeat to England, said his omission from the team made no sense. 

The leg-spinner, who has taken 160 wickets in 33 Tests, went through the entire Ashes series without receiving a word of explanation from selectors about why he was overlooked for all five Tests. 

MacGill looked on as Englands batsmen showed a dislike for the turning ball with fellow wrist-spinner Shane Warne snaring 40 wickets. 

MacGill said the selectors decision not to choose him was a mystery. There was no explanation whatsoever, he said. 

Warney took 40 wickets when hes supposed to be past it. He had 16 wickets in two Tests, before the (third) Old Trafford Test, when I thought I might have a good chance of getting in there somewhere. None of it made much sense to me, MacGill said. 

Im looking at the tour now in two ways. There was the cricket side of it and the general experience. 

If I remove cricket from the tour, it was great. It was a nine-week, well-paid holiday. Obviously, I wish it hadnt been that way, but it was. If you add cricket into the mix, it was a debacle, said MacGill. 

I was sitting there watching us go downhill without being able to help. 

MacGill said the gruelling workload on Warne took its toll on the champion leg-spinner by the fifth and final Test at The Oval earlier this month. 

The workload that Warney had during the series ... You just cant expect someone to carry the attack, statistically and physically, MacGill said. Its a big mental drain. There was obviously some conservative thinking there and some nerves in the decision-making. 

I can understand it to a point, particularly when you consider that maybe my forte isnt keeping the runs down, but thinking like that isnt how you win Test matches. 

MacGill and Warne are likely to be paired on the spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground when Australia play the Super Series Test against the World XI from October 14.

 Indians have an off-day

London: Indian cricketers had a miserable day in office playing for their County sides on Sunday. 

Sourav Ganguly managed only 18 as Glamorgan were thrashed by Hampshire by seven wickets in a National League fixture at the Rose Bowl. 

Glamorgan made 211 for seven with Robert Croft scoring 88. Hampshire achieved the target quite comfortably. 

In Southgate, Irfan Pathans one wicket cost 61 runs. He, however, finished on the winning side as Middlesex beat Nottinghamshire by 31 runs. Middlesex made 314 for five, with P. Weekes blasting a century and Scott Styris hitting 82, before dismissing Notts for 283. 

Dinesh Mongias side Leicestershire overhauled Warwickshires 217 for six with seven wickets to spare, but the Indian made just eight.

 Panel for experimental rules introduction

Mumbai: The technical committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday suggested the introduction of the experimental one-day rules, including the soccer-like substitution, in domestic limited-overs games in the forthcoming season. 

The Sunil Gavaskar-led committee has also recommended to the BCCIs working committee for approving the introduction of light meters in all domestic matches. 

The committee has recommended that standard playing conditions of the International Cricket Council (ICC) for one-dayers, including the recently introduced experimental rules, be incorporated in all domestic one-day matches. It has also recommended the introduction of a third umpire, a BCCI source said. 

Board secretary Nair said a decision on this matter could be taken only after the finalisation of television rights for cricket coverage, including domestic matches. 

After the meeting, Gavaskar said that the BCCI was rich enough to implement the introduction of the third umpire in domestic cricket. 

The committee also decided to retain the point system in Ranji Trophy and other league stage matches though there was a clamour for making changes in it at the last conclave of Ranji captains and coaches in Mumbai. 

The committee suggested that the U-17 domestic tournament be also played on the lines of the U-19 and Ranji events, on a two-tier basis (elite and plate divisions), the source said. 

Moreover, the technical committee wants the introduction of the formula conceived for rain-marred domestic one-dayers by Kerala-based Jayadevan instead of the internationally followed Duckworth-Lewis method as it was felt to be more accurate. 

Jayadevan would be invited to explain his method in detail during the pre-season umpires workshop to be organised by the BCCI later this month in Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune. The committee also wants penalties for level I and level II offences be introduced in domestic circuit as per the ICCs code of Conduct.

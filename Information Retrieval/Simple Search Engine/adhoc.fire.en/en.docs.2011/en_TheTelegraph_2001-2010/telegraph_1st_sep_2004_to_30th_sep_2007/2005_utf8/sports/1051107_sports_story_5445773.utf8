Calcutta: V.V.S. Laxman made a hurricane visit to the city on Sunday. 

The stylish Hyderabadi, who was scheduled to arrive on Saturday, was the chief guest of the Mahindra Scorpio Speedster contest held at Deshapriya Park, the finalists of which would be announced on Monday. 

After rushing in late, Laxman refused to interact with the media. I am not speaking to anybody, and it is same here, is all that he said. 

The event was poorly managed and the organisers did everything to make life miserable for the media.

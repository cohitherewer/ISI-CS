The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pollock likely to be back

Antigua: South Africa all-rounder Shaun Pollock could return to the side for the fourth and final Test against the West Indies, which starts Friday. 

Pollock has missed South Africa?s last five Tests and three one-day Internationals because of chronic inflammation of his left ankle. 

?Even if he can give us 10 of 15 overs a day, that would be good,? South Africa coach Ray Jennings told reporters Wednesday. 

Jennings hinted there may be a ready made place for Pollock in the team. 

?Monde (Zondeki) has a bit of a niggle with his thigh, and ?Nella? (Andre Nel) has a sore back,? he said. ?I can?t see more than one change in our team for the match.?

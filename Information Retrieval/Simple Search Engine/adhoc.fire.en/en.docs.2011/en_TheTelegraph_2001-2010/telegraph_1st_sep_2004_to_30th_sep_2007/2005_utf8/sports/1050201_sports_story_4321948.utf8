 McGrath, Warne hold key: Marsh

 McGrath 

Melbourne: Former Australian Test wicketkeeper-turned England selector Rodney Marsh believes veteran paceman Glenn McGrath and leg-spinner Shane Warne hold the key to Australia?s hopes in the upcoming Ashes tour. 

Marsh, also the director of England?s National Cricket Academy, was not prepared to back the host nation to break Australia?s 16-year stranglehold on the Ashes, but said England?s cricket culture was stronger than ever. 

The two sides play a five-Test series starting at Lord?s in July. 

Marsh said Australia?s strengths lay in the extraordinary talents of ?keeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist and the experienced McGrath and Warne. 

But he warned that the complexion of the series would change if both bowlers were hit by injury. 

?If you want to talk about the fundamental difference between the two teams you?ve just got to look at Warne and McGrath, with a thousand Test match wickets (between them), and then you go wherever you want to go,? he said on Sunday. 

Warne, 35, and McGrath, 34, are fit after making successful returns from long lay-offs. 

But Marsh said Australia could not afford to lose the pair, as it had struggled without them in recent series. 

England beat Australia in the fifth Test of the 2002-03 series, when Warne and McGrath were injured. Australia lacked firepower against India last summer with both bowlers out. 

?The question that?s going to be asked of me a thousand times between now and whenever that Test series starts, is ?who?s going to win the Ashes??,? Marsh said. 

He said it was impossible to predict, because if McGrath and Warne were unfit it might make a huge difference. 

?If (England quick Steve) Harmison only gets nine wickets for the series or whatever, that?ll make a huge difference; if (England allrounder Andrew) Flintoff?s not fit, that?ll make a huge difference.? 

England are now ranked second in Tests behind Australia. Their 2-1 win over South Africa was their fourth straight series triumph in the past year. (AFP)

 PCB missive to ICC

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to include its representatives in future committees, be it to select a World XI or to pick players for annual awards. 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan on Friday sent a letter to ICC president Ehsan Mani, demanding representation and have also advised its director, (cricket operations) Saleem Altaf, currently in Dubai, to take up the matter in the chief executives meeting starting from Friday. We have asked the ICC to include Pakistan representatives in future committees, PCBs director, (board operations) Abbas Zaidi said. 

The PCB rushed its letter after a public and media outrage, following Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haqs exclusion from the World XI for the Super Series against Australia in Australia. 

Mani, a Pakistan nominee for ICC presidentship, told a television channel that Inzamams exclusion had also surprised him. But the selection committee acted independently and tried to pick best players for the prestigious event, he said.

 Johl slips to tied 17th

 Terry Pilkadaris of Australia chips onto the green on Day II of the Brunei Open on Friday 

Bandar Seri Begawan: Amandeep Johl was unable to hold on to a great start as he carded one-under 70 and slipped in latter stages of his second round at the inaugural $ 300,000 Brunei Open here Friday. 

Johl was five-under for two days and the best among the six Indians who made cut. He was tied for 17th on a steamy day. 

Meanwhile, Malaysian Danny Chia held the chasing pack at bay with a second round of five-under-par 66 to lead by one stroke at the halfway stage. 

Chia, who plays the British Open next month shrugged off his first bogey of the week with four birdies and an eagle at the impressive Empire Hotel and Country Club to lead on 13-under-par 129. 

He held off fast charging Australians Terry Pilkadaris and Jarrod Lyle, who shot matching 63s. Another Malaysian surprise, Steven Tan and upcoming Thai star Prom Meesawat share fourth place on 134. 

Six of the 10 Indians made the cut. They are Johl (tied 17th), Gaurav Ghei and Ashok Kumar (tied 24th), Firoze Ali and Digvijay Singh (tied 44th) and Uttam Singh Mundy (tied 63rd). Those missing the cut were Arjun Singh, Harmeet Kahlon and Shiv Kapur, while Gurbaaz Mann withdrew after his first round 81. 

Johl was four-under after six holes started from the tenth tee. He had three birdies in a row to jump to third place at one stage. He added a fourth birdie on the 15th to raise visions of a great finish. But then came the dampener as he dropped a shot each on the 16th and 18th. 

Yet, he seemed to catch up with a birdie on second, when he began his second nine. However, two successive bogeys on the next two holes followed by another seventh spoilt what could have been a great card. He did birdie the sixth in between to end up at one-under for the day and five-under for two days for tied 17th place, the best among Indians. 

Ghei had three birdies and three bogeys in his even par card, while Ashok birdied sixth and ninth, but bogeyed the 13th and 14th for a par round of 71. Both Ghei and Ashok are tied for 24th place. 

Digvijay Singh had three birdies and two bogeys in his one-under 70, his second such card for tied 44th place. He shares the place with Firoze Ali, who had two birdies and three bogeys in his 72. 

Uttam Singh Mundy squeezed inside the cut line with two birdies and two bogeys for a second straight par round, as the cut came at even par. Arjun Singh despite a fine streak of an eagle on 16th followed by birdies on 17th and 18th failed to make the cut by one stroke. (PTI)

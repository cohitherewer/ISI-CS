 Sania Mirza goes down tamely

New Delhi: Sania Mirza failed to rediscover the same magic which helped her vanquish some of the best in the business in the last few months as she bowed out in the first round of the $3.1 million Nasdaq-100 Open WTA Tour meet in Miami. 

According to information received here, the 18-year-old Indian went down 2-6, 5-7 to Spaniard Maria Sanchez Lorenzo in an hour and 13 minutes on Thursday. 

Playing as a wild card, Sania struggled with her serves ? committing eight doubles-faults ? and faced as many as 10 break-points of which Lorenzo converted seven. 

The 77th-ranked Indian failed to hold serve in the first set and the two games she won were by breaking her opponent, who is ranked 88. 

Sania put up a better show in the second set but was still erratic with her serves. She lost her serve thrice and broke Lorenzo twice. 

The Hyderabadi has had a fine run this year as she became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam and win a wta Tour title at the Hyderabad Open. 

Another wild card entrant Neha Uberoi, the younger sister of Shikha, went down 4-6, 2-6 to Russian Galina Voskoboeva 4-6, 2-6.

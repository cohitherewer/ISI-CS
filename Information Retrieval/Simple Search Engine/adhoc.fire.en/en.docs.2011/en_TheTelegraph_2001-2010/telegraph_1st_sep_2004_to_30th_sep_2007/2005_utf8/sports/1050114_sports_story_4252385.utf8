 Koya offers ?dissidents? final chance

Kozhikode: All India Chess Federation (AICF) secretary and Fide vice-president P.T. Ummer Koya Thursday offered a final opportunity to players to return to the board. 

Koya?s offer comes in the wake of the stand-off between the AICF and the newly-formed Chess Players Association of India (CPAI). 

?They are only about 35 in number and wanted the 4000-member federation to recognise them as an all-India association which is impractical,? Koya said about the ?dissidents?. 

?The players, who are making such a hue and cry would not have reached such prominence had the federation not come forward to promote them,? he remarked. 

Hitting out at GMs Abhijit Kunte, Surya Sekhar Ganguly, P. Harikrishna and Sandipan Chanda for openly showing their dissent against the federation by wearing black badges at an international tournament in Pune last year, he said ?this is a clear attempt to divide the federation and scuttle its ongoing efforts to promote the sports.? 

?The next AICF meeting, scheduled to be held in Raipur in March, will take up the issue of players? indiscipline,? he informed. (PTI)

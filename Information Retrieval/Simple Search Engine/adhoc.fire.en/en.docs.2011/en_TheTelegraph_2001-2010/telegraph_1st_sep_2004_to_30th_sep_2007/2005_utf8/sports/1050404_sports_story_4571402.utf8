 Haryana lift crown

Gurgaon: Haryana lifted the Ranji Trophy plate division title with a comprehensive 306-run victory over Services here on Sunday. 

Haryana, who had set a 464-run target, took just 55.4 overs to bowl out Services in their second innings for 157 and clinch the crown. 

Resuming at 76 for three, the visitors lasted less than a session on the final day as off-spinner Gaurav Vashisht claimed four for 31. Leg-spinner Amit Mishra finished with three for 46. 

Services lost the first wicket this morning with the addition of just three runs to their overnight score when K.G. Chawda (1) was trapped by Joginder Sharma. 

There was no stopping the Haryana bowlers though Services tried to stem the rot through a 43-run stand between S Upadhaya (16) and Yashpal Singh (58). 

Despite the loss, Services had some consolation since both the finalists qualified to play in the elite division next season.

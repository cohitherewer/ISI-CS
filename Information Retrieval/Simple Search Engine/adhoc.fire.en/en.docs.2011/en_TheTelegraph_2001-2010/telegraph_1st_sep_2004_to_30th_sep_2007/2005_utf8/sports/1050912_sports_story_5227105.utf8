 Federers ninth straight victory over Hewitt 

 - What better final could I wish for, asks world No. 1 

 Roger Federer after his semi-final win over Lleyton Hewitt at Flushing Meadow on Sunday 

New York: Champion Roger Federer battled past third seed Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3 on Saturday to reach the US Open final. 

Australian Hewitt, the champion in 2001, fought well to win the third set but world No. 1 Federer rebounded to set up a final against 35-year-old American Andre Agassi, the seventh seed. 

Agassi outlasted unseeded American Robby Ginepri 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

Federer said he could not have asked for a more delectable match-up than facing the eight-time Grand Slam title winner. Im looking forward to it, obviously, he said. What better final could I wish for? 

The 24-year-old Swiss raised his brilliant all-court game when challenged, rebuffing five set points in the second set and sweeping the tie-break as he overcame his toughest test in this years tournament in continuing his mastery over Hewitt. 

Federer, who beat the Australian in last years final, made it nine victories in a row over Hewitt, including all five times they have met in Grand Slam events. 

Hewitt, fighting valiantly and resisting annoyance over more than 10 foot faults called against him in the match, ended a run of 17 consecutive losing sets against Federer by using a service break in the seventh game of the third set to extend the match. 

Federer, however, broke Hewitt in the sixth game at love to take a 4-2 lead and then served out the match, clinching it when the Australian struck a backhand long. 

Hewitt said he believed he had a chance to end his losing streak. I felt like I could go toe to toe with him, said the 24-year-old Australian, the 2001 Open champion, who lost last years final to Federer. 

Hes a hell of a shot-maker, the best Ive ever seen. He can pull the trigger from anywhere on the court. 

The victory added to an extraordinary season for Federer, who improved his 2005 match record to 70-3, his season hard court record to 44-1 and his current hard court winning streak to 34. 

Ginepri twice fought back from a set down but the 35-year-old recovered to reach his sixth US Open final. 

Im in the finals, its awesome, said Agassi, the oldest man to reach a Grand Slam final since 39-year-old Ken Rosewall made the US Open final in 1974. 

You never know when its going to be your last match, and you just want to give it your all, and in the fifth set I got lucky on a couple of shots and made it. 

The 22-year-old Ginepri, who won three consecutive five-set battles to reach the last four, dropped his serve in the opening game and though he levelled at 3-3, Agassi broke again to take the opening set. 

Agassi, champion in 1994 and 1999, began to make uncharacteristic errors on his backhand and Ginepri snatched the vital break in the 12th game of the second set to level the match. 

 Just as it looked like Ginepri might build on his 

 momentum, though, he was forced to run more and more by 

 the accuracy and power of Agassi, who broke twice to regain 

 the lead. (REUTERS)

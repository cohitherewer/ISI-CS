The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We must raise game: Langer

Northampton: Justin Langer said Australia must raise their game if they want to retain the Ashes during the fourth Test. 

The series resumes at Trent Bridge on Thursday with the teams locked at 1-1. But an Australia victory in Nottingham would leave them one-up with just one match in the five-Test series to play and so ensure they retain the Ashes, which they have possessed since 1989. 

But with England having won the second Test at Edgbaston and then being denied a 2-1 lead at Old Trafford by a last-wicket stand, Langer knows plenty of hard work lies ahead of Australia who, he readily admitted, were facing their biggest challenge in years. 

We want to win the Ashes or, at least, we dont want to lose the Ashes. Unfortunately, whoever wins or loses is a long way down the track. Maybe weve just got a bit distracted by what could happen in a few weeks time, said Langer, who stood-in as skipper in place of Ricky Ponting during the drawn two-day game against Northamptonshire. 

Asked about a lapse in Australias intensity, he replied: I would suggest it hasnt been at the cut-throat edge that were used to playing at. Weve played periods of very good cricket, but in Tests, particularly when you play good teams like England, you cant afford to be just playing it in periods. (AFP)

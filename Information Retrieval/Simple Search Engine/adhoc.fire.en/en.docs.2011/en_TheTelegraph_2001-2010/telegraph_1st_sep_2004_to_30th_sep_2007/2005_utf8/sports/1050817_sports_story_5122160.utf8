 Astle puts NZ in command 

Bulawayo: Nathan Astle struck an unbeaten 116 to put New Zealand in command against Zimbabwe after the second day of the second Test at Queens Sports Club on Tuesday. 

Astles 11th Test century helped the tourists reach 454 for seven at close in reply to Zimbabwes first innings of 231. 

The 33-year-old hit 19 fours in 192 balls in a well-paced knock while opener Lou Vincents 92 and captain Stephen Flemings 65 were the other main contributions in New Zealands batting performance. 

Fleming became the first New Zealander to reach 6,000 Test runs during a third-wicket stand of 137 with Vincent. 

Heath Streak, Blessing Mahwire and debutant Keith Dabengwa took two wickets each for Zimbabwe. 

New Zealand, who lead the two-Test series 1-0, resumed on their overnight 48 for two and piled up a further 406 runs on a flat pitch against a mediocre Zimbabwean attack.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?m ready for the task: Amritraj Jr

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: It has been 17 years since Vijay Amritraj played his last Davis Cup match for India. His straight-set defeat by Slobodan Zivojinovic allowed Yugoslavia get away to a 3-2 victory in the opening round of World Group play in March 1988. 

In the time since then, Amritraj did not get an opportunity to watch Davis Cup in the capital. On Thursday, he turned up at the R.K. Khanna Stadium to be at hand to see son Prakash prepare for the Asia-Oceania group I tie against China. The lure of the grasscourt made the years fall away and made him sink deep in nostalgia. 

Dressed in a natty suit, he stood behind the baseline with another Indian tennis legend Akhtar Ali and kept an eye on the 21-year-old. ?I am looking forward to watching Prakash play on grass,? Vijay said as his son tried his hand at the serve-and-volley game. 

He may have used dark glasses to shield his eyes from the sun but it was easy to make out that he was a little concerned about how Prakash encountered trouble when Harsh Mankad came up with good service returns. 

Prakash was excited that his father would be cheering for him from the stands. ?I have heard so many stories about dad?s Davis Cup play. I am happy he will be at hand to watch me play,? he said. ?It is great to be able to learn from Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi. I feel I am ready for the task.? 

Prakash appears to have a good chance of sealing a maiden win after four successive losses in Davis Cup play. The 361-ranked Indian believes he is ready to taste success when he squares up against WanYu Jr, who is ranked 48 rungs below him. 

On Thursday, a day before the tie, the buzz associated with a Davis Cup match in the Capital may have been missing but the debonair Vijay Amritrajs presence lent a certain aura to the bonhomie in the Indiancamp.

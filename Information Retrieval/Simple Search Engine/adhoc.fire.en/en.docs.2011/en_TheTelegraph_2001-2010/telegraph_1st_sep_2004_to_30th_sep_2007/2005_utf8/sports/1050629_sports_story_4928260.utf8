 - Jr world cup hockey 

 Sandeep Singh 

Rotterdam: Boasting four Ol-ympians in their ranks, defending champions India wear the tag of favourites to win the Rabobank junior mens World Cup hockey tournament commencing here on Wednesday. 

The Indians received a shot in the arm a couple of weeks earlier when they convincingly won a four-nation tournament that included The Netherlands, Spain and Chile. 

Coach Harendra Singh reflected the high morale and confidence of his team when he expressed optimism of a strong performance here, much like the Indians did in Hobart four years earlier. 

We have a good mix of experience and youth and looking at the draw, I am confident of a good performance here, he said on the eve of the tournament that concludes July 10. 

Apart from the four Olympians ? skipper and goalkeeper Adrian DSouza, defenders Sandeep Singh and William Xalco and forward Adam Sinclair ? half-backs V.S. Vinay and Vivek Gupta, and forwards Tushar Khandekar and Hari Prasad, took part in the 2004 Champions Trophy in Lahore. These youngsters have greatly benefited by the exposure at the senior level. 

The Indians begin their campaign with an outing against Egy-pt on Wednesday and take on Poland the following day.

 Atwal misses out by whisker

 Arjun Atwal was two strokes short 

Westerville (Ohio): Arjun Atwal played a superb round of five-under 67 in the qualifiers here, but still failed to make it to the US Open by just two strokes. 

The qualifier was played at the par-72 Brookside Golf and Country Club and the Lakes Golf and Country Club where Atwal had a first round of par 72 which made things difficult. 

The last qualifier from Ohio, which had 144 players for 20 spots, was at seven-under 137, just two shots clear of Atwal. 

Daniel Chopra, also playing in the same qualifier, withdrew after his first round of three-over 75. 

Also booking a place from Brookside was two-time US Masters champion Bernhard Langer, who earned an Open spot for the 20th time. 

Ted Purdy, a former Hero Honda Masters winner in 1997, also made it. Purdy had rounds of 69 and 67 to finish at eight-under at Brookside, where the top finisher was Australian Geoff Ogilvy with rounds of 67 and 64. 

Others to progress were 1986 US PGA champion Bob Tway and multiple PGA Tour winners John Cook and Scott McCarron, but Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal, Swede Jesper Parnevik and former major winners Paul Azinger and Jeff Sluman missed out. 

At the qualifiers in Rockville, Maryland, Olin Browne fired a sizzling 59 to secure a berth. Browne, who has two PGA Tour victories, sealed his spot with a birdie-eagle-eagle finish for a 36 hole total of 10-under 132. 

J.P. Hayes topped the field of 156 with a two-round score of 13-under 129. Former PGA champion Steve Elkington of Australia, Tommy Armour III and Rocky Mediate also earned spots. 

However, Tom Kite, winner of the 1992 US Open at Pebble Beach and Mark Meara, US Masters and British Open champion in 1998, failed in their last bid to secure a place in the field. 

Also carried over was the qualifier at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta, Georgia where 77 players ? including former US amateur champions Matt Kuchar and local favourite Derek Brown of North Carolina ? were battling it out for six berths. 

Both men carded final rounds of 66 to advance, Brown leading the way with nine-under 131 while Kuchar clinched the sixth and final spot with a 135 total. 

This year, for the first time, two of the sectional qualifiers were international. Kobe hosted a qualifier eight days ago when Australias Steven Conran, South Koreas Yang Yong-eun and Keiichiro Fukabori of Japan secured the three spots available. 

On Monday, Tadworth, on the outskirts of London, staged another with former Asian Tour graduate Simon Dyson qualifying. He finished third out of 53 players who wre fighting for nine spots. Others to qualify were New Zealands Michael Campbell and Swedes Peter Hanson and Robert Karlsson. (Agencies)

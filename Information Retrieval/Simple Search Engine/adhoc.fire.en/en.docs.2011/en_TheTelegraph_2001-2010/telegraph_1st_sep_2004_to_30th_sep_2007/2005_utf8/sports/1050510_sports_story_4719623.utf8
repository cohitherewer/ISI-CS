 Nadal makes it 3 in-a-row

 - Coria beaten in five-setter 

Rome: Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal clinched his third title in a row by beating Argentine ninth seed Guillermo Coria 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 in a five-hour final at the Rome Masters on Sunday. 

It was a remarkable performance by the 18-year-old fifth seed, who fought back from 0-3 down in the deciding set despite needing treatment on a badly bruised and blistered racquet hand. 

?Im delighted. Today I played one of the toughest matches of my life,? the Spaniard said. ?When I was 0-3 down in the fifth I was out of it, but the public supported me and kept me in the match.? 

Nadal, who triumphed in Monte Carlo and in Barcelona before arriving in the Italian capital, has won five of his seven claycourt tournaments this season. 

His 17-match winning streak makes him one of the favourites for the French Open, which starts in Paris on May 23, but he preferred to play down his chances at the Grand Slam event. 

?Every time I win a match, I seem to be the favourite for Roland Garros,? he said. ?I played well today, but I dont know if I will play so well in two weeks time.? 

Coria, the most dangerous claycourt player in the world 12 months ago, began strongly and took advantage of mistakes by Nadal to break in the fifth game. 

A couple of misjudged attempts to serve-and-volley, however, allowed his opponent to level at 4-4. 

As Coria served to stay in the set when trailing 4-5, a double fault gave the Spaniard a break point, which he converted with a crosscourt winner. 

In the second set, the players traded early breaks before Coria conjured up a superb pass down the line to break Nadal in the seventh game. 

The Argentine broke again in the ninth to level the match at one set all but, instead of lifting his game, he then made a series of unforced errors to allow the Spaniard to race into a 5-1 lead in the third.

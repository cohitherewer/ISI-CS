 Under-19 World Cup in Lanka

Dubai: The ICC Under-19 World Cup will be held in Sri Lanka from February 5-19 next year with 16 teams in the fray. 

The decision was taken on Monday at an ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meeting. The committee also made progress on the six-year revised schedule for international cricket, moving away from the previous five-year programme. 

We have worked through initial drafts and all the countries will now be given an opportunity to comment on a revised six-year plan, said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed in a press release. 

Once we have received comments from the countries, the matter will be considered by the ICC board at its next meeting in Australia in October. 

The meeting also decided that the trial one-day International rules concerning replacement of players and fielding restrictions would apply in the Super Series in Australia as well. 

The CEC, where India was represented by BCCI secretary S.K. Nair, also reviewed a proposal from the organisers of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi for including cricket and referred the matter to the board. (PTI)

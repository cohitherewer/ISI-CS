 Nayeemuddin favourite

New Delhi: Syed Nayeemuddin, who has held the post of Indian football coach twice before, is the front-runner again when interviews to decide on the successor to Sukhwinder Singh take place here on Friday. 

Five individuals, including former internationals Subrata Bhattacharya and Aloke Mukherjee, have been invited to appear before the four-member expert committee. But Nayeem, a leading defender for the national side in the sixties and seventies, appears to be the favourite to land the top job in Indian football for a third time. 

The All India Football Federation had invited applications after the national sides dismal performances on the tours to Pakistan and Fiji. 

The present coach, Sukhwinder Singh too is technically not out of reckoning after he met federation chief Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi to explain the sides poor display under him and spell out his vision for football in the country.

 - Adjusting to conditions not a problem, says Arjun Atwal

New Delhi: The popular bet is on an Indian winning the title but a no-nonsensical Thai could walk away with all the glory on Sunday at the Hero Honda Indian Open Golf Championship that tees-off at the Delhi Golf Club (DGC) on Thursday. 

While Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa ? the countrys top golfers, whose presence has added an extra flavour to the $300,000 event ? were punting on each other, 39-year-old Thaworn Wiratchant was cooling his heels in his hotel room after a rigorous morning practice session. 

It is not just me or Arjun (Atwal) but any of the local guys including Shiv Kapur and Ashok Kumar can do it. They know the fairways well and that is the key, Randhawa said at the event-eve press conference.Wiratchant was part of the Asian team that won the Dynasty Cup in 2003 and 2005. 

But both Atwal and Randhawa have been playing their best golf. Atwal has had a breakthrough year on the US PGA Tour with four top-10 finishes, including a best of tied-second to secure next years card while Randhawa stands third on the Asian Tour money list. 

The two also know the course as well as the back of their hands, Atwal having won the Hero Honda Masters here in 2003, and Randhawa having claimed three titles including the 2000 edition of the Indian Open. 

But Randhawa was happy with the conditions of the green and the fairways.It is playing its full length, thanks to the monsoons. That should help a bit the long hitter. And it is the fastest that DGC has ever been. 

Atwal agreed. with Randhawas assessment.You cant get aggressive off the tees? you have to get decent lengths and not hit drivers that much, he said. 

The first Indian to play on the US PGA felt that adjusting to the conditions of DGC would not be a problem. 

Moving from quick to slow courses is not that tough, and I have played here so many times so it comes easily, said Atwal, who would be playing in his first event in a months time. 

The 32-year old Atwal had a practice round with Indian cricket legend Kapil Dev in the morning but said he still felt the jet lag. It remains to be seen whether Atwal is able to shake off the tiredness. He would have been better off with an early morning start than the 11.30 am tee-off that he has been given. 

In Atwals company would be defending champion Mardan Mamat of Singapore. Mamat has had an ordinary season on the Asian Tour, missing the cut six times and with only two top-10 finishes in 18 starts. One guy who would be looking to pull the rug from under the favourites feet is Ashok Kumar, easily the best caddie-turned-golfer in contemporary Indian golf. 

From the days of being accused of stealing and being rescued by Amit Luthra, a former No. 1 amateur, Kumar has come a long way. 

He was the golfer of the year in 2003 and also has the credit of breaking Mukesh Kumars winning streak. 

He pocketed six titles last season, and although this season he has had only one crown, Kumar is hoping to improve on that at the Indian Open. 

Normally those in the lead make mistakes on the last day and slip. So I am looking to make less mistakes on Sunday. I am looking at winning the tournament, said Kumar. Mamat found some form ahead of the big event as he romped to victory in the Pro-Am event at the DGC on Wednesday. 

The Mamat teams winning score of 26 under par was in a big way due to the efforts of his amateur partners, but it showed that the Singaporean still retains a magic touch at the famous venue.I feel pretty relaxed. As the defending champion you do feel you have a responsibility to play well but I just want to go out there and play my best, Mamat said. 

Of course, one more win would be nice but I dont want to put pressure on myself and feel I needto win so badly.

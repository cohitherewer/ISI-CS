 Magical Strike proved a point 

 STAR RACER

 Magical Strike had a point to prove on Thursday last, and trainer Daniel David did it in style. On the opening day of the season, Common Spirit had taken Magical Strike, the favourite, considerably wide at the final turn. The move had not only ruined Magical Strike winning chances, it had also provided the ultimate victor El Cid, a stablemate of Common, a wide galloping room along the rails. Incidentally, the RCTC stipes and stewards had failed to notice jockey Md Amils (Common Spirit) mischief on that occasion. 

 On that day Magical Strike won the 1,400m Sophisticated Lady Handicap drawing away from the field, in spite of losing some ground at the start. He, thus, went on to prove that he would have delivered the goods had his ground not taken by Common Spirit on the previous occasion. 

 Flossys one-length victory on the opening day had confirmed her good looks should be in harmony with the form. The Javed Khan-trainee picked up from where she had left, on Day I of the season, scoring another facile win against an opposition, which looked stronger on paper but not tuned to perfection. 

 It was High Chief who attracted pots of money in the 1,000m Allaying Handicap but the Errol Bhungard-trainee failed after matching steps with Flossy till top of the turn. So much so, the lowly-weighted Pearl Dragon successfully displaced a dying out Chief in the closing stages of the race. However, this run may help the favourite get into the shape.

 Castle Moon has always been a dangerous proposition over a 1,000m scurry and the light impost 47-kg helped the Deepak Karki-mare shoot straight into a businesslike five-length lead from the start. The long break, and no signs of weakening of the eight-year-old mare, demoralised the opposition in the Alibi Handicap, as she headed for a six-length victory. Positive Thinker was the best of the rest in an eight-horse field.

 Small Fry looked cut above the field in the 1,400m Desert Shot Cup. It, therefore, hardly came as a surprise when the Bharath Singh-trainee matched Castle Moons verdict at the wire. A heavily backed Thoughtful was never in the thick of the things while a totally neglected Native Son tested his speed early in the race to suggest that his turn is not far off over a shorter sprint.

 Autocop came to the city, last winter, with Classic aspirations but found some of the contemporary fillies from the leading stables too hot to touch. However, in the open Class, the Jaggy Dhariwal-trainee had shown form to indicate that she was a good handicap material over sprints. With only 48-kg on her back, it was, therefore, no difficult a task for apprentice Malcom Maseyk to dictate terms virtually from the start. The Burden of Proof-Traffic Police daughter won the way she liked from Sea Legend, Final Round and Mythical Start, who finished in the order named. Those who occupied the minor slots could profit from their outings.

 Frontier Flame could have tripped the hot favourite Mr Music in the 1,100m Golden Praise Handicap had the later maintained a straight course. The verdict between the two was a mere nose, and the objection lodged by the rider of the Flame, for infringement past the distance post, looked to be a fifty-fifty chance. The fact that the Flame had also taken the Music out when the heat was on, the stewards after some deliberations allowed the results to stand.

 Kumble into top-10 of ICC rankings

Dubai: The Chennai Test between India and Sri Lanka may have been ruined due to rain but there was still time for two of the worlds leading bowlers ? Anil Kumble and Chaminda Vaas ? to make upward moves in the International Cricket Council (ICC) player rankings. 

Leg-spinner Kumbles three for 41 lifted him up one place and into the top ten, while Vaas four for 20 from 21 overs moved the Sri Lankan up four places to fourth in the rankings released by the ICC on Wednesday. 

Kumble is now Indias only bowler in the top ten as left-arm pacer Irfan Pathan has slipped down two places to 11th spot. 

Vaas is one spot below Muttiah Muralidharan whose points tally has dropped by six despite taking two wickets in Chennai, and he now shares second spot with Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne. 

Warnes teammate Glenn McGrath remains the number one ranked bowler. 

There were no changes in the top ten batting slots in the LG-ICC player rankings with three Indian players ? Rahul Dravid (5th), Virender Sehwag (7th) and Sachin Tendulkar (10th) ? ensconced in that group. 

The newcomer in the list was Indian wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni who earned his Test cap in Chennai. 

He made a debut at number 94 in the batting list after making 30 in his first Test appearance.

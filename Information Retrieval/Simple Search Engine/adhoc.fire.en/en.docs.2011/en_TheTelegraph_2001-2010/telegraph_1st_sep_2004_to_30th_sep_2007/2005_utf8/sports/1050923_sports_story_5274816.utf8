 Dalmiya may not attend

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya isnt sure if he will be attending the AGM once it continues at 10 am on Friday, it was learnt. The CAB president said he will have to speak to representatives of his associations and seek their views. 

Dalmiya met Justice (retd) K.N. Singh and Justice (retd) M. Punchi late on Thursday evening. 

I will now inform my associations (CAB) about the outcome of this meeting and it is up to them to decide if they wish to move court against any of the decisions, said Dalmiya.

 Sasikiran in joint lead

Malmo: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran outclassed GM Curt Hansen of Denmark and jumped into joint lead after the end of the fourth round of Sigeman chess tournament here. 

With his second victory in the event, Sasikiran took his tally to three points and joined overnight leaders US? Hikaru Nakamura, Jan Timman of The Netherlands and Viorel Iordachescu at the top after all of them were held on Day IV. 

In fact, the day?s only victory was carved out by Sasikiran. In the previous round, the Indian was involved in the lone drawn encounter. 

Sasikiran displayed top form with white pieces against Hansen who seemed out-of-sorts in this very important game. Up against the Queen?s Gambit declined, Sasikiran employed a popular variation and quickly seized the initiative with fine deployment of pieces on the king side. 

The Dane made a desperate bid for counter play after losing a pawn but thoughtful moves in the final stages kept him at bay and Sasikiran clinched the issue in 49 moves. 

Nakamura remained as committed as ever in his duel with Hermansson but for once the Swede showed his grit in difficult situation in the endgame. 

Hermansson, to his credit, found a fantastic piece sacrifice and steered the game to a theoretical draw. The battle lasted 74 moves. 

Iordachescu failed to get a desirable position against Sune Berg Hansen in a Sicilian Nazdorf game where the former played white. Opting for one of the less played variations, Iordachescu allowed Hansen to get an easy equality and the players repeated moves to sign peace in 31 moves. 

In other games of the day, Hector drew an engrossing game with Palo after 41 moves while Timman got the same result against Persson in just 21 moves.

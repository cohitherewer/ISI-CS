The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania may get No. 2 seeding

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With the players list to be released in a day or two, the organisers of the WTA Tour tier III are trying hard to rope in at least another big name after world No. 14 Russian Anastasia Myskina has confirmed her participation a few days back. But it is still not certain, whether they would be successful in doing so. 

However, if that doesnt happen, Indian star Sania Mirza, the world No. 50, is tipped to be the second seed in the meet commencing on September 17 at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. If Myskina becomes top seed, Sania will be automatically second, a source associated with organising the meet, told The Telegraph, on Tuesday. 

Thailands Tamarine Tanasugarn, who is currently ranked 89th and Karolina Sprem of Croatia ranked 78th in the WTA rankings may be the third and fourth seeds, respectively. 

It has also been learnt that world No. 11 Mary Pierce of France may also join the fray as a wild card entrant. She is being sounded out but a clear picture will come out in a day or two, the source informed.

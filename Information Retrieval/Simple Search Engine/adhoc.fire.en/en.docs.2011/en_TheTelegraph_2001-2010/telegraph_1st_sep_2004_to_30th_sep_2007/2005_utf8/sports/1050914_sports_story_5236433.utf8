 Bangla caught in Murali web

 - FIRST TEST 

 Lanka declare on 370/9 

 Dilshan in Colombo on Tuesday 

Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan seized control of the first Test with two late wickets as Bangladesh slumped to 36 for three before rain forced the abandonment of the second days play here on Tuesday. 

Bangladesh need another 147 runs to make Sri Lanka bat again after the hosts declared on 370 for nine with fifties from Tillekeratne Dilshan (86), Thilan Samaraweera (78) and Mahela Jayawardene (63). 

Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar, top scorer in the first innings with 84, was unbeaten on 13 and Tushar Imran (0) was still on crease. 

Muralidharan bowled opener Shariar Nafees (13) and trapped Mohammad Ashraful leg before for a duck with his doosra in his first over, to leave the tourists reeling before bad light and then a torrential downpour stopped play 12 overs early. 

Fast bowler Lasith Malinga also struck early with the new ball as Javed Omar (nine) glanced a catch down the leg side and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara took a fine diving catch. Sri Lanka, replying to Bangladeshs 188, knocked off a 28-run first innings deficit during the morning and then consolidated their advantage, extending the lead to 182 before the declaration. 

Samaraweera anchored the Sri Lanka reply with a patient and determined 78 in a four-hour innings.

 Dream come true for Stosur, Draper

 - Australian Open mixed doubles final

 Scott Draper and Samantha Stosur in Melbourne on Sunday 

Melbourne: What began with a chance phone call ended in a dream come true for Scott Draper on Sunday as the Australian won his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open. 

The 30-year-old, who traded his tennis racket for a set of clubs when he made his professional golf debut on Thursday, teamed with compatriot Samantha Stosur to beat Zimbabwean Kevin Ullyett and Liezel Huber of South Africa 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (10-6) in the mixed doubles final. 

?This is some sort of dream come true,? Draper said. ?We?ve got a Grand Slam title now and no one can take that away from us. It?s just a great feeling. For me, it might never happen again. I?ll always cherish today.? 

Stosur was originally due to play with another Australian, Todd Reid, but when he pulled out on the eve of the event, she called Draper, who has a protected ranking after an injury-hit 2004. 

Draper answered the SOS call and the pair romped to victory in their first tournament together. ?I?ve had a blast this two weeks,? he said. ?The phone call from Sam was a beauty, and thanks to the organisers for a wildcard. That was a good decision.? 

Having worked hard on his golf game in recent months with a view to turning professional, Draper made his bow at the Victorian Open on Friday. And though his first experience of tournament golf ended in disappointment as he missed the halfway cut, his day job paid off as he and Stosur won their first Grand Slam title, having only entered the event with the aid of a wildcard. 

?I?m just glad that it worked out the way it did,? he said. ?I was very excited about the possibility of winning today. I would say if I?d had a great round yesterday, I would have pulled out (of the golf). I just couldn?t see myself going to play a round today and then trying to play the mixed final. This was what was on my mind, and this is what I wanted of this week.? 

Stosur said she?d never even considered that they could win the title. 

The victory has complicated Draper?s future plans, however, with a place in Australia?s Davis Cup team for the first round tie against Austria in March a real possibility for the left-hander. 

Young achiever 

American Donald Young became the youngest to win a junior Grand Slam when he defeated first seed Kim Sun-Yong of South Korea to win the Australian Open boys? singles title on Sunday. 

The second seed dispatched the Korean 6-2, 6-4 to claim his first Grand Slam victory. 

Aged at only 15 years 191 days, he now becomes the youngest No. 1 in the history of junior world rankings.

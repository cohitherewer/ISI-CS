 Champion Crusader may land ?Grand Annual? 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Fields, in Tuesday?s seven-event card, are poor again but competition may not be found wanting. The afternoon?s main event, the 1,600m Grand Annual Handicap, is itself a teaser with three of the four in the line-up demanding attention.

 Of the three, Champion Crusader seems set for a winning debut. During his morning trials, the Duja-Daddy?s A Champion colt has been doing everything asked for. The Bharath Singh-ward may also find the slated trip to his liking. However, if he fails despite a big pull at the weights, the two topweights ? Aptitude and Rasalas ? will be there to decide the issue. C. Alford partners the likely favourite.

 The Eastern Command Cup over 1,400m may see a keen contest between Alarico and Steinlen. But the fact that the former is going from strength-to-strength, and also has age by his side, the Bharath-trainee may do the trick in the hands of C. Alford. 

Arakawa, from trainer Vijay Singh?s yard, is another 

one who holds advantage in the 1,200m Madras Race Club Cup.

 Lyon: Olympique Lyon are suing soccer?s world governing body Fifa for 1 million euros over an injury sustained by defender Eric Abidal in a friendly international, club chairman Jean-Michel Aulas said on Wednesday. ?We have decided to take Fifa to a French court with the support of the G14 and the union of French professional clubs,? Aulas said. Lyon accuse Fifa of forcing clubs to release players when they are picked for international duty and failing to provide any compensation when they are injured.

 Abidal, a key player for the four-times French champions, fractured his left foot during France?s 3-2 victory over Costa Rica in November. He is expected to be out of action until February.

 Rome: Juventus midfielder Emerson will be out of action for 10 days after picking up a thigh strain, a sports daily reported on Wednesday. The Brazilian international, who picked up the injury during a 2-1 win over Fiorentina at the weekend, is expected to regain fitness in time for Juventus? trip south to play Lazio at Rome?s Olympic Stadium on December 17.

 Moscow: Russian soccer chief Vitaly Mutko has hinted he will wait until after next year?s World Cup to name the national team coach. ?Almost all the world?s top coaches are under contract through the World Cup finals, so I think it would be better for us to wait until the end of the World Cup to decide on the man to lead our national team,? Mutko told Russian media. 

 Leipzig: World Cup organisers said on Wednesday they will focus security concerns on matches involving England and The Netherlands as soon as Friday?s draw has determined where they will play. Hooliganism is a big concern for the 2006 finals in Germany. ?Once we know where England and The Netherlands matches will be, we will come up with concrete plans on security,? Horst R. Schmidt, World Cup organising committee vice-president, said.

 Singapore: Swedens Annika Sorenstam captains the International Team to take on Asia in the inaugural Lexus Cup starting at Tanah Merah Country Club on Friday, and is happy to have some old foes on her side for once. The world No. 1 heads a side of 12 that includes top Americans Paula Creamer and Natalie Gulbis and fellow-Swedes Carin Koch and Sophie Gustafson. quot;I think we have an advantage in that a lot of us have played in Solheim Cups and have a little more experience of team matchplay, quot; Aorenstam suggested.

 The Asian team is captained by South Koreas Grace Park and also includes two of her compatriots who have won majors this year, US Womens Open Champion Birdie Kim and Womens British Open Champion Jang Jeong.

 Mumbai: Hrishikesh Pendse would lead the Indian under-19 team at the Asian Rugby Football meet, to be played in Lahore from December 11 to 18.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sri Lanka hold advantage

 Straight Talk

 Arjuna Ranatungar

 Dravid may forge the side into a formidable 

 unit

 I cannot help but begin on a note 

 of discord. I am extremely disappointed with the itinerary 

 for the one-day series between India and Sri Lanka.

 All the matches are scheduled 

 at little-known centres. The Board of Control for Cricket 

 in India (BCCI) must have had its reasons for spreading 

 the game in the hinterland but it does not do justice to 

 the status of the No. 2 team in the world.

 I doubt if they could have done 

 the same if England or Australia were touring. Sri Lanka 

 deserved to play in at least two or three major venues. 

 Our board has been seen in poor light in accepting such 

 an itinerary. A tour by Sri Lanka after eight years deserved 

 better respect.

 The first impression would convey 

 a huge chasm between the two teams. Sachin Tendulkar is 

 just returning after a long injury lay-off; Sourav Ganguly 

 is out for the first two games; Harbhajan Singh has issues 

 with his form; there is a young opener and a middle order 

 batsman; a young wicketkeeper, a young allrounder and a 

 young fast bowler. India would be anxious to know how good 

 is the new cocktail.

 Sri Lanka have no such issues. 

 Despite the hiccup in the practice game in Mumbai, they 

 should be allright in the big games. Maravan Atapattu is 

 an extremely intelligent and focused individual whom we 

 are considering to keep at the helm till the next World 

 Cup.

 Rahul Dravid, in contrast, is 

 only assured a run of 12 games. It is a tenuous situation, 

 for a secure leader tends to command better loyalty and 

 trust from his men. But he is an intense, committed individual 

 and might actually be able to forge a young side into a 

 formidable unit.

 I have been following the recent 

 rumblings in Indian cricket. It would appear there is a 

 rush to toss the seniors into the junkyard and roll out 

 the youngsters with great fanfare. Ideally, one thing does 

 not have to happen at the cost of other.

 I remember we did a similar thing 

 in the 1990s. Most of the seniors were hunted out when they 

 still had a couple of good years of cricket left in them. 

 In contrast, the juniors were pushed into the deep end of 

 the pool too soon.

 A youngster, like a sapling, needs 

 time and space to grow. It does not help to fast-forward 

 the growth. I sometimes feel Asian countries rush young 

 cricketers into the boiling pressure of international cricket 

 too soon. Most of them are never heard of again. 

 However, if the aim is to grow 

 youngsters along with seniors, it is not a bad idea to groom 

 a team with the future in mind. Thus seniors like Sourav 

 and V. V. S. Laxman, Dravid and Sachin could then be rotated 

 and youngsters brought in to find their feet.

 We are planning to do so in Sri 

 Lanka where a Chaminda Vaas and Sanath Jayasuriya would 

 not have to play all matches. 

 Our cricket committee in Sri Lanka 

 is worthy of emulation. This committee is a virtual whos 

 who of Lankan cricket. Anura Tennokoon, Duleep Mendis, Sidath 

 Wettimuny, Roy Dias, Ranjan Madugalle, Roshan Mahanama, 

 Graeme Labrooy, myself and a host of others meet at least 

 once a week and discuss issues concerning the game in the 

 country.

 We regularly invite the coach 

 and the captain and discuss issues with them. It is not 

 an attempt to curtail their independence. Our only goal 

 is to pass on the committees views to them. 

 In India too, it would help if 

 the selectors do not come to the table with their regional 

 agendas. They should help select a team for India rather 

 than their zones. There is nothing wrong if nine players 

 of a state can find place in the national side, provided 

 they are good.

 It is also important for selectors 

 to listen to the coachs views. He doesnt need 

 to have a voting right but he must be heard. Even if selectors 

 have the final say, a coach must be heard.

 Sri Lanka, I feel, have an advantage 

 in the series though there is an unease about the manner 

 in which they are losing early wickets. I remember in Sri 

 Lanka a few months ago they did not win the series as much 

 as India lost. They need to safeguard against such a possibility.

Calcutta: Move over Arjun Atwals and Jyoti Randhawas, it is the juniors who are doing India proud. 

India claimed the team as well as the individual title in the Chang-Sat World Junior Golf Masters, which concluded at Chaam, Thailand, on Saturday. 

Chandigarh school student Gaganjeet Bhullar won the individual crown, while fellow-student Ajitesh Sandhu finished third to help India annexe the (two-member) team crown in the four-day strokeplay event, non-playing captain Gaurav Ghosh said on Monday. 

Gaganjeet tallied nine under 279 in four rounds and was adjudged the Best Junior Golfer in the world. Ajitesh, who finished the last and final round with a one-over 73, won the bronze medal. 

The 17-year-olds also won the team title in the category A amateur event, ahead of the hosts with a combined total of 559. 

In the category D (9-10 years) event, Viraat Bhadawar finished second after a sudden-death play-off. 

Viraat led after the second day with 73-74 but faltered on the final day with a 75 to drop to a tied 222 with Thailands Sanpit Sirisom who shot 70-78-74. 

Viraat and Sanpit then went out on the par-4 first hole for a sudden-death play-off in which Sanpit deftly made par but Viraat could only manage a bogie at the Imperial Lake View Hotel and Golf Club Course.

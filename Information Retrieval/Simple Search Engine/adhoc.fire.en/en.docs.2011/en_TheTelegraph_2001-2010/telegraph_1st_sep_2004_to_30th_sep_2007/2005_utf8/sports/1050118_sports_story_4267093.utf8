 Salgaocar win

Margao: An injury time goal by striker Felix Ibrebru helped Salgaocar beat Vasco 1-0 and record their first win in the 9th National Football League at the Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday. 

Salgaocar failed to cash in on their advantage in the first half after Vasco were reduced to ten men when their Brazilian recruit got expelled for a second yellow-card offence. 

Salgaocar were also reduced to ten men in the last quarter when Micky Fernandes got his second yellow card for a rough challenge on Menino.

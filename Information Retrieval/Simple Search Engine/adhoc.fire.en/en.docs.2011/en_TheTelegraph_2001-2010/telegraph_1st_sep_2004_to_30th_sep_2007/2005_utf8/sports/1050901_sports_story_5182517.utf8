Beijing: While Calcutta golfer Rahil Gangjee is confident he can cope up with the expectations as the defending champion of the $300,000 Volkswagen Masters in Beijing, the Asian Games gold medallist Shiv Kapur feels he is in the right frame of mind going into the meet starting on Thursday. 

The Calcuttan, who is only in his second season on the Asian Tour, has confessed that winning the title last year turned my career around. I got to play in all the events, the co-sanctioned events. It was a big step. I cannot try and qualify for the European Tour knowing that Ive got my exemption here till 2006. 

Even as he gets ready for the event, Gangjee said, I didnt play well in the first half of the year. But, I feel confident after a two-month break. Ive been practising, working out a lot. I hope it goes well. I feel pretty focussed. 

During his off-season, he said he focussed on a lot of intense practice, working on my short game and putting from inside 10-foot. I had a chat with my coach and he told me to believe in myself a lot more. 

I think last years win here came a little too early. Its a good thing that it came and strengthened the fact that at least I could play. But my expectations went up so much that it started telling on the game. Ive now learnt how to cope with that. I dont expect too much now and aim to just let it happen. 

If that is the case with the Calcutta golfer, a week-long stint with coach Kel Llewellyn in Australia has put Shiv Kapur in just the right frame of mind he wants to be. 

The 22-year-old Delhi golfer, who was the Asian Games gold medallist as an amateur in 2002, is coming after a morale booster on the Indian Tour, where he was the best putter of the 2004-05 season, during which he won two titles and finished fourth on money list. 

It was a good week with Kel, who is a tremendous allround coach. Overall, I am feeling great and look forward to some good results, Kapur said. As for his plans, he confidently said, the goal is to win this year, but if that does not happen, I want to contend at least and ensure a card for 2006. 

The field in Beijing is solid with Michael Campbell, the US Open champion and world No. 5 Retief Goosen among others. Other Indians in the fray are Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon and Gaurav Ghei. (PTI)

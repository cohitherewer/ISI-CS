The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Doesnt matter which position Im fielded in, says Nabi

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: It was three years back when Subhas Bhowmick made Suley Musah play upfront during the IFA Shield and the Ghanaian almost single-handedly fetched him the crown through an astonishing goal-scoring spree. 

The ghost of Musah must be visiting Syed Rahim Nabi now. Turned into a right-back under Bhowmick, Nabi ? who started his career as a striker ? has got back a position in the attacking third and delivered the goods in the ongoing CFL Premier Division. He is currently the top scorer, having found the nets four times in three matches. 

Nabis show is enough to raise a key issue: Whether he should be part of the coachs tinkering with various formations. The player, however, wants any controversy surrounding this to die a quick death. 

It doesnt matter whether Im playing as a forward or in the defence as long as the team is winning. If the coach thinks my defensive quality is important for the teams betterment, Im always game for it, he said on Wednesday. 

Scoring goals is always a special feeling. But I dont want any controversy surrounding it, he pleaded. 

Nabi, however, stressed that playing with I.M. Vijayan is an experience and hes enjoying the every moment of it. It was a dream come true when I started with him (against Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday). You can always learn by simply playing with him, he pointed out. 

He also has taken heart from the fact that he figures in Mohun Bagan coach Amal Duttas scheme of things. For me, it will act as a motivation, he said, smilingly.

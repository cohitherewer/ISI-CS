Melbourne: Defending champion Roger Federer led an express-speed charge of seeded players through the first round of the Australian Open on Monday, with Andre Agassi also making a confident start after an injury scare. 

But fifth seed Carlos Moya was a shock casualty on the opening day, falling to fellow-Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. 

Top seed Federer raced past Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 in 94 minutes on Rod Laver Arena centre court at Melbourne Park. 

Four-time champion Agassi, the eighth seed, worked just a little harder as he accounted for German qualifier Dieter Kindlmann 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 in a display which helped ease concern about his hip injury. 

Former women?s champion Serena Williams and US Open winner Svetlana Kuznetsova matched Federer?s no-nonsense approach. 

Williams dismissed France?s Camille Pin 6-1, 6-1 in 57 minutes in the opening match of the tournament on Rod Laver Arena. 

Fifth seed Kuznetsova spent even less time on court, storming past American qualifier Jessica Kirkland 6-1, 6-1 in 43 minutes. 

Japan?s Ai Sugiyama was the first seeded casualty when the woman?s No. 16 was upset 5-7, 4-6 by Slovakian Martina Sucha on showcourt three. Sugiyama was soon joined on the sidelines by 1995 champion and 24th seed Mary Pierce, who was beaten 2-6, 2-6 by fellow-Frenchwoman Stephanie Cohen-Aloro. 

While most top players prospered, it was a fruitless day at the centenary Open for Moya, runner-up here in 1997. 

The 1998 French Open champion was beaten 5-7, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6 by Garcia-Lopez, a qualifier who is playing only his third Grand Slam tournament. The talented 22-year-old had run Moya close in a tight three-setter at the Chennai Open semis 10 days ago. 

Twice runner-up Marat Safin had a great start beating Serb qualifier Novak Djokovic 6-0, 6-2, 6-1. The fourth-seeded Russian was at his powerful best as he outclassed the 17-year-old Djokovic, storming to victory in just 74 minutes under the lights. 

Women?s second seed Amelie Mauresmo dispelled any concerns about her fitness with a clinical 6-2, 6-3 win over in-form local Samantha Stosur. 

Thai star Paradorn Srichaphan, the 27th seed, was troubled by little-known Italian Potito Starace before coming through 1-6, 6-2, 7-5, 6-4. Experienced Japanese Takao Suzuki had a good win, disposing of Jan-Michael Gambill 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. Chinese Taipei duo Lu Yen-hsun and Wang Yeu-Tzuoo bowed out early, both in straight sets to Dutchman Peter Wessels and Czech Tomas Zib, respectively. 

Winner of three Grand Slams last year, Federer picked up where he left off as he blasted past the hapless Santoro. Santoro, making his 13th appearance in Melbourne, complained of fatigue and an upset stomach but it was unlikely he would have made much of an impact even if he had been fully fit. 

The unseeded Frenchman meekly dropped his service for the seventh time to hand the match to Federer, who is bidding to become the first man since Pete Sampras in 1993-1994 to win three consecutive Grand Slam events. 

Agassi shrugged off concern about the hip injury which forced him out of a warm-up event last week as he handed Kindlmann a tennis lesson. 

?It held up all right. I woke up feeling the best I had since it happened,? a relieved Agassi said. 

?I just pushed through a little stiffness and then 

I felt like it loosened up nicely,? said Agassi, who is on course to meet Federer 

in the quarter finals.

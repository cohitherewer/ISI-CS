 Barcelona best in Spain after 5 years

 - EUROpean ROUND-UP 

Madrid: Barcelona won their first league title in six years on Saturday after a second-half header from leading striker Samuel Eto earned them a 1-1 draw against relegation-threatened Levante. 

With second-placed Real Madrid earlier held 2-2 in an action-packed match at Sevilla, Barcelona now have an unassailable six-point lead at the top of the table. 

Even if the Catalans lose their remaining two matches they cannot be caught by their arch-rivals owing to their better head-to-head record in meetings between the two sides this season. 

A nervous Barcelona were made to fight every inch of the way for the point that clinched their 17th league title by determined opponents who needed a win to keep themselves clear of the drop zone. 

Alberto Rivera gave the home side the lead 10 minutes before the break. 

Rijkaards side struggled to find the usual rhythm as they were hounded down in midfield and grew increasingly frustrated. Tempers flared in the closing minutes of the half with players exchanging a series of reckless challenges in midfield. 

Barcelonas Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho was fortunate to stay on the pitch after appearing to headbutt a Levante defender in the area after a penalty appeal. 

The Catalans managed to grab the all-important equaliser as Cameroon international striker Eto scored his 24th goal of the season when he nodded in at the far post after Rafael Marquez headed on a corner from Xavi on the hour. 

Earlier on Saturday it had looked as though Barcelona might be crowned champions without having to kick a ball after Real Madrid fell behind when Sevilla fullback Sergio Ramos cracked a 30-metre piledriver past Iker Casillas in the 20th minute. 

But Real were thrown a lifeline before halftime when Sevilla centre-back Javi Navarro headed into his own net as he tried to cut out a Roberto Carlos cross under pressure from Michael Owen. 

Buoyed by the goal, Real lifted their game in the second period and a stunning 20-metre strike from Zinedine Zidane put the visitors 2-1 up 16 minutes from time. 

Third-placed Sevilla laid siege to the Real area and grabbed a deserved equaliser when striker Julio Baptista headed home with two minutes to go to end Reals seven-match winning run. 

Real centre-back Ivan Helguera was sent off in injury time for a dangerous challenge on striker Dario Silva. 

In Bundesliga, Bayern Munich staged a fitting finale to their 33-year run at the Olympic Stadium on Saturday, beating Nuremberg 6-3 in their last match at one of the most famous sporting venues in the world. 

Bayern, who clinched their 19th German league title two weeks ago, will move to a new 280 million euro stadium next season. (REUTERS)

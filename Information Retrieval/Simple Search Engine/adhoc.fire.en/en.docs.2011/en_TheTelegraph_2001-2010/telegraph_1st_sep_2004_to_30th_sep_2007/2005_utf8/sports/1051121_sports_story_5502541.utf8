 Nalbandian shocks Federer

Shanghai: David Nalbandian pulled off an enormous upset on Sunday when he came from two sets down to win a nail-biting Masters Cup final against struggling world No. 1 Roger Federer. 

Nalbandian, seemingly out of it after losing two tie-breakers, outlasted the two-time defending champion to win 6-7 (4-7), 6-7 (11-13), 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (7-3) after a marathon four hours and 33 minutes. 

He becomes the first Argentine to win a year-ending tournament since Guillermo Vilas won the 1974 Masters in Melbourne. 

Federer, who had been out since October 2 with ankle trouble, took the first two sets before fading, calling the trainer in the fourth. But he rallied and was serving for the match at 6-5 before Nalbandian forced the tie-breaker. 

The victory completes a remarkable turn of events for the eighth seed, who was packing his things for a fishing trip just a few days ago before being called up for the injured Andy Roddick. 

It ends Federers 35-match unbeaten streak and stops him one win short of equalling John McEnroes 1984 record winning percentage of 96.5. 

Paes 4th time unlucky 

It was fourth time unlucky for Leander Paes. Having fallen at the final hurdle of the year-ending doubles championship thrice with Mahesh Bhupathi, the Indian Davis Cup captain shared the agony with Serbian Nenad Zimonjic this time around. 

Paes and Zimonjic went down to Frenchmen Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-7 (4-7) in a two-hour, 36-minute final at the Qi Zhong Stadium. 

Both pairs were playing their last match as a regular pair. While Paes plans to combine with Czech Martin Damm next year, Santoro and Zimonjic will join forces. Llodra will concentrate on singles in 2006. (Agencies)

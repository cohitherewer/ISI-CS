 Balaji eyes Lanka face-off

 Balaji 

Bangalore: Team India mediumpacer Lakshmipathy Balaji is eager to lock horns with Sri Lankan batsmen in the upcoming tri-series, also involving the West Indies. 

I am looking forward to the tri-series in Sri Lanka, the seamer said on Monday before the commencement of the week-long pre-season physical fitness and conditioning camp at the National Cricket Academy, where he and his teammates would interact for the first time with coach Greg Chappell. 

The camp will not be very different from previous camps, King said, adding: There will, however, be a couple of new ideas. 

On his assessment of the fitness level of pace bowlers, gathered here for the conditioning camp, Chappell noted that it was only the first day. 

Its really hard to assess at this stage. We have got a week to assess the fitness levels. Its a good start, he said adding the bowlers were enthusiastic.

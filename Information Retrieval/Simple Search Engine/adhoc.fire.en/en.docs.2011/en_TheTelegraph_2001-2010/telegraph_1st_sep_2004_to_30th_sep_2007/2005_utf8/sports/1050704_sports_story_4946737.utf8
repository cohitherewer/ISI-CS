 Poncha targets Doha gold

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rehand Poncha is no push-over even at the age of 18. 

He was Indias bet for the Athens Olympics, but failed to live up to the expectations and didnt make it to the Greek capital. That were those days when the Karnataka swimmer stormed the SAF Games in Islamabad and creating splashes in other meets, leading to a government scholarship that ultimately landed him in Australia to train under Bernie Mulroy. 

His focus, however, is changed now, but not his desire to succeed. 

Having spent a good deal of international training in Perth, he now feels that time is ripe to make his case in a big way and that too, and he wants to get training under national coach T. Pradeep Kumar. 

I have been there (in Perth) twice in the last couple of years on scholarships and it has been a pretty good experience. On the basis of what Ive learnt there, I want to excel by hard work now, Poncha said at the Subhas Sarobar on Sunday. The visits to Australia have helped me in reducing my timings, he admitted. 

Poncha, who will undergo a trial on Monday for the Asian age-group swimming championship, is looking forward to a medal in the Doha Asian Games. The Asian age-group meet begins in Bangkok on August 18. My aim is to clinch a medal in the Asian Games and for that I have to see my potentials in these meets well, Poncha said. 

The teenaged swimmer, who is pursuing studies in journalism, doesnt want employment right at the moment. I had offers from Police and Railways, but I chose to focus on swimming and studies at present, he stated.

Chittagong: Bangladesh ended the second day of the first Test against Zimbabwe on Friday in a strong position to win their first Test. 

Bangladesh, who have lost 31 of their previous 34 Tests, were bowled out for 488 ? their highest score ? just after tea and then reduced the visitors to 84 for four at stumps. 

Allrounder Mohammed Rafique was the major performer for the home side, bludgeoning six boundaries and four sixes in his 69 before he took two wickets in the final session. 

Rafique, who shared a blazing 62-run partnership with Mashrafee Murtaza (48) as Bangladesh?s batsmen plundered the inexperienced Zimbabwe attack in the afternoon, trapped Vusi Sibanda (12) and debutant Graeme Cremer (0) to leave the visitors in deep trouble. 

Zimbabwe, who need a further 205 runs to avoid the follow on, began positively with opener Stuart Matsikenyeri smashing five boundaries in his 28 runs before he was caught by Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar off Tapash Baisya with the score on 31. 

Sibanda was trapped in front by Rafique before Barney Rogers was run out unfortunately when a shot from Hamilton Masakadza was deflected by bowler Enamul Haq junior on to the stumps. 

Masakadza was 28 not out while Brendan Taylor was on eight. Earlier, Bangladesh surpassed 400 for just the third time in their Test history. They made 400 in their first Test against India in 2000 and 416 against the West Indies last May. 

Resuming on 280 for four, the hosts scored just 66 runs in the first session with Aftab Ahmed (6) and Rajin Saleh (89) the only wickets to fall. 

Khaled Mashud (49), Rafique and Murtaza then attacked during the afternoon, scoring 134 runs to take the hosts to 480 for eight at tea before they were dismissed shortly after the break. 

Leg-spinner Cremer finished with two for 86 off 16.3 overs, while pace bowler Christopher Mpofu, also making his debut, took four for 109.

Jamshedpur: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan 

has recovered from a chest infection-related illness and will play the third ODI, 

here, on Saturday. 

Captained by Sourav Ganguly, Team India lead 2-0. 

According toThe Telegraph?s sources, Younis 

(who had a phenomenal Test series) is going to take allrounder Mohammed Hafeez?s 

place. The latter made the XI both in Kochi and Vizag. 

It was a day off for the visitors, but Younis had nets under the sharp eyes of coach Bob Woolmer. 

Till late on Thursday, though, there was no confirmation about leggie Danish Kaneria getting a look-in. A clutch of ?experts? have been calling for his inclusion. 

Where India is concerned, Ajit Agarkar may pip Irfan 

Pathan and take the slot vacated by Lakshmipathy Balaji, who suffered a side strain 

in ODI No.2.

Agarkar, of course, got added to the squad after Balaji?s 

injury. 

Significantly, Thursday afternoon?s workout (at the Keenan) was optional, but everybody except Sachin Tendulkar and Balaji turned up. 

?I?d thought the session would be light and easy ? it wasn?t,? quipped coach John Wright. 

Yet again, Sourav put in that extra bit at nets and, later, had an extended gym session as well. It?s to be seen whether, finally, this hard work gets rewarded. 

The captain had a poor Test series and didn?t make 

an impression in the first two ODIs either.

 Vijay Singh?s Santarelle looks good 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: With a number of Daniel David?s favourites 

letting him down on Wednesday, the trainer?s hope to catch up with the leader, 

Vijay Singh, on the championship table, suffered a jolt. He could manage to wipe 

out the deficit by two points and, may need to try afresh on Thursday, but things 

do not look very rosy for him.

 Daniel may be eyeing for Pacific Jewel?s win in the Relevance Cup. The filly is going from strength-to-strength. His hopes are also pinned on Wild Flowers who made a rapid progress in the stretch-run to win an 1,100m race. The extra 100m of the Comedian Handicap could work to her advantage.

However, Vijay?s Santarelle is no pushover in afternoon?s 

feature event, the Mysore Race Club Cup. He was gallant in his defeat suffered 

at the hands of Adderly in a very close-finish.

 Brian Lara to play 

Durban: Former West Indian cricket captain Brian Lara is one of several international players who will play in two benefit matches for South Africas all-rounder, Jacques Kallis, later this month. 

Lara, entangled in sponsorship issues with the West Indies cricket board, will play for the Jacques Kallis Invitational XI against a South African team at Newlands cricket stadium in Cape Town on September 16 and at Centurion Park in Pretoria on September 18. 

Funds raised from the two matches will go towards the Jacques Kallis Development Foundation. Chris Gayle, Mohammed Sami, Salman Butt, Neil Johnson, Jonty Rhodes, Gary Kirsten, Lance Klusener and Alan Dawson will also take part. (PTI)

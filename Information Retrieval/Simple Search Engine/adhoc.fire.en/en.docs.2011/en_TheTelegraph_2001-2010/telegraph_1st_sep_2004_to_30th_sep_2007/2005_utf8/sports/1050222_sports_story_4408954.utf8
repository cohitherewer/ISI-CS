 Aussies will win Ashes easily: Mark

 Mark Waugh 

Adelaide: The writing is on the wall for Darren Lehmann?s international career and he won?t tour England with the Australian team later this year, former batsman Mark Waugh said on Monday. 

Waugh also felt England don?t believe they can beat Australia in the five-Test series. 

Lehmann was dropped from Australia?s one-day team for the current New Zealand tour and Waugh said he expected the 35-year-old South Australian to also miss out on the Ashes tour. 

?I don?t think he will go to England, the Australian selectors are looking at younger players,? Waugh said here on Monday. ?He?s a great player and a great team man but I think age has probably just caught up with him.? 

Mark expected a ?pretty easy? Australian triumph in the Ashes. ?England might have a chance but I don?t kn- ow if they believe in themselves,? he said. ?They could take a Test off us, but I think something like three or four-one will be the result.? 

Waugh was also vocal about Australia?s contentious rotation policy and said he was against resting players from one-day fixtures. 

?I don?t think it works. It didn?t work four or five years ago so I don?t know why they brought it back in,? he said. 

?I remember being rotated against Zimbabwe two or three times. At the end of the season, the selectors are sorting out your contract and I remember them saying ? you haven?t scored as many runs as we would have liked?. 

?I felt like saying ?well, you shouldn?t have rotated me against Zimbabwe?.? (AFP)

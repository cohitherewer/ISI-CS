Bangalore: Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, who attributes the upswing in his confidence to County cricket, will return to Essex both this summer and in 2006. 

?Initially, I just had a one-season contract (2004), but I?ve been signed on for two more... I expect to learn a lot more and emerge a better bowler,? Kaneria told The Telegraph. 

The leg-spinner is seen by many, including captain Inzamam-ul Haq, as the one Pakistani bowler with the brightest future.

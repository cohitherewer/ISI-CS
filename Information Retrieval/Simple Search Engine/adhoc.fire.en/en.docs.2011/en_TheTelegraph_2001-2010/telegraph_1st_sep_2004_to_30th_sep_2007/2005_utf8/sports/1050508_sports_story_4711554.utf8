Barcelona: Toyotas Jarno Trulli beat home favourite Fernando Alonso by a whisker on Saturday to claim provisional pole position for the Spanish Grand Prix. 

The Italian lapped the Circuit de Catalunya in 1:14.795, just 16 thousandths of a second faster than Renaults championship leader. 

Alonso, winner of the last three races, remained well positioned for Sundays decisive final session but Ferraris seven times world champion Michael Schumacher could only manage seventh. 

McLarens Kimi Raikkonen was third for McLaren, just 0.024 adrift of Trulli, with Toyotas Ralf Schumacher fourth and also in with a shout of a front row start with a time 0.075 slower than Trulli. 

Indias Narain Karthikeyan produced a smooth drive in the first qualifying to finish 15th. Karthikeyan timed 1:18.567 to finish ahead of teammate Tiago Monteiro of Portugal at the Catalunya circuit and seemed satisfied with the performance of Jordan Toyota EJ15 car. 

?It has not been my quickest lap since the beginning of the weekend but I am nevertheless still satisfied,? Indias ace driver said. ?It was a bit difficult to warm up the tyres but then the car balance was ok. 

?The race tomorrow will be very exciting, as all drivers know the Circuit de Catalunya quite well and I hope we will finish the race in good position.? 

 ?It was something special for me,? said Alonso of the atmosphere at the circuit, with thousands of flag-waving fans cheering him on. ?Its probably my best lap in a Formula One car so far. 

Trulli, who beat Alonso in Spain last year when they were Renault teammates, could secure Toyotas first pole position on Sunday but he sounded doubtful despite the stunning lap time. ?I am a little bit surprised to be here because all morning I have been struggling a lot with the car, some problem with the engine,? he told a news conference. 

The Italian is second in the standings with 20 points to Alonsos 36 after four races. Raikkonen, who started on pole at Imola and led the first nine laps until his car suffered a drive-shaft failure, ran wide at turn two. 

?The car seems to be quick, Im just not happy to be in this place when I should have been in the first,? said the Finn. 

Schumachers time was a surprise after he lapped some two seconds quicker than other cars in the later stages at Imola. 

The German will start sixth if the placings stay the same in second qualifying because compatriot Nick Heidfeld in a Williams, fifth fastest, has had an unscheduled engine change and will lose 10 places on the grid. 

Australian Mark Webber was sixth fastest with Alonsos Italian teammate Giancarlo Fisichella eighth. Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, returning for McLaren after missing two races due to injury, was 12th. 

Just 18 cars qualified after Honda-powered BAR packed up their trucks and left on Friday following their two-race ban for breaking the rules on weight and fuel. 

Barrichello penalised 

Ferraris Rubens Barrichello will lose 10 places on Sundays starting grid after an unscheduled engine change before Saturdays first qualifying. 

 Technical director Ross Brawn said the problem was 

 not one the Formula One champions had experienced before 

 and they were investigating the cause.

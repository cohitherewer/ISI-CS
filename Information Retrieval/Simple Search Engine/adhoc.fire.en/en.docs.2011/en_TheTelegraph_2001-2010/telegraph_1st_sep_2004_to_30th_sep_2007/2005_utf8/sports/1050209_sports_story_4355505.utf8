The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Jennings not upset by Smith?s Steve-wish

 - I?ve made a mark on the side, says SA interim coach 

East London: South Africa?s interim coach Ray Jennings said he was not upset by media reports quoting captain Graeme Smith as saying he would like Steve Waugh to take up the position. 

?It?s news to me,? Jennings told a news conference in East London on Tuesday. 

?I know what I?m worth, what I can do, and I?m not perturbed by that. I have a passion to stay in the game, and I have made a mark on the side.? 

Jennings? contract as South Africa coach runs until the end of the team?s tour to the West Indies at the end of May. Comments attributed to Smith have appeared in several British publications, the captain saying he would like an Australian in charge with Waugh at the head of the queue. 

South Africa media manager Gerald de Kock said the coach?s position would be advertised this week. 

Jennings said he has an ?enjoyable relationship? with Smith. 

?He?s young and exciting, I challenge him and he challenges me,? Jennings said. ?He sent me a text message yesterday saying: ?Coach, youre a champion?. 

?The (team?s) passion has been good, and our catching and ground fielding has improved. I will speak to the players and if they want me as a leader I will re-apply, it?s all about the players.? 

Jennings took over in October when Eric Simons resigned. He led the team to India, where they lost 0-1, before losing a home Test series to England for the first time in 40 years last month. 

?If we had got the balance right quicker, we could have won the Test series or at least levelled it,? Jennings said. 

?If the powers at be were looking for results only, maybe they should have left selection to me. I want to make sure I make an impact on the players and that they have enjoyed my way of coaching.?

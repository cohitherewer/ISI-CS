The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Reds made to work hard for win

London: Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard came on as a late substitute and scored twice in a minute as the European champions beat Total Network Solutions 3-0 to reach the second qualifying round of the Champions League on Tuesday. 

Liverpool wrapped up the tie 6-0 on aggregate but TNS, playing at Wrexhams Racecourse Ground because their own tiny ground in the village of Llansantffraid did not reach Uefa standards, made Liverpool work for their win. 

The Welsh side hit a post and had a goal ruled out for a narrow offside decision after the Merseysiders missed a penalty. 

Liverpool, 3-0 up from the first leg following Gerrards hattrick at Anfield last Wednesday, went ahead when Djibril Cisse took advantage of a slip by Chris King after 26 minutes to lash home a cross from John Arne Riise. 

Substitute Gerrard then scored twice in a minute late in the game to wrap up the win. 

TNS goalkeeeper Gerard Doherty saved a weak 50th minute penalty from Dietmar Hamann as the Welsh minnows gave the five-time European champions a tougher workout than they did in the first leg last week. 

They also went close to a goal after 67 minutes when Steven Beck hit the post with a well-struck angled shot. 

Liverpool will now face FBK Kaunas in the second qualifying round. 

The Lithuanians beat HB Torshavn, the Faroe Islands champions, 4-0 in the second leg of their opening round tie for an 8-2 aggregate win.

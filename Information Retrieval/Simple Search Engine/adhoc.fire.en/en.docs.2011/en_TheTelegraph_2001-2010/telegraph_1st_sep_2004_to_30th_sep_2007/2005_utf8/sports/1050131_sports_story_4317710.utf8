The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Longer stint for Prasad likely

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India mediumpacer Venkatesh Prasad, who is now in charge of the India under-19 team, may be considered for a longer stint. Following Prasad?s suggestion to a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official, the matter may come up for discussion in the Board?s next working committee meeting. 

After Prasad?s boys thrashed the England under-19 side in the first two ?Tests? of the three-match series, it might be easier for him to get a long-term contract. ?I have personally spoken to a BCCI official, but nothing has been finalised as yet,? Prasad told The Telegraph at the Eden on Sunday. 

Though Prasad doesn?t have a clear idea whether his suggestion will be accepted, a BCCI source stated that eyeing the 2006 under-19 World Cup, the suggestion may be granted and a one-year contract is likely to be offered. 

The former mediumpacer, whose current contract runs till the end of this series, seemed passionate about the boys at his disposal. ?I want to work with the boys for a longer stint to know their strengths and weaknesses,? he said.

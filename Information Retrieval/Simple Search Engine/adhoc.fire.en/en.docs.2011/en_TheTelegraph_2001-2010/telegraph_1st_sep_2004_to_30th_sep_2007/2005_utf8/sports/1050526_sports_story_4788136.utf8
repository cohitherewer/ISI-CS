The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nebitchi in disarray 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: If coming to play an AFC Cup match with just 12 players raised a few questions about Nebitchi FCs way of dealing with their tie against East Bengal, they flouted the Asian Football Confederation rules as well by not sending any representative to attend the post-match press conference on Wednesday. 

According to match commissioner Mohammed Muzammil Bin Mohammed of Singapore, the games Asian governing body wants both teams to have representatives at the press meet after a match. While East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick did meet the press, Nebitchi officials came to the press room, but were reluctant to do the same, leaving the place suddenly. 

Later, one Nebitchi official came up with a bizarre explanation: You people spent too much time with Subhas (during the press conference), so we decided to leave, he said. The AFC official also wondered Nebitchi did anything good by landing here with 12 players. We must see the spirit of the game is maintained, he said. 

The visitors, however, looked more intent on settling some financial issues with the hosts after the match. It has been learnt that East Bengal had to overstay in Turkmenistan since there were no flights back home after the away match. They also had to take a long bus journey to reach the airport. East Bengal thought the cost involved was complementary. But Nebitchi officials demanded money for this on their arrival here, and also threatened to move the AFC in this regard, taking the hosts by surprise. 

Bhowmick held a long meeting with the visitors in their dressing room after Wednesdays match. The matter is solved, said a Nebitchi official later. 

Bhowmick, meanwhile, refused to buy the suggestion that the hot and humid conditions did the visitors in at the Salt Lake Stadium. This cant be an excuse. We also played there (in Turkmenistan) in minus two degrees Celsius. So being professionals, you need to get acclimatised to all conditions, remarked the East Bengal coach.

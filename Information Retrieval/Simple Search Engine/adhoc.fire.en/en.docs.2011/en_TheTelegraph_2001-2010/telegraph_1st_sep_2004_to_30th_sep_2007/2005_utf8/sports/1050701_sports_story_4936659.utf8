 Krebs to attend camp from Sunday

A STAFF RE ORTER

Calcutta: Following Team India coach Greg Chappells advice, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to utilise the services of internationally renowned human physical and mental movement expert Dr Charles Krebs at the conditioning camp currently underway in Bangalore. 

[That Chappell wanted to involve Dr Krebs with Team India was first reported by The Telegraph on June 5.] 

Disclosing this here on Thursday, BCCI joint secretary Goutam Das Gupta said that Krebs has done brilliant research on treatment of soft tissue injuries in Germany and is also proficient in the area of mental performance. 

Krebs would attend the camp from July 3 to 6 initially, and his services would be utilised again as the year advances.

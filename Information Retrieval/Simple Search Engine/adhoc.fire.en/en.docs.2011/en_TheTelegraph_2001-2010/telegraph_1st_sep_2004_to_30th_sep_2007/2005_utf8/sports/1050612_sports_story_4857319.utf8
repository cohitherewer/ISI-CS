 IN THE CITY

 It?s a performance that literally went wide off the target. In the Ambar Roy pre-quarter final matches at Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground on Saturday, as many as 129 extras were given away by the teams and more surprisingly, 111 of those extra runs came of wide balls. 

 Chandranath Memorial CCC bowlers conceded 55 runs as extra, including 51 wide balls against Shyamnagar Sabuj Sangha, who won the match eventually. But the winners too con-ceded 19 wides in 25 extra runs. 

 The match between Subhas Institute and Calcutta CCC was no exception. While the former gave away 25 wides in 29 extras, Calcutta CCC, the winners, conceded 16 wides out of their own quota of 20 extra runs.

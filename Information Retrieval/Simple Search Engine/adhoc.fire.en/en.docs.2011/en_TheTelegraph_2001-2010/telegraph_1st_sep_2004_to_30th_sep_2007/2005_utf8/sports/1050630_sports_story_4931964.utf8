Calcutta: Indian footballs future talent pool is heading towards excellence. 

Conceptualised by the SAIs Centre of Excellence and riding on Central government finance, a unique project of spotting and grooming talent was set rolling at the SAI Eastern Centre on Tuesday. Twelve players, out of an assembly of 36, were picked for a long-term training in the first phase of selection process. 

Two more such trials, involving players between 17 and 22 years, are expected to be over by next month. These players will, then, be inducted in a residential-cum-training camp with special emphasis on their education. 

Its a unique scheme (within the SAI) where every aspect of a players profile ? from football training to education and character-development ? will be taken care of for four years, said coach Prasun Banerjee, who is also on the selection panel. 

This is basically keeping in mind the fact that the age-group players often show lots of talent but fail to rise to the occasion afterwards due to lack of proper guidance. Here they can avail of state-of-the-art training for four years. Opportunity will open up for highly talented youngsters at the Centre, with clubs being able to spot and pick, he said. 

It as surprising to see, though, that only six Bengal players turned up for the trials, which was free for all. Only one among them, Ganesh Hazra, an under-17 player, has been selected. The biggest presence was from the North-East states. 

When asked about this, the IFA secretary Subrata Dutta also expressed surprise. About 20 players were expected to turn up for the trial. I really dont know why most of them failed to turn up. But I will take initiative to ensure the boys make it to the next trials, he told The Telegraph. 

Meanwhile, according to selector-cum-coach Ananta Ghosh, plans are afoot to provide the trainees with a couple of foreign trips in a year. We are also planning to invite junior teams of European countries to play here so that the boys can have sufficient international exposure, he maintained.

 Rasalas canters home 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The much-expected close match between Rasalas and Champion Crusader, on Saturday, turned out to be a no contest for the former. He simply outclassed the opposition to lift the prized event, the 1,400m Independence Cup. Daniel David trained the winner. Jockey B. Prakash, who partnered the half-money favourite to victory, had the Storm Trooper-Ruddles son settled behind the leader Spectacular Star before taking off at the home turn. 

 The Crusader was, however, unlucky to have lost much ground at the start.

 In the Commuter Cup, Sea Legend produced a pleasing display when the Deepak Karki-trainee powered her way to victory. Ridden by Mark Reuben, the mare shot into the lead right after the start and won convincingly despite her topweight.

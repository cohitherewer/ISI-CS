 Abhijit youngest IM

New Delhi: Abhijit Gupta became the countrys youngest International Master (IM) after Fide, the world chess federation, officially awarded him the title at its executive board meeting in Dresden, Germany. 

The 15-year-old secured his fourth IM norm at the Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival that concluded on Tuesday. His title was confirmed by Fide the same evening. 

Calcutta girl Mary Ann Gomes got her Woman International Master title. Kruttika Nadig of Karnataka was also awarded the WIM title, subject to rating approval as the Pardubice Open that she played in Czech Republic last month will be accounted for the next ratings list to be released in October. 

Tania Sachdev got confirmation of her Woman Grandmaster (WGM) title. She became the eighth Indian WGM after S. Vijayalakshmi, Koneru Humpy, Swati Ghate, S. Meenakshi, R. Aarthie, Nisha Mohota and D. Harika. 

Gupta joined the growing list of Indian International Masters since Manuel Aaron became the first from the country to get the title almost three decades back. 

For the record, Gupta ? the first from Rajasthan to get the IM title ? is the 44th Indian to get the title.

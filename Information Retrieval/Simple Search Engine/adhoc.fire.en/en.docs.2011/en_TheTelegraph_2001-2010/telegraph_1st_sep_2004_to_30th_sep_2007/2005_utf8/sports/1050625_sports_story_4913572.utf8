The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 An American dream dashed

 - US Gone Prix is the refrain after the Indianapolis Formula One disaster 

 Schumachers Indy victory was a discounted one 

London: Formula One is used to supporters holding up banners and signs urging on their favourite drivers. 

Go Schumi, Alonso, You Are The King that sort of thing. 

It likes to present itself as a cutting edge, glamour sport. Americans watching Sundays US Grand Prix shambles saw a different picture, however. 

The writing was on the fans faces at Indianapolis and it was not a pretty sight. Some scrawled $ back or US Gone Prix. Drivers were booed, bottles and cans were thrown on to the track. 

F1 is the rude house guest who never brings anything to the party and continues to wipe its muddy shoes on the new Persian rug, opined Indianapolis Star columnist Bob Kravitz. 

Hey F1, dont let the door hit you on the way out, added the headline. 

With just six cars racing after the other 14 pulled out before the start because their Michelin tyres were not up to the stresses of the banked final corner, Indianapolis was not Formula Ones finest hour. 

It was a public relations disaster. 

Fans were outraged, the sports hopes of cracking the coveted US market shrivelled on the spot and a blight was cast on what had been well on the way to becoming the most fascinating season in years. 

While ticket holders in America consulted their lawyers and vowed never to attend another Grand Prix, the blame game raged in Europe and the repercussions and ramifications could haunt the sport for some time. 

The fiasco will be raked over again in Paris on Wednesday, when the seven Michelin teams appear before the international automobile federations (FIA) World Motor Sport Council. 

The teams involved are championship leaders Renault, McLaren, Williams, Toyota, BAR, Sauber and Red Bull. 

All are charged with committing acts prejudicial to the interests of a competition and motor sport in general and risk being given significant fines or docked constructors championship points. 

The hearing could cast a pall over the rest of the season, with the risk of further unrest just as Formula One embarks on the busiest part of a crowded season with four races in the space of five weeks. 

If that meeting goes wrong, Formula One will be facing the biggest crisis it has been in its 50-year history, warned Minardi boss Paul Stoddart, who has called for the resignation of FIA president Max Mosley. 

Others suggest a more positive outcome could emerge, particularly if Michelin, as Mosley has suggested, decided to compensate the US fans. 

The FIA, despite heaping the blame on Michelin and the teams, has assured them that the hearing will listen carefully to all the arguments. 

There are two sides to every story and the seven teams must have a full opportunity to tell theirs, said Mosley. The atmosphere will be calm and polite. 

Michelin have already accepted their share of the blame, motorsport boss Pierre Dupasquier admitting candidly that they had screwed up after winning the previous nine races. The tyres were not up to the job this time. They and their teams issued a statement on Sunday apologising to all spectators, television viewers and sponsors. (Reuters)

 Hari loses, slips to 7th 

 - DOS HERMANAS MEET 

Dos Hermanas: World junior champion P. Harikrishna suffered an unexpected defeat against Grandmaster Ruben Felgaer of Argentina in the fourth round of category-16 Dos Hermanas international chess meet here on Tuesday. 

The loss proved costly for Harikrishna as from his overnight joint second spot, the Indian was relegated to the joint seventh position. 

Ukrainian prodigy Sergey Karjakin continued to lead the tables after settling for a draw with former champion Alexander Rustemov of Russia. 

Karjakin, who took his tally to three points out of a possible four, is now followed by Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Felgaer, both having 2.5 points apiece. 

Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia and Russian trio, top seed Alexey Dreev, Oleg Korneev and Rustemov are half point adrift. 

Harikrishna was next in line along with Spaniard Miguel Illescas Cordoba. 

Choosing the Ivan?s Gambit with his white pieces, Felgaer was in command right from the opening. Harikrishna felt the heat once his king-side was paralysed and his pieces were cramped. 

Slow tightening of the noose ensued and Harikrishna had no hopes of revival. Losing an exchange mid-way, the Indian called it a day in 33 moves. 

If Ruben showed a lot of heart, Radjabov was not far behind in cruising past Cordoba, who suffered his second successive loss in the event. It was a Benoni Defence in which Cordoba went haywire from an innocuous position trying to equalise quickly. 

As it happened in the game, Cordoba?s bid never materialise as Radjabov got his passed pawn rolling on the queen side that won him a piece. The game lasted 43 moves. 

It was not such a dull day even though the customary draws were there as usual. Karjakin could not do much despite playing white against Rustemov after the latter, as black, employed the Petroff Defence. 

The players fought a well-analysed variation for sometime before reaching a balanced middle game where the draw was agreed to in 27 moves. 

Alexei Dreev yet again played the longest game of the day without much success. Draw was agreed in 76 moves.

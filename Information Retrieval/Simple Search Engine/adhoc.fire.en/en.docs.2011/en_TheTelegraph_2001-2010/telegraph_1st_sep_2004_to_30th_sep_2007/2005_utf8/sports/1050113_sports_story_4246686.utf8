The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atletico Madrid fined 

Madrid: Atletico Madrid have been fined 600 euros ($794) by the Spanish Football Federation for racist chanting in Sunday?s derby match against Real Madrid at the Calderon. 

The federation gave Atletico a minor punishment because they deemed that the club had done all it could to prevent the incidents by asking the fans to stop the abuse over the public address system. 

Referee Alfonso Perez Burrull noted the racist behaviour in his report on the match. 

?I asked the match delegate to make an announcement on the public address system to ask the fans to stop making monkey noises when certain players had the ball,? he said. ?As a result...the noises grew louder.?

 Lee Bowyer charged with violent conduct

London: Newcastle United midfielder Lee Bowyer was charged with violent conduct on Tuesday after his on-field fight with teammate Kieron Dyer in Saturday?s Premier League game against Aston Villa. 

Bowyer and Dyer were sent off following the brawl and both faced automatic three-match bans. Bowyer was fined a club record six weeks? wages by Newcastle on Monday. 

Newcastle appealed against Dyer?s red card, but the Football Association (FA) rejected their claim for wrongful dismissal in a separate decision on Tuesday. 

England international Dyer will serve a three-match ban with immediate effect although, like Bowyer, he will be free to play in Newcastle?s Uefa Cup quarter final tie with Sporting Lisbon. (Reuters)

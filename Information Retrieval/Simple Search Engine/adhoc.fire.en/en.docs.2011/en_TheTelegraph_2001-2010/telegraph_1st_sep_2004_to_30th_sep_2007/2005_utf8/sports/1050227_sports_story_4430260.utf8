 IN THE CITY

 Anirban Gupta took seven for 86, but the Tapan Memorial bowler?s effort was enough to stop Town Club from piling 370 in their CAB first division first-round play-off match on Saturday. 

 Summarised scores 

 Paikpara SC 295/8 in 85 ovs (Alok Khettry 

 65, S.N. Mishra 60 n.o.; Imran Ali 3/62) vs Suburban 

 Club. 

 Town Club 370 in 82 ovs (Palash Bhowmick 

 100, Arka Singha Roy 60; Anirban Gupta 7/86). Tapan Memorial 

 1/0 in 2 ovs. Matches to continue. 

 East Bengal on Saturday signed Marcos Seco to replace his injured brother Douglas da Silva, for the upcoming AFC Cup. Marcos, who played for Fransa Pax last season, has been taken on loan by the current National Football League (NFL) leaders. 

 Rupesh Roy?s hopes for a double were dashed on Saturday when he went down to second seed, Delhi?s Ashutosh Singh, 4-6, 3-6 in the men?s singles final of the Central Excise Open AITA grasscourt tennis. Rupesh, however, lifted the doubles crown teaming up with Vinod Kumar Sewa. Sheethal Goutham won the singles title beating Sonal Phadke 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) after winning the doubles.

 Tyson keen to teach Rooney 

 RICK BROADBENT 

 Tyson says he can 

 relate to Rooney 

 Mike Tysons questionable 

 credentials as a youth development guru were summed up when 

 he suggested that he would like to eat Lennox Lewiss 

 babies. 

 Undaunted by his flawed CV, the 

 former world heavyweight champion has now followed in the 

 footsteps of Sepp Blatter and decided that he is perfectly 

 placed to advise Wayne Rooney. 

 Whether Rooney needs the help 

 of the self-styled baddest man on the planet 

 is a moot point, but the convicted rapist is keen to sit 

 down with the Manchester United forward when he comes to 

 England next month as part of a speaking tour. If the notion 

 has an air of Irony Mike about it, Tyson seems oblivious. 

 Id like to meet Wayne 

 Rooney, he said. Ive been watching him 

 and Manchester United recently and hes been having 

 some trouble with his behaviour on the pitch. I could relate 

 to what he was going through. 

 It is an intriguing claim. Getting 

 sent off is one thing, divorce, prison, bankruptcy and munching 

 on Evander Holyfield quite another. If, as Blatter, the 

 Fifa president, maintains, Rooney needs to be taken in hand, 

 he may want to look for a slightly less angry anger-management 

 specialist. As Holyfield knows, when Tyson asks if you will 

 lend him an ear, it is advisable to run away. 

 Tyson has already come to some 

 conclusions about Rooney. He just seemed like he was 

 having a good time, he said of the tyros indiscretions. 

 Such defences traditionally founder in the face of a disciplinary 

 panel, but Tyson will press on regardless. I will 

 be going to Manchester while Im over, he said. 

 I like Manchester and already have a Manchester United 

 shirt. 

 Ray Fisher, the promoter of the 

 question-and-answer tour, insists that Tyson will not duck 

 any issues. 

 Quite what Sir Alex Ferguson makes 

 of it all is unknown. First Blatter, now Tyson. The United 

 manager is probably expecting a thesis on Rooneys 

 temperament from the Teletubbies any day now.

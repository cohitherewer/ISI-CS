The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wilander criticises ITF

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Swedes were happy and relieved to have won a tough tie under trying conditions, but didnt leave the capital before delivering a strong message to the International Tennis Federation (ITF). 

The ITF needs to draw guidelines and rules to ensure the safety and good health of the players taking part in Davis Cup. This is a wonderful tournament but it must be run professionally, said Swedish captain Mats Wilander at the post-tie press conference. 

The reference was the playing surface and, on second thoughts, the weather factor. 

The court we played on was so dangerously uneven that it could have resulted in a very serious injury on either side. (Rohan) Bopanna twisted his ankle yesterday (Sunday), hell be out for some time, but it could have been even more serious, said Wilander. 

Thomas Johansson took his criticism one step further, saying that this was the worst tennis court he had ever played on. The receiver is normally in control of the second serve, but one of the second serves of Prakash (Amritraj) flew over my head. It was quite incredible.

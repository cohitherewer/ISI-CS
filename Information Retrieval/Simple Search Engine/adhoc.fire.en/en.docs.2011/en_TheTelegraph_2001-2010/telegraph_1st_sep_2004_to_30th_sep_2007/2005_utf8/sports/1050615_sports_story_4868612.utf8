 County players for camp No. 2

Mumbai: The Indian players, who are playing in the English County circuit and who will figure in the probables list for the forthcoming triangular one-day series in Sri Lanka, would be allowed to skip the conditioning camp, the BCCI said Tues- day. 

[The Telegraph had reported on June 5 that those on the County circuit ? Sourav Ganguly, Harbhajan Singh, Irfan Pathan and Dinesh Mongia ? would be excused from camp No. 1.] 

Like the previous year, players who are playing in the English County circuit would be excused from the physical conditioning camp to be held from the first week of July and would be asked to join the cricket camp to be held later, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said from Thiruvananthapuram. 

The trainer (Gregory King) feels that it would be better to leave them to play on the circuit when the physical conditioning camp is underway, he said. 

All the details about the two phases of the camp would be finalised once coach Greg Chappell arrives in Bangalore Wednesday. 

Hes expected to reach Bangalore directly from Mumbai where he would be in transit only, Nair added. 

Officials of the Bangalore Cricket Academy would extend all assistance for the Indian coach, Nair said 

The tri-series, featuring India, West Indies and hosts Lanka, is to be held from July 26 onwards and Indias first match is tentatively slated for August 1.

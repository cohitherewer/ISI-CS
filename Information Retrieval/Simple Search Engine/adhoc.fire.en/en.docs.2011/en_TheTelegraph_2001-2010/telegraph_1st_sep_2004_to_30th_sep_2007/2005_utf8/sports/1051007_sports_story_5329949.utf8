 Top Pak players rewarded

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday rewarded outstanding performers on the Indian tour by handing them one-step promotion in central contracts. 

Vice-captain Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi were handed category A central contracts, while leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal were promoted to category B. 

Opener Taufeeq Umar, who played against India in the 2004 series, was, however, eliminated from the central contracts list. He was offered a Rs 30,000 monthly retainer. Last year, he was offered a category C contract. 

The PCB central contracts are divided into three categories. Grade I players get a monthly retainer of Rs 2 lakh, Grade II gets Rs 1.25 lakh, and Grade III, Rs 75,000. 

The monthly retainers are over and above the match and tour fees paid to the players. 

The 12-month central contracts and six-month retainers started from July 1, 2005.

 Sangakkara breaks into top 10

Dubai: Sri Lanka wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara was a new arrival in the top ten of the latest ICCs ODI rankings on Monday following his outstanding performance against Australia in the recent one-day Super Series. 

Sangakkara was the leading run scorer for the World XI in the matches played in Melbourne, totalling 138, including two half-centuries, which pushed him 12 places up to No. 9 in the rankings for batsmen. 

Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting retained the top two places after the two Australians impressive scores in the Super Series. 

The only Indian in the top 20 list is Sachin Tendulkar who has maintained his 17th place despite a near six-month injury lay-off. (PTI)

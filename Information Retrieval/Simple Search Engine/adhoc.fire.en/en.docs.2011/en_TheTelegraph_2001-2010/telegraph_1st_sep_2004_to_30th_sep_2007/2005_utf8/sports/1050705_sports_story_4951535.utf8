The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India keen to rediscover form 

Rotterdam: There is nothing glorious about the uncertainties of Indian hockey. 

The stunning 0-4 defeat to Spain last night in the junior World Cup hockey tournament for men here following the 4-1 rout of the Netherlands the previous day has brought to light the thin ice on which the Indian team is skating on. 

Coach Harendra Singh laboured to explain the inconsistency of his team that welcomed a days break Monday. This has always been the bane of Indian hockey. We cannot perform on one level with consistency and this is something I am really worried about, he said.

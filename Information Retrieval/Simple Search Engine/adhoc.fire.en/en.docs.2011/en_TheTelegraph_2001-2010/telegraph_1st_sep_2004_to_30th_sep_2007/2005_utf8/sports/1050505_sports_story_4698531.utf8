 Indian boys advance 

New Delhi: Indian boys advanced to the knockout stage despite going down to Philippines on the third day of the Asia Oceania zone qualifiers in the Junior Davis Cup U-16 challenge in Manila, Philippines, Wednesday. 

The Indians, who put up a good show by beating Pakistan and United Arab Emirates in the earlier matches in group III, succumbed to fourth seeded Philippines in their final league fixture. 

But India, as well as China, progressed by virtue of being the two best second-placed teams at the end of group engagements. 

Australia, Sri Lanka, Chinese Taipei, Philippines, Thailand and Japan ? winners of their respective groups ? are the other countries to advance.

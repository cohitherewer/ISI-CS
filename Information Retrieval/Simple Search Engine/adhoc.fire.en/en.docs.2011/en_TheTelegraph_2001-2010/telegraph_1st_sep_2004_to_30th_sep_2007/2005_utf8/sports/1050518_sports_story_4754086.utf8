 Chandhok also ready for Monaco 

New Delhi: It will be a dream come true for Indias upcoming driver Karun Chandhok when he takes to the street circuit of Monaco in the third round of World Series by Renault championship on Sunday, just before Narain Karthikeyan tests his skills in the F1 race on the same track. 

I am so excited about going to Monaco this weekend and racing around there. I have been watching videos of the Monaco Grand Prix ever since I was four or five-year-old and Ive always dreamt of driving around there, he said. 

Its going to be special driving past the harbour and the famous casino and for sure, this is a highlight of my career. 

The 21-year-old, however, said he was realistic about his chances given that he had never driven a big car on a street circuit.

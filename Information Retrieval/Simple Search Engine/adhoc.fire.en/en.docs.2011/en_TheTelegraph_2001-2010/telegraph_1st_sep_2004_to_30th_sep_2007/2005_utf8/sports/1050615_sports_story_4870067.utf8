 Net hoaxers cancel Sachin-Warne show

London: A fund-raising event involving Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar during the tsunami appeal match on Tuesday has been cancelled because of internet hoaxers. 

Australian leg-spinner Warne was planning to join forces with Tendulkar in offering a fan an unforgettable experience in the mid-innings interval during the match between the MCC and an International XI. 

The highest bidder in an on-line auction was to receive 15 minutes coaching from Tendulkar, who was unable to play in the game after undergoing elbow surgery, before facing an over from Warne on the Lords pitch. 

Organisers had hoped the auction would raise a five-figure sum to help a range of projects in the tsunami-hit areas of Asia but it was discovered that the highest bids were made by hoaxers. 

As the auction ended on Saturday afternoon, there has been insufficient time to arrange for the highest legitimate bidder to come to Lords to receive the coaching from Sachin Tendulkar and to face the over from Shane Warne, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) said in a statement. 

Assaf Admoni, director of fund-raising for the Leonard Cheshire Foundation which arranged the auction, said: Im appalled that people could do this. Theyve wrecked an event that would have raised much-needed funds for a range of very important tsunami recovery and relief projects. (Reuters)

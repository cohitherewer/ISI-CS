 Neelam wants to submit more documents

New Delhi: The doping case against discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh continued to linger on with the athlete now wishing to submit some more documents prompting the panel to postpone a final decision on the matter. 

Neelam has said that she wanted to provide the panel with some more documents pertaining to her case and we can only take a decision once we receive them, Delhi Medical Association secretary Girish Tyagi, one of the members on the four-man panel, said on Wednesday. 

Tyagi, however, could not specify what additional information the athlete wanted to provide. 

The panel, headed by Tamil Nadu Athletics Association president Walter Davaram which has former athletes G. S. Randhawa and Adille Sumariwala as the other members, met on the sidelines of the National Junior Athletics meet held on November 25-29 in Chennai and were expected to arrive at a final decision there. 

Neelam or her counsel did not appear before the panel in Chennai. They may have made the request through a letter to the Athletics Federation of India, Tyagi said. (PTI)

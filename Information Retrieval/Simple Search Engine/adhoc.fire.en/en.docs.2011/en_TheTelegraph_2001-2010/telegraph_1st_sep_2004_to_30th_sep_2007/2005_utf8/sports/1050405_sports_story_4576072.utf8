Georgetown: South Africa were fighting for survival as the intriguing first Test against the West Indies was poised for a last-day epic showdown. 

Forced to follow on 355 runs behind on the penultimate day, the visitors reached 85 for two in their second innings when bad light stopped play three overs early Sunday. 

They had earlier been dismissed for a modest first innings total of 188 (reported in the City and Late City editions of Monday). 

South Africa could have been in an even worse situation at stumps had the West Indies accepted two chances to remove left-hander Jacques Rudolph in the final hour. 

On two, Devon Smith dropped him at slip off Narsingh Deonarine, and on 14, part-time left-arm spin bowler Ryan Hinds dropped a return chance. 

South Africa lost opening batsmen Abraham de Villiers and skipper Graeme Smith in the final period to fast bowlers Reon King and Pedro Collins. 

King made the breakthrough after tea, when De Villiers was bowled for 20, the batsman driving off the backfoot, dragging a wide delivery onto his stumps. 

Collins bowled the South African captain with an in-swinging Yorker in the third over of his final spell of the day to set the visitors back.

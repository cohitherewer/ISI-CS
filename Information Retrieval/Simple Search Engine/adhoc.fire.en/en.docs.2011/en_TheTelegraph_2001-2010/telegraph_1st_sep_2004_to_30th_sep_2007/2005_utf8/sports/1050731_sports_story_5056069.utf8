 Ian helping hand for Gilmour plight

Dambulla: Allrounder Gary Gilmour, who stunned the world of cricket by taking six for 14 in the semi-finals (against England) of the inaugural World Cup, three decades ago, is gravely ill and in urgent need of liver transplant. 

Seeing his one-time teammates plight, former Australian captain Ian Chappell has taken the lead in providing succour. As a first step, he is organising a fund-raising lunch at a premier Sydney hotel on September 23. 

Dennis Lillee and I will speak and special pieces of memorabilia are to be auctioned... The items include three bats autographed by the two Australians (Allan Border, Steve Waugh) to score over 10,000 Test runs and three shirts signed by the two Australians to take over 500 Test wickets (Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath), Ian told The Telegraph. 

Among others, Mark Taylor and Ricky Ponting are lending a helping hand. 

In Sri Lanka as a TV commentator for the tri-series, Ian informed that a lucky guest at the fund-raiser could become Australias 13th man during the face-off with Rest of the World in the Super Test later this season. 

New South Wales recently gave a cheque for $ 30,000 and the Australian Cricketers Association is expected to contribute from its Hardship Fund. 

The transplant itself may not require that much money, but lots has to be done both before and after surgery... The figures are being worked out, Ian said. 

Incidentally, till he came to India last month, Greg Chappell was also doing his bit to help Gilmour. Frankly, Ive not had time to track the progress since Ive taken over as coach, he pointed out. 

Gilmours six-wicket burst was a one-day best till West Indian Winston Davis did one better ? seven for 51 (versus Australia) in the 1983 World Cup. 

Now, of course, the record is held by Sri Lankan spearhead Chaminda Vaas ? eight for 19, against Zimbabwe, in 2001.

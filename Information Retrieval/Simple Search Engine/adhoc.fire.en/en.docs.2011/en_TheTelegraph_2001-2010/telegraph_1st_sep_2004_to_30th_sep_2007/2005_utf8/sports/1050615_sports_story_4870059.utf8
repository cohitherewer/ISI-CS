 Juan Pablo Montoya takes disqualification in stride

 - Its a bit unfair but you have to respect it 

 This was Montoyas second straight disqualification in Montreal 

New York: McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya accepted his Canadian Grand Prix disqualification on Monday with the casual shrug of a man who has been there before. 

Over the years, every time something happens, I get a big penalty... a big everything on me, he said while promoting Formula One on CBS television in the United States. 

Its a little bit unfair, but its their (the stewards) decision and you have to respect it. You have to deal with it, he added of the decision. Whether you like it or not, thats what it is. 

For the second year running, the Colombian left Montreal with a disqualification. Last year, with Williams, he was removed from the classification after the team used oversized brake ducts. 

He was then also black-flagged in the subsequent US Grand Prix for starting from the pitlane in the spare car. 

The decision by stewards to disqualify Montoya on Sunday for leaving the pit lane under a red light seemed harsh to McLaren, who had hoped for a drive-through penalty or less, but it was his second run-in with the authorities in three races. 

Montoya was sent to the back of the grid in Monaco last month for causing an avoidable accident when he slowed unexpectedly in practice on a fast part of the circuit. 

He said that Sundays incident was a bit of everything. 

The Colombian was heading for his first win of the season, leading teammate Kimi Raikkonen after the Renaults of championship leader Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella retired. 

While McLarens race strategy was being agreed on the radios, with Montoya being urged to play safe and slow his pace, the team failed to realise immediately that the safety car was on track.

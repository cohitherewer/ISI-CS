The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal in joint 18th

Houston: Vijai Singh opened the defence of his Houston Open title in record style on Thursday, firing a flawless eight-under-par 64 to grab the first round lead at the Redstone Golf Club. 

Playing his first event since the US Masters, the world No. 2 two closed out his bogey-free round with birdies on three of his final four holes to match the course record and take a one-shot lead over Australians Gavin Coles and Brendan Jones. 

India?s Arjun Atwal, who finished joint second at the Bellsouth Classic in Duluth, Georgia, in the beginning of the month, carded a three-under 69 to finish Day I in 18th place with 12 others, including Daniel Chopra of Sweden. 

The Houston Open is Atwal?s fourth start of the season. He tied 16th at Pebble Beach and finished joint 26th at the Chrysler Classic in Tuscon. 

Sitting three shots off the pace at five-under 67 is a pack of eight golfers, Americans Jeff Maggert, runner-up in Houston three times, Chris Smith, Ted Purdy, Tim Herron, Carl Paulson, Brett Quigley and Jimmy Walker along with Britain?s Greg Owen.

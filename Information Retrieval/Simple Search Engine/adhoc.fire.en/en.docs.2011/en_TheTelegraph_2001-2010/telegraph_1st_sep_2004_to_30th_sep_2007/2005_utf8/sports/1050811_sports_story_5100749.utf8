Chennai/Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was moving towards the boarding gate at Chennai airport, on Wednesday evening, when a co-passenger accosted him. 

Claiming to be an astrologer, he predicted great things for the next two-three years. Taken by surprise, Sourav simply thanked him. 

Cut to Calcutta, a shade over two hours later. 

Sourav had barely got off the Jet aircraft when an airline employee pleaded that he be allowed to embrace dada. He then mustered courage to ask: Apni abar captain hocchen ki na? 

Sourav didnt have to reply ? somebody did (keno hoben na...) on his behalf. Not that the former Team India captain would have commented publicly. 

As announced, the national selectors meet in Mumbai on Friday to pick the captain for Zimbabwe. Everything points to Sourav getting the job back. He lost the captaincy owing to a six-ODI ban. 

The punishment got reduced by two matches. By then, though, Rahul Dravid had been appointed captain for the just-ended tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

Having been out of the last two ODIs against Pakistan, in April, Sourav only missed the first two matches. He played the next three, including Tuesdays final versus Sri Lanka, under Dravid. 

Aware of the sensitivities, Sourav isnt saying anything which could ignite a row in the lead-up to Friday. Im neither wanting nor not wanting the captaincy... I believe in destiny and whatever is destined will happen, he told The Telegraph. 

Did he miss being captain in the tri-series? 

Sourav was, again, politically correct: My role was that of a senior pro and I did the best I could... I wasnt the captain and, so, didnt think about the captaincy... 

Understandably, Sourav preferred not to speak about Dravids leadership in Sri Lanka. Anything I say may be taken out of context... Therefore, I wouldnt like to comment, he said. 

[Significantly, less than 24 hours earlier (in Colombo), Dravid had ducked captaincy-related questions.] 

Asked whether he had analysed why we lost a final which, at one stage, was in our grasp, Sourav replied: In time, thats going to be done by everybody who matters... All I can say is that the disappointment wont go away in a hurry... The loss hurts. 

It does.

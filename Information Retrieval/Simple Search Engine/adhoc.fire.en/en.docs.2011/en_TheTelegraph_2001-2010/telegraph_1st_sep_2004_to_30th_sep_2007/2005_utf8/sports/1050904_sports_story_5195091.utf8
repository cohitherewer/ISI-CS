 England down Wales 1-0

Cardiff: It was hardly the comfortable victory that many predicted, but thanks to Joe Coles second-half strike, England beat Wales 1-0 here on Saturday in their World Cup qualifying campaign. 

Sven-Goran Erikssons squad now require just seven points from their remaining three games to qualify from group six. 

Cole struck nine minutes after half-time, side-footing a Shaun Wright-Phillips centre past Danny Coyne. (AFP)

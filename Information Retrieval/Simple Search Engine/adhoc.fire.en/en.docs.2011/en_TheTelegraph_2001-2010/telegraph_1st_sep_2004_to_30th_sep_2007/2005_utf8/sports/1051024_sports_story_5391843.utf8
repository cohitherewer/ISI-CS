 Jeev ends 24th

Chiba: Jeev Milkha Singh went on a birdie blitz, hitting seven of them in a stretch of eight holes to finish 24th at the ?110 million Bridgestone Open at the Sodegaura Golf and Country Club on Sunday. 

Jeev finished the final round with a score of four-under 68 that saw him finish the week at six-under 282. 

David Smail of New Zealand took the title with a final round of five-under 67 that saw him finish at 16-under 272 with rounds of 66, 72, 67 and 67. His final round had six birdies and one bogey. 

It was Smails fifth Japan Tour win and second following the win at the Acom International last month. Smail is now fifth on the money list in Japan. 

Jeev had a poor start from the tenth as he bogeyed thrice in the first six holes, but then his birdie blitz began on the 16th. He had five birdies on the trot and then after a par added two more on fourth and fifth holes. His last four holes produced pars. 

Jeevs winnings for the week came to ?880,000 and took him to the 38th place in the Japan Tour standings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav steps down as captain

 - RANJI TROPHY MATCHES GET UNDERWAY TODAY 

A STAFF REPORTER/PTI

 Deep will be in charge 

Calcutta/Pune: Sourav Ganguly has stepped down as Bengal Ranji captain for the tie against Maharashtra commencing in Pune on Wednesday. Vice-captain Deep Dasgupta will be in charge. 

It was learnt that Sourav announced his decision at the team meeting on Tuesday evening. He said he doesnt want to lead the side as he may not be available for the entire season and so it would be only fair if Deep led, team manager Samir Dasgupta told The Telegraph from Pune. 

Sourav added that he would guide Deep on the field. 

Souravs decision was obviously influenced by the announcement that Rahul Dravid would lead Team India in the Test series against Sri Lanka. 

The Bengal squad saw a forced change following Ranadeb Boses inclusion in the Board Presidents XI squad to play a three-day tie against Sri Lanka beginning in Bangalore on Saturday. Rookie medium pacer Asok Dinda rushed to Pune in the afternoon. 

Dinda, who has been doing consistently well in the local league and under-22 meet recently, will make his Ranji Trophy debut on Wednesday. 

Sourav may not be leading the side, but the spotlight will once again be on him as the deposed India captain seeks big runs to catch the selectors attention. 

The Bengal team worked out under the watchful eyes of coach Paras Mhambrey, though Sourav stayed away. 

The Maharashtra players also had a brief net session under Australian coach Darren Holder. 

Deep, the former India wicketkeeper, said Bengal hadnt played well last season and wouldnt like to repeat their mistakes. 

Mhambrey informed that Rohan Gavaskar was down with a mild fever but was expected to play. 

Meanwhile, Maharastra Ranji players signed contracts with the Maharashtra Cricket Association for the first time. 

Maharashtra will miss the services of two key players (Munaf Patel and Dheeraj Jadhav) as they have also been included in the Board Presidents squad.

Bengal: Deep Dasgupta(captain), Sourav Ganguly, Arindam Das, Subhamoy Das, Sanjib Sanyal, Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri, Shib Shankar Paul, Asok Dinda. Coach: Paras Mhambrey.

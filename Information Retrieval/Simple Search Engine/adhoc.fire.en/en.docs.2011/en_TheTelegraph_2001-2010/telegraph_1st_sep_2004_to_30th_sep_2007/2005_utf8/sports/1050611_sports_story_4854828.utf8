 Ancheri gets another nod

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation has again forwarded the name of Jo Paul Ancheri for the Arjuna Award after the versatile player missed out on the prestigious award last year. 

We have recommended Ancheris name for this years award, but we have not recommended any name for the Dronacharya Award, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said. 

If chosen, Ancheri will be the 21st footballer to win the honour. Ancheris close friend I. M. Vijayan was the last soccer player to bag the honour in 2002. 

The 29-year-old Ancheri, who twice won the AIFF Player of the Year award in 1994 and 2001, is currently recuperating after a knee surgery in Kerala. 

His exclusion together with that of high jumper Bobby Aloysius from last years list of Arjuna Award list saw sportspersons, officials, coaches and enthusiasts staging protests in Thiruvananthapuram. 

The footballer from Kerala had a mediocre season for Mohun Bagan during the National Football League. He was troubled by injuries and when he returned to fitness looked a pale shadow of his former self. The off-season break should serve him well and he should be back to form during the ensuing season. (PTI)

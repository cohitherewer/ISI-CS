The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Practice on match wicket OK for charity

Auckland: In a departure from international cricket regulations, the New Zealand and World XI teams will be allowed to practice on the match surface on the eve of their three one-dayers, the New Zealand Herald said on Wednesday. 

Each team will be allowed an hour?s practice in the hope that the exposure will take early sting out of the wicket and counter one of the game?s biggest problems ? that limited over matches are effectively decided in the first 20 overs. 

In terms of international cricket, the move comes as a radical concept, as match pitches usually remain in the control of groundsman until the start of play, and are off limits to players. 

But the International Cricket Council (ICC) decision not to give the matches full one-day International status has provided an experimental window for New Zealand Cricket, which received stinging criticism for preparing bowler-friendly pitches against India two years ago. 

New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said he was interested in seeing how the new practice conditions worked out. 

?People are obviously working hard on solutions and if this is going to make a better contest I?m all for it,? Fleming said. 

The three matches were hastily arranged to provide extra competition for New Zealand after the Sri Lankan tour was cut short following the devastating tsunami which swept through south Asia three weeks ago. 

Fleming brushed aside speculation that the series will turn into more of a festival because of its fund-raising aspect to provide aid for tsunami victims. ?No, that won?t happen because the players won?t allow it to,? he said.

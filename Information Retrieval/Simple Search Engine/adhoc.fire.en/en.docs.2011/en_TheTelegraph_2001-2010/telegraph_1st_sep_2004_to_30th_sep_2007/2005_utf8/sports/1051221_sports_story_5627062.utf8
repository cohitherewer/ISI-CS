 Caro to coach Real till season-end

Madrid: Real Madrid announced on Monday that caretaker coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro will continue in his post until end of the season on vice-president Emilio Butraguenos recommendation. 

Im really satisfied by the news, Lopez Caro was quoted as saying by Spanish media. Im full of enthusiasm and aware of the responsibility that I now have. 

Real Madrid is a great club and I will have some great players at my disposal who all want to help improve the level of the team. 

Lopez Caro was promoted from reserve team coach on a caretaker basis when previous boss Vanderlei Luxemburgo was sacked earlier this month after just 11 months in the job. 

The 42-year-old has been at the club for four years and won widespread praise for steering Reals B team, Castilla, to promotion into the second division last season. 

He is the sixth coach to have been in charge of Real since Vicente del Bosque was discarded in June 2003. 

Lopez Caro has been at the helm of the first team for three matches with a side full of reserve team players slipping to a 1-2 defeat in his opening game in the Champions League against Olympiakos Piraeus. 

Just over a week ago, a near full-strength side secured a morale-boosting 2-0 away win over Malaga in the Primera Liga, but they only managed a 1-1 draw against 10-man Osasuna at the Bernabeu on Sunday, a result that did little to appease the clubs restless fans.

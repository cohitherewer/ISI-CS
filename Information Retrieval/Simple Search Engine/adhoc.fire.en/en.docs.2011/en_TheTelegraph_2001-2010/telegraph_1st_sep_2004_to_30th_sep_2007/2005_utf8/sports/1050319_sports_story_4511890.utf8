The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mumbai fall for 251

 Amol Muzumdar top-scored with 75 

Mumbai: Punjab skittled out defending champions Mumbai for a paltry 251 in the first innings and then themselves were on 42 for two at stumps on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy elite division semi-final on Fri-day. 

Opting to bat first after winning the toss, the hosts were in deep trouble within the first half hour as they lost openers Vinayak Mane and Wasim Jaffer cheaply to Punjab mediumpacer Gagandeep Singh to be 23 for two. 

Before the first session was over, Mumbai had slumped to 92 for five, with Gagandeep and fellow mediumpacers Vikram Singh and Reetinder Singh Sodhi striking once each. 

However, the home team recovered through a fighting 83-run stand for the sixth wicket between topscorer Amol Muzumdar (75, 4x10) and Ajit Agarkar (47, 4x8). 

But, after Muzumdar?s departure, the hosts crumbled once more. He offered a tame catch to mid-off after being beaten in the air by left-arm spinner Navdeep Singh. 

Ramesh Powar made a quickfire 32 but Mumbai were all out 45 minutes into the third sess- ion. 

The hosts, however, fought back in superb fashion through left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulk-arni. 

He got rid off makeshift opener Gaurav Gupta and Indian international Yuvraj Singh in the space of four balls in his third over before opener Ravneet Ricky and captain Dinesh Mongia took the team to stumps without further loss. 

In the morning, the Mumbai batsmen failed to cope with the lateral movement obtained by Punjab pacemen. 

Mane, Jaffer and Vineet Indulkar all perished by edging the ball. 

Things looked bleak for Mumbai at 34 for three before Muzumdar was joined by left-hander Nishit Shetty and the duo slowly rebuilt the innings. 

The fourth wicket pair carried the score to 73 when Shetty was trapped leg before by Sodhi who, however, suffered a shoulder injury at the fag end of the innings when trying to stop a boundary. He could not open the innings as a consequence. 

Gagandeep was the most successful bowler, finishing with four for 67. 

Brief scores 

Mumbai 251 (Amol Muzumdar 75, Ajit Agarkar 47; Gagandeep Singh 4/67). Punjab 42/2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gavaskar, Vengsarkar may have role to play

 - Instead of CEO, Board may appoint two very senior pros 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Gavaskar and Vengsarkar 

Chennai: Instead of a much talked about Chief Executive Officer, the Board may actually appoint two very senior professionals ? general manager (cricket operations) and general manager (finance and marketing). 

A suggestion to that effect was made during newest president Union minister Sharad Pawars informal discussion with members of his group in Calcutta on Wednesday morning. 

Mr Pawar would like the two biggest roles to be separated, something he has managed to do in Mumbai, and handled professionally. However, any move towards professionalism must first be approved by the working committee, a senior member of his group told The Telegraph. 

The first working committee meeting under the new dispensation is going to be held in Mumbai on Sunday. Apparently, Pawar wants it to meet once every month and not at irregular intervals. 

Given the respect Pawar has for Sunil Gavaskar and his fondness for Dilip Vengsarkar ? former India captains both ? its assumed that one or both can have a big role in his regime. 

While the general manager (cricket operations) may be hand-picked by Pawar, the other general manager ? provided the working committee gives its approval ? will probably be recruited from the market, after an advertisement is put out. 

The push towards making the Board professional ? something attempted by Dr A.C. Muthiah ? is going to be discussed on Sunday. Incidentally, the (honorary) secretarys post wont be abolished.

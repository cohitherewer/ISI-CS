Kuala Lumpur: India escaped from the jaws of defeat to hold New Zealand 2-2 in their second outing of the Azlan Shah Cup here on Friday. 

Trailing by two first-half goals ? scored by Darren Smith (21st minute) and Bevan Hari (25th) ? India salvaged a point thanks to a 44th-minute strike by Rajpal Singh followed by Prabhjot Singhs 63rd-minute equaliser. 

In a pulsating duel later, Olympic champions Australia rallied to hold Asian Games gold-medallists South Korea 3-3. Korea, who led 1-0 at the break, scored through strikers Eun Seong-hong (19th and 38th) and Hyo Sik-you (69th). For Australia, Luke Doerner (52nd), Michael McCann (63rd) and Travis Brooks (66th) were the scorers. 

India had more of the possession and made more forays into the rival striking zone, but it was the New Zealanders who snatched the initiative by grabbing both opportunities that came their way. A measure of Indias domination is reflected in the number of penalty corners the teams got ? India eight, New Zealand none. 

Indias lone penalty corner of the opening session came when Rajpals hit was warded off dangerously by Dean Cousins in the 15th minute. Aiyappas flick was saved by goalkeeper Paul Woolford, while the rebound taken by Prabhjot hit the crosspiece. 

Prabhjot was a thorn on the left flank as he often caught Richard Petherick and Cousins on the wrong foot. He did not, however, find much support from Deepak Thakur or Sandeep Michael, who squandered two chances. 

The Kiwis took the lead when Aiyappa faltered with a clearance. Devesh Chauhan kept out Philips Burrows try but failed to stop Smiths rebound. 

India missed a chance to equalise when Suresh Kumar failed to capitalise on a Prabhjot set-up. 

India conceded a soft second goal following another Aiyappa lapse on top of the circle. Hari seized the opportunity to bang the ball home. 

The Indians went full steam to reduce the margin. But with Rajpal, Prabhjot and Michael unable to convert chances, the Indians took to half-time with the two-goal deficit. 

After the crossover, it was India all the way again. They earned seven penalty corners but Aiyappa ? who scored both goals versus South Africa on Thursday ? could not deliver. 

India brought back Inderjit Chadha, who was injured in the first game, as a linkman. This paid dividends. 

Cousins got temporary marching orders for blocking Rajpal. India, with a one-man advantage, reduced the margin when Rajpal found the mark from a goalmouth skirmish. 

India were all over the Kiwi area but excellent goalkeeping by Woolford denied them a second goal. 

The equaliser eventually came from the last penalty corner. It was an indirect conversion by Prabhjot, who got the ball from Tirkey with just the goalkeeper to beat. 

India pressed for the winner in the final five minutes, but Thakur and Arjun Halappas attempts were well negotiated by New Zealand. 

India have four points from two games and will face Malaysia on Sunday. (PTI)

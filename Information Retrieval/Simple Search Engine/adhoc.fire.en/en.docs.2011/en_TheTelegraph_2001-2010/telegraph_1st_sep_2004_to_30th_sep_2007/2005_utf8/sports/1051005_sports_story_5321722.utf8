 2nd Irani Trophy for Railways in four seasons

 - Rest floored with nearly two days to spare 

 Kartik put up an allround show 

New Delhi: Railways lifted the Irani Trophy after completing a nine-wicket victory with nearly two days to spare against Rest of India at the Karnail Singh Stadium here on Tuesday. 

The Ranji Trophy champions needed only an hour on the fourth morning to knock off the required 50 runs in the second innings to bag the coveted trophy for the second time in four seasons. 

Amit Pagnis denied Rest an outside chance of a miracle as he stroked seven fours en route to 33 before being run out. 

It was a bit of an anti-climax for Pagnis as the umpires pulled out the stumps and the players congratulated each other quite prematurely as they went by the scoreboard which turned out to be wrong. 

Immediately on resumption, with two more runs still needed, Pagnis failed to beat Rudra Pratap Singhs throw. 

Railways, who had won the title in 2002, were richer by Rs 2 lakh. 

Coach Vinod Sharma said the team owed its triumph to the strong tail that pulled them out of rouble in the first innings. 

It always happens with us. Our tail is very strong and has come to our rescue on many occasions. It happened in the Ranji final also, Sharma said. 

He also praised Murali Kartik, who hit a career best 96 and shared a 151-run stand with Yere Goud for the seventh wicket which enabled the hosts take an 88-run first-innings lead after they had been reduced to 104 for six at one stage. 

The left-arm spinner also took five wickets in the match. 

Kartik proves himself whenever he gets a chance... He always delivers, Sharma said. 

While Railways celebrated, it was a sombre atmosphere in the Rest dressing room. (PTI)

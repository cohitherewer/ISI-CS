 Hingis to return at Gold Coast

Sydney: Five-time Grand Slam singles champion Martina Hingis will make a return to professional tennis in an Australian hardcourt tournament in early January, opening the way for a place in the Australian Open, it was announced on Tuesday. 

The Swiss former No. 1 will compete in the Mondial Australian Womens Hardcourts on the Gold Coast ? where Maria Sharapova will also be in the fray ? from January 2 to 7. 

Im very excited to be making my return to competitive tennis in Australia, I have always felt at home on the Australian courts, Hingis said in a statement. 

Im really looking forward to competing again and making my first trip to the Gold Coast. 

I know Ill get some tough matches and it will allow me to get used to the Australian summer coming from the European winter, both of which will be helpful with my preparation for the Australian Open, she added. 

Hingis achieved world No. 1 status in March 1997, aged 16, and held the title for 209 non-consecutive weeks until 2001. 

She has won the Australian Open three times ? in 1997, 1998 and 1999 ? and reached the final on three other occasions before retiring due to recurring injuries in 2002. 

Director of the Gold Coast tournament Liz Smylie said she was thrilled Hingis would be playing in the event. 

Martina is a legend of womens tennis and an unbelievable performer in Australia, Smylie said. 

Hingis, 25, announced last month that she would return to game and is expected to play the Medibank International in Sydney before heading to Melbourne for the Australian Open later in January. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid is favoured to continue

 - Souravs comeback certain in Test series 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly 

Calcutta: Rahul Dravid is strongly favoured to keep the Team India captaincy for the three-Test series against Sri Lanka, beginning in Chennai on December 2, but Sourav Ganguly is going to figure in the 14/15. 

The former captain, though, wont (as of late Sunday) be making his ODI comeback either at the Eden or at the Wankhede ? venues for the last two matches of the ongoing series versus South Africa. 

The squad for the last two ODIs and the first Test (if not the first two) will be picked at the same selection meeting, in Chennai on Wednesday, not many hours after the third face-off between India and South Africa. 

One understands the 15 chosen for Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai is going to be retained for the last two matches as well. 

The selection of the Test squad has been advanced (from November 28) for tactical reasons ? to mollify those Calcuttans whore incensed at the continued exclusion of Sourav from ODIs. 

The Eden match is on Friday and Souravs Test selection, two-days before that, should eliminate the chance of protests and/or trouble during the ODI, a source told The Telegraph. 

The captain for the Test series, however, will be picked on Tuesday. 

Appointed till November 28, Dravid is set for an extended run ? but a strong pitch to retain Sourav (and usher in split captaincy) is bound to be made. Incidentally, never before has Dravid been given charge full-time in the sports traditional form. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, is our most successful Test captain and led India to their first series win outside the sub-continent in 19 years in his last assignment ? Zimbabwe, earlier this season. 

Much has changed since.

 Kapur in joint lead

Rayong (Thailand): Riding on a wave of top-10 finishes in recent weeks, Shiv Kapur rose to a new high with a seven-under-par 66 that gave him the share of the first round lead at the $300,000 Double A International Open on Thursday. 

 Kapur ended the day atop the leaderboard alongside Scotsman Kenny Walker, who enjoyed a bogey-free outing at the challenging St Andrews Hill Golf Club. 

Kapur, on a roll with four top-10s in his last five events, did not have the best of starts with a bogey on the second hole. But he bounced back strongly with birdies on the third, seventh, eighth, ninth, 11th, 14th, 17th and 18th holes. 

He parred the par-six fourth hole. 

Rahil Gangjee, Ashok Kumar and Harmeet Kahlon all shot two-under 71 to be tied 20th. Amandeep Johl, Digvijay Singh, Arjun Singh and Mukesh Kumar all brought in par cards of 73 each to be tied 45th. 

Last weeks runner-up Gaurav Ghei went one-over 74 for tied 63rd. 

Vivek Bhandari (75, tied 85th), Firoz Ali (76, tied 99th) and Uttam Singh Mundy (78, tied 116th) are the other Indians in the fray. 

Kapur may well have been the sole leader if not for a missed five-foot eagle putt after he crashed a stunning five wood from 247 yards that stopped close to the pin on the par five 18th. 

 Current Asian Tour Order of Merit leader Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand, winner of the Hero Honda Indian Open last week, scored a 69 and remained within striking reach in eighth place.

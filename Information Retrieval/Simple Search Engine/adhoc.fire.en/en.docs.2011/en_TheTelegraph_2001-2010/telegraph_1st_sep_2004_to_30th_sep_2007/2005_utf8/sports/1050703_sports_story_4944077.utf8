 Gregs priorities fantastic: Srinath

Bangalore: Former Indian speedster Jawagal Srinath has termed coach Greg Chappells priorities as fantastic, noting that the first thing he focused on was fast bowlers. 

His priorities are fantastic, Srinath said here on Saturday. He has focused first on fast bowlers. Thats the right way to go about it. 

Srinath, associated with the MRF Pace Foundation, interacted with fast bowlers ? along with the foundations director and Australian pace legend Dennis Lillee ? who are undergoing a pre-season physical conditioning camp. 

Chappell has taken good stock of what he has (fast bowlers) and what can translate into higher level. I dont think anybody has done that before, he said. 

Srinath made it clear that spinner-friendly tracks in India were responsible for India not producing many world-class fast bowlers. 

I want three fast bowlers to play in each Test match; but that will happen only when we have good wickets. 

The former speedster said faulty bowling actions could also be one of the reasons for some of the fast bowlers in India being on the injury list often.

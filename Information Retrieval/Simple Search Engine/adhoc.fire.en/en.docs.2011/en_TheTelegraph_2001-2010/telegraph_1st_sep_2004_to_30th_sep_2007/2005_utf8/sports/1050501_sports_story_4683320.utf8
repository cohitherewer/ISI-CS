The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal in sole lead

 - NEW ORLEANS CLASSIC 

Avondale (Louisiana): Arjun Atwal (AP picture above) tamed the gusty winds and took sole possession of the lead with a four-under-par 68 in the second round at the $5.5 million Zurich Classic of New Orleans. The Indian, who was 11-under for 36 holes, led J.J. Henry by one stroke. 

The 32-year-old is the first Indian to play on the PGA Tour and he added another first by holding outright lead for the first time here. 

The two-time winner on the European Tour overcame winds which went up to 25mph at one stage. 

While Henry posted a second straight 67 to be 10-under, Chris DiMarco, who shared overnight lead with Atwal, returned eight-under par 71 to be tied third with Tim Clark (69). 

Atwal began sedately with five pars before finding two birdies on sixth and seventh, but he dropped a shot on ninth and turned at one-under. It was on the back nine, when the winds went up, that he started piling up the birdies. 

He birdied the 10th, 14th and 15th before bogeying the 16th and then picked his last birdie on the 18th. Five of his six birdies were from inside eight feet. 

On the par-3 14th, he chipped in from more than 50 feet from a bunker for a great birdie. 

?I got off to a slow start when there was no wind and when the wind started to pick up the conditions became pretty similar to yesterday (Thursday) and that?s when I started focusing a little more and started making some putts and made some birdies out there,? Atwal said. 

Daniel Chopra brought in a two-under 70 and was tied at 21st with three-under 141. 

Defending champion Vijai Singh, followed an opening 67 with a 71 and was in a three-way tie for sixth place at six-under. He was five strokes behind Atwal. 

About his last season, Atwal said: ?You know, our baby was coming along. We had no family in America at the time, so every time I missed a cut or was close to making a cut, I wasn?t even thinking about the cut. I was thinking of going back to my wife and taking care of her. As soon as the baby came along, I started doing well again.? 

DiMarco had an inconsistent round that included an eagle, four birdies, three bogeys and a double bogey. At 10-under heading to the par-5 18th, DiMarco hit his tee shot into the water to the right of the fairway and scrambled to make a double-bogey seven.

 Red Bull, Ferrari extend deal to 2012

London: Red Bull have joined champions Ferrari in agreeing to extend Formula Ones existing commercial agreement to 2012. 

Red Bull Racing confirms that it has reached an understanding with FOA (Formula One Administration) to prolong the current Concorde Agreement from 2008 until 2012, the team announced on its website. 

The Concorde Agreement between the teams, the governing international automobile federation (FIA) and commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestones FOA expires at the end of 2007. Only Ferrari, of the 10 teams, had previously agreed to extend the agreement. 

The others were considering their options with the major manufacturers ? Renault, BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota and Honda ? planning to set up their own series from 2008. 

Team boss Christian Horner said Red Bull, owned by Austrian energy drink billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz, had simply acted as they saw fit. This was a totally independent decision. (Reuters)

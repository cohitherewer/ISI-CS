 New Delhi: India?s disappointing show in the world shotgun championships ended on Monday when Manavjit Singh Sandhu finished 17th in men?s trap event and Aarti Singh Rao was 24th in women?s skeet in Lonato, Italy. Sandhu began with a perfect 25/25 but went down in the next three rounds with scores of 23, 23 and 22. Though the Indian came back with a 24 in the last round his total of 117/125 points gave him the 17th spot in a field of 140.

 The other Indians in the fray, Anwer Sultan finished 29th with a score of 114 while Zorawar Singh Sandhu ended 88th with a tally of 93 points. The trio?s performance saw India finish 12th in the men?s trap team standings.

 New Delhi: Indian cricket?s new coach Greg Chappell has refuted claims that he was an ambassador for animals rights organisation Peta. ?I wish to refute the claim by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals that I am or will be a spokesperson for that organisation,? Chappell said in a statement Monday. Peta had issued a statement a few days back, saying Chappell recommended vegetarianism in his book titled Health and Fitness. The former Australian captain said Peta was wrong to use his name for their ?wider campaigns?. ?Some years ago I gave permission to a representative of the Peta organisation to reprint a book of mine for use in Indian market to promote a healthy lifestyle. At no stage did I agree to become an ambassador for their wider campaigns. I will be contacting Peta and asking them for an apology.? 

 Hanoi: A Vietnamese soccer referee has been suspended pending an investigation into his alleged involvement in match fixing, state-controlled media reported on Monday. Referee Luong Trung Viet has been accused of brokering to fix matches in the V-League and the first division, the newspaper said.

 He is the first referee to be suspended on match fixing charges.

 The newspaper quoted the V-League organisers as saying they found cell phone messages between Viet and another referee that implicated him. Accusations also came from other referees, the newspaper said, adding that Viet was only ?a very small chain? in the match fixing ring.

 Bucharest: Gheorghe Hagi has handed in his resignation as coach of Turkish side Galatasaray after admitting to feeling frustrated at a lack of support from the club?s directors during his year in charge. The former Romanian playmaker made his announcement after Galatasaray?s 4-0 victory over Denizlispor in the final round of the Turkish League at the weekend to finish third in the standings. Despite winning the Turkish Cup earlier this month, the Istanbul side?s hopes of celebrating their centenary year in style have been dampened by missing out on a spot in next season?s Champions League.

 Milan: Udinese coach Luciano Spalletti says his Czech international defender Marek Jankulovski is to join Champions League runners up AC Milan. ?Yes, Jankulovski is Milan?s. That is what I have been told,? Spalletti told Italy?s Sky Sport television on Sunday.

 Udinese drew 1-1 with Milan on Sunday, a result which earned them a fourth-place finish in Serie A and a place in the qualifying round of the Champions League for the first time.

 Jankulovski has been widely expected to leave the club at the end of this season.

 IN THE CITY

 The tickets will be priced at Rs 1200, 900, 750 and 550 for the November 25 one-day International against South Africa to be hosted at the Eden Gardens. In its working committee meeting on Saturday, CAB has kept the prices the same as it was in the India-Pakistan ODI. ?Only Rs 900 tickets for the Block J spectators are new in this ODI,? a CAB official said. The prices of the tickets for the club players and school cricketers have been kept the same (Rs 150). 

 German coach Torsten Spittler was disappointed at the poor infrastructure in top Indian soccer clubs ? Mohun Bagan and East Bengal ? and their tendency to employ coaches without valid licenses.

 Spittler said: ?Infrastructure in the top clubs here is very poor. Considering the fact that there is a huge turnout of spectators during matches involving big clubs, lack of facilities is totally unacceptable.?

 Riding Partha Karmakar?s three goals, Siliguri MKP outplayed Burdwan DSA 4-0 to advance to the final of the Dendrite Cup inter-district football tournament on Saturday. Prabir Bose completed the margin for the winners. In Sunday?s final, Siliguri will face Hooghly DSA.

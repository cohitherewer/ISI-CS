 Shoaib predicts hell of a series versus India

 - Credit for Pak transformation goes to Inzy 

 Shoaib says Pakistan have several matchwinners 

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar said on Thursday that his teams 2-0 victory over England in the recent Test series had set up the prospects of an interesting contest against India who visit Pakistan early next year. 

Our victory sets up the prospects of one hell of a series (against India) because the pundits had more or less written us off for the series against England. 

But the team proved the critics wrong and instead earned praise and appreciation for a thoroughly professional performance that has to be attributed to a combined team effort, said Akhtar, the leading wicket-taker in the series with 17 scalps. 

Pakistan won the Multan Test by 22 runs after conceding a first-innings lead of 144 and wrapped up the series in Lahore where they won by an innings and 100 runs. 

Indias tour of Pakistan, for three Tests and five ODIs, starts on January 6. 

Akhtar said the England series had provided an excellent opportunity to Pakistan to assess preparations for the series against India. Our series win over England proves that we are heading in the right direction as far as preparations for the India series is concerned. 

In 2004, we were a much younger and inexperienced side and consequently lost to India? Now we are more experienced, mature and combined outfit, the fast bowler said. 

In the series against England, we also proved that we have more than one matchwinner in Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Danish Kaneria, Salman Butt, Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Shahid Afridi, Akhtar said. 

The speedster credited Pakistans transformation to Inzamam, with whom he has not always seen eye to eye in the past. I think the entire credit for this transformation goes to skipper Inzamam who has not only established himself as a great leader but a huge motivator who inspired the team with his performance. 

As far as I am concerned, Inzamam was the major difference in the series against England, Akhtar said of his captain who aggregated 431 runs with two centuries and three fifties. I am enjoying my bowling as much as I am enjoying the company of Inzamam, he said. Asked if Pakistans victory over England makes them the second-best team in the world after Australia, Akhtar said he did not attach much importance to rankings. 

To me, rankings dont matter at all. When you are playing for your country, ranking doesnt count. The only thing that matters is your commitment and hunger to deliver the goods for the nation and the team. 

Akhtar observed that praying five times a day had united the team. The difference between this team and ones I have played in the past is of namaz (prayers). The boys have started backing each other, their tolerance level has increased and they are always there when someone needs them to lift their dampened spirits, he said.

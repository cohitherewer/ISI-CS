 Miandad?s notice to PCB 

 Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad 

 wants the country?s top cricket body to apologise publicly 

 for terminating his contract as coach of the national team 

 this year. 

 Although Miandad?s contract was due to expire in April 

 2005, Englishman Bob Woolmer replaced him as the coach in 

 July, a month after Miandad was sacked by the Pakistan Cricket 

 Board (PCB). 

?The manner in which the PCB unlawfully terminated Miandad?s contract brought great pain and injury to his honour and dignity in the eyes of his die-hard fans and the cricketing world at large,? Miandad?s lawyer, Mohammad Ali Qureshi, said in a legal notice served to the PCB chairman, Shaharyar Khan. He said Miandad is seeking a ?suitable public apology? from the board. 

?In case the same is not done, we have instructions from Miandad to take appropriate legal action against PCB,? the notice said. 

 The PCB spokesman Abbas Zaidi confirmed that it had 

 received the notice and would discuss the matter with its 

 ?legal advisers before taking any appropriate measures.?

 Streak hits 68 on return

Port Elizabeth: Former captain Heath Streak returned to international action for Zimbabwe with a battling 68 in the third one-dayer against South Africa on Wednesday. 

Streak, playing his first international game since settling a year-long dispute with the board of Zimbabwe Cricket, came to the crease with his team in deep trouble on 35 for five. He then steadied the innings with Brendan Taylor (41) and Gavin Ewing (46) to help the tourists to 206 for eight in their 50 overs. 

Streak?s composure and sensible strokeplay was crucial after opening bowlers Charl Langeveldt and Monde Zondeki ripped through the top order to leave the visitors at 32 for four in the 10th over. 

Captain Tatenda Taibu was then run out for a duck three overs later. 

Taylor and Streak, however, carefully added 67 for the sixth wicket before Streak and Ewing hammered 88 off 91 balls to ensure some respectability. (Reuters)

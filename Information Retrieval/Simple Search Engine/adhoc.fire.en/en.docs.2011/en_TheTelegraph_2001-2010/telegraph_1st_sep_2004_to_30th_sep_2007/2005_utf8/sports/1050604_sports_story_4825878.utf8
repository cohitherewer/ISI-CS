 Eswarah claims Oaks 

 Epsom: Joint-favourite Eswarah galloped to a smooth victory in the Epsom Oaks under jockey Richard Hills on Friday.

 The unbeaten filly, trained by Michael Jarvis, had half-a-length to spare over Something Exciting (7-1), ridden by Richard Quinn, with Pictavia (8-1) three lengths back in third. English 1,000 Guineas winner Virginia Waters, sent off at 11-4 along with Eswarah, was fourth. Kieren Fallon partnered Virginia Waters. Eswarahs dam, Midway Lady, won the Oaks in 1986. (REUTERS)

 A fascinating fortnight on clay

 It was sad to see Mary rsquo;s great effort end in a cloudburst of tears 

The testing red clay at Roland Garros scripted a fascinating fortnight at the French Open. The fall of Roger Fererer and the birth of a new star, 19-year-old left-handed Spaniard Rafael Nadal, created a stir in the tennis world. Nadal, the new champion, brought a delightful freshness to the championships. 

Bursting with youthful energy in his colourful sleeveless shirt, calf length shorts and a white bandanna keeping his long hair in place, he played his matches with a halogen intensity. His speed of foot, enthusiasm and fighting spirit was beyond belief. On the slow clay courts nothing seemed to be beyond his reach. This omnipotence forced his opponents into error as they went for more on their shots. 

When Nadal leapt in the air with a scissors jump after an impossible set, it seemed to be more full of joy than triumph. In todays world of rock hard professionals, where giving a centimetre is unheard of, Nadal corrected two bad calls and gave the points to Puerta in the final. How refreshing. 

Nadal employs an extreme western grip and imparts a prodigious amount of topspin on his forehand. A deep shot pushes the receiver further back from the baseline, forcing him to play his ground shots awkwardly at shoulder level. For the volleyer the excess spin makes it difficult to control the volley and read the trajectory of Nadals shots. 

All things put together, Nadal has an impregnable game on clay, as Federer found to his dismay. Till the semi-finals, Federer was like a flag-ship in full sail, effortlessly gliding past the rowboat talents of the earlier rounds. He seemed unprepared for the turbulent impact of Nadals gale force onslaught and fell without any semblance of a fight. 

Nadal now hold a two matches-to-one edge over Federer. Fererers invincible image has been badly shaken. Even in earlier tournaments he has been under pressure, winning by slim tie-breaker margins and the pack is now hot on his heels. 

There were other facets of the Open which put it in a special category. Two of the four finalists in the mens and womens singles fell one match short of fairytale endings. 

Unseeded Mariano Puertas performance became a symbol of hope for those struggling in the lower echelons of the game. Branded a drug cheat for taking clenbuterol, a medication for asthma which also promotes muscle growth, and suspended for nine months he came back from a ranking of 400 to the final of a Grand Slam! He fought and fought and fought through his matches and came through against what seemed to be insurmountable odds. 

Against Nadal in the final, despite an injured thigh strapped by a trainer in the fifth game of the first set, he just refused to give in. Three set points in the fourth set which Puerta could not clinch would have taken Nadal to the brink and forced him into a final set. It was a heroic performance deserving the highest praise. 

Mary Pierce, a 30-year-old six feet statuesque blonde, born in Canada, based in the US and playing under the French flag, won the French open in 2000. Her unbelievable comeback was only one step short of the 2005 title. Her emotional frailty reasserted itself in the final and it was sad to see Marys great effort end in a cloudburst of tears. The crowd chanted Allez Mary Allez Mary, but she had nothing more to give. 

Yet another fairytale, but with a happier ending was the comeback of Justine Henin-Hardenne. Impossible is nothing is reported to be her mantra. Confined to bed with a virus for 10 months last year and then hit by knee and back problems with a dicey sciatic nerve thrown in for good measure, she triumphs in spectacular fashion. 

Now 23 years of age her great heart and determination is reflected in her statement when talking about her late mother who died of cancer about 11 years ago. The really hard times in my life made me stronger. Losing my mother so early changed my personality, but made me a more determined person. 

Henin-Hardenne maybe small in height and built looking frail as compared to the Amazons in the womens game, but her mental strength, fighting heart and focus are equalled by none. She is as tough as nails. All the shots are there, spearheaded by a peerless single-handed backhand down the line. She is fearless, and goes for her shots even when she is under great pressure. If she can totally get over the effects of the virus, many more Grand Slam titles are in store for her. 

The womens game is in a shambles. Serena Williams is injured, sister Venus lost to 15-year-old Bulgarian Sesil Karatantcheva, last years champion Anastasia Myskina of Russia has lost form due to her mothers serious illness, Kim Clijsters is patched up and back but has been advised to be careful about her repaired knee ligaments and Lindsay Davenport folded like an accordion against Mary Pierce, and the most spectacular thing third-seeded Amelie Mauresmo did was ride to Roland Garros on her Harley Davidson motorcycle. She lost to 17-year-old Ana Ivanovic from Belgrade in the round of 16. 

The Russians faded out and the womens semi-finals were poor, one-sided matches. The final was a 6-1, 6-1 washout in record time as Henin-Hardenne slammed the door on Mary Pierce. 

In sharp contrast, the mens matches were of an amazing standard, bitterly contested with many breathtaking rallies. 

The game on clay is now dominated by Spain, Argentina and the Russians with a lone interloper. The US are nowhere in the picture and no exciting talent was spotted in the tournament. Roddick seeded No. 2, like the illustrious Pete Sampras, is just not used to long, teasing, testing rallies of more than three to four shots. The American psyche demands instant shootouts, while on clay courts rallies are long and the points have to be patiently constructed. 

For Andre Agassi, now 35 years of age, who can play well on any surface, the parole is over and Father Time has him in custody. 

We live in an age of specialisation. The levels of skill are sky high. Different surfaces require a different variety of shots, different techniques and different attitudes. It is most unlikely that we will ever again see a champion who can win all four Grand Slams. 

Nadal, with his extreme western grip, will find it difficult to tackle the low bounce on Wimbledons grass, and the fast court will make it impossible to retrieve shots which he would on slow clay. Also, it will be difficult to hit passing. But, with practically no serve and volleyers around, he may be able to adjust if he does not lose early. 

Looking beyond the forehands and backhands and the do-or-die attitude of the competitors one comes across the most attractive of sporting qualities. The fightback from the depths of despair with a never-say-die attitude. This tournament had an abundance of bravehearts with great fighting spirit. Henin-Hardenne put it beautifully when she said Impossible is nothing. This is the magic mantra of success and life.

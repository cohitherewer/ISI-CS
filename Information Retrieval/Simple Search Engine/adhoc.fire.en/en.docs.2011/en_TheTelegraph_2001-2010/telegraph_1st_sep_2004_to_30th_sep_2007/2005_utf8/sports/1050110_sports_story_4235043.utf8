The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Second fund-raiser on February 15

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Melbourne: The second tsunami fund-raiser, between an ICC XI and the Asia XI, will be held on February 15 and not 16, as originally planned. Australia?s tour of New Zealand has necessitated this change. 

Meanwhile, according to The Telegraph?s sources, some of the Indian players feel that the ODI ought to be in tsunami-affected Chennai and not Calcutta which is being favoured owing to the high-capacity Eden. 

The venue is going to be decided by the Asian Cricket Council.

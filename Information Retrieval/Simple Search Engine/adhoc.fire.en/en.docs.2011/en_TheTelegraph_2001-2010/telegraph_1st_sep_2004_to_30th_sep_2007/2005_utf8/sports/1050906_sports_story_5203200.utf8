 Favourites managed good odds 

 STAR RACER

 Sanskaras victory in the 1,400m Calcutta Fillies Trial Stakes, on Wednesday, may be simply summed up as smashing. The first Classic of the season, in fact, was hardly a contest even for the second slot, which Regal Empress claimed from a non-too-keen Clockwork.

 Clockwork, the second favourite, had been in a futile chase of the winner, a Bharath Singh-trainee ridden by Suraj Narredu, till 300m from home. However, once the 35-100 hot favourite drew away from the field, Clockwork was spared of punishing run, therefore, making it easy for the Empress to overtake in the closing stages of the race.

 The afternoon was, otherwise, ruled by the Daniel David-I. Chisty and Vijay Singh-C. Alford combinations ? with a treble apiece. Contests in some of the events, claimed by the two sets of professionals, were close, but what came as surprise was that each of the two trainers managed to get good odds on their favourites who delivered the goods.

 Daniels Ocean Spirit, for instance, was an even-money favourite against Javed Khans Express Rose, drawing support at 6-4 in the Fairy Heights Handicap. Chistys power-packed riding, however, proved as a decisive factor in the race in which the verdict could have gone either way. 

 Chisty did never get a chance to show his artistry on Noble Flash and Mighty Flash as the two favourites did not face much opposition in their respective events. But his another favourite Anokato, in the 1,200m Orange William Cup, was a total failure. Vijays long-distance specialist Anzello, who sprinted the first time out, convincingly won the race and a heavy rain during the course of the running also helped his cause. 

 The Steinbeck-Falling Feather four-year-old, who was also a surprise winner of the 2,800m St Leger, early this year, made every post of the sprint race a winning one.

 Vijays was, in fact, a rich treble. He started off with the victory of his less-fancied Santarelle in the Bhishma Cup as Narredu failed to give a judicious ride to Bharaths even-money favourite, Bollywood Dreams ? going all over the course and losing by half-a-length. But Vijays Averroes did not have to bank on any luck in the Sweet Senorita Handicap over 1,100 metres. Alford had the three-year-old filly settled behind Daniels 9-10 favourite Mighty Force till top of the turn before shooting into the lead and sailing away from the field.

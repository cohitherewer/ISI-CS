 SLC appeals suspension

Colombo: Sri Lanka?s cricket governing body has lodged an appeal against its suspension by the government over alleged financial irregularities, cricket chief Thilanga Sumathipala said on Thursday. 

Sri Lanka Cricket petitioned the court of appeal late on Wednesday, seeking the lifting of its suspension slapped by sports minister Jeevan Kumaratunga a week ago, Sumathipala said. 

?We are seeking court intervention to ensure that the minister does not take any further action in relation to cricket without giving us a hearing,? Sumathipala, elected to his post last week, said. 

A date for the hearing is yet to be announced. 

Sumathipala said the minister?s action in suspending Sri Lanka Cricket meant they could not function as an officially recognised national body, but it had no implication for their membership of the International Cricket Council. 

SLC is incorporated as a private company but it is also registered with the sports ministry so that it can represent the country internationally. 

Sports minister Kumaratunga sacked Sri Lanka cricket?s governing body last week amid allegations of financial irregularities and appointed an interim committee. 

Kumaratunga?s action came just three days before Sumathipala 

was unanimously elected president. (AFP)

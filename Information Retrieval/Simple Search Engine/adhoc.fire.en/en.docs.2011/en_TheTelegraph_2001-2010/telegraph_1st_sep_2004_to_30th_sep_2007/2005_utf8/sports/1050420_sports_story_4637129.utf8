 Sania ruled out of Fed Cup

New Delhi: India?s Fed Cup hopes suffered a blow when their No. 1 player Sania Mirza was ruled out of tennis for about two more weeks. 

?The doctor has said the left ankle has shown progress but he would need another 10-12 days to decide whether she can play,? Sania?s father Imran Mirza said from Hyderabad. 

The 18-year-old tennis sensation, who was with her Indian teammates in Delhi, had flown to Hyderabad to consult her doctor back home. 

?She underwent various tests including an MRI and bone scan and was diagnosed to be having a soft tissue injury to the ankle,? Dr K.J. Reddy said in a statement. 

?Her progress would be reassessed after 12 days. In the meanwhile, she is advised against taking any stress.? 

Sania, who has risen to world No. 73, has not played competitive tennis for three weeks. 

Sania is expected to return to the capital to cheer her teammates who take on Singapore in the opening group I tie of the Asia-Oceania zone qualifiers on Wednesday.

 Mubarak in, Chamara out

New Delhi: Sri Lanka have recalled left-handed batsman Jehan Mubarak following an injury to uncapped teenager Chamara Kapugedara ahead of their Test series in India starting in Chennai on Friday. 

Chamara hurt his knee during fielding practice. The physio did not seem to think he will last the entire series, team manager Michael Tissera said from Chennai on Tuesday.

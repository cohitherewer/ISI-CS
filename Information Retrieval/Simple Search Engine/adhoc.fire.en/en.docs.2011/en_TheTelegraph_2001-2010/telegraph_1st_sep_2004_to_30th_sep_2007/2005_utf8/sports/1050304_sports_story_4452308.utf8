 Thumbs up for Narain 

 - I saw him while testing and he did a good job: Schumacher 

 Karthikeyan in Melbourne on Thursday 

Melbourne: Narain Karthikeyan Thursday got the best recommendation a Formula One driver could ask for: from Michael Schumacher. 

The seven-time world champion thinks the Indian, who makes his debut in this weekend?s Australian Grand Prix, can handle the rigours of Formula One. ?Obviously I?m sure he would have wished to have more time... but I saw him while testing and he did a good job,? Schumacher said. 

Mark Webber, who knows what it?s like to have the attention of a nation, said Karthikeyan would make the most of his opportunities. He is a ?good little driver?, said the Australian. 

The thumbs up from his new peers brought a smile to his face, but Karthikeyan is concerned about how his first drive in F1 will be rated back home. ?Obviously I?m excited, it?s my first Grand Prix, I?m the first Indian in Formula One, so there?ll be a lot of eyes watching,? Karthikeyan told a news conference today. 

The 28-year-old Jordan driver conceded he was relatively inexperienced by the standards of his Formula One rivals but bristled at claims he had only been given his spot for financial reasons. ?In India, they?re very happy for me and there?s a lot of talk back home but people keep saying I?m here for commercial reasons,? he said. 

?I would like to say that in British Formula Three I was a race winner and I?m not bad I think.? 

Karthikeyan?s road to Formula One has been long and difficult. He has spent most of the past eight years in British Formula Three and the Nissan World Series after two failed attempts to break into the big league. He tested with Jaguar and Jordan in 2001 but did not make the grade and came agonisingly close in 2003, when he was offered a drive by Minardi but could not generate the huge sums of money needed by the cash-strapped team to secure his place. 

The big break came last year when his sponsors, the Tata Group and Bharat Petroleum, agreed to back him. He signed a deal with Jordan, then underwent extensive testing in Europe to get the super licence. 

Despite Karthikeyan?s inexperience, Schumacher thinks he has what it takes to compete on the sport?s biggest stage. ?He had to watch his mirrors quite a bit and he did, so I think he?s capable of doing so. The race situation is slightly different but I believe he?s doing a good job,? he said. ?He?s done a lot of junior categories. He?s done many years in Europe so that?s healthy,? said Webber. ?Narain?s never been in a Formula One car but he knows where his mirrors are.? (AGENCIES)

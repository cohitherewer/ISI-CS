 Small fighters in larger frame 

 - Boxing Hall Of Fame

 Beating Sugar Ray Leonard (right, in file picture with Sylvester Stallone) was a big score 

Canastota (USA): The little guys have made it big in the international boxing Hall of Fame Class of 2005. 

Headlining this year?s group of 15 inductees were two-time featherweight champion Bobby Chacon; two-time junior welterweight champion Duilio Loi of Italy; Ireland?s popular featherweight champion Barry Mcguigan; and junior middleweight champion ?terrible? Terry Norris. 

Non-boxers to be enshrined Thursday included matchmaker Don Fraser and writer Bert Sugar, said boxing Hall of Fame executive director Edward Brophy. 

This year?s induction ceremony is June 12. 

The four boxers ? all of whom fought in classes below 154 pounds (69.853 kilograms) ? were chosen by a panel of boxing writers and historians as representatives of the modern era, which begins in 1943. Five other fighters were selected from the old-timer and pioneer categories, while six people were chosen in the non-participant and observer classes. 

Mcguigan, a small-town Irishman, became a national hero in the early 1980s by winning both the British and European featherweight titles. As a young professional he was known for his stamina, determination and durable chin. 

In June 1985, he dropped aging Panamanian legend Eusebio Pedroza in the seventh round and won a gruelling 15-round decision to claim the WBA featherweight title. 

He was successful in two title defences before he was dethroned in 1986 by Steve Cruz in a 15-round fight in 52-degree celsius heat in Las Vegas, a match that ended with Mcguigan being rushed to hospital with severe dehydration. 

It was two years before Mcguigan boxed again. After four unremarkable comeback victories, he quit boxing in 1989, finishing with a 32-3 career record, including 28 knockouts. 

Loi, too, was one of his country?s most popular fighters as he compiled a 115-8-3 record during a 15-year career that saw him reign twice as world junior welterweight champion between 1960-62. 

Regarded as a fine all-around boxer with a tremendous left hand, Loi also was European lightweight champion for four years. He won the world title with a hard-fought decision over Carlos Ortiz before 65,000 fans in Milan. 

Chacon held WBC crowns as a featherweight from 1974-1975 and as a super featherweight from 1982-1983. He attempted to win a third world title in 1984, but was stopped by WBA lightweight champion Ray ?boom boom? Mancini. 

With an explosive punching style, ?schoolboy? Chacon knocked out 23 of his first 25 pro opponents. He finished with 59-1-7 career marks, with 47 knock-outs. 

Texan Terry Norris was a star schoolboy baseball player who turned from the diamond to the ring and amassed an amazing 291-4 amateur record before turning pro in 1986. 

Norris won the WBC junior middleweight belt in 1989 with a sensational one-round knockout of John Mugabi then put together a string of 10 successful title defences, including a victory over Sugar Ray Leonard. 

He was upset by Simon Brown in his 11th title defence but won the crown back in a rematch.

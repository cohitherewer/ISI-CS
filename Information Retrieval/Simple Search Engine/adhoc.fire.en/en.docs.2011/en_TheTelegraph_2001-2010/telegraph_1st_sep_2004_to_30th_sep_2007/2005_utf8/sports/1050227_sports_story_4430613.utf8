 Khan stops Singh kins? clean sweep 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: What could have been a clean sweep of trophy events for Singh brothers ? Vijay and Bharath ? in Saturday?s eight-event card, was denied by trainer Javed Khan?s ward Say It Loud. The ageing gelding had an easy measure of Vijay?s fancied duo of Corvino and Annabee, in the afternoon?s main event, the 1,600m H.H.Maharaja Jagaddipendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur of Cooch Behar Memorial Cup. Mark Reuben partnered the seven-year-old.

 Bharath?s hot favourite, Alarico, earlier in the Supernova Cup, had justified his short odds with an effortless victory. Vijay?s Arakawa may not have matched Alarico?s verdict in the Police Commissioer?s Cup, but his winning effort was equally easy. His Maricopa, on the other hand, had to fight out a close battle with Exotic Strides in the Aada-Rossa Cup.

 Apprentice suspended: Stewards of RCTC slapped a seven-week suspension on apprentice Shane Domingo for his unsatisfactory riding of the Sanjeev Charan-trained Positive Thinker in the 1,100m Camlin Handicap. Domingo will remain supended between March 8 and April 13 ? the last day of the winter season.

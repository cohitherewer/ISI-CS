 Inzy, Kumble hold key: Kapil

London: Kapil Dev believes Anil Kumble and Inzamam-ul Haq would hold the key for their respective teams in the Test series beginning in Mohali on Tuesday. 

?I think if we look at bowling, a lot depends on Anil. If he gets going, he could change the match within two hours,? the former captain said. 

?From Pakistan?s point of view, their skipper Inzamam holds the key. He has a good record against India and in the conditions here, he could perform well.? 

Kapil, however, said India would be under pressure to win the series as expectations at home were high and suggested them go attacking in the first Test. 

?At the moment you have to see which team is better. See, we are playing at home and the pressure to win is on us. 

?I think the first Test is very important. Both teams are tense at the moment and to release pressure, both sides are saying the other is better. 

?On paper, the Indian side looks better, but on the field, one brilliant performance can change the match.? (PTI)

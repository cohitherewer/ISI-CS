The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dutta throws his hat into the ring 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: As the AIFF is exploring various options, Amal Dutta has thrown his hat into the race of replacing national coach Sukhwinder Singh. 

India were held 1-1 in Pakistan and humiliated 0-3 in Fiji, plunging Sukhwinders fate into uncertainty. 

What have I done wrong? Why am I not being considered for the post? asked Dutta after Mohun Bagan beat Mohammedan Sporting 2-0 at the CFL Premier Division on Sunday. 

According to him, age is not a factor to coach the national team. Most Latin American and European coaches are aged. If they can coach their sides, why not me? 

He particularly took the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi for tongue-lashing. Does Mr Dasmunshi come to the ground? Being the president does he watch matches? he enquired. 

Talking about the match, Dutta reserved another round of his tongue-lashing for the referee Dhanapati Roy. 

(This was) atrocious refereeing! Ive never seen such a poor supervision by a referee than this, Dutta remarked. Rodrigue (Gley Yao) was pushed and shoved several times by Madhab Das, but no card was shown to him, he pointed out. 

Dutta, however, was of the opinion that his team was much better than Mohammedan Sporting and so he didnt consider the match merited to be called a derby. In derby match you have to think, but against Mohammedan Sporting, no thinking is required. Even Ever-Ready are better that this team, he remarked. 

On the other hand, Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit Bhattacharya lamented about lack of resources in his team. Foreigners are making the difference? we need at least two foreigners to dominate in the local league, Bhattacharya felt. 

Bhattacharya, however, rated East Bengal slightly better side than Mohun Bagan. 

He also admitted that Vijayn is not fit to play for 90 minutes, but he had no other option.

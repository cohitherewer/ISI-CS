 Kaif to consult Gloster 

New Delhi: Middleorder batsman Mohammed Kaif, ruled out of competitive cricket because of an injury, said a decision on whether he can take part in the forthcoming one-day series against Sri Lanka will be taken only after the team physio made an assessment of the seriousness of his injury. 

Kaif said that he will be consulting team physio John Gloster about his injury which will keep him out of action for at least two weeks. 

I have a muscle strain and it takes at least two weeks time to recover from such an injury. I am going to Bangalore tomorrow and would meet John to consult on my injury, Kaif said on Monday. 

Kaif injured himself during the final of the Challenger Trophy against India B and was therefore not picked in the 15-member team for the first two matches for the series against Sri Lanka. Kaif was confident that India would do well against Sri Lanka.

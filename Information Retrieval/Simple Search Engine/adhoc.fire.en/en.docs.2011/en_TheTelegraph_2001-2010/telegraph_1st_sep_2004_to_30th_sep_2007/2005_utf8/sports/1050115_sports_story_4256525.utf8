 I was forced to step down, says Rajinder

 Rajinder says Gill was misinformed 

New Delhi: Former national hockey coach Rajinder Singh, who made way for India?s first foreign coach Gerhard Rach just before the Athens Olympic Games, Friday brought further trouble for the Indian Hockey Federation?s top brass when he revealed that he was ?forced to step down? from the post. 

?Such a situation was created that I was forced to step down,? Rajinder Singh, winner of the Dronacharya Award this year for his achievements last year, told a television channel. 

Rajinder, who won the country as many as four titles during his two-year stint, also claimed that IHF president K. P. S. Gill was given a wrong feedback about him and some wrong decisions were also taken. 

Rach had Thursday alleged in an interview that IHF secretary K. Jyotikumaran was instrumental in his decision to leave the job and move to Egypt. 

He had also claimed that IHF secretary had called the shots during the team selection for the Olympics and had told him that he would be shown the door as soon as possible.

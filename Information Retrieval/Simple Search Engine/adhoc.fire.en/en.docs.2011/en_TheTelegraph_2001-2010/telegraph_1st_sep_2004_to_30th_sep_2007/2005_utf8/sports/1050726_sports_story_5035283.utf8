 Beijing: World No. 1 Tiger Woods will head at least 20 of the world?s top 50 players in November?s champions tournament in Shanghai, set to be the richest golf event in Asia.

 Up to 100 players will compete for $5 million at the November 10-13 tournament, co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour, the PGA Tour of Australia and the South African Sunshine Tour, a Chinese daily said on Monday.

 ?This is the richest event in China and the richest event in Asia,? Tong Jinqiang, Shanghai manager for sponsor International Management Group, was quoted as saying.

 China is hosting a growing number of lucrative international tournaments, including this year?s Asian Open and other European tour events.

 New Delhi: Admitting that talks with the Asian Cricket Council had broken down, the Doha Asian Games Organising Committee (Dagoc) said on Monday that cricket would not be part of the Games next December.

 ?We were hoping to have 40 disciplines but the Olympic Council of Asia decided to drop cricket because of their tight schedule,? deputy director general (corporate support) of Dagoc, Ahmed al-Khulaifi, told reporters here. ?Also they (Asian Cricket Council) were ready only to send the U-19 teams.?

 Sydney: The body of cyclist Amy Gillett, killed last week when she was struck by a car while training in Germany, was brought back to Australia on Monday as the 18-year-old driver apologised for the accident. Amy?s husband Simon arrived with her body on Monday, though he told reporters at Sydney airport he had not received a personal apology from the driver, Stefanie Manger.

 Manger reportedly sent a letter to newspapers owned by News Ltd saying she was sorry for the accident that put five other members of the Australian women?s road cycling team in hospital. The funeral is on Friday.

 Zagreb: French Open champion Rafael Nadal pulled out of the Croatia Open on Monday less than 24 hours after winning his eighth claycourt title of the year.

 The Spaniard, who has become the youngest player in more than a decade to qualify for the season-ending Masters Cup, aggravated a knee injury during Sundays Mercedes Cup final victory.

 ?Rafael called from Stuttgart and said he was awfully sorry but that he couldn`t play because of a knee injury, quot; tournament director Slavko Rasberger said.

 Tashkent: Englishman Bobby Houghton has been named as coach of Uzbekistan?s national team, signing a contract on Monday until the end of the year.

 Houghton replaces Ravshan Khaidarov, who took over on a caretaker basis last month after German Heinz-Jurgen Geode was sacked following a string of poor results. 

 London: Kenya have been ordered by Fifa to play a World Cup qualifier against Tunisia in September behind closed doors after a fan was killed during crowd trouble at their match against Morocco last month.

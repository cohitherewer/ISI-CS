 Chappell made big difference, says Pathan 

Harare: Irfan Pathan on Tuesday credited coach Greg Chappell for the improvement in his bowling after picking up seven Zimbabawe wickets on the first day of the second Test here. 

He has made big difference to me and to all of us. The big improvement has been about the consistency in length. I am using the crease far better and also getting the bounce. There were better variations in my bowling today, Pathan, who so far has picked up 16 wickets from three innings against the hosts, said. 

He admitted that the wicket was helpful, but did not blame the Zimbabwe batsmen for the way they batted against him. 

I thought they played the right way and I still had to earn my wickets. I generally bowled good balls today, Pathan remarked. 

Pathan, who now has 61 Test wickets, said he still had a lot to learn and there was a great deal of improvement in store for him. 

It is still my early days in International cricket and two years is not quite enough time, he said. 

Zimbabwe coach Kevin Curran was disappointed with the way his batsmen played Pathan and also criticised Andy Blignaut for poor line and length during Indias innings. 

We played some bad shots and generally our batsmen did not seem aware on how to play swing bowling. Chris Coventry and Blignaut had a good stand going but then the latter was out to a poor shot. 

Gautam Gambhir, who ended the day just five short of his second Test century, complemented his opening partner Virender Sehwag in providing a strong foundation to the Indian innings. 

It is lovely to bat with Viru and it was great that we could get off to a good start in our innings, Gambhir said. 

He said he played normally and did not try to match Sehwags strokeplay. 

I did not try to copy him as he plays some exceptional shots. I just got set before playing my strokes, the Delhi opener said. 

 The opening stand put on 75 runs before Dravid and Gambhir added another 120 for the second wicket in their unbroken partnership. 

I was getting out in the 30s and 40s a lot of times so I decided to make full use of the opportunity today, Gambhir said. (PTI)

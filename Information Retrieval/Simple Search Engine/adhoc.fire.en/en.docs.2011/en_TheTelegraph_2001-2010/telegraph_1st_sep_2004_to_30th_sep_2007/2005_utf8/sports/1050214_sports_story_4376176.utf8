 Sania, Paes remain Indian spearheads 

 Sania Mirza 

Hyderabad: India?s first WTA title winner Sania Mirza will spearhead the country?s challenge in the zonal tie of Fed Cup women?s team tennis competition. 

The Asia-Oceania group 1 zonal tie, to be held in New Delhi from April 18-20, will also see the US-based Shikha Uberoi make her debut for India. Ankita Bhambri and Rushmi Chakravarthy are the other two members of the team that will be coached by Enrico Piperno while Sanaa Bhambri and Punam Reddy were named as reserves on Sunday. 

The selection committee of the All India Tennis Association, which met here under the chairmanship of Shyam Minotra, also announced the Davis Cup team to take on China in the Asia-Oceania group 1 first round tie in New Delhi from March 4 to 6. 

Leander Paes will as usual be the key singles player but his burden will be that much less than last year with Nandan Bal taking over as coach. 

Paes, who donned the mantle of both captain and coach last season, suffered one of the rarest singles defeat in the men?s team championship against Japan in the second round in an away tie. 

That win by Gouichi Motomura helped Japan score their first Cup win over India in 75 years.

The Indian team will still have a stiff task against 

the Chinese as they go into the tie without the services of Rohan Bopanna who 

is recuperating from a shoulder injury. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, Prakash Amritraj and Harsh Mankad are the other members of the team while 18-year-old Karan Rastogi is the reserve player. 

Paes is easing his way back to action after an ankle injury during a tournament in Sydney that kept him out of the Australian Open last month. With Amritraj too not in peak fitness, Mankad, the man in form, might have to carry the major burden. (PTI)

 Indian experts to review security

Islamabad: India has indicated that it would send experts to Pakistan to assess the security prior to its cricket teams scheduled tour of the country early next year, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official has said. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would send its experts in November to inspect the venues and review security arrangements for their tour in January next year, a Pakistan daily reported. 

The tour, involving three Tests and five one-day Internationals, is slated to begin on January 2, 2006. India will also take part in the Asia Cup during the tour in February. 

Meanwhile, another report says, the first Test of the upcoming series between Pakistan and England would be held in Multan, as scheduled earlier, after the PCB rejected a move by the England and Wales Cricket Board to shift the match to Rawalpindi.

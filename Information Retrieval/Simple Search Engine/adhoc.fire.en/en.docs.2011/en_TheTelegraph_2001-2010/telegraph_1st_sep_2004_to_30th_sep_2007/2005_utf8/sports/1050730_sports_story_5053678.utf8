 Yoga can help improve concentration

 The idea of a bouncer is to get a batsman fending in front of his throat

 Ravi Shastri 

 I am a righthanded batsman. I often get caught in the deep midwicket region when attempting the hook. Please help.

 (Puneet Agarwal, 19, Kalimpong)

 Use the depth of the crease when attempting the hook. Also roll your wrists at the time of contact so that you keep the ball to the ground.

 I am a righthanded batsman. Often I am out hit wicket when trying to defend a bouncer. Please help.

 (Rajat Kumar Barik, 17, Rajgongpur, Orissa)

 Keep your eyes on the ball at all times so that you dont lose balance.

 I am a righthanded batsman. Whenever I try to pull a shortpitched delivery, I get caught at square leg. Please help.

 (Ankit Khettry, 14, Calcutta-59)

 Roll your wrists at the time of contact so that the face of the bat is pointing downwards at the time of impact.

 I am a right-arm medium pacer. Where should a bouncer be pitched to make life difficult for the batsmen?

 (Himanshu Das, 18, Calcutta-14)

 The idea is to get a batsman fending from in front of his throat. So you got to pitch the ball in such a place so that you can get it in the desired area to make it awkward for the batsman.

 I am a righthanded batsman. When trying to hit overpitched deliveries, I often get caught at mid-off region. Why does this happen?

 (Tapas Roy, 19, Calcutta-19)

 You are lifting your head too early and not getting to the pitch of the ball. 

 What is the difference between an off cutter and an out swinger?

 (Soumik Chakraborty, 15, Calcutta-61)

 The off cutter comes back into the righthander after pitching, while the outswinger goes away from the righthander in the air and off the wicket.

 I am lefthanded batsman. I often fall leg before to inswinging deliveries. Why does this happen?

 (Sanjay Prahlad, 18, Calcutta-39)

 You are obviously falling over by getting your front foot too far across. Instead move towards the line of the ball with your feet.

 I am a righthanded batsman and take a leg stump guard. Is shuffling at the crease a bit necessary to tackle fast bowlers?

 (Rohit Das, 19, Calcutta-42)

 Moving back and across gives you that extra bit of time. But its not necessary to do it all the time.

 I often get bowled when attempting the sweep against a leg-spinner. Please help.

 (Ramen Purohit, 17, Calcutta-78)

 You might be getting too far across with your front leg and hence exposing your leg stump.

 Does yoga help to improve concentration while batting?

 (Rajat Bose, 22, Cuttack)

 No question about that. Yoga if practised properly with a good teacher can be a huge help.

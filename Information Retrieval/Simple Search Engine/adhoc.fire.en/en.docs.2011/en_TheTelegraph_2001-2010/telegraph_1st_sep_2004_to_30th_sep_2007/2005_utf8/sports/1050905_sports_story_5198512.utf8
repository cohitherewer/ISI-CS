 Yuvraj owes it to Chappell, Frazer

 Yuvraj Singh after his century in Harare on Sunday. (Reuters) Report, scorecard on Page 10 

Harare: Centurion Yuvraj Singh said that he was presently reaping the reward of hard work he has put in under the guidance of coach Greg Chappell and assistant Ian Frazer in the last few months. 

I was short of confidence when I went to Sri Lanka and Greg (Chappell) and Frazer worked very hard on me. My footwork improved greatly, said Yuvraj after his 120 bailed India out of a tricky situation against Zimbabwe in a tri-series game Sunday. 

I worked very hard on my first 50 runs but once I got set I chose my bowlers to attack. 

It never crossed my mind that we could lose the game. I knew that if I could bat till the end, we cannot lose the game. 

Yuvraj said there was little doubt the pressure was on India after the fall of early wickets even though Zimbabwe doesnt have a great reputed bowling attack. 

If you lose four early wickets, whatever is the attack, the pressure is on opposition. Our toporder is one of the best in the world and if they were out, they must have bowled good balls. 

Mohammed Kaif has made the most of opportunity after being promoted to No. 3 but Yuvraj it seems would have to live with the reality that he cant move any up in the order than No. 5. 

All players want to bat at the top but its not possible. Team requires me to bat at five or six and Sourav (Ganguly) says that my 40-50 is as good as a hundred anybody else get. 

The idea is to keep the team first and thats what I try to do. 

Yuvraj also made a mention about his two brilliant run-outs at point in two successive matches in the tri-series. 

It is not always possible to get runs so I try to make my presence count by saving runs and try and effect run-out. 

Of the two run-outs, the first on Friday was better since it gave me little chance to react. 

Yuvraj rated Indias chances good in the finals on Tuesday even though the team did not have a good record in summit clashes.

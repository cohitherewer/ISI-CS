 - National League

 Jeremiah opened NFL account 

Margao: East Bengal scored a hard fought 2-1 win over Sporting Clube de Goa in the 11th round of the National Football League played at the Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday. 

After a barren first half, East Bengal took the lead in 55th minute when Climax Lawerence guided the ball home from close after getting a perfect pass from Bhaichung Bhutia. 

Sporting then equalised through their star striker Dudu Omagbemi in the 61st minute through a penalty. The goal took Dudu?s individual tally to seven, the same as Bhutia and Climax. Dempo?s Ranty Martins is leading the chart with 8 goals. 

The penalty was awarded by referee Rizwan-ul Haq after Jeremiah brought down Adewusi Adebayo who was dangerously moving with the ball inside the box. 

Bhutia, who missed at least four chances, was again instrumental in the second goal when he provided the ball to Jeremah, who slotted it in. This was his first goal in the competition. 

East Bengal, who finished their first phase league engagement, are leading the chart with 24 points from 11 matches, four points ahead of second placed Dempo. 

Sporting Clube de Goa, who are sixth, have 13 points from seven matches. 

The match was fought closely with both the teams missing half a dozen chances in the first half itself. 

Habibur Rehaman Mondal, linking with Climax, gave much-needed impetus to Bhutia upfront as they threatened the rival defence time and again. They made the first move in the third minute when both Climax and Bhutia failed to connect in a well-directed cross by Mondal. 

Sporting keeper also came to the rescue of his team when he thwarted two goal-bound shots from Alvito D?Cunha and Bhutia. 

Sporting then made a counter move and nearly took the lead but Dudu?s shot hit the post. 

Dudu, who was closely monitored by the rival defenders, managed to get the better of his markers on at least four occasions but failed to find the target as his shots lacked power to beat keeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar under the bar. 

East Bengal?s coach Subhash Bhowmick was satisfied with his team?s win, but was disappointed with the way his team failed to convert at least seven chances. 

?I was excepting to collect 22 points at the end of the first phase. But now that we have collected 24 points, two points are bonus (for us),? Bhowmick added. 

Sporting?s coach Clifford Chukwuma was understandably disappointed after the team?s unbeaten run following the road accident in Calcutta was halted. 

?Our team gave a good fight to a better team. We had our chances but our boys failed to convert them which was our downfall,? Chukwuma said. (PTI)

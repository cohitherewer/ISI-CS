 Anand 3rd after win over Polgar

 - WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 

 Veselin Topalov ponders his next move against Peter Leko in San Luis on Thursday 

San Luis: Viswanathan Anand bounced back from the Alexander Morozevich shock to outwit Judit Polgar of Hungary in the eighth round of the World Chess Championship. 

The Indian Grandmaster took his tally to 4.5 points and moved up to sole third with six rounds remaining in the $1 million meet. 

Bulgarian Veselin Topalov maintained his two-point lead over nearest rival Peter Svidler of Russia after being involved in an easy draw with fourth-placed Peter Leko of Hungary. 

Topalov has seven points in his kitty and Svidler (5) is a distant second. Next is Anand, followed by Leko (4). Defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov (3) has virtually no chance of retaining the crown. 

In seventh place is Briton Michael Adams, while Polgar (2) brings up the rear. The eight-player field is involved in a double round-robin contest. 

Thursday produced just two decisive games as Anand stole the limelight with a thumping victory over Polgar who stood no chances against the wily Indian in a Siclian Defence game. 

Playing white, Anand was up against the Taimanov Variation and went for a set-up akin to the English attack wherein Polgar faltered early in the opening and was down a pawn in the early middlegame itself. 

Anand handled the remaining technicalities in exemplary fashion, sweeping blacks queenside pawns one after the other and romped home after 62 moves. This was Anands second victory over Polgar in the championship. 

Morozevich defeated Kasimdzhanov in 53 moves. 

Meanwhile, Anand has been invited by the World Economic Forum to join their Worldwide Forum of Young Global Leaders. 

The Indian Grandmaster was chosen by a nomination committee.

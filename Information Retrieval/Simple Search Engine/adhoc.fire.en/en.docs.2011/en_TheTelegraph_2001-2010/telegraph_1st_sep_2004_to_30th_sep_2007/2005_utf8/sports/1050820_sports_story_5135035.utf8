Sydney: The ICC World Test and ODI squads for Octobers Super Series face-off versus Australia will be announced in Melbourne next week, Cricket Australia said Friday. 

[However, according to chief selector Sunil Gavaskar, the squads were to be picked in Durban on Friday.] 

Richard Hadlee, one of the selectors, and the coach will announce the star-studded squads and the captain. 

Joining them to provide an Australian reaction to the teams selected will be Australian one-day player, Brad Hogg. The World teams ODI uniform will also be unveiled and modelled for the first time, the CA said in a release.

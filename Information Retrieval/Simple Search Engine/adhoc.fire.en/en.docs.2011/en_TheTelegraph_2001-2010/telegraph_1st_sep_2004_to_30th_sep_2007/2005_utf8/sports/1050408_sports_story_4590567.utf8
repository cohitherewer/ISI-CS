 Bombay XI shock Punjab Police

Calcutta: Punjab Police started their Beighton Cup quarter final league on a losing note. Bombay XI surprised them 1-0 when Jayesh Yadav scored the winner in the 36th minute. 

Punjab Police dominated the proceedings and earned as many as 12 penalty corners. Their failures in converting any of them was the key to their defeat. 

In another match, Ignace Tirkey hit the sound board in the 57th minute for Army XI as they got past Tamil Nadu XI 1-0.

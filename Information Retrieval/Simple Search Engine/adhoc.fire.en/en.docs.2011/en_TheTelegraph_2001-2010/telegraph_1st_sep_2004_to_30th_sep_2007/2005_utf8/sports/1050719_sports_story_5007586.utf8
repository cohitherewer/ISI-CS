 NZ govt not to stop team: PM

Wellington: New Zealand will not stop its national cricket team from touring Zimbabwe despite an opinion poll suggesting its citizens would support a ban, Prime Minster Helen Clark said on Monday. 

New Zealand is leading an international push to have Zimbabwe banned from the tour schedule over concerns of human rights abuses under President Robert Mugabe. 

A Fairfax/AC Neilsen survey, published in a Wellington newspaper, found that 53 percent of respondents wanted the government to introduce legislation banning sports teams from touring countries that violate human rights. 

The proposition put to the Government was that there should be legislation under urgency to prevent national sports teams travelling to another country, Clark said. That is territory no New Zealand government has ever entered into and we dont propose to. (But) we will continue to advocate that the team not go. 

Miss Clark said it was clear New Zealanders did not want the tour to go ahead. Obviously it is of concern that our cricketers might get caught up in circumstances which compromise them. 

New Zealand had asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change its policy requiring teams to tour Zimbabwe. 

Foreign Minister Phil Goff said last Friday the government would not step in and legislate, citing the right of individuals and organisations from New Zealand to travel freely. 

The games ruling body said last week the tour should go ahead unless the New Zealand government ruled it illegal. 

New Zealand has already said it will not provide visas for a reciprocal tour it is due to host late this year.

 United to bank on Cristiano vs Spurs

 - Hes had a difficult time... But hell be okay: Ferguson 

 Ronaldos agent says the rape allegation is a product of fantasy 

Manchester: Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo, who is on bail from police investigating an allegation of rape, is set to play against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday. 

Hes had a difficult time, obviously, but he trained yesterday and will train today so he will be okay, manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday. 

Police are investing claims that a woman was sexually assaulted in a London hotel on October 2. 

Ronaldos agent Jorge Mendes has said the allegation involving the United player, who was released by police pending further enquiries on Wednesday, was the product of imagination and fantasy. 

The 20-year old Portuguese could have a key role on Saturday for United, who have been badly hit by injuries and face a Tottenham side who are a point above them in second place in the Premier League. 

Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Gary Neville, Quinton Fortune, Gabriel Heinze, Wes Brown, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Louis Saha are all unavailable, while doubts surround the fitness of Kieran Richardson. 

Giggs became the latest to join the casualty list when he was injured during Uniteds Champions League draw with Lille on Tuesday. The Wales captain was due to undergo surgery for a facial injury on Friday morning. 

He has got three fractures in his cheekbone and it will be plated, said Ferguson, whose team cannot afford to dwell on their injury problems as they look to keep leaders Chelsea in sight. 

Its just unfortunate that these things can happen, yet theres no way you can sit down and contemplate picking a team without thinking about winning. 

And that has always been the case at this club. Tomorrow we have some changes but equally we have the same desire and winning mentality we always have. 

Thats the way Manchester United have to be. We are judged not on what the team is, we are judged on the result and the performance on the field. 

Hopefully tomorrow the young players will rise to that, and the experienced ones who will be playing will help them. 

Tottenham have enjoyed an impressive start to the season under Martin Jol, and Ferguson expects them to adopt a positive approach at Old Trafford. 

Its a club that has a great history and tradition of playing good football and the games weve had against them over the years have been fantastic, he said. 

They are games that have always epitomised the philosophy of both clubs. They have been attacking games and I think youll get that tomorrow.

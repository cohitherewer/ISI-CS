 Greg will make a difference, feels Imran

 Chappell 

Islamabad: Describing Greg Chappell as a good captain and a great cricketer, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has backed his selection as Indias new coach. 

I am not a great believer in coaches but if a person of great calibre like Chappell is selected, it makes a difference, Imran told visiting Indian journalists on the sidelines of a dinner hosted by Indian high commissioner Shivshankar Menon in honour of leader of opposition L. K. Advani here Wednesday night. 

He is a good captain and a great cricketer. As far as other coaches are concerned, its okay to have your own coaches, he said. 

Asked whether former Pakistan captain and left-arm seamer Wasim Akram would be an ideal choice if India go for a bowling coach, Imran said, it is for 

 Imran

Wasim to decide but what I am trying to say is that there is too much emphasis on coaches.

On Sachin Tendulkar, who will be out of action for almost four months after undergoing a surgery in London recently, he said I think he has quite a lot of cricket left in him. Imran also came down heavily on the Pakistan selectors for ignoring Shoaib Akhtar for the Windies tour. 

I always thought it was a blunder. The Pakistani team had overestimated itself. One should never underestimate ones rivals. You discipline a player on the tour and not by keeping him out of a tour. (PTI)

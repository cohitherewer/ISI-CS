Calcutta: Unless theres a dramatic change in the Team India thinktanks approach, The Telegraph learns that the XI which did duty in the Bulawayo Test is going to be retained for the second (and final) face-off in Harare, from Tuesday. 

Ajit Agarkar is expected to be the 12th man. 

Agencies add from Harare: There is something about Harare which spells disaster for the Indian team and on the eve of the second cricket Test against Zimbabwe, the signs once again appear ominous. 

Twice in 1998 and 2001, India have lost to the hosts at this venue but while there appears no such threat now, the Indians are being torn asunder by their own machinations within the team. 

Except for Kaif, there is little to guess about the batting composition for the Test but in the bowling department, there could be more than just a Zaheer who could be an issue. 

India would also have to choose between Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble for two spinners at this spongy, bouncy venue is a luxury even though the blooming summer can turn it into a dusty track down the line. 

Much of the damage is being done up front by Irfan Pathan whose incoming swinging deliveries have won him 50 percent of his 54 scalps as leg-before victims. 

Virender Sehwag too would be looking to raise a three-figure score or more against his name for too often he is losing his concentration in the 40s and 50s. 

Zimbabwe showed some encouraging signs in Bulawayo, especially in the first innings, but batting remains their embarrassment these days. We held on for three-and-a-half days, which was a big improvement, their coach Kevin Curran said. 

 India are a world-class side and we know what they can do. You just have to look at their averages. 

But we have shown steady improvement and we competed pretty well in Bulawayo. If we hadnt lost all those wickets in the 18 overs we batted on the third day, I think we would have taken the game all the way into the last day, Curran said.

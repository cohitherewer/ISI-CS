The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rs 10 lakh donation from Steve Waugh

 - Former Australian captain?s bats to be auctioned at fund-raiser for the tsunami affected 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: It needed just one call to get Steve Waugh?s consent. Yes, he would surely chip in with Together, We Will (TWW), a newly-formed NGO, to help tsunami-sufferers back on their feet in Andaman and Nicobar islands. 

Having championed the cause of leprosy-suffering children in this state, Waugh is already involved with a project for under-privileged children. And now, he has responded to (Calcutta Foundation chairperson) Shamlu Dudeja?s request to get involved with tsunami relief being organised by TWW. 

The former Australian captain, who will be landing in Calcutta on Wednesday night for a two-day business trip, has donated Rs 10 lakh as the seed money for the Rs 5 crore budgeted for rehabilitation work in Hut Bay, Little Andaman. This was announced at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. 

Waugh will also be putting up two or three of his bats for Thursday?s auction which will be part of the first of three fund-raising functions. An art exhibition will be held on Friday while on Saturday a big concert (One World) has been planned. 

The first two functions will be hosted by The Oberoi Grand, while the concert will be held at the La Martiniere for Boys school ground. 

The immediate plans of TWW ? which brings together organisations like Rotary Calcutta Mahanagar, Calcutta Foundation, Art of Living, Church of North India, Silver Springs Group, B.P. Poddar Foundation, Rotary Foundation and Trisys ? are donating 1,000 bicycles, constructing houses in the Hut Bay area of Little Andaman, donating fishing nets and boats and setting up schools. 

?It requires big finances, but let me tell you each passing day is bringing more and more people together in our effort to bring the smiles back on the people who have suffered ,? said Rotarian Shekhar Mehta, one of the leading lights of TWW. 

?We want to build a new Car Nicobar? we can, with some assistance from you all,? was Robert Henry?s touching appeal. Like thousands, the Car Nicobar-resident was rendered homeless by the December 26 tsunami.

 Hayden cleared for NZ tour

 Hayden 

Sydney: Australian opener Matthew Hayden on Tuesday said he had been cleared to tour New Zealand after a medical examination found he was over the worst of a debilitating lung infection. 

Hayden, who has been battling both illness and poor form, said doctors had found he was suffering from pleurisy and waited until the last minute before deciding he could join his teammates on the plane to Auckland early on Wednesday. 

The prolific Aussie left-hander said he had endured a tough week, much of it bedridden, wondering if he would recover in time to make the tour. ?I felt very sick,? he said after successfully completing a nets session. ?My lung capacity was way below 50 percent, there was genuine reason to be really concerned. 

?I felt not dissimilar to having pre-flu symptoms but as the week went on the pleurisy symptoms really started to hurt to the point where you just couldn?t breathe in air. But I am on the road to recovery ... I definitely feel all right to go.?

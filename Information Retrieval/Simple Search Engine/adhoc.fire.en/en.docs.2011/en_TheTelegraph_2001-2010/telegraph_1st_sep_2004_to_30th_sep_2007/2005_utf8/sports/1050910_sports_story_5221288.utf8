 Atwal tied 55th

Vancouver: Arjun Atwal opened with an up-and-down round with five birdies and seven bogeys to finish two-over 72 in the Canadian Open at the Shaughnessy Golf Course. 

Atwal was tied for 55th, while defending champion Vijai Singh was further behind on 71st place. 

Atwal had a roller coaster round after he started on the tenth. He opened with a birdie, but had bogeys on the 16th and 18th. On the back nine, he birdied four and bogeyed five. 

Meanwhile, Singh made three bogeys in a round of 73. He again struggled with his putter, missing several birdie putts from inside 15 feet. 

Lucas Glover and Mark Calcavecchia took advantage of excellent conditions in the afternoon to bring in cards of five-under 65 each. 

Jasper Parnevik, who played in the morning, shot a 66. 

Four players were two behind the leaders. Among them were Todd Hamilton, the 2004 British Open champion, Scott Dunlap, a Monday qualifier, Brandt Jobe and Ted Purdy.

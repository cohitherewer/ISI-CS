 History cuts troubled Myskina both ways 

 - Russians focus looks lost in family problems and injuries

Paris: She got past the rope nearly a year ago, joining the club of Grand Slam singles champions, a club including Steffi Graf and Jennifer Capriati, and in so doing, became the first Russian female to break through at a major. But history can cut both ways. 

On Monday, Anastasia Myskina entered the record book alongside Graf and Capriati with her first-round loss at the French Open. It was only the third time in the Open era that a defending champion lost in the first round at a Grand Slam and it had never happened at the French Open, according to womens tour officials. 

Maria Sanchez Lorenzo of Spain defeated the fifth-seeded Myskina, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0, at Roland Garros. In 1994, Graf lost to Lori McNeil at Wimbledon in the first round, and Capriati went out against Marlene Weingartner at the 2003 Australian Open in the opening round. 

Unlike those cases, however, 23-year-old Myskinas troubles were telegraphed weeks ago. She went from a player ranked in the top three in January to a player with one victory on clay leading into the French Open. There was some thought that she would not even play here. 

Myskina has been dealing with family problems and physical difficulties, though she downplayed a sore shoulder after the loss. Her mother, Galina, has been receiving treatment for a life-threatening illness, which Myskina apparently learned of after returning home from the Australian Open. 

The once clever counter-puncher with a terrific court sense looked lost on the same court where she beat fellow Russian Elena Dementieva in last years final. Myskina had 69 unforced errors. 

Said Dementievas coach, Olga Morozova, on the changes in Myskina, She was quite strong when she played. She knew when to break the player... which was her strength. We all knew what she is going through. Theyre quite close, mother and daughter. 

(Last year) was a nice year for the Russians. We knew it would be difficult to repeat. 

Myskina, teary-eyed in the interview room, managed a few self-deprecating remarks about her recent lack of confidence. 

 Well, I think right now I can lose to anybody because in the past couple of weeks, I cant even pass the first (round), she said. 

So no matter who is playing against me, the girl is just winning? When the balls come to me, I dont really know what I have to do. 

It was a difficult day for another favoured woman on Court Philippe Chatrier as well. 

Unlike Myskina, however, top-seeded Lindsay Davenport survived a shaky start against Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia. Davenports game kicked in at 2-2 in the second set and she won nine straight games en route to a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 first-round victory. 

Davenports French Open preparation was unconventional. She played in no European clay-court events, took a quick trip to Mexico with her husband and stayed home to train. 

She didnt second-guess her strategy after losing the first set. 

No, absolutely not, Davenport said. I sat down at the beginning of the year and thought, OK, how am I going to play best this year at certain weeks? ? While I win, Im going to do my best. But try to think a little bit more long-term, knowing that this was a very difficult Slam for me to compete in anyway. 

Maria Sharapova of Russia came close to taking the No. 1 ranking from Davenport in recent weeks. But Davenport said she was totally detached from the rankings. 

Ive got a ridiculous summer coming off, Davenport said of tournaments she has to defend from 2004. Whether it happens in June or July, its going to happen.

 Adams turn to hold Anand

 - SOFIA MASTERS - Kramnik beats Polgar, moves into joint lead 

 Ponomariov crushed Topalov 

Sofia: Viswanathan Anands hunt for the elusive victory continued as he was held to his fifth straight draw by Michael Adams of England in the fifth round of the MTel Masters chess meet here. 

At the half-way stage in this category-20 double round robin tournament, a resurgent Vladimir Kramnik of Russia joined Adams atop the table on three points, after defeating worlds top woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary. 

The biggest surprise of the event, however, came from the other board where former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine silenced his critics with a crushing victory over local favourite and world No.3 Veselin Topalov. 

With just five more rounds to be played, Anand and Ponomariov are close behind the leaders with 2.5 points, while Topalov and Polgar slipped to the bottom of the table with two points. 

Anand continued his discussion with Adams in the semi-closed opening set-ups and employed the English opening this time with his white pieces. 

The Briton went for the Hedgehog formation and thanks to some fine piece-play, Anand emerged with a slight advantage in the middle game. 

Almost immediately, the Indian ace went for a series of exchanges in a long tactical variation that led to a minor piece endgame, wherein Anand retained his minuscule advantage, but it didnt materialise into a winning position. 

After a few pawn swaps, the players signed peace in 54 moves. 

I felt I was better but his defence was quite good, winning chances were minuscule unless black makes a mistake, Anand said adding, the line which we played together is not that common but is quite subtle and interesting. But in the best circumstances you get a very small advantage. 

For Ponomariov, the luck-factor finally clicked. Having lost the first game against Kramnik, the Ukrainian was not quite his usual self so far but Monday proved another day as he squeezed out the defensive resources of Topalov in a spectacular effort. 

Playing white side of a Queens Gambit, Ponomariov got a slight initiative in the middle game and nurtured it well to get the dynamic balance rolling in his favour. 

Topalov found himself struggling and just could not compete when Ponomariov first won an exchange and then sacrificed a piece to tie down all black forces on the king side. 

It was a picturesque sight when Ponomariov simply marched his king to the heart of blacks position to deliver the knock out punch. The game lasted 40 moves. 

Kramnik was also in his element against Polgar, although in this one fortunes fluctuated a bit before destiny had the final say. 

Playing the Capablanca variation against Polgars Nimzo Indian Defence, Kramnik could only manage a wild unclear middle game with Polgar launching a king side attack. 

The Russian, however, worked on his counter play bid quite accurately and knocked down a black pawn. It was time for a retreat that resulted in trading of queens and soon after the fate of the game was decided in the ensuing rook and minor piece endgame. Polgar called it a day on her 62nd turn.

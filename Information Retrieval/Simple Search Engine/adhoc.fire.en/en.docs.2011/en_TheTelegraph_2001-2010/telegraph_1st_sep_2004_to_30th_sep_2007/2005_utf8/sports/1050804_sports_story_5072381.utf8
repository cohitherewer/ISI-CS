 Zidane to play for France again

Paris: Three-time World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane has decided to play for France again, the midfielder announced on Wednesday. 

The Real Madrid player had announced his retirement from international football after Euro 2004 a year ago. 

(France coach) Raymond Domenech came to see me two or three times in Madrid and he told me what he expected from me, Zidane said on his personal website. 

The 33-year-old said fellow midfielder Claude Makelele had also decided to play for France again. 

Makelele had announced his international retirement in September last year, saying he wanted to concentrate on his club career with Chelsea. 

Zidanes decision came as a surprise after he had said several times over the past few months that he would not change his mind. 

Pressure on the inspirational midfielder to return had increased with France facing a struggle to qualify for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany and badly missing his unique skills. 

Zidane will play for France in their next match, a friendly against Ivory Coast on August 17 in Montpellier. Makelele will also be a candidate for a place in the starting line-up. 

Regarded by many as the worlds finest player, Zidane has won 93 caps, scoring 26 goals for France. He helped his country win the World Cup in 1998 and the European championship in 2000. 

Domenech, preparing his team for World Cup qualifiers next month, welcomed the decision of Zidane-Makelele to return.

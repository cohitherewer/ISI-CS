 Barbadians planning candlelight farewell

 - Kensington Oval to be demolished in June

Bridgetown: A candlelight ceremony featuring Barbados cricketers, who played for the West Indies, will celebrate Kensington Oval before its demolition in June. 

After the Test against Pakistan, a new ground with a seating capacity of 28,000 seats ? 13,000 more than at the Oval ? should be finished by December 2006, in time for the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. Indian firm Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd won a contract to oversee the $45 million project. 

Barbados will host several World Cup matches, including the final. 

Kensington Oval has staged international matches for 110 years, including the West Indies? maiden Test in 1930. It has been home to the Pickwick Cricket Club since 1882. 

From 1930 to 1993, the West Indies lost just one match at the ground. Since 1994, however, they have lost seven of 13 Tests there, including Sunday?s innings defeat to South Africa. 

The National Cultural Foundation and local World Cup organisers were organising the farewell event, and hopeful of attracting the likes of West Indies great Sir Garfield Sobers. 

?We are planning an activity fitting for the great ground Kensington has been,? said Francine Alexander-Charles, spokeswoman for the Barbados World Cup committee.

 Wie gives fitting reply to doubters

PETER DIXON

Havre de Grace: There had been predictable mumblings of discontent that Michelle Wie had received an invitation to play in the McDonald?s LPGA Championship at Bulle Rock here last week, but in the end the Hawaiian teenager silenced them all with a display bettered only by the incomparable Annika Sorenstam. 

For while the Swede was cruising on Sunday to the halfway point in her pursuit of the Grand Slam of women?s major championships, the 15-year-old amateur was drawing almost as many plaudits as the world No.1 for the way in which she pulled away from the rest of the field to finish runner-up. 

Wie had rounds of 69, 71, 71 and 69 for a total of 280, eight under par. Had she been a professional, she would have scooped $164,385 (about ?90,000). 

Three shots behind Sorenstam at the end of play, Wie finished two ahead of Laura Davies of Great Britain, and Paula Creamer of the United States, and was the only player to have all four rounds under par. 

It was an outstanding performance made better by the knowledge that there are those who would see her fail. The tournament?s rules had been changed this year to allow an amateur in for the first time and, inevitably, many felt it had been done solely with Wie in mind. 

?McDonald?s said, ?This is what we want and if you don?t do it, we?re pulling out?,? Juli Inkster, twice a winner, said. ?Last year we said ?No? and this year they strong-armed it a little more. You can?t be changing rules for one person.? 

That said, the 6ft tall Wie took it all with a shrug of her slim shoulders, pointing out that she had not ?lobbied? for an invitation. ?There?s definitely going to be some people who are against me and I really don?t care about it,? she said. 

Coached by David Leadbetter, Wie knows full well that she is a top draw for any tournament ? after all, not many professionals that can hit the ball in excess of 300 yards, let alone a schoolgirl ? and she is not about to apologise for it. 

It was once said that if Sorenstam could learn to putt, then she would be unbeatable. Well, not only has her putting improved beyond recognition, but so has her touch around the greens. And, as a result, nobody can live with her right now. She has won six of eight events on the US tour this year and 19 of her last 38. 

With the short game dependent on touch, imagination and experience, much the same could be said of Wie as was said of Sorenstam in her early days. 

Wie suffered for her putting last week but is coming on in leaps and bounds in the short-game department. 

Yet after finishing fourth at the 2004 Kraft-Nabisco Championship, tied for thirteenth at the US Women?s Open last year and now second here, it would take a brave soul to suggest she should play elsewhere. 

Laura Davies, for one, is fully supportive. ?Anyone who doesn?t think she should get an invite (to the LPGA) is crackers,? she said on the eve of the event. ?She?s great for the tour and anyone who doesn?t like it is very short-sighted.?

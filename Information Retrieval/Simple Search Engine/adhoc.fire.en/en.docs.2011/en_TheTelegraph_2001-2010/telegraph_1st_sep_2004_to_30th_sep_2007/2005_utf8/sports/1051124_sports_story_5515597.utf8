The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India slip to 135

New Delhi: As footballers start their preparations for the South Asian Football Championship to be played in Karachi next month, India find itself losing three spots in the latest Fifa rankings. 

India fell to 135th position from the 132nd with teams like Swaziland, Faroe Islands and Liberia gaining at its expense. 

But the fact that India is still the highest ranked team in South Asia could give some comfort to them. 

Brazil still tops the list with the Czech Republic leapfrogging The Netherlands into second place. (PTI)

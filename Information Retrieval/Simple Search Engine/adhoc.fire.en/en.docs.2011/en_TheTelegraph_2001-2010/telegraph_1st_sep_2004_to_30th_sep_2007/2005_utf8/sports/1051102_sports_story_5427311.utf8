 Sao Paulo: It is not often that a soccer team gets driven to a match in armoured cars with an escort of soldiers. Or that the supporters of their opponents surround them in a delirious outpouring of joy and affection. Those were the scenes in Haiti?s decrepit capital Port-au-Prince on August18 last year when Brazil?s soccer team, complete with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, showed up to play a special ?peace game? against the Haitian national side.

 That extraordinary day, when for a brief time Haitians were united, has been captured on a documentary called ?O Dia em que o Brasil Esteve Aqui? (?The Day Brazil Was Here?) by two Brazilian film-makers and is showing at the Sao Paulo International Film Festival. The idea for the film came when Joao Dornelas read in an article that the world champions were going to Haiti, where the Brazilian army was leading a United Nations peacekeeping force in the violent aftermath of the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004.

 Paris: The Court of Arbitration for Sport 

 (CAS) rejected an appeal by Olympique Marseille, ruling 

 their former midfielder Mathieu Flamini was eligible to 

 play for Arsenal. Flamini, a product of Marseille?s youth 

 team, refused to sign his first professional contract with 

 his club, joining Arsenal in July 2004. The French Federation 

 refused to issue Flamini?s international certificate and 

 the case was submitted to Fifa which authorised the player?s 

 transfer to the English club.

 Berlin: Robert Hoyzer, the referee at the centre of a match-fixing trial in Germany, told a court on Tuesday that his five co-defendants had played their part in the two million euro ($2.4 million) fraud. The 26-year-old recounted the rigging of games from May 2004 for alleged ringleader and obsessive gambler Ante Sapina, his contact with Sapina?s two brothers Filip and Milan and his efforts to bring on board fellow referee Dominik Marks. Hoyzer, dressed in a suit and tie, told the court Milan and Filip watched games, celebrated results and helped him pick a television, implying they were aware of the fraud.

 Berlin: A Berlin court was due to take up the case of former East German swimmer Karen Koenig, who is seeking compensation for damages she says she suffered as a result of the communist state?s systematic doping policy. She is asking for just over 10,000 euros ($12,040) from the German Olympic Committee (NOK) but over 100 other ex-athletes are ready to press ahead with similar claims if she wins. That could create a financial crisis for the NOK.

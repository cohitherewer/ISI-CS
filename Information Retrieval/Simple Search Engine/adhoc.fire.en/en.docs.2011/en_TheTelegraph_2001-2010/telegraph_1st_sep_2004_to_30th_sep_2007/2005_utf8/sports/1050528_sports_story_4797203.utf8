Half a million Liverpool football fans took to the citys streets on Thursday night to welcome home the new European champions. Many ignored police advice and climbed lampposts, fountains and even speed cameras in a scramble for vantage points along the six-mile route. 

Such were the numbers spilling on to the roads that Liverpool FCs open-top bus, with their sporting heroes and European Cup on display, was half an hour late setting off. 

As it did, Vladimir Smicer and Milan Baros beamed with delight as they held the cup aloft at the front of the red bus bearing the words Its Ours to Keep, a reference to the clubs right to retain the trophy. Steven Gerrard, the team captain and local hero, stood before them leaning modestly against the front rail of the bus, occasionally giving fans the thumbs-up. 

There were reports that as many as 500,000 would be joining in the celebrations, many coming from other parts of the country, in a city with an official population of 441,477. 

After wending their way into the city, the team attended a civic reception at the St Georges Hall, which had become a focal point for supporters throughout the day. 

The victory party, which began after the teams amazing second-half comeback from being three goals down against AC Milan and after their penalty shoot-out triumph, showed no signs of abating on Thursday. An estimated one in five workers in the city took the day off to celebrate. Fifteen million watched the final on television in Britain, according to viewing figures. 

The team was greeted at John Lennon International Airport by Alan Dean, who was installed as Lord Mayor of Liverpool 15 minutes after the final kicked off. A supporter of Merseyside rivals Everton, he said: It was a little bit bizarre, but an extreme pleasure. Im delighted that the other club has had such a massive success. 

The Queen was on a trip to Canada while the game was in progress, but was informed of the result on her return to Britain on Thursday morning. She sent a message to the club saying: Congratulations on your remarkable win. It was a magnificent achievement which will be remembered for many years both in Liverpool and across the country. 

Pubs around Anfield were doing a roaring trade throughout the day and the crowds continued to build during the afternoon in anticipation of the parade. 

Queues formed outside the club shop with people anxious to buy memorabilia. In the city centre hastily-produced T-shirts bearing the result were on sale for ?10 each, while inflatable replicas of the trophy were on offer at ?2. 

Steven Tween, 38, a lorry driver, who was taking his second day off work, said: Houdini couldnt have done this. I have never cried over football before, but on Wednesday night the tears just poured out of me. 

For one of Gerrards old teachers it was a case of history repeating itself as he watched him inspire the sides comeback. Steven Monaghan coached him as an 11-year-old in the Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School team that came back from three down to win a cup final. 

He said: It was so weird, they were 0-3 down at half-time, just like we were all those years ago and Steven psyched up the team just like he did on Wednesday. We went on to win 4-3.

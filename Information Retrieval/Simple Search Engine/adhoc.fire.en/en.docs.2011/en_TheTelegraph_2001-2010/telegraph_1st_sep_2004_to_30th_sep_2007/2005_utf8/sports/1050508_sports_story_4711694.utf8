The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Relaid track hard and abrasive

Over-drive

 Its Race V of the Formula 

 1 season and we are at Catalunya for one of the most demanding 

 events of the calendar. The configuration of the circuit 

 does suit our cars but we are working hard to make the best 

 use of it.

 The surface has been relaid but 

 is still an abrasive and hard track. Because of this, we 

 have had to change the composition of our Bridgestone tyres, 

 which has really helped us a lot.

 I have raced before at Catalunya 

 during my seasons in the World Series, so I know the track 

 pretty well. But racing on any track in a Formula 1 car 

 is an altogether different story! But I have taken my learning 

 forward and am trying to maximise that knowledge.

 The practice sessions on Friday 

 and Saturday produced mixed results. On Friday, we had a 

 tough first session. So, I sat down with the technicians 

 to iron out the problem areas and also put my experience 

 into play.

 The weather on Saturday was good, 

 there was a lot of sunshine. We got out and put out good 

 laps and are generally feeling much stronger. Despite all 

 this, I doubt whether we will do as well as we did at Imola. 

 We are getting better but this is a tough one and has historically 

 been a race where Jordan has been off the pace. 

 The support I have been getting 

 has been amazing and I hope I will continue to get it throughout 

 the gruelling season. There has been a buzz at the circuit 

 and that always keeps the excitement going. A couple of 

 friends have come over, it is always nice to relax with 

 them after a tough outing.

 In the period between now and 

 the last race, we had a practice day at Silverstone where 

 we worked on a few things. Formula 1 is all about constant 

 learning and I have been doing that continuously. Hope you 

 enjoy the race at Circuit de Catalunya. TCM

 Jones ruled out of final Test

 Jones says he needed a little more time 

London: England suffered a major blow ahead of the fifth and final Ashes Test against Australia when fast bowler Simon Jones was ruled out by injury on Tuesday. 

Jones hurt his right ankle on the third day of the fourth test at Trent Bridge and failed to recover for The Oval finale, despite undergoing intensive treatment, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said. 

England lead the series 2-1 but Australia will retain the Ashes which they have held since 1989 if they can win at The Oval. The Test starts on Thursday. 

Jones had a fitness test at Lords this morning but was still experiencing pain from the ankle injury, said an ECB spokesman. The test consisted of Jones running around the outfield but he pulled up sore. He has been released from the squad and sent home. 

Jones, who has taken 18 wickets at 21 runs apiece in the Ashes series, told Sky Sports News: Ive been working hard on this and Ive done everything I could have done to get fit. I just needed more time. 

I had a little run-out yesterday and another one this morning but I was still struggling quite badly so obviously there was no chance of me playing. Its a sickening blow really. 

I turned up to the oxygen chamber yesterday and it felt pretty good, the best its felt since the last Test, added the 26-year-old Welshman, who has been using an oxygen chamber to speed up recovery. 

Ive had a few injuries in my career and you have to realise that these things happen. This has been the best series Ive ever played in, playing against the best team in the world. 

His absence as vice-captain Marcus Trescothick put it, will be a major blow... Hes unique, so hes going to leave a big hole. But its totally out of our hands now, you cant sit back and worry. We have to adapt. 

Jones may be replaced by either fellow fast bowler James Anderson or Paul Collingwood. (Reuters)

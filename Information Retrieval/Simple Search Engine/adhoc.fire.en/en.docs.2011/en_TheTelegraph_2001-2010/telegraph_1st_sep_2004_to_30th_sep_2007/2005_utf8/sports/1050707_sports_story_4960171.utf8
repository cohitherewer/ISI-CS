 India in semis

Rotterdam: India escaped to victory and entered the semi-finals of the Junior World Cup hockey tournament with a 1-0 win over England on Wednesday. 

The winner came in the 27th minute when Sandeep Singh converted a penalty corner, his eighth of the championship. The success took Indias points tally to 12, the same as Spain who earlier beat Egypt 2-1. 

However, India were ranked higher on the basis of the number of goals they scored, 12, to Spains 10 after the teams tied on matches won (four) and goal-difference (plus-5). 

Meanwhile from pool F, Argentina advanced to the semi-finals after surprising Australia 3-1. The Aussies had already booked their semi-final slot and the defeat only pushed them to second spot behind Argentina. 

Ironically, England should have been up by three goals but for three crucial saves by Senthil Kumar on the goal-line, goalkeeper Adrian DSouza and centre-half Vivek Gupta. (PTI)

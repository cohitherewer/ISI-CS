A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are going to recruit a World Cupper from Benin. Coffi Edem Agbessi will arrive here within a few days, the club president Swapan Sadhan Bose said on Saturday. 

(Former Mohun Bagan player) Stephen Abarowei has been instrumental in brining Agbessi, who played for Benin in the 2006 World Cup qualifying matches, Bose said. 

The 20-year-old has also taken part in the Youth World Cup in Holland this year. He has played for Olympic Zawla Club of Libya last year and is currently playing for Soliel FC, Contonou, in Benin. He represented Benin in the World Cup qualifiers 10 times and scored against Cameroon. 

Though mainly a striker, Agbessi is also quite adept playing as an attacking midfielder, informed club secretary, Anjan Mitra. 

Stephen, it may be recalled, played for Mohun Bagan in 1999-2000 season and top-scored in the National Football League.

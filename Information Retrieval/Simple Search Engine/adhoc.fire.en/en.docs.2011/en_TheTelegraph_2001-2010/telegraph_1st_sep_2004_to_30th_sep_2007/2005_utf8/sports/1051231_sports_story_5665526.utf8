 Tournament under hawk-eyes

Perth: The controversial line-calling system Hawkeye was used for the first time in an elite-level tournament at the Hopman Cup on Friday and the shot-tracker was called into play early in the opening contest. 

As The Netherlands faced China in a play-off for a place in the eight-nation mixed team event, umpire Pascual Maria overruled a call in the third game but Dutchwoman Michaella Krajicek challenged and the replay supported the original decision. 

Her opponent Shuai Peng then successfully challenged a call early in the second set but lost a subsequent appeal when the replay showed that a Krajicek serve had brushed the line. The Hawkeye system, which had been tested for three years before being used in a seniors event in London recently, uses cameras to track the balls trajectory. 

Information is sent to a computer that generates a three-dimensional animated image and the path of the ball is shown on large screens at the ends of the court. 

However, rules have been put in place to prevent the system being abused, and the chair umpire can deny the challenge if it is thought the player is using it in an inappropriate or untimely manner. The chair umpire also retains the right to make the final decision on a call. 

Peng, who during the 2005 season claimed victories over Kim Clijsters and Elena Dementieva, was rewarded for her persistency when she put China ahead by overcoming the erratic Krajicek 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.

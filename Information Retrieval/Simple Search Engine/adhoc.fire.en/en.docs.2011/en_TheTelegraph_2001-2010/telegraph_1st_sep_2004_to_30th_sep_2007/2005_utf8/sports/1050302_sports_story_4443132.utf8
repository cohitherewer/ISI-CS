The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Central on top vs Bangladesh

 Abbas Ali 

New Delhi: Middle-order batsman Abbas Ali?s brilliant century enabled Central Zone to reach a comfortable 248 for three on the first day of their Duleep Trophy tie against Bangladesh here on Tuesday. 

Bangladesh, making their debut in the competition, were unable to stop the left-handed Madhya Pradesh batsman, who came to the crease when the hosts, electing to bat, were in a spot of bother at 24 for two. 

Ali (122) got fine support from Devendra Bundela, another MP player, who was unbeaten on 83 at stumps. The duo put on 214 for the third wicket to put Central zone in a comfortable position at the Karnail Singh Stadium. 

At close, skipper J.P. Yadav on 10 was giving company to Bundela. 

There seemed no respite for the visitors as they were sent on a leatherhunt by Ali and Bundela under the scorching sun. 

Ali?s 205-ball innings lasted over four hours during which he hit 20 fours and one six, while his partner played more cautiously for his 238-ball knock that contained 10 boundaries.

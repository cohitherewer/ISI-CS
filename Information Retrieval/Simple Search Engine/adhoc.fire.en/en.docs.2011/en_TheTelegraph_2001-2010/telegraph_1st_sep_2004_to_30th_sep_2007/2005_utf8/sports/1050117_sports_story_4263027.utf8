Madrid: Coach Antonio Tapia got off to a winning start in charge of struggling Malaga on Saturday when his new side snatched a morale-boosting 1-0 win at home to high-flying Sevilla in the Primera Liga. 

The only goal of a tight contest came when Sevilla centre-back Aitor Ocio turned the ball into his own net midway through the second half under pressure from Malaga striker Paulo Wanchope after a mix-up in defence. 

Former reserve team coach Tapia took charge of Malaga this week after the sacking of Gregorio Manzano, who lost his job when the team slumped to their eighth defeat in nine games. 

Malaga remain in 18th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, but are now just a point behind Racing Santander and Albacete. 

A first defeat in six matches meant Sevilla missed the chance to keep the pressure on the top four and remain in fifth spot. 

The Andalucians are 10 points adrift of leaders Barcelona. 

Earlier, Getafe fought their way back from a goal down and a sending off to claim a deserved 1-1 draw at home to neighbours Atletico Madrid. Substitute Jorge put Atletico in front when he scored with his first touch of the ball nine minutes before halftime, cracking home from 10 metres. 

Getafe, who have proved difficult opponents for many of the big sides that have visited the Coliseum, were dealt another blow when defender Ruben Pulido was dismissed after picking up a second booking at the stroke of halftime. 

But despite their numerical disadvantage it was the home side that dominated the second half and earned an important point when striker Sergio Pachon added the finishing touch to a beautifully worked passing move. 

Atletico are eighth in the standings while Getafe, who are in their first season in the top flight, are 15th. 

Meanwhile, Chelsea look destined to become English champions for the first time in 50 years after a 2-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur left them 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League on Saturday, as reported in Sunday?s Late City edition. 

Two Frank Lampard goals and a shock 0-1 defeat for reigning champions Arsenal at Bolton Wanderers means only a sudden collapse can deny Chelsea, quoted as 1-9 hot favourites by bookmakers, an historic end to their Centenary season. 

Chelsea, who also became the first club to win six consecutive Premier League games without conceding a goal, did enough to ensure victory after 10-man Manchester United won 1-0 at Liverpool. 

They are now top with 58 points, with Arsenal on 48 and United third on 47, pressing Arsene Wenger?s side for the second automatic slot in next season?s Champions League. 

Elsewhere, Newcastle United skipper Alan Shearer returned from a 12-match injury lay-off to convert a penalty in a 2-1 win over Southampton, Aston Villa were 3-0 winners over Norwich City and Manchester City beat Crystal Palace 3-1. 

Blackburn Rovers won 1-0 win at nine-man Portsmouth, who had striker Lomana LuaLua and midfielder Amdy Faye dismissed in the second half, while Charlton Athletic beat Birmingham City 3-1. 

Lampard broke the deadlock with a 39th-minute penalty after Russian midfielder Alexei Smertin was caught by Spurs skipper and central defender Ledley King. 

Spurs kept probing English football?s best defence but the points were sealed in the 90th minute, when Icelandic striker Eidur Gudjohnsen got behind their rearguard and pulled the ball back for the onrushing Lampard to rifle home. 

Arsenal were no more decisive at the Reebok, the same venue where a 2-2 draw in April 2003 virtually killed their title hopes that season. 

Greek midfielder Stelios Giannakopoulos headed Bolton?s winner four minutes before the break, after Arsenal?s Spanish keeper Manuel Almunia could only flap at a cross from El-Hadji Diouf. 

Arsenal had plenty of possession but Robin van Persie and Robert Pires both missed chances in the second half and striker Thierry Henry lacked his usual cutting edge. 

Ragged at times in the middle and suspect in defence, Arsenal?s defeat was their third of the league season. 

In Italy, Inter Milan?s pursuit of Serie A leaders Juventus stuttered Saturday when they were held to a 0-0 draw by Reggina. 

The result left them fourth with 31 points from 19 games, 12 behind Juventus. 

Inter made a lively start and home keeper Nicola Pavarini had to be alert to beat away early efforts by striker Christian Vieri and midfielder Giorgios Karagounis. 

Reggina were limited to playing on the break and midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura wasted their best chance before the interval when he scuffed his shot on the edge of the area. 

They came out in more determined mood after the restart, forcing Giuseppe Favalli to outjump Carlos Parades to cut out a dangerous cross at the far post.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dempo notch up 4th win

Margao: Ranty Martin?s double strike subdued Mohun Bagan as Dempo scored a 2-0 win to keep their unbeaten run intact after the fifth round of the ninth National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup here on Tuesday. 

The result was a repeat of the ill-fated December 5 Federation Cup final which saw the tragic end of Brazilian Cristiano Junior, who collapsed on the field and died after scoring the second of his two goals. 

Dempo, with this win, have 13 points ? two more than defending champions East Bengal ? to Mohun Bagan?s seven. 

Playing with authority, Dempo controlled the midfield and drew first blood in the 17th minute. 

R.C. Prakash fed Clifford Miranda on the left. He centred the ball into the box which deflected off a defender and Ranty made no mistake in heading into the net after ?keeper Prasanta Dora had hesitated to collect the ball. 

Dempo kept the rival defence under pressure with a steady flow of passes and increased the lead in the 62nd minute when a move on the left saw Prakash getting the better of two rival defenders and laid a perfect cross to Ranty who headed home from close. 

Bagan made a couple of changes in the midfield, bringing in Dulal Biswas and Abhay Kumar, but the move didn?t fetch results. (PTI)

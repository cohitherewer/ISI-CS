The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav at No. 5 on Glamorgan debut

 - Im looking ahead, not back, says team India captain

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly wont be the only one making his Glamorgan debut (against Sussex) on Wednesday ? the Welsh County is also capping 18-year-old allrounder Adam Harrison. 

Currently at the bottom of the Championship table, owing to defeats in all five matches, Glamorgan have no choice but to gamble in the four-day game at Swansea. 

Sourav, who had his first nets in Cardiff on Tuesday, will bat at his preferred position in first-class cricket: No.5. 

Formally introduced to teammates by captain Robert Croft, Sourav is the second Indian (after Ravi Shastri) to play for the County. 

Sourav drove across from London early in the morning, not many hours after returning from Brussels with a fresh visa enabling him to work in the UK. 

As there was uncertainty over accommodation ? apparently, the geyser at the allotted flat needed to be set right ? and Sourav was booked at a hotel for a couple of days, wife Dona and daughter Sana chose to remain in London for another 48 hours. 

Sourav has been off cricket since April 12 and, in any case, fared poorly in all three Tests versus Pakistan and the first four ODIs of the six-match series. After that, of course, the ICC-slapped ban took centrestage. 

Therefore, there is lots to prove: That he is good enough to still be counted among the best in business? That too much ought not to be read into his mediocre showing for Lancashire in the summer of 2000? 

Assuming the six-ODI ban stays (the BCCI, as of now, is undecided about making a special appeal to the ICC) and Souravs contract is extended till mid-August, he can play a maximum of eight first-class games plus five limited overs matches. 

Opportunities to get back among the runs, then, are many. Appreciating that, Sourav told The Telegraph hes looking ahead, not back. 

While Glamorgan got promoted to Division 1 of the Championship this year, they are the limited overs title holders. 

The County, according to coach John Derrick, is going to field a 3-1 attack against Sussex. 

The new ball will be shared by rookie Adams elder brother David and Andrew Davis, with the younger Harrison himself chipping in with his medium-pace. Left-armer Dean Cosker is the sole specialist spinner. 

Sourav, too, may do some bowling. 

Captained by Chris Adams, the Sussex squad includes Pakistans Mushtaq Ahmed and Murray Goodwin, who left Zimbabwe when his career was set to really take off. 

The weather is expected to be clear on the first two days, but there could be occasional rain thereafter. Swansea is on the sea front, some 45 minutes by road from Cardiff. 

GLAMORGAN XI 

(As of Tuesday evening) 

Matthew Elliott, Dan Cherry, David Hemp, Mike Powell, Sourav Ganguly, Mark Wallace (wk), Robert Croft, David Harrison, Andrew Davis, Dean Cosker, Adam Harrison.

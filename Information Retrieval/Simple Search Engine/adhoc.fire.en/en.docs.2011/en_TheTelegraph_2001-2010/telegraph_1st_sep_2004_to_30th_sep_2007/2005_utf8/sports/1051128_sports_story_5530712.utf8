Calcutta: Its not known, but Amal Dutta must be cursing Biswajit Bhattacharya, the former Mohammedan Sporting coach, whose boys humiliated the red-and-golds 3-2 on Thursday. 

Determined to prove a point or two ? to their critics, supporters and, of course, arch-rivals Mohun Bagan ? the new and improved East Bengal shook off their lethargy and inflicted one of the worst defeats in the Mohun Bagan coachs career, the green-and-maroons going down 1-4 in an IFA Shield match at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Sunday. 

It was 1997 revisited for the veteran Dutta, whose boys, notwithstanding a 20-minute burst towards the end of the match, looked thoroughly out of sorts, disoriented and were outplayed in all parts of the game. And it didnt help that Subrata Pal at times gave the impression that he lacks basic goalkeeping skills. 

In contrast, everything fell in place for Subhas Bhowmick. Under pressure for losing the last two clashes against the arch-rivals and without any silverware this season, Bhowmick can now breathe a little easy. The semi-final too doesnt seem a distant dream now. 

And if an impression had been generated that its not possible to win derbies without foreigners, then it was left to one Alvito DCunha to disprove it. 

The East Bengal midfielder played an inspired game, netting two and setting another, with Chandan Das and Mike Okoro scoring one each. Akeem Abolanle was the lone scorer for Bagan. 

The match, though, differed from the usual derby fare with the teams locked in the midfield to gain control. That it didnt owe a lot to the quick goal and even quicker equaliser. 

Eight minutes into the match, East Bengal earned a free-kick at least 30 yards off the post. Chandan Das ambled up and placed a neat right-footer that took one deflection and went past the hapless Pal into the second post to make it 1-0. 

Five minutes later, Bagans Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, who otherwise had a forgettable game, managed to send an innocuous-looking pass through to Akeem, who collected it coolly inside the box, turned and placed it past the second post. It is debatable whether defenders Covan Lawrence and Arun Malhotra, who didnt move an inch, were admiring Akeems skills. 

Just when the game seemed to meander a bit, out came another brilliant free-kick by DCunha in the 28th minute. He floated the right-footer inside the box, which Okoro gleefully accepted and headed it home. Pal, who should have come out challenging, seemed rooted to the spot. It was not only a case of bad defending, worse, the way Okoro was allowed to meet the ball inside the six yards, must raise serious questions about Pals abilities. 

If Bagan supporters thought Pal had already committed his worst blunder, as if to prove them wrong, in the 42nd minute, the goalkeeper did something which was unbelievable. Instead of throwing it to one of his teammates after goal-kick, he put the ball straight into Alvitos path, who after the initial shock, placed a searing left-footer into the net to make it 3-1. Needless to say, no defenders were around. 

If Dutta was already handicapped by Noels leaving the ground ?? due to an injury ?? in the 17th minute, he was desperate now. Jerry Zirsanga had replaced Harbinder just before the third goal, and Dutta was seriously handicapped. 

After the lemon break, though, Bagan seemed to have gained some of their old form back. They started stitching passes and though their attacks were largely absorbed by the East Bengal defence, yet Gley Yao Rodrigue managed to send the red-and-gold hearts a flutter when his scorching right-footer hit the crossbar in the 52nd minute. 

Bagan performance graph then took a downward spiral as East Bengal slowly throttled them. 

The icing on East Bengal cake came in injury time when the spectators and the media were leaving their seats. Alvito sprinted through in a solo move and chased by Bagan defenders, went parallel to the goalline on the left flank. His left-footer took everyone, including the beleaguered Pal, by surprise as it entered the goal from a zero angle. 

This was East Bengals day after all.

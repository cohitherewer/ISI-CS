 IN THE CITY

 AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has taken strong exception to East Bengal and Mohun Bagan?s stand in delaying release of players for the ongoing national camp in Bangalore to prepare for next month?s tour of Fiji. 

 A communication from Das Munshi, which reached the IFA office on Wednesday, also expresses dismay over the Big Two?s attempt to belittle the tour. 

 East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, in a letter to the IFA on Tuesday, had labelled the tour as insignificant, pointing out that Fiji is not a name in international soccer. As a result, they had asked for a month-end release of their players.

 Alvito D?Cunha finally joined the East Bengal players in practice on Wednesday. Alvito, who showed up on Tuesday, was not allowed to practise by coach Subhas Bhowmick for his late arrival.

 Central Swimming Club beat Self Culture Institute 10-2 in the all-Bengal Open waterpolo meet. In another tie, College Square Swimming Club defeated YMCA 5-1.

 BASKETBALL: Inter-school matches at WBBA courts from 2 pm. 

 FOOTBALL: Quarter finals of the Trades Cup at various grounds.

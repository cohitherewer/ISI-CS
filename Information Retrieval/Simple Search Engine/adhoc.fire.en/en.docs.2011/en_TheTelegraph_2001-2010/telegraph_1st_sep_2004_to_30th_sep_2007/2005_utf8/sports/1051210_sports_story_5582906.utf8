 Aristotle fancied 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Its going to be a close contest in the star event on Saturday, the Chantilli Calcutta 2,000 Guineas. The three classy youngsters, in a field of eight ? Aristotle, Arturo and and Rising Force ? stand head and shoulders above the rest.

 However, it is the Vijay Singh-trained Aristotle who gets the first call. The Razeen-Excentrique son is not only improving with each run, he is also cut out for the mile trip. Further, the stable jockey, C.Alford, has opted for the Deepak Khaitan-owned horse.

 Arturo, Khaitans other fancied runner ? trained by Darius Byramji ? is no pushover, though the Steinbeck-Wandering Star son gives the impression that he is may find the Guineas trip a wee bit long. 

 Much is expected from Rising Force, the southern-challenger. The Alnasr Alwasheek colt may, however, need this run.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 Jeev shares 4th spot 

Hokkaido: Jeev Milkha Singh fired a three-under 69 to be tied fourth on the second day of the Sega Sammy Cup here on Friday. 

Jeev, who has not had a top-10 finish since the first two events on Japan Tour this year, aggregates five-under 139 in the prize money 120 million-yen tournament. 

He had a first round of two-under 70 at the par-72 North Country Golf Club 

Scott Laycock led after rounds of 66 and 70 to total eight-under 136. Sharing the second place were Fijian Dinesh Chand and Taiwans KC Lin, who had 69s on both days. One shot behind them were Jeev and five others. 

At one stage, the Chandigarh pro was five-under for the day with a brilliant front nine in which he had five birdies and took only 11 putts. 

Till the 13th he shared lead with Laycock, but bogeys on the 14th and 17th cost him dear and he dropped to tied fourth

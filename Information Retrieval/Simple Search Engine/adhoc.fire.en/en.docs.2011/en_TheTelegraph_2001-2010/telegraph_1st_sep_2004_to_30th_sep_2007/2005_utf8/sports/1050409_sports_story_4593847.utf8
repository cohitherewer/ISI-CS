 Dreev only winner of day

 Harikrishna drew with Rustemov 

Dos Hermanas (Spain): P. Harikrishna tried hard before settling for a draw against Russian Alexander Rustemov in the seventh round of the category-16 Dos Hermanas international chess tournament here. 

More drawn games were the order of the round as for the second day in succession there was only one decisive game while the remaining four ended without a result in the 10-player round robin event. 

The lone winner was Alexey Dreev who eventually succeeded in scoring his first victory in the tournament, beating Ruben Felgaer of Argentina. 

Cuban Lenier Dominguez and Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia drew their games against Azerbaijans Teimour Radjabov and local hope Miguel Illescas Cordoba, respectively. Russian Oleg Korneev also did not achieve much with his white pieces against Ukrainian Sergey Karjakin. 

As a result of so many drawn games, the lead positions remained unchanged and Radjabov continued to be at the helm with 4.5 points in his kitty. 

Close behind were Karjakin and Azmaiparashvili on four points apiece while another half a point adrift was a pack of four players ?Harikrishna, Dreev, Felgaer and Rustemov. Korneev was next in line along with Cordoba on three and Dominguez remains at the bottom of the table on just 2.5 points. 

In the last two rounds now, the onus will be on the Indian if he has to catch up with Radjabov in the standing list. (PTI)

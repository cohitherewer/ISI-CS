Manchester: Australias Brett Lee has recovered from a knee infection in time for the third Ashes Test starting on Thursday, while Glenn McGrath is still clinging to the hope of also playing at Old Trafford. 

An Australia spokesman said Lee was fit and available for selection but McGrath would be assessed again on Thursday morning. 

Lee spent two nights in hospital in Birmingham on an intravenous drip and receiving antibiotics after a graze on his left knee became inflamed. He rejoined the squad on Wednesday and bowled at full pace in an afternoon session. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting told a news conference on the eve of the match on Wednesday: Brett seems to be okay. He has responded to the treatment. He will be training this afternoon and we hope hell get some good bowling under his belt and recovers well on Thursday morning. 

Hes a pretty important player for us right now and well give him the best possible chance to play. 

Asked if he was ruling McGrath out, Ponting replied: No, I wont say that definitely. Hes coming down to the ground on Wednesday to continue his rehab work with the physio. 

He accepted that McGrath would have to bowl to convince the selectors. 

With the sort of injury he has had, you would want to know how it will respond after at least one stint of bowling. 

If he has a chance of playing, he would probably have to bowl. It hurt him a lot not taking part in the last Test so he will be pretty keen to prove everybody wrong. 

The Edgbaston result, perhaps for the first time since 1989, has given England momentum as well as belief. 

The Old Trafford pitch is also expected to be hard and fast, favouring their quicks, although it will also offer Shane Warne, one away from becoming the first man to 600 Test wickets, some turn later in the match. 

Australia are considering using two spinners at Old Trafford, with leg spinner Stuart MacGill supplementing Warne, but there is also a good chance that both sides will be unchanged. 

Meanwhile, England are planning to tap into the Old Trafford experience of Andrew Flintoff before naming their side, adds another report from Manchester. 

England captain Michael Vaughan did not reveal his starting line-up on Wednesday despite all the players being fit. 

The hosts have retained uncapped paceman Chris Tremlett in their 12-man squad, and Vaughan that England were thinking about handing the Hampshire seamer a Test debut. 

On whether England have decided on their XI, Vaughan replied: No not yet. We just want to see the conditions and have a good long chat with Freddie (Flintoff). Its his home ground. He knows the conditions better than most, certainly over the last year or so. 

We havent played that much here so we are going to try to use his experience and see which is the best way to go, added Vaughan, whose Yorkshire teammate Matthew Hoggard would appear to be the most likely candidate to make way if Tremlett were to feature in this Test. 

We want to have a look at the options of normal swing (Hoggards speciality), reverse swing, bounce (Tremlett), all the areas that you cover in a normal game, Vaughan said. 

We probably wont decide until the last minute. 

Warnes new bunny 

Meanwhile, Shane Warne believes he has already established a firm psychological hold over England batsman Andrew Strauss after dismissing him with a wonder ball in the second Test, adds another report. Warne likened Strauss to former South Africa batsman Daryll Cullinan, who famously struggled against the leg spinner. 

Ive got plans for all the guys I bowl to, especially Straussy, he said on Wednesday in the run-up to the third Test. (AGENCIES)

 Beijing: Chinese Olympic 110m hurdles champion Liu Xiang has lost a case against a Beijing-based newspaper which published his photos without the athlete?s consent.

 The Haidian district people?s court in Beijing on Wednesday dismissed Liu?s petition suing the paper for using his photos on the cover and other pages last year soon after he won the gold medal in the 110m hurdles in Athens, a report said on Thursday.

 Liu claimed the newspaper violated his right of portrait. However, the court ruled that the picture was used for news reporting purposes instead of advertisement.

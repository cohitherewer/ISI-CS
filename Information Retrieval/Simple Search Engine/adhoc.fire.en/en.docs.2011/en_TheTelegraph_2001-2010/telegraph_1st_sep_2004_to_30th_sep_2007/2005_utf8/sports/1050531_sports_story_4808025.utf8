The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

Permanent coach after Azlan Shah a must

Stick Work 

Gurbux Singh

Sunil Dutt is no more, may his soul rest in peace. 

The main thing I remember about him is how good a human being he was. That was 

the impression I got in the one year he was in office. Whenever a complaint went 

to him he used to go ahead and check. This personal checking is essential in the 

sports world.

He may not have known too much about the nitty gritties 

of sports, but he was surely an aficionado. I remember that during his heydays 

he used to go and watch key hockey matches, not just cricket. In those days top 

stars like Dilip Kumar, Johnny Walker, Shammi Kapoor, Pran, Mehmood all used to 

go and watch top hockey and football matches. Dutt Saab was also an avid 

follower, that way.

His sudden death came as a shock. He was a person 

who had a certain vision. He wanted to work the idea of stadiums in schools and 

he pushed it to be included in the concurrent list so it could not be overlooked. 

A mild-mannered and good man, he probably had sports 

at heart and wanted to do something for sports in the country. It is a loss for 

us all.

Coming to hockey, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) 

elections are over, and I, as returning officer, was thankful that all reposed 

their confidence in me.

What I noticed during the elections was that there 

was full co-operation from all people, the whole House, in fact. This included 

senior vice-president Narinder Batra, who had thrown his hat into the ring. 

It was held in a very cordial and decent atmosphere, 

despite some points of dispute which were quickly resolved. Though it took a lot 

of time, in the end everybody was satisfied, and I believe, as returning officer, 

I can surely say it all went pretty democratically. K.P.S. Gills leadership 

could be useful for Indian hockey.

A court order does not allow the results of the election 

to be declared, but now that at least the formalities are over, the officials 

and the IHF in general can get down to the serious business of the upcoming major 

tournaments.

With the ongoing Azlan Shah Cup start the numerous 

meets towards the big ones.

Top teams of world hockey are showing off their wares 

at the Azlan Shah. It, surely, is a team-building meet, this being the first top-class 

tourney after the Olympics. 

We have in our field of view, the Junior World Cup, 

from June 29 to July 10 in Rotterdam; an eight-nation mini-World Cup, from August 

14 to 21 in Amsterdam, then a mini Test series vs Malaysia in September in Hyderabad 

and Chennai, to be followed by a four-nation meet in October. The same month, 

we are trying to hold an Indo-Pak Test series before we go over to the Champions 

Trophy in Chennai (December 10-18).

The real big meets are next year ? the Commonwealth 

Games in March, the World Cup in Germany in September and the Asian Games in Doha 

in December.

The programme is packed. It will be a season of preparation. 

Even through the Champions Trophy we should prepare.

We are missing the services of many key players in 

the Azlan Shah, the half line will be shaky. Some key junior players will be off 

to the World Cup, and since we are the defending champions, it assumes greater 

importance than the Azlan Shah.

I believe that after this tourney a permanent coach 

will be appointed. This is especially imperative because we have too many important 

tournaments coming up. An immediate (after the Azlan Shah) appointment will enable 

the new coach to mould his players to his advantage and to a good, fighting combination.

It is up to the IHF to decide if there is a long-term 

solution to a foreign coach. I am open to both, Indian and foreign coaches. But 

the term should be a minimum two years.

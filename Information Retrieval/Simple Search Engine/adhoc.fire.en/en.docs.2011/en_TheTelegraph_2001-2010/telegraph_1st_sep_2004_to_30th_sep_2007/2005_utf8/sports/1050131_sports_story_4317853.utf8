The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport

 Monday, January 31, 2005 

 London: Chelsea made record English soccer losses of ?88 million ($166 million) in 2003-04, their first season under the ownership of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, the Premier League club said on Sunday. The pre-tax figures for the year to June 30, 2004 surpass Leeds United?s previous record loss of ?49.5m in 2003. 

 Chelsea spokesman Simon Greenberg confirmed the losses for the club?s parent company Chelsea Village, saying the accounts would be filed to British company registration centre Companies House on Monday.

 Compared with Abramovich?s vast fortune the loss is unlikely to worry Chelsea, who are 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League and on course to win their first title for 50 years. 

 Lens: Brazilian under-21 international striker Jussie Ferreira Vieira has signed a five-year contract with Racing Lens, the French club said.

 The 21-year-old scored 12 goals in 46 matches for Brazilian team Cruzeiro last season.

 Lens are 13th in the Ligue 1 standings following their 2-1 victory over Racing Strasbourg on Saturday. They have scored only 23 goals in 24 games.

 The transfer fee, which has not been officially disclosed, is reportedly around 3.5 million euros. 

 Raleigh: World champion Tirunesh Dibaba broke the women?s 5,000m indoor world record at the Boston Indoor Games in Massachusetts on Saturday. Dibaba?s fellow Ethiopian and double world record holder Kenenisa Bekele misjudged the finish and was beaten in the men?s 3,000 metres.

 The 19-year-old Dibaba clocked 14:32.93 to chop more than six seconds off compatriot Berhane Adere?s world record of 14:39.29 set in Stuttgart in 2004.

 Bekele, the world outdoor record holder at 5,000 and 10,000 m and the Olympic 10,000 champion, sprinted for what he thought was the finish line with 400 metres to go. But another lap still remained and he was passed by Ireland?s Alistair Cragg, who won in 7:39.89, the fastest time in the world this year. Bekele came home second in 7:41.42. 

 Athens: Christos Tzekos, coach of Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, facing two-year bans for missed doping tests accused Olympic officials on Sunday of incorrect notification procedures that forced his athletes to withdraw from the Games. Tzekos told a disciplinary committee the pair had never avoided being tested, contradicting an official who said they could not be found in the athletes? village to undergo testing.

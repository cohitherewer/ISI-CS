 Special birthday gift for Fischer

 Arrangements have been made for Fischer to travel to Iceland 

Tokyo: After eight months in a Japanese detention centre awaiting deportation to the United States, things may finally be looking up for chess legend Bobby Fischer, who turns 62 on Wednesday. 

Iceland has stepped in to offer him a passport. And friends say they?ve already bought him a very special birthday present ? a plane ticket out of Japan. 

?The committee to free Bobby Fischer is very pleased to announce that Bobby?s lawyer, Masako Suzuki, took possession of his new Icelandic passport at the Icelandic embassy in Tokyo,? his supporters said in an announcement Tuesday. 

Hoping to end the stalemate over Fischer?s future, Iceland, the country where Fischer won the world chess championship in 1972, has agreed to welcome the erratic genius as one of its own, issuing him both the passport and granting him a residence permit. 

?All necessary preparations for Bobby Fischer to travel to Iceland have been made,? Suzuki said in a separate statement. 

The development marked a moral victory and was likely to put more pressure on Japan to respond to supporters? demands that Fischer be freed. The game, however, is far from over. 

Despite a flurry of legal challenges mounted by the famously unpredictable Fischer ? who since being detained has renounced his US citizenship and announced his engagement to a Japanese woman ? immigration officials have so far refused to budge. They had had no immediate comment on the latest developments. US embassy officials have also refused to comment on the Fischer case. 

Washington has sought Fischer, who beat Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union to become world champion, on charges of violating international sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a rematch against him there in 1992. This week, a Japanese newspaper reported US prosecutors are also building a case against Fischer for alleged tax-evasion and are hoping to convene a grand jury on April 5. 

Fischer has said he was not duly notified in advance of the revocation, and claims he is being hounded for political reasons. 

If Fischer is indicted, Japan would be obligated to send him to the US under a bilateral treaty. 

Gudmundur Thorarinsson, a former member of Iceland?s parliament, added that Fischer complained of headaches and dizziness caused by the stress of confinement. 

?We are talking about the greatest chess genius that ever walked the earth,? he said. ?He has an Iceland passport and permission to stay there. We thought the problem was solved.? (AP)

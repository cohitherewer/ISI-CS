 Narain 17th, Raikkonen on provisional pole

Imola: India?s F1 rookie Narain Karthikeyan clocked almost two seconds faster that than his teammate but could manage only a 17th place finish in the first qualifying session at the San Marino Grand Prix circuit here. 

Kimi Raikkonen of McLaren-Mercedes took the provisional pole with a timing of 1 minute 19.886 seconds while championship leader Fernando Alonso of Team Renault was a close second. 

Defending champion Michael Schumacher of Ferrari was third with a timing of 1 minute 20.260 seconds. 

Karthikeyan, who had finished 17th in the final practice session as well, was a bit slower than his practice session timings but his Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro as well as the two Minardi drivers Patrick Friesacher and Christijan Albers, who hit the track with their new PSO5 cars, failed to better Karthikeyan?s timing. 

There were two damage-free incidents in the morning practice session when Karthikeyan went off at the turn 8 and Monteiro did likewise in turn 12. 

Meanwhile, Raikkonen put his team on the top with an aggressive driver after Schumacher, who has just two points from three races so far, led the field for most of the qualifying period. The German, who went out early, looked like he would remain in the first row till the last two cars of Raikkonen and Alonso hit the track. 

The McLaren driver first improved on Schumacher?s timing by 0.374 seconds and then Alonso fell short by 0.003 seconds from the leader. 

Karthikeyan said the track was tricky but added that he was pretty positive for the rest of the weekend. ?The track here at Imola is quite tricky as you need to use the kerbs a lot if you want to make a quick lap. I have lost a bit of time in the first sector but otherwise I think I did a decent lap. 

?We have made some progress and if we keep making similar steps, we will improve. I am pretty positive for the rest of the weekend and I am looking forward for tomorrow,? he added. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pressure will be on Indians, feels 

 Inzamam

 A CORRESPONDENT

 Inzy says his team won?t have problems 

 adjusting to Indian pitches 

 New Delhi: Pakistan captain 

 Inzamam-ul Haq handled a variety of questions ranging from 

 pressure factor, his future as captain, absence of Shoaib 

 Akhtar and the slow nature of wickets during his interaction 

 with the media on arrival here Monday. 

 The captain was accompanied by 

 coach Bob Woolmer, manager Salim Altaf and vice-captain 

 Younis Khan during the briefing.

 Asked whether his comparatively 

 inexperienced team would be under pressure during the tour, 

 the skipper said: ?Last year when India toured Pakistan, 

 we were under pressure. This time they will be under pressure 

 in front of their home crowd.? 

 Inzamam, however, agreed that 

 frequent cricketing exchanges have decreased the hysteria 

 associated with India-Pakistan contest to a certain extent. 

 ?The pressure has eased a bit, but whenever the two sides 

 play they produce exciting and quality cricket. And with 

 quality comes the pressure.? 

 The captain didn?t feel any apprehension 

 with the slow turning tracks. ?Pakistan batsmen play spin 

 well. Our players will have no problems in adjusting to 

 the Indian pitches. In fact the pitches here should help 

 our batsmen.? 

 Inzamam even struck a positive 

 note when he said that his team had quality spinners who 

 would be able to exploit the conditions well. ?If we get 

 spinning tracks, I think we have the bowlers who can exploit 

 them. Danish Kaneria has bowled well in recent times. Arshad 

 Khan is also a very experienced bowler and we also have 

 Shahid Afridi. It is a good spin attack.? 

 The skipper added that Kaneria?s 

 ability to bowl on a turner is as good as anybody in the 

 world.

 When questioned about the absence 

 of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, Inzamam said: ?An Indo-Pak 

 series is always interesting and absence of any one particular 

 player does not matter much. Of course, Shoaib is our strike 

 bowler and his absence will be felt, but we have got some 

 promising young fast bowlers and I hope they will be able 

 to perform.?

 On Sachin Tendulkar?s return to 

 action, he stated, ?Tendulkar is a great player. If he is 

 not playing or is not in good form, it?s an advantage to 

 the opposition. He is such a player that even if he comes 

 to play after a long gap, he will still be able to perform.?

 The Pakistan skipper was in a 

 humorous mood when he said that he had been playing over 

 a dozen years and was used to constant shake-ups in Pakistani 

 cricket. He was referring to a query on how it felt to have 

 a new vice-captain and a change of coach from Javed Miandad 

 to Bob Woolmer.

 Signing off on a personal note, 

 Inzamam said that he hoped to be fit to play his 100th Test 

 in Bangalore.

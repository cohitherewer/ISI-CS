 Slovakia to face Argentina in final

Perth: Slovakia clinched a place in the Hopman Cup final for the second successive year on Friday after they beat the Netherlands 3-0 in their last group match. 

Daniela Hantuchova beat Michaella Krajicek 6-4, 6-2 to put the third seeds ahead and an injury to Peter Wessels in the first set of his match with Dominik Hrbaty handed the Slovaks an unbeatable lead. 

Last year?s runners-up were handed a walkover and a place in the final against Argentina, who topped group A (as reported in Friday?s late City edition), after they too reached the title round by default as Germany conceeded their match. 

?It?s really important for us to be in the final,? said Hrbaty, who was leading 5-2 when Wessels retired because of a chest muscle injury. ?I have a 3-1 record over (Guillermo) Coria, but he retired in all three of those matches. 

?We?ve practised together three or four times this week, and I like his game as he doesn?t hit it too fast, not too many winners.? Last year, Hantuchova and Karol Kucera made it to the final by default when a foot injury to Alicia Molik cost Australia their place against the United States. 

In 2004, former world number five Hantuchova did not win a match in the event, but two wins from her three matches left her confident of beating Gisela Dulko in the final. 

?I feel like it?s really deserved this time as I?ve helped Dominik to get through,? Hantuchova said. ?I think if I keep going the way I have been in the past few matches then I will be okay. 

?I was really pleased with my last two singles, even the first one (a loss against Molik), which was a really high standard. You can?t ask for a better preparation than to play a few matches here for the Australian Open.? 

Friday?s play began with the US, Slovakia and the Netherlands all in with a chance of topping group B. 

But when Meghann Shaughnessy was beaten 2-6, 3-6 by Molik while Hantuchova was beating Krajicek, the Americans? chances of reaching the final looked slim. 

Slovakia?s 3-0 victory then ensured they could not be overtaken at the top of the group. 

Despite their exit, James Blake thrilled the crowd with a typically athletic display against Paul Baccanello, the world number 324, who came in when Mark Philippoussis was forced out because of two torn muscles in his groin. 

Blake missed much of 2004 after fracturing a vertebrae in his neck in May when he ran into a net-post in Rome, but he threw himself around against Baccanello as he won 6-3, 6-4 to pull the US level at 1-1. 

?I went to Harvard but that doesn?t mean I?m that bright,? Blake joked. ?Once in a while I?ll slow down but not today.? 

Blake and Shaughnessy then edged out Molik and Baccanello in the deciding mixed doubles, winning 6-7 (6-8), 7-5 and 10-7 in the match tiebreak to clinch a 2-1 victory. (Reuters)

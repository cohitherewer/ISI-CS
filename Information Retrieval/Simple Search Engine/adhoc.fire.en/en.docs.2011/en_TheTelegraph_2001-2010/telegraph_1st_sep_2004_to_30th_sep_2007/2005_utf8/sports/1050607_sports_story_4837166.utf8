Porto Alegre (Brazil): Ronaldinho converted two first-half penalties as Brazil beat Paraguay 4-1 on Sunday to close in on a place at the 2006 World Cup. 

Ze Roberto and 21-year-old Santos forward Robinho added two more goals in the second half as Brazil ended a three-match winless run against their smaller neighbours. Bayern Munichs Roque Santa Cruz headed Paraguays consolation. 

Defender Lucio spoiled the day for the world champions when he was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 79th minute. 

Brazil, second in the 10-nation South American World Cup qualifying group with 27 points from 14 games, moved within one point of leaders Argentina, whom they meet in Buenos Aires on Wednesday. 

Paraguay stayed fourth with 19 points and their defeat was good news for Colombia, Uruguay and Chile, who are all two points behind them. 

The top four teams go straight to the Germany finals next year and the fifth play off over two legs against the Oceania regions winners for another place. Ecuador, who upset Argentina 2-0 on Saturday, are in third place. 

The game kicked off five minutes late because of an overlong fireworks display and Brazil, without suspended captain Cafu and worn-out Real Madrid striker Ronaldo, quickly took the initiative. 

Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar twice dived at the feet of Adriano as the Inter Milan forward broke through and made an excellent save in the 15th minute to turn away Kakas low drive after a quick exchange of passes by the Brazil attack. Kaka was also foiled by a timely tackle from Julio Mansur when he was in an excellent shooting position. 

Paraguay threatened with some of their trademark aerial attacks but failed to properly test goalkeeper Dida. 

The breakthrough came in the 33rd minute when Roberto Carloss cross struck the outstretched arm of Carlos Bonet, Uruguayan referee Martin Vazquez pointed to the spot and Ronaldinho sent the penalty low to Villars right. 

Nine minutes later, Robinho fell over Paulo da Silvas outstretched leg and, although television replays suggested no contact was made, Brazil were awarded another penalty and Ronaldinho blasted the ball high into the top left hand corner. 

Ze Roberto, who hit the crossbar after a neat exchange with Kaka in the 48th minute, added the third in the 71st with a curling 25-metre shot. 

In between, Paraguays Carlos Paredes shaved the foot of the post with a shot on the turn and the visitors had a penalty turned down when Roque Junior appeared to hold down an opponent. 

They were rewarded in the 73rd minute when Santa Cruz rose at the far post to head in Denis Canizas cross from the right. 

Despite Lucios dismissal, Brazil restored their three-goal lead when Robinho ran on to Ze Robertos pass in the 83rd minute and calmly slotted the ball past Villar.Meanwhile, Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said after the match that We are virtually qualified. 

With four games to go, I dont see how we cannot qualify, he said. Parreira, however, felt his team could have won by even more. 

It was a modest result considering the amount of play we had, he said. Dida didnt have a single save to make, not one. Their goalkeeper made several. It wasnt just the four goals which made me happy, he added. 

Paraguay played very cautiously, they know how to defend but we created a lot of chances, we controlled the game and we did it all playing the Brazilian way. 

Parreira singled out midfielder Ze Roberto for special praise after he scored the third goal, hit the crossbar and provided the pass for Robinho to add the fourth.People who say this player doesnt have a place in the team are doing him an enormous injustice, said Parreira. (Reuters)

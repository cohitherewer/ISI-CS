 Advani falters, Pak crawl back

Karachi: Pankaj Advani thrice faltered on coloured balls to allow Imran Shahzad win the crucial lucky seven single match that allowed Pakistan to trim Indias lead to 12-11 on the first day of the Lawrencepur snooker challenge 2005 at the Karachi Club here Thursday. 

India had entered the last singles match leading the host nation 12-8. But Advani, the former world snooker champion and reigning world billiards champion, failed to sink the green in the centre pocket, blue in the bottom left pocket and pink in the bottom right pocket that would have won him the frame. 

Instead, Imran potted the green, brown and blue and then sunk the decisive pink in the top left to win the nerve-wrecking frame 54-43. 

Indias other disappointments came when Pakistans 1993 world champion Mohammad Yousuf defeated Devendra Joshi 58-50, 68-61, 57-33 and last years losing world championship finalist Saleh Mohammad had the better of Manan Chandra 70-38, 70-27, 13-76. 

In a match of emerging stars, Advani blanked out Pakistan captain Naveen Perwani 94-05, 83-38, 74-30 including two half-century breaks in the second and third frames.

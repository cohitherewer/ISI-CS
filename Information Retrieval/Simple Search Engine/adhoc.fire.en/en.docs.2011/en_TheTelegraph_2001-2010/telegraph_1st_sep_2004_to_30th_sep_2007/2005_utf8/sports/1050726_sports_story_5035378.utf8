 Shikha upsets Craybas

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza had been hogging all the headlines lately. Now, its Shikha Uberois turn. The older of the two US-based Uberoi sisters pulled off a major upset to advance to the final qualifying round of the $585,000 Stanford WTA Tier II meet. 

According to information received here, the 131st-ranked Shikha shut out world No. 56 Jill Craybas 6-4, 6-4 in the second round of the qualifiers. Craybas, it may be recalled, had created a big ripple at Wimbledon last month by knocking out fourth seed and two-time champion Serena Williams. 

Sania and Neha Uberoi also advanced to within a win of the main draw. 

Sania, pulled off two wins on the same day. She first saw off Canadian Maureen Drake 6-3, 6-3 and then drubbed Lindsey Lee-Waters (US, 95) 6-1, 6-3. She meets Israeli Shahar Peer. 

Neha beat Teryn Ashley (US) in three sets and Meilen Tu 7-6, 6-2 to set up a final-round clash with Alina Jidkova.

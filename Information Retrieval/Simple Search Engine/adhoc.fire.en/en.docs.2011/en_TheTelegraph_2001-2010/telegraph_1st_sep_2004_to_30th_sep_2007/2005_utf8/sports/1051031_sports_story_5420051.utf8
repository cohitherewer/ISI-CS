 World record by Lian

Beijing: Chinese strongwoman Yang Lian lifted 117 kg in the clean-and-jerk on Sunday, setting a weightlifting world record in the 48 kg category at the East Asian Games in Macau. 

Yangs gold-winning effort bettered the previous world mark by 1 kg. She lifted 90kg in the snatch for a total of 207kg. 

I felt relaxed today, the 23-year old Yang said. An East Asian Games gold is good, an Olympic gold will be even better, she said. (PTI)

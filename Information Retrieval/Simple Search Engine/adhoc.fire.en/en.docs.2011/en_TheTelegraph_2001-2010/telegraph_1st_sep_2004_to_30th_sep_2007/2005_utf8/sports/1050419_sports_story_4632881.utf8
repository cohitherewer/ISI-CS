The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Gurbux stays

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) secretary Gurbux Singh has withdrawn the resignation letter he had sent to his president Dinesh Vajpai, protesting the state authorities? apathy towards the association?s long-standing demand for an astroturf. 

?My president and all in the BHA insisted that I continue in my post,? said the Olympian. 

?We have decided that the issue must be taken up in its entirety, including claims for an academy and other features that could boost the sport in the state. 

?We have decided that we have done enough of the folded-hands approach, and this time we shift to a proper agitation. This will start immediately after the end of the local hockey season, in mid-May.?

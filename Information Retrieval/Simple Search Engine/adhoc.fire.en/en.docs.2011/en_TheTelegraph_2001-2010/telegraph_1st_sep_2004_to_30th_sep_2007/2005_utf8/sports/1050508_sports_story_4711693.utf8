 Schumi still optimistic

Barcelona: Michael Schumacher remained optimistic on Saturday after a disappointing qualifying session threatened to end his five-year run of Spanish GP pole positions. 

Schumachers time was 0.603 of a second slower than Toyotas Jarno Trulli, with the grid to be decided on aggregate times on Sunday. 

?Whatever happens in final qualifying, this is not the ideal position on the grid,? said Schumacher. ?So we will have to rely on our race performance. I am much happier with that and I think we are much more competitive in race trim. It is fair to say we are still struggling with our single lap performance.? (Reuters)

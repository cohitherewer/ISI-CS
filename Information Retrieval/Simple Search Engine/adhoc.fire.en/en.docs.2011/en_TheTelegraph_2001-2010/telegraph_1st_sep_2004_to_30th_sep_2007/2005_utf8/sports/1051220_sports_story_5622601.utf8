Madrid: Ten-man Osasuna spoiled caretaker coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caros first home game in charge by holding Real Madrid to a 1-1 draw in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

Osasuna had midfielder Francisco Punal sent off after 15 minutes but Real struggled to make the extra man count in a bruising encounter of little quality. 

It could have been even worse for Real after Serbia amp; Montenegro striker Savo Milosevic headed the Navarrans in front in the 76th minute. 

Second-half substitute Roberto Soldado rescued a point for Real six minutes from time. 

Real were jeered off the pitch once again. 

Striker Ronaldo told Canal Plus television: Playing for so long with an extra man it is clear we should have won. 

They pressured us a lot but it was our errors that were the problem. There is still a lot of time left for us in this league to get back to playing good football. 

Osasuna stay second on 35 points, two behind leaders Barcelona, who beat Cadiz 3-1 on Saturday. 

Real are third on 29 points, the same as Villarreal, who came from behind to beat Getafe 2-1 thanks to a sublime free kick from Argentina playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme and a well-worked winner from Uruguay striker Diego Forlan. 

Deportivo Coruna, in fifth, and Valencia, in sixth, also have 29 points. 

The team from Coruna beat Celta Vigo 3-0 on Saturday, while Valencia won 1-0 at Alaves on Sunday courtesy of Raul Albiols early strike. 

Sevilla fought back from 0-2 down to beat nine-man Real Sociedad 3-2, with all their goals coming in the last 14 minutes. 

Sociedad took command through Mikel Labaka and Gaizka Garitano before a double by striker Kepa and one from Frederic Kanoute completed a dramatic recovery by Seville, who are seventh on 26 points. 

Five players were sent off in Racing Santanders 1-1 draw at home to Malaga. Referee Carlos Megia Davila sent off one player in each half for Malaga, and three for Racing after the break. 

Osasuna made it clear they were not about to be pushed about in the Bernabeu with several robust challenges early on. 

Punals arm caught Real defender Roberto Carlos in the face and the Brazilians overreaction contributed to the Osasuna players dismissal. 

The visitors worked hard to deny Real space and put on a tactically astute display. 

Real did not carve a clear chance until the 55th minute when Ronaldos weak shot was cleared off the line by Carlos Cuellar. 

Osasuna looked to have sneaked a winner when a long free-kick from Josetxo eventually found Milosevic, who steered his header past Iker Casillas from close range. 

Guti, though, picked out Zinedine Zidanes run into the area and the Frenchman hooked the ball across goal for Soldado to equalise after 84 minutes. 

Visiting keeper Ricardo then denied Guti and Ivan Helguera in a frantic final few minutes. 

Inter Milan, meanwhile, trimmed Juventus lead in Serie A to eight points with a 4-0 win over Reggina on Sunday. 

The result left Inter in second place in the division with 35 points from 16 matches after Juventus drew 1-1 with Lazio on Saturday. 

Inters city rivals AC Milan moved up one place to third on 34 points after a 4-0 win over Messina. 

Fiorentina dropped to fourth with 33 after being held 1-1 by Tuscan neighbours Empoli. 

Inters players arrived full of confidence after last weekends 3-2 derby win over Milan and wasted little time in sweeping Reggina aside. 

The game was less than two minutes old when Reggina keeper Nicola Pavarini blocked a free kick by midfielder Dejan Stankovic, only for Ivan Cordoba to pounce on the loose ball. 

Inters Brazilian striker Adriano and Stankovic had chances to extend the visitors lead before Obafemi Martins headed their second from a Luis Figo cross in the 15th minute. 

Figo created Inters third just before halftime, scattering Regginas defence with a fine solo run before slipping the ball to Adriano to fire a precise left-footed shot past Pavarini. 

Reggina enjoyed more possession after the interval, but Inter midfielder David Pizarro wrapped up the result with a goal on the break in stoppage time. 

At the San Siro, Milan initially struggled against Messina until an Andriy Shevchenko penalty ? awarded for a dubious Matthew Olorunleke foul on Alberto Gilardino ? gave them the lead midway through the first half.

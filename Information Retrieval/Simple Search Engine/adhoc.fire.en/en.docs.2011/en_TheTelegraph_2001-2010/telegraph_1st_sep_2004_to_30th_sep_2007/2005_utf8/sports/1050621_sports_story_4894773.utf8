 FIA call-up for teams claiming tyre spectre

 Jarno Trulli, who took the pole but didnt start 

London: Michelin teams have been summoned to 

a hearing of Formula Ones ruling body in Paris to explain their part in 

the US Grand Prix tyre fiasco. 

In a statement on Monday, FIA said the hearing would 

take place on June 29. Team chief Frank Williams said the teams had been accused 

of performing acts prejudicial to the interest of the competition. 

Tyre manufacturer Michelin were not summoned but could be invited to appear with the teams ? championship leaders Renault, McLaren, Williams, Toyota, Sauber, Red Bull and BAR. 

Honda-powered BAR already have a suspended sentence hanging over them after being banned for two races earlier in the season. However a FIA spokesman said it would be inappropriate to speculate ahead of the meeting about the possible implications for BAR. 

The seven pulled out before the start in Indianapolis on Sunday because of safety concerns about their tyres. 

FIA rejected their request for a temporary chicane to be installed before the final banked turn to reduce speeds. The six cars that started the race were all on Bridgestone tyres. 

Williams said the seven teams were so desperate to 

race they would have waived their right to score points. The team owner said the 

FIA must share the blame for a fiasco that left irate fans. (Reuters)

 Lee enjoying Ashes battle

Nottingham: Brett Lee said his on-field battle with Andrew Flintoff has been one of the highlights of the most exciting tour Ive been on. 

One of the abiding images of the Ashes encounter so far was when Flintoff, who had pounded Lee with short-pitched deliveries, went up to console him after the Aussies gutsy 43 not out so nearly denied England the two-run win in the second Test. Ive really enjoyed batting and bowling, especially against Andrew, the Australian fast bowler said on Monday.

 Bengal fall for 171 

Mumbai: Mumbai pace bowlers, spearheaded by a five-wicket haul from Swapnil Hazare, shot out Bengal for a meagre 171 in the first innings on the opening day of their four-day Ranji Trophy Elite group A match here Friday. 

Inserted on a seaming, pacy and bouncy Wankhede track by Mumbai skipper Nilesh Kulkarni, the Bengal batsmen never fully recovered from a shaky start of two for two, before being dismissed at tea. 

Hazare grabbed 5 for 36 in 20 overs and was well supported by Usman Malvi (3) and Avishkar Salvi (2). 

Sourasish Lahiri, who batted at No. 3, top-scored with 49. But his dismissal at 107 just before lunch triggered a collapse as Bengal lost their last eight wickets for 64 runs. 

Lahiri, who added 78 runs with Devang Gandhi (30) was fifth out, bowled by Hazare. 

Bengal fought back well when pacer Shib Shankar Paul sent back Mumbai openers Sahil Kukreja and Wasim Jaffer with only 13 on board. 

Mumbai, then, recovered to 50 for two before bad light ended play with 3.5 overs remaining. Vinit Indulkar (17) and Amol Muzumdar (23) were unbeaten at close.

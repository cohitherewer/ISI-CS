 Aussie lessons will come in handy: Inzy

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Tuesday promised a better show during the upcoming tour of India, saying the tough series against Australia had hardened his young teammates. 

?We have learnt a lot from the Australian tour which will help us in more ways than one when we tour India,? Inzamam said here after the team?s return from a long and disappointing tour Down Under. 

Pakistan were swept aside 0-3 in the three-Test series by the Aussies but they managed to win three one-day Internationals in the tri-series to make it to the best-of-three finals, which they lost 0-2. 

Pakistan team will leave for India on February 25, their first tour since 1999, for a three-Test and five-match one-day series. 

Coach Bob Woolmer said if the players did not repeat the mistakes they made in Australia, they could do well against India. 

?I hope the players will capitalise on what they have learnt, and if they do not repeat the mistakes they committed in Australia, they can always do well. Overall the tour was an interesting one because it gave us a chance to pick men from the boys.? 

Inzamam stressed on the need for his bowling line-up to fire against the strong Indian batting line-up. 

?We need a strong bowling line-up and I hope that all our injured bowlers regain their fitness to help us in India. We know India is a tough team in their den because they are a strong batting side and they catch their opposition through their spinners,? he said. 

Pakistan have been struggling in the bowling department with question marks on the fitness and form of strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar, who also faces disciplinary action for contract violation, and Mohammed Sami. 

Quicks Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul have already been ruled out owing to injuries, while Saqlain Mushtaq is still on crutches after undergoing surgery on his knees. 

Defending his team?s poor performance in Australia, Inzamam said the conditions were tough and new to most of his players. 

?You must take into account that 12 of our players were new to those conditions. Three to four players have come to the fore and have matured on this tour.? 

Woolmer also expected his team to fare better on Indian pitches. (PTI)

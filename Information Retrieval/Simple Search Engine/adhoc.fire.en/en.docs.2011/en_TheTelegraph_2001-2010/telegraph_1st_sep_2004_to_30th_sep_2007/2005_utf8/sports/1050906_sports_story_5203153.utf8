The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians build-up positive 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Shane Bond will be back in the New Zealand XI, for Tuesdays tri-series final, but the Indians are looking to be positive and Sourav Ganguly may choose to bat if he wins the toss. 

According to The Telegraphs sources in Harare, the thinktank favours making a statement instead of giving the impression that Bond holds an appreciable psychological advantage. 

The speed merchant had been devastating in Indias opening engagement, late last month. 

Sourav won the toss yesterday and inserted Zimbabwe? If he wins again, chances are that New Zealand wont be invited to set a target, a well-placed source informed late on Monday. 

He added: In any case, the Harare Sports Club wicket was sans moisture this evening? 

Whatever, a positive attitude in the lead-up to a big final is refreshing. 

As expected, the Indians are going to be at full strength. Ashish Nehra and Irfan Pathan will be back and, so, Murali Kartik and Rudra Pratap Singh are going to be out. 

Chances are that Yalaka Venugopal Rao will again be the super sub.

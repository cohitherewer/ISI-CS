The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Concerns still prevail 

New Delhi: Even as BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra confirmed in Calcutta on Sunday that the Kotla would hold the sixth India-Pakistan one-dayer, the suspense continued with the grounds and pitches committee chief Venkat Sundaram saying that there were still some ?concerns? which needed to be addressed. 

Sundaram, who inspected the Kotla for close to three hours, did not say what were the ?concerns? before the committee, but said they would discuss about it before submitting the report to the Board ?shortly?. 

?We have made a number of observations. There are certain areas which are of concern to us. Our team would discuss it before talking to DDCA (Delhi and District Cricket Association) officials. Then we will submit our report to the BCCI,? Sundaram told reporters.

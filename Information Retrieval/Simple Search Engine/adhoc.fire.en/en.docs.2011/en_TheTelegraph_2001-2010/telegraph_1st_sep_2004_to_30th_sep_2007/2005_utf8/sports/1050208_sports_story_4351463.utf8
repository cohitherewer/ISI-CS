 PSG coach may be axed

Paris: Paris St Germain coach Vahid Halilhodzic is in danger of being axed after his side?s 0-2 league defeat at home to Racing Lens at the weekend. 

Club chairman Francis Graille, who has backed Halilhodzic despite a string of disappointing results, said on Sunday that a decision would be taken soon. 

?I?m not going to make up my mind this week,? Graille said. ?The (French Cup) match against Bordeaux on Sunday (February 13) is going to be decisive. If we lose again we will have to make a move. It?s legitimate to be unhappy with what is happening now.? 

PSG fans booed the players on Sunday after a second consecutive defeat, the team having lost 0-2 at Monaco the previous weekend. 

PSG, also eliminated in the first round of the Champions League, have not won a league match since beating Metz 3-0 on December 18. (Reuters)

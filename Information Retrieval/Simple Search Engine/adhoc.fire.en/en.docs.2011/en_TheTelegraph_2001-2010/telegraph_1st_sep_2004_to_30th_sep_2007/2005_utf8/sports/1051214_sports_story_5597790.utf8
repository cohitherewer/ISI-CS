 Fast bowler Jhulan Goswami was felicitated by West Bengal Women?s Cricket Association on Monday, for her brilliant performance in the recently concluded ODI series against England. The association also took the opportunity to announce that they are going to organise the East Zone Junior National Championship in the city from Thursday.

 Four teams Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bengal will take part in the competition. Priyanka Roy will lead the 15-member Bengal team.

 Mohun Bagan coach Jahar Das seems to be impressed by the performance of T Akom Ao of Assam Rifles in the Durand Cup. The club started its search for a new striker after Togolese recruit Gley Yao Rodrigue was shown the door.

 Das feels that Akom can be a replacement for Rodrigue. The final decision will, however, rest with the club officials.

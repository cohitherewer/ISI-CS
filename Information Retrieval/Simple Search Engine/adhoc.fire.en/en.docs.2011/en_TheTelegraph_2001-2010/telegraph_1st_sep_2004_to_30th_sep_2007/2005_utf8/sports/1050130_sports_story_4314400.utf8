 PCB team tight-lipped

Ahmedabad: The two-member security assessment team from Pakistan Saturday inspected the facilities at the Sardar Patel Stadium at the Motera, a proposed venue for the upcoming Indo-Pak series, but remained tight-lipped on its observations. 

Zakir Khan, general manager (cricket operations) of the Pakistan Cricket Board and Sohail Khan, SSP, accompanied by senior police officials and Gujarat Cricket Association members thoroughly inspected the stadium premises, including facility for net practice. 

?We are here to only inspect each and every facility at the stadium, security arrangements and accommodation. We will be submitting a report to the PCB at the earliest which will then decide on the venues,? Zakir Khan said. 

Asked if Ahmedabad?s communal past would be a matter of concern while considering it as a venue, the official said: ?This is not at all an issue as far as we are concerned. We are here to look into cricket related issues.? (PTI)

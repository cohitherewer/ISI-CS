 Just aiming for a finish at Sepang: Narain

 - ?Our true potential will come out after the first seven races? 

 Narain Karthikeyan feels there were ?very few minuses? in his debut 

Chennai: Narain Karthikeyan says his true potential will surface only after the first seven races where he would be aiming the chequered flag. 

Happy with his 15th place finish in the season opener, the 28-year-old says he has made many people sit up and watch him perform. ?I want to establish myself as a good driver. After the first race in Melbourne, a lot of people in the business are recognising that,? Karthikeyan said over phone from Kuala Lumpur, where he will compete in his second F1 race March 20. 

Following are excerpts from an interview: 

Q: It was creditable that you set the best lap 

time for rookies in Melbourne despite a bad start and was behind Tiago Monteiro. 

How were you able to achieve the best lap time? 

A: I had a bad start alright but picked up during the second part of the race and my car worked well enough for me to set the best lap time amongst the rookies. 

Did you rush the limit at any time of the 57-lap race? 

Obviously you were pushing the car to the limit in 

every lap. When the fuel load goes down, you take much part of it and it is advantageous. 

That is the time one tries and gets the best out of the situation. That is how 

the whole thing went. I was quite happy. The only real moment in which I was in 

a dangerous position was when I came in to the pits. I locked all the four wheels 

and the car went a bit side ways on the entry to the pits. 

How do you feel about the complete 2005 season and your prospects? 

Obviously, my aim is to establish myself as a good driver. After the first race in Melbourne, a lot of people are recognising that. I just need to continue the good job. In that way, 2005 is going to be a challenge for me but I am up to it. 

How confident are you to improve from your 15th finish to go up in the order of merit in Sepang? 

I am aiming to finish the race whether it is 15th or 16th places. At this point of time, we are not in an ideal position. When the opportunity comes to score points, we will do that. It is very hard to predict as to when we will get better finishes. I am not going to put pressure on myself. 

Are you going in to the Malaysian leg of the event with the same parameters of your vehicle or have you suggested any changes to your engineers? 

For each race the car will be changed in gear ratio and so on. This is done according to the circuit conditions. Every track has its uniqueness. But the package will be pretty similar and the only main difference will be that we will be using other tyre components in Malaysia because of its hotter conditions and humidity. 

The pundits of Formula One feel that Ferrari went in to the Australian race with its old car and that might have hampered Michael Schumacher?s performance... 

Like us, Ferrari also has the old car adapted to the 2005 specifications. Unfortunately, the other team seems to have gone a little bit ahead of both our team and Ferrari. We will be sticking to the old car for the foreseeable future but the Ferrari will be with the new one in San Marino (fourth race in Imola, France on April 24). 

What were the plus and minuses of your debut race? 

A: The qualifying and my debut race in Melbourne went off very well for me. There were very few minuses in my debut. Other than the start, everything else went perfectly to plan. It was not a bad race at all.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 First day washed out

Wellington: Heavy fog and rain forced the abandonment of the first day?s play in the second Test between New Zealand and Australia at the Basin Reserve on Fri-day. 

Play was called off shortly after the scheduled lunch break. 

Umpires David Shepherd and Rudi Koertzen said play would start half an hour early and finish half an hour late on the remaining four days to help make up for some of the lost time although more rain is forecast over the weekend. 

Australia retained the same team that won the first Test in Christchurch by nine wickets, leaving Brett Lee as 12th man. 

Lee had hoped to return to Australia to play for New South Wales in the domestic first-class final against Queensland in Brisbane but was required to stay with the national side in case anyone was injured before the toss. 

New Zealand retained the same squad that lost in Christchurch but delayed making a decision on their 12th man. 

Off spinner Paul Wiseman was 12th man in the opening test but skipper Stephen Fleming said it was possible he would play at the Basin Reserve.

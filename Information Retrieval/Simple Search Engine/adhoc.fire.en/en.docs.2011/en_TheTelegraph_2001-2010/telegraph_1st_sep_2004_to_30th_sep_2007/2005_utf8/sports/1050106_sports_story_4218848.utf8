 Sunday?s Derby looks very open 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Its not the stamina factor alone that takes the best stayer in the Derby field to the winners enclosure. Demands over the Derby trip far exceed the edurance capability of a potential winner. Fitness is a prime factor, besides bloodlines and speed, a Derby runner is expected to possess.

 A likely field of 10 runners in Sundays mega-event, the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, has different kinds of specialists in the line up. Some of them are yet to be exploited over middle distances and they carry the milers tag. Moon Emperor, Exclusive Affair and Calorific, for instance, have class painted all over them but are they talented enough to prove their mettle beyond a metirc mile? Aperitivo, Formal Invitation, Star Angel and Star Emblem, on the other hand, have done fairly well over middle distances but lack the speed of their counterparts who have done exceedingly well over shorter Classics.

 A mile and a half-trip has its own compulsions. For a Derby winner, most in the racing circles look for a horse whose bloodlines and performance boast of a proper blend of speed and stamina. Some of the best performed horses may not fit into the scheme of things, yet they seem to be a strong contenders to land the Derby crown. Moon Emperor, a Placerville-Menorah son, is bound to stay the Derby Trip. He is a stayer from either side of his parents. 

 Equally comfortable over the Derby trip will be Aperitivo who was taken by a surprise by Moon Emperor in the 1,600m Guineas. The verdict between the two was a mere length and the extra 800m may change the equation. Then there is Star Angel, the double classic winner this season. She may not have beaten a classy opposition in the 1,000 Guineas and the 2,400m Oaks. Her style of victory was, however, impressive. Finally, Exclusive Affairs and Formal Invitations are no pushovers. The former is improving with each run while Formal Invitation is still to produce his best. Make no mistake, each one is a champion in his own right. 

 It is going to be a very open Derby.

 Frank Warren said he would now act as the youngster?s promoter and manager in the professional ranks. ?That will be Khan?s last amateur fight,? Warren said. ?He?s beaten the No.1, the two-time Olympic champion, the three times world amateur champion. What else can you do after that? You can only go for new challenges. He will make his professional debut in July,? added Warren, who predicted Khan could be world champion by the time he is 21.

 Benfica, who have the advantage of a better record in head-to-heads with Sporting, travel to Boavista in the final round of games.

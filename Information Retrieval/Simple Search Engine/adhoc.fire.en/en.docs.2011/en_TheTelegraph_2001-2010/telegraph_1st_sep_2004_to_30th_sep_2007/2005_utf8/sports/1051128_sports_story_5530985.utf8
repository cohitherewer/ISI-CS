 To Best, it was a Wonderful World

 - Drink was the other woman in his marriages 

Roy Collins

When George Best regained consciousness after his liver transplant in 2002, the first thing he heard was Louis Armstrong singing What A Wonderful World on his bedside radio. Without opening his eyes, he waved an arm from his bed as though conducting an orchestra and a small smile formed on his lips. 

It was not just one of his favourite songs but practically his life anthem. 

Even in his darkest hours, even when spending Christmas 1984 slopping out in Pentonville jail after his conviction for assaulting a police officer, or during his long incarcerations in hospital, the world was wonderful to Best, the glass always half full, to use a fitting analogy. Even in the gutter after another drunken two-day session, he was always looking at the stars and for all the critical voices, he never blamed anyone else for the predicaments he continually brought upon himself. 

Like all alcoholics, however, Best also suffered from chronic depression. So writing his life story, Blessed-The Autobiography, in 2001 was a both joyous and draining experience. 

The move to Ireland, close to his dad, Dickie, and sisters, Carol and Barbara, was another of Georges hopelessly romantic, idealistic but inevitably doomed notions. In reality, it proved too cold for him, in his weakened state, and too dull for second wife Alex, from whom he was divorced earlier this year. 

But when he returned to England 18 months later, it seemed that he might finally achieve his ambition of a happy, fulfilled life without the bottle. He had the roses-round-the-door cottage in the Surrey countryside, a devoted young wife, his two red setter dogs gambolling in the garden and there was even talk of starting a family. 

He told me at the time: For the first time in my life, I dont want to drink. It has been a fantastic year, weve moved to our dream house, work has been pouring in and it cant be a coincidence that Ive been dry all that time. 

This was in marked contrast to his attitude two years earlier when he confided that the only thing that sustained him during his operation for a diseased liver in the Cromwell Hospital ? even when seriously ill, attached to a drip and wondering whether he would make it through the night ? was the thought of raising a glass again. If he had been certain that he would never be able to drink again, he said, he would have pulled out all the tubes keeping him alive and wandered out into the night to drink himself to death. 

 Alex had been more full-time carer than wife, George more patient than husband. Once he recovered fully from the liver transplant, the dynamic of their marriage changed and being the character he is, and enslaved to alcoholism, once George felt like his old self again, he could not resist one more go at living like that, giving himself one more turn on the familiar carousel of booze and women. 

Drink was the other woman in both his marriages and Alex constantly forgave him when he disappeared on two or three-day benders or found his secret supplies around the house. So, effectively, was any hope of him ever beating his battle with the booze, the one opponent he could never beat, as he drifted from lover to lover.

 Indian eves go one-up vs Pak

Karachi: Diana David stroked an unbeaten half-century to steer the Indian womens team to a comfortable 33-run victory over their Pakistani counterparts in the first one-dayer of the four-match series in Lahore on Wednesday. 

David struck seven boundaries in a 66-ball 58 while Szweya Rohitas chipped in with a useful 23 that allowed India to reach 168 for five in their allotted 40 overs. 

The home side was never in the hunt for the target and were dismissed for 135 in 38.4 overs. Shamsa Hashmi scored 30 and Arman Khan scored 29 for the hosts. 

For the visitors, Rumeli Ghat and Niranjana Nagarajan bagged two wickets each. Diana was adjudged player of the match.

 England prepared to get physical

 - Rain plays spoilsport in teams last meeting before Saturdays final

Anyone doubting there would be needle in Tuesdays match, after both these sides qualified for Saturdays NatWest Series final, would have been quickly disabused once play got underway. Verbals, physical confrontations and another muscular innings from Andrew Symonds, as Australia scored 261 for nine, all made for a thrilling encounter. Hostilities were halted, though, by a deluge with England only three overs into their reply. 

As in the match at Durham, Symonds looked in consummate control. In fact, a hundred looked a nailed-on certainty until he was run out following a mix-up with Michael Hussey, though not before the latter had walked off believing he was out. 

Husseys inexperience at working with the tail meant only 37 runs were added as Englands death bowlers reined them in. 

The most successful was Darren Gough, who took three late wickets, though under the new substitute rules due to be introduced to all one-day cricket after July 30, he may well have been substituted after his first two overs with the new ball cost 23 runs. 

Emotions always run high when England play Australia, but the antics at Edgbaston suggest one side no longer sees itself as the unequal partner. But believing you are an equal and performing like one is the challenge that faces England for the remainder of the summer. 

The edgy mood was set when Matthew Hayden squared up to Simon Jones, after the fast bowler had struck him on the chest following a wild throw at the stumps. Jones had fielded the ball off his own bowling and in the kind of aggressive gesture beloved of quick bowlers everywhere, had flung the ball back towards the stumps, something Hayden did not take kindly to given that they were some way from where the ball struck him. 

An exchange of views followed despite Jones holding up a hand in apology. Hayden, who possesses both the build and bravado to take on all-comers, appeared to get even more agitated once others, most notably Paul Collingwood, weighed in with the verbals. Eventually the umpires stepped in to calm matters down and warned the captains about the need to control their players. 

In the past, Englands players would have been ruffled by such an incident, but in his first game against Australia since shredding his knee ligaments in the Brisbane Test two-and-a-half years ago, Jones emerged the stronger, removing Hayden two overs later. 

As he as done all series, Harmison has bowled with menace and rhythm, a combination that was rewarded on Tuesday with the wickets of Hussey and Damien Martyn, though the latter required more than the rub of the green. 

Battings cool operator, Martyn, was playing well when he slashed Harmison high to Kevin Pietersen at third man. Running in hard there was no doubt that Pietersen made the catch, but in tumbling to ground, TV replays suggested the ball brushed the grass, in which case Martyn was right in standing his ground.

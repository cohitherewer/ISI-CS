 ?Sergeant? may strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Only 40 horses are out to contest Wednesday?s seven events ? at a poor average of a shade over five runners a race. Still the card may manage to throw up a surprise or two.

The feature event, the 1,200m Goodfellas Cup, looks 

to be a teaser with Ever Lasting Love yet to produce her best form and Karan?s 

Choice letting down more often than justifying her odds. It leaves one to bank 

upon Sergeant Slipper whose last win was quite impressive. The Errol Bhungard-trainee 

may also capatilise on apprentice jockey Melvyn Maseyk?s 5-kg riding allowance 

to nullify the penalty he earned for his recent victory.

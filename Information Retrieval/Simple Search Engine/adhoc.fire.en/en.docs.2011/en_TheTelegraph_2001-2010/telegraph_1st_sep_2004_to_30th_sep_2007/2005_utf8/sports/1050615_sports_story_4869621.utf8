 Woods looking to match Sorenstam

 - Sergio Garcia could pose a tough challenge to the American

When Tiger Woods, who is among the favourites to win this weeks US Open at Pinehurst, captured the Masters in April, he sent a text to his friend and practice companion, Annika Sorenstam, to remind her that he had nine majors to her eight. 

On Sunday, after Sorenstam had won the LPGA Championship at Bulle Rock in Maryland, she wasted no time in switching on her mobile. Im going to text Tiger right now, she said. She thought that one word would suffice: Nine! 

In terms of what these remarkable golfers have done this year, Sorenstam is ahead of Woods in that she has two majors under her belt to Woods one. Now she is looking ahead to next weeks US Womens Open at Cherry Hills, Colorado, and the third leg of the so-called Grand Slam of all four majors in one season. 

Royal Birkdale, which hosts the Weetabix British Womens Open from July 28-31, is the course where, if things were to go right for her at Cherry Hills, she could achieve her ultimate ambition in completing the set. 

Woods is hoping to match Sorenstams two out of two this week ? and were he to succeed here, the third stop is St Andrews and the fourth the US PGA at Baltusrol from August 11-14. 

Though Woods completed what became known as the Tiger Slam when he had all four major trophies on his mantelpiece at the one time across 2000 and 2001, he has not won a Grand Slam. In 2002, he bagged the Masters and the US Open, only to finish in a share of 28th place in the Open at Muirfield. 

In 1999, when Payne Stewart had so memorable a victory at Pinehurst, Woods tied for third. One of the reasons Jack Nicklaus thinks he will win this time is that Pinehurst offers a bit of space. People rightly associate Pinehurst with pines, and plenty of them, but as Nicklaus says they frame the holes rather more than they come into play. 

Butch Harmon, on the other hand, can picture Woods tangling with the trees. I think Tiger will run away with the Open at St Andrews because he can hit the ball anywhere but hes not my favourite here, the players old coach said. 

Harmon has mentioned Luke Donald as one whose game should suit these tight fairways. Short of the trees, there is the Pinehurst rough ? four inches of it in which, as Todd Hamilton has been saying, the ball sinks to the bottom every time. 

Woods, with his great strength, should escape from it more readily than most, but there will be occasions when even he can do no more than hack the ball out. 

Sergio Garcia could be hanging on to Woods coat tails this week no less doggedly than he did in the 1999 US PGA Championship at Medinah, where he finished second behind the American. 

Like Woods, the Spaniard has the feel to manufacture shots to the upturned saucers that are the Pinehurst putting surfaces. 

Last month Garcia blew a six-stroke lead to lose the Wachovia Championship, but on Sunday he recaptured his confidence with a two-shot win in the Booz Allen Classic. Extraordinarily, three of Garcias six American Tour wins have come on the eve of the US Open. In the knowledge that no one has won the US Open after winning the week before, Garcia said, feelingly, that he just wished they would play the major a week earlier. 

Last year, when Retief Goosen won at Shinnecock Hills, the United States Golf Association would not countenance the suggestion that they had allowed some of the greens to get out of hand. 

Indeed, to Ernie Els fury, they even went so far as to claim that the reason the South African had shot an 80 was because he had not tried. 

Twelve months on David Fay, the USGAs executive director, is admitting that they got it wrong. 

The US Open has traditionally been regarded as the worlds toughest golf tournament, he said. 

We try to get close to that mythical edge, where the golf course is difficult but still playable, but last year we went over that edge.

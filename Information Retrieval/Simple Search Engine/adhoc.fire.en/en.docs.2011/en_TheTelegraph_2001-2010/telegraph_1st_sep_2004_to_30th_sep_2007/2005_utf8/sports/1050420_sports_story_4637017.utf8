Lehmann ignored

Sydney: Australian selectors Tuesday dashed any faint hopes batsman Darren Lehmann held of regaining a spot in the national side when they axed the player along with five others from the new contract list for the 2005-06 season. 

Selectors opted to bring fresh faces into the 25-man group of contracted players, which forms the core of Australia?s Test and one-day squads. 

They axed ageing fringe players are Martin Love, Ian Harvey, Matthew Elliott, Jimmy Maher and Brad Williams, who had failed to pressure the incumbent starting line up. 

Instead, selectors opted for Victorian allrounder Cameron White, 21, South Australian off-spinner Daniel Cullen, 21, Queensland allrounder James Hopes, 26, NSW wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, 27, and Victorian quick Michael Lewis, 30. 

Lehmann, 35, was the highest-profile casualty, with chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns confirming that his international career is over after 27 Tests (1798 runs at 44.95).

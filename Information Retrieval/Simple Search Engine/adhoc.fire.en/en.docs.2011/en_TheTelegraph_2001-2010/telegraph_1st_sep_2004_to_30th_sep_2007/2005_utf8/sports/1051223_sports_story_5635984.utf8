 Indo-Pak series from Feb. 15

Karachi: India and Pakistan hockey teams will play a six-match Test series between February 15-?25, with both the countries hosting three matches each. 

The Pakistan Hockey Federation secretary Musarratullah Khan said on Thursday that India would host the first three games while the Pakistan-leg matches will be played between February 21?25. 

The series was finalised when I met Indian hockey officials during the Champions Trophy and it has been slotted keeping in mind that Pakistan has to participate in Commonwealth Games in March-April while India and Pakistan would have organised their national events before the series, Musarratullah said. 

Although most of the cities might feel deprived to watch the two teams in action, but we have preferred for minimum travelling and hosting matches in the shortest possible time frame, he added. 

Schedule: 

February15 ? First Test in Jalandhar/Amritsar. 

 February17 ? Second Test in Chandigarh. 

 February 19 ? Third Test in New Delhi. 

 February 21 ? Fourth Test in Rawalpindi. 

 February 23 ? Fifth Test in Faisalabad.

 HONKY DORY

 Fargeat

 Starynsky and California are expected to fight out the issue in the 1,200m Kailashpat Singhania Trophy, the main event in Wednesday?s race-card. However, California is better suited to the 1,200m sprint and the Sohrab Jilla-trained filly, by Brave Hunter out of Look, may triumph in the hands of Samuel Fargeat.

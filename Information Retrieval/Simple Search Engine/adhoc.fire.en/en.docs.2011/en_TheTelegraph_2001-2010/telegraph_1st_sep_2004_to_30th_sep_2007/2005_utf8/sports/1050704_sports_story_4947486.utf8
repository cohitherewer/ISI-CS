 Sprints still scare Armstrong

Les Essarts: Six-time champion Lance Armstrong has finished more than 150 Tour de France stages in his career but he is still frightened when the pace increases and sprinters gear up for the final dash to the line. 

Those finishes still scare me, said Armstrong, who witnessed another such stage ending in Les Essarts on Sunday. 

The American, who is bidding for an unprecedented seventh Tour victory, knows the worlds leading cycling race is easier to lose in the first week in a crash than to win in the mountains. 

In 2003, he was involved in a massive pile-up in the second stage and had a big scare but his Discovery Channel teammates did a fine job of keeping him out of trouble on Sunday. 

Armstrong finished 63rd in the same time as stage winner Tom Boonen but there was little time for sightseeing. 

Armstrong is second overall, two seconds behind compatriot and former teammate David Zabriskie having tamed his main opponents, including Germanys Jan Ullrich, in Saturdays time trial. 

But the Texan has not written off the threat Ullrich poses despite the 1997 Tour winners poor performance in the prologue.

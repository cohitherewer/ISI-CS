The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hosts took the flexibility theory to 

 dangerous level

Straight Talk 

Arjuna Ranatunga

 Three key men did not play for 

 India. Sachin Tendulkar, Irfan Pathan and Harbhajan Singh 

 have been half of the team in this series. It took the flexibility 

 theory to dangerous terrain. To aim for XI faceless men 

 in team is all right but it was akin to pushing an automobile 

 onto the road without gas. Besides, it appeared cocky.

 On paper, India can defend these 

 changes. Gautam Ghambir had a terrific century, Rudra Pratap 

 Singh kicked up bounce on a docile surface with his high-arm 

 action and Sreesanth is naturally accurate. But how do you 

 measure psychology in sport? I believe the Indians went 

 into the game thinking only a 300-plus total could save 

 them.

 They were aware this was their 

 lightest bowling attack in years and batsmen needed to cover 

 up for them. It led to a mad scramble of the final overs. 

 Batsmen were rushed and India lost out on 20-25 extra runs.

 As for Sri Lanka, they have now 

 seen an opening. The batsmen, but for Sanath Jayasuriya, 

 have found their feet. It could have critical bearing when 

 they return for the Tests.

 Sri Lanka surely want to go with 

 a 4-3 scoreline. Its possible, since I believe India 

 will not abandon its experiments. If they do, they would 

 look confused and weak. Besides, what do you tell these 

 young men for resting them in the next match?

 Gambhir, for instance, just cannot 

 be put on the bench. When ushered into the party, he made 

 sure he did not go unnoticed. Hes explosive but thats 

 beside the point. He knew the selectors could drop him to 

 include Kaif for the final two games. He saw the booty and 

 grabbed a fistful. He would now get the final two games 

 maybe its Virender Sehwag who can handle his one-day 

 blues from the sidelines.

 Ironically, India was still better 

 than Sri Lanka in one respect, and it was because of these 

 youngsters. I have never seen a better Indian fielding side 

 than the one we witnessed on Sunday.

 Just count the number of times 

 the boys hit the stumps. Suresh Raina was just not swooping 

 on the ball for effect, he was also gathering it cleanly 

 and throwing precisely.

 Dravid has been a shining presence in 

 the game

I know the difference for I have 

 seen some really, really average Indian fielding sides. 

 For sometime India had Mohammed Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja, 

 then Robin Singh. Over the last few years, Yuvraj Singh 

 and Kaif have spanned the entire spectrum of their fielding 

 prowess. Now they have this Generation Next.

 I have also never seen a more 

 disciplined Indian bowling attack than the one seen in this 

 series. If Ajit Agarkar, with a reputation of being profligate, 

 can be precise, you need to doff your hat.

 Both Sreesanth and R.P. Singh 

 gave nothing away. They did not experiment and bowled on 

 one side of the wicket. They tried to exert pressure from 

 both ends and thats what bowling combinations should 

 always strive for in this wonderful game. Cricket can be 

 simple in its nuances but like all things simple, it doesnt 

 come easy.

 Its also time we start speaking 

 about Rahul Dravid, for the genial Indian skipper is modest 

 to a fault. He gets less attention than say a Kevin Pieterson 

 or a Brian Lara only because in the eye of the media, he 

 is less flamboyant. 

 But his has been a shining presence 

 in the game and we need to acknowledge it every time he 

 scores a hundred like this one.

 Such men are remarkable, who after 

 a decade of cricket, do not lose even an ounce of passion. 

 He has a maniac devotion to his craft but nearly always 

 approaches it with humility. He has to be an inspiration 

 in the dressing room as he must be to thousands who flock 

 Indian maidans.

 Sri Lanka now need a Jayasuriya, 

 Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan to leave an impact 

 on the Indians. It would come handy in Tests next month. 

 They are world class competitors and their countless fans 

 back home are hoping their prayers are answered. It would 

 also restore the imbalance between the two sides. 

 India have let the cat out of 

 the bag and I suspect it hasnt been a very bright 

 move.

 It sure is going to provide a 

 stirring finish to the series.

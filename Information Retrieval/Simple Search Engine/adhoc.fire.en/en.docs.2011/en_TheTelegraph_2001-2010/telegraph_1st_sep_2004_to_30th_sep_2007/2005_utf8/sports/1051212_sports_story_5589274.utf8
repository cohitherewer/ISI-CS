 Sandeep inspires 3-2 win over Pak

 Sandeep Singh scored a brace 

Chennai: A stunning late resurgence saw India shock Pakistan 3-2 in a heart-stopping Champions Trophy hockey encounter between the arch-rivals at the Radhakrishna Stadium here Sunday. 

It was a brace by young drag-flicker Sandeep Singh in the dying minutes which earned the Indians, who have never won the contest, a memorable win over the in-form Pakistanis. 

Down 0-2 at one stage, India fought back nicely to pump in three goals in the last 10 minutes of the match to earn three crucial points and keep alive their hopes for a finish in the medal bracket. 

Young striker Tushar Khandekar scored the first goal for India in the 60th minute of the match, followed by two power-packed drag-flicks by Sandeep in the 61st and 66th minutes to get the better of Pakistan. The visitors were leading by two goals scored off the sticks of Mohammed Imran (53rd minute) and Tariq Aziz (57th). 

The hosts were a completely different side after their lacklustre performance on Saturday. Right from the start, they went on the offensive and succeeded in creating several chances. 

The Indian defence, led by Ignace Tirkey, put behind their pathetic display against Spain on Saturday and made amends coming up with stunning interceptions while the linkmen spearheaded by Viren Rasquinha did well to make intelligent moves. 

On the other hand, the Pakistanis struggled to get going as their star striker Rehan Butt was out of colour failing to put Indian custodian Adrian DSouza under pressure in the first half. 

Mohammed Imran drew the first blood in the second half for Pakistan by converting a penalty corner in the 53rd minute. 

Four minutes later Tariq Aziz extended the lead by deflecting a nice move created by striker Muddasar Ali Khan. 

The Indians did not lose nerves and took some drastic steps to make a comeback. They replaced goalkeeper Adrian DSouza, who was not at his best, and stepped up the counter-attack. 

It paid dividend as Khandekar coming in from the left latched on to a pass and struck a spectacular goal to bring down the margin. 

This suddenly electrified the atmosphere and Kanwalpreet trapped a scoop by Pakistan captain Saqlain Mohammed and Fed Ravipal, whose run fetched a penalty corner. 

Sandeep gave his best to convert the short corner through a power-packed drag-flick that stunned the Pakistan defenders. 

 Soon after, India managed to get another penalty corner and a spirited Sandeep sounded the board in style as the ball went like a bullet between the legs of Pakistan goalie Salman Akbar to give India the winning goal. 

In another match, Germany held The Netherlands to a 2-2 draw. 

The Dutch took a 2-0 lead through Roderick Weusthof (15th and 46th minutes). But the Germans staged a late charge with Christopher Zeller and Matthias Witthaus scoring in the 63rd and 66th to avert another loss after their 1-4 defeat to Australia on Saturday. 

Earlier, seven-time champions Australia recovered in time to defeat holders Spain 4-2 and register their second straight victory. (PTI)

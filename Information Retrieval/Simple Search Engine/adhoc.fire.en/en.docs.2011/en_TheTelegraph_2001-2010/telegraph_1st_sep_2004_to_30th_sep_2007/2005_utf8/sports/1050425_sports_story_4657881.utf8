The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Musah to play vs Sporting 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Tollygunge have refrained from taking any drastic action against Suley Musah and instead, will field the Ghanaian against Sporting Clube de Goa in their Round XIX clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. 

According to the Tollygunge Club secretary Mantoo Ghosh, Musah has a thigh injury, but ?the presence of only 15-16 players? on the roster will see him start in the match. 

?We?re not satisfied with his (Musah?s) answer to our showcause letter. We?ll seek some more clarification. But since we?ve very limited options against Sporting, he?ll play tomorrow,? the official added. 

Tollygunge are likely to play with two stoppers amp; a sweeper. Sporting?s foreign duo ? Dudu Omagbemi and Chidi Edeh ? will also be under close vigil. Sporting, meanwhile, will obviously aim for full points to wrest back the lead from East Bengal. 

Sporting are on 38 points while Tollygunge are almost certain to be relegated having so far managed only 15 points.

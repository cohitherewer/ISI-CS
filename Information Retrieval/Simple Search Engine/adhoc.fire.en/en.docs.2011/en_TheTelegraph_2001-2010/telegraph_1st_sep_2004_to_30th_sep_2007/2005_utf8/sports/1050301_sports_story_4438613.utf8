Milan: AC Milan beat Inter 1-0 in the Milan derby on Sunday to stay level with Juventus at the top of Serie A and inflict their city rivals? first defeat of the season. 

A late strike from Brazilian Kaka ended Inter?s 38-match unbeaten run in all competitions to leave Roberto Mancini?s side 14 points adrift of the leaders in fourth place, behind Sampdoria who won 1-0 at Brescia on Saturday. 

Juventus were inspired by Alessandro Del Piero, who scored twice in their 3-0 win over Siena at the Delle Alpi stadium to ensure they remained neck and neck with the champions. 

AS Roma, without the suspended Francesco Totti, slipped to a 0-2 loss at Palermo, and Lazio enjoyed a 2-0 home victory over Parma. 

A 78,000 crowd at the San Siro saw little in the way of chances before Kaka struck in the 74th minute, and Inter will feel they deserved a point. 

The decisive moment came when Inter could only clear a corner as far as Gennaro Gattuso and the Milan midfielder?s well-struck low drive was turned in by Kaka. 

In Spain, newly appointed Valencia coach Antonio Lopez got off to a winning start when his side fought their way back from a goal down to claim their first success in seven outings with a classy 2-1 victory over Real Betis on Sunday. 

Last season?s top scorer Mista notched the winner 18 minutes from time when he put the final touch to a beautifully fashioned move by coolly slotting the ball past Betis ?keeper Toni Doblas. The win lifted Valencia into fourth in the table, level with Betis and Espanyol. 

Malaga continued their impressive revival with a 6-1 crushing of nine-man Osasuna, who have now gone eight games without a win. 

Middlesbrough grabbed a late 2-2 draw with Charlton Athletic in the Premier League on Sunday but missed the chance to move above Liverpool into fifth place. Earlier, Bolton Wanderers? seven-match unbeaten league run came to an end at Newcastle United when they lost 1-2. (Reuters)

 Pal, Banerjee nominees

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Jagmohan Dalmiya-led ruling faction sprung a surprise by nominating Kumartulis Saradindu Pal as a candidate for the CAB joint secretarys post on Monday. 

The annual general meeting, to be held on July 27, will see a contest after former city Police Commissioner and Director General of state police Dinesh Vajpai decided to oppose Dalmiyas candidature as president. 

Amitava Banerjee will be the other nominee for the joint secretarys office from the ruling faction, while the opposition has only decided on Samar Paul for the post. The other candidate will be chosen between Swapan Mukherjee and Prodyut Bose before the filing of nominations on Tuesday.

 WI aim to shake off rust

Melbourne: The West Indies emerge from a three-month lay-off following their Champions Trophy heroics with a day-night match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) Wednesday. 

The tourists will have two more one-dayers this weekend in Hobart before their opening triangular series match on January 14 against Australia at the MCG. 

Champions Trophy hero Ian Bradshaw said the team will have to take the first three practice games seriously. (AFP)

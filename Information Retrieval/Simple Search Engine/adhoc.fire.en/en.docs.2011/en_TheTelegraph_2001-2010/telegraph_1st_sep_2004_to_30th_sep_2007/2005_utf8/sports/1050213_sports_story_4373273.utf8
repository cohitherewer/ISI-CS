 Pathan advised to skip opener

Mumbai: Left arm seamer Irfan Pathan has been advised not to play in West Zone?s Duleep Trophy opener against North in Lucknow from February 15 to 18 by Team India?s new physio John Gloster. 

?Gloster has advised Pathan to rest his side strain so that he will be fully fit for the series against Pakistan,? Mumbai Cricket Association joint secretary Prof. Ratnakar Shetty said here on Saturday. 

?However, Pathan is free to take part in the next match,? Shetty added. 

?Ajit Agarkar will lead the West Zone as the first-choice skipper and leg spinner Sairaj Bahutule failed to clear the fitness test,? Shetty said. (PTI)

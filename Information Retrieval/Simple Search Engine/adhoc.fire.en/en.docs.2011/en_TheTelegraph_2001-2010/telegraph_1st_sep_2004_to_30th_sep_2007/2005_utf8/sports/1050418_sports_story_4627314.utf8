 Dublin: It took 10 years and a spell in prison, but rogue trader Nick Leeson ? the man who broke Barings Bank ? has finally found a new home for his financial skills: an Irish football club.

 Ireland?s Galway United have appointed Leeson as their new commercial manager despite a CV that many companies may find more than a little off-putting.

 The world?s most famous rogue trader single-handedly ran up ?791 million in trading losses at Barings, the UK?s oldest investment bank.

 The job at the first division club will be Leeson?s first since he left Barings, who collapsed as a result of his losses. 

 Sydney: Birmingham City?s Trinidad and Tobago striker Dwight Yorke has signed to play for Sydney in the new Australian A-League, which kicks off in August.

 Sydney chief executive Andy Harper said on Sunday that the 33-year-old former Manchester United forward had agreed terms with his club, but would not reveal how much the player would be paid.

 ?Suffice to say that he?s come here for a lot less money than he could have made in the Middle East, and I think that speaks volumes for exactly what he wants to achieve out of this move,? Harper said. 

 Kingston: Peter Cargill, a member of Jamaica?s 1998 World Cup side, died in an automobile accident in St Ann parish, police said.

 Cargill, 41, received severe injuries when the mini van in which he was travelling, left the road and struck a boulder head-on on Saturday.

 Cargill was travelling to Montego Bay where Waterhouse, the team he coached, was scheduled to play a match.

 The driver of the van, Hugh Blair, another former Jamaica player, sustained minor injuries and was hospitalised. 

 New Delhi: Indian challenge in the Dutch Open badminton championship came to a tame end when Arvind Bhat and Thomas Kurian went down against higher ranked opponents in the quarter finals at Wateringen, Holland.

 Bhat, who had upset seventh seed Jan Frohlich of Czech Republic in the last round, could not continue the momentum and went down to Rasmus Wengberg of Sweden 6-15, 15-4, 15-5 while qualifier Kurian lost to Arif Rasidi of France 7-15, 7-15 on Saturday. 

 Charleston: Former world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne reached the final of the Family Circle Cup with a 7-6, 7-5 win over 17-year-old Tatiana Golovin of France on Saturday.

 In only her second tournament after more than six months out through illness and injury, the Belgian won a high-quality encounter to set up a showdown with second-seeded Russian Elena Dementieva, who beat Swiss Patty Schnyder 3-6, 6-4, 6-0.

 Cuttack: Goa defeated Delhi to win the title in both the boys? and girls? sections of the 15th sub-junior national baseball championship at the Barabati Stadium here on Sunday.

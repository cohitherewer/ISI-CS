 Anand survives Topalov scare

 - WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 

 Topalov is in joint lead 

 with Anand

San Luis (Argentina): Viswanathan Anand had a miraculous escape as he came back from the jaws of defeat a couple of times before sharing honours with Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the second round of the World Chess Championship here on Thursday. 

After a brilliant first round victory over Hungarian Judit Polgar, the Indian ace appeared out of sorts in the final stages of the game as he first blew away an easy draw, came back, blundered again and eventually clawed back once more to salvage an important half point. 

With draws being the order of the day, Topalov and Anand remained in joint lead after the second round with 1.5 points apiece. 

With twelve rounds still remaining in the (eight-player) double round robin event, defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan, Russain duo Peter Svidler and Alexander Morozevich, and Englands Michael Adams are joint third in the standings on a 50 per cent score. 

Hungarians Peter Leko and Judit Polgar are currently at the bottom of the table with just a half point from their two games. 

Topalov could not quite get the similar rhythm this time around as Anand came out better prepared and had only a slightly inferior position after the middle game. 

The World No.2 was in a soup after move 46 when he missed out on a simple queen manoeuvre that led to a clearly won endgame for Topalov. The Bulgarian played accurately thereafter to net a couple of pawns and just while every one thought it was all over, Topalov returned the favour to give Anand an opportunity to hold the game. 

However, after securing a dead drawn position, Anand added to his woes once more by another weak move on his 75th turn and that again gave Topalov some winning hopes. 

Eventually, through perpetual checks, this amazing game of tactics, technique and inaccuracies finished. The marathon lasted exactly 7 hours in which 97 moves were played before the peace agreement. 

While Anand and Topalov played the longest game of the day, Leko and Morozevich were also not far behind in using most of their allotted time. Playing black, Morozevich was in fact seen pressing for some initiative in this keenly contested game towards the end but Lekos defences and counter active measures proved adequate to force a draw. 

Leko employed the in-vogue English attack against the Sicilian Nazdorf and got the Kingside attack rolling early in the middle game. 

After the first time control, both players still had many pieces on board with Leko trying to find a break through, but yet again Morozevich transposed a queen and minor piece endgame. 

Leko had no chance to force matters. The draw was a just result after 68 moves. 

Kasimdzhanov stuck with the basics for the second day running and had a smooth draw with Peter Svidler. 

Playing the white side of another English attack of the day, Kasimdzhanov did not find any advantage following cautious play by Svidler and the truce was signed in just 24 moves. 

Judit was also caution personified in her duel against Michael Adams, even though she survived more than a few anxious moments before finally splitting the point. 

It was a Taimanov Sicilian where Adams, white, got an opening advantage with a relatively new plan and tried hard to convert it into a full point. 

Polgar, meanwhile also had her task cut out in the middle game as she worked on her defences quite well and exchanges at regular intervals helped the worlds best woman player to steer the game to a draw after 48 moves.

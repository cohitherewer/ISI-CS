Calcutta: As East Bengal begin their AFC Cup campaign against Muktijoddha Sansad on Wednesday, the prevailing milieu at home significantly hangs around last year?s performance and the absence of two of its chief characters. 

Cristiano Junior is no more, while the possibilities of Mike Okoro returning to the fold, despite coach Subhas Bhowmick?s earnest wish, have never quite fructified. Plus, Douglas da Silva?s fractured right shin bone has made the scenario murkier. 

But this is international stage after all, and one player is always keen to thrive on it. For Bhaichung Bhutia, the difference between the now and then exists, but the team as a unit is determined to improve upon last year?s show. 

?Yes, it?s true that there?s no Junior or Okoro this time around. Douglas? absence is also vital,? Bhutia said at the club ground before the squad left for a residential camp at a Salt Lake hotel on Monday. 

The national captain, however, sounded confident that East Bengal are capable to kick off the meet with a win. 

He didn?t say it in as many words but going by the camp?s mood, a ?a big-margin win? is very much on the thinktank?s agenda. 

The Bangladesh Federation Cup champions, however, are awfully short on match practice. 

Since finishing the National League as runners-up at home and a disappointing performance in the IFA Shield here October last, they?ve not played any tournament. The match against East Bengal will be their first in the new season. 

Coach Safiqul Islam Manik agreed that such lack of competitive edge would put his team at a disadvantage. 

?It would?ve certainly been better for us had we come here after playing a tournament,? Manik said after a two-hour practice session at the East Bengal ground. 

The team, which arrived Monday, has as many as eight national team players. Besides, there?s two foreigners ? Charles Hansa Benin of Ghana and Habimana Hary of Rwanda ? both defenders.

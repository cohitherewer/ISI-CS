 Bridgetown: West Indies Cricket Board president Ken Gordon was named chairman of the 2007 World Cup organising committee.

 Gordon replaced Rawle Brancker, a businessman and former West Indies cricketer who resigned a week ago, along with other members of the committee. Brancker had held the position since 2003. The board said it would name other committee members shortly. 

 Marrakech: Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida has been suspended indefinitely by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) for getting the penalty law wrong during a World Cup qualifier last week.

 Mohamed Bin Hammam, president of the AFC said: ?His name has been removed from the elite list of Asian referees and he has been suspended from officiating at any further matches.?

 The incident occurred during last Saturday?s Asian World Cup qualifying play-off first leg between Uzbekistan and Bahrain in Tashkent. 

 Kuala Lumpur: The Asian Football Confederation has unanimously ratified Australia as its 46th member and it will be able to take part in AFC tournaments from January 1 next year, officials said on Sunday.

 AFC president Mohamed bin Hammam said the decision was made on Saturday in Marrakech during the AFC?s extraordinary congress.

 Australia has sought to leave the Oceania Football Confederation to join the AFC in the hope of making it easier to qualify for the World Cup.

 Paris: France fear they might miss both Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry when they face Switzerland in a World Cup qualifier next month.

 Playmaker Zidane faces a struggle to be fit in time for the game in Berne on October 8.

 Zidane was substituted with a groin strain in a 1-0 victory over Ireland on Wednesday in Dublin.

 Henry, who scored the winner at Lansdowne Road, is suffering from a recurrent groin injury and missed Arsenal?s 1-2 defeat away to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said his captain would also miss the Champions League game on Wednesday. 

 Frankfurt: Franz Beckenbauer, a man long known simply as the Kaiser, was additionally hailed as an icon, an ambassador and soccer?s shining light as he turned 60 on Sunday.

 ?If anyone is admired as an icon in German football, it is without doubt Franz Beckenbauer,? wrote a German daily in a typical expression of affection in the media. ?He succeeded at almost everything and failed at almost nothing.?

 Even Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder added his tribute. ?You have always remained modest and reserved, despite your fame and great success,? said Schroeder in a newspaper tribute. 

 Paris: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba has threatened to stop playing for Ivory Coast following reaction from angry fans to the team?s home defeat by Cameroon in a World Cup qualifier.

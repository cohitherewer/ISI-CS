Calcutta: Abhishek Jhunjhunwala wants to play for Bengal in Ranji Trophy. Primarily a batsman, he is developing into a useful allrounder. If he continues to perform the way he did at the Eden on Tuesday, it shouldnt be long before he realises his dream. 

Abhishek weaved a magical spell of off-spin to pick up six for 20, including a hattrick, to floor East Bengal. CAB Presidents XI won by 37 runs to move into the P. Sen Trophy semis. No mean achievement that against a team boasting seven current Bengal players. 

CAB XI captain and former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta chipped in with a well-made 55. It was Dasguptas 71-run stand for the fourth wicket with Ayan Nandi that helped the CAB team reach a challenging total of 229. It was a tricky target for East Bengal on a slow and low track. 

East Bengal had a decent opening stand of 57, but the rot set in once two wickets fell on that score. Abhishek, whose first victim was Sourashish, sent back Shib Sagar Singh, Ritam Kundu and Fakruddin Sajjad off successive balls. The wicket was slow, so I tried to keep the ball in the right place, saidAbhishek later. 

In the other quarter final, Sporting Union beat NSI.

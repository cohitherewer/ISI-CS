 PCB seeks BCCI support 

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is hoping India to back its proposal of two neutral umpires in one-dayers when International Cricket Council (ICC) takes up the issue for discussion in the executive board meeting later this month. 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan would discuss the proposal with Indian cricket board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra during his visit to India for the ICC meeting, scheduled to be held in Delhi on march 17-18, PCB sources said. 

?Shaharyar will try to convince Mahendra to support his proposal of third country umpires in one day Internationals. No one can deny the importance of India in the ICC,? the sources said. 

PCB submitted its proposal for neutral umpires in one-day Internationals after some poor umpiring cost them dearly in the tri-series final against Australia last month. 

At present under the ICC rules out of the two on-field umpires one is from the host nation while the other is from a third country. The ICC has included Pakistan?s proposal in the agenda for its executive board meeting. 

PCB sources said it was also expecting support from countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Indies and Zimbabwe. 

?India?s support means the support of Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and West Indies which means five certain votes in favour of third country umpires in one-dayers,? they said. 

?We have prepared a paper which we will submit in the executive committee meeting. But prior to that, we would like to secure maximum votes in favour of the proposal and then wait for the ICC to give decision because plenty of things are involved.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bob Woolmer is the best, says Youhana

Dharamshala: After Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist, it is the turn of Pakistan?s Yousuf Youhana to downplay the significance of clinching a series win in India. 

Gilchrist had said at the start of the season that, unlike his former captain Steve Waugh, neither he nor his teammates saw conquering the ?final frontier? as the be all and end all of their cricket. 

And now Pakistanis to echo a similar view. 

Skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq said on the eve of the three-day tour opener here that they would like to extend their horizon and look beyond the series against India, and that he would rate winning against Australia as a better achievement. 

Youhana is in perfect agreement with him. 

?The point is Australia are the world champions. I have not seen a better team. Before them, it was the West Indies. So winning against them (Australia) is naturally a big achievement,? Youhana said 

As one who has seen coaches come and go, Youhana gave a five-star rating to Bob Woolmer. 

?Woolmer is the best. I don?t want to compare him to anyone else but he doesn?t discourage the players. Makes them sit in front of the laptop and teaches them the nuances of the game. In every way, he is a very understanding coach.? 

Youhana said one must look ahead of Indo-Pak Tests. ?There is no point in looking at the past, we have to look ahead. 

?We have to remember that there was no cricket for a while (in the 1990s). We had a good team at that time and wanted to play, but India did not want to, for whatever reasons. 

?Last year when India came, our team was in a rebuilding process. Even now ours is an inexperienced side, and the Indians are strong.? 

Youhana said the Indian team will outweigh his with their sheer experience but Pakistan will not go down without a fight. ?Without doubt they are the experienced side. They have more players who have played more than 50 Tests. For us it is just Inzamam and me, with 97 and 56 Tests. 

?But there will be no easy matches, we are determined to make it difficult for them in every match.? 

Being the lone Christian in the team might have helped the 30-year old from Lahore approach the emotion-ridden series with a sense of detachment. But Youhana feels that has never put him in trouble in Pakistan. 

?I have not faced any problems. I have been with the team for the past seven years and have not seen a better dressing room atmosphere. I never have heard a wrong comment or seen any untoward incident. 

?I have been born and brought up there. And good and bad people are everywhere,? said Youhana.

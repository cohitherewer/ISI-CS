Calcutta: As the Royal Challenge-presented The Telegraph Merchants Cup teed off over the Royal Calcutta Golf Club Tuesday, J. Gohain, 75 (Williamson Magor Group A) kept his nose narrowly ahead of J. P. Singh Deo (BM Birla Heart Research Centre), who had a 76. 

Following closely were J. Thomas at 77, ITC at 79 and Tata Steel at 80. That made up the top five in Division I. 

In Division II Duncans and Williamson Magor Group C shared first day honours at 82, though S. C. Bowrys effort of nett- 57 ensured he was the lowest nett score for the day. 

Traditionally this event is meant to be played through pouring rain, and the 62 participants who finished their first rounds certainly showed they were prepared to brave some very difficult conditions. 

The meet is being played under a new format for the first time where based on handicap players can discard up to as many as three holes. 

In Division III new entrants Oil India, represented by India international Vandana Agarwal were runaway leaders with 77, with Goodricke B at 83 and Eastern Railway at 84. 

In the Royal Challenge Telegraph Cup played on a Double Peoria format where the hole numbers are only declared at the end of the day, Sudsons represented by Karan Sood took the early lead when his score of 70.6 stayed narrowly ahead of the Four Eagle player A Rathod who had a 71. Under this format till the last day no team can be sure of victory.

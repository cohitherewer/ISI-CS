 Hari finishes fourth

Lausanne: World junior champion P. Harikrishna went down to Grandmaster Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan and had to be content with fourth place in the Lausanne Young Masters meet. 

GM Andrei Volokitin of Ukraine, the top seed, annexed the crown with his second straight victory over US Hikaru Nakamura. Volokitin thus completed a 2-0 rout in the final and remained the only unbeaten player in the tournament. 

Mamedyarov finished third but not before he was stretched to the limit by Harikrishna who missed out on some good opportunities before losing the sudden-death game. (PTI)

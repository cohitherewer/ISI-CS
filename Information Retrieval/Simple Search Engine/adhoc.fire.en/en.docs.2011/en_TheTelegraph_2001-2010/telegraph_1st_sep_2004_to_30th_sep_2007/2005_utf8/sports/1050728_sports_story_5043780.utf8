 Madrid: European 5,000m indoor record holder Alberto Garcia has been selected by Spain for next month?s world championships in Helsinki, a month after completing a two-year ban for doping.

 Garcia was banned in 2003 after testing positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO (erythropoietin) at the world cross country championships in Lausanne. He has clocked 13 minutes 10.58 for the 5,000m this season, but finished a disappointing seventh in the Spanish championships last weekend after suffering from a blistered foot. 

 Stockholm: Sweden?s Joachim Johansson will be out of action for up to eight months after a shoulder operation, a Stockholm daily reported.

 ?During the rehabilitation I?ll work on building up my body,? Johansson said in the paper?s web edition.

 The hard-serving 23-year-old was ranked 10th in the world earlier this year after capturing titles in Adelaide and Marseille. He is currently 14th in the rankings. 

 Madrid: Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard has committed himself to the Spanish champions for another four years.

 ?We have reached an agreement with the club until 2009 which I will sign after the Asian tour,? Rijkaard said on Tuesday at the club?s pre-season training camp in Denmark.

 ?The club has shown confidence in me and the coaching staff. Now the most important thing is to get on and enjoy the day to day work at the club.?

 The 42-year-old joined Barca in 2003 and after a difficult start to his first season steered them into second place behind Valencia. 

 London: Frenchman Philippe Troussier has turned down the chance to coach Nigeria for a second time, the BBC reported on Tuesday.

 Troussier was chosen by the Nigerian Football Association (NFA) this week to take charge of their team but has rejected the job on health grounds. ?I have decided to stop negotiations with the NFA,? Troussier said. ?After my last meeting with officials of the NFA, I travelled over the last three days to see my surgeon in Paris.

 ?We have decided to operate on my knee at the beginning of September. I will need three months of rehabilitation after the surgery.? 

 Milan: Italian club Genoa have been demoted from Serie A to the third division after the Italian Football League investigated claims of match-fixing.

 The League?s disciplinary commission had examined evidence relating to Genoa?s 3-2 win over Venezia on the final day of the season which secured them promotion from Serie B.

 The ruling means Genoa, one of Italy?s oldest clubs, will have to play next season in Serie C1. 

 London: Dutch international Edgar Davids has joined Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer from Inter Milan, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday.

 The 32-year-old midfielder will undergo a medical 

 and agree personal terms later this week, the club said.

 The England and Manchester United defender is reported to have been punched in the face after an argument with a man who wanted to take his photograph at club Cafe Opera in central Stockholm, according to eyewitnesses.

 ?It was unpleasant,? Ferdinand, on a holiday in the Swedish capital, told the paper. ?I?m not a troublemaker, but sometimes these things happen.?

 On Wednesday, Ferdinand was banned from driving for 28 days after he was caught overtaking a police car at 106 miles per hour on the M6 near Stafford. 

 London: Global sportswear giant Nike could back out of its sponsorship deal with English football giants Manchester United if the side fails to return to its winning ways, The Sunday Telegraph reported.

 This past season United ? taken over earlier this month by US sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer ? has won no major honours, and finished a distant third in the Premiership.

 Nike is due to meet Glazer next month to discuss his strategic vision for the world?s most famous football club.

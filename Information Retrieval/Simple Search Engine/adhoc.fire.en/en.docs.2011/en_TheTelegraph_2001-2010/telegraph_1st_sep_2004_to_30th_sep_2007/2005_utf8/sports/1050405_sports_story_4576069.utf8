The Telegraph - Calcutta

 City turns into a fortress 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Visakhapatnam: The entire city and all roads leading to the new ACA Stadium have been placed under an unprecedented security cover as the port city gears up for the second ODI between India and Pakistan. 

About 5000 security personnel, including men in plain clothes, will monitor various security points, while 2000 extra policemen will be deployed inside the stadium. 

Elaborating security arrangements, the commissioner of police V. Kaumudhy, told The Telegraph on Monday: ?CISF will join hands with the city police to keep the port areas under vigil, while the AP Special Security Force will also be pressed into service.? 

Asked whether there?s any Naxalite threat to the city?s biggest event in recent years, Kaumudhy said: ?We?re leaving no stones unturned.? 

The Taj Regency, which hosts both the teams, looks like a fortress. No mediapersons were allowed while guests needed to show passes for entry. The Potuamalaya Palem area, which is beside NH 5 and where the stadium is situated, has been kept under 24-hour vigil, informed Kaumudhy.

 Mohanty to lead Orissa

Bhubaneswar: Former India medium-pacer Debasish Mohanty will lead Orissa in the ensuing Ranji Trophy season, the state association announced on Tuesday. Former Test opener Shiv Sundar Das will be Mohantys deputy. 

The team will be coached by former Orissa opener Sriram Das, while former India stumper Syed Saba Karim will be the consultant. 

It will be huge challenge for Saba Karim as Orissa hope to graduate into the Elite division of the Ranji Trophy after languishing in the Plate division for quite a few seasons. 

Orissa did, however, win the East Zone one-day championship last season. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mankad in main round

 - 25-year-old first Indian in 9 years to progress through qualifiers 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Harsh Mankad beat Jamie Delgado 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 

Chennai: He?s arguably the most neglected tennis player in the country. Very low profile and without a sponsor as well. When it comes to making a statement on the court, however, there?s few to match Harsh Mankad. 

The 25-year-son of reputed sportspersons Ashok and Nirupama on Monday hogged the limelight through sheer hard work and diligence. He became the first Indian in nine years to progress through the qualifying rounds to the main draw of the ATP event in Chennai. 

It was a typical Mankad effort. Like in the previous two rounds, he was facing a higher-ranked player. And like on Sunday, he again dropped the first set in the final qualifying round to Briton Jamie Delgado. Yet he came through, finishing the match strongly to win 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. 

Meanwhile, Vinod Sridhar came a cropper in his bid to making the main draw, losing 3-6, 4-6 to Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. 

Not just Chennai, this was the first time the Mumbaikar had qualified for any Tour event. ?It?s a very satisfying performance. I now need to sustain this level over a long period of time,? Mankad said minutes after completing a landmark win on Court No.2. 

Many in the fraternity felt he should have got one of the three wild cards here which went to Leander Paes, Prakash Amritraj and the inexperienced Karan Rastogi. But that hardly bothered Mankad. 

?I wasn?t upset or anything for having been denied a wild card. I didn?t need any extra motivation to do well in the qualifiers. I believe I have reached a stage where I can play a high level of tennis. What I am working on is consistency,? said Mankad, who plays eighth-seeded American Kevin Kim in the opening round of the main draw. 

What stood out in Mankad?s game Monday was his aggression. He attacked Delgado?s serve at every opportunity and had several service return winners in sets two and three. 

?I have been working on that aspect the last two years with my coach Happy Bhalla,? remarked Mankad. The New York-based Bhalla travelled with Mankad on the Tour for just six weeks last years. ?If I get a sponsor, I?ll be able to afford a travelling coach throughout the year,? he lamented. 

The first week of 2005 has already been a memorable one for Mankad. But he doesn?t want to make any predictions. ?If this is to be my breakthrough year, so be it,? he remarked with a touch of cynicism. 

One can?t really blame Mankad. He would surely have been in a happier frame of mind if he had a God-father.

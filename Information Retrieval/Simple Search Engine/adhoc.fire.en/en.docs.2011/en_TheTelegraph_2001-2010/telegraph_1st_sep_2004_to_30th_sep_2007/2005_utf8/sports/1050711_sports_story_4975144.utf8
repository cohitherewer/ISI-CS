 Narain: Car problems frustrating 

Silverstone: Narain Karthikeyan on Sunday rued his failure to make use of a good start at the British Grand Prix where he was done in by an electrical failure on the 11th lap. 

I had a very good start and overtook (Felipe) Massa but unfortunately he was able to overtake me at Becketts, Karthikeyan said. 

However, I had a very good pace and I managed to run with the pack of Massa, (David) Coulthard and (Nick) Heidfeld. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards, the car stopped, apparently because of an electrical failure, the Jordan driver said. 

Massa finished the race at the 10th place, heidfeld 12th and coulthard 13th. 

It is very frustrating, as it is the second weekend in a row that I am experiencing some problems with my car, although I managed to finish the race in Magny-Cours. It is really a pity as I was going very well all weekend. 

Adrian Burgess, Jordans sporting director, said though the Indian was doing a fantastic job, luck was not on his side. 

Poor Narain, again he did not have any luck in the race. As always, he was doing a fantastic job keeping up with Massa, until we had an electrical failure, which shut the engine off and forced him to retire the car.

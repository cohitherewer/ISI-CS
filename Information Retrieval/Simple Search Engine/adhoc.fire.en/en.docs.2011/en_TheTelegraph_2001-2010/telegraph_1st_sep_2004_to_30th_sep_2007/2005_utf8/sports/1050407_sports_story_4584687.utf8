The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kunte makes it two wins in-a-row

 - DUBAI OPEN - Sandipan splits point with Oleg Kulicov 

 Abhijit Kunte beat Sergey Kayumov of Uzbekistan 

Dubai: Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte registered a fine victory over International Master Sergey Kayumov of Uzbekistan in the second round of the 7th Dubai international open chess championship here. 

After his second straight victory, Kunte shares the leader?s spot with two points in the $40000 prize money tournament. 

The day produced many draws especially on the top boards with fancied players Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan and Russians Mikhail Kobalia and Sergey Volkov conceding a half point to their lower rated opponents. 

The second round turned out to be quite good for the Indian contingent. Grandmaster Koneru Humpy, ranked 45th in this event, held sixth seed GM Ni Hua of China quite easily. 

International Master S. Kidambi was the other gainer as he drew with much higher ranked Volkov while GMs Sandipan Chanda and R.B. Ramesh settled for draws with Russian Oleg Kulicov and Chinese Zhang Zhong respectively. 

On the lower boards too the Indians made merry. Eesha Karavade started the trend as she demolished UAE?s Saleh Nagueb while Parimarjan Negi, G. Rohit, Sashikant Kutwal, G. Balaji, S. Mari Ar Ul, S.P. Sethuraman, C.N. Vaidya and Aswin Jayaram followed suit soon after. 

In the lone all-Indian encounter of the day, N. Srinath proved superior to Omkar Patwardhan. On the flip side, first round winners, GM-norm holder Lanka Ravi and Abhijit Gupta went down against Gadir Guseinov of Azerbaijan and Wu Wenjin of China respectively. 

Also on the receiving end were D. Sai Srinivas, who failed to keep the momentum going and bowed down to Aleksej Aleksandrov of Belarus, and Rahul Shetty, who could not quite match Armenian Gabriel Sargissen. 

Kunte played a fine game to beat Kayumov who played black and failed to effectively counter the positional finesses of the former national champion. Winning a pawn in the endgame, Kunte wasted little time in converting his advantage into a full point. 

Humpy was not very upbeat at the final outcome against Ni Hua. Playing white, Humpy faced the in-vogue Slav defence and boasted of a spatial advantage in the middle game. 

However, a little bit of inaccurate planning gave Hua the chance to come back in the game and the peace was signed in just 23 moves. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The stage is set for fab four to fire

 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 

 Rooney will return from suspension 

London: The first pieces in the Champions League jigsaw should fit into place this week with Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea guaranteed a passage from the group stage with victories. 

European champions Liverpool, Olympique Lyon and Real Madrid could also advance to the knockout phase depending on other results. 

Bayern, who along with Arsenal and Lyon boast a perfect record, have a stranglehold on Group A and can seal their passage with a win over their main rivals Juventus at the Della Alpi on Wednesday. 

The German champions, who would also advance with a draw providing Bruges do not beat Rapid in the other game, beat the Italians 2-1 in the reverse fixture but lost in Turin last season. 

Bayern suffered a blow on Saturday after in-form Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz was ruled out for around six months after sustaining a knee ligament injury. 

Juventus, second on six points, will be smarting after their record nine-match winning start to the season was ended by AC Milan at the weekend. 

Arsenal talisman Thierry Henry could be recalled by manager Arsene Wenger as the north London side seek a victory at home over Sparta Prague that will put them through from Group B. 

The France striker missed the weekend draw with Tottenham after aggravating a groin injury. Barcelona welcome Panathinaikos to the Nou Camp on Wednesday on the verge of the knockout stages. 

Barcelona, top of Group C with seven points, are without Portugal midfielder Deco and Brazilian defender Juliano Belletti through injury. 

Jose Mourinhos Chelsea have no problems scoring at home or abroad and on Tuesday face a Real Betis side in disarray. Chelsea would go into the last 16 with a victory with Premier League rivals Liverpool also advancing if they beat Anderlecht at Anfield, providing Chelsea also triumph. 

Olympique Lyon, as dominant in Ligue 1 as Chelsea are in the Premier League, will qualify from Group F with a victory over Olympiakos as long as Real Madrid do not lose to Rosenborg. 

Lyon will be at full strength with defenders Jeremy Berthod and Anthony Reveillere, rested at the weekend, back in the squad. 

Real, who could also qualify by beating Rosenborg if Olympiakos do not beat Lyon, have defender Sergio Ramos back after suspension. Brazilian duo Ronaldo and Julio Baptista and France playmaker Zinedine Zidane are injured and will miss the trip to Norway. 

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is under mounting pressure after a 1-4 drubbing at Middlesbrough on Saturday left their title chances in ruins with Chelsea already 13 points above the Premier Leagues once-dominant power. 

United travel to Lille on Wednesday as one-point leaders in a tightly-fought Group D with Ferguson demanding a rapid improvement. 

England striker Wayne Rooney returns from suspension but Paul Scholes is banned. Lille, bottom of the group on two points, have not registered a goal in three games and are without midfielder Stephane Dumont.

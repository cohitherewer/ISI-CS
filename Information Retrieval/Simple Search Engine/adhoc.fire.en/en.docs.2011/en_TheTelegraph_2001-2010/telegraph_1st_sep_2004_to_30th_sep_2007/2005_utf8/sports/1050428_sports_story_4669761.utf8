 Yangon: Military leaders, government ministers and tennis fans gathered on Wednesday for the start of the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Group IV round robin tournament in the capital Yangon.

 The event is the first Davis Cup tournament held in the isolated military-ruled country for 50 years. The last time Myanmar hosted a Davis Cup match was in 1955, when the country played against a visiting squad from the Philippines.

 The tournament, which continues through May 1, brings together teams of four players each from 10 countries ? Iraq, Myanmar, UAE, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Singapore, Jordan, Bangladesh and Syria. The top two teams will advance to Asia-Oceania Group III of the Davis Cup for 2006. 

 London: Vietnam will host a top-level men?s tennis tournament this year for the first time, the ATP said on Wednesday. Ho Chi Minh City will be the venue for the indoor tournament from September 26 to October 2.

 ?The event in Ho Chi Minh City shows the growth of tennis in Asia and the ATP is confident that the event will be successful,? ATP managing director Brad Drewett said in a statement. 

 The tournament in Vietnam replaces the Heineken Open in Shanghai on the ATP calendar. Shanghai will host the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup for the next three years.

 Beijing: Chinese superstar basketball player Yao Ming was on Wednesday named a ?model worker? by the labour union in his hometown, Shanghai, the Communist nation?s gleaming commercial hub.

 Yao, 24, is the first sportsman to receive the prestigious honour, which was hitherto reserved for the likes of bus conductors, plumbers, miners and other employees in China, who were awarded the title on the eve of international Labour Day on May 1 each year.

 London: Former world No. 1 Nick Price has accepted a special exemption to compete in this year?s US Open at Pinehurst, the United States Golf Association (USGA) said.

 The USGA executive committee offered Price, who has dropped out of the world?s top 50 after being a regular for the last 18 years, the invitation after a vote. He is now ranked 72nd in the world. 

 The US Open, the second of the year?s four majors, will be played from June 16-19. 

 Santiago: Nelson Acosta returned for a second stint as Chile coach on Tuesday, replacing Juvenal Olmos, who was fired after a telephone row with the head of the country?s football association a week ago.

 The ANFP also confirmed Acosta?s appointment on its website.

 Rome: Italy?s Mario Cipollini, one of cycling?s most celebrated riders, announced his retirement on Tuesday.

 The 2002 world champion has been the sport?s leading sprinter for the last 16 years and holds the Giro d?Italia record for the most stage wins, having crossed the line first 42 times. He has won 12 stages in the Tour de France.

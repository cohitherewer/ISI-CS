 Nakata under attack

Tokyo: Japans Hidetoshi Nakata was the target of rare criticism from teammate Shunsuke Nakamura after defeat against Mexico, a Japanese newspaper reported on Saturday. Nakamura accused Nakata of drifting out of position during Thursdays 1-2 defeat by Mexico, according to a sports daily, prompting rumours of a rift between the players. 

Hide drifts forward, so when they attacked us through the middle I had no choice but to drop back, Nakamura was quoted as saying. I ran out of steam (doing that) and ended up getting substituted, which was a shame. There are things you can do and things you cant. 

Nakamura has been given the playmaker role by Japan coach Zico, while Nakata has been ordered to sit deeper. Mexicos 64th-minute winner through Francisco Fonseca came after Nakata had pushed up to support the attack. 

A clearly disgruntled Nakamura had been replaced by Junichi Inamoto five minutes earlier. Fiorentina midfielder Nakata is Japans most recognisable player and is rarely criticised by his Japan teammates, coaches or the countrys media. However, he was twice involved in training ground bust-ups with his Japan teammates this year as the pressure to qualify for next years World Cup finals began to take its toll.

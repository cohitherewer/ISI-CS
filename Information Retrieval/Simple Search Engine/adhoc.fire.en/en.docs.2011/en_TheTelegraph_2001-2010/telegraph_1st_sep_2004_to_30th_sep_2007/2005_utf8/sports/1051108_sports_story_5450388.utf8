 ATP hopes to jazz up doubles

 - Cast in role of Big Bad Wolf, governing body plans golden tie-break 

 NEIL HARMAN

 New ATP chairman has sought Mahesh Bhupathis views on rule changes 

Andy Roddick has a home-grown word for it: overtime. With overtime, doubles lives; without it, a sentimental tennis element that has fast become an expensively irrelevant sideshow, has little chance of survival in a world governed by television executives, protectionist tournament directors and singles-minded schedules. 

This weekend, the eight singles players who have qualified for the Masters Cup will be joined in Shanghai by eight doubles teams, many of whom feared that this might be the last time they would be afforded such a privilege anywhere other than the four Grand Slam championships and the middle Saturday of Davis Cup ties. 

The belief was that the ATP, the mens governing body, cast in the role of Big Bad Wolf, wanted to devour them whole. 

Things had begun to look that way, with disruptive scoring changes and entry system squeezes, dressed up as spurious enhancements, brought in on the back of ill-judged surveys that appeared to show that the only way to get singles players to play doubles (the heart of the whole matter) was to reduce the length of sets and, by the start of 2008, controversially use singles only rankings as the sole means of qualifying to play doubles at ATP events. 

The doubles players declared open warfare, 45 of them took out an anti-trust lawsuit against their employers and waited for the response. 

Amid this, Etienne de Villiers, who had not been party to the original plans, became ATP chairman and has spent the first period of his term of office seeking a resolution to the impasse. He believes that he has found one. 

Determined to improve doubles, make it more attractive to our fans as well as a more successful product, De Villiers has offered a four-pronged plan to secure its place as a vibrant element of tennis, the most visible of which is the introduction of a match tie-break should a third set be required to complete a match ? the first to ten points with a difference of two. 

Rather than short sets that had produced such ghastly scorelines as 5-3, 5-2, the ATP insists on a return to two tie-break sets with no advantage scoring, the match tie-break and a rigidly enforced 25-second break between points. 

This gives tournaments a more predictable match length, which should allow more show-court scheduling, De Villiers said. 

Explicitly, the ATP will drop the 2008 singles only entry condition ? calling it a major concession. 

The reason? We want more marquee singles players to play doubles and the player field to be more democratic and egalitarian, the chairman said. 

We will not be bound by quotas, but we would like a 50-50 field by the end of 2006 and that the proportion of singles players continues to grow during 2007. We reserve the right to tinker or change at the end of 07, but this will be based on feedback from tournaments, players, fan reaction, media, research and statistics. 

De Villiers wants to see the appointment of a doubles tsar at the ATP and the creation of a doubles promotion fund financed by doubles players, sacrificing five per cent of their prize-money over the next two years. 

As a final gesture, any player who has invested in the players pension fund for four years by the end of 2007 and is prevented playing doubles as a result of the proposed changes will be eligible for full pension benefits. 

The chairman has spent the past three weeks in negotiation with the leading doubles spokesmen, notably Mark Knowles and Mahesh Bhupathi, as well as polling views from as many singles players as possible. 

He submitted his ideas to the four Grand Slam tournament chairmen on Friday. 

He believes that there are enough grounds for the 45 doubles players to drop their lawsuit because its central basis, the exclusion of doubles players on ranking grounds, no longer exists.

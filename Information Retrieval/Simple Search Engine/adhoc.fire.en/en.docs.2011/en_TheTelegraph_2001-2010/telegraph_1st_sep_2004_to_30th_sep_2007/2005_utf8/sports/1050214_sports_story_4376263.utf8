The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav confirms unavailability

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly will not play for East Zone in their Duleep Trophy match against Central Zone in Gwalior from February 15 due to a side strain. That he is likely to miss the tie had been reported by The Telegraph Sunday. 

However, it was learnt that Sourav will be available for East Zone?s second match, against a Bangladesh selection, in Nagpur from February 22. 

?Sourav is nursing a side strain (suffered during the Challenger Trophy) and may not play in the match against Central Zone,? a top Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) official confirmed on Sunday. The injury, however, ?is nothing serious,? he said. In Sourav?s absence, vice-captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla will lead the side. 

The official also said that no replacement has been named expecting Sourav?s return in the second match. 

?We would have had to bring the replacement back when Sourav takes charge in Nagpur. Hence we decided not to not use any substitute for the first match,? the official disclosed.

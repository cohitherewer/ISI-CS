 Spurs hold United

London: Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur missed the chance to slash Chelseas lead in the English Premier League when they drew 1-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday. 

Jermaine Jenass free kick for Spurs cancelled out Mikael Silvestres first-half opener and the result left champions Chelsea eight points clear before their match at bottom club Everton on Sunday. 

Promoted Wigan Athletic jumped to third after a 2-0 win at Aston Villa and Arsenal kept in touch with a 1-0 home win over Manchester City. 

Robert Pires scored Arsenals winner with a penalty but wasted a second spot-kick in bizarre circumstances. 

European champions Liverpool lost more ground after a 2-0 defeat at Fulham and struggling Birmingham City were also beaten 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers. Charlton Athletic were due to play at Portsmouth later. 

At Old Trafford, French defender Silvestre put United in front after only seven minutes but the much-improved London side did not capitulate. 

Jenas curled in a fine free kick to equalise 18 minutes from time and fellow midfielder Michael Carrick hit the bar with another free kick late on. 

Arsenal are up to sixth on 16 points from nine games but their win over City at Highbury will be remembered for the extraordinary incident involving Pires. 

The French midfielder had already given Arsenal the lead with a 61st-minute penalty when they were awarded a second spot kick with quarter of an hour left. 

In an apparent attempt to fool City goalkeeper David James, Pires tried to tap the spot-kick to Thierry Henry but fluffed his touch and referee Mike Riley awarded City a free kick, apparently because the ball had not moved sufficiently off the spot.

 N. Korea vs Japan game 

in Bangkok

Tokyo: North Koreas politically charged World Cup qualifier against Japan next month will be played in Bangkok, Thai media said on Saturday. 

According to a Bangkok daily, Thai football officials received a fax from Fifa requesting the match be held in Thailand after soccers governing body switched it from North Koreas capital Pyongyang. 

Fifa ordered the June 8 clash to be played in a neutral country following crowd trouble after North Koreas 0-2 loss to Iran on March 30. 

The group B clash will now go ahead at Rajamangala National Stadium in Bangkok. 

Fifa punished North Korea after angry fans hurled bottles, rocks and other projectiles in protest at a late sending off in the game with Iran at Kim Il-sung Stadium. 

Japan indicated, however, that they would protest if Fifa ordered the game to be played in China after weeks of anti-Japan demonstrations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Spin of coin may be thing of past

Mumbai: The practice of toss in deciding the result of inconclusive Ranji Trophy matches may soon be a thing of the past. 

The one-day annual conclave of the captains and coaches here on Monday called for abolishing the practice following Himachal Pradesh missing out on a place in the plate division final and thus, an Elite Group berth. Himachal lost the tie to Services on the basis of toss afte the match had to be abandoned due to rain. 

A suggestion to increase the penalty for the slow over rate was also floated. (PTI)

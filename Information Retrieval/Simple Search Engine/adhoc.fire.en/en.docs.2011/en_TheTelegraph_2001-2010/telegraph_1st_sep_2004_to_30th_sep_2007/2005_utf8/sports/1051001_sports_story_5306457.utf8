The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagans chance

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: An all-win record beckons Mohun Bagan when they face Mohammedan Sporting in their last match of the CFL Premier Division at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. So far they have garnered 39 points from 13 matches. 

Only East Bengal have done it twice ? once in 1975 and again two years later. 

Naturally the players are under a bit of a pressure, but we have told them not to think about the record but to play take it as any other match, Dutta said after the practice session. 

If Mohun Bagan manage a win on Saturday, Amal Dutta will have the distinction of having won the unbeaten league crown for both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. 

Mohammedan Sporting have nothing to lose as they are in third position after East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.

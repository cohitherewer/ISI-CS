The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indian Oil, BSF record victories

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indian Oil and Border Security Force, Jalandhar logged full points after narrowly winning their respective quarter final league matches in the 110th Indian Oil All-India Beighton Cup hockey tournament on Wednesday. 

BSF got past the stiff challenge of Corps of Signals (also from Jalandhar) and registered a 2-1 victory while Indian Oil got the better of Karnataka XI by a solitary goal at the CC amp;FC ground. 

After a barren first session, the BSF side scaled up the offensive and opened the account through a field goal by Amrit Lakra in the 54th minute. 

The lead, however, was shortlived as skipper Paramjit Singh drew level for Corps of Signals, direct entrants at the quarter final league stage, in the 63rd minute. 

Barely two minutes later, Mangroo Tirkey nicely converted a penalty corner to enable the BSF men return with full points. 

In the other match, Indian Oil successfully defended a slender lead after Lakhwinder Singh broke the ice in the 10th minute of the game. 

Among the other quarter finalists, Army XI take on Tamil Nadu XI while Punjab Police face Bombay XI Thursday. 

Altogether four sides ? Corps of Signals, Indian Oil, Punjab Police and Army XI ? were direct entrants at the last eight stage of the tournament.

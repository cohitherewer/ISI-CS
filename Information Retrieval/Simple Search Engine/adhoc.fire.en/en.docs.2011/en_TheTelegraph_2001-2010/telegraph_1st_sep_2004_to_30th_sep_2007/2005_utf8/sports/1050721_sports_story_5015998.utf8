 Jordan join Ferrari, Red Bull 

 Mosleys meeting with drivers to go ahead on August 1 

Paris: Jordan have joined Ferrari and Red Bull in agreeing to extend Formula Ones commercial agreement to 2012 and turn their backs on a rival championship. 

They are the third team to reach an understanding with Ecclestones FOA (Formula One Administration) to prolong the Concorde Agreement from 2008 until 2012. 

Until recently Ferrari were isolated with the other teams considering setting up a separate series in a battle for control of revenues and decision-making. However Red Bull will use Ferrari engines from next season and Midland chief Shnaider is close to Ecclestone. Jordan have Toyota engines this year but they are assessing their options. 

Jordans much-awaited launch of the new car has run into further trouble with the EJ15Bs cooling system experiencing recurring problems. 

The car, to have made its entry at this weekends German GP, is now expected to be ready for the inaugural Turkish GP on August 21. 

Meanwhile Formula One safety talks between drivers and Max Mosley, the head of the sports governing body, will go ahead as planned on August 1 despite a lower than expected turnout. (Agencies)

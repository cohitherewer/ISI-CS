London: Alex Ferguson admitted Manchester United had left themselves with a mountain to climb after a goalless draw with relegation-threatened Crystal Palace allowed Chelsea to pull further clear at the top of the Premier League. 

Chelsea beat relegation fodder Norwich City 3-1 to extend their lead to eight points, thanks to goals from Joe Cole, Mateja Kezman and Ricardo Carvalho. The Blues also have a game in hand on United, who have nine matches left. 

Elsewhere, a Thierry Henry treble for Arsenal saw them cruise to a 3-0 home win over Portsmouth while Liverpool?s hopes of Champions League qualification were further dented by a 0-1 defeat at Newcastle. 

Chelsea?s England midfielder Cole skipped through a couple of challenges on 22 minutes before driving in a spectacular left-foot strike to open the scoring at Carrow Road. 

Leon McKenzie equalised with a precise header 64 minutes in, the goal being the first time Chelsea?s Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech had conceded for some 17 hours of Premiership football. 

Kezman tapped in Frank Lampard?s shot which was heading wide, seven minutes later before Carvalho headed in his first Chelsea goal from a corner with 11 minutes left. 

United dominated their match at Selhurst Park but despite a string of chances, the visitors did everything but score past 10-man Palace. 

After a scrappy first half, Ferguson brought on Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, but United still failed to score despite Greece midfielder Vassilis Lakis being sent off for two yellow cards. 

Ferguson?s side surged forward and laid siege to Gabor Kiraly?s goal but wasted a host of chances. 

?If we compete and trust in each other as much as we did today there?s no reason why we can?t survive,? said Palace boss Iain Dowie. 

At Highbury, Portsmouth had looked the more likely to score but Henry struck in the 39th minute. 

The France striker scored his second eight minutes after the interval, chipping over Pompey goalkeeper Kostas Chalkias. The Gunners then rode to a comfortable win as Henry claimed his hattrick with five minutes left. 

Meanwhile, Samuel Eto?o scored his 18th goal of the season to earn Spanish league leader Barcelona a 1-0 win over Osasuna, while second-place Real Madrid drew 1-1 at Valencia. 

Barcelona failed to impress at Osasuna?s El Sadar stadium Saturday but won their first in three matches and extended their lead to eight points. 

Valencia?s Argentine forward Pablo Aimar opened the scoring at the Mestalla Stadium, with Ronaldo equalising for Madrid with his first goal in eight matches. 

With 11 rounds remaining, Barcelona has 62 points, while Madrid has 54. Sevilla, Villarreal and Valencia are next with 43. 

Eto?o forced a diving save from Juantxo Elia in the 37th minute, and in the next attack Rafael Marquez chipped over Elia but just wide of the post. The Cameroon striker scored in the 40th minute when, after receiving Deco?s through ball, he rifled a shot from the right of the area. Elia deflected the ball onto his right post and into the net. Barcelona?s players wore black armbands in memory of their former coach Rinus Michels. 

Madrid, without Zinedine Zidane, Raul Gonzalez, Michael Owen and Michel Salgado, fell behind in the 14th minute. 

Aimar made a surging run and, following a deflection by teammate Miguel Angel ?Mista? Ferrer on the edge of the area, unleashed a shot which gave goalkeeper Iker Casillas no chance. 

Ronaldo levelled 14 minutes later, capitalising on Guti?s defense-splitting pass, rounding goalkeeper Santiago Canizares and tapping home after eluding retreating defender Carlos Marchena.

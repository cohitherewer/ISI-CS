 BCCI steps to maximise revenues 

New Delhi: In a major effort to maximise its revenues, the BCCI on Tuesday announced a series of initiatives including retaining of intellectual property rights and creating its own TV network identity. 

All news channels will from now on have a direct contract with us. Let us make it clear that the rights are owned by the BCCI and the channels are only licensees, BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi said at a press conference. 

Accordingly, channels from now on will have to carry the BCCI logo which is to be designed and registered shortly. 

Besides the sale of radio and broadband rights, BCCI is looking to cash in on the telecom boom by announcing separate rights for mobile telephony. 

Modi also said Doordarshan cannot insert ads on its own in cases where it did not bid and win the rights for telecast. 

If they bid and win, it is fine. But if they do not bid, they must carry the feed as given by the BCCI ... So far our rights have been infringed upon, he said.

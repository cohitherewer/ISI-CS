 Pak should cancel England series, says Miandad

 - KARACHI ISSUE- Imran statement irresponsible

 Imrans statement has hurt Pakistans image 

Islamabad: Pakistan cricket authorities should cancel the upcoming series against England if they do not play a Test in Karachi, former captain Javed Miandad said on Thursday. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) they will not play a Test in the volatile southern port city on their tour due to begin in October. 

Im disappointed. It is no use playing a series when a visiting team is refusing to play in Karachi despite security assurances from the board and government, Miandad said. 

Without any direct evidence of a security threat to their players, England must be asked to play in Karachi or the series cancelled, he said. 

England are due to tour Pakistan for three Test matches and five one-day Internationals. 

Australia, the West Indies, South Africa and India have all refused to play Tests in the city in the past few years. A bomb outside a hotel where the New Zealand team was staying in 2002 killed 14 people, including 11 French engineers. 

Miandad said the stand on Karachi taken by England and other teams was hurting the countrys image and the PCB should compel England to play in Pakistans biggest city. 

Such things are hurting us in economic, political and sporting terms, he said. If Karachi is not safe for the visiting teams, then no centre is safe for them. 

Imran Khan, another former Pakistan captain, had said on Wednesday that England were justified in their decision given the law and order situation in Karachi. 

Miandad, who played 124 Tests, criticised Imran for his comments. 

His statement is irresponsible and has hurt the people and image of the country. It gives an opportunity to England to say look we are right. 

No government would like to take a risk with the safety of foreigners if they were not able to provide the required security, he said. 

Pakistan are due to tour England next year to play four Tests and a one-day series.

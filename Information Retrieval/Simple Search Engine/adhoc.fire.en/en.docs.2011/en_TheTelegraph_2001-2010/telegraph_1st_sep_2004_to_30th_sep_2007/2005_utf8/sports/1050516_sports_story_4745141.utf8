Port-of-Spain: Ashwell Prince and Justin Kemp shared a century stand to guide South Africa to a clinical win in the fourth one-day International against West Indies on Saturday. 

South Africa won by six wickets to increase their unassailable lead in the five-match series to 4-0. 

The visitors put West Indies in to bat and restricted them to 231 for eight. 

South Africa replied with 232 for four to win with 19 balls to spare but not before they slipped to 61 for three, leaving Prince and Kemp to steady the ship with a stand of 132 for the fourth wicket. 

Prince scored 89 not out off 117 balls with six fours, while Kemps 65 came off 75 balls and included five fours and two sixes. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul top scored with 85 not out to anchor West Indies total. 

South Africa claimed the series when they won the third match by one run in Barbados on Wednesday, and the futility of Saturdays dead rubber was writ large amidst the West Indians approach. 

Chanderpauls discipline, which saw him face 103 balls and hit five fours, was the exception. 

Support for the West Indies captain was largely fleeting, and the biggest stand of the innings was the 50 shared by Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan for the fourth wicket. 

Sarwan scored 48 before lifting a legside delivery from fast bowler Jacques Kallis to Andrew Hall at fine leg in the 29th over. 

South Africa began their reply unsteadily when AB de Villiers, Boeta Dippenaar and Jacques Kallis were dismissed for 17 runs each. 

De Villiers and Kallis each advanced down the pitch and edged to Chris Gayle at first slip off fast bowlers Ian Bradshaw and Corey Collymore, respectively. 

Dippenaar slapped a legside delivery from Bradshaw to Xavier Marshall at square leg. 

Prince and Kemp kept the runs trickling in but they survived several half-chances to break the partnership. 

Marshall wasted a genuine opportunity to remove Kemp for 48 when, with the total on 169 for three, he stood on the midwicket boundary as he caught Kemps pull to a delivery from off-spinner Gayle. 

Kemp was awarded a six, instead, taking him to his half-century. 

Prince and Kemp were separated in the 42nd over when Kemp top-edged a ball from Gayle to Sarwan at short point. 

Allrounder Shaun Pollock captained South Africa in the absence of Graeme Smith, who was banned for four matches as a result of his teams slow over rate in Wednesdays match. 

The last match in the series will be played at the same venue on Sunday.

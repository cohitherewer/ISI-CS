The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Foreign coach best option, says Zafar

A STAFF REPORTER

 Zafar Iqbal is rooting for Charlesworth 

Calcutta: Zafar Iqbal, skipper at the Los Angeles Olympic Games and also the countrys flag-bearer at those Games, has been known to have a sharp hockey brain and a strong opinion. Today, he sounds somewhat disillusioned with the way the sport has been handled by its apex body in the country. He also believes that democracy seems to be not too well in the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) fold. 

Among other things, he has not taken the appointment of a mid-term hockey coach (Rajinder Singh, Junior) for just one month lightly. He advocates the appointment of a foreign coach, and says that there should definitely be a fixed term for the coach and even the manager. 

In the city for the IHF AGM and elections, representing Indian Airlines, Iqbal said that the IHF could get a better representation, indicating that the overall PR of the federation has not been good. There is scope for improvement, he said. 

Despite being somewhat evasive on the issue of democracy in the IHF, he said: Things can improve. 

The biggest challenge in front of the countrys hockey situation, of course, is the players and the coach. With the departure of talented players like Dhanraj Pillay and such (six in all dropped), it is necessary to have a pool of talented players, he said. To this effect, we need a basic plan and a good coach. 

So what about an Indian coach? I am sure India has a great many good coaches, and all the top laurels we have won (Iqbal, a left winger, was a key member of the 1980 gold-wining team to the Moscow Olympic Games) have been under Indian coaches, he said. 

But considering the present circumstances, I think a foreign coach would be the best option. 

Iqbals best choice, of course is Rick Charlesworth, the legendary Australian who has not only won several laurels for his country but has also taken the womens team to the top of the world. 

Charlesworths case is pretty much like Greg Chappells, as far as CV goes. Charlesworth could have made a very good coach for us, and foreign coaches do have more knowledge to impart to our players. They would be impartial and the new methods would be helpful. 

It has already been reported that Charlesworth had made a great presentation, but a pre-condition was that he would have to be given powers of grooming and of selection. Whatever the levels of democracy in the federation, this probably was too much to give for the head honchos. 

Iqbal said that though Rajinder (Jr) was a good player and could have gone to be better had he not been erroneously hauled up for rough behaviour during the Bangladesh Asia Cup, either his tenure should be extended ? and the Azlan Shah Cup, in Kuala Lumpur from May 26 to June 5, is a major meet of the region, no doubt ? or a proper coach with a proper tenure should be appointed. 

Same with the managers, he said. In our country, unlike in other countries, managers are chosen at the last moment and dont even know the players in the team. That must change. 

That brought questions to he himself offering his services as coach. 

Iqbal thought for a while before saying that he would really not mind. Maybe, but I will think about it if I am approached, he said.

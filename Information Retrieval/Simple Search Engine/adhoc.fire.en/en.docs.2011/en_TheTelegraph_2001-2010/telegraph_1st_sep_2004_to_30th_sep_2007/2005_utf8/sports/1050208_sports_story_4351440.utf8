The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ranadeb to fill in for Pathan

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ranadeb Bose 

Calcutta: Fifty four wickets (34 in Ranji Trophy and 20 in the one-day tournaments) this season has ultimately paid off for mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose. 

Ignored by the selection committee when the squads were initially picked for the Challenger Trophy, Ranadeb was included Monday ? when the first match between India Senior and India A had already got underway in Mumbai ? in the Senior side in place of Irfan Pathan. 

?Pathan suffered a groin injury while practising last evening, and was advised rest ahead of the crucial series versus Pakistan,? a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official told The Telegraph on Monday evening. 

This afternoon, selection committee chairman Kiran More, after consulting the other selectors, decided to include Ranadeb. ?Ranadeb was informed immediately and asked to rush to Mumbai by an evening flight today itself to be available for the team?s second match against India B slated for Tuesday,? the official added. 

?Though the Senior side has already played their first match today, Ranadeb may get a look in tomorrow and also if his team makes it to the final,? he said. 

Ranadeb, though, had little idea when he left for the airport in the evening. ?I have no idea in which team I have been included and in whose place,? Ranadeb said. 

?But it is a great relief for me that my performance this season hasn?t gone unrewarded,? he added.

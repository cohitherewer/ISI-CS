 Anand registers second victory

 - WIJK AAN ZEE MEET 

 Anand got the better of Ponomariov 

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand inched closer to the leaders with a crushing victory over former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in the sixth round of the Corus chess tournament here on Friday. 

With his second victory on the trot after a forgettable start, Anand, who is looking for his hattrick, moved to 3.5 points from six games and is now just half a point behind leaders Michael Adams of England, Hungarian Peter Leko and Bulgarian Veselin Topalov. 

It turned out be another exciting game for Anand with white as Ponomariov opted for the Sicilian Nazdorf and tackled the English attack in a rather off beat fashion right from the opening. 

Anand, an exponent of the system, routinely deployed his forces on best squares and unleashed an attack on the king side that proved decisive. Winning a pawn amidst positional complexities, Anand quickly converted to a winning endgame wherein only the technicalities remained. The game lasted 62 moves. 

Veselin Topalov got himself in to the leading group after beating Comonwealth champion Nigel Short of England who played the white side of a Sveshnikov Sicilian. 

Topalov got a solid position right after the opening as Short employed a harmless set-up and the pieces got exchanged very quickly. 

In group C being played simultaneously, Parimarjan Negi?s IM norm prospects suffered a setback as he went down to lower rated B. Muhren of The Netherlands. Negi remained on 2 points after the loss.

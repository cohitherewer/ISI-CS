Tokyo: Real Madrid suffered an embarrassing 0-3 defeat to Tokyo Verdy Monday in the first of two pre-season games in Japan. 

The Spanish club were stunned by a team who had conceded 26 goals in their last six games and recently fired Argentine coach Osvaldo Ardiles. 

Daigo Kobayashi gave Verdy a shock lead after seven minutes and Reals problems mounted when Brazilian striker Washington slid home the second goal in the 27th minute. 

England striker Michael Owen went close in the 35th minute but Real were caught out again eight minutes after the break by Takuya Yamadas near-post header. 

David Beckham started after missing Saturdays 3-2 win over Chinas Beijing Guoan with a hamstring injury. 

The England captain was involved in a simmering feud with former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Kazuyuki Toda that threatened to spill over as the teams left the pitch at halftime. 

Some of their players were very dirty especially the number six Toda, Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo told reporters. He kicked Beckham when the referee wasnt looking. 

Luxemburgo acknowledged that Reals punishing pre-season tour was beginning to take its toll. The fatigue showed today, he said. Real Madrid want to win things but we also have to think of business. 

Beckhams last contribution before being taken off in the 58th minute was an audacious free-kick from the halfway line that almost caught out Verdy goalkeeper Yoshinari Takagi. 

Real had already cancelled Tuesdays training session with the players complaining of fatigue and they lacked urgency and creative spark. 

They began the pre-season tour with victories over Mexicos Chivas Guadalajara and the Los Angeles Galaxy in the United States. Reals six-match trip is set to earn the club around $ 25 million but there were swathes of empty seats among the crowd of 30,000 in Tokyo.

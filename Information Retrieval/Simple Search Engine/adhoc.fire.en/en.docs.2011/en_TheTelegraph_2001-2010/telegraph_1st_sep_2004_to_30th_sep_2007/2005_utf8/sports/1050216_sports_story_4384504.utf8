 Sania declines Qatar wild card

 - Indian star needs more time to recover from injury 

Hyderabad: Sania Mirza has declined a wild card to play in the $600,000 Qatar Open as she has not fully recovered from an ankle injury. 

Sania was offered a wild card by the organisers of the Qatar Open. But considering she needed more rest to recover from the ankle injury, she has decided not to participate in the event, her father Imran Mirza said on Tuesday. 

The Qatar Open, to be held from February 21-26 in Doha, will feature the likes of Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova and French woman Amelie Mauresmo. 

Sania had also pulled out of a WTA event in Columbia, which began on Monday, due to the same problem. 

Sania, who became the first Indian woman to win a WTA tour title by lifting the Hyderabad Open last week, had been carrying the injury for quite some time and was on pain killers when she played in the Australian Open and Hyderabad meet. 

The 18-year-old, who on Monday became the first Indian woman to break into the top 100 in world rankings, had made it clear during the Hyderabad Open that she would take enough rest before taking to the court again. 

Imran said Sania might be fit by the end of the month and could play with a wildcard in the Dubai Open beginning on February 28. (PTI)

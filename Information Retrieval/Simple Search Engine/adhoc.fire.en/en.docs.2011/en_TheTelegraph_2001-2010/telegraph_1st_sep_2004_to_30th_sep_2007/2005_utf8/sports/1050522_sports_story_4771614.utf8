 Jordan sale rumour refuted

Monaco: Russian-born billionaire Alex Shnaider has rejected speculation that he wants to sell the Jordan Formula One team he bought in January. 

Rumours have spread like wildfire at the Monaco Grand Prix but the naturalised Canadian was dismissive of them in an interview on Saturday. Its not true. I dont want to sell the team, absolutely not, he said on his luxury yacht Midlandia, named after the Midland company which has extensive interests throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 

I was asked theoretically whether it is possible that I would sell the team and I said that everything is for sale. We buy businesses, we sell businesses, we buy companies and we sell companies. 

At the end of the day we are an investment company so obviously things could be sold if the right amount is being offered. But nobody offered me anything. There is nothing going on so I dont know where this is coming from. 

Former Grand Prix driver Eddie Irvine, apparently with a wealthy Russian investor in tow, has appeared at three races in a row and has been linked to a possible takeover of the Toyota-powered team. 

Shnaider denied talks with the Northern Irishman and said that his own plan to rename the team Midland from 2006 was continuing as scheduled. Everything is still going on according to plan, the car is being developed, everything is going forward, he said. 

The team boss responded to rumours that the Silverstone-based team, whose drivers are Indian Narain Karthikeyan and Portugals Tiago Monteiro, was being pursued by suppliers for unpaid bills. 

We got the company (when it was) in a huge mess, he said. There are all kinds of payables that we had no idea about. There were a lot of suppliers that were trying to take advantage when the management changed. 

Everybody at the end of the day is getting paid but obviously we dont want to pay every bill that is coming our way that we think is out of nowhere. (Reuters)

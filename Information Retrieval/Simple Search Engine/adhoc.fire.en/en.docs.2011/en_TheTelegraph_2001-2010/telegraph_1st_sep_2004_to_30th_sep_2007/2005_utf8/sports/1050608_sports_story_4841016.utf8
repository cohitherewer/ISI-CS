The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI not amused

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which has consistently backed Harbhajan Singh, hasnt been amused by his chucking-act last Saturday. 

Somebody in the BCCI is going to talk to Harbhajan? He has just been conditionally cleared and its stupid to throw ? whatever the circumstances, a very influential BCCI member told The Telegraph. 

Harbhajan, it may be recalled, was no-balled by (former England player) Peter Willey on the last day of the Surrey versus Warwickshire County Championship match. 

The off-spinner, making his debut for London-headquartered Surrey, apparently chucked out of frustration. 

Thankfully, the England and Wales Cricket Board decided not to probe Harbhajans action.

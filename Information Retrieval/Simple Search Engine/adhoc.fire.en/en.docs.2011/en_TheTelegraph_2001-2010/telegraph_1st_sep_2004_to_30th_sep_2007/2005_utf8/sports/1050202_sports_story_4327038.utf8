The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No more, says Hingis after defeat

Pattaya: Martina Hingis said she had no plans to play more tournaments after her 6-1, 2-6, 2-6 defeat to German Marlene Weingartner at the Thailand Open on Tuesday. 

?I?ve never had plans further than this step. Maybe I?ll play some exhibitions. That?s my plan at the moment. At this point I have no plans to play any more tournaments,? she said. 

Hingis was on top for the first set against a player ran-ked 73 in the world. However, her service began to deteriorate in the second set and Wei-ngartner took advantage of a series of lightweight returns. 

In the third set, an increasingly listless Hingis fell behind 0-1 with a netted double-handed backhand and a blistering backhand winner down the line gave Weingartner a further break for 4-1. A netted Hingis forehand ended her hopes of victory. 

India?s Shikha Uberoi, who did well to qualify for the main draw, went down fighting to Conchita Martinez. The Spaniard won 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Triple suspension will send the right message

 Stickwork 

Gurbux Singh

(From top) Daljit Singh Dhillon, Gagan Ajit Singh 

and Kanwalpreet Singh have rightly been disciplined for misconduct

Three top players of the country have been suspended 

for misbehaviour. I would want to call this a disciplining instead, for misconduct. 

Without going into the merits of the cases, I would like to emphasise that for 

nearly two decades this public show of temper and charging and chasing the umpire 

in protest has grown into a new phenomenon.

Also, off-the-ball fights among players, even beyond 

match duration, is becoming an epidemic of sorts. It is not restricted to the 

top few players or teams. It is also coming into local hockey meets, so much so 

that Indian teams ? as I have mentioned many times before ? at all levels are 

being branded as the bad boys of world hockey.

For the record, Punjab Police defender Kanwalpreet 

Singh was suspended for two years for attacking Deepak Thakur during a domestic 

competition last month. Thakur had to be hospitalised. Then star national forward 

Gagan Ajit Singh and Daljit Singh Dhillon were suspended for three months and 

six months, respectively, for assaulting Indian Oil Corporation player Vikramjit 

Singh during the recent national hockey championship in Hyderabad. 

What hit people straight in the heart was that all 

three have been national stars, so to say.

There was a time when Pakistan, too, were in the same 

league. However, after the 1972 Munich Olympic fiasco ? where they showed their 

frustration against the umpire?s decision after losing to Germany in the final, 

even snatching the silver medals and putting them in their slippers (an incident 

I was a stunned witness to) ? they changed. 

The whole Pakistan team was banned for a year (later 

reduced after top-level intervention and apologies) and they learned a lesson 

they did not forget. I sincerely hope that such a day shouldn?t come for India 

when they have to learn a lesson in discipline through such an ugly incident.

It really pains me to see Indian players being suspended. 

It is simple logic. If you play with ten or nine men, you just can?t win.

This tendency has to be curbed in India itself. And 

strict action has to be taken during all domestic tourneys. In that respect, these 

suspensions will send the right message to the players and help Indian hockey 

at the international level.

I am worried, because the malady has hit juniors as 

well. It happened in the last two junior meets, in Lahore and in Kuala Lumpur. 

There we lost matches through yellow cards we got because the players misbehaved. 

In Kuala Lumpur, in one of the matches, two top players were suspended and consequently 

India lost the match.

The IHF has made a good beginning in sending out a 

strong message to the hockey players in general. Unfortunately, in one of these 

recent incidents the players involved may have brought to field some personal 

rivalry: all of them are from Punjab. Despite that, this is a good move.

I do seriously believe that without anger and such 

strong passionate emotions, no player is worth his salt to play at the international 

level. But how the player channelises such strong emotions is important. Whether 

he uses it to charge and chase the umpire, or to charge himself up to bring out 

his best to help the team. The later, of course, helps. But if that anger is taken 

out on the opponents or the umpires, it not only destroys the player?s own game 

but also proves to be negative for the team.

The captain, coach and manager have a very crucial 

role in this. I remember some years back, I was manager of the Indian team at 

the Azlan Shah meet. Right from the first two matches the Indian team, with all 

the stars included, was being branded as the bad boys of the meet. In fact, in 

the second match, two players, including the captain got yellow. One of our seniormost 

players was walking away off the field with the team.

As manager I rushed to the sidelines and told them 

to get back to the ground. Some players said ?how can we play with nine people?? 

I said you will jolly well play with nine people. We won that match. Later I sent 

a clear message to the team: any further charging and chasing of the umpire, and 

the player concerned will no more be playing for the country. 

I am proud to say today, that with the co-operation 

of the players not one more yellow card came to India and we came back with the 

Fairplay Trophy. 

One must understand that the umpire, too, is human. 

If he gets wind that he is treating with a bad bunch, he could even come out with 

stiffer penalties than usual.

A player must understand that an international umpire, 

in an international arena, will not change his decision once he has given it. 

To claim is legitimate, but to protest is not.

The nation?s pride and honour has to be uppermost, 

to be accepted internationally and to regain international glory.

Nagpur: Central Zone regained the Duleep Trophy after five seasons when they beat holders North Zone by nine wickets in a low-scoring final. 

The five-day match ended in under two-and-a-half days at the VCA Stadium on Thursday. 

Seasoned campaigners Sanjay Bangar (62 not out) and Mohammed Kaif (48 not out) guided Central to their target of 141 with an unbroken 89-run stand. Central had sealed their fifth crown 10 minutes before lunch. 

Starting Day III without a run on the board, Central lost opener Naman Ojha for 26 after he had put on 52 for the first wicket with Bangar. North didn?t have any more success as India discard Bangar and ODI regular Kaif stood firm. 

Bangar batted patiently after excelling with the ball (three for 39 in the second innings) to be a big stumbling block for 16-time winners North. Bangar?s 108-ball essay was laced with eight fours and two sixes. 

Kaif showed his maturity with another responsible knock. 

He played some crisp drives during his 55-ball knock and attributed the victory to an excellent team effort and good fielding. Asked about the bowler-friendly pitch, Kaif said playing on such seaming wickets was a ?great learning experience?. 

He added that juniors must be encouraged to play on such wickets. 

?Wickets of such nature are rare in India and hence such opportunities must be experienced by all upcoming juniors, particularly against the moving ball,? said Kaif. ?It?s good for the future of Indian cricket.?

 Season opens with erring pros in dock 

 STAR RACER

 With the opening of two enquiries against erring professionals, the RCTC stewards gave a broad hint on Thursday, Day I of the monsoon season, that they meant business in the weeks to follow. G. Ross had scored a quick double ? through Royal Valour and Shes All That ? which the visiting jockey could not have, had fellow-riders Phillip Alford (on Ocean Spirit) and Gajender (Pay Check) been sincere on their mounts. Alford was stood down for 25 days, while Gajender was warned severely. Incidentally, both jockeys were doing duty for trainer Daniel David.

 The shaken up stables of Daniel David and Errol Bhungard decided to call it a day, leaving the stage open for the lesser mortals. That left the likes of Jaiswals, Stephens and Javeds to reap the afternoons harvest.

 Jockey Mohammed Amil should have also been brought to book, but the trainer Tarak Nath Jaiswal-retained riders misadventure went unnoticed. 

 Amil was the key player in stablemate El Cids victory in the feature event, the 1,200m Zipper Cup. He sent Common Spirit into the lead only to take most in the field sufficiently wide at the final turn. His manoeuvrings allowed El Cid to make a dramatic entry, seeking the rail-side wide gap, from the rear of the field. El Cid was sent to the start as almost a joint favourite with Daniel Davids Magical Strike who, incidentally, was the chief sufferer at the home turn because of Amils tactics.

 But Jaiswal needs to be complimented for turning an unreliable Shes A Star into a disciplined baby. Ironically, it was Amil who helped the six-year-old mare to enter the winners enclosure, and the two-length defeat she handed to rank-outsider Poetic Moment could have been increased substantially had Amil desired. 

 In the same race Regal Successors runaway lead from the start hardly helped his cause. The Errol Bhungard-ward petered out expectedly passing the 300m marker. A heavily fancied Generous Gift, on the other hand, was never in the race from the word go. The fashionably bred four-year-old, by Steinbeck out of Tick Tock, struck to the wrong end of the field to improve somewhat in the stretch run.

 The Daniel-ward was clearly in need of this run and he may repay following.

 John Stephens Secret Desire upset the short-priced runner Wayward Kings applecart. The favourite, also from Daniels yard, was up with the winner but failed to produce extra bit of steam when asked to do so. He went down in a close contest. Destinys Trick was also in the betting but the F. Rodrigues gelding was simply outclassed by the fighting duo to end up third.

 Flossy relished the scurry and it hardly came as a surprise when Javed Khans aged mare put her best foot forward in the 1,000m Pickwick Handicap. She was ridden in a check behind Generous Gesture and Over The Rainbow but let off the steam below the distance post to leave all struggling.

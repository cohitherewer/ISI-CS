 AFI may extend Neelam deadline 

 - Appeal against suspension

New Delhi: The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) is mulling extending the deadline for discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh to allow her appeal against the suspension for failing a dope test during the World Athletics Championships in Helsinki earlier this month. 

The 14-day period provided to her to register her appeal ends on Tuesday and the AFI has not received any formal communication from Neelam in this regard. 

She has told us informally that she will go for an appeal against her suspension but to my knowledge, we have not received anything in writing yet, AFI secretary Lalit Bhanot said. 

We can even consider extending the deadline if the athlete asks for it, Bhanot said. 

However, the deadline for filing an appeal can be extended only with the approval of the world governing body, International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), he said. 

The AFI has formed a panel to look into the doping charges levelled against Neelam but the formal announcement in this regard cannot be made till the athlete appeals for a hearing. 

Bhanot, who is leaving for Incheon, South Korea, the venue for the Asian Athletics Championships starting Thursday, said any decision on the hearing would be taken only after his return on Monday next. 

The 34-year-old Neelam, who failed to make the final in Helsinki, tested positive for banned stimulant pemoline on August 7 during an in-competition test. Following the B sample test which also turned positive, the IAAF provisionally suspended Neelam. 

The IAAF announced on Monday that Neelam and hammer thrower Vladyslav Piskunov of Ukraine provided the only positive tests at the World Athletics Championships.

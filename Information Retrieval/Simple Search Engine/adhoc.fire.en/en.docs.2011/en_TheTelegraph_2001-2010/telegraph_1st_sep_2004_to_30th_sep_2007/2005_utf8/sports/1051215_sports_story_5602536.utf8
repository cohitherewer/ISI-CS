 Seles gives herself one more year

New York: Monica Seles said if she doesnt get back on the tennis court by the end of 2006, she may hang up her racket. 

Seles, a nine-time Grand Slam winner, attended a Manhattan luncheon in her honour on Tuesday at a restaurant owned by actor Robert de Niro. Shes joining the Laureus World Sports Academy, which brings sports and social programmes to underprivileged youth around the world. 

It may prove to be a transition into another career. Seles never officially retired, but last played a Grand Slam tournament in 2003. A broken bone in her right foot has hampered her return. 

Im still training and still trying, but at the same time Im realistic, Seles said. After 2006, if not, then its pretty sure. You have to move on. 

Seles, a dominant player known for her loud grunts during play, won three Grand Slam tournaments in both 1991 and 1992. Her meteoric rise was interrupted in 1993 when she was stabbed in the back by an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf at a tournament in Hamburg. Seles was ranked No. 1 at the time. 

I had a very unusual career, to say the least, she said. I had some highs and lows. But at the end of the day, I got to do something I loved to do. As a little girl, how I started playing tennis was very simple. That part, Im proud to say, has never changed. To me, I get a great joy just hitting the ball. 

The 32-year-old put no timeline on a return in 2006. 

My game is not at the level that I personally feel comfortable playing against the girls, she said. Its my foot. The consistency is just not there.

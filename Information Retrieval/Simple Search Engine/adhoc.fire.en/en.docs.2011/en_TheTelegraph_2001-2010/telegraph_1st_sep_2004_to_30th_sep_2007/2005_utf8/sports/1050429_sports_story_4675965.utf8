 Fayetteville: Tunney Hunsaker, who lost to Muhammad Ali in the boxing great?s first professional fight, has died. He was 75. Hunsaker died on Monday at an extended care home after a long battle with Alzheimer?s disease, according to Dodd-Payne-Hess funeral home.

 Hunsaker was Fayetteville?s police chief when he lost a decision to then 18-year-old Cassius Clay, at Louisville?s Freedom Hall on October 29, 1960. Hunsaker was a journeyman heavyweight who had fought more than 30 bouts.

 Hunsaker and Ali stayed in contact throughout the years and Ali attended Hunsaker?s police retirement party in Fayetteville. His wife Patricia, a daughter and a son survive Hunsaker. In Hunsaker?s final fight, in 1961, Joe ?Shotgun? Sheldon landed a 10th-round punch that sent him into a coma for nine days and required him to have two operations on his brain.

 London: Japanese billionaire Yoshiaki Tsutsumi has quit his role as honour member of the International Olympic Committee, the IOC said on Wednesday.

 The 70-year-old, once the world?s richest man, was suspended from the body last week pending an inquiry by the organisation?s Ethics Commission.

 Tsutsumi was arrested in his homeland last month on suspicion of fraud and insider trading after it was revealed that his Seibu Railway company had submitted false reports on its ownership structure for decades.

 The IOC said Tsutsumi had written to their Lausanne headquarters informing them of his decision. The IOC accepted it and said that ends the procedure before the Ethics Commission.

 Nagpur: The Usha School of Athletics, set up by P.T. Usha, has set its eyes on the 2012 Olympics. ?Currently there are eight girls undergoing training at the school in Kinalur near Kozhikode,? Usha, here to promote athletics for a private company, told reporters on Thursday. Four more girls are likely to be enrolled, Usha said, adding: ?India has enough talent in athletics. What we require is extra-ordinary talent to live up to expectations at the international level, particularly the Asian Games and Olympics.?

 London: Former Olympic and world 100m champion Maurice Greene will run for the US in a team event against Britain and Russia in Glasgow on June 5.

 Greene, 30, finished third in last year?s Olympic final in Athens.

 ?I?m aiming to regain my world 100 metres title later this year,? Greene said in a statement on Thursday. ?I know I have what it takes to add a fourth 100 metres world gold medal to my collection.? 

 Cape Town: World high jump champion Jacques Freitag has been included in a provisional 15-member South Africa team named on Thursday for the world athletics championships in Helsinki in August.

 Freitag missed out during last year?s Olympic Games due to an ankle injury. 

 Mumbai: National No. 1 Sourav Ghosal and women?s top seed Joshna Chinappa, both from Chennai, will defend their titles in the Indian Oil-Otters Open squash tournament to be held here from May 1 to 7. Ghosal will defend the boys? under-19 title too.

 Rupesh Roy clinches title

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After two quarter-final appearances in ITF junior Grade II meets in Pretoria, Rupesh Roy won a Grade IV title in Windhoek (Namibia), last Sunday, without dropping a set. 

According to information received here, the Indian teenager overcame top-seeded Namibian Jurgens Strydom 6-3, 6-3 in the final. Rupesh, seeded No.2, had got a bye in the first round before sweeping past four South African opponents in straight sets. 

The title will further help Rupesh ? who is based at Bostons Bosse Foundation ? earn a direct entry to the main draw of the boys singles of the US Open starting in New York later this month.

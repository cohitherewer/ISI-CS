 Bermuda in Indias group

London: Bermuda, who finished fourth in the ongoing ICC Trophy in Ireland, will feature in Indias group at the 2007 World Cup cricket championship in the Caribbean. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will be the other teams in group 2. 

Canada, who beat Bermuda by five wickets on Monday to clinch third place, will find themselves in group 3 along with England, New Zealand and Kenya. 

Also on Monday, Holland bagged the fifth and final qualifying spot after thrashing the UAE by 145 runs. The Dutch thus joined Bermuda, Canada, Ireland and Scotland as the qualifiers who will rub shoulders with the 11 teams with ODI status. 

Ireland and Scotland will meet in the final to decide which team gets the status of qualifier No. 1. 

It will be Hollands second consecutive World Cup appearance, and third in all (they featured in the 1996 meet co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). 

Having narrowly missed out on qualification during the group stage, Holland bounced back with two emphatic victories to seal their entry. The Dutch first beat Denmark by 89 runs on Saturday and proved far too strong for the UAE under a cloudless sky on Monday. 

THE GROUPINGS 

Group 1: Australia, South Africa, Ireland/Scotland, Holland. Group 2: Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Bermuda. Group 3: New Zealand, England, Kenya, Canada. Group 4: Pakistan, West Indies, Zimbabwe, Ireland/Scotland.

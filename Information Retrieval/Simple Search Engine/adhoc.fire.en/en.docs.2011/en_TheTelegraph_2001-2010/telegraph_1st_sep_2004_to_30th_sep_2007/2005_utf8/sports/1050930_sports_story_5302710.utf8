 Warne hopes to save marriage

 Shane Warne in Melbourne on Thursday 

Melbourne: Shane Warne arrived back from his English county cricket commitments Thursday still determined to save his marriage. 

Warne and wife, Simone, announced their separation on June 25 after Warnes alleged involvement in several highly publicised sex scadals. 

Warne Thursday pleaded for privacy from the Australian media while he tried to settle his personal issues, saying he had spoken to his wife and children at least twice a day since they returned to Australia. 

Its not an easy situation to be in. Its something I havent experienced before in my life, Warne said. I tried to concentrate as hard as I could when I was at the cricket ground but away from that there were some tough times. 

Warne said the Australian media hounded him more than the notorious British press, and urged them to give him privacy. 

Hopefully you guys will respect that and leave us alone, not following us and camping outside our house but I doubt it, he said. I doubt whether you guys will, so that will probably make it harder. 

Warne, 36, said he could be coming to the end of his dazzling international career, saying the constant travel was beginning to wear on him. 

I enjoyed living in England but I have to weigh up the whole package, the travel and so on, said Warne, Test crickets all-time leading wicket-taker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kumble in for last two ODIs

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: Anil Kumble makes a return to the 

squad for the last two one-dayers against Pakistan. The selectors met after the 

match Tuesday and did not include Sourav Ganguly following the ban. 

Rahul Dravid will lead the side in Sourav?s absence. 

Irfan Pathan has also been omitted. Sridharan Sriram, who claimed five wickets including a hattrick in the semi-finals of the national one-dayers, has been recalled. 

For Kumble it was a return of sorts after being out of the one-day squad since the Bangladesh series. With the pitches favouring spinners in the current series, the selectors decided in utilising the leggie?s experience. 

The selectors also felt Pathan needed a break after failing to make much of an impact with the ball. 

THE SQUAD 

Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Sridharan Sriram, Dinesh Mongia, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Zaheer Khan, Murali Kartik, Anil Kumble, Ajit Agarkar, Ashish Nehra.

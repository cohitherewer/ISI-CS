 Lee poised to return

 - Tuffey faces misconduct charge, dropped 

 Lee has been outstanding so far, feels Ponting

Wellington: Australia are considering bringing back express paceman Brett Lee for the first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch which starts on Thursday. 

Lee has not played a Test in more than 14 months but is poised to return after terrorising the Black Caps in the recent one-day series. 

Captain Ricky Ponting said on Wednesday that the team would not be finalised until the morning of the match. However, he said Lee?s form in the one-day series, which Australia won 5-0, was a compelling reason to include him. ?I think at the moment that Brett?s got a bit of a psychological edge over some of the New Zealand batsmen,? said Ponting. 

With Sha ne Warne the lone spinner and fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie almost assured of their places, Lee is vying with Michael Kasprowicz for the third paceman?s role. 

Kasprowicz has kept his place over the past year with a series of strong performances but Lee?s superior form in the one-day arena is expected to sway the selectors. 

?Brett?s been outstanding on this tour,? Ponting said.?I know if I was in their (New Zealand?s) side and in their shoes and looked at a team sheet and saw his name wasn?t on it, I think I would be reasonably relieved.? 

Favourites Australia are at full-strength for the three-match series, with opening batsman Matthew Hayden cleared to play after injuring his shoulder in the one-dayers. 

New Zealand have several players out through injury and discarded paceman Daryl Tuffey facing a misconduct charge over an off-the-field incident. 

Coach John Bracewell resisted the temptation to name two spinners on a pitch likely to turn when he overlooked Paul Wiseman for paceman Iain O?Brien, one of two uncapped players in the team. 

Craig Cumming will also make his Test debut, opening the batting with skipper Stephen Fleming, who has promoted himself up the order from number three. ?I think when the team needs it most, the captain should stand up,? Fleming said. 

Bracewell admitted he was concerned about the mental state of his team after their poor form in Tests over the past year and the one-day drubbing they took from Australia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I will make my mark on this tour: Kaneria

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Danish Kaneria celebrates the dismissal of V.V.S. Laxman on Friday 

Chandigarh: Danish Kaneria believes daughter Parisa, who was born just a few days before he departed for the tour, has brought him luck. And he wants to dedicate his six for 150 to the kid. 

The leg-spinner was touted to be Pakistan?s trumpcard on this series and he proved his worth with his ninth five-wicket haul in the very first opportunity. He is, though, not willing to rest on past laurels. 

?I will make my mark on this tour... I wish to see myself being compared with the best in business. People should know me by my deeds? By the end of my career, I will be on the top. That?s my aim,? Kaneria said. 

His words can be construed as arrogance. But the 25-year-old is just like that. He refuses to be bogged down by failures and can get head-on with his more fancied rivals. 

?Sachin (Tendulkar) is a world-class player. When he was given not out after inside-edging a ball on the third day, I got aggressive. I thought, he is a great batsman, but let me also show my class. It was a good contest.? 

So, what does he regard as his strengths? ?Well, for any leg-spinner, it?s his variety. I rely on my leg breaks, and when I need to, I bowl my googly and flipper,? he said. 

Did he speak to any former leg-spinner, someone like Abdul Qadir, who has the experience of bowling on these conditions before departing on this tour? ?No,? he replied. 

?I was practicing in Karachi and did not take anyone?s help. I had the confidence in myself. The only thing I did was to watch closely the video clippings of the last India-Australia series here.? 

?Actually the series in Australia before this tour helped me a lot. My confidence was boosted when I realised that if I can get the Australians out, the Indians should not be a problem. The Aussies are the world champions.? 

Which of the six wickets was the most memorable? ?The wickets of Sourav and Laxman gave me the most satisfaction? They are very good players of spin and to fool them gave a lot of pleasure,? he told The Telegraph. 

Kaneria is, however, silent on the mystery ball which he had promised to unleash on this tour. ?I didn?t bowl it in this match. Maybe I won?t bowl it on the tour. Let?s see?? 

He said that he learnt the googly all by himself and there is no one as such who can take credit in his career. ?I practised for hours and that?s how I mastered it?. 

Did he have any special strategy or mental preparation before arriving on this tour considering the best of leggies have failed here? ?If I tell you that, how will I bowl,? he quipped, before adding, ?I?m not afraid of failures. They are part and parcel of cricket. Failures don?t put me under excessive pressure.? 

Finally, what are his thoughts on the final day? ?Both the unbeaten batsmen are experienced. Razzaq and Akmal are good, they have made big scores in the past. If they spend some time at the crease, the runs will come, and we can put pressure on India,? he hoped.

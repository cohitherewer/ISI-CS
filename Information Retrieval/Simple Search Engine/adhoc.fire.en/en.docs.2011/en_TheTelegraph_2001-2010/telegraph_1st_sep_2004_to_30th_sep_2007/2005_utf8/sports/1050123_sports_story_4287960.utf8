The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sania scales popularity charts

 Maria Sharapova 

Melbourne: Sania Mirza might have lost to Serena Williams but there is another stage of the Australian Open where she has outscored the American superstar, even as the Grand Slam organisers soak up the fresh fragrance the Indian teen sensation has brought to the 100-year-old sporting event. 

The 18-year-old Indian won thousands of hearts at the Vodafone Arena with her gutsy performance while going down to Williams in the third round Friday, but the ?virtual impact? she has had on the year?s first Grand Slam event has crossed the million mark. 

Officially, the Australian Open website has registered 1.1 million hits so far and Sania?s is the second most visited page in the women?s section. Only Russian Maria Sharapova ranks above her. 

Sania has left in her wake Serena, Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova and Michaella Krajicek of the Netherlands (sister of former Wimbledon Richard Krajicek) in the top five women?s pages. 

Among the men, Swiss phenomenon Roger Federer tops the list followed by the evergreen Andre Agassi, young guns Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt, and the mercurial Marat Safin. 

The breaching of million mark makes it a 53 percent increase on traffic registered for the same period last year, the organisers said. 

Repeat visitors to the official website of the Australian 

Open, which is celebrating its centenary year, were up by 36 percent and more 

than 41-million page views have been recorded already, an increase of over 20 

percent during the same period. 

Tennis Australia identified the increased volume of traffic from the Asian region. Japan continued to top the list of countries from the continent logging on, with people from India and China among the top five. 

The increased interest from world?s two most populous nations has been attributed to the success of Sania, who became the first Indian woman to reach the third round in a Grand Slam, and the emergence of several talented Chinese players including Li Na who actually beat the Indian in the singles final of the Asian Tennis Championships (ATC) in Tashkent last year. 

And if one were to go by the logic that those accessing Sania?s page would have also visited Serena?s, to whom she eventually lost, the American does owe something to her vanquished rival. 

For Tennis Australia, the main draw wild card to the ATC winner (Sania got it despite being runner-up because Li Na gained a direct entry) justified their decision to project the event as ?the Grand Slam of Asia-Pacific?.

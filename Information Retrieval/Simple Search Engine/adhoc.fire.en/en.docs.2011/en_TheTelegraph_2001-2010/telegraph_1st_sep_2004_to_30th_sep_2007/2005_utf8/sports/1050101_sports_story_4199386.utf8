The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Another landmark for Utpal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Utpal Chatterjee, who broke his retirement and came to Bengal?s rescue for just one match, got his 500th wicket Friday. He broke the 142-run stand between Syed Abbas Ali and Naman Ojha, when he had Ojha caught by Sourav Ganguly at slip. 

But the 42-year-old seemed unmoved even after achieving the feat and becoming Bengal?s first to reach the landmark. ?I am not at all bothered by the record, I will be happy if Bengal can save relegation,? Utpal said. 

Utpal also has one landmark to reach if he manages to scalps six more wickets. Utpal?s Ranji Trophy scalp now is 394. Another six in the match could make him the first to take 400 from Bengal. Utpal was not satisfied with the day?s proceedings and said that one more wicket could have made things easier for Bengal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mourinho and his ?three leaders? 

 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 

- Chelsea will need the bonding to stop Barcelona 

'Henry Winter

 Mourinho?s team is a blend of inheritance and investment 

Anyone believing Chelsea?s players now walk along a boulevard of broken dreams should think again. Anyone expecting white flags never made acquaintance with Frank Lampard, John Terry or Claude Makelele, the men Jose Mourinho calls his ?leaders?. Nor with winners like another Chelsea trio, Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira or Petr Cech. 

Mourinho?s players soothed their bruises and licked their wounds at their Spanish retreat Monday, resting up after the second-string?s FA Cup elimination at Newcastle United and beginning to focus on Wednesday?s Champions League date at Barcelona. 

Scarcely seven months after he assumed control, Mourinho?s team is inevitably a new blend of inheritance and investment but it is difficult to see the joint. 

The unity of these sporting strangers has been astonishing. Chelsea will need that togetherness now, as they put aside painful thoughts of absent friends and try to stifle the many creative zephyrs blowing their way in Catalonia. 

From Brazil comes in the fluid form of Ronaldinho, from Portugal in the cunning guise of Deco and from France in the deft touch and movement of Ludovic Giuly. And then there is the sleek tornado from Africa, Samuel Eto?o. 

If Chelsea can withstand these unrelenting squalls in the Nou Camp, keeping the tie alive for the March 8 home leg, it will be tribute to the bonding generated when first assembled by Mourinho on last summer?s trip to the United States. 

Fresh from his Champions League triumph with Porto, Mourinho sat down with his new players and talked to successful European campaigners like Makelele and Ferreira and those like Terry and Lampard, who dream of silverware. Conversation turned to Chelsea?s ambitions for the season. 

Mourinho recalled the hugely significant moment. ?The message that came very clearly is that while Chelsea are a club full of stars and rich players, only Makelele and the ones I brought from Porto have won titles,? Mourinho said. ?The others, zero. When I said that to them, they said, ?You are right; it?s true?.? Mourinho looked at Terry and Lampard. ?If I?m right, why didn?t you win anything?? he challenged them about their lack of trophies under his predecessor Claudio Ranieri. ?And if I?m right, why don?t you try to follow my concepts and projects?? 

Their pride and desire stirred, Terry and Lampard bought immediately into Mourinho?s grand design, reading eagerly his book of commandments for players. ?I now have a very ambitious squad,? Mourinho said. ?They are crazy to win something important.? 

So when Ronaldinho, Deco and Co. come calling, Mourinho will expect his ?three team leaders? to stand firm. 

Two Englishmen set the tone, inspiring colleagues through word and deed. ?Psychologically, the leaders are Terry and Lampard,? Mourinho explained. ?Tactically the leader for the organisation is Makelele.? 

Chelsea have not made so many great strides as a sporting force this season to remain prostrate after tripping up at St James?. The links between Makelele, Terry, Lampard and the rest has been witnessed and strengthened at such famous points on the English compass as Ewood, Goodison and Anfield. 

Chelsea face a serious inquisition Wednesday, but their spirit is not in question.

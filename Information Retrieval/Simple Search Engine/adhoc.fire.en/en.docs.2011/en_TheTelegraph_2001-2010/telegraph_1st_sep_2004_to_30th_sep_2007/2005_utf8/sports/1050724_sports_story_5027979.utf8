The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BASA kept reports under wraps

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Bengal Amateur Swimming Association (BASA) has suspended 27 boys and girls who were recently found overaged. Thirteen of them were from the state squad for last months sub-junior nationals (in Trivandrum) and the rest from the squad for the junior nationals held in the city earlier this month. 

According to a BASA official, the medical reports of the 13 sub-junior swimmers were made available a day after the squad left for Trivandrum. None of them was allowed to take part in the meet. 

The 14 guilty juniors were, however, fielded at the Calcutta nationals despite the reports pronouncing them overaged being delivered before the meet got underway on July 3. According to a source, this was done to ensure the spotlight didnt get deflected to a controversy, thereby embarrassing the hosts. The BASA has decided to give the cheats a chance to defend themselves by constituting an arbitration panel.

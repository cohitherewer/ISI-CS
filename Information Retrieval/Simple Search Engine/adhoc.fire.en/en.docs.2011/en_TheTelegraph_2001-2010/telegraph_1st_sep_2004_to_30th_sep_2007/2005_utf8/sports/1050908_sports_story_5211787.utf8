 London: Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes has been named in the England squad for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next February. Holmes, who won gold medals in the 800m and 1,500m in Athens last year, was ruled out of last month?s World Championships in Helsinki with an Achilles tendon problem. If she competes, it will mark her final appearance on the track, but the former Army sergeant had refused to speculate on her chances of making it to Australia after pulling up during the 800m at the British Grand Prix in Sheffield last month.

 Cape Town: Ettienne Botha, a centre with South African Super 12 team The Bulls, died in a car crash early on Wednesday, police said. The 26-year-old was the only person in the vehicle when it veered off the road and rolled near his home in Pretoria. He died on the spot. He was a regular member of the Bulls Super 12 team.

 Cologne: Seven-time European No.1 Colin Montgomerie will miss the World Cup of Golf for the sixth year in a row, the 42-year-old Briton said on Wednesday. Montgomerie, who won the individual title when the two-man team event was held at Kiawah Island in 1997, said ?commitments? in Asia made it impossible for him to represent Scotland at this year?s edition.

 Cologne: World No.6 Sergio Garcia has been fined by the European Tour following an incident at last week?s European Masters at Crans-sur-Sierre in Switzerland.

 The 25-year-old Spaniard was punished after being reported for kicking an advertising board after he three-putted the 17th during the third round. 

 Although the level of the fine was not disclosed by the European Tour on Wednesday, it is believed to be in the region of ?5,000 ($9,220).

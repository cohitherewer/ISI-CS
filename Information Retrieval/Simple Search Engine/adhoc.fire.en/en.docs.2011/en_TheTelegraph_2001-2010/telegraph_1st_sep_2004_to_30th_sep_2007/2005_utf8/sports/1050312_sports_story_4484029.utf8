 Campbell in driver?s seat 

Toronto: Chad Campbell fired a sizzling eight-under-par 64 to grab a two-stroke lead over fellow American Brett Wetterich after the first round of the $5.5 million Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens in Florida on Thursday. 

Fiji?s Vijai Singh, who surrendered the world number one ranking to Tiger Woods at the Doral Open last Sunday, had to be content with a one-under-par round at the Country Club at Mirasol. 

Singh was joined on 71 by Davis Love III, runner-up the last two years, world No. 7 David Toms, winner of the WGC-Match Play Championship two weeks ago, and 2008 European Ryder Cup captain Nick Faldo, making his first appearance on the 2005 PGA Tour. 

Campbell, who led through much of last month?s rain-hit Nissan Open only to lose to Australian Adam Scott in a playoff, racked up eight birdies, an eagle and two bogeys on the Sunrise course to rocket to the top of the leaderboard.

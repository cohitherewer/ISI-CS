The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thursday, November 17, 2005 

 Berlin: Former heavyweight WBC champion Vitali Klitschko, who announced his retirement last week due to persistent injuries, admits he would return to the ring for a rematch with former champion Lennox Lewis.

 The 34-year-old Ukrainian hung up his gloves after torn knee ligaments forced him to cancel his mandatory defence against Hasim Rahman. Lewis stopped Klitschko on cuts in their WBC title fight in June 2003, although the latter was ahead on points.

 ?There is one thing that I feel I still have to do and that is gain revenge over Lennox Lewis,? Klitschko said. ?If Lewis came back, I would find the motivation to return to boxing and beat him.?

 Lewis, now 40, retired as world champion after defeating Klitschko in six rounds and has not signalled an intention to lace up his gloves again. 

 New Delhi: Jaisa Orchatteri bagged two gold medals as the Indian contingent continued its excellent performance at the inaugural Asian Indoor Games in Bangkok.

 Jaisa clinched gold in women?s 1500m and 3000m to take India?s tally to 11, including six golds, a release from the Indian Olympic Association said on Wednesday. Ghamanda Ram and S. Chanti won the men?s and women?s 800m, respectively, while the women?s relay team grabbed the 4x400m gold.

 The other gold went to Navpreet Singh in men?s shot put. In swimming, Arjun Muralidharan won a silver in men?s 200m butterfly while Shikha Tandon got bronze in women?s 100m backstroke.

 Athens: An Athens prosecutor has called for disgraced Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou to stand trial on charges of avoiding doping tests on the eve of the 2004 Olympics and faking a motorcycle accident hours later.

 Prosecutor Andreas Karaflos also recommended that coach Christos Tzekos ? who trained both athletes at the time -? should stand trial, along with two state hospital doctors and at least two people suspected of misleading authorities investigating the case.

 The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum penalty of two years in prison. A three-member council of judges is expected to rule on Karafls? recommendation early next year.

 Frankfurt: Bayern Munich have agreed a three-year contract extension with injured striker Roque Santa Cruz.

 The Paraguay international will not play again until April 2006 at the earliest after undergoing cruciate knee ligament surgery in the United States. The injury had put a question mark over his future with Bayern, with his contract due to expire at the end of the season.

 Bayern look set to lose Michael Ballack in June after withdrawing their offer of a new deal to the Germany captain and the Bundesliga champions have several more urgent cases. 

 Sydney: The coach of Olympic champion Ian Thorpe said she did not expect not too much from her swimmer when he makes a return to competition this week after more than a year out of the sport.

 Thorpe will swim his first competitive event since the Athens Olympics at the World Cup short-course meeting in Sydney on November 19 and 20.

 Priority is to remain level-headed

Jamshedpur: It?s unusual, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni has asked his family to stay away even from his first India appearance in his home state ? Jharkhand. 

?Having the family around can only mean more pressure... Today, I don?t want an ounce extra of anything that may weigh me down,? Dhoni told The Telegraph during a chat at The Regent hotel on Thursday evening. 

In keeping with his ?approach?, Jharkhand?s sole India cricketer didn?t meet his parents (Pan and Devki) while passing through Ranchi on Wednesday afternoon. 

The state capital, of course, is Dhoni?s ?adopted? home town. In fact, sister Jayanti (who is married) also stays in Ranchi. Elder brother Narendra, though, is in Uttaranchal. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman has succeeded in asking his family to not turn up at the Keenan on Saturday, but ?close friends? are going to be there in strength. 

?I?m not answering my cell... I?ve kept it in the silent-mode and, by the afternoon, had received hundreds of missed calls... The SMSs, too, have been countless... However, I can?t really cut myself off from my closest friends,? Dhoni pointed out. 

He remarked the significance of having lashed 148 in the Vizag ODI didn?t take time to sink in. Yet, insisted he wasn?t ?living in the past.? 

Smiling, Dhoni added: ?I?ve got to be consistent... It?s a fact expectations have soared after one innings... It would have been very different had I scored just 48...? 

A lot of people are offering advice, but the 23-year-old?s priority is to remain level-headed: ?I?ve been so thus far in life. ... I?m confident nothing will change me.? 

Dhoni, who attracted the loudest cheers during the afternoon workout, has been approached by the Railways to withdraw his resignation. Only, he is intent on soaring with Indian Airlines. 

There?s talk that Bengal could ?tempt? him into seeking an inter-state transfer next season, but the emerging star indicated he wouldn?t like to ditch his parent state. 

In this age, that?s a nice sentiment.

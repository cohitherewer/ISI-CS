 Mukesh Kumar retains title

Chennai: Defending champion Mukesh Kumar not only retained his title but won it with a record to boot, finishing three strokes ahead of runner-up Vijay Kumar in the Hyundai-TNGF golf meet of the Amby Valley Indian PGA Tour on Saturday. 

Mukesh pocketed the prize money of Rs 1,58,200 along with the trophy for winning the four-round event with a tally of 23-under par 265, a course record. This erased the previous best by Ashok Kumar (21-under 267) set last year in the Hindu Open. 

A one-two finish by Mukesh and Vijay was on the cards before they teed off for the final round along with another contender S.S.P. Chowrasia. However, Mukeshs blitzkrieg put the others under tremendous pressure, which was ultimately reflected in their game. 

Mukesh got birdies on seven holes and parred the rest two for a seven under front nine total. He had a birdie on the par-3 151-yard 13th hole and was leading with an 18-under total, which he maintained till the 17th, where he duffed a shot for a bogey.

 West Indies make two changes

Bridgetown: The West Indies have made two changes in the squad for the fourth and final Test against South Africa starting in St John?s on Friday. Fast bowler Tino Best and allrounder Narsingh Deonarine have been recalled, at the expense of Reon King and Ryan Hinds. 

South Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. 

?We hope to salvage something from this series, as we look forward to the visit of the Pakistanis as well as the difficult tours to Sri Lanka and Australia later this year,? said West Indies chairman of selectors Joey Carew yesterday. ?Some people are advocating sweeping changes but that policy has never proven to be successful.?Best, who has 16 wickets in eight Tests, last played in the first match of the series against England in July, before a back injury sidelined him until February. He had to remodel his action and replace his boots. 

Deonarine made his debut in the drawn first Test against South Africa, taking two wickets with his off-spin, and scoring 15 in a handy partnership with Guyana teammate Shivnarine Chanderpaul. He was omitted from the next two Tests.

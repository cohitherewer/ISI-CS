 Polar Force has edge 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Polar Force and Gaslight look the best of the 40 and above rated runners to battle it out for the 1,400m Nagarahole Cup here on Friday. Both are blazing the track during their workouts. However, going by their previous starts over an identical distance, the one who looks to hold the edge, by his better timings, is the S. Ganapathy-ward Polar Force who will be ridden by B. Prakash.

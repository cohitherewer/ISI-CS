 All 5 ODIs may be day games

Thiruvananthapuram: All the five one-day International matches between India and Pakistan during the forthcoming series are likely to be day matches, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said Tuesday. 

A final decision on the venues would be taken at the programme and fixtures committee meeting in Mumbai on Thursday. The home and sports ministries will then clear the venues fixed by the committee. (PTI)

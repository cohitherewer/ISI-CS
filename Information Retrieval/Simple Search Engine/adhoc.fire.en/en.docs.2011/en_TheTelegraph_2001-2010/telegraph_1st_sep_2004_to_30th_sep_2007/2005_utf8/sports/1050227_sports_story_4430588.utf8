The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sporting down Salgaocar 1-0

 - National League - Goan outfit placed fifth after victory 

 Dudu scored the all-important goal 

Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa quelled a late resurgence to down Salgaocar SC by a solitary goal to score their third successive victory in the National Football League match here on Saturday. 

Dudu Omagbemi, who has been Sporting?s inspiration in the attack, scored the all-important goal in the seventh minute when he headed home a corner kick taken by Nicholas Rodrigues. 

The early goal demoralised Salgaocar?s spirit but Sporting, who had more of ball possession failed to convert the chances. 

Salgaocar, who failed to play an organised game in the first half, came back strongly in the last quarter of the match but lacked the finishing touches to draw level. 

Twice they came close to snatching a point but substitute Jerose Oliverira and Felix Ibrebru failed to convert the chances. 

The win took Sporting Clube to fifth place with 13 points from six matches while Salgaocar remained on 11 points from 10 matches. 

Dudu, who has scored six goals in the last three matches, combined with Man of the Match Edeh Chidi to mount pressure on the rival defence. 

Despite two chances Dudu failed to increase the lead, first missing to direct his header on target and later an open sitter as his chip over the onrushing ?keeper Juje Siddi went wide off the mark. 

Chidi who worked hard upfront saw his powerful shot saved by ?keeper Siddi. 

Salgaocar who played without any ideas in the first half came close to scoring in the dying minutes when Micky?s long ranger missed the target narrowly. 

The change of ends saw Salgaocar raising their game several notches as they tried hard to find the equaliser. 

Midway into the second-half, Salgaocar almost equalised when Rocus Lamare?s shot from inside the box was saved by Adewusi Adebayo. 

Sporting President Peter Vaz was delighted with his side?s third successive win after the team?s bus accident in Calcutta in January. 

Praising Dudu as the man behind the victories, Vaz said, ?his form is very important for us as we play East Bengal next?. (PTI)

 Indian hopes dashed

Chennai: Indias hopes of making it to the world volleyball championship was dashed by Australia when they beat the hapless hosts 3-0 in the second match of the three team second leg qualifying tournament here on Saturday. 

A toothless attack, with even first passes going awry, and total disarray in defence proved to be Indias undoing, as Australia easily won 25-18, 25-17, 25-17 in 64 minutes. 

India were forced to play second fiddle to the australians, who time and again changed their plans to mislead the hosts. (PTI)

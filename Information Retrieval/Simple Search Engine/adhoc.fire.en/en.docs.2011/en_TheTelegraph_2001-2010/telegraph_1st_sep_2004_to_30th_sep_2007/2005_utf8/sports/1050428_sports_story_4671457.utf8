 Henry leads ?golden? race

 Thierry Henry has scored 25 goals this season 

London: Arsenal striker Thierry Henry leads the race to retain his Golden Shoe award for Europe?s top league scorer this season, despite netting nine goals fewer than Marc Lloyd-Williams who plays for Welsh Premier League champions Total Network Solutions. 

He has banged in 34 goals in the predominantly semi-professional league this season against Henry?s 25. 

As the Welsh Premier League is a top division in a national association, Lloyd-Williams is eligible for European Sports Magazines? Golden Shoe but he is 13th on the list because his league is not deemed strong enough. 

The number of goals scored by players in top divisions in Spain, Italy, Germany, France and England are doubled to determine their Golden Shoe rating, reflecting the greater difficulty in scoring in these leagues compared to others. 

?You?ve got to abide by the rules,? a philosophical Lloyd-Williams said. ?Everyone plays at their own level. Henry and Ronaldo play against top class sides.? 

Under the system, last year?s winner Henry tops the list with 50 points. FC Nuremburg striker Marek Mintal is second on 44 points having scored 22 in the Bundesliga. Barcelona striker Samuel Eto? is joint third with Roma?s Vincenzo Montella on 42 after both netting 21 league goals so far. 

If Lloyd-Williams had scored more than double the amount of Henry then he would have led the race but he has run out of time, as the Welsh season ended last Saturday.

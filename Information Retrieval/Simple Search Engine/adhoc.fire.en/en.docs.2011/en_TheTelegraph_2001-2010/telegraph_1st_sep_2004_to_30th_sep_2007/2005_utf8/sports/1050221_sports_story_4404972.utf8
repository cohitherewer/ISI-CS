 Players surprised over stalled events

New Delhi: The Chess Players? Association of India (CPAI) on Sunday expressed ?surprise? over the postponement of several international tournaments which were scheduled to be held in the country over the next few weeks. 

?We are surprised at the postponement of Commonwealth Championship at Bikaner, International Open at Raipur and the Asian Individual Championship at Kochi without any alternate dates being provided by the organisers of these events,? CPAI said in a release here on Sunday. 

?We feel that by this sudden postponement, the organisers of the above events have put self-interests above the development of chess in the country.? 

CPAI also thanked the All India Chess Federation (AICF) for having decided in its special general body meeting held in Chennai on Friday to refund the amount collected through a 10 per cent deduction from the players? prize money during June to December 2004.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Itll be a tough call: Wright

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Its going to be a tough call, but Im sure the special committee will make the right choice, was John Wrights reaction when told his successor as the Team India coach is set to be identified within 24 hours. 

However, Wright (currently taking a complete break in the countryside off Christchurch) declined to discuss the merits or otherwise of the four contenders. 

Interacting briefly with The Telegraph on Wednesday, he said: My doing so wont be proper... The best man should be chosen and Im confident that tops the committees agenda... Nationality ought not to be a factor. 

That, at the very least, is an interesting comment from Indian crickets first coach from overseas ? someone who spent four-and-half years in the job.

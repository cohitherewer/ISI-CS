 Flintoff, the most-feared assassin 

Paul Hayward

Imagine winning a competition in which first prize was to invite the six leading figures in British sport to your house for dinner. No retired legends, just active stars. Paula Radcliffe, tick. Ricky Hatton ? yes. Jonny Wilkinson, for past endeavours. Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen, from football. Then? Freddie Flintoff ? an absolute must. 

Though Australia survived a gruelling bombardment to escape with a draw Monday, there is surely an Ashes Test-winning performance, a Botham-esque flourish to come from the countrys foremost cricketer, who deserved better than to finish a tense afternoon wincing and gasping as his final over failed to remove Brett Lee, whose 24-ball last-wicket stand with Glenn McGrath left Old Trafford with all the atmosphere of a morgue. 

If reasons to be cheerful are being sought, none matches Flintoffs four for 71 off 25 overs: his aggression and conviction, the memory of which will make these Australians even more wary of him in the last two Tests. All great players are dramatists, and Flintoffs most thrilling contribution to an exhausting day was the nick off Shane Warnes bat that bounced first on Andrew Strauss thigh and then into the gloves of Geraint Jones. In that moment, exultation swept across English cricket. 

No English player expresses the spirit of his age like the countrys best allrounder since Ian Botham who, Mike Brearley once mused, brought something of the village green to Test cricket. You could see that trait in Flintoff again on Monday. 

As Steve Waugh, the former Australia captain, pointed out on Sunday, a true allrounder is a genuine strike bowler who would also make the side for his batting, not someone who happens to be quite good at both. Even with Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones and Steve Harmison taking wickets, it was clear Flintoff was going to be Englands chief assassin. 

Freddie, Freddie they chorused after Matthew Haydens leg stump had been removed by a typically venomous delivery. For Australias troubled opener, Flintoffs first wicket of the day brought merciful release from the thud of ball on pad and the whistle of deliveries flashing past his outside edge. Hayden used up eight lives before Flintoffs persistence and aggression denied him a ninth. 

Though Old Trafford brought Flintoffs 50th Test appearance, his Ashes debut was delayed by injury and circumstance until this summer. A pity, really, that he reached 27 before joining one of the oldest and greatest feuds in sport. As colleagues consoled him after his final, fruitless over, he was offered an insight into Bothams genius, which entertained but also yielded great results. This is Flintoffs personal challenge: to find the narrow passageway between victory and despair.

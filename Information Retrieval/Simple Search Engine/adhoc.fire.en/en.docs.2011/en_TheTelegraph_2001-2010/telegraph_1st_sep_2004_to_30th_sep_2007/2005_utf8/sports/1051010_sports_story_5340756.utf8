 Jeev ends tied 14th

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a one-under 71 in the final round, finishing tied 14th at the ?120 million Coca Cola Tokai Classic at the par-72 Miyoshi Country Club West Golf course here on Sunday. 

It was a disappointing result for the Indian after having led on the first day and having been tied second midway . 

Young Eun Yang played some brilliant golf with a five-under 67 on the final day to grab the title, which was the third in his career. It also took him to tenth place on the money list in Japan. 

Jeev, who had a flurry of birdies on the first day, had just two on the final day on the second and ninth, besides dropping a shot on 13th. 

He took 30 putts, but struggled on the fairways.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sandipan loses yet again

 - Surya, Sasikiran held 

 Surya Sekhar split point with Igor Kursnov 

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran settled for a draw with Russian GM Alexander Galkin in the sixth round of the A-1 section of the Aeroflot International open chess meet here on Monday. 

The positions atop the tables remained unchanged owing to a string of drawn games. Overnight leaders Emil Sutovsky of Israel and Andrei Kharlov of Russia continued sharing the lead on five points each out of a possible six after splitting a point between them. 

They are being followed by a pack of six on 4.5 points apiece. They are Russians Vladimir Malakhov, Sergey Volkov, Valerij Filippov, Alexander Motylev and former world champion Alexander Khalifman and Moldovian Viktor Bologan. 

With just three rounds remaining in this tournament, as many as 14 players including top seed Etienne Bacrot of France and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine were next in line on four points, while Sasikiran was on three. 

Only a strong finish can now propel the second highest-rated Indian to a respectable position in the standing list. In the next round, Sasikiran will play Ashot Anastasian of Armenia. 

Things did not move as expected for both Surya Shekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda in the sixth round as the former could only manage a draw with Igor Kursnov of Russia. Chanda lost his second game on the trot, bowing to Robert Kempinski of Poland. 

Both the Indians were yet to score a victory in this strong open only for players above 2550 elo rating. 

In A-2 section, Tejas Bakre was defeated by Denis Khismatullin of Russia. Having done quite well so far, Bakre?s tournament standing suffered a severe setback as from joint 12th before the commencement of this round, he was pushed way down to joint 41st. 

Wang Hao of China emerged as the sole leader here with a fine victory over Russian Alexei Iljushin. Hao, on five, is now followed by 12 players with 4.5 points.

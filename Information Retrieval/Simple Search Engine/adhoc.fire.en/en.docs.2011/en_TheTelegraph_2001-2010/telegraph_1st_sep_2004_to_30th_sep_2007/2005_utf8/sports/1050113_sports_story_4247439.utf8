London: Steven Gerrard?s second-half goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win over second division Watford in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final in Anfield on Tuesday. 

The England midfielder struck after 56 minutes, finishing a flowing move with a firm goalbound shot from just inside the area that Watford defender Neil Cox could only head into his own net. 

Liverpool struggled in the first half but improved after the interval following the introduction of Czech striker Milan Baros as a substitute. 

Watford, 16th in the second division, competed well in the early stages, threatening to open the scoring after 18 minutes when Brynjar Gunnarsson?s powerful header was blocked by goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. 

The Premier League side showed more urgency after halftime, however, Gerrard firing a shot just over the crossbar and Neil Mellor forcing a good save out of Watford goalkeeper Paul Jones before Gerrard broke the deadlock. Watford continued to press forward after falling behind and striker Heidar Helguson was only denied by a last-ditch challenge from defender Djimi Traore in the dying minutes. 

 Sevilla in last-eight 

Primera Liga side Sevilla headed towards the last eight of the King?s Cup after claiming a 2-0 victory in an eventful first-leg match at second division Recreativo Huelva. 

Brazilian striker Julio Baptista cracked home twice from the penalty spot in a game in which both sides were reduced to 10 men in the first half. 

Recreativo suffered an early setback when midfielder Emilio Viqueira was sent off after just 27 minutes when he appeared to insult the referee. 

Sevilla only managed to break the deadlock in the 70th minute when they were awarded a penalty after defender Pedro Baquero handled a Baptista free kick in the area. 

The Brazilian blasted home from the spot and added another seven minutes later, winning the penalty when he went down under a challenge from Baquero. (Reuters)

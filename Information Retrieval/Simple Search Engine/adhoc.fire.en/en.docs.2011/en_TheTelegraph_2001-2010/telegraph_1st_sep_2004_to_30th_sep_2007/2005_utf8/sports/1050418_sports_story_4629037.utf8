 Sasi settles for draw with IM

 Sasikiran slipped to joint second 

Malmo (Sweden): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran settled for a draw with Danish International Master Palo Davor while GM Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova sole leader after recording a smooth victory over Swede Emil Hermansson after the second round of the Swedish chess tournament here. 

Sasikiran, US champion Hikaru Nakamura and Jan Timman of The Netherlands are in joint second spot with 1.5 points apiece. Curt Hansen of Denmark and Swedish duo Jonny Hector and Tiger Hillarp Persson are next in line with 1 each in this Category-13 event being played on a round-robin basis. 

Sasikiran could not do much with his white pieces against Palo who employed the Nimzo Indian defence. He opted for a relatively less played variation in the Leningrad System but was surprised to find Palo well armed. 

As the middle game approached, three minor pieces changed hands quickly and when Palo guided his forces to the queenside, Sasikiran knew there was no chance to make a real headway. Peace was signed in just 24 moves.

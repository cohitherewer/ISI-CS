Shanghai: Arjun Atwal carded a three-under par 69 to be placed tied 22nd after the first round at the $ 5m HSBC Champions tournament which started at the Sheshan International Golf Club here on Thursday. 

The Indian made five birdies and two bogeys in a round that he confessed should have seen him shoot a lower score. 

I am not complaining, but I should have had birdies on each of the last four holes from sixth to ninth. I wish I had dropped a few more putts, said Atwal. 

Jyoti Randhawa, who defends his Volvo Masters title next month, bogeyed the last two holes and finished one-over 73 to be tied 51st after being caught in severe rain over the last five holes. 

Englands Nick Dougherty, Australias Peter Malley and Scotlands Paul Lawrie shared the first-round lead at eight-under 64 on a day when the golfers seemed to have the better of the course. 

World No. 1 Tiger Woods, who had the biggest gallery despite a slight drizzle over the last few holes, packed in 10 birdies but also had three bogeys including one on the difficult ninth hole, his closing one for the day. 

Talking about his round, Atwal said: Three-under for the first day was okay. The roughs were soggy because of the rain, but I wish I could have holed a few more of those birdie putts. I am not complaining, but there were some noticeable spike marks on the greens. 

Atwal played with Peter Malley, one of the co-leaders. He struck a purple patch, sinking almost everything for quite sometime (he had birdies on seven successive holes) and carded a fine 64, said Atwal of his playing partner. 

Randhawa had three birdies on the 14th, 16th and fifth. He ploughed his way through rain in the last few holes. Time and again he was caught in the soggy rough. He also took a trip into the lake guarding the green on the 603-yard par-five eighth hole, where he made a bogey, and then made another one from the rough on the ninth. 

Woods had an unusual finish on the ninth. 

The goatee-sporting superstar said: I have never seen anything like that. I hit a three-wood off the tee and hit in the middle of the bunker and it buried. I did well just to get the thing out of the bunker. I hit a 8-iron, spun it off the green and two-putted for a bogey. Just to have a ball bury in the middle of the bunker is not something youre used to seeing, not off the tee anyway. 

Woods, who birdied each of the four par-5s, was tied fourth with K. J. Choi, David Howell and Robert Jan Derksen, all one off the lead. 

Local favourite Zhang Lianwei, paired with Woods, shot a bogey-free five-under 67. He was unlucky and more than once his birdie attempts stopped millimetres short.

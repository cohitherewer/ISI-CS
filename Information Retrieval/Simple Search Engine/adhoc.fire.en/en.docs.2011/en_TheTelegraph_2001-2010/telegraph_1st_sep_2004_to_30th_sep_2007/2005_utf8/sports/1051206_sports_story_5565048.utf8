 3-match ban for Deisler 

Berlin: Bayern Munich midfielder Sebastian Deisler was suspended for three matches on Monday for kicking an opponent. 

Deisler was ejected in the 43rd minute of Bayerns 0-0 Bundesliga draw on Saturday against Stuttgart, kicking Ludovic Magnin after the two yanked each others jerseys fighting over the ball.

Indianapolis: Despite the two consecutive failures to complete the race, Indias rookie Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan is not unduly bothered by the setbacks and is determined to make amends in the United States Grand Prix on Sunday. 

Even though I have never driven there, I am looking forward to Indianapolis, as there is a legendary racing history behind it. To be racing at the brickyard will be a great experience for me, Karthikeyan said. 

We will be driving on a part of the oval, where the cars will reach a top speed of 350, 345 km per hour. The first corner will be tricky and the infield section can be difficult as well. It will be good and I am really impatient to race there, he was quoted as saying in a Team Jordan press release. 

The Jordan driver was forced out in the 29th lap with suspension problems after losing control and brushing the wall. 

Earlier in the eighth lap, the 28-year-old Indian rookie was lucky to survive a spin and he rejoined the race in last place. Brake stability and traction are important on the Montreal track as drivers do a lot of running close to the concrete walls on the back section of the Canadian circuit. 

The 28-year-old came straight from Montreal here on Monday to prepare for the GP, which is the home of American motor racing. The team will have only two days to rebuild the cars in time for Fridays first practice. 

Paul Monaghan, the chief race engineer of Jordan, said the race would be a challenge for the teams three drivers ? Karthikeyan, Tiago Monteiro and Robert Doornbos ? but hoped to having a trouble-free day on the track. 

Indianapolis will be a challenge for our three drivers, as they have never driven there. Therefore, they will have to spend extra time learning the layout, Monaghan said. 

There is an interesting combination of long straights and slower corners. After the good Bridgestone results in Canada, we are hoping to maintain the improvement, which will bring us, closer to our nearest competitors. We will be trying to have another trouble-free race, he said. 

Monteiro, who finished an impressive 10th in Montreal, plans to spend a day revisiting his former champ car team here and expects a good showdown next. 

Indianapolis is a very special place for the motorsport industry. I have some friends there and also my former champ car team and engineers are based there. 

It will be very nice to see them again for a few days. I will be training as well. From what I have seen on TV, the track looks quite demanding and interesting. The Oval will also be very exciting and there will be a lot fans. I am sure it will be a great show. 

Test driver Doornbos said, I am really looking forward to being back in the car in Indianapolis after two race weekends without driving. 

I am going to prepare myself in a ranch with my sponsors for two or three days in Minneapolis where I will learn how to fly an old aeroplane. I will also focus on the weekend. 

I cannot wait to drive in this amazing circuit. I watched the Indy 500 two weeks ago. It will be a great experience to drive on the oval as it will be flat out and I also hope we can get a good result for the team.

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi is set to have a new partner in the Australian Open, the only Grand Slam event which he has missed out on, and its going to be Wesley Moody of South Africa. I am planning to team up with Moody for the Australian Open, said nine-time Grand Slam winner Bhupathi on Friday. 

Incidentally, Bhupathi paired up with Martin Damm of Czech Republic and lost in the third round of the just-concluded US Open. 

On the other hand, Moody created a flutter at Wimbledon when he partnered Stephen Huss to lift the doubles title as qualifiers. 

Speaking later at a press conference, Bhupathi believed that Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Sania Mirza and Anju Bobby George are going to comprise the new Team India. 

Mahesh also feels the upcoming WTA meet provide great opportunity to the Uberoi sisters ? Shikha and Neha. 

On Indias prospects at the Davis Cup World Group play-off against Sweden in New Delhi next week, Bhupathi said the hosts would start as underdogs. Bhupathi disclosed that his sports management company Globosport, which manages the profile of Sania, was now holding discussions with some Indian athletes. 

He also ruled out promoting an ATP meet in the country, saying the country did not have the market to accommodate two such tournaments. According to Bhupathi, the Netaji Indoor Stadium was ready for the meet, though its faulty air conditioning system had caused a leakage. We have a problem with the AC. I hope it will be fixed before the tournament starts, he said. Bhupathi also held a discussion with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in this regard. 

Meanwhile, C.G.K. Bhupathi, father of the nine Grand Slam winner, feels Harsh Mankads omission from the final list of the Davis Cup team against Sweden was done on the basis of the courts nature 

 Harsh is a better player on hardcourts and since the tie will be played on grasscourts, he has been kept as the fifth member, even though he has the highest ranking among the singles players in the squad, he, one of the selectors, stated.

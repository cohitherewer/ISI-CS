 Clarke ready for the bad and the good 

Melbourne: Australian cricket?s pin-up boy Michael Clarke on Tuesday said he was prepared for his golden run to end after winning the Allan Border medal. 

The dashing 23-year-old batsman on Monday won Australian cricket?s top individual honour, ahead of the more experienced teammate Damien Martyn. 

Clarke has been the sensation of Australian cricket in the last year with his continued strong one-day form and tons on Test debut home and away. 

?I?ve been really enjoying my cricket, especially over the last 12 months ? I made my debut for Australia in Test cricket, I?ve been doing pretty well in one-dayers and hopefully, fingers crossed, I will continue doing well,? Clarke said. 

?But there does come a time where unfortunately in this great game you can?t do well all the time and I know that?s going to happen.

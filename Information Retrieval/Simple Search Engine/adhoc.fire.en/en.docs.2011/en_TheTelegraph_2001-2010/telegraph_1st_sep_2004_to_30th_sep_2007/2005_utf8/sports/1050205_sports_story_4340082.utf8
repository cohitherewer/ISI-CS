 Mumbai: The Uday Pawar Badminton Academy-organised senior all-India major ranking prize money tournament, scheduled from February 8-12 in Mumbai, has attracted many top men performers of the country barring former All England champion Pullela Gopichand. ?Gopi?s mother is seriously ill and he wants to concentrate on forthcoming international tournaments like the All England in March and the Sudirman Cup world team championship in China in May,? former international Pawar told a press conference on Friday.

 There is a question mark over the women?s entries with none having confirmed their participation.

 Berlin: Former world heavyweight champion Max Schmeling, who fought two unforgettable bouts with the great American Joe Louis in the last 1930s, has died at the age of 99. German sports agency SID said Schmeling was buried in his home town of Hollenstedt on Friday, two days after his death.

 The wife of his close friend Herbert Woltmann said Schemling had not recovered after catching a bad cold at Christmas.

 Schmeling won the vacant world title when he defeated Jack Sharkey in 1930 and his sensational knockout of Joe Louis in 1936 confirmed his position as one of the greatest boxers of his era.

 Hyderabad: Indian representation in the $140,000 WTA Hyderabad Open got a huge boost with Shikha Uberoi gaining a direct entry and Ankita Bhambri earning a wild card into the main draw.

 Shikha had been No. 2 in the qualifying list but moved into the main draw after a few players dropped out from the main draw acceptance list, according to the organisers. The US-based player was cleared to play for India by the ITF last month. Shikha?s direct acceptance enabled the organisers to extend the wild card to Ankita.

 Rio de Janeiro: Flamengo, who claim to be Brazil?s most popular club, named Cuca as their new coach on Thursday, 12 hours after sacking Julio Cesar Leal who had been in charge for four games.

 Flamengo director Gerson Biscotto said Cuca would take over in time for Saturday?s ?Fla-Flu? derby against Fluminense

 Brussels: Five players and their coach have been questioned by Belgian justice officials in connection with an investigation into possible match-fixing.

 The five ? Peter Delorge, Dusan Belic, Thomas Caers, Desire Mbonabucya and Marcos Pereira ? played for St Truiden last season. Their coach at the time, Jacky Mathijssen, now with Charleroi, was also questioned by the public prosecutor of the town of Hasselt on Thursday and released.

 Athens: Fourteen people have been charged in connection with the violence that caused the postponement of the Greek league match between Panionios and Olympiakos Piraeus on January 9.

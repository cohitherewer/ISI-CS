 Sanskara claims ?Million? 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: In a close-finish, Bharath Singh?s trainee Sanskara surprised the hot favourite Aleskei and walked away with the juvenile derby, the 1,600m Nanoli Stud Calcutta Million on Saturday. The western India jockey C. Rajendra partnered the Don?t Forget Me-Shisedo daughter to victory. The pulsating finishes were, in fact, the order of day, and the camera was requisitioned to decide the winner on as many as four occasions.

 Sanskara, an 8-1 shot, was ridden in check till the final stretch while Acrostic cut a scorching pace which suited the winner to the hilt. She covered the ground with such alacrity that jockey Mallesh Narredu, who was being hailed as a winner on the 45-100 favourite, was left amazed a stride or two from the winning post.

 Mallesh, however, had two armchaired rides earlier in the day when Star Magic won him the Mayor?s Cup and Announcer, the Spats Colombo Cup. Adderly, Common Spirit and Cambridge Blue were the other horses who won close contests.

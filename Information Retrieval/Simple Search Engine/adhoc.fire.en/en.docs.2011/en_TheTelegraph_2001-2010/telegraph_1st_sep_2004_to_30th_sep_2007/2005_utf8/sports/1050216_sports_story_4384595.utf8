The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A hard tour ahead, says coach Phil Simmons

 - ?Batsmen need to understand how to score big hundreds? 

 Exposure the only way to improve, says Simmons 

Johannesburg: Zimbabwe face a grilling during their tour to South Africa but coach Phil Simmons believes his side must be exposed to such challenges if they are to improve. 

Simmons, speaking as the Zimbabwe squad arrived in South Africa on Tuesday after losing both the Test and one-day series in Bangladesh, said: ?The ability to produce big innings is the main problem. There?s talent there, but the batsmen need to understand how to score big hundreds. 

?That only comes from playing over and over again, which is why I believe having a two-tier Test set-up would be a backward move.? 

The former West Indies allrounder has considerable experience of playing in South Africa, having turned out for the Easterns and Border teams in the 1990s. 

?I will use my experiences, I?m just sorry I can?t help them on the actual field,? Simmons said. ?But what I?ve learnt here I will definitely pass on because it?s going to be a hard tour.? 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) is considering revising its long-term fixture schedule. Under one option, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, the two weakest Test-playing nations, could play less away games in an attempt to reduce the number of mis-matches. 

Zimbabwe and South Africa have played five Tests and 18 one-day Internationals. Zimbabwe have never beaten South Africa in a Test, but have won two of the one-dayers. 

Zimbabwe lost their Test status temporarily last year because the ICC felt the team was no longer competitive after a rebellion by 15 white players over selection policy. The dispute is still going on. 

The side?s problems were reflected in Bangladesh. The home team had never won a Test before, let alone a Test series, and had never won a one-day series either. 

Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu told reporters at Johannesburg International Airport that at least the conditions in South Africa would make a welcome change. 

?There should be a bit of swing and seam and pitches here will at least be similar to those in Zimbabwe. On the tour to Bangladesh, the pitches only favoured spin,? he said. 

Zimbabwe open their tour on Wednesday with a day/night match against a Gauteng/North-West XI in Potchefstroom. The first one-day International is on February 25 in Johannesburg. 

The 15-man squad includes four white players. The side will play three one-day Internationals and two Tests.

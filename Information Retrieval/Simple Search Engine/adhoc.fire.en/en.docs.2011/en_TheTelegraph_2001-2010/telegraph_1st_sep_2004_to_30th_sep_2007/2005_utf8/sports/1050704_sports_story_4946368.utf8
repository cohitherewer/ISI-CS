 One of my best weeks: Johansson

London: Forty one months after winning his first Grand Slam title at the 2002 Australian Open, injury-plagued Thomas Johansson was back at the top table of tennis on Saturday and taking part in a Grand Slam semi-final, where he was beaten by Andy Roddick. 

This is one of my best weeks in my life. Wimbledon has such a great history, said Johansson. Being in the semi-final of one of the biggest tournaments feels great. 

The only previous time Johansson reached a Grand Slam semi-final was at the 2002 Australian Open, when he went on to beat Marat Safin in the final. 

Plagued by injuries, the Swede struggled through the rest of the 2002 season before a shoulder problem forced him to sit out the US Open. 

He returned to competitive action in October but his comeback was short-lived and he missed the entire 2003 season after undergoing knee surgery.

Kingston: Pakistan won a Test in the Caribbean for the first time in 17 years when they beat West Indies by 136 runs in the second and final Test in Kingston, Jamaica on Tuesday. 

Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria grabbed five for 46 and paceman Shabbir Ahmed took four for 55, registering match figures of eight for 119, to earn Pakistan a 1-1 draw in the series. 

West Indies, who resumed on 114 for six chasing 280 for victory, were bowled out for 143 on the fifth day as they slumped to their 13th defeat in 20 Tests. 

It was a very close match, said Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who hit his 22nd Test century on Monday. 

The pitch was not easy for batting on the fourth and fifth days. It is good to see the team fighting hard and hopefully we can continue playing like this. 

Man-of-the-Match Kaneria, 24, who claimed his 11th five-wicket haul in his 28th Test, began the day by having Daren Powell caught by Yasir Hameed for 12. 

Shabbir followed up by dismissing Courtney Browne (10), Reon King (4) and Tino Best (4) to wrap up the innings in only 40 minutes. 

Fast bowler Shabbir was reported for a suspect bowling action for the third time in his career during Pakistans 276-run defeat in the first Test in Barbados. 

Pakistan, who last won in the Caribbean in Guyana in 1988, have come back from first-test defeats to draw three of their last four series, against Sri Lanka at home, in India and now West Indies. 

With a forecast for heavy showers threatening to spoil the final days play, Pakistan wasted no time in taking the last four wickets. 

Powell, however, was unfortunate to be given out caught when the ball appeared to come off his pad. 

Shabbir then had Browne caught behind by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, who recorded nine dismissals in the match. 

Akmal also snapped up King before Best was last man out, caught by Shahid Afridi at wide mid-off. 

West Indies skipper Shivnarine Chanderpaul said: Its been a long and hard season for us and I think they took better advantage of the pitch. 

The match was evenly balanced until the final session on Monday. 

West Indies batsman Brian Lara was named Man-of-the-Series for his two centuries. 

Pakistan, who earlier swept the one-day matches 3-0, have never won a Test series in the Caribbean. 

The game in Kingston marked the 92nd and final Test for English umpire David Shepherd. 

On Monday, Inzamam-ul Haqs 22nd Test hundred set it up, and a handful of late wickets mostly for Kaneria, including the prized scalps of Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, put Pakistan on the verge of a series-levelling victory. 

Chasing 280 to win, Kaneria collected four wickets for 37 runs from 14 overs, as the West Indies slumped to 114 for six when bad light stopped play six overs early on an action-packed, rain-affected penultimate day at Sabina Park. 

Inzamam capitalised on his good fortune to complete his fourth Test hundred against the West Indies, a purposeful, undefeated 117, that was the cornerstone of his sides second innings total of 307. 

Tino Best kept the West Indies in the game when he collected a test-best four for 44 from 12 overs, and Corey Collymore ended with four for 56 from 16.5 overs to claim the best match figures in the 41 Tests played at Sabina Park of 11 for 134. 

As easily as Best and Collymore brought the West Indies back into contention, Kaneria again shut the door on them with the wickets of Ramnaresh Sarwan, Lara and Chanderpaul in the space of nine balls in successive overs. 

After a 135-minute break for bad light and rain, Kaneria had Sarwan hit-wicket for eight when the batsman tried to turn an awkwardly bouncing delivery into the leg-side .

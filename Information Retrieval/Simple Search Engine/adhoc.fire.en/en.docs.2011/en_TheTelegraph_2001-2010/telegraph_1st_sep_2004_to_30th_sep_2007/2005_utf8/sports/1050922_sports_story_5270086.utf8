The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Absurd directive to manager

 - Manoeuvrings ahead of AGM 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The manoeuvring ahead of the latest AGM of the Board, to be held here on Thursday-Friday, reached absurd proportions with Team India manager Amitabh Choudhary being directed by a departmental secretary of the Jharkhand government to immediately report to headquarters (Ranchi). 

A Jagmohan Dalmiya backer, Choudhary heads the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) and is scheduled to return home on September 26. Under no circumstances could he have deserted Sourav Ganguly and Co. 

Actually, its beyond belief that somebody ? obviously belonging to the Sharad Pawar camp ? even thought of a scenario whereby the team would be without its manager. 

According to The Telegraphs sources in the Board and in Jamshedpur, Choudhary received the faxed directive on returning to the team hotel (Sheraton) in Harare after the opening days play of the ongoing Test there. 

Choudhary had a curt no comments when his reaction was sought on Wednesday, but sources insist theyre absolutely on the ball. 

Ironically, Choudhary is director of the department (arts, culture, sports and youth affairs) whose secretary ? M.N. Sinha ? signed the directive. Choudhary is an IPS officer who is on deputation. 

Whats surprising is that the directive was sent even though the Dalmiya group got a very influential BJP leader to have a word with Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda, largely to ensure nothing went wrong. 

Even then... 

Apparently, the Pawar camp also tried to prevent JSCA secretary B.N.Singh from attending the AGM in Choudharys absence. The pressure, one understands, was put by a major industrial house. 

Poor Singh, who wouldnt ever ditch Dalmiya, had a tough time in Jamshedpur... Its an achievement that he could resist the enormous pressure, is how a source based there put it. 

It couldnt be confirmed, but there was a move to have state chief secretary P.P. Sharma represent the JSCA at the AGM. It failed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Koertzen, Bowden to officiate

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has appointed Elite Panel umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden for the January 10 tsunami fund-raiser at the MCG. It?s a pointer that the match is heading towards getting ODI status. 

The fund-raiser ? a day-night affair ? is to feature the Sourav Ganguly-led Asia XI and an ICC XI captained by Ricky Ponting. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, Chris Broad (in the news for the Harbhajan Singh issue) will be the Match Referee. 

While Sourav is planning to fly out of Calcutta itself on Friday night, the other five Indians in the Asia squad are to board a Qantas flight from Mumbai a couple of hours before the captain intends to depart.

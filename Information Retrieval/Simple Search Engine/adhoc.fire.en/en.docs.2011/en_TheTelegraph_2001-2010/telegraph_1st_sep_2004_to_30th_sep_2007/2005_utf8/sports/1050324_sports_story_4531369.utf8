 Sourav wants ICC to clear air

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly wants the International Cricket Council (ICC) to take a clear stand on Harbhajan Singh?s doosra action. 

The country?s most successful off-spinner has been reported yet again, this time just a few weeks after being cleared by the world body. 

?It?s not that I?m worried, but Harbhajan needs to know where he stands... He can serve the country for another ten years and has to play without this pressure,? Sourav remarked on Wednesday afternoon. 

The captain, however, dismissed talk that the ICC probably had a ?motive? in pinning Harbhajan down one more time. 

?He?s a fighter and, so, will remain strong... But, yes, he?s concerned because it?s a question of his career,? Sourav added. 

Inzamam-ul Haq preferred not to go into specifics, but accepted that the timing of this controversy couldn?t work in India?s favour. 

The Pakistan captain, though, pointed out that ?most of the damage? was being caused by Anil Kumble. Also, that the ?laws and regulations? had to be followed. 

In the short-term, all the fuss may be of little relevance as The Telegraph learns Harbhajan may have to sit out of the third and final Test.

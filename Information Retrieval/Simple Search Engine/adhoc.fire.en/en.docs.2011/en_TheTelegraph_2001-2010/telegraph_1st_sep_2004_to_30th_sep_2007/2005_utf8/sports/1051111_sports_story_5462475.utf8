 Seniors shine for India 

Bangalore: Five-time national champion Ashok Malik, who at 67 still plays to 1-handicap, made an amazing downhill putt on the finishing hole on Thursday. 

This enabled him to score a par and earn a full point for India, based on which the hosts surged ahead against arch rivals Pakistan in the Ravi Kirloskar Trophy India-Pakistan golf tournament being played at the Karnataka Golf Association in Bangalore. 

After the visitors held a one-point advantage at the beginning of the day, India came back strongly, thanks to their seniors who won three hard-fought matches and put them ahead. 

In the event played on the Ryder Cup format, the total tally after day-2 stood at 6.5-5.5 in favour of the hosts. 

Meanwhile in the Friendship Cup that was held for the other amateurs, Rajendra Patil emerged as the winner with a score of 63 nett. 

Nitin Jajoo was the runner-up with 65 nett score pipping C. Jayaram on a countback. (Agencies)

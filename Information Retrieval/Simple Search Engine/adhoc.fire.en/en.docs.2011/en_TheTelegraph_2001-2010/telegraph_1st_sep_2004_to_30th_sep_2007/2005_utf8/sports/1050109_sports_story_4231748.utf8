The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Federer reigns supreme 

Doha: World number one Roger Federer continued his spectacular run at the Qatar Open by beating Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia 6-3 6-1 in the final on Saturday. 

Federer?s 21st consecutive victory brought him his 23rd win in 31 finals and his 14th final triumph in a row since 2003. 

The Swiss top seed dominated the sixth-seeded Ljubicic right from the start, putting on a scintillating display of accurate serves, fluent backhands and punishing forehands. 

Ljubicic, who had beaten Federer three times in six meetings, folded as the pressure mounted and made too many unforced errors. 

Federer broke Ljubicic in the sixth game to jump to a 4-2 lead and held his next two service games to take the first set 6-3 in 35 minutes. The second set lasted only 27 minutes as the holder of three Grand Slam titles blasted his opponent off the court. (Reuters)

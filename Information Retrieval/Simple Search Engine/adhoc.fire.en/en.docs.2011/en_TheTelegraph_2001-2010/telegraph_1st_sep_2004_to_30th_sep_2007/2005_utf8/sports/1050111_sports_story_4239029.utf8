The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?For me, each day as captain is a highlight?

 - I?ve got a team which needs to be led well and expectations bring the best out of me: Fleming 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Melbourne: Be it Imran Khan or Nasser Hussain, both outstanding leaders themselves, any discussion on captaincy will see them talk of Stephen Fleming in glowing terms. On Monday, before the fund-raising ODI, The Telegraph spoke to the 31-year-old New Zealander himself on captaincy. 

The following are excerpts 

 On being regarded as the leading 

 captain of the present times

 (Grins) I?m comfortable 

 with whatever is said... I?ve got a team which needs to 

 be led well and expectations bring the best out of me... 

 Does the label put me under more pressure? No... In fact, 

 I don?t mind pressure. Essentially, I strive to be the best 

 I can, both as captain and batsman. 

 [Fleming has led in 65 Tests (22 wins, 22 losses) 

 and 169 ODIs (75 wins, 82 losses).] 

 On having been captain for 

 eight years

 It has been a stimulating experience... 

 I?ve enjoyed it... We?ve been doing pretty well in the one-dayers, 

 but need to get better in Test cricket... We have limited 

 resources and, so, that?s the biggest challenge both today 

 and in the near future for New Zealand cric- ket. 

 On the time he needed to settle down as captain 

 Four years... Perhaps, even five... Some 

 give it away rather quickly, but I?ve been around and continue 

 to learn. (After a pause) It?s going to be interesting 

 knowing how many anywhere have been captain for this long. 

 On his style 

 In simple terms, it?s inclusive... 

 On whether he resorts to the riot act 

 Depends on how a game has gone... Actually, 

 rather than reading the riot act, I?ll probably stay reserved 

 in the dressing room, allowing the players to take care 

 of themselves. 

 On his role model captain 

 Steve Waugh and Martin Crowe... Steve galvanised 

 a good team, besides, I liked the way he played. As for 

 Martin, he was innovative and made best use of the resources. 

 Of course, he was himself a great batsman. 

 On whether he admires any one contemporary 

 Look, I respect all captains... Moreover, 

 instead of looking at others, I?ve been helping develop 

 leadership within the New Zealand team. I see that too as 

 a responsibility. 

 On the ones with qualities to succeed him 

 Daniel Vettori and Jacob Oram... Once I?ve 

 gone, they?re going to be good enough to captain for a decade. 

 On leadership 

 Largely, it?s about the ability to listen 

 and having the ability to effectively communicate. Playing 

 well is part of leadership as, otherwise, the teammates? 

 respect may not be there. 

 On the highpoint of his captaincy 

 For me, each day as captain is a highlight... 

 I want that role and, as I?ve pointed out, enjoy it... Well, 

 yes, the thrill of captaining still remains. 

 On his No. 1 disappointment 

 Every loss is disappointing... Obviously, 

 as captain, I?m affected more than the others. 

 Finally, on just how would he like to be remembered 

 (Grins again) As somebody who tried 

 to make a difference. I?ll be happy if I?m seen that way.

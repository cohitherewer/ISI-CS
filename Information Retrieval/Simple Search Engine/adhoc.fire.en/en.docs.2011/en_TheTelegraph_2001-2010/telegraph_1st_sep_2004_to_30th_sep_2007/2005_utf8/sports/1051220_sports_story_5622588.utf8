The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its for Sourav to call: Bindra

 - Board chief Pawar open to dialogue 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly 

Calcutta: Till late on Monday, there was no announcement from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but president Sharad Pawar told a TV channel that he would have a dialogue with Sourav Ganguly. 

I will meet Sourav, find out what he has in mind and hear what he has to say, is what he said. 

At the same time, Pawar expressed full faith in the (senior) selection committee which dumped the former Team India captain after last weeks Kotla Test. 

For the meeting to be meaningful, it has to be scheduled before December 23, the earliest when the squad for Pakistan can be picked. 

[In Ahmedabad, meanwhile, one-time supremo Jagmohan Dalmiya again called for Pawars intervention ? this time to ensure Sourav was on the January 6 flight to Pakistan.] 

Sourav wasnt available for a comment, but somebody close to the Gangulys suggested he would promptly respond if anybody sought his availability for an appointment with Pawar. 

Former president and Pawar ally Inderjit Singh Bindra, though, is of the opinion Sourav should himself take it up from here. 

Mr Pawar has gone on record? Now, its for Sourav to make a call? I havent been acting as an emissary for either as I dont set up meetings? In any case, both are adults and dont need anybody as a go-between, he remarked. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from New Delhi, Bindra added: Souravs contribution has been immense and, if he has something to say, he must communicate with Mr Pawar. However, there wont be interference in matters of selection. 

Assuming a one-on-one does take place quickly, it wont surprise if Sourav dwells on the intense mental pressure (and the humiliation) he has been subjected to in recent times. 

Also, that even if hes recalled, coach Greg Chappell and captain Rahul Dravid ? who were very much a party to his ouster ? may not make him comfortable in the dressing room. 

Sourav can be expected to talk about double standards in judging form, too. Its not insignificant that the iconic Sunil Gavaskar has, through his columns, been nailing the powers-that-be on that count. 

Actually, for the dialogue-exercise to be successful, Pawar should consider having a meeting with both Sourav and Chappell.

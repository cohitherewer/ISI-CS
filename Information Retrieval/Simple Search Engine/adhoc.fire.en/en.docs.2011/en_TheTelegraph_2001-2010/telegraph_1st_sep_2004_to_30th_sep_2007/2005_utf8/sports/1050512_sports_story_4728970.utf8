 Surrey determined to nail the culprit(s)

 - English cricket rocked by a pair of ball-tampering incidents

 Out-of-form Thorpe may lose his Test berth 

Graham Thorpe was forced to withdraw from the Surrey side for Wednesdays Frizzell Championship match to rest a sore back as an unpleasant week, marred by a serious ball-tampering case, unfolded at The Oval. Surrey were thrashed by Nottinghamshire and Thorpe looked out of form over the weekend, failing twice. The left-handers lethargic start to the season could jeopardise his place in the Test squad. 

Though none of the England batsmen has pulled up trees in the championship, Thorpe, 35, has been especially disappointing. After a fifty in the opening four-dayer against Sussex, he has scored only 19 runs in four innings, plus two failures in the Totesport League. 

Thorpe was the only change in the side because Surrey did not conclude their inquiry into the tampering allegations in time to affect their team-list to play Glamorgan, fellow relegation candidates on the evidence so far. 

Mickey Stewart, Surreys chairman of cricket, said on Monday that he wanted to establish as quickly as possible who had been responsible for the ball-doctoring on the first day of the Nottinghamshire match, but nothing emerged on Tuesday. A Surrey official commented: We want to be as thorough as we can in this investigation and dont want to be rushed by the constraints of a fixture list. 

Stewart and the coach, Steve Rixon, spoke to players, but it would appear they were unable to pin down the culprit or culprits. The need to take significant action was emphasised by the Surrey club, though it was unclear whether that meant sacking, suspension or a simple fine. Glamorgan have decided to send a letter of complaint to the England and Wales Cricket Board about the weekends second ball-tampering incident, singling out the conduct of one Gloucestershire player during the match in Cardiff. 

Gloucestershire declined to comment or issue denials on Tuesday after an accusation by Glamorgans coach, John Derrick, that Steve Kirby scraped the match ball on the car park surface while retrieving a six-hit, and the matter looks likely to drag on until next week. 

Tom Richardson, the Gloucestershire chief executive, said: At this stage we want to see whats in the letter first before taking any action. He added that the matter had been discussed within the club. 

Glamorgans letter simply supports a report by Derrick, an eye witness to the alleged ball-scraping, which would have been intended to give the bowlers more chance of achieving swing. The umpires, John Hampshire and Nigel Cowley, noticed the damage to the ball, but could not be certain whether the scuffing was deliberately done. 

If Derricks anger on Sunday was founded on fact, Kirby took opportunist action out of sight of the field behind the pavilion while Glamorgans batsmen were on top. There was no evidence that the damaged ball helped the bowlers much, and Gloucestershire finished convincing winners. 

The Oval incidents were more cynical, because a warning by umpires Mervyn Kitchen and Nigel Llong about the condition of the ball was flaunted on Friday. Picking the quarter seam by fingernail apparently continued until a flap was sticking out.

 PCB recalls Shoaib

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to recall injured fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar from Australia in order to ensure he is fit for the Indian tour starting next month. 

The decision to recall the Rawalpindi Express was taken after the PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan had consultation with the team management in Australia. 

The Pakistan team is slated to tour India from February 25. ?Shoaib performed successfully during the Tests at Perth and Melbourne but broke down with stress injuries after the Sydney Test,? a PCB statement said. 

?Rather than risk further injury, Shoaib will be placed on a specific fitness rehabilitation regime so that he operates at optimum capacity against India,? the statement said, adding no replacement was being considered as Rao Iftikhar and Mohammed Khalil were already in the tour party. 

Shoaib played in the first one-dayer but could not complete even his first spell in the second before limping off the ground. (PTI)

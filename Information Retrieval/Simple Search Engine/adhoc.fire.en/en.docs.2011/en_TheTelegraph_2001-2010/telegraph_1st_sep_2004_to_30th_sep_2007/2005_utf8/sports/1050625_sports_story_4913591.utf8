 Odds in favour of Germany 

 - Hosts looking to turn tables on Brazil three years after World Cup final 

 Parreira feels that some of Brazils best players are exhausted 

Nuremberg: The return of Michael Ballack and Ronaldos absence could see Germany turn the tables on Brazil when they meet in Saturdays Confederations Cup semi-final, three years on from the World Cup final. 

Ballack, the heartbeat of the German team then as now, was suspended in Yokahama on June 30, 2002, as Ronaldo scored twice in Brazils 2-0 win over Germany to give Brazil their fifth World Cup win. 

The odds are stacking up in favour of a German victory when the sides resume hostilities in historic Nuremberg with a place in the final against Mexico or Argentina at stake. 

Ronaldinho, Robinho, Kaka and Adriano have shown flashes of brilliance but all four forwards are starting to wilt. Ronaldo, excused the competition after he asked for an extended holiday, is really starting to be missed. 

Germany have had an extra days rest, having clinched first place in group A with a 2-2 draw against Argentina on Tuesday, and they will be buoyed by the support of a 42,000 capacity crowd at the Frankenstadion. 

Some of our good players are exhausted, Parreira recognised after his side had only just managed to hold on for a 2-2 draw with Japan and make it into the semi-finals behind Mexico. We have to have a good think about the line-up for the match. 

Germany rested good players for their last game, theyve had an extra day to rest and the match is very important to them as the host nation. 

Germany have not beaten a top-class team for 13 internationals since October 2000 and coach Juergen Klinsmann would love to end that annoying streak. 

One of Klinsmanns first matches in charge was a 1-1 draw with Brazil in a friendly international in September 2004 to celebrate the re-opening of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, the venue for next years World Cup final. 

It is clear that Germany are moving in the right direction under Klinsmann, who has nurtured young players such as Robert Huth and Per Mertesacker in defence, Bastian Schweinsteiger in midfield and Lukas Podolski in attack. 

The question is how such a young side will perform against mighty Brazil, a team led by World Player of the Year Ronaldinho and packed with quality, even if Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Cafu are missing. 

Im looking forward to the Brazil match but Im also a bit nervous, Mertesacker said. I always get a little nervous before matches but then at the decisive moment its important not to show any nerves. 

I respect them, but Im not afraid. Its important to make the strikers respect you. 

Jens Lehmann will play in goal against Brazil, with Oliver Kahn returning for the final or third-place match. 

Arne Friedrich should return from suspension at right-back but Schweinsteiger is out after picking up his second yellow card against Argentina. Torsten Frings is likely to come in. 

Parreira gave his players a day off on Thursday. There are no serious injuries but the coach will wait to see how his players perform in training before deciding on the team. 

We want to win this competition, Parreira said. Well choose the best team we can, depending on the physical and mental state of each man. 

The second semi-final between Argentina and Mexico takes place in Hanover on Sunday. 

Probable teams 

Germany: 12-Jens Lehmann; 3-Arne Friedrich, 4-Robert Huth, 17-Per Mertesacker, 16-Thomas Hitzlsperger; 8-Torsten Frings, 13-Michael Ballack, 19-Bernd Schneider, 10-Sebastian Deisler, 20-Lukas Podolski, 22-Kevin Kuranyi

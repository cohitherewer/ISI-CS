London: Liverpool struck twice in the last six minutes to seal a deserved 2-0 win over Aston Villa in a Premier League match on Saturday. 

Captain Steven Gerrard converted a penalty and midfielder Xabi Alonso lashed in the second goal from the edge of the area to earn the European champions their first away league win of the season. 

Villa keeper Thomas Sorensen looked to have earned his side a point with two outstanding saves before Liam Ridgewell was adjudged to have fouled substitute Peter Crouch and Gerrard calmly stroked the spot-kick into the net. 

Liverpool dominated the first half and French striker Djibril Cisse went closest to scoring after being released by Gerrards long pass but Sorensen reacted quickly to smother his shot. 

Sorensen also saved Liverpools next best effort in the second half, diving low to his left to keep out Gerrards low strike, before Ridgewells clumsy tackle on substitute Crouch ended Villas resistance. 

Liverpool climbed four spots to ninth in the table, seven places ahead of Villa. 

League leaders Chelsea will travel to Manchester United on Sunday.

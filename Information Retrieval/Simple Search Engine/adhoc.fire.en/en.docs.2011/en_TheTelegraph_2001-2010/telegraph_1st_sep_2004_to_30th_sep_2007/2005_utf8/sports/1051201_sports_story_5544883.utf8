 Underprepared track hogs limelight

 - Bengal to go in with 3 spinners vs Delhi 

 The focus will be on Sourashish 

New Delhi: Delhi would be banking on their slow bowlers to deliver the goods when they take on Bengal in the Ranji Trophy Elite group A league match starting here tomorrow. 

With Ferozeshah Kotla undergoing preparations for hosting the second Test against Sri Lanka, the four-day second-round match would be played at the Jamia Millia University ground. 

The JMU track traditionally favours the spinners and it looks to play no different this time. 

In the womens Test played at the same venue last week, off-spinner Nitu David did the damage before the touring English eves held on for a draw. 

Having failed to score a point against Mumbai at the Kotla, the pressure will be that much more on Madanlals wards. 

We have to pull up our socks. We have prepared a turner and it is up to the spinners to get the maximum out of it, said the Delhi coach on the eve of the match. 

Delhi have included Rahul Sanghvi and left out Aditya Jain while Abhinav Bali makes way for Shikhar Dhawan who missed the first match as he played for Board Presidents XI. 

Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey was not happy with the pitch. 

It is underprepared, but I dont know if they did not really have the time or chose to give us a wicket like that. 

But we have the spinners to do the job, Bengal is not all about Shib Shankar Paul and Ranadeb Bose, he said. 

The focus will be on off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri who ended with a ten-wicket haul in the opening game against Maharashtra. 

Bengal have decided to go in with three spinners in Lahiri, Shib Sagar Singh and Manoj Tewari.

Bengal (likely): Deep Dasgupta (captain), Arindam Das, Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Subhomoy Das, Sourashish Lahiri, Shib Sankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose, Manoj Tewari, Sib Sagar Singh.

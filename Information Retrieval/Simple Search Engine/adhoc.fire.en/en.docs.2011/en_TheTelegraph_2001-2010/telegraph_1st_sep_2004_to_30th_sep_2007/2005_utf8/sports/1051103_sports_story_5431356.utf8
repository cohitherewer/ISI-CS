The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ghei appears confident about chances

Rayong (Thailand): Buoyed by his second place finish in the Indian Open, Gaurav Ghei will hope to go one better when he leads a strong 11-member Indian contingent at the inaugural $300,000 Double A International Open at St Andrews Hill Golf Club starting on Thursday. 

Ghei, who was lying 75th before the Hero Honda Indian Open, zoomed to 43rd place with a sole second that won him $32,400, his biggest cheque in 10 years since he won his only Asian Tour title in 1995. The victory also secured his 2006 Asian Tour card. 

Also in the fray here will be Mukesh Kumar, who finished sixth at the Indian Open, and the young duo of Shiv Kapur and Ashok Kumar, who finished tied eighth at the Indian Open last week. 

It felt good to be back in the fray and I am feeling good about my game, said Ghei, who turned 37 on Sunday, the final day of the Indian Open. 

Other Indians in the field will include Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon, Digvijay Singh, Rahil Gangjee, Uttam Singh Mundy, Arjun Singh and Firoz Ali. 

The favourite, as has often been this season, will be the Thai star Thaworn Wiratchant who will gun for a first title on home soil. Wiratchant has been in terrific form, winning his third title of the year and seventh in his career at last weeks Indian Open which strengthened his lead at the top of the Asian Tour Order of Merit. He already has the Indonesian and Taiwan Open in his bag. 

The par-73 St Andrews hill course boasts of a daunting 878-yard par six hole. 

The unorthodox swinging 38-year old Thai said, I was quite lucky with my win last week but Im not too confident with my performance here. The golf course is very difficult and hilly, so it will be a challenge. Wiratchant has already earned $448,225 this year, a record number of wins in a single season. 

The pressure is mounting on two-time Asian Tour number one Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand. Jaidee needs a win at the Double A International Open if he is to catch Wiratchant in the race to become Asias top player. 

Jaidee may compete in only a couple more events as he is attempting to win his US PGA Tour card at qualifying school later this month. 

If I make it through to the final stage of qualifying, Im going to miss a few events. I would like to win the Order of Merit but Wiratchant will be favoured as he is playing in many more tournaments, said Jaidee. 

The highly debated 878-yard par six fourth hole at St Andrews hill remained a talking point in Thailands newest event. It is the first time a par six is being played on the Asian Tour, and it is also believed to be the first time on any major Tour. 

Wiratchant ran up a bogey during the pro-Am on Wednesday and said he was opposed to the idea of going against golfs traditions. 

I am against this par six hole because its too long. If I drive it too much to the left, Ill be in trouble and if the drive goes right, it will end up in the water, said Wiratchant. 

I was in the water yesterday and was eventually on the green in six and one-putted for bogey. Its hard. 

The Double A International Open is the 23rd leg of this seasons Asian Tour. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia decision after meeting Bhowmick 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhaichung Bhutia 

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia, who landed in the city on Saturday after having played for the Malaysian club MK Land, will take the final decision on playing for East Bengal only after he discusses the matter with coach Subhas Bhowmick who is expected to be back from Shantiniketan on Wednesday. 

It will take another two-three days to finalise the deal, but now I have come here to enjoy the Pujas, Bhaichung told The Telegraph on Saturday evening. 

According to the former India captain, he hasnt spoken to any of the club officials or the coach during these days. I have landed only this afternoon and didnt get enough time to speak to anybody, Bhaichung said. 

Bhaichung seemed hopeful about playing for the red-and-golds this season, but refused to divulge his plan in case the deal fails. His contract with the Malaysian Club expires on October 31. 

However, East Bengal club sources revealed that they had a preliminary discussion with the star footballer and he is expected to sign within a few days after the team returns from Shantiniketan, where they are undergoing training before the Federation Cup.

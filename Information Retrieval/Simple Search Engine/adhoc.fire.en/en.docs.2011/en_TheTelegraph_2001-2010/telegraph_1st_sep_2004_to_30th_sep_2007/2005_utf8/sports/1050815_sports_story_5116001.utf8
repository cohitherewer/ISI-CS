 Chinese start favourites

Anaheim : China will look to bolster its already formidable reputation, while Malaysia is hoping there is strength in numbers at the World Badminton Championships which begin here on Monday. 

China heads towards the meet as the top seeds in mens singles, womens singles and womens doubles. 

In mens singles, Chinese hopes rest on world No.1 Lin Dan. He will face tough competition from 2004 Olympic gold medallist Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia, and Denmarks Kenneth Jonassen. 

Reigning world and Olympic champion Zhang Ning will be looking forward to retain her singles title by holding off compatriot Xie Xing-Fang. 

Meanwhile, Indias Arvind Bhat and Aparna Popat will start with tough matches. Bhat faces 11th seed Boonsak Ponsana of Thailand, while Popat will play 10th seed Petya Nedeltcheva of Bulgaria.

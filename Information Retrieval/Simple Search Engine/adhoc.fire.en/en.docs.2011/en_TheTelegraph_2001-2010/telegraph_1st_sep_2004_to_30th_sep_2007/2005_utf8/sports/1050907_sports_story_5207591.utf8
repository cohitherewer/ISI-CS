The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Common link between Ritwik, Bhaichung

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhutia is surprised to be compared with Ritwik 

Calcutta: Ritwik Bhattacharya wont mind the label of the Bhaichung Bhutia of Indian squash. For, Indias leading squash player can easily relate his fight ? to put India on the international squash map ? with Bhaichungs vis-?-vis soccer. 

What Bhaichung has done to Indian football is exemplary. Like me, he had to do it all on his own and paved the way for others to think big, said Ritwik, who is in town to play in the Calcutta International Squash Championship. 

At a time when Indian football is languishing in a swamp of old-aged notions reeking amateurism, Bhaichung dared to dream big. He went to England, had a stint with second-division club Bury FC and changed the perception of the game in India. 

Ritwiks story has followed a similar script. Six years ago, he turned pro and shifted base to London for modern training under Neil Harvey. In next to no time, he became the first Indian to break into the worlds top-100. 

Ritwiks comparison, however, has taken Bhaichung aback. 

Im surprised hes comparing himself with me. I havent him though Im aware that Ritwik, Saurav (Ghosal) and Joshna (Chinappa) are doing well. Their role will be vital, Bhaichung told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

According to the star striker, it was setting a standard for himself that had inspired him to leave for England. When I landed there, people found it very funny that anybody from south-east Asia was claiming to be a footballer. Its as if a Brazilian cricketer was trying to get into the East Bengal or Mohun Bagan team, Bhaichung, who is currently contracted with Malaysias MK Land, pointed out. 

World No. 62 Ritwik has a similar story to narrate. When I became national champion in 1998, I was astonished to see the vast gap between national and international level. I wanted to play at a higher level, so I had to be based abroad. My stint in England have provided my game more focus and maturity? 

While Ritwik is happy the likes of Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa have the potential to enrich Indian squash, Bhaichung paints a not-so-rosy picture. 

The AIFF has to be professional in nurturing talents? unless they back them, the players wont be motivated to look beyond India, Bhutia said.

 Inzy eyes double joy Down Under

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haq left for Australia hoping the tour would provide him double joy ? win the ICC award(s) and help World XI beat Australia in the six-day Super Test. 

I am hoping to win both awards I have been nominated for (Player of the Year and Test Player of the Year). But any of the two would be great because it would be a universal recognition of ones achievements, Inzamam said in Karachi en route to for Sydney. 

The ICC awards fiunction will be held in Sydney on October 11, while the Super Test gets underway at the SCG on October 14. 

Inzamam, who was very upset at not being picked for any of the World XI squads, was later called up as Sachin Tendulkars replacement in the Test party. 

The peeved Pakistan captain had also commented that he was unlikely to get any of the ICC awards as it would reflect poorly on the selectors who had picked the World XI squads. 

Inzamam has scored 568 Test runs at 94.67 and 704 ODI runs at a little over 50 this year. 

Inzamam said his controversial selection has made him more determined and committed to perform. 

The pressure is definitely on me, particularly after all the controversy surrounding my exclusion, then inclusion and my initial decision to skip the event. 

Most eyes would be focused on me but I have put everything behind and look forward to guiding World XI to a memorable victory over Australia who are still the best Test team in the world. 

England won the Ashes but one series win doesnt give them the worlds best tag. You have to produce the same consistency as the West Indies produced in the 70s and 80s, and the Australians thereafter, Inzamam said. 

The 35-year-old batsman didnt agree that this would be his last tour of Australia, a country where he burst into international fame during the 1992 World Cup. 

I understand Pakistans next tour of Australia will be in 2008. If I continue to perform, I would be around then and could make the 2008 trip.

 Arup Basak picks up a double

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Age hardly turned out to be an impediment for Arup Basak as he picked up a double in the 71st State and Inter District Table Tennis Championship at the Khudiram Anushilan Kendra on Tuesday. First, he teamed up with Souvik Basu Roy in claiming the mens doubles and then, along with wife Kanchan, bagged the mixed doubles title. 

The former Commonwealth and national champion Arup Basak later said that there was a lot of table tennis left in him at the age of 33. 

For the past five years I have been ignored for the national team, but that doesnt hurt me. I know this has been done intentionally, but I know that there is a lot of table tennis left in my life, said Arup.

 Indians fail to qualify 

Kuala Lumpur: India?s hopes of making it to the British Open golf Masters were dashed as all the four contenders failed to make an impact at the International Final qualifying-Asia at Saujana Golf and Country Club here Thursday. 

Singapore?s Mardan Mamat walked away with the top spot while the second qualifier, local lad Danny Chia became the first Malaysian to make it to the Open. Australian Richard Moir won the last ticket. 

The four Indians in the fray failed to make a mark. Amandeep Johl ended at one-under 143 (73, 70), while Jeev Milkha Singh (71, 73) was at par, and Rahil Gangjee (73, 74) at three-over. Jyoti Randhawa pulled out after the first round of two-over 74. (PTI)

 BCCI panel in 48 hours

New Delhi: Nearly three weeks after John Wright relinquished his post, the BCCI Thursday said it will appoint a committee in a couple of days to select a new coach for the team. 

?We will constitute a committee in the next 48 hours which will decide on the next coach for the Indian team,? BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra said here. 

One understands that among others, former cricketers like Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri are going to be on the committee. Shastri, for example, has already been sounded out. 

Mahendra said the committee will shortlist the candidates and recommend the name of the coach and a final decision will be taken by the BCCIs working committee which is likely to meet later this month. (agencies)

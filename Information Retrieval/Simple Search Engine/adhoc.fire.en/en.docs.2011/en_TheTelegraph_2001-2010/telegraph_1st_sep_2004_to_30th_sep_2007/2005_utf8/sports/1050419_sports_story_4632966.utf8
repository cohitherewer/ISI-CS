 Moscow: Lokomotiv Moscow coach Yuri Syomin is to take over Russia?s national team, the head of the country?s football union said on Monday. ?Yuri Syomin will be seconded to the national team and starting tomorrow will be acting as the main coach,? Russian Football Union (RFU) president Vitaly Mutko said on state television. Syomin, who took Lokomotiv to the Russian title last year, replaces Georgy Yartsev.

 Yartsev resigned earlier this month after new RFU president Mutko had hinted that he would sack him. Syomin?s appointment will be reviewed in December, Mutko said. Under Yartsev, Russia struggled in their World Cup qualifying campaign and were held 1-1 by tiny former Soviet neighbours Estonia in March. Russia are third in European Group Three, three points behind Portugal and Slovakia halfway through the campaign.

 Bucharest: The owner of Romanian first division side Universitatea Craiova said on Sunday he is willing to give the club to the city council for free. Craiova lost 0-1 at home to leaders Steaua Bucharest on Sunday, their fifth defeat in a row, and face the prospect of their first ever relegation from the top flight as they lie bottom with 14 points from 20 matches.

 ?Every start has an end,? owner Dinel Staicu told reporters. ?At this moment I have no solution to save the team from relegation. I?m disappointed but can?t fight against the media and supporters? constant attacks.? Staicu said he would offer the club to the city council without asking for money.

 Berlin: Dutchman Dick Advocaat resigned as Borussia Moenchengladbach coach less than six months into the job on Monday after they slipped to within a point of the Bundesliga relegation zone. Advocaat, who led the Netherlands to the Euro 2004 semi-finals, was appointed in November but failed to turn round the teams fortunes. They were 14th when he took over and are now 15th in the 18-team standings. quot;In the current situation the well being of the club was paramount. I think that I will take pressure off the club and the team with my resignation and hope to give them the push Borussia needs to stay up,? he said.

 London: Arsenal striker Thierry Henry is likely to miss the Premier League match against leaders Chelsea on Wednesday owing to a groin injury, manager Arsene Wenger said on Monday.

 The Frenchman, who is the league?s leading scorer with 25 goals this season, sat out Saturday?s 3-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Blackburn Rovers.

 quot;In my opinion Thierry will miss the game,? Wenger told Arsenals website.

 quot;We will miss him as he?s an exceptional player. But we can do more collectively and try to compensate.?

 Wenger said he would make a late decision about whether to include defender Sol Campbell from the start. The England international has not played since February 1 due to an ankle injury.

 Raleigh: American sprinter Marion Jones made a disappointing seasonal debut when she finished last in a six-woman 400 metres race at the Mt San Antonio College Relays in Walnut, California, on Sunday. 

 Jones faded down the finishing straight and was timed in 55.03 seconds, more than five seconds slower than her coach had hoped she would run.

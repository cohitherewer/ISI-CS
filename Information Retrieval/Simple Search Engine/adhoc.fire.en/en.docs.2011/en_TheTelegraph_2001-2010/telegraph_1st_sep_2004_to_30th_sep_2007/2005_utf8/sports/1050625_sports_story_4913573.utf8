 Peshawar ruled out

 - ENGLAND TOUR TO PAK 

Karachi: Peshawar was technically ruled out as a possible venue for this winters tour of England when the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the England cricket board inspectors would not visit the border-city. 

The ECB officials will only inspect facilities and security at Karachi, Multan, Faisalabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi/Islamabad. The first batch of two-man security team will arrive in Karachi on June 27 while the two ECB officials will arrive in Islamabad on July 3, an official of the cricket board said. 

When inquired why the English officials were not visiting Peshawar, the official said because Peshawar is not the venue for England matches. 

England will arrive in Pakistan on October 22 for three Tests and five one-day Internationals. 

Peshawar, along with Karachi, are considered turbulent areas, with the English officials being candid on Kara-chi saying that they do not want to be trapped in crossfire. 

India had also expressed similar reservations over playing Tests in Karachi and Peshawar, but later agreed to make flying visits to the two cities for one-day matches. The PCBs decision drew immediate criticism from Peshawar Cricket Association officials though they requested anonymity saying they would first request the administration to review their decision through proper channels.

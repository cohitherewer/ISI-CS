Port-of-Spain: Part-time off-spinner Chris Gayle took four wickets for nine runs on Monday as the West Indies fought back on Day 4 of the second Test to restrict South Africas first-innings lead to 51. 

The tourists, resuming at 370 for six, were dismissed for 398. The hosts were 26 for one in their second innings at lunch, with Wavell Hinds on eight not out and Ramnaresh Sarwan on nine. 

Captain Graeme Smith compiled 148 as South Africa ground out a first-innings lead against the West Indies on the third day. 

In reply to the West Indies? first-innings total of 347, South Africa resumed on 182 for three Sunday and closed in the ascendancy at 370 for six, a lead of 23 runs. 

Smith, 90 overnight, reached his ninth Test century in the morning, and third against the West Indies, with a single to third man off the 213th ball he faced. But he was out midway the second session after hitting 17 fours off 313 balls in seven and-a-half hours. 

The West Indies limited South Africa to just 188 runs in the day, but managed to claim only three wickets, one in each session. Left-arm pacer Pedro Collins took two for 78 while Wavell Hinds grabbed one for nine with his part-time medium pace. 

?It?s been a while since I got an important Test hundred 

and it means a lot,? Smith said. (AP)

Rome: Third seed Serena Williams tumbled out of the Rome Masters when she lost 6-7, 1-6 to home favourite Francesca Schiavone on Wednesday. 

The 2002 champion, on her first competitive outing since an ankle sprain, looked desperately short of match play against the unfancied Italian, ranked 26th in the world. 

Asked whether her game had been affected by the injury, Williams replied: No. I had a really good warm-up. I thought everything would come together but it didnt. 

I think everyone in their career has their worst loss. This is mine. It wont happen again. 

Williams was not the only high-ranking player to fall in the second round. In an earlier match fourth seed Elena Dementieva lost 5-7, 4-6 to Gisela Dulko of Argentina. 

There were no such troubles for defending champion Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo, however, who cruised past Australias Samantha Stosur 6-2, 6-0. 

Williams looked sluggish as she fended off break points in her opening two service games. She broke Schiavone in the fifth game but the Italian broke straight back then held off three break points in the ninth to force a tiebreak, which she raced through as Williams made a string of backhand errors. 

The American dropped serve in the opening game of the second set and then slipped further behind when Schiavone produced a succession of crisp groundstrokes to break twice more and close out the match. 

Dementieva, 23, was also carrying an injury ? a hip problem that forced her out of last weeks Berlin Open ? and was dragged around the court by Dulkos precise and consistent groundstrokes. 

The world number five joined compatriots Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Likhovtseva in exiting the tournament, though wins for seventh seed Nadia Petrova and sixth-seeded Vera Zvonareva meant the Russians retained their formidable presence at the event. 

Petrova, who reached the final in Berlin, confirmed her recent good form with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Italys Mara Santangelo, while Zvonareva saw off the challenge of Serbia and Montenegros Jelena Jankovic 6-4, 6-1. 

Second seed Mauresmo, who received a bye in the opening round, was barely tested by Stosur. She next faces 13th seed Silvia Farina Elia, who beat French qualifier Stephanie Cohen-Aloro 6-3, 6-3. 

The Italian should be a much tougher test for Mauresmo, who saved two match points on the way to beating her in the quarter-finals of last seasons Rome tournament.

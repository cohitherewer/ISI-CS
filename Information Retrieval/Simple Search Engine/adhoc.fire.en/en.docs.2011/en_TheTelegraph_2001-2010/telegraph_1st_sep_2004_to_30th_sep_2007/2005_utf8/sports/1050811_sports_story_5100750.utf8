 Shoulder injury rules out Pathan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Chaminda Vaas and Irfan Pathan have been ruled out of the Asia squad for the three ODIs against Africa. While Pathan has a shoulder injury, Vaas played only the final of the tri-series after being sidelined by a hamstring strain. Having come off a lay-off, he probably thus isnt too keen. 

Sanath Jayasuriya is also in doubt for the three ODIs in South Africa as he has not fully recovered from a shoulder dislocation. 

The matches are scheduled on August 17, 20 and 21. Centurion will host the first match, Durban the next two. 

Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra are the likely replacements and have been sounded out. Zaheers view is not yet known, but one learns Nehra is not too keen on making the trip because Indias tour of Zimbabwe follows soon after. 

Meanwhile, two players ? South Africas Albie Morkel and Zimbabwean Andy Blignaut ? pulled out of the African side after failing to recover from injuries, acting CEO of South African Cricket, Cassim Suliman, said in a statement in Durban, adds PTI. 

Suliman added South African Justin Kemp has been drafted into the side.

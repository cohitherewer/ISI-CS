 Anand still in lead despite loss

Mainz: Viswanathan Anand was on the threshold of victory despite losing the sixth game to Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk of Russia in the Grenke Leasing Championship, the main event of the Mainz Classic. 

Even with Anand going a bit haywire, the lead remained unchanged in this high-profile contest, also touted as the world rapid championship. 

With four points in his kitty, Anand was still in command, needing just half a point from the last two games as Grischuk, having two points so far, has a daunting task on hand to beat Anand twice before forcing a play-off for the crown. 

Interestingly, the Russian decided to play the Ordix Open, another rapid event which is a part of the classic, earlier in the day. 

Grischuk, the defending champion in this section, probably considered the match against Anand already over and decided to play the open section where he started off with five victories on the trot to share a six-way lead. 

GM and world junior champion P. Harikrishna was on four points in this section. 

Anand had drawn the fifth game of the match without much ado in just 22 moves, but failed to keep the balance ticking in the next one and went down after an intense struggle, leaving Grischuk in with a chance to come back in the match. 

The fifth game saw Grischuk up against the same variation that Anand had employed in his previous black game but could not do much as Anand liquidated the centre in quick time. 

Grischuk was a pawn less at the time of draw agreement with enough compensation. 

However the white pieces, for once, became a cause of concern for Anand. It was another Sicilian Defence with a twist in the tale as Anands idea of transposition to less trodden paths in the opening did not come good. 

Sacrificing a pawn early in the opening, Anand had sufficient piece play but Grischuks timely strike in the centre as well as on the queenside forced trading of queens. 

Further liquidation at regular intervals led the game in to a minor piece endgame that was childs play for grischuk. Anand called it a day after 49 moves. 

Speaking about the sixth game, Anand said, it was one of those games where you know you shouldnt do it, but you still play the bad moves. 

Grischuk was in fine mood after five victories in the Ordix and the first one against Anand. I had not won any game for about three months now and I just wanted to score some victories so I decided to give it a shot, the Russian said. 

Meanwhile, in the Finet chess 960 championship, Russian Peter Svidler stretched his lead to two points over Hungarian Zoltan Almasi.

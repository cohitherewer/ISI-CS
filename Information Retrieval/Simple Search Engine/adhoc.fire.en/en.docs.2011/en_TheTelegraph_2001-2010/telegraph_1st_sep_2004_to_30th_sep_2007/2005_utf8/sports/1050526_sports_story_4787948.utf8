 Harmison looms large over Bangladesh

 - First Test - England look to sharpen skills

London: For England, the first Test against Bangladesh will not be about winning. It will be about the taking apart. 

Only a thumping victory will do, preferably with strike bowler Steve Harmison to the fore. 

Stand Harmison back-to-back with most Bangladeshi batsmen and he towers above them like man over boy. The image is a perfect one for the two-Test series starting at Lords on Thursday. 

Banglas Australian coach, Dav Whatmore, will limit his goals to competing session by session and, with luck and a little rain, to reaching the fifth day. England, with the Ashes to follow, will want a quick kill and Monday off. 

A match-winning performance from Harmison ? as conjured up in Dhaka in his only previous game against Bangladesh in late 2003 ? plus an incident-free rehabilitation for allrounder Andrew Flintoff following ankle surgery will top Englands wish-list. 

Harmison, though, must be at his best if England are to test Australia. The worlds No. 1 bowler when England set off for South Africa in December, Harmison ended that tour bereft of line, length and rhythm. 

I think my confidence did need building up a bit after South Africa although I didnt feel it was all doom and gloom, Harmison said. The rub of the green did not go my way, with a few catches and a few decisions. 

He arrived at Lords, however, in good form for his County Durham. 

Left-arm spinner Ashley Giles has been ruled out of the match because of a hip injury. He will be replaced by off-spinner Gareth Batty. 

Pace bowler Simon Jones, who has recovered from a back problem, was selected ahead of seamer Jonathan Lewis. 

Vaughan will move up from four to three in the batting order to allow Ian Bell to follow the England skipper in his second appearance for England. 

The tour warm-up matches, though, have not offered Whatmore much solace, particularly during the innings-and-226-run defeat by a second-string Sussex side, although 16-year-old Mushfiqur Rahims century against Northamptonshire was a pleasant bonus. 

The teenager has a bright chance of becoming the youngest cricketer to make his debut at the Lords. 

The 21-year-old right-arm quick Mashrafe Mortaza and Enamul Haque Jr, still only 18 and a left-arm spinner of genuine promise, have yet to shine as the side makes its Lords debut. 

THE TEAMS 

England: Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan (captain), Ian Bell, Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Gareth Batty, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Steve Harmison. 

Bangladesh (from): Habibul Bashar (captain), Khaled Mashud, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Ashraful, Javed Omar, Rajin Saleh, Nafis Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Shahriar Nafees Ahmed, Mohammad Rafique, Enamul Haque, Mashrafe Mortaza, Tapash Baisya, Anwar Hossain, Talha Zubair, Shahadat Hossain.

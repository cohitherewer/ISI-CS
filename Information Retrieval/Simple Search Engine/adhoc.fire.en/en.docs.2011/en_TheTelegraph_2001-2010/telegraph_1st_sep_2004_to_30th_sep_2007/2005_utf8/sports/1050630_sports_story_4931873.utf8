 Hewitt runs into Federer

 - Roddick to face Johansson 

 Roger Federer after his win over 

 Fernando Gonzalez on Wednesday

London: Roger Federer swatted aside Fernando Gonzalez 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 on Centre Court on Wednesday, leaving only two players between the world No. 1 and a hattrick of Wimbledon titles. The World No. 1 will face the challenge of World No. 2 Lleyton Hewitt, who dashed into the semi-finals for a second time with a ruthless 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 victory over Spains Feliciano Lopez. 

It was a magnificent machine-like quarter final performance from the Swiss grass master, who had already beaten Gonzalez once this month on the Chileans favoured clay surface in the third round of the French Open. 

The 24-year-old Gonzalez, with his big forehand and useful serve, was the only man to reach the last eight without dropping a set. 

But every time he looked like getting a foothold in the match, Federer simply selected another weapon from his armoury. 

Mostly the pair traded punches from the back of the court. Gonzalez even managed to break back in the seventh game of the first set after Federer had taken a 4-2 lead. 

The Swiss always had the advantage of serving first and he upped his pace, advancing to the net in the 12th game to take the set on his second set point when Gonzalez put the ball in the net. 

The second set was something of a formality. Gonzalez turned up the volume on his explosive sighs and grunts of exertion as Federer pushed him round the court, breaking his serve in the second and last games. He needed only one set point. 

The Chilean fought hard in the final set staying with the Swiss until the tiebreak. There was always the impression that Federer was playing within himself, however, and he wasted no time in the decider, winning 7-2 with an ace on matchpoint. 

Im feeling happy and satisfied with the way I played ? I knew he was going to be dangerous, Federer said as he came off court. I can beat any player with this level of play. 

The next opponent in Federers sights is Australias 2002 Wimbledon champion Hewitt, whom he beat in last years quarter finals. 

Hewitt, however, displayed his usual brand of gutsy tennis to end the surprise progress of the 26th seeded Lopez in just under two hours and set up a tantalising last-four showdown with twice champion Federer. 

Its great, last time I got to the semis, I went on to win the tournament so hopefully its a good omen, said the third seed, who has lost to Federer in their last seven meetings. 

Hewitt, who triumphed at the All England Club in 2002 before Federer took a grip of the championships, produced a focused performance against a player who was contesting his first Grand Slam quarter final. 

Lopez, the first Spanish mens quarter-finalist since in 1972, is a rare breed among his countrymen as he favours to serve and volley. 

He religiously stuck to his tactics by coming into the net after every first serve but in the end his reluctance to change his strategy proved his downfall. 

The Spaniard earned the sympathy of the crowd when he was docked a point in the third game for calling a Hewitt serve out. 

In a repeat of the first set, Hewitt broke Lopez again in the final game of the second when his opponent sliced a backhand into the net. Although Lopez hung on for dear life in the third, Hewitt turned on the power in the tiebreak to clinch it 7-2 and raced back into the locker room before the heavens opened over Centre Court. 

Andy Roddick was forced to battle through five sets to defeat Sebastien Grosjean 3-6, 6-2, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 on Wednesday and take his place in the Wimbledon semis for the third successive year. 

The American second seed had not lost a set to his practice partner in five matches but that streak was swiftly brought to an end as the 27-year-old Frenchmans flamboyant game gave him an early lead. 

The former US Open, runner-up to Roger Federer last year, then cranked up his formidable serve and took the second set with some ease as Grosjean lost his self-belief. 

An early break in the decisive fifth put Roddick on course for a semi-final match against Swede Thomas Johansson who downed a sluggish David Nalbandian 7-6, 6-2, 6-2. 

A veteran of nine Wimbledon campaigns, 30-year-old Johansson looked entirely at ease on a sunny Court One after a brief early break for a passing shower. Im so surprised. I didnt think I was going to do it, a grinning Johansson said as he left the court. Im happy to be the oldest guy in it. 

Johansson, who won in Melbourne in 2002, is the first Swede since Stefan Edberg in 1993 to reach a Wimbledon semi-final.

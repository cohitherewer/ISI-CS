London: Chelsea, AC Milan and Olympique Lyon booked their places in the Champions League quarter finals after a goal bonanza by Europe?s elite on Tuesday. 

Chelsea qualified after a thriller at Stamford Bridge, taking a 3-0 lead inside the first 20 minutes before Ronaldinho replied twice ahead of the break and captain John Terry then headed home for 4-2 on the night to ensure a 5-4 aggregate win. 

Milan repeated their 1-0 win over Manchester United of a fortnight ago as they came through the second leg of their knockout round tie, with Argentine striker Hernan Crespo again scoring the only goal in the return at the San Siro. 

Lyon, who had already trounced Werder Bremen 3-0 in Germany, handed out an even bigger 7-2 hiding at the Stade Gerland, courtesy of a hattrick by striker Sylvain Wiltord. 

The place to be for drama though was west London, where Chelsea?s task was to overturn their 1-2 defeat in an acrimonious first leg that has left the club and its outspoken coach Jose Mourinho at loggerheads with Uefa. 

Goals from Iceland striker Eidur Gudjohnsen, England midfielder Frank Lampard and Ireland winger Damien Duff gave the Premier League leaders a dream start before the tide began to turn. 

A clumsy handball by Portugal defender Paulo Ferreira gave Barcelona a penalty that Ronaldinho converted on 27 minutes. 

Brazil?s World Cup winner followed up 11 minutes later with an exquisite strike from 20 metres and his side were heading for the last eight until Terry nodded home in the 76th minute. 

The match ended on a sour note with an ugly fracas involving players and officials, along with allegations by Barcelona?s Cameroon striker Samuel Eto?o that he had been racially abused by a Chelsea steward as he headed for the tunnel. 

Terry?s goal decided what was already an embittered contest after the first leg, when Mourinho snubbed the news conference following an incident in the tunnel at halftime and his team finished with 10 men after a red card for striker Didier Drogba. 

Chelsea?s feat, similar to their comeback victory over Liverpool in the League Cup final 10 days ago, could not be matched by Premier League rivals United. 

Milan had the edge in a free-flowing game and were rewarded when Crespo, on loan from Chelsea, rose to meet Cafu?s cross from the right with a magnificent looping header over American keeper Tim Howard. 

Milan had nearly taken a first-half lead when Brazil playmaker Kaka crashed a shot against the crossbar, while United boss Alex Ferguson was left to rue an earlier Ryan Giggs effort that hit the post. 

It was third time unlucky for United, who were knocked out of the European Cup semi-finals by Milan in 1958 and as holders in 1969 in their two previous meetings. 

It was also revenge for Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti, whose Juventus side had famously lost 2-3 to United after leading 2-0 in the 1999 semi-finals in Turin, allowing Ferguson?s men to go on and win the trophy. 

The final will be played on May 25 in Istanbul.

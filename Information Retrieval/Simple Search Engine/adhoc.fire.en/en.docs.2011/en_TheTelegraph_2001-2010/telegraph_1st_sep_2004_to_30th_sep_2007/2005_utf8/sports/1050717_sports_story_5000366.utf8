Bangalore: V.V.S. Laxman cracked a century while Rahul Dravid got out for a first-ball duck in the action-filled first practice match among the Indian probables on Saturday. 

Virender Sehwag XI, opting for first strike, made 226 for eight in 45 overs. Laxman, keen to show Greg Chappell his one-day prowess, stole the show. His 101 came off 111 balls with 10 fours. Jai Prakash Yadav was second-best with 30. 

Irfan Pathan, Amit Bhandari and Sreeshanth bagged two wickets each, Shib Shankar Paul got one. 

Dravid XI cantered home in 32.4 overs, losing five wickets. Dravids opposite number failed with the bat as well. Sehwag scrambled a single off 13 deliveries before being trapped leg-before by Amit Bhandari. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni kept wickets for Dravid XI initially but was later replaced by Parthiv Patel. 

Dravid XI started disastrously with the skipper being caught by Dinesh Karthik off Lakshmipathy Balaji. 

Yuvraj Singh made a polished 56 off 54 balls with eight fours and a six, Suresh Raina hit 38 while Dhoni rode two lives to make 35. 

Neeraj Patel (34 not out) and Y. Venugopal Rao (27 not out) saw their side through with lots to spare. 

The probables will play two more practice games ? a day-night benefit match for former Test player David Johnson on Sunday and another day game on the concluding day of the camp Monday.

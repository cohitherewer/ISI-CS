 Pietersen, the dashing prince 

 - It was one of crickets most memorable days 

John Woodcock

 Pietersens knock was a real tour de force 

And so the deathless deed is done. After the most gripping of all Test series, at times almost unbearably tense and unwatch-ably exciting, the Ashes are back and life can return to normal. There is no better sport for the English than beating Australia at cricket, and when it has not happened for nearly two decades it comes as a deliverance, to be accompanied by all the relative hymns. 

Not even in 1926 and 1953, when England also broke free from long years of Australian dominance, was the atmosphere at The Oval quite as frenzied as it was on Monday. The scene then, with every rooftop filled, was more that of a coronation than a cricket match, and, in a sense, a coronation it was. It was one of crickets most memorable days, not only for English cricket but for cricket around the world. 

This was no ordinary Australian side. Until a few weeks ago their opponents came in awe. They arrived in England expecting to win. They had a record second to none. To have beaten them roundly and squarely reflects the utmost credit not only on the England side but on all who contributed towards their preparation. To have lost on Monday, as seemed horribly likely at lunchtime, would have been too crushing a disappointment, one to undo not all of what the series has meant to cricket in England, but to have cast a shadow across it. 

Michael Vaughan and his side have an awkward winter ahead. Their attack is built almost entirely upon pace, and in every city on the sub-continent you will find a fast bowlers graveyard. But for the moment there is a famous success to celebrate, made possible finally by an innings that will long be talked about, the innings made possible by an incident ? a dropped catch ? heavy with irony. 

For its temerity alone, Pietersens innings was breathtaking. But it was brilliant too. There were, almost inevitably, other slices of luck, but that was no more than he deserved. His 158 is the score that Basil DOliveira made in 1968, against Australia at The Oval, an innings that also left an impression, of a very different kind, on the rich pattern of the game. 

The others who might have been capable of it were much less outgoing than Pietersen. In that category fall Ted Dexter and Walter Hammond, both wonderful strikers of the ball and much greater players than Pietersen is yet, but from another chapel. Adam Gilchrist might have played the innings in question, as might several West Indians, one or two Pakistanis, Kapil Dev of India and Graeme Pollock, the South African; but those who could have done are precious few. 

Pietersens was a real tour de force, an expression of unconformity as much as of exceptional, if mercurial, ability. He whips the ball away on the leg side, often across the line and with a flick of the wrist that is more Indian than Anglo-Saxon in conception, depending, as it does, so much more on eye than adherence to the textbook. This may not be the time to say so, but Pietersen should really be playing for South Africa. For all that, he leaves no one in any doubt as to his commitment to the England cause. And even to an old codger like me, he can wear his hair in all or any colours of the rainbow when he bats against Australia as he did with the Ashes hanging in the balance.

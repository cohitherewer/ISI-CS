 Inzy has matured as captain: Imran

 Inzamam has been the best batsman in the world for the past 10 years, feels Imran 

Karachi: Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan on Wednesday said Inzamam-ul Haq had matured as captain during the tough cricket tour of India and had led the young side by his own example. 

?For me, the high point of the series was Inzamam?s captaincy from the front and Sourav Ganguly?s failure to do the same for India,? Imran said. 

The 53-year-old had criticised Inzamam?s captaincy skills after Pakistan?s 0-3 rout in Australia earlier this year. ?I had said that he did not lead from the front in Australia. But in India, he looked more involved and captaincy seemed to have matured and improved him as a batsman as well.? 

Ranked underdogs before the tour, Pakistan surprised critics by drawing a three-match Test series 1-1 with a come-from-behind win in the third Test at Bangalore and then upstaged India 4-2 in the one-day series on Sunday. 

The 35-year-old Inzamam stood out both as captain and batsman, notching a brilliant 184 at Bangalore and capping his 100th Test with a win. 

?Inzamam doesn?t realise his ability as a batsman. I have been saying that he is the best batsman in the world for the past ten years,? Imran said. 

?Inzamam is probably the greatest match winner for Pakistan as a batsman, much more than any of his contemporaries,? said Imran, who launched Inzamam as a 22-year-old during Pakistan?s World Cup triumph in 1992. 

The former Pkaistan captain also praised Younis Khan. 

?The other difference was Younis coming at number three. He changed the Bangalore Test with his double hundred and gave a solution to Pakistan?s No. 3 problems,? said Imran, tipping Younis as a future captain. 

Younis overcame a poor batting and fielding performance in the drawn first Test at Mohali to hit a century in the second Test at Calcutta, which Pakistan lost. He then propped up the tourists? batting with an epic 267 and a brilliant unbeaten 84 at Bangalore. 

?Pakistan lost a home series to India last year primarily because they did not have a good No. 3 batsman then,? Imran said. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Visitors falter again

 - 2nd U-19 ?test? 

 - Indian colts in command on Day I

Calcutta: It seems the England under-19 boys are finding it absolutely difficult to face the spinners on these sub-continent wickets. The visiting batsmen faltered for the third time in-a-row when they were skittled out for a paltry 147, well before tea on the first day of the second ?Test? at Eden on Thursday. In reply, the hosts were 119 for two when stumps were drawn. India lead the series 1-0. 

 Opting to bat first on windy conditions, 

 England top-order batsmen didn?t have anyone to blame but 

 themselves as they threw away wickets. Only opener Joseph 

 Denly put up some resistance and was the top-scorer with 

 56. Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (four for 37) and medium-pacer 

 Gaurav Dhiman (three for 33) were two most successful bowlers. 

 Chawla replaced Avinash Yadav from the squad that played 

 the first ?Test?.

 The visitors lost their first 

 wicket in the second over of the day when Michel O?Shea 

 was caught behind by ?keeper Pinal Shah off Dhiman. But 

 other opener Joseph Denly looked solid at the other end 

 and was there till the 51st over. 

The batsmen had absolutely no clue about playing the Indian spinners particularly, Chawla. Harvinder Singh also assisted Chawla well and finished with figures of three for 10. 

Both Indian openers Robin Uthappa and Sikhar Dhawan played some brilliant shots on the off-side in the initial overs to give the hosts a solid start. All of a sudden, India lost their first wicket in Uthappa (22) at the team total of 37. 

Faiz Fazal then joined the party with in-form Dhawan. Both the batsmen looked in prime form and didn?t hesitate to attack the bowlers. . The match was called off because of bad light, with three overs short. 

It would have been good had the Indians not lost the wicket of Dhawan (41). Ambati Rayudu was on 23 at close, along with Fazal (21). 

England coach Andy Pick blamed his batsmen for the poor show. ?We have committed the same mistakes we did in Bangalore. You have to play with a straight bat against the spinners here,? he added.

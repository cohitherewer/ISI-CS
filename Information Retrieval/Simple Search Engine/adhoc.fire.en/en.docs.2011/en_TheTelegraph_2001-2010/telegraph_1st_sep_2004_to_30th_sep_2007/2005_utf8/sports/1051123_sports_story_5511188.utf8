 Wenger wants Henrys best years

 - It could be our year in Europe, says Gunners manager 

John Ley

 Wenger feels Henrys best years are round the corner 

Arsene Wenger is still looking for the formula to persuade Thierry Henry that his future lies in north London. The fact that Wenger believes Henry is approaching his prime underlines why he remains imperative to the clubs hopes of success. 

Arsenal had already qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League before facing FC Thun, so Wenger rested goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, defender Kolo Toure and midfielder Gilberto, while Dennis Bergkamps fear of flying meant the Dutchman also remained in London. 

The Arsenal manager believes the side continues winning and that the next few months are crucial for the future of the club ? and that includes persuading Henry to stay. 

He wrote himself into Arsenal history in the clubs last away game in the Champions League and created another record by making his 70th appearance in European competition for Arsenal, eclipsing David Seaman, who represented the club 69 times, and Patrick Vieira, who played 68 times in Europe. 

Henrys two goals in Prague a month ago took his tally for Arsenal to 186, beating Ian Wrights record. He has since added five more in his last three appearances. A hattrick would take Henrys European goals, for all his clubs, to 50. 

Henry has another season left on his contract but Wenger remains hopeful that negotiations can persuade the striker to commit his long-term future to Arsenal. He also believes that the best is yet to come from the Frenchman. 

I believe that the characteristic of a very good player is that they get better every year, said Wenger. 

Until now, every year he has got better and better, and that is the mark of a big player. I think his best years are coming, from 28 to 32. 

On the contract situation, Wenger added: We know what we want to do but you need two to sign a contract. I personally feel that he loves the club and that he wants to be successful. Were not at the stage where were considering anything different than keeping him. 

For me, the potential of the team is great, the spirit of the team is great and the next three or four months will tell us how far we can go. 

That potential could persuade Henry that his future remains at Arsenal. 

Wenger added: It could be our year in the Champions League but Im not foolish enough to say that, at the group stage, who will win it. 

I know one thing, that we can be better in December than November. Now its down to as to see how hard we work and how focused we are.

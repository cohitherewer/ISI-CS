The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Nadal, Alonso spark Spanish renaissance

 - Young tennis and Formula One stars push soccer out of limelight 

 Nadal drew capacity crowds at the Barcelona Open 

Madrid: In a soccer-obsessed country like Spain, it takes something special to push what they call ?el deporte rey? (the king of sports) off the front pages of the sporting dailies. 

Fernando Alonso and Rafael Nadal did just that. 

Alonso, 23, won a thrilling duel with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher in Sunday?s San Marino GP hours before 18-year-old Nadal produced a superlative display of high-energy tennis to win the Barcelona Open title. 

For once, sporting conversations are revolving around the exploits of these young men rather than the rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid. 

Like Ballesteros, Nadal has charisma, talent and good looks. The only matches that drew a capacity crowd at the centre court in Barcelona were those involving the Mallorcan. 

Every one of his matches was carried live on state television and his doubles matches pulled in more fans than most of those in the singles draw. 

Such was his popularity that the organisers of the tournament were obliged to put on extra security to protect him from the hordes of fans that tracked his every step. 

With his long brown hair, fluorescent orange sleeveless shirt and bandana, Nadal is already one of the hottest properties in the sport. 

Spain never carried Formula One races live on television until Alonso?s emergence. A peak audience of more than seven million ? a figure that comes close to rivalling that for a Real-Barcelona clash ? watched his victory at Imola on Sunday. The crowds at the final of the Barcelona Open stayed outside the centre court to watch the end of the race, even Nadal and Juan Carlos Ferrero were late because they were glued to the screen in the players? lounge. 

Children swap Formula One stickers at school and the remote-controlled version of the Alonso car is one of the biggest sellers in toy shops. 

A record 115,000 fans will pack the Circuit de Catalunya next weekend as Alonso attempts to win his home Grand Prix. (Reuters)

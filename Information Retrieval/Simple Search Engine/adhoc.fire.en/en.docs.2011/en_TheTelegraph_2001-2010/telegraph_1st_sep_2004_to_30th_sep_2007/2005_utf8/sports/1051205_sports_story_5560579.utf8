 Real win on Ronaldo goal

 - Beckham sent off again 

Madrid: Real Madrid held on to beat an attack-minded Getafe 1-0 despite having England captain David Beckham sent off again, 11 minutes into the second half of Saturdays Primera Liga match. 

Ronaldo returned from injury to put Real in front after just 18 minutes but it was their city rivals who dominated in the Bernabeu. 

Real were put under further pressure after the break when Beckhams rash challenge from behind on striker Riki earned him his fourth dismissal since joining the Spanish club in 2003. 

Getafe coach Bernd Schuster said: The difference between the sides was simply in the accuracy of the shooting. We were certainly not outplayed. 

Real moved up to fourth spot with 25 points, three behind leaders Barcelona who travel to Villarreal on Sunday when second-placed Osasuna visit mid-table Malaga. 

Earlier on Saturday, Celta Vigo climbed to third on 26 points by beating struggling visitors Real Betis 2-1. Uruguayan midfielder Fabian Canobbio put Celta ahead after five minutes, and Brazilian striker Fernando Baiano doubled the lead with a header in the 20th minute. 

Betis pulled a goal back in the last minute with a header from Brazilian forward Edu just before their defender Oscar Lopez was sent off. 

Llorenc Serra Ferrers side, who have not won away in the league this season, slipped to the foot of the table on goal difference after Athletic Bilbao equalised in the sixth minute of added time to draw 1-1 at home with Atletico Madrid. 

Schuster had promised an attacking performance in the Bernabeu and the visitors stayed true to their word. 

Riki headed just wide of the post after one minute and grazed the bar soon after with a shot from a narrow angle. 

Although the visitors controlled the game, Real took the lead with their only shot on target in the first half. 

Ronaldo played a one-two with Zinedine Zidane after 18 minutes and burst through the centre before firing in off the post with the outside of his foot. 

However, television replays showed the Brazilian had controlled the ball with his arm on his way through. 

Beckhams expulsion, for an unnecessary challenge on a player posing no danger, forced Real to defend even deeper in the second half but Getafe could not make the extra man count. 

In spite of the win, the Bernabeu crowd showed their frustration by whistling the Real players off the pitch at the end of the match. 

In Serie A, AC Milans pursuit of league leaders Juventus suffered a major setback when they lost 1-2 at Chievo Verona. 

Kakha Kaladze gave Milan the lead at Veronas Bentegodi stadium midway through the first half, but goals by strikers Sergio Pellissier and Simone Tiribocchi earned Chievo an unexpected victory. 

The result left Milan second in the table with 31 points from 14 matches, five points behind Juventus. Chievo climbed to fifth on 24.

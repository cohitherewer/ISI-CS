 Alfords 4 matched Rasalas verdict 

 STAR RACER

 After hot-favourite Sanskara scared away the opposition, last month, and thrashed a poor four-horse field in the Fillies Trial, the Colts version of the Classic, on Wednesday, was expected to be some kind of contest. However, once the news about Rasalas preference for the event became known, his potential rivals opted out at the acceptance stage. 

 The winter season form of the Daniel David-trainee has been smashing, and the two horses, who dared to challenge the authority of the Storm Trooper-Ruddles son, knew their fate well in advance. It, therefore, hardly came as a surprise when Rasalas went to the start as a literally money-back-favourite in the betting. The favourite, in fact, hardly needed his stablemate, Imperial Dynastys services for a pace-maker. 

 The Dynasty came slowly out of the gates, and even his brief brush with the lead, between the 1,000m and 600m, could not have been much of advantage for Rasalas who almost galloped right abreast of him. 

 The pace was just about tender and the favourite was pulling hard, therefore, jockey B.Prakash was at unease on the public-fancy. The jockey was forced to submit to Rasalas dictates and the horse was gone ? kicking away from the field, leaving Raging Tide ( C.Alford up), the third horse in contention, to finish a distance second.

 Alford did get outclassed in the Trial Stakes but he had his day made with a quadruple of wins in the seven-event card. All his winners almost matched the verdict recorded by Rasalas. 

 Alfords first winner, Knowledgeable won the way she liked to lift the Mandolin Cup. Unfortunately, the Fillies Trial had come a wee bit early for the Tecorno-Knowing daughter, else she would have given Sanskara some fight.

 Alarico was the next one to go kindly for Alford, and his new schooler Javed Khan. The horse had done poorly in his last start, therefore, the transformation in his form was amazing for punters. In the 1,200m Osiris Handicap, the Steinbeck-As Ever son, however, received a handsome support in the betting from those in the know, though Daniels Native Son was the clear favourite to win. But Alarico made short-work of his rivals, winning from the word go by six long lengths. 

 Alfords third winner Serrafina was always rated a better horse than Autocop who opened as a clear favourite but went to the start as a joint-fancy in the 1,100m Aternator Cup. This time Alford held back his ride behind Common Spirit till the top of the turn before shooting into the lead for a five-length-plus victory. 

 Alford wrapped it up with another storming win on the Harvinder Bath-trainee River Rafter in the concluding event, the 1,200m Gumaan Handicap. Initially, the Rafter matched the odds with Errol Bhungards Arabie at 6-4, but in the end the Warrshan-River Foyle was the clear market leader. The Rafter won the way he was backed.

 Earlier in the afternoon, Daniels Bold Raider had posted a convincing victory over the Alford-ridden Arakawa. Prakash varied pace upfront on the Diffident-Cadenza filly in the 1,400m Hovercraft Cup but finally loosened up reins on the 9-10 favourite who galloped away from the field in the last 300 metres.

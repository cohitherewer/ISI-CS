 Laureus help for Usha

New Delhi: The Usha School of Athletics has received a much needed boost with Laureus Sports Foundation agreeing to sponsor equipment for trainees coached by the legendary sprint runner. 

?I received the mail from Laureus officials two days ago. They have agreed to give us the necessary equipment, now I have to write to them what is needed for the school,? P.T. Usha told mediapersons here on Thursday. 

The ?golden girl?, who won four gold medals in the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and came close to winning India?s first athletics medal in Olympics in 1984, said help has been coming, although in a trickle. 

?It has been very difficult. People are helping but I think the funds would start coming after some success. Everyone wants to help after you win, but none is willing before that,? she said. 

The Usha School, situated in Koyilandi near Kozhikode has eight trainees ? all girls ? in a rented building. The school, which will be entering its third year, will be shifted shortly to Kilanoor, about 130 kms from Kozhikode. 

The new facility will have an accommodation of 50 beds, she said. 

Being away from city limits, the eight children travel to nearby institutions to pursue their academics at present. 

?The state government gave Rs 15 lakh in the first year and another 10 in the second... The Railway board has helped a lot, allowing me to concentrate on my project,? Usha said. (PTI)

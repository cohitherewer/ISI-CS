The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rumours touch top women players

 - Doping Allegation

 Cloud remains over Kuznetsova, Dementieva, Dechy 

 Russia?s Elena Dementieva during a training session in Melbourne on Sunday 

 Melbourne: Three players at the centre of doping 

 allegations in Belgium ? Russians Svetlana Kuznetsova and 

 Elena Dementieva and Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy ? Sunday 

 denied any knowledge of or involvement in the scandal. 

 Belgian sports minister Claude Eerdekens inadvertently 

 pointed the finger at the trio when he told Belgian news 

 agency Belga Saturday that a player had failed a doping 

 test at an exhibition tournament in Charleroi last month. 

Only four players took part in the event and Eerdekens said one of them, Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, had been cleared. 

?Our policy is not to reveal the name of the athlete before the end of the complete procedure, but I can say that Henin-Hardenne is not concerned at all in this,? Eerdekens said. 

He added that details of the positive test had been forwarded to the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the Belgian Tennis Federation and the player?s national body. He also said the player concerned had been notified but Kuznetsova, Dementieva and Dechy, preparing for Monday?s start in the Australian Open, all denied knowledge on Sunday. ?I haven?t heard anything. Nobody has contacted me,? world number five Kuznetsova said. 

Sixth-ranked Dementieva, who was runner-up to Kuznetsova at last year?s US Open and also a finalist at the 2004 French Open, made a similar comment. 

?I don?t know anything about it,? she said. ?They didn?t speak to me, so it wasn?t me.? 

Dechy said: ?We had an unexpected test (in Belgium). They told us that, if there was a problem, they would contact us two or three weeks later. ?I haven?t heard anything and nor have the French Federation. I think I am clean. I have no idea about the others.? 

Henin-Hardenne, who battled a mystery illness for most of last year, has pulled out of her title defence at the Australian Open because of a knee injury. 

However, her husband and manager Pierre-Yves told Belgian website Le Sport en Ligne he had heard about last month?s doping test. 

 ?It?s a load of nonsense really,? he was quoted as 

 saying. ?But I?d prefer not to say anything more because 

 it?s a very delicate subject.? The ITF and the Women?s Tennis 

 Association (WTA) said they were unaware of the doping allegations, 

 as did the Russian and French tennis federations. (Reuters)

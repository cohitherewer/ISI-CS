 Haas keeps Germany in hunt

Duesseldorf: Tommy Haas kept Germany in the hunt for a place in the World Team Cup final with a 6-0, 3-6, 6-3 victory over Swedish No. 1 Joachim Johansson on Wednesday. 

Johanssons defeat meant his namesake Thomas has to win the second singles against Nicolas Kiefer if the Swedes are to have any chance of reaching the final from the Blue Group. 

Joachim missed Mondays 1-2 defeat by Spain with a hamstring strain and he was caught flat-footed on Wednesday as Haas stormed through the first set without dropping a game. 

Although Joachim eventually dug his heels into the Rochusclubs centre court to make a comeback in the second, Haas made the most of the crowd support to clinch victory. 

Germany defeated a second-string United States team on the opening day of the eight-nation tournament.

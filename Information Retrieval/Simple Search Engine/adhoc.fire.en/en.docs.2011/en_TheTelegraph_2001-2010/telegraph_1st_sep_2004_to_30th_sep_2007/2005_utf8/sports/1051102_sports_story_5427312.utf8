 Paes, Zimonjic make cut

New Delhi: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic have qualified for the Masters Cup doubles in later this month. 

The season-ending ATP meet will be held in Shanghai from November 13 to 20 and will feature both singles and doubles. 

The Indo-Serbian pair, in their first full season as a team, made it to the prestigious event as the fifth-ranked team. 

The top eight teams in the ATP Doubles Race qualify for the event with the provision for special entry to any pair which has won one or more Grand Slam title in the year but havent made the cut in terms of ranking. 

Paes and Zimonjic won two claycourt titles (Monte Carlo and Barcelona) in the first half of the season. Last month, they made back-to-back finals on the hardcourts of Stockholm and Madrid but lost both times. 

American brothers Bob and Mike Bryan, the Swede-Belarussian duo of Jonas Bjorkman-Max Mirnyi, Zimbabweans Wayne Black-Kevin Ullyett and Bahamanian-Canadian combine of Mark Knowles-Daniel Nestor have also made the cut. 

Mahesh Bhupathi will be missing out as he and Czech Martin Damm are way off the qualifying mark. Bhupathi turned to Damm only after Wimbledon as Todd Woodbridge suddenly retired. (PTI)

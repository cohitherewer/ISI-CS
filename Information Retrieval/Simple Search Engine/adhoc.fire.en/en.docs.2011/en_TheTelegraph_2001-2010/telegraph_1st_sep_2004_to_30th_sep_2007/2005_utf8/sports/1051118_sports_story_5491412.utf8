Paris: The cast list for the 2006 World Cup was finally completed when the remaining five of the 32 available places were snapped up by Australia, Spain, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago and the Czech Republic. 

This quintet sealed their seats on Wednesday for next years feast of football in Germany via the play-offs in markedly different ways. 

While Spain cruised to their ninth straight World Cup finals with a 6-2 aggregate win over Slovakia, it couldnt have been tighter in Sydney where Australia defeated two-time winners Uruguay on penalties. 

In Manama, Trinidad and Tobago staged a remarkable comeback to ensure theyd be rubbing shoulders with the sports superpowers next year in what will be their World Cup debut. Like the Trinidadians the Czech Republic were celebrating their first World Cup appearance with a 1-0 win over Norway after defeating the Scandinavians by the same margin in the first-leg. 

Dortmund midfielder Tomas Rosickys 35th minute strike sealed the fate of Norway who went close when only a fine save by Chelsea keeper Petr Cech denied John Carews second-half header. The Czechs, though, had a Vladamir Smicer goal dubiously ruled offside in the 59th minute and a Karel Poborsky tap-in from close range in the 79th less controversially disallowed. 

In Istanbul, Turkey lost out despite beating Switzerland 4-2. Having won the first leg 2-0 for a 4-4 aggregate the Swiss went through on away goals. Hakan Sukur gave Turkey a 2-1 lead at the break and the hosts were 3-1 up in the 52nd minute when Christoph Spycher cut Anderlecht attacker Serhat Akin down in the penalty box with Ates converting. 

Marco Streller then reduced the deficit but despite Tuncay heading in Sukurs 89th-minute pass four minutes of injury time were not enough for a liberating fifth goal. 

Meanwhile, Fifa president Sepp Blatter has condemned violent incidents at the end of Turkeys World Cup playoff against Switzerland as trampling fair play underfoot and announced an investigation by world soccers ruling body. 

I can tell you this, not as a Swiss, but as the president of Fifa that we will act here and we will act tough, Blatter told a news conference on Thursday. 

This was anti-fair play. The Turks had the chance after the (first leg) defeat to act as a good host and show that a revenge foul is not done in football. The Swiss players left the pitch under a hail of objects thrown by the Turkish crowd. Players from both sides clashed as they ran off the field. 

And finally to Bratislava where Slovakia failed to climb the mountain theyd left themselves after a 1-5 first-leg hammering by Spain in Madrid.

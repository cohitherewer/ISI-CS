 Woolmer wants good Test tracks

Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer wants good Test pitches for the series against England. 

Woolmer, who played 19 Tests for England, said he did not believe slow and turning tracks could be prepared for the home series. 

I dont think conditions in Pakistan favour preparation of such pitches now. We are looking to have good Test pitches that last for five days and offer encouragement to batsmen and bowlers, he said on Wednesday. 

England arrive on Wednesday to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals and there has been a lot of speculation on the type of pitches that would be prepared. 

The selectors have given some indication by picking four leg-spinners for a preparatory camp including veteran Mushtaq Ahmed, who has not played for Pakistan since 2003. 

Woolmer said his players were under no illusions that the series against England would be easy. 

They are playing well at the moment, and we have not got it right in Test matches. So we will have to combine well together to produce good performances, he said. 

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif also advised his former teammates not to rely too much on the spinners. 

It is a misconception that we can beat England with our spinners. We should not be looking to prepare slow turning tracks because our spinners dont flight the ball regularly and tend to push the ball through, Latif said. 

He also outlined that rough areas on pitches which spinners tended to exploit were usually soft in Pakistan compared with England where they were hard. 

And the problem is our bowlers dont have the practice to bowl regularly into the rough area like Ashley Giles does, he said.

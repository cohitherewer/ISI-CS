 Tim, Justin set for showdown

Mexico: Olympic 100 m champion Justin Gatlin is set for a cracking head-to-head with world record-holder Tim Montgomery here at the athletics Grand Prix Saturday. 

While Montgomerys career has been under a cloud since allegations were made about him taking performance-enhancing drugs ? which he denies ? Gatlin reached the summit last year in Athens with a dominant performance in the 100m. 

A strong field will also include 2003 world outdoor silver medallist Darrel Brown from Trinidad and Tobago and the 2000 Olympic bronze medallist Obadele Thompson from Barbados. 

Marion Jones takes to the track against pint-sized Olympic 100m silver medallist Lauryn Williams and Jones former training partner the experienced Bahamian Chandra Sturrup, who beat her twice in-a-row in Europe recently. 

The home crowd, though, will be most enthusiastic about the rematch between their darling the 2003 world champion over 400m Ana Guevara and the astonishing Bahamian Tonya Williams-Darling, whose dramatic improvement last season saw it climax with gold in Athens while Guevara had to make do with silver.

 Bengal content with draw, two points 

 - RANJI TROPHY 

 Laxmi Ratan Shukla scored a fine 78 

Mysore: Bengal decided to be content with two points by virtue of their first innings lead over Karnataka in their Ranji Trophy elite group A encounter which ended in a draw on Tuesday. 

Bengal now have nine points from four matches, while Karnataka have three. 

The hosts were dismissed for 292 in the first innings in reply to Bengals 335. 

Resuming at their overnight score of 75 without loss, Bengal looked in no mood to declare and batted out the whole day to reach 286 for seven. 

The highlight of Bengals second innings was a fine batting display by Manoj Tewari (80) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (78) who put on 129 runs for the sixth wicket. 

Earlier, openers Subhomoy Das (43) and Arindam Das (36) shared an 80-run stand to give their side a good start. 

Karnataka batsmen performed miserably, except for B. Chipli who scored a fine knock of 115 in their first innings. For Karnataka, Vinay Kumar (three for 42) and Sunil Joshi (three for 67) shared the spoils. 

Earlier on Monday, Sunil Joshi with his 44 managed to stretch Karnatakas innings by defying Bengal bowlers for some time before he fell victim to Lahiri. (PTI)

 No second neutral for one-dayers

Islamabad: Pakistan Cricket Board has dropped the idea of having two neutral umpires for the five-match one-day International series against India, who have given a cold response to the proposal. 

With no response at all from them (Indians), we had no option but to ask the International Cricket Council to appoint one umpire for the one-dayers from its Elite panel while we will nominate the other umpire from Pakistan, a senior PCB official said. 

The official said the Indians did not return any correspondence in this regard which indicated that they were not interested in it. 

Apparently, the Indians didnt take it seriously because they never bothered to get back to us on this issue at all. Feeling they were not interested we also dropped the idea because you cant have neutral umpires in ODIs without the consent of the touring team, he was quoted as saying in a daily. 

The PCB had neutral umpires for the one-dayers against England as the ECB saw no problems with it. 

The official also said that despite Indias unresponsive attitude, the PCB would still pursue the matter at ICC meetings next year as it felt the concept had a bright future.

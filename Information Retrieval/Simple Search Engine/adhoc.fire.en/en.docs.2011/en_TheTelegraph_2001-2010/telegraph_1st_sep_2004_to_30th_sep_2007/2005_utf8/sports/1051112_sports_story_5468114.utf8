 Shoulder injury not a factor in Sanath exclusion

 - Chaminda Vaas promotion an experiment, says SLC source 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Ahmedabad/Vadodara: The official announcement by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) notwithstanding, the countrys most capped Test player ? Sanath Jayasuriya ? has been dropped for next months three-Test series in India. 

Sanath does have a shoulder problem, but his failure in the ongoing ODIs is what led to his exclusion, a well-placed SLC source in Colombo told The Telegraph on Friday evening. 

The former captain, who was expected to lead Lankas assault, has managed a highest of 27 (first match, Nagpur) only. His scores after that have been: 0, 15, 16, 8 and 19. 

To make a comeback, Sanath has to perform in domestic cricket... If he does, the selectors could look at him when the squad for the four ODIs in New Zealand and the tri-series in Australia is picked, the source added. 

Jayasuriya himself didnt say much by way of reaction when one contacted him at the Taj Residency in Vadodara: No, no Im not (disappointed)... Thank you for calling me... Thank you very much... 

The selectors, one understands, removed Mahela Jayewardene as vice-captain as they want him to focus entirely on batting. He missed the Pune match on account of his wedding and in the other five ODIs, managed just one fifty. 

Of course, Jayewardene can get back the No. 2 spot... Right now, Chaminda Vaas promotion is nothing more than an experiment, the source pointed out. 

The selectors must be clear about their agenda, but the Vaas development is baffling. Indeed, a certain Kumar Sangakkara may feel a bit dejected.

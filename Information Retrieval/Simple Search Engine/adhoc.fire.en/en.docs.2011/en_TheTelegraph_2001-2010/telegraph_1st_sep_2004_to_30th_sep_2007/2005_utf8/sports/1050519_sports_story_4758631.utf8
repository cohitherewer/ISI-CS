The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Zaheer Khan our best bowler, says Prasad

 - U-19 coach wants computer analyst for his boys 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Team India mediumpacer Venkatesh Prasad feels a stint with the English County championship will do Irfan Pathan a world of good. 

If Pathan decides to play in England, it will help him hone his skills immensely. Particularly if there is a long break from international cricket, he should consider such option, Prasad told The Telegraph on Wednesday. In the city as a bowling consultant, Prasad visited the ZCA (East) camp underway at the JU campus ground, Salt Lake. 

Asked whether the teenaged pacer could also risk injuries by playing in England, Prasad said Pathan himself is the best judge of whether he wants to have good practice before Indias next assignment, avoiding any sort of injury. 

In modern cricket, a bowler has to do a lot of things. But he has make sure that he shouldnt over-bowl, the former Karnataka bowler said. 

According to him, Pathan is one of the most promising players in the world, but Prasad picks Zaheer Khan as the best in India currently. 

He (Zaheer) has a very good variety in his bowling and so if you ask me to pick one bowler, it will be Zaheer, Prasad admitted. Zaheer has a good run up and fine release, he pointed out. 

In Prasads viewpoint, he has no problem guiding the pack of Indian fast bowlers, if the offer of a bowling consultants job comes his way. 

I will be delighted to assist the company of Zaheer, Pathan, (Lakshmipathy) Balaji and others if I am asked to do so. But its up to the Board to decide whether they want a bowling coach. 

But he maintained that if Team India have a batsman as the chief coach, they must have a bowling consultant too. 

Reverting to the topic of India under-19 squad, which is under his tutelage at present, Prasad is hopeful about the boys show in the upcoming World Cup in 2006. 

Now the boys are training at the zonal academies. We will start our preparation (for the World Cup) from July, he stated. 

Prasad confirmed that Board has already come up with a suggestion of sending the under-19 squad to Australia before the World Cup, but the final decision is yet to be taken as the venue of the tournament is yet to be decided. 

It may be held in either Colombo or Quala Lumpur. 

That the boys will be selected on the basis of their performances during the last England series as well as in the forthcoming inter-academy matches. We will choose a batch 25-30 initially and later the final squad will be pruned to 20, he added. 

Prasad, who had spearheaded Indias attack with statemate Jawagal Srinath, had already appealed (in writing) to the Board to provide the under-19 squad wards with a computer analyst. 

Computer analyst is a must nowadays. We should have one so that mistakes can be detected and rectified, helping the boys make suitable for the top flight, he maintained.

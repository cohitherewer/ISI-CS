 PCB appeals Shabbir ban

Lahore: Pakistan has lodged an appeal against the International Cricket Councils (ICC) one-year ban on paceman Shabbir Ahmed, an official said on Friday. 

We have filed an appeal with the ICC against the ban, Pakistan Cricket Board director of operations Salim Altaf said. 

Ahmed became the first bowler on Monday banned from bowling in international cricket after an assessment by the University of Western Australia confirmed he had been bowling with an illegal action. 

The ICC announced the decision on Monday and Shabbir has 14 days to appeal.

 Luis Figo issues threat to Real

Tokyo: Luis Figo told Real Madrid on Wednesday: Play me or Ill leave. 

The Portuguese winger came on as a second-half substitute in Reals 3-1 pre-season win over Japans Jubilo Iwata and said later he felt unsettled about his future. 

My situation is strange, Figo said. Of course, I just want to play football ? hopefully with Real Madrid. But if I dont have chances here, I have to move. 

European champions Liverpool and Inter Milan have been linked with the former world footballer of the year in the close season. 

Things with Liverpool have stopped... but for me Im happy that big clubs are interested in me. I just want to play football though, Figo said. 

Inter Milan owner Massimo Moratti has said his club were in talks with Figo who has been at Real since his controversial move from Barcelona five years ago. 

Figo said he had heard nothing about a possible move during Reals pre-season tour of the US and Asia. 

Im here concentrating on Real Madrid and dont have any news about signing (for Inter), the 32-year-old said. I just want to try to make the most of the minutes I get. 

Figo fell out with coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo after being consigned to the bench for the latter part of last season. 

He played an important role in their 2002 European Champions League triumph and 2003 Spanish league title campaign. 

Meanwhile, Brazil striker Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid defeated Jubilo Iwata 3-1 on Wednesday in the second of two pre-season games in Japan. 

Captain Raul had fired the Spanish club ahead in the third minute after Michael Owens initial effort was deflected into his path. 

Ronaldo came close moments later before England striker Owen had a seemingly good goal disallowed after a late offside flag in the ninth minute. 

Shu Naruoka equalised for Jubilo in the 24th minute with a low shot from 25m but Ronaldo picked himself up after being fouled to restore Reals lead from the penalty spot in the 28th minute. 

Raul squandered a gilt-edged chance 10 minutes into the second half following slick build-up play from Guti and Roberto Carlos. 

Ronaldo added Reals third in injury time, latching on to substitute Figos defence-splitting ball to slot the ball through the legs of Jubilo goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi. 

England captain David Beckham completed 68 minutes in his second game after pulling a hamstring in the US last week and received a standing ovation from the crowd of 34,000.

 Simon Jones to arrive early

London: England speedster Simon Jones will arrive in India before the team to regain his fitness for the Test and one-day series in March. 

Jones, recovering from an ankle surgery, told a television channel that he would head to India with fast bowling coach Troy Cooley and also meet Dennis Lillee. 

I will go to the fast bowling camp in Chennai and see how it goes. Touch wood, everything will be fine, he was quoted as saying. 

The fast bowler, who missed the Pakistan tour owing to his injury, said that he enjoyed bowling in India during the tour of England A team and was looking forward to bowl against players like Sachin Tendulkar. 

We played against some good players but not as good as Tendulkar, but I did enjoy bowling and I bowled reverse swing and it suited me, he said.

 Mad rush to join Murray bandwagon

Neil Harman

 Andy Murray 

Andy Murray ? coming to a tournament near you soon. But where? As the process of the new darling of British sport becoming a 2006 poster boy for the mens game takes on an astonishing momentum, the picking and choosing of where to release the young Scot on an increasingly expectant tennis world is ever more crucial. 

The phones at Octagon, his management companys offices in San Francisco, have been buzzing in shrill accord with Murrays progress through the Indesit ATP world rankings, for here is a talent that tournament directors are keen to have as an embellishment to their fields for the rest of this year and the start of the new one. 

Dealing astutely with such an exciting new property, getting the structure of his short-term career in proper balance to make sure long-term goals are achieved, is the essence of the strategy. 

What is certain is that Murray, 18, is one of the faces of the future and will find himself marketed as such, but never, Octagon has said, in a manner that interferes with his identity and gets in the way of his tennis. To Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez of Spain, Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils of France and Robby Ginepri of the US, one can add Murray as a legitimate pretender ? although in the case of Nadal, the French Open champion, there is no need for pretence. 

These are the young bloods who offer the mightiest threat to Roger Federers hegemony. Murray is farthest down the ladder ? his success in reaching his first ATP final in the Thailand Open accorded him a new high point of No. 72 in the world ? but he is finishing this year in the manner of a cheetah. His paw prints are everywhere you look. 

Tournament directors for the Australian Open build-up events ? in Adelaide and Sydney ? may be unable to resist a Scot who would bring expatriates out to swell the figures. 

Even after that, as the circuit swings to the US, the message is we want Murray. The directors of a new event in Las Vegas, which replaces Scottsdale on the calendar, and of Memphis have checked his availability in March. 

Tom Ross, senior vice-president of Octagon, has been instrumental in guiding Murray through these formative stages of his career. In fact, as Ross said, Murray has lost only once in the first round of the tournaments he has played this year ? in Barcelona, his first on the Tour proper ? one of the most remarkable starts to a professional career he can recall.

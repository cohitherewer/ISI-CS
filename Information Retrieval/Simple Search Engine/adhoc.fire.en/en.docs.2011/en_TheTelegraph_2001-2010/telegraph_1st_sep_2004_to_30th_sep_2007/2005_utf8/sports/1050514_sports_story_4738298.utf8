 Balaji wants to be more consistent

 - I always look forward to take challenges head on 

 Balaji is determined to stop the run flow in first 15 overs 

Chennai: Having been clobbered all over the park in his opening spells during the recent one-day series against Pakistan, Lakshmipathy Balaji is now determined to plug the loopholes and concede less runs in the first 15 overs which is the key to a positive result of the match. 

The Tamil Nadu seamer is utilising the welcome three-month break from international cricket to hone his skills in the shorter version of the game and make himself an allround bowler. 

I want to show consistency and take more wickets. We struggled in one-day games against Pakistan. I want to master my skills in the first 15 overs of a match and stop conceding runs, the 23-year-old Balaji said in an interview. 

The impressive performance of the right-arm seamer in the Tests against Pakistan, on return from a injury lay-off, was followed by some rough sailing in the one-day series when he was at the receiving end of Shahid Afridi. 

The first 15 overs are the key to a positive result in a match. So I am prepared to take this challenge and I want to implement all my plans in the coming series, he said. 

His predicament is interesting because Balaji came on the scene, in 2002, with the image of an one-day specialist. Then Australia 2004 happened, and since the tour of Pakistan, his broad smile has become a permanent feature of the Indian team. 

In contrast, in the last three one-day meets excluding the the tri-series in Holland ? the Asia Cup, the NatWest Challenge in England, and the series against Pakistan ? he has averaged above 57.00 with eight wickets in 10 matches. 

In between, in his zeal to improve, the youngster tried too many things and lost his action. And the worst nightmares came in September last year when he returned home from England before the prestigious Champions Trophy with an abdominal injury. 

Balajis fightback from the career threatening injury is a story in itself. And he is thankful to MRF Pace Foundation for the support and guidance. 

Its the only such international foundation in the country and (Dennis) Lillee advised me as to how I should attack the crease, jump out and to bowl to line and length, Balaji said. 

A combination of abdominal muscle tear, inflammation in the adductor region and oestistubis, a major inflammation on the cartilage of the pelvic bone, made the recovery process a complicated and sensitive one. 

After the intitial screening, Balaji started off with basic weight training, movement analysis and developing core strength and stability, gate training principles and functional drills. 

Targets were set on a month by month basis. His running technique was changed, including the initial strides and back-foot and left-foot landing. All devised to suit his specific bowling methods. The first six months was spent on just getting back to bowling. 

The wiry bowler is now looking forward to the start of the new season, and will finetune himself by playing in the first division league of the TNCA league. 

Preparing for the league is the immediate task, though I am working simultaneously for forthcoming international events, he said. 

I plan my workouts and skill improvements. I have been keeping in touch with Gregory King (Indian trainer) and all my seniors in the team during the off season. 

In keeping with the modern trend, he has added yoga and meditation to his daily schedule. I always look forward to take challenges head-on, said Balaji. I have gained in confidence and become accurate among other things.

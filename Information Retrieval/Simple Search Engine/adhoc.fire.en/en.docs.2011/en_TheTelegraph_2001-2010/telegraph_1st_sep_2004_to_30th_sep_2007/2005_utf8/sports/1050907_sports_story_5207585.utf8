The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Coaches barred entry 

to SAI

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: P. C. Kashyap, regional director, SAI Eastern Centre, on Tuesday banned the entry of the four coaches, who have refused to oblige by the transfer order, into the complex. 

They have to proceed to their places of transfer and take charge immediately. They cannot enter the SAI Salt Lake premises and, if needed, can only speak to me over the telephone, Kashyap said. 

The four coaches ? Ananta Ghosh and D. P. Bhowmick (football), Jibesh Majumder (volleyball) and Nemai Bose (athletics) ? had barged into Kashyaps office on Monday demanding they be paid their outstanding salaries. Police had to be finally called to clear the premises. 

The coaches may move court against the transfer order and have also rubbished claims of the regional director that they were chargesheeted. Weve only got a letter asking us to proceed to our centre of transfer immediately, said one of the coaches.

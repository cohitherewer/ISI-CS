 Federer in semis

Rotterdam: World No. 1 Roger Federer warmed up for an explosive semi-final showdown with Mario Ancic with a battling 7-5, 7-5 win over Russia?s Nikolay Davydenko at the World Indoor tournament on Friday. 

Ancic completed a successful day for Croatia by beating third seed Tim Henman 7-6, 7-6, while Ivan Ljubicic reached his second semi-final in as many weeks following a 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Paradorn Srichaphan. 

Ljubicic will meet former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson, who defeated Czech Radek Stepanek 6-2, 7-6. 

Federer toyed with Davydenko in a 100-minute contest before ending the sixth seed?s run at the Dutch port city. 

?It was fun on one side but it was a very tough battle and I?m happy to be through to the semis,? said Federer. 

The Swiss gave Davydenko a glimmer of hope in the opening game when the Russian earned a break point, though that was as good as it got for Davydenko, who kept being drawn into long rallies until Federer unleashed one of his spectacular winners. 

The top seed wasted a set point in the 10th game on Davydenko?s serve before finishing the job two games later. 

Davydenko had his chances to take the match into a third set, earning two break points in 11th game of the second but Federer safely negotiated that danger. (Reuters)

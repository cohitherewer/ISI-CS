 French Open to offer equal prize money

Paris: The 2006 French Open mens and womens singles winners will receive equal prize money, the French tennis federation has announced. 

The claycourt Grand Slam event now joins the Australian Open and US Open in awarding equal prize money. 

Wimbledon and French Open had maintained the prize funds for women at a slightly lower rate than the mens in the past with 2005 Roland Garros mens champion Rafael Nadal winning 880,000 euros compared to 867,000 euros taken home by womens champion Justin Henin-Hardenne. 

Roger Federer won 933,500 euros for his Wimbledon win while Venus Williams was handed 890,000 euros for the womens title at the All England Club. The decision will not please some who have criticised the standard of the last two womens finals at Roland Garros . (AGENCIES)

 Arjun Singh finishes 14th

Beijing: Arjun Singh faltered when a top-10 finish looked his for the taking. The Indian was eight-under and tied ninth when he missed a two-footer for par to end 14th in the $ 300,000 Volkswagen Masters China tournament at the Jinghua Golf and Country Club. 

Arjun (72) was the best among the Indians, as most others ? except for Mukesh Kumar (68) and Digvijay Singh (72) ? went over par for the day, the highlight of which was the eight-under 64 by eventual winner Retief Goosen of South Africa. 

Defending champion Rahil Gangjee closed with 73 for an even score for four days and was tied 38th. 

Shiv Kapur, Gaurav Ghei and Digvijay all ended in tied 24th place after showing promise of being inside top-20. 

Ghei was two-under at the turn but three successive bogeys from 13th ended his hopes. (PTI)

Calcutta: After the psychologist Paromita Mitra Bhowmick and Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, it was P.K. Banerjee?s turn now to try and help Mohun Bagan take out of the woods. 

On the eve of their Sunday?s match against Tollygunge Agragami in the ongoing ninth National Football League for the ONGC Cup, PK turned up at the Mohun Bagan tent and imparted his famous ?vocal tonic? to the players. 

PK spent with the beleaguered players for about 25 minutes and discussed the dos and don?ts with them under such circumstances. 

Despite all this, the prospect of the green-and-maroon brigade collecting three points against Tollygunge looks difficult as they miss the service of striker Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?, apart from Noel Wilson and Ajibade Babalade. 

Beto is suffering from a finger injury. Without the Brazilian striker, coach Subrata Bhattacharya will have very little options to tinker with. His problems could further be compounded by the fact that all three foreigners in the opponents? camp are available in the match. 

It, thus, remains to be seen how the Ashim Biswas? and Eduardo Coelhos will live up to the challenge, posed by Tollygunge?s Suley Musah, Isiaka Awoyemi and Akeem Abolanle. 

Perhaps sensing troubles in the rival camp, Tollygunge coach Biswajit Das is getting a bit emboldened to return to winning ways. 

?We will play for a win,? he said after the practice session at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Saturday. 

Though, Isiaka didn?t attend the practice due to fever, it is almost clear that the Nigerian will figure in the first XI. 

On the other hand, Mohun Bagan may seek the service of veteran Jo Paul Ancheri (though, not for the whole 90 minutes). Ashim is sure to partner either Sunil Chettri or Jerry Zirsangha up front. 

?We may field Ancheri as a replacement later in the match as he is in my scheme of things,? said Shyamal Banerjee, Mohun Bagan assistant coach. 

Mohun Bagan will go into the match with 12 points and Tollygunge one point behind them after 10 matches.

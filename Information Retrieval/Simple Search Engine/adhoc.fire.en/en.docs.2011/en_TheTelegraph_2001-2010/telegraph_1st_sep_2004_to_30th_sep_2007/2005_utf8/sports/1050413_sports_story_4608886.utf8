Ahmedabad: The lingering smile on his lips and the sense of satisfaction refused to vanish from his appearance. Inzamam-ul Haq, though, did not wish to take much credit for the series-levelling victory and instead put it down to team effort. 

?My contribution was very small? The real help came from the top order ? from the Afridis, the Razzaqs, and the Maliks. It was a total team effort,? the Pakistan captain said after the three-wicket victory. 

But what exactly did go through his mind as he faced the last ball from Sachin Tendulkar with the fielders inside the circle and the scores tied? ?There wasn?t much to think about? I was just praying to God to help me... Also looking for the gaps.? 

Inzamam said that there wasn?t much planning in the dressing room. ?It was a difficult target but our only chance lay with having wickets in hand during the end overs. The top-order did that and kept the required run-rate down which made it easier for us later on,? he explained. 

Inzamam observed that he was slightly shaken by the three quick wickets in the closing stages. ?After Shoaib Malik?s dismissal and the two run-outs, I thought our chances slipped a little. But the required run-rate, thanks to our top-order, was always manageable. That ultimately did the trick.? 

Inzamam was all praise for Malik?s superb 65 but the allrounder appeared nonchalant. ?Good that the hard work has paid off. But we have a tough task ahead and can?t rest on this victory. 

?God willing we can pull off victories in the last two games as well... I was just concentrating on rotating the strike today... Inzybhai?s presence made the biggest difference,? Malik told The Telegraph. 

Inzamam also agreed with Malik that the tougher battles were ahead. ?Every game is a new game. We have to continue in the same vein and plan well for the next few matches.? 

Rahul Dravid felt that the visitors controlled the middle-overs really well and that made a huge difference. ?The gameplan was to try and defend 315, that was the basic idea. But I should give full credit to Pakistan, they chased brilliantly during the middle overs. The Malik-Razzaq and Malik-Inzamam partnerships were crucial, they ran lot of singles. We didn?t bowl well during the middle overs and the fielding wasn?t that great either,? the stand-in captain for the next two matches said. 

?We never gave up trying. 315 was a big total to defend and although the game slipped during the middle overs, we did well to fight back. But it was a bit too late. 

?We have to improve our allround game. We have to play well over 100 overs. We played well only in patches,? Dravid explained. 

Dravid also listed the reasons for getting Sachin to bowl the last over. ?Simply experience... We thought he was a tough guy to face, especially out of the rough. We had to take a gamble.? 

But was it a team decision? ?Every decision is the captain?s. He is the final authority and he can take advice from anyone including me. He has to take the praise and the criticism.? 

Had Inzamam failed in his attempt to pull off the win, Sachin and Sourav would, no doubt, have returned a hero.

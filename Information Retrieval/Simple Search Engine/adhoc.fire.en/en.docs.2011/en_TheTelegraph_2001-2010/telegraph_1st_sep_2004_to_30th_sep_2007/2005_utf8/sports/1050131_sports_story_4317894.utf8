 Sourav sets up semi-final date with Raman

 Sourav Chakraborty is in fine form 

Panvel (Maharashtra): Sourav Chakraborty of Railways Sports Promotion Board (RSPB) moved into the men?s singles semi-final in the 66th senior national table tennis championship here on Sunday. 

The number five seed cruised past Shivaji Dutta and fourth seed Subhajit Saha ? both from Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) ? with identical 4-0 margin in the pre-quarters finals and quarters, respectively. 

He will now face eighth seed and three-time champion S. Raman, who upset holder Achanta Sharath Kamal of PSPB 4-2. 

The 35-year-old Raman, who has won the title in 1994, 2000 and 2002 and losing finalist on five other occasions, subdued his 22-year-old rival 4-11, 11-9, 11-5, 11-7, 6-11, 11-3 in a quarter final battle between two Chennai-based players. 

In the other semi-final, second seed Soumyadeep Roy of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) ? a 4-1 quarter final winner over unseeded R. Rajesh (Tamil Nadu) ? will meet third seed Arup Basak (PSPB), who recovered well from 1-2 down to put it across Maharashtra?s Aniket Koparkar 4-2 in their quarter final clash. 

In the women?s quarter finals, last year?s losing finalist and women?s fourth seed N.R. Indu was given a scare by fifth seed Mamta Prabhu before prevailing 4-3. 

Indu would now try and avenge her defeat in last year?s title-clash against reigning champion and top seed Poulami Ghatak (PSPB) in Monday?s semi-final. 

The latter romped past eighth-seeded PSPB teammate T. Pradeepa 4-0. 

The other semi-final will pit second seed Mouma Das (PSPB) against third-seeded teammate Nandita Saha. The former ousted seventh seed Anindita Chakraborty (RSPB) 4-1. 

Mouma had earlier survived a very close pre-quarter final tussle against Delhi?s Neha Agarwal before clinching the last two games to emerge triumphant 4-1. 

Nandita put paid to the aspirations of former champion and PSPB rival Mantu Ghosh 4-2 in another quarter final.

 Sania loses in doubles, too

Bali: Sania Mirzas campaign in the $225,000 WTA International Tour event came to an end with her first round loss in the doubles Wednesday. 

Sania and Polands Marta Domachowska went down to Olympic gold medallists Tiantian Sun and Ting Li 4-6, 6-3, 4-6. The 18-year-old Indian had earlier lost in the singles first round 3-6, 2-6 to Ekaterina Bychkova. 

World No. 2 and top seed Lindsay Davenport lacked focus at times but came through 6-3, 6-2 against Japans Rika Fujiwara to reach the third round. 

The American took advantage of early breaks in each set to overcome an inexperienced but plucky opponent who rallied well and struck some fine volleys. 

Davenport broke to lead 2-0 in the first set, but then had to fight off three break points at 3-1 and then another as she served for the set. Davenport then broke for 1-0 in the second set and comfortably maintained her lead. 

Im never one that necessarily plays their best right off the bat, said Davenport. It took a little while to settle into the conditions and how Rika plays, but I do feel I started to improve some things in the second set. 

Davenport is hoping to quickly put her disappointing quarter final defeat at the US Open behind her. 

Any time that a Grand Slam is over and you feel like you have a chance to win, theres obviously a let-down when it doesnt happen that way, she said. 

But coming here, its been a really great opportunity to relax and get back out on the court right away. 

Fourth seed Francesca Schiavone overcame Spains Laura Pous Tio 6-3, 6-4 the feisty Italian untroubled by her hard-hitting but erratic opponent. Australian Alicia Molik claimed her first victory since April with a 7-6, 6-3 win over Argentinas Mariana Diaz-Oliva to reach the second round on Tuesday. 

Russian Ekaterina Bychkova, who knocked defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova out of the first round of the US Open last month, beat Indias eighth seed Sania Mirza 6-3, 6-2.

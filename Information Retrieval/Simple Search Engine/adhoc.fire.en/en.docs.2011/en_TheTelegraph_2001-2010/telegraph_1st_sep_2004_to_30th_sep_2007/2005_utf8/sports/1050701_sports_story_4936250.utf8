Typical. No sooner had the Centre Court discovered a new romantic hero than he was off in a swirl of towelling to the sighs of women clutching their hearts and, preferably, a pair of binoculars. Hello, and goodbye, Feliciano Lopez of Spain. 

The 23-year-old conqueror of fifth-seed Marat Safin was vanquished in straight sets by the former champion, Lleyton Hewitt, but at least for the two hours of the action the Spaniard was able to showcase a Hollywood repertoire of looks and poses. The overhead reverse backhand smash had to be favourite, even the number of times it swooshed into the net, for pure athletic spectacle. 

But Hewitt is no art lover. He knows what he likes and it is only winning. This the Australian duly did: 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), heedless of the pain it might cause in feminine circles, to set up a semi-final clash with the reigning champion, Roger Federer. 

It was a shame this quarter final was not more evenly poised. The players were perfectly contrasted, the fidgety Aussie doing his Billy Whizz impersonation versus the languid Latin with blue-grey eyes and a matinee idols jawline. Lopezs biggest mistake was admitting the country of his birth. Statisticians before the match computed that Hewitt beats Spaniards for fun. He had won his last 11 matches against opponents from Iberia and Lopez was to round up the dozen. 

And yet the player ranked 33 in the world who lists one of his interests as nightclubs (unsurprisingly) was not your typical Spaniard. Like a German surrendering a sunbed, he goes against the stereotype with his love of attacking the net. This preference had brought him great success in previous rounds, including the scalp of Mario Ancic, but Hewitt proved a more obstinate case. 

The Australian played well. His serve in particular, with 15 clean aces, was in stinging form, often leaving Lopez looking lovely on the baseline but not actually swinging a racket. Quite good, no? said the Spaniard smiling on the subject of his opponents serve. He did not seem too distraught by his departure. Possibly he had exceeded his own expectations by reaching his first Grand Slam quarter final and there were certainly times when it seemed he was unnerved to be in such exalted surroundings. 

The nerves, they didnt let me play bad, he said, but perhaps they did in crucial games as he flailed an easy forehand volley into the net to bequeath Hewitt the first set and then surrendered the second with a tame backhand slice. The packed, rapt audience groaned, already captivated by their new discovery. 

When Lopez leapt around the court he was reminiscent of a musketeer swinging from the arras. In contrast, if Hewitt ever flew in your open window, you would want to swat him with a rolled-up newspaper. He has an irritating buzz about him as far as rivals are concerned. He has already bluebottled his way to two Grand Slam titles, the 2001 US Open and Wimbledon in 2002, and is looking increasingly frisky as these championships wear on. 

Whether this will extend to troubling Federer remains to be seen. Playing the great man on grass is rather like throwing snowballs at the north face of the Eiger, not likely to make much impression. 

Im not sure what the key is, Hewitt said honestly. I havent won the last few. Hes obviously the best player in the world for a reason. Hes really taken his game to another level in the last couple of years. Hes got to be very confident against anyone and especially on the Centre Court here which hes pretty much made his own. 

It doesnt look as though Hewitt will go into the match with a psychological advantage then. But thats what we thought when the Australian cricket team lost to Bangladesh, then Andrew Symonds cracked 74 off 75 balls in the latest contest against England and no one can be too sure now. Mate, it all depends on the match-up out there, said Hewitt, speaking boldly for the Antipodes, a pugnacious stub of a pony-tail sticking through his red cap. 

So where were we? Ah yes, Lopez. Clearly his presence in international tennis will force Wimbledon to rethink their lady line-judge dress policy. 

No one expects them to be laced into something that Madonna would think twice about wearing, but there are mutterings about the extreme dowdiness of their grey-green, droop-hemmed garb, the sort of thing your great aunt would wear in the watching window of her old peoples home. Never mind incompetence, it makes you think of incontinence. 

The fact is, our swashbuckling Spaniard has brightened up the tournament and Wimbledon should repay the compliment. He may have made 29 unforced errors in the match to throw away his opportunity but between points he was splendid. 

 Well, Lleyton is a big player, no? he 

 said, explaining his difficulties out there. Someone should 

 point out to Lopez that he is a big player too (especially 

 across the shoulders) and we look forward to many more years 

 of unbridled admiration.

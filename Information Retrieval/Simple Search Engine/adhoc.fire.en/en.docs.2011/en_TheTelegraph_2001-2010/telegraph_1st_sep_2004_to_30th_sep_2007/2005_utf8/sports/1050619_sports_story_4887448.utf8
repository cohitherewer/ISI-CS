 India juniors beat Holland

 - Four-Nation Hockey 

 Sandeep Singh got 2 fine goals 

New Delhi: India held off a late charge from Holland to win their opening encounter 4-3 in the four-nation junior hockey tournament in Bilbao, Spain. 

According to information received here, Sandeep Singhs two brilliant drag-flick penalty corner conversions guided India to the fine victory. V. Raja and Dhananjay Mahadik slammed the other goals for the world champions. 

Hosts Spain thrashed Chile 6-1 in another game. 

Sandeep scored in the fifth minute before Holland equalised through a field goal taking advantage of a defensive lapse. But Mahadiks goal in the 25th minute ensured that India went to the half-time with a 2-1 lead. 

Two quick goals after the break put India in the drivers seat against their formidable European rivals. 

Trailing 1-4, Holland made a last ditch effort putting a lot of pressure on the Indian defence with some incisive moves. 

The Indian defence cracked under pressure as Holland scored twice in the last 10 minutes ? both through penalty corners ? in the face of some poor work by William Xalco and Mahadik.

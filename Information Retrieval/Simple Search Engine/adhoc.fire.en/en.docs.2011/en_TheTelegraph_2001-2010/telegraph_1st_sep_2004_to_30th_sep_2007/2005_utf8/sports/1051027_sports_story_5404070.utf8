 Pak not to send players

Islamabad: Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has expressed its inability to send players for the second edition of the Premier Hockey League (PHL) to be held in January due to clash of dates with its national championship. 

The PHF has, however, suggested that if the PHL dates are changed, the eight Pakistani players will be able to take part in the event slated to be played in Chandigarh,. It has also sent its activity programme to the Indian Hockey Federation, as reference. 

Pakistan had sent eight of its players for the inaugural edition of the PHL held earlier this year in Hyderabad.

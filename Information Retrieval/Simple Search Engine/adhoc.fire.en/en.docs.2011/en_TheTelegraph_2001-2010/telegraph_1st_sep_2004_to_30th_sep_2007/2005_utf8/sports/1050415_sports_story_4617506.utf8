The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sunil Dutt pitches for Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Describing the six-match ban on Team India captain Sourav Ganguly as ?extremely unfortunate?, Union sports and youth affairs minister Sunil Dutt said ?the move (by ICC Match Referee Chris Broad) is unwarranted as things like these (slow over-rate) might happen during a match?. 

Speaking on the sidelines of a seminar ?Sports as a Career?, organised by the FICCI Ladies Organisation at a city hotel on Thursday, Dutt said: ?My heart goes out to Sourav as I am a big fan of his leadership qualities.? 

Earlier, identifying lack of funds for the absence of a clear national sports policy, Dutt said sports should be at the forefront of government?s budgetary allocations. 

?Of the total outlay of Rs 400 crore, around Rs 200 crore alone is spent in paying salary to employees. In comparison, China has a budgetary allocation of around $1 billion,? Dutt rued. 

Speaking on the occasion, Bhaichung Bhutia called for more corporate sponsorship to better Indian prospects on the international arena.

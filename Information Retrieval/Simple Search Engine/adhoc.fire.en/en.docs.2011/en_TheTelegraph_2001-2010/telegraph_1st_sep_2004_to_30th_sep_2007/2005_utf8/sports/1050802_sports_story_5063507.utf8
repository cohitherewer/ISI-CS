 Mosley meets F1 drivers 

London: Formula One drivers met Max Mosley, head of the sports governing body, on Monday to discuss measures to improve safety at private testing. A dozen drivers, including both active world champions Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve, took part in the south of France talks. 

The meeting with the drivers was very constructive, said Mosley. The discussions covered a wide range of topics which included safety at testing, regulations for 2008, super-licences, overtaking and qualifying. 

The drivers want to put safety measures at test sessions on a par with grands prix. This is actually my biggest concern, Briton David Coulthard.

 Supriya still on top 

Sangli: Bengals Supriya Maji maintained her sole lead after the seventh round of 32nd womens national B chess meet here on Monday. 

Supriya, who drew her seventh round game with Tamil Nadus L Iswarya Shobhana on the top board after playing with black, is leading the pack with 5.5 points. 

The Bengal player is half a point clear of second-placed Amruta Mokal and Soumya Swaminathan (top seed) ? who scored a victory each in round seven. 

Shobhanas tie against Supriya was evenly balanced in the middle game before the latter, with an extra pawn, failed to press home her advantage. A draw was agreed upon after 76 moves. 

On the second board, H Sowmya of Tamil Nadu opened with Kings Pawn against Pune-based Soumya Swaminathan. The Maharashtra player replied with Sicilian Najdorf Variaion. 

Sowmya sacrificed her piece on 24th move, which proved to be a wrong step as Swaminathan, with an extra piece, gradually forced her rival to resign. 

On board three, Bengals Swati Mohota and J.E. Kavitha (Tamil Nadu) adopted safety-first attitude and the game expectedly ended in a draw after 31 moves.

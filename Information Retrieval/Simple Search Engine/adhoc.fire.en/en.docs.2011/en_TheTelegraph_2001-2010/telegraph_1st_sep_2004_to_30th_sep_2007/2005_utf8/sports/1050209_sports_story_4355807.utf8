The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dokic crashes out in first round

 - Sania moves into pre-quarters; Shikha makes early exit 

 Italy?s Mara Santangelo returns against Jelena Dokic in Hyderabad on Tuesday. Santangelo won 7-6, 6-3 

Hyderabad: Former world No. 4 Jelena Dokic of Serbia crashed out in the first round while top seed Na Li and last year?s finalist Maria Kirilenko advanced to the next round of the WTA Hyderabad Open tennis tournament on Tuesday. 

Clearly hampered by a thigh injury, Dokic went down to Italy?s Mara Santangelo 6-7 (2-7), 3-6 at the centre court of the sports authority of Andhra Pradesh Complex. 

Chinese girl Li, world No. 56, easily defeated Marie-Gayanay Mikalian of Switzerland 6-3, 6-3 and Russia?s Kirilenko whipped Bahia Mouthassine of Morocco 6-3, 6-1 to move into the second round. 

Dokic, 21, had pulled out of the recent Volvo Open at Pattaya in second round due to this injury. 

The winner of five WTA titles and currently ranked 126, Dokic could not do much as her movements on court were limited and that facilitated her Italian opponent to race to a 3-0 lead in the opener. The Serbian clawed her way back to level the score 3-3. 

The two then held their serve leading to tie-breaker in which Dokic was again clearly troubled by the injury. 

In the second set, Santangelo broke Dokic in the very first serve and then dominated her opponent to claim victory. 

Sania Mirza moved to the pre-quarter finals beating Romania?s Delia Sescioreanu in straight sets to keep the Indian hopes alive. 

The 18-year-old Indian, fresh from her historic run in the Australian Open, thrashed her opponent 6-2, 7-5 in the first round to lift the spirits of home fans after Shikha Uberoi crashed out. 

After demolishing Delia in the first set, the local favourite ran into stiff resistance in the second set before prevailing over the Romanian. 

Sania next runs into fourth seed Jie Zheng of China. 

Shikha?s singles campaign ended on a disappointing note as she lost to Hungary?s Melinda Czink in the very first round. 

Shikha started strongly taking the lead in the opener but Czink rallied superbly to win 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-2 at the centre court of sports authority of Andhra Pradesh Tennis Complex. 

Czink scaled her game several notches to win the match in three sets and emerge a deserving winner. 

Shikha, a US resident of Indian origin, had recently been allowed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) to represent India. She had entered into the second round in doubles in the company of Sania Mirza on Monday. 

The 21-year-old Shikha, who made her Grand Slam debut at the 2004 US open, began on a confident note taking a 5-2 lead in the first set and appeared to be in fine nick. But a slump in form allowed her opponent to recover and come back into the match. 

Czink never let go the opportunity and levelled the score 5-5 and then 6-6 leading to the tie-breaker, which turned out to be pulsating one with fortunes swinging like a pendulum. 

As a packed crowd held their breath, Shikha held her nerves to clinch the tie-breaker much to the delight of the jubilant crowd. 

Stung by the reverse, Czink, the world No. 128, pulled up her socks and took the battle to the rival camp even as Shikha appeared to be troubled by a sprain in her left thigh. 

Shikha then appeared to be struggling to get her rhythm and touch back. 

In the decider, Shikha lost serve in the first game and taking advantage of the situation, her opponent tightened her grip on the match. 

Though Shikha broke the Hungarian in the very next game to make it 1-1, much to the delight of the partisan crowd, Czinc broke Shikha in the fifth game to go 3-2 up and it was the Hungarian all the way thereafter.

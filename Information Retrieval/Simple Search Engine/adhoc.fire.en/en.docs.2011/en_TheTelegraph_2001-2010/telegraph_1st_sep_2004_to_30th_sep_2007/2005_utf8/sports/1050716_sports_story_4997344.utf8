 Amatol fancied 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Pradeep

 Bangalore: Amatol, from Pradeep Annaiahs yard, may be hard to toss in the 1,200m S.M. Ramakrishna Rao Memorial Cup here on Saturday. In his last outing, the Tirol-Kiss And Tell son was at a big disadvantage having lost his left front shoe soon after the start. B. Prithviraj partners the four-year-old.

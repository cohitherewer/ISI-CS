The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Three-day tie from today

Mutare: The Indian Test regulars have joined the squad as they take on Zimbabwe Board Presidents XI in the three-day tie beginning Thursday. 

The Indians arrived here this afternoon. They would surely play their Test regulars like opener Gautam Ghambir and VVS Laxman along with Dinesh Karthik. 

Looking ahead to the Test, it would be interesting to see what Indias choice among spinners would be. The wickets here do not overtly support spinners but dropping either Harbhajan Singh or Anil Kumble would be difficult. 

Harbhajan needs one wicket to reach 200-mark in Tests while Kumble has been in such roaring form that dropping him is out of question. 

TEAMS 

India (from): Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Mohammed Kaif, Dinesh Karthik, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Laxmipathy Balaji, Ashish Nehra. 

Zimbabwe Board Presidents XI (from): Hamilton Masakadza (captain), Keith Dabengwa, Chamunorwa Chibhabha, Charles Coventry, Graeme Cremer, Terrence Duffin, Dion Ebrahim, Anthony Ireland, Allan Mwayenga, Waddington Mwayenga, Vusumuzi Sibanda, Brendan Taylor, Sean Williams. (Agencies)

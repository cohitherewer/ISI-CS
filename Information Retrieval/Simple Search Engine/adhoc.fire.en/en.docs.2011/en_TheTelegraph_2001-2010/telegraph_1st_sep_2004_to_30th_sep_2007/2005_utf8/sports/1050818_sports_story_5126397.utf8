 India to play for pride vs Pakistan

Amstelveen: India will desperately look to break the agonising sequence of debacles when they clash with arch-rivals Pakistan in the RaboBank Cup (mini World Cup) on Thursday. 

India have already lost to Spain and world champions Germany and are thus out of medal contention. They will now play classification matches for the 5-8 places in this eight-nation meet. 

Even though India are not in contention for the top slots, a win over Pakistan could put them in third place in their pool. 

India coach Rajinder Singh jr has expressed his displeasure at the showing of his senior players. 

Pakistan coach Asif Bajwa, however, is all fired up after Wednesdays goalless draw against Spain and was exuding confidence, saying: We will win tomorrow. 

Pakistan possess a couple of world-class strikers in Rehan Butt and Shakeel Abbasi. The forwards, coupled with sturdy midfielders like skipper Mohammed Saqlain and Ghazanfar Ali, are capable of ripping open any defence. 

A do-or-die effort has to come from India with a co-ordinated and combined display of aggression by forwards Deepak Thakur, Prabhjot Singh, Gagan Ajit Singh and Rajpal Singh. 

The midfielders, particularly Bimal Lakra and Viren Rasquinha, also need to put in something extra to make up for the deficiencies of Prabhdeep Singh and Davinder Pal. 

Skipper Dilip Tirkey must find his rhythm if the Indians are to keep their heads high. (PTI)

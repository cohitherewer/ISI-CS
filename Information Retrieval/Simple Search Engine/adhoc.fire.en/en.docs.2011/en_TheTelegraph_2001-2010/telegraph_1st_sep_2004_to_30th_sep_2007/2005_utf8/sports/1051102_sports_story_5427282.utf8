 Hussey replaces Langer 

Sydney: Mike Hussey has replaced opening batsman Justin Langer in the Australia team to play the West Indies in the first Test starting in Brisbane on Thursday. 

Langer, who broke a rib batting in the domestic competition at the weekend, was ruled out after failing a fitness test at the Gabba on Tuesday. 

Its very painful, it feels like Ive got barbed wire in my chest every time I run, Langer told reporters. 

I know I wont be able to give 100 per cent to this great team, so unfortunately I wont be able to play. 

Langers omission will allow Hussey to make his Test debut after a long app- renticeship in first-class cricket. 

The left-hander has scored 15,313 first-class runs in his career, more than any other player to make his debut for Australia, though the 30-year-old said he doubted on Tuesday that he would get the opportunity. 

He (Langer) was batting fine and hitting the ball nicely. I was thinking oh no, this wasnt meant to happen, said Hussey. 

But at the end of his net he came over to me and said: Look Huss, youre in. I dont think I saw the first four or five balls in my net. It was a great feeling. 

You never lose hope. I guess I really feel like Ive had to earn it...and thats why its such a great honour. 

Langer said Hussey had earned the right to play Test cricket and was highly regarded by his new teammates. 

Hell have big respect from Haydos (fellow opener Matthew Hayden) and Im sure theyll form a good partnership for this one Test match, Langer said, emphasising the word one. 

Langer was ordered to rest as a precaution but is expected to be fit for the second and third Tests.

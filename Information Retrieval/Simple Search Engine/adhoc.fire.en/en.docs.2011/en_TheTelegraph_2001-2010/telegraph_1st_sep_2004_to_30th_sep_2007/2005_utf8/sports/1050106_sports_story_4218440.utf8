The Telegraph - Calcutta

 England stare at defeat

 - Third Test

 - Boje biggest threat on a wearing pitch 

 Robert Key is stumped by wicketkeeper A.B. de Villiers in Cape Town on Wednesday. 

Cape Town: Nicky Boje took two wickets for 25 in 20 overs and loomed as South Africa?s key bowler as they pushed on for victory over England in the third Test on Wednesday. 

England, who need an unlikely 501 to win, were 151 for five at the close on the fourth day. Graham Thorpe was batting on 22 with Geraint Jones on two. 

Left-arm spinner Boje looked the greatest threat to England?s slim chances of saving the match on a wearing pitch. 

England had needed to bat for just over five sessions after the home side set an improbable victory target but captain Michael Vaughan (20) and Robert Key (41) lost their wickets in the final session. 

Earlier, the home side, in total control but seeking quick runs, slumped from 184 for three to 222 to eight declared but that still left them ideally placed to square the five-match series at 1-1. 

England were unbeaten in Tests last year, winning 11 out of 13 and their last Test defeat was against Sri Lanka in Colombo in December 2003. But the run looks set to end. 

They lost their first wicket to the second ball of the innings without a run on the board when Marcus Trescothick attempted to work a delivery from Shaun Pollock to leg and sent a leading edge looping to Hashim Amla at silly mid-off. 

Boje took the key wicket of Andrew Strauss in the eighth over before tea when he trapped him in front for 39 to end a second-wicket stand of 68 with Key. 

Key was out stumped with the score on 103 and nine balls later England were 105 for four when Vaughan rashly pulled a ball from Makhaya Ntini to Jacques Rudolph at deep backward square leg. 

Thorpe and Andrew Flintoff kept the South Africans at bay for 71 minutes before Pollock had Flintoff caught behind for 20. 

South Africa scored 441 in their first innings. England were skittled out for 163. 

Meanwhile, Flintoff and Matthew Hoggard sustained injuries on Wednesday. 

Flintoff suffered an injury to the side of his abdomen while bowling in the morning session. 

Hoggard did not take the field at the beginning of play because of a heel injury suffered when he was struck on the foot walking behind the nets. (Reuters)

 Narain in talks with other teams

Mumbai: Jordan Formula 1 driver Narain Karthikeyan Monday said he had been approached by other teams for next season but added it was too early to decide about his future course of action. 

I have to keep all options open for the new season. Some other Formula 1 teams have been impressed with my performance so far (in his debut season) and have approached me. But its too early to decide on the matter. Karthikeyan told reporters during a promotional event of his sponsors Tata Indicom. 

He refused to elaborate, though. I dont want to speculate. There are only 20 drivers in Formula 1 out there while thousand others are waiting. 

Karthikeyan, enjoying a break from the circuit, felt he had learned a lot during the season. Every day has been a new learning experience for me. I have learned a lot technically and otherwise too, like talking to the media. Its a huge learning curve, he said. 

The driver reiterated he was focussed on Formula 1 and was not looking to be part of the A1 Grand Prix circuit.

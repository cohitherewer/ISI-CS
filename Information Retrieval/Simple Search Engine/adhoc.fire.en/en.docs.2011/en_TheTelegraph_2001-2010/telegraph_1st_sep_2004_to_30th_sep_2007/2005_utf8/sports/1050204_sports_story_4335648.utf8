Bloemfontein: South Africa captain Graeme Smith remained upbeat despite his team losing five wickets for 33 runs to tie the second one-day International against England on Wednesday night (as reported in Thursday?s Late City edition). 

?It was obviously disappointing that we didn?t close it out when we needed three runs off six balls, but there are lots of positives to come out of the game,? Smith said. 

?Everything was a lot better than in Johannesburg and we actually took the game away from them before things went awry in the last over. Funny things can happen in the last over, so that?s why we aim to finish games before that. 

Smith praised England?s bowlers, especially Kabir Ali, for their fightback. 

?They put the ball in the right places and I thought Kabir Ali bowled a superb last three deliveries, especially since the first two in that over had been waist-high full tosses.? 

Marcus Trescothick, who stood in as captain in the field for England as Michael Vaughan had a stomach bug, played down his role at the death. 

?I didn?t know what was going on, I was more concerned with chatting with Kabir than the field settings. 

?Kabir is our death bowler and he has plenty of experience of that with Worcestershire. He hadn?t had the greatest night and it was a crucial over, but he stuck his hand up and to do that in front of 15,000 people with the game in your hands and the rest of the match suddenly irrelevant is pretty impressive,? Trescothick said. 

The England opener admitted he thought his team was well beaten at times. 

?I didn?t think we could come back, but it?s amazing what pressure does. It?s a very, very good feeling to pull that one back from the fire,? Trescothick said. 

England actually took three wickets in a dramatic final over to force the tie. 

The home side, chasing 271 and hoping to level the seven-match series at 1-1, looked firm favourites on 263 for five and needing eight to win off Kabir?s final six balls. 

The match seemed settled when Kabir bowled a full-pitch no-ball with his first delivery which Mark Boucher pulled for four. 

Boucher was caught off an identical shot next ball and Ashwell Prince was run out but South Africa still only needed one run off the final delivery with the scores tied. 

Allrounder Andrew Hall missed it, however, and was stumped by wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, standing up, as the home side ended on 270 for eight, sparking huge celebrations among the England fielders. 

Kabir?s first seven overs had cost 49 runs. Jacques Kallis (63) and Herschelle Gibbs (78) had put on 134 for the third wicket to give their side a chance of victory. 

Gibbs passed 5,000 runs in one-day Internationals but the home side still needed 82 off the last 10 overs and 36 off five. 

Gibbs fell to a fine catch by Darren Gough at backward square-leg off Matthew Hoggard but Justin Kemp, Boucher and Shaun Pollock waded with some big hitting at the death before their hopes were dashed by Ali. 

Earlier, powerful right-hander Kevin Pietersen, born in South Africa before moving to England to improve his chances of international cricket, scored an unbeaten maiden century, finishing on 108 from 96 balls. 

Many of the spectators, in an orchestrated move, had turned their backscddc,,,vc vvbvmmmsszx on Pietersen as he walked back to the pavilion after his innings. 

Pietersen came in with England struggling on 67 for three and he and Vaughan consolidated with a stand of 80 off 110 balls. 

Vaughan was watchful in scoring his 42 off 82 deliveries, before he was run out by AB De Villiers attempting a second run to thirdman.

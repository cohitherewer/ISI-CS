 Nadal may not make final, says Federer 

Mark Hodgkinson

The All England Club gave Tim Henman a significant boost on Wednesday by awarding him a top-eight seeding for Wimbledon, the only one of the four Grand Slam events that does not simply follow the world rankings when seeding players. 

Henman, who has a world ranking of ninth, was seeded sixth, as the All England Club use a special grass-adjusted formula to calculate seedings. The significance for Henman was not where he was in the top eight seeds, but that he at least was one of the eight and will avoid the other leading players until the quarter-final stage. 

Wimbledon, which starts on Monday, does not follow the rankings automatically as the organisers believe that playing on a grass court is a specialised skill. 

Henman was helped by his record of reaching the quarter finals of Wimbledon for the last two years. He moves ahead of two players who have not shown the greatest aptitude for grass, Argentine Guillermo Canas and Russian Nikolay Davydenko, and would also have benefitted from Andre Agassi?s withdrawal through injury. 

The announcement of the seeds was hardly an issue to concern Roger Federer, the world No. 1 and men?s champion for the last two years, so instead he spent his afternoon relaxing in the palatial surrounds of Hampton Court in London, playing real tennis for the first time. 

He was, unsurprisingly, more interested in Wednesday?s draw. Federer was in relaxed, upbeat mood. 

?I came into Wimbledon last year with a lot of pressure on me, as I was defending my title for the first time, but this year it will be a lot easier for me. I have lived through it before. 

A further point of discussion Wednesday night was the allocation of the second seeding, which went to American Andy Roddick, last year?s beaten finalist. Roddick was promoted two places above his world ranking, which means that he cannot meet Federer until the final. 

Roddick won the first set of last year?s final but was beaten in four sets. 

Lleyton Hewitt, the world No 2, was therefore pushed down to third seed, so he may have to play Federer in the semi-finals as the Australian is placed in the top half. Hewitt is a former Wimbledon champion, with his triumph coming at the All England Club three years ago. 

Federer said that his main rivals are likely to be Roddick and Hewitt. 

?I would not be surprised if Roddick and Hewitt are involved in the latter stages, but I don?t like to look ahead that far. I would be surprised if Nadal reached a Wimbledon final, but he could be a threat as he is such a good player,? Federer said. 

?But I think that Henman will do better than Nadal. I think Henman can be dangerous on a grass court, and I will be wary of him at Wimbledon. Henman is a very good player on grass with his style of game.?

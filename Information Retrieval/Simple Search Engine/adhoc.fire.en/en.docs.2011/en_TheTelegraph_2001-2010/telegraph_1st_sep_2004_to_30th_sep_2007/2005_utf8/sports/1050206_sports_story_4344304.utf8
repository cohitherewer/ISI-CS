Calcutta: After a slowish start, East Bengal have moved into top gear in the ninth National Football League (NFL). Three consecutive away wins have given the red-and-golds the right impetus in their bid to complete a hattrick of NFL titles. 

Just about every rival camp is wary of Subhas Bhowmick?s team, despite Dempo being atop the standings currently. But, with the first phase of the marathon league just about halfway through, there is no big talk from the champions. 

In fact, the coach sounded extremely cautious on the eve of the sixth-round game against JCT. ?They (JCT) are an unpredictable side. Sukhi (Sukhwinder Singh) is one of the best coaches, he?s intelligent and tactically very good. Moreover, the Punjab boys run very hard, so we have to watch out,? Bhowmick said. 

With Brazilian striker Juliano set to make his India debut on Sunday, the excitement among East Bengal fans is quite understandable. He will surely partner Bhaichung Bhutia upfront, though Bhowmick didn?t reveal whether Ernest Jeremiah will start. 

Juliano, who has impressed everyone while practising 

with East Bengal for the past 10 days, will be the cynosure on Sunday. Most eyes 

will be trained on Bhaichung, too, as the India skipper seems to have rediscovered 

his scoring touch. 

The JCT coach has no qualms giving East Bengal the edge. ?They are a very good side with a lot of individual brilliance in their ranks? We know East Bengal will start as favourites,? said Sukhwinder. 

But that doesn?t mean the former India coach has given up before the first whistle has been blown. ?We can?t play defensive football for the entire 90 minutes. We will have to play with controlled aggression and then see how it goes.? 

JCT, with a tally of seven points from five matches, will depend on two foreigners ? Nigerian defender Julius and Ghanaian goalkeeper Mansuru Mohammed. It?s basically a young side sans any star. 

But, as Bhowmick said, they are a hard-running, spirited 

bunch without anything to lose. Such an outfit has often caught heavyweights napping.

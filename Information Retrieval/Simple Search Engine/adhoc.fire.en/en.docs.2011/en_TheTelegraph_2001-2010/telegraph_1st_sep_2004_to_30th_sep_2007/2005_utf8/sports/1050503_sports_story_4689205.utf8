The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Azlan Shah squad today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The final selection of the Indian team for the Azlan Shah Cup hockey meet to be held in Kuala Lumpur from May 26 to June 5 will be done in New Delhi Tuesday. 

It was learnt that the early selection was because the Union government has asked the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) for the list to be handed over to it because of ?clearance issues to be handled.? 

It was not clear whether the entire selection process was under government scanner. In the last edition India had sent a second-string team for the meet. 

Meanwhile, the IHF general body meeting is scheduled to be held in this city on May 23. Though election of office bearers is on the agenda, it isn?t clear yet which post of the federation will finally have an election. 

 CC amp;FC win big 

CC amp;FC thrashed Police AC 4-0 in a BHA first division group A match at the East Bengal ground on Monday. Jagdev Singh (2), Imran Khan and Gurdhayan Singh scored for the winners. In another match, Calcutta Customs edged past WB Police 1-0.

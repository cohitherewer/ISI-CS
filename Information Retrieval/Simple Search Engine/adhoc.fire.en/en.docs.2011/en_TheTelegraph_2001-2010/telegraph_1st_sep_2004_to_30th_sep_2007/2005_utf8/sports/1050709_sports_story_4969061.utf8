 Souravs 47 for shaky Glamorgan

London: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly stood tall among the ruins with a cautious 47 as Glamorgan were bundled out for 267 by tea on the opening day of the Frizzell county championship match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on Friday. 

Souravs was the top score although Glamorgan owed it to tailenders Andrew Davies (41 not out) and David Harrison (26) who put on 44 valuable runs for the ninth wicket to help the visitors reach a respectable total. 

Sourav, incidentally, turned 33 on Friday. 

South African left arm fast bowler Greg Smith was the wrecker-in-chief for the hosts with a haul of four for 64. 

At stumps, Nottinghamshire had scored 151 for the loss of two wickets in 43 overs. Stephen Fleming with an unbeaten 30, along with R. Warren (32 batting) were at the crease. (PTI)

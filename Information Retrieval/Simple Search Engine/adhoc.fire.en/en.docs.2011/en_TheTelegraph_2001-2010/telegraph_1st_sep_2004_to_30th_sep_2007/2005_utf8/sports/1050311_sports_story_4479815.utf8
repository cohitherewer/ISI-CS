The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bengal withdraw

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Bengal Tennis Association (BTA) has turned down All India Tennis Association?s (AITA) offer to stage next month?s Davis Cup tie versus Uzbekistan. 

AITA secretary Anil Khanna had sounded out the BTA last month itself, in case India got to play their second round Asia-Oceania group I tie at home, but secretary Hironmoy Chatterjee said no. 

The main reason is the fear of falling short on funds. ?There is no way Rs 40 lakh can be raised for a Davis Cup tie, that too, against Uzbekistan,? said Chatterjee. 

?The city has hosted a number of international tennis events already this season? the women?s Futures, ITF juniors and next week is the men?s Futures. Come September, the Sunfeast Open WTA meet will also involve a lot of money. Sponsors are not willing to shell out any more money for tennis right now,? explained Chatterjee. 

Even if the funds could have been organised, the BTA would still not have agreed to host the tie. ?The players want to play on grass only, that means it has to be at South Club. But we don?t want to have the tie there, I?m fed up with South Club,? said Chatterjee. 

?In the last tie they hosted (versus New Zealand), South Club had a direct agreement with the AITA. And yet, a week before the tie, they said the funds couldn?t be raised. The BTA had to run from pillar to post to raise money,? said Chatterjee..

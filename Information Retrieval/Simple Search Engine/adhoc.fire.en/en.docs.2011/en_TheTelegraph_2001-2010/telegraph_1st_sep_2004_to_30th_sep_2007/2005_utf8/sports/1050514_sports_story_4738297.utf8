 Ranatunga agrees to be in ICC body

 Ranatunga is tipped to be chairman of Lanka Cricket Committee 

Colombo: Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga Friday agreed to represent his country on a key International Cricket Council (ICC) committee, ending a self-imposed five-year exile from the game. 

Ranatunga, who quit international cricket in 2000, replaced former teammate and deputy Aravinda de Silva as Sri Lankas representative on the ICC Cricket Committee. 

Its been a while since I visited this place, Ranatunga said after arriving at Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) headquarters in downtown Colombo. I have tried to distance myself with the board politics because I was disgusted with what was going on and did not want to tarnish my image. 

Ranatunga, captain of the 1996 World Cup-winning squad, will attend the ICC Cricket Committee meeting chaired by former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar in Dubai on Monday and Tuesday. 

He is also tipped to take over as chairman of Sri Lankas Cricket Committee and expected to play a significant role in picking the next coach of the national team. 

I am looking forward to give something back, said the 41-year-old, who is also Sri Lankas deputy minister of tourism.

 Blake surrenders to Agassi might

 - It couldnt have been more fun to lose

 Andre Agassi celebrates his win over James Blake in the US Open quarter finals on Wednesday. More reports, results on Page 12 

New York: James Blake was already expressing his great respect for Andre Agassi. And that was long before they played one of the most memorable night matches ever held at the US Open. 

Blakes respect can only have heightened after the way the 35-year-old Agassi, with his efficient crablike steps very late at night, shortened the court and ambushed the 25-year-old Blake in five sets early Thursday morning. 

In the atmosphere of a big prize fight, but with two crowd favourites and no bad vibrations whatsoever, Blake used his youth and speed and power, but gallant old Agassi won the last three sets to win their quarter final match, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6). Then they hugged at the net, and Blake said, It couldnt have been more fun to lose. 

Blake had never been anywhere remotely close to where he was, in the quarter finals of the US Open. He had lost all five times he wandered into a fifth set. As his two-set lead vanished, he stared across the net with all the awe of Fast Eddie Felson looking at a renewed Minnesota Fats in the pool movie The Hustler. Blake even changed his shirt, from sleeveless yellow to sleeveless white and blue for the fifth set, but the old man had more in reserve than the young man. 

Either way, one American was going to be in the final of this tournament on Sunday. Agassi, seeded seventh, and Robby Ginepri, who is unseeded, are going to meet in the semi-finals Saturday. 

There have been classic night matches at the US Open before, often involving poisonous histrionics, with John McEnroe or Ilie Nastase howling at the moon, or Andy Roddick losing his mind, at least temporarily, over a bad call, or Bjorn Borg getting bushwhacked yet again. 

Wednesday night, there were no issues, just two popular Yanks having a hit in front of a large and expectant crowd. 

Blake was already the feel-good player of this tournament, having the best two years of his career after the triple blows of losing his father to cancer, breaking his neck and having his face paralysed from shingles, all last year. 

James is an easy guy to like and hes an easy guy to root for, Agassi said on Monday. If hes getting the better of me if we happen to play, I couldnt wish it for a better person. 

With those words, Agassi set the tone for perhaps the most positive night match you will ever see at the Open. It was virtually impossible to root against either player, which can be a frustrating condition for New Yorkers, who are eager to see morality plays in every match, heroes and villains. 

Wednesday nights match did not become one of those assassin-victim American matches, like the infamous Jimmy Connors-Aaron Krickstein match, where Connors mugged Krickstein, mugged the chair umpire, held the entire stadium at ransom. 

And this was not one of those ongoing Venus-Serena matches, in which picking sides ? the Introverted Sister, the Combative Sister ? would seem inappropriate. Wednesday night there were no shenanigans. 

Blake said he would not be disappointed even if he lost love-love-love to Agassi, saying, Once I get over the initial loss, Ill think about some of the good things that have happened this year. 

There was no love-love-love. Well after midnight, the old man outlasted the young man ? respectfully, of course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A trophy tough to win in its own right

Berlin: The Confederations Cup promises to be much more than just a technical rehearsal for the World Cup, with Argentina and Brazil among the eight teams preparing for two weeks of pressure-free football in five venues across Germany. 

For Germany, the 2006 World Cup hosts, getting the organisational details right will of course be the priority, as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Hannover, Nuremberg and Cologne prepare to stage a total of 16 matches from June 15 to 29. 

The competition itself though will be a tough one to win and whoever does emerge as champions will have earned their accolade the hard way. 

As well as featuring the German hosts and Brazil, the world champions, it is also a showcase for the talents of the champions of all of Fifas six confederations plus Argentina, who enter as Olympic champions. 

Fifa are billing the event as a Festival of Champions and that should sum up the mood of the event. The pressure may be off, but there is still serious work to be done. 

Germany, drawn in Group A with Argentina, Australia and Tunisia, will also have a duty to get things right on the field, with the onus on coach Juergen Klinsmann to show fans that a home triumph next year is possible. (Reuters)

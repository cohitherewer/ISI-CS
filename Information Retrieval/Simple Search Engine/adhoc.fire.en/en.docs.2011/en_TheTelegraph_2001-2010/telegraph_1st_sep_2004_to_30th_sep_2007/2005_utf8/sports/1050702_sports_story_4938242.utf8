 Venus played with unchained energy

 As Venus Williams left Centre 

 Court, her cell phone was already glowing. Wherever Serena 

 Williams was, she was dialling up her big sister to ask 

 their ritual question, Can I have your autograph? 

 In this wired age, Serena promptly 

 followed up her call with an e-mail message, giving assorted 

 reactions, coaching tips and, who knows, maybe even sisterly 

 style advisories. 

 Wouldnt you like to 

 know? Venus stonewalled a reporter with a huge yet 

 characteristically distant smile. She was very encouraging. 

 Serena was not only encouraging. 

 She was also very far away. And in her absence, her big 

 sister was unleashed, a wraith in a white dress, whapping 

 forehands, chasing down anything that moved. 

 This was a Venus Williams the 

 world rarely sees ? the willowy athlete liberated, at least 

 temporarily, from the warm and genuine 1 and 1A bond she 

 shares with Serena. 

 Venus would not say this, of course. 

 She rarely says anything revealing. She did her speaking 

 in the dank confines of Centre Court on Thursday, taking 

 down the defending champion, Maria Sharapova, 7-6 (7-2), 

 6-1, in the Wimbledon semi-finals, which turned out to be 

 one of the most impressive matches Venus has ever played. 

 We have all witnessed those matches 

 between Serena and Venus that always seem unsatisfactory 

 because neither seems able to move, emotionally tethered 

 to each other as if with clattering beads or smooth velvet. 

 Not to say that Venus broke loose on Thursday with Martina 

 pumped fists or Jimbo bumps and grinds. Venus is always 

 a cool and distant planet. Yet she played with unchained 

 energy. 

 Well, I dont think 

 it has anything to do with family or anything like that, 

 said Sharapova, mature and gracious at 18. It was 

 Venus out there. It wasnt Serena. I just played against 

 a really good opponent. You know, I thought we played a 

 really good match. Today it went to the better person. 

 It was a really good match, circa 

 2005. One of my purist European colleagues, who learned 

 this sport on a wooden racket, grumbled later that this 

 was a tennis version of Million Dollar Baby, 

 more boxing than tennis. But this is where we are, an age 

 in which a 6-foot-1 Williams plays a 6-foot Sharapova. 

 The main thing is, shes 

 a good athlete, she gets a lot of balls back and shes 

 very tough, Sharapova had said of Williams on Tuesday. 

 On Thursday, they both arrived 

 fashionably late after killing much of the afternoon because 

 of a maddening mist. Due to be on second at Centre Court, 

 Venua and Sharapova were suddenly told that the Amelie Mauresmo-Lindsay 

 Davenport semi-final would be shunted to Court One, and 

 they would have to get out there and play, soon. 

 After a 25-minute delay to warm 

 up their lanky frames, Sharapova and Venus arrived on court, 

 Sharapova in white bell-bottom warm-up pants and a white 

 sweater. She promptly removed the pants, to the accompaniment 

 of avid whistles. Venus also received whistles when she 

 removed her jacket and revealed a classic white tennis dress. 

 Then Sharapova received whistles 

 when she removed her white sweater, revealing narrow spaghetti 

 straps of a white tennis top. It was all very elegant. Then 

 the two jocks with big hearts started pounding tennis balls, 

 exhaling audibly (but not obtrusively), and the runway aspect 

 was emphatically over. 

 They traded shots, not with pitty-pat 

 rallies but explosive passing shots, reaching deuce most 

 of the time, averaging five minutes per game. Sharapova 

 faltered briefly in the tie-breaker, and then was broken 

 in the first game of the second set, the first four-point 

 game they had played. 

 Then the clouds lowered again. 

 Venus, who rarely gives up more than her name, rank and 

 serial number, conceded later that she had wanted to get 

 this match over before rain or nightfall arrived. 

 On match point, Williams had a 

 backhand into a wide-open corner. Sharapova admitted she 

 had already been looking to salute her friends and family 

 in the stands. But Williams missed by an inch or two. 

 The balls bouncing 

 tricky on this court, Williams said later, adding, 

 So I just overhit a little bit.

 She continued: I wasnt 

 too stressed, but I wanted that point, obviously, and the 

 weather was getting bad. I was trying not to focus on the 

 weather, just on the tennis. I wanted that break. I wanted 

 to win the match there. I got blessed. It happened.

 After various electronic connections 

 with Serena, Venus met members of the news media. She won 

 here twice, in 2000 and 2001, and was not about to say she 

 owns even a sliver of Wimbledon. I think many people 

 have had this place, Venus said. Navratilova, 

 Graf, Billie Jean King, all those people. Its just 

 something thats rented, thats for sure. quot; 

 She would sublet here with her 

 sister. Thats how close they are. But this week, Venus 

 Williams is living on her own, and it shows.

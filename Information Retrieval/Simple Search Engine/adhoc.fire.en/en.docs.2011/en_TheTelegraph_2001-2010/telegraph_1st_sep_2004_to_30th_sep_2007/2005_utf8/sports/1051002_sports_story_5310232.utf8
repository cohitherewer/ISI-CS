Calcutta: Perhaps the seasons best match was left for the last day and that too on slushy Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. When Mohun Bagan were on the verge of scripting history, Mohammedan Sporting spoiled their party holding them 2-2 in CFL Premier Divisions last match. The green-maroon brigade thus finished on 40 points from 14 games while Mohammedan Sporting finished third with 23. 

Tollygunge Agragami were, however, relegated from the top tier for the first time since 1969, following a 0-2 defeat at the hands of George Telegraph at Howrah Stadium. 

It was Raman Vijayan who drew first blood in 27th minute and Satyajit Bose increased the margin four minutes later. Just on the stroke of half-time, Tomba Singh pulled one back for the league leaders and Dipendu Biswas found the equaliser in the 58th minute. 

Winning was far off at one point of time, and it seemed doubtful whether Mohun Bagan would be able to finish unbeaten as they were trailed by a couple of goals. Mohammedan Sporting were bang on target from the first minute and made it difficult for the Bagan defenders to put a check on their frequent attacks. 

The black-and-white brigade shot into the lead when an Amjad Ali flag-kick was headed home nicely by veteran Vijayan. Within a space of four minutes they enhanced their lead. Patrick D Souza, who bagged the Man-of-the-Match award, sent an immaculate through for advancing Satyajit, who after receiving the ball sped past Noel Wilson and placed it to the right of a diving Subrata Paul. 

Just at the stroke of the breather, Mohun Bagan pull one back as a Rodrigue shot rebounded off a defender. This time Tomba didnt make nay mistake in slotting it home. 

Suley Musah, Mohammed Mukhtar and Patrick were the liverwire of Mohammedan Sporting attacks and created a lot of chances making the lives of the Sanjay Partes, Mehrajuddin Wadaos and Wilsons miserable. 

Mohun Bagans equaliser was nicely executed by Dipendu. Partes cross from the right was headed in by an unmarked Dipendu. 

In fact, had referee Udayan Halder been a bit alert Mohun Bagan and Amal Dutta could have achieved what they had hoped for till the start of this match. The referee remained unmoved even as the ball hit Mukhtars hand inside the penalty box. Mohun Bagan was unlucky not to be awarded the spot-kick. 

In the 18th minute, Halder flashed the yellow card to six footballers ? Patrick, Musah, Mehrauddin, Eduardo Coelho and A.S. Feroze ? for being engaged in a brawl. 

Disappointed Mohun Bagan coach Dutta refused to speak after the match and hinted that his only disappointment was horrible refereeing. 

Meanwhile, Tollygunge Agragami were relegated to the Super Division after they lost to George Telegraph 0-2. Francis in the seventh minute and Gautam Thakur in the 62nd minute struck for the winners. Tollygunge Agragami had to win this match to save relegation. 

Coach Krishnendu Roy took all the blame for this dismal show, but also stated that he will not leave the job and try for improvement. 

In the third match of the day, Ever-Ready defeated Calcutta Port Trust 2-0 with Siddhartha Thapa and Eugene Gray scoring. 

East Bengal footballer Syed Rahim Nabi and Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit were adjudged the best footballer and coach of the month, respectively by IFA.

 Brussels: Luxembourg has declined to help fund next year?s Formula One Grand Prix at Belgium?s famous circuit in Spa which has been hit by financial problems.

 Belgium has sounded out the Grand Duchy in a search for funding to secure the future of its Spa Grand Prix.

 ?Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker has stated...that the current budgetary situation does not allow Luxembourg?s authorities to participate financially in this event,? the Luxembourg government said in a statement late on Friday.

 Spa is one of Formula One?s great and historic circuits but last month?s race had poor ticket sales. 

 Oviedo: Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso was one of eight people to receive this year?s Prince of Asturias prize from the heir to the Spanish crown.

 The 24-year-old Alonso is the youngest person ever to the receive the prestigious award, which honour work in such areas as science, art, communications, literature, international cooperation and sport.

 Previous sports award winners include Carl Lewis, Steffi Graf and Hicham el Guerrouj. 

 London: World champion Paula Radcliffe will attempt a fourth victory in the London marathon on April 23 next year after finally capturing an elusive global title last August. The 31-year-old Briton, who set the world record of 2:15.25 in the 2003 London race, won the world title in Helsinki after dropping out during last year?s Athens Olympics.

 ?This is great news and a bonus for London to have Paula confirmed early,? said race director David Bedford. 

 Bangalore: India?s Chetan Anand lost to world No. 8 and fourth seed Mohammed Hafix Hashim of Malaysia in the quarter final of the Danish Open Badminton Championships. After bagging the first game 15-11, he could not sustain the tempo and lost the next two games 10-15, 9-15 to the 2003 all England champion, according to information received here.

 Madrid: Male models will be used as ballboys at the 2006 WTA Tour championships, officials announced here.

 With female models into their second year of similar duties at this week?s ATP Madrid Masters, the Spanish organisers believe they are on to a good thing.

 Like their counterparts, the males will be kitted out by an international clothing sponsor for their on-court duties during the women?s end of season finale, which will move to Spain from Los Angeles.

 In their second year at the masters, the females have again drawn attention ? and television exposure ? to the sellout event which expects to attract a record 120,000 spectators through the gates by Sunday. 

 Melbourne: Former world No. 8 Alicia Molik, forced to take a break from tennis due to a persistent virus that is affecting her balance, has no plans to retire in the near future, her manager said on Saturday. ?It?s nowhere near any kind of retirement,? Molik?s manager Lisa Chaffey said. ?She is more than likely just going to take a significant period of time off.?

 McLaren vow to keep Raikkonen 

 - He has capability of winning many world championships: Team boss 

 Speculation is doing the rounds that Raikkonen can be top of Ferraris shopping list 

Helsinki: McLaren say they will fight to keep Formula One race winner Kimi Raikkonen with them for years to come. 

We will fight to keep Kimi on the team, McLaren boss Ron Dennis told a television channel late on Wednesday. Kimi Raikkonen will stay on this team as long as he wants. 

He has a capability of winning many, many world championships. Not one, many, he added. 

And if we dont deliver it to him, I am absolutely sure that he will look at other Grand Prix teams in the future to find it elsewhere. 

Raikkonen, 25, won last weekends Spanish Grand Prix and was runner-up in the 2003 season to Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. 

Ferrari boss Jean Todt has made no secret of his admiration for the Finn and there has been much speculation that Raikkonen will be top of the champions shopping list when they need to find a replacement for Schumacher. 

The 36-year-old German, who has yet to win a race this year, has a contract with Ferrari until the end of 2006 but he too has been told by his team that he can stay as long as he wants. 

Raikkonen is in his fourth season at Mercedes-powered McLaren, whose last champion was Finlands Mika Hakkinen in 1999, and is third in the standings at present. His teammate is Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya.

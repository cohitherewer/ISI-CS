London: England and Australia completed an extraordinary finish to tie their triangular series one-day final at Lords on Saturday. 

England, chasing 197 for victory, needed 10 to win off Glenn McGraths last over and three off the final delivery with the last two men at the crease. 

Ashley Giles stole two runs to third man as Brett Lee mis-fielded the ball. 

The finish, in front of a packed crowd of more than 24,000, left the world champions in a state of shock after they had looked certain of victory. 

Bowled out for 196 after being asked to bat in seamer-friendly, overcast conditions, they reduced the home side to 33 for five in the 10th over only for Paul Collingwood (53) and Geraint Jones (71) to resurrect English hopes with a 116-run stand for the sixth wicket. 

Earlier, Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison produced a commanding performance as England dismissed Australia for 196. 

The home sides seam attack, given first chance to exploit helpful overcast conditions, recovered from an early mauling to hit back with interest as the world champions were bowled out with seven balls of their 50 overs to spare. 

Harmison took three for 27 while all rounder Flintoff, the pick of the bowlers, claimed three for 23. Michael Hussey, batting at seven, top-scored for the world champions with an unbeaten 62. 

The first six-and-a-half overs, however, were all Australia. In retrospect, they seemed to belong to another game. Faint-hearted Englishmen, indeed, might have been tempted to concede there and then as Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist harvested 50 off 39 balls. 

Simon Jones, pitching too short and then too full, was hit for four fours in a row by Gilchrist ? one admittedly edged just wide of second slip ? and retired to the outfield with figures of three overs for 29 runs. 

The next 50 runs, however, took 20 overs, five wickets falling in the process as Englands seamers nipped the ball about. Two wickets fell for four runs. Hayden, driving on the up at Darren Gough after making 17, caught the ball on the toe and looped it to mid-off. 

Flintoff, having replaced Jones, hit a perfect length immediately, beating Gilchrist repeatedly as he moved the ball up and down the slope before the left-hander, pulling, skied to Kevin Pietersen at mid-wicket after making 27. 

Michael Vaughans second bowling change was as effective. Ricky Ponting, still struggling with his form, pulled Gough for six but then leg-glanced Harmisons first ball behind, returning to the pavilion in a fury. 

Harmison bagged a second when Damien Martyn made 11 before failing to get forward and edging behind to make it 90 for four, and it was 93 for five, with halfway approaching, when Jones returned with a fine second spell to trap Michael Clarke for a couple. 

Andrew Symonds and Hussey, Australias last chance, rebuilt, but slowly. Paul Collingwood and Ashely Giles looked like Englands bowling Achilles heel but Symonds, a master at pacing an innings, this time failed to capitalise on a cautious start. 

The Australian pair put on 54 with dabs and glides before Symonds, scoring 29 off almost 12 overs, flat-batted a rasping drive off Collingwood medium-pacers deep into Andrew Strauss midrift at extra cover. At 147 for six with 11 overs left, Hussey found himself with tailenders for company. 

Harmison, however, returned with a brute which Brad Hogg could only glove high to Geraint Jones while Flintoff was too good for Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, both caught behind off consecutive balls.

Lahore: Pakistan batted throughout the third day for the loss of just one wicket to take complete control of the final Test against England on Thursday. 

The home side, needing only a draw to win the series and condemn England to their first series defeat for two years, were 446 for five in their first innings. 

Mohammed Yousuf took his overnight total of 84 to 183 not out and wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal was unbeaten on 115, the pair sharing an unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 199. 

Nightwatchman Shoaib Akhtar was the only wicket to fall, caught by Shaun Udal off Liam Plunkett for his highest Test score of 38. Yousuf added 67 with Shoaib before joining forces with Akmal who scored his second Test hundred to put Pakistan in the driving seat. 

Yousuf, closing in on his third Test double century, shrugged off a shoulder injury to reach his 14th Test hundred and third against England in style by hitting off spinner Shaun Udal straight over his head for six. 

Shoaib had also smashed Udal for two sixes in the mid-wicket area. Akmal, 23, went to his hundred by driving Plunkett smoothly through covers but not before surviving a chance at 95 when Marcus Trescothick put him down at slip off Plunkett, the only bowler to consistently pitch the ball up on a benign track. 

Udal was given only 12 overs and Pakistans fine batting ensured their skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq had more time to recover from a wrist injury sustained fending off a short pitched ball from Steve Harmison on Wednesday. 

The sixth-wicket stand bettered Pakistans previous best against England, 145 between Mushtaq Mohammad and Intikhab Alam at Hyderabad in 1972-73.

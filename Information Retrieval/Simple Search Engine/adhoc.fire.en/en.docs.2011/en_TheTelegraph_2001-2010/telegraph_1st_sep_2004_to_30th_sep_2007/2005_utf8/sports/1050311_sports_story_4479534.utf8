 Mourinho fined ?5000

 London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been fined ?5,000 over comments he made after the first leg of the League Cup semi-final against Manchester United in January. 

Mourinho, whose team are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League, accused United manager Alex Ferguson of trying to influence referee Neale Barry at halftime in the 0-0 Stamford Bridge draw on January 12. 

The English FA said on Thursday after a disciplinary hearing that Mourinho had also been warned about his future conduct. 

The FA initially indicated it would not take any action against the Portuguese manager before charging Mourinho with improper conduct. Chelsea won the second leg of the semi-final at Old Trafford and went on to beat Liverpool in the final on February 27. 

After that match the Portuguese coach was reminded of his responsibilities after making shushing motions with his finger in front of Liverpool supporters after Chelsea scored their equaliser. (Reuters)

 Ponting praise for Hussey, Watson

 Man of the Match Mike Hussey en route to his unbeaten 75 on Sunday 

Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting praised Shane Watson and Mike Hussey for rescuing the innings in their 156-run victory over the World XI in the final one-day International on Sunday. 

Man-of-the-Match Watson, who also took four for 39 and ran out Virender Shewag, scored 66, while Hussey added 75 in an unbroken 145-run partnership for the world champions, who scored an imposing 293 for five. 

Brett Lee then knocked the top of the World XIs batting order with three wickets for 21 runs in a hostile five over spell before Watson mopped up the middle order and tail in the composite teams 137 all out. 

Their (Hussey and Watson) partnership was the defining moment for us, Ponting told a news conference. We were under a bit of pressure at that stage. 

We had lost three (wickets) for five when those two came together and it shows the maturity of these guys in the way they approach their cricket in the way they got us from a very sticky situation to a very commanding one in the game. 

Ponting also said he felt Watsons experience playing County cricket for Hampshire had helped his development. 

Ive kept a pretty close eye on Shane in the way he has played cricket in the last few months in England and he controlled one-day innings very well over there. 

He has learnt a lot about that side of his game. 

Watson, who was also Man of the Match in the first game, agreed with his captain that playing in England had helped him. 

Im just trying to enjoy myself more and enjoy my cricket and not put too much pressure on myself now, the 24-year-old said. 

Pollock also heaped praise on the Australians for their splendid performance all through the series. Theyve really played well. They won the toss and went on superbly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SBT relegation confirmed

Margao: State Bank of Travancore (SBT) held Churchill Brothers to a 1-1 draw in their 20th round match of the National Football League at Nehru Stadium here Thursday. The result, however, could not stop SBT from demoting as they are now placed at the bottom of the table. 

In the 37th minute, Marcos Parreira capped on a long pass by Sujay Dutta, after ?keeper Jean Christian and defender Abdul Basheer, failed to intercept, and gave Churchill the lead. But SBT, who looked more purposeful in their attack, restored parity in the stoppage time of the first half through Abdul Hakkim. 

Churchill?s draw will help Mohun Bagan?s cause, who, with 18 points, will take on JCT in Ludhiana on Saturday. 

SBT, however, created more scoring chances in the second half and almost scored in the 76th minute but a timely save by ?keeper Marc Mascarenhas denied the visitors. (PTI)

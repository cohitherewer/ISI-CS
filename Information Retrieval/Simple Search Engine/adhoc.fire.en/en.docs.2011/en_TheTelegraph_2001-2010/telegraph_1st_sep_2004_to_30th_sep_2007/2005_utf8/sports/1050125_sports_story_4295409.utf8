The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak team arrives 

New Delhi: A two-member venue assessment team from Pakistan arrived here on Monday and set the tone for the upcoming cricket series between the arch-rivals by declaring that it had come with an ?open mind and not a negative attitude?. 

The team, comprising Zakir Khan, general manager (operations) of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Sohail Khan, senior superintendent of police, Lahore, is on a five-day visit. 

Zakir said the team hoped to cover all venues, announced by the BCCI for the three Tests and five one-dayers. ?We will be heading for Mohali tomorrow although a formal schedule is yet to be worked out,? he told reporters on his arrival here. 

The PCB official dismissed a report in Pakistani press which claimed that the Pakistani foreign ministry was against playing a Test match in Ahmedabad. 

?I am not sure about the foreign ministry statement but our chairman (Shaharyar Khan) has made a statement that a decision on venues would be taken only after the venue assessment team submits its report. Anyway, it is too early to say anything on feasibility of Ahmedabad as one of the venues. We have come with an open mind and not a negative attitude,? Zakir said.

 Moody is Steves choice

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Tom Moody got a big boost on Wednesday when Aussie icon Steve Waugh named the 39-year-old as his choice for the post of Team India coach. 

Greg Chappell has a very sharp cricketing brain. But Moody is young, talented and will gel with the Indian team better, Waugh said at a city hotel. 

According to Waugh, Moody has a very good work ethic and vision. He is ambitious and very keen to get the job. If I were to choose, I would prefer him. 

Waugh also recommended Jawagal Srinath as Team Indias bowling coach. 

Waugh used the example of Irfan Pathan, who was quite ordinary in the series against Pakistan, to illustrate the importance of a bowling coach. There were injuries in bowling department. Under the circumstances, Srinath could be considered as a bowling coach.

 India, 

Sri Lanka match called off due to rain

Mumbai: The eighth edition of the Women?s Cricket World Cup in Pretoria, South Africa got off to an enticing start on Tuesday. 

According to information reaching here, the Indian bowlers led by left-arm spinner Neetu David, the most dreaded bowler in the Indian side, who picked up three for 17, kept up the pressure on the Sri Lankan batswomen restricting them to only 116 in 46.5 overs. Shashikala Siriwardena with a 63-ball 29 was the top-scorer for the Lankans. 

The Indians who looked like they would easily refit the score, however, could face only two overs before rain intervened and forced the match to be called off. 

India had reached four for no loss at that time. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat. 

As there are no reserves days in the opening group matches all teams will receive three points. 

Jhulan Goswami picked up one wicket giving five runs, while Nooshin took two for 28. 

Brief scores: Sri Lanka 116 in 46.5 ovs (Shashikala Siriwardena 29, Chamari Polgammpola 20, Hiruka Fernando 21; Neetu David 3/17, Nooshin Al-Khadeer 2/28, Jhulan Goswami 1/5). India 4/0. Match abandoned.

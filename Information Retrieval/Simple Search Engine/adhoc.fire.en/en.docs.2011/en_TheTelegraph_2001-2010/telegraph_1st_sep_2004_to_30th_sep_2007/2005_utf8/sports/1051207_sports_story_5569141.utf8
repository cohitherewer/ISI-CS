 NZ hope to bounce back 

Wellington: New Zealand believe they can stay in the ODI series against Australia here on Wednesday following a dismal showing in the first of three matches. 

New Zealand are likely to name an unchanged side for the match in which security will be stepped up after fruit and plastic bottles were thrown at Australian fielders in Auckland on Saturday. 

Stand-in captain Daniel Vettori said the key will be defusing the firepower of Australian speedster Brett Lee who took three for five in Auckland as the home side collapsed to be all out for 105 in the 147-run defeat. 

We need to answer some basic questions about what we need to do against him. I think weve done that and I think well get a turnaround in performance tomorrow, Vettori said. 

Australia delayed the naming of their team with Nathan Bracken still recovering from a bout of flu. But Ricky Ponting said he believed Bracken would be fit for the match. 

Australian officials met their New Zealand counterparts to discuss security. Ten people were arrested and 40 were thrown out.

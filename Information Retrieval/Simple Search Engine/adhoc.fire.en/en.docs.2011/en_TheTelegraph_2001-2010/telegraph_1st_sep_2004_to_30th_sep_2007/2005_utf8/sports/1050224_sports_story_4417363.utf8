The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB take on a depleted Dempo today

 Bhaichung will lead the charge upfront 

Margao: Injury-hit Dempo will be under pressure when they take on East Bengal in a crucial 10th round match of the National Football League tie for the ONGC Cup here on Thursday. 

East Bengal are at the top with 21 points from nine matches and are four points ahead of Dempo, who have played one match less. Thus Thursday?s clash is quite crucial for the title aspirants. 

The defending champions will look to carry on their unbeaten run in the league. But they will be without key Brazilian midfielder Douglas da Silva, who has undergone surgery on broken right shin bone which he suffered during the previous match against Mahindra United. 

However, with Bhaichung Bhutia and Climax Lawerence in form and Shylo Malswamtluanga, Alvito D?Cunha lending good support, East Bengal will pose a threat to the rival defence. 

Dempo on the other hand, will be missing defender Stanley Colaco, Sameer Naik and medio Jose Colaco due to injuries. Sitting with them in the bench will be wingers Melvyn Rodrigues and Valareino Rebello who have double booking. 

Dempo will be looking to their star strikers Ranty Martins and R.C. Prakash to carry the load upfront. Medio Clifford Miranda will have to rise to the occasion along with Riston Rodrigues and Mario Soares. With Satish Kumar returning from injury, Dempo will have a safe pair of hands under the bar. 

Dempo coach Armando Colaco seemed not too worried with the absence of his key players saying that he has enough resources to replace the injured. 

?It will be a good contest.A win will help us to close the gap and keep ourselves in running for the title,? Colaco said. 

Meanwhile, Mahindra United hold a clear edge over State Bank of Travancore when the two clash at the Cooperage in Mumbai on Thursday. Mahindra have 13 points from eight matches while the bankmen have nine points from as many ties. (PTI)

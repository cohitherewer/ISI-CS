 F1 teams hearing today

Paris: Motor racing faces a potentially divisive meeting Wednesday when seven Formula One teams who refused to race in last weeks US Grand Prix over the safety of their tyres are hauled before a disciplinary hearing. 

Reports have suggested teams could boycott future races if they get severe penalties for their role in the US Grand Prix fiasco. 

But Max Mosley, president of F1s governing body the FIA, has warned: The governing body will always win. 

In an interview last week, Mosley dismissed fears of a strike and said: Im not concerned if they take an antagonistic line. What are they going to do? If they go on strike, theyre simply cutting off their nose to spite their face. That wont happen. 

Mosley says punishment could range from a reprimand to a ban for life ? but he thought the punishment would fall between those two extremes. If it emerges that the guilt of certain teams is of a certain level, then a ban will be justified, he said. There are various other possibilities ? points being deducted, a fine or reprimand. 

Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said it would be wrong for to hand out draconian bans to the seven teams at the hearing. Would we race after a penalty? I think wed have a meeting and you wouldnt guarantee it, Stoddart said. 

It could be anything ? I have heard unofficial reports of what it might be, ranging from a $2.5 million fine to a suspended ban, to all kinds of possible things. I would hope Max would come to his senses but who knows? 

Stoddart, who blamed Mosley for the fiasco, said the teams would fight a ban all the way through the civil courts. 

Mosley has defended his decision to block a plan to build a chicane at the circuits final corner which could have solved the problem at Indianapolis where Michelin found their tyres could not withstand the pressure of the banked curves. 

Mosley said the FIA could not change its rules just because some teams had not taken the right equipment to a race. 

But Stoddart, whose team use Bridgestone tyres and did race in the US, admitted that while Michelin had erred, it had made every effort to solve the problem. They chartered a private jet and flew in replacement tyres and found they had the same problem. At that point what we needed was crisis management.

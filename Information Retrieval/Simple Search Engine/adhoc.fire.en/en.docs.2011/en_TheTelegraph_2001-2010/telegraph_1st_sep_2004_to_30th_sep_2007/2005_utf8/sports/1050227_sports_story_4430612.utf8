Wellington: Australia beat New Zealand by 87 runs in the third one-day International in Auckland on Saturday to take an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. 

Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey hit half-centuries in an unbroken, record partnership of 136 to help Australia amass 264 for five before New Zealand collapsed to 177 all out in the 42nd over. 

Hamish Marshall was the only New Zealand batsman to show any real resistance, top-scoring with 55 from 87 balls. No one else made more than 27. 

?It was a total we were confident of defending,? Australia captain Ricky Ponting told reporters. ?We were in a bit of trouble but Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey played beautifully.? 

New Zealand?s chances of keeping the series alive were not helped by a horror start from opening bowler Daryl Tuffey, later followed by an injury to opening batsman Michael Papps. 

Tuffey conceded 16 runs off the first over of the match, which took 14 deliveries to complete after four no-balls and four wides. 

Papps was then forced to retire hurt and taken to nearby hospital for precautionary checks after twice being struck on the helmet by Australia?s express paceman Brett Lee. 

?We weren?t good enough as we haven?t been throughout the series,? said New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming. ?They never let us gain any momentum and we were outplayed in all departments.? 

Clarke, named Man of the Match, smashed an unbeaten 71 off 75 balls while Hussey made 65 not out from 73 deliveries as the pair set a one-day record for the sixth wicket for Australia. 

Opener Simon Katich, recalled for the injured Matthew Hayden, gave the innings a flying start with 58 off 78 balls before the Black Caps struck back to reduce the world champions to 128 for five in the 29th over.

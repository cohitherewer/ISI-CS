 Daniel leads in 4 more 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Having trailed in the championship 

table by 14 points to trainer Vijay Singh ? before the start of back-to-back fixtures 

? Daniel David made an amazing recovery on Thursday and Friday. He led in four 

winners on each of the two days, taking his tally to 47 against Vijay?s 54.

 Daniel had a total grip on Friday?s race card and won at will. How else does one justify a heavily backed Silver ?N? Gold winning the Star Precision Cup, and in the hands of a work-jockey like Salim Khan. 

 Daniel pulled off another gamble on Wild Flowers in the Gabarnac Handicap, though apprentice Melvyn Maseyk had to sweat it out to strike after a slow start.

 Jockey Imran Chisty also helped Daniel win two, including the Midnight Cowboy Cup, which was lifted by Senor Pele. Daniel?s former deputy, Errol Bhungard, too, had his share of luck with a rich double scored through Salient Star and Sergeant Slipper.

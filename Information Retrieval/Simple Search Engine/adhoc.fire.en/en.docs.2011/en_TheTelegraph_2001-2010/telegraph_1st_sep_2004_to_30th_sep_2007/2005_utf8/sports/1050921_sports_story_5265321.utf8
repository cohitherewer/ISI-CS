 A lot depends on how Sania practises: Myskina

 - Maybe Im not good enough for Mahesh: Likhovtseva 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After a long wait, the city finally got to witness world No. 12 Anastasia Myskina and No. 16 Elena Likhovtseva in action on Tuesday. The Russians, playing their first-round doubles match at the Sunfeast Open, decimated Indias Bhambri sisters Ankita and Sanaa 6-2, 6-0 before interacting with the media. 

The following are excerpts: 

You started the revolution in Russian tennis when you won the French Open in 2004. But thereafter, you have not been able to maintain that standard. What happened? 

Myskina: Well, it was a long year and the break between seasons was not enough to rejuvenate me. May be I was also not practising hard enough. But after Wimbledon, I think, Im playing much better now. May be its not my best tennis, but I am quite satisfied. 

You just finished playing the Fed Cup final on Sunday. Arent you exhausted after the long journey from Paris? 

Myskina: It is a little tough, yes, but on the circuit you get used to the travelling and I am, honestly, very happy to be here. 

Why did you opt to play in India? 

Myskina: Ive never been to India before but Ive heard so much about the country? So many things that I wanted to see for myself. And so, Im here. 

What do you feel about Sanias game? Do you think she could one day rule womens tennis? 

Myskina: Shes a good player and a star now in India, a role model for aspiring youngsters. This is healthy for tennis and for any other sport. She has a long future ahead. But, of course, a lot depends on how she practices. 

Theres a lot of glamour in womens tennis now. Your opinion? 

Myskina: Its always good if the girls look good while playing well too. It brings a lot more men to watch the games. But playing well is the operative word, for if you dont play well, it hardly matters how you look. 

Do you feel the Russian women are the best tennis players in the world? 

Likhovtseva: Yes, certainly. Last year we won two Grand Slams. This year we have been playing quite well, too. And I believe we are still moving upward and promise to bring even better results in future. 

What is it that makes the Russian women the best in the world? 

Likhovtseva: There is very tough competition among us. That, I believe, helped us to move forward. 

Why is it that you have suddenly improved in the last 2-3 years? 

Likhovtseva: Earlier, during the time of the Perestroika, the training and all other facilities were very different. But things changed drastically. Now, you can get a sponsor if you perform well. It opens up a world of opportunities, where you can travel the globe and earn a very decent living. 

Considering the quality of your game, why is it that you havent managed to go beyond the quarter finals of a Grand Slam? Can it be attributed to big-match nerves? 

Likhovtseva: Maybe sometimes I underestimate myself, maybe the psychological factor becomes too prominent. I also feel the need to work on my backhand. 

You have won a Grand Slam with Mahesh Bhupathi? Your views on him? Do you intend playing with him again? 

Likhovtseva: Hes just great. Hes won two Grand Slams with two different partners this year. I would love to play with him again? (chuckles) but maybe Im not good enough for him anymore. 

What do you think of the facilities here at the Indoor? 

Both: The courts are good and the facilities perfect.

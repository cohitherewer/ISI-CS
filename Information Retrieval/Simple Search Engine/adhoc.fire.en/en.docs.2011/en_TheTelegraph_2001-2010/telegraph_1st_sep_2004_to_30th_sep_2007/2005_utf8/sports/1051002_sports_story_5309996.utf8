The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Ali floored the roughest and toughest

London: Every element illustrating the heroism, fascination and moral ambiguity of prize fighting fused in the incandescent title clash between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in Manila 30 years ago. 

After 14 rounds of unremitting brutality and with the two heavyweights on the verge of collapse, Fraziers corner told their man it was time to quit. 

Fraziers left eye was closed, he could barely see out of his right and nothing he was likely to produce in the final round was going to change the result. 

Ali, slumped in his corner and drenched in sweat, had won the third and most brutal fight against an opponent who forced him to draw on resources his detractors believed he did not possess. 

A year after he astonished the world by vanquishing the fearsome George Foreman, Ali was again king ? indisputably the greatest of his era and possibly of all time ? following victory in the Thriller in Manila. 

Ali later paid a gracious tribute to the man who had forced him to the limit 

Of all the men I fought in boxing, Sonny Liston was the scariest, George Foreman was the most powerful, Floyd Patterson the most skilled. But the roughest and toughest was Joe Frazier. He brought out the best in me and the best fight we fought was in Manila.

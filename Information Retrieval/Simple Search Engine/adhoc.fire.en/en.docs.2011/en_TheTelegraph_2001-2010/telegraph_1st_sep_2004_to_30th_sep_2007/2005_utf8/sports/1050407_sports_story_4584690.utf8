 End in sight for Lehmann

Sydney: Darren Lehmann has conceded his international career is probably over after he was left out of Australia?s 16-man squad to tour England this year. 

The 35-year-old told reporters on Wednesday that while he had not given up hope of a comeback he did not expect to play for Australia again. 

?You only have to read between the lines,? he said. ?I?m disappointed, but that?s the way they (the selectors) decided to go. 

?If I was a selector I would have done the same thing, so I think they?ve made the right choice.? 

Lehmann played 27 Tests for Australia between 1998 and 2004. 

A free-scoring left-hand batsmen, he made 1,798 runs at an average of 44.95 including five centuries and a top score of 177. 

Lehmann also played 117 one-day Internationals. He scored the winning runs in the 1999 World Cup final and also took the winning catch in the 2003 World Cup final. 

Lehmann was promoted to vice-captain for Australia?s Test tour of India last year in the absence of skipper Ricky Ponting but was dropped in January this year after losing form. 

?I?ve had a great time and enjoyed every part of it and I?ve played with a bloody good cricket team,? he said. 

Lehmann said he planned to continue playing first-class cricket and hoped to eventually become a coach.

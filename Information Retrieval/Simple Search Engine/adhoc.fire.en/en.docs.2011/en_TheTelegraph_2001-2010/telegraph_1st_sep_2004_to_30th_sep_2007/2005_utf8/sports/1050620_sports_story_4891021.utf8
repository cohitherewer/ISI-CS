 No nomination for president

Bridgetown: The WICB delayed its annual general meeting to allow more time to receive nominations for the posts of president and vice-president. 

The board was surprised to receive no nominations for either post by Thursdays deadline, prompting it to postpone the meeting from July 17 to August 7. Nominations must be submitted 30 days before the meeting. (AFP)

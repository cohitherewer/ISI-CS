 Pumped-up Hewitt grates his ?C?mons?

 - A Grunting Matilda for an Aussie victory 

MARTIN JOHNSON 

 It?s a noisy game, as far as Hewitt is concerned 

Melbourne: Anyone walking past a tennis player?s locker room and hearing a series of screams, grunts and groans would normally be inclined to ignore it on the assumption that it was only Maria Sharapova rehearsing for her latest match. However, it now appears that it might actually be Lleyton Hewitt getting duffed up by one of his fellow professionals. 

Hewitt appears aware of the possibility himself, given the amount of time he spends pumping iron in the gymnasium, though it?s more a case of his pumping fists ? along with guttural shouts of ?C?mon!? at inappropriate moments ? which is beginning to get up people?s noses. 

A couple of days ago, Brad Gilbert, Andre Agassi?s former coach, said that Hewitt was in danger of getting punched on the nose in the locker room, which is clearly the way they settle things in Australia. After his third-round match with Juan Ignacio Chela, Hewitt?s coach, Roger Rasheed, confronted the Argentine in the players? corridor and told him kindly to refrain from spitting at Lleyton, otherwise he?d ?knock his ****ing block off?. 

Hewitt had already got under the skin of the mild-mannered American James Blake in his previous match, and while Chela?s excuse that his stream of spittle just happened to be travelling in Hewitt?s direction did not, so to speak, hold much water, it only cost him a fine that did not amount to much more than his tournament meal allowance. 

Monday?s fourth-round match against the unseeded Majorcan teenager Rafael Nadal produced an even bigger quota than usual of over-the-top ?C?mons?, which was perhaps not surprising given that Hewitt came dangerously close to defeat before squeezing home in five sets, 7-5, 3-6, 1-6, 7-6, 6-2. And they were all aimed, as usual, at his yellow-shirted band of raucous followers, whose repertoire is so banal that a Martian spacecraft landing on the Rod Laver Arena would have quickly concluded that there was no intelligent life on Earth, and flown off somewhere else. 

It is no great surprise that Hewitt spawns such a following, as Australia are the world No. 1 seeds when it comes to air-headed patriotism, the USA included. Even an American journalist was startled during the Sydney Olympics when a train driver announced that good old Aussie had just won gold in the water polo and the entire carriage burst into a chorus of Waltzing Matilda. 

Monday, as Hewitt strode on to court, the stadium reverberated to a frankly awful rendition of Advance Australia Fair, which may have had something to do with Hewitt immediately losing his serve. Like Don Bradman coming out for his last innings and being bowled for a second-ball duck, the poor lad would have been choked with emotion ? either that or he was in tears at hearing his national anthem being butchered. 

Hewitt and Nadal were clad from head to foot in identical colours, and the only way to tell them apart was that one was wearing his cap back to front and the other was wearing shorts that came down to his shins. They looked like a pair of Fred Perry?s old trousers that had been badly shrunk in the laundry. There was much ?C?moning? from Hewitt though it would have been drowned out in any event by Nadal?s grunting. If he and Sharapova ever get romantically attached and are booked into the honeymoon suite, you?d have to move hotels, never mind floors. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

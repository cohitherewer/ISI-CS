 Sami to get tips from Imran

Rawalpindi: Pakistan great Imran Khan will give fellow fast bowler Mohammed Sami tips to make his bowling action more productive before next months home series against India. 

Sami, 24, has kept his place in the Pakistan squad against England despite a string of disappointing bowling performances which have dogged him since his debut in 2001. 

Sami has taken 65 wickets in 24 Tests at 46.12 and has done slightly better in one-dayers, capturing 104 wickets in 73 matches at 28.28. 

Imran had invited some of the players for lunch and he is very concerned that Sami has not fulfilled his potential as yet, skipper Inzamam-ul Haq said. Imran has said that when we have our training camp for the Indian series he will come down and work with Sami to see what is the problem holding him back, he said. (Reuters)

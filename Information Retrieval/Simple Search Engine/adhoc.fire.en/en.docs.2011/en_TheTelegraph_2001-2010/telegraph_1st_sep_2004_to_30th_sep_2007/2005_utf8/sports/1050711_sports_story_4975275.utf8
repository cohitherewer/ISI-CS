 Harikrishna in 3-way lead

 - CHINA GMs MEET 

Taiyuan (China): World junior cha-mpion P. Harikrishna started off with a facile victory over Gran-dmaster Zhang Pe-ngxiang of China in the first round of the Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters chess tournament underway h-ere from Sunday. 

After the first round of the 12-player round robin event, Tigran Petrosian of Armenia and Dubai Open champion Wang Hao of China emerged as joint leader along with Harikrishna with a perfect score. 

Interestingly, all the three first-round winners had black pieces. While Petrosian capitalised on a blunder by worlds youngest ever GM, Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine to open his account, Hao skilfully outplayed compatriot Zhoe Xue. 

Two of the remaining games in the first round of this cateogry-15 meet ended in dra-ws, while the game between former Russian champion Alexander Motylev and Ni Hua of China was postponed till the only rest day on July 17. 

Harikrishna played a fine positional game to outclass Pengxiang. Playing the black side of a Berlin Defence, Hari-krishna was surprised in the opening as Pengxiang shied away from main lines.

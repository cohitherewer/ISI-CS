London: French Open champion Rafael Nadals lack of familiarity with the slick Wimbledon grass caught up with him on Thursday in a demoralising second-round defeat by a debutant from Luxembourg. 

Sixth seed Tim Henman had no such excuse. 

The 30-year-old Briton, four-times a losing semi-finalist, lost 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-8 to Russian Dmitry Tursunov on Centre Court to end his increasingly forlorn hope of becoming Britains first mens champion since 1936. 

Womens defending champion Maria Sharapova overwhelmed Bulgarian 15-year-old Sesil Karatantcheva 6-0, 6-1 while another teenager, Frances Richard Gasquet, also swept through to the third round. 

Nadals claycourt expertise counted for little on a slick Court One against Gilles Muller, the world number 69, who only won his first round match after opponent Felix Mantilla retired injured. 

Slipping and sliding on the unfamiliar grass, the flamboyant 19-year-old succumbed 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. 

Henman had to recover from two sets down to win his first round match, an indication that he was nowhere near peak form for his biggest tournament of the year. 

On Thursday 22-year-old Tursunov, ranked 152, proved a calm and resilient opponent who admirably kept his head after squandering several match points and despite having few supporters in a raucous Centre Court crowd. 

Its disappointing, its tough to take but youve got to give him a lot of credit, Henman said. I certainly didnt play badly today. 

White-hot Russian Sharapova turned Karatantchevas day in the sun into a nightmare that she will want quickly to forget with a ruthless display of baselining. 

The chastened Bulgarians sole consolation was that by winning the 10th game she avoided suffering the tournaments first whitewash. 

The two are not exactly the best of friends and Sharapova had little sympathy for her humiliated opponent. 

I just played great tennis today, said the 18-year-old. 

Its hard to feel sorry for your opponents. Unfortunately, this is an individual sport. 

Gasquet, who won the pre-Wimbledon grasscourt tournament in Nottingham, will face Nadals conqueror Muller in round three after beating Belgian qualifier Gilles Elseneer 7-6, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2. 

The Beziers-born slugger is loathe to raise any false hopes of winning his first Grand Slam, however. 

I have to play another five matches, said the 19-year-old. Its too difficult for me now. But I think I can go far. I dont know when I will lose, but I think I can play a good tournament. 

An old-timer by comparison, 25-year-old twice former champion Venus Williams moved serenely through to third round with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Australian Nicole Pratt. 

Venus, the 14th seed, is still on course for a fourth round showdown with younger sister Serena. 

Spains 1994 champion Conchita Martinez showed she is still going strong at 33 with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Kristina Brandi of Puerto Rico. 

Greeces Eleni Daniilidou, the first-round conqueror of French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne, made light work of American Laura Granville, winning 6-2, 6-0. 

However British interest in the womens singles ended with the 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Jane Donoghue by French 16th seed Nathalie Dechy. 

Promising 18-year-old Andrew Murray is their last remaining hope in the mens singles. He was due to play Czech 14th seed Radek Stepanek later on Thursday.

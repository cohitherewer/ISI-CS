 Atwal makes the cut

Norton (Massachusetts): Arjun Atwal knocked in five birdies and an eagle and bring home a card of two-under 69 to move to tied 41st and make the cut at the $5.5 million Deutsche Bank Championship on Saturday. 

The Indian was three-under 139 after two days. The cut was applied at 141. 

Olin Browne and Jeff Brehaut, meanwhile, grabbed a share of the lead, while world No. 1 Tiger Woods struggled. 

Browne, who has not won a PGA Tour event since 1999, hit seven birdies in his first 10 holes en route to a six-under-par 65 that helped him tie Brehaut on nine-under 133 at the Tournament Players Club of Boston. 

Brehaut, who is 67th on the money list, made an eagle on the second hole and birdied the 12th, 15th and 18th as he fired a 66. 

Woods, who started the day one stroke ahead of the field after an opening 65, struggled with his driver and left a number of putts short as he carded a two-over 73 for a four under 138.

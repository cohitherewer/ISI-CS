 Warne doubtful for second Test

Sydney: Shane Warne is in doubt for Australias second Test against the West Indies starting in Hobart on Thursday because of back pain. 

Pacer Stuart Clark joined the squad on Wednesday as a precaution although he is unlikely to play even if Warne, acclaimed as the greatest spin bowler of all time, were to be ruled out. 

A Cricket Australia spokesman said that Warne had never suffered back pain before but received some treatment after experiencing some problems at training. However, Brad Hodge makes his long-awaited Test debut for Australia while Andrew Symonds is recalled for the first time since March last year. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he would not finalise his starting XI until just before the toss but confirmed that both Hodge and allrounder Symonds would play. 

Hodge was called into the squad when middle order batsman Simon Katich was dropped after Australias 379-run win in the first Test in Brisbane. 

Symonds was recalled for just his third Test after Shane Watson dislocated his shoulder in Brisbane, ruling him out for the rest of the summer. 

Australias decision to include both Hodge and Symonds in the side means either leg-spinner Stuart MacGill or left-arm paceman Nathan Bracken will serve as 12th man. 

The West Indies also delayed naming their team until the morning of the match but changes are expected after their thrashing in Brisbane.

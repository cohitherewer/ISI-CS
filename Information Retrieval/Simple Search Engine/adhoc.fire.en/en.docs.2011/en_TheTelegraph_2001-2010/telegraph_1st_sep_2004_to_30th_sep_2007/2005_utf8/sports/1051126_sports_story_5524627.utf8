Calcutta: Graeme Smith doesnt support the Indias policy of experimentation with the batting order. 

The Indians have changed their batting order in the all the three games so far. Its been a mix-and-match policy. I think they need a bit of stability in the order, said the South African captain at the post-match press conference at the Eden on Thursday. 

When sending non-batters upfront, you always have the risk of losing two or three wickets early on. It also puts the normal batsmen under pressure. In India, though you can afford to take such risks, Smith explained. But he did not wish to deal too much into it. The main thing is to keep things within our control, he remarked. 

Smith was all praise for Shaun Pollock. Losing Makhaya Ntini wasnt great for us. He was vomiting in the morning and we decided to rest him. Pollock was just great... At times you need the senior players to step in on big days. 

The good thing was that even when Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif forged the partnership, we managed to keep going. 

We tried a few different things in bowling and it worked for us, said the South African captain. 

He, however, admitted that chasing 189 was below expectations. We thought we would have to chase something around 250 this evening. Our strength was our quick bowlers and Im happy some of our support bowlers chipped in admirably too, added Smith. 

He also praised the wicket. It was a very good wicket... True seam and bounce. When you bowled quicker, the ball came onto the bat nicely. I think getting 280 was possible if the team batting first batted well. 

We had certain gameplans today and concentrated on our own game. 

We created chances and held them. We didnt drop the catches as well. It will be hugely satisfying if we can win in Mumbai as well, concluded Smith.

 All-round show by Pathan

London: Irfan Pathan made a promising start to his maiden county stint as he scored a crafty 41 and then took two quick wickets for Middlesex in the four-day match against Sussex at Hove on Thursday. 

Pathan, who signed with Middlesex as a replacement for the injured South African paceman Nanty Haywards, came in to bat with his team at 290 for seven and built partnerships of 33 and 45 runs, respectively, with P.N. Weeks (55) and M.M. Betts (36 not out) to take the team to 401 in their first innings. 

The left arm paceman then claimed two for 21 to leave Sussex struggling at 41 for three at lunch on Day II.

 Newcastle aim to stub controversy 

 Shearer holds the key to Newcastle?s success 

London: Newcastle United manager Graeme Souness must decide whether to drop midfielders Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer for Thursday?s Uefa Cup quarter final first leg tie against Sporting Lisbon. 

The pair were involved in an on-field fight on Saturday, for which both were red-carded and Bowyer fined six weeks? wages. 

In addition to their Uefa Cup progress, Newcastle have reached the FA Cup semi-finals, where they face Manchester United on April 17, and Saturday?s 0-3 home defeat to Aston Villa was their first loss in 13 games. 

But Souness is determined his side will concentrate on football when they welcome Sporting to St James? Park this week. The club will bank heavily on captain Alan Shearer, who scored 10 goals in seven Uefa Cup matches this season. 

In-form Villarreal will be without ineligible top scorer Diego Forlan for Thursday?s home leg against Dutch side AZ Alkmaar. (Reuters)

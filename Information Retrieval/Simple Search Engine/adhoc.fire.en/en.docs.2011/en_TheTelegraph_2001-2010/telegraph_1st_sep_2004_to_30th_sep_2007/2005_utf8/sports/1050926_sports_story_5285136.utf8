 High winds trouble Atwal

San Antonio: Arjun Atwal had a troublesome time battling high winds as he shot a four-over 74 to drop from tied 23rd to tied 53rd on the third day of the Valero Texas Open Golf Championship. 

Atwal struggled to find his rhythm on a day when Texas heaved a sigh of relief as Hurricane Rita spared Houston on its route of destruction. 

Scoring was tough since temperatures were around 100 degrees Fahrenheit and winds were blowing at over 30 miles per hour. 

Things did look bright early in the day as Atwal opened with a birdie on the first. 

He, however, lost that advantage with a bogey on the next hole but a birdie on fourth again raised hopes of a decent round. 

His woes began with seventh, when he bogeyed the par-four holes and dropped one more on the next. Yet another shot was dropped on 11th and a further three bogeys in a row from 14th to 16th saw him come to five-over, before a consolation birdie ended his agony. 

It was Woody Austin who took the third-round lead with a 3-under 67. Austin, 41, rolled in a four-foot birdie on the 18th hole to finish at 13-under 197.

 Sachin can touch 50 mark: Woolmer

Lahore: A day after former England captain Graham Gooch told The Telegraph that Sachin Tendulkar can go on to score 50 Test centuries, a similar view was aired from across the border by Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer. 

It is a wonderful achievement to get the highest number of Test hundreds (35) and the way he is playing he can go on to achieve the magic 50 mark also. He is that good a player, Woolmer said on Sunday. 

The maestro is due to tour Pakistan early next year to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq feels Sachin is destined to break many more records. He has been enjoying his cricket since coming back from injury and he deserves this record, Inzamam said. 

Sachin debuted in November 1989 against Pakistan at Karachi and was bowled by Waqar Younis for 15. Waqar himself was making his debut in that match. 

From the moment we saw him, we knew he was an exceptional talent and he has gone on to prove that beyond doubt, Waqar said. 

Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja, who played in that Test, said: Its not surprising that he has got 35 hundreds now. I wouldnt be surprised if he ends with the highest number of Test runs scored also. 

Meanwhile, former India leg-spinner Laxman Sivaramakrishnan feels what sets Sachin apart from the rest is the amount of homework that he does before going into the middle, adds another report from New Delhi. 

Sachins success has to do with the kind of focus and concentration he has maintained throughout his career. Sivaramakrishnan said. (AGENCIES)

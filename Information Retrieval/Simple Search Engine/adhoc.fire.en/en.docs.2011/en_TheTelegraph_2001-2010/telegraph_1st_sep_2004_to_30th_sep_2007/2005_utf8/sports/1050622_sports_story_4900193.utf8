 Parreira ready to gamble vs Japan 

 - Ronaldinho, Kaka may be rested in crucial tie 

Nuremberg: Carlos Alberto Parreira will take a calculated risk by naming a much-changed Brazil team to play for their Confederations Cup future against Japan on Wednesday. 

Brazils surprise 0-1 defeat by Mexico in group B means the world champions will be on their way home if they lose against Japan in Cologne. 

That would be all the more embarrassing given that Japan are coached by Zico, one of Brazils greatest former players, but Parreira is still preparing to gamble by dropping up to four of his first-choice players. 

Among those to make way could be Ronaldinho and Kaka, the two most creative players in the squad. But Parreira is determined to live with the inevitable criticism should things go wrong. If we were in the World Cup and playing for our future that would be different. But wed planned all along to make changes for the third game and thats what were going to do, Parreira said. 

Ill take responsibility for that. There will probably be three or four new players in the team. 

We want to win and go through. This is an important tournament, with all the continental champions, but above all its a test ahead of the World Cup. 

Asked about Ronaldinho and Kaka, Parreira hinted that one or both could be rested ahead of a possible semi-final. 

Both have had tiring seasons in Europe and we may try and ensure that theyre fresh for the next game, the coach said. 

Juninho Pernambucano, who scored with a spectacular free-kick in the 3-0 win over Greece, would be first in the queue to come into the midfield. 

Zicos Japan showed in their 1-0 win over European champions Greece that they are well capable of causing Brazil problems ? if only they can improve in front of goal. 

With Hidetoshi Nakata and Shunsuke Nakamura in effervescent form, they made the Greece midfield dizzy only for the starting forwards to miss the countless chances they created. 

Our main problem is taking chances and obviously we have to improve, said Nakata. 

Zico believes his forwards have a mental block in front of goal but he remains confident his team can cause a big upset on Wednesday and get the win they need to qualify for the semi-finals alongside Mexico. 

The important thing is to retain the sprit and the belief that we can do it, the coach said. Brazil are always Brazil but Im now the coach of Japan and I want to help them to win.

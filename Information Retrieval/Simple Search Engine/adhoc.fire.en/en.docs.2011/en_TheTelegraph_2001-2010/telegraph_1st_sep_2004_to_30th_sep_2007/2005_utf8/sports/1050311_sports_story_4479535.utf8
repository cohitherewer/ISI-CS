 Aussies press on to join AFC

Sydney: Australia are pressing ahead with efforts to join the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in a switch from the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), the Football Federation Australia (FFA) said on Thursday. 

Japan football association vice-president Junji Ogura, a member of Fifa?s executive committee, said the world governing body had received a request from the Australian federation for permission to switch to the AFC. 

The FFA on Thursday confirmed that it had been in talks with Fifa since late last year and also with the AFC in Kuala Lumpur and Zurich with a view to exploring the opportunity for the FFA to switch from the tiny OFC grouping of largely Pacific islands. 

?For some time now, the FFA has had an objective to join AFC,? FFA chairman Frank Lowy said in a statement on Thursday. ?Our current affiliation leaves Australia in an anomalous situation in a football sense. It is encouraging that the three key football organisations, Fifa, AFC and OFC, have now progressed their deliberations on the subject. 

FFA chief executive John O?Neill said the move would revolutionise domestic football. ?It will go a long way towards transforming football in Australia, as we move from a domestic environment into an exciting, dynamic, regional one.?O?Neill said. (AFP)

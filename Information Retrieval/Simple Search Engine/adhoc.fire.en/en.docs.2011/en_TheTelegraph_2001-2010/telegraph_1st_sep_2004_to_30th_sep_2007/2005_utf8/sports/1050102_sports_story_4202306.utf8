London: Chelsea, boosted by a slice of good fortune for substitute Joe Cole?s winner, continued their surge towards a first Premier League title with a battling 1-0 victory at Liverpool on Saturday. 

The England midfielder?s low drive from distance deflected in off Jamie Carragher 10 minutes from time to hand Jose Mourinho?s side their third win in the hectic holiday programme and a perfect start to their centenary year. 

Cole, scoring for the second successive game, had hit the winner in Chelsea?s 1-0 victory over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in October. 

On as a 76th-minute replacement for Damien Duff, Cole was well positioned to latch on to Glen Johnson?s cushioned header from Arjen Robben?s corner. The deflection off Carragher wrong-footed Jerzy Dudek and flew in. 

Mourinho praised his side?s defensive qualities but admitted his side, who are unbeaten in their last 12, had not been at their best at Anfield. 

?It was a fantastic defensive performance, not just by the team but by some individuals. We were a bit lucky,? he said.

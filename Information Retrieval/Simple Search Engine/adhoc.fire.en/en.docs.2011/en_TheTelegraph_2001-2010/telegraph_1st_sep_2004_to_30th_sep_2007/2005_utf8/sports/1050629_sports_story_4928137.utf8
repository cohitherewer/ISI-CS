 Smooth Federer gathering momentum

[+uc('Mark Hodgkinson at Wimbledon 

The Daily Telegraph')+]

There was a double sense of satisfaction for Roger Federer at the All England Club Monday night as he made smooth progress into the quarter finals and suggested that he was slowly increasing the quality and intensity of his tennis. 

Federer, who is attempting to win his third successive Wimbledon title, had not looked convincing in the opening rounds, but he was striking the ball with real poise and power during his straight-set victory over Juan Carlos Ferrero. 

The Swiss world No. 1 never looked threatened by Ferrero, a Spaniard who looks more at home playing on a clay court than on the grass of Centre Court. The only real moment of angst for Federer came as he served for the third set at 6-5 and was broken to 15 as he flunked a volley wide of the line. But he held his nerve in the tie-break, playing the shots when it really mattered during this high-quality encounter, to complete a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 victory that extended his unbeaten run on grass to 33 matches. 

Federer will now play Fernando Gonzalez, a Chilean who hits the ball with some clout, but since the draw was made the top half has been building towards a likely semi-final meeting between the defending champion and Lleyton Hewitt. 

The Australian third seed, the only other former champion in the draw, will play Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, the surprise quarter-finalist. Hewitt had been in such a calm and composed mood in his opening matches, with the tennis and his mindset as low key as you will ever see from the tours most competitive player, but he worked himself into one of his frenzies during his four-set victory over American Taylor Dent. 

Hewitt failed to convert two match points in the third-set tie-break, but regrouped in the fourth set for a 6-4, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 victory. The match was not without its controversies. Hewitt repeatedly complained about the line calls, so much so that Dent afterwards accused him of gamesmanship and bitching. 

Dent suggested that the officials may have been intimidated by the constant arguing from Hewitt, and said that the umpire made only one over-rule after Hewitts complaints. The umpire didnt change his call until after Hewitt started complaining about the call. His personality may intimidate the officials. Hes fired up and he is yelling. I dont know what he said to one of the linesmen out there but I did hear the crowd react to that. Thats intimidating. But if I was a linesman, I would make the calls a little rougher on Hewitt, Dent said. 

Hewitt denied that he could have influenced the decision-making of the officials. I dont think it puts pressure on umpires, its not a factor. I only questioned a couple of calls today. Taylor questioned calls today as well, he said.

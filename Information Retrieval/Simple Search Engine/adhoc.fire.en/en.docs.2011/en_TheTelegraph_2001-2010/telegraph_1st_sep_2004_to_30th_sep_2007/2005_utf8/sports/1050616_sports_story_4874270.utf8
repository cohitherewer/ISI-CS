 Powell feat an IAAF gain too

 - Jamaican takes advantage of ideal sprinting conditions to record 9.77

On the track where he suffered his only defeat over the distance last season, in the Olympic final, Asafa Powell broke the 100 metres world record on Tuesday night. In so doing he took the record away from Tim Montgomery before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rules whether he should have lost it anyway. Powell, a 6ft 4in Jamaican, took advantage of ideal sprinting conditions in the Athens Olympic stadium to record 9.77sec. 

Powell was unable to launch himself immediately into an unreserved celebration because he was not sure what to celebrate. The track-side clock showed 9.78sec, equal to Montgomerys mark, set in 2002, but, after his semi-final time had been rounded down by officials from 9.99 to 9.98, he had reason to hope. Sure enough, some five minutes later, his time was announced as the fastest legitimate run in history. 

After failing to reach the semi-finals of the 2003 World Championships in Paris, Powell put together an impressive string of races leading up to the Olympics last summer, including the fastest time seen on British soil, winning the London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace in 9.91. Quietly spoken, and with none of the showmanship of world record-holders before him, such as Maurice Greene, Powell has come of age at 22. 

In Paris he was the other man in the controversial quarter-final incident in which Jon Drummond, of the United States, laid down in protest on the track after his disqualification for a false start. Powell, too, was disqualified for beating the gun but took his dismissal with relative equanimity. Twelve months later, in the Olympics, he buckled under the strain of being the favourite, finishing fifth. 

Nothing makes up for the Olympics but this shows the world I could have done it, Powell said. 

Almost a year on from the Olympics, the local appetite for athletics has been lost. There were so few spectators in the stadium that they could hardly be described as a crowd. But everything else was in place: the air was warm, the tailwind of 1.6 metres per second legal and the track quick. Powells was the second 100 metres world record in the stadium, Greene having recorded 9.79 in 1999. 

That the track was conducive to fast times was underlined when four men broke 9.90 in the Olympic final. Sensing that the time and place were right for him now ? he ran 9.85 in rainy Ostrava last Thursday ? Powell travelled to Athens early to train in the stadium. 

Assuming that Powell passes the mandatory drugs test, the inclusion of his name in the world-record books, at the expense of Montgomerys, will be welcomed by the hierarchy at the IAAF, which is weary of sprintings doping image. Montgomery, of the US, appeared before the CAS last week in connection with alleged drugs violations. 

The result of the hearing is due any day and, if found guilty, Montgomerys 9.78 would be expunged. 

While the Powell family has celebrated the sprinting successes of two brothers ? Donovan Powell reached the final of the 1999 World Indoor Championships 60 metres ? it has also had to mourn the death of two more. One was shot dead in 2002 and another died from natural causes the same year. As an athlete, Asafa was a late developer. 

Five years ago, he was playing football and had never contested a 100 metres. I was a centre forward, scoring plenty of goals, he recalled. Up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Powells interest in athletics was peripheral. He would watch the 100 metres because it was his brothers event, but not much else. I was interested in the 100 metres, but not in all track and field, he said.

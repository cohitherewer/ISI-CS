 Ronaldo brace in Real victory

Madrid: Ronaldinho inspired Barcelona to a 2-0 win over Getafe at the Nou Camp to match Real Madrid?s earlier victory over Levante as the Catalans remained six points clear at the top of the Primera Liga Sunday. 

The Brazilian World Player of the Year settled his side?s nerves when he scored with a curling free-kick on the half hour and then provided a brilliant assist for Ludovic Giuly to add a second soon after the break. 

The victory allowed Barca to maintain their advantage over second-placed Real with just six games left to play. 

Earlier Real, who beat Barcelona 4-2 at the Bernabeu last weekend, had heaped pressure on their arch-rivals when a Ronaldo double gave them a 2-0 win at Bernd Schuster?s Levante. 

The Brazilian grabbed his first by smashing in from six metres shortly before half-time and took his season total to 15 with a superb solo effort in the closing minutes. 

Barcelona are top on 72 points, Real have 66 and Sevilla, who lost 0-1 at home to Osasuna on Saturday, are a distant third on 52, level with Villarreal who drew 0-0 at home to fellow high-flyers Real Betis. 

Frank Rijkaard?s side poured forward from the first whistle against Getafe but although they peppered the visitors? goal with a succession of shots they had to wait for a set-piece before they were able to take the lead. 

Ronaldinho stepped up to take a free-kick a metre outside the area and fooled goalkeeper Francisco Sanchez Broto when he curled his shot round the wall and into the corner. 

The Getafe keeper did well to stop Barca extending their lead just before the break when he tipped a Giovanni van Bronckhorst shot over the bar but he had little chance of preventing Barcelona?s second goal just after the break. 

Ronaldinho unlocked the Getafe defence once more when he slipped a disguised pass into the path of Giuly who then dinked the ball neatly over the keeper and into the net. 

Real were given a tough time by Levante in the opening minutes in Valencia and former player Alberto Rivera was denied a goal by a spectacular one-handed save from Iker Casillas when his shot ballooned off a defender towards top corner. 

Although Levante put together some neat passing moves in the centre of midfield, Real needed just one more opportunity to snatch the lead. 

Full back Michel Salgado burst down the right, cut inside to the area and fired in a cross to Ronaldo who pulled away from his marker before swinging a firm right-foot shot past Mora. 

Casillas then produced a sharp block to stop a fierce drive from defender Pablo Pinillos and made a brilliant recovery to get his hand to a goal-bound shot from Vladimir Manchev after the Bulgarian striker appeared to have skipped round him at the near post. 

Meanwhile, Juventus moved three points clear at the top of Serie A after rivals AC Milan fell to a shock 1-2 defeat at lowly Siena on Sunday. 

Juventus put their Champions League exit at the hands of Liverpool in midweek behind them as a Zlatan Ibrahimovic hattrick helped Fabio Capello?s side to a 5-2 triumph over Lecce at the Delle Alpi stadium. 

A header by Siena?s Francesco Cozza four minutes from time delivered Milan?s first league defeat since January. 

Juventus have 70 points with AC Milan on 67 and third-placed Inter Milan, who beat Cagliari 2-0, are 11 points behind their city rivals. Juventus play Inter in Turin on Wednesday. 

At the foot of the table, Fiorentina fell into the relegation zone as a 0-2 defeat at Livorno led their travelling supporters to call for the sacking of coach Dino Zoff. 

After 13 Serie A and European matches without a loss Milan, who face PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League semi-finals, were brought down to earth with a result that could prove vital in a tight two-horse title race. 

Milan had an effort from Andriy Shevchenko ruled out in the first half but went ahead in the 63rd minute through Argentine Hernan Crespo, who drove through the legs of Siena goalkeeper Alex Manninger at the near post. 

But Siena drew level in the 71st when former Italy striker Enrico Chiesa struck the post but reacted quickly to fire the rebound goalwards and Rui Costa?s desperate attempt to clear on the line flew in off the post. 

Milan poured forward in search of a winner but were caught out on the break when Giovanni Pasquale burst down the left flank and picked out Cozza who headed home at the back post. (Reuters)

 McEnroe to play after 15 years

London: Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe will return to the ATP tour in February after a 15-year absence to play doubles in the San Jose tournament. 

McEnroe, who retired from the Tour in 1992 with a record combined haul of 77 singles and 77 doubles titles, will celebrate his 47th birthday during the February 13-19 tournament in California. 

The American will team up with 33-year-old Swede Jonas Bjorkman, won has won eight Grand Slam doubles titles and 42 altogether. We are coming to play San Jose for one reason, to win the SAP Open doubles title, said McEnroe, who has kept fit playing in seniors and exhibition tournaments while also working as a television pundit. 

Jonas and I are not doing this just for fun. We think that this will be great for the game of tennis and we both look forward to returning to play in the Bay Area, he was quoted as saying on the ATP Tour website

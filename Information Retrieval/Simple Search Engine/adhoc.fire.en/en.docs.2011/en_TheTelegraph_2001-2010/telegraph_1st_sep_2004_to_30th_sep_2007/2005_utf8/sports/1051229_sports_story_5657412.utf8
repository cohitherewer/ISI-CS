 I play best when I act on instinct: Symonds

Melbourne: Australia allrounder Andrew Symonds hopes the confidence he gained from taking three wickets against South Africa will help him return to form with the bat. 

Symonds, under pressure to hold down the allrounders spot in the Australian side after a lean run, scythed through the touring sides middle order by taking three wickets for six runs in 19 balls. 

His career-best return of three for 50 on Wednesday ensured Australia took a 44-run lead on first innings. 

Theres still a long way to go in the game, Symonds said.Theres a lot to do and Ill probably have to bat again as well so hopefully I can get some confidence off my bowling ...and that will flow into my batting. 

As a cricketer, you try to draw on anything when things arent going well and look for some sort of positive vibes and feedback for yourself. If thats what I feed off tomorrow then Ill take it. 

Hopefully I wont have the nerves when I walk out there tomorrow and I can step into the first half volley and whack it down the ground for four. 

I play my best cricket when Im not thinking about it and am acting on instinct. 

Thats what Ive got to do tomorrow when I get out there. I have to trust myself and be instinctive. 

Symonds, who bludgeoned 156 against New Zealand in a one-day game this month and averages almost 38 in the shortened version of the game, has scored just 101 runs in nine Test knocks and was out first ball in the first innings. 

It really helps when you first start any career, either one-day or Test cricket to get a really good score or two and it just launches you off, Symonds said. Ive been searching for that a bit and Ive gone through a period where I was really nervous before I batted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav may open with Gayle for MCC

 - LORDS TSUNAMI TIE - Harbhajan replaces Murali 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Captain Stephen Fleming couldnt make it to the MCC XI nets at Lords on Monday morning, but manager Mike Gatting was around to ensure the Sourav Gangulys trained with at least a degree of seriousness. 

Tuesdays limited overs match against an International XI is charity-driven (and doesnt have official status), but Gatting has always had the reputation of a taskmaster. 

It was, by the way, under his captaincy that England last won the Ashes, in 1986-87. 

Stephen had a game for Nottinghamshire yesterday and, so, will be reaching London later in the day. In fact, even Shoaib (Akhtar) couldnt make it for nets as he, too, played on Sunday, Gatting told The Telegraph. 

He added: Quite a few of the players in both teams had County commitments yesterday or on Saturday and, so, didnt come for nets? Whats important is that theyve made themselves available for a wonderful cause. 

Yes, but irrespective of the status, nobody would like to fail in a match of such high billing. 

Gatting informed Sourav is either going to open with Chris Gayle or bat at No. 3 if Fleming decides to himself take on Makhaya Ntini and his tribe straightaway. 

I can understand jockeying for certain positions, but its Stephens prerogative to decide the batting order, Gatting pointed out. 

 THE BENEFICIARIES

 Leonard Cheshire Foundation, 

 headquartered in the UK

 British Red Cross

 Foundation of Goodness (supported, among others, 

 by Shane Warne and 

 Muttiah Muralidharan)

 Sarvodaya, a leading NGO in Sri Lanka

 Cricket-Aid Sri Lanka

The regular Team India captain has come in for Ramnaresh Sarwan, who had problems travelling from the West Indies. 

That the MCC wanted Sourav, who is on a short-term contract with Glamorgan, was first reported in these columns last Saturday. 

Significantly, the number of Indians who will be on view in the MCC-organised fund-raiser has increased to six with Harbhajan Singh (doing duty for Surrey) being named Muttiah Muralidharans replacement. 

An injury made Murali pull out ? unfortunate given that the earnings have been earmarked for five organisations either exclusively/closely connected with tsunami relief operations in Sri Lanka. 

Incidentally, according to MCC spokesperson Laura Garland, Rahul Dravid is going to keep for the International XI. 

She couldnt put a figure on the amount expected to be raised, but said only 3,000 tickets remained to be sold till late on Monday. 

The 50 overs per team game will be telecast live on Sky.

 Afridi fires Pakistan to huge total

Gros Islet: Shahid Afridi smashed a sparkling 56 as Pakistan piled up an imposing total of 303 for six in the third ODI against the West Indies in St Lucia on Sunday. 

Afridi faced just 30 balls, hitting six fours and two sixes in his 26th one-day half century as Pakistan made the West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul rue his decision to put the tourists into bat. 

After Afridis fireworks, Yasir Hameed (41), Bazid Khan (66), Yousuf Youhana (50) and Younis Khan (40) batted well to give their team a strong chance of completing a clean sweep of the three-match series. 

Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal smashed the last three balls of the innings from left-arm seamer Ian Bradshaw for six to finish with 24 from just nine balls.

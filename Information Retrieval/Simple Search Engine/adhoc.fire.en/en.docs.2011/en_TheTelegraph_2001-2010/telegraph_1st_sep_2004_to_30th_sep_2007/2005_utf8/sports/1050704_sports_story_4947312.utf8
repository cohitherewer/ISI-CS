 Resurgent Spain crush India

 - WORLD JUNIOR HOCKEY 

Rotterdam: India went into a tailspin and were crushed 0-4 by a resurgent Spain in their opening group E match of the Rabobank junior world cup hockey meet here on Sunday. 

Looking a shadow of the team that beat The Netherlands 4-1 last night, the Indians paid the price for lack of teamgame and glaring defensive errors that the crafty Spaniards exploited to the hilt. 

Skipper David Alegre did the star turn for Spain, whose performance in the preliminary league barely did justice to their No.1 ranking in the meet. Alegre first converted a fourth minute penalty stroke that followed a stick-check offence by Dhananjay Mahadik to put Spain ahead 1-0. 

Past the 45th, Alegre capped a right-wing counter-attack with a stunning reverse hit to the boards. In between, Sergio Enrique picked up a rebound from a penalty corner in the 28th for the second goal. 

Later, Juan Lainz flicked home a pass from Hector Martinez, who had broken through from the right, past a jittery Sandeep Singh in the 57th minute. 

It was Indias first defeat in four matches after having come through the preliminary league with an unbeaten record. But against Spain, the Indians hardly put a foot right. 

Indias deep defence left far too many gaps owing to poor marking while there was little co-ordination between the half-backs and the forwards, almost all of whom were guilty of playing an individual game. 

In the event, India were as much responsible for their heavy loss as Spains one-touch game that saw them outflank the rivals with a series of long and accurate passes. 

Spain thus avenged their 2-3 loss to India in the last months four-nation tournament at Bilbao. 

Earlier, in pool F, Pakistan slipped to a 0-2 defeat against Germany who scored once on either side of the break through Thilo Stralkowski (26th) and Sebastian Draguhn (55th). 

The Pakistanis were distinctly off-colour and as in their previous matches, struggled to put together an effective combination. The Germans played a waiting game and when the chances came their way, capitalised. 

Meanwhile, an inspired Malaysia forced a 3-3 draw with fancied Australia, also in pool F, thanks to a hattrick by their penalty corner specialist Zulfiki Mohammed Rejab (6th, 45th, 63rd).

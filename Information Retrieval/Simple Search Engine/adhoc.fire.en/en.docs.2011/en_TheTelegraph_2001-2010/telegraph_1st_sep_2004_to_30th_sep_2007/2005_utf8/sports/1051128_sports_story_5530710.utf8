The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pal asked to show cause for poor performance

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan have showcaused custodian Subrata Pal for the 1-4 humiliation on Sunday. 

Blaming Pal squarely for the debacle against the arch-rivals, club secretary Anjan Mitra said he has been asked to reply within 15 days. 

Our contract (with the goalie) clearly mentions that Pal has to give his hundred per cent. Within the next 15 days, he must specify why he failed to do so. He has been asked not to join practice till the club decides otherwise. His performance today was shameful and has brought the club into disrepute, Mitra said. 

Mitras announcement came within hours of Duttas declaration (during the post-match media conference) that some of Pals actions during the match were funny. 

The Mohun Bagan coach held the goalkeeper responsible for all but one goal conceded by the green-and-maroons and stopped short of levelling charges of being bribed at him. 

The way Pal committed school-boyish errors had to be seen to be believed, Dutta said, adding: Specifically, he had no business throwing the ball at an advancing Alvito. In any case, Alvito was coming through the middle, and he should have thrown the ball at the flanks. 

During the half-time, I told him to come out of the goalline during corner kicks ? a basic rule. But to my amazement, he stood rooted to the spot on many occasions. Very fishy, thundered Dutta. 

On his poor performance in Santosh Trophy, Subrata had said he was tired after a long train journey, but how does he explain todays result? a visibly irritated Dutta said.

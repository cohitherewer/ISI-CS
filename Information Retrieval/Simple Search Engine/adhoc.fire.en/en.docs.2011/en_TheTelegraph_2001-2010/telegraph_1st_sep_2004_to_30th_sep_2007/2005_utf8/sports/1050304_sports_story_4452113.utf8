 Pak falter on Day I

 - Youhana falls to Paul 

Dharamshala: Pakistan had an unceremonious start to their tour of India as a middle-order collapse undid a fluent start against Board President?s XI on the opening day of the three-day warm-up match at the HPCA Stadium here Thursday. 

At stumps, the visitors were 165 for five, despite a half-century opening stand and another equally enterprising middle-order partnership between captain Inzamam-ul Haq and Asim Kamal. 

Inzamam?s 35th birthday celebrations were spoilt to a large extent by some indiscretion on his own part besides some penetrative bowling and agile fielding by the Board XI players. At stumps, Kamal was batting on 43 with Abdul Razzaq on two. 

Taufeeq Umar (37) and Salman Butt (21) gave the tourists a solid start before two quick dismissals pegged them back. 

The Pakistani opening pair helped the team quickly get off the blocks after bad light and drizzle had robbed nearly three hours of play. 

Butt and Umar put on 54 for the opening stand before the former was run out for 21 after Pakistan elected to bat. 

The hosts, however, made regular inroads to put themselves in a comfortable position at the end of the day. 

Butt and Umar were in excellent touch as they drove Rudra Pratap Singh and Gagandeep Singh effortlessly. 

The scoring rate had reached alarming levels when host captain Mohammed Kaif turned to Ramesh Powar. And the trick did work. Off the last ball of Powar?s first over, Umar played it to square leg and seemed to settle for a single. Butt called for an ambitious second and was promptly sent back, but it was too late to beat the Venugopala Rao?s throw. Six balls later, vice-captain Younis Khan was out. 

Yusuf Youhana (18) announced his arrival with two meaty blows off Powar on the on-side. But what promised to be an entertaining innings was cut short when Shib Shankar Paul found his inside edge. 

Parthiv Patel, who had fumbled a couple of takes earlier, 

did no mistake and took a tumbling catch forward.

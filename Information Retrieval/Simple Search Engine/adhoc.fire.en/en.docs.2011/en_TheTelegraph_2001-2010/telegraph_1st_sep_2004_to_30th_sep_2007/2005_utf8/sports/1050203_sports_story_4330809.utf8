 Another designer drug discovered

London: Canadian scientists uncovered a new steroid designed to avoid detection in standard doping tests, but say they found no evidence it was used by athletes. 

The World Anti-Doping Agency said on Tuesday that the substance ? called desoxy-methyl-testosterone, or DMT ? was identified after a tip from an anonymous whistleblower. 

WADA science director Olivier Rabin said the drug had similarities to THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, a drug at the heart of the Balco steroid investigation in the United States. 

Rabin and Christiane Ayotte, director of Montreal?s anti-doping lab, said there was no evidence DMT that had been used by athletes. They touted the finding as a pre-emptive victory against drug cheats. 

?Probably in this case we are ahead of the dopers,? Rabin said in a conference call from WADA headquarters in Montreal. ?This shows to the dopers how serious we are.? 

The investigation began last year after Canadian customs officials seized substances coming across the border from the US. WADA received an anonymous e-mail in June tipping off the agency to the material seized in the raid. 

Officials of WADA and the Montreal lab got in touch with Canadian customs and worked together to identify the substance last summer. 

?We believe this was developed for the sole purpose of doping in sport,? Rabin said. ?We now have proof that THG was not a unique case. We now have proof that there are other designer drugs.? 

Ayotte said DMT consisted of a dangerous mixture of potentially toxic substances. Tests are continuing to identify the drug?s properties and determine how it enhances athletic performance. 

Ayotte said the Montreal lab re-tested thousands of urine samples from athletes in professional and Olympic sports, but found no use of DMT.

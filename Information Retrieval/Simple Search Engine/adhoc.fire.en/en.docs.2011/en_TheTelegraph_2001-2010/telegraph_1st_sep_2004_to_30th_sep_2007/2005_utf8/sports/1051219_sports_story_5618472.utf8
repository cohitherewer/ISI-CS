 Ronaldinho edging towards the elite 

 two

Guest Column

 Ronaldinho will surely be a handful for Chelsea

 Sven-Goran Eriksson must have 

 been the only man smiling when the draw for the Champions 

 League last Friday pitted Chelsea against Barcelona and 

 Arsenal against Real Madrid. Who knows, if all three English 

 teams get knocked out in the next round we might end up 

 winning the World Cup! Seriously though, these are mouth-watering 

 ties for both the English and Spanish and at least the finance 

 directors of these clubs must have been smiling along with 

 the England coach.

 Probably the ones who came out 

 best of all from the draw were the Italians ? Im sure 

 AC Milan and Juventus are much happier to be playing German 

 clubs than the likes of Chelsea or Barcelona. Frank Warren 

 himself couldnt have dreamed up a better rematch than 

 Chelsea versus Barcelona, given all the needle in last seasons 

 ties and their standing in the European game.

 Like last year, whoever wins that 

 game are sure to be favourites to win the competition. Liverpool 

 confounded those odds last year and could do so again, judging 

 by the way they are playing at the moment. However, I have 

 a couple of reservations about their continued good form, 

 which I still believe could last long enough to see the 

 European champions past Benfica and into the quarter finals.

 One is that during this run of 

 11 games without defeat they have not, Chelsea apart, met 

 too many top sides and their European journey began earlier 

 than most other clubs, back in July, so they are likely 

 to be the first to tire. 

 While its a fact in football 

 that a team doesnt feel tired as long they keep winning, 

 it only takes a couple of consecutive setbacks for them 

 to start feeling fatigued all of a sudden. Also, Liverpool 

 are heavily dependent upon Steven Gerrard and one has to 

 wonder how long he, in particular, can sustain that sort 

 of effort and athleticism. Not so Chelsea and Barcelona, 

 who are coasting in their respective leagues ? well, at 

 least the English club is; Barcelona have Osasuna hanging 

 onto their coat-tails in La Liga. 

 Like Manchester United, Arsenal 

 are going through a transitional period. Strangely, just 

 for a change, their form in Europe has been better than 

 in the league, although they were in an easier group this 

 time. Inevitably, as Arsenal have stuttered in the league, 

 Arsene Wenger has come in for stick on the radio phone-ins 

 for his decision to sell Patrick Vieira, but nowadays when 

 a player wants to leave there is not a lot that can be done 

 about it. Its all very well saying he should have 

 found a replacement for the Frenchman before he sold him 

 but where do you find replacements of the same quality? 

 Losing Edu at the same time was a doubly hard blow.

 Yet I think they have a real chance 

 against Madrid, whose form is erratic to say the least and 

 who are still suspect in defence. And as Liverpool showed 

 last season, a team doesnt have to be the best in 

 their country to win the Champions League. The galacticos 

 are ageing: Ronaldo is probably past his best, picking up 

 injuries and looking a little heavy; Zinedine Zidane is 

 definitely not the player he was and nor, probably, is Raul. 

 What with their Brazilian coach Wanderley Luxemburgo gone 

 too, it is a good time for Arsenal to have that first meeting 

 with them.

 Their fans will believe playing 

 the second leg at home, where they have largely managed 

 to sustain their form, will be to their advantage. But Ive 

 never been convinced about the benefit of playing a second 

 leg at home, unless the tie happens to go to extra time.

 Certainly Chelsea will need to 

 take with them a decent lead to the Nou Camp if they are 

 to survive. Barcelona were clearly the better side at home 

 last year and, in Ronaldinho, they possess the best player 

 in the world. He confirmed that fact when Barcelona destroyed 

 Madrid in their recent league meeting at the Bernabeu. For 

 me, he is edging towards that select group of two who make 

 up the Greatest Footballers in the World Club.

 The two honorary members are Pele 

 and Maradona. At the moment the young Brazilian belongs 

 to the gold club, which consists of Johan Cruyff and Michel 

 Platini, but he is looking to upgrade. He will be a handful 

 for Chelsea, for sure.

 Someone who wont be a handful, 

 they will be relieved to know, is Xavi. This wonderful little 

 fooballer wont trouble England either should they 

 draw Spain in the World Cup if he still hasnt recovered 

 from his cruciate ligament injury.

 Still, the Argentine, Lionel Messi, 

 has come in and looks a bit tasty. Thats often the 

 way with good clubs; they lose one player and gain another.

 No player likes to miss a competition 

 as big as the Champions League, certainly not at this stage. 

 At least Xavi has played in it, which is more than I ever 

 did. Everton, when I joined them, would have played in the 

 European Cup had English clubs not been banned and would 

 have had a great chance of winning it. In those days, of 

 course, only champions qualified for it. And when I went 

 to Barcelona, good as they were, they werent the Barcelona 

 of today.

 England must keep the ball rolling 

 - Australia will not take the bruise inflicted to their dignity lightly 

CHRISTOPHER MARTIN-JENKINS

 England players ? Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones ? after their Ashes victory at The Oval 

This summer of summers is over at a professional level, now to be relived in books, DVDs and a million memories. Even for those not closely involved, the excitements of the 2005 Ashes series, crammed into a mere seven weeks, will be savoured for ever. 

For one who has written about the eight defeats that preceded Englands wonderfully entertaining recovery from the abject performance that followed their inspiring start on the first day at Lords on July 21, the best reward was that there is no need to write another whats wrong with English cricket article, nor to find ways of reassuring the doubters that, actually, there was quite a lot right with it, too. 

Yet, of course, the game in Britain can no more stand still in its hour of triumph than it could after all those greater and small defeats against an Australian juggernaut that some people believed would never be stopped. 

To win back the Ashes a series earlier than most expected was a bonus; to do it in such style, amid classic, slow-burning Test-match tension that introduced another generation to the games unique subtleties, was like winning the jackpot. It is not the case that cricket in the land of its birth has woken up bursting with health after a long fever, but to many that is what it felt like. 

Australians made it possible, both by setting the pattern by which England played and by battling with such pride, Shane Warne heroically to the fore until he, of all people, dropped the catch that finally allowed Kevin Pietersens bulging talent to burst like an ostrich from the egg. Because he gave so much to the Hampshire cause as well as to his countrys, Warne was the man of the season every bit as much as Andrew Flintoff, who would have played more often for Lancashire, and with just as much passion, if Duncan Fletcher had allowed. 

It is a pity he could not be rested again before Pakistan, rather than playing in the forthcoming television spectacular in Australia by which the ICC will generate millions more of the American dollars they covet. 

Some of them will be used for the wider spread of the game (the commercial success of pitting the world champions ? just ? against the Rest of the World was never in doubt), but the ICC is exploiting Test cricket and also undermining it by suggesting that there is something even better. For heavens sake, nothing in sport could be much better than the Sunday morning at Edgbaston. 

At least the matches in Melbourne and Sydney next month will give Ricky Ponting and his team a chance to recover some pride. A Long Live Cricket Day has been organised throughout Australia this Saturday on which the international players who returned home in disappointment two weeks ago will go back to their original clubs to play in grade matches. It is a reminder both of that essential link between the top and the bottom of the pyramid in any successful cricket country and that Australia will not take the bruise inflicted to their dignity lightly. 

One of the reasons for their long period of success has been their respect for the game. Example: last week David Hussey, whose brother, Michael, has helped Durham up to the first division, put himself out to attend the annual dinner of the new Cockspur club champions, Horsham, the club he had in 2003 helped to win the Sussex League. Since then he has helped Nottinghamshire to win the second and first divisions of the Frizzell County Championship in successive seasons. By next year he may be a Test player. Essential links. Stephen Fleming set an equally good example at Nottinghamshire, but English bowlers like A. J. Harris and Ryan Sidebottom were also outstanding. 

There are still too many non-qualified players in county cricket but ?100,000 per county in central income next season will be distributed as performance-related payments and by 2007 most county chief executives believe that the new criteria will begin to force the hand of counties inclined to look overseas to buy success. 

Glamorgan have been the exception this year, resulting in 14 lost matches out of 16 and demotion to the second division, but nine Welshman aided by Matthew Elliott and Michael Kasprowicz next year should prove a stronger force. Hampshire may to some extent have bought their success ? the C amp;G Trophy and second place in the county championship ? but more counties seem to be getting the message that success has to be built patiently. 

Peter Moores and Chris Adams have proved that at Sussex, wedding local talent to shrewdly recruited imports such as Murray Goodwin, the dynamic Rana Naved-ul Hasan and the tireless Mushtaq Ahmed, the leading wicket-taker in county cricket once more. 

It remains crucial that England-qualified players get proper opportunities in prime positions in county bowling attacks and batting orders. Without Simon Jones, still not certain to be fit for the tour of Pakistan, England had a much less potent bowling force in the final Test. 

James Anderson, Sajid Mahmood and Chris Tremlett need to push hard to displace Jones, Stephen Harmison and Matthew Hoggard before the next series for the Ashes starts only a little more than a year from now, if only to prove that there are viable reserves. 

The same is true in the spin and wicketkeeping departments but batting resources now seem as plentiful as Australias. Alastair Cook, the 20-year-old Essex left-hander, who started the season with a hundred in each innings for MCC and made a double century against the Australians, could beat the likes of Owais Shah and Ed Joyce to the top table, but Shah is a very good player indeed not to be playing international cricket. 

Every area of the game has reflected Englands success this season, vindicating completely the priority it was given by the ECB from the start of the MacLaurin/Lamb era. Wasim Khan, supervising the pilot scheme of A Chance to shine, which will gather impetus next season when 100 carefully selected cricket clubs guarantee the revival of regular cricket in a total of 600 local schools, reports manic interest in all areas of youth cricket. 

 Shame on the Government then that Tony Blair should invite Vaughan and his men to Downing Street but fail to confirm that they will match the ?25million that is being raised voluntarily in this cause.

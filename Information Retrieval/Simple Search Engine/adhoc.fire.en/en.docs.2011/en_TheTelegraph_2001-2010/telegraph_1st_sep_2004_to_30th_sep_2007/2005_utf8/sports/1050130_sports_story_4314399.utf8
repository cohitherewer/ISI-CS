 We can push past 400 in ODIs: Buchanan

 - World beaters set up a new Everest 

 Buchanan 

Sydney: World champions Australia have always raised the benchmark for themselves and now they want to be the first team to score 400 runs in a one-day International. 

?It?s certainly been promoted to the players that the concept of 400 is a reality, and that we should be the first team to achieve it,? coach John Buchanan was quoted as saying in The Australian. 

?The concept?s there, and I think it?s another of those little hills the one-day side is striving to achieve,? he said about the goal which only one team has come close to in 2,213 ODIs contested in over 34 years. 

Sri Lanka had scored 398 for five in 50 overs against minnows Kenya in Kandy on the way to their maiden World Cup title in 1996. 

Buchanan said the Australians want to reach new horizons. ?Rather than being happy with ?yeah, we?re beating everybody? ? and we like to win ? we need to keep raising ourselves. This is just one example, and there?s no reason why it can?t be achieved.? 

Ricky Ponting has been inspiring his team to strive to improve in every match. Four of Australia?s five highest one-day totals have been posted since 2002, when Ponting took over. 

?I think it (400) will happen and I think it?s something that?s pretty achievable for our side,? Ponting said. ?It?s not really anything we?ve sat down and spoken about, but it has been written on some of our team meeting blackboards at times ? and with our team we think it?s something that?s achievable.?

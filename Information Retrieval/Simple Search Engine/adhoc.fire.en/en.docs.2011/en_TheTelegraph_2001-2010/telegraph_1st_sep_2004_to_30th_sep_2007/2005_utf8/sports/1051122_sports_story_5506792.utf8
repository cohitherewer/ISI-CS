 Delhi almost certain to host 

New Delhi: The national capital was almost certain to get the 2014 Asian Games as all other contenders except one have withdrawn their bids in its favour, the Indian Olympic Association said on Monday. 

We are competing with Korea only for the 2014 Games. All other bidders have stepped aside in our support, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said. 

But since Busan hosted the Asian Games in 2002, we are almost certain of getting the games, he said. 

Kalmadi was addressing a seminar on Australia-India collaboration in sports and major sporting events. 

The 2006 Asian Games would be held in Doha, Qatar while Guangzhou, China would host the 2010 edition. 

Kalmadi, also the chairman of the 2010 Commonwealth Games organising committee, said India managed to get the backing of several Commonwealth members because of the enormous trade and investment opportunities it offered. 

They thought that other markets were quite saturated whereas India still had huge potential which was untapped, he said. 

A successful bid for the Asian Games could go a long way in fulfilling Indias aspirations of hosting the Olympic Games, Kalmadi said. 

It is good for us that London bagged the Games for 2012 which gets Europe out of the way. That coupled with Beijing hosting the 2008 Olympics could work in our favour, he said. We have also convinced South Africa to delay their bid till 2020. 

The infrastructure for the Commonwealth Games and Asiad could be used for the Olympics, Kalmadi added.

 PCB to probe other matches

Karachi: The controversies surrounding Pakistan?s inaugural Twenty20 Cup did not end with the fine, suspension and reprimand against allrounder Shoaib Malik when the Pakistan Cricket Board said it was also investigating the other matches played in the competition. 

?PCB is also instituting an inquiry into other matches of the Twenty20 championship,? the PCB said in a statement. 

Although the board used a generalised term, it was definitely hinting at a match involving Lahore Eagles and Multan Tigers when the Tigers, who had already crashed out of the competition by that stage, conceded 24 no-balls and six wides. 

The Tigers showed their generosity after pacer Shabbir Ahmed had accounted for Eagles? star players Salman Butt and Kamran Akmal with the scoreboard reading just eight in a match that was a must-win for the local team. 

Shoaib Malik, who was penalised for conceding a match to Karachi Zebras, had, in fact, raised this suspicion when he appeared before the three-man inquiry committee that was constituted by the cricket board to investigate Malik?s case.

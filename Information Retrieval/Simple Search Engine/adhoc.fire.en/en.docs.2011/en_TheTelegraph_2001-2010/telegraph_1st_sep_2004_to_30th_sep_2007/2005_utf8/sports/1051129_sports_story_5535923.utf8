 Paes hails new scoring system

Beijing: Ace tennis star Leander Paes has welcomed the new scoring system for the doubles game adopted by the ATP from 2006, hoping that the changes would result in more prime time television coverage, popularity and prize money. 

I must say the ATP has done a good job to popularise the game of doubles and not only finance more prize money for the doubles but also increase its popularity of the game as well, Paes said in an interview to a Chinese television channel. 

Paes, who teamed up with Serbias Nenad Zimonjic to claim the runners-up title at the year-ending Masters Cup doubles last week in Shanghai, said that he and other players had a long meeting with the new ATP president Etienne De Villiers and staff on the newly formulated rules for doubles which will make the doubles match shorter. 

Though the changes were not the best case scenario, it will actually give the tournament a better chance to put the matches on prime time on TV, Paes said. 

If they can put more of doubles on prime time TV, it will be wonderful for the game of tennis, he said as the Indo-Serbian duo ended the year as the No. 6 in the ATP ranking. 

Villiers, who was in Shanghai last week, said that with the new system, mens doubles match will have just two full sets with a tie-break at six-all with no advantages, as the innovation within the traditional set. The third set will be a full match tie-break, which is first to 10. 

Commenting on his tight schedule and play, Paes said: In a profession like tennis, the world is your platform, the world is your stage. 

You end up travelling 30 weeks out of 52. Ive been travelling for the last 20 years now and in doing that I have made some great friends, including my doubles partner. 

He said it has been an honour to be the highest ranking Asian player for over a decade now. 

Paes said: I always choose my doubles partner based on my strengths and weaknesses on the tennis court and off the tennis court. (PTI)

 Leander, Zimonjic move into final

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic reached their second final in two weeks after toppling fourth seeds Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro at the Madrid Masters on Saturday. 

According to information received here, the Indo-Serbian duo won 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 against the two-time Australian Open champions. Paes and Zimonjic had accounted for Mahesh Bhupathi and Martin Damm in the quarters on Friday. 

Having also made the final of the Stockholm Open last week (before bowing to Australians Paul Hanley and Wayne Arthurs), Paes and Zimonjic have virtually sealed their berth in the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai next month. 

Paes and Zimonjic, currently at No. 6 in the ATP Doubles Race, will move up at least one spot when the rankings list is updated on Monday. The top eight teams will earn the right to compete in the prestigious Masters Cup. 

On Sunday, Paes and Zimonjic will be eyeing their third title of the year, having won on the claycourts of Monte Carlo and Barcelona in the first half of the season. 

It wont be an easy task on Sunday, as they face the winners of the semi-final featuring second seeds Wayne Black-Kevin Ullyett and third seeds Mark Knowles-Daniel Nestor. 

Earlier, Leander, partnering Zimonjic, got the better of his teammate and former partner Mahesh Bhupathi, who was playing with Czech Martin Damm. 

The Indian Davis Cup captain beat Bhupathi and Damm 7-6, 7-5 to reach the semi-finals. 

That was the 11th meeting between the two Indian stalwarts in a doubles match. Paes, the senior pro, has now taken a 6-5 lead.

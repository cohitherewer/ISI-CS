 Rain plays spoilsport

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar will make his world record 357th appearance at the Eden Gardens on Friday. The washout at the Chepauk on Tuesday has thus come as a boon for Calcuttans. 

Umpires Daryl Harper and K. Hariharan, along with Match Referee Jeff Crowe, decided to call off the third one-day International of the Pepsi series shortly after 3 pm. The series is currently tied 1-1. 

Though the pitch and its adjoining areas remained covered, pools of water around the outfield had ruled out play long before the scheduled start. Nevertheless, the umpires decided on a second round of inspection at 4.30 pm, but a downpour that lashed the city around three ruled out any action. 

Ranadeb in squad 

Bengals Ranadeb Bose found a berth in the 12-man Board Presidents XI squad announced by the national selectors for the match against Sri Lanka in Bangalore later this month. 

THE SQUAD 

 Yalaka Venugopal Rao (captain), Dheeraj Jadhav, Sikhar Dhawan, Robin Uthappa, Neeraj Patel, S. Sriram, Parthiv Patel (vice-captain), Kulmani Parida, Amit Mishra, Munaf Patel, Gagandeep Singh, Ranadeb Bose.

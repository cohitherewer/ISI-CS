Madrid: Real Madrid closed the gap on leaders Barcelona to six points at the top of the Primera Liga on Wednesday when they outgunned Real Betis 3-1 at the Bernabeu. 

Betis were the better side for much of the first half, but an opportunist strike from Michael Owen and a thunderbolt from full-back Roberto Carlos put Real 2-0 up at the break. That was a grand way to celebrate for Carlos who was playing his 300th league match for Real. 

Midfielder Edu pulled one back for the visitors with a sharp strike on the turn early in the second half, but centre-back Ivan Helguera snuffed out any hopes of a comeback when he looped a header over ?keeper Antonio Doblas two minutes later. 

Barcelona, held goalless at home by Espanyol on Tuesday, lead the standings with 59 points. Real follow on 53, a distant 10 ahead of in-form Villarreal. Manuel Pelligrini?s side climbed to third thanks to a 2-1 win at home to relegation-threatened Real Mallorca, Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan snatching a late winner to take his tally for the season to 16. 

Earlier Sevilla and Valencia fought out a dramatic 2-2 draw that kept the teams in the hunt for the Champions League places. 

Sevilla striker Julio Baptista, who had equalised when he cracked home a penalty midway through the second half, missed a golden opportunity to seal victory when he skied another spot-kick over the bar just six minutes from time. 

Valencia, who got off to a winning start under new coach Antonio Lopez with a 2-1 victory over Betis at the weekend, were also left rueing their bad luck when they had a late goal controversially disallowed for a foul. The result left Sevilla fourth in the standings, level on points with Villarreal and one ahead of champions Valencia. 

Tottenham Hotspur scored three second-half goals to seal an emphatic 3-0 win at second division Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup fifth-round replay on Wednesday.

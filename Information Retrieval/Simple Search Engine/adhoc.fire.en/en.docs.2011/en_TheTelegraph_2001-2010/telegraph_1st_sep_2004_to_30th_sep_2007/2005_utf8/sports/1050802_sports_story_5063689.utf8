 Weakened West Indies up against Lankan might today

Dambulla: Sri Lanka carry enough power to take care of a weak West Indian outfit who seem severely handicapped by the lack of some quality players, including Brian Lara, when the two teams meet in Dambulla on Tuesday. 

The hosts, almost unbeatable at home, have so far played and won one game, while the West Indies, led by Shivnarine Chanderpaul, lost their only game against India on Sunday. 

Sri Lanka, coached by former Australian cricketer Tom Moody, have also been boosted by the news that fast bowler Nuwan Zoysas back injury was not a strain or stress fracture so he will be available for selection for the latter stages of the tri-series. 

We have had some good news about Zoysa as the injury seems to have been just a back spasm and he feels much better now, said Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu. 

We will assess his fitness when we get back to Colombo on Thursday and then give him a full fitness certificate before our final game there against the West Indies, the Lanka skipper added. 

However, he also revealed that veteran left-armer Chaminda Vaas return from a hamstring injury will be delayed as much as possible although he has been recovering well. 

Chaminda (Vaas) has progressed a lot and has been receiving treatment from CJ Clarke (the physio) every day, Atapattu said. 

We will keep him for the more important games and will try to delay his comeback as much as possible, he added. 

Sri Lanka play back-to-back games against West Indies and India on Tuesday and Wednesday, which will mark the end of the Dambulla leg of the triangular series.

Sri Lanka: Maravan Atapattu (cap.), Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumara Sangakkara, Russell Arnold, T. Tilhara, T. Dilshan, Upul Chandana, Muttiah Muralidharan, Dilhara Fernando, Ferveez Mahroof, Dilhara Lokuhettige.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kahlon in joint lead, Jeev tied third

 Kahlon feels his game is coming together 

Phuket: India?s Harmeet Kahlon sparkled with a five-under par 67 to shoot into shared lead with Scott Barr of Australia in the Thailand Open at the Blue Canyon Country Club on Saturday. 

Kahlon, 34, whose sole win on the Asian Tour came at home in Hero Honda Masters 2002, was at nine-under 207 at the end of the third round. 

Barr, following up on his first two rounds of 65 and 68, had a two-over 74, the same as Jeev Milkha Singh, the first round leader. 

Jeev was in the lead to begin with and then held it with two holes to go at 11-under. But then he bogeyed the 17th and double bogeyed the 18th to drop into a three-way tie for third place at eight-under 208. 

India?s other hopefuls, Shiv Kapur and Gaurav Ghei also had a disappointing day. Kapur carded a four-over 76 and dropped from tied fourth to tied 13th, while Ghei carded a three-over 75 and was placed way back in tied 67th at six-over 222. 

Kahlon handled the tricky greens at the spectacular course well. 

?I holed some good putts and read the lines well. It was a good day and I hit it reasonably well. My game is coming together over the past few months after switching coaches last August. I?m now working with Jonathan Yarwood (who coaches Michael Campbell) and I?m feeling better with my game.? 

Jeev had a 34 on front nine but then had three bogeys and one double bogey at the finishing 18th hole on his inward nine. Strange also stumbled late in his round, with bogeys on the 14th, 15th and 17th holes.

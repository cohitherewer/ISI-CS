 Inzy urges England to review decision

Karachi: Pakistans captain Inzamam-ul Haq has asked the England cricket authorities to review their decision not to play a Test match in Karachi later this year. 

England are due to tour Pakistan from October 26 for three Tests and five one-day Internationals. They will play only one game, a one-dayer, in Karachi in December for security reasons. 

All their other matches are in the central Punjab province something that has irked the passionate followers of the game and the cricket association of Karachi. 

Inzamam said: When India played last year in Karachi no untoward incident took place. I think Karachi being a major centre deserves to host a Test. 

The Pakistan captain felt the England board and players need to realise that threats from terrorists could happen anywhere. He said: The London bombings are an example. If England do revise their decision of not playing a Test in Karachi it would earn them a lot of goodwill in Pakistan and elsewhere. (Reuters)

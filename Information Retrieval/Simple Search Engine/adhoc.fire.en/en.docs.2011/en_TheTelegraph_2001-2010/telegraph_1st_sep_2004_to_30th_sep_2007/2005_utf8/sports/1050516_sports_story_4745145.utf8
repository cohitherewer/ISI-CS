 OHair eyes first PGA Tour title

 SeanO Hair feels he is playing the best golf he has in his entire life 

Toronto: American Sean OHair, who was pushed, prodded and bullied to become a professional golfer by his father, fired a third round three-under 67 to take the third round lead at the Byron Nelson Championship on Saturday and move within sight of his first PGA Tour title. 

A PGA Tour rookie still searching for his first top 10 finish, Hair moved top of the leaderboard with a tidy round at the TPC at Four Seasons Resort in Irving, Texas mixing four birdies with a single bogey to finish 12-under on 198, one shot clear of British Open champion Todd Hamilton. 

With world No.1 Tiger Woods record run of 142 consecutive cuts coming to an end on Friday when he failed to beat the halfway guillotine by one stroke, the spotlight fell on Hair, whose only notoriety was an overbearing father who made him turn professional before completing high school and sign a contract guaranteeing a percentage of his sons future earnings. 

It doesnt get much better than Tiger, so Im not going to sit there and say, well, its nice to be leading something that he missed the cut on, said Hair. 

He just had a tough week, and Im playing the best I have pretty much my whole entire life. 

I really cant compare to that. I really struggled at the beginning of the day. You know, I was nervous, but I definitely wasnt feeling well. I felt a little light-headed. I didnt eat much today. I really couldnt down anything, and out in that heat, I was struggling quite a bit. 

While Hair no longer has contact with his father, the slightly built 22-year-old could be headed for $1 million payday if he can hold his nerve and form for one more round. 

Hamilton, who is yet to finish in top 15 result this season and struggled to find the form that carried him to victory at the British Open a year ago, carded a five-under 65 to sit one off the pace on 11-under 199. 

I missed a couple of short putts I normally would have made if I had been playing well but I havent been playing well for awhile, said Hamilton. I just hope I can hang in there one more day. 

Ive always considered myself a very streaky golfer. 

When I play well, Im up there, and when I dont play well, Im nowhere to be seen. 

One thing Ive learned over the years, Ive learned to make cuts but Im not playing well. 

I feel like this year I havent really played up to my potential but Ive missed three out of about 15 or 16 cuts, however many I played. 

Hamilton said he wasnt surprised that Hair was at the top of the board. 

Real good kid, real down to earth. I know hes got kind of an odd story with his father, but you could never tell that theres been any bad blood between the two. 

Americans Scott Verplank, Doug Barron and Ted Purdy are one stroke further adrift at 10-under 200. 

World No.2 Vijai Singh, who can reclaim the number one ranking from Woods with a top three finish in Texas, battled to a one-under 69 to stay within sight of the leaders at six-under 204. 

World No.3 Ernie Els also carded a 69 but sits one shot back of Singh at five-under 205 with champion Sergio Garcia and Phil Mickelson. 

Mickelson, the world No.4, got his day off to an appalling start with five bogeys on the first 11 holes but recovered with four birdies over the last six to finish at level-par 70.

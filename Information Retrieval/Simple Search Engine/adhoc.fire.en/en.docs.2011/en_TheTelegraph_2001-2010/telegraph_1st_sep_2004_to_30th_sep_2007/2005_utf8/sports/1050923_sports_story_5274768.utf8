 Deco saves Barcelona 

Madrid: Champions Barcelona narrowly avoided a second defeat in a row when they came from a goal down to claim a 2-2 draw at home to Valencia in the Primera Liga on Wednesday. 

Valencia keeper Santiago Canizares gifted the Catalans the equaliser 10 minutes from time when he dropped a Ronaldinho cross and the ball fell to Deco who drilled home to earn his side a point. 

Celta Vigo, who returned to the Primera Liga this season, moved a point clear at the top of the table after a double from Brazilian striker Fernando Baiano earned them a 2-1 victory at Villarreal who are anchored to the bottom of the table with just two points from four games.

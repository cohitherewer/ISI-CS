 Navratilova: I?m still damn good

 Navratilova says women?s tennis is really strong 

Gold Coast: Martina Navratilova says she remains a competitive force in elite-level tennis at the age of 48. 

The ageing tennis marvel Friday said she was insulted by suggestions that her longevity in the sport was down to a lack of depth in women?s tennis. 

Navratilova, preparing for next month?s Australian Open in Melbourne, said she could still compete with the current crop of top stars because she was ?damn good.? 

The winner of 58 Grand Slam titles returned serve at a media conference here ahead of next week?s Australian women?s hardcourt tournament at Royal Pines Resort. 

?I?ve been asked that question for the past five years and frankly I consider it an insult,? Navratilova told reporters. 

?Women?s tennis is really strong and all I can say is I?m that damn good. 

?I?m sorry but I really have to blow my own horn here ? I?m still that good. The ball doesn?t know how old you are.? 

Navratilova accused the media of double standards when reporting on male athletes coming back from retirement and playing well. ?(Ice hockey veteran) Mario Lemieux came back after two years and started scoring goals and all the reporters were saying, wow he?s really good,? she said. 

?But when a woman does it, they question the standard of competition she?s playing in. You wouldn?t ask John McEnroe that question would you?,? Navratilova said. 

Navratilova said despite her age her ability was still as strong as ever. 

She still possesses her trademark fitness and has worked hard on her flexibility to keep her game in fine form. 

?Since 1984 I haven?t lost a match from being tired and I might be playing some singles events this season depending on the surface,? she said. 

?The main problem is movement but I?ve worked on that and I feel I really have time to hit the ball. 

?I always had a stiff shoulder from when I was little but now I can get my arm into position, I?m hitting serves and thinking, did I do that??

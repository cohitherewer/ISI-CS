 Lucky win for Alonso

 - Raikkonen crashes out 

Nuerburgring: Renaults Fernando Alonso won a dramatic European Grand Prix on Sunday after championship rival Kimi Raikkonen crashed out on the last lap while leading. 

The Spaniard, now with a commanding 32 point lead in the Formula One standings, had been catching Raikkonen as the Finn tried to nurse his ailing McLaren through the last few laps of the race to what would have been a third win in a row. 

Instead it was Alonso who celebrated his fourth win in seven races with Raikkonen, his tyres worn out, spinning off when the suspension suddenly shattered. 

Nick Heidfeld was second for Williams with Brazilian Rubens Barrichello in third place for Ferrari. 

It was the second time in two races that Heidfeld, who started on pole for the first time in front of his home crowd, had finished as runner-up. 

Briton David Coulthard finished fourth for Red Bull despite a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pitlane while Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher finished fifth after running 14th early in the race. 

Italian Giancarlo Fisichella was sixth for Renault with Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya seventh for McLaren . 

Briton Jenson Button finished 10th, with Japanese teammate Takuma Sato 12th as the BAR team returned from a two-race suspension. 

Indias Narain Karthikeyan finished 16th and behind teammate Tiago Monteiro. 

Karthikeyan bounced back from the Monaco disaster to produce a largely problem-free race. I had a reasonable start and managed to avoid the chaos in the first corner and stay in front of Jacques Villeneuve for about 10 laps, said Karthikeyan. 

After the first pit stop, Karthikeyan managed to pass monteiro and kept a good pace throughout. 

Unfortunately for him, he made a small mistake near the end, which allowed Monteiro to overtake him. I am really happy I have finished here. I knew it was going to be a hard race as it was my first time on this circuit. 

Alonso had been confident, despite starting from sixth on the grid, because of his strategy of carrying a heavy fuel load in Saturdays qualifying. 

The race was delayed when Fisichella stalled on the grid and had to be pushed to the pitlane for the re-start. 

Strategies were then hurriedly re-thought after a pile up at the first corner, caused by Australian Mark Webber barging into McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya.

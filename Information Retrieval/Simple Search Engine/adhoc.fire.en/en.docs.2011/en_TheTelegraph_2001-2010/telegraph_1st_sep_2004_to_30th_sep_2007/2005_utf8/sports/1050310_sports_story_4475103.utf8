 Central need 141 runs to clinch title

 Gagandeep took three for 52 for North 

Nagpur: The Duleep Trophy final was poised for a thrilling finish with Central Zone requiring 141 runs to clinch the title on a lively track at the VCA cricket ground here on Wednesday. 

Central, who dismissed North for 169 in their second innings, were yet to open their account in the two balls bowled before the second day?s proceedings were called off due to bad light 19 minutes before the scheduled close. 

Mediumpacers R. S. Sodhi (3 for 10) and Gagandeep Singh (3 for 52), put North Zone back in the match with their fine performance as the Central Zone batsmen surrendered without any resistance. 

North Zone once again made a poor start in their second essay losing two early wickets of Akash Chopra (2) and Sodhi (1).

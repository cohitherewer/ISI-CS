 Lance loses yellow jersey to German

 - TOUR DE FRANCE, NINTH STAGE 

Mulhouse (France): Lance Armstrong lost his Tour de France leaders yellow jersey to Germanys Jens Voigt as the race reached its first halt at the end of Sundays 171-km ninth stage. 

Isolated the day before in the first mountains of the Tour when his Discovery Channel teammates unexpectedly faltered, the six-time Tour champion was content to check out his main rivals for overall victory in the six climbs on the stage between Gerardmer and Mulhouse. 

Dane Michael Rasmussen seized his chance to stage a long solo breakaway and to give his Rabobank team their second victory in succession in just over four hours and eight minutes. 

Voigt, who chased Rasmussen with Frances Christophe Moreau, finished third, three minutes and four seconds behind the Dane. 

The CSC rider took the overall lead as the main pack, including Armstrong, finished more than three minutes behind him. 

Voigt, who was one minute behind the Texan going into the stage, was rewarded for his consistency since the start of the Tour with his second yellow jersey. He led the Tour briefly for one day in 2001. 

But the powerful German, dubbed the Boeing, is not a high mountain climber and is unlikely to keep the lead when the peloton tackle the Alps after Mondays rest day. 

I could not be happier but it cost me a lot of effort and I expect to pay a high price in two days time, Voigt said. But today I have the jersey and thats great. 

Holder of the King of the Mountains polkadot jersey since the previous stage to Gerardmer, Rasmussen attacked in the opening five km. 

The former mountain bike world champion was first accompanied by Italian Dario Cioni and then moved clear, the same way his teammate Pieter Weening had done the day before.

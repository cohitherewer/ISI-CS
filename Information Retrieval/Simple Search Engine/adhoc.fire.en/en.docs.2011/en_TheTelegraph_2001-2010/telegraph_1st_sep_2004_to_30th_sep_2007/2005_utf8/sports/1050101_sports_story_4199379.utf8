You?ve got to enjoy what you do

Ravi Shastri

I am a righthand batsman and love to play lofted 

shots. However, I often misjudge the flight when stepping out to leg-spinners. 

Why does this happen?

(Sounak Mullick, 16, Calcutta-26)

You are not reaching to the pitch of the ball. Your 

footwork is not precise. Also you?re lifting your head way before attempting the 

shot.

I am a righthand batsman. Whenever I try to 

play the flick against an off-spinner I end up giving a catch to backward shortleg. 

Please help.

(Tapash Dutta, 18, Calcutta-10)

It?s all to do with your footwork. It is very important 

to get as close to the pitch of the ball as possible. Your head should be down 

and on top of the ball while playing the shot.

I am an off-spin bowler. What should be the 

ideal length for pitching the top-spinner?

(Tridip Banerjee, 16, Calcutta-16)

It should act as a disguise. The ideal line is about 

six to eight inches outside the off stump.

I am a righthand batsman. I am rather weak on 

the leg-side when facing fast bowlers. Will practice at nets help me overcome 

the problem?

(Tapan Roy, 18, Calcutta-19)

Silly question. Practice can help you overcome anything. 

Work with your coach. When attempting the shot get into the right position.

I am a righthand batsman. When playing forward 

defensively against pacers, I end up giving a catch to second/third slip. My coach 

says its because I am opening the face of the bat. Please help.

(Ranen Chowdhury, 21, Guwahati)

Your coach is right and the reason you?re opening 

the face of the bat is because you are reaching out for the ball rather than waiting 

for the ball to come to the bat.

I am an off-spinner. What is doosra and should 

it be practised from a young age?

(Roktim Dutta, 15, Calcutta-15)

First have total control over your off spin. Then 

work on the arm ball before you think of doosra.

I am a right-arm medium-pacer. My action causes 

a natural outswing which I cannot prevent. But often I end up bowling wides. Why 

does this happen?

(Soumyajyoti Mukherjee, 14, Calcutta-68)

Concentrate on the spot you want to pitch the ball 

which should be around the off stump. Ensure you have a still head at the time 

of delivery.

I am a batsman. My catching is safe but ground 

fielding very poor. How do I improve it?

(Sekhar Guha, Dhanbad)

Fielding demands a lot of practice. You?ve got to 

enjoy what you do. Most importantly, get your body behind the ball with eyes on 

it at all times.

 Aristotle for Million 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Aristotle and Bratz may fight out the issue in the 1,400m Mysore Million, here on Friday. Bratz has two easy wins to her credit but Aristotle, in his debut run, had recorded an eye-catching victory. More importantly, the Vijay Singh-trained horse has a significant pull at the weights, therefore, he appears to have edge over Bratz, a Byramji-trained filly. C. Alford partners the Razeen-Excentrique son.

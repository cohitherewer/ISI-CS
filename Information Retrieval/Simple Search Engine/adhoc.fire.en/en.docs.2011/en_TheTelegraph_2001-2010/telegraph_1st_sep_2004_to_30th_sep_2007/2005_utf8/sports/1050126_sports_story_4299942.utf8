 There wasn?t much help for me: Shoaib

 Shoaib 

Sydney: Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar says he waged a lonely battle during the Test series against Australia as he did not get support from fellow bowlers. 

?I think people have got to give me credit,? said Akhtar, who has been forced to return home following an injury he suffered in the triangular series. 

?It was just me up against seven batsmen who are all capable of scoring 200 each. It was very tough. There wasn?t much support for me,? he said, according to a report in Sydney Morning Herald. 

Akhtar started the tour on a high, taking five for 99 in Perth. But he subsequently failed to live up to his reputation, finishing the Test series with 11 wickets averaging 30. 

Akhtar admitted that he went to Australia with a ?slight hamstring? problem which got worse as the series progressed. 

?It is hard trying to bowl at 155kmph all the time. You do get niggles. It?s like driving a Ferrari. After every few laps you have to get it serviced. I came here with a slight hamstring problem and it got worse after the first two Tests.? 

The pacer, who was described as a nightmare by Justin Langer before the start of the series, paid rich tributes to the Australian opener. 

?He is easily Australia?s toughest batsman. He is unbelievably determined.? 

Pak captaincy 

Meanwhile in Islamabad, Pakistan daily The News reported on Tuesday that Inzamam-ul Haq?s days as skipper may be numbered with President Pervez Musharraf reportedly directing the PCB to start looking for a replacement. (PTI)

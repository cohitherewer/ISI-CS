 Van Persie arrested

 - Suspicion of rape on Arsenals Dutch international 

Amsterdam: Arsenals Dutch forward Robin van Persie has been arrested in Rotterdam on suspicion of rape, a spokeswoman for the public prosecutor said on Tuesday. 

The 21-year-old Van Persie was arrested on Monday following an alleged incident over the weekend. He can be held for a maximum of three days without a formal charge. 

The arrest was yesterday and followed a complaint, the prosecutors spokeswoman Jeichien de Graaff said. She denied local media reports the arrest was made at a nightclub. 

Arsenal would not comment on the report and Van Persies lawyer Abraham Moszkowicz was not immediately available for comment because he was assisting his client. 

It was quite a shock to me to hear about it and it makes me a bit sad, Dutch national under-21 coach Foppe de Haan said. 

But lets not judge or condemn too quickly, he added. 

Van Persie, born in Rotterdam, joined the Dutch national squad for World Cup qualifiers against Romania and Finland last week. 

He moved to Arsenal last year from Feyenoord and had a mixed first season in England under manager Arsene Wenger. 

Sent off in a 1-1 Premier League draw at Southampton in February, which he described as his absolute low point last week, Van Persies form improved in the latter stages of the season. 

He scored twice in a 3-0 win over Blackburn Rovers that sealed Arsenals place in last months FA Cup final against Manchester United. 

Arsenal won the Cup following a penalty shootout in which Van Persie converted one of the spot-kicks and he made his international debut as a substitute against Romania. 

He scored his first international goal after coming on as a substitute again in a 4-0 win over Finland last Wednesday which left The Netherlands top of qualifying group I and on course for next years World Cup in Germany. 

In October last year, Van Persie crashed a BMW car en route to Arsenals training camp.

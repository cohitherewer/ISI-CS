London: Champions Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich all continued their unbeaten starts to the season at the weekend. However, Barcelona and Real Madrid slipped up leaving modest Madrid-based side Getafe in the limelight at the top of the Primera Liga for the first time in their history. 

Chelsea won their top-of-the-table clash with London rivals Charlton Athletic to chalk up their sixth straight Premier League win and have yet to concede a goal this season. 

Serie A leaders Juventus have also got maximum points, albeit from only three games, after beating visitors Ascoli. 

Bayern Munich stretched their Bundesliga winning streak to a record 14 matches with a victory at home to Hanover 96. 

Real completed a miserable week when they slipped to their third defeat in a row after losing at Espanyol, while champions Barcelona were dealt their first loss of the season at Atletico Madrid. 

Chelsea cruised to a 2-0 victory at Charlton Athletic, second-half goals by Argentine striker Hernan Crespo and Dutch winger Arjen Robben ensuring they have won all six league games this season. 

The champions are six points ahead of second-placed Charlton, who had taken maximum points from their first four games, and seven clear of Manchester United. 

Real Madrid lost 0-1 to a determined Espanyol who scored when defender Daniel Jarque got behind the defence to head in Ivan de la Penas free-kick 22 minutes from time. Reals pride was further wounded when two of their new signings ? Sergio Ramos and Julio Baptista ? were sent off in the closing minutes. 

Barcelona took an early lead when Samuel Eto steered in from close range but Atletico hit back with their first goal of the season when Fernando Torres powered in a header and Mateja Kezman ghosted in at the far post early in the second half to secure a 2-1 win. 

Bernd Schusters Getafe, who played in the top flight for the first time last season, claimed first place with a pulsating 4-3 win at Alaves after twice coming from behind. 

Juventus maintained their 100 per cent start to the season with a 2-1 win over Ascoli as AC Milan suffered a surprise 2-1 defeat at Sampdoria. The champions moved to nine points from three matches, two ahead of Fiorentina who beat Udinese 4-2. 

Livorno also have seven points after their 0-0 draw with AS Roma, as do Lazio and Palermo after wins over Treviso and Siena. 

Milan captain Paolo Maldini equalled Dino Zoffs record of 570 Serie A appearances but had little else to celebrate after defeat left his side five points adrift. Juventus victory marked a return to form for captain Alessandro Del Piero who scored both goals in the first half, including a penalty. 

Bayern Munich lead the Bundesliga standings with a maximum 15 points from five games after a 1-0 home win over Hanover 96 thanks to a a header from Argentine midfielder Martin Demichelis. 

Werder Bremen stayed within two points of top spot with a 3-2 win over visiting Borussia Dortmund.

 Federer to open versus Mathieu

 - BIG W DRAW 

 Davenport to take on Jidkova 

 Davenport has got a straightforward opening match 

London: Top seed Roger Federer will begin his bid for a third consecutive Wimbledon title against Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu following the draw at the All England Club on Thursday. 

Womens top seed Lindsay Davenport also received a straightforward opening match when the world No.1 was drawn against Russias Alina Jidkova. Champion and second seed Maria Sharapova plays Spains Nuria Llagostera-Vives. 

Federers main rival for the mens crown, last years runner-up and second seed Andy Roddick, was drawn against Czech Jiri Vanek. 

Roddick is expected to come through that test relatively easily but then could face the tallest man in tennis, Ivo Karlovic, in the second round. 

Roddick narrowly beat the 6ft 10in Croatian 7-6, 7-6 in the final of the Queens warm-up event at the weekend. 

Mens third seed and former champion Lleyton Hewitt plays Belgian Christophe Rochus in round one. Hewitt was drawn in the top half of the draw and could meet Federer in the semi-finals. 

French Open champion and fourth seed Rafael Nadal faces American Vince Spadea. Nadals teenage rival Richard Gasquet, beaten at the French Open by the Spaniard, could get his revenge in the third round. 

British hope Tim Henman, seeded sixth in the bottom half of the draw, faces Finn Jarkko Nieminen in the opening round. He could meet Roddick in the last eight. 

Michaella doubtful 

Meanwhile, Michaella Krajicek could miss her senior Wimbledon debut next week after she was forced to retire from her quarter final at the Ordina Open on Thursday with a right knee injury, adds a report from Den Bosch.

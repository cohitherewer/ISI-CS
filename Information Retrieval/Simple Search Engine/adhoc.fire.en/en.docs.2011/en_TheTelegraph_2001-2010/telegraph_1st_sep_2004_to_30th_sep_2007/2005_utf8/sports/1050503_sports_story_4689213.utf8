 Dean Jones is hopeful of a call

Abu Dhabi: Expressing his desire to become Team India?s next coach, Australian Dean Jones on Monday said he was looking to take the team to a new level with the focus on the 2007 World Cup. 

 Jones remains hopeful despite having figured in the 

 Central Bureau of Investigation?s 2000 probe into match-fixing. 

 During his testimony, top bookie Mukesh Kumar Gupta claimed 

 the Australian was introduced to him in Colombo by Manoj 

 Prabhakar in the early Nineties. 

Jones, who was here as a TV commentator for the triangular tournament involving teams from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, said he had already applied for the post and was expecting a response from the BCCI in the next few weeks. 

?I just want to coach India and hopefully I get an interview call,? Jones said. 

?I will make an attempt to bring the best out of them with the World Cup just two years away.? 

Jones said he had all the requirements to be a successful coach, including a coaching degree from Australia.

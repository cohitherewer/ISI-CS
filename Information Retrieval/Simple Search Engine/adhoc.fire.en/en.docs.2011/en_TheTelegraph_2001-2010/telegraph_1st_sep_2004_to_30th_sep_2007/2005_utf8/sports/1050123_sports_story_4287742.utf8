The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sena threat does not worry PCB

Islamabad: Pakistan Saturday said it was undeterred by a threat to disrupt their one-day cricket match in New Delhi and that they will certainly go ahead with the tour. 

Reacting to the threat issued Friday by Shiv Sena?s Delhi unit, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shahryar Khan told a television channel that the organisation had issued similar threats in 1999 but the team went ahead with the tour. 

[A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: The Board of Control for Cricket in India has no reaction at the moment as it has referred the venues to the Union government and will be guided entirely by what New Delhi says.] 

?When we went there in 1999, at that time also they issued threats and caused some damage. We will go ahead and play where we think we should. Security is in the hands of our hosts, the Indian board. We will certainly go, and we will not be deterred because of threats,? the chairman said. (PTI)

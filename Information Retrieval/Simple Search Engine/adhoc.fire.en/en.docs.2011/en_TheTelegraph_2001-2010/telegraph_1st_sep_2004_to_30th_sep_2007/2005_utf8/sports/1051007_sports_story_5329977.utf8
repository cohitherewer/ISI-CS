 Impressive Jeev takes Day I lead

 Jeev Milkha

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh made an impressive start in the Japan Golf Tour, shooting a bogey-free opening round of seven-under 65 to lead the field at the ?120 million Coca Cola Tokai Classic at the par-72 Miyoshi Country Club in Aichi. 

The Chandigarh golfer, playing with a flu, made five birdies and an eagle as he led by one stroke over Yong-Eun Yang, Takuya Taniguchi and Toru Taniguchi. 

Japanese Shingo Katayama and Katsumasa Miyamoto ? were among the six tied for the fifth place at five-under 67. 

It was the most unbelievable round I ever played. I was completely drained out because of the flu, and my throat was hurting so bad I was having trouble swallowing water, Jeev said. 

I went to the first tee with absolutely no expectations from the round. I just wanted to play regulation golf. As it turned out, it was one of my best rounds in a long, long time, he said. 

The 33-year-old started late in the day from the first tee and his plan of reaching the greens in regulation worked to perfection as he played his first 12 holes in regulation. 

Jeev reached the 570-yard hole, the longest of the course, with two brilliant shots, and then sank a massive 30-foot curling putt for an eagle which catapulted him on top of the leaderboard. 

Jeev, who has made 11 cuts in 17 starts, and is currently ranked 44th player on the Japanese Tour, signed off in style when he made yet another tricky birdie putt on the 18th to finish at seven-under. 

In all, he found 15 greens in regulation and needed just 26 putts to complete the round.

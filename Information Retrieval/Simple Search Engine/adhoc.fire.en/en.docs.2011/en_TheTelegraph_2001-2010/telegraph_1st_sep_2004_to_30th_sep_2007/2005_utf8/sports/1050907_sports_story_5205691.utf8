 Dar stands by decision

Lahore: Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar has brushed aside Australian captain Ricky Pontings tirade over his run out by a substitute English player in the fourth Ashes Test. 

Since Ponting got run out by a substitutes throw, the matter was blown up, Dar said ahead of the decisive fifth Test. But England were within the rules for having a substitute for injured Simon Jones.

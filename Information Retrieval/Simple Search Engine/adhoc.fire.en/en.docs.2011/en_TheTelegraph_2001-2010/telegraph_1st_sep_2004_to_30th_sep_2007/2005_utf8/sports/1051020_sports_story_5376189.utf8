 - Duleep Trophy - Focus on fit Sourav 

 Sourav 

Rajkot: The spotlight would be on Sourav Ganguly as the Bengal southpaw tries to find his form following his short injury lay-off when he leads East Zone in the Duleep Trophy tie for the first time against North Zone starting here on Thursday. 

Sourav, who missed the Challenger Trophy due to a tennis elbow, was declared fit by BCCI-appointed doctor Anant Joshi and Team India physio John Gloster on Tuesday in Mumbai and joined his teammates this morning for the pre-match practice session. Sourav will play in Duleep Trophy for the first time after 1996. 

In 1995-96 season Sourav smashed a sparkling 171 against West Zone in Nagpur and thereafter he managed to clinch a berth in the England-bound India squad where he scored century on debut. 

Sourav has a total of three centuries in Duleep Trophy. The other two being unbeaten 124 against West Zone in Guwahati in 1991 and again in 1995 against he scored 114 versus North Zone at the Eden. 

The match is crucial for Sourav who is striving to regain his berth in the one-day squad against Sri Lanka after not being considered for the first two matches of the seven-match series by the selection committee. 

This is my first domestic cricket meet of the season and I am looking forward to it to do well, he said on Wednesday. 

This wicket has always been a good batting wicket and it has been proved so by some high scoring international and domestic games, Sourav said. 

Besides Sourav, the East Zone outfit is depending on former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar, opener Shiv Sundar Das, Arindam Das and allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla to shore up the batting along with experienced wicketkeeper-batsman Deep Dasgupta. 

North zone, led by India discard Dinesh Mongia, have also some talented batsmen like Ravneet Ricky, Shikhar Dhawan, Yashpal Singh and ofcourse seasoned campaigner Pankaj Dharmani.

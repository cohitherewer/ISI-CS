 Fresh blow to Robinho

Madrid: Santos striker Robinhos move to Real Madrid has been rejected by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). 

We are informing you that it is impossible for us to send the International Transfer Certificate for Santos player Robinho, CBF general secretary Marco Antonio Teixeira wrote in a fax to the Spanish Football Federation. 

Santos will not accept the transfer without full payment of the buy-out clause in the contract, he said. (Reuters)

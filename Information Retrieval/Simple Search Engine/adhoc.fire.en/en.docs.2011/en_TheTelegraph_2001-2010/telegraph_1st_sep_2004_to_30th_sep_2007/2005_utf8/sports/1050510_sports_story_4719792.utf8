 Malik action okay: PCB

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board Monday said a biomechanics expert has cleared off-spinner Shoaib Malik six months after he was reported for suspect bowling action. 

?We sent Shoaib Malik to South Africa immediately after the Indian tour and the Sports Institute of South Africa has reported that he is bowling within the tolerance limit of 15 degrees which makes him available as a bowler on the West Indies tour,? Saleem Altaf, who is PCBs director cricket operations, said. 

Malik was banned October last year because of a suspect bowling action but Inzamam-ul Haq stunned everyone when he used the Sialkot-born player in the last four ODI against India. 

?Maliks major problem has been his doosra and he has not bowled it in the last four matches. We have not received anything from the International Cricket Council (ICC) that encourages us to use him more regularly in the forthcoming three-match one-day series,? Altaf.

 Rahman new heavyweight champion

Los Angeles: Hasim Rahman has received a majority of votes from the WBC board of governors to become the sanctioning bodys new heavyweight champion, the organisation has announced. 

The WBC said Rahmans advancement from interim champion to world champion will be made official when all of the votes have been compiled, but a ceremony is already planned to give Rahman the throne once owned by Vitali Klitschko. 

Ukranian Klitschko announced his retirement on Wednesday after suffering torn knee ligaments that would have postponed his fight against Rahman by at least nine more months, a fight already delayed three prior times since April. (AFP)

 Majola ?wants? 7 black players

 Durban: A fresh row is brewing in South Africa 

 following calls by the cricket board that at least 50 per 

 cent of players for the 2007 World Cup should be black. 

The call was made by UCBSA CEO Gerald Majola after the hosts thumped a nearly all-black Zimbabwean team in the first two ODIs. 

Majola said he would like to see seven black players in the national team while rejecting any form of tokenism. 

Some former players and current administrators said the call for 50 per cent of black players would really mean a ?quota? and this would drive many promising young white players out of the country. ?There will be seven black players in the national team on merit by 2007 and I don?t think there is a need to play the number game,? said South African A coach Mickey Arthur. 

?I hate it when people start playing with numbers. The danger is that black players who are chosen on merit, will be seen by the public as not being chosen on merit.?

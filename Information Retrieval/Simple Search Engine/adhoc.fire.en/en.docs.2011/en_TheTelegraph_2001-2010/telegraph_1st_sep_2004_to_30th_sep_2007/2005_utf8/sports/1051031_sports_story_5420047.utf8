 South Africa clinch series

Port Elizabeth: Powered by Herschelle Gibbs 81, South Africa eked out a four-wicket win over New Zealand on Sunday to take an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-match ODI series. Four balls remained when the winning run was hit. 

Earlier, South Africas in-form bowling attack limited New Zealand to 243 for nine in their 50 overs after the hosts won the toss and opted to field in the third one-day International on Sunday. 

Accurate bowling was backed by fine fielding as the New Zealand innings struggled to get going, with Stephen Fleming (54) and Scott Styris (78) the mainstays of their batting. 

Makhaya Ntini celebrated two wickets in his pacy opening spell, with Nathan Astle (11) and Lou Vincent (3) both caught behind the wicket as they were undone by deliveries that bounced more than expected. 

Hamish Marshall scored just seven before he edged Andre Nel to South African captain Graeme Smith at slip, but Fleming and Styris rebuilt the innings with a stand of 59 for the fourth wicket in 13.1 overs. 

Fleming was unfortunate to be run out when Styris straight drive off Justin Kemp deflected behind the bowler off his leg and onto the stumps, catching the Fleming backing up out of his crease. 

Styris attacked the bowling in the last 10 overs, hitting seven fours, but Charl Langeveldt bowled him when a wild swing across the line edged the ball into his own stumps.

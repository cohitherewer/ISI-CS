 England can lift World Cup, feels Beckham 

 Luck has eluded England in recent past, feels Beckham 

London: David Beckham is convinced England can lift the World Cup next summer if luck goes their way. 

England lost to Argentina at the last 16 stage of the 1998 World Cup, to Brazil in the quarter finals in 2002 and to Portugal in the Euro 2004 last eight. 

Captain Beckham told the BBC: I believe we have got a good chance. 

You need luck, something we didnt have in recent competitions when we scored goals that werent allowed. 

Beckham added Englands rivals are likely to be Argentina, France, Italy and Germany, but singled out Brazil as the biggest threat to Sven-Goran Erikssons side. 

Brazil are the best team in the world, said Beckham, who plays with Brazil internationals Ronaldo, Robinho and Roberto Carlos at Real Madrid. 

Theyve some of the best players in the world, Im lucky to play with them and I know how good they are. But were quietly confident if we come up against teams like that. 

Beckham believes Englands 3-2 friendly win over Argentina in Geneva in November has given the squad a renewed sense of confidence as they look forward to the finals which take place in Germany from June 9-July 9. 

That win finished the year off well for the national team and the manager. Argentina are rated the second best team in the world and theyve got greats like Juan Riqueleme. 

If we play like that and get the luck we need and stick together then who knows? The confidence was sky high after the game, so were quietly confident if we come up again teams like that, weve got that English mentality of never say die.

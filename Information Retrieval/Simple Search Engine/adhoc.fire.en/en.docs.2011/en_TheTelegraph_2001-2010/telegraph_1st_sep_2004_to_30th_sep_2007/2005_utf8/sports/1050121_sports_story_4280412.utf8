The Telegraph - Calcutta

 The pressure is all on Serena: Sania

Melbourne: The young shoulders of Sania Mirza will be carrying the expectations of over a billion fans back home when she turns up for the ?biggest match of her life? against the formidable Serena Williams in the third round of the Australian Open on Friday. 

 The odds may be heavily against the 18-year-old Indian wildcard, but Sania has raised hopes among even die-hard sceptics following her upset win over 84th ranked Petra Mandula in the second round of the season?s first Grand Slam on Wednesday. 

The ease with which she walloped the Hungarian in 50 minutes belied the fact that Sania was playing in her first-ever senior Grand Slam championship, although she is not exactly new to the big stage having won the junior doubles crown in Wimbledon in 2003. 

 Sania has already created history by becoming the first Indian women to reach the third round and is also assured of Aus $46,250 as prize money, but all that is behind her now and what awaits the 166th ranked Hyderabadi is another shot at unprecedented glory. 

 That her opponent, currently ranked seventh, is a former world No. 1 and former Australian Open champion (2003) makes her downright intimidating on court, but Sania exuded confidence ahead of the nerve-wracking clash saying all the pressure would be on the American. 

?Playing Serena is a dream which has come true. I have watched her play on television countless times. But there is no pressure on me, I have come here with no major expectations,? she said, adding that she would go into the match with an ?open mind? and play her natural game. 

The 18-year-old said she was not too worried about the outcome although she could not treat it like any other match. 

?I?m not very much worried, I will play my natural game and see what happens, I am not thinking too much about it. 

?Winning two rounds has been great, I am excited. This has been my attitude and though I cannot write off this match like any other match, I am not very much worried. In fact, I am looking forward to it.? 

Sania said she has been taking one match at a time. ?I have taken things step by step. I have learned to prepare match by match. I did not think beyond the first round match when I landed here.? 

The gulf between Sania and the 23-year-old Serena could not have been wider given their standings in world rankings and experience. But Sania has not been losing sleep thinking too much about all that ahead of the clash at the Vodafone Arena. 

?I had some practice, had a long walk and am now relaxing in the hotel,? said the player whose parents are in the holy city of Mecca to offer special prayers but plan to join her provided she advances to the final. 

?I had called my parents, who are on a Haj pilgrimage, after winning the second round match and took their blessings. It has been their effort along with my coaches? and well wishes of all friends besides my hard work that has brought me this far.? 

Asked if she had underwent any special preparation for her first Grand Slam as a senior, she said: ?It was the usual practice with (Mahesh) Bhupathi at home and abroad with Bob Brett. There was nothing extra that I did before this tournament.? (PTI)

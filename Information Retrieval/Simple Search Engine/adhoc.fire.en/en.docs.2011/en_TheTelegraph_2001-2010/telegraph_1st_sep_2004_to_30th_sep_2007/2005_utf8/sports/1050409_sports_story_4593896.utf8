Augusta (Georgia): American Ryder Cup player Chris DiMarco reeled off three consecutive birdies to move one shot clear in the weather-delayed US Masters first round Thursday. 

DiMarco, who teed off at the par-four 10th, picked up shots at the first, second and third to get to four under after 14 holes when fading light ended play for the day. 

Sixty-eight players were still out on the course when play was called off early, and resumed the opening round at Augusta National Friday. 

Some of the biggest names in golf were hot on DiMarco?s heels, though, with defending champion Phil Mickelson, world number one Vijai Singh and US Open title-holder Retief Goosen just two strokes adrift. 

Mickelson, who ended a 12-year wait for his first major victory at Augusta National last year, bounced back from an opening bogey to get to two under after 11 holes. 

Singh, Masters champion in 2000, was level with the American left-hander, also after 11, while Goosen had completed 13. 

Australia?s Mark Hensby, playing his first Masters, held the clubhouse lead on three-under-par 69 after mixing three birdies with a solitary bogey at the par-five eighth. 

Also at three under was another Masters debutant, British Ryder Cup player Luke Donald after 14 holes. 

?I?ve felt comfortable every year I?ve been here,? said DiMarco, who has produced three top-12 finishes at Augusta since making his debut in 2001. ?Again, this is the start of the race. This is a marathon and we have a long way to go. I?m going to have to play 22 holes Friday, and who knows what can happen out here.? 

It was not a day to remember for three-time winner Tiger Woods and world number three Ernie Els. 

Woods, chasing his first major title since the 2002 US Open, was two over after 12 holes, having bogeyed the par-five 13th where his 40-feet eagle putt rolled off the green into Rae?s Creek. 

The former world number one, who teed off at the tenth after a five and-a-half hour delay because of early morning thunderstorms and lightning, partially recovered with a birdie at the par-five 15th. 

He then dropped another shot at the par-four first to slip six strokes off the pace with six holes remaining. 

South African Els, runner-up a stroke behind the triumphant Mickelson at Augusta last year, was one of several players who battled as the gusting winds strengthened. 

The three-time major winner bogeyed the tenth, his first hole, the 11th, the 15th and 18th and was three over after 11. 

Three-time winner Nick Faldo pulled out after eight holes because of back spasms and 1970 champion Billy Casper also withdrew, after suffering the ignominy of recording the highest score in Masters history. 

The 73-year-old American battled to a 34-over-par 106 that included a record 11-over 14 at the par-three 16th. 

Earlier, play was put back five times by organisers due to the persistent threat of lightning before the first of the year?s four major championships eventually got under way with a two-tee start early in the afternoon.

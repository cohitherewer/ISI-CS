 Wenger mulls suit against Mourinho

 Arsene Wenger

London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is considering legal action against Jose Mourinho after the Chelsea coach launched an astonishing personal attack on the Frenchman. 

The volatile Mourinho said at the weekend that Wenger was a ?voyeur? with an unhealthy obsession in the English champions after the Arsenal manager said Chelsea might have lost their belief in themselves. 

?I find it out of order, disconnected with reality and disrespectful,? Wenger told reporters on Tuesday. 

?I will see if there is any action to be taken, I don?t know yet but this is a door that I leave open. 

?I don?t know what I said that was malicious. I was asked a question about Chelsea and gave my honest answer.? 

Under Mourinho, Chelsea have eclipsed Arsenal, the 2004 champions, and Manchester United who had dominated the Premier League before Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took over Chelsea in mid-2003. 

Wenger said on Friday that Chelsea had lost some of their belief after the champions drew with bottom club Everton and then lost on penalties to Charlton Athletic in the League Cup. 

He said the setbacks brought a little hope for those trying to catch Chelsea, who are nine points clear of their nearest rivals Wigan Athletic. 

Mourinho hit back at Wenger after Chelsea?s 4-2 victory over Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. 

The Portuguese coach said: ?I think Wenger has a real problem with us. I think he is one of those ? how do you call it in English ? voyeurs. 

?He is someone who likes to watch other people. 

?I don?t know what is happening to him, but I think he is in love with Chelsea, he loves us. Maybe he wants to leave Arsenal and come here and take my job. 

?There are some guys who, when they are at home they have this big telescope to see what happens in other families. He must be one of them. He is always speaking about other families. It is a sickness. Being a voyeur is a sickness.? 

Arsenal, three-time League champions since Wenger took over nine years ago, have made a stuttering start to the season and lie 14 points adrift of Chelsea in eighth place following a 1-1 draw at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend.

Calcutta: Douglas da Silva?s right shin bone, which was broken in a freak accident during Friday?s East Bengal versus Mahindra United NFL match, was operated upon on Saturday afternoon. 

The one-and-a-half-hour surgery was ?fairly routine and went off well,? according to Dr Buddhadeb Chatterjee, who headed the five-member team of doctors. 

The broken bone was brought into position through ?closed interlocked nailing?, which involves insertion of a titanium rod through the bone without actually cutting it open. 

?The fracture sight was not touched at all? this is the modern way of treating such cases,? explained East Bengal?s Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, who was part of the surgery panel. 

The others on the panel were Dr Ronen Roy, Ranjan Kamilya and Dr Saikat Sengupta. 

Douglas will be walking on crutches from Monday. Physiotherapy will also start in two days and he should be discharged from the hospital by Wednesday. 

Complete recovery will, however, take six months. ?I suspect he will be out of football for about six months? it usually takes that much time to recover fully from these type of surgeries,? said Dr Chatterjee, who was a member of the Dr Chittaranjan Ranawat-led medical panel which operated on former Atal Bihari Vajpayee five years ago. 

With spinal anaesthesia being used for the surgery, the East Bengal midfielder was in no discomfort after the operation. But the very fact that he will be out of action till August is paining him. 

?He is quite depressed as he feels his career is in jeopardy? but we have assured him the club is with him all through,? said an East Bengal official. 

Entry into his room was closely scrutinised. 

Among those who were by his side after the operation were fellow-Brazilians Marcos (his brother) and Juliano. 

Others who dropped in were Subhas Bhowmick, Dipak Mondal, Debjit Ghosh and Eduardo Coelho along with most East Bengal officials. 

East Bengal, meanwhile, have written to the AIFF seeking permission to register a foreigner for the NFL as replacement for Douglas. 

Each team is allowed to register three foreigners and East Bengal are now left with just two (Juliano and Ernest Jeremiah). 

East Bengal, who have 21 points from nine matches, next play Dempo in Margao on Thursday.

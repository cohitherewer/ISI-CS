 You cannot call this match a friendly: Ayala

Geneva: It is without question one of the classic matches in world football. It is one of the best games that can be seen on the planet. 

Not even the BBC could have done a better job of promoting Saturdays encounter between Argentina and England than Walter Samuel. Since qualifying for next summers World Cup at a canter, Argentina have been looking to flex their muscles on a broader stage and Saturdays showdown ? match seems too weak a word ? here raises the temperature in Buenos Aires in a way that their last friendly, in Hungary, and their next in Qatar, simply do not. 

Had the figure of Diego Maradona been sat in the Argentine dug-out, the symbolism of the fixture would have been more pronounced still. Maradona is in Switzerland but he is not expected to go anywhere near the Argentine dressing room, much to the relief of the national coach, Jose Pekerman. Maradona said Sunday: I do not wish to put this match in the shade. 

He is, however, expected to see Pekermans squad when they arrive in the Arabian Gulf next week for a much more low-key friendly in Qatar. As yet, the president of the Argentine FA, Julio Grondona, has said he is not quite sure what role Maradona will play in the build-up to next summers World Cup but he seemed enthused by the suggestion that the man who lifted the trophy in 1986 could manage the side after the tournament. 

[Maradona, however, said on Thursday he had turned down an offer to work with the Argentine national team. I dont think its the best moment to join the team, Maradona said in a radio interview. I want to make it clear that I dont want to get in anyones way, a Reuters report from Buenos Aires said on Thursday.] 

When discussing Argentina, Maradona reflected that there is something missing from this side and Englands attack, spearheaded by Wayne Rooney, may be exactly the kind of force to exploit it. 

Samuel and his partner in central defence, Roberto Ayala, both suggested they were the kind of immovable objects that the young Manchester United striker might struggle to come to terms with. 

Rooney is a tough forward who does not shirk a challenge, said Samuel, who spent a season at Real Madrid alongside David Beckham and Michael Owen before moving to Inter Milan. I want to mark him and I am not worried by any means. I have sufficient experience in Argentina, Italy and Spain and they do not call me The Wall for nothing. 

For Ayala, the fact he is captain of Argentina may not, at the age of 32, be enough to secure his passage to Germany. His form has been indifferent at Valencia and he has said publicly that he needs a solid display to reassure his critics. 

To mark Rooney will be a new experience for me. Neither of us will avoid a tackle and we both enjoy having the ball in the air. 

He is young but I have more experience and, afterwards, we will see who is singing victory songs in Switzerland. 

Although he is the most experienced member of Pekermans squad, Ayala was not even born when Sir Alf Ramsey declared that Argentina were animals and yet on Thursday he referred obliquely to the 1966 quarter-final. The spirit of Antonio Rattin is not dead. The games between England and Argentina have changed very much. Earlier, they accused us of kicking them and now I think we play a better game than England. 

This match is excellent for us. They say we need another type of opponent and, after dominating in South America, this is one of the most suitable. If we want to go to the World Cup in ideal form and have the potential to make something really big of the tournament, we have to face this type of team and not the mediocre sides. 

England are much more than Beckham, Owen and Lampard. They have a good set of names that will make it difficult for anyone. Since the two teams are preparing to go to the World Cup and want to win it, you cannot call this match a friendly.

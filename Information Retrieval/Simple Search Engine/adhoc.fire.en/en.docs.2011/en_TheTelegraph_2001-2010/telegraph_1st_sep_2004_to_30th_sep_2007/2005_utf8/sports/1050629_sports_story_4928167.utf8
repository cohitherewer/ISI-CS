 The arch-rivalry: Looking back

Brazil and Argentina have met 88 times, with 33 wins each in a rich footballing rivalry dating back to 1914. Wednesdays Confederations Cup final in Frankfurt will be their fourth meeting in Europe after three memorable World Cup encounters in 1974, 1982 and 1990. 

The following is a look at some key matches between the arch-rivals since they first met in Europe in the World Cup final in West Germany in 1974: 

 June 30, 1974 in Hanover: Brazil 2 Argentina 1 

Their first-ever meeting outside of South America ended with Brazil winning 2-1 in a second round group match in the World Cup finals. Brazil, the holders, took the lead with a left-footed thunderbolt from Rivelino from outside the box. 

Midfielder Miguel Angel Brindisi equalised with a fine free-kick that beat Leao and went in off the crossbar in the 35th minute for an Argentine side that included a young Mario Kempes. 

Jairzinho, like Rivelino a member of the great Brazilian side that won the title in 1970, struck the winner also from outside the box to send Brazil into a group decider, effectively a semi-final, with Johan Cruyffs Dutch total-football masters. 

 July 2, 1982 in Barcelona: Brazil 3 Argentina 1 

Another fine Brazilian side ended Argentinas reign as world champions with a 3-1 victory in their World Cup second round group match at the compact Sarria Stadium. It was 1978 title winning coach Cesar Luis Menottis last match in charge. 

Inspired by the great midfielders Falcao and Socrates, the Brazilians raced into a 3-0 lead with goals from Zico, Serginho and Junior. 

A frustrated 21-year-old Diego Maradona, reacting to a foul on fellow midfielder Juan Barbas, kicked an opponent and was sent off in the 85th minute. Striker Ramon Diaz scored a consolation goal for Argentina four minutes later and Brazil went on to a decider with Italy, which they lost 3-2. 

 24 June, 1990 in Turin: Argentina 1 Brazil 0 

Brazil were all over another Argentina side defending the World Cup who, having been upset 0-1 by Cameroon in the tournaments opening game, had scraped into the second round knockout match as a third-placed team from the group stage. But the Brazilians failed to convert their chances and Diego Maradona, hobbling on one good ankle, put Claudio Caniggia away with a sublime pass for the only goal 10 minutes from time. 

The match was in the news again recently because of the controversy of Brazil defender Branco allegedly drinking contaminated water from a bottle handed to him by the Argentine bench. 

Sebastiao Lazaronis side went home unexpectedly early for a Brazilian team while Maradona managed to inspire his troops all the way to a second successive final in Rome which they lost to West Germany. 

The following is a look at their five meetings this century: 

 July 26, 2000 in Sao Paulo: Brazil 3 Argentina 1 

Midfielder Vampeta scored twice as Brazil won 3-1 in the first-ever World Cup qualifier between the teams at Sao Paulos Morumbi Stadium. Alex stunned Argentina with an early goal and Vampeta scored either side of halftime with Matias Almeyda replying in between. 

The win provided brief respite for Brazil coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo. His side had lost 1-2 in Paraguay the week before and crashed 0-3 away to Chile in their next qualifier. 

 September 5, 2001 in Buenos Aires: Argentina 2 Brazil 1 

Argentina, already through to the 2002 World Cup, scored twice in the last 15 minutes to win 2-1 at the River Plate stadium and, incredibly, leave Brazil struggling to qualify. 

Brazil went ahead after three minutes with a bizarre wind-assisted own goal by Roberto Ayala but paid for an over-cautious approach. Midfielder Marcelo Gallardo equalised in the 77th minute and defender Cris headed into his own net with five minutes left. 

Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who had outraged public opinion back home by saying he would be happy to settle for a draw, criticised his players for not doing enough time-wasting. 

 June 2, 2004 in Belo Horizonte: Brazil 3 Argentina 1 

Ronaldo won and converted a hattrick of penalties while Juan Pablo Sorin, Argentinas Confederations Cup captain, pulled a goal back with a header in the 79th minute. 

The Real Madrid striker put the world champions ahead in the first half with a twice-taken penalty after being upended by Gabriel Heinze. Ronaldo stroked home his second in the 67th minute after being tripped by Javier Mascherano and completed his treble deep into injury time after falling over goalkeeper Pablo Cavalleros clumsy dive for the ball. 

 July 25, 2004 in Lima: Brazil 2 Argentina 2 

Less than two months after the Belo Horizonte game, Argentina outplayed Brazil for most of the Copa America final in Peru and led twice but conceded equalisers in the dying seconds of each half and ended up losing on penalties. 

Kily Gonzalez put Argentina ahead with a penalty in the 20th minute but the world champions levelled through Luisao in first-half injury time. Having scored what looked like a fine winner though Cesar Delgado with three minutes to go, Adriano equalised with the last kick of the game to pull off an unlikely 2-2 draw. 

 June 8, 2005 in Buenos Aires: Argentina 3 Brazil 1 

Argentina, who had lost 0-2 away to Ecuador four days earlier, were brilliant in the first half and scored three times before the break. 

Two goals by Hernan Crespo either side of a fine strike by playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme stunned the world champions who, after thumping Paraguay 4-1 three days earlier, produced a toothless first-half performance in which they had no answer to Argentinas biting tackles and swift passing. 

Brazil were a different team in the second half after surviving an early let-off when Dida parried a Kily Gonzalez shot and Roberto Carlos reduced the arrears in the 71st minute when he rifled in a 25-metre free kick. 

* Note: Should Wednesdays final go to penalties it will have been after the first periods of extra time ever played in a match between Argentina and Brazil. There is no extra time in the Copa America, in which the arch-rivals have reached three shootouts in the last 12 years. 

Brazil came out on top in the 1995 quarter finals in Uruguay and last years final in Peru after losing in their 1993 quarter final in Ecuador.

 Barranquilla: Colombia were untroubled at Barranquilla, while Ecuador buckled in 40 degree heat, coming down from altitude and their 2-0 upset of Argentina Saturday. 

Tressor Moreno scored two goals within the first nine minutes, and Martin Arzuaga completed the rout with another in the 70th. Juan Pablo Angel set up the last two. 

After crunching Peru 5-0 Saturday, Colombia have scored eight goals without conceding any in four days, indicating the rapid turnaround in fortune under former under-20 coach Reinaldo Rueda, who was appointed in January. Since then, they have won twice, drawn once, and lost to Argentina 0-1, but more importantly returned to qualifying contention. 

Paraguay returned home to Asuncion from their 4 spanking from Brazil to hand out the same punishment to Bolivia. Carlos Gamarras early header was quickly tied by Gonzalo Galindos 25 m blast for Bolivia, but Roque Santa Cruz broke the deadlock, and Julio Cesar and Jorge Nunez completed the rout before 17,000 happy fans at Defensores del Chaco Stadium. 

Chile stayed in the finals hunt and all but extinguished Venezuelas hopes in a comfortable 2-1 win in Santiago.

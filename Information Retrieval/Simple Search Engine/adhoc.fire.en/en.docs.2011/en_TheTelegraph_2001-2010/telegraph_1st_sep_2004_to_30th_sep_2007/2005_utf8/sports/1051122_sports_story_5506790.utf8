 Neelam fate by Nov. 29

New Delhi: The fate of discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh would be known in about a week as the final decision of the four-member panel hearing her doping case would be made by November 29. 

The four panelists would meet in Chennai during the junior national meet for final deliberations before reaching a decision, a source in the Athletics Federation of India said on Monday. 

The junior national meet would be held from November 25-29 and the panel headed by Walter Davaram, the president of Tamil Nadu Amateur Athletics Association (AFI), would meet on its sidelines before recommending their findings to the AFI. 

If found guilty of doping, Neelam faces a two-year ban. 

After the presentations by the athlete through her counsel Sushil Salwan, the panel had asked them to submit their arguments in writing. 

We have got all the information we need and do not foresee the need to call Neelam or Salwan for another hearing, one of the panelists, Girish Tyagi, secretary of the Delhi Medical Association said. (PTI)

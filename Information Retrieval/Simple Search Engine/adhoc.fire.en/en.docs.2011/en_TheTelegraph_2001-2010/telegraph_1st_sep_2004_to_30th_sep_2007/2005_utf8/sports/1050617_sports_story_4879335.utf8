 Sania up against Morigami 

London: Sania Mirza, going through a lean patch of late, will face Akiko Morigami of Japan in her first round singles tie at Wimbledon starting here next Monday. 

The tie may seem an easy one for the Indian sensation, but 72nd ranked Sania needs to be on guard against her 25-year-old opponent who had made it to the third round of the French Open last month. 

If Sania, who was knocked out in the first round at the Rolland Garros, gets past the 64th ranked Morigami, she is most likely to face US Open winner Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia in the next round. 

The fifth-seeded Russian, who will meet unheralded Rebecca Llewellyn of Great Britain in her opening clash at the All England Tennis Club, had lost to Sania in the Dubai Open in April.

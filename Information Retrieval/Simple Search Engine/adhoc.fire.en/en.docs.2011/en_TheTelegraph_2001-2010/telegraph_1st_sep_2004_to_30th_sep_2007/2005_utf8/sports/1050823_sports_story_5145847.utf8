 Jordans new car may debut at Monza

London: Jordan plans to give their heavily-revised car its race debut at Monza next week, after weeks of teething problems. 

The Silverstone-based Formula One team will give the Toyota-powered EJ15B its first full test at the Italian Grand Prix this week before a final decision. 

The cars debut has been delayed repeatedly since the original target of the French Grand Prix on July 3. 

We hope to close the gap to the other teams, said Indian driver Narain Karthikeyan. Weve had problems with cooling and stuff but the car is very compact, very nicely done. 

Touch wood, if we dont have any problems we will race it at Monza. The simulations say it is a big improvement from the current car but really until you are on the circuit you cant really know. 

We expect (an improvement of) seven 10ths (of a second) out of it. If we have one second we will be really happy. 

Jordan is currently ninth in the 10-team championship. 

Meanwhile, McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa, on Monday accused Renault of using illegal team orders to help Alonso take second place on Sunday. A Renault team member was heard telling Alonso by radio on lap two, when he was in third place and behind Italian teammate Giancarlo Fisichella: Fernando, youre faster than Fisi, overtake him. 

What they told Alonso on the radio is a clear example of what is illegal, those were 100 percent team orders, said De la Rosa. The message was very clear: overtake him. What could not be heard was what they told Fisichella before that.

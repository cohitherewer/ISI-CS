 Amritraj plans 3 academies 

Dubai: Former Indian Davis Cup star and captain Vijay Amritraj is confident that his plans to set up a series of tennis academies in three countries will materialise soon. 

A tennis academy here looks very feasible. Most probably, it will start in India and Singapore, then dubai would follow, amritraj said. 

Amritraj was here to visit the Dubai Aid City and the Dubai Humanitarian City in his role as the United Nations messenger of peace. 

I view sports as the biggest and most effective means of communication, the US-based Amritraj said. 

Whatever sport you choose, you can be sure of a healthy life, and secondly, there is the element of education in it, he said. 

Sport is the worlds greatest form of communication. Its so much like music, and it is also a fabulous way of bringing up a child. Sport teaches you everything. 

Amritraj, who founded the now-extinct BAT Academy in Chennai, said: Techniques in tennis have changed so much. The last I played at Wimbledon was in 1990. Things have changed so much since then that I look so outdated when on court. 

There is a need to teach todays youngsters new skills and how the game has to be played. My son is playing tennis and it seems he lies between yesterdays and todays tennis, he said.

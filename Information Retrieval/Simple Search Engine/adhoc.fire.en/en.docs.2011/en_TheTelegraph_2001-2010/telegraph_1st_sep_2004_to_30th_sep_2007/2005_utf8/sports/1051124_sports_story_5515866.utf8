 Jaffer cracks double century

New Delhi: Test discard Wasim Jaffer scored a brilliant unbeaten double ton to guide Mumbai to a strong position on the first day of the Elite group A Ranji Trophy at the Ferozeshah Kotla here Wednesday. 

When play was stopped due to bad light, Mumbai were sitting pretty on 329 for the loss of two wickets with Jaffer batting on 206 and Amol Muzumdar unbeaten on a slow paced 93. 

Mumbai suffered early jolts after choosing to bat first as Kunal Lal claimed two wickets, exploiting the seaming conditions in the morning session. He sent back Vinayak Mane (7), caught by Sarandeep Singh at point in the fourth over to give Delhi the first breakthrough. 

Two overs later, Lal struck again to claim the wicket of Vineet Indulkar (4), who was caught behind at the team total of 23. At this point, Mumbai needed a solid partnership to stabilise their innings and Jaffer and Muzumdar took up the responsibility well. 

Jaffer reached his century in 175 balls while he scored his double hundred in quicker time, consuming 266 balls in 352 minutes. His entertaining innings contained 28 boundaries and three sixes. 

At the Karnail Singh Stadium, Karnataka gained a stranglehold on defending champions Railways. 

Mudiumpacer Vinay Kumar responded to Karnatakas decision to make use of an unusually green-tinged wicket by grabbing three for 30 and reducing the hosts to 186 for five. 

Anil Kumble, returning to action after a two-month rest to treat his lower back, bowled 17 overs on the trot in his first spell conceding 28 runs. Later, he had Ali caught at first slip with nine more overs to go for close.

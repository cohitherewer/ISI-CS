The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav uncertain for Sydney

 - Captain may go to Mohali 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Its not 

 official, but there are indications that the Board may advise 

 Sourav Ganguly to skip the ICC captains conclave in 

 Sydney on October 12 (not 11) and, instead, play the Challenger 

 Trophy in Mohali. 

 The position will be clear 

 by Saturday. If Sourav doesnt go, then Rahul Dravid 

 is going to be Indias nominee, a well-placed 

 source told The Telegraphlate on Thursday. 

Dravid will, in any case, be in Sydney at that time for the Super Series. 

The Challenger is going to be held between October 10-13 and its likely that the captain for the ODIs versus Sri Lanka is going to be named on the last day. 

 If thats done, the squad for the seven-match 

 series will be picked a day later.

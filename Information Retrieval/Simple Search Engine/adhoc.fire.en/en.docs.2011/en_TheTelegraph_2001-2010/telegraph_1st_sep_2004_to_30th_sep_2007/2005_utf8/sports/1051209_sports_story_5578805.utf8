 Tough for Bengal 

 - RANJI TIE vs MUMBAI 

 Ravi Shastri gave a pep talk to Mumbai 

Mumbai: High-flying Bengal, the Ranji Trophy elite division group A leaders with seven points in their kitty, would be up against 36-time champions Mumbai in the four-day league clash here from Friday. 

The visitors have done well in their opening two league clashes against Maharashtra and Delhi, significantly both away from home. 

But they have a tough task on hand to repeat the performance against the Nilesh Kulkarni-led Mumbai, who have four points to their credit after taming Delhi, especially in the absence of Sourav Ganguly. 

Mumbai have the batting strength, banking on opener Wasim Jaffer, who has the penchant for making tall scores, talented youngster Vineet Indulkar, seasoned campaigner Amol Muzumdar and stocky allrounder Ramesh Powar. 

Bengals hopes lie in batting first and making a big total to put the onus on the hosts to chase it on a Wankhede Stadium wicket that generally tends to get slower and offer lower bounce as the match progresses. 

The visitors top order batting, in the absence of Sourav, appears a bit thin and over-dependent on Rohan Gavaskar. 

But their bowling ? spearheaded by the well-built Shib Shankar Paul and supported by Ranadeb Bose and slow bowler Sourashish Lahiri ? looks capable of applying the brakes on Mumbai batsmen. 

Interestingly, Bengal have hired former Mumbai pacer Paras Mhambrey as their coach for the season while the hosts have got former India left-arm pacer Karsan Ghavri, last seasons Bengal coach, for the same job. 

Mumbai, who had requested Sunil Gavaskar to give a pep talk to their squad before the commencement of the season, roped in another former captain Ravi Shastri to do likewise on Thursday. 

Teams (from): 

Bengal: Deep Dasgupta (captain), Arindam Das, Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Subhomoy Das, Saurasish Lahiri, Shib Sankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose, Manoj Tewari, Sib Sagar Singh, Wriddhiman Saha, Asok Dinda, Avishek Jhunjhunwala. 

Mumbai: Nilesh Kulkarni (captain), Wasim Jaffer, Sahil Kukreja, Vineet Indulkar, Nishit Shetty, Amol Mujumdar, Vinayak Samant, Ramesh Powar, Onkar Khanvilkar, Usman Malvi, Swapnil Hazare, Wilkin Mota, Avishkar Salvi, Abhijit Shetye, Bhavin Thakkar.

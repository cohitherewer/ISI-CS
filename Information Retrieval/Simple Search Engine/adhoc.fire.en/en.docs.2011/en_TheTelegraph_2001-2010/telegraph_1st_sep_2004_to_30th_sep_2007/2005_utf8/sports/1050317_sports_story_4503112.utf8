The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I was in control throughout?

 - It?s always nice to do well at Eden: Dravid 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rahul Dravid believes he was in control right through his 110 and that not always has he been in such form. ?I quite enjoyed the rhythm that I had throughout the day. I was in control throughout my innings. 

?There are a lot of days when you can turn up and score a hundred but still not feel in control and have to fight very hard. Today I was somehow in control right from the start and in that sense it was pleasing? It was fluent,? Dravid said on Wednesday. 

Dravid even recalled that it wasn?t the same during his 180 versus Australia in 2001. ?In that innings, I was definitely not in control throughout. Even in the last match I felt I was in good control till I reached 39, but then when I came back on the next day it just wasn?t there.? 

The vice-captain was upset about his dismissal in the last ball of the opening day. 

?It?s not nice to get out in the last over of the day. It?s also disappointing because I think it?s important for us to get about 100 more runs.? 

He said he savoured the atmosphere here. ?It?s always nice to do well here. It?s a place I?ve always done well. I have very fond memories of the ground and if we can get a good result out of this game it will be great.? 

But did the players have any special strategy against Danish Kaneria? ?There was no specific strategy to score fast. The pitch was good and the outfield fast. We got a very good start from (Virender) Sehwag and (Gautam) Gambhir and the rest of us just wanted to build on the momentum. 

?I have some thoughts and plans for virtually every player I play against. You think about what shots to play, what areas you can score in and what shots not to play... After doing the homework, you know the strengths and weaknesses of each bowler.? 

Dravid also did not wish to compare the 10,000 club members. quot;All of them are great? I hate judging and comparing people. Its been great playing along with Sachin and against Steve Waugh and Brian Lara? Of course, watched Sunil Gavaskar? 

But does he plan to set himself a timeframe for his 10,000 runs? ?There?s no timeframe. The next thing is to play the next innings and get off the mark,? quipped Dravid.

 Beckham doubtful over future at Real 

 Beckham feels paparazzi is crossing the line 

Manchester: David Beckham has put a question mark over his future at Real Madrid after two of his children were targeted by the paparazzi. 

The England captain told reporters on Wednesday of two incidents earlier this month which he felt went beyond what was acceptable even for such a high-profile player and his wife, former Spice Girl Victoria. 

?I?m at the point where I don?t know what to do, because it?s my children now and that?s different,? Beckham said at the England team hotel ahead of Saturday?s World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland. 

?I?ve had a couple of incidents in the last two weeks that have made me sit back and think. I believe that when my children are going to primary school, nursery or football school they should be left alone. And they?re not. And they?re not even with their parents. 

?So, for me, it?s becoming a big problem,? said the 29-year-old father of three. 

Detailing the recent incidents, Beckham said: ?My eldest son, Brooklyn, goes to a football school. I was working at the time and Victoria was working, or looking after Cruz, and paparazzi showed up and harassed him and chased him into the football school. 

?This is a six-year-old little boy. For me, that?s crossing the line. And, of course, that affected him. 

?Romeo was going to his nursery and the press were taking pictures of him while he was playing with the other kids. And, for me, that?s crossing the line with my children.?

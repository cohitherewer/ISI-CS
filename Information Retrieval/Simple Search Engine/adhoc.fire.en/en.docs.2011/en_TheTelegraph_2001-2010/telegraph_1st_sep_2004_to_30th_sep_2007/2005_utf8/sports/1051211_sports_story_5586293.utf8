 Historic win for NZ

 - World record victory chase in 100th ODI vs Australia 

 Scott Styris on way to his century on Saturday 

Christchurch: A Scott Styris century and a whirlwind 50 by Brendon McCullum steered New Zealand to a shock two-wicket victory over Australia in a world record one-day International performance at Jade Stadium here on Saturday. 

New Zealands 332 for eight was the highest winning score by the team batting second in the history of the limited-overs game, and was achieved with an over to spare. 

A single to captain Daniel Vettori off the last ball of the 49th over, which cost Australian bowler Mick Lewis 20 runs, sealed victory and eclipsed the previous best run chase of 330 for seven set by Australia against South Africa in 2002. 

Although Australia still won the Chappell-Hadlee series 2-1, New Zealand ended a record-equalling seven-match home losing streak and exposed deficiencies in Australias inexperienced bowling line up. Styris did the groundwork with his 101, departing with the score at eight for 258, and it was left to powerful hitting by McCullum and Vettori to smash the remaining 74 runs in just 36 balls. 

McCullum took 50 off 25 balls, including three fours and four sixes, while Vettoris 23 came from 12 deliveries. 

After Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey had set up Australias imposing 331 total, New Zealand made a rocky start in reply. 

Usual skipper Stephen Fleming, who was named a super sub after missing a month of international cricket while recovering from surgery, made a disappointing return. 

After sitting out of the New Zealand fielding effort, he faced just nine balls at the head of the batting line-up before edging Nathan Bracken to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist without scoring. 

Wickets fell at regular intervals, but the home sides fortunes began to change with the arrival of Jacob Oram at the crease to join Styris when New Zealand were 194 for six in the 33rd over. 

The two allrounders lifted the pace to more than a run-a-ball as Styris posted his third century and one of Orams two sixes went out of the ground. Glenn McGrath did not make the tour and Brett Lee, who tormented the New Zealand batsmen in the first two matches, returned home before the final match of the series. 

This was the 100th ODI between New Zealand and Australia, with Australia having won 70.

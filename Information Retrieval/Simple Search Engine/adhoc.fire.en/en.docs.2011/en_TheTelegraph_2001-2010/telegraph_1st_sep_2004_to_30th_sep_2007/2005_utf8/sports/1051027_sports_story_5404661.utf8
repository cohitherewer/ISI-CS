 West Indies set to field full-strength 

 side

 Shivnarine Chanderpaul wants everybody to have a go 

Sydney: West Indies will field a full-strength team for the opening match of their tour of Australia in a bid to overcome a lack of practice before next weeks Test. 

They took a second-string side on their last tour, to Sri Lanka in July, after several regulars, including Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle, refused to play because of a contract dispute. The West Indies squad in Australia contains only a handful of survivors from the team beaten 0-2 in the Sri Lanka Test series. 

West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul said the tourists would have preferred at least two warm-up matches but had to make do with one four-day match against Queensland, starting on Thursday. 

We want everybody to have a go and there is (only) one game before the Test match, Chanderpaul said. You want everybody to have a shot at it and a little bit of time before the game. But its okay. We have another one after the first Test. 

The first Test starts in Brisbane on November 3, followed by a three-day match against Victoria state then the second Test in Hobart. 

A Queensland side stacked with eight current or former internationals should provide the tourists with a stiff workout. 

THE SQUADS 

West Indies: Shivnarine Chanderpaul (captain), Chris Gayle, Wavell Hinds, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Brian Lara, Dwayne Bravo, Denesh Ramdin, Tino Best, Fidel Edwards, Jermaine Lawson, Daren Powell, Corey Collymore, Marlon Samuels. 

Queensland: Jimmy Maher (captain), Matthew Hayden, Martin Love, Shane Watson, Andrew Symonds, James Hopes, Chris Hartley, Chris Simpson, Andrew Bichel, Ryan Le Loux, Mitchell Johnson, Michael Kasprowicz. (Reuters)

 Harmison has been a disappointment 

 - Englands first innings failure may haunt them 

 Justin Langer after reaching his century on Saturday 

England are looking down the barrel and were saved by the rain and bad light on Friday. Despite the weather, they are still in some trouble and need something extraordinary to happen if they are to stay in the match. 

Australia are getting themselves into a good position and, if they get at least a 100-run lead, then we will see England under pressure against Shane Warne. And we all saw what happened at Trent Bridge when England were put under pressure batting last. 

We need more rain and bad light in order to take time out of the match. That is why I couldnt understand Australias decision to go off for bad light. 

They could have had England in serious trouble and it was quite extraordinary that Australia went off, especially as they are the team that has to win this match. 

With more rain forecast, the match may be curtailed again and Australia could run out of time. I know it was a bit dark on Friday afternoon but I would have expected them to have a couple of overs in that light to see if they could pick up the ball. 

As long as they could see the ball, it was in their interests to stay out there and try to get as many runs as possible ? and give themselves enough time to bowl England out. 

I remember playing for Yorkshire and Brian Close standing in the dressing room and telling us not to come off for bad light. What, even if you cant see it? I said to him. If you cant see it then play where you think it is, he said. 

That is why I was so surprised at Australias decision. As Close used to say: If you want to win the match then you stay on the field. And I bet England were delighted to get off. 

In cricket you always should do what the opposition least want you to do, and for England that would have meant Australia staying out there and scoring runs. 

Steve Harmison has been a disappointment. He is doing his best but its not quite working for him. The great bowler who terrified the West Indies last year is missing. The fire and brimstone has gone. You can never fault the lad for effort but he is just lacking something. Matthew Hoggard bowled well. He swung the ball but the Aussie openers are playing swing a lot better now. They deliberately played the ball later which is the way to combat swing. 

Without Simon Jones, England did not have a back-up option and they have really missed him. Andrew Flintoff bowled aggressively and tried to make things happen but Englands bowling has been very similar to Australias. 

The quick bowlers in both sides have lacked penetration but the difference between England and Australia, is that the Aussies can call on a great spinner. 

The pitch is still fantastic to bat on. A score of 450 was minimum for England as the outfield is the quickest in the country, and though the pitch is not as fast as normal it still has plenty of bounce. 

There was no seam movement and the Australians did not have too much trouble in putting on their best batting display of the summer. Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer have put on their first 100-run partnership of the series and both played well. 

Due to his lack of form this summer, Hayden has had to change his game and it worked for him on Friday. He has gone back to an old-fashioned style of approach in trying to bat carefully and be a little more subdued. 

Over the last couple of years he has dominated Test cricket by bullying the bowlers and attacking them mercilessly. He has tried to get on top of them from the word go, but has realised that doesnt work against this England attack. 

Hayden would have been very grateful to Langer on Friday, as he was no doubt a steadying influence. Together they have given Australia the platform to go for victory and build a substantial lead over England. 

The failure of our batsmen to make the most of first use of this pitch is something that may come back to haunt us over the next couple of days. We missed an opportunity to take control of the match and take a significant step closer to winning the Ashes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians ready for a fresh challenge

 - SA caught in debate as to who should be prime target 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Hyderabad: The South Africans have been undefeated in 19 ODIs; the Indians thrashed Sri Lanka 6-1 in a series where the visitors were strongly fancied. On the face of it, the five-match face-off beginning Wednesday should be explosive, but the South Africans havent had time to acclimatise and generally dont travel well to the sub-continent. 

If momentum and home conditions make a difference, then its difficult to look beyond India for the Pepsi Cup. The South Africans are No. 2 in the ICC standings, but even the Lankans were ranked that high on arrival. In just over a fortnight, though, they stumbled two places. 

The Indians have remained at No. 7, but the chance to climb is at hand and captain Rahul Dravid is determined not to slip. Yet, he cautioned that the performance need not be judged by results only. 

The all-out assault as also the innovations, in the very first ODI (Nagpur), caught Maravan Atapattu and his men on the wrong foot. They tripped and, as the scoreline shows, never recovered. 

One expects coach Greg Chappell to plot something similar. Given that this isnt a seven-match series, whoever starts all guns blazing is bound to enjoy a headstart. Incidentally, as part of strategy, Dravid didnt reveal the three players certain to miss out. 

If thats part of the mind games, Dravid may actually have some advantage as he had the opportunity to study how Graeme Smiths mind works (or, for that matter, doesnt) during last months Super Test in Sydney. He was the South Africans World XI deputy. 

Dravid, however, insisted he didnt have enough time to mind-read. Laughing, he told The Telegraph: I dont think its possible to form an opinion so quickly... In any case, I wouldnt say I study minds... 

Smith, though, must be desperate to read Dravids mind ? specifically, who will he send at No. 3? Ranchi blaster Mahendra Singh Dhoni or Baroda dynamite Irfan Pathan? Purely to surprise, Dravid could himself do the honours. 

The Indian captain, of course, cant understand this fuss. 

I know theres a lot of excitement over that position, but were just trying to be flexible... In fact, weve tried different players at No. 4 as well. In Vadodara, for example, Dhoni was sent at that number, Dravid said. 

Asked what would be his message for the team, days after an unprecedented triumph, he replied: To continue with the same spirit and attitude... The players need to grow individually and the team collectively... Our aim is to get better and accept fresh challenges. 

Dravid saluted Chappell (and sports scientist Ian Frazer) when he spoke of some ideas and some thoughts beginning to take root and the players understanding them better. Not that the coachs ideas and thoughts have lacked credibility, but it does make a difference when the captain endorses unequivocally. 

The South Africans, meanwhile, appear to be caught in the debate over who should be their prime target: Sachin Tendulkar or Dhoni? Focussing on or two players isnt short of hazardous and it can allow a Virender Sehwag or Dravid himself to make the biggest impression. 

Smith, by the way, felt the current Indian team seemed to have more energy. He was drawing a comparison with what he saw during last years two-Test series. His own priority, understandably, is to get his teams game right. 

 The series takes off at the still-being-completed Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, which is around 20 kms from where the teams are staying. Till the other day, it was named after a key sponsor, but the state government sought a change. 

All 27,000-plus seats are expected to be occupied and the Hyderabad Cricket Association needs to be applauded for realising a dream. Thanks in no small measure to Shivlal Yadavs efforts (and support from the previous government), a world class structure is in place. 

The dressing rooms, for example, are mind blowing. 

The wicket, which had some grass, has attracted much attention. Smith maintained the toss would be crucial, while Dravid felt the wicket would hold good through the day. So far, only one first-class fixture has been played ? that, too, last season. 

Yadav confirmed one of Hyderabads icons till he got sucked into the match-fixing controversy ? Mohammed Azharuddin ? would be invited to whats going to be a historic day for the cricket fraternity here.

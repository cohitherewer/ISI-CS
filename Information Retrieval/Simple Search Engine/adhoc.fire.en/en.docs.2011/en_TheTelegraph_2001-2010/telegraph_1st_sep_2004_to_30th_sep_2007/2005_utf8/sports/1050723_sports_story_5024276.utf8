 Lid off Warnes latest sexploit

London: Shane Warne at it again! 

There seems to be no end to Warnes off-field sexploits with a woman accusing the star leg-spinner, on the eve of the ongoing first Ashes Test, of pleading with her to urge his wife Simone to join in threesome sex sessions in a bid to save his marriage. 

Warnes proposal came on June 21, just weeks after his wife and their three children had moved to Britain to be with him, a daily reported. 

Rebecca Weedon, a 20-year-old archaeology student revealed that the Aussie cricketer coached her on how to get unwitting wife Simone to agree to the session by pretending to be an obsessed fan who stumbled across the couple in a bar. 

Weedon said Warne tried to convince her that he was doing it to save his 10-year-old marriage which was on the brink of collapse. 

But then he said they were giving it another try and thought a threesome might help, she was quoted as saying. He had scripted the whole lot, what he wanted me to say and do. He said he would take his wife for a drink and I was to come over pretending to be a starstruck fan. 

I didnt say no. I dont think I said anything, I was just so shocked.

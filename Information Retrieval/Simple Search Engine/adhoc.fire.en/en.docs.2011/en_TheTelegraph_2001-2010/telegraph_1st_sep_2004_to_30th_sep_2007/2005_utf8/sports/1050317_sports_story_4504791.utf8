EDEN DIARY

Our Staff Reporters 

Chachas day out 

 Can you recall the picture of the bearded Pakistani supporter who was always 

visible on television during an India-Pakistan showdown in Sharjah? Well, hes 

here and if you wish to meet him, you must be at the Eden. 

 Abdul Jalil, commonly known as Chacha was a surprise 

and perhaps the lone supporter of Inzamam-ul Haq and Co. in the second Test. This 

is his maiden visit to the ground. Its a thrilling experience to be 

in this ambience its so touching, Jalil, who tours with the 

Pakistani side almost around the globe, said on Wednesday. Pakistan Cricket 

Board (PCB) has helped me a lot in this regard, he added. 

 Interestingly, he came here as a guest of Punjab government and is staying 

at the Punjab Bhavan. He came to the Eden without a ticket and its only 

after CABs initiatives did he finally get a seat. 

On a small screen 

 You will call it a giant screen, but not before wondering whether its 

worth having such an adjective attached to it. 

 The early birds at Eden Gardens on Wednesday woke up to the pictures of Virender 

Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir walking to the middle on a little screen at the north-east 

corner of the stadium. It, however, remained inactive during a significant part 

of first days action. Replays of dismissals were not shown on it. But there 

was enough crowd cheer whenever a decision was refereed to the third umpire. 

 According to a CAB official: It is basically on trial, but we have a 

plan to make it bigger, around 300 sq. ft.

Eden fails to deliver 

 Is the Eden no more a crowdpuller? There will certainly be divided opinions 

but the Eden hardly lived up to its reputation as a jam-packed stadium on Wednesday. 

Its an India-Pakistan Test going on, yet the first day witnessed a maximum 

of 40,000 attendance. 

 On the opening day of the last Test played here between India and South 

Africa in November-December, 2004 there were several empty stands. On Wednesday, 

however, there were crowds scattering here and there. There was also mere presence 

of spectators at the stands, allotted for daily tickets. 

 The organisers CAB is blaming it on several factors heat and examinations 

being the key among them.

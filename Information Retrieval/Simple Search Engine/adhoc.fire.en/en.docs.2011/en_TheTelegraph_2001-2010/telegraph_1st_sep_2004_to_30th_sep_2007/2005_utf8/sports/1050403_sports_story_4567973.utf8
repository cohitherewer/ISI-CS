 Survival fight for Vasco, Churchill

Margao: Churchill Brothers and Vasco will fight for survival when they meet in a 15th round match of the National Football League at the Nehru Stadium here Sunday. 

Churchill, placed tenth with 13 points from 14 matches, would be without defenders Satish Bharti and Subhasis Roy Chowdhury through double bookings, while Vasco were a place behind with 12 points from same number of matches. 

?We have no option but to win from now on if we are to escape relegation and our boys are focussed on winning tomorrow?s match,? Churchill team manager Santiago said. 

Having lost to Churchill 1-2 in the first leg, Vasco need to tighten up their defence and sharpen their striking prowess if they are to collect full points. ?It?s a crucial match for our team survival and our boys are ready to fight to the end to collect full points,? Vasco coach Derrick Pereira said. (PTI)

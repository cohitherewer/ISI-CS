 Uefa chiefs hint augurs well for Liverpool

 Lennart Johansson says the winners should have a chance to defend the title 

London: Uefa president Lennart Johansson has dropped the biggest hint yet that Liverpool will be allowed to defend their Champions League title next season. 

Liverpool, who beat AC Milan on penalties in Wednesdays final after trailing 0-3 at half-time, did not qualify for next seasons tournament after only finishing fifth in the English Premier League. 

In a report in an English paper, however, Johansson said the matter would have to be resolved as a matter of urgency. 

The winners should have a chance to defend the title, he said. We must sit down as a matter of real urgency to see if there is a fair way to make it happen. If there is a rule that harms the tournament, we have to discuss changing that rule. 

Uefa has previously said the decision would ultimately be made by the English FA which has consistently maintained that the top four clubs in the Premier League would qualify for the Champions League. 

Liverpools city rivals Everton finished fourth in the league ? the final qualification spot. 

Johansson criticised the FA for its reluctance to take the initiative in dealing with the situation. 

So far the FA is not helping us find a solution. I can ask what the hell is happening in England right now, it seems the Premier League is taking over everything. 

A similar situation occured in Spain five years ago when Real Madrid finished fifth in the Primera Liga but won the Champions League. 

On that occasion, the Spanish authorities entered Real into the following seasons Champions League at the expense of Real Zaragoza who finished fourth in the league. 

Such an outcome in England would be extremely unpopular, particularly with Everton who were in the top four places for much of the season. 

According to the report, Uefa is expected to resolve the matter within the next 10 days. 

Uefa chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson said: We will arrange a telephone conference because the urgency of the situation is too important to wait until we could get the full (Uefa) committee together. 

Uefas executive committee is due to meet in Manchester on June 17.

London: Arsenal?s slim hopes of retaining the Premier League title faded again on Saturday when they were held to a 1-1 draw in an entertaining game at Southampton. 

The Gunners looked set to leapfrog Manchester United into second place after Freddie Ljungberg?s 45th-minute goal put them ahead against a side reduced to 10 men by the sending-off of midfielder David Prutton. 

Arsenal forward Robin van Persie was then needlessly dismissed after receiving his second yellow card after 50 minutes to hand Southampton a lifeline. 

The hosts levelled on 67 minutes when towering striker Peter Crouch headed in after goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had flapped at Jamie Redknapp?s corner. 

Arsenal would have won but for inspired Saints goalkeeper Paul Smith, who kept out late efforts from Thierry Henry, Ljungberg and Ashley Cole. Cole also had a stoppage-time header disallowed for offside, while Crouch wasted a couple of chances to earn Southampton a victory that would have lifted them out of the bottom three. 

Southampton manager Harry Redknapp said he was satisfied with a draw, the club?s ninth in 11 home games, although he was furious with Prutton whose second wild tackle resulted in Arsenal?s Robert Pires being carried off on a stretcher with a gashed ankle. 

?Prutton had no need to tackle Pires,? Redknapp said. ?It was a foolish thing to do and I?ve got no sympathy for him at all, we were playing well at that stage and it left us in big trouble.? 

Arsenal stay third on 58 points, one behind Manchester United. Leaders Chelsea, who play Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday, have 68 points. 

Fourth-placed Everton consolidated the final Champions League qualification spot with an impressive 3-1 victory at Aston Villa - their first at Villa Park since 1987. 

Crystal Palace improved their chances of avoiding relegation as Andy Johnson scored two penalties in a 2-0 victory at home to his former club Birmingham City. Palace have 25 points, four better off than Southampton. 

Substitutes Frederic Kanoute and Robbie Keane scored late goals to earn Tottenham Hotspur a 2-0 victory over Fulham as they moved up to eighth. (Reuters)

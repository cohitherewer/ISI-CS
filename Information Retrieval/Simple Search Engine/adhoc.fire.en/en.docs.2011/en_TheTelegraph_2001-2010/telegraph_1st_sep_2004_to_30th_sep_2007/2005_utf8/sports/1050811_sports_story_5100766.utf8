The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India possibly the worst fielding side

 Straight 

 Talk 

 Arjuna Ranatunga

 India could be the worst fielding 

 side in world cricket at present. They allowed extra runs 

 in the field during the tri-series final against Sri Lanka 

 and when it came to themselves, lost a few while running 

 between the wickets. Add up all those and you have the difference 

 between winning and losing.

 There were those two regulation 

 chances in the slips, which were dropped off Sanath Jayasuriya. 

 It was the surest way to invite disaster.

 Virender Sehwag has let go a few 

 in the field in this tournament and I am not sure if Rahul 

 Dravids presence in the slips could have counted.

 He is one of the best slips fieldsman 

 and you do not catch over hundred scalps in that position 

 without being special. But he needed to man his players 

 from the mid-wicket and took himself out of the cordon.

 In a way, it was ironic that a 

 bit of smart fielding ejected Jayasuriya from the middle. 

 India must count themselves lucky, for Jayasuriya had set 

 himself up for an innings of 150 or 160 runs. He was in 

 a groove and was bisecting the field with his customary 

 precision.

 Along with Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah 

 Muralidharan, Jayasuriya was one of the three senior-most 

 cricketers who mattered for Sri Lanka in the night. These 

 three are of timeless quality, the rocks who have braved 

 the onslaught of faster, fitter and stronger one-day cricket 

 from one decade to another.

 India should have been alert to 

 these formidable men. Instead, we had a Sehwag who wanted 

 to take on Vaas, the number one bowler in one-day cricket 

 right now.

 Sehwag needed to make a difference 

 between Lokuhettige and Vaas. He had the Sri Lankan attack 

 on their knees. Another 10 overs at the crease and he would 

 have been the toast of India. In the end, what did he achieve?

 India just did not plan well enough.

 If you give 4-5 wickets to Vaas 

 and Murali, thats a blow in the guts. India needed 

 to target and create more Lokuhettiges among the Sri Lankans. 

 The best way to do it was in the middle overs for Vaas and 

 Murali would have given nothing away in the final count.

 Somehow, I remain sceptical about 

 the five frontline bowlers theory. Do we have an example 

 in world cricket where five specialist bowlers have mattered 

 in the one-day context? Even Australia restrict themselves 

 to four quality bowlers.

 India looked for thoroughbreds 

 when multidimensional cricketers are the need of the hour 

 in one-dayers.

 The likes of Arnold and Dilshans, 

 Brad Hoggs and Ashley Giles, Abdul Razzaq and Shahid Afridi 

 are able to don different hats in the fluid world of one-day 

 cricket quickly.

 Remember: single dimensional talents 

 are easy to mark and sometimes a solitary arrow is enough 

 to bring them down to earth. But if you are a chameleon, 

 you can sneak in and move ahead.

 One keeps hearing that this Indian 

 team needs more time to turn around the corner. They would 

 surely not be able to do so if the legs and spirits are 

 as tardy as that of the present lot.

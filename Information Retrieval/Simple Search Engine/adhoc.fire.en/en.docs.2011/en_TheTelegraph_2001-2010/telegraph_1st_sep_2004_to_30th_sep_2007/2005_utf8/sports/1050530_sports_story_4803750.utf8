 Alls not well in Pakistan camp again 

 - Inzamam in heated exchange with Younis over sending Afridi as opener on Day I 

 Younis Khan and Inzamam-ul Haqs row was not good for the team 

Islamabad: In an indication that all was not well within the Pakistan camp, stand-in captain Younis Khan reportedly had a clash with regular skipper Inzamam-ul Haq and Shahid Afridi during the ongoing first Test against the West Indies in Barbados. Media reports here said the incident took place on the first day of the Test match after Afridi expressed indignation at being asked to open the innings by Younis. 

Younis had told Afridi he would open the innings before the match started but he didnt give a clear yes. On the first day Younis kept on telling him he should open the innings. Finally when Pakistan were getting ready to bat for four overs at the end of the first day, Afridi told Yasir Hameed in the dressing room to pad up and open, a local daily reported quoting sources who witnessed the incident. 

This upset Younis and he asked Afridi why he was misbehaving and he was not one to tell Yasir to open the innings. Younis also made it clear to him he will open the innings. At that time Afridi got up and went out to open. 

But after the days play ended when Younis was taking a shower, Afridi walked up to him and got into an argument with him, accusing him of being too big for his boots. Afridi then went and complained to Inzamam who came and also confronted Younis, the sources said. 

Inzamam got very upset with Younis and asked him what he thought of himself and if he thought that he was the captain and boss of the team. Younis told him to his face that while he accepted that he (Inzamam) was captain but until he (Younis) was leading the side he would do it in his own way and he should not try to support Afridi, who was misbehaving with him. 

The sources said at this point Afridi also came into the argument and some pushing and jostling took place between the three before others intervened. 

They also did not rule out the fact that this incident could have hit the players mentally and which explained their poor batting performance on the second day. 

The incident was not good for the team and it upset Younis no end because he was hurt that Inzamam didnt support him when he was only trying to tell Afridi he needed to tow the team line, they added. Incidentally, the episode took place with the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board Shaharyar Khan also present in Barbados to watch the match. 

Youhana to miss second Test, too 

Theres more bad news for Pakistan as Yousuf Youhana will be unavailable for the second Test as well, starting in Kingston from June 3. 

Youhana returned home from the West Indies on Saturday to attend to his ailing father after skipping the first Test. I dont have enough time to make it back to Jamaica for the second Test. Unfortunately I will also miss that match, Youhana said on Sunday. (Agencies)

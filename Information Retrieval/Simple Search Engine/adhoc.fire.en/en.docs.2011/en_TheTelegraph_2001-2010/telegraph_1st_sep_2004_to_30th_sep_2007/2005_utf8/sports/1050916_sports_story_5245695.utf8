 Harikrishna has it easy

Lausanne: World junior champion P. Harikrishna scored a thumping victory over wonder-kid Magnus Carlsen in the first game of the opening round of the Lausanne Young Masters International Chess Tournament. 

Harikrishna needs only a draw in the return game of the two-game mini match to advance to the semi-finals of this unique event that features established young stars of the chess world. 

Harikrishna was brilliance personified and gave indication that he is now ready for bigger battles. 

Fourteen-year-old Carlsen, one of the most popular players, was simply no match for the wily Indian who came out with an excellent opening surprise by moving the king pawn on the first move. 

Carlsen was taken aback and he resorted to Petroff Defence rather than going for some sharp play that is his forte. Thereafter, Harikrishna was simply on a cruise. Playing the middle game with great concentration, Harikrishna exchanged queens after attaining the bishop pair advantage and Carlsens attempts to equalise in an optically balanced position failed one after the other. 

Picking out holes in blacks position Harikrishna yet again attested his superiority in the endgame and romped home in 56 moves. 

On the other boards, the first day failed to produce any surprise as the top seeds cruised to victories over less-fancied rivals. (PTI)

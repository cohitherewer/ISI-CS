 Shattered Shabbir mulling retirement

Rawalpindi: Pakistan pacer Shabbir Ahmed is considering quitting after becoming the first bowler to be given a years ban by the ICC for illegal action. 

It is disappointing and in such circumstances one is compelled to think about leaving the game altogether, Shabbir said on Wednesday. 

Shabbir was reported for the second time during the first Test against England last month. An independent assessment by the University of Western Australia confirmed he bowled with an illegal action. He was banned on Monday. 

The PCB is yet to decide whether to appeal against the decision. The appeal has to be made within 14 days of the imposition of the ban. 

The PCB will decide whether to file the appeal or not but frankly speaking, I am very disheartened because I have tried hard to remove any defects in my action and I have still not been cleared completely, said Shabbir.

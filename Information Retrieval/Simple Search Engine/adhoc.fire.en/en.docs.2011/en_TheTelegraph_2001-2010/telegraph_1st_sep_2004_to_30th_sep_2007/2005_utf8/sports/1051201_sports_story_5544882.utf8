 India now 4th in ODIs

Dubai: A 6-1 thrashing of Sri Lanka and a drawn series against South Africa has lifted India to fourth spot in the latest ICC ODI rankings. 

The turnaround in Indias one-day fortunes saw the side gaining three spots on the ODI table. 

The 2-2 result in the five-match series against the Proteas brought a gain of two points to Rahul Dravids side, lifting their rating to 109. 

South Africa hold on to second spot, 18 points behind Australia. Pakistan are ranked third. 

In the individual rankings, Rahul Dravid is the only Indian batsman in the top 10 at No. 7. Irfan Pathan is ranked eighth among ODI bowlers, a gain of two places. 

Meanwhile, Brian Laras double hundred against Australia not only helped him become Test crickets leading run-scorer but also lifted him to number two in the latest ICC Test player rankings, which had three Indians in the top ten. 

Laras innings of 226 contributed to a five-place rise in the rankings, moving him past, among others, Australian captain Ricky Ponting (down one place to third) and Matthew Hayden (holding steady at sixth spot). 

Now, only South Africas Jacques Kallis, the ICCs Test Player of the Year, is ahead of him. 

The three Indians in the top ten include Rahul Dravid, placed at five, followed by Virender Sehwag on seventh and Sachin Tendulkar on ninth. 

In the team rankings, Australia have now extended their lead at the top of the table, thanks to a 3-0 clean sweep of the three-match series against the West Indies. 

Among bowlers, Glenn McGrath still sits on top of the rankings while Shane Warne lies third, the two Australians separated by Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralitharan in a tightly-packed top three. 

Irfan Pathan is the only Indian bowler in the top ten, placed ninth ahead of South African pacer Andre Nel.

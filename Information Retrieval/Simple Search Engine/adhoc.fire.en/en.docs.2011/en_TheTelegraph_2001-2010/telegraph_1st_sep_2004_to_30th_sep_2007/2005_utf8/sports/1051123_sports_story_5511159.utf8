Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly may not be anywhere near the scene, but the former India captains shadow is still looming large over the fourth one day International (ODI) between India and South Africa at the Eden on Friday. 

A new twist was added on Tuesday to the continuous chorus of protests against Sourav being kept out of the national side when West Bengal Motion Picture Artists Forum (WBMPAF) called for a boycott of the match. 

In a memorandum sent to Rahul Dravid ? who was also named as the Test captain on Tuesday ? chief selector Kiran More and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) joint secretary Goutam Das Gupta, WBMPAF condemned the manner in which Sourav has been dropped from the side. 

Speaking at a press conference on behalf of the WBMPAF, actors Biplab Chatterjee and Rupa Ganguly called for an immediate inquiry into Souravs removal. 

We are also appealing to the people not to go to the stadium. Only an empty stadium can reflect the protest in a pronounced way, Chatterjee said. 

Das Gupta, however, said hes yet to receive the memorandum and added that such protest doesnt concern the Board. 

A senior Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) official also rubbished the fact that there is any fear of public boycott of the match. 

I understand that a lot of sentiment is involved in the Sourav issue, but Sourav himself alleviated the situation by requesting people to throng the Eden. And, after his request, I dont think people will boycott the match. Besides, we have satisfactory reports of ticket sales? Till Monday, weve had a gate sale of Rs. 60 lakh, the official said. 

There will be, however, usual security arrangements in and around the stadium during the match. Police are aware of such protests, but Im yet to get information about any extra security for them, he added. 

Both India and South Africa will arrive at the city on Wednesday evening. 

Meanwhile, the dew factor will again play a crucial role in the day-nighter. The teams have to negotiate with dews at this time of the year. Because the ball tends to skid faster in the evening, the side batting second will face problems, said another official. 

Daryl Harper will be the International Cricket Council (ICC) elite panel umpire for the match. A. V. Jayaprakash will be the international panel umpire to stand alongside the Australian in the match. 

I. Shivram will join the duo as the TV umpire, while Jeff Crowe will remain seated on the Match Referees chair.

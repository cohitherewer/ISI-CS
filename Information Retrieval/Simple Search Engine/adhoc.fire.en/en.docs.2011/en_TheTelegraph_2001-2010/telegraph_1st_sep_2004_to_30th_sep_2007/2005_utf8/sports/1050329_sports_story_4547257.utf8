The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hameed to stay back for ODIs

 - Board agrees to captain?s request 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yasir Hameed has been rewarded for his fine 76 on Sunday 

 Bangalore: Opener Yasir Hameed, who scored 

 an excellent 76 in the Pakistan second innings, has been 

 rewarded by Inzamam-ul Haq: He?s going to stay back as the 

 17th member of the ODI squad.

 ?Yes, the captain did make a request 

 and the Board has agreed,? manager Saleem Altaf told 

 The Telegraphon Monday evening. Laughing, he added: 

 ?If you win, quite a few things can be done...? 

Apparently, Inzamam made the request in a one-on-one with Board chairman Shaharyar Khan. The latter then spoke to chief selector Wasim Bari. 

Hameed, it may be recalled, was to head home ? with Taufeeq Umar and Mohammed Khalil ? after the final Test. Now, only Umar and Khalil will be leaving. 

The ones picked exclusively for the six ODIs are: Shahid Nazir, Rao Iftikhar and Mohammed Hafeez. The trio joins teammates in Hyderabad on Tuesday. 

 Pakistan are to play a limited overs warm-up match 

 there prior to the ODI series which gets underway in Kochi 

 on April 2.

 Cricketer dies onfield

London: A village cricket captain collapsed shortly after scoring a career best 154 at Somerset. 

Shaun French, 39, batted for most of his sides ? Barrington Cricket Club ? innings and was supposed to keep wickets before he collapsed on his way out from the pavilion Thursday. 

Despite efforts by an umpire, a former policeman, and other players to revive the father of five-year-old twin girls, French did not recover from a suspected heart attack. 

Colleagues at the club paid tribute to French, a management accountant, who opened the batting. 

A club official said: Shaun was a competitive sportsman who enjoyed life. He was a big hitting batsman who had all the shots and he could win a game on his own. 

He was tired when he came into the pavilion but he drank a cup of tea. He had put his pads on to keep wickets when he collapsed. 

We have cancelled all our games until after his funeral next week. (PTI)

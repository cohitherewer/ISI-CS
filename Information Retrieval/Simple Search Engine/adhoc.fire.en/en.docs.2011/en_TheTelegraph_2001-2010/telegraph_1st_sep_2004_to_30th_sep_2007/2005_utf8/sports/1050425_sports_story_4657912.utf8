 Contractor withdraws 

Mumbai: Two days after his nomination for contesting the elections of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) was accepted, former India captain Nari Contractor withdrew from the fray here Sunday. 

?Contractor has withdrawn from the fray which means there would be no contests for the two vice-presidents posts. Dilip Vengsarkar (another former India captain) and Ravi Sawant (also the sitting vice-president along with Vengsarkar) have been elected unopposed,? MCA joint secretary Prof. Ratnakar Shetty said. 

Contractor was reportedly peeved with the way in which his nomination for contesting the MCA polls was first rejected by the election officer because it was seconded by a defaulter and then acce- pted following the intervention of president Sharad Pawar. 

There are four contestants for the post of two joint secretaries (including former India Test cricketer and incumbent Lalchand Rajput) and 19 for 11 committee members posts, Shetty added. 

Pawar and Shetty, who has been MCA?s joint secretary for the last eight years and has completed his term in this position, have already been elected unopposed for the post of president and treasurer, respectively. 

 Shirke president 

Ajay Shirke was on Sunday elected unopposed president of Maharashtra Cricket Association at the first meeting of association?s managing committee in Pune. 

Others who were elected were Dr Srikant Kelkar (vice-president), Dhanpal Shah (vice-president), Sudhakar Shanbhag (secretary) and Balasaheb Thorve (treasurer), a MCA release said.

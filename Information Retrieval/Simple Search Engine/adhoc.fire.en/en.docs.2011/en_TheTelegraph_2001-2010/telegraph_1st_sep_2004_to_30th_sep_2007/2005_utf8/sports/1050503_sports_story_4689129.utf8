 London: Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has been barred from a children?s soccer tournament because organisers felt he was not a suitable role model.

 The 19-year-old England star, who has been the centre of lurid news stories about his private life, was to have taken coaching sessions at an under-13 event this week.

 But English Schools Football Association chief executive John Read said: ?We felt, under the circumstances, over what was being reported, that we could find a better role model.?

 Rooney has launched a libel action after denying reports he slapped his girlfriend Coleen McLoughlin in a night club. Last year he faced allegations he slept with prostitutes.

 Rooney, who earns ?50,000 a week, has also been under fire for his behaviour on the pitch.

 Canal Plus said Graille had been replaced by Pierre Blayau, whose major goal was to prepare for next season. Blayau was Stade Rennes? president from 1998 to 2000.

 ?I am the WBA champion and soon to be undisputed heavyweight champion of the world,? Toney declared, while offering challenges to rival world champions Vitali Klitschko of Ukraine and Chris Byrd of the US. ?I don?t duck anyone.?

 Toney won a unanimous 12-round decision over the Puerto Rican, whose promoters said after the fight that he has decided to retire in the wake of losing a fight he said he believed was his.

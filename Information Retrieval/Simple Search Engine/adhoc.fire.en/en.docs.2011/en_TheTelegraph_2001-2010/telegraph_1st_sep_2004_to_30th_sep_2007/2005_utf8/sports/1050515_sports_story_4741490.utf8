 Saraswati aims year-end comeback

Calcutta: Saraswati Saha hopes to come back to the track at the end of this year. At least she believes so. 

Im yet to start full-fledged training. Ive been advised rest by the doctor for another five-six months. So, hopefully, Ill start running again at competitive meets at the year-end, the Busan Asian Games 200m gold medallist told The Telegraph at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

Its her injuries on the right ankle and ligament that have kept the sprinter away from tracks since the Athens Olympics. 

The injuries are healing now. Ive already started doing light exercises, she said on Saturday, on the sidelines of the state athletics meet. 

However, Saraswati is now no longer interested in 400m. Instead, the injury-ravaged foot has made her shift focus to the 100m and 200m. 

Since the stunning golden performance in the Busan Asian Games about three years ago, Saraswati looked all set to change gear to the then world of Marion Jones and Zhana Pintusevich-Block. The rationale behind her move to 400m at that time was believed to be the fact that Saraswati didnt have quick reflex and she gained momentum as the race progressed. 

Its not possible now (of running 400). Because of the critical nature of my injury, Ive been advised not to put pressure (on my feet) in a long distance event. So 400 is out my mind now, she insisted. 

But will she be able to revive the glory on return? 

Why not? pat came the reply. The Athletics Federation of India officials are in constant touch with me. They have even asked me to join national camps. 

But I dont want to take further risks. Ill only take to the tracks once I have recovered completely, she maintained. 

Saraswati, however, is not averse to the idea of hiring foreign coaches. From my own perspective I can say Ive been immensely benefited by them before both Busan and Athens Games, she said. 

Incidentally, the Saraswati Athlete Search Foundation (SASF) ? she had started soon after her return from Busan ? is providing financial assistance to poor and budding athletes from the districts. 

About 20 athletes are now under the coverage of the foundation. One of them even participated in the state meet, she informed.

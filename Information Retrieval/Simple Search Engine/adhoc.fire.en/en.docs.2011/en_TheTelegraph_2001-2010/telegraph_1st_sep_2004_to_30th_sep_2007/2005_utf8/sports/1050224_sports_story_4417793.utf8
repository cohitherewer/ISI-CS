 PCB backs Woolmer

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has cleared coach Bob Woolmer of charges brought about by the ICC for his comments against umpiring decisions during the tour of Australia. 

?The PCB is satisfied with his explanation. The matter is over as far as we are concerned. The ICC will be briefed about it,? a PCB spokesman said on Wednesday. 

Woolmer was quoted as saying in Australian newspapers that umpiring decisions had gone ?29-5 against us? during the triseries, which Australia won. 

The ICC had charged the Pakistan coach under level 2.4 of the Code of Conduct.

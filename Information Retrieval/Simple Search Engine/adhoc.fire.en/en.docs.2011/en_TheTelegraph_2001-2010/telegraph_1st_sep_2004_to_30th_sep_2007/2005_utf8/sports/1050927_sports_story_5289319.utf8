 Of revelations and smart gambles 

 STAR RACER

 Vinay on El Cid

 Racegoers expected smooth smooth sailing of the favourites, last Wednesday, but there were many a hiccups in the six-event card. The afternoon witnessed smart gambles, exciting finishes, and the concealed forms of some horses were also a revelation. 

 On the whole, it was an exciting day of racing and visiting jockey Imran Chisty was the chief beneficiary with a well-earned treble through Trojan Desert, Palentino ? both Errol Bhungard-wards ? and King Is Born hailing from Daniel Davids yard. 

 But Chisty must have rued missing out on the 1,200m Court Minstrel Handicap which saw trainer Vijay Singhs Shalom taking his hottest order of the day, Tagged For Terror, by surprise.

 Shalom was the quiet fancy of the stable, making her appearance on the track almost after 10 months, and ridden by an apprentice, Jugnu Gurang, who had been struggling to record his maiden victory. 

 He succeeded, and like a seasoned rider, Jugnu allowed Tagged For Terror and Ballet Master to call the shots till the final turn. Improving his position while Terror was still commanding a lead of two lengths, the apprentice worked his way up to have the measure of the quarter-money favourite 50m from the winning post.

 In fact, apprentices were an inspired lot on the day. Vinay Jaiswal and Afzal Khan were at the helm of affairs in the afternoons chief event, the 1,800m Sir Aali Cup. However, the experienced Vinay, partnering the unfancied El Cid, got the better of relative newcomer Afzal when the heat was turned on. 

 Way To the Starts, in fact, bolted from the start, making it difficult for Afzal to exercise proper control over the joint-favourite ? Chistys ride Primaticcio. He did overpower his ride at 600m and allowed El Cid to shoot into the lead, but the expanded energy early in the race worked against his interests. 

 Zephyrs last forward run over 1,400m pointed to his chances over an 1,100m sprint. More importantly, the withdrawal of Chistys ride, Traditional Style, further helped the cause of trainer Bharath Singhs half-money favourite who almost won from the start, the way she liked. 

 The rest of the day was Chistys. Starting off with Trojan Deserts back-to-back win, Chisty had a virtual armchair ride on Palentino. The horse was expected to reveal his Western India form and he did so in the 1,800m Richie Rich Cup when money on him came from the right sources. The half-money favourite was settled in mid-division till the final turn before storming home for a seven-length victory over a late-finishing Pipsqueak and Star Phoenix. Make note of Star Phoenixs run. The Daniel-ward covered good ground in the stretch run.

 King Is Born cashed in on his good looks and track preparedness to victory, thus giving Chisty his final winner on the day. The 8-10 favourite may improve following this win.

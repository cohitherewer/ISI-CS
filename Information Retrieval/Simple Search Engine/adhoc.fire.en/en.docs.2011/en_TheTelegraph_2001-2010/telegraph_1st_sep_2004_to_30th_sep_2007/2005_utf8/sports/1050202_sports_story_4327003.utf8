 Court order against Koya

Chennai: The Madras High Court has restrained All India Chess Federation secretary P.T. Ummer Koya and treasurer Soumen Majumdar from interfering with day-to-day activities of the federation in any capacity. 

Giving the interim injunction on a suit filed by the Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi state associations, Justice R. Balasubramanian also restra-ined Koya from acting as AICF?s representative and functioning as vice-president of Fide and chairman of the Commonwealth chess association, pending disposal of the suit. 

In their suit, the secretaries of these three associations had sought permanent injunction restraining Koya and Majumdar from holding any post in the AICF till they are absolved of the charges of ?misfeasance and malfeasance? and interfering with day-to-day administration of the federation in any manner and in any capacity. 

Addressing a press meet, the three state association secretaries Bharat Singh Chauhan (Delhi), R.M. Dongre (Maharashtra) and Manuel Aaron (Tamil Nadu) said ?the game will not suffer at all because of this.? 

They alleged that Koya went on a rampage since 2001. ?He has been milking the federation dry by draconian powers vested on himself.? 

In a press release, they charged that ?Koya is siphoning off the funds of the federation under various heads. This is in addition to his huge TA/DA bills running to over Rs 8 lakh and salary of Rs 12,000 per month for his private secretary.? he said. (PTI)

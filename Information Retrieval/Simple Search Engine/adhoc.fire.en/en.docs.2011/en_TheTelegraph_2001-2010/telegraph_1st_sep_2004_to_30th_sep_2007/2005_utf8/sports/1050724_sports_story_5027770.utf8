 CABs counter to Vajpai

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB has dismissed the issues raised by Dinesh Vajpai to the election process. Vajpai is contesting Jagmohan Dalmiya for the post of president. The AGM will be held on Wednesday. 

In a letter to Dalmiya on Friday, Vajpai had sought a few clarifications. Vajpai had asked if it was fair to have Dalmiya (the incumbent) involved in the election process. He had also asked for a specimen of ballot papers, for voters list to be displayed in advance, and why there was a delay in the distribution of nomination forms. 

The CAB replied on Saturday, saying rules of the association were being followed for the election, that the voters list has been put up on Friday itself, and that there was no provision for sending specimen ballot papers. 

Its not fair for Dalmiya to preside over his own elections, Vajpai told The Telegraph on Saturday. The West Bengal Police Sports Club did not get its nomination form, and we had to get a duplicate to put in the papers, he added. 

Meanwhile, it was learnt that Dalmiya will sit with club officials, the police and other concerned parties after the AGM to ensure local cricket matches are held in enclosed grounds. This will expedite the conclusion of the local season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bayern unique at practice

 Bayern Munich players during practice at Howrah Stadium on Wednesday 

Calcutta: If practice has anything to suggest, one is sure to know in no time what stuff even the FC Bayern Munich second-string players is made of. 

Close on the heels of AC Milan under-18 sides visit, the city had its first chance of see the new visitors from Europe at practice and it was simply unique in its own way, under the close vigil of assistant coach Gerd Muller. 

In an hour-long session, players sweated out at the Howrah Municipality Stadium on Wednesday with machine-like efficiency. 

An interesting part of it was shooting practice. While one goalkeeper was standing on the line, the other was near the top box. A player was asked to chip the ball first for the goalkeeper standing at the top box, who in turn promptly released it for the shooter who now had to take a grounder aimed at the keeper standing behind. 

If any player committed a mistake ? for example, the attempted chip fell short of the goalkeeper or the grounder turned out to be a chip ? he quietly left the scene, circled the ground as a punishment and rejoined the session. 

Its sad that no local coach was anywhere to be seen to get a feel of such unique practice sessions at the ground. Earlier in the day, the Germans paid a visit to the Mother House and donated 10,000 euro to Missionaries of Charity. They spent half an hour there. 

Werner Kern, an official, said the side is keen to see what India is. According to him, the 105-year-old club has more than one lakh members all over the world, and 1700 fan clubs. The club had a turnover of 197 million euro last year, and also made a substantial profit. 

The German visitors will hold a clinic with 22 local boys in the age group of 13-14 on Thursday. 

The team is led by Ghanaian Christian Saba who played for his countrys national squad in the under-17 World Cup. He was introduced to Suley Musah, but pleaded ignorance that the key Mohammedan Sporting player was also a Ghanaian.

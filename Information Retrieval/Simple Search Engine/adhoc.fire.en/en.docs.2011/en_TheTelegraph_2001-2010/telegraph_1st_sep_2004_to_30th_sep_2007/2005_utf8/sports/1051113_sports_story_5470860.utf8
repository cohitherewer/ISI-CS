Ahmedabad: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly failed to impress with the willow, but his golden arm wrecked the West Zone top-order to put them in trouble against East at close on Day I of the Duleep Trophy final at Motera on Saturday. In reply to Easts paltry 150, West were reeling at 61 for five, with Sourav claiming three for 20 when stumps were drawn. 

Opting to bat on a seamer-friendly wicket, East Zone top order crumbled in front of Zaheer Khan and Rakesh Patel. Patel put the Sourav-led side into the back foot, sending back Shiv Sundar Das and S. Sarvanan, both for nought. Wicketkeeper-batsman Deep Dasgupta and opener Arindam Das (top scorer for East with 56) tried to stem the rot, but Deep was sent back by Zaheer at his individual score of 24. 

Sourav, who came in to bat at No. 5, also failed to come good. He lasted seven balls. After being tested with three successive short balls from Zaheer, he fell to the very next inswinging delivery in the 21st over. 

Souravs decision to bat first on a wet wicket may bear fruit for East, which is expected to turn in the latter stages. We hope to get them out as early as possible tomorrow, but still a lot is left in the match? It will be too early to comment on the outcome at this moment, Sourav told The Telegraph. 

Arindam admitted that batting on a wet track was really difficult in the first session. I always felt the pressure as wickets were falling at regular intervals at the other end. According to him, it would have been nice had he managed to add 20-30 more runs on the board. 

The East thinktank is unhappy with Arindams leg before decision with the ball clearly pitching outside the leg stump. 

The pace-spin combination did work well for West as both Munaf and captain Sairaj Bahutule, took three wickets each, to clean up the East tail. 

Sourav provided East with the initial breakthrough by getting the wicket of opener Aakash Christian for nine. He also picked wickets of Dheeraj Jadhav (15) and night watchman Rakesh Patel (1).

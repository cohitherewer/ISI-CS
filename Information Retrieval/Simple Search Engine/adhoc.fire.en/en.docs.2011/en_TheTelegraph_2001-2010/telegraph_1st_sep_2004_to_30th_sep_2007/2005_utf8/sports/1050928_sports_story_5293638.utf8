The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Frazers tenure may end

 - Board isnt clear about sports scientists role 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ian Frazer

Mumbai: Sports scientist Ian Frazer, hand-picked by Greg Chappell to be on the Team India support staff, appears to be on the way out. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the Board isnt clear about his role and nobody is very amused that he effectively functions as the assistant coach. 

If Chappell needs an assistant, then an Indian should be given a chance... We dont think Frazers utility is such that he has to stay, observed a well-placed source. 

Its not clear whether the Board officials raised the subject during their interaction with Chappell, on Tuesday. 

Frazer went on both tours thus far this season ? to Sri Lanka and, then, Zimbabwe. 

Meanwhile, Board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra has confirmed that a full-time manager is likely to be appointed for Team India.

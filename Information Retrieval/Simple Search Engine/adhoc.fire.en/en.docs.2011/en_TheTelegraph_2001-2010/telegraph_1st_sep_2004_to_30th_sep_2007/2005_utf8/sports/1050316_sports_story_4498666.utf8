The Telegraph - Calcutta

Team looking to build on Mohali platform: Inzy

- Pak captain feels wicket will eventually help spinners 

- India skipper not reading too much into Kanerias exploits

 Inzamam-ul Haq at nets at the Eden on Tuesday 

Calcutta: The final day showing in Mohali has sent the right signals to the Pakistan camp. And they are trying to build on that confidence. 

?The performance in Mohali has given us a lot of confidence. If we play with the same spirit we can come up with a better result here,? said an optimistic Inzamam-ul Haq on Tuesday. 

?But we shouldn?t get carried away by the performance. This is a new match,? Inzamam warned. 

Inzamam thought that the Eden wicket will help the spinners as the match progressed. ?It looks a good Test wicket. It should be good for the batsmen as well as for seamers, if they are prepared to bowl in the right areas. After two days it will start helping the spinners.? 

Kamran Akmal?s performance has been a big boost to the team. ?We all knew Akmal was a very good wicketkeeper. But now he has also performed with the bat. 

?He has gained a lot of confidence and knowing that we have a good batsman lower down the order will definitely help the team,? said the Pakistan captain. 

On Asim Kamal, who got runs in both the innings of the first Test, Inzamam said: ?He is capable of playing higher up the order. But in first-class cricket also he plays at No. 6 or 7 and scores runs.? 

The captain added that he enjoys the pressure of Indo-Pak matches. ?If India and Pakistan play each other regularly the pressure will be less. But there is always pressure in international cricket, and especially in India-Pakistan matches. We enjoy that.?

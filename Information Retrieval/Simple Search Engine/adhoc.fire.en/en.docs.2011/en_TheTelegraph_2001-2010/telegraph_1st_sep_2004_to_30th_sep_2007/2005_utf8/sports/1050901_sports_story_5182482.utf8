 Sachin not ready for Tests too

 - Dheeraj Jadhav named replacement 

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

Calcutta/Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar will not be available for the forthcoming two-Test series against Zimbabwe as well. 

According to Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) joint secretary Goutam Das Gupta, Sachin informed physio John Gloster that he wasnt ready to return to big time action. Gloster, in turn, faxed a report about Sachins fitness to the Board on Wednesday. 

On the basis of that report, the national selectors were advised to name a replacement for the maestro. 

Incidentally, till late on Wednesday evening, there had been no direct communication between Sachin and the BCCI. 

According to Gloster, he (Sachin) does not feel confident and strong enough yet to return to the rigours of Test cricket. 

The selectors had a telephonic conference with coach Greg Chappell in Zimbabwe and decided that Maharashtra opener Dheeraj Jadhav would replace Sachin for the Test series commencing September 13, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair announced from Thiruvananthapuram. 

Sachin, who underwent surgery in London in May-end after being constantly troubled by tennis elbow, had been examined by Gloster here before the teams departure for Zimbabwe. 

In his report to Nair from Zimbabwe, Gloster said the master batsmans rehabilitation plans were going on well. Sachin has returned to light net session, but he doesnt feel confident and strong enough yet to return to the rigours of Test cricket batting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Day I washed out by Cyclone Baaz

 - FIRST TEST 

 Forecast isnt encouraging 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Chennai: Rahul Dravid peered despondently at the eerie stillness that immersed the Chepauk on Friday. It was something he dreaded and his worst fears had finally come true. 

Cyclone Baaz had engulfed the city with all its intensity since early morning. The opening day of the Test series versus Sri Lanka looked a non-starter long before the umpires decided to call it off at lunch. The downpour that continued throughout the day left puddles on the outfield and a huge uncertainty over play commencing on Saturday. 

It was a day that disappointed and frustrated. The handful of spectators who braved the conditions slowly made their way back long after the players had left the ground. They had been robbed of cricketing action for the second time within ten days after the India-South Africa one-dayer was washed out last month. 

The forecast isnt encouraging over the weekend and it will take an extraordinary effort from the groundsmen to get the outfield at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, that lacks underground drainage, ready in time. 

The match officials, though, are hoping against hope and have decided on a 9 am start to complete 97 overs per day and make up for the time lost. As of now, the Test seems to be only of academic interest. 

It is usual for Chennai to have rains during this time of the year. Less than 30 overs were bowled in the India-New Zealand ODI here in October 2003. Again last year, the gripping final day of the Test versus Australia was abandoned. 

Traditionally, Test matches were held here in January-February and coincided with the Pongal festival. Things have changed now, but only for the worse. 

It is learnt that there was discontent in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association for being allotted this Test. They were more eager to host one of the matches during the series versus England next year. 

TNCA president and newly-elected BCCI treasurer N. Srinivasan did raise an objection regarding the timing of this Test, but that was only after the itinerary was announced. 

If they had any reservations regarding the dates they should have intimated the Board in advance. There is no use cribbing once everything was announced, Kamal Morarka, chairman of the Tour, Programme and Fixtures committee that decided on the itinerary, told The Telegraph. 

Strictly by rotation, TNCA had to host one of the Test matches versus Sri Lanka. If the BCCI was asked to allot a match in the latter half, the committee would surely have considered the proposal, Morarka added. 

Srinivasan, who is reportedly unwell, was unavailable while TNCA secretary C.R. Vijayraghavan had a terse no comments to offer. 

India may move up 

Meanwhile, with England set to lose the series in Pakistan, India will move up to No. 2 in the ICC Test Championship table if they beat Sri Lanka 2-0. However, if England lose the Lahore Test too, India will just need to win the current series to be elevated in the rankings. 

India currently are placed third while England are second. Australia lead the standings.

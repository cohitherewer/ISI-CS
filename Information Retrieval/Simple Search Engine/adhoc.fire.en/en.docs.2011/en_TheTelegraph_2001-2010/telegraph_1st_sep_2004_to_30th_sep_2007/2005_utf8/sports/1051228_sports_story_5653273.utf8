 Di Stefano bypass likely today

Madrid: Doctors plan to perform a heart bypass operation on former Real Madrid great Alfredo Di Stefano on Wednesday if his condition remains stable. The 79-year-old Argentine was admitted to hospital after a heart attack. Doctors postponed planned surgery on Monday because of fever. 

In the last 24 hours, and though the prognosis remains serious, there has been an improvement in his circulation, the statement from Valencias La Fe hospital said. If the current clinical stability continues, the bypass will take place tomorrow. (Reuters)

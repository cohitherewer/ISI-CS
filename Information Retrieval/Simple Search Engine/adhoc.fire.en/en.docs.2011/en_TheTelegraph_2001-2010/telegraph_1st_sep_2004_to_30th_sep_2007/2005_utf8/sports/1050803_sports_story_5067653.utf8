 Gatlin ready to join the four greats

Helsinki: Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlin goes into the World Championships here with a fantastic chance of joining the illustrious gang of four sprinters who all held both Olympic gold and the world title simultaneously. 

After the withdrawal of world record-holder Asafa Powell of Jamaica owing to his failure to recover from a torn groin muscle, Gatlin has emerged the top contender for the world 100m title. 

If he wins the blue riband event, he can join the elite quartet of sprinting legends ? Carl Lewis, Linford Christie, Donovan Bailey and Maurice Greene ? who held the two titles at the same time. 

To be set alongside such great athletes would be a privilege, but I am not going to anticipate my name being mentioned in the same breath until I have achievead that target, said Gatlin. 

When asked about Powells withdrawal, Gatlin said: This changes nothing. I wasnt the Olympic favourite last year, but I won. Everyone has a chance to win. Gatlin also won bronze in the 200m at the Athens Games. 

When Gatlin roared across the finish line of the Olympic 100 m in 9.85 seconds, he left behind not only a testing childhood and a brush with drugs early in his career, but also reigning champion Greene and one of the best sprinting field ever assembled. 

With Gatlin, the torch was passed to a new generation in the heavyweight event of the World Athletics programme. However, he cannot completely outrun the doping question mark that hangs over his sport. 

In 2001, he was tested positive for amphetamines and was hit with a two-year ban, reduced to one year after he appealed on grounds that he required treatment for attention deficit disorder.

 Harikrishna holds Georgian GM

 - World junior champion remains joint 3rd 

 Harikrishna 

Dos Hermanas (Spain): World junior champion P. Harikrishna drew with GM Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia in the second round of the category-16 Dos Hermanas international chess meet here. 

Having drawn the first round against Russian GM Oleg Korneev, Harikrishna edged up to one point out of a possible two after a draw-marred second day that saw just one decisive game. 

As a result of this, overnight leaders Miguel Illescas Cordoba of Spain and Ukrainian Sergey Karjakin remained at the top of the table tallying 1.5 points. 

Harikrishna remained in joint third spot along with Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan, Ruben Felgaer of Argentina, Azmaiparashvili and Russian duo of Alexey Dreev and Oleg Korneev. GMs Lenier Dominguez of Cuba and 2003 winner Alexander Rustemov of Russia are next in the standings. 

For a second day Harikrishna had it easy. The Ragozin variation in the Queen?s gambit declined does not have many followers among the top players of the world but Harikrishna employed it successfully showing in-depth preparation right till a balanced middle game arose. 

Azmaiparashvili, who also doubles up as vice-president in Fide, had played with Harikrishna in the Pune international chess festival a few months back and the Georgian had been on the receiving end in that game. Perhaps that, along with Harikrishna?s emphatic play in the opening, prompted Azmaiparashvili not to take a risky course. 

The middle game was devoid of any real excitement and once Harikrishna successfully traded the queens on move 19 the draw was always within reach. The players played for another 12 moves before the peace was signed vide repetition. (PTI)

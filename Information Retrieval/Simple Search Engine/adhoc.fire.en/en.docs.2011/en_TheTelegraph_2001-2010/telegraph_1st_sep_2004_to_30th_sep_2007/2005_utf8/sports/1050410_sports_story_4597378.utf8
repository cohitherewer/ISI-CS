 Harikrishna slips to joint 5th

Dos Hermanas (Spain): World junior champion P. Harikrishna opted for a quick draw with tournament leader Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan in the eighth and penultimate round of category-16 Dos Hermanas chess meet here. 

After the draw, the road to victory was almost cleared for Radjabov who maintained his slender half point lead over Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia and defending champion Alexander Rustemov of Russia in the euros 16000 prize money tournament. 

With just one round remaining in the 10-player round-robin tournament, Radjabov has five points in his kitty while Harikrishna slipped to joint fifth spot in the standing list on four points. Giving the Indian company was top seed Alexey Dreev of Russia and Ruben Felgaer of Argentina. 

Harikrishna will now at least like to draw the last round game against Cuban Lenier Dominguez, who is currently at the bottom of the tables, to make sure he adds something to his present elo rating. In fact, a victory in the last game can even push Harikrishna to joint second spot as the players ahead of him may like to play safe too. 

In the game against Radjabov, however, Harikrishna could do little as the Azerbaijani played safe with his white pieces. Employing the Scotch opening, Radjabov went for the exchange of queens very early in the opening and after a mere 13 moves proposed the draw that was accepted by Harikrishna. 

For the third day in succession, the round produced just one decisive game and this time the beneficiary was Rustemov who outplayed compatriot Oleg Korneev who played the black side of a benoni defence. 

Spurning down an unconditional draw offer through repetition of moves in the middle game, Rustemov showed character and went all out for a victory with uncompromising play. 

The efforts of the younger Russian were soon rewarded as Korneev parted with a piece for two pawns, hoping to create some counter play that never materialised. Rustemov picked up another piece en route to his 62-moves triumph. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Final day sees only 11 overs

 - TOUR-OPENER 

Dharamshala: Inclement weather led to Pakistan?s tour-opener against Board President?s XI being called off with only 11 overs bowled on the final day on Saturday. 

The three-day match saw a total of 102 overs being bowled, robbing the visitors of much-needed practice ahead of the three-Test series. 

There was no play in the entire morning session because of wet ground conditions. Cricket got underway after lunch, but poor light forced play to be suspended 10 minutes before tea. A sharp shower followed, forcing the umpires to call off the match. 

Board XI, resuming at 91 for one, had by that time advanced to 120 for one in reply to the visitors? 273. Skipper Mohammed Kaif and opener Dheeraj Jadhav were unbeaten on 49 each. 

The 8,000-odd crowd got some exciting cricket to watch in the brief spell of play. Kaif had a contest with leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and seamer Mohammad Sami.

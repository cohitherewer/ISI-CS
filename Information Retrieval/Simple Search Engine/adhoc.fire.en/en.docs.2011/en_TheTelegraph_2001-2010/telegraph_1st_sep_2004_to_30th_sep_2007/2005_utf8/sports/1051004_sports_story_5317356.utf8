New York: Boosted by a flying start, South Koreas K.J. Choi won his first PGA Tour title in three years with a two-shot victory at the Greensboro Classic in North Carolina on Sunday. 

The 35-year-old Korean, co-leader overnight with American D.J. Trahan, fired a six-under-par 66 to finish on 22-under 266 at the Forest Oaks Country Club. 

Choi birdied the first four holes and then forged three strokes clear with a holed bunker shot at the par-three 12th before clinching his third PGA Tour career title, and first since the 2002 Tampa Bay Classic. 

Japans Shigeki Maruyama, the 2003 champion, shot a 67 to secure second place with Americans Charles Warren (65), Brandt Jobe (67) and Jason Bohn (70) a further three strokes back in a share of third. 

Britains Justin Rose was among a group of five players tied for sixth at 15-under 273 after returning a 71. 

Disappointed at missing out on last weeks Presidents Cup team competition, Choi took out his frustration at Forest Oaks with an impressive run of four rounds in the 60s. 

Meanwhile, Daniel Chopra, a Swede of Indian origin, could not capitalise on his good work of the first two days as a par 72 in the final round saw him finish tied 34th. 

Chopra, who had rounds of 67, 69, 71 and 72, had put himself in a good position after a bogey-free first 36 holes.

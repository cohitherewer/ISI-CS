 IN THE CITY

 After Ranadeb Bose, Bengal have got another entry in the India A side, who will take on Pakistan in the one-day warm-up tie, to be held in Hyderabad on Wednesday. 

 Sanjib Sanyal, who was the first stand-bye, made it to the squad after Railways? allrounder J.P. Yadav pulled himself out to play in the Ranji Trophy final versus Punjab. 

 Sanjib said on Sunday that tips from Team India captain Sourav Ganguly had helped him a lot. ?I was fortunate to play with Sourav in a few Ranji matches (for Bengal) and his tips were vital for me,? Sanjib said. 

 ?I want to see myself as an allrounder,? he added.

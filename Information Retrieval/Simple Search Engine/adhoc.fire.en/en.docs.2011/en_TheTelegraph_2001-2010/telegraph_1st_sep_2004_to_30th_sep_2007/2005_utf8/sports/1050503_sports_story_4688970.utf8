The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Steve has no plans to coach

 - Icon may soon be back in city 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The ?market? buzz is that Steve Waugh is keen on coaching Team India. Some are even talking of his succeeding compatriot John Dyson in Sri Lanka. 

Actually, the icon has no plans to coach any national side. 

?Yes, you can have it on record: Steve has neither applied for a coach?s job anywhere nor is he keen on wearing that hat,? manager Robert Joske told The Telegraph. 

Contacted in Sydney on Monday evening, Steve?s confidant No.1 added: ?I don?t know where all this originated, but it certainly wasn?t from our end.? 

The ?Steve?s-not-interested? line is in keeping with what he himself conveyed to this newspaper on the eve of the January 10 tsunami fund-raiser at the MCG: ?More than coaching, I would prefer mentoring?? 

Of course, he was the World XI?s coach in Melbourne, but that was a one-off (and largely ceremonial) assignment. 

Steve didn?t speak differently ? during a business-related trip here almost three months ago ? even after South African captain Graeme Smith declared he was ideally suited to coach. 

Fact is the most capped (168 appearances) Test player has moved beyond cricket. Arguably, he?s now a tycoon in-the-making and may soon again be in Calcutta to follow-up on the investment proposals discussed in early February. 

Among others, Steve had then met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industrialist Harshvardhan Neotia. 

?It?s possible Steve and the Macquarie Bank brass will be back in the next two-three weeks? At this point, though, I can?t provide more details,? Joske informed. 

Hopefully, by then, John Wright?s successor is going to be known.

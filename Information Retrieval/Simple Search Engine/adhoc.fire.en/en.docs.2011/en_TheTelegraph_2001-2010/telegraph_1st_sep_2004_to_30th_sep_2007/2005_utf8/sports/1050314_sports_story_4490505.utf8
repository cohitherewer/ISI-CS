The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Zimbabwe bow to Zondeki

Centurion: Paceman Monde Zondeki took six wickets as South Africa crushed Zimbabwe by an innings and 62 runs to win the second Test with two days to spare on Sunday. 

South Africa, who won the first match inside two days, thus take the series 2-0. They dismissed Zimbabwe for 149 in their second innings late on the third day. 

Hamilton Masakadza hit a defiant 47 and Elton Chigumbura made 44 but Zimbabwe lost their last four wickets for six runs as Zondeki, playing in his second Test, took his maiden five-wicket haul with figures of six for 39 from 14.3 overs. 

South Africa declared on 480 for seven to leave the tourists needing to score 211 to make them bat again. 

Zondeki started the rout just before lunch when Barney Rogers glanced a legside delivery to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher for a duck. 

Dion Ebrahim?s dismissal to the last ball before lunch left Zimbabwe struggling on 13 for two and they were in trouble again when Zondeki ripped out Stuart Matsikenyeri?s middle stump. 

The lanky firebrand struck again four overs later when he trapped Brendan Taylor in front and then had Tatenda Taibu caught-behind after a stand of 47 with Masakadza. 

Masakadza stood firm for more than two hours before edging Zondeki to Boucher to end Zimbabwe?s meaningful resistance. 

Earlier, Ashwell Prince scored 139 not out and put on a record 142 for the seventh wicket with Nicky Boje (82). Their partnership beat South Africa?s previous best of 44 for the same wicket.

 Randhawa continues to struggle 

Akron (Ohio): Jyoti Randhawas struggles continued on Friday, Day II of the $7.5 million WGC-NEC Invitational, as he added a seven-over par 77 to a first-round nine-over par 79. 

With a total of 16-over 156, Randhawa brings up the rear of the field in the 71-man field. 

Since there is no cut in this special event, he will continue into the weekend round and is sure of making money. 

The Asian Tour No. 3 started on the 10th and had double-bogeyed the par-4 16th to turn at two over 37. The front nine turned out to be as disastrous as Day I.

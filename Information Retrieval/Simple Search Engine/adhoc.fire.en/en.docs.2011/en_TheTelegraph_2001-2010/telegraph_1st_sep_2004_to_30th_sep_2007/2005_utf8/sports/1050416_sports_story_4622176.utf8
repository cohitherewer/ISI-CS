 Argentine released on bail

Rio de Janeiro: Argentine footballer Leandro Desabato was granted bail on Thursday after spending the day in custody on charges of racially insulting a Brazilian opponent during a Libertadores Cup match in Sao Paulo. 

Desabato, who plays for Buenos Aires club Quilmes, was arrested on the pitch at the end of their 1-3 defeat by Sao Paulo on Wednesday evening following a clash with rival striker Grafite. But the player, who had to pay $3,878, can still not leave Brazil where he faces charges of slander aggravated by racism. 

Quilmes said Desabato had been the victim of a farce and the accusations against him were based on lip-reading by television viewers. 

They also said their directors had been aggressively treated at the Morumbi stadium and that Brazilian authorities were seeking publicity. 

Desabato, who has been charged with the crime of slander aggravated by racism, was seen to say something to Grafite in an off-the-ball incident in first-half injury time. 

Grafite shoved his hand in Desabato?s face and was sent off along with Quilmes midfielder Carlos Arano. The referee took no action against Desabato. 

?I don?t regret this. I?m not withdrawing the allegation and I?m going to let justice take its course,? said Grafite. ?It?s difficult for me when I suffer this type of prejudice.? 

Television pictures released on Thursday showed police coming on to the pitch at the end of the game and arresting Desabato, to the bemusement of the Argentine team. 

One official was heard to say ?racism? loudly several times. The Quilmes players replied ?no? in unison, gesticulating in disbelief. 

Quilmes left the field amid chaotic scenes which continued outside the visiting dressing room, where dozens of Brazilian cameramen and photographers gathered.

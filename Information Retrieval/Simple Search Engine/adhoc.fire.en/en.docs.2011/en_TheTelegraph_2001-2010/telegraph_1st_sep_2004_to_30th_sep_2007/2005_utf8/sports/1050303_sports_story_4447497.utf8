The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bangla on the backfoot again

New Delhi: Bangladesh?s pathetic run continued when they slumped to 117 for six in their first innings against Central Zone on the second day of the Duleep Trophy cricket match here on Wednesday. 

Central Zone, who were earlier bowled out for 351 in the first essay, piled on the humiliation on the visitors, who suffered yet another batting collapse on their debut season in India?s domestic competition. 

Bangladesh, playing with almost their national team, had failed to reach even 200 in both the innings of their opening match against East Zone last week, which they had lost by an innings in Nagpur. 

The visiting batsmen apparently learnt nothing from their earlier outing as they failed to apply themselves on a pitch which was described as ?flat? by their coach Dave Whatmore just a day back. 

Bangladesh had a shocking start to their innings when the openers were back in pavilion by the second over itself with the side yet to open its account. 

Al Shahriar fell in the last ball of the first over bowled by Harbinder Singh when his edge was brilliantly taken in the third slip by Amit Pagnis. 

A ball later, Nafees Iqbal followed his partner back to the dressing room after being trapped leg before by Salabh Srivatsava. 

Brief scores: Central Zone 351 (overnight 248/3) (S. Abbas Ali 122, Devendra Bundela 83, Murali Kartik 33). Bangladesh 117/6 (Manjural Islam Rana 32 batting; J.P. Yadav 3/29). 

Match to continue. (PTI)

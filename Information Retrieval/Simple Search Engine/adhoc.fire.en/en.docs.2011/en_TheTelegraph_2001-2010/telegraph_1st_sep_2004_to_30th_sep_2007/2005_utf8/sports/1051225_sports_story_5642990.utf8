 Shoaib Malik undergoes surgery 

Karachi: Pakistani allrounder Shoaib Malik has had surgery on his heels in order to be fit and available for next months home series against India. 

Malik, a regular member of Pakistans test and one-day teams against England in the recent home series, underwent the operation after complaining of acute pain due to corns. 

Doctors advised him to go for the surgery as he would not have been able to carry on against India in the same condition. He will now be fit before the first Test against India from January 13, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Saturday. 

Malik said: I was facing a lot of pain batting and bowling because I had to put weight on my heels. Doctors say I can now resume playing after a weeks rest. 

The series against India is very important for me and after a satisfactory series won against England I am looking forward to cementing my place in the side, he said. 

The 23-year-old was cleared earlier this month of a suspect bowling action after undergoing tests at the University of Western Australia in Perth. Malik, who opened the batting in the 2-0 Test series win over England, has played in 12 Tests and 107 one-day Internationals. Pakistan won the one-day series 3-2. 

Meanwhile, the PCB is confident that they can get paceman Shabbir Ahmeds one-year suspension overturned after filing an appeal with the ICC. The appeal has been filed on behalf of Shabbir, the PCB director of operations, Saleem Altaf said on Saturday. (Reuters)

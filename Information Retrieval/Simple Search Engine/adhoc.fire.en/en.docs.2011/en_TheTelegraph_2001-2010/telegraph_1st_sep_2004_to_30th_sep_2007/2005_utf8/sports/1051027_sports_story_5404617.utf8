 Golf No. 2 in India: Randhawa 

 - We definitely have better talent than China 

 Randhawa in New Delhi on Wednesday 

New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal on Wednesday said golf was the most popular sport in India behind cricket and that the game would grow further with the explosion of countrys economy in the coming years. 

I would say golf is the number two sport in India. The amount of media coverage it has, it is second only to cricket, Randhawa said during a chat with media on the eve of the Hero Honda Indian Open. 

Atwal said the Indian Tour may not be big at the moment but it would soon have an impact. 

The youngsters are not looking at that (the Indian Tour). But it could be flourishing in the next 10-15 years. With the Indian economy expected to be worlds biggest in the next 20 years, the Tour should do well, Atwal said. Atwal said the standard of Indian golf had gone up since his days. 

A few years back at the Indian Open, me or Jyoti wouldnt be invited to talk (to the media). That itself says a lot. Players like Shiv Kapur are better than we were at their age, Atwal said. 

Randhawa believed that Indian golf had more depth in talent than China, the other fast growing golf nation in the region. 

We have definitely got better talent but they (China) have the courses with no players to play, said the 33-year old. Not many countries have a domestic tour like we have. Australia has so many great players but it doesnt have a Tour, Randhawa pointed out. 

 Thirty weeks is a lot of 

 practice for the youngsters. Definitely we have the talent, 

 they have the courses, for the moment. (PTI)

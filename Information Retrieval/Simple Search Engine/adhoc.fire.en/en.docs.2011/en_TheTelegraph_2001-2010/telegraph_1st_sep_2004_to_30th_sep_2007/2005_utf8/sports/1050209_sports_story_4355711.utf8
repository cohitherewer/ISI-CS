 Vieira shocked at racial abuse

Clairefontaine (France): France captain Patrick Vieira said he was shocked by racial abuse directed at black players during Paris St Germain?s match against RC Lens Sunday. 

Fans in the Boulogne kop at the Parc de Princes unfurled a banner that read ?Come on whites?! and racially abused black players on either side. 

?I have not played at the Parc des Princes for a long time. And I?ll think twice about it before I?m going to go there again,? Vieira said Tuesday. (Reuters)

 Mohota stunned

 - NATIONAL B CHESS 

 2nd straight win for Ramesh 

New Delhi: Former champion Grandmaster R. B. Ramesh scored his second full point, defeating Punjabs Vikas Sharma while other top players also lived up to their billing in the second round of the 43rd National B chess tournament here Thursday. 

Most of the participants were able to give their best with improved conditions at the Bapu Samaj Sewa Kendra following the installation of coolers after the organisers realised the hardships the contestants had to go through on the first day. 

Ramesh won in 39 moves, IM candidate Parimarjan Negi won his game in 54 moves, G. N. Gopal played 48 moves and N. Sanjay continued beyond 55 moves for around four hours without bothering to conserve the energies for the evening session. 

Meanwhile, Andhra Pradeshs Y. Sandeep, down with chicken pox, pulled out of the competition conceding the point to his opponent Arghyadip Das. Local hope Sri Ram Jha and Prasanna Rao reported for the second round matches after missing their opening ties. 

Jha played white but lost to N. Sanjay who developed a strong winning combination on board. Jha tried hard to salvage his pieces but could not survive against the Bangaloreans strategy. Rao scored his first point against Biswajit Bharadwaj of Assam. 

WGM Nisha Mohota, playing black, lost to West Bengals Indranil Das in another match that was stretched to four hours. 

Among other important results, Deepan Chakravarthy got the better of Y. P. Srivastava with black pieces in 29 moves and young Dronavalli Harika justified her higher ratings (2396) against V. S. Negi (2183) to clinch one point on the top board. 

The match between IM N. K. Mishra and Zameer Ahmed Khan of Uttar Pradesh was one interesting affair in the morning session. Mishra was tested hard by Khan before he salvaged one point. 

Playing white, Mishra was in an advantageous position with a piece up initially but he was cleverly trapped by Khan. Mishra lost a lot of time trying to wriggle out of the complications before winning the match.

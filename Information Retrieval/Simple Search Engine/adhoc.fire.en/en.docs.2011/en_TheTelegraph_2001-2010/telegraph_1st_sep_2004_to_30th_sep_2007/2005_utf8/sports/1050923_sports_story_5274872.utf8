 Coria to face Beck first

Bratislava: Argentine world No. 8 Guillermo Coria will square off against Slovakias Karol Beck to kick off the Davis Cup semi-final tie in Bratislava on Friday. 

Slovakia, in the semis for the first time, will hope to transform home hardcourt advantage into a third victory in this years tournament after beating champions Spain and The Netherlands. 

Slovakias top player Dominik Hrbaty, ranked 19th in the world, will face Coria in the reverse singles on Sunday hoping to expose the Argentine number ones Achilles heel. 

In Croatia, local boy Mario Ancic will play Nikolay Davydenko in the opening rubber of the second semi-final against Russia. Thursdays draw also paired Croatian number one Ivan Ljubicic with Mikhail Youzhny. In Saturdays doubles Ancic and Ljubicic will take on Youzhny and Dmitry Tursunov. 

With only 19 places separating the four singles players in the world rankings, the outcome of the tie is unlikely to be decided before Sundays reverse singles when Ljubicic plays Davydenko and Ancic meets Youzhny.

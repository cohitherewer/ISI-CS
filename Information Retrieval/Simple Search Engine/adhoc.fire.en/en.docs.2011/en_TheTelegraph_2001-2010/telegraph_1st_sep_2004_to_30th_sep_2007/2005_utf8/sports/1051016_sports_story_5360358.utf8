 Shiv, Ghei, Mundy tied 11th

Samui: Indian trio of Shiv Kapur, Gaurav Ghei and Uttam Singh Mundy were tied 11th on a topsy-turvy and rain-delayed third day at the $200,000 Bangkok Airways Open at the par-71 Santiburi Samui Country Club. 

Mundy was the Indian star of the day, shooting a three-under 68 in demanding conditions, and only the Chinese Taipei veteran and leader Lu Wen Teh had a better round with a 67. 

Kapur brought home a one-over 72, thus improving one place from overnight 12th, while Gheis two-over 73 saw him drop from overnight tied seventh to 11th. Mundy moved up from tied 33rd to 11th. Veteran Lu emerged as the third round pacesetter after leading Thai duo Thammanoon Srirot and Chawalit Plaphol suffered nightmarish third round outings. (PTI)

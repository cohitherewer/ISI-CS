The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England get a raw deal from Indian board

 SCYLD BERRY 

Indias cricket board on Saturday announced the long overdue itinerary for Englands tour of India from February to April, and thereby confirmed the widespread view of crickets most eccentric organisation. 

Main venues where large crowds would be guaranteed and thousands of England supporters could be accommodated ? like Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi and Calcutta ? are conspicuously absent from the schedule of three Tests and seven one-day Internationals. 

Instead, the first two Tests are to be played in Ahmedabad, from March 8-12, and Nagpur, from March 16-20. Both are renowned for not being on the tourist route, and have only one hotel each that approaches international standard, while Ahmedabad is also a centre of sectarian tension. The series ends in Mumbai (March 25-29). 

The Indian board justified the venues by saying that they had a policy of rotation and that various associations take turns to stage home Tests. The reality is that the board is overwhelmed by political squabbles and lawsuits. 

If there is any cricketing intent behind the selection of Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Mumbai, it must be that the board wants three grounds that can provide slow, big-turning pitches. That would play into the hands of Indias spinners and make life correspondingly hard for Englands quartet of pace bowlers. 

The one-day venues have also been chosen with an eye to attracting as few England supporters as possible. Again the major cities have been ignored, and it will be a logistical nightmare to fly cricketers and television crews between Indore, Guwahati, Faridabad, Cuttack, Kochi, Visakhapatnam and Goa between April 4 and 22. Goa depends on the local association being exonerated from a charge of alleged malpractices. 

Last time England coped well with the half-filled Test venues of Mohali, Ahmedabad and Bangalore and, with an under-strength side, lost only 0-1. They might have expected better treatment this time; the rotation policy rarely seems to apply to Australia, who are almost always given the main venues. 

England must hope that the Indian boards working committee does not ratify the itinerary announced on Saturday.

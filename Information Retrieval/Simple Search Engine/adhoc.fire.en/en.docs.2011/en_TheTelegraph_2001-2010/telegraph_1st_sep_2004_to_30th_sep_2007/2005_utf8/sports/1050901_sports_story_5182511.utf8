The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav ill, but will play vs NZ 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sourav 

Calcutta: The flu-bug has bitten Team India captain Sourav Ganguly as well. 

However, he wont miss Fridays tri-series match against New Zealand. 

Ive been on medication from yesterday, but I intend playing? Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) fell ill first, followed by Greg Chappell and Veeru (Virender Sehwag)? I hope nobody falls ill after me, Sourav told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. 

Speaking from the team hotel in Harare, he added: Veeru is much better and I expect him to play (versus New Zealand)? Both of us didnt practise today, but we still went to the ground? It was better than remaining in the room. 

Sehwag, it may be recalled, missed the last match ? against Zimbabwe, on Monday. 

Team Indias No.1 engagement on Tuesday, by the way, had been attending the reception hosted by our ambassador to Zimbabwe ? Ajit Kumar. 

The home team, too, was invited as also the Zimbabwe Cricket Union brass.

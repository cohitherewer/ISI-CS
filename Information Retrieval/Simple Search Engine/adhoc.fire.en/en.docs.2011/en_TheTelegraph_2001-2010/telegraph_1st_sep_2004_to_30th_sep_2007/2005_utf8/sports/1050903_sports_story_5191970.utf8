 Sania must cut down on mistakes: Coach 

Within 20 minutes of her third-round win on Friday, Sania Mirza was on the massage table with the physio working on her strained stomach muscle. Its been bothering her since the Cincinnati tournament last month, but like during that memorable February week in Hyderabad, no physical discomfort has been able to eat into her hunger for victory. 

Shes very excited to reach the last-16 of a Grand Slam, though she realises she didnt play her best, Sanias coach John Farrington told The Telegraph shortly after the win over Marion Bartoli. 

The coach is bothered about the number of unforced errors Sania is committing. Though she is hitting several winners, she has to cut down on the mistakes. We are working on that and will be discussing it again later today and tomorrow, said Farrington. 

Maria Sharapova is expected to be the next in line. Can Sania conquer her? 

Absolutely. Sania has the game to beat her? I know Sharapovas name carries a lot of weight. But Sania has played some big names like Serena, Venus and Kuznetsova. So she knows how to go about these big matches. She can handle the pressure, a confident Farrington opined.

 Government responds to ICC

New Delhi: With time running out for India to take a decision on tax exemption for next years Champions Trophy, the government on Tuesday said it has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to approach the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR), which has the exclusive jurisdiction to take a decision in advance. 

Making it clear that the existing provisions did not favour compliance to the conditions set by the ICC so that the event could be staged in India, sports minister Sunil Dutt said ICC has been asked to apply to AAR. 

?The president, ICC, has been informed by the ministry of finance that the most appropriate course will be to move an application before AAR. 

?AAR has the exclusive jurisdiction to decide in advance whether incomes arising out of transactions entered into by non-residents are taxable or not,? Dutt told the Lok Sabha.

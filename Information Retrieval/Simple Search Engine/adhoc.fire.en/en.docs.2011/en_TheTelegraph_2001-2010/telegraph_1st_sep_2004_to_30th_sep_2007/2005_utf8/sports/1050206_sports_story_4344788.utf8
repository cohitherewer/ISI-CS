 Sea Spray upstages Acindar 

 HONKY DORY

 Mumbai: Jockey Colm O?Donoghue was a calm assassin at the races here on Saturday when he dashed the winning hopes of the public-fancy Acindar in the day?s feature event, the 1,200m Nanoli Stud Trophy. The 7-1 shot Sea Spray came from the sixth berth with a good acceleration in the final 200m of the race to topple the 5-2 favourite who had taken a commanding lead inside the last two furlongs. Pesi Shroff, the trainer of the winner, however, got all the accolade from a sizeable Mahalaxmi crowd, instead of the Irishman who rode a well-judged race.

 A noticeable feature at the RWITC raceground was the introduction of a makeshift casino with half-a-dozen roulette tables laid out in the open. Punters had a choice of betting but only a handful of them were seen trying their luck there. ?The club is trying various methods to woo the crowd,? said an RWITC stewards, who did not want to be identified.

 Back home, RCTC, too, is doing all sorts to make a visit to the inter-venue worthwhile. ?Racecrowd deserves small mercies,? said Subir Dasgupta, RCTC totalisator manager from Calcutta over telephone. ?Indian Derby is the third largest attended fixture after city?s New Year?s Day and the Derby. We are providing the crowd with food court, music entertainment and prizes,? announced Dasgupta.

 At the Mahalaxmi, in comparison, the club authorities were not willing to divulge anything about Sunday?s specialities. ?Racing is going to be good fun on Sunday. Wait and watch,? said a senior RWITC official.

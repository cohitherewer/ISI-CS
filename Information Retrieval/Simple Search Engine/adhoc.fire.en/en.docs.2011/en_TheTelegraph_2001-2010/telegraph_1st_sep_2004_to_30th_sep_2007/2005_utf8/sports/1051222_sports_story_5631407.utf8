Sao Paulo: World Club Cup champions Sao Paulo were welcomed home with a huge victory parade which brought the centre of South Americas largest city to a near standstill on Tuesday. 

Thousands of jubilant fans lined the route from the airport to the city centre as the team paraded through the streets in a specially converted open-top truck. 

Having completed a 22-hour flight from Tokyo, the team took around 10 hours to travel from the airport to their Morumbi stadium on the other side of the city where they were greeted by a crowd of around 15,000. 

Many of the players appeared exhausted by the end of the marathon. 

An estimated 5,000 fans gathered at the airport, where goalkeeper and captain Rogerio Ceni waved at fans from the planes cockpit before the team was whisked away through a back exit. 

The truck took around four hours to make the journey to the city centre for a brief meeting with mayor Jose Serra. After that, it made a stop at the Bandeirantes Palace to meet Geraldo Alckmin, governor of Sao Paulo state.

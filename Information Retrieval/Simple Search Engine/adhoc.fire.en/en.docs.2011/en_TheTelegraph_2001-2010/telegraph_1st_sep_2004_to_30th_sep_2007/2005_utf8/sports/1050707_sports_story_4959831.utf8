Calcutta: On a day which saw her Karnataka teammates sweeping almost everything on offer and as many as eight new meet records being scripted at the Subhas Sarobar pool on Wednesday, Madhvi Giri stood out for a special performance. 

The 16-year-old first erased statemate Pooja R. Alvas last years record of 2:35.25 with a timing of 2:29.70 during the heat of the Girls II 200m butterfly at the national junior aquatics meet on Wednesday. Not content with that, she went on to improve the mark further by 0.03.05 seconds in the final and finished the touchline well ahead of New Delhis Harpreet Kaur. 

Pooja had something to cheer for as well as she scooped up the 200m butterfly in Girls I category with a new meet record. Her timing of 2:23.84 was enough to pale Maharashtra rival Pooja Ghorpades 2:37.97, set two years ago, into insignificance. 

Rohit R. Hawaldar of Karnataka continued his gold-winning spree, bagging his fourth when he broke ahead of the field in the 1500m butterfly and was swimming almost alone in finishing at 16:56.49, quite an improvement on his own mark of 17.02.73. 

There was no gold for Bengal, however, and Rajib Chakraborty turned out to be the lone medal winner. His timing of 2:19.90 at 200m butterfly (Boys I) fetched him a bronze. 

Monalisa Mondal, who picked up Girls group II 50m breaststroke gold on Wednesday, disappointed. She finished fourth, with her Karanataka rival Madhuri Giri ? Madhvis sister ? winning the gold. 

Sourav Maity (boys II 200m butterfly) and Ashim Haldar (boys II 200m breatstroke) also failed to make a podium finish, having completed their respective races behind the top-three competitors. 

Bengal boys, however, made it to the waterpolo final five times in a row, when they beat Kerala 12-8. 

There was a surprise presence in the VIP roster, when Dona Banerjee, noted danseuse and wife of Team India regular captain Sourav Ganguly, turned up. She also gave away a few prizes. 

Donas personal swimming coach Pachu Gopal Maity is also the secretary of one of the Bengal Amateur Swimming Association-affiliated clubs. 

Meanwhile, in another development, Calcutta Universitys Souvik Das and Debolina Rajak will represent India in swimming events of the world university games, to be held next month in Turkey.

Sepang: It was a busy day at the Sepang International Circuit, near Kuala Lumpur, on the eve of the Malaysian Grand Prix F1 race. 

Spain?s Fernando Alonso seized provisional pole for Renault Saturday with a blistering lap in first qualifying; down with high fever, BAR-Honda driver Takuma Sato of Japan withdrew and has been replaced by Anthony Davidson of United Kingdom before the practise session Saturday, and Ferrari?s world champion Michael Schumacher was persuaded to apologise to Nick Heidfeld for their collision in the Australian GP. 

Alonso, who started the 2003 race from pole position, clocked a lap of 1:32.582 ? the fastest yet at the Sepang circuit ? just 0.090 seconds quicker than Italian Jarno Trulli, who placed his Toyota on the overnight front row before Sunday?s final qualifying session and nearly half a second faster than last years pole time. 

?I always felt very comfortable here in Sepang,? said the 23-year-old Spaniard. ?For me it is the best circuit in the world in terms of the driver.? 

Championship leader Giancarlo Fisichella, who gave Renault a season-opening victory in Australia, was third quickest ahead of McLaren?s Kimi Raikkonen. 

Germany?s Ralf Schumacher was fifth fastest for Toyota, while his older brother, Ferrari?s seven-time world champion Michael, was a distant 12th. 

Davidson, who replaced Sato, qualified 15th. 

And in the Heidfeld issue, Michael Schumacher had refused to take the blame for his knock with the Williams car, but backed down at a meeting of the Grand Prix Drivers? Association (GPDA) Friday. 

However, drivers quashed reports that they had voted unanimously to ask Schumacher to admit to an error which forced both Germans to retire in Melbourne. ?It was spoken about very openly in the GPDA and it?s all been cleared up,? Williams? Mark Webber said after Saturday?s first qualifying session for Sunday?s Malaysian GP. 

?There was no vote. We?re not that intelligent. We 

just discussed the ethics of what happened. As drivers, we?re not massive (happy) 

about moving about in the braking area. Michael clearly defended once, then maybe 

tried to defend again and that?s what put Nick on the grass.?

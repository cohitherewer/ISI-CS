 Villeneuve on a difficult track

London: The Villeneuve name carries a special resonance at Imola?s Enzo and Dino Ferrari circuit. 

The San Marino Grand Prix of 1982 was Ferrari great Gilles Villeneuve?s last race before he died in practice for the subsequent Belgian Grand Prix. 

A corner of the circuit is dedicated to the Canadian. 

His son Jacques goes there next week for the San Marino Grand Prix and it will be an important race for the 1997 world champion as he struggles to gather speed in his comeback with Sauber.

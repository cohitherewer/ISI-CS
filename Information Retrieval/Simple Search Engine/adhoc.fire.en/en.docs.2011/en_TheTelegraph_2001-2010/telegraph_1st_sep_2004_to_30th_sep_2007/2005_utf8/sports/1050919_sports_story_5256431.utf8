The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan polls pass off peacefully

 - Massive turnout ends 15-year wait 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Amid a massive turnout and much excitement, the long-awaited elections to the Mohun Bagan Athletics Club went off peacefully at Town Hall on Sunday with 4289 voters out of 6500 exercising their franchise. 

Even though the Sania Mirzas and the Uberois were gearing up for a big battle ahead at Netaji Indoor Stadium, just a few yards away, a sea of humanity, of various age and hues, standing in long queues and leading to another city landmark meant the supporters desperately wanted the democratic way of administration to get rolling at the club. A 15-year wait seemed too long for them. 

There were 60 contestants in the race for 20 posts of the executive committee, which would run the club for the next three years. The committee, once elected, will select the president and vice-presidents. 

The counting of votes, under the supervision of the high court-appointed special officer, will be held on Monday and the results will subsequently be informed to the court. The official announcement, of who will run the show at the club, will be made on the following day. 

Both rival factions ? belonging to the outgoing general secretary Anjan Mitra and assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury ? were confident of winning with more than 3000 votes. 

The polls started 25 minutes later than the scheduled time of 9.25 am. About 400 police personnel, 60 RAF and a few detectives in plainclothes ensured the proceedings turned out to be fair. 

According to Ajay Kumar, DC (Central), apart from the arrest of a one false voter, the polls were peaceful. 

Jayanta Mitra, the high court-appointed special officer for the elections, said that the turnout was astonishing. 

It was whos who of the states celebrities taking the queue to cast their vote as the day wore on. 

Sporting greats like P.K. Banerjee, Gurbux Singh, current caches Aloke Mukherjee and Satyajit Chatterjee, 1948 Olympian Ashok Chakraborty and political heavyweights such as Priya Ranjan Das Munshi (also the AIFF president), Somen Mitra, Ajit Panja added the right colour and glamour to the battle for ruling the national club of India.

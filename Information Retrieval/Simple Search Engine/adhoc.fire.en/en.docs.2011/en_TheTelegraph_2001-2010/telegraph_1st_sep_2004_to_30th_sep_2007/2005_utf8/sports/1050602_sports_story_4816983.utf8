 Federer 2 wins away from immortality

Paris: Already rated the most gifted player of his generation, Roger Federer is just two matches away from proving he is one of the most versatile of all time. 

The elegant Swiss has a career Grand Slam in mind having reached the semi-finals of the French Open ? the only one of the four major tournaments he is yet to win. 

Only five players have won all four ? Andre Agassi, Fred Perry, Don Budge, Rod Laver and Roy Emerson. And only Agassi achieved it on the three different surfaces the events are now played on ? grass, hardcourt and clay. 

Were Federer to beat 18-year-old Rafael Nadal in Fridays hugely anticipated semi-final and then triumph in Sundays final, it would confirm that his extraordinary talent is coupled with extreme versatility. 

That would be definitely a dream come true, you know? Federer said. Because it would mean that I won them all. At 23, 24, that would be quite something. (Reuters)

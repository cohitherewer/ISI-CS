Johannesburg: South Africa captain Graeme Smith has demanded an apology from Dwayne Bravo after he was cleared of racially abusing the West Indies allrounder in the fourth test in Antigua. 

Smith was charged with breaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) Code of Conduct after West Indies manager Tony Howard lodged a complaint following Bravos allegation. 

But Match Referee Jeff Crowe found Smith not guilty after a hearing attended by Smith, South African manager Goolam Rajah, convenor of selectors Haroon Lorgat, Howard and Bravo on Wednesday. 

In a statement released on Saturday in which United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) pledged their full support for their captain, Smith said the matter was not over. 

?I will now ask for a public apology from Dwayne Bravo to end this matter,? Smith said. ?If none is forthcoming, I shall take the case further.? 

UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola added: ?I am deeply disappointed by the allegation and, being a good judge of character, I always recognised Graeme to have a sound sense of judgment.? (Reuters)

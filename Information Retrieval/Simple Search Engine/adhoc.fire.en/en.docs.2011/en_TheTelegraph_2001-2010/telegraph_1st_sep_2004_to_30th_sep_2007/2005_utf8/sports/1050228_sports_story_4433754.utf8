The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tollygunge, Vasco aim for draw 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Musah holds the key 

Calcutta: If Tollygunge Agragami have managed to spring a surprise or two in the National Football League (for the ONGC Cup) ? their away performance is really praiseworthy ? Vasco Sports Club are also turning out to be a surprise, though for a wrong reason. 

The Goan outfit were hovering in the relegation zone and notched up their only win against Mohun Bagan last Friday. 

Both teams, however, aim to play safe game and be happy with one point when they face each other at Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. 

If Vasco coach Derek Perreira is unwilling to read too much into their maiden victory in the tournament so far, his counterpart in Tollygunge has adopted the cautious approach because of injuries to key players. 

?I have at least four players on the injury list, and so I cannot afford to take risk,? Tollygunge coach Biswajit Das said. According to him, Suley Musah holds the key against Vasco. 

On the list of Tollygunge absentees are ? Gouranga Dutta (double booking), Kabijit Khotel, Tarif Ahmed (busy with office engagements) and Dinesh Swar (injured). 

?Surajit Bose and Isiaka Awoyemi are also slightly injured, but they will figure in the first XI,? Das confirmed. 

Vasco coach, however, informed that Brazilian Favio Sores has not turned up due to an injury but other two foreigners ? Alex Ambrose and Stanley Rodrigues ? will be in the starting line-up.

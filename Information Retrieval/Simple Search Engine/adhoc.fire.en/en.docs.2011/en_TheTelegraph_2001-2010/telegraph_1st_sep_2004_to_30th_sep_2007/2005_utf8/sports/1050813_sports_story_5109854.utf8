Manchester: Ashley Giles and Simon Jones took three wickets each as England produced a clinical display to leave Australia in tatters in the third Test on Friday. 

The home side, playing above themselves, took their first innings total to 444 just after lunch at Old Trafford, then scythed through the world champions batting, reducing them to 210 for seven by the close of Day II. 

Adam Gilchrist became the highest scoring wicketkeeper-batsman in Test history when he scored three runs, en route to his 30 on the second day of the third Test on Friday. With his 4,541 runs at an average of 54.71, Gilchrist overtook Englands Alec Stewart, who has 4,540 runs to his credit. 

Shane Warne was 45 not out with Jason Gillespie at the other end on four. Giles took three for 66 and fast bowler Jones three for 30. Earlier in the day, Brett Lee and Warne had taken four wickets apiece for the touring side. 

Australia need to reach 245 to avoid the follow-on, should England intend to enforce it. They have not suffered such an indignity in an Ashes encounter since 1986-1987, the last time England won the series. Things went farcically wrong off the pitch as well. 

Batsman Michael Clarke, sidelined since the opening overs of the match with back pains, had to be rushed to the ground from his hotel bed to bat with a runner as the Australian innings imploded. Like his teammates, though, he did not last long. 

With tea approaching, however, Giles ? and Bell ? broke through. Langer, on 31, danced forward, the ball squirted off bat and pad and Bell shot out his right hand to take an instinctive catch at short leg. First ball after tea, Ricky Ponting went forward to Jones and looped a catch off the shoulder of his bat to gully, Bell the catcher again. 

Giles then snared Hayden lbw. With Clarke still recuperating, Katich came in but only managed 17 before falling to Flintoff, who angled a ball back and struck his off stump. Giles then produced a beauty to rival Warne. It was not quite the ball of the century but it was a classic, pitching on Damien Martyns leg stump and hitting off. 

Adam Gilchrist was joined by Warne and the pair put on 53. Gilchrist threatened for a while only to snick Jones behind.

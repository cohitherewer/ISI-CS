Brisbane: Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal scored his maiden century in one-day Internationals to guide Pakistan to a six-wicket win in their triangular series match against the West Indies on Wednesday. 

Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan hit half-centuries to lift the West Indies to 273 for five wickets in their 50 overs. 

Pakistan reached 274 for four in reply, including Akmal?s 124, to win with three overs to spare at the Gabba in Brisbane. 

Pakistan were 36 for two in eight overs after Mervyn Dillon (two for 46) removed opener Salman Butt for 10 and Mohammed Hafeez for two. 

The 23-year-old Akmal, who has 15 one-day caps, shared a 123-run partnership for the third wicket with Shoaib Malik (60). 

Man of the match Akmal faced 125 balls, hitting 12 fours before he was caught at cover off Ian Bradshaw at the start of the 41st over. 

Akmal had put on 80 runs for the fourth wicket with captain Inzamam-ul Haq, whose unbeaten 62 from 51 balls followed his 68 in Pakistan?s four-wicket loss to Australia in Hobart last week. 

It was Pakistan?s first international win on their tour of Australia, after losing all three Tests. 

Pakistan began the match in disarray when paceman Shoaib Akhtar left the field without completing his third over after breaking down due to a hamstring injury. Scans revealed a tear in his left hamstring which could rule him out for the remainder of the tri-series. 

However, captain Inzamam-ul Haq said there was no need to send any reinforcements and that Shoaib would be playing again within one to two weeks. 

?The doctor says he will hopefully be playing after one week and that?s when we?ll get him (back),? he said. 

A two-week stint would all but rule him out of the series until the best-of-three-match final, should Pakistan reach the play-offs against either Australia or the West Indies. 

The West Indies, meanwhile, were suffering their own problems, missing the off-spin of Chris Gayle due to a shoulder problem. 

Gayle was still unfit to bowl and the Windies relied upon expensive part-timers Marlon Samuels, Ramanesh Sarwan and Wavell Hinds. The trio went for a combined 128 runs from 17 overs. 

Gayle survived difficult batting conditions early in the morning session for West Indies to hit seven fours in his 99-ball knock of 82, adding 86 for the first wicket with fellow left-hander Wavell Hinds (29). 

Coming in at 149 for two in the 34th over, the West Indies captain Brian Lara had the perfect stage for a big innings. 

However, the brilliant left-hander fell on 39, slicing a short ball to gully off Rana Naved-ul Hasan after facing 30 balls and stroking six fours. 

Naved-ul Hasan (two for 55) struck again two balls later, removing Ricardo Powell for a first-ball duck. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul (25 not out) and Sarwan (76) then contributed a half-century partnership for the fifth wicket. 

With all three sides having played two matches each, undefeated Australia lead the standings with 11 points ahead of Pakistan (six) and West Indies (one). 

Australia host the West Indies in Brisbane on Friday.

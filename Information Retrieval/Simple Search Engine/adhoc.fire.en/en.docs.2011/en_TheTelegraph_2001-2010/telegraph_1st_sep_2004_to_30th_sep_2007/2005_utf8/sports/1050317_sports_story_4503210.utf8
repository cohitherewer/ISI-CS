The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Bengal go down fighting

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhutia effort in vain 

Calcutta: East Bengal made a valiant attempt 

but lost their AFC Cup away match to Turkmenistan side Nebitchi FC 2-3 in a close 

finish on Wednesday. 

Douglas da Silva?s brother Marcos Secco, the Brazilian 

who was roped in as Douglas? replacement and Bhaichung Bhutia scored for the red-and-gold 

brigade, but that wasn?t enough to avoid defeat. 

The defeat pegged back East Bengal further after their barren draw in the first match at the Salt Lake Stadium against Bangladesh outfit Muktijoddha Sansad last Wednesday. 

The red-and-golds will catch a flight from the central Asian country on Saturday and reach Delhi the next day. They will then travel to Ludhiana for their National League away match against JCT. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal?s Brazilian striker Juliano 

Martins, who was show-caused by the club and has received his letter, is yet to 

send in his reply.

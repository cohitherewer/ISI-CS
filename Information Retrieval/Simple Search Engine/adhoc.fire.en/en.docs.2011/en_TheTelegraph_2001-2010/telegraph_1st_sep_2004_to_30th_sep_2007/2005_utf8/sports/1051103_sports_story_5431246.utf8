 Sachin needs to be looked after properly

Straight Talk

Arjuna Ranatunga

 Sachin Tendulkar in Pune on Wednesday

It is time to take a serious note of India. It was all too easy in Nagpur and Mohali, but they faced the first real challenge of the series in the third ODI. They did not panic or change their approach in Jaipur, rather they came out swinging and showed the surge of belief which is running through their veins. 

It may be a bit too early to say this, but a seriously good team is in the making. The batting is flexible and is being groomed to adapt to different situations and different slots. The opposition can struggle to plan in advance. Bowling and fielding are both on the mend. Indias rise has taken the world by surprise. 

I feel it has happened because they have built competition for berths. When a senior pro like Sourav Ganguly cannot find a place, and he would soon I am sure, it brings the hunger back in the team. There is no other magic in this transformation. This is exactly what we ignored in Sri Lanka in recent years. 

I believe this theory will get its logical extension when the duo of Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell choose to rotate the seniors once the series has been sealed, probably in Pune itself. There is talk of resting Sachin Tendulkar and I support it. Tendulkar needs to be looked after properly. A thoroughbred must only run in the derby. You cant ask for his services for everyday routine. Such a theory will keep throwing alternatives and jostling for spots. Anyone who gets a look-in would approach it with hunger. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni is not a slogger, he has proper defence. The same as it was with Romesh Kaluwitharana in the 90s. Dhoni backs himself both in executing strokes ? recall those sixes over long-on with fielders placed for mishits ? as well as in shifting gears according to situation. It speaks of a selfless approach. He would still have been a hero after his hundred. But he looked at the bigger goal for the team. Cramp or no cramp, he soldiered on. Such men have invaluable impact in the dressing room. 

I am disappointed with a few of our tactics. The bowling and fielding have been unimaginative and routine. 

In our times, we used to do it by staying put in dressing room and rummaging through those long hours of video of days play. It helped us plan against the opposition batsmen and bowlers. Now technology has improved by leaps and bounds. A click can summon a full dossier on a batsman or bowler. But it is proving to be of little use. 

Ideally, a one-day team should have six dependable batsmen, three allrounders and three good fast bowlers who can work well in tandem. Even though Ferveez Maharoof has been taken to the cleaners, I support him. We need bowling allrounders and Maharoof could be one in the making. At the moment he is being defeated by placid pitches and extraordinary Indian openers in Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag. 

It is not as if Sri Lanka have shown no progress. They put up a good total on the board and it came because the two best batsmen of the side ?- Kumara Sangakkara and Jayawardene ? fired. But if the team is honest, it would admit these two alone have been leading the batting charge in recent months. Others need to pull their weight. 

This Indian side can only be subdued by 11 charged and committed men. Otherwise, I suspect a 0-7 drubbing, so much have Sri Lanka fallen behind in the present series.

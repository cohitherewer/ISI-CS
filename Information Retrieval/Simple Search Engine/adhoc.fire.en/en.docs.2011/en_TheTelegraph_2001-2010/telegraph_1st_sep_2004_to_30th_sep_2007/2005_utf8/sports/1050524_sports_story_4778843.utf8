The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Monaco hitch for Karun too

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Even as Narain Karthikeyan was being forced out of the Monaco GP F1 track Sunday with faulty hydraulics, another Indian racing aspirant, Karun Chandhok, was being plagued by gearbox problems at the same venue. 

Karun had his race weekend ruined by a series of gearbox problems first in qualifying and then again in the races, which resulted in a non-finish in the third round of the 2005 World Series at the Monaco circuit where he was competing on the same weekend as Narain, according to information reaching here. 

I drove out the pits and was going up the gears but the gearbox didnt want to change up when I asked it to change up. It was something that we unfortunately couldnt fix during the session and after the first couple laps, I had problems with fifth gear as well. 

This left him down in a frustrated 23rd place.

 Only practice match in Karachi

Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has acceded to a request from its Indian counterpart that Karachi host a practice match during Team Indias tour of the country next year, instead of a one-day International or Test. 

Both the boards have agreed to the extra practice match in Karachi but are waiting for approval from the home ministry, a Pakistan newspaper said on Friday. 

India are scheduled to play five one-dayers and three Tests during the tour, scheduled to take place in February-March. 

The PCB had previously proposed Faisalabad, Multan, Peshawar, Lahore and Karachi as venues for the ODIs and Lahore, Karachi and Multan for Tests. 

During Indias historic tour of Pakistan last year, the Indians played a one-dayer in Karachi after refusing to play a Test match there citing security concerns. 

England, due to tour Pakistan this winter, have also decided not to play in the troubled port city. Since 2000, only Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have played Test matches in Karachi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Doctors not part of all clubs? entourage

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cristiano Junior tragedy has stirred Indian football, not woken it up. 

The country?s premier tournament, the National Football League (NFL), has been underway now for nearly a fortnight and all local organisers have been following the AIFF diktat of posting a qualified doctor and ambulance at the venues. But the practice of teams including a doctor in their entourage has not been made mandatory yet. 

At the NFL committee meeting on January 4, it was decided that all teams should have a doctor or panel of doctors who should be registered with the AIFF. The operative word in this case being ?should? (and not ?must?), not many have taken the advice seriously. 

Mahindra United, for example, didn?t bring a doctor on their recent city visit. Neither did they ask for one from the local organisers. Sporting Clube de Goa, who take on Mohun Bagan at Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday, have a physio in their contingent but no doctor. 

All three city teams featuring in the NFL ? East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Tollygunge Agragami ? have a doctor travelling with them.

 Sandipan, Bakre earn full points

 Sandipan is back to winning ways 

Pardubice: Grandmaster Tejas Bakre scored a resounding victory over International Woman Master Eugenia Chasovnikov of Russia in the fourth round on an otherwise average day for the Indian contingent in the Czech International Open chess tournament here. 

On a day when Bakre emerged as the lone Indian to win on higher boards, overnight joint leader international master S. Poobesh Anand came up with another inspired performance to hold higher rated IM Alexei Gavrilov of Russia to take his tally to 3.5 points. 

Meanwhile, Ukrainian IMs Yuri Vovk and Valery Shalimov emerged joint leaders in the 332-player event, defeating Alexander Zubarev of Ukraine and Konstantin Shanava of Georgia, respectively, in their fourth round game. 

While both leaders have maintained a clean slate thus far in the event, Bakre and Poobesh Anand are part of the next group of 3.5 pointers with 12 others. 

It turned out to be an average day for the 12-member Indian contingent as only Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda could manage to score the full point apart from Bakre. 

Having lost the third round game to compatriot IM S. Satyaprgyan, Chanda had his task cut out against Martin Rehorek of the Czech Republic and he executed his plan wisely to notch an easy victory with black pieces. 

Among the other Indians, Eesha Karavade ended on the losing side against Pavel Anisimov of Russia who played black as did Rahul Shetty against Nadezhda Polivoda of Ukraine. 

Also losing her game was Kruttika Nadig who went down to Tomas Zeleny of Czech republic.

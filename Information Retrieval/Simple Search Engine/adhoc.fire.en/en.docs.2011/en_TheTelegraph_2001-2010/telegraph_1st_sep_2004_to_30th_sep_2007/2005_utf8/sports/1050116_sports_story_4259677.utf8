Calcutta: Bengal?s ploy to start the innings with Sanjib Sanyal worked well as the allrounder shone with both bat and ball against Assam in the national one-dayer (East Zone) match at the Eden on Saturday. 

Sanyal, opening the batting for Bengal for the first time in one-dayers (previously, he had batted at the top in the Ranji Trophy match against Hyderabad in 2002-03) scored 51 and bagged three for 45 as Bengal won the match by 68 runs. 

The hosts, opting to bat on winning the toss, posted 294 for six in their 50 overs. In reply, the visitors were all out for 226. The win helped Bengal to collect five points (including a bonus). 

Besides Sanyal, captain Devang Gandhi (52), former captain Rohan Gavaskar (62) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (45) performed well with the bat to help the hosts pile up a good total. 

Sanyal, partnering Arindam Das (17) started the innings shakily. However, he grew in confidence as the innings progressed. 

Das? departure allowed captain Devang Gandhi to come, and he guided his partner well. The duo put on 85 from 93 balls for the second wicket. However, at the time when Sanyal was supposed to build on all the hardwork, he threw away his wicket. He went to drive R. Satish on the up and saw his middle stump uprooted. 

?I don?t have a hundred since the last two years. I had the chance to make a big score Saturday, but failed,? a disappointed Sanyal said after the match. But, Sanyal made up for the loss with some good bowling performance. He bowled to a line and troubled the batsmen with the incoming delivery in the afternoon session. He was amply supported by Ranadeb Bose (three for 36) and Sourashish Lahiri (two for 39). 

The bowlers, perhaps buoyed by Team India captain Sourav Ganguly?s presence (who paid a surprise visit to the Eden) produced a much better performance than they did against Tripura. 

Allrounder Manoj Tewari, who has been selected for the India under-19 squad to play England colts, failed to impress with the bat and ball as he scored 24 runs and went for 11 runs from one over. Assam?s run chase started on a disastrous note. 

Opener Pervez Aziz and captain Zuffri, batting one down, perished one after the other with the score reading just eight.The third wicket fell inside the first 10 overs as the visitors were reduced to 28 for three. By then, the hosts were never in doubt of the win. But they were concerned about the bonus point. 

The visitors needed to score 235 to deny Bengal the bonus. And V. Sarvanan nearly succeeded with his patient 95 (4x11, 1x6) off 103 balls. However, his dismissal (at 211 for six) opened the floodgates as the next four wickets fell for only 15 runs.

 I expected Souravs recall: Inzamam

Islamabad: With the high-voltage Indo-Pakistan series just over a fortnight away, Inzamam-ul Haq fired the first salvo by hinting that former Sourav Ganguly would be under pressure to perform. 

Inzamam said the Indian selectors had picked Sourav because of his experience and past record, and expect him to deliver the goods when the three-Test series kicks off in Lahore on January 13. 

Sourav is a very experienced campaigner... I think they (selectors) are counting on him to deliver in Pakistani conditions, Inzamam was quoted as saying in a paper here. 

Sourav has a lot of experience of playing against us. I think they preferred him over Mohammed Kaif for this very reason... I had expected Sourav to be picked, he said. 

Experience was the theme around which the Indian selectors had woven their squad, Inzamam felt. The Indian selectors have shown by recalling Sourav, Parthiv Patel and Zaheer Khan that they are banking on experience. These men have already played in Pakistan, Inzamam said. 

Inzamam, of course, didnt forget to remind the opposition that his players are also in good nick and would strive to keep the momentum going after refreshing victories in the Test and ODI series over Ashes winners England. 

Our boys are confident too after a good series against England and in very good form. I have made it clear to them that the series against India will be totally different and we need to keep on doing the basic things right. 

India are also coming here after having beaten Sri Lanka, so they will also be confident? It will be a good contest, he said. 

Inzamam said the 2-0 Test series victory over England will count for nothing as the pressures of an India-Pakistan series surpasses every other contest. 

The captain said he would be relying on pace attack, as Indians played spin better. 

Our strength lies in pace with all our bowlers doing really well against England. Mohammad Asif also had a good debut? we were keen to develop a pack of pacers for the India series, Inzamam said. 

The skipper said young pacer Umar Gul figures in his plan for the series and could be selected in the Test squad.

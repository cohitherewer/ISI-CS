The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav set to be in Team India XI

 - Dhoni hours away from Test debut Cyclone may disrupt cricket 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Chennai: After nearly five weeks of what some still call pyjama cricket, its back to flannels. Conventional cricket, in other words, but theres bound to be a one-day hangover as both India and Sri Lanka havent played Test cricket for months. 

That, then, is the backdrop for the three-Test Videocon Cup ? scheduled to get underway at the Chepauk on Friday. In the backdrop, too, is the threat of a cyclone-influenced disruption. 

It was overcast throughout Thursday and there wasnt much sunshine on the previous days either. Given that the groundstaff hasnt had an extended opportunity to prepare the wicket, the Lankans are a trifle wary. On record, though, coach Tom Moody said it looks good. 

The wicket, incidentally, was prepared for last weeks ODI against South Africa. Owing to rain, not a ball was bowled. Traditionally, Chepauk offers something for everybody: Bounce and turn for the bowlers, conducive for the batsmen as well. 

While the wicket shouldnt really challenge, at least not early on, switching from a one-day mode to Test cricket may make a heavy demand. The team which does so without missing a step ought to start with an appreciable advantage. 

Of course, limited overs cricket is very different, but its unlikely that the Lankans have recovered from a 1-6 thrashing in the ODI series which ended three weeks ago. We played really good cricket to shut them out, but thats no guarantee that we will win the Test series, too... Weve got to continue with good cricket, pointed out Rahul Dravid. 

Dravid, by the way, is going to be leading India as full-fledged Test captain for the first time and remarked he would be looking for guidance from the seniors. As he put it, very honestly: I cant do everything on my own... 

Wife Vijeta and little Samit will be cheering for him. 

Whats also going to be challenging for Lanka is that only four players ? Atapattu, vice-captain Chaminda Vaas, Mahela Jayawardene and Muttiah Muralidharan (whose in-laws are here) ? havent ever played Tests before in India. 

In fact, the last Test series featuring Lanka was eight years ago. 

Dravid didnt announce the XI, but The Telegraph learns that both Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman ? overlooked for the 12 ODIs versus Lanka and South Africa ? would make the line-up. 

The in-form Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif will have to sit out, unless the former gets accommodated if Virender Sehwag cant play owing to a slight left shoulder strain. 

Assuming Sehwag is fit, he and Gautam Gambhir are to be followed by the captain, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav and Laxman. After eight months, Sachin gets the chance to have another go at a 35th century. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni is hours from his Test debut and the bowling is expected to be in the hands of Anil Kumble (he, too, didnt feature in the ODIs) and Harbhajan Singh; Ajit Agarkar and Irfan Pathan. 

Given that he got picked as an allrounder, Sourav can have a double role. Dravid indicated as much during an interaction with the Media. 

The Lankans are looking at options and with veteran Sanath Jayasuriya relegated to domestic cricket, rookie opener Upul Tharanga may get capped. He was in the ODI squad.

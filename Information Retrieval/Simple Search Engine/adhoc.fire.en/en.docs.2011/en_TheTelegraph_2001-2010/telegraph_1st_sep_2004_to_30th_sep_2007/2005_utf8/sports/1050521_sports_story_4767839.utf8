 Sania bows out in 2nd round

New Delhi: Sania Mirzas challenge in the $170,000 WTA Strasbourg Open came to an end when she and partner Katarina Kachlikova of Solvakia bowed out in the second round of the doubles event. The qualifiers, who had upset top seeds Bryanne Stewart and Samantha Stosur of Australia in the opening round, went down to Marta Domachowaska of Poland and German Marlene Weingartner 6-7 (2-7), 6-1, 6-7 (5/7) on Thursday night. 

Sania and Katarina had earlier come through two tough qualifying rounds, beating Frances Emile Banquet and Magda Mahalache of Romania in the first round and Kim Grant of South Africa and Israels Yevgenia Savransky in the next. 

This is the first tournament for the 18-year old Hyderabadi girl on her return from an eight-week injury lay off. The first Indian to win a WTA Tour title has gained a direct entry into the French Open singles main draw beginning on Monday. (PTI)

 Johl, Randhawa in Asia squad

 Johl moves in as a wild-carder 

Bangkok: India?s Amandeep Johl was among four golfers picked Wednesday as wild cards to round off Asia?s 12-member team for next month?s Visa Dynasty Cup defence against Japan. Thatmakes it two Indians in the squad, including automatic choice Jyoti Randhawa. 

The other three to make the team were China?s Zhang lian-Wei and Liang wen-Chong and Thammanoon Srirot of Thailand. 

The four ?captain?s picks? join the eight automatic qualifiers headed by current Asian Tour leader Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand for the Ryder Cup-style team event to be held at Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen from April 15 to 17. 

Asia?s eight automatic qualifiers were chosen according to rankings determined after the Myanmar Open Sunday. 

Thongchai is joined by countrymen Thaworn Wiratchant, Boonchu Ruangkit and Prayad Marksaeng, along with South Korea?s Charlie Wi and Mo joong-Kyung, India?s Jyoti Randhawa and Mardan Mamat of Singapore. 

After a nine-point defeat in the first contest two years ago, Japan this time will roll out its top guns, including three-time USPGA Tour winner Shigeki Maruyama, Toshimitsu Izawa and Shingo Katayama. 

Asia?s non-playing captain Hsieh min-Nan said he was optimistic of a successful defence ?as we have the best 12 players in Asia?.

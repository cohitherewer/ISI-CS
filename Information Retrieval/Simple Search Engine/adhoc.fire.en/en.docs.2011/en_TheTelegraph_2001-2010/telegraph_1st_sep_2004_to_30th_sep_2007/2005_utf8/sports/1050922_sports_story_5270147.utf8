The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We can cause an upset, says Leander Paes

New Delhi: Davis Cup captain Leander Paes said that India had a chance of upsetting seven-time champion Sweden if the players performed to their potential in the world group play-off to be held here from September 23 to 25. 

The one thing that I dont do is put up a white flag. When I say we have to put our best foot forward, we have to make sure is that we take every single thing that we have got, Paes said at the pre-draw media conference at the R. K. Khanna Stadium. 

Winning or losing is not always in your hands. As long as the players play to their full potential, they give themselves a chance. 

The teams had their practice session on Wednesday at the match venue. While the home captain was happy with the surface at the Khanna Stadium, the visitors felt the practice courts at the NSCI complex, 10kms away, was better. 

With grass courts, it has got to do with the mentality of the player. You have to expect bad bounce, be ready for everything. Grass at Wimbledon in the second week is horrible. It is the same for both the teams, Swedens non-playing captain Mats Wilander said. 

The hot and humid conditions continued to take its toll on the Swedes. Their top singles player Thomas Johansson had to cut short his training midway through the evening session, and was attended by the team doctor. 

Wilander said Johanssons was not a case similar to his teammate Andreas Vinciguerra who was completely dehydrated on the second day. 

Thomas has not had proper sleep, having travelled from far (China where he played a Tour event before joining the team on Tuesday). He was flat after the morning session, slept before evening practice and so could not feel the body fully upto it, Wilander said, erasing any doubts over his availability. 

Vinciguerra, who returned from the hospital on Tuesday, was back to practice. Wilander confirmed the availability of the 433-ranked player. 

Paes said he had the experience of having played in giv-en conditions but that does not necessarily mean that other players would not be playing. 

No doubt I have the experience and knowledge but bei-ng a playing captain is a huge responsibility. We have to cho-ose the best guy, who has play-ed the maximum matches on Tour and physically, mentally fit to play singles, Paes said.

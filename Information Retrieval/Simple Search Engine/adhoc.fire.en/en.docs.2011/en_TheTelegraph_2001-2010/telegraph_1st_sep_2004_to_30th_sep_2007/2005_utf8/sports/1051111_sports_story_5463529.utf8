 Arjun a great guy, says Woods

Shanghai: After Vijai Singh, it is now the turn of Tiger Woods to speak highly of Arjun Atwal. 

After the first round of the HSBC Championship, Woods said, Ive known Arjun for a while. He has a place in Orlando and I think he might become a member at the same club (Isleworth Golf and Country Club). 

I saw him around there quite often this summer and have been practising together sometimes. Arjun is a great guy. I enjoy his company and its always fun to play practice rounds with him. 

On Atwals progress this year, Woods said: Hes had some success. This year at the Bellsouth he played really well and came close and was in a play-off and he lost unfortunately. He will do well. 

Woods said with talented players around, Indian golf was headed in the right direction. 

Yeah, it is growing. (I think) Atwal is obviously a big icon there in India and he should be. You know more importantly, hes a great guy. So I think he is going to be great for Indian golf. Im sure theres quite a few juniors in the pipeline that are coming up. 

Recently Atwal mentioned he might soon join the Isleworth Golf and Country Club, which is the home course for Woods. The club is about 10 minutes drive from Atwals home in Florida and the two have even practised together at times. (PTI)

 Tendulkar back in Team India

 - Sreesanth only new face in XV 

 Tendulkar and Gambhir 

Mohali: Sachin Tendulkar returned to the team after a six-month injury lay-off, while pacemen Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra were dropped from the 15-member Indian squad named on Friday for the first two matches of the one-day cricket series against Sri Lanka. 

The 32-year-old, who underwent surgery on his left elbow in May, was included in the 15-strong squad for the first two games of the series despite only making 12, 4 and 22 in this weeks return in a domestic one-day series. 

Tendulkars last international appearance was in the final one-dayer of a six-match home series against Pakistan in April, which the visitors won 4-2. 

The surgery forced the Mumbai cricketer to skip a tri-series in Sri Lanka in July-August as well as a subsequent tour of Zimbabwe. 

The squad, to be led by new captain Rahul Dravid, will be without former skipper Sourav Ganguly, who was axed from the post on Thursday. Sourav is also nursing a tennis elbow injury. 

One-day specialist Mohammad Kaif (hamstring injury) and left-arm paceman Ashish Nehra (buttock strain) were also excluded. 

More said Anil Kumbles fitness will be reviewed on October 18. 

The selection committee has pitched for youth with an eye on building the side for the 2007 World Cup, chief selector Kiran More said. 

More said he had spoken to Dravid, currently in Sydney for the Super Test, before finalising the squad. 

Gautam Gambhir is making a comeback after two and a half years, while Kerela paceman S. Sreesanth is the lone new face. We are trying out youngsters with an eye on the future. Good performances by seniors in domestic competitions will certainly be considered, More said. 

India has not performed well in the last 35 to 40 one-day Internationals, and thats a cause for concern, he added. Dravid led well on the few occasions he has captained. We intend giving him a fair run. 

India are scheduled to play seven matches in the home series starting October 25. 

Sreesanth surprised 

Sreesanth admitted he did not expect to be picked in the Indian squad and probably his dismissal of Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman in the Challenger Trophy helped his case. 

I didnt go into the competition thinking I was competing with someone for a place in the Indian team, Sreesanth said. Not even after I won the Man of the Series award did I think Id be selected to play for the country. It probably helped me that I picked up a couple of big wickets, including those of Sachin and Laxman, the Kerala speedster added.

Roger Federer could hardly have been more complimentary about Andy Murray on Tuesday, Switzerlands world No.1 disclosing before this weekends Davis Cup tie that he considers the British teenager to be a great player and a talent. 

Federer says he believes Murray is a genuine threat to the Swiss team. 

There is a fascinating possibility that Federer will play Murray during Fridays opening singles rubbers on the indoor clay court that is sited close to a runway at Geneva Airport. 

And if the much-anticipated match does take place, Federer clearly does not expect Murray to disappear in a puff of clay-court dust. 

Andy Murray is clearly a talent. I hadnt really heard of him until Wimbledon this summer, when he reached the third round, but he has had some good results since then and I think that the Swiss team has to watch out for him, Federer said. 

It appears that Federer has been tracking the 18-year-olds recent progress. 

When the draw was made in May, I was very positive and optimistic that we would win the tie, but since then Greg Rusedski has played well and Murray has come through. I was impressed with how Murray played at Wimbledon and also at the other tournaments over the summer in the US, said the Wimbledon and US Open champion. 

Jeremy Bates, the British Davis Cup captain, has until Thursdays draw ceremony to decide whether he wants to select Murray to play in the Friday singles against Federer. 

Bates may opt to rest Murray for that particular rubber, instead picking David Sherwood or Alan Mackin as his second singles nomination, and save the young Scot for the Saturday doubles and the Sunday reverse singles. 

Murray, having trained with the rest of the team in the French town of Evian, is apparently chomping at the bit to play Federer in what would be his first singles Davis Cup rubber. 

He is patently not concerned about being asked to play three best-of-five matches over three days. Federer has also suggested that when the Swiss came to choosing the surface for the tie, which will decide which team plays in the 16-nation World Group next season, they did so without considering the emergence of Murray. 

Murray is particularly handy on clay, as he has based his training on the clay courts of Barcelona, building a game that is suited to hitting countless groundstrokes. 

We didnt know Murray that well when we picked the surface. But no matter what surface you play on against Murray hes become a great player over the last few months.

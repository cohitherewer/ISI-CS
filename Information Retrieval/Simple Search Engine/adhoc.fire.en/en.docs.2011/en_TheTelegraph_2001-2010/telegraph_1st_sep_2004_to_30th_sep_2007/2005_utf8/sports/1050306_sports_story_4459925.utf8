The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Zimbabwe battered in 2 days 

 - Taibu?s team should be stripped of Test status: Houghton 

 Nicky Boje picked up 4 wickets 

Cape Town: Zimbabwe became only the third team in modern times to lose a Test inside two days when they were beaten by an innings and 21 runs in the first Test by South Africa at Newlands on Saturday. 

The hosts laid the foundations for the humiliating thrashing by skittling out Zimbabwe for 54 runs on Friday in their first innings. 

Only twice since 1945-46 has a match ended in two days ? when England beat the West Indies at Leeds in 2000 and when Australia defeated Pakistan in Sharjah in 2002-03. 

Zimbabwe at least put up sterner resistance in their second innings with a defiant innings of 72 by Dion Ebrahim and some late slogging by Andy Blignaut almost forcing the hosts into batting again ? but the tourists were finally bowled out for 265. 

South Africa?s first innings of 340 for three declared was the fastest in the history of Test cricket. 

They surpassed the previous record of 296 off 51 overs at a rate of 5.8 held by Australia against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2002-2003. 

It was the third world record of the match following Jacques Kallis?s whirlwind half-century off only 24 balls and the 286-run first innings lead after the first day of a Test. 

South Africa?s declaration gave them the opportunity to become the 18th team to win a Test match in two days, a feat more frequent in the early days of Test cricket when South Africa were themselves victims on seven occasions. 

Meanwhile, former Zimbabwe captain Dave Houghton felt the country should be stripped of their Test status to save them from suffering a repeat of the humiliation. 

?I think Zimbabwe should come out of it for a little while and play against Bangladesh, Kenya and the A teams,? Houghton, now coach of Derbyshire, told Sky Sports. 

?It?s time someone told them the truth ? you can?t have this cricket on the international arena,? added Houghton. 

?These guys are coming out of schoolboy sides straight into the international arena. It is really a ?men against kids? game and it is very loosely described as Test cricket.?

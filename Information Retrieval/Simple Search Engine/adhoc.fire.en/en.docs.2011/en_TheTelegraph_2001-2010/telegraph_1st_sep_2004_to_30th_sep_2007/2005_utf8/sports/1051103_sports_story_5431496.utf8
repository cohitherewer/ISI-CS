 Holders CSKA await Carvalho return

London: Holders CSKA Moscow are counting on the return of Brazilian playmaker Daniel Carvalho to lift the side for Thursdays Uefa Cup tie at Dutch club Heerenveen after defeat in their opening group stage game. 

CSKA lost 1-2 at home to Olympique Marseille in Group F two weeks ago when Carvalho was injured, but will be boosted by a win over Rostov at the weekend that put them one victory away from clinching the Russian title. 

Carvalhos fellow Brazilian, striker Vagner Love, and Russia winger Yuri Zhirkov should also be fit to play after scoring against Rostov. 

Heerenveen will seek to make things difficult for the champions, however, in the first meeting between the clubs in the competition. The Dutch side can take heart after holding Romanians Dinamo Bucharest to a goalless draw last time. 

English side Middlesbrough could go clear at the top of Group D if they beat Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, whose veteran coach Yevgeny Kucherevsky resigned recently. 

The Ukrainian team lost last time to joint leaders AZ Alkmaar who are not in action this week. 

Steve McLarens team is on a high after crushing Manchester United 4-1 in the Premier League on Sunday and chairman Steve Gibson believes the club are contenders for European success. 

Jean Tiganas first test as coach of Turkish club Besiktas will be a tough assignment at Sevilla, who are unbeaten in five Primera Liga matches ? only conceding two goals in that run. It is the Spanish sides first game in group H.

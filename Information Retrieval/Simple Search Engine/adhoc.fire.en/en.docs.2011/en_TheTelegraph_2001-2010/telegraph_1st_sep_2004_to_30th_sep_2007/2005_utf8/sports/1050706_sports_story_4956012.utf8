 - CONDITIONING CAMP 

Bangalore: A fresh batch of players trooped into the National Cricket Academy here Tuesday for a physical fitness and conditioning camp ahead of the triangular series in Sri Lanka. 

The only absentees were V. V. S. Laxman and Murali Kartik. Laxman is now slated to join the rest of the players on Thursday while the left-arm spinner will be available later. The camp, which kicked off Tuesday, runs till July 12 ? a day after which the final phase of the camp, focusing on cricket skills, will begin. 

Indias top 15 fast bowlers concluded a week-long camp Monday. They were Tuesday joined by Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Y. Venugopala Rao, Neeraj Patel, Dheeraj Jadhav, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Dinesh Karthik, Parthiv Patel, Anil Kumble, Murali Kartik, Sridharan Sriram and Hemang Badani. 

Sourav Ganguly, Dinesh Mongia and Harbhajan Singh will join the camp on July 13, while Irfan Pathan, playing for Middlesex in the English county, is expected here on July 10. 

The camps, supervised by coach Greg Chappell, trainer Gregory King and physio John Gloster, are aimed at preparing the cricketers for the rigours of international cricket ahead of a hectic season. 

Former physio Andrew Leipus has joined the camp as a consultant. 

Dhoni reiterated that he was ready to open if given a chance. If they (team management) want me to open, I can open; if they want me to bat at number three, I will do so; if they want to bat at number seven, thats also good for me, the 23-year-old from Jharkhand said. 

He is eagerly looking forward to the season and ready for extra responsibility. 

Delhi batsman Gambhir said: I am working on converting decent starts into big ones. 

Its more of a mental thing, he admitted. Playing international cricket is a different ball game, not like first class or domestic cricket. One needs to be mentally more tough, more focused and determined, and concentration needs to be at a peak? I am working to keep on improving

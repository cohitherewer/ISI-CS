The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Want to win it for coach: Dipendu

 - Bengal plan double covering for Dias, Yadav today 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Its time to deliver, feels Dipendu 

Calcutta: This could have been the story of a footballers premature exit from the field. Rejected by Mahindra United and treated much the same way by Mohun Bagan ? because of a congenital problem in his heart ? Dipendu Biswas had little option but to wait for another chance to prove his worth. 

Then came Aloke Mukherjees call for the Santosh Trophy and the striker now hopes to justify the coachs trust in him. 

As Bengal, hit by injuries to some key players and absence of Bhaichung Bhutia and Mehtab Hussain, prepare for their first match against Maharshtra in the quarter final stage at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi on Sunday, Dipendu knows its time to deliver and make his case presentable to those who have doubted his form and fitness. 

I wont say Ive a point to prove, but honestly speaking, I want to win the match for my coach, Dipendu told The Telegraph from Kochi on Saturday. 

Incidentally, this Maharashtra side consists of many players who were my teammates in Mahindra. But no, revenge wont be on my mind? itll be the pride of wearing the Bengal jersey, an urgency that we have to win it for Alokeda, he added. 

It has been raining heavily in Kochi for the past few days and Dipendu believes the slushy ground will stand his team in good stead. Were accustomed to playing under such conditions and I think it will serve our purpose positively, he pointed out. 

The Bengal coach, on the other hand, indicated that Sasthi Duley in the half-line and Saumik Dey in the defence will take care of Steven Dias. Were also planning double covering for Abhishek Yadav, he added. 

With Subhas Chakraborty ruled out with a groin injury, Amulya Mandol is set to start on the right. Noel Wilson, recovering from a hamstring injury may come in the starting line-up, but the coach indicated Madhab Das could be used later in the match. 

Meanwhile, Mehtab Hussain is likely to join the squad on Monday.

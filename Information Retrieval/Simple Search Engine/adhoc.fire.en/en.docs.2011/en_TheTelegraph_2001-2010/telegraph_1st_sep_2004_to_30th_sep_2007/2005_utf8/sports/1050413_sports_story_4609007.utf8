 Gilchrist may quit after 2007 Cup

Sydney: Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist 

has said he may retire from international cricket after 2007 World Cup. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman told a magazine that he wanted to spend more time with his children, three-year-old Harrison and baby Annie. 

The 33-year-old said he wanted to keep playing until the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, but would consider quitting after then. 

?My battle to survive in cricket these next few years is going to be a mental battle more than a physical one. It seems I?m always questioning myself now as to whether I should be away and how good it would be to be at home,? he told the magazine. 

?It?s been that way since I had children. At this stage Harrison and Annie are at an age where it?s all lost on them. ?But by the time they reach a stage where they can identify with what I?ve done or where I fit in society, I plan on being around a lot more and in a better position to keep a rein on things.? 

Gilchrist already ranks as one of the world?s greatest 

cricketers. He has scored nearly 4,500 Test runs at an average of 55.65, including 

15 centuries, and taken 260 catches and 27 stumpings. He has also scored almost 

7,000 runs in ODIs and over 400 dismissals. (Reuters)

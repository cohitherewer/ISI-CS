 Kidambi upsets 

Sasikiran 

Hyderabad: International Master (IM) S. Kidambi stunned top seed Krishnan Sasikiran while Grandmaster Koneru Humpy moved up to the joint second position after the fifth round of the fifth Asian Chess Championship here on Monday. 

Humpy shared the second spot with IM Neelotpal Das. 

Kidambi outplayed Sasikiran in the Meran variation of Queens gambit, with calculated moves combined with aggression, sacrificing his knight to get a positional advantage. He unleashed his pieces to rip open the GMs defence. 

At one stage Sasikiran even offered to sacrifice his queen for bishop and rook but Kidambi went for the kill instead and the top seed resigned in the 30th move. 

Humpy, with black pieces, played Pirc defence to defeat Sergey Kayumov of Uzbekistan in 44 moves with two pawns up aided by positional advantage. 

The Uzbek could not wriggle out of the difficult situation created due to the pawn structure and a solid midgame by Humpy who logged 4 full points to stay in contention for the title against a formidable Chinese contingent. 

Neelotpal worked out a fine strategy to hold GM Susanto Megaranto of Indonesia in 28 moves to follow Zhang Zhong of China, who led the table with 4.5 points. 

Im happy with my performance, a jubilant Neelotpal said. 

Of the five matches Ive played so far, I won three and drew two against Grandmasters and its good going.

 Beijing: ?One World, One Dream? is the slogan of 2008 beijing olympics, it was officially announced here at a gala ceremony. The slogan replaces the previous one ?New Beijing, Great Olympics?, which had been used during the city?s bid for the 2008 Games.

 ?One World, One Dream? was selected from more than 210,000 entries received from around the world.

 ?There was no single winner. The slogan embodies the wisdom of hundreds of thousands of people,? president of the Beijing Organising Committee for Olympic Games (Bocog), Liu Qi said.

 Bocog launched a global search for a slogan in January and it was picked after several rounds of selection and revision by experts in fields like Olympics, sociology, sports, culture and language.

 Ankara: Fatih Terim is to coach Turkey again after a nine-year gap following Wednesday?s sacking of Ersun Yanal over a run of disappointing results in qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup.

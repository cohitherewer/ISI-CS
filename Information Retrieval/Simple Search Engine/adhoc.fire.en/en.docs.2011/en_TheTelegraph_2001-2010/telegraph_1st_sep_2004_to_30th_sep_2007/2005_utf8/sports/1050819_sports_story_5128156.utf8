A season that they hope will end in World Cup glory began in humiliating fashion Wednesday night, England slumping to their heaviest defeat under Sven-Goran Eriksson. Denmark, superior tactically and technically, brutally exposed Englands defensive weaknesses in the second half, striking four times to the sole response from Wayne Rooney. 

And so Rooney and company went the way of the last band of vaunted English entertainers to visit the Parken Stadium, the 2001 Eurovision entrants, who trailed in 15th with a ditty entitled No Dream Impossible. Englands footballers will hope so after this shocking display, in which David James endured a nightmare 45 minutes. 

Friendlies under Eriksson have often been a tale of two halves: first occasionally promising, second less inspiring. That familiar theme continued here last night. Yet even when England showed signs of life in the opening period, there were always moments of concern such was the excellence of Claus Jensen and Tomasson. 

Few, though, could have predicted Englands second-half collapse and a few reputations took a battering. Rooney, certainly, needs to impose his undoubted strengths more judiciously. The rampaging bullock that is Rooney had at least injected some interest into a first half that was dispiritingly featureless even by Englands woeful standards in friendly fare. 

It had taken time for the Manchester United player to become involved, more than 19 minutes until he was running into Thomas Sorensens box and threatening to exploit a promising situation created by David Beckhams low cross. 

No joy came Rooneys way on this occasion, but he was slowly becoming the central figure in the opening drama, part leading man, part pantomime villain booed by the Copenhagen public. He kicked the ball away petulantly, executed a hand-off on Per Nielsen that was more British Lions than Three Lions, and treated a Norwegian linesman to some Anglo-Saxon invective. 

Beckham soon intervened, ordering Rooney to calm down. Rooney being Rooney, one-part liability to nine-parts alchemist, he still conjured up some moments of magic, such as a mazy run from the edge of Englands area, and a fine lay-off to Frank Lampard, whose shot was blocked by Daniel Agger. 

England, though, were misfiring, the best chance of the half falling to Jermain Defoe, who met Steven Gerrards cross with a volley that Sorensen repelled athletically. From Beckhams ensuing corner, John Terry saw his goalbound header deflected over. 

England were increasingly disappointing, too often given a lesson in the art of using the ball by foot-soldiers from Fulham, the two Jensens, Claus and Niclas. With Ferdinand hesitant in defence, England were often on the back foot and only a terrific, sliding challenge from Gerrard stopped Jesper Gronkjaer causing more mayhem down the right after the half-hour mark. 

Moving fluidly in their 4-2-3-1 formation, Denmark continued to pose problems and Paul Robinson needed to be on his toes to deal with a long-range effort from Claus Jensen. 

Englands rise up the Fifa world rankings to seventh, and their status as one of the favourites for next summers World Cup, was mocked as Morten Olsens slick Danes passed their way quickly forward. In an attempt to introduce some life into the lame proceedings, and keep Premiership club managers happy, Eriksson dispatched four substitutes into the fray at the start of the second half. 

Michael Owen ran on busily to replace Defoe, grateful for some action. Defoe will have been disappointed with his evenings shift, but he is sure to fill in for the suspended Owen when England travel to Cardiff on September 3. 

Humiliatingly for England, it was a Danish arrival who had the most immediate impact. Rommedahl had already been on some lively breaks when he made his most telling contribution on the hour. His goal was a mess from Englands perspective, primarily by David James. 

When Tomasson began racing down the inside-right channel, with Ashley Cole in close attendance, James sprinted from his area in an attempt to clear. Tomasson dashed on, ignoring James ill-judged approach and reached the byline. Cole, falling off-balance, sought despairingly to tackle Tomasson, but the Denmark captain kept his cool ? and his feet ? to roll the ball across into a six-yard box still vacated by James. Rommedahl, almost smiling, tapped the ball in.

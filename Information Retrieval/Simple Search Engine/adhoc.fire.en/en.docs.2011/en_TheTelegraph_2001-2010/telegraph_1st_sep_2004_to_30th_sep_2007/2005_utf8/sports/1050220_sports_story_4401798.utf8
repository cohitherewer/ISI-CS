 WI players to sue daily

Port-of-Spain: The West Indies Players? Association (WIPA) said it is suing the Trinidad Guardian for slander over a report that said players were more interested in womanising than cricket during a disappointing recent tour of Australia. 

The West Indies won only one of their six one-day Internationals of the tri-series tournament, also involving Australia and Pakistan. 

The newspaper on Thursday published a February 12 critical report (written by Richard Nowell, who accompanied the team to Australia) by Digicel, the Irish-based company and the official sponsor of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). 

Players received late-night visits from women before important matches, and would have won the series had they scored as many runs as they had women?s telephone numbers, the newspaper quoted from Nowell?s report. 

?I know men need to have fun while on tour. However, not at the expense of their performance,? he wrote, saying the players were ?poor ambassadors? motivated only by money. 

Digicel has invested $20 million in the team, Nowell said. 

?Those comments contained unjustified imputations on the character and behaviour of West Indies players,? Dinanath Ramnarine, WIPA president, said in a statement published on Friday. 

The association is also filing a suit against Nowell for calling it ?a terrorist organisation,? he said. 

Nowell admitted writing the report but declined to comment. ?I know that it (the report) was passed on to the WICB for its perusal, and it rings of unprofessionalism that it should appear in a leading West Indies newspaper,? he said on Thursday. 

Selection of the West Indies team for the Australia tour was delayed last year over a contract dispute between the players? association and cricket officials, which was resolved by allowing individual players to hold endorsement deals with Digicel?s competition. 

In his report, Nowell said the personal contracts of leading players like Brian Lara were the root of the problem. 

This, ?combined with a terrorist players? association?, means ?our current rights have negligible value,? Nowell wrote. (AP)

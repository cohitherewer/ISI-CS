 Englands first Test from March 1

 - TOUR OF INDIA 

New Delhi: The itinerary for Englands tour of India early next year was finalised here on Thursday with the two cricket boards amicably ironing out the contentious issues. 

We have finalised the itinerary. Both the boards have amicably sorted out the programme, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told a press conference after a meeting of the marketing committee here. 

The first Test, to be held in Nagpur, will start from March 1. 

The earlier itinerary proposed by the previous regime in BCCI had evoked strong reaction from the English media and the ECB. 

Englands concern over playing warm-up matches in Agartala and Jamshedpur have been addressed in the new schedule which will see the visitors play the tour games at the CCI in Mumbai, Vadodara and Jaipur. 

The new itinerary eases the travelling schedule of England and also ensures that members of the Barmy Army can travel from one venue to another without hassle. 

The three Test matches will be played in Nagpur, Mohali and Mumbai, followed by seven one-day Internationals in Delhi, Faridabad, Goa, Kochi, Guwahati, Jamshedpur and Indore. 

Earlier, Mohali was scheduled to host the first Test, followed by matches in Ahmedabad and Mumbai. 

The tour will begin a week earlier than originally planned on February 13, following the decision to cancel the Asia Cup, which had been scheduled to be played in Pakistan in February.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 This is why I changed my game

St Andrews: British Open champion Tiger Woods says his decision to revamp his swing has made him a more formidable player and he is convinced even better years are ahead. 

After two surprise winners of the title, normal service was resumed at the Old Course on Sunday when world No.1 Woods cruised to a five-shot win over Briton Colin Montgomerie. 

That was pretty sweet, he told a news conference after finishing at 14 under par with a closing 70. Ive been criticised for years now. Why should I change my game? This is why. First, second and first in the last three majors, thats why. 

Woods claimed his fourth US Masters in April after a play-off and finished runner-up by two strokes to New Zealander Michael Campbell in the US Open. 

Thats why I bust my butt so hard at home ? to get to this point. 

Woods, who had gone two years without a major victory before his 2005 Masters triumph, gives much credit to coach Hank Haney who has helped him find new shots for his repertoire and also some which can be relied upon when the tension is at its highest. 

Woods said the turning point was a birdie on the 12th after Montgomerie, who at one stage was within one of his lead, had bogeyed the 11th and 13th. I much prefer to win this way. Its much less stressful. 

Woods is convinced he can only get better and scoffs at any suggestion he will become complacent. Its a never-ending struggle. Thats the fun of it, no matter how hard you play you can always play better which makes it exciting for the next day. 

Haney, his coach of 18 months, told reporters that Woods work-rate continued to amaze him.

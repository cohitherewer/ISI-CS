 Stockholm: Sweden?s world heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft will be out of action for around three weeks because of a thigh injury, the Swedish news agency TT reported on Sunday.

 Kluft, competing in Gothenburg at the annual weekend battle between Sweden and Finland, was unable to finish a hurdles race after suffering a minor bleed in the back of her left thigh.

 The 22-year-old Swede, who is also the Olympic champion, retained her world championship title in Helsinki earlier this month after overcoming an ankle injury. 

 New Haven: American James Blake won his first title in more than three years with a 3-6 7-5 6-1 victory over fifth-seeded Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in the New Haven Open final on Sunday.

 Blake, given a wild card into the event, looked in danger of defeat when he lost the first set but, after a rain delay of just under an hour, he was a transformed player as he stormed back to win the second title of his career. The 25-year-old American, whose ranking had fallen to 210 in April after 12 months blighted by injury and illness, is set to move back inside the world?s top 50.

 Toronto: Edoardo Molinari rallied from three down to become Italy?s first US Amateur golf champion with a 4 amp; 3 win over American Dillon Dougherty at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, on Sunday.

 The 24-year-old engineering student from Turin, who tied for 60th in last month?s British Open at St Andrews, sealed victory in the 36-hole final with a 30-foot birdie putt at the 33rd hole.

 Buenos Aires: River Plate coach Leonardo Astrada resigned in the dressing-room on Sunday after his side were thumped 1-4 by unfashionable Banfield.

 ?Astrada has decided to step aside,? River president Jose Maria Aguilar said immediately after the team had slipped out of the stadium without talking to the waiting media.

 Sydney: Injuries have forced captain Craig Moore and forward Harry Kewell out of Australia?s Oceania World Cup qualifiers with the Solomon Islands.

 Australian soccer officials said Moore had been ruled out with a hamstring problem and that Kewell was still suffering from a hernia injury. Michael Thwaite will replace Moore, while Alex Brosque comes in for Kewell.

 Australia host the Solomon Islands in Sydney on Saturday before a return leg in Honiara three days later. The winner will play-off against the fifth-placed South American team for a spot in the World Cup finals. 

 Beijing: The Beijing Olympics organisers will have a tough time deciding on the basic themes for ?compelling? opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 mega event with 395 proposals already on the table. The proposals had been received by July 31, the deadline for submitting ideas, the Beijing Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) said here in a statement.

 The schemes for the ceremonies would begin to take shape by the end of this year, BOCOG?s executive vice-president Jiang Xiaoyu has said.

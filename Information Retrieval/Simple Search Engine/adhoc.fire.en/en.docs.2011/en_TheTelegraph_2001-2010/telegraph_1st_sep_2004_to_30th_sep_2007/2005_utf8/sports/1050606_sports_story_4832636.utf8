Kingston: Brian Laras commanding, unbeaten 125 guided West Indies to a promising position after Corey Collymores seven-wicket haul limited Pakistan to 374 on Day II of the second Test here. 

West Indies lost captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the last over but Laras 30th Test century lifted it to 275 for four, trailing Pakistan by 99 runs on the first innings. 

The 36-year-old Lara cracked 16 fours and two sixes in a chanceless, four-hour knock that dominated the day at Sabina Park Saturday. 

His fourth century in five home Tests this summer lifted him to fourth on the all-time list, surpassing Don Bradman, and in the wake of only Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar, who have 34 each, and Steve Waugh, who retired with 32. 

Collymore grabbed seven for 78 as Pakistan, resuming on 336 for six, was dismissed for 374 after an hour, losing its last four wickets for 38 runs. Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal withstood a painful blow to his groin to hit 49 for the visitors. 

Lara arrived at the crease just after lunch when Abdul Razzaq reduced the West Indies to 59 for two despite a galloping start. Chris Gayle walloped six fours and a six in 33 off 22 balls before he snicked to Akmal just before the first break. 

Razzaq struck again immediately after the interval, ending Devon Smiths attractive 25 with a shooter that rolled into off stump. 

Lara and Ramnaresh Sarwan rebuilt the innings in the next two and-a-half hours with a partnership of 146 for the third wicket. 

Lara dazzled just before tea as he allowed himself to advertise some of his trademark attacking strokes. He blasted leg-spinner Danish Kaneria twice into the Red Stripe mound at long-on off consecutive balls. 

Soon afterward, his half-century arrived off 77 balls and he celebrated by smacking fast bowler Rana Naved-ul Hasan for three fours in a row. 

Sarwan contributed a solid 55 before he perished to the hook shot for the ninth time in Tests. Sarwan cracked eight fours but top-edged Shabbir Ahmed to fine leg when he seemed set for more at 205 for three.

 Paes and partner make last 8

London: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia and Montenegro came up with a clinical performance to advance to the mens doubles quarter finals at Wimbledon on Tuesday. 

The fifth seeds defeated Karol Beck (Slovakia) and Jaroslav Levinsky (Czech Republic) 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 to book a meeting with fourth seeds Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett. 

So dominant were Paes and Zimonjic, their opponents could not get a single break-point in the first two sets. 

Beck and Levinsky did manage to break the fifth seeds in the fourth game of the third set but Paes and Zimonjic struck back immediately by getting even in the very next game and broke again to go 4-3 up. 

The Indian juniors, however, had a bad day in office as both Sanam Singh and Vivek Shokeen bowed out of the boys singles in the second round. 

Asian junior champion Sanam went down to Antal van der Duim of The Netherlands 2-6, 3-6 while Shokeen lost to 17th seed Thiemo de Bakker 5-7, 6-4, 1-6. 

There was some cheer in boys doubles as Sanam teamed up with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan to beat Sho Aida of Japan and Jiri Kosler of Czech Republic 6-3, 6-4 to move into the second round.

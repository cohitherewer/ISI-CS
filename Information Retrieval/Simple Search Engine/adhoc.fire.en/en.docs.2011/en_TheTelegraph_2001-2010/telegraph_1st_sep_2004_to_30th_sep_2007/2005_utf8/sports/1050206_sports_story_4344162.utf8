 India could host a GP in 3-4 years: Karthikeyan

 - Ace Indian driver?s first test session at Silverstone on Wednesday 

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan feels the government 

must wake up to new vistas opening up for Indian motorsport and start working 

seriously towards hosting a Formula One event. 

Now that he had become the first Indian to get into the driver?s seat of a F1 car, Karthikeyan said that a Grand Prix event coming to India could become a reality but the government must strike when the iron is hot. 

?The deal (with Jordan) would definitely add more interest to the sport in India. It (a Grand Prix) could come in the next three-four years,? Karthikeyan said from Jordan?s office in Silverstone. 

?But the government must realise that this is a great business model and take it up seriously,? said the 28-year old Coimbatore-based driver. 

Tiego Monteiro of Portugal will be the other Jordan driver, with Trevor Carlin as team head. Monteiro, a rookie like Karthikeyan, has raced in F2 and been a test driver for Minardi. 

The team has scheduled three test sessions, with the first slated for Wednesday at Silverstone, the second in Barcelona the following week and the third again at Silverstone. 

The first of 19 races in the F1 calendar will be in Melbourne?s Albert Park on March 6. 

One of the reasons for Karthikeyan?s below-par showing in the Nissan Series was that he had problems in communicating with his engineers who were mostly Italians. That won?t be the case in the Jordan team. 

?A lot of people are new but there are some with whom I have worked before. It is a big advantage, having familiar faces definitely helps,? Karthikeyan said. 

?I have been keeping fit, doing my running everyday,? he said. But having spent the last two months running from pillar to post to clinch the deal, it is going to be that much difficult for Karthikeyan. 

He will also have to quickly adapt to the advanced technologies that will be vital to controlling the monster of a car that can achieve 340 kmph. 

All this is only half the challenge and the real one would come when he sits in the car. With 19 races at different venues, Karthikeyan will be racing on many unknown circuits. Shanghai and Bahrain were added to the calendar only last year. 

?Some races are going to be hard as they will be new. But some will be good. As I said, our realistic target is to get points. At this stage, we can?t expect to win,? the fastest Indian on wheels said. 

After years of tears and sweat, Narain will be suddenly realising his dreams -- racing against some of the greatest drivers he had idolised including seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. 

His mind must be racing at the thought of competing against some of the greatest drivers he had idolised, but he is not getting carried away. ?I like to concentrate on my job,? he said.

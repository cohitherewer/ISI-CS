 DFB sets up probe panel

 - Match-fixing in Germany 

 Thijs Waterink, who accepted money before a German Cup game 

Berlin: The German Football Association (DFB) set up a special commission on Monday to investigate possible match-fixing amid growing signs the country?s worst sporting scandal for 30 years may go deeper than first thought. 

The announcement followed an admission by regional side SC Paderborn that its captain took money from an unidentified man before a game at the centre of the scandal. 

Dutchman Thijs Waterink accepted 10,000 Euros shortly before Paderborn?s German Cup tie against Hamburg SV on the understanding he could keep the money if his side won. 

?I think this 10,000 Euros could be just the tip of the iceberg,? club president Wilfried Finke told a news conference.The first round match on August 21 was refereed by Robert Hoyzer who admitted last week that he had fixed matches. 

Late on Monday, German sports news agency SID quoted a player from second-division side Dynamo Dresden who also said he had accepted payment from an individual following a match. 

Goalkeeper Ignac Kresic told the agency he had taken 15,000 Euros after a regional league victory against Preussen Muenster in June 2003. ?It is correct that we got additional money for this victory from a third party,? he was quoted as saying. 

Germany is hosting the 2006 World Cup and Fifa, soccer?s world governing body, has urged the DFB to resolve the scandal as quickly as possible. 

The DFB said appeals had been launched against a total of nine matchesin the Northern regional league. It said the special commission would examine all information on the affair as it emerged. (Reuters)

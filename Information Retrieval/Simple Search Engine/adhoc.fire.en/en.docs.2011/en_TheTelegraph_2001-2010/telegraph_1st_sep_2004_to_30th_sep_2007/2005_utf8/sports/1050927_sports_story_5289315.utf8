 - We needed the Presidents Cup: DiMarco

Gainesville (Virginia): They had squeezed the last light from the day and absorbed every counter-punch thrown before the two teams sat around the 18th green of Robert Trent Jones Golf Club and observed a private conversation between a golfer and his caddie. 

Chris DiMarco, his ball 15 feet from the hole, listened to one final word from his caddie, Pat Bryan, as they studied the route that would give the US team a victory in the Presidents Cup or perhaps extend golf at dusk. 

This is a moment youve been waiting for your whole life, Bryan said, then he left DiMarco to settle a tie that was two years old. 

When DiMarco struck the putt, it rolled for four seconds and fell into the hole for a birdie, lifting the US team to an 18 1/2-15 1/2 victory Sunday over an International team that pushed the Americans to the edge of night. 

As the players rushed onto the green to celebrate with DiMarco, Jack Nicklaus, the US captain, fell in slowly behind them, his eyes misty and his arms seeking hugs. Nicklaus found DiMarco and put his hands on each shoulder. 

David Toms and Tiger Woods followed, storming in from each side and creating a human sandwich of hugs and high-fives. 

We needed that Cup, DiMarco said, his hair flying in all directions, his week filled with a hole in one, an eagle and the putt of his life. When the putt was 4 feet from the hole, DiMarco said, I knew it couldnt miss. 

The US have won four of six Presidents Cups and have never lost when the competition has been contested on American soil. Two years ago, the International team played the United States to a 17-17 tie as night fell on South Africas Western Cape Province. 

The rematch was undecided until DiMarcos putt defeated Stuart Appleby, 1 up, for the 18th point. The matches had started with the score tied at 11-11. 

All day Sunday, the Presidents Cup had been building toward a climax, with Fred Couples upsetting Vijai Singh, 1 up, by sinking a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th green for the United States 16th point. 

Nicklaus provided some motivation, because of his station as golfs greatest champion, and most recently, as a man who had lost his 17-month-old grandson, Jake, in a drowning accident. 

Nicklaus said he and his wife, Barbara, cried when the players presented the couple with a large portrait of Jake before the matches. Several players cried, too, Nicklaus said. Many of the players have kids, he said. What we have with our team and what we have with our families is more important than any scoreboard.

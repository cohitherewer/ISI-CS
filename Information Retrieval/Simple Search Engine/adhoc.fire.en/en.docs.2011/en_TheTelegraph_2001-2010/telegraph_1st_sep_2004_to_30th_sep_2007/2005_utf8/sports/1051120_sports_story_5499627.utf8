Miyazaki: Defending champion Tiger Woods pulled ahead of second-round leader Jim Furyk with three birdies over the back nine to take a one-shot lead after the third round of the $1.7-million Dunlop Phoenix golf tournament on Saturday. 

Woods, playing in a threesome with fellow Americans Furyk and David Duval, fired a two-under-par 68 for a three-round total of 200 over the par-70 Phoenix Country Club course. 

Overnight leader Furyk stretched his lead to two strokes with a birdie on the first hole but struggled for consistency after that over the tree-lined course. 

Additional birdies at the ninth and 18th holes were offset by three bogeys and he ended up even par on the day for a 201 total. 

Duval, the 2001 Dunlop Phoenix champion who was tied with Woods for second at the beginning of the round, had two great recoveries on five and 16 to get a one-over 71 for a 203 total to keep himself in contention. (Reuters)

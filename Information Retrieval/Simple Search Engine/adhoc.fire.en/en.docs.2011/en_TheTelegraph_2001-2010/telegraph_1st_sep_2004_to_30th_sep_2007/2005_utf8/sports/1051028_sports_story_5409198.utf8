New Delhi: Sri Lankas caddie turned pro Anura Rohana stole the show on the opening day with an eight under 64 to move into sole lead at the Hero Honda Indian Open Golf Championship here on Thursday. 

The 32-year old Rohana, who turned pro only three years ago, was in sizzling form as he made seven birdies and an eagle on his way to a one stroke lead in the $300,000 Asian Tour event at the Delhi Golf Club course here. 

Australias Craig Warren was second with a card of 65 followed by Hendrick Buhrmann and Digvijay Singh in joint third at six-under. 

Gaurav Ghei and Rahul Ganapathy were among a bunch of four at fifth, three strokes behind the leader. 

Home favourite Arjun Atwal overcame a rusty start when he fired a double bogey on the third hole to return a satisfying card of two-under while his compatriot Jyoti Randhawa was a bit better with three-under. 

Asian Tour money leader Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand was not far behind with a four-under 68, but defending champion Mardan Mamat of Singapore had an ordinary day with three birdies and two bogies for a 71. 

A double bogey on the fourth hole spoiled an otherwise good card for Shiv Kapur who was two-under 70. 

Rohana, father of two, was thoroughly enjoying his day of glory. It is the first time he is leading on the Asian Tour where he has played seven events and missed the cut twice. 

I was really hitting good, had two days of practising going into the event. I like the greens here. Digviay (Singh) asked me is this your home course, grinned the Sri Lankan. 

Starting on the back nine, Rohana had three successive birdies on the 13th, 14th, and 15th holes. He had another on the 17th, which could have easily been an eagle with the putt only 2-1/2 feet. 

After two more on the 18th and first, Rohana had a bogey on the third where a six-iron on the approach shot found the left bush. 

But he made up for that with an eagle on the eighth where he found the pin 20 yards from the left bunker. 

Randhawa, who had missed the cut last week at the Bridgestone Open, said he had changed his swing but was satisfied with the performance. 

I am feeling good, happy with the game. I didnt play well last month but I am fine now, said the 2000 edition champion. 

Starting on the 10th tee, Randhawa birdied on the 14th, 15th and 17th but closed the front nine with a bogie on the 18th. 

Another bogie followed on the third hole but he made up with two more birdies on the sixth and eighth. 

Atwal opened with a birdie. He used a two-iron on the third but a bad swing landed him in the left bush. Bogey was inevitable on par four hole. 

After struggling for rhythm, Atwal turned it around on the back nine where he made successive birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th. 

I was little off rhythm, on the front nine especially. On a course like this it is tight anyway. Coming back from a month long break, there was little bit of jitters, Atwal said.

 - Former chief selector not in favour of different captains for Tests and ODIs

Pune: All hope is not lost for Sourav Ganguly and he may still feature in Greg Chappells plans for the 2007 World Cup. So says former national selection committee chairman Chandu Borde. 

Sourav has been unfortunate... Hes had the injuries at the wrong time. But weve to remember that he is a great batsman and can make a comeback any time. All will depend on his fitness, the former India captain told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

Borde, who was chief selector when Sourav was named Team India captain in early 2000, added: The situation is such that the onus is on building a new side. If the juniors fail to deliver, then it will be difficult to ignore Sourav. At the moment, though, the juniors should be given a fair deal. 

Borde, who is based in Pune, has been pleasantly surprised by Team Indias performance in the recent series against Sri Lanka. Its been a tremendous show. Sachin Tendulkars presence has had a very positive effect on the team. The way he batted in Nagpur in the opening match set the ball rolling. 

The confidence that was missing for some time has suddenly come back. It is here to stay. The players, especially the juniors, were inspired by Sachins performance and started playing more freely. 

It will be very tough for Sri Lanka to bounce back. The team looks so demoralised. Their bowling is in a shambles, Borde explained. 

Chappells presence has also had a positive impact. The way he is moulding this team has been superb. The tactical moves to promote Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni have paid dividends. Chappell is shrewd and knowledgeable. At the same time, he is ruthless in approach with a lot of determination. He is trying to imbibe these qualities in the side, explained Borde. 

Would he have insisted on picking Sourav had he been in the selection committee? The present situation is such that it would have been difficult for me to convince others, he remarked. 

Borde is cautious when asked if he was in favour of retaining Sourav as captain for the Test side. Its a tricky situation. The one-dayers against Sri Lanka will be followed by the series against South Africa. We have to see the performance and then decide on the Test side. But personally, Im not in favour of different captains for Tests and one-dayers. If one person is good for one job, he should be equally good for the other as well. 

We also have to remember that India won the last Test series against Zimbabwe under Sourav. He also got a century in that away series. Records speak for Sourav and the selectors will have to deal with the situation very delicately, Borde said. 

He, however, did not wish to make any comment on the Chappell-Sourav spat. I wasnt there and am not aware of what transpired between them, he said. 

Is he happy with Rahul Dravids captaincy? Rahul is a seasoned player and has done really well. It is not always easy to get the best out of the juniors. He has been aggressive and has handled his resources well. But well have to wait and see... 

The final word was on Dhoni. He is a bundle of extraordinary talent. I believe he will handle success well.

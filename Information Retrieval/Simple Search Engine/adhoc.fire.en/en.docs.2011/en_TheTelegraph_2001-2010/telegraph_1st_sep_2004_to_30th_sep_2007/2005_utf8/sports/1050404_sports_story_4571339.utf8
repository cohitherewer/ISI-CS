The Telegraph - Calcutta

Owen can expect Eriksson?s support

 Guest Column 

Gary Lineker

As Alan Shearer announced that he will be playing 

on for Newcastle next season, he doubtless allowed himself a wry smile at the 

criticism aimed at his friend Michael Owen for failing to score for England against 

Azerbaijan. Shearer knows as well as anybody that strikers live and die by their 

goals and that whenever you fail to deliver for your country, there are inevitably 

calls for your head.

Before Euro 96, when Shearer was going through a bad 

patch, almost the entire media were calling for him to be dropped in favour of 

Andy Cole. Fortunately, England manager Terry Venables did not listen and 23 minutes 

into the tournament, Shearer had scored the opening goal against Switzerland.

Owen knows that he can expect similar support because 

one of Sven-Goran Eriksson?s greatest strengths as a manager, like Venables, is 

his loyalty to his better players.

It would be easy for him to say, OK let?s try Jermain 

Defoe instead of Owen and Shaun Wright-Phillips instead of David Beckham but good 

managers ignore fashion, which is transitory, and stay true to their principles 

until a player shows an obvious decline and has to be replaced. Owen is far from 

that stage, even if he did have one of those nights against Azerbaijan. 

I had a similar experience against the Republic of 

Ireland in the 1988 European Championship, when I wouldn?t have scored if I had 

stayed out on the pitch for a month. But because I knew I could finish, I didn?t 

let it fester and I?m sure Michael won?t. 

After that Ireland game, I didn?t sleep a wink and 

kept going through every chance that I had missed. But two or three days later, 

it was forgotten and when Michael Owen?s career is over, he won?t even remember 

Wednesday night?s game.

What is staggering to me is the realisation that Michael 

is only 25, the age that I made my England debut. That shows how much he has achieved 

so early and clearly, he is going to overtake Shearer in the England scoring charts 

and probably current leader Bobby Charlton. And he?ll hold the new record just 

as long as it takes Wayne Rooney to go past him!

I was chatting with Alan Shearer after the Azerbaijan 

game and he was saying that, when you set high standards over a long period of 

time, as he and Michael have done, people are quick to write you off when you 

dip slightly below them for a couple of games. If, for instance, Defoe were to 

come in and failed to score for a game or two, people would simply accept that 

he needed time to settle in. But with Michael, they?re quick to say that he is 

not what he was and, though he has had his share of injuries, being fresh from 

not playing a lot this season may ultimately benefit England.

 Neelams dope case lingers

New Delhi: The delay in the hearing of the dope case involving discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh seems unending with the athletes counsel claiming that he had sent all relevant documents but the panel says it has not received them. 

I have sent everything that I had to from my side and it is now up to the panel to arrive at a conclusion, said Sushil Salwan, Neelams counsel in the hearing, on Saturday. 

The four-man panel, is scheduled to meet again once it receives the documents to finalise their decision.

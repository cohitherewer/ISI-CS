Bangkok: Five days after joining hands to clinch a victory for India in Davis Cup, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi squared up against each other at the Thailand Open. And the honours went to the senior pro after a thrilling contest at the $550,000 ATP event. 

Paes and Australian Paul Hanley, the top seeds, got the better of Bhupathi and American partner Justin Gimelstob 6-4, 6-5 (7-5) to enter the final. Both are with irregular partners this week. 

Paes and Bhupathi have now crossed swords 10 times, and its evens stevens. In their only previous duel this year, Bhupathi (Todd Woodbridge) had triumphed over Paes (and Nenad Zimonjic) in Sydney. With Paes getting injured during a rally, he and Zimonjic had to concede the quarter final match after just four games. 

Paes has won two titles this year for a tally of 33, while Bhupathi has 37, including the Sydney crown with Woodbridge in January. 

In singles action, Andy Murrays meteoric rise continued when he ousted home favourite Paradorn Srichaphan to book a meeting with world No. 1 Roger Federer in the title round. 

The 18-year-old Briton, who broke into the worlds top 100 earlier this week after starting the year ranked 411, won 6-7, 7-5, 6-2 to reach his first ATP final. 

Top seed Federer stayed on track for his 11th title of the season by beating Finlands Jarkko Nieminen 6-3, 6-4 in the first of Saturdays semis. 

It was Federers 30th consecutive victory, moving him into a tie with Jimmy Connors for the ninth longest match-winning streak in the Open Era. 

With 76 wins this year and just three defeats, the Swiss world supremo is close to surpassing his personal best record of 78 wins in a season, set in 2003. 

Murray has often been criticised for his lack of conditioning but this time it was Srichaphan who faded and he received a leg massage for cramp when down 3-2 in the final set. 

The Scot, who has beaten three seeds this week, smelt blood and broke in the next game with a forehand volley as the seventh-seeded Thai struggled to move in the rallies. 

Murray held serve easily to lead 5-2 and closed out the match with a brilliantly executed double-handed backhand winner down the line. 

Srichaphan was encouraged by a noisy crowd of 8,400 who were urged on by two eccentric male cheerleaders dressed in ancient Thai costume, one with a pantomime horse. It was good for me to see that he was getting tired. It showed I was making him do more running today. 

Federer produced another supremely polished performance, after he had banished a few forehand errors early in the match.

 Fifa to decide on top seeds after Dec. 6

[+uc('Oliver Kay

It was entirely in keeping with its reputation for whimsy that Fifa, the world governing body, admitted on Monday that it would not decide on a system to work out who would be the top seeds for the World Cup finals until a meeting of its executive committee on December 6, only three days before the draw takes place in Leipzig. 

In previous years, such a revelation might have been seen to offer encouragement to England, given that Fifa has been accused of shifting the goalposts to accommodate the more powerful nations, but the FA would be unwise to take their place among the top seeds for granted. 

Fifas moves towards greater transparency point to the retention of the complicated formulae used before the draw for the 2002 World Cup finals, which, if applied to the likely qualifiers for next summers tournament, would leave England sweating on their place among the top seeds. Brazil are a given, along with Germany, the hosts, Argentina and Italy, but then it becomes unclear. 

If, as Fifa indicates, the criteria used are similar to those applied for the 2002 finals ? taking into account the controversial world ranking system and performances in the three previous tournaments ? Spain, if they qualify, and Mexico will have an irresistible mathematical case to be among the top seeds, leaving England, France, Holland and the US to fight out the two remaining and coveted places in Pot A. 

The formula is complicated and difficult to assess, with several qualification issues to be resolved, but Englands position is far from secure. 

England can try to secure top-seed status by winning their next two matches, against Poland on Wednesday and Argentina in a friendly in Switzerland on November 12. Those matches might appear to be academic, but beating Poland and Argentina, ranked seventeenth and third in the world, would help to make up some of the points lost as England dropped four places. 

A Fifa spokesman said: The Fifa rankings published in November will take into account the results of those matches and the more recent results carry more weight. At the moment there is no guarantee what system will be used. I would expect that the system would not vary much from the one used in 2002.

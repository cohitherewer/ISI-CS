New Delhi: World No. 5 Anju Bobby George kept Indias hopes for another World Championship medal alive when she came up with her best jump of the season in the very first attempt to book a place in Wednesdays long jump final at Helsinki. 

The 28-year-old Anju, 2003 bronze medallist, produced her best of 6.54m in the first attempt on Tuesday. However, her second and third jumps measured only 6.38m and 6.47m, respectively. 

She eventually made the grade as one of the 10 competitors who failed to make the automatic qualification mark of 6.65m. 

Tianna Madison of US, with a first leap of 6.83m, and Concepcion Montaner of Spain (6.65m), also on the first try, were the only two to make the automatic qualification mark in the absence of one of the favourites, Russian Irina Simagina, who did not start at the Olympic Stadium. 

In third place after the first round, Anju slipped to fourth after the second and finally sixth after the third and last round. However, it was a tough outing for her rivals, including Olympic silver medallist Tatyana Kotava and world champion Eunice Barber, who also failed to get past the qualifying mark. 

Besides Montaner and Kotova, Cubas Yargelis Savigne, Britains Kelly Sotherton and Jamaican Elva Goulbourne qualified from group A. Anju qualified from group B, along with six others.

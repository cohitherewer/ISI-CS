 Sore ankle no problem, says Sania

Hyderabad: The sore ankle may be a cause of concern for Indian sport?s new pin-up girl but Sania Mirza is determined to showcase her skills in front of home fans at the Hyderabad Open beginning next week. 

The 18-year-old said she was playing in the WTA Tour event, not out of any ?obligation? but because it was her home event. 

?Nobody has forced me to play the Hyderabad Open. I want to play because it is my home event and I want to play in front of home fans,? Sania said. 

Sania, who became the first Indian woman to reach a Grand Slam third round at the Australian Open, said ?the feeling had sunk in long ago? and she was back to the grind. 

The 18-year old has been practising and working at the gym to get back to peak form ahead of the $140,000 prize money WTA Tour event starting next Monday. 

Sania said the left ankle, which was injured two weeks before the Australian Open, would not hamper her performance in the tier 4 event.

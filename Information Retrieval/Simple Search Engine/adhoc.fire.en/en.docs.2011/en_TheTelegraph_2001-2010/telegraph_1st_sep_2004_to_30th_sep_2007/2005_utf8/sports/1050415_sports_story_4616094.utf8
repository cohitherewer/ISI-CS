 Paris: Three-time World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane crushed rumours about his possible return to the France team by saying he would definitely not be coming out of international retirement. ?I have made a decision and I will not reconsider it, full stop,? the Real Madrid playmaker said in a brief statement on his website.

 The 32-year-old midfielder ended his international career after they were knocked out of Euro 2004 in August last year. A French sports daily quoted him earlier this month as saying he might change his mind.

 Rio de Janeiro: Players at Brazil?s richest club have appealed for their wages to be kept secret following a bout of kidnappings involving footballers? relatives.

 ?We ask for the understanding of the media in helping reduce a problem which affects all of society and, recently, footballers and their families,? said the players in a statement on Wednesday.

 The mothers of four leading Brazilian players, all in Sao Paulo, have been kidnapped since November.

 London: Chelsea?s Frank Lampard, John Terry and Petr Cech have been nominated for the Professional Footballers? Association (PFA) player of the year award, the PFA website said on Thursday.

 Midfielder Lampard, defender Terry and goalkeeper Cech have helped Chelsea to the brink of their first Premier League title for 50 years and the Champions League semis.

 Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard, Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson and Arsenal forward Thierry Henry are the other candidates. 

 Glasgow: Welsh international striker John Hartson hit a hattrick to take Celtic back to the top of the Scottish Premier League after a 4-0 win at bottom club Livingston.

 Hartson scored three minutes before the break with a volley, then headed the second after 75 minutes before adding his first penalty of the season with four minutes left. Stanislav Varga added the fourth in the final seconds.

 The result took Celtic to 80 points from 32 games, two clear of Rangers.

 London: Ireland?s former world 5,000m champion Sonia O?Sullivan plans to represent Australia at next year?s Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. O?Sullivan, 35, who has two daughters by her Australian partner Nic Bideau, will decide which event she would like to run after Sunday?s London marathon. ?I?m planning to improve my visa situation in Australia,? O?Sullivan told a news conference on Thursday. ?Currently I?m just a visitor.?

 O?Sullivan said she would still be able to compete at other major championships for Ireland. The Commonwealth Games do not come under the jurisdiction of the IAAF.

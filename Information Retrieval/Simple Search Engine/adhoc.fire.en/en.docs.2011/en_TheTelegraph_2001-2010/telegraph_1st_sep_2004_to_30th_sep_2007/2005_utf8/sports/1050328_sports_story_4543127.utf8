Calcutta: Amal Dutta served old wine in a new bottle, and the ?new packaging? was good enough for Mohun Bagan to hold Dempo SC goalless in their 14th round match of the ONGC Cup National Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

The crucial point ? which led the former champions to the 16-point tally ? was a ?much-needed morale-booster? for the beleaguered team, felt the veteran coach. 

But all this could have taken a backseat had Ranty Martins? head injury been a d?j? vu situation. Martins returned to action after a period of senselessness, following a fall off an aerial challenge with Bagan?s Nigerian defender Ajibade Olaniran Babalade. The leading Dempo striker remained unconscious for about a minute but returned to the field after medical assistance. 

Like Babalade and Eduardo Coelho, their goalkeeper Subrata Pal, who played his first match against Dempo since the Federation Cup final, must also have kept his fingers crossed. After all, the Cristiano Junior tragedy is just five-month old. 

The way the green-maroon brigade held the title-contenders from Goa (who, after Sunday?s match, provisionally moved to the top with 28 points) marked a significant departure from their posture under the previous coach, Subrata Bhattacharya. On Sunday, Coelho amp; Co. looked more positive and bent on probing and prodding the rivals till the last dregs ? so conspicuously absent in earlier rounds. 

This was, of course, no spell of a magic wand from Dutta. But certainly a degree of self-belief, a desperation to rise and shut as many windows of criticism as possible. ?It was just a beginning, but the road ahead is quite treacherous,? admitted Dutta after the match and rightly so. 

Because Mohun Bagan could have lost the match had Martins and R.C Prakash not missed sitters in each half. But the positive thing about this Mohun Bagan is that they could have won the match too. In the 20th minute, Man-of-the-Match Roberto Mendes Silva Beto headed straight at the goalkeeper Satish Kumar from an unchallenged position. So did Tomba Singh soon after the second half and the Brazilian?s header off a Dharamjit Singh floater from left, in the 68th minute, lacked pace to beat the Dempo goalkeeper. 

This is a tale of Mohun Bagan, not quite often told under Bhattacharya. This is a new package of Mohun Bagan, not quite seen under Bhattacharya ? Babalade manning the defence for 90 minutes, Jo Paul Ancheri beating age to control the vital link between defence and midfield and the rearguard successfully frustrating the Martins and Prakashs. 

There were some loopholes, true. Like Babalade?s awful miss-pass in the 64th minute. Martins claimed it inside the box, steered clear of an onrushing goalkeeper and Manas Das (an easy target for the rival attackers), but lost vital time in assuring himself of cent per cent safe position for his shot. Babalade regrouped himself in the meantime and finally cleared the ball for a corner. 

All said and done, Mohun Bagan deserved a point and they earned it through fighting.

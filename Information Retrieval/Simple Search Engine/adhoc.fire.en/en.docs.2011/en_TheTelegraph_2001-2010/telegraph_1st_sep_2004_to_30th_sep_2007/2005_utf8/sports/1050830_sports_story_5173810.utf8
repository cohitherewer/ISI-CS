The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhupathi-Damm turns to Fazal

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Syed Fazaluddin 

Calcutta: Guess whos coaching Mahesh Bhupathi and his Czech partner Martin Damm at the US Open? This is a tough one, so take a clue: hes a Calcuttan. 

Not many will still get it right. Okay, here goes, its Syed Fazaluddin ? brought up on the South Club courts, a Davis Cupper for four years, now settled in the US. 

Quite a climbdown for Bhupathi, considering the fact that his previous coach was Mark Woodforde not many months ago. It was in May when Bhupathi and his then-partner Todd Woodbridge hired legendary doubles exponent Woodforde. 

That association lasted less than two months as Woodbridge suddenly quit the game after their failure at Wimbledon. Martin and I were looking for a coach? I suggested Fazals name, Bhupathi told The Telegraph from New York. He (Fazal) has been a Davis Cupper and has the experience of coaching in the US, so we agreed to join hands. 

Fazaluddin, the elder son of Dronacharya Syed Nayeemuddin, is excited about his most precious coaching assignment, but refuses to go overboard. I have always been a thinker on court and have backed myself as coach? in fact, Mahesh had talked of working with me after I quit the game but I didnt agree then, said Fazaluddin. 

His association with Bhupathi and Damm began earlier this month at the Montreal Masters and is three meets old, going into the years last Grand Slam. The results havent been very encouraging so far, Bhupathi and Damms best being a semi-final appearance in five meets together. 

They have run into the top teams and played some very close matches? now their performances have to be translated into wins. The encouraging aspect is, the trend is strongly upwards, so hopefully things will turn around soon, said Fazaluddin. 

As of now, Fazaluddin will be with Bhupathi and Damm till the end of the US Open. Were still talking about the future, lets see whether something can be worked out for the long run, said the 30-year-old who made his Davis Cup debut in 1998. 

Bhupathi has always been in favour of a doubles team working with a coach. Enrico Piperno travelled with him for five years. A coach brings a lot into our game? besides working with us on the court and in the gym, he brings some fresh ideas which a player may miss out, Bhupathi observed. 

Just the other day, Fazaluddin had said he was looking for a Wall Street job after completing his degree in international business. That idea may have to be put on the back-burner for the time being.

 London: Swimming?s world governing body FINA, which stripped July?s world championships from Montreal because of financial concerns, decided on Thursday to give the championships back to the Canadian city.

 The decision was made after an extraordinary meeting of FINA in Frankfurt, the organisation said in a statement. FINA stripped the championships from Montreal in January after reported funding shortfalls of $8 million and reopened the bidding for the event. Athens, Berlin and Moscow were invited to give presentations on Wednesday.

 Montreal?s organising committee chief, Yvon DesRochers, was found dead of gunshot wounds in his car last week, the victim of an apparent suicide.

 London: Queen Elizabeth II will host the International Olympic Committee delegation during next week?s inspection visit of London?s 2012 Olympic bid.

 The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, will host a dinner on February 18. Princess Anne, an IOC member, will also be present, Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Wednesday.

 The dinner will be an opportunity for the queen to show her support for London?s bid after last month?s widespread publication of reported remarks she made favouring Paris? bid. 

 London: Transsexual golfers will be allowed to play in this year?s women?s British Open. The policy change was announced on Wednesday by the Ladies Golf Union (LGU), which governs amateur golf in Britain and also runs the women?s British Open. The tournament is open to amateurs and professionals.

 The LGU move follows a similar policy shift last year by the Ladies European Tour, the governing body of professional women?s golf in Europe.

 The LGU change comes 11 months after Danish-born Mianne Bagger became the first male-born golfer to play in a professional women?s tournament. Bagger had a sex-change operation in 1995.

 London: Michael Schumacher?s former Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine has criticised the champion?s younger brother Ralf, saying he has to deliver for Toyota this season.

 ?This could be the end for Ralf Schumacher,? said the Northern Irishman, assessing the Formula One season?s prospects in a magazine on Thursday. ?The guy has had so many chances. He seemed to have a lot of potential, but he doesn?t have the drive of his brother. He?s less talented and he doesn?t have the killer instinct that Michael has.

 ?He?s won races, but who can?t win in a Williams, at the front, with the best tyres?,? added Irvine. ?Sometimes I used to drive the Jaguar round thinking I was a legend. Those races that I was going so well in, Ralf won, because of the tyres. It was nothing else.?

 Ralf left Williams at the end of last season after six years with the team. He last won a race in France in 2003. 

 Chandigarh: Gursewak Singh, a former senior official of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) died at his residence in Mohali early on Thursday. Singh, who leaves behind wife and a son, was 82. He was a former secretary, treasurer and vice president of the IHF and presently an advisor of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).

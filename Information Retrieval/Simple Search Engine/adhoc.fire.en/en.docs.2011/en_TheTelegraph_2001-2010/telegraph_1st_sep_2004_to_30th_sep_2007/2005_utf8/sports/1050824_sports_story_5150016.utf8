 Terry the bridge for any divide at Chelsea

 - Captain meets Mourinho to discuss players grievances

 Terrys relationship with coach Mourinho will be crucial for Chelseas success this season 

Jose Mourinhos deft touch in juggling his expensive stars and suppressing any latent disharmony last season was one of Chelseas most impressive qualities. There has been a good deal of common sense underpinning the managers approach to selecting his players, but it has taken the intervention of John Terry to prevent the first discontent to have emerged since Mourinhos arrival at Stamford Bridge last year from turning into a disruptive burden. 

The Chelsea captain intimated on Monday that he had spoken to Mourinho on behalf of the players who had felt aggrieved at not being picked. Mourinho has always emphasised the team rather than the player and even the Portuguese manager was surprised at the public outburst by Ricardo Carvalho, the defender, last week. 

The pair first clashed at FC Porto when Mourinho took over as coach and for the first three months left Carvalho out of the team. The suggestion in Portugal is that Carvalho was not top of Mourinhos list when he signed the player last summer and that if a suitable offer came, he would be sold. 

The manager has always said in meetings, if anybody has anything to say to me, whether it is bad or good, get up and say it, Terry said. Clear things now rather than coming in on Saturday when players have things on their chest. That was the key last year when a couple of things happened. 

In what may prove to be a recurring theme to Chelseas season leading up to next years World Cup finals in Germany, it seems inevitable that Terrys close relationship with Mourinho will be central to dampening down similar confrontations. 

The squad has been bolstered by ? 55-million of talent this summer, and although Shaun Wright-Phillips will not expect to be in the Chelsea starting line-up, there is uncompromising competition in midfield. Bubbling under the surface, William Gallas is believed to have been concerned that he would not be the regular centre back and Arjen Robben, the winger, has challenged the squad rotation system. 

I speak to the players to ask what is wrong, Terry said. But a lot of the time the lads would come to me and say: What is the manager thinking? Just that little bit of communication between us all, to get things out in the open, I think it is good. Once the air is cleared, it can only be good for the team. 

If players are not being picked, and they are happy about that, then we have a problem. We have good problems at Chelsea, the players want to play. Obviously they are going to be very frustrated at not playing, but there is a way to handle it. Everyone knows the situation at the club. If you are not playing one week, you could easily be playing the next. 

It is probably easy for Terry, who was speaking at the launch of his autobiography, My Winning Season, to hypothesise when there is little danger of him losing his starting place. Terry used the example of Joe Cole, who kept quiet when unhappy at not being selected last season, stepping in with confidence when Chelsea were short of attacking midfield players and reinventing himself as a disciplined team man. 

Unfortunately, though, the premise breaks down with Scott Parker, the midfield player who never spoke out, but still found his avenues to the first team blocked. And Cole was left out of the squad for the victory over Arsenal on Sunday. 

He took it on the chin, Terry said. He listened to what the manager had said to him. If the manager was opinionated about something and he said you need to defend more and forget the attacking side, play first for the team - that is what Coley did. 

He had a look at himself and improved as a player. He looked fit and sharper and stayed in the side for the rest of the season. Now he has got an England place as well. Players have to have that drive in themselves to keep working hard, Terry said.

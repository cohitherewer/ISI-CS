 Last rites by Hoggard 

 Hoggard was named Man of the Match 

Chester-le-Street: Matthew Hoggard took five wickets for 73 as England wrapped up an innings-and-27-run win over Bangladesh in the second and final Test Sunday to win the series 2-0. 

The touring side had looked in danger of becoming only the fifth side to lose a Test in two days since World War II but clung on to close Saturday on 297 for eight, still needing 46 to make the home side bat again. 

They lasted only 26 more balls on Sunday, however. Hoggard, who had taken three wickets for two runs late Saturday, removed Tapash Baisya in the fourth over of a drab morning as the tailender edged behind. 

Mashrafe Mortaza followed in similar fashion five balls later, Marcus Trescothick holding the catch at first slip at the second attempt, as Bangladesh were bowled out for 316. 

Aftab Ahmed, the last recognised batsman, was left stranded on a run-a-ball 82 not out, hitting one six and 13 fours. Hoggard, with eight wickets for 79 overall, was Man of the Match. 

The teams next play in a one-day triangular series.

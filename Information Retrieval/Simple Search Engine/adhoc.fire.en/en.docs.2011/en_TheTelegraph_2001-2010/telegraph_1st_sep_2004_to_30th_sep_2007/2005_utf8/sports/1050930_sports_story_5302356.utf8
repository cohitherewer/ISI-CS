 Rusty Real ride Raul record

London: Striker Raul became the first player to score 50 goals in Champions League history when he led Real Madrid to a 2-1 win over Olympiakos Piraeus in their Champions League Group F match on Wednesday. 

Artmedia Bratislava scored their first-ever goal in the competition proper and staged an astonishing comeback to send 2004 European champions Porto crashing to a 3-2 home defeat after the Portuguese had been 2-0 ahead after 39 minutes. 

Real Betis also earned their first-ever Champions League win with a 1-0 triumph at Anderlecht in Brussels, handing the Belgians their ninth successive Champions League defeat. 

Holders Liverpool, however, failed to score in a dull 0-0 draw with English champions Chelsea. 

On the night when Raul re-wrote the scoring record books, Clarence Seedorf added a footnote to the scorers list with the third fastest goal in Champions League history. Seedorf, playing in his 100th European club match, scored after 21 seconds of AC Milans Group E match at Schalke 04, but the Italians had to settle for a 2-2 draw. 

In the same group, Fenerbahce struck form to beat PSV Eindhoven 3-0 on a disappointing night for the Dutch who had Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink sent off. Brazilian Alex de Sousa scored twice for the Turkish side. 

Inter Milan beat Rangers 1-0 in a deserted San Siro stadium in their Group H match where the fans were banned as part of Uefas punishment. Lyon, who beat Real Madrid 3-0 two weeks ago, maintained their perfect start in Group F with a 1-0 win at Rosenborg Trondheim after Brazilian defender Cris scored the only goal in injury time at the end of the first half. 

Real seemed headed for an easy win after skipper Raul headed home a beautifully flighted cross from David Beckham in the ninth minute to beat the record of 49 goals established by their former striker Alfredo Di Stefano in 1964. 

Instead of his historic goal inspiring Real to dominate Wednesdays match against the Greeks, the away side levelled through midfielder Pentilis Kafes three minutes after the break. 

Substitute Soldado came to Reals rescue when he got on the end of a another great Beckham cross after 86 minutes. 

While Raul was making history, Artmedia Bratislava proved fairytales can still come true in football as they demolished Porto after trailing 0-2 to the vastly more experienced side. Artmedia pulled a goal back through Peter Petras in first-half injury time and stunned the 40,000 at the Dragao stadium when his fellow midfielder Jan Kozak equalised from a 54th-minute counter attack and defender Balasz Borbely grabbed the winner with 16 minutes to go. 

Betis, making their debut this season, also won their first match with victory over Anderlecht in Group G thanks to a 69th minute goal from Ricardo Oliveira against the run of play.

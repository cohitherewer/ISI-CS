 Harbhajan has faith in BCCI

Jalandhar: Harbhajan Singh, whose bowling action came under the scanner for the second time in four months during the recent Indo-Pak Test series, said he had full faith that the BCCI would take up the issue with ICC to resolve it once and for all. 

?BCCI has already written a letter to the ICC raising objection on my undergoing one more test to clear myself from the allegations, as a similar kind of test has already been conducted on me in Australia,? Harbhajan said Friday. 

The off-spinner was reported for a suspect bowling action for his doosra. 

Regarding the six-ODI ban on captain Sourav Ganguly for India?s slow-over rate against Pakistan in the Ahmedabad ODI, Harbhajan said it was an ?injustice? to him since the captain was not alone responsible for it. 

Asked whether the low performance of Sourav was due to the criticism on his batting, he replied in the negative. 

?A player never comes under pressure due to anybody?s comments. On TV channels, people are paid to say something and they have to say to increase the viewership.

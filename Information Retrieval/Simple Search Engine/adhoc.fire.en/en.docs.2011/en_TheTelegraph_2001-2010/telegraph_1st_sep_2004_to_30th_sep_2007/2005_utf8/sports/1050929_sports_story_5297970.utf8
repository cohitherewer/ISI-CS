 Boards peace formula welcomed

 - The Sourav-Greg feud and its settlement 

 Dilip Vengsarkar 

New Delhi: The compromise brokered by the BCCI between captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Greg Chappell was by and large welcomed by the cricketing fraternity. Following is the reaction of two former captains, a former coach and a former Board president. 

 Chandu Borde: The outcome was expected because accusations have no point without something concrete to support them. In the interest of the game and to build up camaraderie in the team, Chappell and Sourav should sportingly adopt the forget-and-forgive attitude. 

I know its not an easy thing to do. After all, they are also human and it (the spat) would remain at the back of their minds. But in the interest of Indian cricket they should do so and concentrate on doing their respective jobs. 

But I am glad that the BCCI has come down hard on the players airing and writing their views in the media. Writing even one wrong word here or there could make a lot of difference (to the dressing room atmosphere). 

 Raj Singh Dungarpur: The meeting was just a drama as the committee had no authority to take a decision. The president (Ranbir Singh Mahendra) could have taken a decision on his own instead of having a meeting in Mumbai. 

But now that the crisis appeared to have blown over, it is time for the warring parties to start playing cricket. 

My only advise to Sourav is that when Chappell talks cricket, its better to listen to him. I am sure cricketers dont have wounds which last for life. I wish them both the best of luck so that Indian cricket proceeds further. 

 Aunshuman Gaekwad: The review committee had taken a sensible decision. BCCI appointed Chappell because they thought he could take Indian cricket forward while Sourav has been the most successful captain. The compromise was necessary as both have a role to play for the development of Indian cricket. 

 Dilip Vengsarkar: Its a good decision taken by the Board. But it would be difficult for the two to sink their differences. However, they must strive to do so for the good of Indian cricket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Organisers extend last date of entry

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: There has been an overwhelming response to Sunday?s Airtel The Telegraph Calcutta Marathon presented by CII. So much so that the organisers have been forced to extend the last date. 

The original plan was to accept entries for the fun run till Thursday. 

?But with so many people showing interest, we will take entries for the fun run till as late as possible on Saturday and even Sunday morning if possible,? said an organising official. 

The fun run, over a distance of 4.2 km, will be preceded by the flag-off of the main marathon (42.195 km) and the women?s professional race (10.5 km).

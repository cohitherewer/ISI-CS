Melbourne: Even as the hullabaloo over Svetlana Kuznetsova threatened to overshadow on-court action at the Australian Open on Tuesday, world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport, Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt quietly led the charge of seeds into the second round. 

Lleyton Hewitt maintained his perfect record against Arnaud Clement by beating the Frenchman 6-3, 6-4, 6-1. The Australian world No.3 stretched his record against Clement to 7-0, setting up a second-round meeting with US? James Blake. 

?It?s always tough playing the first match at the Aussie Open so I?m pleased to come away with a straight-sets win against a tough opponent,? Hewitt said. ?He?s a name player so I had to raise my game to beat him.? 

Hewitt, playing in a sleeveless, blue shirt on a packed centre court, unveiled his full range of shots, swiping winners down the line, angling the ball across the court and even chipping the bewildered Frenchman. 

The Australian?s serve, usually one of his least dangerous weapons, proved an unlikely asset. He fired down 12 aces, including one at 208 km/h and faced just one break point on serve in the match. 

Second seed Andy Roddick overcame a slow start to beat Georgia?s Irakli Labadze 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 and advance to the second round on Tuesday. 

The big-serving American fired 11 aces and broke his opponent five times to seal a comfortable victory in an hour and a half on the Melbourne Park centre court. 

The first 10 games went with serve but Roddick took control late in the opening set, breaking Labadze for the first time before winning 14 of the last 17 games. 

Tim Henman, seeded seventh, overcame a customary lapse in concentration to beat Frenchman Cyril Saulnier 6-1, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Tuesday. 

Henman recovered his poise after dropping the third set, easing through the fourth to set up a meeting with Romanian Victor Hanescu. 

Kuznetsova?s Russian compatriots Anastasia Myskina and Elena Dementieva also eased past lowly-ranked opponents while Venus Williams stumbled before joining them in the second round. 

On Tuesday, her Fed Cup teammate and French Open champion Myskina ? seeded third in Melbourne ? was untroubled in beating error-prone Czech Kveta Peschke 6-1, 6-4. 

Angry at being implicated in the scandal, sixth seed Dementieva still won 6-3, 6-3 over Ukrainian Alyona Bondarenko. Dechy, the 19th seed, beat Swiss Emmanuelle Gagliardi 6-4, 6-3. 

Davenport helped eased concerns about her health after bronchitis forced her out of a warm-up event in Sydney last week by thrashing Spaniard Conchita Martinez 6-1, 6-0. 

Davenport said she was still feeling the after effects of the bronchitis that had forced her to pull out of last week?s Sydney International but was confident it had almost cleared. 

Venus, the eighth seed, stuttered to a 6-1, 7-5 victory over Greek Eleni Daniilidou. A finalist in 2003, Venus stormed through the first set in just 23 minutes but was pushed harder in the second. 

?I didn?t have the best rhythm today,? Venus said. ?I kind of felt like I should have been up 5-0, but instead it was like 3-2 and 4-2. I think when it really mattered, at 5-5, I really picked up my game.? 

Molik, seeded 10th, kept local hopes alive when she downed Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-1, 6-3 after the Spaniard saved five match points only to surrender with a double fault.

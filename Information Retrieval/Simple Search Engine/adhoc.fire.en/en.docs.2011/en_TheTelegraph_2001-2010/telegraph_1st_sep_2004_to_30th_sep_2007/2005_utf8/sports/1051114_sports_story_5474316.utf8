Shanghai: Roger Federer made hard work of the start of his Masters Cup defence on Sunday before recovering to squeeze past Argentine David Nalbandian 6-3, 2-6, 6-4. 

The runaway world No. 1 is chasing a third consecutive finale title ? a feat last achieved by Ivan Lendl in 1985-87. 

In Sundays second Red Group match, Croatias Ivan Ljubicic beat another Argentine, Guillermo Coria, 6-2, 6-3. 

Mondays Gold Group matches will pit Andre Agassi against Nikolay Davydenko and Rafael Nadal against Gaston Gaudio. 

Federer was playing his first match since being sidelined by an ankle injury after winning his 11th title of the season on October 2, and appeared rusty at stages. 

He made an unusually high number of unforced errors against last-minute qualifier Nalbandian and found himself 3-1 down in the final set after a break of serve. 

However, a crunch backhand volley gave the Swiss the chance to claw his way back in the fifth game of the set at the state-of-the-art Qizhong Stadium and he never looked back. 

Thank God I got out of that one, the Wimbledon and US Open champion said. 

I was mentally ready for a two-sets defeat...(but) I took the opportunity he gave me and Im very happy right now. 

Nalbandian ? who now leads Federer 5-4 having won the pairs first five meetings ? was less thrilled with his performance. 

I feel I didnt prepare a hundred percent for this Masters. I was already on holiday when I received a last-minute call to come here, he said. 

He (Federer) is a great, great player with a lot of confidence. When I took the break (in the third set) I knew it was a very important game and I tried to stay focused, but it wasnt enough. 

Croatias Davis Cup hero Ljubicic saw his fine run of form continue as he beat Coria. The 1.93m Ljubicic, who was one of the last to qualify, used his height advantage to punch his way to an emphatic victory. 

Paes-Zimonjic win 

Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic got off to a winning start in Shanghai when they defeated the pair of Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor in a tough three-setter. 

The Indo-Serbian pair, who qualified for the elite eight-team event as the fifth highest ranked team, prevailed 7-5, 5-7, 6-3 in two hours and 18 minutes in the encounter at the Qi Zhong Stadium. 

In the other doubles match, seventh seeded Australian pair of Paul Hanley and Wayne Arthurs upset the top seeded Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, from the US 7-5, 6-7 (3), 7-6 (4). (Reuters)

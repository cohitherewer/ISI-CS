The Telegraph - Calcutta

 O?Sullivan scrapes through

 O?Sullivan is pondering his future in the game after the near-loss 

Sheffield: Champion Ronnie O?Sullivan fought back from the brink of defeat against qualifier Stephen Maguire to clinch a 10-9 victory in the first round of the world snooker championship on Saturday. 

After a tight opening session, O?Sullivan held a 5-4 lead but Maguire, in only his second appearance at the Crucible, came back strongly and moved to within a frame of victory at 9-7. 

The 24-year-old Scot was on course for a match-winning clearance in the 17th frame but a missed black proved crucial and Englishman O?Sullivan went on to win the frame and claim the next two to secure a thrilling victory. 

O?Sullivan said he had been resigned to losing and once again placed a question mark against his future in the game. 

?I was just quite happy to be going home and getting the season over with,? said the world No. 1. ?My heart?s not been in it and I?ve been reflecting on my career. 

?It?s quite an isolated lifestyle and I?ve suffered a lot this season. We?ll have to see what happens next season because I dont know if I could do another four or five years of that.? 

Maguire, who was also beaten by O?Sullivan in the first round of the tournament last year, spoke of his ?shock? at losing after going so close to causing a major upset. (REUTERS)

 Sourav doesnt need a godfather: Dalmiya

 - Losing group to raise contentious Himachal issue in supreme court

A STAFF REPORTER

 Jagmohan Dalmiya in Calcutta on Tuesday 

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya feels his groups defeat in the BCCI elections will not jeopardise Sourav Gangulys cricketing fut- ure. 

This talk of any (outside) influence on Souravs career is absolutely uncharitable. Sourav had never been in the team on the strength of any person. Hes proved his class and worth over the years and doesnt need any godfather now. I still feel Sourav has a few years cricket left in him, Dal- miya told a press confer- ence. 

Dalmiya, however, didnt rule out a fight against any injustice to Sourav. Be it Sourav or anyone else, if I see injustice being meted out to a player, Ill always fight for his cause, he said. 

He was graceful in defeat, but did not describe it as a debacle. 

Expressing disappointment over the Supreme Court-appointed observer T.S. Krishnamurthys role during the elections, the former BCCI and ICC president pointed out in relation to Himachal Pradeshs representative (Rajendra Zar) that one of our genuine voters was asked to sit out while a complete stranger, who had nothing to do with cricket, was allowed to vote. 

According to Dalmiya, had that not happened, the verdict in Sharad Pawars favour would have been thinner. 

When the Supreme Court is going to hear the election process on December 12, Dalmiya said his group would raise the contentious Himachal Pradesh issue. 

The observer was supposed to ensure that the elections are held properly and fairly. But surprisingly, he started giving affiliations, Dalmiya remar- ked. 

However, I accept the verdict. A new body means new ideas? My good wishes are with their (Pawars) team and if they require my cooperation (in running the affairs of the BCCI), I will always be there, Dalmiya said. 

When asked if it should be termed as the end of Dalmiya era, the famed administrator said smilingly: If it is so, I would be the happiest person. 

So, will the next BCCI AGM see Dalmiya storming back? You must have seen for the past one and a half year that Ive not been fighting for it, he replied. 

Only time will tell whether this man is going to come up with a masterstroke the next time aro- und.

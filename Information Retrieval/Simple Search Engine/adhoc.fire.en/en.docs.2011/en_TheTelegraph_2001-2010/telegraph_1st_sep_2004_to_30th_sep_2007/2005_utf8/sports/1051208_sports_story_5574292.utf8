 Redknapp back at Portsmouth

London: Harry Redknapp was reappointed manager of Portsmouth on Wednesday, one year after he quit the Premier League club for bitter south coast rivals Southampton. 

Redknapp, 58, resigned from second division Southampton on Saturday saying it had been the worst year of his life. 

He replaces Frenchman Alain Perrin, sacked last week after Portsmouths poor run of form, and faces a tough job to keep them up as they have collected just 10 points from 15 games. 

At a news conference at the club on Wednesday Redknapp said he had made a mistake leaving Fratton Park. 

I had the best couple of years of my footballing life here. I shouldnt have left, it was a bad mistake, he said. 

But Im delighted to be back. Its a massive challenge theres no doubt about it. It took a lot of hard work to get there (the Premier League) in the first place and will take a lot to stay there. 

Redknapp said he had agreed a contract until the end of the seasonwithout even seeing any figures. 

Well go to the end of the season and see what happens, he said.If we stay up well sit down and talk about it. Its not a money situation or a long contract, I just wanted to come back. 

Redknapps return had looked in doubt on Monday after Southampton rejected what it termed aderisory offer of compensation. 

Following further talks Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe said on Wednesday that a package had been agreed, allowing Redknapp to hold talks with Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric. 

This saga had got to the stage of being an embarrassment for football as a whole, Lowe said on his clubs website. 

Portsmouth have produced a compensation package that is just acceptable to this club and I consider that it is in Southamptons best interests to get on with the future rather than dwell on the past. 

Redknapp said he had been thinking about leaving Southampton a month ago. 

I never felt that I was that wanted there. There were things going on that I felt (were) difficult to live with as a football man, he said.

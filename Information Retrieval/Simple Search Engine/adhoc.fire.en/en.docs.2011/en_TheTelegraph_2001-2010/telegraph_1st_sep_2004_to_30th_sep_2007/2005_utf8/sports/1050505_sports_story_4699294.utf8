Liverpool: This was the magical night when Liverpool Football Club found themselves again, when they lived up to the weighty legacy of their glorious past and played with unyielding belief to reach the May 25 final of the Champions League. Driven on by the magnificent Didi Hamann, Liverpool ran the Chelsea juggernaut off the road to Istanbul. 

And the noise was just incredible. Either PSV Eindhoven or AC Milan await on the banks of the Bosphorus, but Liverpool will fear no one now. 

Luis Garcia?s early strike did the damage, but this was an evening of a red-shirted gladiators all over the pitch. Hamann was immense in midfield, Steven Gerrard and John Arne Riise not far behind in influence. In defence, the magnificent Jamie Carragher stood firm as Jose Mourinho?s Champions League run ended. 

Building for two hours from the moment the turnstiles clicked open, a wave of unbelievable noise had rolled into Chelsea?s players. John Terry and company had not needed to glance up at the sign in the tunnel reminding them that ?This is Anfield?. 

Within four minutes the fired-up hosts were ahead. Inevitably, Gerrard was involved, flicking the ball brilliantly over the thick blue line of Chelsea?s defence for Milan Baros to chase. Petr Cech raced from his line, Czech keeper against Czech striker with no mercy allowed for a compatriot. 

The collision was bone-juddering, the type that must have made even the watching Martin Johnson wince. Cech clattered Baros as the Liverpool forward poked the ball over him. Cech should have been dismissed but Lubos Michel waved play on, allowing Garcia to dart in to apply the coup de grace. 

William Gallas hooked the ball away but the Slovak linesman, Roman Slysko, ruled it had crossed the line. Four separate TV angles proved inconclusive, making it even more of a massive decision by Michel and his linesman. Here was one Roman the Kop was prepared to cheer Tuesday. 

This, as the watching Graham Taylor was wont to say, was a test. Yet Chelsea, deprived of Damien Duff and with Arjen Robben starting on the bench, struggled to find their stride. Liverpool dominated the half, snapping into tackles, launching counter-attacks, matching their fans? fervour. 

Challenge after challenge were unleashed on those in blue who dared enter his domain; Frank Lampard and Eidur Gudjohnsen were both dispossessed by Hamann tackles brimming with timing and commitment. 

Stunned, Chelsea looked for an outlet but Didier Drogba was too sluggish, even wasting a wonderful Joe Cole pass midway through a frenetic first half. Cole, commendably, and Lampard, inevitably, sought to fight through the red-tinged storm, trying desperately to drag Chelsea back into contention. 

In truth, there was little malicious about the challenges from the men in red. Hamann and Gerrard, Igor Biscan and Jamie Carragher simply took the sight of a Chelsea player in possession as an affront to them personally and Liverpool collectively. 

As the second half unfolded, Chelsea were beginning to gain in danger, at last stitching together some counter-attacks. But Hamann would not let them pass, blocking a shot from Cole and then sliding in to spirit the ball away from the charging Gudjohnsen. 

Still Chelsea pressed, Drogba and Gudjohnsen both shooting over from range. Then came Lampard just after the hour-mark, hitting a free-kick low and hard, the ball accelerating goalwards until Jerzy Dudek dropped to his right to push the ball to safety. 

Mourinho had to make his move. Robben raced on, so did Mateja Kezman. Chelsea were laying siege to Dudek?s area and only a fine interception by Carragher prevented the ball reaching Drogba. He then thwarted Robben. 

Six minutes of injury time had to be negotiated. And then, as Anfield held its breath, the well-placed Gudjohnsen shot wide, Michel blew for full time and Anfield just went crazy.

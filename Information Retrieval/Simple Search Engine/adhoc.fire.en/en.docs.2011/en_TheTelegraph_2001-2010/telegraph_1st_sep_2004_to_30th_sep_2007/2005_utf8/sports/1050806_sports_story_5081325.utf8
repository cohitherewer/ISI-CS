 Bond gets a licence to bowl

Harare: New Zealander Shane Bond is virtually assured of playing his first Test in two years against Zimbabwe in Harare on Sunday. 

Bond, among the fastest bowlers in the game, took 43 wickets in 10 Tests before breaking down with stress fractures of the spine in 2003. 

His comeback has been slow, but on Friday he was named in New Zealands squad of 12 for the first Test. 

Bond would be an unlikely choice for 12th-man, and is almost certain to be unleashed on a Zimbabwean team that would seem ill-equipped to handle his brand of pace. 

However, he was prepared to give the inexperienced home side the benefit of the doubt. Its going to be hard work, they have some experienced players, Bond told reporters on Friday. 

I cant wait to put the black cap on and get amongst it, he said. 

Lou Vincent, who batted at number four and scored 224 in his last test innings against Sri Lanka in Wellington in April, will open the innings with James Marshall.

Bloemfontein: South African-born Kevin Pietersen ignored a frosty reception from his opponents and the crowd to score an unbeaten maiden century out of England?s 270 for five during the second one-day International against South Africa on Wednesday. 

The powerful 24-year-old, who left for England after complaining about the lack of opportunities in South Africa, put on 80 with Michael Vaughan (42) for the fourth wicket and 92 off 79 deliveries with Paul Collingwood (40) for the fifth. 

He finished on 108 from 96 balls, hitting two sixes and six fours. The final 10 overs went for 77. 

Pietersen, whose two sixes came from effortless flicks over square leg, kissed his helmet and acknowledged the dressing room after reaching three figures, while most of the home crowd refused to applaud. 

When he walked off, many of spectators turned their back on him. The fans had booed him in the first match in Johannesburg. 

England, put in on a good but slowish track, lead the seven-match series 1-0. 

The touring side had raced to 50 without loss in the 10th over but the dismissal of Marcus Trescothick (37 off 36 balls) sparked a mini collapse as three wickets fell for 15 runs. 

Geraint Jones went for 20 and Andrew Strauss for two, beautifully caught down the leg side by a diving Mark Boucher, thus forcing Vaughan to rebuild cautiously with Pietersen before the pair picked up the pace.

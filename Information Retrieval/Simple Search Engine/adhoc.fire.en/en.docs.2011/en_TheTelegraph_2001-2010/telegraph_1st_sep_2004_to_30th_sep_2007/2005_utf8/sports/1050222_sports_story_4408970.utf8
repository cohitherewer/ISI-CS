Madrid: Real Betis midfielder Marcos Assuncao struck either side of halftime to earn his team a 2-0 win at home to Deportivo Coruna, that pushed them up into third place in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

The Brazilian fired in at the near post after a neat back-heel assist from Joaquin late in the first half and grabbed his second 13 minutes after the break, curling a trademark free kick past the despairing Depor keeper Gustavo Munua. 

The result meant Betis leapfrogged city rivals Sevilla, who slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad on Saturday, to take third place in the standings with a better goal difference. 

Barcelona stretched their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday with a 2-0 win against Real Mallorca while Real Madrid slumped to a 0-2 home defeat by Athletic Bilbao, their first loss under new coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo. 

Barca have 57 points from 24 games, Real follow on 50 while Betis and Sevilla are nine points further back on 41. 

Villarreal moved up to fifth, just a point behind Sevilla, after staging a magnificent second-half fightback to beat Atletico Madrid 3-2 at home after going two goals down at the break. 

Striker Fernando Torres put the visitors ahead with two classy finishes in the first half, but opposite number Diego Forlan took his tally for the season to 15 when he guided in at the near post midway through the second. 

Atletico defender Luis Perea then headed into his own net after Juan Roman Riquelme had sent a curling free kick into the area and Argentina midfielder Juan Pablo Sorin pounced three minutes into stoppage time to grab the all-important winner. 

Last season?s champions Valencia dropped to sixth after they slumped to a 0-1 defeat at struggling Racing Santander. 

Uruguayan midfielder Mario Regueiro scored the winner when he sent a sweetly-struck 20-metre free kick over the wall and into the net past Valencia keeper Andres Palop seven minutes into the second half. Palop stopped Fernando Moran from extending the home side?s lead on the hour when he scooped the midfielder?s powerful header off the line with a fine reflex save, but the visitors never looked like turning the game around. 

Valencia have now taken just three points from their last six games and this latest setback will heap the pressure on beleaguered Valencia coach Claudio Ranieri. 

Espanyol also lost ground in the hunt for the Champions League places when they went down 2-3 to an improving Malaga who have lost just one game in their last six outings under new coach Antonio Tapia. 

Elsewhere, a hat-trick by striker Francesco Flachi gave Sampdoria a 3-2 win over Reggina as the battle for Serie A?s Champions League berths hotted up on Sunday. 

The result gave Sampdoria 41 points from 25 matches, equal on points but with an inferior goal difference to Udinese, who currently occupy the fourth and final Champions League berth after a draw with Inter Milan on Saturday. 

The competition for a place in Europe?s top club competition promises to be more than a two-horse race, however, as Palermo consolidated sixth place on 39 points by beating Lecce 3-2.

 Nalbandian climbs to No. 6

Shanghai: David Nalbandians upset win over Roger Federer in the Masters Cup final here moved the 23-year-old Argentine up six places to a career-high No. 6 year-end ranking on the mens tennis tour. 

Federer was assured of the No. 1 year-end ranking for the second consecutive year after claiming his 11th title of the season in Bangkok on October 2. The 24-year-old Swiss star finished almost 2,000 points clear of No. 2 Rafael Nadal of Spain in the ATPS Entry Ranking System released on Monday 

Federer has remained No. 1 since February 2004, when the rankings were released following his win at the Australian Open. 

He was 81-4 in 2005, including titles at Wimbledon and the US Open. 

The top four remained unchanged. French Open winner Nadal stayed ahead of American Andy Roddick at No. 3 and Australias Lleyton Hewitt at No. 4. Russias Nikolay Davydenko moved two places to fifth. 

Nalbandian was drafted into the Masters Cup when Roddick withdrew. His 6-7 (4-7), 6-7 (11-13), 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (7-3) win over Federer in the final helped him climb up from No. 12 and finish in the top 10 for the third consecutive season. 

Andre Agassi and Guillermo Coria each dropped two places to Nos. 7 and 8, while croatias Ivan Ljubicic and Gaston Gaudio each slipped a place to Nos. 9 and 10.

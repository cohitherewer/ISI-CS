 Atwal sizzles with 5-under

 - COLONIAL MEET - Kenny Perry takes three-shot lead 

 Arjun Atwal completed a six-birdie round 

Fort Worth: Arjun Atwal roared back into form with a superb five-under par 65 to put himself in the frame for a good finish over the weekend in the Bank of America Colonial at the par-70 Colonial Country Club Friday. 

Atwal, despite being on limited exemption, has been on a roll this season. He continued his good work with a round of six birdies and just one bogey on the second day of the tournament, which saw him rise from tied 45th to tied 12th. 

Atwal who shot a par round of 70 on first day, is now five-under 135, but still some distance off the leader Kenny Perry, who is at 12-under 128. 

Meanwhile Daniel Chopra worked hard to make the cut, as he recovered from his first day score of three-over 73 to shoot a bogey-free three-under 67 to come to three-under and tied 52. He was even par for two days, as the cut came at one-over. 

Perry, champion at the Colonial in 2003, is having sight problems that make it difficult for him to read greens or see long distances and in shady spots. 

Yet, he managed a tournament record for two days at the Colonial and leads by three strokes after his second round 63 following a 65 on first day. 

DJ Trahan (67) and Ted Purdy (65), whose first tour victory came last week at the Byron Nelson, were tied for second at nine-under and Kirk Triplett was another stroke back in fourth after his second straight 66. 

First-round leader Patrick Sheehan, who had a 62 on the first day, went to 72 on second day. 

Atwal, who has made the cut in each of six appearances so far this season, has four finishes at tied 26th or better including two in top five and earned over $ 636,000. 

Atwal started on the first and birdied the second and third before dropping a shot on the seventh. 

He recovered immediately with birdies on eighth and ninth and turned in three-under. Two more birdies on 11th and 17th saw him come to five-under for a fine effort. 

Atwal, whose average driving distance of just under 300 yards had a better accuracy rate on second day and reached 12 greens in 18 and needed 25 putts for the day. 

He is now tied 12th in a bunch of 11 golfers that also includes David Toms, Peter Lonard, K.J. Choi, Stephen Leaney and Aaron Baddeley. 

Perry had a bogey-free 7-under 63 on second and it was his best round of the year he was without a three-putt for the second straight day. 

Perry has always had good results at the Colonial. He was second in 2002, winner in 2003 and 12th in 2004. 

Defending champion Steve Flesch missed the cut after shooting a 71 on second day. He had a 79 on first and ended at 10-over 150. 

World number four Phil Mickelson looked headed for the exit most of the day as he hovered on or below the one-over cutline.

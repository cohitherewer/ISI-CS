 Fleming has surgery to remove tumour

Wellington: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has had a potentially cancerous tumour removed from his face and will miss the first two ODIs against Australia next month, New Zealand Cricket said on Friday. 

Stephen last week had a potentially cancerous tumour removed from his jaw-line in front of his left ear, and yesterday received the very good news that the tumour was benign, team manager said in a statement.

 Best still on life support

London: George Best is in a critical but stable condition on a life support machine, a spokesman for the hospital treating him said on Sunday. Mr Best is stable with no further changes but he is still critical in intensive care, the spokesman said. 

The former Manchester United winger, one of the finest players in soccer history, has been in hospital since the beginning of October. He underwent a liver transplant in 2002 after years of heavy drinking. 

On Sunday, a picture of Best looking gaunt and yellow was published on the front page of a tabloid with a message saying Dont Die Like Me. The paper said Best had asked for it to be published as a warning to others about the dangers of excess drinking. 

George could never beat his drink problem, but he told me I hope my plight can act as a warning to others, Bests agent and friend Phil Hughes told the paper. 

The former Northern Ireland international, 59, was initially admitted to hospital after having a reaction to the treatment he was receiving for his new liver and then suffered internal bleeding linked to a bowel infection.

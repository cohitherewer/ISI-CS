 Ebrahim 13th in feature race

Sydney: Team India, powered by teenage driver Armaan Ebrahim, finished 13th in the feature race of the Australian A1 Grand Prix, the fourth leg of the inaugural motor racing championship, at the challenging Eastern Creek Raceway on Sunday. 

Starting from 17th in the grid after the 19-laps sprint race where he clocked 31:25.335, Ebrahim did well to finish the feature race as 10 of the 24 teams crashed out. The Indian clocked 1::01:08.343 ahead of Michael Devaney of Ireland. 

French driver Nicolas LaPierre won both races, taking the chequered flag after starting from pole position in the 30-km sprint race from Portugals Alvaro Parente and Brazilian Nelson Piquet junior. 

The Frenchman then won a drama-filled feature event from Britains Robbie Kerr and Switzerlands Neel Jani. The race was stopped several times because of a series of high-speed crashes. 

The double victory took France to 71 points at the top of the standings. Brazil were second with 52 and Switzerland third on 47. India are yet to open their account. 

The fifth of the 12 race series is on November 20 in Sepang. (AGENCIES)

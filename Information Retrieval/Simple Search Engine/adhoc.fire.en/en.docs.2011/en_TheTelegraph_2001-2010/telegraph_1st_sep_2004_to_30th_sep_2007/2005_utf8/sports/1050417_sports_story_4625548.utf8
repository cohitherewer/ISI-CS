The Telegraph - Calcutta

 BHA rides low on clouded vision

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Gurbux Singh, Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) secretary, Olympic gold medallist and national selector, remains a worried man. 

His crusade for an astroturf for the state?s players have so far fallen on deaf ears, and when, the other day, he placed a letter expressing his desire to quit his job at the BHA, his president former DG of police Dinesh Vajpai, there was little reaction except for the obvious neutralisation of the chit. 

The letter is non-news. And Vajpai?s ?promise? that something would be done, waits to enter the same realm. There is need for a change, for some work done. This crusade is fast becoming a charade. Football pushes ahead, cricket does too, even kabaddi will, if things aren?t done perforce. 

Gurbux himself feels that the ?vision? with which he had come to this office has not developed. ?The president said we need to fight it,? said Gurbux. Gurbux agrees, everybody agrees, but perhaps there is a catch in the ?fight?. And perhaps the fact that the focus has been trained only on the astroturf makes it a smaller cause. 

It is time the BHA leaned to look at the bigger picture. There is a marginalisation of the sport in this state, all the Olympic gold medals notwithstanding, and all the BHA is asking for is an astroturf. Does not reflect well on the maturity level of the organisation. Demands should include anything from own ground, to academy, to gymnasium, to special coaches (even foreign) and a promotional that links the sport today with the glamour world. 

There?s no point in a tragic hero. These days tragic heroes aren?t allowed too many endorsements. The game needs an image overhaul here. And a good deal of sheer force. 

The resignation has been abortive. Good for the sport. One hopes the association?s president walks his talk.

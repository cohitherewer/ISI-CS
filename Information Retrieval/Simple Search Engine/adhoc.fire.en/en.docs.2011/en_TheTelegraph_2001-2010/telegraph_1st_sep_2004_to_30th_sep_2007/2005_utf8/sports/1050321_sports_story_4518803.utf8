 Harinder lifts crown

Chandigarh: Harinder Gupta held on to his nerves to win the Rs 10-lakh Hero Golf Chandigarh Open on Sunday. 

The 22-year-old brought in a two under-70 card, for an overall eight-under 280. Two strokes behind were overnight leader Mukesh Kumar and Arjun Singh who finished tied for the second spot. Arjun shot a final round 68. 

Ashok Kumar scored a one-over 73 to finish fourth, Binod Pandey was fifth with a 284 aggregate, while Pappan finished sixth. 

With just a stroke behind and a hole to go, Ashok faltered on his drive, landing on the left jungle from where he made a double bogey. 

Harinder had a tough time with the two experienced pros Ashok and Mukesh and it became evident that he was under pressure to defend his title as he began with a bogey. 

But a chip-in on the 10th for a birdie paved way for his victory

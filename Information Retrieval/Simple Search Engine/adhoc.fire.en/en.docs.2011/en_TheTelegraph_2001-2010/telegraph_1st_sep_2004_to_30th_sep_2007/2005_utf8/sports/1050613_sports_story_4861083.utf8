 Glorious Breaker shocks 

 TITAN BOY

 Glorious Breaker, a Darius Byramji-trained friendless runner, brought about a sensational upset in the Fillies Trial Stakes, the first classic at the Bangalore races held on Sunday. Harish,who partnered the Glory Of Dancer-Making Waves daughter, beat another rank-outsider, Integrate, by a length and a quarter.

 The race also witnessed the fall of jockey Y. Srinath from the front-running Queen Of Swords. It was after C. Alford brought the 11-4 favourite Calcutta-hope, Romantic Liaison, into contention but failed to stop the filly from shifting-in during the final 300 metres.

 Alford failed to touch the board and was also stood-down for seven race days ? from June 22 to June 29 ? by the Bangalore Turf Club stewards, for careless riding.

 Smith wants no let up in pressure

 - FOURTH TEST 

 Slump can?t be fixed in a matter of months: King 

 Pollock may replace Zondeki 

St John?s: South Africa, with the series already wrapped up, will look to pile on more misery for the West Indies in the fourth and final Test starting here Friday. 

The way the South Africans have risen to the challenge in the previous two Tests, they may be forgiven if they relax for this Test, but Proteas? captain Graeme Smith is adamant that his side will be focussed on winning the final Test. 

?One thing we learnt from the eight or nine months of tough times is that we cannot afford to take a Test match win, Test match form or personal form for granted, so we will be looking to perform well out there every single day of the match,? he said. 

?There are times when a team can produce some good performances that are very satisfying, but we have to move on and keep moving forward, and make sure that we keep improving as a team. 

?We should never be satisfied with our position, and we should look to take our game up a level or two each time.? 

Veteran all-rounder Shaun Pollock seems likely to be the only change, and could take place of fellow fast bowler Monde Zondeki. 

Following the huge defeat in the previous Test, the reputation of the West Indies in international cricket continues to plummet, and it has left people around the Caribbean clamouring for changes not only in the team, but in the administration of the game. 

Coach Bennett King is well aware that the honeymoon period is swiftly drawing to a close, and the need for better results is urgent. 

 ?Coming into this role, I was not expecting to all of a sudden see the West Indies become the number one side in the world. Things take time. It cannot be fixed in a matter of months, but over a period of time. 

For West Indies, Tino Best should come in for his first match of the series and international fixture since last August to replace Reon King, and Narsingh Deonarine should take the place of fellow left-hander Ryan Hinds.

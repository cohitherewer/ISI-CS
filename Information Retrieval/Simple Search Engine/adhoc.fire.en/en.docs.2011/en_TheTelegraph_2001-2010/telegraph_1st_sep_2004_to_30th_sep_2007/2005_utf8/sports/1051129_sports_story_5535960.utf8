Madrid/Milan: Champions Barcelona produced another clinical display to brush aside Racing Santander 4-1 at the Nou Camp and reclaim top spot in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

Dazzling individual goals from Samuel Eto and Argentine teenager Lionel Messi, a Ronaldinho penalty and a rare strike from fullback Silvinho earned the Catalans an eighth straight win in all competitions. 

Frank Rijkaards side lead the standings on goal difference ahead of surprise package Osasuna who came from a goal down to clinch an exciting 3-2 victory over Alaves and preserve their 100 percent record at home this season. 

Both teams have 28 points from 13 games, five ahead of Villarreal who extended their unbeaten run to nine games with a 2-0 win at Deportivo Coruna, the goals coming from Argentine internationals Juan Roman Riquelme and Juan Pablo Sorin. 

Real Madrid, who suffered a 0-3 mauling at the hands of Barcelona last week, are back in sixth place after snatching a late 2-2 draw at Real Sociedad. 

Real appeared down and out after Sociedad had gone 2-0 up thanks to a Xabi Prieto penalty and an opportunist strike from Oscar de Paula. 

Bravo stabbed in from close range after a David Beckham corner in the 87th minute and Zidane pounced on a loose ball to make it 2-2 a little over a minute later. 

Barcelona took the lead after half an hour thanks to a magnificent individual goal from leading scorer Eto. 

The 19-year-old Messi broke clear just inside the Racing half, cut inside a defender and fired low past Aouate seven minutes after the break. 

Ronaldinho then blasted home from the penalty spot after he had been felled by desperate Racing defender Pablo Pinillos after beating him with a dazzling step over and jink. 

Fellow Brazilian Silvinho completed the rout when he bundled into the net after a fine jinking run into the area. 

Racing scored a consolation when Francisco Casquero converted a penalty. 

Meanwhile in Serie A, champions Juventus maintained their five-point lead with goals from Adrian Mutu, David Trezeguet and substitute Alessandro Del Piero giving them a 3-1 home win over Treviso on Sunday. 

Treviso had taken the lead through Francesco Parravicini before Fabio Capellos side took control. 

Juventus are on 36 points from 13 matches with second-placed AC Milan, who beat Lecce 2-1 on Saturday, on 31 points and third-placed Fiorentina on 29 points after they drew 1-1 at AS Roma. 

Uruguayan Alvaro Recoba and Argentine Esteban Cambiasso were on target for Inter Milan in their 2-1 win at Messina while Udinese enjoyed a 2-1 victory at Parma. 

Lazio came from behind to win 3-2 at Empoli while Cagliari picked up their first victory of the campaign with a 2-0 win over Sampdoria ? both goals coming from Honduran striker David Suazo. 

Parravicini gave Juventus a shock in the 25th minute, firing home a low shot past Christian Abbiati after good work down the right flank from Francesco Galeoto.

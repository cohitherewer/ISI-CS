 ICPA: Sourav ban ?excessive? 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Indian Cricket Players? Association (ICPA) on Tuesday came out in support of Sourav Ganguly and termed as ?excessive? the six-match ban, slapped on him by the Match Referee Chris Broad. 

?We feel that the six-match ban is excessive. We realise that the ICC has to ensure over rates, but a six-match ban could impact a player?s career ? surely, that is not the intention of the ICC,? an ICPA statement said. 

The ICPA also lauded the BCCI for standing by Sourav.

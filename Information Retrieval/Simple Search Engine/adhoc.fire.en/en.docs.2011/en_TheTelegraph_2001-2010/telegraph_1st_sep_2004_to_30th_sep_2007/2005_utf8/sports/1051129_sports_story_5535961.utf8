 Beckham academy begins

London: David Beckham opened his London soccer academy alongside the Millennium Dome on Monday, just a short distance from where the England captain was born. 

The 30-year-old Real Madrid midfielder watched a video presentation before taking part in skills sessions with local school children. 

This is a special day for me and one of the proudest moments in my life, Beckham said. I have for many years had an ambition to give children the same opportunities I had through football coaching. 

As a young boy I attended the Bobby Charlton soccer school with dreams of becoming a professional footballer. 

The academy has two full-size pitches plus classrooms, training facilities, changing rooms and restaurants. 

It is about education in football. Not just teaching youngsters how to kick a ball properly but education on diet and fitness, Beckham added. 

The academy will be run by director of coaching Eric Harrison, formerly a youth team coach at Manchester United who played a part in developing players including Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary and Phil Neville. (Reuters)

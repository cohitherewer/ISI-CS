 Newcastle agree to record fee for Owen

Newcastle: Newcastle United have agreed to a club record transfer fee with Real Madrid for England striker Michael Owen, the Premier League club said on Wednesday. 

Newcastle have met Real Madrids asking price and conditions, Newcastle said in a statement. 

The agreed fee will be a record transfer fee for Newcastle United. It is now up to the player and his advisor. 

If Owen, who has struggled to establish himself in the Real first team, moves to the north-east club it will surpass the ?15 million they paid Blackburn Rovers for Alan Shearer in 1996. 

Real confirmed an agreement with Newcastle had been reached and said Owen was free to leave after one season at the Bernabeu. 

Newcastle have made a very serious offer that has met the requirements of Real Madrid, the clubs director of communications Antonio Garcia Ferreras said. 

The move now depends on Newcastle and the player reaching an agreement themselves, but as far as Real Madrid is concerned Michael Owen has the go-ahead to leave. 

Sources close to the Spanish club suggest that Newcastle have offered over 20 million euros for the player, named European Footballer of the Year in 2001. 

Earlier, Owen was quoted by British media as saying he wanted a starting place at Real but if not then he would prefer a return to former club Liverpool, where he scored 158 goals in 297 matches. 

Owen said if a deal with Liverpool could not be finalised, then he had agreed to join Newcastle on loan. 

Real said they had not received any offer for Owen from European champions Liverpool. 

Owen joined Real in August last year for ?8 million but unlike Galactico predecessors Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham, the England striker did not walk straight into the first team. (Reuters)

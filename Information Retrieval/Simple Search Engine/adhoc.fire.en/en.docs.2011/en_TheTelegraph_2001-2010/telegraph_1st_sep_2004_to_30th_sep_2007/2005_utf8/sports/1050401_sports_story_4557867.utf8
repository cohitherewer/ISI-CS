 Narain oozing confidence

Manama (Bahrain): Brimming with confidence after completing his first two races at Melbourne and Sepang, India?s first Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan is now looking to improve his performance in this Sunday?s third Grand Prix. 

?I have acquired a bit more experience after the first two Grand Prix, so I am hoping I will also finish the race and make a better result here in Bahrain,? Narain said. 

?I have been around the track and I have to say that it is fantastic. I am sure the race will be competitive, as there are at least three genuine overtaking opportunities,? the 28-year-old Jordan driver was quoted as saying on the official website of Formula One. 

?The sand might make the circuit tricky but at least it will not be as hot and humid as in Malaysia,? said Narain who arrived here on Monday. 

On his visit here immediately after the Malaysian Grand Prix, the Chennai-born said it was a short promotional stay and he was now looking forward to a good weekend. 

?After the race in Sepang, I went straight to Bahrain for a one-day promotional visit before returning to India for a couple of days. I met about 4000 Indian school children, some Bahrain international circuit officials and the Indian ambassador. 

?Although it was a very short stay, I have really enjoyed being in Bahrain and I am looking forward to the weekend.?

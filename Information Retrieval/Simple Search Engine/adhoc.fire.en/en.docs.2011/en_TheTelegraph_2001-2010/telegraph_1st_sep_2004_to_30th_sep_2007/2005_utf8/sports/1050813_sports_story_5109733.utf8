 Rasalas for main event 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It may turn out to be another close tussle between Rasalas and Champion Crusader in the star event of Saturday, the 1,400m Independence Cup.

 Last winter, the two horses had taken their battle to the wire over a mile trip when Rasalas was at a 7-kg weight disadvantage against Champion Crusader, who was making his debut. But Rasalas had hung-out during the crucial stages of the race on that day.

 Although the Crusader displayed vast improvement subsequently, the weight difference between the two now is a mere 2-1/2 kg. This factor tilts the scales in favour of the Daniel David-ward by Storm Trooper out of Ruddles who may strike it rich in the hands of jockey B. Prakash.

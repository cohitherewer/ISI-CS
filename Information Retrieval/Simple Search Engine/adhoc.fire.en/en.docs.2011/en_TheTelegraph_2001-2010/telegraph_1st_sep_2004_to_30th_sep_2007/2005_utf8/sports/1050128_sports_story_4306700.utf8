Calcutta: Almost four months after the 75th annual general meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was adjourned, the new set of office-bearers, led by president Ranbir Singh Mahendra, formally took over charge from Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

However, uncertainty remains over the two contentious issues ? Dalmiya?s assuming the office of patron-in-chief and on who is to represent the BCCI at ICC meetings. 

The AGM was adjourned on September 30 and was reconvened Thursday after the Supreme Court allowed it to happen.

BCCI secretary, S. K. Nair, later said that he would represent the Board at the ICC CEO?s meeting in Melbourne from Wednesday. ?This particular meeting does not pose any problem for us. It is the meeting of CEOs, and I am the CEO of BCCI,? Nair said. 

Dalmiya expressed surprise at all cases against the current regime being filed from Chennai. ?This I feel is very significant? Now we?re getting accustomed to all this. It?s part of democracy,? he said sarcastically. 

 War of words 

The war of words continues with Dungarpur Thursday urging Dalmiya to ?retire gracefully?. Hitting back, Dalmiya said: ?People in glass houses shouldn?t throw stones. If my predecessors continue to attack me, I have to think about it. So far, they were going on unopposed. But??

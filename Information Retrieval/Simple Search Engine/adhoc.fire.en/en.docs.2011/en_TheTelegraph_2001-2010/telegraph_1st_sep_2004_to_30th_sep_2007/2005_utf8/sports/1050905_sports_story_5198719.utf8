 Sukhwinder to stay, says AIFF official

Chennai: In a sharp contrast to the emerging call for replacing Sukhwinder Singh as senior India coach, a senior All India Football Federation (AIFF) official said on Sunday that he would continue in the hot seat. 

The AIFF vice-president C.R. Viswanathan said neither the federation president (Priya Ranjan Das Munshi) nor the executive committee was contemplating to carry out any change for the national coach. 

[While the AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco could not be reached for comment, another vice-president Subrata Dutta pleaded ignorance when asked about the development. 

Im going to New Delhi tomorrow for the AIFF executive committee meeting. As of now, Im not aware of such a news,Dutta, who is also the IFA secretary, said on Sunday, adds A Staff Reporter in Calcutta.]

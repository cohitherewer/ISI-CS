The Telegraph - Calcutta

 It was a PR suicide mission

 - LONDON 2012 OLYMPICS BID - Be strategic, don?t shout about it 

 SUE MOTT

 ?Inducements? is the No. 2 bad word after ?drugs? for IOC chief Jacques Rogge 

If there is one word ? besides ?drugs? ? which has the Olympic movement running like 100m sprinters in the opposite direction, it is ?inducements?. Never again, they said, after Salt Lake City when the Americans took the quick route to gaining the Winter Olympics by including stuffed brown envelopes with the voting forms. The incumbent International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, came to power on a clean-up ticket. He is now the world?s most high-profile janitor. 

It is against this background that the London 2012 bid team noisily, and calamitously, offered a string of financial inducements to host the Games at a presentation in Berlin last week. Didn?t they smell the bleach and the danger? These offers were called ?Charters?, but the parchment on which they were printed owed more to the dollar bill than a bill of rights. 

They included $50,000 each to the 200 National Olympic Committees to defray the expense of setting up training camps in Britain, free, fully flexible air tickets, free rail travel in the UK for athletes for a fortnight before and after the Olympics, discounts on theatres, restaurants and shops, ?60 free telephone calls from the Olympic Village and, with startling generosity, the cost of hosting a senior member of every NOC for a full year prior to the Games. 

None of which, in themselves, are that bad. It is certainly not the same as saying: ?Look, help yourself round Harrods, have a couple of season tickets for Chelsea, here?s a gift voucher for dinner with the Queen (redeemable at Buckingham Palace, not weekends) and that pile of money is all yours.? These were not flat-out bribes, they were sweeteners, inducements, financial prods in London?s directions. 

But they were a PR suicide mission. However well-intentioned, however beautifully packaged, however damn useful to the under-funded Olympic committees, they raise the spectre of an Olympic movement with their handout. By standing on a soapbox in Berlin and declaring, happily, loudly, naively to the world that London was throwing money around, our 2012 bid team sent a shiver of fear down the ramrod moral spine of Rogge and all those others of his ilk who detest the old snout-in trough image of the organisation. 

Now the subliminal message will be: ?Don?t vote for London for heaven?s sake, it will look like we are still up there grasping?. 

That is why London have performed their embarrassing U-turn. Not because they did not want to put the ethics committee to any further trouble, but because ? in belated technicolour glory ? they saw the scale of this error of judgement. 

You have to believe the bid president, Lord Coe, when he announces his good intentions. Above all, you can trust he is a former athlete with a mission to look after athletes. But what about the marketing geniuses recruited to the campaign? What about the so-called PR gurus, including the former head of communications at UEFA, Mike Lee? 

This is all the more desperately galling because London had been gaining with sure-footed stealth on the assumed leader, Paris. We were breathing down their necks. Technically ? better. Legacy ? better. Ad campaign ? award-winningly wonderful. To see all these advantages thrown away on what looks like a Machiavellian plot to sail as close to the wind as possible over the financial rules is madness. 

Be strategic by all means and donating money was rarely a bad strategy in the human sphere, but don?t shout about it. If London had merely let it be known that money was available for the cost of setting up training centres in Britain ? ?Have a canape, have a camp,? Seb could have advised over cocktails ? few could have taken umbrage. But it was too much, too public, too clever by half and far too unappreciative of the backlash. 

?We weren?t aware we were breaking any rules,? said Lord Coe, carefully. They should have been aware. Very aware. Awareness is an astute part of politics. You can bet the Parisians, the New Yorkers, the Muscovites and those manning the bid in Madrid are aware of the mileage they can make from this error only three months away from the vote. 

London was trying to steal their rivals? thunder. They have been singed, perhaps mortally, by a lightning bolt of rebuke instead. The line the bid team are now taking is that with ?mature reflection? they are withdrawing the offer but it will not remotely affect the outcome of the vote in Singapore. 

None of us, including them, can be so sure.

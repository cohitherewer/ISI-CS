 Federer comfortable being No. 1: McEnroe

RAY FRAGER

The US Open begins its two-week run in New York and on USA Network and CBS on Monday, so the question is: What is the No. 1 story of the tournament? 

How about: Does Rafael Nadal have clam-diggers to match the new blue court? 

You want a better story? Lets go with analyst Patrick McEnroe, then: Can anyone stop (Roger) Federer? 

The No. 1 mens player in the world has treated fans to stylish, dominant tennis and comes into the Open as the overwhelming favourite. The other half of the McEnroe Brothers Tennis Analysis firm, John, said Federer is approaching historic status. 

He makes it look so easy, John McEnroe said in a conference call on Thursday. He seems so comfortable being No. 1. If he keeps it up for four years, hes going to be the greatest player who ever lived. 

On the womens side, Tracy Austin said, the first week should be anything but routine. 

There are more questions in the first week than weve seen in a womens major in a long time, Austin said, citing the issues of Serena Williams fitness and the match readiness of Lindsay Davenport and Maria Sharapova. 

The question that nearly always dogs tennis, though, is how to increase its popularity. 

We should be trying anything and everything, John McEnroe said, mentioning how the NFL ? despite its undisputed position as the countrys No. 1 sport ? is always trying things. 

Its amazing how little has changed in tennis. This big innovation is having a blue court. That is a major change in our sport? Players need to make themselves more accessible, we need better marketing, different camera angles. 

Austin had an intriguing suggestion: use electronic line calling and give players a couple of call challenges per set. 

John McEnroe said the Open would benefit from moving the mens and womens finals to prime time on Sunday and Monday nights. For one thing, as Open viewers well know, some of the best tennis comes in the night sessions. 

There an energy there. Players have more time to get themselves psyched up, he said.

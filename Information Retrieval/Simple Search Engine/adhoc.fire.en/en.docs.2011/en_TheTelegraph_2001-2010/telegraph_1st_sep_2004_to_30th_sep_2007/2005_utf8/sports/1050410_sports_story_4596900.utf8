 Title for Mukesh

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mukesh Kumar clinched his sixth Amby Valley PGAI Tour crown, hitting a record four day aggregate of 30-under 250 at the DDA Open golf meet on Saturday. 

According to information received here, city-based Yusuf Ali came second, firing five-under 65 to finish at 24-under 256 for the week. He shared the spot with Jaipur?s Vishal Singh, who had an identical round. Yusuf fired six birdies and a bogey in today?s round. 

Mukesh?s effort saw him better the 26-under by Jeev Milkha Singh at the Phillip Morris meet in 1996 (on the Asian PGA Tour). He missed the record tournament aggregate on the US PGA Tour, set by Ernie Els at the Mercedes Open, by a single stroke. 

With a winner?s cheque of Rs 1,62,000, Mukesh took his season?s earnings to Rs 24,00,100. 

Mukesh made birdies on the third, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 11th, 13th, 14th and on the 15th holes including two bogeys on the 12th and the 16th holes. 

Vikrant Chopra emerged the best in amateurs.

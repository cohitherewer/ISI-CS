 Nadal may rock French Open

London: Rafael Nadal starts the French Open as one of several wide-eyed teenagers making their Roland Garros debuts. Unlike the rest, however, the Spaniard could well end up winning it. 

The Mallorcan turns 19 during the course of the claycourt Grand Slam. He has already come of age on the ATP Tour with some extraordinary tennis in 2005. 

He arrives in Paris having won his last three tournaments ? the Monte Carlo Masters, the Barcelona Open and the Rome Masters. Nadal has claimed five titles in total this season, and is on a 17-match winning streak. Having finished last year ranked 51, he is now firmly established in the top 10. 

Only world No.1 Roger Federer, who like Nadal will be seeking a first French Open crown, can better that record with 41 wins in his 43 matches and six titles this year. 

Clay, though, is a great leveller. Federer has enjoyed least success on the slowest of the tennis surfaces and Nadals natural aptitude to it means there will be little to choose between them. 

Unsurprisingly, the Spaniard rejects the idea that he is the out-and-out favourite, despite having dominated the claycourt season so far. 

His absence from the Hamburg event was almost certainly a blessing in disguise, given that the French Open is the most gruelling of all the Grand Slam fortnights, with five-set matches commonly lasting more than four hours. 

One player who knows all about winning on the draining Roland Garros clay, the 1995 champion Thomas Muster of Austria, believes it is only a matter of time before Nadals coronation. 

Hes coming out with the attitude that hes going to go for it and thats already a very big step.

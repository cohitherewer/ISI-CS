 Rain plays spoilsport

Beijing: Top seed Rafael Nadal may have to play two matches at the China Open on Friday after rain washed out the entire days play on Thursday. 

Second seed Guillermo Coria also faces the prospect of two matches in a day while organisers try to clear a backlog of matches caused by the rain. 

China Open officials were forced to call off four second round matches at the $1.1 million tournament, including Nadals clash with American Justin Gimelstob. 

The 19-year-old Spaniard began his quest for a 10th title of year with an easy win over Taiwans Wang Yeu-tzuoo in his first appearance on Wednesday. Argentinas Coria will play Japans Toshihide Matsui, who received an entry into the draw after Slovak Dominik Hrbaty pulled out with a back injury. (Reuters)

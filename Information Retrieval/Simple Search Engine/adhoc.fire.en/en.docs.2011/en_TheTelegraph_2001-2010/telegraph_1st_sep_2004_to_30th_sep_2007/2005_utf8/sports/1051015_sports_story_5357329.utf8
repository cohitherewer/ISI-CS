 Buchanan gets extension till World Cup

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Sydney: Cricket Australia (CA) has extended coach John Buchanans contract till the 2007 World Cup. Unusually, the announcement was made during the tea break on Day I of the Super Test at the SCG. 

Buchanan, it may be recalled, had come under heavy fire after the Ashes defeat and there was speculation that his innings (which began in late 1999) would end now itself. That, however, has been set at rest. 

Im relieved and happy, Buchanan declared after CA chairman Bob Merriman announced the extension. 

Later, talking to The Telegraph, Buchanan said that team culture is something he intends taking forward. The past six years have made me realise its importance... It needs to be regularly topped up... 

Meanwhile, the CA review committee (which includes greats Allan Border and Mark Taylor) still hasnt completed the exercise launched between the fourth and fifth Ashes Tests. Among other things, it is looking at specialist coaches to help Buchanan.

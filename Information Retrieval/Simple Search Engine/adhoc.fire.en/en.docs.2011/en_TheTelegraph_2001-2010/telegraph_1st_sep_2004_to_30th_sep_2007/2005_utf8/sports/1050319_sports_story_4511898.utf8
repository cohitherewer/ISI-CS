The Telegraph - Calcutta

Shoaib eager to play ODIs

- Even if I get three matches, I will be more than delighted

 Shoaib hasnt started bowling at the nets, 

says Pak trainer

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on Friday said he was keen on playing in India in the ongoing series and hoped to return for at least the last three ODIs. 

?I am desperately keen to play in India. I want to make the maximum representation but everything depends on my fitness. Even if I get three one-dayers, I will be more than delighted,? Shoaib said from Lahore, indirectly ruling out his return before the fourth ODI scheduled in Ahmedabad on April 14. 

Shoaib missed the tour of India owing to a hamstring injury during Pakistan?s tour Down Under, where he was also fined and reprimanded for breaching the Code of Conduct. 

Trainer Grant Compton, who is supervising the controversial fast bowler?s fitness, said Shoaib had not yet started bowling. 

?He has not yet resumed bowling in the nets. I expect him to start bowling from next week,? Compton, who is attached to PCB?s National Cricket Academy in Lahore, said. 

?I would like to inform you on Shoaib?s progress but I can?t because of my contract with the PCB,? he added. 

On whether he was updating Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer on this issue, Compton said: ?yes, on a weekly basis.? 

Meanwhile, PCB director (board operations) Abbas Zaidi said there was little chance of Shoaib joining the team in India. ?Shoaib is not fit and thus not ready yet to tour India even for the one-day series. He has not made himself available for the series as yet,? Zaidi said. 

?So far, he has not made himself available for selection, so the question of considering him for the one-day series does not arise,? the PCB director told a local newspaper. 

Chairman of Pakistan selectors Wasim Bari said only a fully fit player would be considered for selection. 

?I?ve already asked pacer Rao Iftikhar to report at the NCA and stay tuned up as he might get a call to join the team in India for the ODIs. 

?However, the selection committee has not yet made up its mind on selection of players for the one-day series,? he added.

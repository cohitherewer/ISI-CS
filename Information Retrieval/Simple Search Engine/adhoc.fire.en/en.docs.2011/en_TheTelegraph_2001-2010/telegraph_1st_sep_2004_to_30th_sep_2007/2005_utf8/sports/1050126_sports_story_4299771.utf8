 Mohali impresses Pak team

Mohali: The two-member Venue Assessment Team from Pakistan on Tuesday inspected the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) stadium here ? the venue for the first Indo-Pak Test ? and described the facilities as ?excellent and very impressive.? 

The team, comprising Zakir Khan, general manager (cricket operations) of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Sohail Khan, senior superintendent of police, Lahore, was taken around the PCA Stadium by association treasurer G.S. Walia. 

[A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: The two PCB nominees reached here late on Tuesday and will head for Jamshedpur on Wednesday morning. They are going to be accompanied by Jharkhand State Cricket Association president, Amitabh Chaudhury. The Keenan, of course, is slated to host one of the ODIs. 

The duo is expected back in Calcutta on Wednesday evening itself for a discussion with BCCI officials, who will be assembling here for Thursday?s adjourned AGM.] 

Later, talking to the media, Zakir Khan said they had come to see the facilities including playing conditions and security, which has become a common practice for visiting teams and ?a part of the cricket family system?. 

?All of these are of highest quality,? he said. Zakir Khan, however, refused to comment on Ahmedabad as a venue for the second Test. 

Sohail Khan, echoing the same views, dismissed reports of Pakistan being ?averse? to playing in Ahmedabad as a speculation by the media. (PTI)

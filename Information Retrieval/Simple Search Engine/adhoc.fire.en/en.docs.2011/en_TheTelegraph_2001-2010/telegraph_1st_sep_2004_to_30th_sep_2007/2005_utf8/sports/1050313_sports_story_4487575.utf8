 Prince bolsters SA 

 - Second Test vs Zimbabwe 

 Ashwell Prince scored his maiden Test century on Saturday 

Centurion: Ashwell Prince scored his maiden century to give South Africa the upper hand after the second day of the second Test on Saturday. 

South Africa reached the close on 380 for six, a lead of 111 over Zimbabwe?s first innings of 269. 

Prince smashed an unbeaten 101 with 13 fours and two sixes.Jacques Kallis helped Prince add 119 for the sixth wicket after the South Africans had slipped to 219 for five. 

Heath Streak was the pick of the Zimbabwean bowlers with two for 57. 

Resuming on 13 without loss, South African openers AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith took their stand to 93 before Smith top-edged a pull shot off the bowling of medium pacer Elton Chigumbura to Barney Rogers at square leg. 

Smith hit four fours and a six in his brisk 41, which he scored off 46 balls. 

De Villiers was dismissed five overs later when he edged a drive off Christopher Mpofu to Hamilton Masakadza at first slip. De Villiers? 47 included seven fours and a six. 

Prince and Kallis held sway with enterprising batting until the third over after the new ball was taken, when Kallis dragged a delivery from Streak on to his stumps. He faced 106 balls and hit five fours and two sixes. 

Kallis batted at number seven instead of his usual number four position because he was off the field for much of Friday?s play after injuring his right hip while bowling. The allrounder received a cortisone injection, which left him with double vision, team sources said. 

Taibu injured his right shoulder while leaping to take a bouncer, and left the field after tea. Brendan Taylor took over the wicketkeeping gloves in Taibu?s absence. (Reuters)

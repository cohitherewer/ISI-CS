 Jeev makes the cut

Hiroshima: Jeev Milkha Singh recovered from a poor start to finish at three-over 74, but still made the cut at the Woodone Open here on Friday. 

The Chandigarh golfer, who is currently seventh on the Asian Tour money standings, had a first round card of two-under 69 to be one-over 143 for two rounds and is tied for the 50th place. 

In the second round, the 33-year-old Jeev, starting from the tenth tee, bogeyed the 12th and 13th and added one more dropped shot on the 18th to turn in three-over. 

On the second nine, Jeev had birdies on the second and seventh, but then just as he seemed to recover, he bogeyed the par-4 eighth. He needed 28 putts to complete the round, the same as in the first round. 

Atwal tied 73rd 

Meanwhile in Illinois, Arjun Atwal had a roller coaster round with six birdies, three bogeys and one double bogey to finish at one-under 70 in the first round of the $4 million John Deere Classic. 

Atwal, who has made the cut in last 11 starts on US Tour, is now lying tied 73rd, and will need to shoot an under-par round to have a chance of keeping his streak going. 

Daniel Chopra, with five birdies and three bogeys was two-under for the round, and he was tied 53rd.

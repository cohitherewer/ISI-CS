 Armaan misses podium 

Pattaya: Indias Armaan Ebrahim failed to make a podium finish in the Formula BMW Asia series here Sunday. It was a day of mixed fortunes for him, a mistake on the chicane forcing him to retire in the first race and managing to hold on to the position he began to finish fourth in the second. 

The challenge of the 15-year-old, driving for Koreas E-Rain, in round five got over in no time as he failed to control the car on the chicane in the second lap itself and after bouncing over the kerb spun and came to a standstill. 

Armaan, who created history last month in Malaysia by becoming the first rookie driver to win a race, committed himself too early and later admitted: I made a mistake on the chicane by hitting too hard on the kerb. The car was airborne and spun and just stopped. 

Team Meritus claimed all the three podium spots with Hamed al Fardan Baharin taking the chequered flag with a time of 20:56:860. 

Michael Tony Patrizi of Australia and Charlie-ro Charlez of Malaysia finished second and third, respectively. 

Another small error denied Armaan a podium finish in the second race. Local hope Robert Boughey of Team Meritus crashed on the first chicane and the race had to be restarted. Armaan passed Patrizi on the first corner but could only maintain the position for just two laps before surrendering the initiative. 

The Indian overlooked the approaching Patrizi and in an effort to close in on Fardan, ran a bit wide on the first corner on only lap four allowing the Australian to pass him on the ensuing straight. 

Armaans teammate and championship leader Salman Rashid al Khalifa, who had also crashed out of the first race, led from start to finish to complete his third win in six rounds and maintain his overall position with 87 points. Fardan and Patrizi took the second and third spot. (PTI)

Calcutta: Here comes another gimmick from East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick. This time, for reasons best known to him, Bhowmick will not sit on the bench as a coach. 

Instead he will be in the stands and instruct his wards and deputy Bikash Panji from there in their season-opener against Ever-Ready Association in the Premier Division on home turf Sunday. 

The natural fallout was the skipping of Saturdays pre-match media conference as well. He deputed two seniors ? Debjit Ghosh and Tushar Rakshit ? to tackle the media. Both, religiously, echoed the same words that Bhowmick uses before any match, though in a more subdued manner. 

We will experiment in this league and use it as a launching pad for the National League and other important tournaments ahead in the season, Debjit said. We have many new faces and they will have to learn to feel the pressure of donning the red-and-gold colours, Tushar supplemented. 

According to these two trusted lieutenants of Bhowmick, there will be no extra pressure on them on the first day of the season. 

We will take it as any other match, they stated. Both lamented that they didnt get enough time to train with the ball, though their preparation without the ball was better than the last season. 

According to team sources R. C. Prakash will be the lone striker in their 3-5-1-1 formation. Jatin Bist or Covan Lawrence may play the supporting role. East Bengal will be without the services of any foreigner in their lung-opener. 

On the other hand, Ever-Ready coached by India under-19 coach Aloke Mukherjee, will not look for any miracles on Sunday. 

We just want play to our best of the abilities and then the result will follow, Mukherjee said.

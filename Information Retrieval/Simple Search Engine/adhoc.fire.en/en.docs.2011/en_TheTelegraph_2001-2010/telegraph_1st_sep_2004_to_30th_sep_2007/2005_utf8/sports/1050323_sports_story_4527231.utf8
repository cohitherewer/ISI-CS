 Outsiders to the fore 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Favourites were expected to dominate proceedings on Tuesday. But the 37 runners, who made the seven-event race-card, manoeuvred a 5-2 score against the public-choices. Therefore, it hardly came as a surprise when the jackpot pool paid handsome dividends of over Rs 45,000 on each of the two tickets.

 Rank-outsider Sea Legend?s narrow victory in the first leg of the pool, the 1,200m Eastern Command Cup, was mainly instrumental for most of the tickets going for a toss. Less fancied Daniel David?s winners ? Rasalas, in the afternoon?s main event, the 1,600m Grand Annual Handicap, and La Fantasie, in the Madras Race Club Cup, also worked against punters? interest. Daniel?s two winners were partnered by Imran Chisty who could have increased his tally of winners had saddles of Exotic Strides and Primaticcio not slipped. Nevertheless, Eglevsky and Terrific Dancer were the only two favourites who delivered the goods in their respective events.

 Gibbs, Boje criticised

Sydney: Herchelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje have been lambasted for their constant refusal to tour India on flimsy grounds by noted columnist Peter Roebuck in a Sydney daily. 

In, his column Roebuck described them as refugees from justice and said they should not be invited to play anywhere else in the world. By refusing to tour India, Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje have put themselves in an unsustainable position. At face value they are refugees from justice, he wrote in the column. 

It is not a minor matter, a parking ticket or an unpaid bill. Their names cropped up during the investigation into the match-fixing saga that devastated the game and ended the careers of several national captains, he said. 

Gibbs and Boje, co-accused with Hansie Cronje in the match-fixing case of 2000, are not touring India with the South African team as they were not given any assurance that they would not be arrested. 

It is hard to avoid thinking the act of seeking such a commitment was patronising to the host country. India is not some two penny-half penny nation whose justice system is run along the lines of a Kangaroo Court. It is an advanced democracy, with a proper judicial structure and a free press. It is a member of the Commonwealth and a respected cricketing force. (PTI)

 Vaughan: We can make history

Centurion: South Africa captain Graeme Smith may gamble in the fifth Test to try and avoid a first home series defeat by England for 30 years. 

The tourists, who last won a series in South Africa in 1964-65, need just a draw after taking a 2-1 lead by winning the fourth Test earlier this week. 

?Winning is the only option, losing or drawing means nothing,? Smith told a news conference on Thursday. 

Smith suffered a concussion after being hit by a ball at the team?s practice session during the third Test. He has been declared fit to play. 

England captain Michael Vaughan knows the attitude of his team will be crucial in the final Test. 

?We have to go out and play positively and try to win the match,? Vaughan said on Thursday. ?We have a real goal to aim for ? we can make history.? (Reuters)

 Alok falls to Chinese

New Delhi: National champion Alok Kumar put up a strong performance but failed to get the better of Chinese Ding Junhui in the semi-finals of the Asian Open invitational snooker meet in Shinjhen, China. Alok, also the reigning Asian champion, went down 2-4 Tuesday night, according to information received here. 

The 18-year-old Ding, the first Asian to win a professional ranking tournament in ten years, registered breaks of 115, 105, 52 and 64 to quell the challenge of his experienced opponent. 

Alok will face Thai Paithoon Phonbun in the third place play-off on Thursday.

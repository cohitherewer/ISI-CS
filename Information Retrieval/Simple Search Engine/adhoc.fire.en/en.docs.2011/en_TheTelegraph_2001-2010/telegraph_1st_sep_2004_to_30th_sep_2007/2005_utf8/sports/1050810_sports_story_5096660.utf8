 Sourav salutes Sanath

 - Lankan sets the pace best, says former India captain 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sanath has been a terrific performer in both forms, says Sourav 

Colombo: Till a week ago, the 10,000 ODI runs club just had two members (Sachin Tendulkar, Inzamam-ul Haq). Now, with Sanath Jayasuriya quickly following Sourav Ganguly, it has doubled. 

Others, too, will join... However, for now, the club remains elitist, remarked Sourav, during a tete-a-tete with The Telegraph. 

Applauding Jayasuriya, he added: Sanath has been a terrific performer in both forms... Of course, its in the ODIs that he gave the openers slot a new dimension 1995-96 onwards... 

In Souravs opinion, the pace at which Jayasuriya scores is his USP. 

Thats why the run-rate remains healthy... Others try to match him, but Sanath does it best... Plus, he helps himself to the maximum whenever width is offered. 

Pointing out Jayasuriya was a prime target whenever he captained against Sri Lanka, Sourav said: Seeing his back early gave relief, for Sanath has a liking for Indian bowling. 

Sourav, who expects Jayasuriya to play till the 2007 World Cup, also lauded about his commitment. 

Even a dislocated shoulder couldnt deter him in the tri-series opener... And, the way he batted that evening (in Dambulla)... Thats education... 

Asked to pick a Jayasuriya shot which appealed to him most, Sourav chose his flick off the pads.

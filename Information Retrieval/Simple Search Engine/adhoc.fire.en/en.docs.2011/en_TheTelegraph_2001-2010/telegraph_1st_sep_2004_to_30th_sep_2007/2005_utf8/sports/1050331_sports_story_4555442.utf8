 Aussies now focus on Ashes

 McGrath wants wicket No. 500 at Lord?s 

Sydney: Leg-spinner Shane Warne is so confident of Australia claiming another Ashes series win that he can?t wait to get to England and start getting some practice in the local conditions. 

Warne was recovering Wednesday after Australia?s 2-0 Test series win over New Zealand and will next week leave his Melbourne home for England, where he?ll lead Hampshire in the county competition. 

He will be joined in England by middle-order batsman Simon Katich and possibly fast bowler Brett Lee. 

Australia?s touring squad will be announced next week. 

Glenn McGrath took 18 wickets from three Tests in New Zealand and has claimed 499 in his Test career, one short of becoming only the fourth bowler to join the 500 club. He wants to take wicket No. 500 at Lord?s in the first Ashes Test starting July 21. 

Warne, who leads the all-time standings with 583, will be hoping to get his 600th Test wicket in England. 

The bulk of the Australian squad will have nine weeks of rest before regrouping in Brisbane in late May for a pre-Ashes camp. 

Captain Ricky Ponting, who smashed 82 from 82 balls Tuesday as Australia clinched the third Test in Auckland by nine wickets and a day to spare, said rest was probably the best Ashes preparation for his line-up, which has been touring since last October. 

?We?ve pushed ourselves hard enough,? he said. ?We?ve maintained some really high standards that we set for ourselves.? 

Although Ponting thought England would be harder to beat than it had been in recent Ashes series. 

England is ?the No. 2-ranked Test team now and have played some excellent cricket of late,? he said. ?I think both our sides are matched up particularly well, so once we hit England we?re very confident that if we?ve got everyone fit and we play somewhere near our best that we?re going to be very competitive right through that series.? 

Australia has held the Ashes since regaining the oldest prize in cricket in 1989. The 2005 series in England will feature five Test matches. (AP)

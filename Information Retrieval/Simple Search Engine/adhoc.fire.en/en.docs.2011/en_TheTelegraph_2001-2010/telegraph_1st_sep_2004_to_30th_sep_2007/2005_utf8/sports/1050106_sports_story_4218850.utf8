 Argentina send Russia packing

 Guillermo Coria in action in Perth on Wednesday 

Perth: Top seeds Russia suffered a humiliating early exit from the Hopman Cup on Wednesday as a leg-weary Marat Safin was beaten for the second time in three days in their 1-2 defeat by Argentina. 

The world No. 4, beaten by Tommy Haas in Russia?s opening match defeat by Germany, lost 7-6, 6-1 to Guillermo Coria and Argentina wrapped up victory when Coria and Gisela Dulko beat Safin and Anastasia Myskina 6-2, 6-0 in the mixed doubles. 

?It just wasn?t my day,? Safin said. ?I wasn?t fast enough, not sharp enough. ?Gisela was even returning my serve very well which was kind of embarrassing. But I?ll have to live with that and get better for the Australian Open. 

Myskina had earlier beaten Dulko 6-2, 6-1 to put Russia ahead, but Safin?s rustiness and some fine play by the Argentine pair secured victory for the fourth seeds and left Russia unable to qualify for final. 

The winner of Thursday?s match between Argentina and Germany will decide who progresses to the final as the winner of group A of the eight-team round-robin event. 

Suffering with jet-lag when he was beaten by Haas, Safin had been hoping for an improved performance, but with Coria looking close to his best, the Russian struggled to make an impression. A few bullet-like backhands were the only signs of the Safin who climbed back to number four in world rankings after a superb 2004. But his legs appeared heavy and his forehand offered up a host of errors. 

Once Coria had taken the first set 7-4 in the tiebreak, the spirit seemed to drain from Safin and the Argentine romped through the second set to clinch victory in 70 minutes. 

Earlier, Myskina was on top form as she brushed aside Dulko in just 56 minutes. (Reuters)

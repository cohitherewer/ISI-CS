 Batsmen worry Inzy

 - Jayawardene set to strengthen Asia XI line-up

 Inzamam feels bowlers did very well in first game 

Durban: Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene is set to strengthen the Asia XI line-up for the second Afro-Asian Cup one-day International against Africa XI in Durban on Saturday. 

Asia were bowled out for 196 in Centurion on Wednesday to lose the first match by two runs. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq said on Friday that the batting would need to improve drastically if the visitors were to win the series, which concludes with a third match in Durban on Sunday. 

The bowlers did very well in the first game and 199 was not a big total to achieve, but the batsmen are not doing well. Hopefully tomorrow they will bat better, Inzamam said. 

Asia XI coach Rumesh Ratnayake believes the arrival of Jayawardene would be a boost. 

Mahela is in town and he will strengthen the middle-order, Ratnayake said. 

Asia have two key injury worries to consider before choosing their team. 

Spinner Muttiah Muralidharan is the chief concern having been substituted after bowling nine overs in the opening match. 

Murali aggravated a groin injury in the first match, which is one of the reasons he did not bat. But we will have another look at him on Saturday morning because it is very important he plays, Ratnayake said. 

Wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara is also doubtful owing to a hamstring strain. 

With Graeme Smith, banned for slow over rate only eligible to play on Sunday, Shaun Pollock continues to be the captain. 

Pollock agreed that the standard of matches have not been on a par but hoped it would improve. 

I think the series was put together quickly, it was a bit rushed. But both the teams played hard, and after the first game it has been very exciting, he said. 

The skill factor has not been up to the level it should have been but thats probably because the teams have not played for quite sometime, Pollock said.

 Pankaj Advani clinches grand double

 - IBSF MEET 

- National champion creates history by winning both points and time format crowns 

 Pankaj Advani 

New Delhi: National champion Pankaj Advani became the first player to complete a grand double by winning both the points format and the time format titles in the IBSF world billiards championship at Qawra, Malta, as reported in Monday?s Late City Edition. 

The 19-year-old, who won the points format title defeating compatriot Devendra Joshi 6-2 in the final on Wednesday, showed he had the patience and the skills to beat the best in the longer format, as he got rid of former champion Geet Sethi 2242-1717 in a thrilling six hour final, according to infor- mation received here late on Sunday. 

This was only the second time that the time format and points format championships were held together and Advani created history by winning both the crowns. 

In 2002 at Sydney, Australia, Ashok Shandilya, whom Advani beat in the semi-finals, had won the points format title, while Mike Russel of England got the better of Sethi in the time format. 

Advani is also the second cueist in the world to have won both the world billiards and snooker title after Paul Mifsud of Malta. 

While Mifsud won the snooker title in 1985, 86 and bagged the billiards crown in 1979, Advani clinched the snooker championship in 2003 in China. He also holds the Asian billiards crown. 

For Sethi ? who has won the amateur crown thrice and the professional title four times so far ? this was a third successive defeat in the final of the IBSF world championship. 

Sethi, who bagged the title in 1985, 87 and 2001, had lost the summit clash in 2002 against Russel and then went down to Lee Lagan of England in the points format final in 2003 at Hyderabad. The championship was not held last year. 

This was also the second win for Advani over his highly-rated opponent in a week as he had defeated the seven-time world champion in the quarter final of the points format after twice coming from behind. 

Advani began on a confident note in the final as he took a 616-546 lead in the opening two hours session, but Sethi came back strongly to put pressure on his opponent with some useful breaks after the breather. 

It was a battle of nerves thereafter as Advani once again proved that he has the ability to raise the bar under pressure as he compiled a break of 334 points to stretch his lead to 390 points around the half way mark. 

But the experienced Sethi was not the one to give up and the 44-year-old pounced on an opportunity to come back to the table with a comfortable ball position and compiled a break of 157 to reduce the margin. 

However, Advani had some different ideas as he registered an unfinished break of 155 to go into the second breather with a lead of 1374-1057. 

Going into the final session, it was very important for the youngster to get a good start and he did precisely that as he opened up a 700 point lead within half an hour after the restart.

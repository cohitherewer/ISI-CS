 Pietersen looks set for Ashes debut

London: South African-born batsman Kevin Pietersen looks set to make his Ashes debut for England at Lords later this month after impressing selectors. 

England chairman of selectors David Graveney admitted Pietersen had put forward irresistible case for a place in the Ashes team against Australia, but said the selectors have yet to make up their minds on the starting 11. 

Kevin is very close, Graveney said. I wish I had a pound for every time I had been asked whether he was going to be picked but he has stated an irresistible case with the way he has been playing. 

But we must not forget, Graham Thorpe has been a class act for a number of years. It is a difficult problem for the selectors, but it is also a nice one. 

Pietersen stated his case after hitting 91 not out in his first ODI against the Aussies in Bristol last month, following a series of sensational one-day performances in South Africa in the winter. 

The 24-year-olds Test claims could prove difficult to resist even though Surreys Thorpe, his chief rival for a place in England captain Michael Vaughans side, is one of the few players to enjoy previous success against Australia.

Wellington: Australia captured three late wickets to restrict New Zealand to 199 for five on a slow opening day in the third and final Test in Auckland on Saturday. 

The Black Caps, 0-1 down in the series, were cruising at 179 for two at Eden Park only for Hamish Marshall to be trapped leg before wicket by Shane Warne for 76 before captain Stephen Fleming (65) played a ball from Michael Kasprowicz on to his stumps. 

Jason Gillespie then collected his second wicket when Lou Vincent (two) shouldered arms to a delivery that clipped his off stump. 

Marshall, who recorded his maiden Test hundred in the series opener in Christchurch, continued his excellent form while Fleming rediscovered his touch after making 36 runs in his previous four innings. 

Fleming dropped himself down from opener to number four to allow Marshall?s identical twin brother James to go in first on his Test debut, marking the first time identical twins had played a Test together. 

James Marshall made a promising start to his international career with a stylish 29 that featured three boundaries. 

He lost fellow opener Craig Cumming when he was trapped leg before by Gillespie for five after failing to offer a shot to a ball that darted back sharply from outside off stump. 

The twins steadied the innings with a 38-run stand before James edged Glenn McGrath to Matthew Hayden in the gully, handing the Australian his 493rd Test wicket. 

Fleming and Hamish Marshall added 126 for the third wicket, batting through the entire middle session. 

Hamish batted nearly four and a half hours before falling with the total on 179. Fleming followed four runs later and Vincent was dismissed with the score on 194. 

Although McGrath claimed only one wicket on Saturday, the lanky paceman returned extraordinary figures of one for 20 off 24 overs, including 17 maidens.

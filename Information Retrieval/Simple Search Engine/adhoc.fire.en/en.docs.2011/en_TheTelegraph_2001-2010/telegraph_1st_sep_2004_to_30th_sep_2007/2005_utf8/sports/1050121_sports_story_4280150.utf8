 Schett calls it a day

Melbourne: With tears welling up in her eyes, Barbara Schett bowed out of top level tennis at the Australian Open on Thursday, ending the career as the most successful female player in Austria?s history. 

The 28-year-old, who announced her decision to quit midway through last year, was sent into retirement by 26th seed Daniela Hantuchova, who saw her off with a 6-4, 6-0 second round victory. 

Schett won three WTA singles titles and reached the US Open quarter finals in 1999. 

Fighting back tears at a media conference, Schett said she had been surprised how emotional she had been against Hantuchova. 

?(I was) not very emotional until she had match point,? she said. 

?Then suddenly I had tears in my eyes. I was like, ?Oh, my God. Where does that come from now?? 

Schett said she was quitting because she was not enjoying the game any more. 

Schett also won 10 doubles titles and amassed more than ?3 million in prize money.

 Back-up flame needed to light torch

Olympia: Organisers were forced to use a back-up flame in the torch-lighting ceremony for the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics on an overcast Sunday. 

Greek sun god Apollo did not hear the prayers of high priestess Theodora Siarkou, an actress, who had to light the torch from a replica ancient pot which contained the flame from Saturdays dress rehearsal, instead of using the concave steel mirror to focus the suns rays. 

The ceremony in the temple of Hera, a few metres away from the stadium that hosted the ancient Olympics 25 centuries ago, marked the start of the torch relay that will pass through Greece and Italy before lighting the Games cauldron in Turin on Feb. 10. 

Siarkou, accompanied by 17 priestesses, theatrically emerged from an olive grove and lit the official Turin Games torch. 

In front of a small crowd of officials in the cypress-ringed site where the heart of the modern Games founder Pierre de Coubertin is buried, Greek polevaulter Costas Filippidis lifted the torch and an olive branch and started his short run as the first of the 534 runners who will cover 2,006 km across Greece. 

The flame will pass through most of the countrys skiing resorts before being handed over to Italians on December 6 in Athens. 

On December 8, the flame will leave Rome on a cross-country tour that will include rides on gondolas and in a Ferrari car. The torch will be carried by 10,001 bearers before the Olympic cauldron is lit during the opening ceremony. 

The torch will also briefly travel to Slovenia, Switzerland, France and Austria.

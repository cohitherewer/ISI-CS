 London: England defender Ashley Cole has signed a one-year contract extension with Arsenal, the player?s agents Stellar Group said on Monday.

 The deal will take the left-back through to 2008 and follows a highly-publicised ?tapping up? affair in which Cole, Chelsea and their manager Jose Mourinho were fined last month by the Premier League. Cole, whose side won the FA Cup but lost their championship title to Chelsea last season, said in a statement: ?I am now looking forward to another successful season. We are all determined to regain the Premiership title and I can?t wait for the season to start now.? 

 London: Chelsea?s former Spanish midfielder Enrique De Lucas is suing the English champions for more than ? 2.5 million ($4.37 million) after they terminated his contract in 2003.

 De Lucas, who began a London High Court action on Monday, is seeking damages in unpaid wages, bonuses, appearance fees, accommodation and other expenses, including English language tuition. The 27-year-old?s move to English football in 2002 was a complex one involving Spanish club Deportivo Alaves. 

 Paris: Olympique Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas says Chelsea will have to pay 45 million euros if the English champions want their Ghana midfielder Michael Essien. Aulas, who had previously said the player was not for sale, signalled a U-turn by the French champions in comments to a French sports daily on Monday.

 ?Chelsea had accepted the price Liverpool asked for Steven Gerrard (45 million euros). I told them ?Mike? would leave only at that price. As for now, Chelsea have refused,? Aulas was quoted as saying.

 Aulas has also given Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon a deadline to make an offer for the sought-after midfielder, who has also been linked with Arsenal. 

 Rio de Janeiro: The Brazilian championship claimed two more coaching victims at the weekend as Paulo Bonamigo left Palmeiras and Paulo Campos parted company with Paysandu after their teams lost home matches.

 Vasco da Gamas Dario Lourenco is expected to join the casualty list after 1-0 defeat to arch-rivals Flamengo left his team mired in the relegation zone.

 Bonamigo became the third coach this year to leave former South American champions Palmeiras when he announced his resignation in the changing room after a 2-1 home defeat by Fortaleza. Bonamigo, who had been in charge for only 16 matches after replacing Candinho, was insulted throughout the second half by Palmeiras supporters. Paulo Campos also fell victim to fan pressure after Paysandu were beaten 2-1 by Cruzeiro. 

 Beijing: NBA star Yao Ming has expressed his wish to invite Chinese children orphaned by AIDS to watch the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008.

 ?I saw a boy wearing clothes with the Olympic Games logo. I hope to invite them to watch the event in 2008,? the Houston Rockets centre said when visiting a group of 30 children in east China?s Anhui province on Sunday. Yao wiped off Xiao Ding?s tears when the 14-year-old kid cried that nobody dared to play with him after his parents were found to have been infected with HIV when they illegally sold blood.

Nottingham: Andrew Flintoff scored a swashbuckling century to revive England in the fourth Ashes Test on Friday before devastating swing bowling by Matthew Hoggard helped reduce the world champions to 99 for five at the end of play on day two. 

Flintoff (102) put on 177 with Geraint Jones (85) for the sixth wicket to pile up 477 on the second day at Trent Bridge before Hoggard rediscovered his form to rip through the Australian top order. 

To rub in their misery, Michael Clarke was dismissed with the final ball of the day by Steve Harmison. 

Simon Katich was not out 20, with Adam Gilchrist next in with another 179 needed to avoid the follow on. The five-match series stands at 1-1 and England have to win it to regain the Ashes. 

England have dominated the last two Tests and the trend continued at Trent Bridge. 

At one stage Hoggard and Simon Jones took three wickets, all leg before, for two runs in 11 balls of high-class bowling to reduce Australia to 22 for three in the final session. Hoggard and Jones set things up with four overs for a single run before Matthew Hayden prodded forward and was trapped in front by an inswinger for seven. 

Ponting followed for one six balls later to another Jones inswinger and Damien Martyn made a single before Hoggard sent him back. Television replays suggested Martyn got an inside edge first, which was harsh as he was also given out in the same way in the third Test. 

Hoggard later removed Justin Langer for 27 when the opener gloved an inswinger via his thigh to the diving Ian Bell at short leg, and Harmisons wicket at the close, another leg before decision, put the perfect gloss on Englands day. 

It was a timely return to form for Hoggard. Failing to find any swing in the first three Tests, his place in the side looked in jeopardy. But he received a huge ovation on Friday evening after taking three for 32 in a marathon 11-over spell. Flintoff had received even louder applause after his 102, his fifth hundred in Tests and first against Australia. It spanned three hours and 20 minutes and was buttressed by Joness intelligent batting. 

They make an odd couple, Flintoff dwarfing his teammate, but they like batting together, Flintoff battering and the England wicketkeeper scampering. 

The game had looked in the balance at the resumption, England on 229 for four and Australia scenting a chance. 

There would be only one wicket before lunch, however, Kevin Pietersen caught behind off Brett Lee for 45. When he was out in the fifth over of the day it was 241 for five and the door was ajar. Flintoff slammed it shut. For several overs the all rounder lived dangerously, searching for the middle of his heavy bat. 

It was Jones who settled things down, blocking the good balls and leaving the rest. When Lee overpitched, though, Jones sent the ball skimming though extra cover.

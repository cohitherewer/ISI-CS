 Atwal makes the cut

Milwaukee: Arjun Atwal maintained form with a three-under 69 for a four-under 140, making his 12th cut this season from as many starts at the US Bank golf championships of Milwaukee Friday. 

He is currently tied 31st, as rain interrupted the second round. 

Atwal started at one-under, but bogeyed immediately, before a birdie on the sixth. 

On the back nine, Atwal had a birdie on the tenth. Then it was a 13-foot putt for birdie on the 13th and one more birdie on the 18th took him to three-under for the day and four-under for 36 holes. 

Ben Crane carded a 5-under 65 to maintain his lead. 

Cranes 13-under 127 total is two shots better than Scott Verplank and four better than Tommy Armour III and Chris Smith. Verplank had to play 32 holes Friday and he carded a 64-65 for an 11-under 129. (PTI)

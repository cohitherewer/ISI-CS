 Sharapova first Russian woman to be No. 1 

Moscow: Maria Sharapova became the first Russian woman to reach world No. 1 on Monday when she officially replaced injured American Lindsay Davenport at the top of the WTA Entry Points Ranking System. 

Although Sharapova was unable to repeat her 2004 Wimbledon triumph this year, she has stalked Lindsay Davenport for months before finally supplanting the US veteran atop the rankings. 

Sharapova had appeared on course to secure the top spot a week ago, needing only to reach the semi-finals at the WTA Tour event in Carson, California. 

Her hopes then were dashed when a strained pectoral muscle began to bother her, forcing her to withdraw before her quarter final match. 

But with Davenport also idle, it did not stop the glamorous Russian from grabbing the coveted top spot days before the US Open draw. 

To be honest, I was surprised I was No. 1 up until today, Davenport said on Sunday as she prepared to compete in the US Open tune-up in New Haven. 

Belgian Kim Clijsters, who defeated compatriot Justine Henin-Hardenne in the Toronto final on Sunday, climbed four places to fourth in the rankings, behind now No. 2 Davenport and Frances Amelie Mauresmo. 

Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, struggling as her defence of her US Open title looms, fell a spot to fifth ahead of compatriot Elena Dementieva. Henin-Hardenne dropped two places to seventh, while Wimbledon champion Serena Williams fell one spot to eighth. 

To finish off the top 10, Russian Nadia Petrova and American Venus Williams swapped places, the former stepping up to ninth. 

Meanwhile, Indias Sania Mirza stayed at No. 50. 

On the ATP rankings list, Roger Federer of Switzerland remained No. 1, ahead of Spaniard Rafael Nadal and Aussie Lleyton Hewitt. (AGENCIES)

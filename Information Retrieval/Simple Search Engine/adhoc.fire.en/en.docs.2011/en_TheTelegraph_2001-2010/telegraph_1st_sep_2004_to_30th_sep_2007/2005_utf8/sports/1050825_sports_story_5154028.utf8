Calcutta: Barely a week has elapsed since Mohun Bagan got the better of East Bengal in the first derby clash of the season, but the arch-rivals are already thinking about the next one. 

As Mohun Bagan are slated to host Subhas Bhowmicks side again in the return leg of the CFL Premier Division on September 3, both teams are keen to ensure that their resources are in full steam. 

On Thursday, East Bengal will take on George Telegraph while Mohun Bagan face Ever-Ready, but the matches will be mere preparatory grounds for the Big Two before they cross swords. 

Bhowmick is planning to drop Debjit Ghosh and Alvito DCunha against George Telegraph. Both have been booked once and fielding them in the only match prior to the big occasion may be an unnecessary risk the coach will hardly want to explore. 

Similarly, Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta has ruled out Noel Wilson on Thursday. The midfielder twisted his left ankle during practice on the match-eve. 

Mohun Bagans seriousness about the second derby became all the more evident when Tomba Singh and Dharamjit Singh were showcaused on Wednesday after the duo failed to turn up at the practice. 

East Bengal, in fact, will be further weakened by the absence of Gurpreet Singh, R.C. Prakash and Bernard Pires through injury as well as Arun Malhotra and Jatin Bisht, who have gone to New Delhi, but would be back later this week. 

Bhowmick, though, stressed that win against George Telegraph will be his target.

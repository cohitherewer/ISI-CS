 Keane in court on assault charge

London: Manchester United and Ireland football star Roy Keane grabbed a teenage boy round the neck, swore at him and swung a punch towards his face before stopping his fist at the last minute, a British court heard Monday. 

The midfielder, who denies a charge of assault and public order offence, clashed with the 16-year-old student near his home in Manchester last year, Trafford magistrates? court was told. Keane, 33, was walking his dogs when the boy rode past on a moped with a friend and beeped his horn to acknowledge the star. 

As the moped passed, Keane ? who was then injured ? swung out with his walking stick, prompting the 16-year-old to turn around and make a crude hand gesture at the player. In September 2004, the pair were visiting a friend near Keane?s home when they were approached by the sportsman. 

The teenager told police he was sitting on the moped when he noticed Keane walking towards him. ?Then he (Keane) said: ?Why did you call me a wanker??? The teenager said he replied: ?Because you nearly hit me; you swung at me with your walking stick.? The boy went on to add, ?He walked up to me and he was being a bit aggressive. The next thing he did was swing at my face with his right fist. He said, ?that?s nearly hitting you?. I flinched backwards.? 

The trial was expected to last two days. (AFP)

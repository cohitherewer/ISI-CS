The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chingoka satisfied with Taibu captaincy

A STAFF REPORTER

 Streak is assured of only his place in the team 

Calcutta: Heath Streak has returned to the Zimbabwe fold, but regaining captaincy remains distant, not before end-August, in the least. Till such time, Tatenda Taibu is contracted to lead the national side. 

Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) chairman Peter Chingoka, here at the invitation of the BCCI for this series vs Pakistan, made it clear Saturday that the board keeps its options open for Streak as skipper. At the same time, though, he observed that not only is Taibu contracted till August-end, but that the ZC is ?satisfied? with his captaincy so far. 

That leaves Streak to prove himself a leader, all over again, after his fall-out with the board in April. On Tuesday, Stuart Carlisle, Trevor Gripper, Craig Wishart also returned to the fold. 

The next international engagement of the country is when New Zealand visit them in September. While Chingoka said that all who returned do remain good for selection, no captaincy-change issue is yet on the horizon. 

Chingoka said Taibu, under the coaching of former Caribbean allrounder Phil Simmons, is doing a ?pretty good job?. ?They visited Bangladesh and we are satisfied the with the young boys? performances,? the Zimbabwean said. 

Chingoka didn?t also rule out the chance of the Flower brothers? (Andy and Grant) return in the near future. ?They haven?t shown any interest till date, but if they are willing they will also be re-instated,? Chingoka said. 

Chingoka, who said he wants to give the ZC a professional look, said during a break in the second Test at the Eden Saturday: ?We will have to set a guideline to prevent players from moving out and coming in frequently.? 

Chingoka said he hoped all rebels would return. ?We now have 53 contracted players and the national squad will be selected from that,? Chingoka said. 

The ZC chairman also informed that efforts are on to divide African countries into four zones (East, West, North and South) and hold an inter-zonal tournament. ?Funds, though, remain a problem,? he said.

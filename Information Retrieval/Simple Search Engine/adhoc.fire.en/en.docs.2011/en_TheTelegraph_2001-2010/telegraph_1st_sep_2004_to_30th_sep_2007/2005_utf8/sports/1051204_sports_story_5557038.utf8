The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Day III may see delayed start

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Hope gave way to uncertainty again. As the sun finally made its way out from behind the cloud cover for a brief while on Saturday morning, there was optimism about the series unfolding on the third day of the Test. 

But the optimism gave way to despair when a fresh spell of downpour lashed the city in the evening. Chances of a start ? delayed if it does at all happen ? on Sunday is possible only if the conditions dont deteriorate further. 

The met forecast that Cyclone Baaz has weakened was good news to the organisers. 

The second days play was called off at 1.15 pm after umpires Daryl Harper and Mark Benson made a survey of the outfield and ruled the soggy conditions along the square of the wicket on both sides made any action impossible. Match Ref- eree Clive Lloyd was also present. 

Even the players did not come to the ground on Saturday. It was only when the umpires were making a survey of the conditions that Greg Chappell and Rahul Dravid arrived. 

Expressing disappointment, the Team India captain said that the circumstances were tough for the players. 

Everyone remains pretty keyed up before a Test? A lot of nervous energy builds up. But this sort of situation tends to slow down the adrenalin flow. Its difficult to adjust, but as pros we should be prepared to tackle any situation, Dravid explai- ned. 

The Indians had to remain content with a gym session in the afternoon. 

There is no worry about the wicket, though. The covers were removed for sometime around noon and there was no sign of any dampness.

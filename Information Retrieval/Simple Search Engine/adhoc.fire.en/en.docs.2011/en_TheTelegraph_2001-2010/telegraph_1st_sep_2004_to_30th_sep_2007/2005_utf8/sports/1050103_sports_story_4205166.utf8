 Bangladesh name squad

Dhaka: Bangladeshi selectors added a spinner and dropped two pacers from the squad that just played against India to face Zimbabwe in the first Test next week in Chittagong, a Bangladesh Cricket Board official said on Sunday. 

Pacer Nazmul Hossain and Seamer Mushfiqur Rahman were left out in favour of left-hand spinner Enamul Haque in a 13-member squad led by Habibul Bashar, chief selector Faruque Ahmed said. 

The first of two Tests starts on Thursday. It will be Zimbabwe?s first Test series since a boycott by most of their senior players in May.

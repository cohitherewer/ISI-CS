The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A tale of two Rahuls

A STAFF REPORTER

They say what?s in a name? But if you meet Rahul Bose and ask this, you may get a different impression. The actor ? Mr Iyer of Mr and Mrs Iyer ? paid a surprise visit to the Eden on Saturday when Rahul Dravid was batting, just before lunch. When, having recognised him, some people started cheering ?Rahul, Rahul?, others got a bit confused as to how the adulation meant for the man in the middle suddenly got veered towards the man on the stand. 

The actor, however, kept a cool composure, gladly responding to calls of Mr Iyer and ?dancing in the chance?, taking a cue from one of his one-liners in the film Jhankar Beats. 

 ?I love Rahul?s batting,? Rahul ? Rahul Bose to be 

 proper ? said smilingly. 

 Cheering Team India

 Their rivalry in the football field is something 

 you?ll never get tired discussing. East Bengal and Mohun 

 Bagan hardly see eye to eye with each other. 

But when it comes to watching an international cricket match at Eden Gardens, things look vastly different. 

The ongoing Test is no exception either. Several officials of the arch-rival clubs have been visiting the stadium daily and jointly cheering for Team India. 

There are, of course, few pinches for Mohun Bagan?s current situation, but it has never come in the way of their camaraderie for the game of cricket. 

 ?We?re watching cricket, nothing else, please,? said 

 one East Bengal official on Saturday.

 Golden Moment 

 For many die-hard Sachin supporters it may not be 

 the right time, but Steve Bucknor was felicitated again 

 and that was very much on the cards. The International Cricket 

 Council (ICC) chief Ehsan Mani on Saturday presented the 

 West Indian umpire with Golden Bails during the tea-break 

 at the Eden. 

Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan and the Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary S.K. Nair were also present on the occasion.

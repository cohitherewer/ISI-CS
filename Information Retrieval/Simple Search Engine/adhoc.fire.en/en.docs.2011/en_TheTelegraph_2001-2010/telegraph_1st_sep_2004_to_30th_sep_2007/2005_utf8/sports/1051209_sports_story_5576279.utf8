 Gibbs wants to tour India

Perth: South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs said he would go ahead with touring India next year if selected, despite fears of being arrested there this season. 

Gibbs decided against touring India last month after being implicated in a match-fixing scandal with late South African captain Hansie Cronje. 

But the attacking top-order batsman said on Thursday that he would definitely tour next year, provided he had the form to be selected. 

What the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB) have told me is that it will be sorted out before the ICC Champions Trophy next year in India, Gibbs said. 

The 30-year-old said he believed he still had a lot to offer the game but had to continue to improve on striking a balance between attacking and defending as a batsman. (AFP)

 - Uefa Cup

London: Uefa Cup holders Valencia put aside poor domestic form to start the defence of their title with a 2-0 win over Steaua Bucharest in the first leg of the first knockout round on Wednesday. 

Goals in each half from Marco Di Vaio and Pablo Aimar gave the Spanish champions, one of eight teams to drop down from the Champions League into the last 32, a useful cushion to take to Romania for next week?s return leg. 

On a night when European competition resumed after the winter break, it took some Brazilian magic to light up the night?s seven ties, the samba touch bringing goals for Sporting, Shakhtar Donetsk, Schalke 04 and Ajax Amsterdam. 

Austria Vienna, who were due to host Spain?s Athletic Bilbao, could not escape the winter chill though with heavy snow forcing a postponement in the Austrian capital. 

Valencia, bidding to become the first side to win back-to-back Uefa Cups since Real Madrid in 1986, needed a workmanlike performance to overcome former European champions Steaua at the Mestalla. 

Di Vaio cracked home from eight metres late in the first half and Argentine playmaker Aimar gave Valencia some breathing space when he caught goalkeeper Vasili Khomutovski out with a curling free kick on 53 minutes. 

Victory will come as a relief to Valencia coach Claudio Ranieri, who has come under pressure after his side effectively waved goodbye to their chances of retaining the Spanish championship with a five-match winless run in the league. 

Sporting, whose Alvalade stadium in Lisbon will host the final on May 18, held on for a 2-1 win over 2002 winners Feyenoord after playing for almost 30 minutes with 10 men. 

The Portuguese side, trailing to an early Bart Goor goal, were ahead by the break thanks to midfielder Custodio and Brazilian Liedson. 

However, Custodio was sent off after 64 minutes for a second yellow and in a tempestuous finale Sporting coach Jose Peseiro was banished to the stands. 

Brazilian defender Maxwell scored late in the first half to give Dutch champions Ajax a slender 1-0 lead over AJ Auxerre. 

The Amsterdam side, missing injured Tomas Galasek, Zdenek Grygera and Wesley Sneijder plus cup-tied Greek striker Angelos Charisteas, dominated the first half. 

The pressure told eight minutes before the break when Maxwell exchanged passes with Rafael Van der Vaart before beating Fabien Cool with a fierce shot. 

The French side improved in the second half but their only chance of note came in the 52nd minute when a header by Zimbabwe striker Benjani was saved by Ajax keeper Maarten Stekelenburg. 

Twice Uefa Cup winners Parma were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Germany?s VfB Stuttgart in a scrappy encounter at the Tardini stadium. 

The Serie A strugglers went close to breaking the deadlock on the hour when Stuttgart striker Imre Szabics headed off his own line after German international goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand failed to clear a flick on from a corner. 

Shakhtar Donetsk and Bundesliga high-flyers Schalke 04 relied on their Brazilian connections in a 1-1 draw in Ukraine. 

Ailton, Bundesliga top scorer with champions Werder Bremen last season, gave Schalke a seventh-minute lead when he latched onto Ebbe Sand?s flick to fire past Czech Jan Lastuvka. 

Shakhtar, who had not played a competitive match since their long winter break began in mid-December, had strong penalty claims turned down 20 minutes from time after Rat?s cross appeared to strike a hand. 

Ailton was denied a second goal when he hit the bar after 83 minutes and Shakhtar made the most of the let off three minutes later when Brazilian Brandao converted a cross from compatriot Jadson. 

Nigerian Obiora Odita scored twice on his debut for Partizan Belgrade but Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk hit back to earn a 2-2 draw to take to the Ukraine for the second leg next week. 

Odita twice gave Partizan the lead in the first half but goals from Sergiy Nazarenko and Andriy Rusol silenced the raucous 20,000 home crowd. 

Dnipro almost grabbed a late winner when Ruslan Kostyshyn?s bobbling shot hit the post. 

New Panathinaikos coach Alberto Malesani, who led Parma to their Uefa Cup triumph in 1999, watched from the stands as the Athens side overcame Sevilla 1-0. 

Defender Loukas Vintras lashed in the only goal from the edge of the box 15 minutes from time after a corner was only half cleared. 

Malesani officially takes charge this weekend.

 Courier: New technology for US Open

London: Instant replay technology is likely to be used at next years US Open to resolve disputed line calls, tournament committee member Jim Courier said. 

Courier, a four-time Grand Slam champion, will be one of the first players to have access to hawk-eye technology at this weeks Champions Tours season-ending championship at Royal Albert Hall. 

Hawk-eye uses cameras to track a tennis balls trajectory to help check disputed line calls. Its been used in television broadcasts but not as an umpiring aid. 

Im a big proponent of hawk-eye, Courier said on Monday. I think its a wonderful addition, not only for the players, but more importantly for the fans. I think it will be such a value-add. 

Next months Hopman Cup in Perth will also allow umpires to use hawk-eye ? the first elite event to do so. Courier joined the US Open committee last year and is pushing for hawk-eye to be used by umpires at the final Grand Slam of the year.

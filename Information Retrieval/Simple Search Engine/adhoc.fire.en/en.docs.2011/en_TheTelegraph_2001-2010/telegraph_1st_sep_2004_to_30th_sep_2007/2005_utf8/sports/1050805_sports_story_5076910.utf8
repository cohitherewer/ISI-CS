 German striker banned

Berlin: Young German striker Mike Hanke has been banned for two matches by world soccer body Fifa, ruling him out of contention for Germanys first two World Cup finals ties. 

Hanke, 21, was sent off for clattering into a Mexican defender in the third-place play-off in the Confederations Cup at the end of June. The dismissal also earned him a fine of 6,500 Swiss francs. 

FIFA said in a statement it had informed the German football association (DFB) on Thursday of its disciplinary committees decision. Since Germany are hosting the 2006 World Cup, their next competitive match will be the opening game of the tournament on June 9.

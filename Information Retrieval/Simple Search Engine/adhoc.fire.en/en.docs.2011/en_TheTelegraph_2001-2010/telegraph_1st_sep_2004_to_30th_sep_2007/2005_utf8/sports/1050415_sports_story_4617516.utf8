The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Jhulan counts positives

MADHUMITA GANGULY

Calcutta: April 7, 2005. A red-letter day for women?s cricket in India. The day India upset defending champions New Zealand by 91 runs to storm into the World Cup cricket final in South Africa. 

April 10: A day of hope and anticipation for Indian eves ? and for all lovers of the game at home. A day of optimism and despair. India started the day brimming with unbridled passion, only to go down by 98 runs to Australia, the undisputed monarchs of the game ? men and women. 

?Heartbreak, yes, but many lessons have been learnt by the team,? Jhulam Goswami, member of the team who returned to the city on Thursday told The Telegraph. 

?The most important of which,? she continues ?is the ability to remain calm under pressure. And the capability to shoulder responsibility.? 

The experience ? and exposure ? was mind-boggling. And so much to be picked up by merely interacting with players of the other eight teams. 

But is it a possibility that the mere presence of the formidable Australians psyched out the Indians. ?Not at all,?? comes the prompt reply. ?In fact, having played a seven-match ODI series with them at home recently, which we lost 3-4, we were perfectly well-versed with their strategies. 

?But then, one-day cricket is all about how one plays on that particular day and, well, we were not able to deliver. Unfortunate, for we wanted to secure the Cup for the country.? 

Jhulan still remembers her excitement on the day of the men?s World Cup final. ?I almost felt I was on the field with them,? she reminisces. And the major depression which enveloped her when the Indians went down. 

But today, there is no depression. In fact, she feels, they have heralded a new era in women?s cricket in India in particular, and all women?s sports in the country, in general. 

?Like the 1983 World Cup win had triggered an interest in the game in India,? the 22-year-old says, ?I hope our achievement, too, will motivate more girls to come forward in this sport and in others.? 

A spectator at the 1997 women?s World Cup final between New Zealand and Australia at the Eden, Jhulan had promised herself to be at the other side of the fence one day. 

And she has, with promises of delivering more in future.

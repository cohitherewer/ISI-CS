The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Roger Federer left with only records to break

 - Rivals talk of the very high benchmark the No. 1 Swiss has set 

 Federer is making the rest go that extra bit versus him 

Indian Wells: After he turned pro in 1998, Roger Federer fretted about his poor track record in finals. 

But with a remarkable run of 17 consecutive wins in finals he has appeared in, the only thing the world number one worries about these days is setting new records. 

?I didn?t have a great record in the beginning of my career in finals. I lost more than I won,? said the Swiss superstar who beat Lleyton Hewitt in the final of the Indian Wells Masters series event Sunday. 

?I remember I had a good record in finals in juniors. I was very disappointed to have a bad one in the beginning of my pro career. Somehow I turned it around. To come through here is very special, especially in my first Masters series of the year.? 

Indeed, Federer earned his seventh title in his last eight tournaments dating back to the US Open. 

When Marat Safin upset Federer to win the Australian earlier this year it sparked talk of a rivalry among the top four players in the world ? Federer, Safin, Hewitt and Andy Roddick. But the 23-year-old Federer showed once again Sunday just how huge the gap is by dismantling No. 2 Hewitt in straight sets. 

A bewildered Hewitt could only stand on centre court and scratch his head after losing to Federer for the seventh straight time, including the 2004 US Open final. ?It is not like he?s doing something freaky out there,? Australian Hewitt said. ?If you want to be the best player in the world you?ve got to look at where the benchmark is and he?s set it pretty high right at the moment,? Hewitt said. 

American tennis fans have finally started to warm up to Federer and are coming to realise his Tiger Woods-like dominance is something to marvel at. 

He and Hewitt were given a standing ovation by the Indian Wells crowd after a stunning 45-shot rally in which the point was eventually won by the Aussie. 

?You don?t normally get a standing ovation,? Hewitt said. ?Maybe after you win a Davis Cup final or something. Not normally after a point, especially when both of you are not from America.? 

Still Federer was perplexed by the sight of a near empty main Indian Wells stadium when he beat red-hot Croatian Ivan Ljubicic in two tie-breakers in a night match. ?Many people left after the first set which is a little bit disappointing to see,? Federer said. ?It was kind of a quiet atmosphere. It was cold. Maybe there are kids there, elder people who usually go to bed earlier. I don?t know. 

Federer is so dominant that his opponents are having to raise the level of their games and working harder than ever to try and beat him. ?I sense that some players have changed a bit when they play me,? Federer said. ?They would serve and volley more or play more aggressive or more safe. 

?An example is Roddick, the way he played at the Wimbledon finals. I haven?t seen him be that aggressive. Then the same in Toronto and in Bangkok. It was always very different. (AFP)

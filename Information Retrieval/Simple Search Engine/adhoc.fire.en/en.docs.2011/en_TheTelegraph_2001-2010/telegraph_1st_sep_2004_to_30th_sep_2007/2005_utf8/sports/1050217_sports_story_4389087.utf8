 Indo-Pak itinerary to be finalised today

 - BCCI says it?s entitled to deal with telecast rights independently 

New Delhi/Chennai: With the series against Pakistan barely a week away, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will meet in the capital on Thursday to ratify the final itinerary and discuss a host of other issues, including awarding television rights for the high-profile series. 

The contentious issue of Ahmedabad, one of the proposed Test venues, is expected to dominate the working committee meeting after Pakistan refused to play there on security grounds. 

The board had tentatively fixed Mohali, Bangalore and Ahmedabad as venues for the three Tests while Kochi, Vishakhapatnam, Kanpur, Jamshedpur and Delhi were proposed to host the five one-dayers. 

The television rights issue is also on the agenda and BCCI is likely to take a decision on the matter Thursday. 

The board had informed the Madras High Court last week that it would not finalise the telecast rights till February 17. The undertaking was given by the BCCI counsel following a petition by Zee Telefilms Ltd. 

However, on Wednesday, BCCI told the court that it couldn?t be compelled to deal with anyone for telecast of matches in the country. 

In a counter affidavit, in response to a writ petition filed by Zee Telefilms, challenging termination of a tender for showing matches, BCCI contended that being the owner of the rights in the country, it was entitled to deal with it independently. 

Meanwhile, Thursday?s meeting will also approve the budget for the forthcoming tour of Pakistan besides ratifying the appointment of John Gloster as physiotherapist of Team India with effect from February 1. 

Also up for discussion is the report of the grounds and wicket committee regarding preparation of pitches during the Australian and South African series last year. 

It will also consider recommendations of the umpires committee which met in capital last December.

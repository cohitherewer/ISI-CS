 Sharapova pips Davenport to crown

Tokyo: Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova dashed the hopes of world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport for a record fifth victory here by wresting the singles title at the Pan Pacific Open tennis tournament on Sunday. 

The 17-year-old Russian starlet, who defeated Davenport on her way to her first Grand Slam victory at the All England Club in their only previous meeting, triumphed 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5). 

?I?m very happy of course, there?s no better way to say it, but it?s a great feeling to win, of course. Lindsay played an amazing match and it came down to the tie-breaker so it was obviously a tough match,? said Sharapova. 

The two players appeared evenly matched in the first three games. 

But Davenport, with her left thigh taped, lost the following four games in succession without even taking a game point on her serve to go down 1-6. She took a medical time out at the beginning of the second set. 

Davenport could not move well and used her big serves and fine placement to jump ahead 3-0 in the second set. She went on to keep the lead before hitting an ace to even the contest at one-all. 

Neither could break each other in the final set, with Davenport concentrating on holding her serve and saving one break point in the fourth game. 

But Sharapova fired a fine service return winner to take a 4-2 lead in the tie-breaker and then a 5-2 lead thanks to a backhand error by the American, before taking a commanding 6-2 lead. 

Davenport saved three match points but Sharapova hit a forehand winner to finish off the one-hour-48-minute contest at her fourth attempt. 

?I believed in myself. Lindsay was serving so well. I just tried to hold my serve until what happened in the tie-breaker. It was very, very close,? said Sharapova. 

?It (hitting a good serve) is very important especially on this (fast) surface. If you can serve well it puts pressure on the other girl to hold her serve and if you can break her once and keep your serve, you have a better chance to win.? 

Tokyo is a happy hunting ground for the world No. 4. She captured her first career WTA titles at the Japan Open two years ago and enjoyed her first defence of the title last season. 

It was Sharapova?s eighth career WTA singles title and she collected a winner?s check of $189,000. Her new career-high ranking of third will be announced on Monday.

 Karachi will host ODI 

 - Englands no to Test, but game for short stay in Pakistans port city 

Islamabad: England will not play a Test in Karachi during their forthcoming tour, Pakistan cricket authorities said on Tuesday. 

However, they will consider a Pakistan proposal to play two consecutive limited-overs Internationals in Karachi instead of the Test. 

England are not willing to play a Test in Karachi because of security concerns for their players, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf said after meeting England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) officials. 

Altaf met ECB director of operations John Carr and a representative of the English players association, Richard Bevan, in Lahore. 

The meeting followed a week-long inspection visit by ECB security experts Douglas Dick and Andy Allman, who went to all the proposed venues. They also met senior police and Interior Ministry officials. 

England are due to tour Pakistan from late October, playing three Tests and five one-day Internationals. 

Altaf said he had proposed two back-to-back one-day Internationals in Karachi instead of a Test. 

We have suggested to them to play back-to-back one day Internationals instead of a Test in Karachi, Altaf told reporters. They have agreed to play a one-dayer, but on our proposal of playing two one-dayers they said they will reply in 10 days, he added. 

Pakistans cricket officials had proposed Tests in Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore, with two one-day Internationals in Lahore, two in Karachi and one in Rawalpindi. 

Karachi has been shunned as a Test venue by most touring sides in recent years. 

Australia, the West Indies, South Africa and India have all refused to play Tests there since 2001 but Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have appeared in the port city. 

New Zealand were due to play a Test in Karachi in May 2002 but a suicide bomb blast outside their hotel killed 14 people including 11 French naval technicians. The New Zealand team went home without playing the Test.

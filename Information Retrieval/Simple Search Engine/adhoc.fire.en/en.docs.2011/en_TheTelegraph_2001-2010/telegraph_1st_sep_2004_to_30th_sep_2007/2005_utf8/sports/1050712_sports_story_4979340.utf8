 Top-50 benchmark for pairing with Sania

 - If and when that happens, it will? She needs to focus on singles now: Bhupathi

Bangalore: Mahesh Bhupathi said on Monday that he may consider pairing up with Sania Mirza in mixed doubles at Grand Slams after the Hyderabad tennis sensation breaks into the top 50 in singles world rankings. 

Sania is improving every month. So, she will get a ranking up to a level...We can compete at the highest level (in mixed doubles), Bhupathi told reporters here. 

Bhupathi and Frances Mary Pierce won the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon earlier this month, while Sania, currently ranked 70 in the world, lost to US Open champion and world No. 6 Svetlana Kuznetsova after a spirited fight in the second round of the ladies singles. 

But both Bhupathi and Sania stressed that at this stage of her career, she needed to focus on singles. 

It (mixed doubles) is not a priority for Sania (now). Right now, it (mixed doubles) comes only four times a year. She says she wants to break into the top 50. If and when that happens, it will (Bhupathi pairing up with Sania)...The whole country will be excited about it. Right now, she needs to focus on singles, he said. 

It will be an honour (to pair with Bhupathi in mixed doubles), added Sania. I am playing singles and doubles; mixed doubles happen four times a year. We will see; when it happens, it happens. 

Earlier, Bhupathi and Sania played an exciting 30-minute game on the streets here to promote a new WTA Tour event to be held in Calcutta in September. 

Mahesh beat Sania 5-1, 3-5, 5-3 in the best of three friendly encounter. Sania reiterated that she wanted to break into the top 50 in singles in the world by the year-end. 

I am aiming for it. Whether it happens, we have to wait and watch. (PTI)

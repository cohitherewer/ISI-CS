 Rain may play havoc again at Augusta

 - Bad weather mars 8 of 14 events in 2005 Tour so far 

 Jack Nicklaus has decided to play despite the loss of his 17-month old grandson 

Augusta: This week?s US Masters, which has already experienced a bizarre lead-in because of the weather, could end up being dominated by a water hazard more treacherous than the infamous Rae?s Creek. 

Many a Masters contender has found a watery grave at Rae?s Creek on either the par-three 12th or the par-five 13th but rainfall might play a much more significant role before the 2005 champion is decided on Sunday. 

Although the par-72 Augusta National layout was running remarkably firm and fast on Monday, the rain that has played havoc with this season?s PGA Tour was expected to move in on Thursday and Friday. 

Eight of the 14 events already completed on the 2005 Tour have been severely hit by rain, with last week?s BellSouth Classic the most recent to succumb. 

The event, despite being reduced to three rounds, was forced into a fifth day on Monday before US Masters champion Phil Mickelson eventually clinched the title at the fourth extra hole. 

Although the American left-hander was a conspicuous absentee at Augusta as he went about winning the 26th PGA Tour victory of his career at the TPC at Sugarloaf in Duluth, Georgia, he was not at all concerned. ?I was scheduled to take the day off (at Augusta), anyway,? Mickelson told reporters after edging out Rich Beem for the title. 

?I don?t have but one practice round scheduled this week (for the Masters). I?ve done all my work and preparation on the golf course so I don?t have to look forward.? 

He intends to adopt the same game plan of power combined with control at Augusta, just as he did so successfully a year ago. 

?That was the strategy and that will be the strategy this year,? he added. ?Fortunately, Augusta National sets up perfectly for right-to-left shots.? 

While the triumphant Mickelson arrived in Augusta late on Monday, the other members of the so-called ?Fab Four? had all played practice rounds there earlier in the day. 

World No. 1 Vijai Singh, second-ranked Tiger Woods and No. 3 Ernie Els made the most of blue skies and bright sunshine as around 40,000 spectators swarmed the heavily contoured, 7,290-yard course. 

Many of the players had never seen the layout in such slick condition so early in a Masters week. ?I hope they put a little water because the greens are pretty fast for a Monday,? said Australia?s Adam Scott. 

?They?ve been like this earlier in the week at previous Masters, but we?ve always been saved by the rain,? added Scott, who clinched the biggest title of his career at last year?s Players Championship, an event widely regarded as the sport?s unofficial fifth major.Augusta National, which was controversially extended by 285 yards for the 2002 US Masters, has not played fast and firm since then with rain falling on at least one day for each of the last three editions. 

This week, thunderstorms and scattered showers have been forecast for the tournament?s first two rounds -- on Thursday and Friday. 

Although Masters officials will be keeping at least one eye on the weather this week, they received a welcome boost on Monday when six-time champion Jack Nicklaus decided he would tee off in Thursday?s opening round. 

The golfing great, who won the last of his six green jackets in 1986 at the age of 46, had been in two minds about playing following the death last month of his 17-month old grandson.

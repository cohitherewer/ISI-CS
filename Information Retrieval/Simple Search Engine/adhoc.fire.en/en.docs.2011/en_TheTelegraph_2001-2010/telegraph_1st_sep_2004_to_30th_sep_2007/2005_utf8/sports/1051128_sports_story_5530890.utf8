 Hussey (133 ..) leads fightback 

 - FINAL TEST 

 WI 45 ahead after conceding first-innings lead 

Adelaide: Australia captured two quick wickets after Mike Hussey chalked up his second Test hundred to regain the initiative in the third and final Test against the West Indies on Sunday. 

Brett Lee dismissed Devon Smith for a duck and Shane Warne removed Wavell Hinds for 15 to reduce the tourists to 68 for two in their second innings at stumps on the third day at the Adelaide Oval. 

That gave the West Indies an overall lead of just 45 runs with two days to go after Hussey blazed an unbeaten 133 to help Australia finish with 428 and a 23-run advantage in the first innings. 

Australia had looked to be in trouble earlier in the day when they slumped to 295 for eight after Dwayne Bravo ripped through the middle order before Hussey led his teams fightback. 

The left-hander shared a 93-run partnership with Stuart MacGill for the ninth wicket and then a 40-run stand with Glenn McGrath for the last wicket. 

West Indies made a terrible start when Smith, who has made just 22 runs in his last five innings after making 88 in Brisbane, was caught by Ricky Ponting at second slip with the total on two. 

Hinds was stumped by Adam Gilchrist off Warne shortly before the close of play, leaving Ramnaresh Sarwan and nightwatchman Daren Powell survive through to stumps. 

Sarwan ended the day unbeaten on 53 after reaching his first half-century of the series from 58 balls while Powell had yet to score after being promoted up the order to protect Brian Lara, who made 226 in the first innings to pass Allan Borders world record for the most career runs. 

Hussey batted for nearly five hours, faced 215 balls and hit 13 boundaries and three sixes for his second Test century after making his maiden hundred in Hobart last week. 

He was dropped by Sarwan at slip on 88 and by Bravo on 116 when he drove the ball firmly back to the bowler but was otherwise untroubled on a flat pitch.

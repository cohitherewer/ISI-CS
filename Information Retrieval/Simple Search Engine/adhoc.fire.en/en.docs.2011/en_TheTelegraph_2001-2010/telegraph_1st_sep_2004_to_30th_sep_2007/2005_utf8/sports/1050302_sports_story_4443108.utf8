 British Asians yet to make a mark on the pitch

London: When Viv Anderson made his England debut against Czechoslovakia in 1978 he became a trailblazer for young black footballers in England. 

Hundreds of black players have gone on to reach the top of the English game in the following 27 years, with John Barnes, Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright and Sol Campbell just a few of those to excel in the England shirt. 

The squad for the recent friendly against the Netherlands contained eight black players, a typical quota in the past few seasons. 

To date, however, members of Britain?s large Asian community, around three million people or 3.5 percent of the population, have been conspicuously absent from the world?s most popular game. 

Fulham?s Zesh Rehman made his debut against Liverpool last season and has since established himself as a defensive midfielder at the London club, earning rave reviews. 

The 21-year-old Birmingham-born defender of Pakistani parentage has already represented England at youth level and the Football Association (FA) is hoping he can become a role model for Asians up and down the country. 

In the densely populated London borough of Tower Hamlets, home to many second or third-generation Bangladeshis, one team with Asian players are taking their first steps up the soccer pyramid. 

Sporting Bengal are in their second season in the Kent Senior League, the only Asian-based team to be playing in any of the country?s senior feeder leagues to the professional game. 

In their first season, using an almost entirely Bengali squad, they struggled, finishing bottom of the league. 

However, by using a mixture of Asians, whites and players from other ethnic backgrounds, Bengal have held their own this season and even reached the third round of the FA Vase. 

Some professional clubs are taking steps to nurture Asian players, with second division West Ham United leading the way through their community football programme. 

On a bitingly cold day at a half-term holiday soccer school near London?s Docklands recently, half of the 100 children taking part were Asian. 

Mick King, who runs the club?s Asians in Football Project, has been working at the East London club since 1998 and believes the scheme is already bearing fruit. 

?Rehman is doing very well at Fulham but he doesn?t go on about being Asian, he just gets on with it. He can be a good role model, but equally there?s no reason why Thierry Henry can?t be just as good a role model for Asian players.? 

Rehman faces stiff competition to break into the current England squad, but by the time the 2010 World Cup finals come around in South Africa, he could be one of many Asian players knocking on the door.

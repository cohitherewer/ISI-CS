 Waugh flays NSW move

 Steve Waugh 

Sydney: Former Australian skipper Steve Waugh has questioned the sense of his province hiring an ageing English batsman, using the Aussie colloquial term for Englishmen in comments certain to increase the stakes in the upcoming Ashes series. 

Graham Thorpe, 35, and playing in his 99th Test for England this week against Bangladesh, is planning to play and coach in Sydneys club competition next year and has agreed to bat for New South Wales state if needed. 

I must admit my initial reaction was: Why do we need a Pom (Englishman) to help us out when weve just won the Pura Cup and there is plenty of young talent to foster and develop, Waugh wrote in a newspaper column. 

New South Wales havent had an overseas recruit since Pakistani great Imran Khan in the mid-1980s. 

Thorpe will be the highest-profile Englishman to play in the Australian competition since Ian Botham played for Queensland in 1987-88. 

Thorpe has said his stint in Sydney is aimed at fostering a coaching career. Hes expected to retire from international cricket after England host Australia in the five-Test Ashes series starting in July. (AP)

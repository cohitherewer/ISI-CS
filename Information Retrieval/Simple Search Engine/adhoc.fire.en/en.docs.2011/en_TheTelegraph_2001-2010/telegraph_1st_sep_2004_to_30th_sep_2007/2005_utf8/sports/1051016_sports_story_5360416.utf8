Sydney: Australia rebounded from an early-morning batting debacle to seize control of the ICC Super Test against the World XI on Saturday. 

The home team were 66 for one in their second innings, leading by 221 runs already, when bad light ended play early on an action-packed second day, during which 15 wickets tumbled at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

England allrounder Andrew Flintoff brought World XI back into the match by mopping up the tail, but his efforts were nullified as Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill turned things around for the home team. The two leg-spinners shared seven wickets among them as the World XI collapsed for 190 in reply to Australias 345. 

Glenn McGrath also captured two wickets to overtake West Indian Courtney Walsh as the most successful fast bowler in Test cricket. 

Opener Virender Sehwag top-scored for the World XI with 76 from 82 balls. Only two other batsmen made more than 12 as seven players failed to reach double figures. 

We are not embarrassed, the swashbuckling Indian opener said. 

McGrath triggered the collapse when he dismissed World XI vice captain Rahul Dravid for a duck and Brian Lara for five to pass Walshs Test record for a fast bowler of 519 wickets. 

Warne, who holds the overall world record for Test wickets, removed Sehwag after lunch before adding the scalps of Jacques Kallis (44) and his South African teammate Mark Boucher (0) to leave the tourists reeling. 

Things did not look so bright at the start of the day when Australia lost their last four wickets for 14 runs in five overs. (REUTERS)

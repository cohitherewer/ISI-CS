 Sourav promises better batting

Harare: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has promised a better batting show in the remaining matches of the tri-series, saying one should not judge the side on the basis of a single poor performance. 

Blaming lack of acclimatisation for his sides drubbing against New Zealand on Friday, the captain said: We have been in this country for just four or five days. Well get more used to the conditions in the next few days. 

Indian batsmen came a cropper against Shane Bond in Bulawayo and Sourav said it was largely to do with the new conditions which caught his boys napping. 

It will definitely require a week or so to get used to the conditions, it is the same with other countries when they come to the sub-continent, said Sourav as he prepared for Mondays game against Zimbabwe. 

I am not worried about my own batting as I did well in Sri Lanka and there has been only this failure in the first game. Ill get better as I get used to the conditions in days to come, he said. 

Its a one-day game and anything can happen. Remember only two months ago Bangladesh had defeated Australia, Sourav pointed out. 

There wont be too many changes for Mondays game, as he believes in continuity. 

I am not a believer in changing the team after every game. I backed the team to do well in the last game and so we should do the same in this game also. 

Defending the promotion of Venugopal Rao to number three, Sourav said: I feel for a youngster, thats the best position to bat. Dravid batted at number five in the World Cup and I have batted low at times. Numbers five, six and seven are slots where a lot of experience is needed. 

A youngster should look to grab the position, it should not be an issue. I played first at number three in Tests; in one-dayers I began low and gradually moved up the order. 

Zimbabwe skipper Tatenda Taibu said his side had already seen the worst against New Zealand in the meet-opener and they can only improve from now on. 

We cannot do any worse. Our fielding was pathetic, and so was our bowling and batting. There is room for improvement in all areas, said Taibu after Zimbabwes two-hour practice session in the morning, followed by a prolonged team meeting with coach Kevin Curran. (Agencies)

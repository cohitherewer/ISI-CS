 Nadal enters second round

Beijing: Top seed Rafael Nadal gave himself a confidence-booster with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Taiwans Wang Yeu-tzuoo in the first round of the China Open on Wednesday. 

Fellow Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Russias Dmitry Tursunov 6-4, 7-6 in a second round clash to become the first man to reach the quarter finals. 

Sixth seed Ferrero will meet Argentinas David Nalbandian in the next round after the third seed overpowered Israels Amir Hadad 6-4, 6-0. 

World No. 2 Nadal looked sharp in his first match since his third round exit at the US Open, the 19-year-old triumphing in a shade under 90 minutes on his first appearance in Asia. My confidence was low after I lost (to American James Blake) in New York, Nadal said. But it wasnt very complicated today. I took my chances early and set the tone. 

He added: I didnt play great but I did enough to win. I lost focus a bit in the second set but only because it was too easy. A few wins will quickly get my confidence level back. 

Nadal, bidding for his 10th title of the year, will play American Justin Gimelstob next. Nadal has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai. Former world No. 1 Ferrero had too much guile for Tursunov, the man who ended Briton Tim Henmans Wimbledon dream this year. 

Tursunov squandered two set points at 5-5 in the second set and then a 4-1 lead in the tie-break evaporated as Ferrero rattled off six straight points to clinch victory. 

Nalbandian advanced to his second straight quarter final after reaching the last eight of the U.S. Open with a crushing victory over Hadad. 

The world No. 9 put the Israeli qualifier out of his misery following a one-sided second set with a thumping backhand down the line after just 50 minutes. I missed a few chances to break in the first set which was frustrating, said Nalbandian. But once I broke to go up 5-4 it all started to go perfectly for me. 

Eighth seed Carlos Moya fought back from a set down to beat Austrias Stefan Koubek 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to become the second Spaniard to reach the quarter finals. (Reuters)

 Athens: Coach Otto Rehhagel, who led Greece to stunning victory in the European soccer championships last summer, was named the country?s Person of the Year on Monday by a top-selling newspaper. The 66-year-old German coach defeated Greek politicians, and organisers of the Athens Olympics in the readers poll organised by Athens daily Ta Nea and a web site affiliated to the newspaper. Greece beat hosts Portugal in the July 4 final after a remarkable run, defeating defending champions France and the fancied Czech Republic. After the tournament, Rehhagel turned down an offer to coach Germany.

 London: Southampton?s England striker James Beattie looks set to join Premier League rivals Everton in what would be a record ?6 million ($11.5 million) signing by the Merseyside club. Manager David Moyes told the Everton website on Sunday: ?I can only say that we have made an offer for him which was accepted and that?s as far as I can say at the present time.

 Nantes: French Ligue 1 club Nantes sacked coach Loic Amisse on Sunday to try to stop a rebellion by the players during the winter break. The club said in statement that Amisse, in charge since the beginning of last season, would be replaced by his deputy Serge Le Dizet.

 Tokyo: Brazil?s Olympic bronze medallist Vanderlei De Lima will take part in Japan?s Lake Biwa Marathon in March, organisers said on Monday. De Lima chose the March 6 race as his first marathon since battling to third at the Olympics in August after being attacked by a spectator.

 The 35-year-old lost about 20 seconds after being shoved off the road by defrocked Irish priest with about six kilometres to the end. Italian Stefano Baldini went on to win gold. Since the Olympics, De Lima has become a household name in Brazil, where he has been paraded with world leaders.

Calcutta: Having ended the last season on a dismal note, Mohun Bagan seem determined to make a fresh beginning. On the eve of their season opener against Eastern Railway in the Premier Division on Wednesday, special officer Shyamal Sen announced that Mehtab Hussain will captain the side in the 2005-06 season while Noel Wilson will be his deputy. 

The side is studded with youngsters, barring veteran Basudeb Mondal. We dont have experienced campaigner like Basudeb but all are talented and they know what is expected of them, Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta told reporters at the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation ground after practice session on Tuesday. 

Refusing to divulge his strategy, Dutta said that he will be fielding 11 fresh pair of legs for the new season and hope they will be able to bring back the old glory associated with the club. Last year we didnt have enough players for all positions, but this time we have three to four players in every position. So it is a much balanced side, he said. 

Dutta, however, admitted that the presence of foreigners even in the local tournaments helps. They can at least use their physical strength. 

According to club assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury, Togo striker Gayle Rodrigues is expected on Thursday and will get down to business the next day. He will have go through a trial, and will then be assessed, Chowdhury said at the press conference. 

But, Mohun Bagan will have to keep in mind one thing ? their opponents show so far in the league. The railway outfit has already shocked Tollygunge Agragami 2-1 in their last outing after sharing points with Calcutta Port Trust.

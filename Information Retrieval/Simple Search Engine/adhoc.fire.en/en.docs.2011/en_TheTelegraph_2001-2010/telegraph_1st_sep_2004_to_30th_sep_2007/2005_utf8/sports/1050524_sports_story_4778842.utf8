Paris: Anastasia Myskina, the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam crown, on Monday became the first French Open champion to be beaten in the opening round as she suffered a 4-6, 6-4, 0-6 defeat to doughty Spaniard Maria Sanchez Lorenzo. 

The only two other ladies to have bowed out in Round I while defending their Grand Slam crowns (in the Open era) were Steffi Graf (1994 US Open when she lost to Lori McNeil and Jennifer Capriati (2003 Australian Open when she lost to Marlene Weingaertner). 

Where 12 months ago the elfin Myskina had triumphed in glorious Parisian sunshine, her brief defence fell to pieces on centre court. 

Drained by concerns over her mothers health, the Russians heart simply was not in it and despite mustering a modicum of resistance in the second set she handed her 109th-ranked opponent the match with her 69th unforced error. 

Tough times, Myskina said, tears glistening in her eyes. It doesnt seem to take much to beat me these days, huh? 

I just have no confidence. I hit the ball and it just goes off the court... I have no explanation, really... no. Right now when the ball comes to me I just dont know what to do. 

While Myskinas misery deepened, mens top seed Roger Federer made it look easy, leaving 264th-ranked Dudi Sela stunned on a battle-scarred centre court. The Swiss world No. 1 crushed the Israeli qualifier 6-1, 6-4, 6-0 to reach the second round. 

Ive prepared well for this, the irrepressible Swiss smiled. A good win. I am ready to stay here for a while... if I can do well here, if I can win it, it will be great for me... for my place in history. 

Womens top seed Lindsay Davenport will also be happy to put her performance behind her after struggling to an unconvincing 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over Slovenias Katarina Srebotnik. 

Belgian Kim Clijsters, twice a runner-up here, was in powerful form as she thrashed qualifier Meilen Tu 6-1, 6-0. 

Rafael Nadal looked equally impressive in battering Germanys Lars Burgsmueller 6-1, 7-6, 6-1. The 18-year-old pre-tournament favourite is bidding to become the first man since Mats Wilander 23 years ago to win the French Open on his debut. 

I was a little nervous as I was playing here for the first time, said Nadal, who captured the Monte Carlo and Rome Masters crowns in the run-up to the French Open. It was a great atmosphere... I want to play my best tennis here but its not easy. 

Former champion Carlos Moya overcame a slow start to oust fellow-Spaniard Alberto Martin 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. Seventh seed Tim Henman, a surprise semi-finalist last year, saw off lucky loser Juan Pablo Brzezicki 6-2, 6-1, 6-4. 

Sania cautious 

Indian hope Sania Mirza is cautious on the eve of her French Open campaign launch. The 18-year-old, who returned to competitive tennis after a six-week injury-induced lay-off at the Strasbourg Open last week, faces 30th seed Giselle Dulko, of Argentina. 

It wont be easy for first Indian woman to get a direct entry into a Grand Slam main draw. Clay is not my surface. Beating claycourt specialist Dulko on her favourite surface will be a tough task but Im ready to give it all I have, Sania said. 

The former junior Wimbledon doubles champion will also feature in doubles with Russian Anna Chakvetadze. (Agencies)

 Im not coming back as Frances saviour

 - Zidane feels Thuram, Makelele may follow him 

Paris: French soccer star Zinedine Zidane on Wednesday announced his comeback to the international arena after rediscovering his lost motivation. 

Zidane will make his comeback in a friendly match against Ivory Coast on August 17 in Montpellier. He announced his retirement from international football after Frances defeat to Greece in the quarter finals of the Euro 2004. 

The Real Madrid playmaker said he did not want to be dubbed as Frances saviour, despite the hopes his announcement raised in the country. 

I have found again the motivation I might have lost a while ago, said Zidane. But Im not coming back as a saviour. I am not Zorro. 

Zidane said he was eager to play again for France with the team struggling in the fourth position in their World Cup qualifying group IV, behind Ireland, Switzerland and Israel. 

To be at your best, you need to be constantly under pressure and that is what I want, he said. I love the France shirt, I want to help this side. Last year, I had lost my motivation on the pitch. 

Despite the teams struggling form, Zidane is convinced Les Bleus will qualify for the World Cup in Germany. 

We need to be positive, we have to be convinced that France will qualify. I am convinced we will qualify, said Zidane, who did not make it clear whether he would play in the World Cup if Les Bleus qualifies. 

I feel good. I feel relieved after my announcement, he said. I am happy to know that in two weeks I will be with my friends again. I am extra motivated to win everything this year. 

Zidane said he was preparing for his most emotional game with France, 11 years to the day after making his international debut against the Czech Republic in Bordeaux. Its going to be more moving than the Bordeaux game. I cannot wait, it makes me itch, he added. 

Zidane also said he was convinced that Juventus defender Lilian Thuram would follow his example and return to international football. I have no doubt, he will return, he said. 

Zidane added that Chelsea midfielder Claude Makelele would also return to international football.

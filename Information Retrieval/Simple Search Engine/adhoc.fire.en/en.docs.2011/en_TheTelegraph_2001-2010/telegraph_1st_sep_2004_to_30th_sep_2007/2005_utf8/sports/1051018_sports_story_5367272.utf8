 Moscow: Australian Open champion Marat Safin has pulled out of this month?s St Petersburg Open and is doubtful for the Paris Masters.

 The world No. 5 said on his official website on Sunday he has yet to fully recover from a ligament tear in his left knee that has troubled him since Wimbledon and forced him to withdraw from the US Open. ?The knee is not yet ready,? Safin said, adding he would fly to Paris on Monday to resume training, hoping to be fit in time to defend the title he won in Bercy last year.

 Madrid: Spain?s Albert Costa is considering retirement after slumping to a 0-6, 5-7 defeat by Argentine Agustin Calleri in the first round of the Madrid Masters Series on Monday. ?It?s possible that that was my last game, but I?m not completely sure,? the 30-year-old former French Open champion told a news conference.

 ?I?m going to leave the door open at the moment and will take a month off and then see if I recover the strength and motivation to carry on. If not, it won?t be worth it. It is very difficult to be playing at the top level for so long. I?m 30 and I?ve been a professional for 12 years.?

 Mumbai: Eight-year-old schoolboy Kaustubh Vemuri of Pune will attempt a 71-km swim from Gateway of India to Dharamtar Jetty and back on Tuesday.

 The fourth standard student will take the plunge at 3 pm and is expected to finish on Wednesday, a release said. Kaustubh?s coach Vinay Marathe is confident of his ward not only completing the energy-sapping course, but also of bettering the Maharashtra state record. 

 Rio de Janeiro: The Colombian championship went ahead as usual at the weekend after an attempted strike by the players collapsed. The country?s first footballers? strike, which had been announced on Thursday, disintegrated after the players at various clubs backed down.

 Players at 14 of the 18 first division teams had initially agreed to stop work, but, after the league said that matches would go ahead anyway with youth teams, the number quickly dropped, leading to a domino effect. The Players? Association had demanded the implementation of formal working contracts and the clubs to pay health and pension contributions. They also want a share of the television rights.

 Berlin: German match-fixing referee Robert Hoyzer and five others face fraud charges from Tuesday in a trial that an embarrassed German soccer establishment hopes will be as brief as possible.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We?re ready for any challenge, says Bal

 - Davis Cup tie vs China 

 - Bhupathi has his 1st workout 

New Delhi: Upbeat after a satisfying training session, Indian coach Nandan Bal said the team was ready for any challenge from the Chinese in the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group I tie beginning here on Friday. 

?On the first two days the boys were hitting the ball as if they were playing on hardcourts. But today they played more grasscourt points and looked a lot sharper,? Bal said after the workout. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, who joined the squad Monday evening, had his first session. Bhupathi and Aussie partner Todd Woodbridge lost in the semis of the Dubai Open last week while Paes and Nenad Zimonjic got knocked out in Round I itself. 

A former national champion, Bal said as most of the players hardly play on grass on the Tour, the additional two days of practice will be very vital. 

?Normally we assemble only on Monday. This time we came in early to get adjusted to the grasscourts. The players have now settled down and we are ready for them (Chinese).? 

Bal said though the Chinese are not very comfortable on grass, they would surely come hard at the Indians. 

?Once you call love-all in Davis Cup, the rankings go out of the window. I know they (Chinese) are going to push us and we are ready for it.? 

Captain Leander Paes was also happy with the workout and said the team would have another long session on Wednesday and then take it easy the day after. 

Asked whether he had made up his mind about who was going to play the singles, the 31-year-old said: ?I have things getting clear in my mind but I am not going to share it with anyone before we take a final decision on Thursday.? 

On his fitness, Paes said he was getting better each day but admitted that the true test would come on Thursday when he would have to decide on whether he can play on all three days, something he has been doing for over the last decade. 

Bhupathi worked out for two hours but did not play with his one-time world-beating partner primarily because Paes is concentrating on his singles. 

Asked about whether they would practise together for the next two days, Paes replied in the affirmative before quickly adding that they had played so much together, they did not need to make an extra effort.

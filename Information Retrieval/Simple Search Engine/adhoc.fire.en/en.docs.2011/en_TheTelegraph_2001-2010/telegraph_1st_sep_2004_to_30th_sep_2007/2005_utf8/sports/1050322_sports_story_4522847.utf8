 WADA to appeal acquittal

Paris: World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chairman Richard Pound says his organisation will appeal the acquittal of Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou on doping charges if the IAAF does not. 

?I am convinced that the IAAF will appeal against the decision and we will support the move,? WADA chairman Richard Pound told reporters on Monday at an anti-doping symposium organised by the French ministry of sport. 

?But if they accept the Greek federation?s ruling, we will go ourselves before the CAS.? 

Former Olympic 200 metres champion Kenteris and Thanou were cleared by the Greek athletics federation last Friday of all charges related to missing three doping tests, including one on the eve of last year?s Athens Games. 

A disciplinary commission ruled the athletes were victims of incorrect procedures, but banned their former coach Christos Tzekos for four years for his role in the affair.

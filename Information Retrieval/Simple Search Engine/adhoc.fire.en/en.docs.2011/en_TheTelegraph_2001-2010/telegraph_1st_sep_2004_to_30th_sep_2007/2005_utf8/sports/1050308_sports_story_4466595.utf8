 Lara calls for compromise

Port-of-Spain: West Indies captain Brian Lara has called for compromise to end the dispute about personal contracts which led to cricket officials excluding him and other top players from a training squad for the upcoming series against South Africa. 

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) named a 22-member squad that excluded Lara, Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Fidel Edwards, Dwayne Bravo and Dwayne Smith from the six-day camp in Barbados starting March 23. 

All six have personal contracts with Cable amp; Wireless, the major regional rival of the board?s title sponsor, Digicel. 

?The time has long past where any one party can say, ?I am only taking and not giving?,? Lara said in a statement. 

?I suggest a lot of sincere apologies ? private apologies ? would pave the way forward. And once an apology is offered, let the issue be dropped once and for all.? 

WICB president Teddy Griffith has said that the board cannot jeopardise cricket in the region as a result of individual contracts that will profit a few players. 

The April-May tour by South Africa is the first home series under Digicel?s five-year, $20 million (euro15.25 million) contract, which the WICB could not risk breaching, Griffth has said.

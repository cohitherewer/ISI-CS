 Madrid: Referee Alfonso Perez Burrull became the first match official in Spain to halt a game because of racist abuse when he asked spectators to refrain from monkey chanting at a league match in Malaga.

 Perez Burrull told club officials to make an announcement on the public address system to ask fans to stop their abuse of Espanyol?s Cameroon ?keeper Carlos Kameni.

 ?The first time the Espanyol goalkeeper intervened you could hear monkey noises coming from behind the goal so I asked for the game to be stopped to ask the Malaga delegate to make an announcement on the loudspeakers,? Burrull said in his match report published on Tuesday. ?I asked them to repeat the announcement at halftime in order to remind spectators to refrain from racist behaviour.?

 Perez Burrull has been one of the most active referees in reporting racist behaviour by fans and noted similar incidents in the Madrid derby between Atletico and Real and the league match between Albacete and Barcelona.

 Madrid: Brazilian striker Mario Jardel has broken his contract with Alaves less than a month after signing a deal with the Spanish second division club. The 31-year-old former Brazil international had signed a private agreement with Alaves until 2007, but could not be registered to play in Spain as he is under contract with Argentine side Newell?s Old Boys until June.

 ?Over the last few weeks Alaves have been waiting for Mario Jardel to clarify his legal situation with respect to his contract with Newell?s Old Boys,? said Alaves. ?During that time Mario Jardel has asked for advance payments which the club would not agree to.?

 Frankfurt: Bayer Leverkusen captain Jens Nowotny has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee ligament injury. The Germany defender, who has had ligament problems in his left knee before, suffered a recurrence of the injury in his side?s 4-2 win over FC Nuremberg on Saturday.

 ?Jens is out for the rest of the campaign for sure but he will be back for next season, of that I am convinced,? sporting director Rudi Voeller told Leverkusen?s website on Monday. It is still unclear whether Nowotny needs an operation, the website added.

 London: Arsenal forward Jose Antonio Reyes has been charged by the Football Association (FA) with violent conduct during Saturday?s FA Cup fifth round tie against Sheffield United.

 Although Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp was sent off for pushing United?s Danny Cullip in the 35th minute, television replays showed it may have been Reyes? hand that actually made contact with the United player.

 The match finished in a 1-1 draw at Highbury and both Bergkamp and Reyes will miss the replay at Bramall Lane on March 1 if the charges are upheld. 

 London: Prize money for this year?s European Open golf meet has been increased to a record ?2.3 million ($4.39 million), the European Tour said on Tuesday. The purse has been upped by ?100,000 since last year, when South Africa?s Retief Goosen eased to a five-shot victory at the K Club in County Kildare, Ireland.

 The tournament will take place at the same venue from June 30-July 3.

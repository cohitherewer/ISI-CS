 Abramovichs Dutch secret 

 - Even Mourinho doesnt know what the advisor says 

 MIHIR BOSE

 Abramovich employs a Dutchman to scout talent 

Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, has a secret scout who gives him confidential advice on footballers around the world. 

This advice is for his ears only ? even Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is excluded. 

Wednesday, I caught up with Abramovichs secret scout. He is Piet de Visser, a Dutchman in his sixties who has just won the Rinus Michels award for scouting and coaching, one of the most prestigious in Holland. 

De Vissers official title is international scout for PSV. He travels the world, visiting Brazil, Argentina and wherever else he thinks there are players who need to be checked up. 

I spoke to him just after he had returned home from the under-20 tournament in Toulon. For over a year he has also had a second job, working for Abramovich. De Visser revealed: Friends told him to contact me. I told PSV about Mr Abramovich. PSV were ready for me to work privately for Mr Abramovich while I continued to work part-time for PSV. 

I give advice to Guus Hiddink [the PSV manager] and I talk to Mr Abramovich. We meet often, more than once a month. Whenever he wants to meet me he rings, and I fly to see him wherever he is. Sometime it is on his boat, sometime at home. 

So what does he do for the Russian billionaire? 

I only give advice? It is between him and me. Nobody else is involved. I promised Mr Abramovich not to talk about the work I do for him. What I do for him is a secret. 

Nor would De Visser talk about what Abramovich pays him, although it is reasonable to suppose that he pays part of the salary De Visser receives from PSV. For Abramovich, such an arrangement would hardly be unusual.. 

Abramovich also pays part of the salary of the Brazilian defender Alex, who has made a big impression at PSV and was a reason for the remarkable progress of the club in the Champions League. 

De Visser may also have been the go-between in Chelseas dealings with Frank Arnesen, the former Tottenham sporting director, with whom he worked closely when Arnesen was director of football at PSV.

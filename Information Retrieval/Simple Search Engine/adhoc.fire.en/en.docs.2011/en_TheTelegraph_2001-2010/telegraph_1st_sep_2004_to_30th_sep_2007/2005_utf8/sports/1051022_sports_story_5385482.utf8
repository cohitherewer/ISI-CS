 Sreesanth to open attack: Chappell

 - Sachin is improving every day 

 Greg Chappell 

Bangalore: The Indian team may have some surprises up its sleeve for Sri Lanka in the upcoming one-day series, Greg Chappell indicated on Friday. 

The Team India coach said Kerala speedster Sreesanth, the lone new face in the 15-member squad for the first two games against the tourists, would be given the new ball. 

Its more than likely that Sreesanth would open the attack. But we may also try different combinations at different times. At this stage, we would be using him as an opening bowler, yes, he said. 

On the three-day camp that concluded at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore on Friday, Chappell said: The objective was to try a few things that we are planning against Sri Lanka. We looked at a few different tactics and a few different bowling combinations. 

The Team India coach felt Sachin Tendulkar looks well set to regain his form against the islanders. 

Looking back at Mohali through the first two days, training here and his batting today, I think he is well and truly on track to be back in good shape, both mentally and physically, he said. 

So, I think, thats a very positive thing...We are happy that from the fitness point of view, he got through the three days very well. The camp was good to Sachin, Chappell felt. 

What he needs at the moment is to play some cricket and get more time in the middle, get more match fitness. But I see improvement (in him) each day. 

Chappell felt the maestro, returning to international cricket after a six-month lay-off following a tennis elbow surgery, has been fantastic to the squad. 

Sachins knowledge, experience and his ability can only help young players. He has spent a lot of time with them here and even in Mohali. 

He said it was beneficial for the youngsters to have someone of Tendulkars knowledge and experience around. 

On the morale of the squad, the coach said: We are in a pretty good shape, mentally and physically. The group is looking pretty good. We will only find out when we get there, though. 

For Chappell, the only downside was the absence of captain Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag. 

But he felt that since the duo is joining the squad at Nagpur two days before the first ODI, they would gel nicely. 

According to him, Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra and Mohammed Kaif who are under rehabilitation, are a few weeks away from playing competitive cricket. 

We know conditions in India are in favour of batsmen. Its a matter of bowling the ball in the right areas, accepting that some overs, some balls, some games are not going to work out very well. 

Media manager 

Meanwhile, Wing Commander Baladitya was on Friday appointed the media manager of the Indian team for the forthcoming series against Sri Lanka and South Africa.

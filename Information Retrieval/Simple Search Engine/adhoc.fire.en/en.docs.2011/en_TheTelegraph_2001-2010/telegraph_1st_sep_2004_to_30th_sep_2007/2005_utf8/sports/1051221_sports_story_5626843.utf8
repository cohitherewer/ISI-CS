 Yuvraj helps India to 479-run lead

 - Harbhajan (7/62) bowls out Lanka for 206; Lower order to hosts rescue again 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Harbhajan Singh 

Ahmedabad: The going will only get tougher for Sourav Ganguly. Even if he boards the flight to Pakistan, his making the XI cannot be guaranteed. Especially after the way Yuvraj Singh batted at nearby Motera on Tuesday. 

Yuvraj erased all lingering doubts about his form with a majestic 75 to help India open up a 479-run lead in the third and final Test of the Videocon Cup series. No wonder Greg Chappell had a satisfied look on his face at the end of Day III. 

Having failed in the first innings here, he must have been under extreme pressure here, despite the dour 77 at the Kotla. But he remained undeterred. 

Lasith Malinga welcomed Yuvraj with an array of short-pitched deliveries that had him in discomfort, but once the left-hander weathered the early storm, he didnt look back. With supreme authority and disdain, he dismissed whatever the Lankans had to offer. 

It was a good demonstration of his enduring skill and indomitable will. His body seemed alive with the challenge of the moment and he enjoyed the surge that pressure brings. Runs came in a hurry, as balls were dispatched through point, ferocious pulls and hooks raced to fine-leg. The sweep was used cleverly to negotiate the spinners. 

It was mainly due to Yuvrajs 75 (119 minutes, 83 balls, 13x4, 1x6), and another muscular contribution from the lower-order that helped India recover from the depths of 100 for five to 287 for nine. In the first innings, the last five wickets had put together 301 runs. This time, the figure is 187 and still counting. 

Its very unlikely that the visitors will be able to achieve a target more than any team has ever managed in Test history. It will be quite an achievement if they can even take the match into the final day. 

There are two more days in this Test. So I was in no hurry to declare. Our aim was to bat through the day, said Virender Sehwag later. 

It wont be surprising if India decide to continue batting on the Wednesday morning too. 

Sachin Tendulkars early promise was cut short by Tillekeratne Dilshan after the stand-in captain (first ball dismissal) and V.V.S. Laxman fell to the Lankan pacers. Yuvraj then took charge and in the company of Gautam Gambhir, he steadily increased the lead. 

Gambhir was in good nick on a not-so-easy wicket and seemed comfortable against Muttiah Muralidharan and Malinga Bandara. Having failed to make an impression in the series, he was determined to make a last-ditch effort. He fell to an injudicious stroke and did not appear satisfied with the umpires decision. 

Two Indian wickets fell to the first ball after lunch and tea. Sehwags misplaced flamboyance was followed by Mahendra Singh Dhonis failure to read Murali. 

Ajit Agarkar played a cameo that yielded 48 off 43 balls. With superb use of feet, the Mumbai pacer took full advantage of the close-in field. Such clean hitting was bound to dent the Lankans confidence. 

The wicket has shown signs of deterioration but if someone bats responsibly, runs shouldnt be a problem. Application is the need of the hour for the Lankans. 

No praise will, however, be enough for Harbhajan Singh. The 25-year-old followed up his four wickets on Monday with another brilliant spell that helped him finish with seven for 62 ? his 17th five-wicket Test haul. It was an excellent 50th-Test performance. 

The off-spinner cherishes bowling with the SG balls. Its prominent and upright seam helps him get more turn and bounce off the wicket. The footmarks made his task that bit easier. As the Lankans tried to go on the offensive, the edges flew thick and fast. 

Kumble, too, was in his elements and that strangled the Lankans. Two quick wickets in the morning set the ball rolling. The only form of resistance came from Dilshan, who played a commendable innings of 69 (119 minutes, 109 balls, 8x4) under the circumstances.

Chandigarh: Lakshmipathy Balaji had developed a huge fan following in Pakistan last year, thanks to his performance and his smile. The youngster seems determined to continue in the same vein, the injury-induced lay-off not affecting his form. 

His maiden five-wicket haul on the opening day of the Test series in Mohali on Tuesday drew praise even from his captain. ?Balaji bowled with great zeal and got the rewards? It should also be remembered that Zaheer and Irfan were equally good,? Sourav told The Telegraph. 

Balaji, who suffered a lower abdomen injury during the Champions Trophy, felt the current series was the ?right time to come back?. 

?It was a long lay-off for me? I missed out on eight Tests and two one-day series. It was disappointing. However, I took it as a challenge, worked really hard and today?s result showed it has paid off. My attitude also helped me in my efforts,? Balaji said. 

The Tamil Nadu pacer agreed that the late recovery by the Pakistan late-order had made life a bit difficult at one stage. ?The contribution from the lower bottom order is normally very good these days? I was just concentrating on hitting the deck, and, once I started hitting it, I got into my rhythm. We just had to be patient. 

?There was some moisture in the first hour after which the wicket settled down? It became hard and the ball was coming on to the bat nicely. So we had to control the runs and wait for the batsman to make the mistake. That?s how it worked out after lunch,? he explained. 

Balaji was quick to acknowledge the role of his fellow-pacers in his moment of glory. ?Both Zaheer and Pathan have been the key bowlers for India. Zaheer is a morale-booster? he talks a lot on the field with me and makes me feel comfortable. We share a lot of a lot of bowling tips during the game. Pathan just had a bad day today.? 

Balaji agreed that the enhanced seam of the SG balls has made it a wee bit comfortable. ?The seam is a little bit higher than the balls we were used to. On Indian wickets we need to hit the ball hard and with the pronounced seam there?s bound to be some carry and extra movement off the wicket.? 

Balaji also did not forget Dennis Lillee?s role. ?Lillee had suffered a similar injury and he suggested that the best thing for me would be to run through the crease and go towards the batsman in my follow-through. The earlier one involved a lot of twisting and scrambling.? 

Balaji?s return to form will increase the competition that should be good for India.

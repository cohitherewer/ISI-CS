 Owen in Newcastle

 - We are upset as weve lost a great professional: Sacchi 

Newcastle: England striker Michael Owen agreed on a four-year contract to join Newcastle United on Tuesday, ending an unhappy year at Real Madrid. The 25-year-old is set to complete his move for a record fee of more than ?15 million. 

Bringing Michael to St James Park will rank alongside the signing of Alan Shearer as my proudest moment at Newcastle United, Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd told the clubs website. 

Newcastle fans love centre forwards and Michael is a fantastic scorer. Hes someone we would love to build the team around, and we hope he can help us bring success. 

Owen had also been linked with a return to Liverpool, the club he left last year for ?8 million, when he chose to follow the footsteps of England captain David Beckham and sign for nine-time European champions Real. 

He would have preferred a return to his former club, but Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez appeared reluctant to buy him back. 

Newcastle asked Real about Owens availability three weeks ago, and stepped up their bid to sign him after a poor start to the season in which they gathered only one point from four matches and failed to score. 

With the World Cup beckoning next year, Owen decided that only by moving away from the Bernabeu would he get the games he needed to book his place in the England side alongside Wayne Rooney. 

Competing with Ronaldo, Raul and Fernando Morientes for a place in the front line, Owen made the most of his opportunities to convince first Jose Antonio Camacho, and then, his successors Mariano Garcia Remon and Vanderlei Luxemburgo. 

He scored the winners against Valencia in the Primera Liga, Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League, and Leganes in the Cup, but it was not until later in the season that he was rewarded with a regular starting place. 

He ended the season with 16 goals and provided further evidence of his sharpness with a hat-trick in Englands 3-2 win over Colombia during their post-season tour of the United States. 

He is now fourth on the all-time England scorers list with 32 goals, 17 behind Bobby Charlton who tops the table with 49 international strikes. 

The arrival of Brazilian strikers Robinho and Julio Baptista at Real pushed Owen further down the pecking order. 

Meanwhile, Real Madrid director of football Arrigo Sacchi said on Tuesday that he was sorry to see Owen leave the club after just 12 months to join Newcastle. We are upset because we have lost a great professional, a top-class player and someone who was always very positive, the Italian told Real Madrids website. Real were happy with him. We didnt want to loan him out and it was only when a big offer was made did that we accepted the idea of selling him. (Reuters)

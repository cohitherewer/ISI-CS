Mumbai: Sania Mirza said on Wednesday she enjoys carrying the weight of a billion peoples expectations and playing under pressure every time she takes to the court. 

A billion people expect me to win every time I step on the court. Thats the way it is and I enjoy playing under this pressure, the 18-year-old said before catching an evening flight to Hyderabad. 

Sania, who landed in Mumbai from New York in the early hours of Wednesday morning, said whatever she gained from this point onwards till the end of the year, vis-a-vis her WTA ranking, would be a bonus. 

At the beginning of the year I had set a top-50 ranking target. Next Monday, I would probably be around 35-36. 

Whatever comes now would be a bonus and I dont want to aim for anything more, she said. Having entered the US Open ranked No. 42, Sania picked up enough points from her three wins at Flushing Meadow to take her around 35. 

A former Wimbledon girls doubles champion, Sania is looking forward to doing well at the Sunfeast Open in Calcutta, a Tier III meet beginning on September 19. Its going to be a very tough tournament, I am looking forward to it. But just because I won the Hyderabad title (in February) doesnt mean I would win this one too. Lets hope I do well. 

Its an honour for me to be playing with the world No. 1 doubles player. I hope we make a good team. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Benaud voted best

London: Former Australian captain Richie Benaud has been voted by English viewers as their favourite commentator. 

 In a poll conducted by a magazine, Benaud received more than 10,000 votes, an incredible 3,000 more than next man Michael Holding in the voters Dream Team. 

With Channel 4 being replaced by Sky Sports as the official cricket broadcaster in Britain from the next season, this poll was conducted to identify the mix of commentators preferred by the fans. 

Channel 4 and Sky have three commentators each, in the six-man Dream Team, with Geoff Boycott, David Gower, Mark Nicholas and Ian Botham besides Benaud and Holding. 

Benaud said: All these things are nice, but youve got to bear in mind that there ? and I do get correspondence to confirm this ? are others who dont have me at the top, who say why dont you talk more, why dont you do this or that. Everyone has his own idea about commentating. 

When asked about his secret of covering more Tests than any other commentator, Benaud said: Keep it simple. The first thing is that if I cant add anything to whats on the screen then I just shut up. Secondly, try to put your brain into the gear before you open your mouth. And thirdly, never try to be too clever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg, chief selector More on the same wavelength

 - Team India coach furnishes clarifications on Dr Krebs, Frazer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell 

Calcutta: Greg Chappell has strong views about selection and the role a coach should play, but his first meeting with Indias chief selector Kiran More (in Bangalore on Monday evening) was more than just pleasant. 

Quite a few things are being said in the Media, but our interaction went off very well? We didnt talk for long, but were on the same wavelength, More told The Telegraph. 

That More and Chappell hit it off indeed is good news. 

It wasnt their first-ever meeting, though, as the two have bumped into each other during 8-a-side tournaments in Malaysia. 

Actually, Chappell has himself been a selector and, so, is familiar with the protocols ? even if things are somewhat different in India. 

The new Team India coachs one-on-one with More (and his colleagues) was slated for Tuesday, but the chief selector dropped in towards the end of Chappells session with the BCCI officials and National Cricket Academy director Brijesh Patel. 

The BCCI was represented by secretary S. K. Nair and joint-secretary Goutam Das Gupta. 

Chappells interaction with the officials largely focused on the three camps in the lead-up to next months season-launching tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

The camps for the probables, to be identified on Tuesday, will begin on June 26/27 and continue till around July 22. 

As reported in these columns, Chappell wants regular captain Sourav Ganguly and senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkars presence on at least the first two days of the (final) cricket-specific camp. 

Sourav, who is doing duty for Glamorgan, wont be eligible for the all-important league stage of the tri-series if the ICC-slapped ban stays ? something thats expected. Sachin is recovering from elbow surgery. 

As the first camp is exclusively for the quicks and attendance in the second isnt compulsory for those busy with County commitments, Chappell can only meet all probables in the final camp. 

He wants everybody present so that nobody misses his ground rules-setting message. 

Incidentally, the issue of sports psychologist Dr Charles Krebs and sports scientist Ian Frazer working with Team India came up during Chappells session with the officials. 

He furnished the clarifications sought by the BCCI and, now, its for the Ranbir Singh Mahendras to respond.

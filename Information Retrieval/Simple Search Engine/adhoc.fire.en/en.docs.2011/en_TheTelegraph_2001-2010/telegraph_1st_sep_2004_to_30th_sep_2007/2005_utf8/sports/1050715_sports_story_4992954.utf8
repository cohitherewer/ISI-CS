Colombo: Chaminda Vaas top-scored with 49 and grabbed two quick wickets to lead Sri Lankas fightback in the first Test against the under-strength West Indies here on Thursday. 

The West Indies, bowled out for 285 in their first innings, hit back to dismiss Sri Lanka for 227 on a dramatic second day that saw 17 wickets fall at the Sinhalese Sports Club. 

The West Indian joy at gaining an unexpected 58-run lead was short-lived as Vaas took two wickets in three balls to leave the tourists tottering at 17 for three in their second knock. 

The left-arm seamer trapped debutants Xavier Marshall and Runako Morton leg-before, while Muttiah Muralidharan dismissed Sylvester Joseph to restrict the West Indian overall lead to 75 with seven wickets in hand. Captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul (0) and Narsingh Deonarine (5) were the unbeaten batsmen. 

We need to get the West Indies out quickly, keep them below 150, said the 31-year-old Vaas, a veteran of 85 Tests. 

West Indies coach Bennett King conceded his team faced a tough challenge. There is a lot to play for in this Test match, he said. We bowled exceptionally well today, but now need to bat deep to give our bowlers a good total to defend. 

The Sri Lankan batting came unstuck against Jermaine Lawson, the 23-year-old tearaway from Jamaica, who claimed four for 59 in overcast conditions. Paceman Daren Powell and off-spinner Omari Banks lent valuable support with two wickets each. 

The Sri Lankans were 149 for eight at one stage before tailenders Vaas and Muralidharan gave the top order a batting lesson by smashing 66 for the ninth wicket. 

Muralidharan was the second highest scorer with 36 before being last man out, yorked by Lawson. 

The West Indies are without 10 top players, including Brian Lara, who refused to sign the tour contracts following a sponsorship row with the West Indies Cricket Board. 

In the morning, the West Indies failed to survive the second new ball taken from the start of the days play. 

Chanderpaul failed to add to his overnight score of 69, being trapped leg-before by Vaas in the days third over. Banks, who shared a seventh-wicket stand of 81 with Chanderpaul, made 32. (Agencies)

Ax-3 Domaines (France): Austrian Georg Totschnig won the 220.5 km 14th stage of the Tour de France on Saturday ahead of overall leader Lance Armstrong, who was made to work for second place. 

For the second time this Tour, six-time champion Armstrong was left isolated from his Discovery Channel teammates when the peloton broke up on the climb up the without category Port de Pailheres. 

Armstrong found himself in a group that included seven other riders ranked in the overall top 10. 

The American kept his cool and survived a series of attacks as the group dwindled to three on the climb to the finish with only Germanys Jan Ullrich and Italian Ivan Basso able to stay with the yellow jersey. 

Ullrich, the 1997 Tour champion, cracked in the final kilometre and Armstrong wound the pace up to take second from Basso and keep the lead. Basso is now third overall behind Michael Rasmussen. 

Totschnig earned his first victory on the Tour after instigating a 10-man breakaway seven km into the stage from Agde to AX-3 Domaines. 

They held a maximum lead of more than nine and-a-half minutes over the peloton on the Port de Pailheress. 

The front group broke up on the climb and Totschnig, 34, took the lone lead when he dropped 2000 Giro dItalia champion Stefano Garzelli 5 km from the top.

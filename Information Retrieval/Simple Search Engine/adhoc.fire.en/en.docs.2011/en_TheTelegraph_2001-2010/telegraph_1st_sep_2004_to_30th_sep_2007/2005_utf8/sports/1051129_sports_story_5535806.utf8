The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lanka draw warm-up match

Bangalore: Spinners Amit Mishra (4/64) and Kulamani Parida (3/77) shared seven wickets them as Sri Lankas Tour opener against Board Presidents XI at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ended in a draw on Monday. 

Heavy rains a few days before the match played spoilsport as one-and-half days of the three-day encounter were lost due to unplayable ground conditions. 

The visitors declared their first innings at 171 for nine, and both teams decided to call off the match with only a few overs remaining to be bowled on Monday. 

Kumar Sangakkara top-scored for the visitors with 43, while Malinga Bandara and Thilan Samaraweera chipped in with 28 and 27, respectively. 

Earlier, resuming at 217 for two, the Board Presidents XI declared their innings at 317 for 4 in 75 overs. S. Sriram hit an 89-ball 61 with five fours, and skipper Y. Venugopal Rao made 46. The first Test begins in Chennai on Friday.

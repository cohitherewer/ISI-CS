 NZ trounce Malaysia 4-2

New Delhi: New Zealand kept their hopes alive for a berth in the final, trouncing Malaysia 4-2 in their last league match of the Indira Gandhi Gold Cup Hockey tournament. 

Both Australia and New Zealand have seven points each, but the Kiwis still have a slender chance to make it to the summit showdown depending on the result of the India-Australia match on Friday. 

If India win, New Zealander will be in final, while Australia need only a draw. 

The Kiwis staged a dramatic comeback after trailing 0-2 till the 27th minute, and swung the game completely in their favour in the action-packed second session which saw three goals being scored. (PTI)

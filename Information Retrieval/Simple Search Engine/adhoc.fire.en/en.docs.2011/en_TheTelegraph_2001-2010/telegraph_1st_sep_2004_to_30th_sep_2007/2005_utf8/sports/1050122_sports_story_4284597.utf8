 Wasn?t a walk in the park: Serena

Melbourne: Sania Mirza?s dream run in the Australian Open was cut short abruptly as she went down in straight sets against six-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in the women?s singles third round here on Friday. 

Sania, the first Indian woman to have reached this far in a Grand Slam event, put up a late challenge before losing 1-6, 4-6 to the former world No.1 at the Vodafone Arena. 

The 18-year-old wildcard saved two match points and held her own for the better part of the game against a player who not long ago had all the four Grand Slams under her belt. 

The Hyderabadi overcame a first-set walloping and pushed the 2003 winner to her limits in the second set, before the seventh seed raised her game to quell Sania?s challenge in 57 minutes. 

The youngster, who would jump up by 66 places to be close to the 130-mark in world rankings, had a break point in the fourth game of the second set but she let Williams off the hook with an unforced error. 

A stunning forehand helped her deuce the game before her rival uncorked a scorching ace to gain advantage and hold the serve. 

It was Serena?s powerful serves, which helped her get out of trouble. She had 12 aces in all and the highest serving speed was 197 kmph. 

The unforced errors for both players was an amazing minimum at 18 each. Williams, however, had 26 winners compared to Sania?s 11. 

The former world No.1 raced away to a 5-0 lead with breaks in the second and fourth game in just 15 minutes. It was a while before Sania could gain a footing and win her first game. Her first authoritative shot, her trademark forehand, came in the fifth game. Williams failed to control a volley against a crosscourt forehand but responded with an ace to hold serve. 

Sania, however, was on even keel in the second set. 

That she served first helped her confidence. She tested Williams with a drop shot but the American destroyed her with a fierce forehand of her own. 

Williams though had to produce her best tennis to hold serve in the fourth game. A backhand winner by Sania put her in 0-30 but the Indian failed to convert the advantage. Serena pushed her game to put the pressure back on her rival. A forehand clipped the netchord to give Williams the break in the seventh game. 

Sania still battled back from a 15-40 situation with three ripping forehands to hold serve. But the match was firmly in Williams?s grasp and she served out in style. 

Williams admitted she had been pushed hard in the second set. ?I don?t think it was a walk in the park,? she said. 

?I think I was really ready to play because I knew she was a young, talented, good player, and I wanted to make sure I was ready. 

?I told her to keep up the good work because it was good to see someone from India do so well for the first time. I was excited to see someone particularly do so well from that country, and I told her to keep fighting. 

?I think she has a very solid game, especially to be so young, she?s only 18. I definitely see a very bright future for her.? (AGENCIES)

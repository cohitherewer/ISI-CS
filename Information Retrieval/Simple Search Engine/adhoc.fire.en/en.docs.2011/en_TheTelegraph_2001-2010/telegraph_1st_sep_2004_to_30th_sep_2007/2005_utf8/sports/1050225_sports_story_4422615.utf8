 Merritt, the brightest star

 - Johnson is teenager?s idol 

 Merritt feels Johnson is the greatest track athlete 

Greenville (North Carolina): The ritual is the same each time. 

Before American teenager LaShawn Merritt races, he says a prayer, kisses two fingers on his right hand and extends his right arm skywards. It is Merritt?s way of remembering his older brother Antwan, who fell to his death more than five years ago from a dormitory room window in Raleigh, North Carolina. 

Merritt, now 18 and a first-year student at East Carolina University, was an immediate success. ?If I ever saw a human being who might be the one to break 43 (seconds), he might be. In time, in a lot of time,? said Bill Carson, track coach for 38 years at East Carolina University. 

?I?m not here to say that he is better than (world record holder) Michael Johnson,? Carson said. ?Never would I say that. But I am saying that he is gifted enough to be there.? 

Merritt has already approached Johnson?s indoor world record of 44.63 seconds, running 44.93 on the banked 200 metres University of Arkansas track at Fayetteville on February 11. Only Johnson?s 1995 world record performance and his 1996 clocking of 44.66 seconds are faster. 

The difference outdoors is much greater. Johnson set the world record of 43.18s at the 1999 world championships. Merritt ran 45.25 outdoors while winning the 2004 world junior championship. 

Carson believes Merritt can eventually close the gap. 

?You cannot change the fact he is about as gifted as a human being can be from his genetics,? Carson said. 

?He has the attitude, the knowledge, the ability to work, plus he is so tough. He comes to win.? 

Merritt said he thought other people had been more excited by his times than he had been. 

?I was excited inside, but I did not want to blow up so much because I feel that is what I am supposed to do. That is what I am supposed to run.? 

Merritt said he had not known of Johnson?s performance beforehand. 

?I came so close to it and I feel I can run faster so that is one of my goals now,? Merritt said. ?If I get it, I do. If I don?t, I?ve got years ahead of me to reach it.? 

Merritt seldom talks about how fast he can run, saying there are many ?stepping stones? in his transition from top junior runner to being one of the world?s elite. 

The world championships and the Olympics are goals, he said, ?but I know I have got to do a lot more to get there?. 

He does concede he would like to run 43 seconds some day, just like his idol, Johnson. 

?I think he was the greatest track athlete by far,? Merritt said. ?The way he carried himself. 

?He wasn?t an arrogant, cocky type of guy but he was confident. He knew when he stepped on the track he had trained harder than anybody out there.? 

Carson said Merritt would probably try to emulate Johnsons Atlanta Olympics 200 and 400 metres double in the U.S. collegiate indoor and outdoor championships in March and June respectively. 

Afterwards he would be ready to face the three Athens Olympics 400 medallists in the U.S. championships. The showdown is likely to feature gold medallist Jeremy Wariner, silver medallist Otis Harris and bronze medallist Derrick Brew.

 Flintoff stays on; 

SA axe Steyn 

Johannesburg: South Africa have axed fast bowler Dale Steyn while allrounder Andrew Flintoff was named in the England squad for the fifth and final Test starting in Centurion on Friday. 

Steyn missed the third Test in Cape Town with a shoulder strain but was recalled for the Johannesburg match after his replacement Charl Langeveldt injured his left hand. 

The 21-year-old made his debut in the first Test in Port Elizabeth but has been dropped from the squad after taking eight wickets at an average of 52 runs in three matches. 

Andre Nel has been placed on standby for Langeveldt, who will have a fitness test later on Wednesday. 

England lead the series 2-1. 

Flintoff will play in the fifth and final Test against South Africa after being given an injection to help alleviate a long-term ankle problem. 

?Andrew Flintoff had an injection in the ankle following a scan on Wednesday,? an England media release said on Wednesday. 

?He will play in the fifth Test, and the injury will be reviewed after the match.? 

He has been given cortisone injecti ons before but the problem will eventually require surgery.

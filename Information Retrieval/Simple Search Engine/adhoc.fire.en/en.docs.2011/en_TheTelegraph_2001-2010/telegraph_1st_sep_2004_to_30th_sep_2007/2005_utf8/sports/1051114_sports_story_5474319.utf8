 Brazil trounce UAE 8-0

London: World champions Brazil put eight goals past United Arab Emirates, Germany drew 0-0 in France and Englands Michael Owen returned to torment Argentina in Saturdays friendlies for next years World Cup hopefuls. 

Italy were 3-1 winners in the Netherlands, Euro 2004 finalists Portugal beat Croatia 2-0 and Ivory Coast prepared for their World Cup debut with a 2-1 win over Romania in neutral France. 

Brazil outclassed their opponents in an 8-0 drubbing in Abu Dhabi. Playmaker Kaka gave them a first-half lead but the fireworks came after the break when Olympique Lyon teammates Fred and Juninho Pernambucano scored two apiece, defenders Lucio and Cicinho got one each and striker Adriano converted a penalty. 

There were fewer goals but far more excitement in Geneva, where Owen scored twice in the closing minutes to give England a pulsating 3-2 victory over their old World Cup foes (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

Victory was an ideal filip for coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, who was under pressure from a hostile press for most of the season before England eventually qualified as group winners. (Reuters)

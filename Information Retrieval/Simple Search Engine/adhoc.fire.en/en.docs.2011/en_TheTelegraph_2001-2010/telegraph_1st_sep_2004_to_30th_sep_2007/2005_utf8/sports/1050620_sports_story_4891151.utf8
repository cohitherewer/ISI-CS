The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

I predict a Federer versus Roddick final

Guest Column 

John McEnroe

London: From Parisian chic to British 

stiff upper lip, the tennis caravan has moved to Wimbledon. The route runs through 

various grasscourt tournaments where the players try to prepare for grass. The 

chin music of the shoulder high bounce and the long rallies on the 

red clay of Roland Garros will be replaced by a low bounce and brief staccato 

rallies at Wimbledon.

Roger Federer is a hot favourite to retain his title 

for the third consecutive year. However, in tennis there is no sovereign immunity 

and Federer will face a strong challenge for his crown. His confident air must 

surely conceal his concern about his losses in the last two Grand Slams and several 

uncomfortably close tie-break wins in lesser meets.

The challengers for the title can be put into two 

categories. Firstly, Grand Slam title-holders like Safin, Hewitt and Roddick and 

secondly the dangerous floaters with big serves who have little chance of winning 

the tournament but can destabilise the draw.

Safin and Hewitt are in the same quarter of the top-half 

of the draw with Federer who seems likely to have a comfortable passage to the 

semi-finals. Safin is likely to come through to the semi-finals since Hewitt, 

due to lack of matchpractice, is not at his very best.

Among the dangerous floaters in the top half are Mark 

Philippoussis, struggling at 188 in the rankings, who has received a wild card 

and could play Safin in the second round. Mario Ancic of Croatia, seeded No. 10, 

is yet another danger for Safin if they meet in the round of 32. To sum up, Safins 

quarter of the draw is a virtual minefield. One wonders if the brittle temperament 

of the Russian will stand up to such a tough quarter. Should Safin get through, 

he should meet Federer in the semis.

The bottom half is dominated by Andy Roddick who is 

riding high after winning the Stella Artois at Queens for the third consecutive 

year. With the exception of the sixth-seeded Tim Henman, who received a higher 

seeding because of the weightage give for his past grasscourt results, the bottom 

half has no high class grasscourt specialists. 

In fact, the serve and volley players are almost extinct 

and Ivo Karlovic of Croatia, Wayne Arthurs of Australia and Max Mirnyi of Belarus 

are the only three in the bottom half of the draw. Karlovic played surprisingly 

well at Queens, where he beat Hewitt and was edged out by Roddick in two 

tie-breaker sets in the final.

Karlovic should meet Roddick once again in the second 

round. Henman is seeded to meet his nemesis, Sebastian Grosjean of France, in 

the round of 16. Grosjean has beaten Henman in their last two meetings. The winner 

is set to confront the 150mph serve of Roddick in the quarters.

Rafael Nadal of Spain, the French Open champion and 

now the brightest star in the world, seems to have a good draw. His section is 

bustling with clay-courters. In the round of 32, Nadal is seeded to play promising 

French youngster Richard Gasquet seeded 27 and then meet the winner of the match 

between Nalbandian and Stepanak. 

Both Stepanak and Nalabandian play well on grass and 

are very experienced and tough customers. The question is whether Nadal will be 

able to adjust to the fast grasscourts after three fairly easy rounds. I doubt 

if Nadal can move as well and retrieve impossible shots on the grass like he does 

on clay and also if he is able to punish the lower bounce with the accentuated 

western grip on his forehand. It is most unlikely that Nadal can win Wimbledon 

in his first attempt, though the odds of 25/1 against him seem a trifle generous.

In all, a repeat of last years final between 

Federer and Roddick seems to be on the cards with the shadow of the unpredictable 

Safin looming in the background.

The womens singles, on form, has three standouts. 

Sharapova the reigning champion and Henin-Hardenne the French champion are in 

the bottom half of the draw while Davenport, the top seed, is in the top half. 

The Williams sisters, Serena seeded 4 and Venus seeded 14, should play each other 

in the round of 16. Who could have imagined that they would ever play secondary 

roles in a major tournament?

Their enormous talent seems to have been sapped up 

in a delta of frivolous activity and compounded by injuries. It will indeed be 

difficult for Serena, currently the better of the two, to get back her focus and 

play to full potential, specially when she is short of tournament practice. The 

cracks in the confidence of the sisters is clearly visible.

The Russians, led by Sharapova, have seven players 

in the top 16. Sharapova, with her flattish power-packed deep groundshots, coupled 

with good volleying and aggression, has an outstanding chance of retaining the 

title. The other Russians, with the exception of Kuznetsova who did well on the 

grass at Eastbourne last week, are far from their best on grass. Henin-Hardenne, 

for whom impossible is nothing is short of grasscourt play and may 

not have recovered from the toll taken by the Paris claycourts. It is unfortunate 

that Henin-Hardenne is in the bottom half of the draw with Sharapova.

The 10/1 that the bookies are offering against Davenport 

to win the title are very attractive odds. If she is able to maintain her good 

form, she has a good chance of winning the title.

And what about Sania? If she gets past Akiko Morigami, 

ranked 64 in the first round, she plays the 5th seed Kuznetsova. Wimbledon is 

not the same as Dubai where Sania defeated Kuznetsova. With inadequate match practice 

and Kuznetsova out for revenge, Sanias task, if she wins the first round, 

seems unsurmountable.

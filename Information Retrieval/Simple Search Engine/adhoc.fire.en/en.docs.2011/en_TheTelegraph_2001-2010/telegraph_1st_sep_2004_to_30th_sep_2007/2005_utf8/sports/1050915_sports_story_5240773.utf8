Perth: The inquest into Australias loss of the Ashes is in full swing with Dennis Lillee calling for Shane Warne to replace Ricky Ponting as captain. 

Ponting, who returned home with the team on Wednesday, vowed to continue in the hot seat saying he had anticipated a backlash and wasnt bothered by it. Lillee joined the national debate over the immediate future of the team which lost the series 1-2. The fast bowling great, who took 355 wickets in 70 Tests, also called for John Buchanans head. 

If Australia want to regain the Ashes, they would dramatically improve their chances by appointing Shane Warne as captain, Lillee wrote in a newspaper. Lillee, 56, believed Warne, the worlds leading wicket-taker, acted as a pseudo captain during the drawn final Test and felt Ponting should be left to concentrate on his batting. 

I got the distinct impression Warne was the pseudo captain during the fifth Test at The Oval, wrote Lillee. 

Warne was heavily involved in helping set the field and whenever I turned on the television, he was speaking on behalf of the Australian team. 

There is no doubt Warne has an amazing cricketing brain ? but not only that, any cricket he plays is at 120 per cent and full of passion, guts and determination. 

Desperate times call for desperate measures, but Warne led from the front throughout the tour and I wouldnt be worried about his previous indiscretions off the field, he said, adding that captaincy could extend the leg-spinners career. 

Warne, 36, was Australias stand-out player of the series capturing 40 of the 100 wickets in the five-Test series and scoring 249 runs ? more than Simon Katich, Damien Martyn and Adam Gilchrist ? at an average of 27.66. 

Ponting said: Im not concerned about those things (criticism), I know Im not going to keep everybody happy along the way. Its a 1-2 loss. Its not as if weve been completely wiped off the planet. I absolutely love captaining Australia and hopefully Ill keep the job. 

Australias senior players defended Pontings captaincy. Pace spearhead Glenn McGrath said he didnt doubt that Warne would make a good captain but didnt believe it was fair for Ponting to be deposed on the basis of one series. 

Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said Lillee might not have an enough information about how the team functioned to make such a bold statement about Ponting. Ive got absolute confidence in the people in charge and the utmost support for Ricky, said Gilchrist. 

Ricky has been an outstanding captain up to this point and will continue to be so. He has the whole teams backing, Im certain of that. 

Opener Justin Langer said Ponting was good enough to be compared with his predecessor, Steve Waugh, who retired as Australias most successful captain. I have absolutely the highest respect and regard for Ricky, said Langer. Yeah, he was tested like all of us were tested for the first time in a very long time ? he, like the rest of us, will be much stronger and tougher for the experience. 

Lillee was wide-ranging in his criticism of the Australian performance, railing on Cricket Australia officials and coach Buchanan. 

If we are to get this team back on the rails, the plan has to go way deeper than making a few cosmetic changes to the team, he said. 

Make no mistake, Australia were ambushed by England because way too many people right across the board were living in a comfort zone. 

Cricket Australia executives, the coach, the manager, the captain and support staff must all be held accountable for this disaster.

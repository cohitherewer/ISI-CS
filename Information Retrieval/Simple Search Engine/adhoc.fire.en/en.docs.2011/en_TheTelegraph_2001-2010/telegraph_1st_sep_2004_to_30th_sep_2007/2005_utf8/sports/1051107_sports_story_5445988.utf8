Tokyo: World number one Annika Sorenstam became the first golfer to win a US PGA or LPGA tournament five years running with victory at the Mizuno Classic on Sunday. 

The Swede began the final round a shot off the pace, but produced a superb eight-under-par 64 in the rain to finish on 21-under 195 at the three-round event in Otsu, western Japan. 

Sorenstam matched Briton Laura Daviess four wins at the Standard Register Ping tournament from 1994 to 1997 when she won last years Mizuno Classic for the fourth time in a row. Only Gene Sarazen, Walter Hagen and Tiger Woods have won the same tournament four straight times on the PGA Tour. 

This is one of greatest things Ive done in my career, Sorenstam said. I felt pressure all week but I tried to stay aggressive. I feel great. 

Sorenstam won a record fifth World Championship at Palm Desert last month and has already secured an eighth player-of-the-year award ? also a record. 

The 35-year olds 24-under total at the 2003 Mizuno Classic also set an LPGA record for the lowest score in a 54-hole event. 

Sorenstams ninth victory of the year came after an eagle and six birdies in Sundays final round. 

Jennifer Rosales of the Philippines finished runner-up, three strokes adrift. 

Overnight leader Kim Young of South Korea tied for third place with Japans Yuri Fudo and Sophie Gustafson of Sweden on 16 under.

Grand Blanc (Michigan): Vijai Singh held off a late charge by Tiger Woods to retain his Buick Open title by four shots here on Sunday. 

Fijian Singh, five strokes clear overnight, fired a two-under-par 70 to finish on 24-under 264 at the Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club and secure his fourth PGA Tour victory of the year. 

World No. 1 Woods, who won the British Open two weeks ago, vaulted into a tie for second place with a 66 that included six birdies and an eagle-two at the 14th. 

Woods, eight off the pace at the start of the day, picked up seven shots in seven holes from the par-three 11th on his way to a scorching back nine of six-under 30. 

However, the US Masters champion began and ended his round with a bogey and had to settle for a share of second with fellow-American Zach Johnson, who carded a 69. 

I got it going a little bit but I needed to do that to give myself any kind of chance, said Woods. I thought at least if I played solid on the back nine, Id finish second probably, and if I played a great back nine, I might be in position just in case Vijai messed up. 

Hes playing too well to do that. But you never know. The holes are pretty easy, but you just never know. Thats why we play the game. Vijai is playing beautifully, so he deserves to win. 

It was a good fight at the end but I just didnt quite get it done. 

After three spectacular rounds, Singh claimed his 28th career title and third Buick crown with a steady performance that included just two birdies. I wasnt as aggressive today (Sunday), said Singh, who will return home to Florida to work on his final preparations for the seasons final major, the PGA Championship. 

I wasnt uncomfortable, but I wasnt at ease with what I was doing out there. I felt very much in control but at the same time I didnt want to make any mistakes. Nobody was really making a charge earlier on and I started to get into a rhythm where I was hitting greens and making pars.

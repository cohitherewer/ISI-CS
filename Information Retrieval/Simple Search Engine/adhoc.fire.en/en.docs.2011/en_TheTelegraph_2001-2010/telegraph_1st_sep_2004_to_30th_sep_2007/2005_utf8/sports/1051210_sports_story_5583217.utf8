 Indians hope to amend record

 Chennai: India will seek to capitalise on home advantage and amend their dubious record in the 27th Champions Trophy hockey tournament which begins at the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium here Saturday. 

The fray includes world champions Germany, Olympic champions Australia, defending champions Spain and Rabobank eight-nation meet champions Pakistan. 

The Indians, who will go into the tournament as underdogs, have nothing to lose and any progress over their last years performance of fourth-place finish would only add to the confidence of the team. 

However, the glaring problem for the Indians would be the absence of the dependable defender Dilip Tirkey, who was also originally named captain, as he has been one of the most consistent performers over the last decade. 

The new captain Gagan Ajit Singh may have leadership qualities, but the star striker cannot escape the burden at the back created due to the absence of an ailing Tirkey. 

The revised schedule might have eased the Indians up a bit as they are meeting Spain on Saturday instead of the powerful Aussies in the opener. 

But, that cannot make much discount on the pressure front as the hosts would meet arch rivals Pakistan, who are in cracking form and are boosted up by the return of their captain Mohammad Saqlain, the next day. (PTI)

 India finish in style

 - Jhulan joint Woman of the Series 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Indians wanted to finish the series on a winning note and they did it in style, defeating England by 38 runs in the fifth and the final womens one-day International at the Eden on Friday. India thus won the series 4-1 

Wicketkeeper-batswoman Karuna Jains brilliant century saw India comfortably pocket the final tie. It was a dead rubber as India had already clinched the series by inflicting a 10-wicket victory against England in their last match in Silchar on Wednesday. Put into bat, India made 243 for the loss of four wickets. In reply, England were all out for 205. 

India were off to a flying start as openers Karuna Jain and Jaya Sharma put on a century partnership. Karuna scored a brilliant 103 while Jaya made 59. Karuna is the fifth Indian to score a ODI century. 

Jaya got to her 50 in an emphatic style with a four over mid-wicket in the 23rd over. This also brought the century stand for India. Jayas innings came to an end when she gave an easy catch to Jenny Gunn off an Arran Brindle delivery in the 28th over. 

Asha Rawat joined Karuna, and made a patient 31 before she was run out by Isa Guha in the 44th over. Karuna got her century in style hitting a four in the second ball of the 48th over. But in next ball, she scampered for a single and a direct throw by Arran Brindle, saw her short of the crease. The Indians ended their innings at 243 for the loss of four wickets. Anjum was not out on 26. 

It was always going to be a tough target to achieve, given the fact that the English women were able to cross the 200 figure in only one occasion in the series. 

The English eves lost four wickets in quick successions. Skipper Charlotte Edwards was the first out when the teams total was 11. 

Arran Brindle and Lydia Greenway put on a 89-run partnership for the fifth wicket, which helped England cross the 200 mark. 

Brindle was the first to go after a brilliant 52 in only 66 balls. Lydia followed her shortly after scoring 40. After Brindle and Lydia were back in the pavilion, it was a childs play for the Indian bowlers to wrap up the English tail. 

Amita Sharma, Varsha Raffel and Neetu David scalped two wickets each.

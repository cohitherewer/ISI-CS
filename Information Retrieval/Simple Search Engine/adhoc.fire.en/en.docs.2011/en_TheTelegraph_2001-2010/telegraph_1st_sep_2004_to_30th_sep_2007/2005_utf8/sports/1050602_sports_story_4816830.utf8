New York: Michael Owen grabbed a hattrick as England completed their two-match tour of the US with a 3-2 victory over Colombia in a friendly on Tuesday. 

Real Madrid striker Owen took his international goal tally to 32 with strikes in the 36th, 44th and 58th minutes as he plundered the second international hattrick of his career. 

Colombia replied with a first-half header from Mario Yepes and a left-foot shot by Aldo Leao Ramirez in the 78th minute. But Owens deadly finishing stole the show and moved him into fourth place in the list of all-time goalscorers for England ahead of Alan Shearer, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney. 

Bobby Charlton holds the record with 49, followed by Gary Lineker and Jimmy Greaves, and at just 25 years old, Owen is still young enough to overtake them all. 

His previous hattrick had come in September 2001 during Englands famous 5-1 victory over Germany in Munich. 

In New Jerseys Giants Stadium, Owen opened the scoring when he ran on to a through ball from midfielder Joe Cole and lifted it past Farid Mondragon in the Colombia goal. 

The in-form striker made it 2-0 seven minutes later when a quick freekick from Peter Crouch on his debut put Owen clear to score with a low shot. 

The former Liverpool forward completed his hattrick in the 58th minute by volleying home from close Real Madrid teammate David Beckhams cross. 

Colombia scored through Yepes header shortly before halftime and Ramirezs shot late in the second half but England held on to complete a 3-2 victory. 

England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson heaped praise on Owen. 

Ive known for a long time that Michael Owen is one of the best strikers in the world and he showed it again tonight, the Swede said. 

He scored three fantastic goals but that is nothing new because he has been doing that for I dont know how long. He is a brilliant finisher and I imagine it would be hard to find a better one in the world. 

It showed again how important he is for the team. He has scored 32 goals for England and he is only 25, so there should be a lot more to come. 

Owen admits he still has a lot to do to surpass Charlton. 

Every goal I score from now on people will say is one less on the way to the record, but there is still a long way to go, he said. 

Im into the 30s now which is nice, although 49 is a long way off. But you have got to aim high and that is what I am aiming for. If I fail to beat the record it wont be for the want of trying. 

Tuesdays victory followed a 2-1 win over the US in Chicago on Saturday, completing a successful mini-tour that was widely criticised in the English media as a meaningless distraction after the end of a long domestic season. 

Eriksson, however, felt the trip had been a worthwhile one as he prepares for important World Cup qualifying matches in the autumn. 

It has been a fantastic exercise for us. Two matches played and we won both of them against teams we might meet in (next years World Cup in) Germany, he added. People have come in and taken their chances. Tonight I thought the two centre-halves Zat Knight and Glen Johnson both did very well against good opposition. Colombia are a good side and I think we coped well. (REUTERS)

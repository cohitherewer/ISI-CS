 Sourav, 3 others to play Ranji; reach Pakistan late

Mumbai: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who skipped the ongoing Ranji match against Gujarat, was on Tuesday asked to play Bengals next game (home tie versus Tamil Nadu) before leaving for Pakistan next month. 

Three others ? vice-captain Virender Sehwag, leg-spinner Anil Kumble and second wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel ? have been issued similar instructions by the BCCI. 

The decision, taken after consulting captain Rahul Dravid, coach Greg Chappell and selection committee chairman Kiran More, has been approved by BCCI president Sharad Pawar, according to a press release issued by secretary Niranjan Shah. 

With the next round of Ranji matches scheduled to end on January 6, the quartet would be reaching Pakistan two days after the rest of the squad lands in Lahore (on January 5). 

We have taken this decision as all 16 chosen for the tour will not be needed to play the three-day tour-opener in Lahore from January 7 (versus Pakistan A). We also wanted to give importance to domestic cricket, Shah explained. 

Souravs decision to skip the Gujarat match led to some raised eyebrows with More seeking an explanation via a letter to Shah. 

Souravs reply, saying that he didnt play due to family reasons, has satisfied the BCCI. We have accepted his reply and forwarded it to More, said Shah. 

Patel is also not playing the Surat game because of ill health. Sehwag has presumably been asked to play as his run of low scores continued in Delhis match against Railways in which he managed 15 and 0. (Agencies)

 Vengsarkar proposes lighter bats for U-15 players

Mumbai: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar has recommended that the countrys under-15 age group players use only bats which are lighter than 2.4 pounds, in order to prevent them from picking up technical faults at their developing stage. 

Vengsarkar, who attended the BCCIs Junior Cricket Committees meeting here on Sunday as a special invitee, has also proposed that in view of the next U-19 World Cup, scheduled in Sri Lanka early next year, a national junior coach be appointed at the earliest. 

Another recommendation from the former Indian middle-order batting mainstay, who is also the chairman of the BCCIs Talent Research Development wing is that all junior tournaments be played only on good, standard wickets. 

These proposals along with other recommendations came up for discussion at the meeting, chaired by BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla, according to the convenor of the meeting and BCCI joint secretary Goutam Das Gupta. 

Another recommendation is that all junior players selected by each association for the BCCI-organised tournaments should undergo pre-tournament medical tests conducted by the Apollo Hospital or any other equivalent hospital to verify their correct age. 

This would prevent the tournaments from being affected midway as no protests regarding players ages would be decided upon before the end of the tournament, Das Gupta said. (PTI)

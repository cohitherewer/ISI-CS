Sydney: World XI stars failed to rise up to the challenge of chasing a record total and collapsed in the face of some spirited spin bowling by Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill, who snared eight wickets between them, to lose the Super Test by a humiliating 210-run margin. 

There was hardly anything super about the match as all that it served was to re-establish the supremacy of the Australians who had earlier clubbed the same bunch of worlds so called elite players 3-0 in the one-dayers. 

While stars like Rahul Dravid (26), Brian Lara (36) and Jacques Kallis (39 not out) glimmered for a while in World XIs second innings, others in the assorted line-up like skipper Graeme Smith (0), Virender Sehwag (7) and Inzamam-ul Haq (0) simply caved in while chasing 355, a score no other team has ever chased successfully batting second on the spin-friendly SCG. 

After being bowled out for 190 in their first essay in reply to Australias 345, World XI were expected to at least put up some fight but they fared worse, being dismissed for 144 in exactly 50 overs, the match ending just an hour after lunch on the fourth day of what, ironically, was supposed to be a six-day extravaganza of thrilling cricket. 

While Australians were brimming with confidence, reflected in the way they dominated the game overall, the stars of the opposition team gave the look of being lost in the woods, raising serious concern about the entire concept of pitting the best against the best of the rest. 

In the face of an unmotivated display, the master and his pupil in leg spin thrived although it was another matter that MacGill kind of outperformed Warne. 

World XI had started the fourth day on Monday already in deep trouble at 25 for two and their prospects of reaching their target vanished in the first hour. 

 dismissed new India captain Dravid for 23 and then Lara for 36, both caught behind after being given a lesson in wrist spin by the master himself. 

The tourists lost a third wicket before lunch when Pakistan captain Inzamam was unluckily adjudged leg before to paceman Brett Lee before the last five wickets tumbled for the addition of 31 runs in the middle session. 

MacGill, who was controversially left out of the Ashes Tests, added ammunition to his claims that Australia should have played two leg spinners in England when he dismissed Andrew Flintoff for the second time in the match before mopping up the last three wickets in just five balls. 

Macgills fiver gave him a match haul of nine for 82, while Warnes figures of three for 48 meant he returned six for 71 for the match to swell his already bulging world record tally to 629. 

Matthew Hayden was declared Man of the Match for his century in the first innings, and Adam Gilchrist Man of the Series. 

The only time Australia looked a little vulnerable was in their second innings when they were bowled out for 199 but by then they already had established a vice-like grip over the match. 

For World XI the only face saving feature was a 76 by Sehwag in the first innings and some fine bowling by Flintoff who emerged as the highest wicket-taker for them with seven scalps.

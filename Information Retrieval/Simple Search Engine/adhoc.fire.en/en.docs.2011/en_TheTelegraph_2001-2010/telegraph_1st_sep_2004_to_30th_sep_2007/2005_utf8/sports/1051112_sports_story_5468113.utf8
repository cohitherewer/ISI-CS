 India look to finish in style

 - Pathan set for maiden ODI appearance in hometown

Vadodara: Having outplayed the visitors right through the series, India will be eager to continue to stamp their domination over Sri Lanka and finish the Videocon Cup on a winning note in the final one-dayer here Saturday. 

Everything has gone well for the home team, while almost nothing has clicked for the islanders. India are going into the last clash with a commanding 5-1 lead. 

Another victory Saturday will be the ideal boost for the hosts before the best-of-five series against South Africa commencing in a few days. 

The high point of the series for India has been the way the youngsters in the team have come up with superb displays when needed. 

A prime example of this new-found confidence in the newcomers was the way left-arm pacer Rudra Pratap Singh performed in Rajkot in the previous tie on a pitch that was largely expected to help the batsmen. 

Singhs four-wicket haul, which earned him the Man of the Match, must have done wonders for his morale. So too have been the key roles performed earlier in the series by other youngsters like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina and Yalaka Venugopala Rao. 

Coach Greg Chappell had been talking of waking up the players from their comfort zone since he took over as coach five months ago and this seems to have been achieved in a spectacular fashion. 

 The IPCL ground is among the favourites of Sachin Tendulkar. The 32-year-old champion batsman has struck two glorious hundreds for winning causes at this venue, a knock of 115 against New Zealand in 1994-95 and a stroke-filled 122 off 135 balls against South Africa in 1999-2000. 

Another big one from the maestro might just be the icing on the cake of triumph for India. 

It would be a big occasion for 21-year-old Irfan Pathan too as it would be his maiden ODI appearance at his hometown after having played for India on 43 previous occasions. No wonder the left-arm pacer was pestered by fans, with requests for autographs and photos, during practice on Friday. 

Captain Rahul Dravid, who skipped the previous game to get some rest, has led the Indian charge brilliantly from the front with the bat as well as with his aggressive captaincy. He would want to finish off what he started commendably, when India wrapped up the series with a 4-0 lead in Pune, with another thumping success here. 

Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara said the islanders had drawn many positives from the series. We are taking a lot of positives from this series. Number one, we have learnt to focus on basics. People like (Fervez) Mahroof have had a baptism by fire and I feel hes come through it well, Sangakkara said at a press conference. 

Maharoof, who has a torn webbing on his right hand and required four stitches, is unlikely to play. 

Sangakkara did not confirm whether ace off-spinner Muthiah Muralidharan, who did not play in the previous match because of a hamstring strain, would play Saturday. 

He wants to play. But it depends on how the team management looks at it from a longer point of view and whether they feel he needs to be rested to keep him fit for the long season ahead, he said.

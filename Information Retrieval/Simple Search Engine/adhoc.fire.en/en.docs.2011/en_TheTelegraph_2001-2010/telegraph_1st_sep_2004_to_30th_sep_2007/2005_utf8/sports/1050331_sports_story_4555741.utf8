Hyderabad: Pakistan warmed up for their upcoming one-day series in style thrashing India A by eight wickets in the warm-up limited-overs tie at the Visakha Stadium here Wednesday. 

The visitors rested key players including captain Inzamam-ul Haq, but were still good enough to restrict the hosts to a modest 189 and overhaul the target with four overs to spare. 

Shoaib Malik, playing his first match on the tour, found his in-laws? home town lucky as he struck a hurricane 81 from 78 balls with four fours and as many sixes. 

Opening batsman Salman Butt staked a recall with a fluent 70 as he added 137 for the second wicket to round off a perfect preparation for Pakistan ahead of the six match series. The first one-day International is slated for Saturday in Kochi. 

The tie turned out to be a low key affair as Pakistan entered the field without their vice-captain Younis Khan, the flamboyant Shahid Afridi, Yousuf Youhana and pacer Mohammed Sami, besides skipper Inzamam. 

According to coach Bob Woolmer, three of them were down with flu and two were rested. An extremely hot day kept the fans indoors, robbing off further colour from the match. 

Openers Butt and Mohammed Hafeeez appeared in hurry and added 47 runs for the first wicket before a terrible mix up at the wickets saw the latter being run out for 16. 

Malik then joined Butt to hammer the pedestrian India A bowling. He celebrated the team?s 100 with a massive six off Ramesh Powar which also heralded the 50 partnership for the second wicket. Malik raced to 50 in just 55 balls with three huge sixes. 

Bengal mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose claimed the wicket of Butt. Earlier, Suresh Raina saved the blushes for the hosts by compiling a fighting 55 with five hits to the fence to provide their score a semblance of respectability. 

Sridharan Sriram (38) and Y Venugopala Rao (20) lifted the team from 31 for two but the batsmen found the going tough against some disciplined bowling. 

Pakistan pace bowlers Rana Naved-Ul Hasan and Iftikhar Anjum Rao operated well with the new ball and troubled the openers, Shikhar Dhawan and M S Dhoni with their teasing line. 

The duo constantly bowled a probing line outside the off stump and soon reaped the rewards when Dhoni snicked a rising delivery from Naveed into the safe hands of Malik. 

S Sriram joined Dhawan and the duo looked to tackle the bowling with ease. Dhawan cheered the crowd with an elegant boundary off Naved but in the very next ball his middle stump was uprooted by an incoming delivery.

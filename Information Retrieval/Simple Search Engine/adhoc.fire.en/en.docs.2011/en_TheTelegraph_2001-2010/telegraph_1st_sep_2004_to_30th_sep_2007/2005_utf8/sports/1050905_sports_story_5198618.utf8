The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prevailing with poetry, power and some 

 jitters 

 KAREN CROUSE

 Justine Henin-Hardenne 

 has a point to prove 

 New York: Justine Henin-Hardenne 

 has an awesome array of shots, blending power, cunning and 

 grace as well as anybody not named Roger Federer. Her game 

 flows like haiku, so it should not be a surprise that in 

 the manner of lyrical poets everywhere, she sometimes struggles 

 to create a facile result. 

 In a third-round match at the 

 US Open on Saturday, Henin-Hardenne faced an unseeded player, 

 Cho Yoon-jeong of South Korea, whom she had not played since 

 they were juniors. In front of a sparse crowd under a cloudless 

 sky, Henin-Hardenne triumphed over her nerves and Cho 6-0, 

 7-6 (7-4). 

 The first set was Henin-Hardennes 

 in a snappy 24 minutes. The final result seemed foreordained 

 when Henin-Hardenne hurried to a 3-0 lead in the second 

 set. She was playing by instinct, ripping forehand winners 

 and showing a delicate touch around the net. 

 Then Cho hit a few well-placed 

 shots that seemed to pierce Henin-Hardennes confidence. 

 Instinct gave way to introspection, and suddenly Henin-Hardenne, 

 a 23-year-old from Belgium, was tighter than her ponytail. 

 Acknowledging that she grew tense 

 as the second set wore on, Henin-Hardenne said: Its 

 going to be like that, I think, for my whole career. Its 

 the way I am and the way I act. 

 Henin-Hardenne is high-strung, 

 so matches such as these, she said, when she is playing 

 someone she is expected to defeat, will always be somewhat 

 of a struggle. 

 You cannot fight through 

 that, Henin-Hardenne said. You try to get better, 

 try to handle better these situations. But its very 

 hard to change your character and your personality. 

 At a shade under five feet six 

 inches, Henin-Hardenne is the smallest woman left in the 

 Open draw. She should stand out because of her game, but 

 in the first week she has drawn little notice. 

 The Williams sisters draw the 

 spotlight to whichever court they inhabit, even if its 

 a practice court. An hour before Henin-Hardenne stepped 

 onto the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Serena and Venus 

 Williams traded groundstrokes on a practice court that was 

 out of camera range except for those with high-powered lenses. 

 The Williamses have won four Open 

 singles titles between them; Serena in 1999 and 2002, Venus 

 in 2000 and 2001. With their strapping games and outsized 

 personalities, the sisters cast such a large shadow over 

 womens tennis in the United States that it is easy 

 for Open fans to overlook Henin-Hardenne, who is the most 

 recent womens champion to survive the first week of 

 play. 

 Henin-Hardenne, the 2003 Open 

 champion, has been hindered by illness and injuries since 

 her twinkling 10-month run two years ago. Beginning with 

 the 2003 French Open and ending with the 2004 Australian 

 Open, Henin-Hardenne won three of the four Grand Slam titles, 

 with only Wimbledon eluding her grasp. 

 If she is the forgotten champion, 

 that is fine with her. Im going to try to prove 

 on the court that Im part of the players who can go 

 to the end of the tournament, Henin-Hardenne said. 

 I dont care about anything else. 

 A respiratory illness kept Henin-Hardenne 

 off the Tour for most of last year. She played in only eight 

 matches in the five months leading to her defence of her 

 Open crown. She advanced to the Round of 16 before falling 

 to Nadia Petrova in straight sets. 

 A knee injury slowed her down 

 early this year, and a hamstring injury has hindered her 

 of late. This is only Henin-Hardennes second tournament 

 since her first-round loss to Eleni Daniilidou at Wimbledon. 

 In her only Open tune-up, Henin-Hardenne 

 reached the final of the WTA Tour stop in Toronto, losing 

 to Kim Clijsters in the final. Clijsters was Henin-Hardennes 

 foil in the finals of all three of Henin-Hardennes 

 Grand Slam championships. 

 Before a Grand Slam, for 

 sure, you probably need more than one tournament, 

 Henin-Hardenne said.

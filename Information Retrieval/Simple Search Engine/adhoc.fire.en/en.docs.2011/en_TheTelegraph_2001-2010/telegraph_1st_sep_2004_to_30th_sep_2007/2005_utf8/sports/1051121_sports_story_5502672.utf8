Faisalabad: Pakistan took control of the second Test with England on Sunday, reaching a comfortable 300 for four at close of Day I. 

Inzamam-ul Haq (80 not out) and Shahid Afridi (67 not out) put on 99 for the fifth wicket to boost the innings after Mohammed Yousuf scored a superb 78 before falling to a contentious caught and bowled by Ian Bell. 

Yousuf stood his ground for a while after his drive was picked up low by Bell and TV replays suggested the ball may have clipped the ground as the catch was completed. 

Umpires Darrell Hair and Simon Taufel at square leg did not consult the TV umpire and Bells appeal for a catch was upheld. 

Yousuf had posted a 128-run stand with his captain to help Pakistan recover from a precarious 87 for three at lunch on a placid pitch after the home side won the toss. Pakistan lead the three-Test series 1-0. 

Inzamam scored his 42nd half-century while Afridi got his seventh. Play was called off nine overs early due to bad light. 

Afridi savaged the England bowlers in the final session, taking just 62 balls for his runs and hitting four sixes and four fours. His half-century came from only 46 balls. 

He was let off at 34 by captain Michael Vaughan who returned to the side after missing the first Test due to a knee injury. 

Vaughan put down a straight forward chance at cover off Matthew Hoggard. Afridi made England pay as next he drove Shaun Udal on to the rooftop and then hit him for a six to mid-wicket. 

Afridi, who did not play in the first Test in Multan, signalled his arrival with three successive fours off Bell and also hoisted Steve Harmison into the crowd for a big six to delight the capacity crowd. 

Inzamam, who has now got scores of 184, 31 not out, 50, 117 not out, 53, 72 and 80 not out in his last seven outings for Pakistan, anchored the innings with a dour knock spanning 159 balls and 255 minutes with eight fours. Yousuf timed the ball flawlessly, hitting eight fours and two sixes in his 143-ball innings. 

Englands bowlers had been rewarded for a battling display before lunch when Pakistan lost Salman Butt (26), Younis Khan (7) and Shoaib Malik (27) in the space of 20 runs after an opening stand of 53. 

Harmison had Butt caught behind, Younis hit Andrew Flintoff straight to Kevin Pietersen at mid-wicket and Malik fell to a fine one-handed diving catch by Flintoff at short extra cover. 

Later at the press conference, England coach Duncan Fletcher said: Winning the toss was crucial and we would have liked to get one or two more wickets. The wicket is very good for batters. 

 Latif call 

Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif, whose career was hastened to an unceremonious end due to a five-match ban in 2003, has called on the International Cricket Council to impose a similar suspension on England batsman Ian Bell. 

Two years ago the Match Referee ended my career because he felt I had claimed an unfair catch off the ground against Bangladesh. I want to see what they do with Bell, Latif said.

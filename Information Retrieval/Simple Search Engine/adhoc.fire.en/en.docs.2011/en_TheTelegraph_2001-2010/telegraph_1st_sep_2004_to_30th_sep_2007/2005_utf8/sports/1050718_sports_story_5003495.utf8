 JMM leaders disrupt JSCA meeting

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: The Jharkhand State Cricket Associations (JSCAs) maiden annual general meeting was marked with commotion and unruly scenes when JMM leaders led by Jamshedpur member of parliament Sunil Mahato disrupted the proceedings for about half-an-hour at the members stand of Keenan Stadium today. 

The JSCA members, a large chunk of whom came from the affiliated districts, seemed to have been caught unawares when Mahato, senior JMM leader Mohan Karmakar and party activists arrived at the venue of the meeting. 

The activists shouted slogans against the anarchy prevailing in the state cricket body and threatened to stall the proceedings.

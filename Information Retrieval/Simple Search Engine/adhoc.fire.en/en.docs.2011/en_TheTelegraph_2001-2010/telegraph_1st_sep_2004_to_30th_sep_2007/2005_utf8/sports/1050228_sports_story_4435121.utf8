 Sacking Subrata is not the solution for Mohun Bagan

 FREE KICK

 What an asset Barreto would have been 

 to Mohun Bagan in such a crisis 

The National League is fast nearing the halfway stage and the men are getting separated from the boys. East Bengal, despite their first defeat the other day, are very much in line for a third successive triumph. Dempo are running neck and neck, Mahindra United have shown some good form as well. The most striking feature, however, has been Mohun Bagan?s decline. Having dropped 16 points in nine matches, the green-and-maroons are practically out of the championship picture. 

 The coach is being made the scapegoat, with every defeat leading to a fresh chorus demanding his resignation. This is a common phenomenon all over the world. I have faced this, even Sir Alex Ferguson has been under similar pressure several times in his illustrious career. 

 For the sake of an institution like Mohun Bagan, I hope the administration and supporters stop putting unnecessary pressure on Subrata Bhattacharya as there is still a lot to play for. I can say one thing with certainty: sacking Subrata is not the solution Mohun Bagan are seeking. Changing the coach at this stage may, in fact, turn out to be counter-productive as it will be extremely difficult for the person slipping into Subrata?s shoes to settle down so quickly. 

 Mohun Bagan?s problems are deep-rooted. The administrative doldrum the club has been going through for the past year has led to doubts and mistrust among a section of officials and that has percolated to the players, members and supporters. Special officers like Shyamal Sen are too much of a gentleman to tackle such complex situations. 

 A coach is only as good as his team. And I must say Subrata hasn?t been as lucky as Subhas Bhowmick on the players? front. Mohun Bagan do have a set of talented midfielders but most of them are fair-weather players who don?t have the wherewithal to pull the team through when the chips are down. 

 The team also lacks the striking power needed to penetrate defences at this level consistently. An Ashim Biswas or a Sunil Chhetri can win you one or two games out of 20, but Subrata needs someone like Bhaichung Bhutia who can win 8-10 matches on his own. 

 Talking of a matchwinner, one can?t but help mention Jose Ramirez Barreto. What an asset he would have been to the team in a crisis like this. Not only was he capable of scoring world-class goals, the gifted Brazilian had fine game-making skills. He had developed very strong feelings for Mohun Bagan and was a big inspiration to the rest of the team. 

 Unfortunately, a misunderstanding ended the relationship. It was quite avoidable and I have to say the Mohun Bagan officials couldn?t handle the situation well at all. If I was in charge at that time, I would have cleared his dues and sent him home for two months. He would have realised the club cares for him and would have surely returned. It?s simple human psychology. 

 Subrata needs that kind of support right now. The officials, special officers and former players should sit down with the coach and tell him ?we are all with you. You?ve given your best and that?s why the team featured in four finals. You?ll be there for the rest of the season, just go ahead and continue doing your job.? 

 Bhowmick came under choking pressure sometime last season, but the club backed him to the hilt. That?s what Mohun Bagan need to learn from East Bengal. 

 The red-and-golds were dealt a body blow when Douglas broke his shin bone. Here is another Brazilian capable of carrying an Indian club on his strong shoulders. One of the best defensive midfielders in business, Douglas possesses good attacking skills, too, as he showed in scoring plenty of goals. A fearless fighter who can run for 90 minutes, Douglas has been a key weapon in the East Bengal armoury during the past two-three seasons. 

 It certainly wont 

 be easy to find a replacement for Douglas

 It certainly won?t be easy to 

 find a replacement for Douglas, but I do believe Bhowmick 

 can overcome this problem. As he rightly says, East Bengal 

 have won games without Douglas. That?s the right attitude 

 for a coach. Rather than brood over an injured player, he 

 should look for an alternative in a positive frame of mind. 

 Someone will have to take extra workload in Douglas? absence 

 and I am quite sure Bhowmick will find the right man soon. 

 The best quality that this East Bengal team possesses is a great fighting spirit. Dempo outplayed them in Margao recently and were leading 3-1. Bhowmick?s men still didn?t give up and reduced the margin in stoppage time. 

 Dempo are on a roll and that?s very creditable for a team which lost a key striker to a terrible tragedy just a few months back. But take it from me, there?s still a lot of football left to be played. East Bengal won?t give up their dream of the NFL hattrick so easily. 

 Watch out for Mahindra as well. And don?t forget there are some dangerous floaters like Salgaocar and Fransa who, on their day, can beat any team.

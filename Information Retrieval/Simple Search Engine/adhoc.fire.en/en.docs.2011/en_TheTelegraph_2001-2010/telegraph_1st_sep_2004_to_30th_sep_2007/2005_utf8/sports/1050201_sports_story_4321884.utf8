 PCB team to revisit Kotla after 3 weeks

New Delhi: The PCB?s venue assessment team on Monday took stock of the Feroz Shah Kotla ground and decided to have a re-look three weeks later to ensure the ground ? undergoing massive renovation ? is ready for the last one-day International of the Indo-Pak series in April. 

After inspecting the ongoing renovation of the stands and relaying of the turf and wicket for about 45 minutes, the team, comprising PCB general manager (operations) Zakir Khan and Lahore SSP Sohail Khan, told the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) officials that they would come back to review the progress three weeks later. 

?I hope this is completed in time,? former quick Zakir said. ?We?ll discuss this with the BCCI. If they guarantee that it will be ready, we?ll have to believe them.? 

The DDCA officials put up a brave front and expressed confidence that the work would be completed by end of March. 

?The PCB team expressed satisfaction after watching the renovation. They will visit again after three weeks. Anyway, we are confident of completing most of the work by March 20,? DDCA joint secretary (company affairs) said. 

Meanwhile, the BCCI working committee meeting, scheduled to be held in Delhi on February 16, would deliberate on the PCB?s reaction to its two-member venue assessment team?s report, which is expected soon, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said on Monday. 

Visa camps likely 

India may set up visa camps in Pakistan to help fans across the border visit the country for the upcoming series. 

BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla said the external affairs ministry has given an assurance of setting up visa camps in cities like Lahore-Karachi as a large number of Pakistanis are expected to visit India to watch the three Tests and five ODIs. 

?The ministry has assured us of full co-operation. Besides visa camps in major cities, the government may run special trains and flights between the two countries during the series,? Shukla said here. (PTI)

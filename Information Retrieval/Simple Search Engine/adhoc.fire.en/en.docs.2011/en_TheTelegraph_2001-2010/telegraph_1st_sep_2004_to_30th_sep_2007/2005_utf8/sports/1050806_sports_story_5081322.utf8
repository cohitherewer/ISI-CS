 Morigami ends Sanias run

New Delhi: Sania Mirzas glorius run at the $1.3-million Acura classic in San Diego came to an end in the third round, but not before she put up a gallant fight while losing to Japans Akiko Morigami 6-2, 4-6, 6-4. 

The tough task of winning four matches ? including two qualifying rounds ? at a tournament of a level second only to Grand Slams and the emotional high of becoming the first Indian in 16 years to break into the top-50 seemed to take its toll on the 18-year old Sania. 

After breaking Morigami, ranked 61, in the opening game of the match, Sania surrendered the lead in the next and went on to make three double faults to drop serves in the sixth and eighth games to lose the set. 

But Sania hit back as she broke Morigami thrice in the second set. Although she herself was broken twice, her serving was free of errors. But the double fault syndrome returned to haunt her in the decider. Having forced a break in the fifth game, Sania double faulted at 0-30 in the next game to face triple breakpoint. 

Morigami converted it and uncorked another break in the 10th game to seal the issue in an hour and 41 minutes. 

Sania, who registered her second win over a top-10 player with a 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Nadia Petrova of Russia in the second round, will also be richer by $ 12,775. (PTI)

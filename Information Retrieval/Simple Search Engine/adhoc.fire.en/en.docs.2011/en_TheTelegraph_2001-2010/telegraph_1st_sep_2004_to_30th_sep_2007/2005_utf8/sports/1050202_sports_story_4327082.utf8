 Kabuki Cup for La Fantasie Daniel 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: La Fantasie finally made it to the winner?s enclosure on Tuesday. In the 1,200m Kabuki Cup, the 14-10 favourite never faced a serious threat from any of her eight rivals inside the last furlong, as she went about her task after taking charge of running from a quietly fancied Ever Lasting Love. 

 The Daniel David-trained filly had let down followers in three of her earlier four starts this season. Imran Chisty partnered the Predappio-La Rucherie daughter. The visiting jockey ended the day with a treble having earlier triumphed on Errol Bhungard?s Dream Sovereign and Magical Strike, also from Daniel?s yard. 

 Jockey C. Alford and trainer H.S.Bath were the other professionals who had a profitable afternoon with a double apiece. Alford guided Vijay Singh?s Romantic Liaison to a bloodless victory in the baby race, the 1,400m Scone Stone Plate, and also helped Bath?s Allenby canter home in the INS Hooghly Cup. A less fancied Advancer, in the concluding event, the Go Careful Handicap had made Bath?s day.

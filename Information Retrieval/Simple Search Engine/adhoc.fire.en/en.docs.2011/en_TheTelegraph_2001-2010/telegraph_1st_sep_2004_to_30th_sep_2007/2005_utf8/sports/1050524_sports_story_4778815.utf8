 Bhowmick to continue in EB hot seat 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick has agreed to continue as East Bengal coach for another season. The uncertainty over his association with the club arose after Bhowmick had expressed his desire to take a sabbatical after the current season got over. 

Bhowmick had wanted to go on an educative tour, preferably in Europe, to get a first-hand experience of modern football and upgrade his coaching wisdom. 

The club officials, who met him on Monday, however, decided to let Bhowmick go on his educative tour, but retained him as coach for the next season. 

Bhowmick felt honoured by the clubs offer and informed his foreign trip would span around three-to four weeks. He had approached 22 countries, of which seven had responded positively.

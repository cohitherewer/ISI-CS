 Chelsea reaping feud harvest

 - Arsenal and United are the Tom and Jerry of English football 

PAUL HAYWARD 

 Nobody can convey loathing through his eyes, mouth and nose like Wayne Rooney 

Arsenal and Manchester United have become the Tom and Jerry of English football, but without the comedy. The continuation of the game?s most bitter feud concealed the fact that these two colossal institutions are almost certainly chasing the Premiership?s silver medal. 

The police, the sports minister and the chief executive of the Premier League all tried to instil some dignity into the Arsenal-United ballyhoo, but their energies were wasted. 

Venom, hostility and a raging urge to win are built into the structure of these north-south collisions. But the rivalry grows ever more craven. When Patrick Vieira collapsed under an innocuous challenge from Wayne Rooney shortly before half-time, it was reasonable to speculate that the Arsenal captain was attempting to make immediate capital out of Rooney?s booking. 

Yes, we saw it all: belligerence in the tunnel, non-handshakes, diving, a second-half red card for Mikael Silvestre for butting Freddie Ljungberg and repeated attempts to manipulate the referee, Graham Poll, who officiated with commendable aggression. Rooney screwed his face up so many times that he probably needed to iron it after the match. Nobody can convey loathing through his eyes, mouth and nose like England?s most gifted young striker. Twice, after his caution, Rooney appeared to tell Poll to eff-off. 

The problem is, mayhem?s bar has been raised so high for Arsenal-United games that we tend to dismiss the minor misdemeanours as mere detail. Together, they form of pattern of dishonour. If these two clubs were unruly teenagers fighting on a basketball court, the arresting officer would soon tire of the self-justification. 

These games are a minor championship within a league title race: a twice-yearly duel that consumes both sets of players. The outcome can have a major bearing on the wider power struggle. Before last night, Arsenal had played 14 Premiership matches since the latest Battle of Old Trafford, and won only seven: a respectable ratio for mere mortals, but no great shakes for a team who had gone 49 league matches unbeaten before United put their studs into the sequence. 

Chelsea?s form has been imperious ? yet how much closer would the title race be now had The Gunners not been bundled off their gilded road by the rough tackling of Sir Alex Ferguson?s men? 

Only with the publication of Chelsea?s latest accounts do we see the distorting effects of Roman Abramovich?s billions. Overnight, two dominant English clubs have become desperate pursuers, chasing Chelsea?s tail lights into spring and summer. The duopoly is dead. 

How those figures bounced off Abramovich?s fortune, like ping-pong balls: an ?87.8 million loss, an annual wage bill of ?115.5 million. 

Neither Arsenal nor their eternal foe have done much wrong. Both clubs have scoured the world for talent, spending within their means, It?s simply that their Tom and Jerry routine has been disrupted by he emergence of a much bigger beast: a Russian Spike, the bulldog in the cartoon. Maybe the two title-hoggers thought they would go on exchanging Premiership titles until hell froze over. Abramovich was a freak of history, and Jose Mourinho, the Chelsea manager, may not be far behind. 

Compressed on both sides by Abramovich?s billions and United?s relentless league form, Arsenal have loosened their grip. The feud is compelling, but no longer palatable. Old fashioned aggression and hostility have been eclipsed by the dark arts. Here, too, Chelsea are winning the argument.

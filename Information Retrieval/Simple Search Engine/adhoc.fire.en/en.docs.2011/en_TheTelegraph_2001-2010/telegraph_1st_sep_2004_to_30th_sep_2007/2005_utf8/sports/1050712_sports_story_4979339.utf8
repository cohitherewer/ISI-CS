 Mahindra job for Perreira

Mumbai: Mahindra United on Monday signed up former international defender Derrick Perreira as their new coach for the season ahead for an undisclosed sum. 

We are determined to win the National Football League in the next season and are signing up Perreira as our new coach towards this end. We are confident his strategic excellence would guide the team towards our goal, president of the Mumbai club, Alan Durante, said at a press conference here after Perreira signed on the dotted line. 

Perreira replaces Syed Nayeemuddin from the Mahindra hot seat. Durante said the club had managed to retain most of the top Indian players, including S. Venkatesh, and is planning to rope in some good strikers from overseas.

 Inzy fined for slow over-rate 

London: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has been fined for the team?s slow over-rate during their one-day tri-series victory over the West Indies on Tuesday. 

International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee Chris Broad ruled that Inzamam had failed to ensure his team played ?within the spirit of the game? at the WACA in Perth, an ICC statement said. 

He was fined his entire match fee and another 30 per cent for slow over-rate itself. The rest of the team were fined 15 per cent of their match fees. 

No appeals are allowed against Level II breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct. Pakistan won the match by 30 runs to reach the best-of-three finals against Australia. (Reuters)

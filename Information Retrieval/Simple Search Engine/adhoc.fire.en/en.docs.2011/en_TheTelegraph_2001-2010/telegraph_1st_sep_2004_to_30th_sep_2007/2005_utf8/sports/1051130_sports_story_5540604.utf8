The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indias turnaround has been stunning

Guest Column

In the end it was a fair, even result. South Africa went away feeling good that they adjusted quickly to alien conditions and came within a whisker of winning the first-ever series in India. 

The hosts, on their part, showed resilience in keeping up with the punishing schedule of recent weeks and recovering lost ground. Both have made progress and are formidable one-day units. They are the teams in form. 

The fifth match was not an easy one. Indian batsmen might have been denied the dew factor as it did not hamper the rival bowlers, but there is no denying that the wicket suited their slow bowlers to the hilt in the afternoon. It would be unfair not to mention Yuvraj Singh for he has been very impressive. He has got a great pair of hands and I really liked the way he played under pressure in the series. 

In the past he might have taken on too much but the new Yuvraj seems nicely tempered between aggression and caution. His footwork and shot selection has improved enormously. He has a star presence in one-day cricket where he makes critical contribution in the field and with bat, not to forget his spin bowling which could be extremely handy for the Indians in 2007 World Cup. 

The turnaround in Indias one-day form has been stunning and credit must go where it is due. It would appear that under the new team management and fresh young talents, a cohesive, powerful unit is in the making. 

South Africa too are under a hungry, young leader and has players who can perform. Their fielding is probably the best in the world and if they could perk up their batting a notch or two higher, it would only help them grow further. As it is, they are making the world take notice of their progress. There is no reason for Indians to feel despondent on Sachin for the little great man seems only an innings away from good form. 

Virender Sehwag too would soon chalk up a big score given the way he has been middling the ball and hitting the pickets. If you count the rest of the batters, Gambhirs and Dravids, Yuvrajs and Kaifs, it has a meaty look to it. And we have not still come to discussing Dhonis and Pathans!Well done India, keep it up.

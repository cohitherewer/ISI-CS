 Karthikeyan gearing up for a neck-breaking experience

 - Anti-clockwise track at Interlagos has character 

Sao Paulo: Having tasted success in his new car, Narain Karthikeyan looks forward to keep the momentum going by setting a good grid position at the neck-breaking Interlagos track ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix. 

I drove the new EJ15B car for the first time and got one of my best finishes of the season. In Brazil, I really want to concentrate on getting a good result in qualifying on which I can build for the race, Karthikeyan, who finished 11th at Spa-Francorchamps, said. 

The 28-year-old Jordan driver said the Brazilian Grand Prix was not so much about the track, but about the stress it places on neck as it is one of only three circuits of the year that goes anti-clockwise along with Imola and Istanbul. 

Dont say track, say neck in Brazil! This is an anti-clockwise track which makes it a bit harder on the drivers neck muscles, Karthikeyan explained. 

Ive been working very hard on building up strength in my neck and feel very well prepared. 

After so many races this season it wont be too much of a shock. But there are still quite a few bumps on the track which can be tough on the lower back. 

In terms of set-up you need as much grip as possible for the corners but as little downforce as you can get away with for straightline speed, he said. 

However, Karthikeyan arrived in Brazil with a smile and calm sense of familiarity. Its good to be back here after racing at Interlagos in the 2002 World Series by Nissan. 

In that race, I set a new lap record for my series. I know that the organisers have resurfaced the track and modified some dangerous parts since then, but that just means it should be easier, the Indian said. 

However, its still quite unpredictable because of the weather. It should be fine, but theres a chance it could rain like it did in Spa. 

Karthikeyan believes the weekends race will be very competitive with at least five former champions of these track in contention on the grid. 

Interlagos definitely has character. Interlagos always has a great crowd. The fans here create a really special atmosphere which I really love. It should be a really competitive race as there will be five drivers on the grid who have won the Brazilian Grand Prix before. 

Juan Pablo Montoya won last years race while Fisichella claimed victory in 2003. Michael Schumacher has won the Brazilian Grand Prix four times while David Coulthard and Jacques Villeneuve have both won it once. 

Karthikeyan also took the opportunity to wish his countrymen well in the opening race of the new A1 Grand Prix series this weekend at Brands Hatch, in the UK.

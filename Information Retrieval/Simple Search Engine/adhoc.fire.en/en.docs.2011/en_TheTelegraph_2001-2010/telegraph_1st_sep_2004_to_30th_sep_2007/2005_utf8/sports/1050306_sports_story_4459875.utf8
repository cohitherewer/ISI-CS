 ?F1 risks being ripped apart? 

Melbourne: Minardi boss Paul Stoddart warned that Formula One risked being ripped apart after he and the sport?s governing body waged a war of words on Saturday at the Australian Grand Prix. 

?As far as I am concerned what we are doing here is rapidly pushing the Formula One world championship to its destruction,? the Australian said. 

Sporting politics hung heavily over the event, despite Stoddart dropping legal action against the FIA that would have allowed him to qualify with cars that did not conform to the regulations. Minardi modified their cars overnight and competed according to the rules. (Reuters)

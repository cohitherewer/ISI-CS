The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia remains undecided

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia is in town. The Indian soccer icon made a surprise visit to the press box during the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match with wife Madhuri and for all of 90 minutes, was attention personified. 

Terming his three-month stint with Malaysian team MK Land fruitful, Bhaichung said, It was necessary for me from a professional point of view. 

I am much fitter now and raring to go. 

Bhaichung, however, refused to divulge whether he will don a red-and-gold or a green-and-maroon shirt. 

I know there are a lot of rumours going around but I will only decide on the first week of October, he said, adding I am here on a weeks visit.

 Kevin Keegan quits City

 Kevin Keegan is set to walk away from football 

London: Former England manager Kevin Keegan left Manchester City on Friday after four years in charge and is set to walk away from football. 

The 54-year-old former Newcastle United boss had been due to retire from football management when his contract at the Premier League club expired at the end of next season. 

?Manchester City football club announces that by mutual agreement our manager Kevin Keegan will leave the club with immediate effect. We all believe that this is in the best interest of the club,? a statement on City?s website said. 

City are 12th in the 20-team league after a largely disappointing season. 

City coach and former England defender Stuart Pearce will take charge for the remaining nine games of the season and could be in the running for the permanent position. (Reuters)

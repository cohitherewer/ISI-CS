 Chance for James Anderson to reverse fortunes

 - If test pitches suit seamers, England will stick to 4 fast bowlers with 

 Giles as lone spinner

James Anderson returned to action for England in Rawalpindi with the chance to lay the ghost of what he concedes was the most harrowing match of his career. It was last January in Johannesburg where Anderson, the 23-year-old Lancashire fast bowler, suffered his darkest hour and he has not played for England since. 

Although England won that fourth Test match in South Africa, Anderson had a difficult match, conceding 149 runs off only 34 overs, and at times he was barely able to land the ball on the cut strip. Even when he took one of his two wickets he appeared embarrassed by his success. 

The remedy, the England selectors decided, was a season of good honest toil in County cricket. The results were steady rather than spectacular but when Simon Jones pulled out of the last Ashes Test of the summer with an ankle injury, Anderson was drafted in, although he did not play. 

Anderson had, however, done enough to convince the selectors that he was worth another try on tour, winning a place in the squad for Pakistan, and when Jones withdrew from the trip to have surgery on his right ankle, he became first choice if England require a four-man pace attack during the three-Test series. 

Englands other fast-bowling option on tour is Liam Plunkett, the inexperienced Durham bowler, leaving Anderson with every chance to add to the 12 caps he has won since he burst on to the scene amid great excitement in 2003. 

Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, is hoping to play all 14 of the present squad in the opener against a Patrons XI. Something closer to the Test line-up will then take on Pakistan A in the last warm-up match in Lahore, starting on Sunday. 

Fletcher said on Sunday that he was having to approach the two three-day matches with an open mind for the balance of the side. If the Test pitches suit the seam bowlers, England will stick to the familiar format of four fast bowlers supported by Ashley Giles as the lone spinner. 

If, however, rumours are true and Pakistans groundsmen produce surfaces to help the home spinners, England may have to sacrifice a fast bowler to play a second spinner ? almost certainly Shaun Udal, the 36-year-old. 

That could lead to Paul Collingwood, the Durham allrounder, being asked to fill the role of fourth seam bowler at the expense of Ian Bell. 

We will have to look at the options if we want to play two spinners: whether we use Collingwood as a bowler, Fletcher said. Thats quite critical and will have to be debated. The Ian Bell area is the one we might have to look at, but we still want to look at him as a batsman. 

After scoring freely against Bangladesh last summer, Bell had a lean time against Australia, making only two half-centuries in the five Tests, averaging 17 and finishing with a pair in the final match at the Oval. 

The tour matches are an important opportunity for all of them: Jimmy, Liam Plunkett, who looks a good player in the making, Alex Loudon, who has done well, and Shaun Udal even ? its important for him coming back at this stage, Fletcher said. 

Pakistan are expected to let both their leg-spinners, Danish Kaneria and Mushtaq Ahmed, loose on England in the Test series, but Fletcher insists that his players should not be fazed by such a challenge. 

I am very confident we will handle the spinners, he said. I believe we handled Shane Warne very well last summer and the batsmen have had experience against quality spinners, so Im pretty happy we will again. It is difficult to beat Pakistan in Pakistan and we have to back up what we did last summer. But Im confident we can do that. 

Whichever batsman misses out at the start of the Test series, opportunities are likely to arise by the end of it. Andrew Strauss has been given permission to fly home for the birth of his first child, which is due on November 28, the day before the start of the third Test.

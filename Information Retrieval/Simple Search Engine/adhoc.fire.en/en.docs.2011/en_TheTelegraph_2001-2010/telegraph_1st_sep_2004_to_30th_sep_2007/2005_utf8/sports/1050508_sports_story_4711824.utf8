The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. clinch rough tie

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Mohammedan Sporting beat fellow-Calcuttans Ever-Ready 1-0 but not before the second division group B National Football League tie saw three players being marched off. 

In a match marred by frayed tempers and rough play, referee M. Jaychandra Singh flashed the red card to Mohammedan Sporting duo Sheikh Habib Ali and Amjad Ali Khan, and Ever-Readys Shankho Roychowdhury. 

The two teams, both equally desperate to win, clashed in the dying moments of the match. As Habib Ali was pushed hard by an Ever-Ready defender, Mohammedan Sporting players rushed in their teammates aid. All hell broke loose as Habib Ali clashed with Roychowdhury. A few blows were exchanged before the referees intervention ended the fight. 

The arguments went on for some time and the Keenan Stadium crowd, made up mostly of Mohammedan Sporting fans, got restive. Thankfully, the match ended without further trouble. 

Jiten Rai got Mohammedan Sportings winner in the 49th minute. He tapped in a cross Madhusudan Majumdar cross from the left. In the other match, at the J.R.D. Tata Sports Complex, Hindustan FC defeated Lajong Sports Club 2-0. 

PTI adds from Chennai: An injury time goal by Satish (Sr) helped Bangalore outfit HAL get the better of BSF in group A action. In the other match Air India held on to a fifth-minute goal by Javed Ansari to beat Bengal Mumbai Football Club.

Calcutta: Keeping in mind the inclusion of the 8-ball pool event in the 2006 Doha Asian Games, the Billiards and Snooker Federation of India (BSFI) has decided to stage its inaugural championship (singles) for men and women during the last week of July in Delhi. 

?Since our players are not accustomed to playing this format, we have decided to prepare them for the Asian Games,? BSFI secretary C. Kapur told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The country?s top cue sport players will almost certainly take part in the Delhi event ? from Asian snooker champion Alok Kumar, junior national No. 2 snooker player Sourav Kothari, Devendra Joshi, Manan Chandra to Dharmendra Lilly, Ashok Shandilya, Brijesh Damani. 

?Only Pankaj?s (Advani) participation is not confirmed, but we are expecting him to play as well,? Kapur stated. 

The top women cueists ? Anuja Thakur, Meenal Thakur, Vidya Pillai, Heena Khandelwal, Ashwini Puranik, R. Uma Devi ? will also be vying for glory. 

Simultaneously with the 8-ball pool, BSFI will be organising the three-cushion carom board meet, which has also been included in the Doha Games. 

The participants will be the same set of players. 

The 9-ball national pool championship, informed Kapur, will be held in Mumbai mid-September.

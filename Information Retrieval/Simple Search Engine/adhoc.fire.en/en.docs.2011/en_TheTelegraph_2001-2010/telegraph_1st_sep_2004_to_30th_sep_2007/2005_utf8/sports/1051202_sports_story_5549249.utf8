 Paul rocks Delhi with half-dozen

 - Bengal lose two wickets before stumps 

 Paul took six for 25 

New Delhi: Medium-pacer Shib Shankar Pauls six-wicket haul helped Bengal bundle out Delhi for 148 in the Elite group A Ranji match on Thursday. By stumps, though, the hosts reduced Bengal to 11 for two. 

Off-spinner Sarandeep Singh sent back Arindam Das and leggie Chetanya Nanda castled nightwatchman Shib Sagar Singh after the Delhi batsmen had put up a pathetic show. 

Opting for first strike, Delhi slumped to 34 for three and never really recovered. 

The underprepared wicket was designed to favour spinners, but it was the steady seamers of Paul which did the damage. Paul returned dream figures of six for 25 off 17 overs. 

Paul struck in his fifth over when he had discarded Test opener Akash Chopra caught-behind by Deep Dasgupta for nought. Shikhar Dhawans agonising 90-minute stay produced just two runs before off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri clean-bowled him. 

Lahiri then took the wicket of Varun Kumar and had figures for two for 59. 

The pace-spin combination rattled the hosts as they went into defensive mode and failed to built any decent partnership. The batsmen spent quite some time in the middle but failed to push the scorecard along.

 Dhoni stars in Indian win

 Dhoni hit unbeaten 86 off 81 balls 

Colombo: Team India sent warning signals to their rivals ahead of the tri-series, trouncing a Sri Lanka XI by 61 runs in a warm-up match at the Nondescripts Cricket Club ground in Colombo on Monday. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni did the star turn for the tourists, hitting a swashbuckling unbeaten 86 off 81 balls as India amassed 247 for the loss of eight wickets. Along with Mohammed Kaif (52), Dhoni steadied the Indian ship after the Rahul Dravid-led side were in trouble on 104 for four. 

The captain failed to find his touch (5) but Kaif and Dhoni added 56 before Kaif fell to Pradeep Jayaprakashdaran, the pick of the Sri Lanka XI bowlers with three for 35. Fresh from his County stint at the Middlesex, Irfan Pathan then ripped through the Sri Lanka XI top order, reducing the hosts to 70 for six. 

Pathan then wrapped up the tail (4/42) to keep the Indians in high spirits ahead of their season-opening series.

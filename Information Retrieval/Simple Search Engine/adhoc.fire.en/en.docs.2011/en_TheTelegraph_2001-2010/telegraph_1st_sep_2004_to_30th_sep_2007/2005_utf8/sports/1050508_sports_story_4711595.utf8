 Ramit bags U-15 crown

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ramit Tandon won the boys under-15 crown at the Indian Oil-Otters Open squash meet in Mumbai Saturday. 

According to information received here, the 12-year-old outplayed Delhis Ravi Dixit 9-6, 9-3, 9-5 in the final. Tandon had earlier ousted Chennai lad Karan Malik in the last-four stage. 

Tandon tried his luck in the under-17 category, too, falling in the quarter finals but not before giving No. 3 seed Cyrus Vakil a run for his money. Vakil won in five sets. 

The senior titles were clinched by the two favourites, Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa. 

Ghosal beat Delhis Gaurav Nandrajog 9-0, 9-4, 9-2 in the mens final. He completed a double crown, having earlier outsmarted Manek Mathur 9-5, 9-6, 9-2 in the under-19 boys final. 

In the womens title-round, Joshna started a bit hesitantly against Deepali Anvekar of Maharashtra before ultimately winning 10-8, 9-5, 9-5.

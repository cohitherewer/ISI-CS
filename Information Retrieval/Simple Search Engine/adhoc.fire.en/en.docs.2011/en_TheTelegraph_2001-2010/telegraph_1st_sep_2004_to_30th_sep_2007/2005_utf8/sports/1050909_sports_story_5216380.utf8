London: Englands World Cup hopes suffered a shock setback at the hands of neighbours Northern Ireland on Wednesday, the Group VI favourites slumping to their first defeat in Belfast for 78 years. 

In the biggest surprise of the nights 24 European zone qualifiers Northern Ireland, who had gone four years without a competitive home win before Saturdays 2-0 victory over Azerbaijan, were not flattered by their 1-0 success. A toothless England side barely manufactured a chance all night. 

That result handed the Group VI initiative to Poland, who beat Wales 1-0 in Warsaw. Of course Im very sorry, disappointed, as the players are, England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson told reporters. Sorry for the team, sorry for the three points we lost, sorry for the fans who paid a lot of money to travel here. 

France won their Dublin showdown as Thierry Henrys goal beat Ireland 1-0 but Group IV remains too tight to call after Switzerland and Israel also won to keep it at one point between the top three. 

Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands all edged closer to next years finals in Germany but Croatias smooth progress was brought to a halt when they were held to a shock 1-1 draw in Malta. Serbia amp; Montenegro conceded their first goal in eight qualifiers, but hit back for a 1-1 draw in Spain that leaves them firmly on course to reach the finals for the first time. 

England had never lost a World Cup or European championship qualifier under Swedish coach Eriksson but looked bereft of ideas against a team largely made up of lower league players in Belfast. 

David Healys angled drive in the 73rd minute left England on 19 points, five adrift of Poland, but they can still win the group with home wins over Austria and Poland next month and are guaranteed at least a playoff slot after Austria could only draw 0-0 in Azerbaijan. 

Poland beat Wales with a second-half Maciej Zurawski penalty and look likely to qualify at least as one of the two best runners-up if not group winners and will win the group with a draw against England in their final game. 

France continued their return to form with a hard-fought victory, courtesy Henrys 67th-minute curler. Frances victory was the first in any of the games between the four main Group IV rivals and pushes the 1998 world champions to the forefront of what remains the tightest European group.

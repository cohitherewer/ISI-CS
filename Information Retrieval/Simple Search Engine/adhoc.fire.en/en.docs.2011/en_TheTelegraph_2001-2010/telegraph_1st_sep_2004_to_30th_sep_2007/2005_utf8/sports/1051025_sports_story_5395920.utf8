Madrid: Getafe crushed Real Zaragoza 5-2 to go top of the Primera Liga on Sunday, leapfrogging Real Madrid who had David Beckham and Thomas Gravesen sent off in a dramatic 1-2 home defeat by Valencia. 

Zinedine Zidane missed an early penalty in the Bernabeu and that proved costly when Valencias Ruben Baraja scored from a free-kick in the 22nd minute. Raul levelled for Real in the 36th minute, but David Villa restored the lead from the penalty spot almost immediately. 

Real finished the game with nine men after England midfielder Beckham and Denmark midfielder Gravesen were sent off towards the end. 

Getafe are on top with 17 points, a point ahead of Celta Vigo who beat Espanyol 1-0. 

Real are third on 15 points, Valencia and Osasuna who are fourth and fifth, respectively. 

Barcelona, who beat Osasuna 3-0 on Saturday, are sixth with 13 points. 

Real Madrid were awarded a penalty after just eight minutes when Valencias Italian defender Emiliano Moretti pushed Real central defender Sergio Ramos in the area during a free-kick. 

With leading scorer Ronaldo out injured, Zidane stepped up to take the spot kick but he hit the outside of the post. 

Valencia effectively stifled Real in the second half and Reals lack of possession and inability to create clear chances led to fraying tempers. 

Gravesen earned a straight red card nine minutes from time, just after coming on the field as a substitute, for a cynical foul. Beckham earned two quick yellow cards in the 87th minute. He was first booked for dissent and then shown a second by referee Arturo Dauden Ibanez for applauding the decision. 

In Italy, injury-plagued Filippo Inzaghi scored his first Serie A goal in 19 months to give second-placed AC Milan a 2-1 victory over Palermo on Sunday, while leaders Juventus remained five points clear thanks to a 3-0 win at Lecce. 

Third-placed Inter Milan also won with Argentine Julio Ricardo Cruz scoring in their 1-0 victory at Udinese. Sampdoria were held 3-3 at home by Siena. 

Andrea Caracciolo put Palermo ahead at the San Siro in the 28th minute before Milan drew level within two minutes thanks to a fine strike from midfielder Gennaro Gattuso. Inzaghis diving header secured the three points and his first goal since March 2004. 

At Romes Olympic Stadium, Roma seemed on course to pick up only their third win of the season when Francesco Totti fired them ahead five minutes before the break. 

In the 57th minute Lazios Brazilian winger Cesar broke down the right and crossed for Tommaso Rocchi to nod in the equaliser. 

There was little other to note until the 74th minute, when Lazio won a free-kick close to Romas area. 

As Paparesta positioned the ball, an object hit him. He was unhurt and play resumed quickly, though the incident recalled the volatile nature of football matches in the Italian capital in general.

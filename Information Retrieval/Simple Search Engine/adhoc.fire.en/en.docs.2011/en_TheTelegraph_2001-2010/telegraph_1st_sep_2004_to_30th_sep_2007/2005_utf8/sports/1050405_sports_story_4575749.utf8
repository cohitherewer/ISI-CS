 Sporting down Fransa 2-0

Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa kept themselves in the title race after scoring a convincing 2-0 win over Fransa in the 15th round of the National Football League for ONGC Cup on Monday. 

Sporting, who led 2-0 at half time, scored through their foreign recruits Edeh Chidi (37th) and captain Dudu Omagbemi at the Nehru Stadium.

The win took Sporting to 29 points from 15 matches behind East Bengal (33) and Dempo (31) while Fransa dropped to fifth place behind JCT with 22 points from 15 matches. 

Edeh Chidi was declared Man-of-the-Match. 

Dudu Omagbemi, who scored a hattrick in Sporting?s impressive 4-0 win over Fransa in the first leg, once again played centre stage as he troubled the rival defence alongwith Chidi. (PTI)

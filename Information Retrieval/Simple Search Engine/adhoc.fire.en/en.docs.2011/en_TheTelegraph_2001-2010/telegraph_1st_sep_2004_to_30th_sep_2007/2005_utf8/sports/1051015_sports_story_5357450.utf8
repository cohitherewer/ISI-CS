 Bhattacharya to officiate as fourth umpire

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Aloke Bhattacharya will officiate as the fourth umpire in two one day Internationals during the series against Sri Lanka and South Africa. 

The CAB umpire will discharge his duties in the third one-dayer against Maravan Atapattus side in Jaipur on October 31 and then in the opening ODI against South Africa in Hyderabad on November 16. 

The BCCI has formed a six-man panel out of 20 umpires who will officiate as fourth umpires during upcoming international matches at home. Bhattacharya is the lone representative from the state in this panel. 

Another Bengal umpire, Francis Gomes, is, however, on the list of BCCI-appointed 20 umpires.

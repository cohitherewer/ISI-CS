Sheffield: Young English qualifier Shaun Murphy won the world snooker title on Monday after completing a thrilling 18-16 victory over Welshman Matthew Stevens at the Crucible Theatre. 

Murphy, ranked 48 in the world, became the first qualifier to win the tournament since Terry Griffiths in 1979. The 22-year-old received a cheque for ?250,000 ($475,800). 

It was a second defeat in a world final for Stevens, the sixth seed, who was beaten by Mark Williams five years ago. 

After the match, Murphy told reporters: ?What a fantastic match it was. I knew I had the capability to win and I just kept going for my shots.? 

The beaten Stevens praised Murphy?s performance. He said: ?It was a cracking match and he held himself together really well towards the end. 

?I?m pleased with the way I played and it?s credit to Shaun for the way he played. He?s got a cracking future.? 

Stevens remains confident of winning the world title one day. ?I will win the tournament before I finish, it?s just a question of when,? he said. ?I?m only 27 and I?ve got plenty of time.? 

Murphy came back from 6-10 down overnight, winning five out of the seven frames played in the afternoon, to trail by just a frame at 12-11 going into the final session. 

Murphy produced a 107 clearance in the opening frame of the evening to level and then made a break of 55 in frame 25 to go in front for only the second time in the match. 

Stevens responded with a 95 break to level at 13-13, but Murphy claimed the next two frames to regain the lead and he maintained his two-frame advantage at 16-14. 

Following some high quality snooker from both players, Stevens knocked in breaks of 124 and 52 to level at 16-16. 

But a run of 97 in the following frame saw Murphy edge ahead again and he clinched victory with an 83 break. (Reuters)

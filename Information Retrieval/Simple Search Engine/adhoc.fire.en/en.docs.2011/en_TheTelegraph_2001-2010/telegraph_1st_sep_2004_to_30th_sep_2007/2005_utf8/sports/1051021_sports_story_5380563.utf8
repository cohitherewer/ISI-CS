 Mushtaq, Shoaib among probables

 - SERIES vs ENGLAND- Four leggies in 25-strong Pak list 

 Mushtaq Ahmed 

Karachi: Pakistan have included leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar among probables for a training camp in preparation for the three-Test home series against England next month. 

Mushtaq, 35, who has been ignored by the selectors for the last two years, and Shoaib are included in a squad of 25 for the camp starting in Lahore on Friday. 

He (Mushtaq) has been called to the camp and will play in a four-day practice game next week so that we can judge his form and fitness, captain Inzamam-ul Haq said. 

Mushtaq, who was displaced in the national team by leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, has taken 185 wickets in 52 Tests. He last played for Pakistain against South Africa in October 2003. 

Two other young leg-spinners ? Mansoor Amjad and Imran Tahir ? have also been invited to the camp. 

Inzamam said Shoaib, who has not represented his country since January this year, would also play in the practice game. Although he looks fitter and more motivated we need to play those who are 100 per cent fit, he said. 

The other notable inclusion is paceman Umer Gul, who last played against India in April 2004 before being sidelined by a stress fracture of the back. 

THE PROBABLES 

Inzamam-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Mohammed Yusuf, Shoaib Malik, Salman Butt, Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Rana Naved-ul Hassan, Mohammed Sami, Shoaib Akhtar, Umer Gul, Shabbir Ahmed, Faisal Iqbal, Hasan Reza, Mohammed Asif, Shahid Nazir, Mushtaq Ahmed, Danish Kaneria, Imran Tahir, Mansoor Amjad, Imran Farhat, Bazid Khan, Asim Kamal, Arshad Khan.

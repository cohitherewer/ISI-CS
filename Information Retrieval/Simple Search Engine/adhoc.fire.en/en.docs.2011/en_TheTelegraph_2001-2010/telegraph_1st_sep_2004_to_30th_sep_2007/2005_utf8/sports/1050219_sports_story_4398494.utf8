 Harbhajan may be in the clear

New Delhi: There are indications that off-spinner Harbhajan Singh will be eligible for selection for the upcoming Indo-Pak series. 

Harbhajan was reported for his action while bowling the doosra by Match Referee Chris Broad, during India?s series against Bangladesh in December. He subsequently went to Australia for testing and for corrective measures if necessary. 

It is learnt that the results of those analyses, though yet to be released officially, do conform to be within the ICC-prescribed limits. 

ICC spokesman Jon Long said they were awaiting the report, scheduled to be forwarded by the BCCI. 

?Under the process in which Harbhajan was reported the procedure is that the ICC will receive a report from the player?s home board, in this case the BCCI, approaching the end of the process they have undertaken. In this case the deadline is February 25. The ICC is in no way involved in the process that the home board undertakes,? he said. 

He did not confirm whether Harbhajan had indeed been cleared at this juncture.

Jarno Trulli of Toyota was second with 1:29.993, and Michael Schumacher, who drove Ferrari?s 2005 car, was third with 1:30.237. 

Karthikeyan said the track suited his style of driving and he felt positive about his performance. 

?I really like the circuit here in Bahrain, it suits my style of driving,? he said after the first qualifying session. ?I have been pretty quick well on the track which is rather dusty and today we were feeling the wind too. The air and track temperatures were very high. So I am happy with my performance.? 

The decisive final session is on Sunday.

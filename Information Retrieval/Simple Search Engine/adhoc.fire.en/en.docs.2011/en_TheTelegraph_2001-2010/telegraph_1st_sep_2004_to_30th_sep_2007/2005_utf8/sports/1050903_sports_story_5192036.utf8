The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Honour for Steve Waugh

Sydney: Steve Waugh was named Australian Father of the Year Friday in recognition of his charity work with children. 

Its a massive honour, said Waugh, 40 and a father of three, after the award was announced here. It came as a bit of a surprise to me, but I feel really honoured to be part of it all. 

The honour is bestowed each year by the Australian Fathers Day Council, which works in support of a Sydney-based childrens charity, the Shepherd Center. 

Waugh, Test crickets most successful captain, retired from the sport in 2004, when he was also named Australian of the Year. 

The new honour recognised Waugh for his contribution to the lives of children, both as a role model and through his charity work. 

When I was first confronted by a leper colony in India, I had just become a dad for the first time and it really just hit home to me, Waugh, who is associated with Udayan in Calcutta, said. 

I just felt like I had to do something to help.

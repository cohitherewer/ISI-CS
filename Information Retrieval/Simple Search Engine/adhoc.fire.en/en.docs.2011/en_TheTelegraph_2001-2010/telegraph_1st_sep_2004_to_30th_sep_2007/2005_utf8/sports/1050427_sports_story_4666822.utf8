London: A first-half goal by Jose Antonio Reyes gave Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Tottenham ? and kept Chelsea waiting to secure the league title. 

Chelsea would have clinched the title if Arsenal had failed to beat neighbours Spurs at Highbury Monday night. Instead, the Gunners cut the Blues? lead to 11 points with four games left. 

Chelsea can clinch their first championship in 50 years by beating Bolton Saturday. The Blues have 85 points, Arsenal 74 and Manchester United 70. 

Arsenal?s victory ? and ninth shutout in 10 league and Cup games ? strengthens their hold on second place. 

Although the Gunners had enough chances to have won by several goals, Spurs could have grabbed a tie near the end. After Robbie Keane headed wide from close range, Tottenham appealed for a penalty when Arsenal defender Ashley Cole appeared to touch the ball with his hand as he fell inside the area. 

After Reyes had shot wide in the opening minute, goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rescued the Gunners by blocking a shot from Jermain Defoe. The moment gave Chelsea hope of capturing the title a game earlier than expected. 

But Arsenal went ahead in the 22nd minute when Francesc Fabregas swapped passes with Patrick Vieira and then released Reyes down the left. This time the young Spaniard made no mistake with a low, left foot shot across goalkeeper Paul Robinson and inside the far post. 

Arsenal should have gone further ahead just before half time when Vieira was allowed room in front of goal to meet a free kick by Robin van Persie, but headed wide of the far post from six yards. Gunners defender Philippe Senderos missed a similar chance midway the second half when he headed a free-kick over the bar from a similar range. 

Kolo Toure fired a 35 m free-kick that shaved the crossbar and Brazilian midfielder Edu, making a rare return to the side, curled a left foot shot against the Spurs? post. (AP)

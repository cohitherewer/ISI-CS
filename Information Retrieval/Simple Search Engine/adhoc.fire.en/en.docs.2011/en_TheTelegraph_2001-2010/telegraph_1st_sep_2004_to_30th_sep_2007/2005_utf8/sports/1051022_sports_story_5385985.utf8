The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Amal Dutta promises attacking football 

 - Federation Cup 

 - Bagan open campaign vs Vasco today 

 Rodrigue and Akeem can make a deadly combination 

Margao: Mohun Bagan ? riding their success in the inaugural CFL Premier Division ? start as favourites against Vasco SC when they kick off their campaign in the Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday. 

Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta ? who has steered the club from the brink of relegation from the National Football League last year and engineered back-to-back victory over arch-rivals East Bengal in the Premier Division ? has asserted that his team is out to play pacy football in the tournament. 

Dutta joined the squad on Thursday after he was discharged from a Calcutta hospital where he was admitted following chest pain. 

We have arrived five days back in order to get acclimatised and we are confident of winning against Vasco, Dutta said on Friday. 

A great deal of confidence, he maintained, is being drawn from the wins over East Bengal. 

The wins against East Bengal have boosted our morale and we want to make our impression in the Federation Cup. I have improved the players endurance and stamina and our boys will play pacy football, Dutta said. 

I do not want to underestimate our opponents who are capable of beating us on their given day. We will give our best and hopefully win tomorrow, Dutta stated. 

Though Eduardo Coelho is yet to recover from his eye-sore, the Brazilian defender is likely to play from the start. 

Dutta, however, appeared pleased to have Akeem Abolanle in the squad. Akeem is a quick runner upfront. With Gley Yao Rodrigue in good form, Akeems presence will give the side more attacking varieties, he maintained. 

Vasco, who have made a good impression in their local league, however, will be looking to upset Mohun Bagans calculations. 

Coach Matthew DCosta feels that it would be a tough match but crowd support would work to their advantage. 

I told my boys to be cool and calm and play their own game according to the plan, said DCosta. 

Meanwhile, in another match on Saturday, Salgaocar take on Punjab Police.

 Mongia shines 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly did not get a chance to bat as Glamorgan declared their first innings at 584 for three on the second day of their County championship match. Middlesex, in reply, were 96 for one at close, according to information received here. 

Daniel Cherry scored 226 for Glamorgan. Irfan Pathan failed to pick any wicket. 

Dinesh Mongia scored a fluent 66 to give respectability to Leicestershires first innings score against Worcestershire in a Division Two match. The home side made 225 all out at Leicester. 

In another Division One match, Harbhajan Singh made a quickfire 25 for Surrey against Hampshire on a rain truncated day at Southampton.

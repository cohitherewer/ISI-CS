 Dawn Fraser criticises Warne nomination

Sydney: Swimmer Dawn Fraser has criticised fellow Australian Shane Warnes nomination for a top international sporting award, saying the cricketer does not deserve to win because of a drug offence. 

Warne is one of six athletes nominated for the comeback of the year category for the Laureaus awards. The winner will be announced in Portugal next week. 

Fraser, a multiple Olympic champion, said Warne should not have been nominated because he made his comeback after serving a 12-month ban for a doping offence. 

Shane doesnt deserve to be there, Fraser told The Australian newspaper on Friday. 

I will not vote for anyone who has taken drugs or been banned for drugs. 

Warne was banned from playing for 12 months after testing positive in 2003 for diuretics, which he said he had taken to make himself look slimmer. 

Since his return to international cricket, Warne passed Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan to become the worlds leading wicket-taker in Tests. 

Australias former world surfing champion Layne Beachley also condemned Warnes nomination but Warnes brother and manager Jason later issued a statement saying he deserved to be chosen. 

Shanes nomination by Laureaus world sports awards for the comeback of the year is something Shane is very proud of, the statement read. 

As the award recognises those that have achieved after returning from a set back in their career, Shane is clearly a worthwhile nominee as he has performed to an extremely high level since his return. 

The Laureus world sports awards began five years ago and are now recognised as sports version of the Oscars. 

Awards are made in a several categories with the winners chosen by a select group of international sportsmen and women. 

The other nominees in comeback category are American golfer John Daly, the England cricket team, Japanese judoka Tadahiro Nomura, British long-distance runner Paula Radcliffe and Italian race driver Alessandro Zanardi.

 Qualifying crucial, says Karthikeyan

 - Monaco Grand Prix 

 Narain Karthikeyan 

New Delhi: Narain Karthik-eyan said on Monday he was ready for coming Sundays Monaco Grand Prix challenge even though the race could prove tough for drivers using Bridgestone tyres. 

Karthikeyan, who has never driven in Monaco, was also hopeful that his past experiences of Macao, which is similar to the circuit in Monaco, would come in handy in the sixth F1 race of his career on May 22. 

I cannot wait to drive in Monaco as normally I go well on street circuits. I was fast at Macao when I was racing in F3. Monaco has a great heritage, the 28-year-old Indian said. 

The race will be hard for the Bridgestone tyres but above all for the gearbox because we change gears so often in Monaco, said Karthikeyan, who is one of the drivers using Bridgestone. 

With overtaking in the Monaco circuit likely to pose a challenge, Karthikeyan said qualifying could play a key role in determining the winner. 

Qualifying will also be crucial, as there is nearly no room for overtaking; but I am ready for the challenge, he was quoted as saying in a release issued by his Team Jordan. 

Karthikeyan was preparing hard for the next race following a programme prepared by Gerard Gray, Jordans physical therapist, soon after the Spanish Grand Prix to be ready both physically and mentally for the challenge. 

This focus is developed through particular strategies pursued in and away from the gymnasium environment, Gray said. 

At this time both Narain and Tiago (Monteiro) are entering into an intense training period preparing for the North American races and then of course the two double-headers in July. Its this intensity that develops a strong mental attitude in conjunction with physical fitness, Gray said. 

Jordans sporting director Trevor Carlin was expecting his drivers to fetch some points at Monaco. 

It will be first time for our three drivers on this demanding circuit in a Formula 1 car. Narain, Tiago and Robert (Doornbos) have performed very well in the past in street circuits in junior formulas, Carlin said. 

Therefore I expect Jordan to do better than on traditional track and with fantastic reliability from Toyota, we hope to be around at the finish and may be get some points.

Dambulla: India relied on a clinical allround display to fashion a comprehensive six-wicket victory over a second-string West Indies in the second match of the IndianOil Cup tri-series on Sunday. 

After the bowlers stuck to a tidy spell to bundle out the West Indies for a paltry 178 in 47.4 overs, the batsmen never really looked in danger of messing up the run chase as they overhauled the target with 14 overs to spare in what turned out to be a lopsided floodlit encounter. 

Captain Rahul Dravid (52 not out) cracked his second successive half-century to not only guide his team to victory on a difficult batting track at the Rangiri Stadium but also garner a bonus point. The young Suresh Raina (35) and Yuvraj Singh (28) were the other notable contributors in the low scoring contest. 

The Indians, who had lost to hosts Sri Lanka in the opening match on Saturday, more or less made amends with a more disciplined performance which was bound to boost their confidence level. 

Nothing seemed to go right for the West Indies after opting to bat first as the Indian speedsters exploited the overcast conditions to leave the Caribbean batting in complete disarray. 

Barring Narsingh Deonarine who scored a gritty 41, none of the West Indies batsmen could hang around for long. Harbhajan Singh was the pick of the Indian bowlers with impressive figures of 10-1-24-2 while Ashish Nehra and Virender Sehwag also chipped in with two wickets each. 

Mohammed Kaif (24) and Suresh Raina (35) were the two batsmen who batted in the top three positions and laid the foundation of a comfortable win after vice-captain Sehwag had departed early. 

Sehwag (2) edged a bouncing delivery from Jermaine Lawson for a leg-side catch by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin but Kaif and Raina, a rare Uttar Pradesh pair in the middle, put 65 runs from 62 balls to soothe the nerves. 

Raina had a providential escape when he cut a catch to gully region where Ricardo Powell put down a straightforward chance. 

Thereafter Raina batted crisply and his two successive flicks over square leg against Darren Powell underlined the reasons why he is so much in the news. 

Kaif fell to a catch in the slips off Tino Best and Raina himself tamely patted a catch at short extra cover but the Indians by then had already seen off the threat of new ball. 

Kaif batted for 39 balls for his 24 runs and hit five fours while Raina smashed 35 from 42 balls with five fours. 

MoM Dravid and Yuvraj (28) then put on 61 runs for the fourth wicket off 100 balls and both batted with supreme felicity. Dravid was more prone to play his strokes and did it with utmost authority. 

Yuvraj also put the horror of Saturday behind him and his trademark booming drive were soon flowing. With 36 required to win, Yuvraj played over a straight delivery to be bowled for 28 from 58 balls. 

Earlier, the West Indies lost too many wickets in the first 15 overs and then the spinners, led by Harbhajan, tied them in knots. The West Indies were 32 for 3 in the initial overs which included yet another run-out effected by Raina, who swoo-ped on a flick from Sylvester Joseph and found the batsman short of his crease.

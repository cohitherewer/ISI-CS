The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ricky Ponting to lead World XI 

Sydney: Cricket?s world stars on Sunday signalled their support for victims of the overwhelming Asian tsunami by agreeing to play in the first of two benefit matches in Melbourne next week. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting will lead a World XI which contains five Australians and four Test captains for the match against an Asian XI at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on January 10. 

[That Ponting was strongly favoured to get the captaincy was reported by The Telegraph from Calcutta itself on Sunday.] 

Former Australian captain Steve Waugh will coach and manage the 12-member squad. Champion leg-spinner Shane Warne, who has come out of limited overs retirement to lend his services, joins Australian teammates Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Glenn McGrath and Ponting. 

Other top cricketers in the 12-member squad include Brian Lara and Stephen Fleming, captains of the West Indies and New Zealand, respectively. Darren Gough is the lone Englishman. 

The ASIAN XI will be named on Monday. 

A return match will be played in February in either India or Sri Lanka, the two cricket nations to have endured the worst from the Boxing Day disaster. 

International Cricket Council chief executive Malcolm Speed said he expected the match at the 80,000-capacity MCG to raise ?millions of dollars? through ground entry, sponsorship, television rights, ground collections and a telethon. 

?Cricket is the most popular sport in India and Sri Lanka. It?s important that world wide we step up and show... That we are capable of providing assistance, and capable of providing aid,? Speed said. 

Warne made his Test return from a drugs suspension 

in Galle, an area where thousands of people died and where the cricket ground 

was ravaged by the tsunami.

 Sasikiran in sole lead

 - Kunte shares second spot 

 Abhijit Kunte came up with hard-fought win 

New Delhi: Top seed Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran celebrated his birthday in style beating overnight joint leader International Master R.R. Laxman to take sole lead after seven rounds in the Parsvanath International Open chess tournament here Friday. 

Another title aspirant, GM Abhijit Kunte, who drew Laxman in the previous round in just 10 moves, came up with a hard fought win over seasoned IM D.V. Prasad to be joint second. IMs S. Satyapragyan, Deep Sengupta and Enamul Hossain of Bangladesh with six points, half a point behind Sasikiran, share the second spot with Kunte in this 11-round tournament played at the Bapu Samaj Seva Kendra. 

Former title holder R.B. Ramesh, Dibyendu Barua and Alexander Fominyh of Uzbekistan also registered convincing wins with white pieces against their lower-ranked opponents. Sasikiran, the highest-rated opponent ever played by Laxman, employed the Nimzo Indian opening against the national blitz champion who was looking for a draw. 

He sacrificed his knight in the middle game but Sasikiran lured him with a pawn and caught Laxman on the wrong foot in the king-pawn endgame to win in 66 moves. 

The top board game saw Sasikiran give Laxman a couple of chances, but his inexperience cost him dearly. He was also awestruck by his star opponent. (PTI)

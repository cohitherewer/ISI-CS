 Magical strikes down Sanskara 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Magical Strike, from trainer Daniel Davids yard, struck a severe blow for the Classic filly, Sanskara, while handing the hot-favourite a shade under two-length defeat in Fridays feature event, the 1,400m Harry The Horse Cup. Apprentice Gajender Singh partnered the winner.

 The fillys connections blamed it on the soft going for an under-par performance of the Dont Forget Me-Shiseido daughter on an afternoon totally ruled by Daniel and his former deputy, Errol Bhungard. If Daniel picked up two winners on the day, Errol led in four, thanks to some forceful riding of Gajender and N. Akhtar.

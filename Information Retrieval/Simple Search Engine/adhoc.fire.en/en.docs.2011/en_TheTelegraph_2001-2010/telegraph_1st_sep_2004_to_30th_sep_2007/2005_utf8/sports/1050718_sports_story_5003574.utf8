The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Armstrong is showbiz with sweat and risks 

BROUGH SCOTT

 On the bike and often off the bike, Armstrong is a competitive beast 

Last Tuesday Lance Armstrong was much more than sport. Thats both the fascination and the trouble about him. The 10th stage of this, his last Tour de France, ran from the scorching streets of Grenoble to the cool mountain heights of Courcheval. 

In each of his six previous Tour victories, the 33-year-old has crushed his rivals on the opening mountain stage. It happened again this time. It was almost too good to be true. 

As a watcher, the first thought was merely to be thankful. Win or lose, next Sunday on the Champs Elysees will be the last time we see Lance Armstrong on a Tour bike. 

Eight days ago he had talked of crisis when he and his Discovery Channel Team looked vulnerable in the Vosges. On Monday, Alexandre Vinokorouv ? arch rival Jan Ullrichs Kazakhstan teammate ? had openly talked of testing the master. 

The next days hundred miles and almost five hours up the valley to Albertville and then east into the high Alpine peaks of the Savoy had to be definitive. 

Whats more, Lance Armstrong is showbiz with sweat and risks for real. For better, and, in some unhappy senses still, for worse, everyone knows the Lance Armstrong story. 

The anger-fuelled kid from Texas whose promising early career was cut short by cancer from which he recovered, and then not only attained cycling greatness but also set up a charity foundation that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars. 

The extraordinary force that likes to dominate his team, his rivals, the whole environment of Le Tour and, most of all, those unspeakable trolls (journalists) who give any credence to the long-standing doping stories that still swirl around him despite all his denials and unblemished drug record. 

It was hot in Grenoble. The sun scorched down on the Avenue Clemenceau. The Discovery Channels black-windowed bus was parked behind the start with Armstrongs rock star girlfriend Sheryl Crow adding her own touch of Hollywood in front of it. Shes small, blonde and looks like an athletic version of Hilary Clinton. 

On cue, Armstrong gives something of a presidential wave when he finally clumps down the steps in his cycle shoes. He has a smile as lean, honed and hard as the rest of his 5ft 11in, 166lb body. 

As he chats briefly to the television, a man stands next to him holding his bike. A whistle blows, Lance and the other blue-vested Discovery riders gather up. A hundred yards across the park, a larger man with a shaven head holds another bike. 

It is Ullrichs brother Stefan. The pink vests of the T-Mobile team are already going towards the start. More whistles and suddenly Ullrich is among us. German TV mikes jostle forward but tall Jan is miles away behind his stubble and dark glasses. He had a heavy collision with a van the week before and took another double somersault last Sunday. 

The Tour de France may be a circus, but its also the Grand National meets marathon running 21 days on the trot. 

Thats when your heart goes out to the riders as they chew and josh in the saddle while the announcer hypes away and the police bikes rev. 

Ahead of some of them will be glory; ahead for all of them is pain. Its a feeling that stays in the comfort of the hire car with the Ici Le Tour radio telling you of early sprints and rising temperatures. 

The whole finish carnival is set up by the Altiport. It is at 7,000 feet, clouded and cool. The journey has taken two hours, somewhere down on the plain Armstrong and the other 172 starters are not half way through. If he had weakened, it would have been here. But he didnt. 

Without so much as touching any of his rivals, he set about a destruction of them as complete and savage as if he had set a pack of wolves on them. 

Which in a way he had. His team is his savagers. All along the flat stretches they protected him in arrowhead formation, and by the time the peloton reached Moutiers there were still five of them to help him push upwards, a blue and grey spearhead into the pain. 

The tempo these Discovery riders set was amazing to behold. By turns Savoldelli, Rubiera, Azevedo, Hinchcapie and finally Popovych drove forward before dropping away. 

Close up you reel at the control of the man. While Ullrich and the others struggle in exhausted, Armstrong is already conducting a string of interviews as composed and personable as if he were a politician running for office. You get a sense of awe but not of affection. 

Lance is animalistic, says his best friend John Korioth, the ultimate alpha-wolf. 

On the bike and often off the bike, hes a competitive beast. Its what makes him a fearsome competitor ? it also makes him a complicated human being to deal with. 

Back home he may be something of a secular saint and a shoo-in for Governor of Texas; for the next week this is still cycling and the spectre of drugs still hangs like the clouds above the Courcheval peaks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 North Zone need 144 for victory

 - DULEEP TROPHY 

- Harbhajan scalps four; Bangla effort not enough 

Indore: Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra claimed four wickets each as North Zone put themselves on the brink of victory on the third day of their Duleep Trophy match at Usharaje Stadium here Thursday. 

North, who scored 500 runs in their first essay, need 144 for an outright win on the final day. 

The star-studded North team bowled out South for 305 in the second innings with spinners Harbhajan and Mishra claiming four wickets each. 

South, which scored 338 runs in their first innings, had a bad start in their second as they lost their opener Robin Uthappa who was trapped leg before by mediumpacer Ashish Nehra for zero in the first over itself. 

However, the 150-run partnership for the second wicket between Swapnil Asnodkar (74, 4x11) and S Sriram (80, 4x15) provided some stability before Sriram was caught by M Bisla off Amit Bhandari. 

Later, skipper V. V. S. Laxman (59, 4x6, 6x1) combined well with Asnodkar to take the team to a respectable score but after that Harbhajan and Mishra captured wickets at regular intervals and the South late-order collapsed for 305. 

Earlier, resuming at their overnight score of 497 for nine, North Zone added just three runs to be all out for 500 in 87.2 overs. 

Chasing 144 to win, North Zone was four for no loss with Gautam Gambhir (4) and Virender Sehwag (0) at the crease when stumps were drawn. 

Brief scores 

South Zone 338 amp; 305 (Swapnil Asnodkar 74, S Sriram 80, VVS Laxman 59; Harbhajan Singh 4/84, Amit Mishra 4/46). North Zone 500 amp; 4/0.

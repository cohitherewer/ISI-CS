 Rhodes raps SA selection policy

 Lance Klusener should be in the team, feels Rhodes 

Mumbai: South Africa need to change their transformation-based selection policy if they were to excel and regain their place among the elite in world cricket, according to Jonty Rhodes. 

?The development of South African cricket is a concern. Unlike in Australia where the focus is on excellence, our stress is still on transformation. You cannot become world?s best if your focus is still on transformation,? the former South African batsman said. 

?Our selection policy too has to change a lot if our team wants to be the best in the world. Chopping and changing the players very frequently have not helped the cause. Players like Lance Klusener and Kevin Pietersen, who has migrated to England now, have always had love-hate relationship with the selectors despite performing very well,? said the player whose athleticism in the field won him many fans worldwide. 

Rhodes said former Australian captain Steve Waugh, West Indies skipper Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar were among the hardest hitters of the ball he had faced. 

?I know for sure that Waugh and Lara could hit the ball really hard as I have broken my hand twice while trying to stop their shots,? Rhodes, here to promote tourism, said. ?(Sachin) Tendulkar, who uses heavy bats, is another batsman who hits the ball very hard as his timing is always immaculate.? 

Rhodes said he felt sad for Klusener who could not find a place in the team despite being fit and a proven performer. 

?Klusener is not a conventional guy on and off the field but Klusener is a proven performer who has won many matches for us and I think he should be in the team,? he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My goal is always to hold the trophy

Paris: She is flying the family flag alone at Roland Garros, but if Venus Williams is missing the company of injured sister Serena she is not letting it show. The American, runner-up to Serena in the final here three years ago, is in Paris and is all smiles after winning her first tournament in 12 months last week. 

That Istanbul triumph has restored her confidence and whatever the draw says ? she is seeded just 11th at Roland Garros ? the former world No. 1 fancies her chances here. 

I try not to listen to the talk... everyone can talk, but there are very few who can walk, she smiled when asked if it bothered her she was not seen as a main contender this year. 

It is almost four years since she last won a Grand Slam title, her fourth was the 2001 US Open, but Venus still sees herself as a major power. 

I dont think theres like a ton of people lining up to play me, she said. My goal is always, of course, to be in the final and hold the trophy.. 

Her campaign got off to a smooth start on Monday when she breezed past Spains Marta Marrero 6-3, 6-2. 

The 24-year-old was pleased with her performance. I think I just got better as the match went on, she said. Im actually quite good as the points go longer, which is great for me because sometimes I get a little wild. 

The elder of the Williams sisters blazed on to the tennis scene in the late 1990s, dominating the sport in 2000 and 2001 with two Wimbledon and US Open titles plus two Olympic gold medals. The following year she reached four successive Grand Slam finals from Roland Garros 2002 to Australian Open 2003 but on each occasion was bested by younger sister Serena. 

The balance of power in the Williams family has shifted. Serena overtook Venus surpassing her four Grand Slams with seven. The protective older sister could handle that, the professional tennis player found it hard. 

With Serena at home in Florida nursing a sore ankle, Venus has just one goal in sight this fortnight. I was always raised to go for the gold, she said. The skys the limit. I dont put any limits on myself. I would only live with regrets if I had that, she said.

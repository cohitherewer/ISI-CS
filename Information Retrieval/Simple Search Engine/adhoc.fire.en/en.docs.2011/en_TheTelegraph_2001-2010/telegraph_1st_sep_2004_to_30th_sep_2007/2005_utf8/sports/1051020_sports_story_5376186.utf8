The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Production house put on stand-by 

 - TV RIGHTS ISSUE 

 - BCCI select group tele-conference doesnt feature Bindra 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Inderjit Singh Bindra, who is a member of the select group set up by the marketing committee for awarding the TV rights for the next four years, didnt participate in a tele-conference late on Tuesday. 

The tele-conference was to consider the opinion of Soli Sorabjee on the eligibility of the four bidders ? Doordarshan, ESPN, Sony and Zee Telefilms. The tele-conference went through with the other two members: BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra and predecessor Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Moreover, Bindra wants the entire marketing committees 10.30 am meeting here on Thursday postponed till the Delhi High Court order on a case filed by Zee. As already reported in these columns, Doordarshan and ESPN seem to have met all the technical requirements of the tender. 

Sorabjees opinion, though, isnt known. 

The Delhi High Court was expected to give an order on Wednesday afternoon, but Justice Markandeya Katju (incidentally, the Chief Justice) declined to hear the case and transferred it to the bench of Justice M. K. Sharma. 

Justice Katju, who has just been transferred from the Madras High Court, had dealt with a Zee case last year. Apparently, he shifted the latest one following an observation by the petitioners counsel. 

I see no point in coming to Calcutta till an order comes from the Delhi High Court... In any case, Ive only now finished meetings in connection with the October 28 ODI in Mohali and dont intend driving through the night to Delhi for a morning connection from there, Bindra told The Telegraph. 

Speaking late on Wednesday, from Chandigarh, Bindra added: As for last nights tele-conference, I didnt figure in it because Sorabjees opinion wasnt conveyed to me before it was to begin... The BCCI counsel, Usha Nath Banerjee, informed that the opinion ? which was oral ? would be intimated during the tele-conference. 

But, clearly, Im not instant coffee and needed time to react... I asked for an hour or so to digest whatever the opinion, but nobody got back to me... Its incorrect if anybody suggests that I stayed away from the tele-conference. 

Bindra, one of the key strategists of the opposition group within the BCCI, said he would circulate his views in writing if the marketing committee meeting wasnt postponed. Well, its going to be held as scheduled. 

Meanwhile, the BCCI is understood to have approached a production house to be on stand-by for the seven-ODI series against Sri Lanka which begins in Nagpur on October 25. Yet another ad-hoc arrangement may become necessary. 

Litigation or not, the clock doesnt stop.

Mohali: The star-studded India Senior finally got going, handing India B a crushing seven-wicket defeat in the second match of the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy at the PCA stadium on Tuesday. 

The Seniors handsome win was founded on an unbroken double century partnership between Yuvraj Singh and Y Venugopala Rao who helped the team recover from a shaky start and overhaul the target of 241 with 25 balls to spare. 

Rao, who fell short of a hundred by two runs yesterday, made amends with an unbeaten 101 but his winning shot, an inside edge to third man boundary, meant that his partner from Punjab was stranded on 99 not out. 

The 209-run stand between the two from 229 balls surpassed the previous best for the fourth wicket in the challenger series, a 170-run association between Dinesh Mongia and Amay Khurasia at Chennai in 2001. 

Yuvrajs 99 came from 105 balls with 13 fours while Raos knock was filled with 15 boundaries from 125 balls. 

The Yuvraj-Rao combination saw the Senior overcome early trouble when they were reduced to 33 for three in the eighth over. 

Kerala seamer Sreesanth produced a fiery new ball spell to remove Sachin Tendulkar (4) and Md Kaif (0) in successive overs but the Senior weathered the damage with ease. 

However, Sreesanth failed to make an impact in his second spell and conceded 33 runs from four overs. 

Earlier, Parthiv Patels rearguard 53 off 44 balls helped India B recover from a dicey 130 for four after being put into bat on a good batting strip. 

Parthiv shared a vital fifth-wicket stand with Yusuf Pathan (31), adding 58 runs off as many balls and also nursed the lower order with admirable confidence. Sridharan Sriram was the other notable contributor with 44 off 51 balls that formed the base of the early part of the B innings. 

Sriram also featured in a 72-run association with skipper Dinesh Mongia (34) for the third wicket from 88 balls. 

The stand was broken when the Mongia (34) committed hara-kiri with a wild heave off Irfan and holed out to JP Yadav at long on. 

Sriram looked confident during his 51-ball knock of 44 before a Irfan bouncer cramped him for a hook shot that found Satyajit Parab at backward squareleg. 

But any hopes the seniors might have had after claiming two wickets in the space of seven balls, of ploughing through the middle order was dented by Parthiv and Yusuf. 

The breakthrough finally came when Yuvraj managed to hold on. The senior Pathan by that time had made 31 and added 58 for the fifth wicket.

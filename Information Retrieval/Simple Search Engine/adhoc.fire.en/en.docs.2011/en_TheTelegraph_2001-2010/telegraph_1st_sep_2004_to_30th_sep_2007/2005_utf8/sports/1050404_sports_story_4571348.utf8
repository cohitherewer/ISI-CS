Georgetown: South Africa were forced to follow on after being dismissed for 188 on the fourth day of the first Test against West Indies on Sunday. 

Trailing the hosts by 355 runs after the first innings, the South Africans reached lunch on four without loss. 

AB de Villiers was unbeaten on three, while Graeme Smith was batting on one. 

Resuming at 130 for six, South Africa added 58 runs before West Indian pace trio of Pedro Collins, Daren Powell and Reon King mopped up the tail to finish with three wickets apiece. 

South Africa slipped to 158 for seven when Nicky Boje was bowled off his pads by a straightening delivery from King. Boje batted solidly for his 34 and his dismissal ended a 63-run stand with Mark Boucher. 

Makhaya Ntini hit lofted fours through mid-wicket and mid-off before being trapped in front for eight by an inswinger from Powell. 

South Africa?s last genuine hope of reaching the follow on target disappeared when Boucher?s attempt at driving a wide delivery from Collins was caught at first slip by Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Boucher scored a defiant 41 off 158 balls with five fours. 

The innings ended when Charl Langeveldt drove a full toss from off-spinner Narsingh Deonarine only to be caught by Ryan Hinds at short extra cover for 10.

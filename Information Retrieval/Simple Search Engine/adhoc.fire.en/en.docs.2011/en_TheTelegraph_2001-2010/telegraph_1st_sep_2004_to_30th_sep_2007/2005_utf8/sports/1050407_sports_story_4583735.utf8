The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB, Dempo suffer huge defeats

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta:It was a sad day 

 for Indian soccer as both East Bengal and Dempo SC were 

 handed out massive defeats by Jordanian clubs in their AFC 

 Cup encounters on Wednesday. While East Bengal went down 

 to Al Faisaly 0-5 in Amman, 10-man Dempo lost 0-3 at home 

 to Al Hussein. 

According to information received here, Mohayyed Salim was the chief destroyer as he scored a hattrick to dash red-golds hope at Amman?s National Stadium. Salim struck in the 12th, 42nd and 69th, while Sama?n Halaseh (54) and Mohammed Mahadeen (66) added to the tally. At the breather the Jordan team was leading 2-0. 

East Bengal?s chance to qualify for the second round received a jolt with this defeat. They now have only one point (from their drawn encounter against Bangladesh?s Muktijoddha Sansad) from three outings. 

Meanwhile, Al Hussein proved too strong for Dempo as they scored an easy 3-0 win, adds PTI from Margao. 

Al Hussein scored through Al-Zboun (33rd), Hatamleh (75th) and substitute Edmoud (injury time). 

Dempo were pegged into their own half and had one chance in each half but the well-marked Ranty Martins failed to find the target on both the occasions. 

Al Hussein, who won both of their matches, lead the table with six points followed by Al Ahed who have three points with a win against Dempo. 

Federation Cup winners, Dempo, are yet to open their account as they have lost both their matches. 

 Al Hussein, who were much superior in terms of skill, 

 had the Dempo citadel under constant pressure in the first 

 half but were unable to take an early lead due to a stubborn 

 resistance by Dempo?s ?keeper Satish Kumar, who put up an 

 excellent show under the bar denying Bani-Hani, Al Sheyab 

 and Alriahna from scoring.

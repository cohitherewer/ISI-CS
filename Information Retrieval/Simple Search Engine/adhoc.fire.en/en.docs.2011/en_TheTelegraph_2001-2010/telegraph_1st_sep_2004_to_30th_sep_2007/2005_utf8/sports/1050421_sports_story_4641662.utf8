Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, beaten 0-1, well and true by Al Faisaly of Jordan (a total of 6-0, home and away included), tried to defend his team?s actions on-field during Wednesday?s AFC Cup match at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Deficiencies physical and cerebral weren?t exactly the attributes, even in absentia, that came to be discussed at the post-match press conference. There was instead, a lot of chest-thumping and vocal bravado. 

Totally outplayed and brilliantly outmanoeuvred that they were by Al Faisaly ? the scoreline isn?t exactly a true picture of the domination ? Bhowmick decided to interpret it as his team having ?more openings? and even said that he was ?satisfied? with the performance. 

?We missed sitters, they didn?t miss a sitter, where were their openings?? What about the penalty? Out came the age old, tattered trump card. ?The refereeing (by Uzbekistan?s Irmatov Ravshan) was poor. That definitely wasn?t a penalty. Suresh hadn?t touched the player.? It resulted in a winner, though. 

And then, when asked what happened that he brought in Bhaichung Bhutia and Alvito D?Cunha in the second half, despite saying Tuesday that he would ?rest? them, the coach?s blunt denial was stunning. ?I never said that,? he replied. ?I said I would bring them on in the second half if necessary.? The brazen denial was too much for further questions to follow. 

Thankfully, there was this earlier meeting with Al Faisaly assistant coach Ziad Abu Sheman, a down to earth man with no airs about him. ?Yesterday we thought we could handle the heat, but today, on the ground, we just almost died of the heat and humidity,? he said. That explained the lethargy. 

 He said he was satisfied with his team?s performance, and said that in the matches that follow, the team would be stringer because those stars not in the team here would be back. With ten points, they now lead the group. East Bengal remain with a slim chance of passing through to the next stage. 

They agreed that with the introduction of Bhaichung and Alvito in the second half ?the East Bengal team started performing better.? With nine national team players, Al Faisaly have big injury problems. ?They go to the national team for two years, and then they come back very tired and injured.? The outcome was that the best team in Jordan finished second in the league. 

Top players of the club, established in 1932, though, get training from national coach Mahmoud Al Johari, of Egypt. 

 For the record, Johari gets a monthly salary of $ 

 20,000. Board and lodging, plus a car, are extra.

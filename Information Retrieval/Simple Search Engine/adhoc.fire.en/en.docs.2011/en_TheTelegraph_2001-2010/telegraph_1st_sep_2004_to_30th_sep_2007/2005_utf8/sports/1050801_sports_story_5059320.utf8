 Seasons 4th triumph for Raikkonen 

 - HUNGARIAN GP - Schumacher brothers share podium; Narain finishes a creditable 

 12th

Budapest: Narain Karthikeyans prediction of the tough and slow Hungaroring circuit actually helping him came true as he finished a creditable 12th in the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday. 

Narains better placing could look exaggerated with six cars failing to finish but that in itself showed the hard work put in by the Jordan team on a punishing circuit. 

Teammate Tiago Monteiro overcame a slow start to finish 13th. 

McLarens Kimi Raikkonen came out on top for a fourth win of the season, while Renaults championship leader Fernando Alonso failed to score. 

Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher finished 35.5 seconds behind after starting on pole position. 

Alonso was 11th, his worst finish of the year so far, after an afternoon of hard labour prompted by a brush on the first corner of the race with Ralf Schumacher, who finished third. 

It looks better now than after the last race but its just unlucky that we always seem to throw away 10 points and then he (Alonso) gets it and the next race we get it back, said Raikkonen. 

We are just going backwards and forwards the whole time. But there are still six races to go and if we can do this kind of result and maybe something happens to him we can still fight for the championship. Thats what were going to do. 

While Schumacher failed to hold off Raikkonens challenge, losing out in the pitstops, he could take heart from an encouragingly competitive day for the champions. 

I was pretty happy with the pace we were able to run, said Schumacher. If we could have stayed in front after the pitstops we might have had a chance because it is so difficult to overtake. 

Ralfs Toyota teammate Jarno Trulli was fourth, while Briton Jenson Button, his BAR stripped of tobacco advertising before European legislation comes into force on Monday, was fifth. Germanys Nick Heidfeld sixth for Williams. 

Neither of the Red Bull drivers lasted a lap. Christian Klien barrel-rolled spectacularly at the first corner and David Coulthard crashed out after Alonsos Renault shed its front wing in his path. 

Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, in the second Ferrari, also had a tough race after running into the back of Trullis Toyota at the start and having to make an unscheduled pitstop for a replacement wing. He finished 10th. 

Karthikeyan said he took advantage of the situation at the beginning to gain a few positions and then settled into a consistent rhythm setting consistent lap times. 

I had a decent start I think, avoided the mayhem at the first corner and gained a few positions. 

 Then I kept on pushing throughout 

 the race. It was physically the toughest race of my life 

 but I also drove the most consistent race of my F1 career. 

 My lap times were always steady, quot; Karthikeyan said.

Madrid: Two goals from Cameroon striker Samuel Eto helped champions Barcelona to a 3-0 home win over high-flying Osasuna in the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

Eto scored twice in seven minutes at the start of the second half to take his tally for the season to nine. 

France winger Ludovic Giuly also poached a third goal near the end but it was Argentine youngster Lionel Messi and Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho who stole the show. 

Messis pace tormented Osasunas defenders all night while Ronaldinho had a hand in all three goals. 

Barcelona moved up to fourth in the table with 13 points, two behind leaders Real Madrid and second-placed Osasuna who are level on 15. 

Earlier on Saturday, goals from Adriano and Enzo Maresca steered Sevilla to a 2-0 home win over struggling Alaves. The victory moved Sevilla up to seventh with 12 points while Alaves remained 18th on six points. 

Osasuna, who had not conceded a goal in three outings, made life hard for Barcelona early on. 

Messi headed the home sides best first-half chance against the bar after 26 minutes but Barcelona found another gear at the start of the second. 

Straight from the restart, Messi set off on a blistering run at the heart of Osasunas defence and rounded the keeper, only to see his shot turned wide for a corner. Ronaldinho then set up the opener for Eto, who was left completely unmarked to head the ball in. 

The Brazilian also played a part in the second goal, his backheel releasing fellow countryman Silvinho for a run to the byline. 

Ricardo could only push out Silvinhos cross and Eto stabbed home the loose ball. The third came from a fortuitous deflection as a harmless centre rebounded off Ronaldinhos back, allowing Giuly to nip in and poke the ball into the net. 

But the victory came at a cost for coach Frank Rijkaard as Brazilian defender Juliano Belletti and Portugal midfielder Deco were injured. 

Belletti left the field with his knee bandaged after 19 minutes while Deco limped off in the 37th. 

In Serie A action, a hattrick by Italy international Luca Toni inspired a 4-1 victory over Parma on Saturday which moved Fiorentina level on points with second-placed AC Milan in Serie A, add reports from Milan. 

Parma were badly weakened by injury and were swept aside by hosts Fiorentina, who led 3-0 by halftime after two goals from Toni and a spectacular strike by Stefano Fiore. Toni opened the scoring in the second minute with a header from a Martin Jorgensen cross before doubling the lead after a dreadful error by Portuguese defender Fernando Couto. 

Coutos weak back-pass was intercepted by Toni, who rounded Parma keeper Luca Bucci to slot the ball into an unguarded goal in the 24th minute. 

Nine minutes before the break Fiore effectively wrapped up victory with a brilliant individual goal, picking the ball up in midfield and heading goalwards before unleashing a 25-metre drive with his less-favoured left foot. 

Toni completed his hattrick on 59 minutes when he chested the ball down in the area and lobbed Bucci, who was slow to react. 

Australian Vincenzo Grella pulled a goal back for Parma with a low drive through a crowded area in the 66th minute. 

Gianluca Comotto headed an injury-time equaliser to earn Ascoli a 1-1 draw at Messina. Messina went ahead in the 28th minute with a Riccardo Zampagna penalty after Maurizio Domizzi was ruled to have brought down Serbian striker Ivica Iliev. 

Domizzi was sent off for a second bookable offence three minutes from the end but deep into injury time Comotto rose in the area to bullet home a header. 

Messina were left in the relegation zone with four points, all from draws, from eight games. Promoted Ascoli have 10 points.

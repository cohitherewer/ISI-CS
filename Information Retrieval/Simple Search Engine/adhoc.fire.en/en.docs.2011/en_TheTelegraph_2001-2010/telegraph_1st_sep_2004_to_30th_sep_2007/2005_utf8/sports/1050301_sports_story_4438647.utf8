The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak to seek Intikhab views

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer is on his second trip to India. He was first here in 1996, as coach of the South African side. 

?When I last came here with the South Africans, there were about four camera crews at our first press conference. Now I can count about 22 cameras and many more reporters,? Woolmer said, enjoying the hype and excitement that followed Pakistan?s arrival. 

He said that he had no past experience of the Mohali wicket, the venue of the first Test, but that some of his senior players had told him that it generally favoured pacers. Both Woolmer and Inzamam-ul Haq informed that they would talk to current Punjab and former Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam on the nature of the wicket.

 Pietersen has mettle for Ashes battle: Fletcher

Johannesburg: England coach Duncan Fletcher echoed captain Michael Vaughan on Monday, saying that Kevin Pietersen?s one-day showing in South Africa had put him into contention for a Test spot for this year?s Ashes. 

?He played some outstanding innings and took on the South African crowds and everyone else,? Fletcher told reporters in the team hotel in Johannesburg. 

?He seems to thrive on that and it?s a big plus that the boy likes a contest. The Australians are a tough side and we definitely need to give a lot of thought to bringing him into the equation for the Tests.? 

Pietersen, born and raised in South Africa but who switched his allegiance to England because he thought he would get more opportunities, scored three hundreds in the seven-match series and averaged 151.33. The next highest average was Michael Vaughan?s 39.75. 

He also scored his runs at more than a run a ball, despite being booed regularly by the South African crowds. England, however, still lost the series 1-4. 

South Africa won the last game by three wickets on Sunday despite a Pietersen innings of 116. Vaughan said after the match that there was no reason why Pietersen could not play in Tests. 

Pietersen was adjudged both man of the match and series for his scintillating show in the ODI series. 

Some commentators have suggested his technique might be too loose to succeed but Fletcher praised his attitude. 

?The key thing about Pietersen is that he?s a classic example of thinking on your feet. When he?s at the crease, you can see he?s working things out for himself. It?s one thing to know where to hit the ball, but he?s also working out how to hit it there.?

 Digvijay, Shiv in contention

Beijing: Digvijay Singh and Shiv Kapur, separated by just one shot, were both in contention for their maiden Asian Tour victory as they occupied first and third places, respectively, at the end of the third round of the $200,000 Crowne Plaza Open here on Saturday. 

The 33-year-old Digvijay dropped a bogey at the last hole to fall into a tie with Chinese Taipeis Lu Wen Teh after returning a 71 at the Grand Epoch City Golf Club. 

The Indian lamented a cold putter as two of his three bogeys were results of three putts while he missed other birdie chances. He carded a fighting 71 to total five-under 211 and shared the lead. 

Veteran Lu produced a magnificent ball-striking display which yielded six birdies against no bogeys. Lu his aiming to snap a seven-year winless run against a co-leader who is searching for his career breakthrough. 

Kapur shot a four-under 68 to rise from tied 10th after two rounds to be shared third. Kapur had six birdies and two bogeys. 

Amongst other Indians Rahil Gangjee (73) was tied 21st, Vivek Bhandari (73) was tied 46th and Uttam Singh Mundy (72) tied 53rd. With the course still playing tough, just 13 players were under par for three days. 

Digvijay opened with a bogey on first, but quickly recovered with birdies on the third and sixth. (PTI)

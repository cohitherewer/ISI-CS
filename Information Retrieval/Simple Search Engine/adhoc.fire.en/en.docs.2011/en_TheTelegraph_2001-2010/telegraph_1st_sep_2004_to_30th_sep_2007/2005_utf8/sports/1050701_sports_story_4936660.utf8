 Narain happy to be back at Magny-Cours

 - FRENCH GRAND PRIX 

 Narain Karthikeyan feels the new car, the EJ15B, will be good 

Magny-Cours: After collecting his first points from a highly controversial US Grand Prix, Indias Formula One debutant Narain Karthikeyan is glad to return to familiar tracks as he prepares for the French Grand Prix here Sunday. 

Actually, I have plenty of reasons to be happy here in Magny-Cours. After going to a number of circuits that I didnt know, I am actually familiar with Magny-Cours and have some good memories of finishing on the podium in last years Nissan World Series with Kovalainen and Monteiro on the other steps of the podium, Narain said. 

Magny-Cours is a fast and smooth circuit that places an emphasis upon a cars aerodynamics. The circuit suits my driving style. I always find a good balance and rhythm and enjoy driving here, he said. 

Karthikeyan made history at the US Grand Prix finishing the 73-lap race in fourth place, the best ever classification for the Jordan Grand Prix driver in Formula One. However, his teammate Tiago Monteiro, finished on the podium and more importantly, the race was plagued with a massive boycott. 

The team has brought back some important points from the North American trip. The last time Jordan scored a similar number of points was with Giancarlo Fisichellas win in Brazil in 2003, Karthikeyan said. 

He was also happy with the performance of his new car ? the EJ15B ? but said the team will first use it probably at the German GP on July 24. 

It looks really nice and is very fast too. You can see the potential and we will use it most probably in Hockenheim.

New Delhi: Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant set himself on course for the third title of the season after opening up a three-stroke lead in the penultimate round of the $300,000 Hero Honda Indian Open Golf Championship here on Saturday. 

The Asian Tour money leader consolidated his overnight lead, proving his putting class again as he did on the final 18th which he holed from 20 feet to return a card of 68 on Round III at the Delhi Golf Club. 

While Thaworn held his nerve on a slightly windy day, Harmeet Kahlon saw a bad back nine result in a one-over 73 and slip to overall eighth, a sobering performance after a brilliant 64 on the second day. 

Not far behind Thaworn was his compatriot, 21-year old talented Prom Meesawat, who shot a three-under 68 for a tied second place with South African veteran Hendrick Buhrmann. 

The Indian challenge to the title into the final day would then rest with Jyoti Randhawa who returned a card of 67, the days best for the whole field. 

But local favourite Arjun Atwal finally saw the rustiness of a months break catch up with him as he returned a one-over 73, which left him nine strokes behind the leader. 

It was a rare occasion when Atwal was placed outside the top-five going into the final round at the Indian Open. 

Thaworn putted almost from anywhere. His first birdie came on the fifth hole, where he holed it from eight feet. 

The ninth was even better, the 39-year old Thai finding the pin from 11 feet. 

After two more birdies on the 11th and 12th, Wiratchant went into the jungle with a three iron on the 13th tee. He chipped out and two putted for a bogey. 

There was another bogey on the 15th where he missed the pin from one feet. 

But he made up for the twin setback with a birdie on the 545-yard 18th where he recovered after shooting into the right bush. 

He found the green with a brilliant sandwedge before putting from 20 feet. 

I tried to keep it in the fairways, it was a bit windy, said Thaworn who had won two national titles already this year, the Indonesian Open and the Taiwan Open. 

The difference between Indonesian Open and here is the course. You have to be very straight here, he added. 

Kahlon began with a birdie and had two more on the third and the seventh before topping it with an eagle on the eighth. 

But then there was an inexplicable sudden change in his form that saw four bogeys on the 9th, 12th, 14th and 15th. 

He recovered slightly with a birdie on the 16th but then fell further with a bogey and a double bogey on the last two holes. 

I dont know, said the Chandigarh pro, who has been consulting Jonathan Yarwood, coach of US Open champion Michael Campbell. 

Couple of bad shots on the back nine let me down. But then its golf. I had an eagle on the same 18th Friday, today I had a double bogey, said the 35-year old Kahlon. 

Randhawa, on the other hand, was happily ruing the missed chances for two more birdies. 

It feels good to have the best card of the day. Five birdies and no bogeys, anybody would be happy with that, the 32-year old said. 

I missed two more birdies. It could have been much closer to the leader and put that much pressure on him. 

Those misses came on the last two holes, the 17th as close as three feet. 

I also slipped out three times, Randhawa added. 

The most agonising of them must have been the eighth hole when he had a chance for an eagle but went on the aggressive and ended up three putting from 20 feet. 

Randhawa, who changed his swing recently, said he was feeling increasingly comfortable with his game as the event has progressed. 

On the first two days I think I lost my rhythm and was tentative. Having changed the swing, I needed to get that confidence. 

But Randhawa, having won the Indian Open in 2000 and the Hero Honda Masters in 1998 and 99 at the Delhi Golf Club, knows what it takes to conquer the narrow course here. 

You have to be conservative on the swing, not to be aggressive on the tee. Get on to the fairway, and then attack the pin with some strong putting, he said. 

The highest-ranked Indian in the world assured that he would do to his best on Sunday. 

I am sure Thaworn is not going let it slip. Somebody has to make the charge. 

Bet on Randhawa to do that on Sunday.

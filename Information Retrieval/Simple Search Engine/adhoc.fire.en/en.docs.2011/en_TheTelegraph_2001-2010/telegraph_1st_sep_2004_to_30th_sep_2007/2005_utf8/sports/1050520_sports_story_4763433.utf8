 Kramnik gives Anand first win of meet

 - SOFIA MASTERS

 Indian GM overcomes shocking defeat to Topalov 

 Viswanathan Anand mulls a move against Veselin Topalov during the MTel Masters in Sofia on Wednesday 

Sofia: A day after a big setback when he was shocked by local star Veselin Topalov in the sixth round of the MTel Masters, Indian Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand finally got on the winners list, beating Vladimir Kramnik here Thursday. 

Kramnik committed an uncharacteristic blunder that led to a comfortable win in just 20 moves for Anand. The Indian moved out of the last position which now has Kramnik. 

Anand has 3.5 points from seven games and is tied second with Judit Polgar who drew her seventh round with Ruslan Ponomariov, who is the leader with four points. 

Anands loss to Topalov had sent shock waves and seen Anand in the unfamiliar last position. 

These things can change quickly, Anand had said a day earlier, and indeed they have. 

That win was a huge relief, especially after yesterday (against Topalov), said Anand. You can imagine my mood yesterday. Well I will take it. A win is good to have. That win was welcome, more so after the game against Topo (Topalov). 

The Anand-Kramnik game, which lasted just 20 moves, was the shortest of the tournament and certainly the shortest result-producing clash between the two giants of modern chess era. 

Anand recalled a similar game with Kramnik six years ago in another Petroff. 

It was the tournament in Frankfurt in 1999 and I had played a game with Karpov the day before. When I went back and checked on the computer I saw it was a forced win, very easy. The next day to my surprise, Vlady (Kramnik) played the same game and it gave me a forced win, recalled Anand. 

Sometimes you are tired and dont check on the computer when you get back to the room. I had, and Vlady repeated it. 

Kramnik, when asked if tiredness was the reason for the blunder, gave no excuses and said: If I am tired and I blunder then it is my problem. It will be nice to have another rest day, and I said that earlier, too. 

Polgar and Ponomariov drew in 27 moves from a Ruy Lopez opening, which had the Berlin defence. It was a clear draw and the arbiters agreed, and some farcical moves were avoided. 

In the last round Anands loss to Topalov was coupled with Ponomariovs victory over Kramnik and Judit Polgars win over Michael Adams. 

That was when Ponomariov became the new leader with 3.5 points. 

If Topalov handled the middle game like a great tactician, his technique in the final stages left little to chance and Anand, despite putting up a brave front, had to surrender on the 52nd move. 

Soon after Anands defeat, it was the turn of Kramnik to sign resignation against Ponomariov who looks a completely transformed player after the last two rounds that fetched him two victories on the trot. 

Polgar had gained at the expense of Adams rather lacklustre play in the middle game arising out a Petroff Defence. 

The Englishman lost a pawn on the 33rd move and Polgar gave a superlative display of endgame expertise thereafter to romp home in 52 moves.

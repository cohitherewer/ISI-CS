The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Almeida wins it for Mahindra

Mumbai: Mahindra United?s Brazilian recruit Rodrigo de Almeida scored a brace to help his team beat State Bank of Travancore (SBT) 3-1 in the National Football League match at the Cooperage here on Thursday. 

Midfielder A.B. Kabeer put the visitors ahead off a Asif Saheer pass in the 10th minute. However, Mahindra equalised when their Brazilian striker Flavio Rodrigues found the net in the 36th minute. 

At half time the teams were level 1-1. 

Though the bankmen made most of the attacks in the first half, it was the hosts who dominated proceedings in the second session. However, they had to wait till the dying moments to find the winning goals. 

First Brazilian Almeida scored off a flag kick taken by medio Jatin Bisht which came off substitute Abhishek Yadav?s head with just a minute to go for the final hooter. Then in injury time Almeida?s pile-driver was bang on target as the jeepmen took their tally to 16 points from nine matches. SBT had to be content with nine points from ten matches. (PTI)

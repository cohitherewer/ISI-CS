 We still have to get better: Paes

Jaipur: India won both reverse singles against Uzbekistan to complete a 5-0 scoreline in the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group I second-round tie at the Jai Club on Sunday. 

Prakash Amritraj overcame early resistance from Farrukh Dustov and the energy-sapping heat to win the first dead rubber 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-2. Then Harsh Mankad, replacing captain Leander Paes, saw off Murad Inoyatov 7-5, 6-1. 

India will next meet a stronger team in the World Group play-off round, the draw for which will take place in London on Tuesday. 

Mankad did well to give his 100 per cent in a dead fifth rubber, and that too, after being on the chair for the first two days. Inoyatov opened strongly with two aces but then a double-fault and a stunning service return from Mankad gave the Indian a service-break. Inoyatov capitalised on a pair of double-faults to get even in game 10. But Mankad wrested the advantage in the very next game to take the close first set. Thereafter, it was one-way traffic. 

Paes said India had the nucleus that could take it to the World Group. 

?The way I look at it, we have three solid singles players. But we still have to get better in singles play,? the captain said. ?Whenever a boy comes into a Davis Cup tie, he leaves a better player. That is how I got better, and definitely these two (Amritraj and Mankad) will also get better.? 

On the issue of his playing singles, Paes said: ?Two days ago, everyone was asking if I should play singles at all, last evening they were telling me I better play the singles. Quite a turnaround.? 

The India captain, on the threshold of some Davis Cup milestones, said there were two ways to look at records. ?One is to be selfish and go for the records... I have my homework done and know how many matches I have to play to get to the top five (in Cup wins). I am going to be here for another two-three years? as long as I am fit, I will play. 

 Pak make history 

In Lahore, Pakistan beat Chinese Taipei 4-1 to book their first-ever World Group play-off berth. Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi, the world No. 144, gave the home team an unassailable 3-1 lead beating Yen-Hsun Lu 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 before Aqeel Khan overcame Yeu-Tzuoo Wang 6-7, 6-4, 6-2 to complete a famous triumph. 

He had been instrumental in Pakistan shocking Thailand in the previous round at home.

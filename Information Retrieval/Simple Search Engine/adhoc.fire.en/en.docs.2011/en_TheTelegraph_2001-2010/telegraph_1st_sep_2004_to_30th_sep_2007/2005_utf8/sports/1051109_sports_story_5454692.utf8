 Bhutia uncertainty continues 

 - Mizorams speed a worry for Aloke today 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhutia 

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutias uncertainty to play for Bengal in the Santosh Trophy, doesnt seems to end. 

His much-awaited IRTC has been received by IFA on Tuesday, but it is appearing to be not enough to pave the way for him taking a quick flight to Kerala. 

According to the AIFF rules, a player has to be registered before the first match the team plays in the tournament. IFA however, has requested for a special permission from AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, allowing Bhaichung to wear Bengals jersey. 

I have requested the AIFF president to give us a special permission, allowing Bhaichung to play for Bengal. Alberto Colaco (federation secretary) has given me the assurance that a way would be sorted out, said IFA secretary Subrata Dutta. 

Firoze is likely to join the Bengal squad in Thiruvananthapuram, as a replacement for Bhaichung till the issue over the ace striker gets solved. 

Meanwhile, Bengal coach Aloke Mukherjee insisted that his team would look for a direct win against Mizoram in the final cluster match on Wednesday. 

Even if a draw will help us move into the quarter finals, well play for a win, Mukherjee said from Thiruvananthapuram. He, however, took a guard against the opponents speed. 

Mizo players are known for their speed. Well have to keep eyes on the likes of S. Malsawmtluanga and Jerry Zirsangha in the match, he added.

 CRICKET ONLINE - RAVI SHASTRI

 Dont reverse sweep unless you are experienced

 Hitting hard and clean is not all about strength but timing too

 I am a right-handed batsman. I am physically weak and have very slim arms. I cant hit big, powerful shots because of my physique. I do a lot of physical exercises including push-ups, but nothing has helped. Please suggest a way out.

 (Aamir Islam, 10, Calcutta-37)

 Work hard in the gym. Hitting hard and clean is not all about strength but timing as well.

 I am a medium-pacer. How does one bowl the reverse swing?

 (Debarshi Mukherjee Das, 13, Calcutta-64)

 You need to work on the ball. If you can swing a new ball, you should not have a problem with reverse.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I play forward to an off-spinner, I end up getting caught at forward short leg. Please help.

 (Ratan Pal, 19, Calcutta-29)

 Get close to the pitch of the ball so that you can smother the spin.

 I am a right-handed batsman. On a turning pitch, is it necessary to tackle a spinner by reaching to the pitch of every ball?

 (Shabbir Alam, 21, Rourkela)

 Yes, especially if you are driving off the front foot.

 I am a right-handed batsman. How does one play the googly and identify it when the ball comes out of the bowlers hand?

 (Rajib Basak, 16, Calcutta-14)

 Watch the hand closely, it will come out from the back of the hand. Treat it like an off-break. 

 I am a right-arm medium pacer. Where should a bouncer be pitched to make life difficult for batsmen?

 (Roktim Das, 18, Calcutta-14)

 It should pitch in an area from where the ball can reach the throat or chin of the batsman.

 I am a left-handed batsman. I often fall leg-before to inswinging deliveries. Why does this happen?

 (Sanjiv Prasad, 18, Calcutta-39)

 You are getting your front foot too far across or falling over towards the off side.

 What is the right way to play the cover drive? Where should the feet be positioned?

 (Ankit Sharma, 16, Kharagpur)

 Front toe pointing towards the cover area.

 I am a right-handed batsman and would like to know the right way to play the reverse sweep. Also please advise on the selection of ball for executing the stroke.

 (Sujoy Das, 17, Calcutta-89)

 Would not advise you to practise that shot unless you are experienced.

 I am a right-handed batsman and often get caught at fine-leg when attempting to hook shortpitched deliveries. Should I stop executing the shot?

 (Rajan Datta, 19, Calcutta-42).

 You are either getting too far across or not getting the room to free your arms.

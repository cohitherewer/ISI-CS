 SBT shock Salgaocar 

 - National League 

 Tolly will have to keep an eye on Omagbemi 

Margao: After three years in wilderness, State Bank of Travancore (SBT) celebrated their comeback in style as they exploited Salgaocar defence to score a thrilling 4-3 win in the ninth National Football League (NFL) match played at Nehru Stadium here on Friday. 

The fleet-footed SBT scored through man-of-the-match Mohammed Rafi M (5th, 50th), Ignatius Sylvester (64th) and substitute Mohammed Aslam. 

Salgaocar, who had more goal scoring chances, reduced the margin through Francis Andrade (39th), substitute Samson Singh (70th) and Felix Ibrebru (71st). 

In Mumbai, former Durand Cup winners Mahindra United held Churchill Brothers, Goa to a goalless draw in a dull and drab encounter at the Cooperage. 

In the opening match on Wednesday, champions East Bengal played goalless with Mohun Bagan. 

Tolly face Sporting 

In Margao, having had to hang in balance for quite some time before finally managing to stay in the elite league, Tollygunge Agragami don?t want to seem themselves in the same position again. 

As their campaign in the ninth NFL starts against Sporting Clube de Goa, at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday, coach Biswajit Das must be knowing the difficult terrain he is in. 

To start with an away match is always dangerous proposition, but Das is confident that his team will be equal to the task. 

A lot will definitely depend on how his foreign taskforce rises to the occasion. 

East Bengal-discard Suley Musah may have been a shadow of his past, but still is capable of generation fear in the opposition ranks. 

Interestingly, the match will also mark Das? debut in the NFL as a coach. 

Sporting, on the other hand, finished eighth in their maiden entry to the NFL last season. And with talented youngsters like Wilton Gomes, Philip Gomes, Joe Pereira, Vicent Pereira and Cedric Peixoto, they clearly start favourites at home. But their biggest asset is their strike-force where Dudu Omagbemi has been their main inspiration.

 A smart captain goes beyond whats discussed at team meetings: Bacher

 - If I had to bank on anybody saving my life, it would be Steve waugh 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Dr Ali Bacher, 63, has worn many hats. Now, of course, he is into consultancy (promoting Stellavista brought him to Calcutta after nine years) and something even more different cant be ruled out. Dr Bacher spoke to The Telegraph for around an hour over lunch on Friday. 

The following are excerpts 

Q The current generation knows you more as an outstanding administrator, yet youve also captained South Africa. What, in your view, makes a good captain? 

A The ability to inspire and motivate... A team could be losing on the fourth afternoon of a Test, but an inspirational captain may just turn things around... You cant make a great captain ? one is either born with qualities of greatness or one isnt. 

What was your style of captaincy? 

Fortunately, I had a terrific team... I knew eight-nine of my players would perform under any circumstances and, so, I subtly worked on the remaining two-three... They were the ones who needed to be motivated... (After a pause) Actually, the tactical side of captaincy continues to fascinate me. A smart captain goes beyond whats discussed at team meetings... Somebody who innovates. 

You dont seem to give much importance to coaches? 

They do have a role, but its limited. I mean, at the highest level, how much can a coach do? He cant play... He cant take the field and motivate... Its the captain who is the boss. (Laughs) Perhaps, Im from the old school. 

Did you have a role model captain? 

I looked up to Sir Don (Bradman) for everything... Somehow, captaincy came easy and I was captaining teams from school itself. 

You rate Graeme Smith highly, but who would you pick as the one stand-out captain of recent times? 

Steve Waugh... He out-thought batsmen, made changes which produced immediate results... Whatever the situation, he looked the boss ? quite like an Ian Chappell. Plus, he was a superb batsman. If I had to bank on anybody saving my life, it would be Steve... He will continue to be respected and respect isnt available off the shelf. 

What are your impressions of Sourav Ganguly? 

Positive... I saw much of the India versus Australia series in Australia (2003-04) and found the Indians mentally very tough... They fought on equal terms and, despite playing away, werent intimidated. I guess Souravs captaincy changed the body language. Having said that, Indias performance in the last series (against Pakistan) was rather disappointing. I dont know the reasons, but things fell apart. 

Given the support staff and more, has captaincy become easier? 

An environment to help raise the level of performance has definitely been created... Yet, at the end of the day, a captain still has to motivate and inspire. That wont change. 

What would you tell rookie captains? 

Simply that theyve got to inspire and motivate... Theyve got to love working out strategies... Come Monday and Im going to interact with club and school-level captains (and coaches) in Johannesburg... Ive begun to make notes... What I cant understand is why most captains have dispensed with the third-man... Nowadays, batsmen are under much less pressure: Instead of a single, they get four! Its beyond me. 

Hansie Cronje was a respected captain... 

Tactically, perhaps, Hansie wasnt always right there... His strength, really, was leadership... He raised the bar and the players didnt let him down... He was the boss and had everyones respect. 

Youve already observed that South Africa need time to rebuild... How do you view Team India? 

Rich in batsmen... World class... However, to succeed, you must have two genuine quicks. Thats lacking. 

Are you still a big fan of Sachin Tendulkar? 

Absolutely... I cant forget the way he treated Allan Donald in the 1996-97 Cape Town Test... The second new ball was fresh, but Sachin was unstoppable. Im convinced he will break every record. 

Any comment on Greg Chappells appointment as coach? 

All I know is he was a magnificent batsman and is a very fine person... I know nothing about his credentials as coach, so what do I say? 

Are you comfortable with the changes introduced by the ICC? 

Im an old supporter of using technology to help the umpires... If you recall, we took the lead during Indias maiden tour, in 1992-93... As for the experimental changes in ODIs, well, lets see how they work... While I wont commit myself on the substitution bit, the change in field restrictions is sensible. Incidentally, back in 1990-91, we had a one-off limited overs competition which allowed as many as three substitutions. It wasnt a success, though... Didnt generate the excitement we thought it would. 

But why should cricket go the soccer way? 

If the substitution gives a new dimension, why not? If the concept clicks, there wont be any harm in embracing it full-time... Lets wait and see, not rush either to praise or condemn. 

Five years on, whats your take on the match-fixing scandal? 

I was then the Board managing director... Those were the toughest days in my career as an administrator... Under oath, at the King Commission, I was obliged to reveal Id received information of a general nature (on match-fixing) before the whole thing exploded... I remember having raised the issue twice at the ICC ? in 1997 and 1999 ? but that wasnt put on the minutes. Why? I dont know... I didnt run a crusade (in the ICC), but I talked about the issue on two occasions. With the benefit of hindsight, each one of us ought to have reacted strongly (in 1997 and 1999)... I got censured for saying Hansie couldnt be the only one involved and the ICCs own investigations, by Lord Paul Condon, confirmed that. 

Even three years after his death, Hansies name keeps popping up... 

You know, back in South Africa, theres much sympathy for Hansie... People say if Nelson Mandela could forgive those who incarcerated him for almost three decades, why cant Hansie be forgiven? Even when he was alive, people did ask whether it was fair to ban him for life when Mark Waugh and Shane Warne got away with a rap on their wrists... Hansie, at least, came clean before the King Commission... 

Not everybody is convinced there was no sabotage in the plane crash which killed Hansie. Have you, too, had misgivings? 

No... The visibility, when the pilot attempted to land, was zero. 

The final question: Whats the earliest memory you have of Hansie? 

(After a pause) It was at an airport on our historic visit to India, in November 1991, that the baggage remained in a van for what appeared an eternity... The baggage-handlers and the rest just werent moving... Suddenly, Hansie (who came on the development programme ticket) jumped on to the van and started giving instructions... Despite the handicap of language, he got things sorted out. Leadership, after all.

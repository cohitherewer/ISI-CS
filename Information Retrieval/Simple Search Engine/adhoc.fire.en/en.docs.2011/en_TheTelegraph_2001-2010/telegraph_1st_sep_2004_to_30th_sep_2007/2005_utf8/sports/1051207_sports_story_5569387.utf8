 Gold for Rathore

Hyderabad: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore lived up to his reputation, winning gold in the double trap event but could not better his own best of 191.0 points at the 49th National Shooting Championship here on Tuesday. 

The 26-year-old army officer, who won silver at the Athens Olympics last year, aggregated 191.0 points which is not only an event record but also his best figure notched up since 2002. (PTI)

London: Wigan Athletics six-game winning streak in the Premier League came to an end on Saturday with a 3-2 defeat by Arsenal in a rip-roaring clash at the JJB Stadium. 

Leaders Chelsea got back to winning ways with a 3-0 defeat of Newcastle United while Manchester United began life without Roy Keane by beating Charlton Athletic 3-1 at the Valley. 

Wigans record home crowd were treated to a pulsating first half in which a classy Arsenal raced into a 2-0 lead after 21 minutes with goals from Robin Van Persie and Thierry Henry. 

Henri Camara gave second-placed Wigan a lifeline with a diving header after 28 minutes, only for Henry to restore Arsenals two-goal cushion with a delicious free kick past Wigan goalkeeper John Filan. 

Wigan, who have enjoyed a superb start to their first season in the top flight, hit back again on the stroke of halftime when Jimmy Bullards deft turn left Sol Campbell on his backside before shooting past Jens Lehmann. 

Arsenal survived some late pressure to hold on for a first away league victory of the season, although Wigan boss Paul Jewell was far from downhearted. 

Champions Chelsea were frustrated during a goalless first half at Stamford Bridge where midfielder Frank Lampard equalled the Premier league record of 149 consecutive appearances. 

Second-half goals from Joe Cole, Hernan Crespo and Damien Duff secured the victory to get them back to winning ways after the defeat by Manchester United two weeks ago and extend their lead at the top to nine points. 

United responded to the sudden exit of skipper Keane on Friday with an impressive victory at Charlton to move up to third, 10 points behind Chelsea with a game in hand. 

Alan Smith put the visitors ahead in the first half with his first goal since May and Ruud Van Nistelrooy scored a late double after Darren Ambrose had equalised for Charlton. 

European champions Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 victory over struggling Portsmouth at Anfield.

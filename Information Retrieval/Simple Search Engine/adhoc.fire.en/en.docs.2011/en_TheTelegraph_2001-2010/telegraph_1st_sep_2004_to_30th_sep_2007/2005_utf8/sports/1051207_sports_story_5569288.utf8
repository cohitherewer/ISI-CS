 Ponomariov beats Van Wely

Khanty-Mansiysk (Russia): Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine, once the youngest Grandmaster of the world, made a very strong statement defeating Dutch GM Loek van Wely in the first game of the pre-quarter finals of the world chess cup here today. 

Ponomariov, who played black, now needs just a draw in the return game to advance to fifth round. 

In the eight games on Tuesday, only three produced decisive results and the big gainers were Russians Alexander Grischuk and Sergei Rublevsky, who accounted for Gata Kamsky of the United States and Konstantin Sakaev of Russia, respectively. 

The lone teenager left in the fray ? Magnus Carlsen of Norway ? impressed yet again with an easy draw against Russian star Evgeny Bareev. 

Playing black, Carlsen showcased his deep opening preparation in the Nimzo Indian defense game to hold the fort in just 22 moves.

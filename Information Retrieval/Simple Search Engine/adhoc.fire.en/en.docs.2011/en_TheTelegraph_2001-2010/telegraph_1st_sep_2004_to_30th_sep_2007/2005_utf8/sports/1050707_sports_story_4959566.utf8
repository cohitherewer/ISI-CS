 France reacts with stunned disbelief 

Paris: France reacted with stunned disbelief on Wednesday when Paris was beaten by London in the race to host the 2012 Olympic Games. 

The French had been confident of success and silence fell over a nervous crowd watching a large screen outside Paris City Hall when International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge announced the surprise decision. 

The questions began immediately ? was it another sign that France is doomed to fail or the result of more aggressive British lobbying and behind-the-scenes deals? 

How had a bid that had been the favourite for so long ended up being pipped by four votes by a British campaign that seemed to gain momentum in the final days? 

There were no easy answers to be found. Thierry Rey, another former Olympic judo champion, summed up the sense of incredulity surround the French camp. 

Officials were at a loss to explain Paris third failed bid in the last 20 years. I just dont understand, Franco-American NBA basketball player Tony Parker said. 

Henri Serandour, president of French Olympic Committee, said Paris appeared to have lost because the countries that backed third-placed Madrid did not swing in large enough numbers to the French capital in the final round. 

French media had also widely reported suggestions that Britain was using underhand tactics in last-minute lobbying to win the Games, notably by openly sniping at the French plan. 

In Paris Gare du Nord railway station, the terminus for the Eurostar train service with London, reaction was split down national lines.Im disappointed. We hoped Paris was going to win, said one employee. He wore a T-shirt with Im supporting Paris on the front and Im supporting London on the back ? but said his preference had always been for Paris. 

In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg remained in a positive mood despite witnessing his city fail in its bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. (Reuters)

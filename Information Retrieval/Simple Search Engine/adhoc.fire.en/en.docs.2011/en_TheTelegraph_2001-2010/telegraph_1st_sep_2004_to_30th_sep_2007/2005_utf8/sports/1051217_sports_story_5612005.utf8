 Aperitivo has no peers in field of 6 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It may pay to follow Aperitivo, not only in Saturdays main event, the 1,600m Calcutta Gold Cup, but also during the rest of the season. The prized Vijay Singh-trainee has no peers in the field of six, and is in a different league altogether. The Diffident- Dramatic Irony, four-year-old, has been making his presence felt in most of the premier events in the country, and the opposition he is taking on, and also in his future RCTCs starts, may not match his stature.

 Aperitivos recent victory over Formal Invitation, in the 1,400m Mayfowl Cup, was an emphatic one. Agreed, the Invitation had lost some ground at the start but the Calcutta Derby winner had the race all sewn up nearing the distance-post. More importantly, the extra Gold Cup-furlong would be a greater comfort zone for Aperitivo than the Invitation or and the ageing Adolfito. C.Alford partners the Deepak Khaitan-owned money-spinner.

 Vijay and Alford may also be counted upon to lift the Elusive Pimpernel Cup and the Fame Star Cup through Romantic Fire and Regal Romance. Both trophy eve-nts have great sentimental value for the trainer and the owner.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

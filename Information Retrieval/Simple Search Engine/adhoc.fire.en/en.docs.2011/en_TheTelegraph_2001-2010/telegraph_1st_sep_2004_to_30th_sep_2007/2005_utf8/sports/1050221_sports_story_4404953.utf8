 Shivraj better but still unconscious

Jaipur: The condition of polo player Shivraj Singh, who suffered a serious head injury when he fell from his horse during a match here, was improving though he was not completely out of danger. 

Shivraj, the only son of the erstwhile royal family of Jodhpur, was still unconscious but improving, according to the doctors attending to him. ?Though he is not totally out of danger he is improving. His organs are functioning and he is responding, which is a positive sign,? they said. 

Giving further updates, Rajasthan Polo Club secretary Vikram Rathore said the doctor also do not feel the need for an operation to remove the blood clot in his brain. 

Shivraj had a bad fall from his horse when he was trying to take a near side shot during a match at the Rambagh polo ground on Thursday. 

He lost his balance and suffered the injury as the horse of a rival team player, coming from behind, crashed into his horse. 

Meanwhile, noted neurologist Dr S.R. Dharkar, who is attending to the player, said Shivraj was suffering from brain stem injury and multiple contusion and was still unconscious. 

?Shivraj has been put on ventilator in the ICU of the Sawai Man Singh Hospital,? Dharkar said, adding it could take 10-15 days for him to recover from multiple contusion (blood clots) but the brain stem injury was serious and would take much more time.

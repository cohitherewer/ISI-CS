 Fragile top order worries Woolmer

Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer called on Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan and tried to convince him that the team was improving with every game and he was optimistic about the upcoming tour of India. 

?Woolmer told the chairman that the team was improving with every game and was optimistic about the forthcoming tour,? sources close to Shaharyar said. 

Woolmer, however, expressed concern over the fragile top order, which he believed was the root cause of their debacle down under. ?His only concern is the top order failure that, according to him, was the root cause of Pakistan?s failure in tri-series final against Australia,? the sources said. 

During the meeting, which Woolmer described as ?productive? before leaving for South Africa, the coach gave his viewpoints on various issues on the recent Australian tour and the forthcoming visit to India, besides discussing other cricket-related matters. 

?Basically, Woolmer gave his views on the just concluded Australian tour and on the possible team combination for the forthcoming Indian tour,? the sources said, adding, ?Woolmer also complained about the standard of umpiring in the tri-series finals.? In reply, Shaharyar assured Woolmer of his complete support and hoped that the team would soon start winning. 

According to manager Haroon Rashid, Woolmer will return on February 19, a day after announcement of team for the India tour. (PTI)

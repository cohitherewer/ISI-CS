 Sao Paulo: Three-time Fifa Player of the Year Ronaldo said he regretted his break-up with Brazilian model and television hostess Daniella Cicarelli, but said he found solace in his work and his family.

 ?Unfortunately it all happened very fast, but now it?s time to move the ball ahead,? the Real Madrid striker said in an interview.

 It was the first time Ronaldo had spoken publicly of his highly publicised break-up with Cicarelli, barely three months after their lavish engagement party at a castle north of Paris on Valentines Day. ?I have to do my job the best I can and keep moving forward,? he said, without explaining the reason for the break-up. 

 London: Everton?s David Moyes has been named Manager of the Year after guiding his team to fourth in the Premier League to earn a place in next season?s Champions League, Sky Sports News reported on Tuesday.

 Moyes won the League Managers Association (LMA) award in the face of strong competition from Chelsea?s Jose Mourinho, whose team won their first league title for 50 years, and Rafael Benitez who has steered Liverpool to the Champions League final.

 It is the second time the Scot has received the honour after his success two seasons ago when his side missed out on qualification for the Uefa Cup on the last day of the season. 

 Tokyo: North Korea have grudgingly accepted Fifa?s decision that they must play next month?s World Cup qualifier against Japan in Bangkok, a Japanese newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 Lee Kang-hong, vice chairman of North Korea?s football association, had written to Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) asking to play the game at home or in Beijing, but it arrived too late.

 Last month, Fifa pulled the plug on Japan?s politically sensitive visit to Pyongyang on June 8 after crowd disturbances following a World Cup qualifier with Iran. 

 Athens: Four Aris Salonika soccer fans have been handed suspended jail sentences for their part in the violence that caused Sunday?s league match against Iraklis to be abandoned before halftime.

 The four men were found guilty by a misdemeanours court in Thessaloniki of breaking the sports law which bans people from entering the field of play and attempted grievous bodily harm.

 Paris: Argentine players Mariano Zabaleta and Agustin Calleri have pulled out of the French Open starting on Monday because of injuries, organisers said on Tuesday.

 Zabaleta has a foot injury while Calleri has a sore back. Frenchman Julien Benneteau and Spaniard David Sanchez replace them in the men?s singles draw of the Paris Grand Slam. 

 Mumbai: Holder and national champion Alok Kumar will defend his title in the Asian snooker championship while five other Indians will also be seen in action in the tournament to be held at Punes pyc Gymkhana from July 3 to 10.

 Waqar wants contract till 2007 Cup

 - I?m going to be happy if somebody takes care of the quicks: Woolmer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Waqar Younis, who retired last April, 

has turned down the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) offer of bowling coach till the 

May-June tour of the West Indies. 

Instead, he has specifically conveyed he wants a contract till the 2007 World Cup ? beginning, of course, with the trip to India starting Monday. 

The matter will now be discussed by the PCB?s ad-hoc 

committee which meets in Karachi on Thursday. According to The Telegraph?s 

sources, there?s no other contender for what is a new post. 

As of now, then, it?s either the former captain or nobody. 

Waqar has reasons for wanting security ? the PCB, after all, is known to fire quicker than some of Shoaib Akhtar?s fastest deliveries. 

Coach Bob Woolmer, by the way, isn?t opposed to the appointment of a bowling coach. 

Speaking exclusively on Tuesday, he said: ?It?s not an issue... I?m going to be happy if somebody takes care of the quicks, who aren?t heavy on experience. Moreover, I?ll get time to focus on other areas.? 

Woolmer, however, did add ?whoever? gets the job should 

work within the system he has put in place and not be out of sync. That?s reasonable.

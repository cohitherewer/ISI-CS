Hyderabad: A new chapter in Indian sports unfolds on Thursday as the much-awaited inaugural edition of the Premier Hockey League kicks off at the floodlit Gachibowli Stadium here. 

Among the many firsts that the event would bring to Indian hockey, the most important would be the touch of professionalism with 13 foreign players showcasing their skills in the Rs. 71 lakh prize money extravaganza. 

The matches would be played in double-leg round-robin format, with five teams featuring star players in the premier division vying for the winner?s purse of Rs 30 lakh and as many in the first division, the winner of which will bag Rs 4 lakh. 

The spotlight would be on Pakistan?s short-corner specialist Sohail Abbas, who would appear for Hyderabad Sultans led by Indian skipper Dilip Tirkey in the premier division. 

The hosts take on Sher-e-Jalandhar, captained by star Indian forward Gagan Ajit Singh, in the inaugural tie. 

Bangalore Hi-Fliers, headed by Arjun Halappa, Maratha Warriors (captained by Viren Rasquinha) and Chennai Veerans (led by Ignace Tirkey) are the other three teams in the fray. 

Gagan Ajit, who opted to be silent on the Gill?s remarks that he needs to go back to basics, said that his team would start as the favourites as they had a strong defence and attack. 

Maratha Warriors too have a strong defence and equally aggressive forwards in Dhanraj Pillay and Viren Rasquinha with talented Indian custodian Adrian D?Souza guarding the post. 

Chennai Veerans have a good mix of experience and youth with Tirkey at the helm. Bimal Lakra, Spanish star Juan Paablo Escarre and goalkeeper Devesh Chauhan make the team more formidable. 

Hyderabad Sultans, despite having the services of Pakistan?s Abbas and Wasim Ahmed, look a moderate team while Bangalore Hi-Fliers have a balanced side with Prabodh Tirkey, Mudassar Ali Khan, Len Aiyappa and Pawal Lakra in their ranks.

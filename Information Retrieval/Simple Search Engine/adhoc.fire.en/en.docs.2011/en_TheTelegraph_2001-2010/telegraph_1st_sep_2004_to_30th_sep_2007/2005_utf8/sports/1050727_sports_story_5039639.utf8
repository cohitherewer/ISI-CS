 Soumyajit fails to qualify 

New Delhi: Indias Aniket Koparkar and K. Shamini qualified for the knock-out stage in the boys and girls singles, respectively, in the 11th Asian Junior Table Tennis Championships on Tuesday. 

On a day when the Japanese maintained their supremacy in the boys singles, 23 players qualified for the knock-out round of 32, of which the top nine players will directly enter the pre-quarter finals as they get a bye in the next round. 

However, top junior Soumyajit Sarkar failed to make the cut crashing out from group 15. Sarkar raised hopes after beating Linjawi Jassem of UAE 11-7, 11-7, 9-11, 11-4. But later on, he went down 7-11, 8-11, 7-11 to Chinese Xu Xin. 

Soumyajit is the reigning national junior champion, and the Calcutta player won the South Asian meet just a few days ago. 

Koparkar, who topped group 19 winning both his matches, will now face Li Kwun Ngai of Hong Kong. If the unseeded Indian gets past Ngai he will run into 15th seeded Kang Dong-knog of South Korea. 

Koparkar, who was fortunate enough to be placed in an easy group, opened with a 11-7, 5-11, 11-9 11-3 win over Al Saadi Mohammed Nasser of Qatar before booking his place in the knock-out round beating Seah Jun Wen of Singapore 11-8, 11-9, 11-6. 

K. Shamini, who won the South Asian junior title here last week, made the grade from group 13 with wins over Lee Hon Ching of Hong Kong 11-8, 8-11, 11-6, 11-9 and Prajapati Rita of Nepal 11-4, 11-6, 11-4. 

In the cadet girls, Neha Aggarwal stormed into the semi-finals beating Ye Jin-nam of South Korea 11-8, 11-8, 11-3. 

Among the girls, Madhurika Patkar, Pallavi Kundu and J. Swarna all bowed out in the preliminary round. 

In the boys group 12, R. Abhishek blanked Kou Hon Seng of Macau 11-6, 8-11, 11-4, 11-9 but failed against Liu Miao of China and went down 11-9, 4-11, 3-11, 9-11. (PTI)

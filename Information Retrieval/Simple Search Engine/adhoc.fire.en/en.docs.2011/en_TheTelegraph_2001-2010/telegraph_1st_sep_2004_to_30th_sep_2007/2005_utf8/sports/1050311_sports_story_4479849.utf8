The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Intikhab, Aamer slam Woolmer

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Virender Sehwag?s savage attack on the Pakistan bowling is bound to have a demoralising effect on the side during the rest of the tour. The knives are being pointed towards Bob Woolmer and it is evident that the team is missing one Mr Shoaib Akhtar on this tour. 

Not that India haven?t won when the fast bowler has been around. But his mere presence was sure to have a psychological effect on the Indians, feel former captains Aamer Sohail and Intikhab Alam. If the mental battle is to be won, a fit-again Shoaib has to be brought back at the earliest. ?The relaxed look on the face of the batsmen could have then be avoided,? they agreed. 

Sohail and Intikhab also agree that not having a bowling coach for the inexperienced attack has proved to be ?disastrous?. ?Not having a bowling coach is a mistake. When Waqar (Younis) was all too willing, why didn?t the PCB agree to his terms. He could have made a world of difference,? says Sohail. 

?Waqar could have guided Sami and Co. on how they should have bowled session to session? On how to change the line against certain batsmen by coming over/round the wicket,? he told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

?Waqar?s rich experience could have come in handy in these conditions. The way the bowlers crumbled under pressure Wednesday and Thursday wouldn?t have happened,? felt Intikhab. 

?There?s been absolutely no planning? It?s very unfortunate. The job of a coach is to brief the bowlers on the line they should adopt against every individual, but that hasn?t happened. They have been bowling the same line to Sachin and Sehwag. There?s been just too much width on offer,? the former coach explained. 

Intikhab, for example, wants Danish Kaneria to bowl with a more side-on action to reap the maximum benefits. ?He has a good googly and the temperament to be an useful leg-spinner.? 

Sohail was livid too. ?There?s no definite gameplan. If you come on a tour and you know well in advance that you don?t have the resources, you?ve got to work on your strategy. 

?I see no wish on the bowlers part to work on the opposition?s weakness? You give someone like Sehwag width outside the off stump and he will destroy you and that?s what happened here. It only shows Bob Woolmer in very poor light? It?s been pathetic,? Sohail remarked. 

Sohail says there are plenty of good bowlers back in Pakistan and they are paying the price for wrong selection. 

?There are plenty of bowlers. We?ve been playing Naved-ul Rana for a year, but then there were quite a few who were played and dropped too. To save their skin they had to stick to these players and that is why they did not chose to send new bowlers for this tour.?

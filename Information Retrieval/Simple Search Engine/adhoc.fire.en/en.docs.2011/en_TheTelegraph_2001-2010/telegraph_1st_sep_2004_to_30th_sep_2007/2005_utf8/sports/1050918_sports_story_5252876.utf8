 Gatlin sprints to victory

Shanghai: Olympic champion Liu Xiang swept to victory in the 110m hurdles on Saturday in front of his home crowd at the Shanghai Grand Prix. 

Liu, who equalled the world record of 12.91 seconds to win the Olympic title in Athens, beat four-times world champion Allen Johnson of the United States. 

World and Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlin took the first place in sprint, beating fellow American Leonard Scott in 10.01 seconds. 

Gatlin is the second man after compatriot Maurice Greene to win the 100-200 double at last months Helsinki World Championships. 

Kenenisa Bekele, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) male athlete of the year, won his final race of the season, taking the 3,000m in seven minutes and 36.36 seconds. 

The Ethiopian who won the IAAF award earlier this month having retained his world 10,000 metres title, won the world cross long and short course races for the fourth successive year. He broke his record for the 5,000. 

Female athlete of the year, Russian world mark holder Yelena Isinbayeva, won the pole vault with a comparatively modest height of 4.65m.

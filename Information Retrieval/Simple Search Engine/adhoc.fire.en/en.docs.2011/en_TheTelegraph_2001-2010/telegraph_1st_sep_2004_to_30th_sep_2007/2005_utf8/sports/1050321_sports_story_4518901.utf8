 Ranadeb in India A squad

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose has included in the 14-member India A squad for the one-day warm-up match against Pakistan in Hyderabad on March 30. 

Dinesh Mongia will lead the side, while Mahendra Singh Dhoni will keep wickets. 

Youngsters Shikhar Dhawan, Robin Uthappa, Suresh Raina and Venugopal Rao have also been included. 

Meanwhile, Mohammed Kaif travelled to Bangalore with the rest of the Team India squad (barring captain Sourav Ganguly who will fly on Monday) to undergo physiotherapy there. 

As expected, the national selectors decided to retain the same XIV for the final Test starting in Bangalore on Thursday.

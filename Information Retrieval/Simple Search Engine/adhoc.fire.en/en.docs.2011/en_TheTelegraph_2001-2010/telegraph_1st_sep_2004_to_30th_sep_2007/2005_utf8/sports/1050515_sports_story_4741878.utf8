Irving: Tiger Woods record run of 142 successive cuts came to an end as Sean Hair and Brett Wetterich tied for the second-round lead at the Byron Nelson Championship on Friday. 

It was only the third time in his career that world No. 1 Woods had missed the cut. 

World No. 5 Retief Goosen of South Africa also missed the cut by a stroke after a 71 for 141. 

Woods followed his opening 69 at the TPC at Four Seasons Resort Las Colinas with a 72 at the Cottonwood Valley Golf Club, the other course being used this week, as he failed to beat the halfway guillotine by one stroke with a one-over total of 141. 

The last time he missed the cut was at the 1998 Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Its never a relief when you miss a cut. Ive missed three of them so far in my career and none of them feel very good, especially when you bogey the last hole, Woods said. 

Woods was level-par for the event when he bunkered his approach at the 18th. As he studied the line from both directions, there was a quiet tension normally found in a play-off at a major championship. 

He splashed out to 15 feet but failed to sink his putt for a regulation four. 

Every guy in the locker room was watching, Jesper Parnevik said. Were not allowed to bet, but guys were offering $1,000 he would make it. 

It was always going to come to an end eventually, wasnt it? Robert Allenby said. Obviously, it was a hell of a feat. That record will never be broken. 

Woods said: Its disappointing any time you miss the cut because youre here for four rounds to try to compete to win and now I dont get that opportunity to win the golf tournament. 

I just had a tough day. Its just one of those days. 

Ironically, it was Nelsons 54-year-old PGA Tour record of 113 consecutive cuts that Woods eclipsed in November 2003. 

At the top of the leaderboard on Friday, Hair fired a five-under 65 and Wetterich recorded a 67 as the two unheralded Americans finished nine-under on 131. 

Hair, 22, who has one top-15 finish to his credit from 11 Tour events, signed for a flawless card after mixing three birdies with an eagle. Wetterich, 31, has missed the cut in his last three outings. 

Ted Purdy was alone in third place after compiling a 67 for 132, one in front of Billy Mayfair (63). 

World No. 4 Phil Mickelson carded a 66 and was among a group of nine players on five-under 135. 

Fijis Vijai Singh, who can reclaim top spot in the rankings with a top-three finish, was also on five-under after the world No. 2 registered a 67. 

Ernie Els birdied the final hole for a 72 and was at 4-under 136, and now has the longest active cut streak on Tour ? 20. 

The longest active streak in golf belongs to Annika Sorenstam at 48 on the LPGA Tour. 

Ive got about a hundred to go, Sorenstam said from Atlanta. What a great run, especially with the competition on the PGA Tour. Its too bad to see such a great run finished.

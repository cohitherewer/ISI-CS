 New challenge for Railways

 - NATL ONE-DAYERS 

 Sanjay Bangar 

Mumbai: Ten teams, including hosts and holders Mumbai, would be fighting not only against their rivals but also the intense summer heat and humidity to earn the tag of national limited overs champions in the inter-state one-day All India Knockout tournament commencing here Friday. 

The seven-day event kicks off with Delhi taking on newly-crowned Ranji Trophy champions Railways at the Wankhede Stadium and Karnataka clashing with Orissa at the Brabourne Stadium. 

Mumbai and last year?s runners-up Bengal have been given a bye into the second round. Two matches would be played daily which would be held on April 14 at the Wankhede. The match between Railways and Delhi is expected to be a keen affair. 

Railways captain Sanjay Bangar said his team did not start with an advantage just because they won the Ranji Trophy. 

?Just as it?s a new day in a player?s career even if he had scored a hundred, taken a big wicket haul or got out for zero, so is the case with teams. It?s a new day, a new challenge and we start from scratch,? he said. 

SCHEDULE 

Apr 8: Karnataka vs Orissa (CCI); Delhi vs Railways (Wankhede). Apr 9: Mumbai vs Karnataka/Orissa (Wankhede); Punjab vs UP (CCI); Apr 10: Tamil Nadu vs Baroda (Wankhede); Bengal vs Delhi/Railways (CCI); Apr 12: 1st semi-final (Wankhede), 2nd semi-final (CCI); Apr 14: Final (Wankhede).

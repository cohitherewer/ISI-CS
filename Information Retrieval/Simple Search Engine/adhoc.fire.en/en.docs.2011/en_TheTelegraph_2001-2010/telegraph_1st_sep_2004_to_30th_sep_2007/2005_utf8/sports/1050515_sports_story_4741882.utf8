 Mauresmo in title round

 Amelie Mauresmo during her semi-final against Vera Zvonareva in Rome on Saturday 

Rome: Defending champion Amelie Mauresmo advanced into the final of the Rome Masters by brushing aside sixth seed Vera Zvonareva 6-2, 6-4 on Saturday. 

The win extended the Frenchwomans superb record in the Italian capital, where she has reached five of the last six finals. 

Zvonarevas record against the second seed did not leave much room for hope. 

The 20-year-old Russian, seeded sixth, had lost all six of their previous meetings, including a 6-2, 6-3 defeat at the same stage of last years Rome event. 

Both players began confidently, but Zvonarevas inconsistency from the back of the court cost her dearly. 

A couple of long groundstrokes and a netted forehand gave Mauresmo a break to establish a 4-2 lead. 

From there, the second seed seized control, chasing down a dropshot to flick back a crosscourt winner on the way to breaking for a 5-2 lead and closing out the first set in just over half an hour. 

Zvonareva hardly made an ideal start to the second, pushing an easy volley wide then double-faulting on break point to drop serve in the opening game. 

Mauresmos grip on the contest slipped only once, when a pair of double-faults allowed her opponent to draw level at 2-2, but she quickly composed herself, lashed a backhand winner down the line to break Zvonareva back to go 4-3 up and then served out to win. 

I was on holiday. I got down a little physically and also lost concentration, explained Mauresmo, of her brief lapse. 

I havent played this many games in a row for a while. Tactically I started playing in the wrong way, but Im very satisfied with the way I came back.

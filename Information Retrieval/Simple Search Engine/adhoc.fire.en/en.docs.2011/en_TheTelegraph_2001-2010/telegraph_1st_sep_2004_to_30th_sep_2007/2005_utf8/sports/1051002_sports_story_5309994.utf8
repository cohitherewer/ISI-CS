 Theres still some pain: Sachin

 Sachin Tendulkar arrives for practice at MIG Club in Mumbai on Saturday. He will be playing the Challenger Trophy in Mohali from October 10. (PTI) 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday said he was still feeling a bit of pain in his elbow but had been given the green signal by his doctors to play in the N. K. P. Salve Challenger Trophy after being out of action for four months. 

It (the elbow) still pains a little, but my doctors have declared me fit to play. I enjoy playing in the Challenger Trophy. It gives me a perfect platform to test my match fitness, he said after a net session at the MIG Club in Bandra. 

Tendulkar had undergone a surgery for tennis elbow problem in London at the end of May and has not played any competitive cricket since, though he has indulged in light practice sessions. Today he batted at the nets too. 

The ace batsman was given the go ahead to play Friday and was Saturday named in the India Senior squad to be led by Sourav Ganguly in the Challenger Trophy. 

He hopes to make his international comeback in the home series against Sri Lanka commencing on October 25. 

Tendulkar said his doctors told him that the discomfort in his elbow was a normal thing. 

They say its very normal and I dont have to worry about it, Sachin said. 

I am just going to go out there (Challenger Trophy) and give myself a chance and see what happens. I would know exactly where I stand and basically that becomes my target, he said. 

After the Challenger, I will be in a better position to figure out how it is, he added.

 Newcastle: Newcastle United skipper Alan Shearer may need hernia surgery but the timing of the operation is as yet undecided, the English Premier League club?s manager Graeme Souness said on Tuesday.

 The 35-year-old former England captain, who will retire from playing next summer, is trying to delay any operation at least until the break for internationals in the middle of next month.

 Despite his groin problem, Shearer has been included in the Newcastle squad that will take on Grimsby Town in a League Cup match on Wednesday.

 England striker Michael Owen has been excluded due to hamstring trouble.

 Tokyo: The second leg of this year?s Asian Champions League final has been switched back to Saudi Arabia from neutral Jordan, the AFC said on Tuesday.

 AFC officials had taken the unusual step of moving the game from Jeddah to Amman only 48 hours earlier.

 The first leg will go ahead as scheduled in Al Ain on October 26 with the second leg in Jeddah as initially planned.

 Rome: AS Roma were fined 25,000 euros by the Italian football league on Tuesday after a referee was hit by a coin thrown from the stands during the derby against Lazio on Sunday. The incident took place when Lazio won a free kick close to Roma?s area in the 74th minute.

 As referee Gianluca Paparesta positioned the ball he came under a hail of plastic bottles and coins, one of which hit him on the side of the face. He suffered only a minor cut and the match resumed, eventually finishing 1-1.

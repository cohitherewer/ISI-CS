The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Jones won?t come into picture

 - WRIGHT?S SUCCESSOR - Greg Chappell hasn?t sent CV as yet; Confusion over 

Dav Whatmore 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dean Jones in one of his ?Dean of Cricket? acts on TV 

Calcutta: Former Australian batsman Dean Jones 

is being talked about as a possible John Wright successor, but even if he sends 

his CV, the Board isn?t going to look at it with much interest. 

The top reason, according to The Telegraph?ssources, 

being bookie Mukesh Kumar Gupta?s testimony before the Central Bureau of Investigation 

(CBI) during its 2000 probe into match-fixing. 

The bookie, it may be recalled, claimed Jones was introduced to him (in Colombo) by Manoj Prabhakar in the early Nineties. 

Prabhakar has denied having done so but, then, his denials have never counted for much. 

Jones didn?t accept Gupta?s offer of $ 40,000 to provide details about Australia?s strategy and so on. However, the reason he gave for declining didn?t show him in good light. 

If Gupta is to be believed, Jones said ?no? as the then captain, Allan Border, had seen them interacting in the Taj Samudra?s lobby and his career ?could be in jeopardy.? 

That bit and more features in the CBI?s sensational 162-page report. Indeed, of relevance are excerpts from page 19: 

?Somewhere around that (early Nineties) period, there were some festival matches in Sri Lanka and many international players were taking part? Manoj Prabhakar was also taking part. MK rang up Prabhakar from India and requested him to introduce some Australian players? Prabhakar rang back and informed that all the players were staying at Taj Samudra, Colombo, and he could introduce Dean Jones to him. 

?MK immediately left for Colombo? Prabhakar was paid Rs 2 lakhs for this information. MK offered an amount of $ 40,000 to Jones to give him information about the Australian team?s strategy, morale, team composition and about the probable result whenever Australia played. Jones promised to think about the offer. 

?MK came back to India and Prabhakar also came back on the same flight? Jones rang up MK and told him he could not accept the offer since he suspected Allan Border had seen them talking together in the hotel lobby and his career could be in jeopardy?? 

Jones figures at the end of the CBI?s report as well (page 160, in the ?Conclusions? section), where the agency has identified nine ?foreign players? introduced to Gupta by Prabhakar. 

Meanwhile, the Board is informally accepting CVs from candidates for the Team India coach?s post. By the way, there?s no plan to advertise. 

Dav Whatmore and Tom Moody are understood to have sent their CVs, but there?s some confusion over the former. 

This confusion has been encouraged by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which insists Whatmore has extended his contract till the 2007 World Cup. 

Yet, sources in Dhaka maintain the terms have been negotiated even though Whatmore (who has coached Sri Lanka twice) hasn?t actually signed the contract. 

The high-profile Greg Chappell, who was a contender back in 2000 when Wright got the job, will send his CV if a request is made. 

Chappell wasn?t available for a comment, but a confidant informed the legend ?can?t be presumptuous.? However, it?s going to be different if the Board opens a line of communication. 

Eventually, as was done when Wright got the job, a committee will screen/interview the candidates. 

The new coach?s first assignment is going to be the 

July-August tri-series in Sri Lanka.

 Pathan No. 4 among allrounders

Dubai: The 2-0 series win over Sri Lanka has taken India to their best ever ranking of two in the latest ICC Test Championship table while Irfan Pathan broke into top five of allrounder rankings released on Thursday. 

It was the first time India have reached that high in the four-and-a-half year history of the official ICC Test championship race since it was launched in may 2001. 

Having overtaken England, India are now just 13 points behind Australia and that margin could be cut rapidly over the next two months, the ICC said in a statement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Billing England favourites is harmful

 - The series will be a real test for Woolmer: Imran 

MIHIR BOSE

Imran Khan is dismayed that Inzamam-ul-Haq, the Pakistan captain, and the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Shaharyar Khan, have already made England favourites for the Test series that begins in Pakistan next month. 

Speaking from his Islamabad home, Imran ? the former Pakistan captain now turned politician ? said: Inzamam has said England start as favourites, the Board chairman said England are formidable. Theyre going to destroy the Pakistan team by saying this. 

I can understand the newspapers and television commentators making England favourites. But I dont understand the captain and the chairman of the board making these statements. Whenever I stepped on the field I always thought we could beat anybody. I would never admit defeat before the match began. Otherwise you get into a negative mind-set. 

The series against England provides Imran with a sweet historical parallel. The last time England defeated Australia, 17 years ago, they followed it up with a home series against Pakistan led by Imran. England lost 0-1. 

Not that Imran thinks history will repeat itself. . 

Pakistans brittle batting will have to cope with Harmison and Flintoff. They are tall and get a lot of bounce. They also reverse swing it, said Imran, who helped to introduce reverse swing into English cricket when he played for Sussex. 

Imran is not surprised by the rise of Andrew Flintoff. 

He believes the key to any Pakistan success lies in their four fast bowlers. Shoaib, Sami, Naved and Umar Gul must perform, and then Pakistan have a chance. Gul was Man-of?the-Match in the Lahore Test against India, which Pakistan won, but then he was injured. Hes more like Glenn McGrath, high arm action, not extreme pace, but moves it both ways and in the air. Hes Pakistans best hope. quot; 

Imran is well aware that the series against England is crucial for Bob Woolmer, Pakistans English coach. Nobody in Pakistan worries about Bob being English; that isnt the issue. But this series will be the real test for him. They were wiped out in Australia, but in India they drew the Test series and won the one-dayers. The good thing for Bob is expectations are not high. 

I know one man who has been head of a cricket body for 30 years. We have generals who are in charge of our cricket. We have tremendous talent in this country, but theres no structure. You can have the talent, but you need a good structure to help produce the right technique, he said.

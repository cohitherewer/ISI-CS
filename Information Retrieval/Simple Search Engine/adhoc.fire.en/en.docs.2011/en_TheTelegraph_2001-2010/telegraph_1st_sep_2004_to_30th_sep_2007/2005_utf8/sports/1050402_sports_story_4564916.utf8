 J.P. Yadav 

Mohali: Stand-in skipper Pankaj Dharmani scored a gritty century but Punjab still conceded the first innings lead to Railways on the Day III of the Ranji Trophy Elite Division match here on Friday. 

Replying to Railways? 355, the hosts were bowled out for 309 runs as Dharmani (115) waged a lone battle. 

At stumps, Railways had stretched the lead to 169 runs as they reached 123 for two in the remaining 29 overs. 

Railways skipper Sanjay Bangar (43 batting) and allrounder J. P. Yadav (64 batting) were at the crease at close. 

Earlier, resuming at 159 for four, Punjab were reduced to 174 for six before Dharmani, who hit 12 fours and a six in his 246-ball knock, and Gagandeep Singh (17) added 68 runs for the seventh wicket. 

But Yadav, who claimed five of the six wickets to fall in the day to finish with figures of five for 83, struck again as he sent back Gagandeep and Vineet Sharma (10) in quick succession and Harvinder Singh bowled Rajesh Sharma to reduce the hosts to 258 for nine.

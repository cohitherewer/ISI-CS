 No rift in team, says Sachin

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Friday said that there was no rift among the team members following the recent spat between captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Greg Chappell and that the players and coach are one family and would remain so. 

The team and coach are together and would remain so though there can be different views. It is like a family where the members are having different views. By this, it cannot be said there is no unity in the team, he stated. 

Both the players and Chappell want to win. Only the paths they want to take (in trying to do so) may be different, the master batsman said. 

Sachin also made it clear that a media manager, who understands the language of players as well as the media, is a must for things to progress and to avoid any misquotes. 

He said the period away from the game was not only physically but also mentally tough for him. 

Talking to the media after his customary net session with his Mumbai teammates, he said: Things have progressed on the whole according to plans, barring a few days here and there. 

I felt comfortable while batting (in the nets). There is still a bit of discomfort but that is because the body is settling down. It does not prevent me from playing my shots. There is nothing to worry. 

Sachin said he was still using a bat with which he was comfortable with.I am sticking to what I feel comfortable in. It has all been done in consultation with the doctors who have been treating me and not those who dont know whats wrong with my elbow, he said when asked if he would change the weight of his bat.

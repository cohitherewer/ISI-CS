 Injured Gibbs to withdraw 

Durban: Injury will force Herschelle Gibbs to withdraw from the World XI team to play Australia next month, reported a South African website on Thursday. 

The opening batsman has been named in the World XI squad that will take on the world champions Australia in the one-day matches of the inaugural Super Series in Melbourne in October 

Gibbs told a news channel that he has hurt his right knee on the West Indies tour in April and subsequently aggravated the problem while playing for English club Lashings. 

I am withdrawing from the World XI side, the website quoted Gibbs. 

He also added that: I have just told the manager Goolam Rajah (who is also the South African teams manager) that I wont be able to play. I have worked with the Western Province physio since my return from my Lashings duty but I am still feeling the pain.

 Jordan to test new car today 

London: Jordan will test a heavily revised car in Barcelona on Thursday that the Formula One team hopes will allow them to challenge Red Bull and Sauber. 

Until we conduct our initial track test at Barcelona on Thursday and Friday, it is hard to say exactly how much of an improvement the new EJ15B will be, said sporting director Adrian Burgess. 

The results are a long study of the problems we have with the current car. We have addressed as many points and issues as we could without designing a completely new car. This is an updated version. 

Burgess, who took over as sporting director this month when Trevor Carlin left the team, said the Toyota-powered car should be more efficient than the old one. (Reuters)

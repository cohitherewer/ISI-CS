 Spain pip India to third spot

 - JUNIOR WORLD CUP HOCKEY 

Rotterdam: Defending champions India missed out on the bronze medal after going down 5-6 via tie-breaker to Spain in the Rabobank Junior World Cup hockey tournament here Sunday. 

India, who led 1-0 at the break on a ninth minute penalty corner goal by Hari Prasad, failed to build on the advantage as Spain equalised in the 38th minute through a Jorge Rodriguez penalty corner conversion. 

In the tie-breaker that followed the barren extra-time, Spanish goalkeeper Andreu Mollet dived low to his left to stop Vivek Guptas attempt with the first stroke and that turned the tide against India. 

Spain converted all their five strokes through Miguel Delas, Jorge Rodriguez, David Alegre, Andreu Enrich and Pepe Borrell in that order. For India, Dhananjay Mahadik, Sandeep Singh, Tushar Khandekar and Ajmer Singh came good. 

The Indian camp thought they were done in by an umpiring blunder in the 65th minute when a goal by V. Raja, who deflected a Sandeep Singh free-hit, was disallowed. Umpire Nathan Stagno from Gibraltar first awarded a goal to India. An official announcement was also made to this effect. 

However, the Spanish players surrounded Stagno and disputed the decision. Stagno consulted his colleague Erik Klein-Nagelvoort (Holland) and then reversed his decision to award a 16-yard hit to Spain. 

Stagno ruled that an Indian player had lifted the ball dangerously when in fact it appeared that the ball was first deflected by a Spanish stick and Raja swatted it home. 

Indias coach Harendra Singh said after the game: I do not agree with the decision. Even the other umpire (Erik) had made a note of Rajas shirt number. It was only after the Spanish players protested that Stagno consulted Erik and reversed the decision. It is high time that the FIH introduced a third umpire like in cricket to rule on close decisions. 

That apart, the game was evenly balanced right through with the Indians holding a slight advantage in terms of ball possession. But they were allowed little room due to tight marking and it was the individual skill of the players that saw India make several dangerous inroads. 

Spain, on the other hand, typically depended on counter attacks with a series of one-touch passes to rotate the ball and also move it upfield. But like India, the Spaniards too did not get a close look at the goal.

 Anand holds Kramnik

 - SOFIA MASTERS 

 Anand is in joint second spot 

Sofia: Viswanathan Anand played out an effortless draw with black pieces with classical champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the second round of the Mtel Masters chess tournament here. 

Local stalwart and world No. 3 Veselin Topalov also could do little with his white pieces against a well-prepared Michael Adams of England and signed peace in quick time through repetition of moves. 

The other game of the category-20 double round robin tournament, between the worlds top rated woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary and Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine, was drawn in 78 moves 

Kramnik, thus retained the lead with 1.5 points. Anand, Topalov, Adams and Polgar are close behind at this stage with one point each in their kitty. Ponomariov now has half a point. 

There are eight more rounds to come in this biggest event ever held in Bulgaria. 

Anand, who played while and drew against Topalov in the first round, gave a firm display as black in the Petroff defence game against Kramnik who employed one of the main lines. 

The middle game was on expected lines as anand sacrificed a pawn to get all his pieces to exert pressure on the weak white central pawns. 

Kramnik tried hard to keep his material advantage but Anand skilfully countered his plans to win back the pawn. 

Soon after the players arrived at an opposite colour bishops endgame wherein the draw was a just result in just 32 moves. 

Topalov and Adams played a shorter game moves wise but their duel lasted longer than Anands. Topalov went for the anti-Marshall variation and Adams appeared well-armed to tackle the opening. 

Giving the middle game a tactical shift, Adams opened up the centre with a pawn sacrifice and soon after Topalov had no choice other than to repeat the position. The game ended in 26 moves. (PTI)

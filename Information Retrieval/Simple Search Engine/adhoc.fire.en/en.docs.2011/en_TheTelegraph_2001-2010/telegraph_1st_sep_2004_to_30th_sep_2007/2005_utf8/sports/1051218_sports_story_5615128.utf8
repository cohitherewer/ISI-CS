Chennai: Australia and the Netherlands will be looking for their eighth title while arch-rivals India and Pakistan will battle to retain their position on the final day of the Champions Trophy hockey here on Sunday. 

The Aussies and the Dutch will both be looking out for an eighth title triumph, unprecedented in the 27-year history of the championship since it was first played in Pakistan in 1978. 

At the end of the league phase, Australia topped the table with 13 points, followed by the Netherlands (10), Spain (9), Germany (5), India (3) and Pakistan (2). 

With their morale high following improved performance in the last round league matches, India and Pakistan clash in a play-off match for 5-6 places. 

Both the Asian hockey powerhouses are out of medal contention, but much is at stake for either of them as only the winner qualifies for the July 2006 event in Spain. 

Argentina, having won the Champions challenge earlier this year, will replace the sixth placed team. 

For India it would also be an opportunity to settle scores with Pakistan who have denied them a bronze medal finish in the last three years by defeating them in the play-off. 

India hold the edge with their dramatic 3-2 win over Pakistan in their league match. 

But they cannot be complacent, given the fact that Pakistan had improved since then and turned out to be the lone team which managed to prevent the rampaging Australians from maintaining an all-win record with a well-fought 3-3 draw on Friday. (PTI)

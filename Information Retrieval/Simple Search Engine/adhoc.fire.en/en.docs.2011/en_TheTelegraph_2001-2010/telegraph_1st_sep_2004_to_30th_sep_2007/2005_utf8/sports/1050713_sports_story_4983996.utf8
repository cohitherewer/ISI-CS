The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 RCAs Modi asked to show cause 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The BCCI on Monday issued a showcause notice to Lalit Modi, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) president, on the basis of a complaint that he had been convicted by a US court for possessing cocaine and various other charges. 

[That Modi would at least be showcaused by the BCCI was reported by The Telegraph on June 3.] 

BCCI secretary S.K. Nair stated in a press release that the BCCI had asked Modi why disciplinary action should not be initiated against him including expulsion and monetary fines, since dealing with drugs was a serious offence under BCCI code of conduct.

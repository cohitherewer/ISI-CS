 Venues may be switched for first 2 ODIs

Karachi: The venues for Pakistans first two one-day Internationals against India in February may be switched due to a shortage of security personnel. 

India are due to tour Pakistan from January 5 and play Tests in Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi before one-day Internationals in Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan and Karachi. 

A senior Pakistan board official said the changes were necessary because security officials do not have enough manpower to police the second match. 

Since the 10-day period of Muharram (month of mourning) starts in the first week of February, the security officials say their manpower would be required to be posted at sensitive places in and around Islamabad and Rawalpindi on the 8th, the official said. 

There is normally a high security alert in those parts of Pakistan which have been hit by sectarian violence. 

Nineteen people were killed May in an apparent suicide bomb attack on a Shite shrine in Islamabad. 

The official said the board now wanted to hold the first match in Rawalpindi and the second in Peshawar to avoid complications. 

Obviously the security arrangements for the Indian team are of state level and we cant compromise on their security at anytime of the tour, he said. 

The final round of discussions of Indias inspection team with PCB officials were held on Wednesday. (Reuters)

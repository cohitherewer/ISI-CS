 Imran Khan slams PCB

Karachi: Pakistans former captain Imran Khan has blamed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for mishandling the itinerary of Englands tour this year. 

Imran told reporters on Thursday that the Pakistan cricket authorities had themselves given England the option of playing a Test or one-dayer in the southern port city of Karachi. 

England, after rejecting a proposal to play a Test for security reasons, will play just a one-dayer in Karachi on their tour from October 26. 

The board should never have offered England the choice of playing a Test or one-dayer in Karachi, said Imran. They should have insisted on having a Test in Karachi and not wavered from their stand specially after the bomb blasts in London, he added. 

The 52-year old came in for severe criticism last month when he supported Englands decision not to play in Karachi. 

But in an apparent U-turn he said that England needed to review their decision of not playing in Karachi as touring teams could not continue to pick and choose venues. 

There are security concerns everywhere given the prevailing circumstances. England must keep this in mind, Khan said. (Reuters)

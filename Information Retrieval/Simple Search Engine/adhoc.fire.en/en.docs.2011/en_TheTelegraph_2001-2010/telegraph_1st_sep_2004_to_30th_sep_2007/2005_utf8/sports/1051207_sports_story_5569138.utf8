 Ponting, Woolmer want rule changed

Wellington/Lahore: Australia captain Ricky Ponting and Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer want a change to the super sub rule being trialled in one-day Internationals by the ICC. 

In an experiment, due to be reviewed in April, teams are allowed to use super subs, although they have to be named before the toss, and also call their own power-plays ? five-over blocks with fielding restrictions. 

A bit of fine-tuning could be made to make the game even better, Ponting said. 

To be able to name your sub after the toss would work better for everybody. 

In its present form Id probably say scrap it because the team that loses the toss can quite often be stuck without having that other option, so its almost 12 against 11. 

Woolmer, whose Pakistan play their first ODI against England on Saturday, also thought naming a super sub after the toss would be fairer. 

I am actually not a great fan of it... I think it is loaded in favour of one side because you have to name your super sub before the toss, he said in Lahore. 

I think both sides should be allowed to name their super sub after toss. 

New Zealands Daniel Vettori said the power-plays could be spiced up if the batting team was also given the chance to decide when to implement them instead of just the bowling side. 

Itd be interesting. The 40th to 50th overs could be a bit of fun if the opposing captain had a say in those, said Vettori, who is captaining New Zealand in place of the injured Stephen Fleming. 

I think captains are just trying to get through them as quickly as possible as opposed to using them in any advantageous way. Thats probably not what they were designed to do but thats basically what theyve become.

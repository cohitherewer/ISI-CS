 Federer struggles

Berlin: An out-of-sorts Roger Federer was given a stern test by Swedens Robin Soderling before winning his first round match 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 at the Halle Open on Tuesday. 

The Swiss world No. 1, normally so dominant on grass, was playing his first match since losing to Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the French Open semi-finals last week. 

An inspired Soderling, ranked 35 in the world, took the first set and pushed Federer all the way, playing some thumping passing strokes and breaking the Wimbledon champion back in the third set to temporarily stay in contention. 

Play was interrupted in the sixth game of the final set with Soderling serving when the normally unflappable Federer complained that the Swede had stopped playing in the middle of a point after the ball appeared to land out.

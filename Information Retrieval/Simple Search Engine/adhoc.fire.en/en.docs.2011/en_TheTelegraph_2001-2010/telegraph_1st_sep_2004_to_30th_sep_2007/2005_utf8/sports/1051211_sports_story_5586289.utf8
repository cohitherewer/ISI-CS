 England defeat Pak

Lahore: Allrounder Andrew Flintoff smashed an unbeaten half-century and then took three wickets to inspire England to a comfortable 42-run win over Pakistan in the opening one-day match here on Saturday. 

Flintoff, who finished with three for 73, was ably by debutant pacer Liam Plunkett (three for 51) as the tourists dismissed Pakistan for 285 in 46.5 overs after scoring an impressive 327 for four.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC sleuths visit routine

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council hasnt reacted, but The Telegraphs sources in the world body have rubbished reports that its Anti Corruption and Security Unit is looking at the possibility of matches having been fixed during the two recent tri-series featuring India. 

Two of the Units three investigators (Alan Peacock and Martin Hawkins) did visit New Delhi between September 9-11, but that trip was strictly routine, a top source informed on Tuesday evening. 

[Jeff Reef is the third investigator.] 

He added: The investigators, who have now shifted to Dubai (from London), keep making periodic visits to countries where cricket is played? They update data and, if necessary, tap sources. Their job entails such trips. 

The top source insisted neither Hawkins nor Peacock met anybody either from the Central Bureau of Investigation or the Delhi Police. 

India finished runners-up in both recent tri-series ? in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.

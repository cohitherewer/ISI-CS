 Canadian Hartley claims 1m gold

Montreal: Canadas Blythe Hartley claimed the gold medal in the one-metre springboard event at the world swimming championships Monday, breaking Chinas domination of the diving competition. 

Hartley, the 2001 world champion on the one-metre board and a bronze medallist in 2003, led through the preliminaries, semi-finals and all five final dives to earn Canada their second medal of the championships with a total score of 325.65. 

Chinas Wu Min Xia battled back from a poor first dive that left her in fourth place to take the silver with 299.70, narrowly outpointing Germanys Heike Fischer who had to settle for the bronze with a mark of 299.46. 

Winners of a record six gold medals at last years Olympics, Chinese divers had been in devastating form and swept both golds in Sundays opening events, but Wu, a gold and silver medallist in Athens, could not extend the streak against the Canadian. 

I was nervous, even though I performed well in the prelims and the semis, because I still had to start at zero in the final, said Hartley, who was once coached by Chinese world champion Hui Tong. 

Just to have the consistency, knowing that I had done well earlier in the day, made me feel confident. I think I missed one dive early in the prelims, so for me thats pretty consistent. 

I dont think Ive ever been that consistent ever. 

Hartleys gold added to a dream start for the hosts, coming on the heels of a bronze from Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion in the 10m platform synchronised event on Sunday. 

With Canadas swimmers shut out of the medals in Athens, the countrys medal expectations for these two-week championships have rested squarely with the divers.

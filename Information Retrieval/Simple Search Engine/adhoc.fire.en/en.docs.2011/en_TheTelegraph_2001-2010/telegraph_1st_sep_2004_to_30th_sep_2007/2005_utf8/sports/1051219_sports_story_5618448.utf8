 Mystical strikes with degree of ease 

Hyderabad tips 

 HONKY DORY

 Ganapathy

 Mystical had no peers in the field of 11 vying for the 1,600m Indian 2000 Guineas at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Sunday. The S. Ganapathy-trained horse from Bangalore, won the rich event from the local challenger, Amazing Power, with a degree of comfort in a record timing of 1 minute 35.4 seconds.

 Jockey B. Prakash, who partnered the Alnasr Alwasheek-Mystic Memory son to a shade under two-length victory, had the 9-10 favourite settled in the mid-division before exercising his authority over the field.

 The afternoon also witnessed trainer Bharath Singh saddling in a winner, Golden Triangle ? his first after switching headquarters, from RCTC to Mumbai, on Sunday. The new track seems to have brought him luck. He sounded very happy while speaking to The Telegraph over his cellphone. Its a good beginning, I hope to do well with the small string of 12 horses in my care; said Bharath. The trainer also informed that his stock may improve during the February sales.

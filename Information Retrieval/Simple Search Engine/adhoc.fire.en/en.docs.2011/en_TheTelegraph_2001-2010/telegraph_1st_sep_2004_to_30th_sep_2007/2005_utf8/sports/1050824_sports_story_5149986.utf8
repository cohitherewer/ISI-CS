 Hadlee enjoying English show

 - Never seen so many Aussies hit on body and head

Melbourne: Richard Hadlee is enjoying watching English bowlers giving Australian batsmen a torrid time in the Ashes series. 

The legendary New Zealand allrounder, who tormented Australian batting line-ups during the 1980s, said on Tuesday it was absolutely magnificent to see Englands fast bowlers dictating terms in the 1-1 series, which resumes with with the fourth Test at Trent Bridge on Thursday. 

Hadlee is impressed with the way Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison have put the Aussie batsmen under sustained physical pressure. 

Australian bowlers have done it to the opposition so often, but for their batsmen now to be subjected to such treatment? Ive never seen so many Australian batsmen being hit on the upper body and the head, on the glove, guys jumping around the crease, Hadlee said. 

From a spectacle point of view its absolutely magnificent to see that, not because its Australia, but to see any quality fast bowler put pressure on quality batsmen with proven records, its a fascinating thing to watch. 

That, to me, is the true battle of what the game of cricket is about. 

Its obviously one country playing another, but the one-on-one battles and duels that go on (with) no quarter given and none asked ? who comes out on top? 

Those subtleties are what make the game for me. 

Hadlee believes the Ashes series could go down to the last day of the fifth and final Test. Theyre in uncharted territory, really... It could go down to the last Test, last day, last ball, he said. 

A major mistake by one or other teams, let alone individuals in the side, will determine the winners.

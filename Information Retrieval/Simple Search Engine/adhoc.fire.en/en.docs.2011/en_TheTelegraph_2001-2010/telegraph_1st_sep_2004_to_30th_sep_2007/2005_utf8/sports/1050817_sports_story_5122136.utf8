 Dreams may come good 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Bharath Singhs Bollywood Dreams enjoys a significant advantage over his 10 rivals in Wednesdays main event, the 1,200m Predator Cup. The Steinbeck-Liberty son is a horse for the course, and his lightweight may work to his favour in the hands of Mohammed Islam.

 The competition is, however, going to be tough in most of the days seven-event card. Raging Tide, for instance, may find a match in High Chief, who has already had an outing.

 The two horses ? Mischevious Notes and Rare Beauty ? nevertheless, are expected to make amends for their recent failures. If Mischevious Notes was beaten at the post due to the weak handling of apprentice J.Gurang, the Beauty was victim of a tardy start when ridden by Malcom Maseyk. Both horses now get the services of seasoned jockeys.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

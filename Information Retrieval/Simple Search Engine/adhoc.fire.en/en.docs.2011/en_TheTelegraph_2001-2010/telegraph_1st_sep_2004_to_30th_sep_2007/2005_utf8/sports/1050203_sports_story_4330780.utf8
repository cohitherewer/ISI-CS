The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak venue team ?unhappy?

Islamabad: The Pak venue inspection team, comprising 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) general manager (operations) Zakir Khan and Lahore 

SSP Sohail Khan, have returned home unhappy with the reception extended to them 

at some of the proposed Test and one-day venues, according to a report in the 

local media. 

?From what we know, Zakir has conveyed his reservations 

to the PCB chief about the reception and co-operation they got at some venues,? 

a source was quoted as saying in The News. 

The team was allegedly unhappy with the treatment they got when they visited Kotla in New Delhi, which is undergoing a massive facelift and is scheduled to host the fifth one-day International in April. 

The source said because of the incomplete feedback, the PCB might send the team again to India for an inspection just before the start of the tour on February 25. 

Meanwhile, PCB on Wednesday described as ?media speculation? that it had reservations on Ahmedabad as a Test venue. 

?The PCB has not said anything to (the) media on its reservations about Ahmedabad as a venue. It is all media speculation. We will convey our decision to the BCCI after receiving a report from the PCB team that visited India,? PCB spokesman Abbas Zaidi said. 

On whether the PCB has suggested Chennai as an alternative 

venue, he said so far no suggestion had been made. Zaidi further said that the 

report from the two-member security and venue assessment committee is expected 

in a day or two.

The PCB, he said, will take a decision only after 

the return of chairman Shaharyar Khan in a day or two from Dubai where he is attending 

the Asian Cricket Council meeting.

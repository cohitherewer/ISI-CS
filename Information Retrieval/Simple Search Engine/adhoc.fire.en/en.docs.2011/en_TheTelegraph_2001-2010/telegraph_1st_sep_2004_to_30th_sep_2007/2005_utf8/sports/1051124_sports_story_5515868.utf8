 Gayle has surgery

Adelaide: West Indies batsman Chris Gayle is out of this weeks third Test against Australia after undergoing corrective surgery for a heart complaint. 

The Jamaican was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat after complaining of dizziness during the second test in Hobart. 

Gayle said the condition was not serious and he initially planned to have the problem fixed once he returned home at the end of the tour. 

But team officials said he decided to have the procedure done in Melbourne on Wednesday, ruling him out of the final test, starting in Adelaide on Friday.

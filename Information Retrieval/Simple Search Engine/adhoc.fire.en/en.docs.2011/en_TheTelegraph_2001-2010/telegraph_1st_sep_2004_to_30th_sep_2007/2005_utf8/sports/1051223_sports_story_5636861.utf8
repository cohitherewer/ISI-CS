 Weekes wants Lara to lead

Port-of-Spain: Sir Everton Weekes believes Brian Lara should be reinstated as the West Indies skipper despite the record-breaking batsman having already had two spells in charge. 

I would think that Brian Lara would be the one to captain the side at this stage with his experience, said the West Indian legend. 

Frank Worrell was captain of the side when he was 36, 37 or even older and he is still accepted in the view of many as the best West Indies captain weve ever had. 

And Brian Lara can do that chore I believe. Hes an intelligent player, hes an intelligent person, and if I were the selectors, I would offer him the job. Youve got be a thinking player to perform like he does, Weekes told a local paper. 

The 36-year-old Lara led the West Indies twice before. He was replaced as skipper earlier this year by Shivnarine Chanderpaul who has so far won one Test and lost seven in 11 games. 

Lara has also fallen foul of the West Indies authorities in 2005 after sitting out last Julys tour to Sri Lanka as well as the first Test in South Africa in March after a row over sponsorship. 

Lara, who is the top run-maker in Test history with an aggregate of 11,187 runs at an average of 54.04, has hinted that he wants to play in the 2007 World Cup.

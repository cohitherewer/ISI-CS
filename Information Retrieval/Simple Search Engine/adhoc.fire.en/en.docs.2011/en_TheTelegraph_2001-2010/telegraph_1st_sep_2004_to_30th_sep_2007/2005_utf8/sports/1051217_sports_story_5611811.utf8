 - Arsenal-Real clash in Champions League 

London: Eight stunning ties emerged from Fridays draw for the first knockout round of the Champions League, with Chelseas clash against Barcelona topping the bill. 

In another potential humdinger, Arsenal will meet nine-time champions Real Madrid ? the first competitive European meeting between the clubs. 

Defending champions Liverpool will continue their quest for a sixth crown against Benfica, who beat Liverpools English rivals Manchester United 2-1 last week to clinch their place in the last-16. 

Bayern Munich renew their rivalry with AC Milan, Ajax Amsterdam meet old foes Inter Milan while PSV Eindhoven and Olympique Lyon clash again following PSVs 4-2 quarter-final win on penalties last spring after the teams drew 2-2 on aggregate.

Chelsea and Barcelona clashed at the same stage last season when Chelsea won an astonishing tie 5-4 on aggregate despite a virtuoso performance from Ronaldinho who scored a breathtaking goal of individual brilliance in the second leg at Stamford Bridge. 

Barcelona won the first leg 2-1 in the Nou Camp on February 23, but Chelsea won the second leg 4-2 in London two weeks later after racing into a 3-0 lead inside 19 minutes. 

Reacting on the repeat clash, Ronaldinho said fans should expect another classic. 

It will be another top contest between two coaches with high tactical awareness, we should expect something good, said Ronaldinho. 

To go 0-3 down after 20 minutes is not normal by todays standards. We kept chasing the game, we scored two goals and then suffered another goal. It was a completely unique match. 

Barcelona and Juventus have been made joint favourites to win the Champions League. 

According to British bookmakers William Hill, Barcelona and Juventus were made 5-1 favourites

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 When Wright jumped for joy

 - Team India coach has a one-on-one with Dalmiya 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Among the many images to be recounted years on, specific to India?s maiden Test victory over Pakistan at the Eden, one to stand out will still surely be John Wright?s leap of joy when Anil Kumble dismissed Inzamam-ul Haq. 

The Team India coach, of course, isn?t known to show such emotion. So, what happened? 

?It was such a big wicket? Getting Inzamam gave us an even stronger hold? I suppose I did get excited,? Wright told The Telegraph, smiling. 

Sadly, he doesn?t appear inclined for an extension ? he has been around from November 2000 ? at the end of this season. 

In other words, Wright may not stay after the limited overs series against Sri Lanka. 

?At this moment, I?m not looking beyond this and the next series? The Board wants somebody till the 2007 World Cup and, as I?ve indicated, I would like to spend time with my two children back home,? he said. 

Wright, incidentally, had a one-on-one with Board immediate past president Jagmohan Dalmiya shortly after the second Test. 

Neither commented on that meeting, but it won?t surprise if the Board initiates a dialogue seeking to have the one-time New Zealand captain till 2007. 

Wright, after all, has played a big hand in the rise of Team India.

 Iberian may win main event in Mumbai 

 HONKY DORY

 Acindar, Iberian and Desert Conqueror are the three youngsters who are doing very well in their morning workouts and fight out the issue in the 1,000m J. Rustomji Soparivala Trophy, the main event in the Mumbai race card on Thursday. However, the Placerville Cambridge Ball filly from Darius Byramji?s stable commands respect over her superior bloodlines and may score in the hands of jockey C. Rajendra.

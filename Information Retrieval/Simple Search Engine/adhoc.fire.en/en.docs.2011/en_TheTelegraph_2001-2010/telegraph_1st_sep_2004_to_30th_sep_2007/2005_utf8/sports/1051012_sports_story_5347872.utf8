 World Cup 2011 hosts to be decided by April-May

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Sydney: Just who gets to host the 2011 World Cup will be decided by April-May next year. 

The process is going to begin by the end of this year, when the countries interested in staging the event will have to meet our requirements ? tax exemption, visas for all and so on... In fact, a tender is going to be put in place, International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani told The Telegraph. 

While Australia is banking on the rotation policy to work in its favour, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) wants the World Cup awarded to the region. 

Interacting briefly after the two-day Executive Board meeting, on Tuesday evening, Mani informed he personally favoured every third World Cup going Asias way. 

Reacting to the ACCs unhappiness over the Future Tours Programme, effectively the international calendar, he said: Its a misconception that the ICC is drawing up the Programme all on its own. Rather, were guided by the member countries. 

Mani added: The Asia Cup, for example, must be played. However, if the Asian Test Championship is revived, then there will be too many India-Pakistan matches and interest is bound to reduce. Ive asked the countries to have a re-look. 

Saying its not an issue, he confirmed that the ten-year programme would be extended by at least a year.

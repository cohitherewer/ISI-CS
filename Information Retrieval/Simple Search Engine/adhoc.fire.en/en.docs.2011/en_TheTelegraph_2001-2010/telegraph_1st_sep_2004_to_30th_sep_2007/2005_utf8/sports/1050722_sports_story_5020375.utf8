The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ferdinand at risk of paying for ride

 OLIVER KAY

 Short of tearing off his shirt 

 to reveal a Malcolm Glazer tattoo, it is hard to see what 

 more Rio Ferdinand can do to lower his popularity among 

 Manchester Uniteds more militant supporters. Perhaps 

 it is just as well that, after being jeered in matches away 

 to Clyde and Peterborough United in the past few days, he 

 will depart with his teammates for Hong Kong, where the 

 mere sight of a United player is likely to bring awe-struck 

 locals to their knees.

 The clubs millions of supporters 

 in the Far East are far from ignorant, but Ferdinand is 

 likely to find them more tolerant than those fans who, irked 

 by his refusal to sign a new contract worth upwards of ?100,000 

 a week, are becoming increasingly vitriolic in their criticism 

 of the ?30 million defender. 

 For that, he should be grateful, 

 given that his list of offences is growing by the week, 

 a run-in with Sir Alex Ferguson having followed Saturdays 

 friendly match against Clyde after he hitched a lift home 

 without the permission of the manager, who expected him 

 on the team coach.

 Ferdinands relationship 

 with Ferguson is becoming strained to the extent that he 

 has been overlooked for the captaincy in Roy Keanes 

 absence, for both friendly matches so far, with Wayne Rooney 

 leading out the team against Peterborough on Tuesday. 

 Ferguson has been clever in his 

 discussions of the defender in public, taking every opportunity 

 to urge him to sign a new contract without ever quite accusing 

 him of avarice. Yet he was furious with Ferdinand for his 

 latest indiscretion, with Old Trafford officials refusing 

 to say whether he had been fined.

 Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo were 

 also in the car that went back to Manchester from Scotland 

 but, while Rooney had permission to travel separately and 

 Ronaldo escaped with a stern rebuke, it is Ferdinand who 

 bore the brunt of the managers anger.

 As Ferguson has repeatedly said, 

 Ferdinand could end all the uncertainty by signing 

 a new contract, which does not sound too irksome bearing 

 in mind his claim that he wants to stay at Old Trafford 

 beyond the end of his contract in June 2007.

 His agent, Pini Zahavi, however 

 maintains that there is no need to do so and that the offer 

 made to him in April, though it has never been formally 

 rejected, will not be signed.

 The situation is becoming difficult 

 for United, faced with a diminishing asset, but David Gill, 

 the chief executive, refused to panic on Wednesday, even 

 urging supporters to empathise with the player. 

 I know people would snap 

 your hands off if they were offered that kind of money, 

 but it has to be right, Gill said. You have 

 to think about your worth. I respect him for that. Its 

 a crucial time in his career and he needs to be happy.

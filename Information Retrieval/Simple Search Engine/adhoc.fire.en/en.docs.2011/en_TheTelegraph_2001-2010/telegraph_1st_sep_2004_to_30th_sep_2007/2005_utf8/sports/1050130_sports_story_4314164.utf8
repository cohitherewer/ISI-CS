 Arsenal, Everton in 5th round

London: Arsenal, Everton and Newcastle United eased into the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday but Southampton needed a stoppage-time penalty to defeat 10-man Portsmouth 2-1 in their south-coast derby. 

Arsenal beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 with second half goals by Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira, from the penalty spot, and Fredrik Ljungberg. 

James Beattie scored his first goal for Everton in their 3-0 win over Sunderland, while Newcastle skipper Alan Shearer got their first in a 3-1 win over Coventry City.

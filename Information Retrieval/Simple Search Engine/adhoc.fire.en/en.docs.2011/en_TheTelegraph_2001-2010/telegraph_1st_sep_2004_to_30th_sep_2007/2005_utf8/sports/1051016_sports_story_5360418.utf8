 Big challenge for Sourav, says Kapil

New Delhi: Former India captain Kapil Dev said that Sourav Ganguly faced a big challenge in regaining his spot in the side after being replaced as skipper by Rahul Dravid. 

Sourav needs to prove to everybody that he still deserves a place in the team. It would be a big challenge for him, Kapil said. 

Responding to a specific query if the doors to the Indian team had been shut on Sourav, who is currently nursing a tennis elbow, Kapil said, he (Sourav) needs to perform to show that he belongs at the highest level of the game. 

Reacting to Dravid taking over as captain, the former skipper said a captain should ideally be appointed for a longer period of time. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 NZ team a laughing stock at home

 Black Caps have to bear Gilchrist taunts 

Wellington: The New Zealand cricket team has become an object of ridicule in its own country after another embarrassing loss to Australia in the limited-overs series. 

Australia beat New Zealand by seven wickets at Wellington?s Basin Reserve Tuesday to take a 4-0 lead in the five-match series. 

The winners reached their target of 234 with more than 15 overs to spare, giving them four victories in 10 days, with wins at Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland by 10, 106 and 86 runs. 

Considering the ease of the latest victory, Australia?s stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist wondered whether Australia might have become the first team to reach 400 in a one-day innings had they batted first. 

?Definitely, another 15-16 overs were left, so who knows where it could have finished, but that?s just guessing,? Gilchrist said. 

The New Zealanders might have been forced to endure Gilchrist?s mild taunts, but they also are hearing increased ridicule by their own public and media. 

A cartoon in a daily newspaper Wednesday depicted a limp-wristed New Zealand cricketer suggesting the Australians play the final one-day match at Napier on Saturday with one hand tied behind their back. 

The daily?s cricket writer, former international fast bowler Jonathan Millmow, described Tuesday?s loss as a disgrace and doubted the New Zealand public would heed the call of captain Stephen Fleming to keep faith with the team. 

?Just why the senior players have gone so horribly off the boil and why the young bowlers have no stock ball to rely on is anyone?s guess,? Millmow said. 

?New Zealand can consider themselves lucky to escape with a seven-wicket loss.? 

Another newspaper went further and openly lampooned the selection problems which now beset the Blck Caps? team. 

The one-day losses to Australia have been accompanied by an increasing toll of injuries, causing columnist Richard Boock to doubt whether New Zealand can assemble a competitive team for the first test that begins March 10 in Christchurch. 

?Expect mothers to start locking away their young sons this morning as the New Zealand cricket selectors gather to name their side for the first Test against Australia,? said Boock, the brother of a former New Zealand player. 

?Devastated by injury, stress and incompetence, New Zealand?s elite ranks have been stretched past breaking this summer, to the extent that anyone of eligible age and gender is in danger of being called up. 

?As New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming dryly noted this week, ?anyone in white clothing is in the frame at the moment?. 

?The mind boggles at the thought of a dozen frightened young men being herded into the stadium to begin preparations for the opening Test against Australia.?

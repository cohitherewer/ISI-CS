Paris: Champions League holders Liverpool and the team they beat controversially in the semi-finals, Chelsea, both progressed to the Champions League knockout stages. 

Liverpool drew 0-0 at home to Real Betis while Chelsea beat Anderlecht 2-0 in Brussels to ensure they joined them and should Chelsea beat the title-holders in a fortnight, they will top group G. 

Elsewhere, both Milan sides enjoyed comfortable victories with AC Milans Andriy Shevchenko scoring all four of his sides goals against Fenerbahce in Istanbul ? the first player to score four in an away Champions League match. 

It made it a happier night than last May in the same city for the Ukrainian when his was one of the penalties saved in the shootout that saw Liverpool complete a miraculous comeback and take the trophy. 

While AC Milan are still not guaranteed a place in the last 16 ? though they head a very tight group E after Schalke 04 beat PSV Eindhoven 3-0 with Georgian international midfielder Levan Kobiaschvili scoring the third hattrick of the night ? city rivals Inter are. 

Inter walloped Artmedia Bratislava 4-0 with Brazilian striker Adriano scoring a hattrick ? breaking his Champions League drought stretching back to August 10 ? in an empty stadium as they completed their behind-closed-doors punishment imposed by Uefa. 

Inters victory helped Rangers no end as the struggling Scottish Giants drew 1-1 with 2004 Champions Porto in Oporto, thanks to a debut goal in the competition from teenager Ross McCormack which lifted some of the pressure off embattled manager Alex McLeish. 

While Shevchenko, Adriano and Kobiaschvili took the goalscoring honours, the goal of the night came from Norwegian striker John Carew whose cheeky backheel through the legs of Roberto Carlos and past Iker Casillas gave French champions Olympique Lyon a 1-1 draw in Madrid against Real Madrid and guaranteed them of winning group F. Guti had scored for Real. 

Although Liverpool needed only a draw to reach the last 16, they were much the more adventurous, and were rarely threatened by a Betis team whose toothlessness befitted a side second bottom of La Liga. 

Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez said he was satisfied with the outcome, even, though, it extended lanky striker Peter Crouchs goalless drought since he joined in the summer.

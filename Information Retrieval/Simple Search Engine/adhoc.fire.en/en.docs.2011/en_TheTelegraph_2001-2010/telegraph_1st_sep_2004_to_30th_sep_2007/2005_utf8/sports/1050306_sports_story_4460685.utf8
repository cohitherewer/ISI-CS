The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sunny not to return as consultant 

 - Team India XI in Mohali may feature three seamers and just one spinner 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Sunil Gavaskar hasn?t yet been approached to return to the Team India consultant?s chair, but even if the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) makes a late call, he won?t come on board. 

The series against Pakistan, featuring three Tests and six ODIs, gets underway in Mohali on Tuesday. 

?I haven?t been contacted? Moreover, I?m not available,? Gavaskar told The Telegraph, when reached for a comment in Chandigarh on Saturday morning. 

Asked if there was a reason, he replied: ?No? Not really?? 

Gavaskar, in Chandigarh on a promotional visit, was the consultant in the last two series? at home ? versus Australia and South Africa. 

Of course, he didn?t sit in that chair on the tour of Bangladesh owing to TV commitments. 

That Gavaskar isn?t required to do ball-by-ball commentary in the about-to-begin engagements encouraged talk he would again join the team management. 

However, that isn?t happening. 

Apparently, with the TV rights jhamela taking centrestage, nobody in the BCCI thought of approaching Gavaskar. 

Now, it?s too late. 

Gavaskar?s appointment last October, it may be recalled, had been quite dramatic: He joined Team India just 36 hours before the start of the series against Australia. 

Meanwhile, according to well-placed sources, the Indian XI for the first Test could see three seamers and a solitary spinner. 

?The Mohali wicket has a bit of green and, so, a 3-1 attack is being discussed? If only one spinner is fielded, then Anil Kumble is going to be preferred over Harbhajan Singh,? one of the sources remarked. 

Among the seamers, Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan are certainties. If three get picked, either Ashish Nehra or Lakshmipathy Balaji will have to sit out.

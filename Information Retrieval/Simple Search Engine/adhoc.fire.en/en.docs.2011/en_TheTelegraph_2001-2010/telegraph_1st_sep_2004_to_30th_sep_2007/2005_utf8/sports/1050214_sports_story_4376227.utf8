 Suprs? striker apologises 

Cairo: Tottenham Hotspur striker Mido apologised on Sunday for his lack of discipline that has seen him excluded from the Egyptian national team since July. 

?There isn?t much I have to say today, all there is to say is that I came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes,? the 21-year-old, whose full name is Ahmed Hossam, said. 

Mido, who has 34 caps, was axed by Egypt?s former coach Marco Tardelli after claiming he had a groin injury, but he then played in a friendly for his club AS Roma within 24 hours of a World Cup qualifying match at home to Cameroon last September. 

In a news conference in the Egyptian capital, Mido said he hoped for a recall. 

?It?s not my right to give orders and say when I want to play... at the same time I will always make sure that I put the national?s team?s matches as my top priority. 

?I feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as I saw them play against Belgium (Egypt won 4-0 on Wednesday) and I simply want to add to their success.?

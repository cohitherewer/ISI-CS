 Suker questioned

Zagreb: Davor Suker, one of the biggest names in Croatian football, has been questioned for more than three hours by police after his business partner was shot dead at the weekend. 

A Zagreb police spokesman confirmed media reports that Suker ? the Golden Boot winner at the 1998 World Cup in France ? was interviewed on Monday, following the mafia-style execution of Dino Pokrovac. 

Pokrovac was outside his home in Zagreb when he was shot dead around 0300 local time (2400 GMT) on Saturday, police said. 

Suker and Pokrovac had jointly worked as soccer agents involved in transactions of players. 

The police investigation has so far included more than 200 people, many of them from the world of sport, the spokesman said, declining to give any more details.

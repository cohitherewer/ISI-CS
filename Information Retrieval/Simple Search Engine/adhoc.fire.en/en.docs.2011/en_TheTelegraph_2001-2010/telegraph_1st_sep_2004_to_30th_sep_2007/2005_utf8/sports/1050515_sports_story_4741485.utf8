 Lewis-Francis stripped of medal

 TOM KNIGHT

Mark Lewis-Francis has lost his sprint silver medal after testing positive for cannabis at the European indoor championships in March. Traces of the banned drug were found in the Britons urine sample after he finished second to his Olympic relay teammate, Jason Gardener, in the 60 metres in Madrid. 

Lewis-Francis, 22, who anchored the British 100m relay team as they won gold at the Olympics in Athens, blamed passive smoking in an explanation that was accepted by UK Athletics. He escaped a possible two-year ban and was warned about his conduct. 

It was the second time that Lewis-Francis has had to forfeit a silver medal. After the 2003 World Championships, where he was a member of Britains 4x100m relay squad, six British sprinters had to return their medals when it was announced that Dwain Chambers had tested positive for the designer steroid, THG. 

Lewis-Francis, who waived his right to a disciplinary hearing, kept his head down on Friday but issued a statement saying: I do not smoke cannabis. My only explanation is that I may, without realising it, have been in the presence of people who were smoking cannabis and that I passively inhaled their smoke. 

I have not knowingly taken this substance and have not attained any performance-enhancing benefits.

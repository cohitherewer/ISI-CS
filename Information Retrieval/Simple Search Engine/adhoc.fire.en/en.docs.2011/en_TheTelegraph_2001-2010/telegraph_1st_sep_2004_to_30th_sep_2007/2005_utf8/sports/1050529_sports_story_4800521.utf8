The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sporting rout Dempo 3-0

Kozhikode: Sporting Clube de Goas captain Dudu Omagbemi, ably supported by another Nigerian Chidi Edeh, led from the front to thrash Federation Cup and National Football League (NFL) winners Dempo SC 3-0 to clinch the ONGC Super Cup here on Saturday. 

Dudu, who scored 21 goals in the just-concluded NFL to bag the best player and best forward awards, was in superb form as he struck in the 11th and 82nd minutes, while Chidi scored in the 24th minute to give the win to Sporting, who had finished runners-up in the NFL. 

Handicapped by the absence of their main striker, Ranty Martins, and four other frontliners, Dempos hopes of completing a grand treble, were dashed by the fellow Goan rivals. 

The Dudu-Chidi combine, which scored 29 of Sportings 46 goals in the NFL, was again at it.

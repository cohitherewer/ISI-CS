 I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to hit the ball over the bowlers head I end up getting bowled. Why does this happen? (Maitrayan Chowdhury, 18, Karimganj) 

 Its because youre lifting your head too soon.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. I often end up giving too many wides during my spells. Please help. (Tamajit Patra, 14, Durgapur) 

 Make sure youre focusing on the spot you want the ball to land. Also, make sure your head is still and not popping all over the place.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. I am 82cm tall. I often fail to keep my balance and take a tumble on my followthrough. Why does this happen? (Sep. D.D. Reddy, 23, Apo) 

 Check your delivery stride. Its either too long or too short and hence you cannot keep your balance at the time of delivery.

 I am a right-handed batsman and face difficulty with short-pitched balls aimed at my body. How do I improve? (Rajiv Ranjan, 16, Bokaro) 

 Use the depth of the crease when playing back. Dont take your eyes of the ball at any stage.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. When trying to bowl a slower one I end up with a wide. Please help. (Samrat Ghosh, 15, Bardhaman) 

 Its a delivery that demands a lot of practice at nets. Go back to the basics and concentrate on the spot you want the ball to land.

 I am a left-arm spinner. I run out of ideas when the batsman is on the rampage. Should I continue flighting the ball or bowl flatish on such occasions? (Dipti Chowdhury, 17, Calcutta-21) 

 Its has to be a mixture of the two but make sure you are bowling the right line so that the captain can set a field.

 I am mediumpacer. How do I increase the pace of my deliveries. Will going to the gym and strengthening the shoulder and leg muscles help? (Amit Bardhan, 19, Kharagpur) 

 It certainly would help, but also a nice rhythmic run-up and bowling action is essential.

 I am a batsman and have benefitted from your advice in the past. My problem is I often get caught at short midwicket while driving. Please help. (Tapas Samaddar, 19, Calcutta-42) 

 Get closer to the pitch of the ball and make sure youre head is down when making contact.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Should I take a leg or middle-stump guard when facing up to pacers? (Rajiv Basu, 17, Calcutta-10) 

 Its your choice to make.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I often end up falling over the stumps when attempting the hook. Should I stand outside the crease? (Ritam Datta, 23, Calcutta) 

 No. The problem arises because you are taking your eyes of the ball and not well balanced. Youre not using the depth of the crease.

Mission Hills (California): Sweden?s Annika Sorenstam made it five wins in a row on the LPGA Tour, collecting her eighth major title with a commanding eight-shot triumph in the Kraft Nabisco Championship on Sunday. 

It was the 59th career victory for the world No. 1 and kept alive her dream of becoming the first golfer to achieve the Grand Slam of all four majors in one year. 

?I definitely want to get to 10 majors so I need two more,? said Sorenstam. ?To win a Grand Slam is very difficult but I?ll be trying.? 

Sorenstam led by five shots overnight and finished on 15-under-par 273 after a closing 68 that included an opening streak of three birdies in four holes from the second. 

American Rosie Jones, still without a major victory, was second on 281 after a 71, her third runners-up finish in a ?big four? tournament. 

The 45-year-old is planning to retire at the end of the year. Fellow-Americans Laura Diaz (68) and Cristie Kerr (71) tied for third place on five-under 283. ?I?m very excited and very happy,? said Sorenstam, 34. ?I couldn?t have asked for a better week and everything seemed to go my way. I will remember this Easter Sunday for a long time.? 

The win extended an unbeaten run for Sorenstam stretching back to the Mizuno Classic in Japan last November and she matched Nancy Lopez?s five-in-a-row record from 1978. 

The Swede also joined Amy Alcott and Betsy King as the only triple winners of the Kraft Nabisco. 

?I certainly think I am playing some of the best golf of my career,? added Sorenstam. ?I?m driving the ball well and my putting is good.? 

She said she had become even more focused after the break-up of her marriage to David Esch. 

Sorenstam, who filed for divorce last month, said: ?On the golf course is where I feel happiest. I love what I do and I know where I?m going?. 

She is now fourth on the all-time list for LPGA wins behind Kathy Whitworth (88), Mickey Wright (82) and Patty Berg (60). 

Whitworth?s record is not yet in Sorenstam?s mind. 

?I?m still 29 behind and it?s never been a goal because I don?t think I can get there. What Kathy did was incredible,? said Sorenstam. 

The Swede is unsure when she will try to make it six in a row on the LPGA Tour. ?I haven?t decided yet on my schedule,? she said. 

Fifteen-year-old American Michelle Wie was the top amateur for the third year in a row, finishing on level-par 288 after a 71.

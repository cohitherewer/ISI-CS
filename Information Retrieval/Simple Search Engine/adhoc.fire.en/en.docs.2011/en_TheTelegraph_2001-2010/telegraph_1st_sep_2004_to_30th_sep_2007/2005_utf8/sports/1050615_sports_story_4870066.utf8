 BCCI wants dates advanced

Thiruvananthapuram: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked Sri Lanka Crickets interim committee to advance by a week the triangular series involving India, Sri Lanka and the West Indies scheduled to start on July 25. 

The advancement is being sought to enable some of the Indian players to take part in the Asia XI versus Africa XI matches scheduled in August to raise funds for the welfare of players in the two continents and development of infrastructure for the newly-formed Afro-Asian Cricket Council, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said. 

We have already faxed the request to the Sri Lankan cricket authorities seeking advancement of the dates. We have said the convenience of West Indies should also be taken into account. If the proposal is not acceptable to the West Indies, the series could be held as scheduled earlier. 

The benefit matches for Afro-Asian Cricket Council has been scheduled for August 15, 18 and 21. 

According to the itinerary as of now, India will meet West Indies in the opening game of the triangular series from July 25 to August 7. All matches will be day-night games. 

PROPOSED ITINERARY 

July 25: India vs West Indies (Dambulla); July 27: India vs Sri Lanka (Dambulla); July 29: Sri Lanka vs West Indies (Dambulla); July 31: India vs West Indies (Dambulla); Aug. 3: India vs Sri Lanka (Colombo); Aug. 5: Sri Lanka vs West Indies (Colombo); Aug. 7: Final (Colombo). 

Sourav issue 

Meanwhile, Nair confirmed on Tuesday that the BCCI would take up the issue of the six-match ban imposed on regular India captain Sourav Ganguly during the ICCs executive and CEOs meetings to be held in London from June 24 to 29. 

In another development, the BCCI is yet to finalise the number of ODIs to be played during Sri Lankas tour of India later this year, Nair said. His statement contradicts Tryphon Mirando, secretary of SLCs interim committee, who said Monday that seven ODIs will be played. 

The South African team is expected to arrive in India in November for playing five ODIs. Sri Lankas request for seven ODIs would be considered only if the South African team is unable to make it here due to other commitments. Otherwise, the series would be limited to five ODIs and three Test matches, Nair said.

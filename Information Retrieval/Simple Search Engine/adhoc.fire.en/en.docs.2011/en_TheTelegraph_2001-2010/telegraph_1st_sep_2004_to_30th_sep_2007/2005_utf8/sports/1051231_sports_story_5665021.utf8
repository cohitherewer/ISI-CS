 Liverpool seize challengers baton

 - In Benitez, the Reds possess a Spaniard who is becoming a match for Mourinho

 Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard celebrates his goal against Everton on Wednesday 

With Chelsea almost out of sight at the half-way stage of a title procession, Liverpool are emerging as the team most capable of capitalising on any unlikely slip-up by Jose Mourinhos all-powerful squad. 

The task of chasing down the leaders looked like being solely Manchester Uniteds after Sir Alex Fergusons men inflicted the only Premiership defeat of the season on the defending champions last month. 

Costly failures to beat struggling Everton and Birmingham, however, have seen the challengers baton passed from Old Trafford to Anfield as Rafael Benitezs team built up a remarkable head of steam after an unconvincing start to the domestic campaign. 

A comfortable Merseyside derby victory on Wednesday night was Liverpools ninth successive League win, and until James Beattie headed past Jose Reina for what proved an Everton consolation goal they had achieved them all without any breach to their impressive defence. 

Suggestions that a trip to Japan for the Club World Championship this month would knock Liverpool out of their swaggering stride have proved misplaced and they have laid down a marker that they are a match for anybody ? at home or abroad. 

Benitez believes his team will get better. He has frequently stated that his squad is stronger than the one he led to such a startling Champions League triumph last May and he is free, within reason, to make additions during the transfer window. 

Winning the European Cup for a sixth time is a more realistic option for Liverpool than extending their domestic record of League titles to 19. The last came as far back as 1990 and it would be a brave man who forecasted that the wait will end in 2006, as they trail Chelsea by 15 points, though with two games in hand. 

Nor are they ever likely to compete financially with Chelsea who, through Roman Abramovichs backing, could go out and buy another full team if they felt the need. But, in Benitez, Liverpool possess a Spaniard who is becoming a match for the Portuguese Special One. 

The man who enabled Valencia to break the dominance enjoyed in Spain by Real Madrid and Barcelona has demonstrated that his charming persona hides a ruthless streak and, given another season or two, he may yet figure out a way to interrupt an era of Chelsea dominance. 

The same cannot be said of Ferguson. The United manager enjoyed a period of supremacy in the Nineties that even Mourinho will do well to emulate, but he has been treading water for the last three seasons, domestically and in Europe.

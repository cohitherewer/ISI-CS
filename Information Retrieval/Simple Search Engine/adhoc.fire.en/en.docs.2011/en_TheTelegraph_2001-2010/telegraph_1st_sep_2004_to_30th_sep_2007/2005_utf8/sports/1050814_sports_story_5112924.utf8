 Afridi eager to host Nehra, Harbhajan

Karachi: Tight security denied the Indian cricketers a chance to look around Pakistan during last years tour. Now, Ashish Nehra and Harbhajan Singh want to make up. 

The two, having landed in Lahore on Thursday, made trips to the Lahore Fort, Badshahi Mosque, Anarkali Bazar and Food Street, besides visiting friends. 

They also plan to visit Karachi, where a high-profile host is waiting for their arrival. 

Ashish and Harbhajan called me from Lahore and indicated they would be coming to Karachi. It would be a privilege to host them, the flamboyant allrounder said. 

This once again proves that off the field, we are good friends and enjoy each others company, said Afridi.

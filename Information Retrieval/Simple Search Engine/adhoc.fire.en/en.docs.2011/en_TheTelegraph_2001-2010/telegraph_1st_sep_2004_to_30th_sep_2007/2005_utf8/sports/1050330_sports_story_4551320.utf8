 Suspended officials defy government 

 Suspended president Thilanga Sumathipala has ordered closure of SLC?s Colombo headquarters 

Colombo: Sri Lanka?s cricket administration crisis has escalated with suspended officials challenging the sports minister?s authority to launch a government takeover on grounds of financial mismanagement. 

Suspended board president Thilanga Sumathipala ordered the closure of the organisation?s Colombo headquarters on Monday morning and sent all employees home as he started a legal tussle with sports minister Jeevan Kumaratunga. 

Chief executive Duleep Mendis was instructed to stop all correspondence on behalf of Sri Lanka Cricket and extra security guards have been employed to prevent any of the government?s six-man interim committee from entering the premises. The suspended committee also issued a statement clarifying its position and arguing that attempts were being made to ?illegally? take over the headquarters. 

?We wish to draw everyone?s attention to the fact that under the law neither the minister nor the secretary to the ministry nor any member of an interim committee is empowered to enter into or take over any immovable property belonging to Sri Lanka Cricket,? said the statement. 

?Sri Lanka Cricket also wishes to keep all persons informed that the interim committee appointed by the minister is a separate and distinct entity from Sri Lanka Cricket and has no legal authority whatsoever to act in the name of or on behalf of Sri Lanka Cricket,? it added. 

Damien Fernando, a member of the six-man interim committee was denied access to the board headquarters ? an act that drew sharp criticism from the sports minister.

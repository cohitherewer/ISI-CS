Moscow: Frances third seed Mary Pierce beat Italian Francesca Schiavone 6-4, 6-3 on Sunday to win her second Kremlin Cup title. 

It was also the second title this year for the 30-year old Frenchwoman after winning in San Diego in August. 

In the mens final, seventh seed and home favourite Igor Andreev overcame knee and back injuries to beat sixth-seeded German Nikolas Kiefer 5-7, 7-6, 6-2 for his maiden crown in Moscow. 

Sundays victory propelled Pierce to number four in the WTA Championship Race standings, ahead of compatriot Amelie Mauresmo and Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne and guaranteed her a place in the season-ending tournament in Los Angeles. 

She came to Moscow as a replacement for injured Wimbledon champion Venus Williams and had some tough matches on her way to the final. 

Andreev, playing with a bandaged knee, took a time-out after losing his serve in the second game of the second set.

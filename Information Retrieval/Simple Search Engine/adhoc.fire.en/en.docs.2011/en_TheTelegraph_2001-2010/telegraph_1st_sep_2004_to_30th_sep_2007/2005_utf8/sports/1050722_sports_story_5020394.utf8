 US scoop two golds

Montreal: Diver Laura Ann Wilkinson and long-distance swimmer Chip Peterson clai-med gold medals on Wednesday as the United States finally surfaced at the World aquatic championships. 

As the championships entered the fourth day, it looked as if the Americans might have to wait until Michael Phelps and the all-conquering swim team arrived for the start of their events this weekend before the Star Spangled Banner would be heard. 

However, 17-year-old Peterson got the party started early with a victory in the 10km open water event and Wilkinson followed up in the 10-m platform moving the US to the top of the medal table with two gold, three silver and a bronze. Its always exciting to put your country up there and have people take notice but especially for our team, Wilkinson said.

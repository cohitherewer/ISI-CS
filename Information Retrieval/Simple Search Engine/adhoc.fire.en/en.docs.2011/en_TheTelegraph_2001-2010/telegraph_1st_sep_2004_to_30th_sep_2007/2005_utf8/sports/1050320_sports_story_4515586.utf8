The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mumbai-Punjab tie evenly poised

 - ranji trophy semis 

 Gagandeep took 4 more for Punjab 

Mumbai: The Ranji Trophy elite division semi-final between holders Mumbai and Punjab was evenly poised after the second day?s play at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday. 

The hosts dismissed Punjab for a paltry 126 in response to Mumbai?s first innings score of 251. 

But the visitors, who conceded a lead of 125, then hit back strongly to reduce Mumbai to 112 for eight at stumps. 

Mumbai, in fact, were tottering at 82 for eight with just over 10 overs remaining for stumps. But left-hander Nishit Shetty (unbeaten 33) and tailender Nilesh Kulkarni (7 not out) combined for a ninth wicket partnership of 30 runs ? Mumbai?s best in the second essay ? to be 237 in front with two wickets in hand. 

With 16 wickets falling Saturday and 12 on Friday, Sunday might well bring an end to the match in which most wickets have fallen to poor shot selection rather than that of the pitch. 

Earlier, Punjab, resuming at overnight 42 for two, were all out under 62 overs. 

Eight out of 10 Punjab wickets fell to the Mumbai spin trio of captain Sairaj Bahutule, Kulkarni and Ramesh Powar. 

In the hosts? second innings, mediumpacer Gagandeep Singh once again did the bulk of damage taking four wickets to add to his four for 67 in the first innings. He was well supported by off-spinner Rajesh Sharma, who took three wickets in nine balls. 

In the morning, Punjab were put on the back foot soon after play started when Ravneet Ricky was run out following a misunderstanding with skipper Dinesh Mongia after the addition of 12 runs to the total. 

Mongia (23) also followed suit, bowled by Ajit Agarkar leave Punjab at 66 for four. 

Pankaj Dharmani, who top scored with 32, and Reetinder Singh Sodhi, who batted at number six after suffering a shoulder injury last evening while fielding, took the score to 106 before the last six wickets fell for 59 runs in 29 overs. 

Brief scores: Mumbai 251. Punjab 126 (Pankaj Dharmani 32, Dinesh Mongia 23; Nilesh Kulkarni 3/18, Sairaj Bahutule 4/20). Mumbai 112/8 (Nishit Shetty 33 n.o.; Gagandeep Singh 4/38, Rajesh Sharma 3/29)

 Kimi hopes suffer a blow

Magny-Cours: Kimi Raikkonens hopes of winning the French Grand Prix receded significantly on Friday after the McLaren title contender suffered a blown engine in practice. 

The Finn, second in the Formula One championship to Renaults Fernando Alonso, pulled over after just four minutes of the afternoon session as smoke billowed out from the Mercedes engine. The failure looked sure to cost Raikkonen 10 places on the starting grid and left him with a tough task in Sundays race. 

Spanish test driver Pedro de la Rosa, who will not race on Sunday, showed McLarens pace with the fastest times in both sessions while Raikkonens Colombian teammate Juan Pablo Montoya was second in the afternoon. 

Ferraris Michael Schumacher, hoping to become the first driver to win the same Grand Prix eight times on Sunday, was third fastest after being only 11th in the morning. 

Jordans Narain Karthikeyan finished 19th in second practice while teammate Tiago Monteiro, third in Indianapolis, came down to earth with a bang after flying high over a kerb and damaging his cars rear suspension in the first practice. He lapped slowest in the second. 

Fridays first practice, with De la Rosa lapping well inside the race lap record, set the scene for a battle between Renault and McLaren but champions Ferrari and BAR were also in the picture. 

Alonso was second quickest at a home track for both Renault and tyre partners Michelin. De la Rosas morning time was 1:14.778, with his afternoon best 1:14.460 on a changeable day. Alonsos best was 1:15.183. (Reuters)

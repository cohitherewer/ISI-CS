 Inzamam plans date with Shoaib

Islamabad: In an apparent attempt to bury the hatchet with Shoaib Akhtar, Pakistan Captain Inzamam-ul Haq plans to have a long chat with the fast bowler in South Africa where the two would turn out for Asian XI in the inaugural Afro-Asian Cup. 

Yes, I am going to sit down and discuss things with Shoaib. I want to tell him what plans we have in mind for him, what are we expecting from him as our main strike bowler in the coming season, Inzamam said. 

I would also like to hear from him about his fitness and form and how motivated he is for the coming series, said Inzamam whose strained relations with the Rawalpindi Express is not unknown. 

Inzamam, a veteran of 101 Tests and who would lead the Asian XI in the three-match series, also made it clear he had no personal problems with Shoaib. 

There is no personal grudge between us. I just want him to perform as a frontline bowler for the team. We have no doubt in our mind that when he puts his mind to it he is a match-winner for us, he was quoted as saying by a Pakistan daily. 

Inzamam said he would also talk to the other Pakistani players, who are playing for the Asian XI, and tell them about what he was expecting of them. 

Meanwhile in Karachi, Inzamam praised Englands strong comeback in the Ashes. He also expected a tough series when England tour Pakistan later this year. 

He said on Saturday: They (England) are really playing well as a combined unit. We are closely watching each of their performances. 

England are due to tour Pakistan from October 26 to play three Tests and five ODIs.

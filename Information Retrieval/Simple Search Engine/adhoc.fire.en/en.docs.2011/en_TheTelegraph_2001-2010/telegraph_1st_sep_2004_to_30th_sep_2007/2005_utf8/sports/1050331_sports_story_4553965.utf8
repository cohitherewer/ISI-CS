 Montoya out of Bahrain GP

 Montoya to have further scans before San Marino 

London: McLaren?s Juan Pablo Montoya will miss Sunday?s Bahrain Grand Prix after sustaining a hairline crack in his shoulder while playing tennis last Saturday. 

?Team McLaren Mercedes confirm that Juan Pablo Montoya is unable to take part in the 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix this coming weekend as a result of the injury he sustained while playing tennis during the Easter weekend,? a statement from the team said Wednesday. 

?Further scans will take place in two weeks time to verify the healing process but at this stage the team fully expects Juan Pablo to be able to compete in the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola on April 24.? 

The Colombian?s place will be taken by Spanish reserve driver Pedro de la Rosa. 

Montoya finished fourth in the Malaysian Grand Prix ten days ago and is tied for third in the season?s standings with eight points. At least it?s early in the season and a lot can happen so I don?t think my championship challenge is over,? he said. 

Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher hopes Ferrari?s new Formula One car can put him back on the winning track and end Renault?s run of success in Bahrain this weekend. 

?The two screwed up races at the beginning of the season are just more of a motivation for us,? the seven-time world champion told his personal website. ?Everyone is ready to go. We will work on taking back the lead step by step, don?t worry.? 

Spaniard Fernando Alonso leads the championship with 16 points. (Reuters)

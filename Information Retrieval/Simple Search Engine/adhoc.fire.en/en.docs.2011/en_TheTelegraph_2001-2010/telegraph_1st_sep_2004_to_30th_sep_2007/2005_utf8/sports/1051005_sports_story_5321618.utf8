 IN THE CITY

 For Mohun Bagan player Sanjay Parte, on-field booking might be a regular affair, but on Tuesday morning he experienced a different sort of booking on the city roads.

 Parte, on his way to practice at the Salt Lake Stadium, was booked by the Calcutta Traffic Police at the AJC Bose Road and Elliot Road crossing, for entering a no-entry zone around 9.00 am. The zone was prohibited as the chief minister?s convoy was scheduled to pass the area. Parte, new to the city, was unaware of the rules and barged into the no-entry zone.

 He was booked under section 115/194 of the Motor Vehicles Act. However, club officials claimed the player was physically assaulted by a traffic sergeant. But police denied the allegations. One of the club officials said: ?We are inquiring about the matter because this is a very serious offence by the traffic police. If someone violates traffic laws you can fine him but in no condition can you assault him.?

 Don Bosco (Liluah) defeated St Xaviers (Panihati) 7-6 in the semi-finals of the sub-junior section of the IFA Premier School meet at the St Lawrence High School ground on Tuesday. In the semi-finals of the junior section, St Xavier?s (Panihati) beat St James? High School 1-0. In the seniors, Don Bosco (Liluah) registered a 3-1 win over Ballygunge Govt School to enter the final.

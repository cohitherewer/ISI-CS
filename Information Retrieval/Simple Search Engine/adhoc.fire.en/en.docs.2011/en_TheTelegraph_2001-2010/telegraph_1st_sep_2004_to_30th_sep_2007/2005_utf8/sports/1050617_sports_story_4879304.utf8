 Ferrari ready to write off season

 - Schumacher amp; Co. read too much into 2004 show 

Kevin Garside in Indianapolis

 Schumacher has struggled badly this year 

Ferrari, Formula Ones all-conquering constructors for a record six successive years, are ready to write off this season after only eight races. Though Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello finished on the podium in Sundays Canadian Grand Prix ? Ferraris best result of 2005 ? neither was on the top step. 

The chance of either reclaiming the high ground at the United States Grand Prix in Indianapolis on Sunday is largely conditional on the performance of others. The points Ferrari inherited in Canada were destined for Fernando Alonso, Jenson Button and Juan Pablo Montoya until all three made uncharacteristic errors. Scraps that fall from the table of Renault, McLaren and BAR are not enough to sustain F1s most illustrious marque. 

We have to balance what we can achieve this year and what resources we can devote to next. Clearly we are not competitive enough, Ross Brawn, Ferraris technical director, said. If we pour all our efforts into this years car and sacrifice next years, Im not sure that will be the right choice. 

Hubris may be too strong a word, but there is no doubt that Ferrari read too much into their omnipotence of 2004, when they won all but three of the 18 races, and too little into the impact of the radical rule changes that have emasculated performance, particularly the effect of using only one tyre for qualifying and the race. 

The decision to delay the introduction of the new car this year, believing they had enough in hand to manage the opening phase of the season, proved ruinous. Renault and McLaren were ready to go at the first race in Australia but by the time the penny dropped it was too late. 

Ferrari brought forward the introduction of the 2005 car from the fifth race in Barcelona to the third in Bahrain to no avail. Schumacher retired on lap 12 and Barrichello ambled round on shredded tyres and was lapped in the process. Ferrari have recovered since to develop a race pace that is as quick as any, but they have yet to find a tyre that works in qualifying as well as the race. 

Schumacher qualified second in Canada because he had less fuel on board. Had he carried the same quantity as the Renaults and McLarens, he would have qualified a second behind both. At the more extreme end of paddock opinion, Ralf Schumacher believes the end is nigh for Ferrari and his brother. 

Not only is Ferraris position irretrievable this year, he claims, but the team are in terminal decline and his brother will not extend a contract that ends in 2006. 

While for the most part that is wishful thinking on the part of the lesser Schumacher, the argument will begin to gain weight this time next year if Ferrari find themselves in the same position. 

Jenson Button, meanwhile, who was ordered to party away the disappointment of Canada, where he crashed into a wall, took his BAR superiors at their word. Button has spent two days at Hugh Hefners Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles as a guest of an American television network conducting its pre-race coverage.

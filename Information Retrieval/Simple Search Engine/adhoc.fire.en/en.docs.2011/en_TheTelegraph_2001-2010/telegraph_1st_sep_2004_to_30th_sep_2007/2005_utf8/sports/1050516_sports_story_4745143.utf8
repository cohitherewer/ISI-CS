 England recall Bell

London: England called up middle-order batsman Ian Bell to their 12-man squad for this months first Test against Bangladesh as Kevin Pietersen missed out. 

Bell, 23, has played one previous Test, scoring 70 in his one innings against the West Indies in August last year. 

The Warwickshire right-hander averages 80 on the county circuit this year while most of Englands other leading batsmen have been struggling for form. Bowling includes Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, uncapped seamer Jon Lewis and Ashley Giles.

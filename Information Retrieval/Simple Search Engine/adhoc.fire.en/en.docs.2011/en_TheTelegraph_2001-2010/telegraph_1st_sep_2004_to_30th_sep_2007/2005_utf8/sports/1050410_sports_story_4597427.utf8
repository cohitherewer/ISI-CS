The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Teams? travel plans changed

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Learning a lesson from the stone-throwing incident when the Indian and Pakistani teams drove here from Ranchi, on Wednesday, the powers-that-be have changed Sunday afternoon?s departure plans. 

So, as was indicated by The Telegraph on Friday, the teams will now fly to Ranchi and, then, take a regular flight for Mumbai from there. The Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector is going to be covered on Monday morning. 

This was confirmed by the Indian manager for the series, Wing Commander M. Baladitya, who happens to be the Services Sports Control Board secretary. 

Captain Sourav Ganguly, of course, left for Calcutta late on Saturday evening (aboard a private flight) and will join his team in Mumbai.

 Leko pips Anand to title

 Anand drew with Sokolov in the final round to settle for second place 

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Hungarian Grandmaster Peter Leko drew his final round game against compatriot Judit Polgar to claim his maiden Corus super-Grandmaster chess title as defending champion Viswanathan Anand settled for the second spot here on Sunday. 

Leko finished with 8.5 points, half a point ahead of Anand. 

Four wins and nine draws gave the Hungarian the coveted title and a grand start in the new year. His crucial win against Anand with black pieces in the second round proved to be decisive in the end as the Indian was unable to catch up until the last round. 

Leko?s other wins came against Nigel Short, Bruzon and Peter Svidler. He also finished as the only undefeated player in the tournament. 

At the start of the final round, Leko needed just a draw and he got just that playing against Polgar in 22 moves. 

On the adjacent board, Anand playing behind black pieces, was giving it all against tailender Ivan Sokolov. 

Early in the Slav game, Anand gained a pawn and had a backward bishop to boot to. Trying to eke out a win in the queen, rook and bishop ending, Anand was in a spot of bother briefly as the white queen and rook invaded his backline. Sensing great danger, Anand went for a draw. 

World No. 2 and four-time Corus champion, Anand started the tournament as favourite, but his early defeat to Leko put the brakes on his progress. 

A hattrick of wins in the middle, against Morozevich, Ponomariov and Bruzon, brought him back into contention, but a draw against local star Loek Van Wely from a winning position spoilt Anand?s party. 

With the title race becoming a match up between Leko and Anand, a majority of the final round games ? Svidler-Topalov, Adams-Grischuk, Kramnik-Morozevich ? ended in quick draws. (PTI)

 London: British sprinter Dwain Chambers has admitted taking THG 18 months before testing positive for the designer steroid.

 Chambers was banned for two years in November 2003 after a positive test. He was also stripped of the silver medal he had won as a member of the British 4x100m relay team at the Paris World Championships the same year.

 Chambers said he had started taking THG in 2002, the year he won the European 100m title, supplied by Balco laboratory head Victor Conte.

 ?I took THG but I didn?t know what its gain and its benefits were,? he said. ?THG came in liquid form and you put a few drops under your tongue three to four times a week. I was a bit suspicious? but Victor explained it was a new product on the market that would aid me nutritionally, so I went forward with it.?

 Chambers, 27, will be eligible to compete in next year?s European championships in Gothenburg if he passes three dope tests in the meantime.

 Dubai: Team India finished 14th in an eventful feature race in the Dubai leg of the A-1 Grand Prix on Sunday. Armaan Ebrahim did well to finish a race that saw as many as 10 cars fail to do so. Ebrahim clocked 57:06.512 seconds, while France?s Nicolas Lapierre won the race in 56:17.068. France are in overall lead with 106 points, while Switzerland (75) and Brazil (60) are in second and third, respectively.

 Earlier, in the 15-lap sprint race, Ebrahim finished 20th in 27:41.498, while Switzerland?s Neel Jani was the fastest followed by Italy?s Enrico Toccacelo and Tomas Enge of Czech Republic. 

 Miami: Shaquille O?Neal, the Miami Heat centre regarded as one of the world?s best players, was sworn in on Thursday as a reserve police officer with the Miami Beach Police Department.

 O?Neal, who has long been interested in a crime-fighting career and wants to become a police chief someday, has a uniform, badge, gun and the power to make arrests. He worked as a reserve officer in Los Angeles during his years with the Lakers and has been training in Miami Beach since his trade to the Heat in July 2004.

 Melbourne: Robert Allenby became the first player to win the ?triple crown? of Australian golf in the same season, when he beat Bubba Watson of the US in a play-off at the Australian Masters on Sunday.

 Australia?s Allenby, who won the Australian Open at Moonah Links two weeks ago and PGA last week at Coolum in Queensland, beat the American on the first play-off hole after the pair had tied for 17-under-par 271.

 Malelane: Ernie Els cast aside any lingering doubts about his fitness with his victory by three strokes in the Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek Country Club on Sunday. In what developed into a straight shootout with overnight leader Ulrich van den Berg, Els shot a four-under-par 68 to overtake his fellow South African on the back nine.

 London: Britain?s Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan stormed to another impressive victory when he stopped countryman Daniel Thorpe three seconds from the end of the second round of their bout on Sunday.

 Referee Richie Davis stepped in to spare Thorpe further punishment through a ferocious assault by Khan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians lost plot after 20-odd overs

 - I was surprised to be named Man-of-the-Series 

 THE BOND COLUMN 

When we walked to the park on the morning of the tri-series final, we felt the Indians would prefer chasing. On our part, we initially wanted to bowl first. 

But when Stephen Fleming had a look at the pitch, he felt it was dry and it would not have been a bad idea to bat first since it could only get worse during the day. 

So India probably did the right thing and after a good start, they should have got to 320. But they lost the plot, our batters got on top of their bowlers and with those missed catches, there was only one way this final was going to end. 

If I have to choose where India missed the trick, it was their batting where they could not kick on from 150 for one in 20-odd overs. 

It was one of those sub-continent type of wicket where there was little bounce, little pace and little by way of movement to the fast bowlers. It was the same for us as it was for Indian seamers. 

I was disappointed with my first spell only to the extent that I lapsed a couple of times in concentration and gave Virender Sehwag that width which he latched on to for off-side boundaries.. 

But overall, I was pleased with my first spell as I gave little by way of runs and could have had Sourav Ganguly more than once. 

Sehwag was a sight to behold. I remember Jacob Oram telling me that he felt he was bowling on to the stumps but Sehwag was still backing away and creating room to cream boundaries on the off-side. 

His dismissal had a withering effect and before everyone goes up in arms and terms it a soft dismissal, I feel he is not the sort of player who deserves such an analysis. 

He is a dangerous player whose all-out methods could look good or bad depending on the way it ends up. With him, you have to take good with the bad. 

Once Sehwag went, we clawed our way back. Daniel Vettori was always going to be a very handy bloke on that sort of a wicket. He cost us only 35 runs which was worth its weight in gold. Kyle Mills also earned our praise for the manner in which he recovered from a poor start and chipped in with wickets. 

Frankly, I was surprised to be named Man-of-the-Series for I wasnt expecting it. I did go past the bat often on the day and could have had more than one wicket. 

I did not finish my spell because while bowling that delivery to Irfan Pathan, I lost my feet. As I rolled, I felt my ankle and knee. Instead of risking my knee which is still tender, I decided to leave the field and tend it with an ice pack.

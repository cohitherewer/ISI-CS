Bridgetown: Captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul closed in on his 14th Test century on Saturday to give the West Indies a massive lead on the Day III of the first Test against Pakistan at the Kensington Oval. 

The 30-year-old Chanderpaul compiled a fluent unbeaten 93 that lifted the home team from 168 for four overnight to 271 for five at lunch. 

The West Indies, who earned a first-innings lead of 201, now have an overall advantage of 472 with two days and two sessions remaining. 

Chanderpaul shared an important fifth-wicket stand of 134 with Wavell Hinds, who contributed 52 before being dismissed in the last over before the interval. 

The pair of left-handers spent the first hour consolidating the teams position and added just 34 in 16 overs. But they gradually began to dominate and piled on 69 runs in the next 13 overs to shatter Pakistani spirits. 

Danish Kaneria should have removed Hinds before the onslaught but floored a firm straight drive the over after the drinks interval. Hinds, then on 21, soon emerged from his defensive shell to bring up a half-century off 121 balls. 

But Kaneria eventually gained his reward when Hinds was bowled as he came down the pitch and tried to hit a leg-break over the top. He struck six fours in two hours, 40 minutes. 

Chanderpauls exhibition followed a score of 92 in the first innings. In his fifth Test as skipper, he hit five fours and a six off 175 balls in just under four hours. Kaneria was expensive but earned two for 97 off 19.1 overs. (AP)

 Chelsea enjoying good luck, feels Wenger 

MATT HUGHES

 Wenger is yet to digest Drogbas goal against Arsenal 

Chelsea are already in possession of the best players, the biggest squad and deepest pockets in the Barclays Premiership and Arsene Wenger feels that they also have all the luck. 

In a mischievous attempt to put some pressure on Jose Mourinho, the Arsenal manager said Friday that Chelsea have enjoyed a lucky start to the season, pointing to Didier Drogbas miscontrolled winner against his own side at Stamford Bridge to support his case. 

Perhaps indulging in a spot of wishful thinking, given Chelsea are unbeaten in 35 Barclays Premiership games, Wenger went on to predict the champions imminent fall, although the Frenchman does have personal experience of unforeseen implosions. 

Those with long memories will recall that at this time last year Arsenal were being hailed as the Invincibles before defeat away to Manchester United led to a poor spell that effectively ended their championship challenge, while three years ago they began their title defence with a nine-match unbeaten run before losing four games in a row. 

Chelsea have not looked like losing a match so far this season, but Wenger believes they could suffer a similar fate. I think Chelsea have had a bit of a lucky start, Wenger said. They won at Wigan in the last minute, and then they beat us with a miscontrolled ball. 

Football is not as predictable as it looks. Because when you are on a roll it just goes on. Even when you are not playing well you win games. But it can change. Football is not as straightforward as it looks. Suddenly you lose a game that you dont deserve to and it happens. 

If Chelsea have been lucky on the pitch then their good fortune off it borders on the outrageous, with Roman Abramovichs millions ensuring Mourinho can sign any player who takes his fancy. 

Wenger enjoys no such luxuries and after losing Patrick Vieira this summer is even struggling to keep his existing squad together. 

Arsenal are in negotiations with the France striker over a new deal but are aware that under new Fifa regulations Henry could buy himself out of the final year of his contract next summer. 

I cannot say that for certain that he will stay because under the new Fifa rules a player can move without the permission of any club, Wenger said. But our desire to keep Thierry here is 100 per cent strong. I think he wants to stay but I know thats only me saying it. THE TIMES, LONDON

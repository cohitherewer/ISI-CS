The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Both parties (Sourav, Chappell) at war should have gone

 - A good captain is one who is a good man manager: Greig 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Tony Greig

Sydney: Tony Greig is in his 60th year, but hasnt lost any of his zest for life. A former England captain and, in recent years, a much-in-demand TV commentator, the one-time allrounder spoke to The Telegraph on the captaincy developments back in India. Easily among the most popular cricketers to have toured India, Greig has been keeping track of the happenings in Bangalore and in Calcutta. Mohali, too. 

The following are excerpts 

On whether captains have a shelf life 

Absolutely... No captain has been captain for life... It has always been a matter of time... Talking of myself, I never forgot what my father told me when I became the England captain ? Before you get too excited, just look at what happened before your time... And, on a close study, I realised most predecessors had to go before they were ready to leave! So, I took the job with that at the back of my mind. (After a pause) In a funny sort of way, when I joined Packers World Series Cricket, it was me doing something before they (the selectors) doing something to me. 

On Sourav Gangulys removal as captain 

Everybody must appreciate the resilience it takes to be an Indian captain for any length of time... Sourav, I understand, was captain for over five years... Because of the fanaticism in India, you could do a reasonably good job but, because of one defeat, still lose the captaincy... Thats unfair, yet is always a possibility (in India)... It appears Souravs row with coach Greg Chappell influenced the selectors and, therefore, both the parties at war should have gone. Ironically, Sourav played some role ? albeit behind the scenes ? in getting Greg on board. 

On the captain-coach relationship 

Its of huge importance and, if Rahul Dravid keeps the job long term, then he has the right to work with a coach hes comfortable with. There have been instances when coaches, not players, have been beneficiaries of continuity. In my view, thats not correct. Im not in favour of continuity of tenure for only one powerful position. That can encourage off-the-field power play and politics. 

On Sourav and Chappell having a tussle over who will be the boss 

The captain has to be the boss ? why this debate? The coach is part of the support staff and is around to back the captain. The coach is certainly the most important there but, then, he remains on the support staff. We must not confuse cricket with soccer. 

On his assessment of Sourav as captain 

Im not a big one for rating people... However, Souravs captaincy did impress me, not least because of the pressure he had to take. India needed somebody like him and, frankly, he wouldnt have been around for so long if he was touchy. That he is the most successful Indian Test captain cant be taken away from him. 

On whether Sourav has it in him to make a comeback purely as a batsman 

First, he has to ask himself whether he wants to... I dont rule out anything, but you dont get better with age... Once in the 30s, it becomes difficult... 

On his message for Sourav 

Get fit, work hard at nets to iron out some of the problems... As Ive said, he has to first ask himself whether he wants to continue playing. 

On Dravid getting to captain in 12 ODIs on the trot 

What worries me is that one-day matches may go either way and it wont be fair to judge him on the basis of ODIs alone... I know hes an intense guy and has his priorities in place, but... 

On whether Dravids batting could suffer 

Thats a different issue. Fact is some handle captaincy situations better than others... I cant say... If his batting suffers, Dravid is himself going to be the one to give it away. 

On whether he modelled his own captaincy on somebody 

Well, I looked up to Ray Illingworth... The earliest captain does make an impression. 

On the essentials for captaincy 

Let me answer your question this way: A good captain is one who is a good man manager? Obviously, he has to be an automatic selection and, then, have the qualities to manage not just the senior players but the coach as well. 

Finally, whether theres currently a stand-out captain 

No ones great... Stephen Fleming isnt much different from a Michael Vaughan and Vaughan isnt much different from a Ricky Ponting... I wouldnt like to place anybody on a special pedestal.

Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami, after years in the country?s premier league, have failed to smarten up. The outfit has retained, so to say, its dehati outlook, and relies heavily on ancient logic that falls far short of whatever moderate cerebral levels today?s soccer can reach. 

In their National League match for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium they were ahead of fifth-placed (up at fourth, after the match) Mahindra United in the ninth minute. They attacked a bit thereafter, but soon after thought it was better to start defending. A cardinal error, no doubt, but the way they went about it lacked strategic thoughts even at the basic intelligence level. 

If wasting time was the best way to ward off trouble, the babus at Writers? Buildings would have led spiritually enlightened lives. It doesn?t happen that way in the real world, and Mahindra United expectedly, hit back in the 74th minute (1-1), keeping Tollygunge hanging, still, in relegation zone ? 17 points from 20 matches, Mohun Bagan preceding with 18 points from 19 matches. 

Soccer was at its basic, hence not worth wasting newsprint over. Mahindra, with a rather decent complement of national players managed only long pot shots in the first half. Tollygunge after all the big talk against Suley Musah, took solace with him in the defence. Then he was up in a midriff position. Not that it made any big difference. 

But the attitude was strange. If the urgency was missing in Mahindra, Tollygunge faded after the initial flare. Akeem Abolanle loped up the left in the ninth minute and from near the top of the box squared to the goalmouth. Surajit Bose was at hand to put it in, the defence lazing in the heat. A Suman Dutta pass was messed up by Akeem later and N.S. Manju?s sudden shot from inside the box in the 71st minute was saved well by Tollygunge goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh. 

Much of second half play was in poor light, with the stadium lights not coming on till the 22nd minute of that session. Seven minutes after the lights came on, Manju made amends, tapping in the equaliser from close with ?keeper Ghosh out of charge and the defence in a pretty flummoxed state.

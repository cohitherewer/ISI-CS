Chennai: Carlos Moya showed what Grand Slam champions are all about on a pleasant Friday evening at the Nungambakkam Stadium. 

Up against a man he had lost to in the Davis Cup semi-final four months ago, the top seed took in his stride some patchy phases and lifted his game at the crunch to carve out a 6-4, 6-4 win against young Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu. 

As he said later, revenge was certainly on Moya?s mind. ?That loss in a home (Davis Cup) tie hurt a lot, it was a big mental blow and I had to take a break from the Tour to focus on training. So today?s result makes me feel very good,? Moya admitted. 

The defending champion?s semi-final opponent at the $400,000 Chennai Open will be fellow-Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. The tall 21-year-old made his second career semi-final at the expense of 2001 winner Michal Tabara. 

Moya, who drew the tournament?s biggest crowd on Day 5, was in a different zone after trading breaks with Mathieu in the opening two games. 

Solid as ever from the backcourt and wielding his forehand to good effect, the 1998 French Open champion made his opponent pay for inconsistency. 

Mathieu, rated very highly by many including Moya, had double the number of winners but a far greater percentage of unforced errors as well. The Frenchman did force three break-points in the second set but the big-serving Moya was up to the task. 

Earlier, the Paradorn Srichaphan-Chennai chemistry claimed one more victim. This time, Belgian Kristof Vliegen felt the heat as the second-seeded Thai breezed into the $400,000 Chennai Open semi-finals with a 6-3, 6-4 verdict. 

Czech Tomas Zib earned the right to challenge Srichaphan after scalping giant American Justin Gimelstob 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 

Srichaphan, who has now won 16 of his 18 matches at the Nungambakkam stadium, simply outclassed Vliegen in an hour and a quarter. Basically a hard-hitting baseliner, Srichaphan mixed it up nicely and looked sharp whenever he came up to the net. The influence of new coach T.J. Middleton was quite visible. 

Vliegen, who came back from the dead to oust sixth seed Yen-Hsun Lu on Thursday, was again a sitting duck in the initial stages. Srichpahan didn?t have to raise a sweat in going 3-0 up as the 22-year-old Vliegen missed the target left, right and centre. 

The Belgian did well to shrug off three break-points in the fourth game. Srichaphan found himself in a mess on his serve in the next game. A mishit, followed by a double fault, left him staring at a 0-40 situation. That crisis brought the best out of the Thai who came up with the big shots to win the next five points and the game. 

There were to be no more alarms and Srichaphan comfortably closed the first set out in 35 minutes. 

Vliegen repeated his first-set pattern, fumbling once too often to drop serve straightaway. He didn?t have the power to match Srichaphan?s forehand-reliant game and tried to be smart by playing the drop-shot. It worked twice, but that wasn?t enough to stretch the2003 champion. 

Another break was inevitable, and it came in game 5. Serving at 4-1, Srichaphan had no answer to a pair of quality service returns. Vliegen had pulled back one service-break, but that was as far as he could go. 

Srichaphan made sure he held serve thereafter and the match was his.

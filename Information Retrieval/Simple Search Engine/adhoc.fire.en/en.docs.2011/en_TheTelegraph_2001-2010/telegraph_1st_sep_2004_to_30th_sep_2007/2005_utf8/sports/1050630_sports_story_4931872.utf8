 McEnroe puts histrionics on ice

 MARTIN JOHNSON AT WIMBLEDON

 John McEnroe celebrates scoring a point during his 45 and over doubles match on Tuesday 

Time dims the memory, but the great players, and the great moments, live on. The crowds flocked to Court No. 2 Tuesday, hoping perhaps that John McEnroe might still be able to reproduce one of the most magical moments in tennis. It was at a Davis Cup final in Stockholm, when, armed only with a frail wooden racket and a single-handed backhand, McEnroe delivered such an awesome blow to the water jug on the change-over table that the ice cubes carried to the seat occupied by the King of Sweden. 

Sadly, at the age of 46, the powers that once prompted an umpire to say (or should have done): I think, Mr McEnroe, that its you who should be up here in a high chair, complete with bib and rattle.... have now deserted him. The people came to see him misbehave, but were forced instead to drift away thinking: What a nice old chap. And what good manners. 

The occasion was a first round over-45 gentlemans doubles match, and a gentleman he was. No sign of Wimbledon 1981, when he introduced pits of the world and you cannot be serious to a staid old game, and became the first champion to be denied honorary membership of the All England Club. 

McEnroe was Tuesday renewing a doubles pairing with Peter Fleming stretching back from 1977 to 1987 that had gleaned 347 victories and only 42 defeats. 

Tuesdays opponents were British, John Feaver, 53, and John Lloyd, whose right knee has had so much surgery that he could barely move. So victory for McEnroe and Fleming, 6-3, 6-4 in 54 minutes was not quite the upset of the tournament. 

McEnroe came on to court wearing a pair of Rafael Nadals pirate trousers, or possibly a pair of Fred Perrys old flannels that had been shrunk in the wash. 

What the crowd had really come to see, however, were some old fashioned histrionics, and the early signs looked promising. After two aces in his opening service game, McEnroe pointed to his shoulder muscles, and when he dunked an easy shot into the net, he threw down his racket. 

All we needed now was a dodgy line call. It came in his second service game, when what would otherwise have been another ace was called long. McEnroe advanced towards the net, glared menacingly at the line judge and then turned to the umpire. This had to be it. Breath was held, the linespersons began to tremble and the umpire reached for the tournament directors hotline number. But what happened? Back he trudged to the service line and got on with the game. No insults, no exploding water jug, nothing. You half expected the umpire to call out: Is that it? You cannot be serious. 

McEnroe was so off form in the explosion department that his partner was forced to lift the crowd himself, Fleming hurling down his racket when McEnroe punched a routine volley way over the baseline. Ive had to put up with this guy for 30 years! Fleming shouted, and once more Court No. 2 echoed with laughter.

 Shiv Kapur in sparkling form

Shenzen: Shiv Kapur returned two birdies on the last two holes to finish the first day with a sparkling three-under 69 at the $1.3 million Volvo China Open at the Shenzhen Golf Club on Thursday. 

Kapur, lying tied 11th, was the best among six Indians in the fray of the meet co-sanctioned by Asian and European Tours. 

Jyoti Randhawa, still waiting for his clubs, and playing with a new set, shot a 71 and is 32nd. 

Thailands Chawalit Plaphol is in a share of the lead with Francois Delamontagne of France after returning a sizzling seven-under-par 65. 

Two strokes behind are Boonchu Ruangkit of Thailand and Englands Barry Lane, who carded 67s. 

Gaurav Ghei, Amandeep Johl and Rahil Gangjee were at par 72, while Harmeet Kahlon had a disastrous 75.

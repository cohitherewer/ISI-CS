 Am working on my rhythm: Pathan

 - Indian speedster feels it was bad luck he could not perform well against Pakistan 

 Its just a matter of playing to potential, feels Pathan 

Vadodara: Irfan Pathan is concentrating on improving his rhythm through hard work-outs ahead of the season after his disappointing display against Pakistan at home. 

The Baroda left-arm pacer, who last year bagged the International Cricket Councils (ICC) Best Young Player of the Year award, saw his form plummet in the Test and one-day series against Pakistan. He says it is only a passing phase, which affects every player. 

?It was my bad luck that I could not perform well against Pakistan. But such bad phase comes in the life of every player. This, however, has not disappointed me and I am working hard to improve my performance,? Pathan said in an interview here on Friday. 

The Team India mediumpacer, who captured 18 wickets in three Tests against Bangladesh last December after taking three wickets in the Eden Gardens Test against South Africa, suffered a side strain and failed to recapture the same form against Pakistan. 

The highly-talented youngster managed a modest return of six wickets in the three-Test series against the arch-rivals. 

He also failed to take a wicket in 8.2 overs while conceding 67 runs in the only one-day International out of six that he played against Pakistan at the Keenan Stadium in Jamshedpur. 

?No one would have raised questions about my performance had I captured more wickets,? said Pathan. 

?I dont believe in giving reasons (for the below-par wicket haul). I dont believe in giving excuses and have already started to work even harder,? Pathan said. 

?I am concentrating on work-outs, training, on improving my rhythm and consistently keeping up my performance. 

?Its just a matter of doing the good things consistently before matches and playing to my potential,? the youngster said at his residence in Tandalja here. 

Pathan, however, denied the allegations that he had returned to big time cricket before his injury had healed completely. 

?I came back to the team only after I was declared fit by the Indian teams trainer, physiotherapist and the cricket board-appointed doctor,? he said. 

On the absence of the delivery which he swung into the right-handers late from outside off ? his forte prior to the injury ? Pathan expressed confidence that he will recapture the art. 

?I bowl at 138-140 kmph. Rhythm is my strength and I am confident that I will be able to bowl the ball that comes in,? the 21-year-old said. 

Pathan, who captured the nations attention on his maiden tour of Australia and then played a major part in the historic 2-1 Test series win over Pakistan in Pakistan, refused to be drawn into a discussion about the need for a separate bowling coach. 

?I cannot speak on the subject. Its for the board to decide. Its the supreme body and whatever decision it takes is acceptable to us players,? he said, when reminded of the role played by former Australian left arm pacer Bruce Reid when India toured Australia in 2003-04. 

On how he was planning to prepare for the new season, Pathan said: ?I may go to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai (where he had trained before under Dennis Lillee). I will decide soon,? he said. 

On his potential to become an allrounder, Pathan said versatility is the key. 

?I am definitely polishing my batting. I feel that batting performance is linked to your bowling and if you bowl well, you will also bat well,? he said. 

?Its my desire to emerge as an allrounder and I am trying hard to fulfil that,? he said. 

The Baroda pacer denied the argument that commercial activities such as endorsing products of various companies interfered with his cricket. ?It has no bearing on my performance,? he said.

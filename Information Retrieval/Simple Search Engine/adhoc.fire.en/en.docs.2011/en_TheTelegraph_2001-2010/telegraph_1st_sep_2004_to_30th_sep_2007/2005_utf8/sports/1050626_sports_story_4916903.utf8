Tottenham get their way

Russell Kempson 

 The Frank Arnesen saga is finally over

Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea on Friday night came 

to an agreement over compensation for the move of Frank Arnesen, the sporting 

director at White Hart Lane, to Stamford Bridge, bringing to an end a protracted 

saga. Tottenham claimed to have accepted a figure of ?10 million ? the sum they 

had originally demanded for the loss of the Dane ? but Chelsea sources said that 

the true amount was closer to ?6 million.

The matter reached a head on Wednesday when photographs 

were published of Arnesen in the company of Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, 

on the Russian billionaires yacht, which was moored in Sardinia. Tottenham 

reacted angrily and gave Chelsea a deadline of noon on Friday to reach a settlement. 

If the matter had not been resolved, Tottenham would have reported Chelsea to 

the Premier League for an alleged illegal approach to Arnesen, who has been suspended 

since the controversy broke.

Abramovich, who rarely becomes involved in day-to-day 

issues, returned from Sardinia to play a key role in the negotiations. Tottenham 

were represented by Daniel Levy, their chairman, and John Alexander, the club 

secretary.

In an attempt to avoid another inquiry from the Premier 

League, which found Chelsea and Jose Mourinho, their manager, guilty in the Ashley 

Cole tapping-up scandal, Chelsea offered Glen Johnson and/or Robert 

Huth as part of the Arnesen compensation deal.

Tottenham declined, stating that it did not 

serve the best interests of the club. They had been interested in securing 

Mikael Forssell or Scott Parker ? plus a smaller payment for the loss of Arnesen 

? but Forssell joined Birmingham City and Parker moved to Newcastle United.

With no other alternatives in the Chelsea squad ? 

who Tottenham would want or Chelsea would allow to leave ? the discussions returned 

to a straight cash deal. It is also believed that Tottenham were insisting on 

a clause in any settlement that would prevent Chelsea from buying a player from 

them for two years. Jermain Defoe, their England forward, is much admired by Mourinho. 

Tottenham also suggested that Arnesen should be placed 

on gardening leave until September. A deal was finally struck long 

after the noon deadline Tottenham had imposed.

Juan Sebastian Veron has joined Inter Milan on a two-year 

loan. He spent last season with Inter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

Ill go for Federer, Sharapova 

Serve amp; Volley 

Naresh Kumar

One of the drawbacks to achieving greatness is that 

people expect you to be great all the time, every match, every game, every point. 

But Roger Federer is only human ? for his rivals its probably his most redeeming 

feature. Far from being below-par this year, I dont think he was very far 

away from having an even better start to the year than last year, which was an 

incredible 12 months for him. 

Dont forget he had match-point against Marat 

Safin in the semi-finals of the Australian Open and, with all due respect to Lleyton 

Hewitt, I think Federer would have beaten him had he reached the final. And in 

the French Open he did much better than last year by reaching the semi-finals 

and was a break-point up in the fourth set against the wonderful Rafael Nadal. 

Who knows what might have happened in that set but for the fading light? Again, 

had he reached the final, against Mariano Puerta, Im sure he would have 

won that, too.

I understand he is going to play a little more aggressively 

at Wimbledon which I think is a wise move: it will make life a little easier for 

himself. Had he done that against Nadal, and attacked the young Spaniards 

second serve, we would definitely have had a different outcome at Roland Garros. 

We would now be talking about how Federer was the master of all surfaces instead 

of his vulnerability on clay. I think an attacking game will suit him better at 

the US Open, too.

Im surprised, though, that he says he finds 

himself under less pressure than last year, when he had to defend his title. Having 

failed to win the Australian Open, as he did last year, he will know that his 

No. 1 ranking could be at risk if he fails to win Wimbledon. And winning three 

on the trot at anything isnt easy. 

Having said that, I think Federer will retain his 

title, even if he isnt playing at his best: he is that comfortable on grass. 

And just before I leave Federer could someone please tell me why I wasnt 

invited to wear 24-carat gold trainers when I was lording it at Wimbledon? If 

the makers are reading Ill be happy to wear them in the mens 45-and-over 

doubles.

Talking about comfort on grass, whats all this 

negative talk I hear from Tim Henman about struggling to transfer his improvements 

on other courts to grass? He knows grass-court tennis probably better than anyone 

playing today. I want to see him serve and volley on every first serve and occasionally 

on the second, just to keep his opponents guessing. 

Last year he didnt do that for some reason. 

In the early rounds he stayed back too much and when he played Mario Ancic in 

the quarter finals he was coming in behind almost every serve and was getting 

passed at will because the big Croatian likes a target. I still think the fact 

that he played that match only 30 to 36 hours after playing Mark Philippoussis 

was a factor. Physically, he hadnt recovered.

The height of an opponent is something that has to 

be taken into serious consideration in tennis. What I want Henman to do against 

guys like Ancic is on the second serve spin it more into his body. His kicker 

sits up too much for them and on grass you want something that shoots through 

a bit, like some bowlers get the ball to do in cricket. 

I played Goran Ivanisevic, a guy I think Henman knows 

quite well, on his home patch in Croatia last Thursday and if I had started playing 

kickers against him ? hes about 6ft 4in ? Id have been putting them 

straight into his wheelbarrow. Incidentally, the Croatian mob got to me ? Tim 

will understand ? and I lost 11-9 in a tiebreaker. Even a pair of Nadals 

pirate pants didnt help me.

Henman just has to believe that hes going to 

place his second serve well and throw good spins into them because hes got 

the serve to do that. I still give him a chance at this Wimbledon although its 

going to take an extraordinary set of circumstances for that to happen, like Andy 

Roddick losing to another Croatian Ivo Karlovic ? which would not be so extraordinary 

after their close-run thing at Queens last week ? and then for Karlovic 

to lose to someone else or maybe even Henman in the quarter-finals. 

But before that its not exactly going to be 

a walk in the park for the British No. 1. His first-round opponent, Jarkko Nieminen, 

is a guy who can play on all surfaces and if he beats him he could have Wayne 

Arthurs, who knows how to play on grass, waiting for him in the third round. And 

then Sebastien Grosjean, who has given him plenty of problems on grass in the 

past, is a likely opponent in the round of 16.

I can fully understand Henman wanting to try to take 

a little pressure off himself ? God knows he deserves to at Wimbledon ? but opponents 

can take a little heart from some of this kind of talk. Of course, if these reservations 

he has been expressing about the speed of the grass these days turn out to be 

a bluff, that would be really interesting. But if he means it and he is low on 

confidence it will be tough for him even to reach the quarters.

The third quarter of the draw is wide open and it 

contains Britains No. 2, Greg Rusedski. If there was ever a year for him 

to make serious progress in this tournament its this year because he could 

find himself up against guys who are even more hit-and-miss than he is: Joachim 

Johansson and Fernando Gonzalez. However, if Johansson is free of injury then 

the power of his serve could make him the dark horse. Very dark given his recent 

form on clay. 

Andrew Murray is the Briton I will be watching with 

particular interest ? as will, Im sure, Henman. I do feel Murrays 

performances at Queens might have been responsible indirectly for Henmans 

ultimate poor showing there. Henman had my sympathy. I could just imagine what 

he must have been going through when Murray began to get on top in his match against 

Thomas Johansson and a meeting against the up-and-comer was looming. That would 

have been a match in which Henman had nothing to win and everything to lose. He 

probably got himself a bit agitated over that, although when Murray started cramping 

he must have hoped the young Scot would win. When it transpired that Johansson, 

not Murray, was to be his opponent in the next round, he couldnt lift himself 

for it and played sort of flat. 

I was fascinated by the story about Murrays 

mother, Judy, videoing his opponents. I think more coaches should do that kind 

of preparation. I was surprised to hear that a top-30 player like Taylor Dent 

was that predictable. Maybe it was because he was still feeling his way on the 

grass. Unfortunately for Murray, if he wins his opening-round match he will be 

up against Radek Stepanek, the runner-up at Queens. Apart from being in 

confident mood and experienced on grass, the Czech is a tricky sort of player. 

Judys camcorder could be going into over-time trying to work out what hes 

going to do next because he doesnt even know himself.

One word of advice to Murray, if he hasnt already 

been given it: tape your ankles. I was pleased to see he withdrew from the Nottingham 

Open because he needs to recover properly from a sprain like that. I can tell 

him that Federer, Roddick and Hewitt all wear either ankle braces or tape their 

ankles before matches. 

As for the women, I dont think anyone will be 

surprised to hear that I think the winner will come from the bottom half of the 

draw, although world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport looks like having a clear run through 

to the final from the top half, notwithstanding something special from Kim Clijsters. 

It will be one from three: Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams or Justine Henin-Hardenne. 

Its difficult to choose but Ill go for the Russian to retain her title, 

just like Federer.

Interesting to see that Serena could meet Venus in 

the round of 16. The sisters havent met that early since they played each 

other for the first time at tour level in the 1998 Australian Open. It has nothing 

to do with either of them being lesser players, just that Serenas attention 

has moved from tennis to television. Fully focused, she would still be the one 

to beat at Wimbledon.

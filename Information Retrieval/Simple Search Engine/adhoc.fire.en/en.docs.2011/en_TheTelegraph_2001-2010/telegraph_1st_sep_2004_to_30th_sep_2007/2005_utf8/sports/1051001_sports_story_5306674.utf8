 Bhupathi, Paes to clash in semis

 - THAILAND OPEN 

New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, playing with separate partners, entered the semi-finals of the Thailand Open on Friday. 

Top seeds Paes and Paul Hanley beat local favourites Paradorn Srichaphan and Danai Udomchoke 6-4, 6-4 in the quarter final, according to information reaching here. 

Bhupathi and Justin Gimelstob of the US defeated the South African pair of Jeff Coetzee and Chris Haggard 6-1, 6-4 to advance to the last four. 

However, only one Indian will make it to the final as the Davis Cup teammates will square off for a spot in the championship match. 

The other semi-final pits Jonathan Elrich and Andy Ram of Israel against Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Australias Todd Perry. 

Meanwhile, in mens singles, Roger Federers near-perfect tennis dwarfed the giant-killing reputation of Luxembourgs Gilles Muller as the Swiss beat Muller 6-4, 6-3, add reports from Bangkok. 

The Swiss now moves into a four-way tie with Bjorn Borg, Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras for the 10th longest match-winning streak in the post-1968 Open era.

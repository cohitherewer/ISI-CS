 Lanky Russian given short shrift by little Belgian

 - Its disappointing... thinking Im a loser: Maria Sharapova 

ANDREW BAKER in PARIS

 Sharapova was often left standing by the pace of Henin-Hardennes game 

Maria Sharapova came to Roland Garros aiming to become the world No. 1but left the French Open, still No. 2, aiming to go shopping. 

A little retail therapy will help her to forget the manner in which she was outclassed in Tuesdays quarter final by Justine Henin-Hardenne, who played a near-faultless match to win 6-4, 6-2. 

The Belgian was out of tennis for seven months with a virus, and returned only in March this year. But since then she has been in tremendous form, and Sharapova was often left standing by the pace of her opponents game. 

Its disappointing going home and thinking Im a loser, Sharapova said afterwards. But there are going to be a lot more days when Im going to be a winner, so thats totally fine. 

The lanky young Russian did not do much wrong on Tuesday on the Court Suzanne Lenglen. The Wimbledon champion was simply overwhelmed by an opponent short in stature but long on skill and athleticism. 

Henin-Hardennes serve was a major factor in her victory, as was the power and accuracy of her backhand: one lob had Sharapova stranded mid-court, open-mouthed with a combination of admiration and frustration. 

I was feeling great on the court, Henin-Hardenne said. I felt I had a lot of time, and I was in a good rhythm, and I served very good. So everything was really positive. 

People say that the Belgians game is best suited to clay, but in this sort of form she could cause a lot of trouble at Wimbledon, and is surely now the favourite to triumph in Paris. 

In the semi-finals Henin-Hardenne will play Nadia Petrova, who defeated the 17-year-old Serbian Ana Ivanovic. Petrova is rather cruelly known on the tour as the Russian who hasnt won anything, but she was a semi-finalist here two years ago and is determined to go at least one step further. 

Henin-Hardenne was the latest player to deny Petrova her first tour title, when she beat her in the final of the recent Berlin tournament. But Petrova is sure that her experience here will fortify her. 

I have been already in a semi-final at the French Open, she said. All this crowd, all that expectation, its not easy. You have to learn to be quiet on yourself. Putting Henin-Hardenne away might be a different matter. 

Petrova says that she doesnt care that she is the forgotten one among the legions of Russian female players. But she apparently isnt a big fan of her compatriots. I dont care what people say, she said. And I think, especially, the looks shouldnt make you rich in what you do. 

Who can she have in mind? 

Ivanovic is tall and powerful and likely to improve. But the Serb was not the only promising youngster playing in the quarter finals. Sesil Karatantcheva, of Bulgaria, at just 15 years of age, was practically half the age of her 29-year-old opponent, Russias Elena Likhovtseva. Sadly for the teenager, this was a day on which experience told. 

Karatantcheva started with the ebullience of youth, seemingly unfazed by the occasion and finding every corner of the court with an aggressive game. She took the first set 6-2, and then the realisation that she was on the brink of a Grand Slam semi-final sunk in. 

You could see the confidence drain away, and with it the aggression. From dominating the court, Karatantcheva moved into defensive mode, just trying to keep the ball in play. Likhovtseva had the same idea, and more patience and skill. 

Her opponent in the semi-finals will be, to the unalloyed joy of the Roland Garros crowd, that stately and enduring heroine of Paris, Mary Pierce. The statuesque blonde knocked out the world No 1 and top seed, Lindsay Davenport, in what by Pierces standards were two straight and angst-free sets. 

Surely no more elegant figure has stood on a tennis court than the 30-year-old Frenchwoman, but the advancing years have done nothing to hasten the glacial speed of her service preparations. 

Everyone here is delighted that the 2000 winner has made it to the penultimate stage of the tournament, but some are worried that they might die of old age before the conclusion of the match.

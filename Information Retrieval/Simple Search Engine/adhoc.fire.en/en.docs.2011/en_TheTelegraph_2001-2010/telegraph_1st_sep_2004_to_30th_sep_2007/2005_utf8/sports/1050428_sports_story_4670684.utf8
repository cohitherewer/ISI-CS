The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Two greats out before semi-finals

 - World Snooker Stevens and rookie Murphy make last-four stage 

 Seven-time champion Stephen Hendry lost 11-13 to Stevens 

Sheffield: Two snooker greats ditched out of the world championship on Wednesday as Matthew Stevens and rookie Shaun Murphy reached the semi-finals. 

Stevens became the first player through to the last four when he beat seven-time former champion Stephen Hendry 13-11. 

Six-time winner Steve Davis, trailing 12-4 overnight to Murphy, then lost the opening frame as he bowed out 13-4. 

Welshman Stevens will be appearing in his fifth semi-final in six years at The Crucible, although he has only reached the final once in 2000 when he lost to Mark Williams. 

He said that Hendry had not produced his best snooker. 

?He?s the best player of all time and once he starts scoring, I don?t think anyone can beat him,? said Stevens. ?But luckily for me, he didn?t produce the snooker that?s won him seven world titles. 

?It wasn?t the best match in the world, but you?ve got to come through games like that. I managed to dig in and got the result.? 

Hendry said he was frustrated with his failure to find his best form in the tournament. 

?There was not a time in the championship where I felt I was playing well,? he said. ?I kept missing easy balls and you can?t expect to win the world championship playing like that.? 

Murphy, who had to qualify for the tournament, said after beating Davis that he can go on to win the title. 

?I can win another two matches so I can win the world championship,? said the 22-year-old Englishman. ?I?m going to give it my best shot.? 

Davis agreed. ?His potting was of an unbelievably high standard,? he said. ?He?s not the best positional player, but I don?t think there?s anyone hitting a ball over distance as straight as him. 

?I?m not discounting him as a contender. His potting could win it for him.? 

Defending champion Ronnie ?Sullivan moved to within three frames of the last four after going 10-6 up against Peter Ebdon at the end of the second session of their match. 

Ebdon fought back from 8-2 down, winning three frames in a row, but ?Sullivan claimed two out of the last three to move four frames clear.

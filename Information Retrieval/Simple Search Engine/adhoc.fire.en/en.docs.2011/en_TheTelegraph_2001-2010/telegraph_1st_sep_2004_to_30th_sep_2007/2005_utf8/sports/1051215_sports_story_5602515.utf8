 Merchant, Advani hopes alive

Mumbai: Yasin Merchant and his partner Pankaj Advani kept Indias hope alive for a berth in the semi-finals by defeating the Chinese duo Jin Long and Tian Pengfei in the round robin league of the Reid and Taylor Bombay Gymkhana Insta Snooker Doubles tournament on Wednesday. 

Former Asian champion Merchant and Advani, a former IBSF world title winner, defeated the Chinese pair 295-256 to emerge unscathed after four rounds in the event so far. 

But the Indian duo failed to get big scores, which saw them at third place. The Thai pair of Kobkit Palajin and Nitiwat Kanjanasri led the field with 1551 points, followed by the Chinese duo Jin Long and Tian Pengfei with 1531. 

Merchant and Advani have 1382 points. The top four, as per the aggregate scores, would advance to the semi-finals. (PTI)

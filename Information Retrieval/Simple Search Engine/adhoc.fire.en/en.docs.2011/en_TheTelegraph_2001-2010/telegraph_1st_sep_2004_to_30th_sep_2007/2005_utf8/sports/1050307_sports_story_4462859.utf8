New Delhi: Prakash Amritraj and Harsh Mankad played with refreshing freedom and joy as they completed straight set victories in the reverse singles to help India complete a 5-0 sweep over China in the Asia-Oceania (group I) Davis Cup quarter final here on Sunday. 

And in doing that, without dropping a set in the shortened reverse singles matches, the duo put up their hands to be counted for more such responsibility in the future. 

Yet, they were the first to point out that captain Leander Paes remained India?s best player on grass and were pleased to take some of the burden off his shoulders. 

Amritraj was in his elements when he took court for the third straight day ? his opening singles against Wang Yu Jr having to be continued on Saturday owing to rain the previous evening. Serving with precision and power, he left Sun Peng motionless. He backed that up with some consistent volleying as well. The 21-year-old broke the top-ranked Chinese in the third and seventh games of the first set and then in the third game of the second to cruise to a 6-2, 6-4 win in quick time. 

Coming on the back of his 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 success against Wang Yu Jr, this win meant that his serve was not broken at all this weekend. 

Mankad, who does not have as effective a serve as Amritraj, did not have such a clean slate but the fact that he was ready to adapt his game, digging in to launch the big serves when in trouble and playing competently at the net, was there for all to see yet again. 

China fielded their reserve left-hander, Lu Hao, in place of Wang Yu Jr. 

The 21-year-old?s only resistance to Mankad came in the fifth game of the second set after the Indian had broken him three successive times to take a 6-2, 3-0 lead. Mankad pulled himself together quickly enough to break Lu Hao?s serve twice to win 6-2, 6-2. 

India will now meet the winner of the tie between Indonesia and Uzbekistan. ?We would love to play that tie (from April 29) on the superb South Club courts,? Paes said.

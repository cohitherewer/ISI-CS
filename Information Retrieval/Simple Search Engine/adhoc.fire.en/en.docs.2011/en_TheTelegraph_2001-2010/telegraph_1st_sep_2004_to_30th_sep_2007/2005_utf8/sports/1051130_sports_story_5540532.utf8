The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kanpur Test may be shifted

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The third and final Test versus Sri Lanka, scheduled to be held at the Green Park in Kanpur from December 18, may have to be shifted owing to the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Associations (UPCAs) continuing problems with the state government. 

Despite a written request, we still havent been handed over the ground and Ive asked the BCCI to look at alternatives as time is short to properly organise a Test match, UPCA secretary Jyoti Bajpai told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

Jeff Crowe, who was Match Referee during the last Test at Green Park (against South Africa a year back), had slammed the facilities on offer there. Obviously, it doesnt help when an association doesnt have control over a ground which has been hosting international cricket for decades.

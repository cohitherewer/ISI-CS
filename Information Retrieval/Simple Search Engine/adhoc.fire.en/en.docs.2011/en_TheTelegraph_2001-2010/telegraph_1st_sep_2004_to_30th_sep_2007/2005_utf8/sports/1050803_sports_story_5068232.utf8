The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav omission shocking: Arjuna

 - ODIs vs AFRICA - Harbhajan also upset at being overlooked 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ranatunga feels someone with close to 10,000 ODI runs shouldnt have been ignored 

 Dambulla: Asias last 

 World Cup-winning captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, has criticised 

 Sourav Gangulys omission from the Inzamam-ul Haq-led 

 Asian XV for the three ODIs against Africa. 

 Its shocking... How 

 can you ignore somebody who has close to 10,000 runs in 

 limited overs cricket? Sourav didnt score in the last 

 few ODIs, but his record is fantastic, Ranatunga told 

 The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, he added: Im convinced the selectors (Majid Khan, Ravi Shastri, Graeme Labrooy, Shafiq-ul Haque) went about their job without any criteria... If form led to Sourav being overlooked, how come one or two others found a place? 

According to Ranatunga, who has ministerial responsibilities, form should get maximum weightage. At the same time, past performances must not be ignored... Sourav has reason to be peeved... 

Harbhajan Singh is also upset at being overlooked. Yeh selection mere samajh mein nahin aya... Dada (Sourav) bhi nahin hain! Zaheer Khan ko bhi nahin liye... Kya criteria raha? he wondered. 

 Sourav and Harbhajan arent the only ones asking 

 questions, though.

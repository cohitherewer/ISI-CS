Calcutta: East Bengals new recruit Congolese Liswa Nduti inked his contract on Monday and promptly left for Panaji to take part in the Federation Cup commencing at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. 

The 28-year-old central defender has been playing for the South African club Manning Rangers for the last seven years. Manning Rangers had emerged champions in the South African Premier Soccer League in 1996-97. 

Nduti became East Bengals third foreigner after Mike Okoro and Sidney Nakalanga. The red-and-golds will start their campaign on Wednesday (opening day) against Air India under the floodlights. 

Meanwhile, popular English analyst John Helm and former England international Russell Osman will be among the commentators for Zee Sports during their live telecast of the Federation Cup. 

Helm is one of Europes top commentators for the last 25 years and has covered several World Cups and European Championships. While Osman, an ex-English footballer, has played over 800 top-level games for Ipswich Town, Leicester City, Southampton and Bristol City. 

At Ipswich he was a member of the team that won the Uefa Cup in 1981 and finished runners-up in what is now called the Premier league, in 1980-81 and 1981-82.

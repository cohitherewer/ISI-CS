The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dempo beat SBT 1-0

Margao: Riding on the sixth minute strike by Ranty Martins, Federation Cup winners Dempo scored their second successive win beating State Bank of Travancore (SBT) 1-0 in the second round of the ninth National Football League at Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. 

Ranty, who gave anxious moments to SBT?s defence scored when he guided the ball into the net off a header from Clifford Miranda?s cross from the left. 

Dempo, who controlled the midfield for the major part of the match, could have easily won by a bigger margin had their strikers converted the chances that came their way. 

Ranty, who was the thorn in the flesh for the rival defence, had four chances to score was unlucky twice as his try hit the post. SBT?s goalkeeper also effected two good saves to deny Ranty from increasing the lead. 

Dempo with two win from two matches are at the top with six points. While SBT who with one loss and a win have three points. 

EB vs Fransa today 

Margao: Meanwile, East Bengal are readying to take on their next NFL rivals, Fransa Club of Goa. The league champions have come off a draw vs Mohun Bagan and are pushing for full points versus the league greenhorns. 

The big question is whether East Bengal?s star striker Bhaichung Bhutia wil be able to return among the goals this match. He has been unable to score in the last 13 matches, a well-over 250-day period and that isn?t a good sign. 

East Bengal will also be missing Chandan Das, red-carded in the derby match vs Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Bhowmick, though looked pretty relaxed and talked about how the league was a great effort but failed to raise the standard of the game in the country.

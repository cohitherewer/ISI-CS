 Aussies lack the hunger: Steve

 Waugh feels Australia have opened their mouth too much 

Nottingham: Former captain Steve Waugh has accused the current Australian side of lacking the hunger that made them the worlds best side. 

Waugh, whose hard-nosed leadership played a major part in making Australia the most dominant side in the past decade, also criticised Pontings side of making too many outrageous statements ahead of the Ashes series against England. 

Before the campaign began, veteran fast bowler Glenn McGrath predicted Australia would win 5-0. 

But McGrath, who missed the ongoing fourth Test against England here at Trent Bridge, could only watch as Australia were made to follow-on for the first time in 17 years. 

They dont seem to have had the hunger normally associated with Australian cricket sides, Waugh told BBC Radio Five on Sunday. 

From Australias point of view, there have been a few injuries, too many statements in the papers leading up to the series. Actions do speak louder than words and they need to perform on the pitch. 

I was never a big believer in making outrageous statements. Saying it is going to be 5-0 puts enormous pressure on the guys. 

But Waugh did go out of his way to praise Englands performance during the Tests, including Michael Vaughans captaincy, and the work done behind the scenes by coach Duncan Fletcher as he plotted to end a run of eight successive Australian Ashes series wins. 

England have played excellent cricket and have met head on challenges both on and off the field. They have called Australias bluff during series and certainly dominated the last couple of Tests. 

You have got to look at how England have played. They have played very good cricket. They have put a lot of pressure. Their bowling has been superb, their captaincy is very good and Duncan Fletcher has done a good job. 

Particularly after the first Test (which Australia won by 239 runs at Lords) they have shown enormous resilience. The England selectors have got to be congratulated for not making wholesale changes after the first Test. 

Former England off-spinner John Emburey felt England have mixed caution with aggression. 

England have dominated in all departments, they have been aggressive but also disciplined in that aggression. 

One thing England have been in the last couple of years is resilient. They have developed a steeliness and have taken on Australia and beat them at their own game. 

You have got to praise Duncan Fletcher and Michael Vaughan for the character they have shown, Emburey added.

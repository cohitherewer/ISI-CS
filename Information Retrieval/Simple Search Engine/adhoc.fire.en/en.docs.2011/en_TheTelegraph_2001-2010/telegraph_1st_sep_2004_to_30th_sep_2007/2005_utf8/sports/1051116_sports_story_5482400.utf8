 PCB still wants England to play in Karachi 

Multan: Pakistan cricket authorities would still like England play a one-day International in Karachi next month despite the car bomb blast in the southern city on Tuesday. 

Bomb blasts have been a part and parcel these days and if Australia can play in England after the London blasts and if Sri Lanka can play in India after Delhi blasts then England can play in Karachi, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

We hope the blast will not affect the tour and we will not take any decision on the Karachi one-dayer in panic, Khan said.

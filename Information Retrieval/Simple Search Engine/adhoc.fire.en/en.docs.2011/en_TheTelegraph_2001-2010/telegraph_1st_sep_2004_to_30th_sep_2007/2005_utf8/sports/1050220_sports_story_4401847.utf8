Kuala Lumpur: India?s Jyoti Randhawa soared with two eagles for a fine 65 to move into second place, but has an uphill task of toppling in form title-holder Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand after the third round of the Carlsberg Malaysian Open here Saturday. 

The Thai pulled six shots clear of the chasing pack and is poised to defend a title for the first time in his illustrious career. 

The Asian number one, who held an overnight two-shot advantage, romped to a five-under-par 67 at Saujana Golf and Country Club as his challengers wilted in sweltering heat in the $ 1.21 million event jointly sanctioned by the Asian and European Tours. 

Randhawa made it a day for the Asian Tour, taking advantage of the par-fives with two eagles and one birdie. The Indian, who won the Volvo Masters of Asia in Kuala Lumpur last December, did not want to rule out the prospect of catching the runaway leader. 

?It seems tough and Thongchai looks to be playing well and he?s a good player. But what can you say in golf. A guy on 11-under can come from behind and win. One more day to go and I?ll take my chances tomorrow,? said Randhawa, who was second behind Thongchai on the Asian Tour Order of Merit last season. 

Irish star Padraig Harrington, ranked eighth in the world, birdied his last two holes for a 67 to force his way into the final group Sunday. He is joint third with Thailand?s 20-year-old prom Meesawat and Swede Henrik Stenson, seven strokes off the lead. 

Thongchai?s 19-under-par 197 total matched the second lowest 54-hole aggregate in Asian golf history as he looks certain to join Graham Marsh (1974-75) and Tomoo Ishii (1964-65) as players to win back-to-back triumphs since the Malaysian Open was inaugurated in 1962. 

A late bogey on 18 failed to dampen the former paratrooper?s spirits. ?I had a good start on the front nine with birdies on the first and third holes which got me going. I hit my irons really well and putted nicely. Everything was perfect again today,? said Thongchai, a six-time winner on the Asian Tour. 

?It?s nice to lead by six shots into the last round. My plan will be the same Sunday ? fairways, greens and putts. I?m playing quite nicely and hopefully, tomorrow I can go on and win this again. I?m feeling confident,? added the Thai, who had seven birdies on the card. 

Harrington, bidding to better two runner-up finishes in Malaysia, was delighted with two closing birdies which will give him a chance to challenge Thongchai and Randhawa in the final group. 

?Two birdies to finish, I?m happy with that,? said the Dubliner. ?Thongchai obviously likes it here. It is within his hands and he is totally in control.? 

After going two rounds without a bogey, the 20-year-old prom had the worst possible start with a double bogey on his opening hole. His drive hit a cart path and landed out of bounds but the talented Thai courageously fought back for a 71 and had the pleasure of outscoring playing partner Miguel Angel Jimenez by two strokes. 

Bjorn signed for a 73 to drop to sixth place on 205 while Jimenez?s 73 left him in joint 13th place on 208.

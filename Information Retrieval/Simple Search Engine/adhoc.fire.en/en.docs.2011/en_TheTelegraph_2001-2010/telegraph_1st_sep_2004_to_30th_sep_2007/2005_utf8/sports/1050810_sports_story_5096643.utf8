The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Be it life or sport, nothing is constant, says Muralidharan

 - A bowler should begin his job thinking the batsman could get him away 50 per cent of the time

Colombo: At 33, Muttiah Muralidharan has achieved much more than most dream of ? 549 wickets in Tests, well over 350 in ODIs... Yet, the master off-spinner remains hungry, something which came through during a chat with The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra late on Monday. 

The following are excerpts: 

On whats left to achieve 

(Laughs) So, you think Ive achieved everything? Doing well in the next (2007) World Cup is a target... I feel Im good enough for three-four years and also feel I can win more matches for Sri Lanka. 

On whether hes looking to sign off with X number of Test wickets 

Not really, but if I continue for three-four years, getting to 700 is a strong possibility... Of course, I cant say I will get there. 

On whether the controversies surrounding his action hurt him in a big way 

Even if I want to reply, I cant as our board (Sri Lanka Cricket) has barred me from making any comments on my action... Im letting this pass. 

On the newly-introduced 15 degrees allowance 

Changes have to be made... Be it life or sport, nothing is constant. 

On being more than a sporting icon for Sri Lanka 

Im happy if Im seen as an ambassador for my country... Cricket has given everything... Fame, money... I mean, youre interviewing me because of what Ive achieved in cricket... If Im able to give something back, in whatever way, Im happy. In any case, we have an obligation to society. 

On joining hands with Shane Warne for tsunami relief 

Shanes gesture has been touching... Ive myself contributed towards the rebuilding of around 100 houses near Galle... Shane and, if Ive got it right, the provincial Victorian government are pitching in with 100-200 houses in another part of Sri Lanka... 

On the rivalry between him and Warne 

We arent at each others throat! Its the Media which has fuelled this so-called rivalry. I respect Shane for being a great bowler, one of the greatest ever. Equally, Shane respects me. 

On whether hes sorry that Warne gets caught in controversies 

Hes entitled to lead his life the way he deems fit... It wont be proper for me to talk about his private life. 

On what cricket has taught him 

To repay the affection of well-wishers... To overcome odds... To behave responsibly... Theres this saying that one learns everyday ? thats true of everybody. 

On the batsmen who have played him with the least discomfort 

Depends... Those who got runs on a particular day are the ones who had it easy... Over the years, Ive bowled to some of the biggest and brightest ? Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Inzamam-ul Haq... All have the capability to take on any bowler. 

On his famed mental toughness 

A bowler should begin his job thinking the batsman could get him away 50 per cent of the time... The next step is to eat into that 50 per cent... Even if Im hit, Im confident about getting that batsman. 

On whether he has admired any one cricketer for being tough in the mind 

Many... Many... None more so than Steve Waugh, though... 

On the experimental changes in one-day cricket 

Look, the one-day game had become monotonous... Changes were needed and, perhaps, theyre going to be well received once all teams implement them. 

On whether Twenty20 has the potential to take off in the sub-continent 

Cant say... Mind you, its a hit in England. 

On whether, today, hes especially thankful to any one person 

Youve asked a tough question... Im grateful to so many, beginning with my coach Sunil Fernando... Hes the one who encouraged me to play cricket... All our national coaches have helped... Arjuna Ranatunga, too... Im also thankful to my family for being supportive and instilling the right values... 

On the difference marriage (to Chennais Madhimalar) has made 

(Laughs again) The biggest difference is that Im not single! Now, off the field, there are more responsibilities. 

On career options once he is through with cricket 

Havent thought of anything. 

On being a big fan of Brazilian soccer 

Im attracted to the attacking style, not individual Brazilians. 

On his hero outside cricket 

Another tough one... I suppose the ones Ive admired most have been my parents (Chinnaswamy Muthiah and Laxmi). In cricket, as you know, I grew up idolising Viv Richards. 

On the forthcoming ODIs and Tests in India 

Im excited... We havent had a series there since 1997-98. 

Finally, on tips to emerging off-spinners 

That cricket is a hard game calling for the highest degree of dedication... If you arent willing to work hard and make sacrifices, look at options.

 Fine win for Saptarshi

Pardubice: Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of compatriot International Master S. Satyapragyan in the third round of the Czech international open chess tournament here. 

IM S. Poobesh Anand continued to make merry in the 332 players nine-round Swiss tournament with his third straight victory in as many games. 

With six round still remaining in the $10000 prize money tournament, Poobesh is the only Indian in lead along with 10 others after he defeated IM Igor Smirnov of Ukraine wherein the former played black. 

GM Tejas Bakre, IM S. Kidambi, M R Venkatesh and Satyapragyan are closely behind the 11 leaders with 2.5 points each from three rounds while IMs D V Prasad, Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury, Eesha Karavade and Tania Sachdev are among those who have 2 points. 

Saptarshi was the other Indian who scored a fine victory over Fabian Muller of Germany. Playing white, Saptarshi nurtured his opening advantage well to come back strongly after losing the second round game. 

Also in similar shoes was Tania Sachdev who accounted for another German Nikolas Lubbe who played black. Tania was in her element in this positional encounter. 

Fresh from his maiden GM norm made in the Canadian Open, S Kidambi could have pressed harder against Piotr Dobrowolski of Poland, but the latter came out of the clutches of the Indian in the middle game. 

Playing the white side of an English opening, Kidambi got a routine advantage in the early part of middle game but failed to find the right chord as a few pieces changed hands. 

Kidambi was slightly better after the trading of queens too leading to a rook and minor piece endgame but black had sufficient counter play to back himself. The truce was signed in just 28 moves.

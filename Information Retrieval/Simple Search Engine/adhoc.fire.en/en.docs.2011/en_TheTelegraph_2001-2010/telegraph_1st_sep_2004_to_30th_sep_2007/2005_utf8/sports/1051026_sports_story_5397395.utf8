 Clarke hits back 

Sydney: Australian batsman Michael Clarke has hit back at critics who say his swashbuckling style is not suited to No. 4 on the Test batting line-up. 

The 24-year-old has come under fire since he was promoted from No. 6 earlier this month when predecessor Damien Martyn became the scapegoat for Australias first Ashes defeat in 16 years. 

Mark Waugh, Australias longest-serving No. 4, said Clarkes technique was too loose after he scored only 40 in two Test innings against the World XI this month. 

Former Test player Kerry Keefe has also questioned Clarkes credentials in the position ahead of a three-Test series against the West Indies beginning in Brisbane next week. 

Clarke, who has been tipped as a future Australian captain, said he would not be changing his style, commenting: Its got me this far. 

He denied he was better suited to No. 4, where there is more margin for error, and said his experience playing No. 4 at state level would stand him in good stead. 

Thats my ideal position, he said in remarks published in an Australian morning daily on Tuesday. 

Its where Ive batted for New South Wales for a while and hopefully I can cement my spot there for Australia. 

Clarke exploded onto the Test cricket scene last year with a hundred on debut against India and averaged almost 50 during 2004. (AFP)

New Delhi: A new chapter in Indian tennis will unfold on Friday when Prakash Amritraj leads the hosts challenge against seven-time champions Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group play-off here. 

Amritraj, Indias No.1 player, will take on Jonas Bjorkman in the opener while Rohan Bopanna faces Swedens number one Thomas Johansson on the opening day of the qualifying tie, the winner of which will go through to the elite 16-nation World Group next year. 

Captain Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi will come together after a gap of nearly five months against Bjorkman and Simon Aspelin in the doubles rubber on Saturday. 

The reverse singles will be played on Sunday with Bopanna to take on Johansson in the final rubber. 

Paes decision to leave out Harsh Mankad, who was in the reserve but has the highest ATP Tour ranking among the Indian players, was based on strategy. 

He said if Mankad, with a ranking of 239, was to play, Amritraj, ranked 271, would have been the number two player and would be pitted against Johansson, which would have gone against India. 

Harsh is an aggressive player from the back while Rohan has the ability to hit big serves which is important on the first day of the tie. Also, Prakash playing Bjorkman would give us a better chance, Paes said after the draw. 

Leander said his physical readiness did play a part in his decision to sit out. 

I had to see, as an individual, how ready I was to play, Leander said. The mental ability was not a factor, tennis skills were not a factor. 

The fact that I have not been fully fit this summer, not having played as many matches as required when you take on a team like Sweden, was indeed a factor. 

We had a discussion on Wednesday when the whole team came together. Harsh stood up and put the teams interest ahead of his own. 

It was a matter of taking inputs from all concerned and me taking the responsibility for the decision. 

Mahesh Bhupathi said, winning one point on the first day is our aim. It is part of the strategy to give Leander maximum rest for the doubles. 

Mankad put up a brave front. 

The captain and the team felt this is the best strategy. I have learnt a lot this week and feel good about my game, Mankad said. 

Prakash said he felt more confident now than when he made his debut two years ago against The Netherlands. 

Its definitely a big difference. I have eight matches under my belt and it always gives confidence when you play someone like Thomas Johansson or Jonas Bjorkman, Amritraj said. 

Paes had praised Amritraj throughout the week. Prakash is going to lead the team in the tie, was how he put it on Thursday. This is going to be a learning experience, said the captain. who had sat out of the zonal. (PTI)

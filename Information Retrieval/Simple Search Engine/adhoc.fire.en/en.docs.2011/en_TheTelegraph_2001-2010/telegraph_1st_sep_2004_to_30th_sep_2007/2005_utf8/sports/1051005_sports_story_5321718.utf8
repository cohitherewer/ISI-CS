 Fitness levels have gone up, claims Frazer

New Delhi: Indian cricket teams biomechanist Ian Frazer Tuesday defended the strict fitness regime introduced by coach Greg Chappell, saying the players fitness levels have only gone up since the new season began. Obviously, that includes captain Sourav Ganguly as well. 

Frazer said the intense fitness programme was created keeping in mind the busy schedule ahead and that critics cannot have it both ways, cribbing about players poor fitness on one side and complaining about the workload on the other. 

If they (the players) have an increase in workload, I have not heard them say. It might be more than it was in the past, but their fitness levels have gone up too, the 39-year old Australian said. 

Greg and I set out to make them physically and mentally ready, to have a good foundation for the coming time. I think the players are extremely excited about the feedback, he said. 

You cant have it both ways. When we took over, it was said they are low on fitness levels. Now when the workload is more, they say they havent improved. I think the fitness levels have gone up from what it was before, he said. 

Dhoni praises Chappell 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday praised coach Greg Chappell saying he has immensely benefited from working under the Australian, says a report from Jamshedpur. 

Chappell is a well informed coach and he knows how to bring out the best from the players. I have immensely benefited from his guidance, Dhoni said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Now, Atwal tied eighth with Vijai 

 Arjun Atwal 

 Vancouver: Arjun Atwal moved to tied eighth 

 position, shooting a three-under 67 in the second round 

 of the $4.9 million Canadian Open on Friday. 

 A former Asian Tour No. 1, Atwal aggregated a one-under 

 139 and was on par with defending champion Vijai Singh, 

 former Asian Tour champion Ted Purdy and South African Trevor 

 Immelman among others at the Shaughnessy Golf and Country 

 Club. 

Overnight joint leader Mark Calcavecchia slotted birdies on three straight holes on the front nine, and again managed a birdie on the 18th for a three-under 67. He has a five-shot lead after the second round. 

First-round joint leader Lucas Glover shot a 72 and was in second place. Carlos Franco (70), Jerry Kelly (66) and Jesper Parnevik (72) were another shot behind at 138. 

Atwal, two-over on the first day, started with a birdie on the first, but gave back that shot on the third, dropping yet another on the sixth. He made the back in ninth and turned in even par. He found his touch on the back nine with a birdie on the 13th and an eagle on 15th. 

On the 16th, he picked up another shot to go four-under, but a short chip on the third shot on the 18th left with him a tricky par putt which he missed and made bogey to end at three-under. 

Earlier, Singh mixed six birdies with a pair of early bogeys to sign for the joint best round of the day. 

 Returning to action after missing last weeks 

 Deutsche Bank Championship with a sore back, the smooth-swinging 

 Fijian was back in his familiar rhythm and in a tie for 

 eighth after starting the day at joint 71st. 

 There was little for Canadian golf fans to celebrate 

 as Mike Weir, the 2003 Masters winner, stumbled to a five-over 

 75, missing the cut at the Canadian Open for the first time 

 since 1999. 

 The tournament began with 16 Canadians 

 trying to become the first home-grown winner since Pat Fletcher 

 in 1954. But only Stephen Ames survived the guillotine and 

 will carry local hopes into the weekend. (Agencies)

 No Real regrets about Spanish move

 - Shearer instrumental in my joining Newcastle, says Owen

Newcastle: England striker Michael Owen believes his troubled year at Real Madrid will help him make a major impact on his return to the Premier League with Newcastle United. 

I have no regrets at all about joining Real Madrid a year ago, the 25-year-old told a news conference at St James Park on Wednesday, following his ?15 million move on a four-year deal. 

Im quite an inquisitive person so when I knew of Real Madrids interest I didnt want to spend the rest of my life without playing in another European country. And to get the opportunity to play for one of the most famous clubs in the world was a fantastic opportunity. 

You might like it, you might not, but whatever happens at least now I have no doubts in my mind and I can live the rest of my life knowing what it was like. 

A return to Liverpool seemed his first choice but when that did not develop he said Newcastle was the ideal alternative. 

Ive been honest from the start. I have an obvious attachment to Liverpool and if that deal could have happened it would have been one big option but as the deadline approached it didnt seem that would be possible, he said. 

Owen, however, admitted that his former England strike partner Alan Shearer played a major role in his decision to leave for Newcastle United. 

Alan was a great help throughout and instrumental in my decision, Owen was quoted as saying by a daily. 

I had spoken to him many times over the past few weeks and he should work for the Newcastle tourist board when he finishes playing football. He even offered to give up his No. 9 shirt but I have declined. Number 10 will do for me, added Owen.Although there had been a lot of agonising, and a lot of telephone calls, it was an easy decision in the end, said Owen, who had also been linked with a move back to Anfield. 

People will point out that, only a week or so ago, I listed Newcastle as the last of my options but circumstances change very quickly, as I have discovered. (Reuters)

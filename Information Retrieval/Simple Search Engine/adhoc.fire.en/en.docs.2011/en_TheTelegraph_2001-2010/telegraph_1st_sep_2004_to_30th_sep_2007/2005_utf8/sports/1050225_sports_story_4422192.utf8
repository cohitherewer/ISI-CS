 Parab, Pathan guide West to 9-wkt win

Hyderabad: An unbeaten century by opener Satyajit Parab gave Sachin Tendulkar-led West Zone a nine wicket victory over South Zone in the Duleep Trophy match here on Thursday. 

Parab scored 106 and was ably supported by Irfan Pathan (61), who was promoted in the batting order, to guide the team to a comprehensive win at the Visaka Stadium on the penultimate day of the four-day match. 

After restricting South to 241 in their second innings earlier in the day, West got the required 223 runs losing only Wasim Jaffer?s wicket. The Mumbai opener made 28. 

The crowd was disappointed once again as Tendulkar, who had made just four in the first innings, was not required to bat the second time with Pathan and Parab taking West home. 

South Zone, resuming at 141 for five on the third morning, were bundled out for 241 just 40 minutes after lunch with overnight batsman Venugopal Rao compiling a neat 79 to help set a target of 222. 

Parab and Jaffer began the chase in right earnest and batted with elegance against South?s bowling attack led by Test star Laxmipathi Balaji and D. Vinay Kumar. The two new ball bowlers were not effective with the wicket offering little assistance. 

Parab?s 150-ball knock was a result of a 227-minute long stay during which he hit 17 fours. 

Jaffer was dismissed by Anil Kumble with V.V.S. Laxman taking a neat catch in the slips. That was the only success for South as Pathan joined Parab and the duo took the game away. 

Brief scores: South Zone 187 and 241 (Venugopal Rao 79). West Zone 207 and 223/1 (Satyajit Parab 106, Irfan Pathan 61). West Zone won by 9 wkts.

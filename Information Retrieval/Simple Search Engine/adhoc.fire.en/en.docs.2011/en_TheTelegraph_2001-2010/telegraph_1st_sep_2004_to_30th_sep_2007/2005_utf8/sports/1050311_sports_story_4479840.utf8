Chandigarh: Conquering fresh peaks is nothing new for Sachin Tendulkar. As Mohali braced for a ?double? and the champagne bottles waited to be uncorked in the pavilion, Asim Kamal played the perfect party pooper. 

The new ball had just been used for three deliveries and Hasan Naved-ul Rana?s fourth one didn?t have anything threatening about it. As Sachin sliced loosely outside the off stump, Kamal took a fine diving catch low to his right at gully. It meant the end of a dream, and unless something dramatic happens in the second innings here, the 35th century will have to wait. Maybe Eden Gardens? 

After Thursday?s 94, only 27 is needed to help him reach the magical 10,000 mark. 

?I never thought I had stopped a world record? I was only delighted to see the back of Sachin,? Kamal told The Telegraph later. 

As Sachin returned trying to hide his disappointment, the music stopped and the waving of the tri-colour halted, it seemed the PCA Stadium was struggling to come to terms with the sudden change in script. 

They had waited patiently to witness the unfolding of history despite the boring second and third sessions following Virender Sehwag?s dismissal. The Indians may have forged ahead by 135 runs but statistics reveal that while 134 runs came before lunch, only 129 were added once Sehwag departed. 

The Indians will have to get 100-odd runs in a hurry on the fourth day to harbour hopes of a victory since the weather gods may play truant once again. It drizzled for a while after stumps and the threat of rain cannot be ruled out. 

The way the Indian batsmen flirted outside the off stump to the Ranas and the Mohammed Samis, one would shudder to think about what would have happened if Shoaib Akhtar was around. A few catches were dropped, twice off Sehwag, and Sami?s tendency to overstep cost the side dear. 

Sourav Ganguly escaped after being caught at first slip, courtesy one of Sami?s 14 no balls. The Team India captain and Rahul Dravid were also hit on the helmet after misjudging the bounce. 

The early fall of Dravid ? his dismissal was similar to Sachin?s ? had no effect on Sehwag as he continued with his bold approach after completing his ninth century. He lifted Abdul Razzaq?s first ball for an amazingly low six over long on and then made his intentions clear against Danish Kaneria. 

As in Multan, Pakistan had to pay dearly for Sehwag?s dropped chances. It?s debatable if India would have been able to maintain the scoring rate if the visitors had held on to their chances. The murderous assault left deep scars on their bowling and Bob Woolmer would sure have to work overtime to chalk out plans to contain Sehwag. 

He added 103 for the second wicket with Dravid and 118 during his third wicket partnership with Sachin. Until a mistimed pull ended his 173-run innings (244 balls, 19x4, 2x6), he had seemed destined for a double hundred. 

Sachin?s innings can be described in two parts ? till reaching 40 he looked in sublime touch, but after crossing his half-century, he became cautious and circumspect inviting the bowlers to pile on the pressure. As Sachin and Sourav got together, they even struggled to play the ball into the gaps. 

Kaneria came round the wicket to bowl a leg-stump line against Sachin and that slowed down things further. Sachin finally departed after facing 202 balls that included 11 boundaries ? the sixth time to depart in the nineties in his career. 

Sourav didn?t seem in his elements. He struggled with the timing and was let off again when Taufeeq Umar dropped him at gully, immediately after the no-ball reprieve. Salman Butt, though, made amends, holding on to the bat-pad chance well. 

VVS Laxman hit three classy fours off Rana but that hardly proved his touch. How he flourishes in the company of the late-order will be important. 

Pakistan bowled with far greater purpose and direction on the third day but the lack of killer instinct came through. The passion was missing as often fielders moved about with drooping shoulders with none around to egg on the side. 

The visitors could argue that Rudi Koertzen gave Sachin an early life off Kaneria, but the Sehwag onslaught was to happen. Until they find a way to stop that, the series will be tough to conquer.

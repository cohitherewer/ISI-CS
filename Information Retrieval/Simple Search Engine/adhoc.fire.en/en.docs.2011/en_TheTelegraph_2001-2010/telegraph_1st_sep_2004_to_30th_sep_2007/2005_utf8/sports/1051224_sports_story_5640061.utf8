 We need to tour with fully-fit squad: Vaughan

London: England captain Michael Vaughan is hoping that mid-series blues in the form of injuries do not haunt the team during the India tour next year. 

Weve just got to make sure we get everyone back as quick as possible and make sure we hit India with a fully-fit squad, Vaughan said after returning from Pakistan. 

Vaughans side lost some sheen of their Ashes-winning feat after their drubbing against Pakistan in both Test and one-dayers. 

In the last couple of years weve been very successful because we have had a settled team, he told a radio station. As soon as you start losing one or two components in that side, it is bound to unsettle you somewhat. 

Vaughan said that the team would look at the injuries in a positive way as it opens up opportunities for youngsters. In the Ashes series we only used 12 players in five matches. That is something that had not happened for a long time in an Ashes series. 

But you cant control injuries and when these injuries come about it does create opportunities for younger players to stand up and test themselves at the highest level, said Vaughan. 

In Pakistan, batsman Andrew Strauss missed a Test as he returned home for the birth of his son and England face a similar scenario in India with star allrounder Andrew Flintoffs wife expecting a baby on march 20. 

The skipper said they would take the positives from the tour and learn from the failures. They put us under a lot of pressure. We just were not at our best, but I am sure we will learn from the experience of being out there, he said. (PTI)

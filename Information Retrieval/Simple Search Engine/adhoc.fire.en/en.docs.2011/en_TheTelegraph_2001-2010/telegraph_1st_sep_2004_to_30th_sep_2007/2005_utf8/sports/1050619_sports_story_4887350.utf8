 Alis death signals end of an era

 - Edens No mushtaq, no test hero wont ever be forgotten

Indore: Syed Mushtaq Alis passing away signals the end of an era. He was the Indias oldest living Test cricketer. 

A former Captain in the Holkar Army, Ali had several qualifiers going for him: fearless, stylish, colourful, popular, yet amiable. He formed a considerable part of the countrys cricket folklore. 

Such was his popularity that a Calcutta crowd once gheraoed the great Duleepsinhji, then chairman of the selection committee, with the refrain no Mushtaq no Test when he dropped for an unofficial Test vs an Australian Services side. He was later recalled. 

The opener, though began his career as a slow left-arm bowler, quickly proving his mettle as a batsman. 

He was known as the original dasher and his opening partner Vijay Merchant used to often shake his head in disbelief as he repeatedly stepped out to thrash the pacers. The right-handed opener was very quick on his feet, and always introduced a spirit of adventure into his play. 

He is most remembered for his fine 112 in just two and-a-half hours vs England and was involved in a lively 203-run opening stand with Merchant. That the first time any Indian had scored a century abroad. 

His daredevil batting often saw him lose his wicket, but he soon proved that he could bat with responsibility when he came back as an opener in the third Test in Calcutta against the West Indies in 1948-49 and scored 54 and 106 batting out of character to help India save the match. 

That turned out to be his last success. He was never in the good books of selectors who brought him back as an afterthought in the 1951-52 series against England. 

Mushtaq failed in that match and was promptly omitted from the 1952 tour of England which effectively brought the curtains down on a career which spanned almost two decades but comprised only 11 Tests. 

He also penned a book called Cricket delightful in 1967. (PTI)

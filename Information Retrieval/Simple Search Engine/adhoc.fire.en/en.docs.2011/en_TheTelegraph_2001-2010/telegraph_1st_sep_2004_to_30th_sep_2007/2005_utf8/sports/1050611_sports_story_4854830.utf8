 Tyson weighs in at 233 lbs

Washington: Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson tipped the scales at 233 pounds on Thursday for his fight against Irishman Kevin McBride on Saturday. 

Tyson, 38, weighed the same amount for his last fight, a fourth-round knockout loss to Danny Williams last year in Louisville, Kentucky. 

The 6-foot-6 McBride, who has a 32-4-1 record with 27 knockouts, weighed 271 pounds, his highest ever for a fight. The 32-year-old McBride has won his last seven fights. 

Tyson, hoping to re-emerge in the title picture after losing two of his last three fights, is six pounds lighter than his previous highest fight weight. 

The 5-foot-11 Tyson weighed 239 for his seventh-round knockout of Brian Nielsen in 2001. (Reuters)

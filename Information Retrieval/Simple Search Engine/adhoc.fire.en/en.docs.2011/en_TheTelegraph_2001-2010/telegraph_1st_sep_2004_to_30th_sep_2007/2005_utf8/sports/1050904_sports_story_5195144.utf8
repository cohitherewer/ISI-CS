 Give Greg time: Lillee

Chennai: Former Australian speedster Dennis Lillee on Saturday said that Indian coach Greg Chappell should be given time to put the side back to its winning ways. 

Lillee, in the city to assess the wards at the MRF Pace Academy, said that Chappell should be supported by the Board, players and the media. 

You cannot expect anyone to turn around a team in two or three months. Give Greg a chance to try to put a system in place. And possibly, provide some quicker wickets at Indian venues, which might be of some help too, he said. (PTI)

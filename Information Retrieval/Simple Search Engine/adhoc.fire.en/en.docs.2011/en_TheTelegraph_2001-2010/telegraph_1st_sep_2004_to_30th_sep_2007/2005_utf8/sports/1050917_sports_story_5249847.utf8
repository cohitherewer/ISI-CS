London: Uefa Cup holders CSKA Moscow needed two late goals from Brazilian playmaker Daniel Carvalho to make a winning start to their defence on Thursday. 

Carvalho scored twice in three minutes as CSKA defeated Denmarks FC Midtjylland 3-1 in their first round, first-leg clash in front of a handful of fans. 

Dinamo Bucharest inflicted a crushing 5-1 defeat on hapless Everton as the Premier League side, denied a Champions League place by Villarreal, capitulated in the Romanian capital to suffer their heaviest European defeat. 

Dutch league leaders and last seasons UEFA Cup semi-finalists AZ Alkmaar also shipped five goals in a shock 5-3 reverse at Krylya Sovietov Samara, who languish in 13th place in the 16-team Russian Premier League. 

On a good night for Russian sides, league leaders Lokomotiv Moscow came from behind to earn a 2-1 win away at Brann Bergen.

 Bhupathi, Woodbridge in quarter finals

Melbourne: Third seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge registered a hard fought win over Spanish duo of Albert Costa and Rafael Nadal to move into the quarter finals of the men?s doubles championship at the Australian Open here Sunday. 

The Indo-Australian pair rallied from a set down to win 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 in just over an hour and 30 minutes to set up a clash with fifth seeds Kevin Ullyett and Wayne Black of Zimbabwe for a place in the last four. 

Bhupathi and Woodbridge had a tough time against the Spanish pair as they could not gain a single break point in the first two sets. 

But the duo used all their experience to take the second set tie-break with relative ease and then broke their opponents twice in the decider to book their berth in the quarter finals.

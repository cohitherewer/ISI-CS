The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vettori certain, Styris doubtful

Bloemfontein: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming will go into the first of five one-day Internationals (ODI) against South Africa on Sunday with a vivid memory of a mistake he made on a previous visit to Springbok Park. 

We misread the pitch, said Fleming of a 2003 World Cup encounter against Sri Lanka. 

Fleming said there would be changes from the New Zealand team that beat South Africa by five wickets in a 20-over International in Johannesburg on Friday, with star left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori certain to return. 

Vettori was rested from Fridays game after playing for the World XI against Australia earlier in the week. 

Scott Styris is doubtful for Sunday after suffering a recurrence of a hamstring injury but Orams fitness will be assessed ahead of the game with a view to him being able to bowl. 

South African captain Graeme Smith said his team, who are on an unbeaten 14-match streak in ODIs, would also show changes from Friday. 

Boeta Dippenaar is sure to return, while the batting order will be shuffled.

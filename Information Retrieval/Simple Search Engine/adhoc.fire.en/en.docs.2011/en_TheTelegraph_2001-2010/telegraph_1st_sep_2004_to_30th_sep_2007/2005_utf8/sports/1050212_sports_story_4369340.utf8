 Churchill look for first win

 Yusif Yakubu

Kozhikode: Yet to recover from their poor start, Churchill Brothers will look forward to earn their first full points when they take on SBT in a crucial National Football League tie on Friday. 

?It is true that we did not play well initially, but after settling for a draw against Salgaocar in the last round, we will now go for a win to improve our position,? Churchill Brothers coach, Shabir Ali said. 

While the Goan team has just two points from five outings, SBT are better placed with five points from six matches. To counter SBT?s home advantage, Ali is banking on his strikeforce comprising Brazilian Marcos Periera, I.M. Vijayan and Ghanian Yusif Yakubu to clinch the issue. 

?We certainly enjoy the advantage of playing three foreigners, who can make the difference between the two sides,? Ali said. 

The match will also take Vijayan down memory lane to the Scissors Cup final in 1996 when he scored the winner for JCT against Malaysian club Perlis. 

?I know about the sport-loving crowd here and they will support a good game no matter which team plays well,? he said.

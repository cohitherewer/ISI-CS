 Barcelona will be afraid, very afraid 

 - Rijkaard may be worried seeing Chelsea demolish Arsenal

If Barcelona and Real Madrid had representatives at Highbury on Sunday, sizing up the opposition before their titanic first knockout round clashes in the Champions League next year against Chelsea and Arsenal, respectively, they will have returned to the warmer climes of Spain with mixed emotions. 

The man from Madrid will have been happy, but the man from Barcelona will have been afraid, very afraid. 

Chelseas victory, which restored their nine-point lead at the head of the Premier League, highlighted not only their strengths but also Arsenals weaknesses. It was the perfect match for Spanish spies to take in and even if they had watched it at home on television, they would have noticed the glaring gulf between the sides. It couldnt have been missed. 

Will the mighty Barca be worried? Will Frank Rijkaard, their coach, drip beads of sweat when he reads his scouts report? If not fear, he will almost certainly pour over it with a sense of trepidation. 

Chelsea talk the talk better than most, most notably through Jose Mourinho, but they walk the walk as well. More like strut, actually, their cocktail of arrogance and resilience a potent brew. 

What Rijkaard will have seen on Sunday is likely to be what he will get at Stamford Bridge in February except for Michael Essien, the Ghana enforcer, who will be suspended from both legs. Rijkaard can thank his lucky stars for that, with Essien playing on the edge again and lucky not to be sent off. Chelsea will miss him. 

But there is much more where Essien came from; Claude Makelele, John Terry and Frank Lampard are not afraid to mix it, either. Terry, always first to argue with Rob Styles, the referee, when he felt a point needed to be made, will be crucial in the Nou Camp trenches. 

Real will have slept the easier on Sunday night. Arsenal may have carried all before them in the group stage of the Champions League, winning five of their six matches, but they are different animals in the Premiership. 

Not so much timid, as some of their accusers have suggested, but certainly without the same snap that they have carried abroad this season. Sol Campbell, Kolo Toure and Lauren are not afraid to get stuck in. Philippe Senderos is not averse to dishing it out, either. However, all they could muster on Sunday was nothing more than macho posturing that impressed no one. 

The Real man at Highbury will have spotted an Arsenal defence riddled with uncertainty, especially in a torrid first half. It might prove misleading, with both Toure, at right back, and Lauren, at left back, forced to play out of position because of injuries. 

Ashley Cole should be back by February, giving Arsenal extra stability and attacking options, and allowing Toure, at centre half, and Lauren, at right back, to resume their normal duties. 

At times, without Toure alongside him, Campbell appeared lost, no more so than when Joe Cole skipped past him for the second goal. Reals spy may have also detected a frailty up front in the temperament department. Robin van Persie behaved childishly and Thierry Henry does not inspire as captain when the game is spiralling beyond his control. 

Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, also appeared powerless to stop the rot. Emilio Butragueno, the Madrid sporting director, announced on Sunday that his club were not interested in hiring Wenger next season and he will have seen little at Highbury to alter that opinion. 

In two months time, Arsenal could have improved and Chelsea could have gone off the boil. It would be dangerous to form a definitive opinion on the evidence of one bitter afternoon. But David Beckham and Co. will have enjoyed the viewing more. Ronaldinho and chums might have a bit of thinking to do yet.

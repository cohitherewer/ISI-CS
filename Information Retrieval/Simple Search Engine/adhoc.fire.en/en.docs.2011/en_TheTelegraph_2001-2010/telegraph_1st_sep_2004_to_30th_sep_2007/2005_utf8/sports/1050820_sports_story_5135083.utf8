 RCTC syces cease work 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: RCTCs syces refused to take out horses for the morning workouts on Friday, demanding their long-pending payments of dearness allowance (DA). The DA was approved by the Calcutta Racehorse Owners Society (CROS) about eight months ago but is yet to be implemented. The syces have threatened to further intensify the stir if the DA is not paid out immediately. Next city races are on August 24.

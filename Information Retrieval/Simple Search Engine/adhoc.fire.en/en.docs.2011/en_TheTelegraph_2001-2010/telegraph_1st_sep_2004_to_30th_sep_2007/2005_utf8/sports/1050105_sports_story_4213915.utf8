London: Cricket fans have bought almost 20,000 tickets in the first few hours of sales for Monday?s fund-raising match to aid victims of the tsunami. 

The 50-over match between ICC XI and an Asia XI will be played at the 80,000-capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground. A second match will be played in Asia in either February or March. 

?To sell almost 20,000 tickets in half a day is a fantastic result and augurs well for creating a strong atmosphere at the fund-raising game on Monday,? International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed said in a statement. 

Proceeds from the match will go to World Vision. 

Meanwhile, more pledges were announced on Tuesday: 

 Pakistan cricket team have donated 25 percent 

of their match fees from the Sydney Test against Australia. 

?The players? donation will go to the relief fund set up by the president (Pervez Musharraf),? Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director Abbas Zaidi said on Tuesday, the third day of Pakistan?s third and final Test. 

Zaidi also said all board employees would donate one day?s salary towards the relief fund. ?We will also be organising a charity match between the Pakistan team and the Rest of Pakistan in February and proceeds from sponsorship, gate money etc would go to the fund,? Zaidi added. 

 In New Delhi, the All India Football 

Federation (AIFF) has decided to donate Rs 15 lakhs to the tsunami relief fund. 

This was announced Tuesday by AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. He said 

that he had written to Fifa president Sepp Blatter to organise a benefit match 

in Asia for the victims. According to Das Munshi, the Portuguese football association 

has expressed interest in playing a match or matches in Goa to raise funds. 

 German football team, Bayern Munich, 

will finance a rebuilding project in Sri Lanka. Bayern has decided ?to make 300,000 

euros (around $400,000) available for a project in Sri Lanka,? president Karl-Heinz 

Rummenigge said on the club?s website Tuesday. Bayern sporting director Uli Hoeness 

said the money would be used ?to build an orphanage or a school?. 

 The International Olympic Committee 

will donate $1 million to aid victims of the tsunami. The IOC made its announcement 

on its website.

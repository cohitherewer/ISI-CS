Charlotte: Vijai Singh clinched his third PGA Tour victory of the year after edging out Sergio Garcia and Jim Furyk in a playoff at the Wachovia Championship here on Sunday. 

Six shots off the lead at the start of the final round, the Fijian world No. 2 completed a stirring rally by getting up-and-down to save par at the fourth extra hole and edge out American Furyk, who found water from the tee. 

Spains Garcia had started the day six strokes clear of the field, but he was eliminated at the first extra hole when he bogeyed the par-four 18th. 

World No. 1 Woods tied for 11th at two under after closing with a 71. He had carded a 69 to finish in a tie for ninth, but was penalised two shots by rules officials who determined that he should not have moved a fence next to the 10th fairway, that was damaged when the gallery joined in to help. 

Indias Arjun Atwal fired his only sub-par round of the week to move up the ladder and finish joint 56th. 

Atwal seemed to be heading for a good final round, as he started with two birdies on the first and second and then added a third on seventh. 

At three-under after seventh hole, things looked bright for Atwal. Then he bogeyed the eighth but soon made up with a birdie on 10th. Thereafter he just managed a bogey on 13th and parred the rest for a two-under 70 and a total of five-over 293 with rounds of 75, 73, 75 and 70. 

Despite slightly better putting as he needed 28 for the round, Atwal continued to have problems off the tee, as he found only 36 per cent of the fairways. 

The tied 56th place gave him $13,260 and carried his total earnings to $ 636,508 for a 48th place on money list in the US tour. 

The Indian has made cuts in each of his six starts and finished in top five twice and in top 25 three times. Only Ernie Els has more money in six starts than Atwal. 

?In a playoff you only think of that one shot at a time,? Singh said. ?Youre not even worried about anything else thats going on, just one particular shot, and probably thats why its a little bit easier to go ahead and play it. Maybe I should do that all the time.? 

The victory was the 27th PGA Tour win of Singhs career and allowed the Fijian to join Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson as three time champions this season. 

?I just want to go out there and win golf tournaments. Ive done away with trying to be No.1,? added Singh. ?I mean, it seems like Ive got to win five times to get up there. I totally forgot about that. That does not cross my mind anymore. I just want to go out there and win golf tournaments.? 

The trio had completed the 72 holes on 12-under-par 276, Garcia closing with a 72 while Singh and Furyk both fired equal best-of-the-day 66s at Quail Hollow Club. 

It was a stunning final round collapse by the 25-year-old Spaniard who had been perched on top the leaderboard from the opening round, building his advantage to six strokes heading into Sunday. 

With Singh and Furyk charging, Garcia flinched as his lead slowly evaporated, already reduced to two shots as they made the turn. 

As Singh continued to apply pressure with four consecutive birdies from the 10th, Garcia finally cracked and the Fijian took the lead when the Spaniard bogeyed the 13th. 

Despite his troubles, Garcia was still in a position to take the win when he recovered to lead by a stroke with two holes remaining. 

However, a wayward tee shot on the par-three 17th found the water and resulted in another bogey. That was followed by a missed birdie putt on the last and Garcia headed to the playoff. 

?They say you learn more from your losses than from your wins, so I think I can take a lot of positive things out of this week and its going to help me to keep going,? Garcia said. ?Its been a great week, disappointing at the end, but thats it. 

?I played very well all week and I hit the ball pretty much exactly like I wanted every time. Coming down the stretch, its easy to not hit perfect shots, and unfortunately I hit a couple that cost me a little bit, but its one of those things.? 

American Chris DiMarco, one of five players to close with a 66, finished alone in fourth at eight under with compatriot Vaughn Taylor (67) and Paraguays Carlos Franco (66) a further two strokes back in a share of fifth.

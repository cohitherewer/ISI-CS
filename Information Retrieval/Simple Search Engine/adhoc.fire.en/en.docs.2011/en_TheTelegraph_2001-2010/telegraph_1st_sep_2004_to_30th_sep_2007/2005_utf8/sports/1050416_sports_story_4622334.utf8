The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Imran ?beats? Musharraf to India

 - No chance of face-off, but? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

New Delhi: Around 20 hours before Pakistan 

President Pervez Musharraf?s arrival in India, Saturday, top foe Imran Khan landed 

in Mumbai. The World Cup-winning captain is now a Member of the National Assembly. 

Imran, who last visited India in November, has come as a guest of STAR News. He is expected to be around for four-five days, but won?t come here for the sixth and final ODI on Sunday. 

Initially, Imran did support Musharraf, but became 

a vehement critic once (as he told The Telegraph) ?the corrupt began to 

call the shots.? Owing to his disenchantment, Imran even rejected an offer to 

be the Prime Minister. 

Currently, Imran is his party?s sole representative 

in Parliament, but is hopeful that the Tehrik-e-Insaaf will do ?much better? in 

the next elections. He got elected from native Mianwali in October 2002.

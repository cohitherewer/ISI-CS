 Thierry Henry helps Gunners storm Palace

 - Not a single Englishman in Wenger?s 16

There was not an English player in their squad, but Arsenal proved that on their day they are the most exciting team in England as the Premiership?s most potent attacking force overwhelmed Crystal Palace. The title may be destined for Chelsea, and Manchester United have had the better of Arsenal in recent years, but when they are in the mood, Arsene Wenger?s side are the Premiership?s great entertainers. 

Thierry Henry?s performance was special even by the standards of the French maestro, though credit to Palace who never allowed their heads to drop. Gunners welcomed back Kolo Toure after suspension, but Ashley Cole dropped out because of a fever. With Sol Campbell injured, it meant the Premiership champions had no British players in their 16-man squad. 

While Chelsea were the first to field an all non-British starting XI in the Premiership when they beat Southampton on Boxing Day 1999, they had Jon Harley and Jody Morris on the substitutes? bench. It is believed Arsenal?s entire foreign legion of 16 is a Premiership record. 

With Henry making his 200th Premiership appearance for the club, Arsenal were hoping to extend their unbeaten record in London derbies to 33 against Palace, who had won only once at Highbury in their history. However, the visitors came close to taking the lead after only 70 seconds when a loose clearance by Patrick Vieira fell to Dougie Freedman whose first-time shot was brilliantly parried by Jens Lehmann, who also blocked the follow-up from Andy Johnson. 

A minute later saviour Lehmann was almost the villain after a ?Roy Carroll moment? when a Gael Clichy back pass went under his foot, but the Germany goalkeeper recovered to clear the ball on the line. 

Palace were defending intelligently but were grateful when a superb 20-yard shot on the turn from Henry in the 20th minute was just off target. With Michael Hughes the anchor man in midfield and Aki Riihilahti and Tom Soares snapping away at Vieira and Edu, the home side were initially finding the visitors difficult to break down. 

But three goals in a devastating seven-minute spell left Palace reeling. An incisive passing movement saw Dennis Bergkamp give Arsenal the lead. Three minutes later goal-maker Reyes turned goalscorer ? Henry?s effort was blocked by Hall but Reyes? left-foot shot from 15 yards was unstoppable. Arsenal were rampant now and Henry?s shot was deflected over the crossbar by Mikele Leigertwood. The respite was short for Palace because from the corner Henry made it 3-0 with a rising shot. 

Nine minutes after the restart, Vieira ran the ball into the Palace net after an incisive pass by Henry split the visiting defence. Palace pulled a goal back in the 63rd minute when Vieira left out a leg to trip Andy Johnson, who scored Palace?s seventh penalty in nine attempts this season. It was Johnson?s 16th goal of 2004-05, making him Palace?s highest scorer in a Premiership season, beating the record of Chris Armstrong in 1992/93. 

With 12 minutes remaining Henry scored his second goal of the night after Bergkamp had beaten Danny Granville by the right-wing corner flag. When Henry received the ball Leigertwood did his best to stop him but was helpless as the France striker scored his 19th Premiership goal of the season, a stunning 20-yard strike with minimal back-lift.

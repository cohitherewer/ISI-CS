 Warne return eclipsed by Croft

London: Shane Warne returned to county cricket duty after his Ashes heartbreak only to find himself eclipsed by former England spinner Robert Croft. 

Croft took five wickets as relegated Glamorgan bowled out Hampshire for 350 at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff in the first division on Friday, following a washed out first day. 

Warne, who took 40 wickets in the series against England, scored 24 runs, while teammate Simon Katich added 50. Opener James Adams contributed 71 for Warnes team, while Dimitri Mascarenhas smashed 67 from 62 balls. 

Dan Cherrys second-ball dismissal was not the way Glamorgan wanted to begin their reply, and they reached the close on 13 for one, having survived two Warne overs. 

Neil Dexter made a half century on debut as Nottinghamshires surge towards the title was held up on Day III at Canterbury. 

Notts require a victory and 21 points to be confirmed as unassailable leaders.

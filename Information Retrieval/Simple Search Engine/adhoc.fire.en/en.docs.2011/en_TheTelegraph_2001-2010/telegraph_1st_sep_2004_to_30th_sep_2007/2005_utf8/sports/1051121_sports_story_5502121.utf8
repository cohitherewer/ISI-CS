Madrid: A virtuoso Ronaldinho double and a superb opportunist strike from Samuel Eto secured Barcelona a stunning 3-0 win over arch-rivals Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Saturday. 

Eto scored the opener against his former club when he snapped up the ball on the edge of the area, turned inside a gaggle of defenders and fired under goalkeeper Iker Casillas in the 15th minute. 

Ronaldinho, fancied to add the European Footballer of the Year to the World Player award he won last year, struck after a dazzling solo run on the hour and completed the rout with his second after a mesmerising piece of skill 12 minutes from time. 

Barcelonas 14th league victory at the Bernabeu put the champions top of the Primera Liga for the first time this season and made Frank Rijkaard the only Barcelona coach to lead the Catalans to two victories in Real Madrids stadium. 

Despite having Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane back from injury, Real rarely threatened the Barcelona back four and were jeered off the pitch by their own fans who had little choice but to marvel at the ease of their opponents victory. 

The live-wire Eto gave Real an early scare when he slid a low shot past the far post after beating the offside trap but they failed to heed the warning and five minutes later he put Barcelona into the lead. 

Snapping the ball off the feet of teammate Messi, after the Argentine had darted towards the edge of the area, Eto eased past three defenders with a stunning turn and drilled past a helpless Casillas. 

The Cameroon striker ran to the corner in front of the presidents box with his arm in the air pointing to the club crest on his shirt. 

Zidane looked well short of match fitness, Ronaldo and Robinho were starved of the ball and David Beckham had little influence on affairs. 

Barcelona stretched their lead 15 minutes into the second half when Ronaldinho waltzed through the Real defence. Picking the ball up some 40m out on the left, the Brazilian left Sergio Ramos sprawling with a quick shuffle of the feet, skipped past centre back Ivan Helguera and fired a perfectly placed shot past Casillas into the far corner. 

The Brazilian repeated the trick 18 minutes later when he bamboozled Ramos again, sped into the area and drilled home at the near post to wrap up a one-sided victory for the Catalans. 

Barcelona now have 25 points from 12 games, the same as Osasuna who were held to a goalless draw at Getafe, but lead the standings with their superior goal difference. 

Real are third with 21 points, while Villarreal moved into fourth place on 20 after drawing 0-0 at home with Real Zaragoza, taking their unbeaten league run to eight games. 

Meanwhile, Juventus crushed AS Roma 4-1 at the Olympic Stadium on Saturday with two goals from Frenchman David Trezeguet sending them five points clear at the top of Serie A, add reports from Milan. 

Champions Juventus ripped Roma apart with three goals in five minutes early in the second half.

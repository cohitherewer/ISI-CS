 Atwal tied 97th 

New Jersey: Arjun Atwals historic debut at the US PGA Championship was a roller-coaster ride as he scrambled to a four-over-par 74 at Baltusrol Golf Club. 

The first Indian to play in the years final major, Atwal had the worst of starts Thursday, going to four-over-par after three holes before battling back to bring his round to one-over through 12 holes with four birdies against one bogey. 

However, the Baltusrol beast caught up with Atwal again as he dropped four shots over a stretch of five closing holes and ended the day in tied 97th place. 

Six players, Stuart Appleby, Trevor Immelman, Ben Curtis, Phil Mickelson, Stephen Ames and Rory Sabbatini all share the first round lead on 67. 

Atwal opened bogey-bogey-double bogey to be four after three holes. But he recovered well with birdies on fourth and seventh, but then again dropped a shot on the ninth to be three-over 37 for the front nine. 

Excellent birdies on the tenth and 12th saw him claw his way back but then back-to-back bogeys on 13th and 14th and again on 16th and seventh set him back heavily. 

A closing birdie was a consolation as he ended the day at four-over 74 and in tied 97th place. He would need to play a good second round to make himself noticed. 

Last seasons Asian Tour No. 1 Thongchai Jaidee struggled to a 76, shooting only one birdie for his round. (PTI)

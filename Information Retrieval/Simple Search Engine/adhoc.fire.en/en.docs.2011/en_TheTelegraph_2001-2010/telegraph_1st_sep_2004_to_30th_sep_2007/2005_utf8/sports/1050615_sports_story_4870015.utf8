 Indian eves lose 1-2

Mumbai: Spirited India went down fighting 1-2 to Chinese Taipei in a group B match of the AFC womens championship qualifying round match at the My Dinh Stadium in Hanoi on Tuesday. 

The teams were locked 1-1 at half time before Chinese Taipei struck home the winner in the opening minute of the second half, according to information received here on Tuesday. 

Chinese Taipei took the lead in the 19th minute through Lan Mei-Fen but India hit back to draw level through Oinam Bem Devi in the 36th minute of the opening half. 

Lin Yu-Hui scored the match-deciding goal for Taipei in the 46th minute. 

The loss means India now have to await the result of the last group match between Chinese Taipei and Guam, whom they beat 10-0 in the pool opener to see whether they go through to the quarter finals. 

Even if Chinese Taipei suffer a shock defeat against the weak Guam, Indias superior goal difference following their thumping win over Guam on the opening day is expected to stand them in good stead. 

Two teams from each of the four groups qualify for the last eight stage. (PTI)

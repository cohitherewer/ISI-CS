 Taibu, Taylor put Zimbabwe on top 

 Tatenda Taibu plays a stroke as Bangladesh wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud looks on in Dhaka on Sunday 

Dhaka: Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu and Brendan Taylor hit impressive half-centuries under pressure to boost hopes of setting a stiff target for Bangladesh in the second and final Test on Sunday. 

Zimbabwe were wobbling at 37 for four following fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza?s three-wicket burst before reaching 203 for six in their second innings at stumps on the third day for an overall lead of 290. 

Taylor?s career-best 78 and Taibu?s (81 not out) combined in a 150-run stand, Zimbabwe?s best for the fifth wicket against Bangladesh in eight Tests. 

The previous highest was 125 between Sean Ervine and Taibu in Harare last year.

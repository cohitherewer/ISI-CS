 Raphaela for last days Invitation 

 HONKY DORY

 Raphaela is fancied to bag the Deutsche RWITC Ltd Invitational Trophy, the star event at the Pune races on Sunday, the concluding day of the season.

 The Razeen-Magical Moments daughter was unlucky to have missed out her Classic months owning to a training setback. Now in-form, the Sanjay Kolse-trainee may triumph in the hands of C.Alford.

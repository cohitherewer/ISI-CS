 John Wright to coach World XI 

 - SUPER SERIES 

New Delhi: Former Team India coach John Wright was on Monday named as the coach of the ICC World XI Test and ODI teams for the inaugural Super Series tournament against Australia in October. 

Wrights appointment, announced by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed at a press conference here, will mean the former New Zealand skipper will assist the worlds top players in upstaging world champions Australia in three one-day Internationals in Melbourne and a six-day Test match in Sydney. 

Wright said in a pre-recorded audio: I have enjoyed some tremendous battles with Australia over the years as a player and a coach. So this is another outstanding opportunity to pit my wits and skills against them, he said . 

The world teams are scheduled to be announced on Tuesday in Melbourne. 

Wrights appointment was recommended by Sunil Gavaskar, the chairman of selectors of the world teams, and endorsed by Speed. 

Gavaskar said in a written statement: John is a highly experienced and respected coach who knows what it is like to beat Australia, something which few other coaches have managed to do over the past decade. 

Speed, meanwhile, said a decision was yet to be taken on whether to make the Super Series an annual affair. (PTI)

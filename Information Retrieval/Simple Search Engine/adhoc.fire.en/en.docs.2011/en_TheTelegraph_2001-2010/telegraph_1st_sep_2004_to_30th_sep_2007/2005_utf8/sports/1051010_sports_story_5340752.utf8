 Chappell sees Sachin in mentors role 

 Greg Chappell 

Mohali: Greg Chappell said Sachin Tendulkar will have an additional role to play, that of a mentor, when he returns to the Indian team after a long injury lay-off. 

Sachin has an important role to play. I would like to see him more in the mentoring role, that is something you will see him do in the next few years, Chappell said here on the eve of the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy tournament. 

He has played at the top level of the game for 16 years, hopefully he can pass on that experience. He gets along well with the youngsters as well. 

The former Australian captain said Sachins presence always made a difference to the team and should the team manage to get the best out of him it would be for the better of Indian cricket and the individual batsman as well. 

He does make a lot of difference to the group. He is worldly respected, a talented individual. Hopefully, from his and Indian crickets point of view, this is the start of another successful run, the coach said. 

He still has the passion. He has been away, and if he had not had the desire, it would have been difficult. But he is keen, and the team is very happy that he is back. 

It is a matter of managing on a day-to-day basis. We have to be careful of not overdoing it...Because it is not just for the next few days but for the next few years. 

Chappell said he was looking forward to the experience of coaching the Indian team in a home series. 

We have a fair share of experience. My job is to get the team into proper frame of mind for the Sri Lanka and South Africa series. India have a very good home record, the 54-year-old Aussie said. 

Chappell, who watched the Irani Trophy as well in Delhi, said he was impressed with the commitment and attitude of the Railways team members. 

I was impressed with the organisational capabilities of the railways and the commitment and the attitude the players showed on the field. 

What was most encouraging to me was their attitude to cricket and each other. 

Chappell also said that resting some of the important players from minor events but added that he would not force any player to take a break. He said the rotational policy could be used to groom the youngsters and make them ready to step in when key positions become vacant. 

Chappell was of the opinion that the youngsters in the team were yet to reach a stage where they can directly replace the seniors. 

We are not looking at Sachin, hopefully he is there for a few more years. What is important is give the youngsters the responsibilities. 

Players like Yuvraj (Singh) and (Mohammed) Kaif and a couple of youngsters have been there for a while, and thats a positive thing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Eden too an option for PCB

 - CONTROVERSY OVER AHMEDABAD 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: On a day of bizarre developments ? top of this list being the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) volte-face on the reason for not wanting to play in Ahmedabad ? it?s learnt that Calcutta, too, has been listed as an alternative venue for one of the three Tests. 

There?s no disagreement over Mohali and Bangalore. 

?Our Calcutta-specific communication isn?t in writing ? verbally, though, we?ve indicated to the hosts that we?ll be happy to play either in Chennai or Calcutta,? informed a well-placed PCB source, when contacted by The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Lahore on Monday evening, he added: ?If necessary, the Calcutta-option is also going to be put in writing. That, after all, has already been done for Chennai.? 

Both Calcutta and Chennai have hosted Tests this season and, strictly by rotation, it will be Chennai?s turn ahead of Calcutta. 

Actually, given the intra-Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) politics, it?s to be seen whether Calcutta gets preferred in case of a shift. 

Meanwhile, one understands the Ahmedabad fiasco may not have occurred had the Justice (retd) Umesh Chandra Banerjee interim report on Godhra not been released just days before the BCCI announced the proposed venues. 

That announcement came on January 20. 

As a source put it: ?The riots in Ahmedabad and elsewhere (three years ago) returned to the front pages only after Justice Banerjee made public his report and politicians scrambled to take advantage? 

?It?s possible the PCB wouldn?t have made Ahmedabad such an issue had the report come at a later date? From the point of Indo-Pak cricket, then, Justice Banerjee didn?t quite get his timing right.? 

If a reminder is needed, Godhra was the spark which lit the fuse that ignited Narendra Modi?s state?

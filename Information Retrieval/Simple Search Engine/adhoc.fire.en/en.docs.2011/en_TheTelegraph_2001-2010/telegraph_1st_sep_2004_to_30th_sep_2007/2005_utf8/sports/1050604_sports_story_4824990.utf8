 Henin-Hardenne has edge in logic-defying final

Paris: Medical charts and ages, rankings and records would not mean much when Mary Pierce and Justine Henin-Hardenne clash in the French Open final on Saturday. 

They are players who defy logic and obvious number crunching, reminding fans that champions are more than the sum of their wins and losses, or backhands and forehands. 

Their low seedings never mattered on their marches through the draw to semi-final victories Thursday, nor did the formidable health problems they each overcame to get this far. 

Pierce and Henin-Hardenne all but danced on Centre Court in their latest triumphs over outclassed Russians ? Pierce breezing past Elena Likhovtseva 6-1, 6-1, after Henin-Hardenne ousted Nadia Petrova 6-2, 6-3. 

Pierces flat, deep groundstrokes kept Likhovtseva pinned behind the baseline, or left her frustrated when she made ventures to the net and got passed. Henin-Hardenne played with greater artistry, wearing down Petrova. 

On paper, it would be easy to discount Pierces chances to reclaim the French title she won in 2000, and came close to winning when she reached her only other final at Roland Garros 11 years ago. 

The years between have seen Pierce rise and fall ? and rise again ? as she has dealt with family dramas, coaching changes and injuries. None more serious than the back problems that led her to miss most of 2001 ? and consider retiring. 

Pierce has won only one Tour event, a minor one on grass in The Netherlands, since capturing the French, and came into this Grand Slam event seeded No. 21. 

At 30, she is the oldest French womens finalist since Martina Navratilova in 1987, and is bidding to become the oldest champion since Chris Evert, at 31, the year before that. 

Throw in the fact that Pierce has lost all three of her matches against Henin-Hardenne in straight sets ? on clay in Charleston, on grass at Wimbledon two years ago and on a hardcourt at the Olympics last summer ? and it would not seem she has much chance. 

The 10th-seeded Henin-Hardenne, the 2003 champion, has a Jordan-esque number going for her ? she turned 23 on Wednesday, she has won 23 straight matches, all on clay, and she is trying to win her 23rd title. Its my lucky number, she said. I hope it will keep going. 

Its a fantastic feeling, Pierce said, of the prospect of winning the trophy again.

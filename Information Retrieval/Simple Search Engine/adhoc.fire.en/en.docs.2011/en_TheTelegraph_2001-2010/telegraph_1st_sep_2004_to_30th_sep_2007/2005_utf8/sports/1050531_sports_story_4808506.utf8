 TV rights on agenda

Thiruvananthapuram: Forthcoming tours of Team India, television rights issue and merger of womens and mens boards would be taken up at the two-day working committee meeting of the BCCI, beginning at Kovalam here on Thursday, secretary S. K. Nair said Monday. 

The meeting of the working committee, being held here after a gap of 24 years, would also ratify the BCCI six-member committees decision to appoint Greg Chappell as the new Indian coach. Indias first tour under the new coach would be to Sri Lanka where they would take part in a tri-series with West Indies as the third team. 

The working committee would discuss Indias tour of Zimbabwe where it is proposed to play two Test matches and a three-nation tournament, also involving New Zealand. 

Sri Lankas request to play three Test matches and five ODIs in India in November-December, South Africas proposal to play five ODIs here in December and the Indian teams proposed tour of Pakistan in January-February to play three Tests and five ODIs would also be discussed at the meeting, he said. 

The BCCI would hold discussions on plans to award television rights to channels at the meeting, Nair said. 

Taking a cue from cricket associations in Australia and New Zealand, the ICC had proposed that the mens and womens cricket associations be merged, he said, adding that the issue would be taken up at the meeting. Issues relating to organisation and jurisdiction after the merger would be discussed, he said.

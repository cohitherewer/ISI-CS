 Scott 6 strokes ahead

Beijing on Saturday 

Beijing: Australia?s Adam Scott surged into a six-stroke lead at the Johnnie Walker Classic Saturday with the majority of players yet to complete the third round. 

The world No.10 was 19 under par with seven holes to play in his third round having tied the tournament record for the first 36 holes after a 66 in the morning. 

Scott was at 15-under 129 after the first two rounds to match the record set by Ernie Els in 2003. 

Scott?s 63 in the weather-hit first round was also a course record in Beijing. Fierce winds halted play on Thursday and have caused scheduling problems for organisers at Pine Valley. 

Sweden?s Henrik Stenson moved into a tie for second with American Gary Rusnak on 13 under after a flurry of six birdies in 12 holes during his third round. 

Players resume their third rounds Sunday morning before the final round later in the day.

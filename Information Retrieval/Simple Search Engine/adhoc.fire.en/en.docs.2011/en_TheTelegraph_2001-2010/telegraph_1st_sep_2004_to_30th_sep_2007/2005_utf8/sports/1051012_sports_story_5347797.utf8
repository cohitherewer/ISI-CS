 Precocious Rooney follows Owens path

 - My temperament has let me down a bit 

[+uc('HENRY WINTER 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]

A startling reminder of Wayne Rooneys still tender years arrived on Monday when he casually remarked that his childhood idol was Michael Owen, who is all of 25 years old. Rooney, who retains teenage status for another fortnight, partners Owen in Englands attack against Poland on Wednesday, having grown up imagining himself as Owen during kickabouts on Croxteths back streets. 

The first World Cup I watched was France 98 and that was Michaels first World Cup, Rooney said. He was a young lad and fantastic for England. I used to go out after that and pretend to be Michael. Now Im lucky enough to be playing with him. 

And heading towards the 2006 World Cup, which will be Owens third and Rooneys first. He cannot wait because he knows the quality of opposition who will be strutting their sophisticated stuff on the global stage. One star in particular stirs Rooneys imagination the most. 

Ronaldinho is the best football player in the world, Rooney said. Hes a great player. Hes strong, quick, good feet, scores and makes goals. Thats all you can ask for, really. Sometimes you watch Brazil and think, How are you going to stop them? 

The world champions swaggering menace stems from more than the twinkling feet of Ronaldinho. Brazil boast Adriano, Ronaldo, Robinho and Kaka. 

The forward players theyve got are frightening, Rooney agreed. Obviously, theyre a great team and have been like that for so long. Theyre going to be the team to beat, in my opinion. If we can beat them, then we can go far. 

To play in a World Cup is a dream come true. Im confident and excited. We have some great players. Were all confident of going there and winning it. 

Rooneys eyes light up when he talks about these ultimate proving fields. Everyone who goes to the World Cup wants to prove himself and Im no different, he continued. I hope I can be as a good as any player going to the World Cup. 

I love getting the ball, running at people and bringing other people into the game, Rooney added when asked about whether he preferred playing through the middle or cutting in from wide. I want to go out there and score goals and make goals. Im happy to do it anywhere. I played wider last season for Manchester United and scored 17 goals. I dont know what my favourite position is. Wherever the manager wants to play me, Ill play. 

Most football people agree that Rooney is best deployed through the middle. I like to play with confidence, believe in myself and I believe in the team as well, he said. The night before the game I try and vision myself playing and hoping the next day itll happen like that. 

His desire has been deepened by ultimate disappointment at Euro 2004. He was the star of the tournament until injury intervened in the quarter final against Portugal. I was gutted, said Rooney of that metatarsal break. But that makes me even more hungry to go to the World Cup and win it. 

Rooney tomorrow runs into Kim Milton Nielsen, the Danish official who dismissed him for two bookable offences, including sarcastic applause, during a Manchester United Champions League game at Villarreal last month. Hes a good referee and, looking back, he was probably right to send me off, Rooney said. 

He promised that he was trying to learn from his on-field explosions. In the past my temperament has let me down a couple of times. Im a young lad, I want to learn from that and I dont think there will be many problems in the future. Teams might try to target me at the World Cup, but Im experienced now and I want to prove that. 

If they try and wind me up maybe that will be good for the rest of the team. We have a lot of great players and if they have time and space theyll punish opponents. I go into each game I play wanting to win and with 110 per cent commitment, but sometimes, when it hasnt gone right, my temperament has let me down a bit. I want to put that right. 

Rooney played down the significance of his recent visit to Madrid to see David Beckham, whom he had sworn at in Belfast. David is my friend and I went out to see him play, he said. It was nothing to do with Northern Ireland. You go out on a pitch and things happen. You have disagreements, but thats it. Its forgotten about before you leave the stadium. 

The popularity of Wazza within the England camp is undeniable. During training at Carrington, Rooney constantly exchanged smiles, jokes and mock wrestles with everyone from Joe Cole to the coach, Sammy Lee. They love Rooney, even when he is flying into tackles during the possession drills. 

 He twice cut Joe Cole in two, and Jermaine Jenas was given similar treatment. Even little Shaun Wright-Phillips received a Rooney clattering. 

I was always brought up to train the way I play, smiled Rooney. Any player wants to win, whether its training or in a match.

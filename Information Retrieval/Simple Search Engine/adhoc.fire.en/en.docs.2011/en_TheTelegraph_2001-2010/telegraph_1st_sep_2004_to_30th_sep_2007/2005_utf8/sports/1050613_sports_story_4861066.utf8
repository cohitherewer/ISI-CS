The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Federer, Roddick complete hattricks

Halle: World No. 1 Roger Federer beat Australian Open champion Marat Safin 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4 to win his third consecutive Halle Open title on Sunday. 

In London, Andy Roddick also completed a hattrick of Stella Artois titles with a tight 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-4) win over Ivo Karlovic. The American joined John McEnroe and Lleyton Hewitt as the only players to win three titles in a row. 

Top seed Federer extended his three-year winning streak on grass to 29 matches but is still well short of Bjorn Borgs record of 41 over five years in from 1976 to 1980. 

Second seed Safin had beaten the Swiss in their last meeting, saving a match point in a five-set thriller in this years Australian Open semi-finals. They had never previously met on grass. 

Safin was upset by controversial line calls during the match but did well to take the second set tiebreak. 

Federer broke in the third game of the third set, however, and that was enough to give him victory. 

Bhupathi injured 

A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: A bad back forced Mahesh Bhupathi to concede the doubles semi-final of the Halle meet on Saturday. Bhupathi and his Aussie partner Todd Woodbridge lost the first set to Swiss pair Federer and Yves Allegro 5-7 when the top seeds decided to call it quits. 

I sprained my back in the first round? we got a walkover in the quarters, but the pain came back yesterday and I couldnt continue, Bhupathi told The Telegraph from Halle. 

He is still not sure how bad the injury is. 

The doctor will have a look after five days, only after then will I know whether Ill be able to play Wimbledon, Bhupathi said. 

Just 10 days ago, Leander Paes hurt his shoulder during the French Open mixed doubles final ? an injury which has ruled him out of the grasscourt Grand Slam which begins next Monday.

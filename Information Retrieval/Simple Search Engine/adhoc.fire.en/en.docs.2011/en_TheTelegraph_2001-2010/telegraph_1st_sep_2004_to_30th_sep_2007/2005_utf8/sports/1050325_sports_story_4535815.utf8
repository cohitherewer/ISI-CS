 Arjun Atwal takes early lead on Day I

 Arjun Atwal played near-perfect golf 

Jakarta: Former Asian number one Arjun Atwal, the only Indian on the US PGA Tour, provided early fireworks with an eight-under 62 to emerge joint leader with Northern Ireland?s Michael Hoey in the opening round of the $ 1 million Indonesian Open golf tournament here Thursday. 

Playing near-perfect golf, Atwal enjoyed a spectacular round that included eight birdies at the Cengkareng Golf Club. Hoey, the 2001 British amateur champion, stumbled with two early bogeys before fighting back with eight birdies and an eagle to end the day alongside Atwal. 

As the course is playing to a par 70 with two par fives reduced to par four challenges in the event co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour, the co-leaders effectively established a new course record. 

A stroke back were South African Chris Williams, who enjoyed a bogey-free 63, and England?s Matthew Cort. Five players, India?s Gaurav Ghei, Japan?s Eiji Mizoguchi, American Ron Won and the Australian duo of Andrew Buckle and Scott Barr, a recent runner-up at the Thailand Open, are all bunched at 64. 

Play was suspended for two hours due to a thunder storm which means that 57 players will return Friday morning to complete their first rounds. 

Atwal, who turned 32 last Sunday, has won two European Tour-sanctioned events in his career and his last success at the Carlsberg Malaysian Open two years ago came after an opening 62. 

?I hit some bad shots but didn?t let it get to me. The course is there for the taking, you can make some birdies out there,? said Atwal. 

?I started with a 62 in my last European win and the club manager who was at the Mines Resort in Malaysia is now running this club here. It could be a good sign.? 

The Indian, who has five career titles in Asia, survived a late scare on his last hole at the par five ninth, pushing his second shot into thick bushes but recovered sufficiently by two-putting from 60 feet to save par. 

?My cold is getting really bad and my ear blocked up on my back nine. I got really lucky on nine. Coming on my down swing, my ear kind of started to pop open and I couldn?t stop it. I hit the worst shot that I?ve hit for a long time but did well to get my five,? said Atwal. 

Meanwhile, another report ads from New Delhi that Japanese Tour golfer Jeev Milkha Singh will be joined by a host of Asian PGA Tour stars including Amandeep Johl and Harmeet Kahlon as a full-strength field gets set to vie for the Rs 50 lakh PSPB Open, the biggest ever prize money event on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour. 

The meet will be staged at the historic Delhi Golf Club from March 31 to April 3, with the pro-am teeing off proceedings the day before the start.

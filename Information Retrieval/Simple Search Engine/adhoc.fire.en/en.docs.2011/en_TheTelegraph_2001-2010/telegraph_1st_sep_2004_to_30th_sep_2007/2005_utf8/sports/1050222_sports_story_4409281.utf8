 Bowden denies favouring Aussies

 - NZ umpire terms his performance ?brilliant? 

 Bowden says he doesn?t have a problem with Vettori despite an outburst from the spinner Saturday 

Wellington: Umpire Billy Bowden has defended his performance in the last one-day International between New Zealand and Australia amid new allegations that contentious rulings tend to favour the No.1-ranked Australians. 

Bowden, who officiated in several matches on Pakistan?s tour, denied being swayed by the Australians and said his performance had been ?brilliant?. 

He also fended off criticism by former New Zealand captain Ken Rutherford that he was too often appointed to Australia?s matches and had become overly familiar with the Australian players. 

?I don?t appoint myself to umpiring Australia, that is the ICC,? he said. 

Bowden, who will also officiate in the second one-dayer Tuesday, was involved in an angry exchange with New Zealand spinner Daniel Vettori when he rejected one of several confident leg-before appeals during Australia?s innings. 

He had earlier refused an appeal for caught-behind against Australia?s Matthew Hayden when replays indicated the opening batsman had gloved a leg-side delivery from Kyle Mills to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. 

Hayden, then on 31, went on to make 71, the top score in Australia?s innings of 236 for seven. 

Australia dismissed New Zealand for 226 to win the first of five limited-overs matches by 10 runs. 

Bowden later declined an appeal against Hayden, who had played back and was hit on the back pad in front of middle stump, sparking an outburst from Vettori. 

Umpiring controversies are hogging all the headlines, mostly in matches involving Australia. Last month Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer suggested close calls averaged almost 6:1 against his team during their recent Australian tour. 

Former New Zealand opener Mark Richardson added to the debate, saying umpires are in awe of the Australian team and yield to pressure to give them favourable decisions. 

Bowden said he hadn?t seen replays of Saturday?s controversial decisions, but didn?t think it would effect his preparations for the next match. 

?I?ll have a look at the highlights,? he said. ?But whenever I umpire I do so to the best of my ability. As a batsman or an umpire a ball always has you number on it and if I made a mistake so be it.? 

Bowden said it was unlikely there would be any lingering ill-feeling with Vettori. ?I haven?t got a problem with Dan,? he told a New Zealand daily. ?I?ve umpired him a long time and I think we have mutual respect. 

?There won?t be a problem in Christchurch, in fact I hope he bowls at my end. I would be disappointed in myself if I couldn?t be professional and look any player in the eye the next day.?

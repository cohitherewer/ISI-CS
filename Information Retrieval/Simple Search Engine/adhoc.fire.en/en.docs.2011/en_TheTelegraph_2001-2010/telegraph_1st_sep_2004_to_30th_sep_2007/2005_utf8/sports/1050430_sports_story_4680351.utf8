 N. Korea, Japan in neutral venue

London: North Korea have been ordered to play their next World Cup qualifier against Japan at a neutral venue and behind closed doors after crowd trouble followed their defeat by Iran on March 30, Fifa said on Friday. 

Iran, meanwhile, have been ordered to play their next home game against North Korea on June 3 in a stadium with a maximum attendance of 50,000 spectators. The Iran association has also been fined 30,000 Swiss francs following incidents after the Iran-Japan match on March 26 when six fans were trampled to death. (REUTERS)

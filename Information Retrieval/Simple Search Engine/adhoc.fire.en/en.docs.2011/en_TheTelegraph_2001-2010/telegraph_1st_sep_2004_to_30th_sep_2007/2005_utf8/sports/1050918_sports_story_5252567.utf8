The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I can handle Nehas challenge: Sunitha

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sunitha wants to work on her singles ranking 

Calcutta: Sunitha Rao is back playing in India after a long while. In fact, the last time she played here was at the 2003 Hyderabad Open, where she lost in the second qualifying round. 

Injuries and a monetary controversy involving her father and the AITA over her playing for India have kept her away. 

Now shes back, and has made it to the main draw of the WTA Sunfeast Open after German Marlene Weingartner pulled out on Friday. 

She has an interesting first-round clash against another American of Indian origin, Neha Uberoi, a wild card entrant who is ranked 248 in the world. 

Asked how she rated herself against Neha, she said confidently: Im a much better and more experienced player than her, and I feel that I will be able to get past her. 

The pretty 20-year-old still lives in the US and plays under its banner, but said she could yet change sides and play for India, but that is not her immediate target. 

At a press conference held at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Saturday, she said her aim was to improve the current WTA ranking of 161. Her career-best was 152 in 2003. 

I am keen to play for India, sometime in the future, if possible. Right now, I am playing well and want to work on overall improvement, said Sunitha. 

She was confident of putting up a good show at the Tier III event, and holding her own, despite the media-buzz surrounding Sania Mirza. 

I know Sania will be the centre of attraction, she said. But Im happy to get whatever attention I get.

 Choi bags title, Kapur 12th

Seoul: Shiv Kapur made a decent recovery on the final day to finish tied 12th, as he ended the SK Telecom Open with a one-under 71 for a four-day total of two-under 286 here on Sunday. 

But the man taking away the honours was local hero, Choi Kyung-ju who cemented his position as Asias finest golfing export to the United States. 

He fired a last round 69 to total 13-under 275 and completed a five-stroke victory over Fred Couples and Andrew Buckle who tied for second at eight-under 280. 

For the two-time USPGA Tour winner, it was his third Asian Tour victory in his home country. Choi picked up a cheque for just under $100,000. 

Kapur, who two and a half years ago won the Asian Games gold in Busan, was undone by a third round 76. He shot 69-70-76-71 over four days. 

?As always, you feel like you played better than you scored. I was one-under through six holes and three-putted seven and three-putted eight and that derailed me. 

? I got it back with a birdie on nine and played solidly on the back nine, but did not make too many birdies,? said Kapur. 

?I am happy with the way I am playing, but on the greens I could have been two or three better and that would have made a world of difference. 

? I just have to learn how to save more shots out there. Overall, though, I will take a lot of positives into next week,? he said. 

?I have not been making those putts from 10 or 15 feet as much I would like. 

?I made a couple of good ones today, but if there is anything to take away this week it is that I am not putting as well as I need to,? Kapur said. 

Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand recorded a final-round 72 to finish another shot back in fourth at the Dong Lakes Golf Club, with Koreas Park Boo-won in outright fifth. 

The 2004 SK Telecom Open champion, Simon Yates, finished in a tie for sixth after a 69 on the last day gave him a four-round total of 283.

 Vidyut?s 123, Sriram hattrick oust Bengal

 - National one-dayers semis 

 Suresh Raina helped UP stun Mumbai 

Mumbai: A century by Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan and a five-wicket haul by S. Sriram, including a hattrick, helped Tamil Nadu beat Bengal by 27 runs and reach the final of the national one-day knockout tournament at the Brabourne Stadium on Tuesday. 

Sivaramakrishnan smashed 123 runs off just 120 balls hitting 13 fours and a six to enable his team make 277 in its allotted 50 overs before Sriram, despite failing with the bat, claimed a five-wicket haul with his left-arm spin as Tamil Nadu dismissed Bengal for 250 in 49.3 overs. 

After losing quick wickets, Tamil Nadu captain Hemang Badani joined Sivaramakrishnan in the middle and together they added 103 runs for the third wicket before Badani was caught by Paul off Rohan Gavaskar. Badani made 54 runs in 68 balls, including four boundaries. Paul claimed three wickets for Bengal. 

In another semi-final at the Wankhede, Suresh Raina?s unbeaten 72 followed by his four-wicket haul helped Uttar Pradesh beat Mumbai by four wickets and reach final. 

Chasing a victory target of 222 runs, UP began their innings on a positive note with the opening pair of Rohit Prakash and Praveen Kumar putting on 35 runs for the first wicket before Mumbai skipper Sairaj Bahutule had Praveen stumped by ?keeper Manish Bangera. 

Ultimately, UP managed to reach the target losing six wickets.

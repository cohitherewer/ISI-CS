The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bangla dismissed for 108

 Hoggard took four for 42 

London: England put Bangladeshs Test pretensions into sharp perspective on Thursday as the touring sides first appearance at Lords rapidly turned into a rout. 

The Bangladeshis, keen to convince, folded for 108 in 38.2 overs after being put in and then looked as anonymous in the field as England, seeking a 13th win in 17 Tests, rattled up 188 for one by the close of the first day. 

Marcus Trescothick was undefeated on 78, having hit 10 fours, while Andrew Strauss made 69 during a 148-run stand for the first wicket. Earlier, seamer Matthew Hoggard took four wickets for 42. 

Before the series, Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore had talked of taking the match into the final day, while home captain Michael Vaughan had warned of potential banana skins before the arrival of the Australians. 

After Thursday it will take a miracle to get this match much beyond the third day. For 40 minutes, it was possible to believe that Bangladeshs recent win over a weakened Zimbabwe, their only success in 36 Tests, might mean something. The tourists, however, having reached 31 without loss in cloudy conditions, suddenly got stage fright in front of a patchy, subdued crowd. 

Strike bowler Steve Harmison (two for 38) began the procession as Nafis Iqbal stepped away from a lifter and gave Trescothick catching practice at first slip. Captain Habibul Bashar then came and went, showing his players how not to do it with a criminal pull at Hoggard off his third ball which looped up high and straight to the wicketkeeper.

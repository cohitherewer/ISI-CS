 Former Kenya chief charged

Nairobi: Police charged the former chairman of the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) on Thursday with stealing $3.3 million from the organisation. 

Sharad Ghai pleaded not guilty to charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud the association of sponsorship money intended for a four-nation cricket tournament that was held in Kenya in 1999. 

Trial has been set for June 22, principal magistrate Wilbroda Juma said, releasing Ghai on a 2 million Kenyan shillings ($26,100) bail. 

On January 14, the government fired Ghai and his entire executive committee, accusing them of not accounting for sponsorship money and operating illegally for seven years. 

Four days later, Ghai obtained a temporary order rescinding the dismissals pending a legal appeal. 

On February 17, however, the government disbanded the association and replaced it with Cricket Kenya. (AP)

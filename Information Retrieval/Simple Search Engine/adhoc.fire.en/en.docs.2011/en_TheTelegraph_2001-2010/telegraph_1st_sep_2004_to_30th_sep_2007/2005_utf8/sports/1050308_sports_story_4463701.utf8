 Ljubicic destroys US

Carson (California): Croatia?s Ivan Ljubicic stunned Andy Roddick 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2 to give his country an unassailable 3-1 lead over the United States in their Davis Cup World Group first round tie on Sunday. 

Ljubicic has almost single-handedly dismantled the US squad with victory over world No. 3 Roddick, a three-set destruction of Andre Agassi on Friday and a four-set doubles triumph against the Bryan brothers with Mario Ancic on Saturday. 

In the dead singles rubber, Bob Bryan beat Roko Karanusic 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 for a final 3-2 margin of victory for the visitors. 

?This is going to be huge at home and around the world,? Ljubicic said. ?To beat Andre, the Bryans and Roddick in three days, it?s a great effort. ?When I came here, I was thinking I could win just one singles, to keep up the momentum and keep the confidence up. I did it all the way, so it?s amazing.? 

Despite playing in front of a raucous partisan crowd of more than 6,500, Ljubicic matched Roddick?s booming serve, dominated with his backhand and converted on the big points. 

In a titanic three-hour, 58 minute struggle, Ljubicic coolly fought off set points in the third set tiebreaker and maintained his composure in the latter stages despite double-faulting to lose the fourth set. It was Roddick?s failure to seize control of the third set tiebreaker that may have been his undoing. 

He failed to convert on three set points, the first where he netted an easy forehand, and the second and third where he watched Ljubicic hit two forehand winners. 

Roddick fought off three set points of his own, but at 11-11, the Croatian hit a service winner and then watched Roddick miss an inside out forehand to grab the set. ?There were many points that didn?t go our way,? he said. ?We didn?t go out and take them.? 

?I have proved I?m a good player, period,? Ljubicic said. ?I?m one of the best and that?s a great feeling.?

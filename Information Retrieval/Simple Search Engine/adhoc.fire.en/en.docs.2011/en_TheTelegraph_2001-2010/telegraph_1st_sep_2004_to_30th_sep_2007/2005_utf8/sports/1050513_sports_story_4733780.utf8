Hamburg: Roger Federer outclassed Tommy Robredo 6-2, 6-3 at the Hamburg Masters on Thursday to set up a quarter final showdown with Argentine Guillermo Coria, the player he beat in last years final. 

The Swiss world No. 1 sprayed winners all over the Rothenbaum centre court to record his sixth win in as many meetings with Spaniard Robredo and signal his return to peak form 11 days before the start of the French Open. 

Argentine Coria also produced some sublime shots in his 6-4, 6-3 win over Mario Ancic, earning applause even from his Croatian opponent when a devastating backhand down the line brought him victory. 

Ive got my confidence back, said the 10th seed, a loser to Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal in the finals of both the Monte Carlo and Rome Masters on clay this past month. 

Britains Tim Henman and Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero, meanwhile, suffered demoralising defeats. 

Fifth seed Henman, a semi-finalist at Roland Garros last year, lost 6-3, 4-6, 2-6 to Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela while 2003 French Open champion Ferrero went down 6-3, 2-6, 1-6 to Russian Nikolay Davydenko. 

Henman started well but the Britons game fell apart on the Rothenbaum centre court after a controversial line call at 4-4 in the second set. 

At break point down, Chela served a second service ace which Henman thought was out but the chair umpire ruled in the Argentines favour. The world No. 40 dominated after that and Henmans misery was summed up when he hit a smash out to lose the match. 

Henman, who made 46 unforced errors, later claimed the umpire had identified the wrong ball mark on the court and television replays suggested he was right. 

What can you do about that? said the 30-year-old Englishman, who has 11 days to recover before the start of the Paris Grand Slam. 

It was a critical time. On clay there is an art to picking up the marks and it seems he hasnt got it. 

Chelas victory avenged his defeat by Henman in the quarter finals of last years French Open and he will face either Belgian Christophe Rochus or fellow Argentine Gaston Gaudio, the French Open champion, in the last eight. 

Ferrero, who beat third seed Marat Safin in the second round, also lost his way after a good first set against Davydenko, the world No. 20. 

The Spaniard could not cope with the Russian on Court I as Davydenko set up a quarter final against either Sebastien Grosjean of France or Italys Filippo Volandri. 

Gifted French 18-year-old Richard Gasquet demolished Slovakias Domink Hrbaty 6-1, 6-2 to set up a quarter-final against Italian qualifier Andreas Seppi, who upset Czech Jiri Novak 6-3, 6-4.

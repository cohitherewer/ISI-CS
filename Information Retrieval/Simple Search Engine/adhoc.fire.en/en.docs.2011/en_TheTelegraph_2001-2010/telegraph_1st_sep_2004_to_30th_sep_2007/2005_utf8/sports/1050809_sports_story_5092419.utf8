 Mongias poor run continues

London: Dinesh Mongias poor run with the bat continued even though his side Leicestershire won the one-day match against Sussex by six wickets at Dove in the National Cricket League Division Two. 

 Sussex made 223 for eight in 45 overs with Mongia putting up a decent show with his left-arm slow bowling. He bowled nine overs and conceeded 34 runs. His teammate Otis Gibson however had better figures of four for 37. 

 But during the chase, Mongia failed with the bat making just one run off 10 balls before being dismissed by Pakistani spinner Mushtaq Ahmed. 

His dismissal, however, did not affect Lecestershires reply as riding on superb knocks from H.D Ackerman (114) and Darren Maddy (93), they achieved the target in the last ball of the innings. 

Last week, Mongia was out for a first-ball duck in the first innings before making 31 in the second in Leicestershires defeat against Lancashire in a Division Two County Championship match at Grace Road.

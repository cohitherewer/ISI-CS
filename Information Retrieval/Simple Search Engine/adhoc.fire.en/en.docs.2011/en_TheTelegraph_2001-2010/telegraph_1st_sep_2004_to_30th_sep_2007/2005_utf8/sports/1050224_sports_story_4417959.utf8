 Sandipan notches up first win

 - Surya Sekhar, Sasikiran suffer defeats 

 Sandipan Chanda beat Qatar GM Mohamad Al-Modiahki 

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Chinese GM Bu Xiangzhi in the penultimate round and fell out of contention for a decent finish in the Aeroflot International Open chess meet here on Wednesday. 

GM Sandipan Chanda scored his first victory in the event, accounting for Qatar?s GM Mohamad Al-Modiahki but the victory only took him to 3.5 points. Russian GM Andrei Kharlov took another step forward for his first major international title as he settled for a quick draw with compatriot Sergey Volkov to take his tally to 6.5 points. 

With just one round to go, Kharlov maintained his half a point lead over Volkov. Volkov was joined by Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in second spot after the latter scored a scintillating victory over Israeli Emil Sutovsky. 

As many as nine players including Sutovsky and top seed Etienne Bacrot of France are next in line with 5.5 points each in their bags while another pack of 10 players is half a point adrift. 

Despite his mediocre show, Sasikiran remains the best performing Indian in this strongest open event of the world with four points as national champion and GM Surya Shekhar Ganguly (3.5 points) bowed down to Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova in the penultimate round game. 

In the A-2 section, only IM S. Kidambi is within striking distance of finishing among prizes. The Chennai-based player did well to beat Alexander Obukhov of Russia and took his tally to five points out of a possible eight. This section is now led solely by Arsen Yegiazarian of Armenia with 6.5 points. 

GM Tejas Bakre played an uneventful draw with Marat Askarov of Russia. Eesha Karavade drew with Nikolay Konovalov while Tania Sachdev achieved the same result with Ekaterina Korbut. Parimarjan Negi went down to Arseny Alavkin. 

However, in the B group, IM Dinesh Kumar Sharma beat Egor Krivoborodov, also of Russia and ensured a finish amongst the prize winners. (PTI)

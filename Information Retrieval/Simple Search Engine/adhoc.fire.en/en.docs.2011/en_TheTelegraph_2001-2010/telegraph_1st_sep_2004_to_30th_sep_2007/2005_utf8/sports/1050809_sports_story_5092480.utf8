The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Big 3s formula for AIFF

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Player benefit has finally become a priority with the clubs of Calcutta. Representatives of the top three clubs of the city ? Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting ? met IFA secretary Subrata Dutta Monday and thrashed out a set of suggestions, making a formula, so to say, aimed at avoiding player injury, clubs starving of talent and any confrontation with the AIFF. 

These will be placed by the clubs representatives at the AIFF meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday. The clubs have also suggested that the AIFF declare the campers list in the under-19, under-23 and senior categories before the season kicks off. It also restricts the clubs to picking at most five players from each category. This is to distribute damage. 

THE PROPOSALS 

1. The Rovers and Durand Cup be staged every alternate year because the calendar is too cramped. [Domestic ? Oct. 3: IFA League ends. Oct. 20-Nov. 4: Fed Cup. Nov. 5-22: Santosh Trophy. Nov. 24-Dec. 4: IFA Shield. Dec. 5-Dec.18: Durand Cup. Dec. 20-30: Rovers Cup. Jan. 7 onwards: NFL. International ? Aug. 9-20: Trip to Fiji. Sept. 5-25: U-23 camp (for Asian Games and Olympic qualifiers). Nov. 10-Dec. 7: Camp for SAFF meet. Dec. 8-20: SAFF meet. Jan. 20-Feb. 7: Camp for Asian Cup qualifiers.] 

2. AIFF must select U-19, U-23 and senior probables pre-season (and pre-transfers). 

3. No club can sign up more than five from each category. 

4. Camp: The star players will join camp a week before scheduled close; for a goodwill trip, three days before close. 

5. All player-injuries during camp and national duty to be taken care of by AIFF. 

6. AIFF to take full responsibility for player on national duty (including camp), including transport, food and lodging etc. This will have to be for rejected players too.

 10th straight cut for Atwal

Silvis (USA): Arjun Atwal found his touch on his second nine as he made his 10th successive cut this year, by shooting a three-under 68 in the second round of the John Deere Classic at the TPC course here. 

Atwal is now four-under 138 for the tournament to be 44th. 

Daniel Chopra bogeyed his final hole to miss the cut by one. J. J. Lewis, the 1999 winner, moved into the lead with a six-under 65 for an aggregate of 13-under 129. Shigeki Maruyama shares second place with Hunter Mahan. 

Atwal started on the tenth and had two each of birdies and bogeys to turn at par, and was still outside the cut line. Then he eagled the par-5 second and found his touch with lovely putts for birdies on fifth and sixth, at which stage he was tied 18th. But he bogeyed his final hole, the ninth, and finished at three-under for the day and four-under for two rounds for tied 44th. (PTI)

 Chelsea, United win

 Cristiano Ronaldo after scoring United?s opening goal against Aston Villa 

London: Premier League leaders Chelsea earned a 3-0 home win over Portsmouth Saturday. Dutchman Arjen Robben set up the opener for Didier Drogba and claimed a well-taken second. Robben then won a free kick which Drogba struck past Pompey keeper Jamie Ashdown. 

Manchester United whipped Aston Villa 3-1. Cristiano Ronaldo?s clinical eighth-minute opener from Louis Saha?s pass was cancelled out by Gareth Barry after 53 minutes but quickfire goals by Saha and Paul Scholes ended Villa?s hopes of a rare point at Old Trafford. 

Fulham beat Birmingham City 2-1 on late goals. City went ahead six minutes after halftime through a Moritz Volz own goal. Andy Cole levelled from a penalty and Papa Bouba Diop sealed the win. 

Crystal Palace beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-0, Mikele Leigertwood, Danny Granville and Andy Johnson scoring. Charlton Athletic upset Everton 1-0 through a Matthew Holland goal. 

In other matches Norwich City drew up with 12 minutes remaining to tie 4-4 with Middlesbrough, and Liverpool slumped to Southampton 0-2. Charlton completed the double over Everton as Matt Hollands long-range effort was enough to win a scrappy Goodison Park clash. (Reuters)

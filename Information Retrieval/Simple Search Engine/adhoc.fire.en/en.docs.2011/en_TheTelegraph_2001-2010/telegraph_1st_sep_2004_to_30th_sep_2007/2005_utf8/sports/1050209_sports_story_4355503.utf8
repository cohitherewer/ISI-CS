 Kanpur ties shifted to Lucknow, Meerut

Mumbai: The BCCI has made some changes in the venues of the forthcoming Duleep Trophy to be held in central zone centres from February 15 to March 12. 

Two matches originally scheduled to be played at Kanpur?s Green Park have been shifted to Lucknow and Meerut by the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association as the former is slated to play host to a India versus Pakistan one-day International. 

This year?s Duleep Trophy assumes added importance as the first two rounds are to be played before the commencement of the Test series against Pakistan and all top players are expected to take part and tune up for the visitors. 

REVISED SCHEDULE 

February 15-18: North vs West (Lucknow); East vs Central (Bikaner). 

February 22-25: West vs South (Meerut); East vs Bangladesh (Nagpur). 

March 1-4: North vs South (Indore); Bangladesh vs Central (Jaipur). 

March 8-12: Final (Nagpur).

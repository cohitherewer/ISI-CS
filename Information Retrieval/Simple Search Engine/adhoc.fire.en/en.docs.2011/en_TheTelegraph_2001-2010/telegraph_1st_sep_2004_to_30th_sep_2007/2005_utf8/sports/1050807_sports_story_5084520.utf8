Appiano Gentile (Italy): Former World Player of the Year Luis Figo was presented by his new club Inter Milan on Saturday but could not resist a parting shot at his former Real Madrid coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo. 

The 32-year-old joined Inter from Real Madrid on Friday and said he was sad about the manner of his exit from the Spanish club. 

I had hoped to leave Real in another way. I wanted to salute the fans, given that in five years they always treated me really well, said the Portuguese winger, who left after falling out of favour with Luxemburgo. 

My conscience is clear though. I always behaved in the manner of a serious professional and I know that the fans wish me well. 

At Madrid, I met a person who didnt have faith in me but in sport and life that happens ? you meet people who have more or less belief in you, Figo added. 

I was disappointed with the man who was in charge of the team but it was a fantastic experience for me at Real and I wish them all the best. 

The former Barcelona player had been courted by Spanish side Valencia and European champions Liverpool, but his preference was to play in Italy. 

I think I was born to play in Italy, he said. My old president (Reals Florentino Perez) said I was born for Real but I think I was born to play here. 

I chose Inter because they are a great team, a really prestigious club and I am delighted to have been given the chance to make my debut in calcio. The objective is to win the Italian league as soon as possible and then to win a lot. 

I want to repay Inter with my quality and work and to give the fans the victory they have been expecting for some time, Figo added. 

Figo is expected to make his debut for Inter against Juventus in the Italian Super Cup on August 20.

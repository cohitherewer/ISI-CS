Nuerburgring: Narain Karthikeyan had a far from satisfactory performance in the practice sessions for the European Grand Prix, finishing 16th and 19th at the Nurburgring circuit here Saturday. 

In the days first practice, the Indian came ahead of his Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro, but slumped three places in the final session to finish behind the Portuguese. 

Nick Heidfeld of Williams took his first pole position in Formula One by setting the quickest time. Going out second last in blistering heat at his home track, Heidfeld clocked 1:30.081 to edge out McLarens Kimi Raikkonen by 0.116 seconds. 

Finn Raikkonen, who was on pole for the last three races and won two of them, will join the German on the front row for Sundays race with Heidfelds Australian teammate Mark Webber and Toyotas Jarno Trulli sharing the second row. 

Championship leader Fernando Alonso was sixth fastest for Renault and will be on row three with Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, who was fifth. 

World champion Michael Schumacher, the winner from pole position here last year, had another disappointing day and will be on the fifth row of the grid in 10th place. 

Qualifying for the seventh round of the 19-race championship was held over a single session because of widespread dissatisfaction with the format run in the previous six rounds, when there was a second session on the morning of the race. 

Karthikeyan had a timing of 1:33.731 as his fastest lap time in the first practice. In the second, he was 1:34.640 to end up just above the Minardi rookie. 

Meanwhile, Jordan Grand Prix have apologised for inadvertently violating the number limit on tyres for a third car during Fridays free practice sessions. 

The driver involved with the incident mentioned was Franck Montagny, previously test driver with Renault F1 team. 

Inadvertently during (Fridays) free practice sessions at Nurburgring, Jordan Grand Prix used more than the permitted number of tyres to car No. 39 driven by Franck Montagny, contrary to article 74 (a) of the sporting regulations, Jordan F1 said in its release. 

This was an honest mistake by the team and we realise now it was against the current regulations. No unfair advantage was sought and we believe none has been gained. 

We apologise to the FIA for this error in judgement, Jordans sporting director Trevor Carlin said in the statement. 

As penalty, Jordan will not be able to run a third car in testing at the next round of the championship. The FIA said they had suspended the teams right to run a third car in testing at the next round in which they participate after six sets of tyres were used on the car of test driver Franck Montagny, two more than permitted.

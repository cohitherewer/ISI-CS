 Holding Court canters home 

 TITAN BOY

 Trainer S. Padmanabhans Holding Court trounced a field of 10 to walk away with the 2,000m Kingfisher Derby Bangalore on Sunday. The winner not only proved that his narrow victory in the Colts Trial Stakes last month was no fluke, but also that the Royal Kingdom-Confiture son was capable of switching gears even when ridden off the pace. Jockey K.P. Appu partnered the horse to victory ? his first in the Bangalore Derby.

 A heavy downpour, only half-an-hour before the Derby event, was expected to go against the winner but the end-result was a pleasant surprise for the followers of the 4-1 shot.

 Appu had the colt settled in sixth place before coming with a late run, 300m from home, to sail past the long-time leader, Arturo. A nine-length victory over the course-favourite Flashing Star prompted Appu to punch the air repeatedly 75m from the winning-post. The jockeys act was in defiance of trainer S. Padmanabhans wishes as similar exuberance by Appu had nearly cost Holding Court the Colts Stakes.

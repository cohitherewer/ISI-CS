 Puerta in maiden semi-final

 - Canas loses a marathon Davydenko advances 

 Davydenko of Russia 

 after winning over Robredo on Wednesday

Paris: Mariano Puerta reached his first Grand Slam semi-final at the French Open on Wednesday, the Argentines return to top flight tennis complete following a nine-month anti-doping ban. 

The 26-year-old, who has hauled his ranking up from 440 to 37 after testing positive for the banned drug clenbuterol in 2003, outgunned compatriot Guillermo Canas 6-2, 3-6, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. 

I cant believe Ive reached the semi-finals, I really want to enjoy this moment, he said. 

Clenbuterol promotes muscle growth. An anti-doping tribunal determined last year that Puerta had been prescribed the drug by a doctor to treat an acute asthma attack. 

The player has always denied any wrongdoing and said on Wednesday his exile had made him stronger. 

When you go through a rough period, Im sure that it just makes you become stronger. Its hard for people to sink you. 

Everything I went through helps me feel calmer, and it has helped me mature and overcome difficult moments. 

Puerta will next face Russian Nikolay Davydenko in Fridays semi-final. The 12th seed beat Spaniard Tommy Robredo 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4. 

In the top half of the draw, world number one Roger Federer will face fourth seed Rafael Nadal. 

Both Puerta and Canas learned their trade on the slow clay courts of Buenos Aires, and a long, tough test of patience and stamina was expected. Neither player disappointed. 

Ninth seed Canas had been the favourite but on the Roland Garros centre court there was nothing to separate the former junior team mates. 

For five sets the energetic Canas scurried and chased, shovelling the ball back with his compact, economic strokes. 

Puerta, a runner-up in the boys singles here in 1995, threw everything at his opponent, his looping left-handed shots finding ever-more acute angles before Canas cracked for the last time. The 27-year-old ninth seed simply ran out of ideas. I think if I could go back and change something, Id change Puerta, he laughed. 

Paes-Martina in last 4 

Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova advanced to within two wins of a third Grand Slam mixed doubles crown on Wednesday. They made the semis after a close three-set win over Jared Palmer and Corina Morariu. 

The sixth-seeded Indo-American duo took over two hours to overcome the US pair 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-3 in the quarter finals, to set up a meeting with Australians Paul Hanley and Samantha Stosur. 

Paes and the 48-year-old Navratilova, who have always gelled well as a team ever since teaming up for the first time three years ago, had won their first two matches without dropping a set. Paes did fairly well in mens doubles, too, in Nenad Zimonjics company, the duo losing to Bryan twins Bob and Mikein the last-eight stage.

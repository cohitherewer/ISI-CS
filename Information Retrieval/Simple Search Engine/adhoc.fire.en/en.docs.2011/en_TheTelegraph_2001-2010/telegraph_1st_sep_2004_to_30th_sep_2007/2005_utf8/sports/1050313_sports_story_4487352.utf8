 Sanskara triumphs, Anzello fails 

 Star Racer

 Calcutta: Favourites found the going tough, on Saturday, thanks to the overnight intermittent rain that left the racetrack ?soft? and in a slippery condition.

 The prevailing conditions also demanded an extra bit from all winners, including Calorific who suffered a cardiac arrest after winning the Calcutta 2,800m St Leger. However, Sanskara reacted differently on the track while winning the 1,400m Acorn Stakes. The Bharath Singh-trainee was observed to be badly shifting out in the stretch run, though she beat Quintet by more than five lengths.

 The afternoon was ruled by trainer Sanjeev Charan who notched up a rich double through Frontier Flame and Magic Mantra. Sanjeev narrowly missed out on a treble when Moira took the measure of his Positive Thinker in the last race. D. Singh partnered Sanjeev?s winners.

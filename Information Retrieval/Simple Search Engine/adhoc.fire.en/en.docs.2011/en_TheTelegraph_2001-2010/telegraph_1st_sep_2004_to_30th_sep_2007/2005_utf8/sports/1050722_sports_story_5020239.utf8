 McGrath leads counter-attack

 - First Test - Harmison scalps 5, hits 3 as Aussies tumble for 190 on eventful 

 Day I

London: Glenn McGrath took five wickets including his 500th Test victim as England, chasing Australias paltry 190, closed the opening day of the first Ashes Test on 92 for seven on Thursday. 

Steve Harmison also took five wickets for the home side but McGrath then scythed through the English top-order, taking five for 21 from 13 overs on a Lords pitch appearing to offer some uneven bounce. 

McGrath took all his wickets for just two runs in a 31-ball burst after tea to reduce England to 21 for five. 

The 35-year-old had Marcus Trescothick (4) caught behind off the first ball after tea for his 500th victim and followed that up four balls later as Andrew Strauss (2) went in similar fashion. 

Soon it was 18 for three as McGrath flattened Michael Vaughans stumps. The England captain made three. 

Ian Bell edged it into his leg stump for six, while Andrew Flintoff was also bowled for a duck as the ball skittled through low. 

McGrath hopes to pass Courtney Walshs 519 Test wickets to become the most successful pace bowler in history. Only two other men, spinners Shane Warne (583) and Muttiah Muralitharan (539), have taken more Test wickets. 

Kevin Pietersen (29 batting) and Geraint Jones (30), however, battled back with a 58-run stand before Brett Lee took two late wickets, Ashley Giles treading on his wicket facing the final ball of the day. 

Australia have not lost to England at Lords for 71 years. 

Earlier, Harmison took five for 43 in 11.2 overs, hitting the top three batsmen and dismissing Ricky Ponting before cleaning up the tail. 

Ponting was also hit on the helmet by Harmison, suffering a gash to his cheek. 

Matthew Hayden went first, bowled by Matthew Hoggard for 12. Ponting followed for nine, squared up by Harmison and edging into the slips. 

Andrew Flintoff, with his fourth ball, made it 66 for three as Langer top-edged a pull. 

Simon Jones, with his first delivery, then induced a wild waft from Damien Martyn who edged behind. 

Australia reached lunch on 97 for five before Simon Katich, Adam Gilchrist and Warne fought back. 

Warne, who put on 49 in 47 balls for the seventh wicket with Katich, slogged 28 before he was bowled off his pad by Harmison. 

 Two balls later Katich top-edged behind as he attempted 

 to hook Harmison. Harmison ended the innings with four wickets 

 for seven runs in a 14-ball burst. (Reuters)

 Rajinder (Jr) appointed India coach

New Delhi: Three months after dumping Gerhard Rach, the first-ever foreign coach of the Indian hockey team, the IHF on Tuesday named Rajinder Singh (junior) coach for the Azlan Shah Cup meet to be held in Kuala Lumpur next month. 

According to an IHF source, Rajinder?s Kuala Lumpur performance will be assessed and then a decision taken whether to give him an extension. 

Rajinder, who has coached Punjab and Sind Bank (PSB) since its formation 17 years back, played for India in the 1982 Delhi Asian Games and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. PSB won the senior nationals in Hyderabad last month. 

Narinder Pal Singh was named assistant coach. He impressed all by leading Hyderabad Sultans to the title in the inaugural Premier Hockey League in Hyderabad earlier this year.

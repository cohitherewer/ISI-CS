 PCB to send Shabbir to Australia

Karachi: Pakistan cricket authorities are sending fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed to Australia to correct his action which was reported as suspect a third time in May. 

Ahmed has not bowled in a representative match since a series against the West Indies when he was reported by International Cricket Council (ICC) match officials during the first Test in Barbados in May. 

We have decided to send him to Australia to work with experts. We will decide on the dates soon, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Abbas Zaidi said. 

Coach Bob Woolmer has worked on his action and there is improvement but before seeking final clearance for his action from the ICC he will go to Australia, Zaidi said. 

Pakistan wants to get the 29-year-olds bowling action cleared before a home series against England in November-December. 

Shabbir has taken 46 Test and 33 one-day International wickets.

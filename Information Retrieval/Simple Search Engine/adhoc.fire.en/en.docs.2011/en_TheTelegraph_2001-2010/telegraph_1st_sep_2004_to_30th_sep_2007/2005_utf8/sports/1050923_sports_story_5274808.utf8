The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Daylong drama spills over into night

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Calcutta: Uncertainty, accusations, counter-claims and adjournment ? there was no shortage of drama at the BCCI annual general meeting on Thursday. 

The Telegraph provides a detailed account of what each of the principal characters had to say on the daylong drama: 

Jagmohan Dalmiya: I cannot say what will happen now, but according to me, at least another seven days should be given before reconvening Thursdays adjourned meeting. In cases like these concerning a local association, the meeting can be reconvened on a 24-hour notice. Since it is an all-India body, it will require 7-10 days. 

Now it is up to the observers to decide how to go about it. We will go by what the honourable court says.. 

Ranbir Singh Mahendra: I was astonished when somebody present at the meeting started shouting, claiming to be from Bihar. But Bihar has no legal affiliation in BCCI, it is Jharkhand which is an affiliate of the Board. Lalit Modi joined the fray screaming at the chair, Raj Singh started patting him. I said he has no business in the meeting. Despite that, he refused to leave. Claims and counter-claims followed, I thought it fair to adjourn the meeting sine die. 

Raj Singh Dungarpur: Mr Dalmiya has been manoeuvring for many years and now the time has come for him to step down. We are sure of our victory in this AGM. Whoever comes to power should think of the development of the game in the country and nothing else. They have taken cricket to the court and now the court will decide the Boards fate. It is enough proof that Dalmiya has some interest in the running of the board, otherwise he would have accepted the defeat. 

Farooq Abdullah: The drama is very unfortunate since the body has only 30 members? Its a tragedy. This wouldnt have happened had the compromise formula been accepted, which was Mahendra getting one more term and Pawar taking charge for the next three years? So, this shows who is eager to hold onto power. Whatever has to happen must happen now. We want a sensible solution and good responsible body. 

Inderjit Singh Bindra: The meeting has not been adjourned. How can they do this, when a meeting has not been convened without the consent of the members? Meeting has not been called to order. None signed the register. If the president, who is the chairman, is not present, one of the senior vice-presidents will take charge. If even he is unavailable, any of the member will preside provided the quorum. The meeting has to continue, so long the quorum is there.

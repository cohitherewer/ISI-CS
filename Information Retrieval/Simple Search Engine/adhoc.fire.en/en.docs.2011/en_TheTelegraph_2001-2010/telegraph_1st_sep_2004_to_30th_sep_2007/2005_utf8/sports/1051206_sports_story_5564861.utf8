Madrid: A 2-0 victory by Barcelona at Villarreal, their seventh consecutive league win, moved the champions back to the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday. The Catalans have 31 points, the same as Osasuna who beat Malaga 2-1, but are first on goal difference. 

Both of Barcelonas goals were a touch lucky with the first, on 23 minutes, an own goal by Villarreal defender Juan Manuel Pena after keeper Sebastian Viera parried Ronaldinhos free kick against him and into the net. 

Decos shot in the 63rd minute deflected off Penas shoulder to fool Viera. It was Villarreals first defeat in 10 league outings. 

Barcelona had Mexico defender Rafael Marquez sent off two minutes from time. The visitors did not appear to miss injured midfielder Xavi or coach Frank Rijkaard who was absent with illness. 

Javier Aguirres Osasuna continue to defy the odds and took the lead against Malaga when Cameroon striker Pierre Webo scored with a well-taken solo effort in the 23rd minute. 

Malagas Paco Esteban sprang the offside trap and squared for Nacho to equalise in the 37th minute, before visiting midfielder Valdo sealed the win with a header four minutes before the break. 

Third-placed Celta Vigo have 26 points after sending Real Betis to the foot of the table with a 2-1 home victory on Saturday, when Real Madrid scraped a 1-0 win over Getafe in the Bernabeu to go fourth on 25 points. 

Reals goal came from the boot of Brazil striker Ronaldo, and they survived the sending off of England captain David Beckham, early in the second half. 

An improving Valencia moved up to 25 points, the same as Real, but go fifth on goal difference. 

Valencias early dominance saw them take the lead through midfielder Miguel Angel Angulo after 15 minutes and Spain striker David Villa added a typical poachers strike two minutes before the break. 

Argentine playmaker Pablo Aimar scored the third in the 61st minute after Villa had sped clear and laid the ball off. 

Espanyol pulled back a goal through Ferran Corominas two minutes later but not even the dismissal of Valencias David Albelda 13 minutes from time was enough to put the home side back in contention. Villarreal are sixth while Deportivo Coruna moved up to seventh after beating nine-man Sevilla 2-0. All three sides have 23 points. 

Meanwhile, Juventus opened up an eight-point lead at the top of Serie A after Mauro Camoranesi struck an 88th-minute winner in a 2-1 victory at Fiorentina on Sunday, add reports from Milan. 

Champions Juventus have 39 points with AC Milan, who lost 1-2 at Chievo Verona on Saturday, on 31 points and Fiorentina and Inter Milan level on 29 points. 

Udinese suffered a 0-2 defeat at home to fifth-placed Livorno who continued their excellent campaign.

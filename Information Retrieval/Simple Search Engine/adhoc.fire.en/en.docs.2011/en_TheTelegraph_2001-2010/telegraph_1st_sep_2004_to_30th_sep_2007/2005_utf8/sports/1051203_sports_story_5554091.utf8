The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill have to cut out the high-risk shots

 - First-day washout helps Mahendra Singh Dhoni catch up on sleep 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Chennai: Cyclone Baaz may delay Mahendra Singh Dhonis Test debut even more, but our newest wicketkeeper isnt complaining. After all the travelling (and 12 ODIs) in a little over a month, any break is welcome. 

Of course, one would like to quickly become a Test player, but one cant do anything about the weather... No play on the first day has given some time to catch up on sleep... In fact, after yesterdays (Thursdays) workout, Id only got up for our team meeting and dinner, Dhoni told The Telegraph. 

A tight ODI schedule does place a heavy demand on those who have two roles to play. 

The delay, however, is also helping Dhoni mentally prepare for the challenges. Frankly, as the ODIs ended as recently as Monday, I didnt get the time to think too much about Test cricket... Im getting it now, he said during a chat at the Taj Coromandel. 

Dhoni didnt reveal whether hed got up earlier than usual, on Friday, but did say the first thing he did was to draw the curtains and see if the sun was out. It wasnt. 

Not that its a worry, but Dhoni is aware that except the workouts here, he hasnt kept to the red ball for months: Unlike the white one (used in ODIs), the red ball spins more and Ive got to keep to two outstanding spinners (Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh)... Im sure Ill get used to it quickly... 

Chief selector Kiran More, who wore the big gloves for India from the mid-1980s till 1993, has been helping him. 

Asked whether his approach to batting would be different in crickets traditional form, Dhoni replied: To the extent that Im going to get choosy about the balls to hit... Ill have to cut out the high-risk shots... Of course, Im going to remain positive. 

Normally, the family of a Test debutant would like to be at hand to savour a terrific moment, but Dhoni discourages anybody from turning up at his matches and, so, nobody dared suggest he/she would be at the Chepauk. 

I feel Ill be under more pressure if a near or dear one comes to specifically watch me... The family, therefore, watches the telecasts in Ranchi... They can have me when Im home, he explained. 

Dhoni, well, is different.

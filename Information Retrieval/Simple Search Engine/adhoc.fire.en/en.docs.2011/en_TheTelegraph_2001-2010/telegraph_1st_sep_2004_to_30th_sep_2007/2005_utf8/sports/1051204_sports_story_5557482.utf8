 Lee blows away NZ

Wellington: Brett Lee produced a fast bowling spell bristling with pure hostility to lead Australia to a 147-run victory over New Zealand in the first Chappell-Hadlee Trophy one-day International in Auckland on Saturday. 

Chasing 253 for victory after Australia made 252 for eight, New Zealands chase virtually ended inside the first 12 overs. Lee bullied the top order by consistently bowling at speeds exceeding 150 kph in an opening six-over spell in which he took three wickets for five runs with four maidens. 

Lee was assisted by left-arm swing bowler Nathan Bracken, whose nagging line and length produced two early wickets.

 Im king of sprints, declares Gatlin

 - US take first four places in 200m 

Helsinki: A wave of red, white and blue surged off the bend through driving rain on Thursday in an unforgettable vignette which may become the lasting image of the Helsinki World Championships. 

And Justin Gatlin of the United States added the mens 200 metres title to his 100m crown at the meet (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

The 23-year-old Olympic 100m champion timed 20.04 seconds to lead a United States clean sweep as Wallace Spearmon took silver (20.20) and defending champion John Capel the bronze as he ran a seasons personal best in 20.31. Another American Tyson Gay was fourth. 

Im here to make history. It was a powerful race and a great victory for us (the Americans). I want to show the world that I am champion! said Gatlin. 

I was a bit scared coming off the bend because I didnt know how the other guys were doing but I put my technique together and ran a fast race. 

Double gold means Im the king of the sprints. It shows Im the best sprinter around. Im in shock right now. 

Two down and one to go, added the champion who now wants a third gold in the relay and emulate compatriot Maurice Greenes feat in the 1999 championships. 

For the first time in a major competition four athletes from the same country took the first four places. 

Weve never quite seen anything like that, said Capel, the defending champion. All the red, white and blue coming around the corner like that. All in a straight line, all in stride, all in unison. 

Capel secured an automatic place at the championships as the 2003 Paris gold medallist, allowing the United States to field four runners in the final. 

A maximum of three is allowed at the Olympic Games. Its an honour to be part of it, said Gatlin, who completed his eighth race in six days including victory in Sundays 100 final. 

These guys have come out very strong and they ran very fast. We have made our mark in history. Tyson is going to come back very strong. Tyson is a respectable guy and a great runner. 

Watching these guys at the trials last year ? they were young but at the same time they are going to come out fast and thats what they did this year. 

They deserve everything they have dome this year and even more. 

Spearmon admitted he had given up all hope of winning once he saw the way Gatlin was running. 

This was a typically fantastic race, said the 20-year-old. When I saw Justin to my right I knew I was only competing for second place but I am happy with my medal because this is my first major championships.

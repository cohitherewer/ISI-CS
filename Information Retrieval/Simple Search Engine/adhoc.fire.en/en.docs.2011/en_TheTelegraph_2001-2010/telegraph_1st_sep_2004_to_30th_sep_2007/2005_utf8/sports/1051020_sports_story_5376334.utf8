Madrid: Gaston Gaudios miserable run of form continued after he became the first seed to tumble out of the Madrid Masters following a 6-7, 2-6 second-round defeat by Jose Acasuso on Wednesday. 

This was Gaudios fifth loss on the trot. 

Acasuso won the all-Argentine duel over the seventh seed to earn a third round match against Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic, who edged out British No. 1 Tim Henman 6-4, 1-6, 6-3. Fourth seed Guillermo Coria stayed alive with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Christophe Rochus and will meet Chiles Fernando Gonzalez. 

Top seed and world No. 2 Rafael Nadal confirmed he will be fit to play a second-round match against Romanias Victor Hanescu later after a scan showed he was recovering from the tendinitis problems in his knees. 

Argentinas Coria, who has reached two Masters Series finals this year before losing both to Nadal, made an authoritative start on centre court by breaking his Rochus in the second game. 

Both players struggled on their serve in the second set, exchanging three breaks apiece in the first eight games, before former French Open runner-up Coria broke through in the ninth and then served out for the match. 

Ninth seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden disposed of Juan Ignacio Chela 7-6, 6-3 and meets another Argentine David Nalbandian in his next match. 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia and Montenegro advanced to the second round of the Madrid Masters with a hard-fought win over the American duo Taylor Dent and Robby Ginepri. 

The 6-1, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4) victory at the eighth Masters Series event of the year boosted their chances of qualifying for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai. 

The pair breezed through the first set with the loss of only one game but Dent and Ginepri came roaring back to take the second with an identical margin to push the encounter at the Madrid Arena into the decider. 

The third set was closely contested and went to the tie-breaker where Paes and Zimonjic kept their cool to edge it 7-4, according to information received here. 

Dent and Ginepri were filling in as alternates after Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez withdrew. Nadal, the world No. 2, is suffering from a knee injury. 

The other Indian in the draw, Mahesh Bhupathi teams up with Martin Damm of the Czech Republic to take on Bob and Mike Bryan in the first round. If the Indo-Czech pair wins, they will meet Paes and Zimonjic in the next round. (Agencies)

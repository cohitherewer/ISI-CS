The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB struggling in alien land 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: It is not only Nebitchi FC that East Bengal have to counter with in their AFC Cup away match Wednesday, there are also the alien weather and inhospitable conditions worsening the situation for the visitors. 

The red-golds? journey to Turkmenistan has been riddled with difficulty. According to a club official, it?s extremely cold out there and the rain is a further cause of worry. 

Subhas Bhowmick?s boys are on the backfoot following their barren draw with Bangladesh side Muktijoddha Sansad at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

The ground is rather rough. The team had difficulty in training, the official informed. 

Meanwhile, following a lack of co-operation from the Turkmenistan football federation, East Bengal are planning to write a letter to the AFC informing it about the situation.

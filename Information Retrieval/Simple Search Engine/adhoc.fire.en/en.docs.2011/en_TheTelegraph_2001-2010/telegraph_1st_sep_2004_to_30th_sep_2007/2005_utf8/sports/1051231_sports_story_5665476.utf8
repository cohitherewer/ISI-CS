 Hari finishes tied 2nd

 Harikrishna drew with Ponomariov in final round 

Pamplona: Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna expectedly settled for a quick draw with former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in the eighth and final round game to finish tied second in the 15th Ciudad De Pamplona International Chess Tournament here. 

Harikrishna, who ended the event with 4.5 points, tied with Grandmaster Ivan Cheparinov who defeated GM Izoria Zviad of Georgia in the lone decisive game in the final round. 

However, Harikrishnas better tie-break ensured that the Indian finish second. 

While Ponomariov, having done the hard work in the first seven rounds, was content with the draw in his last game, which was enough for him to still emerge clear first with five points out of a possible eight. 

The fourth place went to Sergei Tiviakov of Holland who scored four points. In the last round, Tiviakov drew with Laurent Fressinet of France, who finished fifth. 

Zviad followed on sixth with three points after losing the last round and Dutchman Jan Timman was seventh on two points, just half a point ahead of the bottom placed Oscar De La Riva Aguado of Andorra. 

Harikrishna had little to worry about in the last round game despite playing black against the strongest player of the event. 

Overall the event well for me, there were two games ? against Timman in round one and the penultimate round game against Tiviakov wherein I was better but could not convert, Harikrishna said. 

I am gaining around seven Elo rating points from here which is good as this was quite a strong field, he added.

 Inauspicious start by Schumacher

Melbourne: Michael Schumacher made an inauspicious start to the defence of his world championship at the Australian GP on Friday. 

The German was forced to retire from the season?s first official practice session because of an electrical fault and could only manage the fourth fastest time in the second session. 

His best effort of one minute 26.081 seconds was almost two seconds outside the lap record he set last year, and seven-tenths of a second behind McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa. 

Although Friday?s practice session does not count towards qualifying and this year?s times were generally slower because of new regulations, Schumacher?s performance may be the first sign that Ferrari will not have everything their way this year. 

The Italian manufacturer won 15 of the 18 races last year with Schumacher taking the chequered flag a record 13 times on the way to an unprecedented seventh world title. 

The German is less confident about his chances of winning in Australia this year after arriving with last year?s car and troubles with Ferrari?s winter testing but still declared himself satisfied with Friday?s performance. 

?I am quite happy with the first day. We nearly completed our full programme although I had a small electrical problem in the morning which meant I had to pit earlier than expected.? 

Teammate Rubens Barrichello was also off the pace, clocking the 12th fastest time in the first practice session before improving to ninth.

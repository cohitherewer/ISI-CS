London: Hernan Crespo struck in the 74th minute to give Chelsea a 3-2 win over Fulham on Monday that maintained their 100 per cent home record in the Premier League. 

Leaders Chelsea stay nine points clear of Manchester United, who crushed West Bromwich Albion 3-0 at home, and 15 in front of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur who both notched up 2-0 home victories. 

William Gallas and midfielder Frank Lampard put Chelsea ahead, but Fulham came back with a strike from Brian McBride before the half hour and a 56th-minute penalty converted by Heidar Helguson. 

Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand ? who headed his second goal for United ? and Ruud van Nistelrooy scored at Old Trafford. 

At Anfield, Michael Owen had an unhappy return to his former club with Newcastle United, who went down to first half goals and had midfielder Lee Bowyer sent off for an ugly tackle on Xabi Alonso. 

Steven Gerrard struck after a quarter of an hour, and two minutes before the interval Peter Crouchs shot came back off the post but went in after hitting prostrate keeper Shay Given on the back of the head. 

Arsenal ended a run of three league defeats in which they had not scored by winning 1-0 at Charlton Athletic to climb to seventh, 20 points adrift of Chelsea and two behind Bolton Wanderers, held 0-0 by bottom team Sunderland, and Wigan Athletic, who edged a thriller with Manchester City 4-3. 

Jose Antonio Reyes scored just before the hour to end the drought with his second league goal of the season, a shot inside the near post after goalkeeper Thomas Myhre had parried Thierry Henrys effort from the right. 

Charlton were down to 10 men for the last 18 minutes after midfielder Danny Murphy was sent off for dissent. 

Spurs beat 10-man Birmingham City with a Robbie Keane penalty and Jermain Defoes injury-time strike. Citys Muzzy Izzet was sent off just past the hour.

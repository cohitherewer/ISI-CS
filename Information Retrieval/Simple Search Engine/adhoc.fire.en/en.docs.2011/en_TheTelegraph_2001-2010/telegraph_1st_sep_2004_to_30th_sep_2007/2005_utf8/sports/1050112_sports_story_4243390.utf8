 Steve Waugh for biennial charities

Sydney: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh believes cricket could make a massive difference to millions of starving people through charity matches held every two years. 

?I think it?s a great opportunity for the ICC to be a leader in this regard,? Waugh told the Melbourne Herald Sun. Waugh said he hoped to discuss his proposal with ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. 

?There are a lot of causes out there. You look at South Africa, there are people starving there. Somalia, all these sort of places. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tight security for Bagan polls today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza is in town for the $170,000 WTA meet with a posse of securitypersons in tow. Come Sunday, the Mohun Bagan elections could be vying for attention as far as security arrangements go. 

Elections havent been held in the club for almost a decade and a half, so interest is not at a premium. And with court-appointed special officers being in charge of Sundays proceedings at the Town Hall, both club factions are confident of a fair poll. 

No stone is being left unturned to ensure that only genuine club members cast their votes, from 9 am. A 400-strong police force, under the supervision of two DCs, will be on duty. There would be full-proof checking of identity at two or three points. 

The total voter strength is about 6300, of which officials expect about 4500 to turn up. 

Balaram Chowdhury, the assistant general secretary who has been overseeing football matters ever since court-appointed special officers took charge of club affairs, is banking on his role in bailing the team out of a very dismal period.We are confident of getting majority. Well bring back the golden days of the club once we get the mandate, Chowdhury said. 

Sounding equally confident on election-eve was general secretary Anjan Mitra. We pressed for elections as we were sure of the numbers. We will surely win, he announced.

 A farce of a race day 

 STAR RACER

 Stands were empty and only a few die-hards crowded around the RCTC paddocks last Friday. Regular punters called the days six-event programme a farce and wisely stayed away. 

 Bookmakers, too, cried foul, because there was no way for them to conduct the business in a race card that promised nothing and they failed to recover even part of the hefty trading fee they were made to shell out on the day. 

 The state government, too, had to do without the normal amount of money that it collects by way of taxes. And it was all because of poor fields ? the entire card comprising 28 horses.

 If it was only a matter of collecting the stake money, it was an exciting day for three people ? trainer Vijay Singh, jockey C. Alford and owner Deepak Khaitan. They had notched up a treble, including the two trophy events ? the 1,400m Hilliard Cup and the Legal Steps Cup over 1,200 metres.

 RCTCs plight with poor fields may have much to do with the stern action against owner MAM Ramaswamys jockeys on the opening day of the season. It could be his way of protesting the ban on three of his jockeys who really deserved to be fined. The decision to suspend them was stiff, considering the minor nature of their crime ? riding misjudged races.

 The racing baron, who owns nearly half of the Hastings stables total strength, had just three runners in last Fridays race card. Therefore, it was horseracing without punters involvement as odds offered on four of the six winners on the day were prohibitive. 

 Even the other two winners were favourites and they may not have helped trainer Richard Alfords cause ? he had waited for nearly a year to bring Arrayal and Serengetti to a striking mark on handicap.

 The victory of Serengetti brought about some more discomfort for the stiping brigade. Serengettis jockey, Rutherford Alford, was handed a four-day suspension and a fine of Rs 5,000, for riding the horse into the ground.on the last day of the monsoon season. 

 Ridden in similar manner the horse triumphed handsomely in the hands of apprentice Shane Domingo, who was also associated with the well-judged victory of Arrayal on this day.

 Nevertheless, barring Romantic Liaison, Vijays other two winners ? Serrafina and Magical Romance ? were, perhaps, overrated by the bookies. With better assistance in the saddle ? from Jugnu Gurang Exclusive Affair and Amandeep Singh on Wild Flowers ? hot favourites could have been grounded in their respective events.

 West Indies agree to play three Tests

Sydney: New Zealand have added an extra Test against the West Indies next year to make up for the likely cancellation of their scheduled series against Zimbabwe. 

New Zealand were originally due to host West Indies in two Tests next March but have reached an agreement to play a three-Test series. 

The West Indies will also play five limited-overs Internationals and a Twenty20 match on their six week tour while New Zealand will warm up for the series with three one day matches against Australia in December and four more with Sri Lanka over the New Year. 

NZC chief executive Martin Snedden said the summer programme had been expanded because of the governments decision to not issue visas to Zimbabwe, due to tour the country in December. 

Attempts to replace the cancelled Zimbabwe tour have been partially successful, Snedden said in a statement. 

The West Indies Cricket Board has agreed to a third Test match which will assist us to mitigate any potential losses from the cancelled tour. 

New Zealands domestic summer will begin with three one-day matches against Australia in December for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, a new annual competition between the trans-Tasman rivals. The first series, played in Australia last year, finished 1-1 with the third match washed out. 

The four-game one-day series against Sri Lanka was originally due to be played last summer but was postponed in the wake of the tsunami that devastated large parts of Asia. 

West Indies will play Tests in Auckland, Wellington and Napier with the first Test at Eden Park on March 9, marking the 50th anniversary of New Zealands first Test win, also against the West Indies.

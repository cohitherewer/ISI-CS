Madrid: Brazil forward Robinho gave Real Madrid fans a taste of things to come with a spectacular exhibition of ball skills after signing a five-year deal on Friday. 

The 21-year-old, who joined for $30 million from Santos, juggled for some 8,000 ecstatic fans at the Bernabeu Stadium. 

Balancing one ball after another on his back, flicking them over his shoulder and then kicking them into the stands, Robinho had to fend off a stream of admirers who ran on to the pitch to embrace him. 

Today we are going to present one of the great players in the world, said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. 

Football can be many things but one of the most important is the spectacle it provides, and it is in this aspect of fantasy football that Robinho excels. 

It hasnt been an easy road for him to come to Real Madrid, but I think hes chosen the perfect team and the perfect league for him to demonstrate is skills. Robinhos Real Madrid dream begins here. 

The presentation generated the level of interest seen when Galactico predecessor David Beckham signed for the club in 2003. 

Looking calm and relaxed Robinho was presented with the No. 10 shirt worn by Luis Figo last season. 

Im very happy to be here at Real Madrid, a club with such history and tradition and one that has such excellent players, he said. 

I want to thank people for a wonderful reception Ive been given and its great to have so many teammates who play for Brazil here at the club. 

Robinho burst on to the scene as a skinny 18-year-old by helping Santos win their first Brazilian championship in 2002. 

His trickery, skills and physique have led to comparisons with former Santos great Pele although the youngster has yet to be fully tested against the worlds top defenders. 

The forward could end up forming an all-Brazilian front line at Real with Ronaldo and Julio Baptista. He said he was confident he would make a rapid transition to European football. 

Brazilian football is spectacular and entertaining and a lot of its players have succeeded here and I want to do the same. There are a lot of similarities between Spanish and Brazilian football and I hope to adapt rapidly, Robinho said. 

I hope to use a few of my trademark pedaladas (step-overs) against my opponents while Im here, he added with a smile. But above all I want to help make Real Madrid a champion team and win a lot of trophies. 

Robinho is the fourth Brazilian international in the Real squad and will be reunited with former Santos boss Vanderlei Luxemburgo who is now in charge of the nine times European champions.

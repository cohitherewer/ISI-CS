 Serrafina, Santarelle may strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Racing returns to the main track from Thursday, though some professionals expressed doubts whether the makeshift strip would last the greater part of the season.

 Nevertheless, racing is expected to be competitive, particularly in the jackpot legs, but it may pay to follow the popular colours in the seven-event card. 

 If trainer Vijay Singhs Serrafina and Santarelle have edge over their rivals in the two trophy events ? the RWITC Cup and the BOL Publication Cup, the fellow-schooler Daniel David may do the trick in the rest of the card. Daniels KIng Is Born, Sky Bullet and Russian Valour are well in at weights in their respective events, and all four are capable of delivering the goods if the right-money comes on them.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

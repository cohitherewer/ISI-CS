Johannesburg: Marcus Trescothick kept England?s hopes alive with a defiant century on the fourth day of the fourth Test against South Africa on Sunday. 

England were 197 for five in their second innings, a lead of 189 runs, when bad light ended play 14.4 overs early. 

The tourists declared their first innings on 411 for eight with South Africa replying with 419 all out, Herschelle Gibbs hitting a sparkling 161 and England seamer Matthew Hoggard taking five for 144. 

Trescothick was 101 not out, his 10th Test century, after facing 164 balls and hitting 15 fours but a mini-collapse before the enforced close cost England three wickets for 11 runs. 

The left-hander looked nervous early on and saw opening partner and first innings centurion Andrew Strauss depart for a duck when he edged Makhaya Ntini to AB de Villiers at slip with a loose drive. 

South African captain Graeme Smith was injured in an accident before the start of the fourth day?s play. 

?He was taken for X-rays and a scan, and has been diagnosed with concussion,? media manager Gerald de Kock said. 

Smith did not take to the field and Nicky Boje led the side. 

Paceman Ntini then removed Robert Key for 19 when he nicked to second slip Jacques Kallis. 

Trescothick and captain Michael Vaughan regained the advantage for England with a dominating partnership of 124 for the third wicket. 

They punished South Africa on an increasingly easy pitch until midway through the final session when Vaughan (54) edged a fine out-swinger from fast bowler Shaun Pollock behind. 

Gibbs was out for 161 after hitting 25 fours when he cut the previously wayward James Anderson to Hoggard on the third man boundary. 

England fast bowler Steve Harmison again did not bowl because of an injured left calf. 

Harmison, whose fitness to bowl in South Africa?s second innings has not been confirmed. 

Others are also struggling and England have already called up Gloucester paceman Jonathan Lewis as cover for the last Test. 

If Harmison is declared unfit, Trescothick could be called on to bowl his part-time medium pacers on Monday.

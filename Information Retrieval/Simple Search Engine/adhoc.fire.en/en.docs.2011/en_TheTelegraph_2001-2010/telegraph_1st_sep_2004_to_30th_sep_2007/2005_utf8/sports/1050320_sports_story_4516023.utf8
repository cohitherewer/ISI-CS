Sepang heat cause for concern

 Overdrive 

Narain Karthikeyan

The Sepang circuit is probably one of the toughest 

to endure in the entire season. Being a rookie, I will always be at a disadvantage 

in terms of experience to most of the other drivers but at Sepang it shows even 

more.

I have spent a few days in Malaysia getting used to 

the conditions. The first round of qualification went well for the team and me. 

I had to learn a lot quickly in the practice sessions and hence went in with a 

specific gameplan of attempting to do a round by not pushing the car ? specifically 

the tyres ? too much and keep them for the final round of qualifying on Sunday.

Even though a lot has been said about the heat at 

Sepang, it cannot be emphasised enough! This is one of the biggest adjustments 

to make and this is where experience counts. It is unique in the sense that track 

conditions change constantly depending on the heat, the breeze etc. As a result, 

the car also has to be adjusted.

Needless to say, the more time I spend in the car, 

the better for the team. The track is full of sharp turns and flowing corners. 

It is very tough for rookies, since it is tough to judge these corners, sitting 

so low in the car. Plus, the heat factor adds the problem of mirages as well! 

All in all, it is very trying but we are focusing on finishing the race by being 

on top of our technology. 

From the point of view of the championship, Ferrari 

seems to be under pressure from Renault. They are getting their 2005 car sooner 

than they had planned. In Friday?s first round of qualifying, Renault was on top 

again and look in a strong position. 

There has been a lot of support from my countrymen 

and it?s very good to know there is so much interest in Formula One, leading to 

increasing viewership and opening of F1 clubs. This can only be good for my sport.

Annabee fancied

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: With three senior jockeys ? C.Alford, S.Shanker and I.Chisty ? suspended for two race days on account of riding a poorly judged race in the Queen?s Cup on February 5 ? apprentices are expected to take centrestage in Tuesday?s six event card. The feature event, the 2,000m Cupid Cup for horses in Class III, may, however, test the skill, temperament and experience of the two apprentices ? Shane Domingo and Vinay Jaiswal ? who will be guiding favourites Annabee and Annotate.

 If Vijay Singh?s Annabee boasts of finishing behind Star Angel in the Ladies? Derby, the 2,400m Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks, Annotate has been going from strength-to-strength since he walked into trainer Richard Alford?s stable. But, Domingo?s superiority in the saddle is undisputed against his fellow trainee and this factor alone may decide the outcome of the race in favour of Annabee.

Jaiswal, on Mayavi, may, however, find the going easy 

in the 1,100m Cavalry Cup. The four-year-old has let down big following on last 

two occasions, but against a week opposition the Dipak Karki-trainee may not disappoint.

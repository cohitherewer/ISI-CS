 Rathore ends seventh

New Delhi: World No. 2 Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore missed a place in the final after finishing seventh in the mens double trap at the ISSF shotgun World Cup in Rome on Wednesday. 

The Athens Olympics silver medallist, who finished with a score of 135/150, was tied for the sixth place with two others but lost out in the tie-breaker, according to information received here. 

He will next compete in the world shotgun championship to be held in Lonato from May 24 to 31. 

This was my first competition with the new custom made Perazzi DB 81. It takes time to adjust to a new gun and I am glad that I made this change now. 

I put in my best today. And although I did not reach the finals it was a good learning experience. I know what to focus on for the big competition next week, Rathore said. 

The keen contest included all three medallists from the Athens Games ? defending world champion Walton Eller of the US and world record holder Daniele di Spigno of Italy.

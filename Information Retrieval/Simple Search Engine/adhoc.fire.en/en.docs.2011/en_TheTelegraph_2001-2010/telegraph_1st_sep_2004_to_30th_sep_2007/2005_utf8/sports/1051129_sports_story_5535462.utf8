 Chelsea fined ?30000 by FA

 London: Chelsea were fined ?30,000 by the FA 

 on Monday for failing to control their supporters in a League 

 Cup tie against West Ham last season. 

 Meanwhile, West Ham have been warned by the FA about 

 their future conduct following the incident during the third 

 round tie on October 27, 2004. 

During the match, Chelsea matchwinner Mateja Kezman was forced to leave the field for treatment to a head injury caused by a missile, believed to be a coin, which appeared to have been thrown from a section of West Ham fans. 

Police in riot gear were then confronted by visiting supporters in a corner section of the ground 10 minutes after the final whistle and they fought with officers and Chelsea fans, with it taking 15 minutes for order to be restored. 

 Aston Villa manager David Leary, meanwhile was 

 fined ?5,000 pounds for insulting referee Graham Poll after 

 last months Birmingham derby.

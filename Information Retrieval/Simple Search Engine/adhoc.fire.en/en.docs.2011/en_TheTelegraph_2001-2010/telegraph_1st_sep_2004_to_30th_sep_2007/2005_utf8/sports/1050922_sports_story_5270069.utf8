Calcutta: Akhtar Ali was felicitated on Wednesday for his service to tennis for half a century ? first as a player and then as a coach ? and it was none other than Sania Mirza who did the honours. A galaxy of stars, including Naresh Kumar, P.K. Banerjee, Gurbux Singh and Dibyendu Barua were present on the occasion. A book on Akhtar was also released. 

This is a great day for me. My state, my country recognises my efforts. What more can a man want? an emotional Akhtar said. 

Asked what his most memorable moments are, Akhtar said, Three, to be precise. When India reached the final of Davis Cup in 1967, when my son Zeeshan became the national champion and today when all of you are here to honour me. 

Ali came into prominence in 1955 after winning the Junior nationals, then going on to reach the semi-finals of the Junior Wimbledon the same year. Ali was a member of the Davis Cup team continuously from 1958 to 1964, playing alongside Ramanathan Krishnan, Naresh Kumar, Premjit Lall and Jaidip Mukerjea. He later turned coach and his list of trainees read like a virtual whos who of Indian tennis ? Ramesh Krishnan, Vijay Amritraj, Anand Amritraj, Leander Paes to name a few. 

Sania, who had been helped by Akhtar in her formative years, was effusive in her praise. Today is his moment and he deserves all this and more. He has had a great career and is a great coach. He set me up on the right track and today I have reached here. 

She then added with a chuckle, I hope he will be around for a long time, to train my children and grandchildren. 

Naresh Kumar remembered the happy times Akhtar, Krishnan and he had shared and mentioned how Akhtar is a always ready to help, specially youngsters. 

Akhtar as a coach is as good as it gets. He travels the world and constantly keeps himself updated with the latest developments in the game. He is a national treasure. But the problem here in India is that we are obsessed with foreign coaches. 

Naresh also put in a word of praise for Sania, saying her forehand was faster than what his used to be. 

Nareshs view was reiterated by P. K. Banerjee who demanded to know. Why we need foreign coaches when we have treasures like Akhtar? 

C.G.K. Bhupathi, representing Mahesh Bhupathi, recalled the days when Akhtar coached him and went on to say that what he had learnt from Akhtar he had later taught Mahesh.

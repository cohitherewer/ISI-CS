 Calcutta: A sizeable turn out means hefty collections at the totalisator ? a simple formula. Tote manager Subir Das Gupta, however, feels big fields may have made the difference on the New Year?s Day. But in Boman Parakh?s, secretary RCTC, opinion the extra 10 percent crowd compared to January 1, 2004, has to be taken into consideration. Tote takings were all time high ? over Rs 81 lakh.

 The Derby day on January 9 may, perhaps settle the argument as fields on that day are going to be equally competitive but crowd figure may further drop down by 25 percent. The official attendance on the day, including the complimentary cards holders, was in excess of 14,000.

 Collections in the bookmakers? ring has surprisingly gone down from Rs 20 lakh last year to Rs 18 lakh. An RCTC insider said that it is time the club tightened the noose on them.

 Saturday?s was not Bath?s first ever treble. Bath already has a quadruple to his credit, recorded nearly 15 years ago. His winners were Captain Punter, Dynamic and Blazing Saddles. he failes to recall the fourth.

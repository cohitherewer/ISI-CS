 Inzy wants county stint

Lahore: Inzamam-ul Haq, Man of the Series in Pakistans 2-0 Test series win over England, is keen to play county cricket. 

I would like to play once in county cricket, that is something I have not done as yet. Last year there was an offer from a county, but I was not in a position to accept it, he said on Monday. 

The 35-year old Pakistan captain has been in prolific form this year, completing 1,000 runs in his last eight matches at an average of 83.33. (Reuters)

 Mourinho wants to coach Portugal

London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has rejected suggestions he would be interested in managing England and says he is keen to coach his native Portugal before he retires. 

Mourinho, who led Chelsea to their first championship title in 50 years last season, said that part of him felt like an Englishman now, hinting that in the future he could do the England job. 

Jose loves living in England. However, any suggestion that he would change his nationality is totally wrong and misleading, a spokesman for Mourinho said. He is a passionate Portuguese citizen and has made it very clear that one day he would like to manage the Portuguese national team. He also totally supports Sven-Goran Eriksson as England manager. The 42-year-old, who took charge at Chelsea last year after winning the Champions League with Porto, said if he stayed in England for the length of his contract, he would feel even more English. 

With six years of loving London and England I could do it (the England job) in a professional way and also with my heart, he said.

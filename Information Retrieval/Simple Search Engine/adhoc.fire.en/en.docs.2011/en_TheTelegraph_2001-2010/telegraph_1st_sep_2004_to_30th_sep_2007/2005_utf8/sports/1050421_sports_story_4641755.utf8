The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India blank Singapore

 Shikha won 6-0, 6-0 on her India debut 

New Delhi: India kicked off their Fed Cup campaign in style as they drubbed rank outsiders Singapore 3-0 in the Asia Oceania Zone Group 1 tie at the RK Khanna Stadium on Wednesday. 

Shikha Uberoi celebrated her debut in the women?s tennis competition under the Indian tricolour with a 6-0, 6-0 blanking of Yun-Ling Ng after Ankita Bhambri had put the hosts ahead beating Wei Ping Lee 6-1, 7-5. 

Shikha then combined with Rushmi Chakravarthi to pocket the doubles tie 6-1, 6-1 Agains Ng and Shao Fang Ong. The Singapore girls, primarily junior players, proved to be a mismatch and somewhat robbed of the charm of an inaugural match. 

But the Indian camp was a happy bunch, particularly for the US-based Shikha, who became eligible to represent her native country only recently. 

?Great, I couldn?t have asked for more,? 21-year old Shikha said. ?When I stepped on the court, everything faded.? 

The Florida resident, however, made as many as seven double faults, an indication of how emotions could spoil one?s game. 

Luckily for her, Ng, only 16 years of age and a junior ranking outside the thousand, did not pose many problems.

 Woods defends crown

Miyazaki: Tiger Woods defeated Japans Kaname Yokoo in a play-off to successfully defend his crown at the $1.7 million Dunlop Phoenix meet on Sunday. 

Woods picked up the $350,000 first prize after birdying the fourth extra hole, the par-five 18th. Yokoo hit his second shot into the trees right of the green and could only make par after missing a 12-foot putt. 

World No.1 Woods carded three birdies, three bogeys and a double bogey for a closing two-over 72. Yokoo had six birdies and five bogeys in a rollercoaster 69. Woods and Yokoo finished on eight-under 272, two shots ahead of American Jim Furyk (73) on a cold, overcast and occasionally wet day. 

It was a long see-saw day, Woods told reporters. Kaname was there, Jim was there and I was there. It was just a matter of who was going to blink first. I thought Id made it at 15 (after chipping in from the rough) but Kaname birdied 16 and 18. Hats off to him. What a tremendous effort he put in today. 

Woods win could cost him a place in this weeks PGA Grand Slam in Hawaii after he aggravated an injury to his left ankle on the first play-off hole.

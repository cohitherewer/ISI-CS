London: Ukraine maintained their push for a first appearance in the World Cup finals when they beat Albania 2-0 in Tirana on Wednesday to open up a six-point lead at the top of European qualifying group II. 

On a day when the final stages of the Asian and Concacaf competitions began, there were also qualifiers played in Europe and Africa with match winners including Japan, the United States, Morocco and South Korea among others, all keeping their eyes fixed on next year?s finals in Germany. 

European champions Greece also revived their qualifying hopes and moved into second place behind Ukraine on eight points after beating Denmark 2-1 in Athens ? their second successive win following the victory over Kazakhstan in November. 

Elsewhere in Europe, Spain crushed San Marino 5-0 in Almeria to move into second place in group VII behind Serbia and Montenegro, while in a group I Andorra again frustrated Macedonia, who ended the night in Skopje with their own fans cheering the Andorrans off the pitch. 

The match ended in a 0-0 draw, which means little in terms of World Cup qualification for either team, but is of huge significance to Andorra who scored their first competitive victory when they beat Macedonia 1-0 in October. 

Ukraine, who lost in play-offs for the 1998 and 2002 World Cups and Euro 2000, continued to set the pace in group II. Their victory over Albania came courtesy of goals from Andriy Rusol and Andriy Husin, although European Footballer of the Year Andriy Shevchenko, who overcame injury to play, did not find the net. 

Greece, who failed to win any of their opening three qualifiers, were too good in the end for the Danes who lost for the first time in five qualifying matches. 

Angelos Basinas scored what proved to be the winner with a 32nd minute penalty after skipper Theodoros Zagorakis, playing despite a fever, gave the hosts the lead after 25 minutes with his first international goal in his 101st appearance. 

Dennis Rommedahl scored for the Danes just before the end of the first half and there were no more goals after the break. 

Spain, whose youngsters beat San Marino 14-0 in an under-21 international on Tuesday, could not match that tally but were still far too strong for the seniors with goals from Joaquin in the 15th minute, Fernando Torres (33rd), Raul (43rd), Guti (65th) and Asier del Horno (79th). 

Morocco, seeking their fifth World Cup appearance, went to the top of African group V with a 5-1 win over Kenya thanks to an outstanding performance from Sochaux?s Jawad Zairi, who scored a hattrick and had a hand in Morocco?s other two goals. 

Morocco now lead by a point from Guinea, who they meet in their next qualifier in Casablanca on March 26. 

The United States got away to a winning start in the opening match of the 10-game final stage of the Concacaf zone, beating Trinidad and Tobago 2-1 in Port of Spain. 

Jaime Lozano was on target in the eighth and ninth minutes as Mexico edged Costa Rica 2-1 in their Concacaf tie while Panama and Guatemala shared a goalless draw.

 Injury sidelines Dettori for six weeks 

 Dettori

 London: Jamie Spencer is now odds-on favourite to win the champion jockeys crown after titleholder Frankie Dettori broke a collarbone in a fall at Sandown Park on Saturday.

 Spencer, 25, who quit as stable jockey to Irish trainer Aidan Brien in February, rode five winners at two meetings on Saturday and, with less than half the season remaining, has an outstanding chance of lifting the championship for the first time. 

 Bookmakers rate the Irishman as 5-6 favourite, from 6-4. Dettori, who could be out of action for up to six weeks, has been pushed out to 8-1 from 7-4.

 It was an unhappy weekend for the Italian. French Derby winner Shamardal, his mount in Saturdays Group One Eclipse Stakes, had to be pulled out the day before after suffering a career-ending fetlock injury.

 The race was won by 12-1 chance Oratorio, trained by Brien and ridden by Kieren Fallon, who upset the hot 2-5 favourite Motivator, last months Epsom Derby winner.

 Dettori has had a mixed season, enjoying two French classic triumphs on Shamardal but failing in the Epsom Derby again and missing out on the Royal Ascot meeting while serving a six-day ban for careless riding. (REUTERS)

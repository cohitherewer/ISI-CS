 Second loss for Tigers

Hyderabad: Bengal Tigers suffered their second consecutive defeat in the tier-II national hockey league, being held concurrently with the Premier Hockey League. 

Delhi Dazzlers mowed down Bengal Tigers 3-1 to register their second win in as many matches Saturday. 

Delhi went into lead by a solo from Yoginder Gulia (20th minute) and nine minutes later skipper Raghuvanshi converted a penalty corner while Anwar Khan provided the final touch in the 35th minute. 

Hardeep Singh scored the lone goal for Bengal. 

Delhi?s break came when Yoginder Gulia took a cross from Amit and neatly placed it into the target. Raghuvanshi?s drag flick put Delhi further ahead.

Calcutta: East Bengal will kick-off the 27 th Federation Cup campaign against Air India under lights at the Nehru Stadium in Goa on October 19. East Bengals match will be preceded by Dempo-HAL match. CFL Premier Division champions Mohun Bagan will begin on October 22 against Vasco SC. The final will be on October 30. 

JCT Mills open against Mahindra United, Mumbai, while Goas Churchill lock horns with Tollygunge Agragami on October 20. 

However, AIFF seems to have taken no lesson from the on-field death of Brazilian striker Cristiano de Lima Junior though they have instituted an award of Rs 2 lakh to be given to the best striker of the meet in his memory . 

It is quite surprising that it hasnt been made mandatory for the participating teams to keep a doctor in their support staff. On the contrary the AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said that they will allow one more official in case a team wishes to take a doctor along. It hasnt been made mandatory as it is difficult for the team doctor to do anything during emergency without adequate equipment, Colaco said.

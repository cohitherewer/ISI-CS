Calcutta: Raj Kumar Singh ? a 39-year-old sergeant of the Hare Street Police station ? had no inclination towards boxing in his early days, but took to the sport by chance. The decision proved to be success and he has been reaping the benefits since. 

Now his two daughters ? Rinki (15) and Dolly (14) ? are also determined to make it big in the boxing ring. 

The journey to be a sportsman actually started when father Rameshwar Nath became quite a famous name in polo. I saw my father and always wanted to become a successful sportsman like him, Raj said. 

Starting as a triple jumper, Raj represented Bengal during 1995-96 under the guidance of Sujit Sinha. Sir (Sinha) has influenced my liking for athletics and now also I think the same way as Sir used to, he said. 

Raj joined Police and was sent for commando training in 1997 and was adjudged the best shooter there. I came back and joined as chief instructor of the specified force in Calcutta. At that time I got myself involved in equestrianism and participated in many meets, Raj stated. 

But pursuing equestrianism was short-lived as a constable friend of Raj ? Mohammed Arif ? suggested him to take part in the state boxing meet in 2004. Believe me, I had never fought a bout before that in my life and had no preparation at all, but on his insistence, I took part and reached the semis creating a flutter in the rings. 

Later on I took part in the All India Police Boxing meet held in Jalandhar and came out with flying colours. Then I made it to the quarters in another all-India meet and missed the bronze medal by a whisker, Raj revealed.

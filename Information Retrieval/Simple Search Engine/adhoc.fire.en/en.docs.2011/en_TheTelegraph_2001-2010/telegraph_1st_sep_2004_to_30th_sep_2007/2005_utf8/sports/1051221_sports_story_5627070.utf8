Zurich: Germanys Birgit Prinz beat off competition from Brazilian player Marta and US challenger Shannon Boxx to win the Fifa womens crown for the third successive year. 

Although Brazilian Ronaldo and Frenchman Zinedine Zidane have both won the mens award three times, Fifa said Prinzs triumph was historic as it was the first time any player had achieved it thrice consecutively. 

Brazil were named Team of the Year, while Fifa also handed the Peruvian city of Iquitos its Fair Play award. 

The community, located in the middle of the Amazon region, was one of the venues for the under-17 world championship held between September and October. 

The Presidents Award went to Swedens former international referee Anders Frisk. 

Frisk retired from the sport in March when he received death threats after officiating in Barcelonas controversial 2-1 victory over Chelsea in the Champions League in February.

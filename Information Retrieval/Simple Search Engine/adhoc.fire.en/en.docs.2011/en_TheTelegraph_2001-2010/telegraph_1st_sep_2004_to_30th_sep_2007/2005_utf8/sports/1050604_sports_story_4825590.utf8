 Australia make final

 Action during the India-Australia clash in Kuala Lumpur on Friday. 

Kuala Lumpur: Olympic champions Australia were made to huff and puff by a resilient India before scoring a late second half goal to make the final of the Azlan Shah Cup at the Bukit Jalil Stadium here Friday. 

The defending champions looked off colour despite earning four penalty corners in the opening session. Perhaps it was the thought of an outright win and thereby a final playoff which was weighing on their mind. 

Australia found the winner when Jamie Dwyer struck in the 65th minute with the reverse hit after Craig Victory had sent a measured accurate minus in the crowded Indian circle. 

They used their flanks but lacked the speed and ball control against India, who appeared rusty and looked all at sea for the first 15 minutes. 

Even though the Aussie midfield was rock solid, their forwards Eli Matheson, Michael Boyce and captain Michael Mccann did trouble the rival defence but committed unforced errors in the circle. 

Liam de Young, the overlapping right wing half should have broken the ice in the second minute but shot wide, while another chance went abegging as Mccann pushed Mathesons pass out. 

India had their chances to score too. Prabhjyot Singh was found wanting twice and could have netted from a Rajpal Singh cross. Then Sandeep Michael muffed an easy opportunity from the middle of the circle, taking too much time with only Australia goalkeeper Stephen Lambert to beat.

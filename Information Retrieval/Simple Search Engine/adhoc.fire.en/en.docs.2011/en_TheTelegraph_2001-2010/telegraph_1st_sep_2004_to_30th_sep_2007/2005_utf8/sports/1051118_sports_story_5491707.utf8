Calcutta: Narain Karthikeyan may have almost lost out on a drivers slot for the forthcoming season, but is still in talks with F1 teams in the lookout for test and reserve positions. 

Karthikeyan, who spent a few hours in the city on Thursday as part of a felicitation organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) at Palladian Lounge, did not wish to spell out the details. Talks are on with various teams? I am just back from the UK after a round of discussions. 

After my maiden year with Jordan, I would obviously want to move up to a better team. Something will develop over the next few days, Karthikeyan sounded optimistic. 

There have been reports that Williams might rope him in as a pay driver, but Karthikeyan wasnt willing to discuss any further. 

He refused to take any question on Jordan ? now renamed Midland ? and was in no mood to reply to allegations of his lacking in professional management. This is a felicitation programme and I do not wish to talk about it. It can be taken up another day. 

Karthikeyan felt his stint in the circuit has been a great experience. The year 2005 has been a huge learning curve. The whole thing involves only 10 per cent of driving? the rest includes PR, data collection and various technical aspects. 

I was determined, I was focussed, I had set some goals, and I went for them. As a rookie, my aim was to finish as many races as possible. I finished 14 out of the 19 races. I made mistakes in Monaco and Canada and was lucky to get points in the US. I learnt a lot in my debut season and can use the experience in future. Im still living my dream, he explained. 

How was the experience to compete with Michael Schumacher? Hes a legend? he has been in the circuit for 13 years. Id never imagined I would get the chance to race with him. It was dramatic? the experience unbelievable. 

All drivers are pretty tough in the circuit. You need a lot of aggro to survive. 

It is really tough there. In places like Bahrain, the temperature shoots up to 52 degree Celsius. At the end of the race, you shed a few kilos of your body weight, Karthikeyan remarked. 

What is his message to youngsters? If you set a goal, go after it and get it? Thats my policy. There is always an element of luck involved in whatever you do in life. If you get the right break at the right time, utilise it. 

Was he was interested in joining A1? Its a good concept. Indian drivers like Armaan Ebrahim and Karun Chandhok are doing well. But I have no such plans right now. I havent put my thoughts into it. 

Ravi Poddar, chairman CII (ER), was present on the occasion.

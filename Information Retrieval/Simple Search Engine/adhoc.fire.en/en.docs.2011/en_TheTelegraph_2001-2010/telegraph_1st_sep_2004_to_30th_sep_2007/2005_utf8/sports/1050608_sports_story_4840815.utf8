 No more predictions, says Michael Schumacher

 Schumacher 

London: Already enduring the worst Formula One season of his career, world champion Michael Schumacher has given up making predictions. 

Id rather not, the Ferrari driver said on his website ahead of Sundays Canadian Grand Prix and the following weeks US race at Indianapolis. My predictions havent been all that great lately. 

Im going to go to Montreal and make the best of whatever comes up there for us. 

Schumacher, winner of 13 of last years 18 races on his way to a seventh world title, has scored just 16 points from seven Grands Prix while Renaults championship leader Fernando Alonso has 59. 

Well have to wait and see what happens during Fridays practice sessions to be able to say more, said the German, holidaying with family and friends in North America. 

There are so many teams delivering good performances right now, so Id rather wait before I say anything. 

But one things for sure, well clench our teeth and put up a big fight. 

Schumacher has the best record of any driver in Canada, winning that race for the last three years and a record seven times in total. 

No other driver in the history of Formula One has won the same race as much, although Schumacher has also won the French Grand Prix seven times. 

Ferrari have yet to win a race this year, with Renault triumphant in five and McLaren in two.

 Steffi Graf loses two, wins one

Washington: Steffi Graf was beaten twice in her one-off return to competitive tennis on Tuesday before salvaging some pride by ending the night on a winning note in a World Team Tennis (WTT) event in Houston. 

Representing the Houston Wranglers, the 36-year-old Graf was unable to shake off the rust of a six-year absence, losing to Russian Elena Likhovtseva of the Sacramento Capitals 5-4. 

Graf, who retired in 1999 after winning 22 Grand Slam titles, then teamed up with Ansley Cargill in womens doubles but lost 2-5 to Likhovtseva and Anna Kournikova. 

However, the German was successful in mixed doubles as she and Mardy Fish overcame Mark Knowles and Kournikova 5-3. 

The format has teams playing best-of-nine game single-set matches in two singles and three doubles. 

Married to Andre Agassi and the mother of two children, Graf said Tuesdays match would be her only WTT appearance of the season.

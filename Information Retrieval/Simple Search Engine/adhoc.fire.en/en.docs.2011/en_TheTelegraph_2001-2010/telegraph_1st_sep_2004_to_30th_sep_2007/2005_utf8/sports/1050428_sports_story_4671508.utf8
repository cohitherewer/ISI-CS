 Jyoti leads strong Indian presence

 - Asian Open 

 Randhawa has been paired with defending champion Jimenez 

Shanghai: Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh will look to better their performances as they lead a group of six Indians in this week?s BMW Asian Open, which has the strongest field in the event?s four-year history, chasing $1.5 million in prize money. 

Randhawa and Jeev tied for 10th place at the 2004 edition, won by Miguel Angel Jimenez, who is back to defend his title. 

Other Indians in the event being held in China?s booming financial capital are Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon, Rahil Gangjee and Gaurav Ghei. Barring Ghei, who did not play, the other five had missed the cut in Beijing last week at the Johnnie Walker Classic. 

For the second straight week, Randhawa has been paired with the defending champion, Jimenez, and this time the third player in the group will be Colin Montgomerie, who was sixth last week. 

That will be the Thursday morning?s most high profile group, while in the afternoon, the focus will be on Ernie Els, who plays with K.J. Choi and Paul Casey. 

Johl plays in a group with Kenneth Ferrie and the Thai Chawalit Plaphol, while Jeev is paired with Lu Wen Te and Nobuhito Sato. 

Ghei will team up with Jean-Francois Lucquin and China?s Zeng Fa Qi. Kahlon will pair up with Adam Groom and Chris Williams. Gangjee goes out with Marcus Fraser and Soren Hansen. 

Other big stars in the fray include Chinese No.1 Zhang Lian-Wei, Nick Faldo and Asia?s big names, Thongchai Jaidee and Thaworn Wiratchant, besides Randhawa. 

Jimenez, whose 2004 haul also included wins in Hong Kong and Thailand, is delighted to be back to defend his title. 

?It was my first time in Shanghai last year and my wife and I had a great time. It was a great golf course and we had great weather and everything was very nice. I am still hitting the ball very well and will try as hard as I can to beat the guys here.? 

The Spaniard, winner of five titles on the European Tour last year, had cruised to the 2004 Asian Open title by three shots. 

The meet is joint-sanctioned by the Asian and European Tours for the fourth time. 

Els, who says he has been working on a ?couple of basics? in his golf swing, including his ball position and posture, is looking forward to the warm and sunny conditions that are anticipated this week. Already a winner in Dubai and at the joint-sanctioned Qatar Masters in 2005, he was tied sixth last week. 

Briton Colin Montgomerie believes his putting holds the key to success at the Asian Open even as he pushes for a place in the US Open in June. 

Montgomerie, who failed to qualify for this month?s US Masters for the first time since 1991, has slipped to 54th in the rankings after a nightmare 2004 and needs to climb four spots to qualify. 

?I?m back to where I should be,? he said after practice at Shanghai?s Tomson Golf Club. ?I?m leading the stroke average and greens in regulation. I?m in the top 10 in driving. 

?It?s not a bomber?s course like some are these days. If I can hole a few putts I?ll win it.? 

Montgomerie, who tied for sixth at last week?s Johnnie Walker Classic in Beijing, said he could not believe he had not moved up the rankings. 

?What the hell have I got to do?,? he said. ?But the gap has shortened and a decent week here and I?ll grab them all. Everything?s going in the right direction. I?ve travelled all over the place this year and I?m knackered. Hopefully there?s a win around the corner.?

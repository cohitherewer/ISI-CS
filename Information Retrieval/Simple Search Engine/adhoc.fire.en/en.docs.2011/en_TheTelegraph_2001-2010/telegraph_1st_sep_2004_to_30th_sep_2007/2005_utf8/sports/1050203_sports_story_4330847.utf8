 Rivaldo keeps options open 

Athens: Brazilian striker Rivaldo, who walked out of the stadium after being substituted last weekend, has said he will wait until the end of the season to decide on his future at Greek club Olympiakos Piraeus. 

?When the championship finishes, I?ll think about my future,? the 32-year-old World Cup winner told the Greek daily Kathimerini. 

?I?ll stay on until summer to win titles and then we?ll see.? 

Rivaldo, who signed a two-year contract with the club last July worth 1.8 million euros ($2.35 million) a year, was angered by coach Dusan Bajevic?s decision to substitute him at halftime during Sunday?s match against Aris Salonika.

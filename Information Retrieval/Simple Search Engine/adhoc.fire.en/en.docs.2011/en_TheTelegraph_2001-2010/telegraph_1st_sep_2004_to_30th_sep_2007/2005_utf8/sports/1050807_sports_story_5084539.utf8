 Players served notice of dismissal

Wayne Rooney will be sent off this season if he repeats his torrent of foul-mouthed abuse against referees after the football authorities issued a reminder of disciplinary directives to clubs on player behaviour Friday. 

The Manchester United forward drew heavy criticism last season after he reacted to being booked by confronting Graham Poll, the referee, by launching a barrage of expletives during his teams win away to Arsenal in a televised match. 

Poll showed leniency in allowing Rooney to remain on the field, but Keith Hac-kett, the general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, said that he wants to stamp out provocative behaviour from play- ers. 

Referees have been instructed to send off a player who confronts a match official using offensive, insulting or abusive language. 

It is that type of incident, and I dont want to revolve around a particular player, but in terms of insulting language in an aggressive manner, that is the picture that paints a story, Hackett said. Having spoken to the referee involved in that, I can assure you that the overview is that it is unacceptable.

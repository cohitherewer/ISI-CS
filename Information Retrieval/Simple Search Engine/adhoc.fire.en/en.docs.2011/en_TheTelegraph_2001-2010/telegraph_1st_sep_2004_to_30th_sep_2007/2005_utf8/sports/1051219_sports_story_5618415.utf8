Ahmedabad: For Anil Kumble, who completed his 100 Tests on Sunday, every match is still a challenge. I remain under the scanner in every innings, he says. 

While the BCCI felicitated him with a memento, his teammates, too, came out with a similar token of appreciation that had their autographs inscribed on it. The players memento will remain special. Receiving it from Sachin on behalf of the team was great. I was around when he played his 100th Test. Not many words were spoken, but the respect they showed said it all, said Kumble. 

Board president Sharad Pawar in a written statement said: Hearty congratulations to you on reaching a career milestone? You are an exception in this world of flamboyance, as you have shown the world that aggression can be as just lethal when it is masked. You are a perfect team man and have always given your best when the team needed it most and your behaviour has been exemplary both on and off the field. By sheer dedication, hard work and your never say die attitude you established for yourself a place of honour in world of cricket. 

This was quite an emotional moment. Its very special to be a part of the elite group, said Kumble. 

When I started off in Manchester in 1990 the aim was to try and do well. I was then dropped for a year. The comeback was tough but I achieved success. Then the shoulder injury happened. It took me almost two months to lift my hand after the operation. My family and wife stood by me and gave me all the encouragement. Their support played a huge role in my coming this far, he explained. 

How long does he wish to continue? As long as I keep enjoying and performing, I wish to go on. 

Kumble took the opportunity to thank all who have played a part in his career. There have been various cricketers who have helped me. Azhar my first captain played a major role in my career? Then Wadekar, Bedi and in more recent times John Wright has made an impact. I cant also forget the contribution of Rahul, Sachin, Sourav. They help me at nets and I keep asking them if everything is fine. 

What would he like to remember most? My first Test, my first wicket and my first five wicket haul in Test matches. 

Does he regret not having continued as a pacer? No . If I had been a pacer I dont think I would have continued for so long.

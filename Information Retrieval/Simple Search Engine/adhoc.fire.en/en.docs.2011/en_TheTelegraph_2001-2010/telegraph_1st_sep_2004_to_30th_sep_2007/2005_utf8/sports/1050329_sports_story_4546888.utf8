The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Laxman ignored, Balaji returns 

 - Kumble omitted on fitness grounds 

Bangalore: V.V.S. Laxman was on Monday ignored and Anil Kumble was kept out due to injury from the 14-member Indian squad for the first two one-day Internationals against Pakistan beginning on Saturday. Dinesh Karthik and Gautam Gambhir were the others to be left out of the Test squad. 

[That four changes will be made from the Test squad was, in fact, reported by The Telegraph on Monday itself. The selection, therefore, has been on expected lines.] 

India are to play six one-dayers against Pakistan with the first match scheduled to be held in Kochi on Saturday. The second tie is in Visakhapatnam on April 5. 

?Kumble was not considered for selection due to a minor knee injury,? BCCI joint secretary Gautam Dasgupta said while announcing the squad here on Monday. He also said Laxman?s name had come up for discussion in the meeting. Lakshmipathy Balaji returned to the squad at Joginder Sharma?s expense. The Haryana medium-pacer had made his India debut in Bangladesh. 

 Wicketkeeper Karthik and opener Gambhir have made 

 way for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Dinesh Mongia in the ODI 

 squad.

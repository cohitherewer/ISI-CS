The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harbhajan set to make Eden XI 

 - Zaheer Khan ?under pressure?

Calcutta: Offie Harbhajan Singh, who had to sit out the first Test against Pakistan in Mohali, is set to make the XI at the Eden. 

The second Test gets underway on Wednesday and Harbhajan has an excellent record. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, Zaheer Khan is ?under pressure? to keep his place. He was, incidentally, the least successful of the three Indian seamers in Mohali. 

Obviously, Anil Kumble, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan can?t be touched and, so, the axe could well fall on Zaheer. 

Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, who arrived on Sunday morning itself (ahead of the rest of the boys), promptly visited the Eden for a first-hand look at the wicket. 

The Harbhajan-decision, of course, is only going to be taken once coach John Wright has also seen the surface. 

The Indians? nets is scheduled for Monday afternoon.

 Focus on Kaif as East meet Central

 Shukla will lead East in Sourav?s absence 

Gwalior: A lot of sheen has been taken away from the Duleep Trophy match between East and Central Zone starting here Tuesday after Sourav Ganguly was ruled out of the four-day tie. 

With the suspense over the Indian captain?s availability finally over, the spotlight will shift to Mohammed Kaif who is hoping to correct the anomaly of the best batsman in form being out of the Test team. 

The absence of Sourav, suffering from a side strain, means vice-captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla would now lead East but it would be his counterpart who will be hogging the limelight. 

The Uttar Pradesh batsman has been in sublime form throughout this season in both forms of the game. When all his star partners struggled to get going at the start of the season, Kaif scored runs at will. Neither the mid-season break nor the change of scene, from international to domestic, has affected his scoring rate as the wiry 24-year-old led from the front in the Deodhar Trophy limited-overs tournament and then combined with Rahul Dravid to lead India A to a thumping win in the Challenger Trophy. 

Yet, Kaif does not enjoy a permanent spot in the Test team. He, though, hasn?t disappointed in the few opportunities that have come his way. 

He would do well to produce another good knock here that could gain him the nod for the series against Pakistan. 

Another player who is in a similar situation is left-arm spinner Murali Kartik. Just when he thought he had tilted the balance in his favour with his Man of the Match performance against Australia in Mumbai, the Railways? player finds himself struggling to stay in the spotlight. 

 Chance for Kaif to impress selectors

With Anil Kumble, India?s new highest wicket-taker 

seeming to improve with every match, it is going to be that much harder for Kartik 

to break into the Test team. 

Nevertheless, with India likely to play the spin card in another home series, a third specialist spinner?s place should be that much inspiration for him to do well in the tournament. 

It will also be a crucial outing for Mahendra Singh Dhoni who gets an opportunity to be in the headlines and prove he is no flash in the pan. 

The same applies for Bengal mediumpacers Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul. 

Paul was in the Test squad for the Bangladesh tour but did not get a chance to prove his abilities. His form this season hasn?t been worth mentioning and he could do well to return to his wicket taking ways ahead of the Pakistan series. Ranadeb, on the other hand, has been a revelation this season. More than 30 wickets in the Ranji Trophy and one-day meet bear ample testimony to his capabilities.

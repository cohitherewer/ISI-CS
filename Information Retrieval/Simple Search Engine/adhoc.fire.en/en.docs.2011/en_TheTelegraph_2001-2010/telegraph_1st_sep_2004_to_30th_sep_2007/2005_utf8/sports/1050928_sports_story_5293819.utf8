 Andrew Flintoff is PCA Player of the Year

London: England allrounder Andrew Flintoff has won the Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) Player of the Year award. 

The award was presented to Flintoff at a gala dinner attended by over 1,500 players and guests at Londons Albert hall on Monday. 

This is the second successive year that Flintoff has received the award, the most coveted accolade of all because only present county professionals can vote. 

The Ashes hero, however, insisted that England cannot afford to rest on their laurels when they come up against Pakistan and India. 

Flintoff said that both he and England still have plenty to prove before they can claim to rank as the worlds best after beating Australia. 

Pakistan is going to hold new challenges, Flintoff said to a TV channel. Having played against Australia, it was hard, and Im sure Pakistan is going to be equally hard. 

Were going out to the subcontinent, well play under different conditions, foreign to ourselves, and I feel Ive got something to prove there. 

With conditions in Pakistan and India likely to suit spinners, Ashley Giles is another who will be looking to make his mark. 

Ive got an important role to play in the sub-continent, so I have to be ready, fit and firing, said Giles. So, the next four weeks are important for preparation. 

Yorkshire paceman Matthew Hoggard is also aware of just how big a task England will face in Asia. 

Weve got to beat Pakistan and India. They are two very hard sides to beat at home, so we are not going to get ahead of ourselves. 

England play Pakistan in three Tests and five one-day matches in November-December. 

Their tour of India next year comprises three Tests and seven ODIs with the Test series scheduled for March 8-29 and the one-dayers between April 4-22.

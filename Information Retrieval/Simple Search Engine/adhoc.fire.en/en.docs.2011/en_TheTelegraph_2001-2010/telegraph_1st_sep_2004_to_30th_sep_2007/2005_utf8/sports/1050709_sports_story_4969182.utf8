 Venus to open vs Myskina

Moscow: Fresh from her third Wimbledon title, Venus Williams will aim to give the US a dream start in their Fed Cup semi-final against holders Russia on Saturday. 

Venus, who won an epic final against world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport last week, was paired against 2004 French Open champion Anastasia Myskina in Fridays draw held in Moscows Olympic Stadium. 

World number 52 Mashona Washington, who replaced Davenport in the team, will make her Fed Cup debut in the second singles rubber against Elena Dementieva. 

Sundays action will see two reverse singles followed by a doubles match in which Venus is expected to team up with Corina Morariu against Vera Douchevina and Dinara Safina. France, meanwhile, have opted for a hardcourt surface to host Spain. World No. 3 Amelie Mauresmo will be supported by in-form Mary Pierce, a finalist in the French Open. 

The Spanish side includes world 33 Anabel Medina and 39th-ranked Nuria Llagostera. 

Spain, the 2002 champions, lead 4-3 in previous meetings but have not won against the French since 1996. 

Davenports withdrawal is a huge blow for the Americans, already missing Venus younger sister Serena, who is unavailable after her shock upset in the third round of Wimbledon by Jill Craybas. 

All eyes will now be on Venus, who will have to play a leading role in Moscow if the US are to go through. 

Initially, I was behind Lindsay and Serena and I wasnt expected to be in this position but I feel real good right now, she said. 

Garrison added: Most of all, Venus is a leader and everyone including myself will just follow. 

Russia captain Shamil Tarpishchev said his team was counting on vocal home support to lift them as they seek their first win against the Americans after losing all four previous ties. 

Definitely, were hoping for a great support both days, he said. I think fan support counts five or seven percent toward overall victory. 

Myskina said a slow clay surface should give them a big edge. The fact that Lindsay is missing gives us an even bigger chance, said Myskina, who celebrated her 24th birthday on Friday. 

Dementieva said she would draw inspiration from beating Venus in the 1999 final. 

Meanwhile, eight other teams fight to stay in World Group I next year, with Belgium Kim Clijsters making her return to Fed Cup in her home town of Bree against Argentina. 

In the three other ties, Croatia play Germany, the Czech Republic host Italy and Switzerland and Austria clash in Lausanne. (Agencies)

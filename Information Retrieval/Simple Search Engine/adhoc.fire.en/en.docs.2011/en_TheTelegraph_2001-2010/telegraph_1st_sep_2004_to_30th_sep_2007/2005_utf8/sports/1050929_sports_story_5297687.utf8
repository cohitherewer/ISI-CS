 Formal nod to Inzy participation

Dubai: Following the eventual nod from Inzamam ul-Haq, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has confirmed the Pakistan captains participation in the ICC Super Series beginning in Australia on October 5. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said that he had spoken to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan to clarify the situation, and after the conversation, he was able to confirm the players availability. 

Mr Khan told me he had spoken to Inzamam and explained there had been a genuine misunderstanding within the PCB over the players availability and selection for the Johnnie Walker Super Series, Speed said. 

Mr Khan has assured me Inzamam is not only available for the Test but is very much looking forward to it and is excited and honoured to be part of the squad, he said. 

Inzamam ? who is a replacement for Sachin Tendulkar in the World XI Test squad ? was threatening to withdraw for not being included in the ODI squad but retracted his statement after meeting Shaharyar Khan on Tuesday morning. 

The Super Series will begin with the three-match one-day series against world champion Australia at Telstra Dome in Melbourne on October 5, 7 and 9. 

A one-off six-day Test match will be held at the Sydney Cricket Ground from October 14 to 19.

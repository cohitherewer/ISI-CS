Dhaka: Left-arm spinner Enam-ul Haq (Jr) took four wickets for 32 runs on Friday as Zimbabwe stumbled on the first day of the second cricket Test against Bangladesh. At stumps, captain Tatenda Taibu was unbeaten at 49 with Tinashe Panyangara on 14 as Zimbabwe posted 244 for six. 

?Batting was not very difficult, we hope to get 350,? Zimbabwe vice-captain Dion Ebrahim said of the team?s target with the remaining four wickets. 

Taibu ? eyeing his sixth half-century in 17 matches ? was lucky not to be adjudged leg before at 36 when a Mohammad Rafique delivery appeared to hit him on the pad. Taibu, 21, missed his maiden century by six runs in the first Test in Chittagong. 

?We want to finish them off early in the morning,? Bangladesh vice-captain Khaled Mashud said, praising his bowlers? performance, particularly Rafique?s tight bowling and Haq?s four-wicket haul. 

After losing four quick wickets in the second session, Taibu and Elton Chigumbura added fifty runs to steady the Zimbabwe innings. But Chigumbura was caught at point by Mohammad Ashraful as paceman Tapash Baishya claimed his second wicket of the day with a new ball. 

Earlier, Stuart Matsikenyeri hit a half-century and combined for a 65-run opening partnership with Barney Rogers after Taibu won the toss and opted to bat. 

The Bangladesh spin bowlers failed to capitalise on the early morning moisture on a batting wicket at Dhaka?s Bangabandhu National Stadium. 

Bangladesh lead the two-match series 1-0. Five one-day Internationals will follow the Test series. (AP)

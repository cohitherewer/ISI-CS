 Kimi claims pole, Narain 19th

 - GERMAN GRAND PRIX 

 Raikkonen 

Hockenheim: Narain Karthikeyan on Saturday had a first-hand experience of the technically demanding Hockenheim circuit as he came off the track at the first corner and ended up 19th on the grid for the German Grand Prix. 

McLarens Kimi Raikkonen survived a last corner wobble to claim pole. The Finn suffered some oversteer as he turned into the home straight but managed to clock 1:14.320 and claim his third pole of the season. 

Britains Jenson Button will join him on the front row of the grid in his BAR after setting the second best time in 1:14.759, while championship leader Fernando Alonso qualified third and will line up on the second row. World champion Michael Schumacher qualified a creditable fifth behind Giancarlo Fisichella. 

Keeping Narain company at the back was Raikkonens teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, who spun out after a blunder at the final corner. 

Narains Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro finished 18th, but the Indian may be better placed because the rules permit him to start with full fuel load and so he can adopt a flexible strategy on Sunday. 

I lost the car on this very technical German track on the first corner. The track was dry despite the threatening sky. But the surface was quite slippery, Narain said. 

After this, I lost too much time and decided to go back to the pits. Luckily, I did not damage the car nor the tyres during the spin. The advantage of the position is that I will be allowed to leave with a full load of fuel and we can adapt the strategy and the number of stops to the situation. 

It will allow me to work with the engineers on the different and best set-up solutions to bring the car to the finish. Ill just have to manage the start with the powerful McLaren Mercedes also at the back of the grid, he said.

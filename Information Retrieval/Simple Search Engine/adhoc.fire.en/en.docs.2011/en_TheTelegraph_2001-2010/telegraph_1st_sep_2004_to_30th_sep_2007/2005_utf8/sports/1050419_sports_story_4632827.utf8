 Cairns to quit after World Cup 

Mangalore: New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns has said he would retire from international cricket after the 2007 World Cup to be held in the West Indies. 

Cairns, who was here in connection with plans to help destitute through Chris Cairns Charitable Foundation, told reporters that he had earlier chosen to retire from Test cricket, to make way for youngsters. 

The New Zealander said he would concentrate fully on one-day game in view of the forthcoming World Cup. 

?As soon as the World Cup is over, I will hang up my boots in international cricket,? he said. (PTI)

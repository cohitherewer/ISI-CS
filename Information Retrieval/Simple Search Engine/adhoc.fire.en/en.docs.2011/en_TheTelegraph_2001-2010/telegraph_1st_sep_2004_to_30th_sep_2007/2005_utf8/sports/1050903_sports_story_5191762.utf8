 Isinbayeva eyes Hollywood

Moscow: After taking the sporting world by storm, world and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva says she would love to be in the movies. Isinbayeva has had a phenomenal year, breaking the world record nine times and becoming the first woman to clear five metres. 

The Russian also won her first world title in Helsinki last month, setting the new record of 5.01. Now she wants to make her mark in Hollywood. 

I love challenges and trying out new things and I would love to get into acting, the bubbly 23-year-old said on Friday. 

Asked what kind of films she preferred, Isinbayeva said: No drama or romance.

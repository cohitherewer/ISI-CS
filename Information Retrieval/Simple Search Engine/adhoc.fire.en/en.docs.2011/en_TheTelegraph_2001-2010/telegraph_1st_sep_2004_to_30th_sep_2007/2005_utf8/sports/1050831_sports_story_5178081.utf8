 Sanskara set to win Stakes 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Sanskara may be hard to toss in the 1,400m Calcutta Fillies Trial Stakes, the main attraction in Wednesdays eight-event card.

 The highly rated Bharath Singh-trained filly who just about managed to win the 1,600m Nanoli Stud Calcutta Million, last winter, went on to assert her Class in the 1,400m Acorn Stakes which she won the way she liked.

 The Dont Forget Me-Shiseido filly, however, failed on a wet track early in the season. But that run has definitely brought her up, and in the hands of Suraj Narredu she is unlikely to disappoint.

 One expected to follow Sanskara home could be Clockwork, who is on the up since her hard earned victory over Remarquable. It was the debut run of the Vijay Singh-trained ward by Steinbeck out of Alarming.

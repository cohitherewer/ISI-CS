The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Gibbs may bat at No.4 in Tests too

 - ?It takes a different mind-set to bat down there? 

 Gibbs is happy with middle-order berth 

Cape Town: South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs has said his move down to the middle order was likely to be repeated in Test matches. 

Speaking after his match-winning century against England in the fourth one-day International at Newlands Stadium, Gibbs expressed satisfaction with his performances at No. 4 in the one-day form of the game. 

In his three innings there, he has scored 78, 50 and 100, and looked completely untroubled. 

?It takes a different mind-set to bat down there,? said Gibbs, who made his name as an attacking opening batsman. ?I am giving myself a chance to get in now.? It shows in the statistics. His 78 came off 101 balls, his 50 off 60, and his 100 at newlands off 115. 

His move was prompted by the arrival of A.B. de Villiers. While the young opening batsman has yet to make his mark in one-dayers, he made 362 runs in the lost Test series against England at an average of 40.22. 

?A.B. has thrown a spanner in the works,? said Gibbs. ?He?s a good, promising youngster, and he deserves a run at opening the batting.? 

While Gibbs was initially coy when pressed about playing down the order in Tests, he acknowledged it was likely that he would be comfortable at No. 4. 

South African captain Graeme Smith said: ?Herschelle has played very well at four. He has scored runs and he has created a lot of extra intensity for us. Not only that, he?s improved every game.? 

Meanwhile, South African selection chief Haroon Lorgat announced an unchanged squad for the remaining three one-dayers in the seven-match series and said Gibbs would play down the order permanently. 

?We had lengthy discussions with Herschelle and Graeme after the first one-dayer which we lost so badly, and Herschelle agreed to bat lower down after sleeping on the decision,? he said. 

The South African media has frequently quoted Gibbs as saying he would like to bat down the order, but Lorgat made it clear the batsman found it tough to relinquish the opening berth. 

?To be honest, though, I am very relaxed when I am waiting for my chance to bat,? said Gibbs. (AP)

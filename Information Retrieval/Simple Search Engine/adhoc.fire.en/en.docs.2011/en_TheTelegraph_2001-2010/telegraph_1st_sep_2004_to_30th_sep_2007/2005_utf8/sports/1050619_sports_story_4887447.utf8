Nuremberg: Mexico will probably be without captain Rafael Marquez when they look to wipe out memories of a stinging defeat by Brazil in Sundays Confederations Cup clash with the world champions in Hanover. 

Brazil were the last team to beat Mexico, back in July last year, when Adriano scored twice in a 4-0 rout in the quarter finals of the Copa America. 

Adriano scored another wonderful goal as the world champions produced the same sort of form to beat European champions Greece 3-0 in their opening group B game on Thursday. 

Concacaf champions Mexico need Marquez back at the heart of the defence in Hanover but the Barcelona player, who missed their 2-1 win over Japan with a groin strain, is doubtful about his chances. 

It depends on how I feel on the eve of the game, he said. Im recovering but I dont want to risk coming back too soon and aggravating the injury. 

Mexico coach Ricardo La Volpe admitted his side had been surprised by the speed of the Japanese forwards early in their opening group game. 

Heaven knows how they will cope against Brazil, whose pinpoint passing and quicksilver running off the ball delighted fans in Leipzig. 

Defeat by Brazil was the low point of La Volpes spell in charge yet the Argentine coach is looking forward to the rematch for practical reasons rather than in the hope of revenge. 

Its important to play the strongest teams in a competition like this, La Volpe said. We have to get through qualifying yet, but we want to see how we fare against the best teams ahead of the World Cup. 

Brazil were clearly enjoying themselves against Greece and coach Carlos Alberto Parreira wants to ensure there will be no let up in intensity against Mexico. 

Weve come here to enhance our reputation and reach the final, Parreira said. 

One intriguing aspect of the match will be the presence in the Mexico line-up of Sao Paulo-born forward Zinha, who scored an eye-catching goal of his own as he picked up the Man of the Match award against Japan. 

Greeces defeat was a chastening experience and Otto Rehhagel faces selection problems as he tries to revive the teams hopes of a semi-final place by beating Japan in Frankfurt on Sunday. 

Captain Theodoros Zagorakis played for his Italian club Bologna in a relegation play-off on Saturday and it will be highly unlikely that he will in any condition to appear again 24 hours later. 

Giourkas Seitaridis, who came off at half-time against Brazil with a knee injury, and Sotirios Kyrgiakos are both doubtful. 

Weve not given up hope, said Seitaridis. We have to go out and beat Japan. 

Japans Brazilian coach Zico was disappointed with the way his players defended against Mexicos use of high balls in their first game and he wants to see an improvement. 

We have to work on that for the Greece game, he said. We made life very difficult for our goalkeeper.

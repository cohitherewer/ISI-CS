 Sacked Gilbert not sure Roddick took right decision

 - ?He has improvements to make and I thought I could help?

Oakland: Two weeks after being sacked by world No. 2 Andy Roddick, Brad Gilbert was unsure whether his former pupil had made the right decision. After joining forces with Roddick in June 2003, Gilbert had coached the American to the US Open crown and the number one ranking in less than five months. 

However, earlier this month, Roddick abruptly severed ties with the coach who had guided him to nine titles in 18 months. 

?We?ll know from Andy?s results in a year or two whether he made the right decision,? Gilbert said in a telephone interview on Thursday. 

?He still has improvements to make and I thought I could help him with those. Whether he makes those with someone else only time will tell.? 

Roddick, who has recently hired US Davis Cup assistant coach Dean Goldfine as his new coach, failed to give any reason for the axing. 

Roddick said his decision was based on ?what I think is best for my game at this time.? 

However, Gilbert failed to deny media reports that Roddick had fired him because he did not get along with the player?s father. ?I was completely caught off guard. I couldn?t see any signs that it (the sacking) was coming,? said the flamboyant Gilbert. ?Andy was the boss and it was his decision to make. Tennis is not a team sport. The relationship is between the coach and player and thats the way it should be.? 

Gilbert, who also coached eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi for several years, felt Roddick?s failure to win one of the four majors during the past season could have contributed towards the player?s decision to look elsewhere for advice. 

?Andy?s a tremendous talent,? Gilbert said. ?But (world No. 1 Roger) Federer has really raised the bar very high and it?s up to everyone else to catch up with him. 

?Andy had a pretty good year but for players like (Pete) Sampras, Agassi, Federer and Roddick, a good year is winning one Grand Slam. A great year is winning two. 

?If Andy had won Wimbledon, we?d be looking at his year differently. But I stand by my record with Andy. It was pretty good.? (Reuters)

 Dan Wheldon makes tracks for Formula 1

London: Indy 500 winner and Indy Racing League champion Dan Wheldon could be heading for Formula One next year. 

Wheldons contract with the Honda-powered Andretti Green Racing team expires on Tuesday and SpeedTV.com reported the Briton was set to become a Formula One test driver before landing a race seat in 2007. 

I have not signed a deal with anybody, it quoted the 27-year-old as saying at the weekend. My agent and I have had conversations with F1 teams, thats no secret. 

Wheldons manager Julian Jakobi, who also represents McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya, would not comment on the speculation when contacted. 

Asked if he was heading for Williams, Wheldon told the website: Thats not true. But youre on the right track. 

Williams former engine partners BMW, who will be competing with their own team next year after buying Swiss-based Sauber, have yet to appoint a test and reserve driver. 

BAR, who will be wholly owned by Honda next season, have Briton Jenson Button and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello on long-term contracts. 

Last May, Wheldon became the first British winner of the Indy 500 since Graham Hill in 1966. The victory was worth $1.5 million in prize money. He also won six races in the IRL. 

Red Bull takes over 

Meanwhile, Minardi boss Paul Stoddart handed over his Formula One team to new owners Red Bull after the sale was completed on Monday.

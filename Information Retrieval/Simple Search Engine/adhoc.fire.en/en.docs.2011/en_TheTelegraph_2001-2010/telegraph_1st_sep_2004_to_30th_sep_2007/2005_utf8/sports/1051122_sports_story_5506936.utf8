 Afridi gets one Test, 2-ODI ban 

Faisalabad: The ICC on Monday banned Pakistans allrounder Shahid Afridi for one Test and two one-day Internationals for damaging the pitch during the second day of the second Test against England, said an ICC statement. 

Afridi was charged with a Level 3 offence under clause I of the ICC code which reads: players and/or team officials shall at all times conduct play within the spirit of the game as well as within the laws of cricket. 

All Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of a ban of between two and four Test matches or between four and eight ODIs. Afridis ban of one Test and two ODIs equates a two-Test ban as outlined in note 5.4 of the ICC Code of Conduct. 

Afridi pleaded guilty to damaging the pitch during the second days play in Faisalabad and attended a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama after the days play.

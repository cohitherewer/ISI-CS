The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Justine a meaningful Big W contender

 - Belgian full of confidence and unusually for her, bursting with health 

 ANDREW BAKER IN PARIS 

 Henin-Hardenne (kissing the French Open trophy) is one of the finest servers in the game 

Mary Pierce played a pretty ordinary final, but gave an oration afterwards worthy of the grandest of French occasions. She might have been addressing the crowd at Roland Garros rather than the Academie Francaise, but her eloquence was far more impressive than her tennis. 

Eleven years ago, before her first French Open final, Pierce had spent a sleepless night worrying that her elementary grasp of the language of her adopted country would embarrass her. No such problem on Saturday afternoon, when she was shown up not by her French but by her opponent. 

There had been high hopes for an entertaining final, with Justine Henin-Hardenne, of Belgium, one of the finest servers in the game, facing Pierce, one of the finest returners. 

Henin-Hardenne has been the outstanding player on the Womens Tennis Association Tour over the last couple of months, and goes into Wimbledon, the only Grand Slam that she has yet to win, full of confidence and, unusually for her, bursting with health. 

The Belgian has had a miserable run of injuries and illnesses, but is still just 23 years old and has the potential to achieve many more Grand Slam victories. She put down a meaningful marker in the quarter finals here against Maria Sharapova, who is likely to be one of her strongest rivals at Wimbledon. 

Pierce does not have so many competitive years ahead of her. She did wonderfully well to reach a French Open final 11 years after her first, and like her opponent she has struggled against injury. But there was a powerful sense that the 30-year-old Frenchwoman did not actually expect to win on Saturday, that she was happy to luxuriate in the experience. 

And in the adoration of the crowd. Pierce, who was born in Canada, used to be regarded with some disdain by the Parisians, not least because of her rudimentary French. But she has proved her patriotic credentials through the Fed Cup and the Olympics, and her accent has come on a treat. 

So on Saturday she appeared on court to a deafening support, and accepted her vast bouquet and the attentions of the ballboys in her trademark regal manner. She then won the first game in a way which suggested that she owned the place but then it all fell to bits. Against Lindsay Davenport in the semi-finals, Pierce had played with breathtaking aggression. Against Henin-Hardenne, another power player, she attempted the same tactics but found the lines more elusive. 

The Belgian is not yet restored to full fitness, still suffering from post-viral fatigue, and will probably restrict her summer campaign to The Championships in SW19. I have always said that if there is one Grand Slam to win then it is this one. This is not an easy situation for Mary and there was a lot of pressure for her in front of her home crowd. 

Pierces response was to burst into tears: her emotions are always close to the surface and humiliation in front of a Parisian crowd is not an easy experience. Eventually launched into what sounded like a valedictory address. For Mary, there is not likely to be another final in Paris. Which will spare the rest of us another speech.

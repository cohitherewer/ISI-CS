The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB ready for Fransa

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick says the 0-5 hammering at the hands of Jordan club Al Faisaly will not affect morale in Tuesday?s National Football League for ONGC Cup 15th-round match against Fransa. 

Bhowmick felt the players were tired and reasoned that it?s taking a toll on their game. He opined that Fransa is a good side but that the red-and-golds will go for a win. 

East Bengal had an hour?s practice at the Howrah Stadium on Monday. The glamour outfit are currently placed second, a point behind Dempo (34), but have a game in hand against the Goan leaders. Fransa, meanwhile, are placed fifth with 22 points. 

The two teams were locked goalless in the first phase of the league in Goa and Fransa hope to steal a point at the Salt Lake Stadium as well. They are hoping to encash on East Bengal?s defeat in Jordan. 

East Bengal defender M. Suresh will be sidelined for this match as well.

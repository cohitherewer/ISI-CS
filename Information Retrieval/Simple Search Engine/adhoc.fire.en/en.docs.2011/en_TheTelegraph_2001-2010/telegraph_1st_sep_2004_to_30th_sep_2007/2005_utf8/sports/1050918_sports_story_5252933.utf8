 People forget how old Rooney is: Gascoigne

 - Its not fair relying on a 19-year-old to win games for England

 Gascoigne feels Rooney should be cuddled and looked after a bit more 

Faced with the pressures that accompanied being the most gifted player of his generation, Paul Gascoigne crumpled into an alcoholic shadow of a footballer. On Friday, the man whose natural talent was dissipated by injury, drink, depression and marital problems, appealed for the latest icon of English football to be spared the same burden. 

Wayne Rooneys hair-trigger rage is now starting to cause genuine problems for the club and country as illustrated by the red card he received after sarcastically applauding referee Kim Milton Nielsen during Manchester Uniteds Champions League game against Villarreal. 

He drew all-round flak for his foul-mouthed tirades at David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand and then coach Steve McClaren at Windsor Park as England lost 0-1 to Northern Ireland last week. 

It is that sort of conduct that provoked Fifa president Sepp Blatter earlier this year to suggest that the 19-year-old could do with a clip round the ear, but Gascoigne, who knows more than most about the potential pitfalls of superstar status, disagrees. 

Instead, he believes Rooney should be cuddled and caressed. 

Rooney is a fantastic player who wants to win every game and its his determination that sometimes gets him into trouble, Gascoigne said. 

Unfortunate things like that happened to me many years ago when I had a go at the referee. I did daft things and once got booked for showing a referee the red card. But rules have changed now and if you applaud the ref thats what happens. 

People tend to forget how old Wayne is. It is not fair relying on a 19-year-old kid to win games for England. That should not happen. He should be welcomed, cuddled and caressed and looked after a little bit more. 

Of course, you have to tell him the way to behave as well, but that will take time. It is not going to happen just because he got sent off. If it does not happen with Alex Ferguson then Wayne is a fool to himself because he will get fed up sitting in the stands all the time through suspension. 

A pumped-up Gazza often appeared overwhelmed by the excitement of the big occasion ? such as the FA Cup final in 1991 when personal recklessness caused career-threatening knee damage ? while Rooney always seems to take the high-profile matches in his stride until being enveloped by a red mist and overcome with fury. 

He has to accept people will kick him and wind him up because hes a great player and hell have that for the rest of his life. He has to just get up and smile. He can say yes, you are only trying to kick us because Im the best in the world and that is the way to deal with it. But for me hell be one of the best players ever to come out of England, excluding me! 

Comparisons between the two have been made ever since Rooney burst on to the football scene at the age of 16 with Everton and last night Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added his thoughts as he prepared to send his errant charge into battle at Liverpool on Sunday. 

Wayne is a high profile player, so Im not surprised at the attention, Ferguson said. It happened with George Best, Paul Gascoigne and David Beckham. Its the way of the world. 

A tearful Gascoigne will forever remain synonymous with Englands 1990 World Cup semi-final defeat by West Germany and he reckons greater harmony within the national squad will be needed for Sven-Goran Erikssons players to emulate or better their predecessors endeavours. 

We had world-class players in 1990 just as they have now but with that essential team spirit, England can win it, he continued. 

Chelsea won the title with team spirit and if you have that you are halfway there. If you dont believe me ask Wimbledon players when they won the FA Cup.

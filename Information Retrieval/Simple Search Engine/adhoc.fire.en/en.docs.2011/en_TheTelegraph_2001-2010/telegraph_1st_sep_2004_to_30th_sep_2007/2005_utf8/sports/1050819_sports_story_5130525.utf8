Cincinnati: American Andy Roddick kept fans on the edge of their seats at the Cincinnati Masters on Wednesday night as he fought back from a set down to overcome Spains Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-7, 7-6, 6-2 to reach the third round. 

Earlier, world No. 1 Roger Federer, third seed Lleyton Hewitt and world No. 4 Marat Safin advanced, following three-set struggles, while Guillermo Coria, David Nalbandian and Tim Henman bowed out. 

However, the real drama was saved for the night session as fifth seed Roddick scrambled to a repeat of his win over Ferrero in the 2003 US Open final. 

Now ranked 24th in the world, former No. 1 Ferrero played some of his best tennis since that final almost two years ago, serving superbly and hammering winners from both sides to take the opening set. 

Roddick saved two break points ? one with a lucky net cord ? in the fourth game of the second set. And that proved to be the turning point of the match. 

After taking the set in a tie-break he grew in confidence, finally breaking Ferreros serve in the second game of the decider to cruise to victory. 

I was lucky to get out of that one. He probably played better tonight than he did when we played in the US Open final, said Roddick. 

I definitely felt like he was throwing his best stuff at me for a while and I was kind of just hanging on with my serve, he added. 

Earlier, Federer, playing just his second match since winning his third successive Wimbledon title six weeks ago, managed to beat German Nicolas Kiefer 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 despite a sluggish and inconsistent performance. 

I was struggling in the beginning, looking for my rhythm He didnt really allow me to get the rhythm either. But to turn it around in the end, not playing my best, is always a good feeling, Federer said after setting up a third-round meeting with Belgiums Olivier Rochus. 

Hewitt showed his stomach for a scrap, battling back to beat Greg Rusedski 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. He will face Croatian Mario Ancic, who ousted 16th seed Richard Gasquet of France 6-4, 7-6. 

Fourth seed Safin lost his focus in the second set but recovered to defeat British wild card Andy Murray 6-4, 1-6, 6-1, while sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko also advanced. 

Ninth seed Coria was beaten 4-6, 4-6 by Peruvian Luis Horna. However, Juan Ignacio Chela gave Argentine fans a reason to cheer as he dumped 12th seed Henman 6-4, 6-4. Henman was struggling with a stomach injury. 

The 11th-seeded Nalbandian went down 6-3, 1-6, 2-6 to Chilean Fernando Gonzalez.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sania first Indian to reach final

 - WTA HYDERABAD OPEN 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Sania Mirza acknowledges the cheers from the crowd after her win in Hyderabad on Friday 

Hyderabad: Breaking new grounds is becoming a habit with Sania Mirza these days. If anyone thought her dream Australian Open odyssey was a fluke, she has answered it right here at the SAAP Tennis Stadium, in front of 6,000 screaming home fans. 

At a time and age when Indian tennis winners in top-flight international tournaments don?t come even at a premium, the bubbly teenager is on the threshold of emerging a champion at the age of 18. 

She moved within a match from lifting the WTA Hyderabad Open crown with an absolutely stunning shutout of Maria Kirilenko on Friday afternoon. The Russian, two months younger than Sania and considered talented enough to swell the all-conquering Russian teen brigade, didn?t know what hit her as she surrendered 4-6, 6-7 (4-7) in 100 minutes flat. 

Purely from the statistical angle, this was Sania?s second seeded scalp this week, both over top-100 customers. Kirilenko (world No. 91) was the No. 8 seed, while Sania?s second-round victim Jie Zheng (No. 61) was the fourth seed. With every win, she?s picking up precious points and moving closer to her immediate goal of breaking into the top-100 club. 

And, of course, she became the first Indian woman to reach a WTA Tour event final. And this, in only her fifth appearance in a big tournament. The last Indian to win a Tour title was Leander Paes, way back in1998, at the Hall of Fame meet in New Haven. 

To emulate Leander, Sania will have to clear an Ukrainian hurdle on Saturday. Alyona Bondarenko earned a date with the queen of Hyderabad without hitting a ball. Second seed Anna-Lena Groenfeld, Bondarenko?s semi-final opponent, pulled out following her knee injury in the doubles match (with Martina Navratilova) on Thursday. 

If Sania?s scoreline suggests a close contest, it is far from the truth. Had she not got over-excited at times, the Indian could have won far more convincingly. A poor line call denied her a quicker first set, while back-to-back double-faults, when she was serving for the match at 5-3, pushed the second set to a tie-break. 

Dressed in an all-blue outfit, Sania came out for her first early afternoon match of the week oozing aggression. The ankles had been bothering her, she even had a slight strain on her left thigh which was taped. 

Three games into the match, Sania got rid of her extra baggage, no doubt feeling confident enough in the noisy cauldron to ignore the niggling problems. Three aces (out of a total of eight) and a couple of blazing winners in Sania?s first two service games gave Kirilenko a fair idea of what she was up against, besides a vociferous crowd. 

Everyone?s been talking of Sania?s whiplash forehand, the power of which was felt to some extent by even Serena Williams last month. What she showed on Friday was a powerful double-fisted backhand which can develop into as a potent a weapon as her forehand. 

In the first set, in fact, most of Sania?s winners came off the backhand. Kirilenko, clearly aware of the Indian?s strength, probed her backhand flank only to be caught napping. There were rallies in which Sania was forced to hit six shots off the backhand. She did it with aplomb from the backcourt and often pounced on the first opportunity to go for the kill. 

Sania?s movement on court showed signs of improvement as well. In what was the point of the match, in game seven of the first set, the under-pressure Sania retrieved two unbelievable balls before hitting an amazing half-volley winner.Kirilenko, who shares her first name with the darling of the tennis world, was just not allowed to go for the big shots. A losing finalist here last year, Kirilenko surely has a better game, but on a hot Friday afternoon, she was reduced to an also-ran.

 New cricket body for Kenya

Nairobi: Kenya?s government installed a new cricket body on Thursday in an attempt to end the chaos surrounding the sport. 

Officials said the new body, Cricket Kenya, would take over from the disbanded Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) and prepare the team for their Intercontinental Cup qualifying round match against Namibia on February 22 in Windhoek. 

Minister for sport Ochilo Ayacko installed an 11-man interim committee to run the game. The KCA was disbanded in January following allegations that it was misusing its funds. 

A group of leading players, including former captain Steve Tikolo, refused to play for the national team while the KCA was in charge because of contractual differences. 

Englishman Andy Moles, a former Warwickshire player, also quit as coach last month. 

Bitter feuds involving government and rival cricket officials have blighted Kenyan cricket for several years, undermining the country?s hopes of achieving Test status.

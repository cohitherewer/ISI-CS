 10-shot win for Annika

Stockbridge (Georgia): Annika Sorenstams motivating ambition is to become the first golfer, man or woman to win all four majors in one year. 

The Swede confirmed she was in a class of her own with a 10-shot win at the LPGA meet at Eagles Landing on the outskirts of Atlanta on Sunday. 

Sorenstam has now won six of her lest seven tournaments, and four out five this year. Her six-month unbeaten run came to an end with a tie for 12th in Virginia last week. Sundays win could well mark the start of another long streak. 

In her 12th season on Tour, a repetition of her 2001 win at Eagles Landing enabled her to reach another significant landmark. She joined Patty Berg as a winner of 60 LPGA titles and now only Kathy Whitworth (88) and Mickey Wright (82) have more. 

Sorenstam, who now has 72 wins world-wide, dreams of winning the Grand Slam of majors.

Calcutta: It took Dharamjit Singhs brilliance and Gley Yao Rodrigues opportunism to take Mohun Bagan to seventh heaven at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. 

Tied 1-1 against Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and with the match into stoppage time, Dharamjit cleverly back-headed a Mehtab Hussain corner for a better-placed Rodrigue ? who replaced Dipendu Biswas after change of ends ? to nod in an important goal (his fourth) for the green-and-maroons. It meant Mohun Bagan finished the first leg of the CFL Premier Division with seven wins out of seven. Even the die-hards cant recollect when their team last won so many matches on the trot. 

Amal Duttas men will thus go into Saturdays return leg game against East Bengal with a five-point advantage ? another first in many seasons. 

Manjit Singh, who is pushing Dipendu Biswas further behind with every game in the race to be Rodrigues strike partner, ended Mohun Bagans wait for a goal in the 70th minute. Dharamjit, the livewire in the Mohun Bagan midfield, cut in speedily from the right and let go a grounder, which rebounded off Sandip Guhas chest. It was the CPT custodians only blunder on a day when he stood like a rock in the face of some sustained Mohun Bagan probing. 

The spirited CPT side showed good spirit in the second session and refused to be intimidated by their heavyweight opponents. James Ugwe tested the Mohun Bagan defence with a powerful 20-yard shot which missed the mark narrowly seven minutes into the final session. 

CPT drew level in the 82nd minute, courtesy a perfect Pradip Indu header. As Sandip Ghoshs corner floated into the middle of the penalty box, the CPT striker timed his spot-jump to perfection and the header rocketed into the Mohun Bagan net leaving the defence wide-eyed. 

It was the first goal Mohun Bagan (read: Subrata Pal) had conceded in the league. As his coach said later, there was nothing the goalkeeper could have done to stop that ball. It was a great connection and a rare goal? the scorer deserves high praise, Dutta said. 

The coach was happy to see his team win from a 1-1 situation. This was the first time we were in such a situation this season? it was a test for my team and they came out with flying colours, said Dutta. 

CPT didnt let their fancied rivals run away with the game, true, but Mohun Bagans domination was never in doubt. They should have scored 21 minutes into the game but for a superb piece of defending by Soumen Karmakar. Noel Wilsons 30-yard pass found Dharamjit who wasted little time in crossing the ball for the waiting Manjit and Dipendu. Before any of the strikers could react, the CPT stopper stretched out to kick the ball away. 

Dipendu was hardly in the thick of action, while Manjit put in a lot of effort to complement the medios good work. He had three cracks at goal in the opening 45 minutes, two of which were well thwarted by the CPT keeper. 

Rodrigue made his presence felt soon after coming in. Latching on to a gem of a ball from Mehtab Hussain, the Togolese striker flicked the ball goalwards but it struck the top of the crosspiece and bounced on the goalline before being cleared. 

But Rodrigue, who never tires trying, did have the last laugh.

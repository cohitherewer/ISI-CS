 Sourav made difference, acknowledges Mongia

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Rajkot: Both East Zone coach Paras Mhambrey and North captain Dinesh Mongia admitted Sourav Gangulys presence made the difference in the Duleep Trophy match, which ended on Saturday. 

He hoped the success would rub off on the juniors and help them in the remaining games. 

The following are excerpts from what they had to say: 

PARAS MHAMBREY: I am really happy we have started with a thumping win. I dont regret not being able to gather the bonus point. 

Souravs presence added a lot of weight to the side and I feel his presence helped the juniors to put up a good show in front of the most successful captain of the country. 

I know I will not get Souravs service in the upcoming matches as he will be back in the Indian side any day. But still this performance will give the others confidence for the rest of the matches. 

Our bowlers did exactly what was expected of them. They bowled a nagging line and their consistency was another key factor in this match. 

DINESH MONGIA: We lost three quick wickets yesterday and that I think was the turning point, particularly after having got off to such a good start. 

In the morning, too, we lost wickets at regular intervals. But they (East) deserved to win. 

Particularly Souravs presence made the difference.

 Milan juniors win

Mumbai: The India Under-20 team put up a good show but went down 1-2 to the A C Milan under-18 squad in a football friendly at the Bombay Gymkhana here Saturday. 

All the goals came in the first 45 minutes after which play was mostly confined to the midfield. The Indian outfit dominated play for the major part of the first half, but could find the back of the net only once in the 24th minute through frontliner Shafique. 

The Italian juniors had taken the lead six minutes earlier against the run of play when striker Travaini Enrico nodded in from close range from a pass from the right wing from Vito Francesco Ferdinando. The match winner for A C Milan came in the dying minutes of the first half when Enrico once again rose above the Indian Colts defence to head in an inch-perfect cross from the right by Da Ros Encico.

 Karthikeyan hopes for heavenly help

 Narain Karthikeyan

Suzuka: After a 15th-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Narain Karthikeyan is banking on his past experience and the heavens to open up for another good race as the Formula One World Championship 2005 draws to a close. 

The Japanese Grand Prix, which is the penultimate leg of the championship, gives the Indian another opportunity to make a mark in his rookie year on the circuit. 

I hope I will have another good race in Japan, said Narain who arrived here on Wednesday after spending some time in his hometown Coimbatore. 

All drivers love the track here. I have competed in the Japanese championship and like the place. My experience is that any handling problem will cost you a lot of time on this track, in particular the speed in the esses at the start of the lap are crucially important, the Jordan driver said. 

Just like in Brazil, I am calling for rain here. I hope this time, Ill be heard in time. In Brazil, the rain came two minutes after the chequered flag dropped. That was too late for our Bridgestone tyres. But on Wednesday, I got so wet. We had a good sample of Japanese rain. The weather forecast is 60 per cent rain for tomorrow and also not good weather for the weekend! 

Eager to refresh his memory and do his first walk around the track, Narain headed straight to Suzuka with Jordan track engineers. 

In general, Suzuka is an amazing track. It is one of the most beautiful that we have on the Grand Prix calendar. I love it here, said Narain. 

Everywhere the driver needs a car that changes direction quickly and precisely. It is difficult to get a rhythm but when you do a good lap at Suzuka it feels really, really good. I like racing in Japan, and since its one of the last races of the year, this always adds to the excitement, Narain said. 

The Jordan driver said the Suzuka circuit was hard on the tyres on account of the number of corners it had. Due to high number of corners, Suzuka is very hard on the tyres. Despite a smooth track, it is slightly bumpy in certain areas. 

Indeed, the tyre degradation could be decisive in the race pace. Thats another reason why you need good handling balance, to preserve the tyres as much as you possibly can. 

The Suzuka is a real drivers circuit. It is an old, narrow track with a lot of medium and high-speed corners and very little run-off area where a small driving error could mean the end of the race. 

Narain admitted the track would be demanding but said he was up for it. 

For the drivers it is demanding on the physical side as the corner density is one of the highest of the season, but I am fit as usual. 

Unlike Monza, all the grand-stand seats have been sold out and a record crowd of 100,000 is expected. (PTI)

 Mahesh claims 8th Slam

London: Mahesh Bhupathi clinched his eighth Grand Slam title ? and his first in nearly three years ? when he and Mary Pierce won the mixed doubles event at the Wimbledon Championships on Sunday. 

Bhupathi and Pierce, teaming up for the first time, dismissed the challenge of Aussie Paul Hanley and Ukrainian Tatiana Perebiynis 6-4, 6-2 in a battle between two unseeded teams on Centre Court. The Indo-French pair, playing their second match of the day, took just 54 minutes to seal their triumph. 

They forced an early break in the first set before winning it in 28 minutes. The second set also followed a similar pattern as Bhupathi and Pierce overpowered their opponents making full use of their rich experience. 

For the 30-year-old Bhupathi, this was the third time he emerged victor on the hallowed lawns of the All England Club. He had won the 1999 mens doubles crown with Leander Paes and the 2002 mixed event with Russian Elena Likhovtseva. 

Bhupathi and Pierce had, earlier Sunday, knocked out third seeds Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Lisa Raymond of the US 7-5, 6-1. Hanley and Perebiynis, on the other hand, had ousted fourth seeds Kevin Ullyett (Zimbabwe) and Liezel Huber (South Africa) 6-3, 6-4. 

The womensdoubles crown waswon by Huber and Cara Black of Zimbabwe. They conquered Svetlana Kuznetsova and Amelie Mauresmo 6-2, 6-1. 

Contesting their second Grand Slam final in six weeks after finishing runners-up at Roland Garros, the second seeds produced an immaculate performance with Black in especially impressive form. 

The Zimbabwean, who won the title last year with Australian 

Rennae Stubbs, was once again formidable, dominating from the net and seeing off 

everything that came her way.

 Negi holds GM Alekseev

 - WORLD JUNIOR CHESS 

Istanbul: Istanbul: Indias candidate IM Parimarjan Negi stole Day I honours in the World Junior Chess Championship after holding second-seeded GM Evgeny Alekseev of Russia to a creditable draw. 

Playing the white side of a king pawn game, Negi had little trouble in maintaining the balance, and Alekseev had little choice other than to split the point. 

Many Indians were off to a flier in both the open and girls section on the opening day which also saw top seed and former champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan cruise past Marko Krivokapic of Serbia. 

Among the Indians, GM-norm holder Deep Sengupta played a fine game to outclass Cil Hasan Kivanc of Turkey while G. Rohit and S. Poobesh Anand accounted for Faut Uzun of Turkey and Emil Agdestein of Norway, respectively. 

On the flip side, Akshat Khamparia and national junior champion G. N. Gopal were among those who tasted defeats. Khamparia lost to Mateusz Bartel of Poland while Finnish GM Tomi Nyback outdid Gopal. 

Among girls, WGM Eesha Karavade took off with a fine victory over compatriot N. Raghavi. D. Harika failed to make most of her opportunities and drew with Viktoria Bashkite of Estonia. 

Former Asian junior girls champion Tania Sachdev started off by crushing Sandra Djukic of Serbia. 

Also ending on the winning side was Kruttika Nadig who accounted for Denmarks Marie Frank-Nielsen. (PTI)

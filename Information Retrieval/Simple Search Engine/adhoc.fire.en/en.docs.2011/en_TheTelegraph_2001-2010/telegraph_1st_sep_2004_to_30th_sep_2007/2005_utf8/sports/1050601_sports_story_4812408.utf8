 Im not upset any more: Harbhajan

London: Harbhajan Singh is determined to put the lingering controversy over his bowling action behind him as he prepares to experience English County cricket for the first time. 

The 24-year-old off-spinner from Punjab, who was signed by Surrey last November, was conditionally cleared two days ago by the ICC after being reported in March for throwing his doosra delivery. 

Im not upset anymore, Harbhajan told a news conference after training with Surrey at The Oval on Tuesday. Im happy everything is sorted out now... I dont want to keep mentioning all this. 

I was always confident, added the Punjab spinner, who will make his Surrey debut in a four-day game against Warwickshire starting on Wednesday. 

I hope that this is sorted out for the rest of my life. I just want to play and do whatever I can for the team. 

Im keeping my fingers crossed there will be no further hassles in the future, he added. 

The Indian came close to having his first taste of the County game with Lancashire in 2003, but his plans had top be aborted because of injury. 

Ive always wanted to come play over here (to England) because Ive seen so many guys playing here and learning a lot about their own games, Harbhajan said. 

Hopefully Ill get to learn a lot and Ill be a much better cricketer after playing for Surrey.

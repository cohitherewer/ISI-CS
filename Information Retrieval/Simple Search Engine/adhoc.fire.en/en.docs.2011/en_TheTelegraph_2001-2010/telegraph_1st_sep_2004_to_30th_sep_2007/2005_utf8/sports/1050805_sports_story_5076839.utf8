 Greene predicts US sweep in Helsinki

Helsinki: Former world and Olympic champion Maurice Greene is predicting a US sweep at the World Athletics Championships 100m even though when he is not participating in the race. 

He pulled up lame in the US trials and did not qualify for the 100m here. I really cant see anyone (other than the Americans), especially with the rounds and everything else, pulling it off, said Greene. 

Greene predicted his training partner Leonard Scott to win the race. Obviously he is my first pick, Greene said. Justin Gatlin will get second and Shawn Crawford will get third... a US sweep. 

Olympic gold medallist Gatlin is the odds-on favourite, however, with world record holder Asafa Powell injured. 

He (Gatlin) is a very strong mental competitor, said Greene. He also said he hoped to make the medallists pay over the coming months. 

My job the rest of the season is to make any person who has got a medal to pay for that medal, said the former world record holder. 

Greene has recovered from the hamstring injury he suffered at the US Championships in June and plans to resume 100m running in Zurich on August 19. 

His role at the Championships will be to help US win the 4x100m relay. He most likely will run the second leg with Gatlin on the anchor. 

Its hurtful, Greene said about his absence from the 100m. Well just have to wait until the next World Championships to win.

 Schumi to resume testing next week 

London: Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher will cut short his holiday and resume testing with Ferrari next week, the Formula One team said on Tuesday. 

A spokesman said it would be the first time since 1998 that the German had reported back to work between the end of the season and the New Year but denied there were any special reasons. 

He said to us that he was available and we thought it would be helpful, he said. Its nothing major. 

Schumacher will test in Jerez on December 15 and 16. Ferraris new car is not due to be formally unveiled until the second half of January.

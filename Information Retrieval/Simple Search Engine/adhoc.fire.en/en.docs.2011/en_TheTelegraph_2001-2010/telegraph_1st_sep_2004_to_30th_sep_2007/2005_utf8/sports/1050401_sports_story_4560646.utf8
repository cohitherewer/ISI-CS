 Anand bags title with round to spare

 Anand drew both games vs Svidler 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand won the 14th Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament after he drew with Russian Peter Svidler of Russia in both formats in the 10th and penultimate round here. 

Taking his tally to an unassailable 14.5 points, Anand maintained his huge 3-point lead over Russian Alexander Morozevich and Hungarian Peter Leko with just one round to spare in this euros 193250 prize money tournament. 

Anand has also ensured an unshared blindfold title after the draw as he enjoys a 2-point lead over his nearest rivals Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Svidler and Leko with just one game to go. 

In the rapid section, the Indian ace stretched his lead to a full point over Morozevich and Leko and now needs just half a point to win on the final day for solo title in this section, too. 

The Indian ace needed just 20 moves in the blindfold to sign peace with Svidler who played the black side of a Sicilian Paulsen. 

In the rapid game too, surprisingly, Svidler did not try much playing white after Anand came up with the Rubenstein French. The draw was agreed to in just 22 moves. 

Peter Leko defeated Francisco Vallejo Pons to move to the joint second spot. Playing the black side of a four knights opening by Vallejo in the blindfold, Leko was unimpressed with his opponent?s new idea and peace was signed in 41 moves. In the rapid format, Leko played the English attack with white. Vallejo tried his best to level scores but the Hungarian steered the game to a draw in 67 moves. 

Morozevich first suffered a loss against Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the blindfold after a lop-sided game but was quick to bounce back in the rapid to level scores. (PTI)

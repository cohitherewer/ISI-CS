 Royal Bounty gave armchair to Chisty Chisty 

 STAR RACER

 Jaiswal fired a salvo with an amazing treble on March 1 to put senior professionals such as Daniel David and Vijay Singh in a shade. His day began with son Vinay riding Royal Contender to a well-judged start-to-finish victory to lift the 1,200m Goldspan Handicap. He followed it up with a good gamble on Pipsqueak, who claimed the Dessert Night Handicap. A long-shot in Legendary Lover completed his day?s tally.

 Pipsqeak?s victory was, however, served on a silver salver as the public choice Mega Role planted at the gates, while the second favourite Primaticcio failed to get a judicious riding from Imran Chisty.

 Chisty, however, got an armchair ride on the favourite Royal Bounty in the Shiseido Cup. The horse was brought back from his failed mile missions to the 1,200m trip after a seven-week rest to sharpen up his blunted speed. Chisty allowed Ballet Master to do the running till 300m from home, before taking the matter in his own hand to cruise in excess of five lengths. Joint favourite Karan?s Choice was fourth and seems to be finding the Class II too strong to handle.

 Chisty also cashed in on C. Alford?s poor handling of the 45-100 hot-favourite Allenby in the 1,200m Brogue Handicap. Alford allowed speedsters Common Spirit, Sergeant Slipper and Greenfield a threatening lead and also galloped the favourite on the wide out for no rhyme and reason. It helped the Sergeant steal a march in the stretch run.

 Earlier, similar tactics on Imperial Dynasty had failed Chisty in the 1,200m Huzoor-e-Aala Plate. It helped Alford steer Raging Tide to an impressive victory despite a heavy disadvantage at the weights. With this victory, the Brave Hunter-Loud Water son enhanced his rating as a frontline sprinter and more will be heard of him in coming months.

 Singh brothers, Vijay and Bharath, however, dominated the February 26 race card with a brace each. They also claimed three of the four trophies on offer in the eight-event card. However, they must have rued missing the day?s feature event, the 1,200m H.H. Maharaja Jagaddipendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur of Cooch Behar Memorial Cup that was lifted by Javed Khan?s strongly-fancied horse Say It Loud ? who virtually gave jockey Mark Reuben an armchair ride.

 The ageing No Louder-Fashion Graduate son was right on his task from the start of the race. He chased the early leader El Condor and also allowed Corvino to shoot upfront until 150m from the winning-post. He swooped onto the leader to seal the issue. Annabee may have been a trifle unlucky as the filly unsuccessfully tried to bisect the battling duo 200m from home but found no galloping room. Alford, however, had cruised home with Bharath?s Alarico in the opener, the 1,400m Supernova Cup.

 Bharath was in luck as his Small Fry took a smart jump out to win the 1,400m Illuminate Handicap. In her previous start, the five-year-old mare had planted as a favourite.

 Vijay?s Arakawa won the Police Commissioner?s Cup over 1,400m in spite of his expanding odds, which were taken as a negative signal. The Tecorno-Summer Honey son also took a slow start but Alford nursed him well till the halfway mark before deciding to make his winning bid. He won untroubled, though the one-length winning verdict may not suggest so.

 Vijay?s Maricopa (S. Shanker up) was, however, lucky when Chisty on Exotic Strides offered him a wide galloping room along the rails in the Adda-Rossa Cup. The third-placed Rebelwithacause could have finished closer to the winner had he not hung-out when the heat was on.

 Lady Luck also favoured Chisty on Simply Sensational to win the 1,100m Portofino Cup from Pay Check whose rider, apprentice Gajender Singh, look uninterested to beat his stablemate. Only a neck separated the two Daniel-trainees.

 However, apprentice Shane Domingo was not so lucky. He made a blatant effort to stop Sanjeev Charan?s fancied horse, Positive Thinker, from winning the Camlin Handicap ? claimed by Moira. Domingo was stood down for seven-weeks for his heroics.

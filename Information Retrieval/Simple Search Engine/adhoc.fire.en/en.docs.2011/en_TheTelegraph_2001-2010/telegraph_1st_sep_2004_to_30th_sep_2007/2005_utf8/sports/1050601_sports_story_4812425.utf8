 Federer, Nadal set up classic clash

 - Henin-Hardenne overpowers Sharapova Pierce humbles Davenport 

 HEART OF THE MATTER: About 200 ball boys and girls form a heart at Roland Garros Centre Court in a show of support for Frances 2012 Olympic Games bid before the start of the quarter final matches on Tuesday 

Paris: France took Mary Pierce to its heart on Tuesday when the 30-year-old crushed world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 6-2 to reach the French Open semi-finals. 

Its crazy, said Pierce after receiving a standing ovation from the Roland Garros crowd. 

I have just beaten the world No. 1 in straight sets... I need a bit of time to realise what I have done. 

Joining Davenport at the exit was second seed Maria Sharapova who was pounded 4-6, 2-6 by Justine Henin-Hardenne, ending the Russians hopes of taking the world No. 1 spot. 

Pierce, champion here in 2000, will play Elena Likhovtseva for a place in the final after the Russian beat Bulgarian 15-year-old Sesil Karatantcheva 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. 

In the mens quarter-finals, top seed and world No. 1 Roger Federer swept past Romanias Victor Hanescu 6-2, 7-6, 6-3 to set up what could be one of the great matches of 2005. 

The Swiss now faces Rafael Nadal, the king of clay this season, after the 18-year-old crushed fellow-Spaniard David Ferrer 7-5, 6-2, 6-0. 

Nadal is bidding to become the first player to win the claycourt Grand Slam at the first attempt since Mats Wilander in 1982. Like Henin-Hardenne, he has won 22 straight matches. 

Top seed Federer, whose previous best result on the Paris clay was a quarter-final appearance in 2001, became the second active player (after Andre Agassi) to have reached the last-four stage at four consecutive Grand Slam events. 

Being in the semi-finals for the first time here is great, said the Swiss who is yet to drop a set. Im very satisfied with my game and my form so far. I feel I have plenty of energy left. 

The elegant Swiss after winning the first set easily, underlined his determination by fighting back from a break down in the second to force a tie-break, which he took 7-3 with a service winner on set-point. 

World No. 90 Hanescu, 23 like Federer, mounted a brave challenge in that second set but then collapsed, Federer building a 5-1 lead in the third set to serve for the match. 

Federer showed signs of nerves for the first time, wasting two match-points and losing his serve after committing three double-faults. 

When he served for the match again, Hanescu survived another match-point before bowing out by hitting a forehand long after just over two hours of play. 

Wimbledon champion Sharapova stayed with Henin-Hardenne for the first six games but had no answer to the former world number ones weight of shots and folded in the second set. 

It went well, I am reaching a crescendo in the tournament, Henin-Hardenne, the 2003 champion, said. 

The most important thing is to win matches without playing your best tennis... I did that. 

The Belgian, conqueror of US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round, faces her third consecutive Russian ? Nadia Petrova ? for a place in Saturdays final. Petrova stopped the surprise run of 17-year-old Serbian Ana Ivanovic 6-2, 6-2. 

 The important thing is not to think the hard work has been done, Henin-Hardenne said. The 10th seed had won all three of her claycourt warm-up tournaments. Petrova will be eyeing Henin-Hardenne warily ? the Belgian has beaten Russians in the finals of her last three tournaments, most recently Petrova in Berlin where she also beat Sharapova, squaring their head-to-head record 1-1. 

Sharapova received $135,600 for her efforts but knew she had finished second best. You hit a big shot and she can come up with a heavier shot, with a tougher shot, closer to the line, the Russian said. She made great drop-shots at very important points and that just comes with confidence, having played a lot of matches. 

Shes on a big winning streak. I think that is giving her more and more confidence. 

Sharapova now heads for greener pastures to tune her grasscourt game as she prepares to defend her Wimbledon crown next month. 

I dont have any pressure at all, she said. Im gonna have so many great memories again... to be back on grass and playing where I feel really, really comfortable. 

Petrova was never worried by 17-year-old Ivanovic who was making her French Open debut. The Serb had won her share of the limelight on the Paris clay, notably with a third-round defeat of local favourite Amelie Mauresmo, but was never in contention on Tuesday. 

Likhovtseva made heavy weather of Karatantcheva before booking her first Grand Slam semi-final place in 46 attempts. I was nervous... I was nervous, she smiled. 

The 29-year-old resorted to slow, looped groundstrokes to keep the ball in play against an opponent almost half her age. 

I know it was ugly but, you know, I still won the match, she laughed. 

Mahesh-Lisa out 

Mahesh Bhupathis campaign ended on Tuesday following a disappointing loss in the mixed doubles. He and American partner Lisa Raymond lost 4-6, 2-6 to Jonas Bjorkman (Sweden) and Anastasia Myskina (Russia). 

Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge had earlier tumbled out of the mens doubles in the first round itself.

 Sania scales six rungs

New Delhi: A fruitful outing in Cincinnati last week propelled Sania Mirza to a career-best 64th place in the latest WTA Entry Points rankings list released on Monday. 

Sania climbed up six places from her previous best of No. 70 after she reaching the quarter finals of the Tier III event, where she bowed out to Akiko Morigami of Japan. 

The Indian tennis sensation, who first reached No. 70 on May 23, had slipped to 75th after a six-week injury lay-off, but regained the spot after her impressive show at Wimbledon. 

There was no change among the top four, with Lindsay Davenport still leading the rankings, followed by Maria Sharapova, Amelie Mauresmo and Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

Belgian Justine Henin-Hardinne, however, moved up two spots to No. 7 

Meanwhile, Roger Federer stayed on top of the ATP Entry Points standings, even as Rafael Nadal and Lleyton Hewitt traded places, the Spaniard moving up one place to No. 2.

 Westerner claims Gold Cup 

 London: Westerner, the 7-4 favourite trained in France and ridden by Olivier Peslier, won the Ascot Gold Cup in York on Thursday.

 Westerner collared 33-1 outsider Distinction, the mount of Johnny Murtagh, in the closing stages of the two and a half mile marathon to win by a neck.

 Third place in the 17-strong field, a further five lengths away, went to Irish raider Vinnie Roe (9-2), ridden by Pat Smullen.

 Last years winner Papineau, racing for the Godolphin team of Sheikh Mohammed, finished last but one.

 It was a sixth win in a row for Westerner, who is trained by Elie Lellouche for the Wildenstein family, but the first victory by a French raider since 1977.

 Peslier told BBC TV: He has a good turn of foot (speed), but the second was doing well too and we had a fight with him.

 Owner Alec Wildenstein said of Westerner: He has achieved all that you can ask and has won his last six races. He is a really wonderful horse.

 The Gold Cup is the traditional highlight of Ladies Day at Royal Ascot that is being staged 350 km away at York this year while redevelopment work continues at the Berkshire track.

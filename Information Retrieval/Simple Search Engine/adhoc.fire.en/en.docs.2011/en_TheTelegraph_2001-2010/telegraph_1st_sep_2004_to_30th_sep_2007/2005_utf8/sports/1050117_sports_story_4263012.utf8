 Orissa aim to move up

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Orissa are looking to assure themselves of a berth in the main round of the national one-day meet with a win versus Assam at Eden Gardens on Monday. 

Orissa have nine points from two matches while Bengal are ahead with 12 from three games. 

Two teams will qualify for the main round from East Zone. 

?It?s a very important game for us and we have a decent chance of topping the zone. The positive aspect is that we have started our campaign on a positive note,? former India opener Shiv Sundar Das said on Sunday. 

 Rashmi Ranjan Parida twisted his 

 ankle during practice this afternoon, but Mohanty is hopeful 

 he will be available on Monday. 

 Paul doubtful 

Shib Shankar Paul, who suffered a side strain during Bengal?s match against Assam on Saturday, is doubtful against Orissa.

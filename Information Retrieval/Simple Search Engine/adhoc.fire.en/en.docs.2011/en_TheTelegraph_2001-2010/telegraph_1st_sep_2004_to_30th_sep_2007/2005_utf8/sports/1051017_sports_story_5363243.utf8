The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im surprised people in India have forgotten Souravs contribution as captain

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE ENGLAND START FAVOURITES, ACCEPTS PAKISTAN CAPTAIN INZAMAM 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Sydney: Inzamam-ul Haq has been one of crickets tallest figures for some years now. The Pakistan captain, who is in town for the Super Test, spoke to The Telegraph for over half an hour in his Four Seasons Hotel room the other evening. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Post-India, how much time did it take you to have your feet back firmly on the ground? 

A Almost straightaway... Im happy we did well (drawing the Test series and winning the ODIs) on what was a critical tour... Mere liye bhi critical tha... Actually, you can never dwell on one series for too long... It becomes history when the next begins. For us, it was in the West Indies. 

After the West Indies, it has been a big break for Pakistan... 

Absolutely, and its a source of worry for me... A lay-off for four-five months is, nowadays, unthinkable... I wouldnt have been so worried had at least first-class cricket been on back in Pakistan. 

What did you learn from the tour of India? 

Handling pressure better... The more relaxed, the better the decisions... Also, that its not necessary to have big names... Everybody had written off my team when we left Pakistan, yet returned to a red carpet welcome. The biggest lesson has to be the importance of playing as a unit. 

Those who did well have been rewarded with better contracts... 

Thats fair. If you perform, rewards must follow. 

Given that the next series is against England, did you watch all the Ashes Tests? 

I had to... I saw some of the Ashes in England and, then, the rest on TV. It was close and, if you ask me, both teams played good cricket. 

What are your expectations from the series versus England? 

Bahut accha khelna pade ga... Bahut mehnat karni pade gi... Englands confidence will be high and, talking realistically, they have the proper combination. I think England start favourites. 

How is that confidence to be dented? 

By playing positively... More important, all 11 have to contribute. One or two players wont be able to swing it for us. 

Are you going to have a say in the preparation of wickets? 

Well, a home team only has one advantage ? wickets... Danish Kaneria has been our main bowler for the past year and we intend giving him wickets which will offer assistance. At the same time, the wickets wont be such that the quicks have to despair. After all, if Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed are fit and available, then our opening attack wont be without teeth. 

Is there the possibility of Mushtaq Ahmed being recalled? 

The selectors are going to take a decision, but its possible... Mushtaq has plenty of experience and did well for Sussex this summer (80 first-class wickets)... Im not in favour of blooding anybody in a series of such pressure as the pressure could get to him. Experience is useful. 

How is your own mental preparation going? 

The focus will be more once this Super Test is over... Being the captain, my own preparation cant be found wanting. 

Whats your take on Michael Vaughans captaincy? 

Englands results in the past two-plus years have been very good and, clearly, Vaughan has to get most of the credit. Kaptani zabardaast tarike se kari hai. 

And, Duncan Fletchers role? 

For any team to be successful, its important for the coach and captain to complement each other... They have to be on the same wavelength when it comes to getting the best out of the players. 

Bob Woolmers appointment as coach, 16 months ago, was greeted with scepticism in some quarters. Yet, he has been a hit... 

Because of the difference in culture, it took time for Bob and I to understand each other... A coach has to be friendly and Bob has succeeded because hes just that. The players dont feel uncomfortable going to him.. Hes quick to understand the problem and is quicker in reassuring. The bonding is good and the trust solid. 

What was your reaction to the Sourav Ganguly-Greg Chappell showdown? 

(Smiles) Aap mujhe koi controversy mein nahin daliye. 

Thats not my intention... 

(Smiles again) Well, whatever is discussed in the dressing room should stay behind closed doors... Otherwise, the teams image gets affected. 

The Younis Khan-Shahid Afridi row got leaked in the West Indies... 

It wasnt such a big thing but, yes, ought not to have happened. It hurt the Pakistan teams reputation. 

Youve always rated Sourav very highly as captain. Will he be able to make a comeback as a player, at least? 

Why not? He got a Test hundred in Zimbabwe and Test hundreds dont come easy... Im surprised people in India have forgotten Souravs contribution as captain... Paanch saal kaptani karna aasan nahin hai... And, then, India won a number of Tests overseas under him. Perhaps, his own batting suffered because he had to think too much about the team. 

Whats your advice for Sourav? 

The same as what Imranbhai told me some years ago: Relax and get back to the basics if the pressure gets too much... 

Youve yourself gone through tough periods. Does relaxing come easy? 

No, but one doesnt have a choice. 

Why was there so much of confusion over your coming for the Super Test? 

Because of a miscommunication from the Pakistan Cricket Board. (After a pause) Incidentally, I have a back problem and have been advised to take a break between long flights... 

But werent you upset at being overlooked for the ODIs and coming into the Test squad only as Sachin Tendulkars replacement? 

No... The World XI selectors had the right to choose the squad they thought would deliver. 

Surely, the passion hasnt been there in the Super Series... 

But thats not possible... Playing for your country is very, very different aur woh inner feeling World XI ke liye nahin aa sakti... Then, cricket is a team game and the effort, too, has to come from everybody not one or two of the big names. 

The last question: Is Shoaib going to be back against England? 

Let me clarify that I dont have a problem with Shoaib... If hes fit, its in my interest (as captain) to have him in the XI... He looks fit and bowled reasonably in Melbourne. However, he has to return home and play the practice first-class matches. (Again, after a pause) I dont see myself as being bigger than anybody simply because Im the captain.

 Rupesh Roy misses US Open cut

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rupesh Roys world ranking has improved significantly since he left for the US five months ago, but its not enough to give him a direct entry to the US Open boys singles event. 

The 16-year-old was around 350 when he began his association with the Bosse Foundation in Boston. The current ITF junior rankings has him at world No. 105, the big jump facilitated by three tournament triumphs ? including a double crown at the grade III ITF junior meet in Botswana last month. But he still cant get into the main draw of the US Open as its a field of 32. 

According to a communication from Bosse Foundation director Steve Host, Rupesh will play an ITF junior grade I event in Kentucky, followed by two senior Futures meets and an ATP Challenger in September-October. Hell close out the year by taking part in the Orange Bowl and Eddie Herr junior meets.

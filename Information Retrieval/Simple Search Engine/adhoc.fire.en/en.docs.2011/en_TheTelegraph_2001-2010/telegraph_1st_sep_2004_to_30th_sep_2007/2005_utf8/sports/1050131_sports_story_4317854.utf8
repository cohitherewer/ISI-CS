 SBT to bank on home advantage

Kozhikode: State Bank of Travancore (SBT) will keep up with their attacking style when they take on defending champions East Bengal in the ONGC National Football League match at the Corporation Stadium here on Tuesday, SBT coach Mohammed Najeeb said on Sunday. 

?Being the only representative from the South, SBT will concentrate more on promoting the sport by continuing to engage in attacking game in the three home matches,? Najeeb told reporters. 

Collecting four points from as many matches with one win, one draw and two losses in the fourth round in Margao, SBT will take on Tollygunge Agragami (February 6) and Churchill Brothers (February 12) in the other two matches here. 

The coach felt that though lacking in tournament experience, SBT would, however, go into the matches with the home advantage. 

Star players Naushad and Asif, who were injured, were fast recovering and their participation in the match against East Bengal would be decided at a meeting on Monday, he added. 

East Bengal, meanwhile, are on a high from their satisfactory result in the Goa leg. Despite the absence of foreign imports, Brazilian Douglas da Silva and Nigerian Ernest Jeremiah, the red and gold outfit is expected to do well. And with Bhaichung Bhutia finding the target against Vasco, coach Subhas Bhowmick should be breathing a bit easy. 

Meanwhile, Najeeb said that only Kerala teams have continued with the policy of not including foreign players in the National League, which the All India Football Federation has now come to realise. 

They have now reduced the number of foreigners in the League from four to three, he remarked. (PTI)

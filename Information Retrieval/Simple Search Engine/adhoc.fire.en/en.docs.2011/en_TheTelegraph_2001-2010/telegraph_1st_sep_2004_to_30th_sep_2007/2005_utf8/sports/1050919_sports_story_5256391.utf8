 Paes stresses on Team India show

 - Davis Cup Whoever is ready, I will let him play 

 For Paes, representing the country is most important 

New Delhi: Leander Paes on Sunday said Indias Davis Cup campaign was not a one-man show anymore and that the team now had the players who could step up and take the responsibility in all departments of the game. 

The Indian captain said he still had it in him to go through the rigours of playing three rubbers against a top level team but the teams fortunes were not dependent on an individual and there were players qualified enough to stand up to the challenge. 

Paes will be playing in his 38th tie when he leads India against Sweden in the World Group play-off here from Friday. He is the most successful Davis Cup player in contemporary tennis, and his 74-30 overall win-loss record is joint eighth in the all-time list. 

Thats the task (to be prepared physically). When you are playing an Asian team, it is physically demanding. But when you play a world level team like Sweden, it is physically demanding and more than that, said Paes, who had dislocated his shoulder in the French Open mixed doubles final. 

We have got boys who have been playing on tour consistently, who have got the results. Rohan Bopanna has come back from biceps surgery and shown good results. We have players who can play in the singles. 

It is not going to be a Leander show, it is Team India. In Jaipur (against Uzbekistan), I could have played the last singles, and it would have been 16th or 17th tie where I had played three rubbers. But it is not about an individual. 

If I make the right decision, I will be doing it for Team India. 

With the R. K. Khanna Stadium grasscourts still wet due to heavy rains over the last few days, Paes had a rigorous workout with Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj on the adjacent hardcourts at the DLTA complex this afternoon. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, the other member of the team, will join on Tuesday while reserve player Harsh Mankad is to arrive Monday. 

Paes said he would not shy away from any challenge thrown at him. 

It is a question of whether I am fully prepared to take 15 sets and still play at the best of my ability on the last day. I have never shied away from responsibility, I am not a shy boy, the captain said. 

At the same time, if there is anybody ready, I will let him play. I will consult the stalwarts in the team, it will be a consensus decision. 

Paes said the controversy over appointing Mankad, the highest-ranked Indian on the ATP Tour, as the reserve player would not hinder the teams preparations. 

I look at the positive side. My prerogative was to speak to the player, which I have done, Paes said about Mankad who had issued an ultimatum of sorts, demanding a playing spot in the team. 

For me the most important thing about Davis Cup is representing the country. We know Harshs pedigree. Both his father and mother were national players and they know what it is to represent India. 

That is what Mankad understood. He is a good boy, and we all have to make decisions in difficult situations. 

Paes felt Mahesh Bhupathi still had few more years of tennis left in him. 

I think he could still play a few more years. He is one of the best doubles players but we cannot judge on how his body and shoulder feels. 

As far as I am concerned, he is the pillar of my team. He is very much welcome to be part of my team.Assessing Swedens strength, Paes said they had a couple of players who could do well on grass but hardcourts were their forte. (PTI)

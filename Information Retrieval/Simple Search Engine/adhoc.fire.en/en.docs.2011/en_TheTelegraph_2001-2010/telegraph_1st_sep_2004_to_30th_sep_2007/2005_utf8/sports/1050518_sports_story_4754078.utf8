 Karachi on proposed venue list

Islamabad: Indias reluctance to play a Test in Karachi during their last tour notwithstanding, the Pakistan Cricket Board has proposed the port city along with Lahore and Rawalpindi as Test venues for the next years series between the arch-rivals. 

Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Faisalabad and Multan have been proposed by PCB to India as the venues for the five one-dayers, a local daily reported on Tuesday. 

India did not play Tests in Karachi and Peshawar during their last tour. Both the centres had instead staged a one-dayer each. 

India is scheduled to visit Pakistan in January next year, their second tour of the country since 2004. 

The newspaper, however, said the board could shift the Rawalpindi Test to Faisalabad if it did not get control of the Pindi Cricket Stad- ium. 

The PCB, which is not satisfied with the functioning of the Pindi Stadium management, is trying to take control of the Stadium.

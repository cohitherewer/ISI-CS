 Symcox slams SA?s ?shocking cricket?

 Symcox wants an immediate discussion on the situation 

Durban: Pat Symcox has slammed South Africa for playing ?a shocking brand of cricket? and called for wide-ranging discussions to analyse what is wrong with the team. 

?Get all of us into a room and let?s discuss a way forward for South African cricket. We want to discuss cricket and not politics,? said the former Test cricketer-turned-commentator after South Africa saved the second Test against England by the skin of their teeth. 

South Africa were on the verge of defeat with eight 

wickets down and another hour-and-a-half of play to go when the umpires offered 

the light to the host team. 

Symcox, who resigned as a selector after a spat with 

the UCBSA, said it was a sad development that South Africa had slipped from No. 

2 to No. 6 in the world rankings. 

?It?s pathetic to see the way this team is performing. There?s a feeling that they have no plan, there?s no urgency and there?s a lack of direction. 

?We need to discuss the situation as soon as possible. We have people like Kepler Wessels, Barry Richards and Allan Donald... At our doorstep to discuss the selection policy, the selectors, the coach, the management team and even captaincy. ?At the moment we are playing a shocking brand of cricket.?

Rio de Janeiro: Brazil scraped a 1-0 World Cup qualifying win over Peru with a performance which their own coach said lacked inspiration while sharp-shooting Ecuador thumped Paraguay 5-2 on Sunday. 

Antonio Valencia, 19, playing his first competitive international, and Edison Mendez scored twice apiece, all from long range, as Ecuador came from two goals down in Quito. 

Argentina (25 points from 12 games) and world champions Brazil (23) pulled further away from the pack in the 10-nation South American qualifying group this weekend. 

Ecuador (19) also put daylight between themselves and the other teams while only three points separate fourth-placed Paraguay (16) and ninth-placed Peru. 

Uruguay (15), Colombia, Chile and Venezuela (all 14) are squeezed in between while bottom-placed Bolivia (10) appear to be out of the running. 

Brazil striker Ronaldo squandered his side?s two best first-half chances and blamed the heat for his display. He atoned in the 74th minute when he slipped a pass through for Kaka to score the winner with his fifth goal of the qualifiers. 

Brazil had not scored in their two previous qualifiers against Colombia and Ecuador. The goal was their first in four hours 29 minutes of competitive football. 

Meanwhile, violence reared its ugly head in Africa?s World Cup qualifying campaign when a riot brought a premature end to Mali?s home match with Togo in Bamako on Sunday. 

The game was abandoned amid chaotic scenes as thousands of spectators invaded the pitch after Togo went 2-1 ahead in the 90th minute to keep up with the leaders in group I. 

A last-minute goal from Togo?s Souleymane Cherif Maman set off the crowd as the result left Mali stuck at the bottom of the group with two points. (Reuters)

 Paes has always done the right thing: Vijay

 India urgently need to develop grasscourt players, feels Amritraj 

Jaipur: Vijay Amritraj wears many hats. While his deeds on the court qualify him as a commentator on Indian tennis, the Chennai native slips through various roles as if he were changing costumes ? one time the owner of a media firm in the US, at other times the UN ambassador for peace. 

And then, he is also the founding member of a leading chain of hotels besides being a director on the board of an airlines company. In between criss-crossing various time zones, he also finds time to be father and coach of a son keen to follow in his tennis footsteps. 

?Well, I told (son) Prakash that I am doing two jobs for him, that of the father and the coach. And that he has to choose between the two. The one thing that I can?t give up he knows,? he put it in his inimitable style when asked about the double duty he does for his 22-year-old son. 

The scene is Jai club, venue for India?s Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan, and the conversation turns to the topic of the day: Leander Paes nominating himself ahead of Harsh Mankad to play the singles. 

?It?s his call. Leander has always done the right thing. Obviously he felt Harsh was the best choice against China and felt himself the right person to do the job against the Uzbeks. Leander has looked at India?s chances, rather than his own or any other player,? he said. 

But Paes? decision, to push himself to play probably three matches at the age of 32, also denotes to a lack of grasscourt players in India. Except for Prakash, most contemporaries are baseliners, preferring to stand back instead of attacking the net. 

So, how long will India enjoy the grass advantage? 

?Yes, it remains to be seen. We urgently need to develop grasscourt players,? Amritraj says. But then there are no grasscourt tournaments in India. 

?At the end of the day, we need players who can do well on the international stage. We have Prakash, Harsh and Karan Rastogi doing well at the moment, and a couple of juniors also coming up.? 

The men?s tennis lacks a spark as it has happened for women?s tennis through Sania Mirza. 

?Well, it has to come from the players. Eventually it boils down to the final result, the players need to get better.? 

Has the split between Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, who were once No. 1 in doubles and won three Grand Slams together, had an adverse affect? Could little things like an Olympic medal have made a difference? 

?Success is always a nice thing, no matter in what form they come or where they come,? says Amritraj. (PTI)

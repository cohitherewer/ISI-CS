 PCB may demand $50,000 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board on Wednesday said 

it was contemplating demanding $50,000 from the BCCI for playing an additional 

one-day International on their recent visit. 

Pakistan, who won the series 4-2, were scheduled to play only five matches but an extra fixture was added to the itinerary to accommodate Ahmedabad as a venue. 

The PCB said that when they acceded to the BCCI?s request they did so on the hope that one more ODI could be fixed on reciprocal basis when India toured Pakistan next time. But with a tight international schedule, that seems unlikely. Hence the demand for the lump sum. 

?We are thinking about claiming an amount of $50,000 from the Indian board as appearance fees for the additional match as per the regulations of the ICC?s Future Tours Programme,? a PCB official said.

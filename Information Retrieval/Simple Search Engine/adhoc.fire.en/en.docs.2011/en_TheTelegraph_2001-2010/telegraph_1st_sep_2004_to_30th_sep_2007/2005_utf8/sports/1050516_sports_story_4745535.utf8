 Ramu steals Ethiopians 

thunder

Bangalore: Services runner K.C. Ramu stole the limelight by winning the mens race ahead of the fancied Ethiopians in the inaugural Bangalore Marathon on Sunday. 

The Pune Army Sports Institute runner finished the gruelling race in 2 hours and 23.46 minutes, beating back the challenge of Ethiopian duo Abebe Seyoum (2:28.37) and Tegayae Desalgne (2:33.10) in the 42.195 km race. 

Tesfaye Bayu Orgawa, another Ethiopian who was tipped to take the top spot, finished fourth in 2:35.34. That was way beyond his personal best of 2:16.45. 

Despite the presence of a big Ethiopian contingent, the event failed to attract the real big names. The standard was understandably low. 

A delighted Ramu, who was the Indian winner in the first Mumbai Marathon in 2004, attributed his victory to hard work. 

Ethiopians, however, swept the top three positions in the womens full marathon. Marashet Jimma (2:45.34) was the fastest, followed by Adanech Beyene (2:47.04) and Korre Alemu (3:03.47). 

Indian men and women dominated the half-marathon (21.097 kms).

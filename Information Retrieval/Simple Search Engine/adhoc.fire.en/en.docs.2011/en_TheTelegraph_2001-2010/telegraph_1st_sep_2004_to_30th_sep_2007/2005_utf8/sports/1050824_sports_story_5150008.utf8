 Surya signs off with victory

 - ABU DHABI CHESS 

 Surya finished at 13th place 

Abu Dhabi: Indian Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly scored a comprehensive victory over Russian GM Mikhail Ulibin in the ninth round to finish 13h in the Masters section at the 15th Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival that concluded here on Tuesday. 

GM Ashot Anastasian of Armenia (7) won the title after playing a quick draw with GM Alexei Federov of Belarus. Grandmaster Dmitry Bocharov of Russia defeated Ukrainian GM Alexander Goloshachapov. 

Bocharov and Uzbekistans IM Sergey Kayumov tied for the second spot scoring 6.5 points each while Surya Sekhar finished 13th with six points. The Calcutta-based GM yet again showcased his superior end-game technique to outplay Ulibin in black. 

Surya Sekhar got an advantage in the opening itself and nurtured it well to win a pawn. Timely trading of queens led to a difficult endgame for black. He wrapped up the issue in 55 moves after tying black pieces to passive defence. 

IM D.V. Prasad finished on 5.5 points after settling for another draw with the Russian GM Sergey Grigoriants. 

Abhijit Gupta was on the receiving end against third seed and former Russia champion Sergei Volkov. Parimarjan Negi grounded Mesgen Amanov of Turkmenistan in a fine game with black pieces. 

Akshat Khamparia and Krutika Nadig went down to GM Stefan Djuric of Serbia and Meilis Annaberdiev of Turkmenistan, respectively. 

M.B. Muralidharan drew with Sergei Simonenko of Turkmenistan while Tania Sachdev shared the point with Elshan Moradiabadi of Iran. (PTI)

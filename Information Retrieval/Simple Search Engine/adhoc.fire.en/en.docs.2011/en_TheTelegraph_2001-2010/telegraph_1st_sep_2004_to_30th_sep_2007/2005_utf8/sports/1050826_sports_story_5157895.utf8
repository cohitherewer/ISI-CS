Calcutta: Seven matches into the new season, the red-and-golds continue to look a faded version of the team which carved a niche for themselves in the last four seasons. 

East Bengals latest exhibition of drabness and mediocrity came on an overcast Thursday against George Telegraph. Subhas Bhowmicks men did win 2-0, to finish their CFL Premier Division first-leg engagements with 16 points, but the scoreline often hides more than what it reveals. 

That ageless wonder by the name of I.M. Vijayan gave East Bengal fans enough reasons to get excited about. 

He was at the right place at the right time to nod in Syed Rahim Nabis cross in the 11th minute. 

Vijayan also came up with some delectable touches including the games two best passes ? both of which went unutilised. The first, a clever back-heel, foxed the George defender as well as Vijayans teammate (Sandip Das), who seemed to be on a different wavelength. 

Then came a defence-piercing through pass which Shylo Malsawmtluanga got hold of, only to see his shot being palmed away by Chinmoy Banerjee. 

On the wrong side of the thirties, Vijayan can only operate from a restricted zone. But his very presence for about 80 minutes seemed to send shivers down defenders spines. 

Malsawmtluanga, who worked up a decent chemistry with Vijayan, was a bundle of energy up front. Twice he got over-excited and failed to put the ball on target from scoring positions but made amends four minutes from full time. 

A quick move through the right channel saw Jayanta Sen laying the ball square for Malsawmtluanga, who spotted the goalkeeper out of position and quickly fired the ball in through the near post. 

Nabi put in some effort as well, but there wasnt much to write home about beyond that. 

What stood out like a sore thumb was East Bengals woeful bench-strength. Its something Bhowmick nurtured carefully the last three seasons and benefited immensely as well. But on a day when he was without regulars like Alvito DCunha, Debjit Ghosh and Jatin Bisht, the midfield resembled a patch of barren land. 

And to think East Bengal were playing against a team which doesnt have a point in their kitty after five games! Not only did George contain their famed rivals, they threatened to score more than once. 

In fact, they could have neutralised Vijayans early strike had Nigerian striker Chibuzus right-footed placement not rebounded off the base of the post.

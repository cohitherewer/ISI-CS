 Were looking at a team for the future: More

 - What Rahul Dravid and the chief selector had to say about the former captains exclusion 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: It was Team India captain Rahul Dravid who first came for the post-match press conference at the Kotla on Wednesday. He was followed immediately by the chairman of the selection committee, Kiran More. Here is what both had to say on Sourav Ganguly-specific questions: 

RAHUL DRAVID 

Q Your thoughts on Souravs performance in the Delhi Test 

A He played well... Forty-odd runs in both innings. Im sure he will be disappointed that he didnt go on and get a bigger knock. But Sourav and Yuvraj (Singh) had a crucial partnership in the second innings. 

Q Has Virender Sehwags fitness and Yuvrajs unbeaten 77 put the selectors in a dilemma? 

A Its a happy problem to have, if you call it a problem at all. It may be unfortunate that someone is going to miss out but thats how international cricket is. More importantly, it also shows that we can call on two-three players (for one slot) at different times and it gives us a lot of heart. 

Q Did you express your views to the selectors? 

A Yes, I did. 

Q Did you want the winning squad to be retained for Ahmedabad? 

A Its for the selectors to decide who will be in the squad and who will not be there. 

KIRAN MORE 

Q Why was Sourav dropped? 

A The selectors situation was that we didnt want Ganguly at No. 6, because Yuvraj will play there. We are looking at the future. We felt we have a player who has been playing better. Yuvraj performed exceedingly well in the ODI series and in this Test also. He has shown the potential and we want to give him more opportunities for (the series against) Pakistan and England. 

Q But why does Sourav not feature in the squad at all, despite a decent performance? 

A To have Sourav in the squad and then put him in the reserves is not done. We are basically keeping the future in mind. 

Q Will Sourav get a place in the Pakistan-bound squad? 

A As far as the Pakistan tour is concerned, its too early to say anything. But the doors are certainly not closed for him. 

Q Why has Gautam Gambhir been retained? 

A We all know hes an opener and its a specialists job. He needs time and space, and a few failures dont mean he should be dropped. 

Q Why did Sourav not get the same treatment? 

A Ive already said that we are looking at a team for the future.

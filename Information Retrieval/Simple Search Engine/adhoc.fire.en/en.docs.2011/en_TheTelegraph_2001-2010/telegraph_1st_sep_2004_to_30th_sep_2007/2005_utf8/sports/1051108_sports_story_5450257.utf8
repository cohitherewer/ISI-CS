The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Selectors will favour Rao, not Sourav

 - VRV Singhs call-up has everything to do with Chappells push towards really quick bowlers 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav

 Mumbai: Even if the Team India batsmen flop 

 in the last two ODIs versus Sri Lanka, the selectors will 

 (as of now) consider bringing back Yalaka Venugopal Rao 

 and not former captain Sourav Ganguly. Of course, that can 

 only be in the five-match series against South Africa. 

 The Sourav bit shouldnt surprise given the way 

 events unfolded in the last two selection committee meetings 

 in Mohali (October 13 and 28). It got confirmed in Motera 

 late on Sunday. 

 Rao got dropped because 

 Mohammed Kaif (93 not out and an unbeaten 102 in two of 

 his last three ODI innings) simply had to be recalled once 

 he regained fitness... Gautam Gambhir was set to go, but 

 couldnt be touched after his wonderful 103. If a Yuvraj 

 Singh continues to fail, Rao is going to be back, 

 a well-placed Board source told The Telegraph here on Monday. 

Till his Motera appearance, Gambhirs last ODI had been in April 2003 ? the tri-series in Dhaka, soon after the World Cup. His comeback has been extraordinary. 

Besides Rao, allrounder Jai Prakash Yadav got dropped after the series first defeat, with right-arm rookie speedster Vikram Raj Veer Singh of Punjab getting that slot. 

Rao has been anything but exceptional in a short career spanning 11 ODIs (twice as super sub) and managed a best of 38 in the ongoing engagements. However, being 23, he does have the advantage of age. Sourav is 33. 

Age, though, isnt the sole factor working to the disadvantage of our most successful Test captain. Souravs determined to return, yes, but may soon have to review exactly where he stands in one-day cricket. 

To talk of Yuvraj, the otherwise flamboyant middle-order bat has been struggling ? testimony being scores of 14, 18, 10 and three (he didnt bat in Mohali) in the series ? and has to quickly come good or else could get sidelined like his one-time mentor. 

Meanwhile, one learns Singhs call-up has everything to do with coach Greg Chappells push towards trying out really quick bowlers and not the ones with medium-pace. The 21-year-old made a distinct impression in last months Challenger Trophy and is regarded by many as being the quickest in the country. 

Among other things, its this accent on express pace that has stalled Zaheer Khans return despite another excellent Duleep Trophy outing just a few days ago. Like Sourav, under whom he made his debut a shade over five years ago (in Nairobi), Zaheer probably has to wait for next months three-Test series versus Lanka. 

 Incidentally, the squad for the first two/three ODIs 

 against South Africa will be picked in Vadodara on Friday, 

 after the last ODI versus Lanka. The penultimate match is 

 to be hosted by Rajkot and the teams reached there (via 

 road from Ahmedabad) on Monday evening.

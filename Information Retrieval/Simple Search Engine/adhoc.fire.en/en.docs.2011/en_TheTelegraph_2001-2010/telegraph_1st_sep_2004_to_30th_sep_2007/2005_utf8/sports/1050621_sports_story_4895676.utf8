 Parreira cant do without Ronaldo

Free-Kick 

P.K. Banerjee

The Confederations Cup has been the topic of heated debate ever since Fifa introduced it at the start of the nineties. Most experts have questioned the very logic of such a tournament in an already over-crowded calendar. Well, this is not the time to argue for or against the Confederations Cup. The fact is, it has become a regular feature in the world of soccer and everyone has to live with it. 

 I would say this years championship has been planned very purposefully. With World Cup hosts Germany staging it exactly a year before the big one, everyones getting a feel of whats in store. The eight competing nations are getting a first-hand experience of the conditions they will be facing: the grounds, practice facilities, climate, German hospitality, etc. The Germans are famous for their sporting tradition and they have got a chance to provide a level-playing field for representatives of all the continents.

 Its also a wonderful opportunity for the eight teams to size up the opponents, but I dont think any of them is in a mood to reveal all their cards. That is understandable. Its been a very long season for the players and not all of them are mentally and physically 100 per cent.

 The odd conflict between players and the federation has surfaced, none more hyped than the one involving Ronaldo.

 I believe the mentally devastated Brazilian striker had every right to opt out of the Confederations Cup. Just as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was within his right to keep him out of the two World Cup qualifying games even though Ronaldo wanted toplay those.

 We have seen Brazil in two matches and the obvious question is: Has Parreira found strikers good enough to step into Ronaldos shoes? The answer is an unambiguous no. Adriano scored a magical goal with his left foot in the first match against Greece, but it appears hes a good yard slower than Ronaldo. Hes also not adept with his right foot. Young Robinho certainly has the talent but not the maturity and finesse to be counted in the big league yet. The duo can be good supporting forwards to Ronaldo but cant be expected to carry the team match after match on a stage like the World Cup.

 Ronaldo is the worlds best centre forward and even Parreira knows that. The coach wont be able to do without this gifted footballer at the worlds biggest stage. Ronaldo is within striking distance of overtaking Gerd Muller as the most prolific striker in World Cup finals and I am sure this record will motivate him to great heights in Germany.

 Even without Ronaldo, the way Brazil stretched out the Greek defence and destroyed Otto Rehhagels team should send very strong signals to the rest of the world. The World Cup qualifiers defeat against Argentina just a few days ago had stung them badly and the world champions were keen to show it was just a bad day in office.

 Brazil lost to Mexico thereafter but it was a match they should have wrapped up in the first 20 minutes itself. The likes of Adriano and Robinho missed some unbelievable sitters. Parreira must have felt the absence of Ronaldo that night.

 Japan put up a heart-warming show to conquer Greece. They may not be the same force as the ones which took the Euro 2004 championship by storm, but Greece are still the European champions. And by beating them, Japan have taken Asian football one step forward.

 As Asian football continues to make significant strides, India is going nowhere. What a painful day it was for all of India when Pakistan walloped us 3-0! I understand there is a three-goal difference in the standard between India and Japan or Korea, but I just cant digest a defeat by that margin at the hands of Pakistan.

 As it is, the three-match tour was at best a friendship series for us. We dont have anything to learn from Pakistan, they have more to gain from such a series. And yet, we came away with our footballing image tarnished.

 In my last column, I had welcomed the AIFF proposal of banning foreigners in all tournaments save the National League. Alas, such a promising proposal got shot down at the executive committee meeting. The Goan association and our very own IFA had strongly opposed such a move and they had the last laugh. I can understand their viewpoint. Their argument is that its these foreigners who are playing the lead roles in all big teams. The crowds wont just come to the ground if these foreign players are taken out of the picture. Consequently, theyll lose business.

 But that is just one way of looking at it. One also has to keep an eye on the broader picture which, to me, is much more important. I want to make it clear for the umpteenth time that I am not against quality foreigners playing in India by the dozens. But since we dont have the financial strength to import world-class players, lets stop patronising third and fourth-grade foreigners and give local talent a better chance to develop. The clubs can utilise that money better by developing infrastructure and focusing on junior programmes.

 The present-day administrators may be good in the sense that they have been successful in bringing in sponsors to the game. But I feel the need of the hour is for ex-footballers with efficient administrative skills to run the show. They will be able to identify the problem and address it better.

Calcutta: The Indian football team may be riding high on their SAFF Cup success, but captain Bhaichung Bhutia feels it will need a lot of hard work from players if they want similar results in future. 

Bhaichung, who stayed back in New Delhi on Monday owing to some personal work, will arrive in the city on Wednesday. 

While speaking to The Telegraph from his cellphone on Tuesday, Bhaichung said: It was a wonderful experience in Pakistan. The team under (Syed) Nayeemuddin and P.K. Banerjees guidance is performing well and we would like to maintain our form in the Asian Games as well. P.K. was a great motivator on the tour but since he had to do a lot of paperwork, the players used to miss him at times. 

Meanwhile, the captain and coach felt that the standard of the SAFF Cup has improved a lot. 

While speaking to reporters at the South Club on Tuesday, Nayeem said: I need more discipline and hard work from my players if they want to win tournaments in future. They will have to spend more sleepless nights as they did during the SAFF Cup. 

We are now the best team in the sub-continent and it was really tough to achieve this feat. The overall standard of the tournament has gone up, with teams such as Maldives, Nepal and Bhutan posing a tougher challenge. 

On which player was the most impressive, Nayeem said it was the Indian teams performance which impressed him the most. 

They were hungry to take the trophy back home and I think this is what helped, he said. 

This win will boost the teams morale before the Doha Asian Games, and Nayeem has his eyes fixed. It will be a different kettle of fish and the level of competition will be much tougher. I think if we follow the South Korean model of training, we can perform better, added Nayeem. 

Mehtab Hussain had more reasons to celebrate. 

This was my first international outing and emerging champion was more than I asked for. The fact that I contributed for the teams victory by scoring is something I would cherish for a long time.

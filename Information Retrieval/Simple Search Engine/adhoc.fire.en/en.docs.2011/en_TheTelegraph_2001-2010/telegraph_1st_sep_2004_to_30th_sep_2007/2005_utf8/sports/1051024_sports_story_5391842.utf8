 Beem in lead

Toronto: Rich Beem hit a nine-under-par 63 to surge into the lead before thunderstorms ended play early in the third round of the $4.4 million Funai Classic at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida on Saturday. 

It was the second consecutive day that play was brought to a premature halt because of bad weather. Beem, without a victory since the 2002 US PGA Championship, began the round five shots off the lead. But the 35-year-old American, who has missed 12 of 15 cuts since his second-place finish at the BellSouth Classic in April, had six birdies on his back nine at the Magnolia Golf Club to record a 19-under total of 197. 

One stroke off the pace were US Pernice, Mark Calcavecchia and Mark Wilson, Swedens Carl Pettersson, South African Tim Clark and Geoff Ogilvy of Australia. (Reuters)

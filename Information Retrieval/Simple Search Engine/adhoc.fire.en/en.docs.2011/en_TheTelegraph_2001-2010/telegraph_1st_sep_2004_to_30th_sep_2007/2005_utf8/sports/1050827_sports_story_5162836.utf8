 Clijsters plans to quit at end 2007

Brussels: Former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters was quoted on Friday as saying she plans to retire from professional tennis at the end of 2007. 

I think I will stop at the end of 2007. My body is already giving me a lot of problems, the 22-year-old Belgian said. 

Maybe I will still play the (Antwerp) Diamond Games in 2008, as a goodbye tournament, but that will be it, she told a Belgian daily. 

Clijsters has suffered from a series of injuries since 2003 when she became the first womens player since 1974 to play more than 100 singles matches in a season. 

She returned from a career-threatening left wrist injury in February and has also suffered a knee injury this year. Despite these setbacks she has won six titles in 2005 including the Toronto Cup last weekend. 

Clijsters is seeded fourth at the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open, which starts on Monday.

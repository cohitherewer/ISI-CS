 Bruce Elliott to review Shabbir, Malik

Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has said the bowling actions of Pakistani bowlers Shabbir Ahmed and Shoaib Malik would be reviewed by Prof. Bruce Elliott at the University of Western Australia. Shabbirs action will be reviewed by video while Shoaib will travel to Australia, an ICC press release stated here on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram on Tuesday castigated the ICC for its lack of coherent policy on chucking. 

The ICC has no policy on the issue of bowling actions. How else can you explain why Shabbir, whose action had been cleared twice earlier, once again finds it questioned, the former left-arm pacer said in Mumbai.

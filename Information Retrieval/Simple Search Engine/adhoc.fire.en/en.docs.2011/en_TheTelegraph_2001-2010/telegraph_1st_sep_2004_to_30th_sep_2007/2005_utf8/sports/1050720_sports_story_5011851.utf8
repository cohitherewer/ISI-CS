 Baptista to stay at Sevilla

Madrid: Brazilian forward Julio Baptista wants to stay at Sevilla for another season and has no intention of leaving despite the interest of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. 

Ive come back to work hard and stay at Sevilla for another season, the 23-year-old told a news conference at Sevillas pre-season training base in Cartaya. 

There has been a lot of interest in me from other clubs but Im happy here and that has to be taken into account. No one has ever heard me say that I want to leave Sevilla.

 Mankad, Sridhar advance 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Harsh Mankad remains the neglected warrior of Indian tennis. 

Denied a wild card despite some strong results last year, when he rose through the ranks to emerge as India?s No. 1 singles player, the son of Test cricketer Ashok and women?s national tennis champion Nirupama is still alive in the qualifying competition. 

The Indian Davis Cupper fought with characteristic grit to overcome a first-set rout and advance to the final qualifying round. 

Mankad beat Israel?s Andy Ram 1-6, 7-5, 6-2 and will face Briton Jamie Delgado in the final round Monday. 

Another Indian will also be in the fray to book a berth in the main round. 

Vinod Sridhar fought past Russian Toimuraz Cabashvili 3-6, 6-2, 7-5. 

He will next take on Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis.

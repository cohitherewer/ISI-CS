 Manipur beat Assam 3-1 

Kochi: Last years semi-finalist Manipur defeated Assam 3-1 in a quarter final league match in the Air India Express Santosh Trophy at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium on Saturday. 

Striker Sushil Kumar drew the first blood for Manipur with a header in the 22nd minute, Samson Singh struck the second in the 70th minute and Dharamjit Singh added another in the 90th minute. For Assam, Sanjeeva Raongpi reduced the margin in the 83rd minute. 

Manipur dominated for major part of the proceedings, but the water-soaked ground considerably curtailed their speed.

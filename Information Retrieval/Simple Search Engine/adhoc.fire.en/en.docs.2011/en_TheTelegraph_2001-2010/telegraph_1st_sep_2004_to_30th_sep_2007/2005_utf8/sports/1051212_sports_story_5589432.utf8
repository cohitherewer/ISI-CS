 Title for Shiv, Jyoti 2nd

 - Champion Rookie of Year 

Bangkok: Displaying nerves of a seasoned champion, Shiv Kapur played immaculate golf on the back nine to emerge the winner of the $600,000 Volvo Masters of Asia in his rookie year on Sunday. Defending champion Jyoti Randhawa came in second to make it a rare one-two finish for Indians in a major meet. 

Shiv finished his final round with five-under 67 for a total of 20-under 268, two shots clear of Randhawa (270). He had rounds of 66-67-68-67, while Randhawa had rounds of 70-64-67-69 for the week. 

Randhawa picked up $69,000, which carried him past $329,835 and to third place in the Order of Merit. 

Shivs winning cheque of $108,000 was the biggest of his career and propelled him to fourth on the Order of Merit. He also emerged as Rookie of the Year, pipping Andrew Buckle of Australia. 

The win also gets him an entry into WGC-Bridgestone Invitational next year, besides an invitation from the Sony Open on the US Tour. 

Marcus Both (71) finished third with 16-under 272 and Chawalit Plaphol, playing with Shiv, shot a 69 to end at 13-under 275 in fifth place. 

Among the other Indians, Gaurav Ghei (72) finished at one-under 287 and ended tied 25th. Jeev Milkha Singh carded his best for the week, a four-under 68 for a total of four-over 292 to end tied 40th, while Harmeet Kahlon (71) ended at seven-over 295 in tied 44th. 

At the start of the day, I told my caddie and friend Neeraj Sareen that if we got to 20-under, we had a chance. As things turned out, that was the number, Shiv said. 

And when he climbed to 20-under and was two ahead of Randhawa ? then at 18-under after a birdie on the 17th ? he knew he was close. When Randhawa managed only a par, it was all over. (PTI)

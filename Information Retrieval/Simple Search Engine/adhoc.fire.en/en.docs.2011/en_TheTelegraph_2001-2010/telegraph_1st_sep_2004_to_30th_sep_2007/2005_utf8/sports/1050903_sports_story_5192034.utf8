 Kaif wants extended run at the top 

 - Fleming says India would be wary of Bond in final 

 Kaif and Dhoni walk off the field after Indias win in Harare on Friday 

Harare: Mohammed Kaif, after guiding his team to a six-wicket win over New Zealand, asked for more such opportunities at the top of the batting order in Indias future one-day plans. 

Playing in the top allows me more overs which suits my style of play, said Kaif after his unbeaten 102 helped India book a place in the final of the Videocon Cup tri-series here Friday. 

Coach Greg Chappell was happy that Kaif had seized his moment and the experiment to push him to the top of the order was successful. 

We tried him as an opener in Sri Lanka and for the second match running in this series, he has come good. We needed someone to make a hundred today and Kaif was up to the challenge, said Chappell. 

Captain Sourav Ganguly said that the Indians were focused on their next game against Zimbabwe. We will think about the final after that, he felt. 

About his own form, Sourav said: Ive been hitting the ball well. Ill probably find out a way to get the big knock. 

Chappell was not sure if keeping Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori out of the game was the right tactic for New Zealand but felt it allowed his batsmen to run into form. 

The view was diametrically opposite to that of New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming who said that Indian batsmen would be wary of Bond in the final. 

I am sure they would be anxious. I would be if I was for them. Facing a bowler like him is always a difficult proposition and irrespective of what Indians have done in this game, it would still keep them on edge against Bond in the final. 

Fleming didnt agree that his attack looked lightweight in the absence of Bond and Vettori.

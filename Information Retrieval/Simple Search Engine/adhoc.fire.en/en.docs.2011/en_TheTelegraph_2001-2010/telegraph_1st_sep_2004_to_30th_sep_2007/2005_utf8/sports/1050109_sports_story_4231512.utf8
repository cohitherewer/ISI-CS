 Vijai Singh smiles as he leaves the 18th green at the Plantation Course in Kapalua, Hawaii, on Friday 

New York: Vijai Singh continued his flawless start to a new campaign, firing a second round eight-under 65 on Friday to take a two-shot lead at the season-opening $ 5.3 million Mercedes Championship in Hawaii. 

Singh, who dominated in 2004 claiming nine events, over $ 10 million and the world number one ranking from Tiger Woods, has maintained his momentum into the new season by carding two bogey-free rounds at the picturesque Kapalua Plantation course. 

Despite his sublime play, the Fijian has not been able to pull away from the elite 31-player winners only field, needing a birdie on the last to reach 15-under, two ahead of Canada?s Mike Weir who had the round of the day, a sizzling 10-under 63. 

Sitting one shot further adrift at 12-under is twice US Open champion Ernie Els, followed by Sergio Garcia and Jonathan Kaye four shots off the lead at 11-under. 

Woods also remains in the chase, lurking five shots back at 10-under following a second straight five-under 68 despite problems with his putting. 

?I?m playing well, I didn?t make too many mistakes,? said Singh, who had six birdies and an eagle. ?The putts kind of dried up on the back nine but I had my share on the front nine. 

?I just started well and kept it going, I didn?t feel any pressure at all. I?m playing well and I?m putting well.? 

Weir also found his putting stroke to jump into contention. 

The 2003 US Masters champion got his round off to a spectacular start with birdies on four of the first six holes, finishing off the front nine with an eagle. 

He would give a shot back at the 10th but that would be the only blemish of the round, closing out the day with three straight birdies. 

?I got a great start and really got it going,? Weir said. ?When I was six-under at the turn I felt like maybe I might have something special going. I just had a feel for my putter.? 

While Woods? play off the tee has been near flawless lending weight to his claim his swing overhaul is now complete, his putter has failed him miserably. 

The former-world number one needed 32 putts to get through his round and sank only two outside six feet. 

Woods got his round off to the best possible start with a birdie on the opening hole and then had another at five. However, he followed that with a string of missed opportunities and eight consecutive pars before finally making another birdie putt at 14. 

?I had my chances to post a good, solid round but I didn?t do it,? said Woods, who closed on a positive note with three birdies in the last five holes. 

Defending champion Stuart Appleby also jumped into the championship chase with a nine-under 64 to leave him seven shots back.

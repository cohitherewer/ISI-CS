 Federer oozes confidence

 Federer has the perfect game to shine on clay 

Paris: World No. 1 Roger Federer, a four-time Grand Slam champion, believes this will be the year when he can finally win the French Open for the first time. 

Im confident I can do it, the Swiss said on Saturday. If I win the French, Ive got them all. Federer has won every Grand Slam but the Paris tournament, which starts on Monday. 

The gifted all-court player has been busy rewriting tennis history but has never gone beyond the quarter finals in Paris, where he has lost in the first round in two of the last three years. 

The quiet Federer, who has the perfect game to shine on clay as he proved by winning in Hamburg last week without dropping a set, is slightly irritated by suggestions he had a French Open problem. 

I agree its the only one I havent won, but I won three (Grand Slam titles) last year, he said. You cant expect to win them all right away. You have to be a little patient. 

Federer can expect a strong challenge at Roland Garros from Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal, who is trying to become the first man to win the French Open on debut since Swede Mats Wilander in 1982. 

Nadal, the latest to rise in an endless series of brilliant Spanish baseliners, has impressed everybody, including former world No. 1 Andre Agassi, the 1999 French Open champion. 

His shots really look big, he moves great, has a real versatile forehand and seems to have one of the best competitive spirits that youll see in sports, Agassi said of the young Spaniard on Saturday. 

Johansson pulls out 

Swedens highest-ranked player Joachim Johansson has pulled out because of an elbow injury, the Swedish news agency reported on Saturday. 

His withdrawal means his compatriot Robin Soderling becomes the 33rd seed at Roland Garros.

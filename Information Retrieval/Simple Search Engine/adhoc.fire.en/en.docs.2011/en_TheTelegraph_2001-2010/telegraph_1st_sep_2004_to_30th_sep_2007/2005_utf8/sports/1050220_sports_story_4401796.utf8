 Missiles draw review cry from Ponting 

Wellington: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has demanded a review of security arrangements for the tour of New Zealand after his players were pelted with missiles during Saturday?s opening one-day match. 

The match in Wellington was stopped several times after Australian players, including pace bowler Glenn McGrath and all rounder Simon Katich, complained to the umpires that they had been hit by plastic bottles thrown from the crowd. 

Ponting told a news conference the security arrangements were not up to scratch. ?Someone?s going to get hurt,? he said. ?A full plastic bottle hitting someone in the eye or the back of the head... we don?t want that. 

?You have to have more security guys around the players on the boundary. They?ve got to have some sort of power, get the police involved, whatever.? 

Former Australia skipper Steve Waugh threatened to take his players off the field after similar crowd disturbances in New Zealand five years ago. 

Meanwhile, Ponting said of McGrath: ?Glenn was outstanding and we just did enough to win. It?s a very hard place to win over here and we found that out tonight.? 

New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming said: ?It does hurt because it was such a close game. We were out of it, came back really well ? Hamish was outstanding ? but we just lost our way towards the end.?

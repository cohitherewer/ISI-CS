 Johannesburg: Denis Lindsay, who spurred South Africa to a 4-1 series win over Australia in 1966-67, died of bladder cancer on Thursday. He was 66.

 Lindsay, a wicketkeeper-batsman, scored 606 runs in his most famous five-Test series at an average 86.57. He scored three centuries in the series ? 182, 137 and 131 ? with the last coming in 105 minutes.

 Lindsay played 19 Tests, scoring 1,130 runs at an average 37.66 and effecting 59 dismissals, ending his cricket career as a match referee for the international cricket council.

 ?He gave the game of cricket a lifetime of service both as a player and an administrator,? ICC president Ehsan Mani said.

 London: Aiming for a berth in India?s World Cup squad, Dinesh Mongia has decided to continue with English county Leicestershire next season.

 ?I was a part of India?s World Cup squad when we reached the final in 2003 and hope to be involved again next time. Achieving consistency is undoubtedly my number one objective next summer, particularly in the championship,? Mongia said.

 The 28-year-old averaged just over 40 in 2005, accumulating 684 first-class runs, but played a key role in the one-day side.

 Paris: Renault gave Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso an early Christmas present when they presented him with his winning car on Wednesday.

 ?I hope it gives you even more inspiration and enthusiasm for next year,? Renault president Carlos Ghosn told the 24-year-old Spaniard at a celebration of the team?s two championships.

 Alonso was asked to pull a ribbon to open the surprise gift, a huge box wrapped in the team?s blue and yellow colours, and was delighted to see the familiar race car inside when it opened.

 Paris: Utrecht defender David di Tommaso probably died of a heart attack, the French player?s agent said on Thursday. The 26-year-old died in his sleep at the home he shared with his wife and child on Monday night.

 ?The police did a toxin analysis,? Mickael Manuello told a sports daily on Thursday. ?The first results did not show anything. Other tests will be carried out to prove David died of a heart attack. That should kill the nasty rumours going around.?

 Kuala Lumpur: Saudi Arabia?s Hamad Al Montashari has won the AFC Player of the Year. The award was presented in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday evening to the 23-year-old defender, who earlier this year helped his country to qualify for the 2006 World Cup finals and his club Al Ittihad to win the AFC Champions League.

 Stockholm: Rangers have hired a Swedish firm to help it fight the illegal copying of merchandise such as shirts, which costs the club up to six million pounds ($10.37 million) a year.

 Labels on the club?s merchandise will a have special invisible identification code which sends out a radio frequency which beeps when scanned, said Swedish labelling group Nilorn.

 3-stroke lead for Firoz

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Firoz Ali returned a 4-under 68 on Day III of the inaugural Hero Honda Open East at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Friday for a 9-under 207 aggregate. 

He now has a three-stroke lead over Meeruts Amardip Sinh Malik who turned in a 3-under 69, to go 6-under 210 over three days and lie at sole second. 

Firoz started off on a cautious note, just concentrating on maintaining par. A birdie on the par-5 fourth boosted his morale, but then came a bogey on the 7th. He hit four more birdies; three of them in a row, on the 15th, 16th and 17th. 

Mukesh Kumar scored a 3-under 69 for a total of 3-under 213 to be just six strokes off the leader. Sandeep Syal from Chennai carded a 3-under 69 to go to 2-under 214. 

In tied fourth with Sandeep is local man S.S.P. Chowrasia, who had a par-72 round for the day. Two more locals, Uttam Singh Mundy and young Shankar Das are tied sixth, at 1-under 215. 

Rahul Ganapathy had the best score for the day, with a 6-under 66. Ranjit Singh continued to lead amateur field with a 5-over 77 for the day and a total of 5-over 221.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harbhajan satisfies Broad on return

Calcutta: It was Chris Broad who brought Harbhajan Singh?s doosra to the notice of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in December. 

Three months hence, after the off-spinner travelled to Australia and got his action ?corrected? under the supervision of bio-mechanics expert Bruce Elliot, the Englishman is once again in the Match Referee?s chair as Harbhajan returns to Test action at the Eden. And much to the relief of the Team India offie, he passed the test in the eyes of Broad on Thursday. 

According to the Match Referee of the ongoing India-Pakistan Test series, Harbhajan?s action was ?normal? on the first day of his bowling in the Test. ?I watched him bowl today, and to me his (Harbhajan?s) action was normal,? Broad told The Telegraph after Day II of the Eden Test. 

The Match Referee, however, was quick to add that he made the comment after observing Harbhajan for just a single day. ?I?m happy with his action today, but it doesn?t mean he can?t be cautioned tomorrow,? Broad pointed out. 

It may be recalled that Harbhajan was reported by Broad on the advice of umpires Aleem Dar and Mark Benson on the fourth day of the second Test between India and Bangladesh in Chittagong on December 19. 

Harbhajan was assessed by Elliott at the University of Western Australia, and cleared by the ICC of any suspect bowling action, thanks to the new regulations allowing bowlers to straighten their arms from a maximum of 15? of bending. 

Meanwhile, former India captain and spin legend Bishan Singh Bedi ? who was witness to Harbhajan?s bowling at the Eden ? however, refused to comment on whether the remedial process had an adverse effect on his delivery. 

The off-spinner ended the day wicketless, conceding 52 runs off 15 overs. 

Incidentally, Harbhajan is on a par with Bedi as the leading wicket-taker (29) at the Eden. Bedi, however, felt there?s no secret behind ?taking wickets at a particular venue,? and ?it all depends on how you perform on a given day.?

 was MoM for his 2 goals 

Kozhikode: Two goals by Bhaichung Bhutia in the second half enabled defending champions East Bengal to overcome a determined State Bank of Travancore (SBT) 4-2 in the fifth round of the ninth National Football League match for ONGC Cup here on Tuesday. 

The red-and-gold shirts were leading 2-1 at half-time. 

It was midfielder Climax Lawrence who seized the initiative for red and gold side by netting the first goal eleven minutes into the game after successfully tracking a smooth pass from captain Chandan Das. 

However, the bankmen equalised soon after when midfielder N.P. Pradeep converted a penalty. 

But Lawrence, later named Man of the Match, netted his second five minutes before the breather when he converted a free-kick taken by Chandan. 

Egged on by a sell-out crowd of over 30,000, the home team did well to level the score two-all after SBT captain Lanel Thomas finished off a Abdul Hakkim pass 30 minutes into the second session. 

It was then that Bhutia flashed on to the scene. After connecting a Chandan rebound to take his team 3-2 up with only 15 minutes to go for the final whistle, the Indian captain once again found the net smashing home a Chandan header minutes before the close. 

East Bengal now have 11 points from five matches while SBT have four from same number of matches.

 Montoya body-blow to Kimi title hopes

 - Luck came my way in Istanbul: Alonso 

Kevin Eason

 Raikkonen was relying on Montoya to keep Alonso out of second place 

The words went unsaid but the body language spoke volumes about the fraction-of-a-second of madness that could yet cost Kimi Raikkonen the Formula One World Championship. The Finn was relying on his teammate, Juan Pablo Montoya, to keep Fernando Alonso at bay so that his convincing victory in the first Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday would cut deep into the Spaniards championship lead. 

Montoya was only two laps from helping Raikkonen complete a first one-two finish for McLaren Mercedes in five years. With Alonsos Renault well adrift in third, all he had to do was keep out of trouble, keep his McLaren intact and ? as he put it ? cruise to the chequered flag. That would have cut Alonsos lead over Raikkonen by four points and given the Finn optimism that he can overhaul his rival over the seasons five remaining races. 

All that was in Montoyas way was Tiago Monteiro in a Jordan, doing little more than racing his teammate, Narain Karthikeyan, for last place. Monteiro was perfectly prepared to be lapped by the fast-moving McLaren; what he was not ready for was Montoyas sudden to pass and then pull straight back in front of the Jordan. The result was inevitable: as the pair hit the brakes from 200mph, Monteiros Jordan lost grip, careered into the back of Montoyas McLaren and broke the Colombians aerodynamic diffuser. 

Montoya, already nursing a flat-spotted tyre, drove on thinking all was well, until he reached what has now become the infamous eighth corner on this glorious new circuit. Drivers exit the turn flat out at 180mph but Montoya went straight through it as his tyre and diffuser conspired to reinforce his embarrassment. Alonso drove past to take a second place he never believed he could achieve. 

I knew the McLarens were much faster than me but you always have to keep going until the last lap because you dont know whats going to happen, Alonso said. People might say I am lucky but I go looking for my luck and it came in this race. 

As Alonso spoke, Montoya shuffled in his chair and Raikkonen stared straight ahead ? although you wonder whether he might have wanted to ask Mike Tyson, a curious visitor to his first Grand Prix, to mete out a little revenge on his behalf. Tyson may throw the punches but it was Montoya who delivered the body blow to Raikkonens championship. The Finn said: Mike wished me luck before the race but we were unlucky. A one-two finish would have helped my championship. You never know if the two points might make a difference at the end of the season. Montoya knows that, too, and the downbeat delivery of his shock at being hit by Monteiro suggested he knew that the Jordan driver was not entirely to blame. Lest he has any doubts, Monteiro plans to point out whose fault the accident was. 

I will definitely be having a word with Juan Pablo to clear this one up, he said. The drivers have said among themselves 10,000 times not to cut across like that. Why did he do it two laps from the end? I was surprised because we would have been doing 120mph on the brakes when we touched and that is dangerous. 

The frustration will be doubled for Raikkonen because he has clearly taken over from Alonso as the fastest man in Formula One. His fifth win of the season was as convincing as they come, flying away from pole position with only a brief one-lap interruption by Giancarlo Fisichella, who got his Renault off the line quicker.

 Mukesh nears Tour title

New Delhi: The country?s top professionals, including Jeev Milkha Singh and Amandeep Johl, will vie for top honours in the PSPB Open Petroleum Golf Championship beginning here Thursday. 

The event, the 19th on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour, will also provide a chance for Mukesh Kumar to seal the Order of Merit title, who currently tops the money list with Rs 14,28,100. 

But Shiv Kapur, second on the money list, and Vijay Kumar could dethrone Mukesh if they emerge victorious in this Rs 50 lakh prize money event as the winner will take home a purse of Rs 8.1 lakh. 

However, the star attractions will surely be Jeev and Johl, two regulars on the Asian Tour. And the two golfers who will be surely missed during the weekend would be Jyoti Randhawa and Harmeet Kahlon. 

While Kahlon cited fatigue to pull out of the event, the organisers said Randhawa had asked for appearance money without which he opted out.

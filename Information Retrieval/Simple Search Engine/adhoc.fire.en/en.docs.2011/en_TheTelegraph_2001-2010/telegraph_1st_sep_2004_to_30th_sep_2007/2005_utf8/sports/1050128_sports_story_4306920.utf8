Melbourne: Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport clawed back from the brink of defeat to set up an all-American women?s final at the Australian Open. 

Williams saved three match-points before beating Russian teenager Maria Sharapova 2-6, 7-5, 8-6 while Davenport came within two points of losing before she wore down Nathalie Dechy of France 2-6, 7-6, 6-4. 

?Those are always the best wins, when you?re down match-point because you can?t give up at any,? Williams said. 

?She has a fighting spirit and I think that?s gotten her to where she is today... but I?m still the top fighter out there.? 

Davenport was a bundle of nerves in her match with Dechy but regained her composure when it mattered to reach her first Grand Slam final since 2000. 

?I?m ecstatic to be back. It seems like forever for me,? she said. ?I was pretty despondent about the chances of getting back to a final. I haven?t been in one in almost five years but I?m ready.? 

Williams lost last year?s Wimbledon final and the season-ending Tour championship to Sharapova and seemed destined for a third defeat when the 17-year-old Siberian won the opening set and served for the match in the second and third sets. 

But the former world No. 1 broke back both times in a struggle reminiscent of her semi-final against Belgian Kim Clijsters in the 2003 Australian Open when she saved two match-points before reaching the final and winning the title. 

There was no hiding Sharapova?s disappointment but she still managed to put on a brave face. 

?Of course I?m sad, and obviously it?s a tough one to lose but I?ve got a long way ahead of me,? she said. 

Davenport also needed to draw on her wealth of experience to beat Dechy, who was appearing in her first semi-final in a decade as a professional. 

Davenport had her left thigh heavily strapped, is struggling with a hip strain and got off to a sluggish start, gifting Dechy the first set in only 24 minutes with a string of uncharacteristic errors. 

Dechy was two points away from winning the match but Davenport won the second set decider 7-5 on a double fault and then finally sealed the match when the Frenchwoman surrendered her serve to love in the final game. 

?I?m a little perplexed,? Davenport said. ?I don?t think I?m playing well but I?m in the final. I got lucky but I?ll take it.? 

It will be the first all-American women?s Grand Slam final since Wimbledon 2003 when Serena beat older sister Venus as she had done at the Australian that year. 

Russians have won the last three Grand Slam women?s tournaments. 

On Wednesday, too, Davenport had been put to the sword in the quarter finals. Local favourite Alicia Molik did everything but win as the experienced 28-year-old hung on for a 6-4, 4-6, 9-7 win. 

In another quarter final, Dechy beat Patty Schnyder 5-7, 6-1, 7-5. (Agencies)

Shanghai: India?s Jeev Milkha Singh moved up two spots to be tied sixth at the end of the third round at the $1.5 million Asian Open Saturday. He failed to match his four-under second round score, but had a decent two-under 70 for an aggregate of 207. 

Jeev was tied with Luke Donald of England and Soren Hansen of Denmark. 

The bigger gain, though was by Jyoti Randhawa, who hit a brilliant five-under par 67 (aggregate of 211) to pull himself up from the miserable 59th position at which he made the cut to tied 20th. Rahil Gangjee, though, slipped to 68th, having hit a poor one over third round, reflecting pretty poorly on his second round 69. 

Ernie Els fired a solid four-under-par 68 to extend his lead to five strokes. The world number three cooled off after his brilliant 62 on Friday, but still improved to finish on 19-under 197 at the Tomson Shanghai Pudong Golf Club. 

Britain?s Simon Wakefield equalled day?s best score with a 66 to take sole possession of second place at 14 under. 

Denmark?s Thomas Bjorn was a further stroke off the pace in third, after a 68, while Frenchman Jean-Francois Lucquin?s 69 left him at 11 under. 

Jeev opened the day with two birdies and moved to fourth at one stage. He dropped a shot at fifth and then birdied the ninth to turn in two-under. He had one birdie and one bogey in the back nine. 

Jyoti, who had six bogeys and four birdies on the second day, played more assuredly in the third round. He had just one birdie on the front nine on the eighth, and then on the back nine, he had five birdies including three in a row from 13th to 15th, before dropping one on the 16th. He closed with a birdie to card 67. 

The big South African, meanwhile, began the day with a four-stroke advantage and never looked like relinquishing his lead, despite bogeying the fourth, ninth and 12th holes. 

A six at the par-five ninth, where his drive found the water, particularly annoyed him although he managed to sink a 20-foot putt for birdie at the next. 

?I feel that to bogey a par five is a huge sin,? said Els. ?But after making mistakes I came back well and that kind of sums up the whole day.? 

?It would be a huge confidence booster to win here,? added Els. ?I wish I?d played like this last week.? 

Els, a three-time major winner, is bidding for his 21st victory on the European Tour and his 56th international title.

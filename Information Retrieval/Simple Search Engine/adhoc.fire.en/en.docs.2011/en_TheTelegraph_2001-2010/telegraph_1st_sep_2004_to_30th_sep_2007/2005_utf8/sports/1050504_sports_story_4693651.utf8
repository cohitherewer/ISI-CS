 Batra challenges Gill election move

New Delhi: Facing a possible challenge from rival faction, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill called for an early election to the post of president and other office bearers in Calcutta on May 23. 

However, IHF senior vice president Narendra Batra, who had moved the Delhi High Court Monday charging Gill with financial irregularities, filed an additional affidavit on Tuesday, requesting the court not to allow Gill and secretary K. Jothikumaran to participate in the federation elections. 

Batra submitted that after filing of his writ petition, he was served with certain documents at 4 pm Monday notifying about the AGM for holding of the election of office bearers, and that the minutes of the earlier meeting had been changed. 

Meanwhile, IHF sources said the term of the present set of office bearers expires in February 2006, but Gill has thought it fit to call for an early election seeking his fourth term in office because he feels the majority of the 33-affiliated units are supporting him. 

Their detractors, however, claimed that Gill and Jothikumaran have bypassed the executive members and failed to take the members into confidence. 

Even the executive committee members were surprised to receive the election notice on Monday, the detractors said. (PTI)

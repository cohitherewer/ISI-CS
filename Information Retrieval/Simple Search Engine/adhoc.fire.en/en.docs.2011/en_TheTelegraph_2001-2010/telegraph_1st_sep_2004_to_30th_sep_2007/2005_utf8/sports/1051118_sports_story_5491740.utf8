 Kumble targets Lanka series

New Delhi: Working his way back to form and fitness, ace leg spinner Anil Kumble is upbeat about touching the magical 500-wicket mark this season, starting with the three-Test series against Sri Lanka next month. 

Kumble, who was left out of the one-day squad for the home series against the island nation and South Africa on fitness grounds, is raring to make a comeback. 

I had a slight niggle in the back but I am fine now. I have been practising with the Karnataka team. In fact, I am looking forward to Karnatakas Ranji Trophy tie against Railways so that I can test myself in a match situation, Kumble said here on Thursday. 

The lanky leg spinners decision to play in the match, starting here on November 23, may have something to do with the BCCI directive that injured players must prove their fitness in a domestic game before making themselves available for selection to the national side. 

The Bangalore bowler is 35 wickets short of joining the elite 500 club, and feels that the series against Sri Lanka would provide him an opportunity. 

Thirty five wickets from three Tests is a little tight, but yes, 500 is a realistic target. I am looking forward to that feat and starting my season on a good note, he said. 

Kumble felt the 6-1 scoreline in one-dayers will increase Team Indias confidence in Tests. 

The series victory over Sri Lanka will give us the confidence as we play the Tests which, nevertheless, would be a different ball game altogether. Our track record in Tests has been good, so we hope to have a good game against them. The leg spinner felt public interest in Tests wont be at a premium. 

I do not think interest level will come down. Test cricket has its own charm. The match against England and Pakistan, which ended on Wednesday, was a close game. It was as thrilling as it gets. 

Kumble said he was happy to see the recent performance of the youngsters. 

It (the performance of the team) has been really good. It is a healthy sign indeed, but we have to maintain the good show.

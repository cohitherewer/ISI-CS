 Needed, a fourth Test

Pak SERIES vs ENGLAND 

Karachi: Pakistan will ask England to play four Tests instead of three when they tour the sub-continent this year to try and give their players more experience in the longer version of the game. 

England will play three Tests and five one-day Internationals during their tour of Pakistan in November-December. 

A senior official of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Sunday that it would be asking the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to reconsider the tour schedule. 

?We are keen for England to play four Tests and three one-dayers as we feel Pakistan have not been playing enough Test matches as compared to other countries,? a PCB official said. 

?The Board chairman feels that we have played too many one-day Internationals in recent years compared to Tests,? he added. 

Following Pakistan?s 0-3 defeat to Australia in the three-Test series recently, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said one reason for the poor performance was that new players were not playing enough Tests. (Reuters)

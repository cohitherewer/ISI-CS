 Nisha Mohota closer to title

Bangalore: Top seeded Woman Grandmaster Nisha Mohota (8.5 points) of Bengal inched her way closer to the title in the National womens A chess championship here on Thursday. 

In the 12th and penultimate round, Nisha drew with her teammate and nearest rival Mary Ann Gomes. 

Mary has logged 8 points and closely following on the heels are WGM Aarthie Ramaswamy and WIM Anupama Ghokhale with 7.5 points each. 

In an English opening encounter between Mary and Nisha, the latter made a temporary pawn sacrifice to gain equality and steered the game to a draw in 27 moves. 

In the biggest upset of the day, Kruttika Nadig gave a blow to Anupamas title aspirations, winning in 43 moves. Employing the grunfeld defence, Kruttika shattered Anupamas centre pawn structure in a queen less middle game and obtained a flank passed pawn to win the game. 

Aarthie played the Sicilian Richter Rauzer attack against Bhagyashree Thipsay and sacrificed her rook for a knight and two pawns. Bhagyashree returned the compliment to equalise and obtained a draw in 42 moves.

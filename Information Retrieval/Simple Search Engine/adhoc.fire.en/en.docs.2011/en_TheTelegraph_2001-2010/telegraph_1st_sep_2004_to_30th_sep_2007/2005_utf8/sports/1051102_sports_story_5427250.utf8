 England board unhappy with itinerary

London: England Cricket Board (ECB) were hoping to convince its Indian counterpart into changing the itinerary for their scheduled visit next year, since the one proposed involved hectic travelling, a newspaper report said. 

England are scheduled to play three Tests and seven one-day Internationals from March 8 to April 22. 

Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Mumbai will host the Tests while Goa, Indore, Guwahati, Faridabad, Cuttack, Cochin and Visakhapatnam are the venues for the one-day-ers. 

The ECB feels that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have treated them unfairly in comparison with Australia who played three of their four Tests in major centres ? Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai ? on their 2004 visit, a British newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

The ECB... Will be discussing it (the itinerary) internally and with the BCCI before responding, the paper quoted an ECB spokesman. 

The ECB are also dismayed at the amount of travelling the team faced, particularly during the ODI segment where remote venues would make it difficult for players wives and supporters to travel with the team, the newspaper said. 

The BCCI, however, has said that itinerary was yet to be finalised and the allotment of an ODI to Goa was subject to that venue being cleared after an investigation into sale of duplicate tickets during a match against Australia in 2001. (PTI)

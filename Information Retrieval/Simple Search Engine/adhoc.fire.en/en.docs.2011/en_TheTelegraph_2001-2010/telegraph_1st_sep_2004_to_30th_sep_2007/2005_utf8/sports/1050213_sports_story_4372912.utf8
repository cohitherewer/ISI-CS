 Hoyzer arrested

Frankfurt: German referee Robert Hoyzer was arrested and threatened with a long jail sentence on Saturday with prosecutors saying they had fresh evidence he had been involved in match-fixing prior to 2004. 

?New evidence suggests that Robert Hoyzer was involved in crimes of a similar type with persons unknown prior to those in 2004 that he has already admitted to,? Berlin prosecutor Michael Grunwald said in a statement. 

Against the background of existing admissions and the new evidence, ?Hoyzer must count on a hefty jail sentence?, the prosecutor?s office said. ?For that reason, there is a concrete risk of his absconding.? 

The statement said an order for Hoyzer?s arrest had been issued on Thursday and that police had arrested him on Saturday. 

The scandal is already the biggest in Germany for over 30 years and has tarnished the country?s image as it prepares to host the 2006 World Cup. 

The situation could get worsen if earlier matches are found to have been fixed. The German football association (DFB), which is also investigating the case, declined to comment on Hoyzer?s arrest.

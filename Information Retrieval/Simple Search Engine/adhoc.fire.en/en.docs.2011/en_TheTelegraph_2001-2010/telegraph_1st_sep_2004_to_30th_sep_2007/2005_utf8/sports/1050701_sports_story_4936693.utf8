 Final scoreline an accident 

Kick-Start

 P.K.Banerjee

Let me say that the Confederations Cup final result was an accident. Let me also say that such accidents do happen. Put this match in another place, in another time, the result just will not be this. 

Study early Argentina performances and you will notice that by the time of the final they were off peak, going down, not in the same momentum and phase. More than physical tiredness, you could make out that they had not been able to keep up the motivation and focus. 

We all saw that the Argentines started off well, as a team and played some excellent matches, as did Mexico. And, compare that with the Brazil performance. Their starting wasnt impressive and then, in the final, all Brazilian throttles started firing, which is seldom seen. 

It was a sudden green signal, so to say, to the talented group of the Ronaldinhos and Robinhos to showcase their creativity all together. 

I would also like to say that the rain did Argentina in. Their gameplan was thrown out of gear because they had not factored this part in their strategy. The ball was speedier, and that did not suit the Argentines while falling right into the path of the Brazilian ball-players. Also, they barely expected to suddenly see a highly determined Brazil, and a do-or-die effort. Then, bringing Pablo Aimar in later was not a good decision. 

Think of a player like Lucio. I was awestruck by his energy. He was omnipresent, so to say. Everywhere. He was like oxygen ? you never see it, but its the only thing that keeps you going. Somebody in the old Maldini mould. He was the lifeblood of the rejuvenated Brazil side. 

The problem with the Argentine defence was in overconfidence. They never reacted early, always went into the final tackle. Always at the last moment. 

The Brazilian defence wasnt good either, but there was personal brilliance. Lucio apart, Cicinho was the man who not only defended but almost all goals that Brazil scored had his blessing at one point or other. Of course, Lucio was the Marshall of all. That was the difference. Had the Argentine defence been able to move ahead of the final tackle mindset, they would have been able to cut off Adrianos first goal and Kakas goal as well. 

I must also laud coach Carlos Alberto Parreira for keeping Adriano withdrawn for a while and pushing the high profile Ronaldinho ahead. That meant that two Argentine defenders immediately attached themselves to the star, opening up good spaces for the likes of Adriano, Kaka and Robinho. 

However, this is not an indication that Brazil will be all-beaters in the World Cup. The World Cup is a different ball game. Brazil will need their Cafu, Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo. They are essential, because experience isnt something you can get off the shelves. Ronaldo himself must just be there. 

European football, as a whole, though, suffered a big setback. Germanys was excellent performance, but Greece were awful. I believe the performance of Greece in this tournament gave the Europeans a bad name. The European champions went down, but the way they went down was sad. 

The way Otto Rehaggel had prepared his team for the European Championship was like a military Marshall: formation, system, methodology, he perfected all. That kind of grammar in soccer was seldom to be seen. Maybe they were not in the class of the Hungarians of 1954 or the Dutch of the early 1970s, but they approached perfection as best they could, quite like some old Greek mythology. 

Germany, of course, are the team to look out for in the World Cup. In a war, the losing side often comes back stronger. Because, when you lose, you take down notes, and you rectify faults. In a victory you probably gloss over many mistakes in the euphoria of the win. Losing matches brings you down to earth and you start calculating. 

Klinsmanns team has had a lot of notes made. Not just a Michael Ballack or a Bernd Schneider, there will be kids like Robert Huth to consider. Mexico were a very prepared team in this meet. But it was upto the Germans to expose them. The more you play, and you are studied, all your idiosyncrasies are out in the open, and you are handled that much better in the next match. 

I believe the Japanese were doing the same. I saw them develop in every sphere. Wars do things to people.

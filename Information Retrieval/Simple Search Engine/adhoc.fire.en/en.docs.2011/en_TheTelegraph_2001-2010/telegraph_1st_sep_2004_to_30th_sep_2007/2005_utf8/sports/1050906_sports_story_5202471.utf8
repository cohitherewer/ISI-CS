The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont think anything could convince me to temper my aggression

 - I had a great open... I couldnt have asked for more in my first one: Sania Mirza

That Sania Mirza is a mega-hit with the media as well was evident from the number of questions lobbed at her at the post-Maria Sharapova match conference in New York on Sunday. 

The following are excerpts: 

Q: Was it an enjoyable experience? 

A: Yeah. I mean, there were a lot of games which I could have taken. But I had fun out there. I had a great Open. I dont think I could have asked for more in my first one. Im very happy. 

When you play, you tend to be very aggressive, try risky shots. Do you think your experience here will convince you to temper that a little? 

I dont think anything could convince me to temper that. Thats the sad part. But, I mean, I guess people just have to accept it, you know. Thats how I play. Im going to have maybe 50 unforced errors one day, but Im going to also have 50 winners that day. Thats what I compensated for. I think people just have to accept me the way I play? 

I could add variation to my game, but Im going to win matches only when I hit those winners. If I win matches by moonballing, then Im not going to satisfy myself the way I played that day. I enjoy hitting the ball as hard as I can. I enjoy taking risks. And I believe that you always have to take risks. You know, I enjoyed every minute out there. 

When you play a person as strong as Sharapova, does that make you rethink that a little? 

No, I mean, if I would have pushed the ball, I probably would have lost love and love. So I had to go for my shots, and I did. I got a few. I got a few in. I got a few out. That just gives me experience. Probably next time, you know. Im probably going to have a lot more matches, hopefully, against her, and that was just a lesson. 

What is it youll do differently next time against Sharapova? Anything surprise you about the way she played? 

Lets think about it. I have time to think about it. Ill come up with a game plan, you know. She obviously played some really good shots out there. She gets to a lot more balls, a lot tougher balls ? with a lot of players when I hit them theyre winners ? but she gets to them. Well see. 

You played on Arthur Ashe. Is this the highlight of your career so far? 

Yeah, definitely. I mean, fourth round in a Grand Slam, first US Open, first year on the Tour. I think Im very pleased by the way the year has gone for me till now. 

The last time you played Serena Williams in Australia, you said you were fighting some nerves. Did you have that problem here? How could you compare the two experiences? 

No, I dont think I was nervous, not even a little bit, actually. I was expecting it. I knew it was going to be packed and I was expecting there was going to be a big crowd for her and me. So I was prepared for it mentally. I dont think I was, you know, I wasnt intimidated. 

The fact that there was a large crowd and they seemed to be cheering for you, how does that make you feel? 

Good. Its nice to know that people really like you and theyre really, you know, for you, wherever you go. It just motivates you even more. 

Your second serve was a problem. Youve been working on that. Any regrets on this match? 

No. I mean, you know, I dont have regrets. My serve, weve been trying to work on it, but we couldnt because I had the stomach injury, so really didnt get time in the past month to work on it. I think, except for my serve, I played a good match. I hit the ball well. I was feeling it well. You know, Im just happy that I made it to the fourth round. 

Youve had the fastest climb up the ranks of any WTA player in the past 12 months. What do you think the watershed point was?

I dont know. It just happened. You know, I cant really pinpoint one thing that happened. Just Australia and then I won the tournament in Hyderabad? just gave me more confidence every time I stepped on court. Even this match gives me more confidence, even though the score line is 2 and 1. I think it was much closer than that. 

There were lots of deuces and advantages that I had. There were a lot of breakpoints I had. 4-2, 40-love in the first set ? I mean, love-40 ? I think if I would have broken her, it would have been a different story if it had been 4-3 or 5-2. You know, itll just give me more confidence every time I step out now. 

Do you find at certain points, you pushed back with the groundstrokes. Is that something you can do yourself? 

I always believed that. You know, I always say that I can match the best when it comes to the groundstrokes. Its just probably a few other things like the physical fitness or the serve that I kind of have to work on to, you know, match them. You know, it didnt surprise me. Yeah, like I said, its going to give me confidence the next time I step out on court. 

Surface wise, would this be your favourite or do you think you prefer grass? 

Hardcourt. I mean, you know, we have just one season on grass. Thats just before Wimbledon. I like grass. Its a fast surface. I like fast surfaces. I mean, I definitely prefer hard to any other surface. 

Where do you go from here? 

Bali. I play in Bali and then Calcutta. 

Any words for your audience who was cheering for you? 

Im sorry to have kept you up so late. Its like 2:30 in the morning there. Thanks for all the support. I just hope that I can do better next time. 

Are you really sorry, or would you like to have kept them up for another couple of hours? 

Yeah, hopefully them and me. I guess thats just the way it is.

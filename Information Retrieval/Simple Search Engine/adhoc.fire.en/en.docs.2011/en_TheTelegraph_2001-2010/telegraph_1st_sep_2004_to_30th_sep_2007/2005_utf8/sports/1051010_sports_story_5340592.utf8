 Battling all odds

 - Shooter Joydeep dreams of Olympic participation

Calcutta: Rajyavardhan Sin-gh Rathore had made the country proud by winning the silver (double trap shooting) at the Athens Olympics last year, but unfortunately Bengal has no infrastructure for the sport to nurture talented players. Even the, If someone forges ahead with his own talent and vigour, he has to fight against all odds. 

Joydeep Karmakar, a 26-year-old shooter and son of former national level swimmer Santa, created a flutter by scripting a new national mark in the just concluded West Bengal State Rifle Shooting Championships in September. Joydeep scored 594 out of a maximum 600 in the 50m rifle prone event erasing the old mark of 591 by Joydeep Banerjee a decade ago. 

Good show in the recent years has also earned him a place in the probables camp in New Delhi from October 13, but the city-based shooter has been forced to skip it. My leave was granted late by South Eastern Railway, my employers. It wasnt possible to organise the money needed for attending the camp in such a short time, Joydeep told The Telegraph. 

 Joydeep won the gold in the last senior national meet in Indore. 

The current national champion is aiming to make it big and has just bought equipment worth Rs 1.5 lakh. My dream is to take part in the Olympics and that is pushing me, the shooter said. But his wish may not be fulfilled unless he gets a sponsor or help from the state body. Lack of interest among the common people is also proving a deterrent. 

State body secretary-general BG Mullik, when contacted, assured Joydeep of all he-lp. Our association was mar-red by factionalism for the last five years and we have been in charge for just five months. We are trying to put things in order, Mullik said.

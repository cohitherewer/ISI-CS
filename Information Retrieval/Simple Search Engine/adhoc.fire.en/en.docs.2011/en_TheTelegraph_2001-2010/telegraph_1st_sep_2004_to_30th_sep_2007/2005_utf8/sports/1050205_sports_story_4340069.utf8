 Radical changes proposed in ODI format

 Gavaskar-headed committee has suggested rotating 15-over field restrictions 

Sydney: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is considering radical changes in the one-day format which, if agreed to during its two-day meeting in Melbourne, are likely to be implemented this year itself. 

The ICC Cricket Committee (Playing), headed by Sunil Gavaskar, recommended the rules to make the shorter version of the game ?rather challenging and interesting?. 

According to a report in the Australian media, Gavaskar has said the proposed changes are regarding rotating the 15-over fielding restrictions and a ?double-play? ? when two batsmen may be dismissed off one ball. These moves are already being experimented in South African domestic cricket. 

?I think it has become a little predictable, the one-day game. We?ve looked at a double-play situation, where if a batsman?s been given out lbw and the ball ricochets off to gully and the fielder picks it up and throws it at the non-striker?s end, you can have two dismissals off one ball. Same if the ball?s gone up in the air (and is caught),? Gavaskar was quoted as saying in a Melbourne paper. 

The committee also proposed that fielding restrictions ? now applicable in the first 15 overs of each innings ? should be rotated according to the batting team?s wishes. 

?The first idea was to leave it to the fielding side but then we thought that you might have a situation where the fielding side is so good, they might dismiss the opposition in 35 overs and have no field restrictions at all,? Gavaskar said. ?What we have suggested is that the batting side will choose the 15 overs it wants. That makes it all the more challenging for the fielding side,? he added. 

The changes, if passed by the member countries, could be implemented as early as September, an ICC spokesman said. Gavaskar, however, said, Twenty20 cricket would not be introduced at the international level for a few years, since only Australia are planning to have it at the domestic level after England and South Africa. 

?I don?t think it will be added to the international calendar in a hurry because only three out of 10 teams have got it,? he said. 

Gavaskar also praised the recent improvement in sportsmanship in the Australian team. ?The fact that they realised they would not be remembered as a winning team as fondly as the West Indies were remembered may well have made them look at this. 

?It hasn?t stopped them winning, but it?s made them more likeable. I think there?s been a big change in the Australian approach to the game as far as verbal intimidation of players is concerned. I think there?s been a great improvement,? he said. (PTI)

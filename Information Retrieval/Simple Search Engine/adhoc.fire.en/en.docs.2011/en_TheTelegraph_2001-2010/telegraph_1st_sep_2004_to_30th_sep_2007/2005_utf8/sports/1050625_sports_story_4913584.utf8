 Not just another win

 - Bengal depended on teamwork: Krishnendu

Calcutta: More than individual performances, coach Krishnendu Roy wants to highlight the team effort that helped the under-21 Bengal side battle all odds to emerge champions in Thiruvanthapuram recently. 

The conditions were very tough. We faced stiff opposition from Karnataka, Services, Tamil Nadu and Goa. The refereeing was bad right through the tournament. In the final, one of our stoppers was red carded unfairly at a crucial time leading to our conceding a goal and the match going into the tie-breaker. 

We received no crowd support and had to motivate ourselves. I believe this is not just another victory? It showed the entire country that Bengal football is still alive and kicking, said Roy, who returned to the city with the team Friday morning. 

Roy, however, singled out winger Tapan Maity, stoppers Surajit Chakraborty and Sheikh Azim, and goalkeeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury for special mention. Subhasish was remarkable in the final. Striker Habib Ali, who scored four goals in the tournament, also excelled. 

Subhasish, who was the No. 3 goalkeeper at East Bengal last season, moves to Mahindra United this season. This was his parting gift for Bengal, says the coach. 

The players, including captain Soumik Dey, have a bright future, but Roy says, they have to develop physically if they want to make it big. 

For Roy, personally, this was also his biggest success at the national level so far.

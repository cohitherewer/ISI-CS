 Harbhajan hopeful of good show

 - TOUR OF PAKISTAN 

Jalandhar: Ace off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Thursday expressed confidence that he would be able to repeat his recent performances against Sri Lanka during the Pakistan tour starting early next month. 

I am satisfied after my performance in the India-Sri Lanka series and expect to repeat the same in Pakistan, Harbhajan, who is going on his maiden tour of the neighbouring country, said. 

Harbhajan predicted a tough challenge in Pakistan, saying, After beating England, the morale of the Pakistan team is very high and we have to prove ourselves on the tour. 

The off-spinner heaped praise on Anil Kumble, saying the Karnataka leggie had a big role to play in his success. 

Anil Kumble has provided me great support and the combination of an off and a leg-spinner was the key of our performance, the Turbanator said. 

Commenting on the frequent changes in the batting order in the recent series, Harbhajan said, As long as experiments pay, we must do the same, and moreover, the strategy in a particular series or match depends on the coach and captain. 

When asked if he expected to be recognised as an allrounder after his unbeaten knock of 40 in the recent Ahmedabad Test, the spinner said, Let me prove my mettle in batting first.

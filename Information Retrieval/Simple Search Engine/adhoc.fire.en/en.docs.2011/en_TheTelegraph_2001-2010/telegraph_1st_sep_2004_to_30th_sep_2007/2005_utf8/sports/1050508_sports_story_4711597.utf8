 Justine in title round

Berlin: Former world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne was in ominous form as she demolished seventh seed Patty Schnyder 6-0, 6-1 to reach the German Open final on Saturday. 

Henin-Hardenne easily outclassed her Swiss opponent to extend her winning streak to 16 matches and will face sixth seed Nadia Petrova of Russia in Sundays title match as she bids to win her third German Open.Nadia beat Jelena Jankovic 6-4, 6-7, 6-3. 

The Belgian 22-year-old broke Schnyders opening service game with forehand winners and made the most of the wet conditions that slowed down play on the red clay. 

?I won that match very easily and I am happy about that,? she said. ?I fought for every ball and was very aggressive in the court. I was going for winners but was patient.? 

Ranked 15th in the world after a long spell out through illness last year and an injury at the start of this season, the resurgent Belgian has won two of the three previous events she has played since her return in March. (Reuters)

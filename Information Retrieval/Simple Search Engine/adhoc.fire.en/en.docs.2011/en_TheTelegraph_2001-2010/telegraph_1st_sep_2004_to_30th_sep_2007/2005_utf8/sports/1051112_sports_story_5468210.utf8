 Ritwik beats Saurav, regains crown 

Mumbai: Top seed Ritwik Bhattacharya of New Delhi dethroned defending champion Saurav Ghosal of Tamil Nadu to regain the mens crown, while Joshna Chinappa of Tamil Nadu retained the womens title, in the 53rd senior national and 30th Bombay Gymkhana Maharashtra State Open Squash Championships, here on Friday. 

Bhattacharya, winner in 2003, brushed aside the loss of the second game to cruise to a convincing 9-3, 3-9, 9-4, 9-5 victory in a quality championship round. 

The formidable Ghosal, seeded No. 2, struggled to keep his hopes alive against an opponent who was enjoying a good season and is on a roll. Bhattacharya, who recently beat Ghosal in the quarter finals in the Athens Open, was supremely confident and always in command. He played to a plan and executed it to perfection. 

I am certainly enjoying my squash. I think playing the CCI-Western India Open last week was a nice way to warm up for the big occasion, revealed a delighted Bhattacharya, ranked No. 59 in the world. 

World junior No. 2 Chinappa continued her domination of the sport as she crushed second seed Deepali Anwekar Parikh of Maharashtra 9-4, 9-0, 9-2 to clinch the womens crown for the successive year for a tally of five national titles. 

In one of the most exciting finals in the Maharashtra State Open, second seed A. Parthiban of Tamil Nadu upset top seed Sandeep Jangra of Maharashtra 9-7, 8-10, 9-3, 5-9, 9-6 in an 85-minute thriller to clinch the boys under-19 crown. 

Sachika Balwani of Maharashtra experienced mixed fortunes following her victory in the girls under-15 final and defeat in the under-13 final. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Under-19 title for Mohun Bagan

Mumbai: Finally, some succour for beleaguered Mohun Bagan. The clubs colts soaked up pressure from arch-rivals East Bengal for two hours before pipping the latters 3-1 via the penalty shoot-out to lift the third junior (under-19) ONGC Cup for first division NFL teams here Saturday. 

The hero for Bagan, who ceded considerable ground to their Calcutta rivals in regulation time and in 30 minutes of extra time, was their diminutive keeper Uttam Patra, who blocked three shots by diving to his left in the spot-kick duel. 

Patra had come to his sides rescue earlier in the game too, by coming up with good saves off close-range tries. 

Goalless after 90 minutes of regular time and half an hour of extra time, East Bengals Avishek Aich opened the scoring by converting his spot-kick. But his teammates ? Swarnabha Barua, captain Mohan Sarkar and Arun Dutta ? saw their shots blocked. 

The scorers for Bagan from the penalty spot in the scrappy match in which considerable time was consumed to treat injuries were captain Mohan Chakraborty, Ravi Kant Ghosh and Lal Malswama. 

East Bengal dominated the major part of the match and could have scored in the 31st minute, but Patra foiled Gauranga Biswas close-range shot. (PTI)

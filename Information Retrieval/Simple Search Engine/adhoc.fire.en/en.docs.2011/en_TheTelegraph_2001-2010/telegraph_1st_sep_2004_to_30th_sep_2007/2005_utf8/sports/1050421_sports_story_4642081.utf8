 West Indies sponsorship row ends

Port-of-Spain: Saying it does not want players to have to choose between endorsement deals and their careers, Cable and Wireless has terminated its deals with three West Indies cricketers, a spokeswoman has said of what appears to resolve a drawnout sponsorship conflict. 

The dispute over seven players? personal endorsement contracts with the Britain-based communications giant while rival communications company Digicel was sponsoring the West Indies Cricket Board has kept some top performers out of play recently, including former captain Brian Lara. 

Fast bowler Fidel Edwards, allrounder Dwyane Bravo and batsman Dwayne Smith agreed to terminate their contracts with Cable and Wireless, a company spokeswoman said. 

?We do not want to put the players in a position where they have to choose between the contracts with us and their careers,? she said. 

She said Lara remains under contract to Cable and Wireless.

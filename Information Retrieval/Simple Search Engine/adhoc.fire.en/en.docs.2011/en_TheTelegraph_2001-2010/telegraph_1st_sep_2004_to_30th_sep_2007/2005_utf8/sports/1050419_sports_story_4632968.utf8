 Bagan earn a point vs Vasco

Margao: Substitute Levy Coelho?s injury-time goal helped Vasco hold Mohun Bagan to a 1-1 draw in the 18th round of the National Football League for the ONGC Cup at the Nehru Stadium here Monday. 

Both teams started cautiously before Bagan got one through in the 68th minute. Substitute Jerry Zirsangma?s cross from the right reached Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?. Beto fumbled on first try but luckily the ball rebounded off rushing ?keeper Virender Singh. Beto made no mistake this time. 

Vasco charged back, and after two misses found the equaliser in the injury time. Sidney Rodrigues floated a flag-kick into the box where ?keeper Subrata Paul punched, but only till substitute Levy Coelho who headed in to give Vasco one point. 

Bagan have collected 18 points from 18 matches, while Vasco, struggled to move above State Bank of Travancore to 11th place with 14 points. 

The first half was confined to the midfield as both the teams adopted a cautious approach. 

Bagan, who had better ball possession, dictated terms and had the best chance to surge ahead in the 19th minute but Dharamjit Singh?s shot off a Tomba Singh cross was well-saved by ?keeper Virender Singh. 

Vasco found hard to breach the rival defence in the first half and had a chance after the interval but Fabio Soares, who was unmarked inside the box, directed a weak shot off a diagonal pass from Francis Fernandes from the right, which Pal managed to collect. 

 Mahindra win 

Meanwhile, Jatin Bisht (55th) and Abhishek Yadav (59th) scored a goal each in the second half to help Mahindra United beat State Bank of Travancore (SBT) 2-1 in a NFL match in Kozhikode on Monday. 

The bankmen reduced the margin in injury time through substitute Mohammed Aslam, adds another report. 

Mahindra initially allowed SBT to go on the attack but came up with a strong defence, denying the hosts any opportunity. 

SBT striker N.P. Pradeep?s two solo runs in the 22nd and 27th minute could not beat the visitors? custodian Sandip Nandy, while an ambitious try by Ignatius Sylvester also went wide off the mark in the 32nd minute. 

After 18 matches, sbt look set for relegation as they continue in the 11th spot with just 13 points. (PTI)

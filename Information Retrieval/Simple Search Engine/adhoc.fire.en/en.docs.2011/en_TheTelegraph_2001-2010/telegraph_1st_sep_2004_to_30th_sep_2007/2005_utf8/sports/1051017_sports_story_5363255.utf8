 City scrape past West Ham

London: Manchester City maintained their flying start to the Premier League season with a 2-1 home win over West Ham United on Sunday. 

Andy Cole got both goals the day after his 34th birthday as City moved to fourth in the standings on 17 points behind Manchester United on goal difference. Champions Chelsea lead the way on 27, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur with 18. 

Promoted West Ham arrived in Manchester having lost only once this season but were second-best against a home side who created a host of chances. 

Cole opened the scoring after 18 minutes with an expertly-taken goal as he curled the ball around keeper Roy Carroll with his right foot from wide on the left of the area. City had two other efforts cleared off the line in the first period as they attacked at every opportunity. 

Earlier on Sunday, Aston Villa beat Birmingham City 1-0 away, their first victory against their neighbours since Birminghams return to the top flight in 2002. Kevin Philips scored. (Reuters)

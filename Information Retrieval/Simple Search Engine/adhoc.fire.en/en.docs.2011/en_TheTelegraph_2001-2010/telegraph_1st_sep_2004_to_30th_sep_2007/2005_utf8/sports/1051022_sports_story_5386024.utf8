 Ricky Ponting counters Fletcher charge

 Ponting

Brisbane: England coach Duncan Fletcher may be trying to deflect criticism of his own team by attacking Australia over their behaviour during the recent Ashes series, captain Ricky Ponting said on Friday. 

Fletcher, in his new book, accused Ponting and his teammates of verbal abuse, physical intimidation and hypocrisy during Englands momentous 2-1 series win over the Aussies last month. 

Ponting has been critical of Englands tactics of using specialist fieldsmen as substitutes in Test matches. 

In his book, The Coachs Story, to be released next week, Fletcher said Australia had been guilty of flouting the spirit of the game and that Ponting and vice-captain Adam Gilchrist had confronted umpires with overbearing body language. 

Fletcher said Ponting blew his top when he smiled at him after he was run out in the fourth Test by Gary Pratt, a crack substitute fielder, who had been subbed on for a bowler. 

Ponting said he was disappointed by Fletchers latest broadside, suggesting it sounded more like England had lost the Ashes, not won them after 18 years. 

I dont recall having any of the umpires speak to me or any of the match officials speak to other than that one incident in which I was fined for, Ponting said here on Friday. 

We did everything in our power to play the game in the right spirit. 

I think that was pretty evident right through the whole series and weve been applauded for the way we played through the series, Ponting said. 

I dont know if hes trying to cover his own backside a little bit with a lot of these allegations directed at us now, the Australian skipper said. 

Its all coming after some allegations were made against him about the way England conducted themselves through the tour. To be honest, I dont really care. 

Ponting said it was Fletchers smile from the England team balcony after he was run out by Pratt that incensed him and led to him being fined. 

That was probably what got my back up more than anything was to have their coach standing on the balcony smiling at me once I was dismissed from a Test match, he said. 

He knew what the whole substitute issue meant to the Australian team after we made a big song and dance about it before the first one-day International was played at the start of the summer. 

We didnt think it was right. They continued doing it and nothing was done about it. 

Australian opening batsman Matthew Hayden questioned why Fletcher had waited until Ponting and the Australian team were home before firing his salvo. 

Hes a long, long way away, isnt he? Hayden said. Hes 22 hours flight away, isnt he? We wont play them for another 18 months and the Australian captain will still be Ricky Ponting and hes going to have a few more titles under his belt than England I would have thought. 

Glenn McGrath said Fletchers accusations of bad sportsmanship were disappointing as the spirit between the two teams had been exceptional throughout the series. After every game we went in and had a drink with them and they came in with us and thats the way it should be played (and) hard and tough out in the middle, he said. (AFP)

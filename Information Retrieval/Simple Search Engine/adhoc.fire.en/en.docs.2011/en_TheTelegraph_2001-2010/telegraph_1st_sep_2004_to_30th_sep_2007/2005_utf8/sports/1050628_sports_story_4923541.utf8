 We have capacity to deliver in final

Hanover: A tearful Jose Pekerman took time out from the teams semi-final celebrations to remember the young Argentina goalkeeper who died on Saturday night. 

Argentina, wearing black armbands, beat Mexico 6-5 on penalties to reach the Confederations Cup final after the match finished 1-1 after 120 minutes. 

Afterwards, Pekerman revealed the teams sadness at the death of 17-year-old Emiliano Molina.4 

I couldnt leave here without talking about this on a very sad day for Argentina, Pekerman said, as his eyes reddened with tears. 

We were playing with black armbands because we have lost a great young player. 

Independiente goalkeeper Molina, a member of his countrys under-17 team this year, died on Saturday in Buenos Aires from serious injuries suffered in a car crash 12 days earlier. 

Argentina displayed little of the inventiveness that had characterised their Group A matches as they scraped through to reach Wednesdays final against Brazil. 

Mexico took the lead in a drab encounter with a deflected Carlos Salcido goal 14 minutes into extra-time, with Luciano Figueroa bundling in a shot six minutes later to send the game into penalties. 

I agree it was not a great match but we fought hard, especially in second half and extra time, said Pekerman. 

We didnt want to settle for a draw. We were fighting to win. It was not one of our best matches but everyone worked very hard. The team has the capacity to deliver a very good match against Brazil in the final. 

Mexico coach Ricardo La Volpe, himself an Argentine, was annoyed at the refereeing by Roberto Rosetti, particularly the decision not to send off Argentine defender Fabricio Coloccini for a bad foul on Ramon Morales. 

It was a very tight match, La Volpe said. When you are one goal up against a team like Argentina, you have to do a lot of work to keep them out of your half but Argentina kept up the pressure and equalised. 

Yes, we had a problem with some of the decisions. Coloccini should have been sent off for that very aggressive foul. 

We thought there could have been a red card but you have to respect the decisions of the referees. 

Javier Zanetti celebrated his 100th cap by inspiring Argentina to reach the final ? a victory he said was written in the stars. 

When the penalties were about to start I did look up and think that this was a match we couldnt lose, on the night of my 100th cap, said Zanetti, who became only the second Argentine to reach the milestone after Diego Simeone, who played 106 times for his country. 

Meanwhile, a relieved but weary Argentina are hoping they can recharge their batteries for the final against arch-rivals Brazil. 

We knew it wouldnt be easy because theyre very quick and knock the ball around well, striker Javier Saviola said on Sunday after the match. Now weve got to recover and get ready to face Brazil. Well just have to wait and see if they can make their extra rest day count, he added. 

Brazil, inspired by the attacking quartet of Adriano, Kaka, Robinho and Ronaldinho, outclassed Germany in Nuremberg on Saturday with a 3-2 win that left little doubt about who were the better side. 

Their top players will take the pitch for the final on Wednesday, while Argentina will have to make do without the darting Saviola, who picked up a red card for a late kick on Mexican Gonzalo Pineda. 

What we need to do now is to sleep, eat and get a good rest, said Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, who scored the winning penalty against Mexico. I think we showed a lot of character out there. Now weve got to be positive for the Brazil game. 

Adriano injury 

Leading Brazil striker Adriano limped out of training in Frankfurt with an ankle injury in on Monday, two days before the Confederations Cup final against Argentina. 

Adriano was forced out around 45 minutes into the session but the team doctor played down the extent of the injury. 

This was done as a precaution, Jose Luiz Runco told reporters at the team training ground. I dont believe hes a doubt for Wednesday. 

Well use ice on the left ankle and he should be able to resume training on Tuesday.

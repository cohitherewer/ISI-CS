 Pak have always respected Sourav

 - India should be ready for big surprise: Moin 

 Moin Khan 

Karachi: Former captain Moin Khan on Monday said the controversy surrounding Sourav Gangulys comeback could put him under undue pressure against Pakistan who are better prepared to take on India this time around. 

Moin said Pakistan were a more mature and united unit now under Inzamam-ul Haq and the win against England had boosted their confidence for the upcoming three-Test series against the arch-rivals. In such a scenario, he said, it was imperative for the Indian cricketers to stay focussed on the game rather than bother about off-field controversies. 

This is obviously not the right beginning for the Indian team. On such a huge tour, the players want to be relaxed so that they can concentrate and stay focused rather being left pondering if they had been included in the side through the back door, said the 34-year-old veteran of 69 Tests. 

This is certainly not good for Sourav and the Indian cricket team. Sourav is an experienced campaigner and deserves respect. By questioning his inclusion, the critics are putting him under pressure for which the team might have to pay the price. Because if Sourav is in the squad, he has to be in the playing line-up than being on the substitute bench, he said. 

Moin said he had been involved in several duels with Sourav and he had found him a tough competitor. The Pakistan team has always respected Sourav because he is a tough competitor. But if you keep pinching him, like any toughest campaigner, Sourav will also crack and lose confidence. 

His morale and confidence is certainly down ever since the Zimbabwe tour and if the debate on his selection lingers on, he will be a shattered player even before he takes the field in Pakistan. I know Kaif and his supporters would feel let down by the selectors, but thats the name of the game. 

Moin, who played four Tests and 49 one-dayers against India, also said India should be ready for a big Pakistan surprise. 

To begin with, this Pakistan team is not the one that lost early last year. It is a more mature, experienced and united bunch of cricketers being admirably led by Inzamam from the front. 

Secondly, the home team has a reborn Shoaib Akhtar. 

Thirdly, to beat a team like England who had come here after defeating Australia for the first time in 18 years, has given this team the confidence that was required, the former wicketkeeper said. 

Moin disclosed he had exchanged notes with Inzamam regarding the Indian series. 

He has some very interesting ideas that can take the Indians by surprise.

 Players didn?t do justice to their talent: Shaharyar 

Islamabad: Abdul Razzaq has the potential to become a Kallis, Azhar Mahmood a Flintoff, Shoaib Akthtar a McGrath and Saqlain Mushtaq a Warne, but they have all failed to do justice to their talent because they lack motivation, according to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan. 

?...Quite honestly these players did not do justice to their talent. They started off well but sort of lost their way and their form has been chequered. They are all winners but have not won us many matches,? the PCB chief was quoted as saying in a Pakistan. 

Shaharyar, under pressure to act tough after the team?s defeat in Test and triangular one-day series in Australia, said he believed Inzamam-ul Haq and his boys would do well during the upcoming series against India. 

?I am sure these boys will do very well in India after the tough Aussie tour,? he said, while strongly defending his decision to persist with coach Bob Woolmer. 

The chairman said Woolmer?s progress with the team was being affected by ?low level of education? of Pakistan?s players. 

?The problem is that the level of education of the players is such that they don?t absorb. It is not that they don?t understand,? he said. 

?Woolmer is a sincere, extremely competent fellow who needs to be given some time to achieve the desired results. He is working hard at the moment.? 

He also said communication was not a problem for Woolmer. 

?On Woolmer?s part I do not think communication with the boys is a problem because most of them have played in county cricket. But yes, an educated person?s approach is definitely different,? he said. (PTI)

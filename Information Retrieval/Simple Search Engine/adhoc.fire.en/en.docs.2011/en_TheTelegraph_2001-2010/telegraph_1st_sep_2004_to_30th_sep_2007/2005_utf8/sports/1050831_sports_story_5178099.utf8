 Ferrari eyeing points, not podium

 - Istanbul our worst performance this season, says Schumi 

 Schumacher is optimistic before race at home track

London: Points, rather than podiums, may be the best Ferrari can hope for from their home Italian Grand Prix this weekend, according to Formula One champion Michael Schumacher. 

The team has won their home race for the last three years, but have struggled all season to match the pace of Renault and McLaren. 

The champions, now 44 points behind leaders Renault with five races remaining, looked completely out of sorts at the last round in Turkey. 

Seven-time champion Schumacher failed to finish while Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello was 10th. 

Contrary to the past years, when we mostly came to Monza to fight for the win, our expectations are a bit reduced this time, Schumacher said on his website. 

The test last week showed an improvement, but Im not sure if we can hope for a podium position or a performance similar to Hungary, added the German, who started last months Hungarian GP on pole position and finished second. 

But we can compete to score some points, and even though that cant be our true aim, its still a step back in the direction of our old strength. 

Ferrari have won the last six constructors titles while Schumacher has been champion for five years in a row. 

That dominance peaked last year, when Ferrari won 15 of the 18 races. 

This season the Italian team has just one victory ? in the US GP that was reduced to a six-car fiasco when all the Michelin-equipped teams pulled out before the start due to tyre safety concerns. 

After raising hopes in Budapest, Istanbul came as a major disappointment. 

That was surely our worst performance this season, and also in a long time, said Schumacher. After Hungary we had thought that maybe we could turn things around and get back on the track to success, so the race in Turkey was a major setback. 

Schumacher, 36, has won the Italian GP four times and has been in the points in every race he has finished in Monza since 1991. 

The races that are coming up are all in places where weve been successful in the past and that we know well, said the German. Im optimistic that well be doing better again soon. 

Meanwhile, Italian Grand Prix organisers fear Ferraris poor form is having an impact on ticket sales for Sundays race. 

 quot;Ticket sales are down on previous years and this is troubling us, quot; Milan Automobile Club president Ludovico Grandi said on Tuesday. 

 quot;On the one hand costs are going up and on the other the returns are going down while the competition is growing from emerging countries, as Turkey, China and Bahrain have demonstrated. quot; 

Enrico Ferrari, director of the Monza circuit, said ticket sales were down 15 percent on last year despite prices being reduced, although the organisers hoped for an improvement leading up to the weekend.

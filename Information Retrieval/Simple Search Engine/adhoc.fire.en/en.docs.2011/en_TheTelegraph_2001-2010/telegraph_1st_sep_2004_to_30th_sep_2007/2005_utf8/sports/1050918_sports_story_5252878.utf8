 Uncertainty over Sachin return

Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar is yet to confirm his participation in a competitive cricket tournament here next week, former India spinner Sunil Joshi said, retracting his earlier statement confirming the return of the batting ace to competitive cricket. 

Joshi had told reporters earlier on Saturday that Sachin, on the sidelines for months following an elbow injury, would play for MRF in the Canara Bank Centenary Cricket Championship 2005 commencing here on Monday.

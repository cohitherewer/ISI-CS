 Tania Ganguli bags gold

Thrissur: Tania Ganguli of Railways picked up the spring board diving gold in the 59th National Aquatic Championships at the Aquatic Complex here this morning, accumulating 379.95 points. 

The 20-year old Tania, a junior clerk in the Eastern Railways, has been winning the event for the last three consecutive years. However, her brilliant effort was not enough to better her own previous record of 389.50 points registered at Delhi in 2004. 

 Mamoni Mondal, also of Railways, who had won the silver medal in the high board diving earlier, took the silver with 363.60 points while Karishma Mohite of Karnataka clinched the bronze with 325.30 points. 

Meanwhile, Karnataka swimmers continued their domination in the pool, bagging yet another gold in the 4x100 medley relay finals. 

The formidable Karnataka quartet, comprising N. A. Sandeep, J. P. Arjun, Rehan Poncha and Aniketh DSouza, proved too good for their rivals, as they secured the gold, clocking 4:06:71 seconds. 

The race turned out to be a fight for the second and third place between defending champion and record holder Police and Services before the Police team claimed the silver in 4:10:43 seconds and Services settled for bronze in 4:10:86 seconds. 

Defending champions Kerala will cross swords with Police in the waterpolo final. 

In the semi-finals, Kerala defeated Bengal 3-2 after leading 2-0 at the interval. Keralas star shooter Biji scored two goals, while Praveena scored the other. Puspa scored both the goals for Bengal.

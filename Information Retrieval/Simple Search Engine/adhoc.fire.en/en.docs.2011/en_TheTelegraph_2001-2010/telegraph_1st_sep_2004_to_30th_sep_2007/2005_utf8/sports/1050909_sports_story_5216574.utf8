 Arjun Singh best Indian in Round I

 - SINGAPORE GOLF 

 Arjun Singh began the day well, but stumbled towards the end 

Singapore: Arjun Singh stumbled at the end but still emerged as the best among the 12-strong Indian contingent after the first round of the $2 million Singapore Open, on Thursday at the Serapong Golf Course in Sentosa island. 

Arjun was cruising at two-under 16 before he lost two shots in as many holes, finding the bunker on the par-three eighth and missing a 10-foot par putt on the ninth, which was his closing hole for the day. 

It was a bad finish after a fairly good day, Arjun said. I did pretty well through the day and had birdies on all par fives. 

The other Indians in the field struggled on the spectacular but demanding course. The morning rain also added to the problems. 

Jyoti Randhawa played the first ten holes in rain. He finished with a three-over 74. Firoz Ali struggled to a nine-over 80. 

Ashok Kumar brought in a creditable one-over 72 on a tough day, while Jeev Milkha Singh and Rahil Gangjee, both past winners on the Asian Tour, had to be satisfied with a 74 each. Gangjee had just one birdie and four bogeys in his 74. 

Harmeet Kahlon, Amandeep Johl, Uttam Singh Mundy and Digvijay Singh were four-over at 75, while Gaurav Ghei after a decent start, ended with a six-over 77. Shiv Kapur shot the worst round of his professional life with a 10-over 81. 

The leader-board had three players sharing the lead at four-under 67 ?? Thongchai Jaidee and Chapchai Nirat both from Thailand, and Korean-born American Anthony Kang. 

World No.7 Adam Scott and US Tour player Craig Parry were tied for 12th at one-under 70, while Lee Westwood and Nick Hern were tied at even par 71.

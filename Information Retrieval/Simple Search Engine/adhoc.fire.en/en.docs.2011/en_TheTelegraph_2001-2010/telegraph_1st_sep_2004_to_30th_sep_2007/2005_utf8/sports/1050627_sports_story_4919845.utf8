 Fifa goes to the heart of the matter

Hanover: All 32 teams at next years World Cup finals will be required to present evidence that their players hearts are in good condition in an effort to prevent further cases of sudden cardiac arrest in footballers. 

Fifa announced the initiative on Sunday on the second anniversary of the death of Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe, who collapsed in the 72nd minute of his countrys Confederations Cup semi-final against Colombia in Lyon, France on June 26, 2003 and was later pronounced dead in hospital. 

The aim is to identify problems in advance, using special sports-cardiological diagnostics, said Fifa medical co-ordinator Professor Toni Graf-Baumann of Germany. 

There have been an alarming number of similar cases recently, including those of Hungary international Miklos Feher of Benfica, who died after collapsing from a heart attack in January 2004, and Sae Caetano defender Serginho, who died in a Brazilian championship match in October the same year.

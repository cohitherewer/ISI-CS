Brasilia: Brazil striker Adriano scored a hattrick in a 5-0 win over Chile on Sunday to guarantee the world champions a place at next years finals in Germany, while Marcelo Zalayeta emulated him to give Uruguay a dramatic 3-2 win over Colombia. 

Brazils win means they keep up their record as the only country to have played at every World Cup finals, while Uruguays victory lifted them into the fifth-place play-off position in the 10-nation South American group. 

Uruguays win also helped Ecuador and Paraguay, third and fourth respectively. 

Ecuador need only a draw at home to Uruguay next month to qualify, while a win in Venezuela will be enough for Paraguay to book their place with one game to spare. 

After 16 rounds of the marathon contest, Argentina, who qualified last June and lost 0-1 to Paraguay on Saturday, lead with 31 points followed by Brazil on 30. 

Ecuador have 26 after their 2-1 win in Bolivia on Saturday and Paraguay are one point behind after their first win over Argentina in a World Cup qualifier. 

Colombia and Chile, on 20 points, could still finish fifth and Venezuela, who have 18 points, also have an outside chance, although their final match is away to Brazil. 

Brazil, who became the first defending champions forced to qualify for the subsequent tournament under a new Fifa ruling, raced to a four-goal lead in less than half an hour against bemused opponents. 

Central defender Juan made the breakthrough after 11 minutes with a close-range header from a corner and Robinho added the second 11 minutes later as he finished off a sweeping move which went from one end of the field to the other. 

Adriano then added two more goals in a three-minute spell, the first a low shot into the far corner from Robinhos pass in the 27th minute and the second a header from a corner. 

The Inter Milan player completed his hattrick in injury time. 

The important thing was that we qualified, said Adriano, who is still fighting for a regular place in the team. I hope to continue like this and slowly but surely Ill get there. 

His striking partner Ronaldo, who went off at halftime complaining of muscular discomfort, completed his sixth international without scoring. 

In stark contrast to the festive atmosphere in Brasilia, Colombia faced a rowdy, hostile 60,000 crowd at Centenario Stadium in Montevideo. 

Zalayeta headed Uruguay in front from Alvaro Recobas cross two minutes before halftime and put the Sky Blues in a commanding position when he fired the second past Miguel Calero six minutes into the second half. 

But with 12 minutes to go and Uruguay apparently coasting, Colombia fought back. 

Elkin Soto reduced the arrears with a fulminating 25-metre shot from Angels neat layoff in the 79th minute. Two minutes later, Soto returned the compliment by bursting to the by-line and providing the cross for the Aston Villa striker to head the equaliser. 

With the stadium silent and Uruguay coach Jorge Fossati disconsolate on the touchline, Uruguay found a winner with four minutes to go. 

Fabian Estoyanoffs cross from the right eluded the Colombia defence and found Zalayeta lurking at the far post, leaving him with the easy job of tapping into the empty net. 

In African qualifying, early goals from Michael Essien and Matthew Amoah earned Ghana a comfortable 2-0 win over Uganda in Kumasi on Sunday and put them one point away from their first World Cup finals appearance. 

Ghana moved three points clear at the top of the African Zone group II standings and can now only be caught by the Democratic Republic of Congo, who were 2-1 home winners over the Cape Verde Islands. 

Essien, who recently signed for English champions Chelsea, scored in the 11th minute and Dutch-based striker Amoah got the second four minutes later as Ghana made a perfect start in front of an expectant crowd. 

South Africa, hosts of the 2010 World Cup, can now kiss the 2006 finals in Germany goodbye. 

The South Africans were scuppered by a 1-3 defeat in Burkina Faso on Saturday and by Ghanas victory on Sunday. With only one game left they need a miracle goal-glut to have even the slightest hope of qualifying. 

Cameroon, meanwhile, scored a late winner to upset the Ivory Coast 3-2 and put themselves one win away from a fifth successive World Cup finals appearance.

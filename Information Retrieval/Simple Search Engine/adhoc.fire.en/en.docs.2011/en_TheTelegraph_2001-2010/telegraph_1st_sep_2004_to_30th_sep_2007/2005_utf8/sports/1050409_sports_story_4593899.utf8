The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Injury-hit Bagan take on Mahindra

 - NFL 

- Sporting down JCT 1-0 

 Ancheri has a slim chance of playing 

Mumbai: Injuries to veteran defender Jo Paul Ancheri and striker Ashim Biswas and an unwell attacker Sunil Chhetri have put Mohun Bagan in a tight corner ahead of their 16th round National Football League clash for the ONGC Cup against hosts Mahindra United here Saturday. 

Coach Amal Dutta, who has been trying to give a fresh lease of life to the beleaguered team, said: ?Ashim has a knee injury for which he?s going to be operated upon while Chhetri is down with malaria. We will miss both.? 

Dutta, who took over from sacked coach Subrata Bhattacharya, said he will most probably miss Ancheri as well after the player aggravated an old knee injury in practice. ?He?s come with the team, but may not be able to play even for a short while,? Dutta said adding, his team is gradually settling down after his take-over a few days ago. 

Bagan were lying seventh on the league table with 17 points from 15 matches while Mahindra, looking far from champion material themselves, had 21 from the same number and occupying the sixth slot. 

?Since I took over, we have drawn with Dempo (0-0) and State Bank of Travancore (1-1). The team given to me has not been built up by me as the recruitment has been done before I took over. It takes some time to settle down. I am expecting a much better performance Saturday,? Dutta said. 

The fact that Bagan have conceded more goals than they have scored resulting in only four wins as compared to six losses, is an apt indication of the lack of striking prowess in the Calcutta giants. 

The absence of Biswas and Chhetri puts extra burden on Brazilian Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? who has been their most successful forward with four goals to his credit. 

Biman Mondal or Abhay Kumar is likely to be fielded up front along with the Brazilian. 

If Bagan have their own worries in the frontline, Mahindra have been equally unimpressive on this front with their Brazilian imports Rodrigo da Silva and Flavio Rodrigues found wanting. Even India star Shanmugham Venkatesh has looked far from impressive in the midfield. 

Dudu heads in winner 

In Ludhiana, Sporting Clube de Goa pipped JCT Mills, Phagwara, 1-0 in a 16th-round clash on Friday. Nigerian Dudu Omagbemi headed in a fine winner in the 20th minute. 

Sporting took their tally to 32 points to remain second in the league behind East Bengal while JCT remained on 22 points.Dudu, who now has 13 goals, was declared Man of the Match. (PTI)

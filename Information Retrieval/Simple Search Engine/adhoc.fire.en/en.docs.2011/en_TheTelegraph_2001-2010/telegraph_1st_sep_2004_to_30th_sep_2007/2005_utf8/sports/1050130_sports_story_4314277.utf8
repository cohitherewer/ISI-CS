The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I drew strength from bleak days: Serena 

Melbourne: Professional misery and personal heartache over the past two years drove Serena Williams right through the pain barrier to the Australian Open crown, the American said on Saturday. 

The seventh seed staged a stunning comeback to beat Lindsay Davenport 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 at Melbourne Park before saying she had been through too much in the past two years to consider giving in to a back injury which struck at the start of the match. 

The 2003 champion suffered the injury in the opening game of the final but bravely fought back to defeat world number one Davenport in a display of heart and determination. 

?She was killing me in the first set but I just thought, ?Enough... I?m not going to lose,? Williams said. 

?Lindsay had me on the run, I was running for a ball on my backhand and my back went out. I?m not as young as I used to be,? the 23-year-old smiled. 

The remarkable comeback gave Williams her seventh Grand Slam title and her first since Wimbledon in 2003. 

It was soon after that victory that Williams endured a bleak period in her life which included the death of one of her elder sisters, the separation of her parents and an extended lay-off after knee surgery. 

She won tournaments in Miami and Beijing after her comeback last year but also endured the disappointment of being beaten in the finals of Wimbledon and the season-ending WTA Championships, losing to Russian teenager Maria Sharapova both times. 

Williams said those experiences had made her more determined to battle back and that she drew strength from them in the final. 

?It means a lot to me. I went to a few finals last year and I went so close and didn?t win, so I really didn?t want it to happen again,? she said. 

A jaded Davenport later admitted that fatigue had played a major part as her hopes of a first Grand Slam title in five years were dashed. 

Having reached the womens doubles final with Corina Morariu and played back-to-back three-set matches to make the singles final, Davenport had spent more than 15-and-a-half hours on court in the run-up to her meeting with Williams. 

?It was definitely physically, really getting down there for sure,? the world number one said. ?But I?m sure (the mental aspect) played some part in it, too. 

?I think more than anything, just especially this last week, (I spent) a lot of hours on the court, just a lot of close, long matches. My body?s definitely a little bit worn down. I think at the end, I was just overall a little bit fatigued.?

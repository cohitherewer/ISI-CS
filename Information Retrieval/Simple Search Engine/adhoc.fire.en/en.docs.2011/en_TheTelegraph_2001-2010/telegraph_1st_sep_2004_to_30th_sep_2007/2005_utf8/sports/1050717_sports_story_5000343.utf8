The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sunday, July 17, 2005 

 Calcutta: The BCCI has roped in the country?s two leading legal brains, Siddhartha Shankar Ray and Soli Sorabjee, in its bid to prepare a water-tight defence for regular Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly, before the ICC-appointed arbitrator, Justice Albie Sachs in the six-match ban issue.

 The written submission has to reach Sachs by Wednesday, and the parties can reply to what the other has contended by noon (UK time) on July 22.

 Buenos Aires: An Argentine bull almost ended world rally champion Sebastien Loeb?s hopes of a record sixth win in a row. The Citroen driver had a close escape in Friday?s opening leg of the Rally of Argentina when his was the first car on the road in the day?s seventh, 21-km ?La Cumbre 2? stage.

 ?I came across a bull standing in the middle of the road,? the Frenchman said. ?I thought it was going to move and it was only at the last minute that I realised it wasn?t going to budge. I took to the ditch and punctured my front left tyre, but I still hit the animal with the front right corner. The damage was only superficial ? the bonnet, a wing, the front bumper ? but it was a big scare. You sometimes need a little luck and I was lucky. It could have been much, much worse.? 

 Sao Paulo: Sao Paulo supporters went on the rampage after their team won the Libertadores Cup on Thursday night, smashing newspaper kiosks, destroying telephones and fighting with police, television pictures showed. Metro stations and buses were also vandalised as thousands of Sao Paulo supporters converged on a principal thoroughfare which has become a favourite celebration point for soccer fans. 

 Sao Paulo beat fellow-Brazilians Atletico Paranaense 4-0 at the Morumbi Stadium in the second leg of the final to complete a 5-1 aggregate win and clinch South America?s top club tournament for the third time. 

 London: Thierry Henry will replace Patrick Vieira as Arsenal captain following his France teammate?s transfer to Juventus.

 Asked on Saturday if striker Henry would be given the captain?s armband for the new season also which starts next month, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told a television sports channel: ?Yes, that?s my intention.?

 Midfielder Vieira left Highbury for Juventus for 20 million euros ($24.18 million) on Friday after nine long years at the north London club.

 Suwon: Argentina?s Boca Juniors battled to a 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at the Peace Cup pre-season tournament on Saturday. 

 Newly-signed striker Daniel Bilos snatched a 72nd-minute equaliser for Boca after two first-half goals had put Spurs in control.

 Marcelo Delgado gave Boca an early lead before the English Premier League side struck back through Jermain Defoe in the 27th minute and Mido five minutes later. 

 Paris: Chelsea have signed French under-21 international Lassana Diarra from Ligue 2 side Le Havre for an estimated $ 5.44 million transfer fee, a sports daily reported on Saturday.

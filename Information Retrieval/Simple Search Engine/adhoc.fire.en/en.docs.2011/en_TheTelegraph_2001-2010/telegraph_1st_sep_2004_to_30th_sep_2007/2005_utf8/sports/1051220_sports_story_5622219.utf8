 Pak will be on a high, says Chappell

London: Indian coach Greg Chappell feels Pakistan would be high on confidence when they take on India next month, following their victory over England in the home series. 

I would have preferred had England done a bit better, softened Pakistan up for us and not got the wake-up call that they got, Chappell told a television channel on Monday. 

Chappell said that even England will learn from their mistakes and prepare better before taking on the Indians in March. England will be better prepared when they come to India than they were for Pakistan, he said. 

The former Australia captain put Englands 0-2 Test series defeat down to the batting collapse that saw them losing the opening match. I wouldnt read too much into it. I still think theyre a good side.

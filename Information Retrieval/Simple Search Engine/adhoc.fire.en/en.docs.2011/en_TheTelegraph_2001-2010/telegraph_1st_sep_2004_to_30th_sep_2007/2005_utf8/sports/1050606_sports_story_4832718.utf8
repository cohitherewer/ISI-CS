Calcutta: After smashing two national records and bagging the Best Athlete award in the just-concluded second Reva National Youth Athletics championship in Bangalore recently, Bengals Jhuma Khatun now sets her eyes on the World Youth championships to be held in Morocco from July 13 to 17. 

Now I am looking forward to the trials, currently underway in Delhi. If I am selected, I will give my best to win a medal at the world meet, Jhuma told The Telegraph, on her arrival in the city on Sunday. 

Jhuma, hailing from Nadias Kaligunj town, was in love with the tracks from the very beginning. I got inspired by Jyoti dis (Jyotirmoyee Sikdar) feat and have been idolising her since childhood, she stated. 

Jhuma coached by Kalyan Chowdhury clocked 4:38.42 in the 1500m on the penultimate day and followed it up the next day, shattering the national record in the 800m at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium last Sunday. With a time of 2:11.30, she obliterated Punjabs Iqbal Kaurs 2:13.41 mark set three years back. 

As of now, the 800m and 1500m remain her favourite events and aspires to be one of the best middle distance runners of the country in a couple of years time. 

I dont know what it takes to win a medal at Asian Games or Olympics, but I always dream of winning medals in those events, the class XI girl of Lakhoria High School in Kaligunj admitted frankly. 

Jyotirmoyee apart, she also likes the styles of Sunita Rani and Soma Biswas.

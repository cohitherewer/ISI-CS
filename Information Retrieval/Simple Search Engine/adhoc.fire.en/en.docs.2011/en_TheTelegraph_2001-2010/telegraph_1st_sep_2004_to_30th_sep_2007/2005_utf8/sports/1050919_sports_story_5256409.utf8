The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania remains untouchable 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza is making her presence felt at the Netaji Indoor Stadium both when she is physically there and even when she isnt. 

The venue for the first WTA Sunfeast Open has been turned into a veritable fortress. The security blanket even affected mediapersons who were watching the qualifying match between Isha Lakhani and Ankita Bhambri on Sunday. 

Sania wanted to see part of the match. So the media was at first requested to move to the left of the gallery. 

A few objections and a compromise later, they were asked to leave the first five rows free, so that Sania and her entourage could sit. Of course, the media was also requested not to try and talk to her. 

Nothing new. Ever since she arrived in the city on Friday night, entreaty after entreaty has been made to stay away from her. 

Closed practice sessions have been held and the media only invited in press conferences under the watchful eyes of security personnel.

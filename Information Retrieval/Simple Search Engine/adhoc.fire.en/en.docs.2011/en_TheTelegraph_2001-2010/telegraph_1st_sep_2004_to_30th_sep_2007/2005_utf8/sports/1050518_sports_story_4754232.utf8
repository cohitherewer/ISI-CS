The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My aim as a coach is to simplify tennis

 - Theres a very fine line between genius and insanity, says Pat Cash

Calcutta: As per Tuesdays official programme, Pat Cash was to conduct a session with advanced trainees from 6.30 to 9 am, followed by an interaction with local coaches from 10 to 11 on Day II of BTAs special clinic at its Salt Lake complex. 

But the energetic Aussie would have none of it. Forget the scheduled one-hour break, he had to be literally pulled out of the court at 11.30 am and taken to his hotel. 

Having enjoyed working with the very enthusiastic kids and eager coaches non-stop for five hours, Cash longed for some mangoes. His wish was gladly granted, with mishti doi being added to the menu. 

Adequately refreshed, it was time to face the media. Betraying not a hint of exhaustion and looking a good 10 years younger than 40, Cash was as much at ease answering a range of questions as he was on court caressing those forehand volleys. 

My aim as a coach is to simplify tennis, the old-fashioned techniques are more difficult. Im trying to pass on those skills and most of the kids are catching on. They are so enthusiastic, Cash said of his experience at the BTA Academy. 

These kids have been taught the wrong way? its not the fault of the coaches here, just that theres been a lack of international exposure. Thats why Im here. I would like to see this state emerge as No. 1 in Indian tennis, Cash wished. 

For a man who travelled with Mark Philippoussis for over two years and Greg Rusedski for a few months, Cash knows a thing or two about coaching. In fact, coaching is the top priority on his agenda right now. So much so that music ? he had a band called Wild Colonial Boys ? has taken a backseat. He has restarted his academy in Hope Island (Queensland) which had to be closed down for a year. 

Good or great players dont necessarily make good coaches, Cash admitted. Its not an easy job at all. Its especially very difficult to deal with top sportspersons. Even Bjorn Borg was not easy to handle, however cool he looked on court. 

His experience with Philippoussis was another case in point. I enjoyed it but the relationship wasnt an ideal one. It got to the stage when he wouldnt listen to me. He was next only to the great Pete Sampras in talent, but just didnt have the right attitude and mental make-up. Theres a very fine line between genius and insanity, was how Cash analysed The Scud. 

Theres not much difference between a good and a great player, according to Cash. Its just that on the big day, you have to play better than your opponent. I played two great Australian Open finals but as it turned out, Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg played just a bit better and won. The same could have happened in the (1987) Wimbledon final (versus Ivan Lendl). Thankfully, it went my way. 

That July day, 18 summers ago, changed Cashs life. Of course, life changed after winning Wimbledon. For one, I wouldnt have been sitting here and talking to you otherwise. 

In a career often disrupted by injuries, Cash rubbed shoulders with some of the all-time greats. John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Edberg, Lendl, Boris Becker, Wilander. All of them were great players in their own right. McEnroe was the most talented Ive seen while Sampras was the best of the modern era, he was virtually perfect, Cash observed. 

The exchanges could have gone on and on. It was time again for the organisers to remind Cash that he needed to take some rest before getting back on the courts for the afternoon and evening sessions. 

Well, Cash is turning out to be a big hit, both on and off court. The Rs 4.5 lakh the BTA is spending on him may well be worth every paisa.

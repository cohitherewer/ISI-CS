Thiruvananthapuram: Australian bio-mechanics expert Bruce Elliott has been appointed as one of the members on the panel to work with off-spinner Harbhajan Singh to examine and correct his action. 

Former bowlers Ravi Shastri, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan and Jawagal Srinath were also expected to be on the experts? panel as the cricket board was awaiting their acceptance of the assignment, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said Sunday. 

Elliot from the School of Human Movement and Exercise from the University of Weeter, Australia, has accepted the assignment, Nair confirmed. Harbhajan was reported for suspect action for the second time in his career during the second Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong. 

ICC had given Harbhajan time till February 18 for working on his action with an experts? panel. (PTI)

London: Injury-time goals for Arsenal and Ajax Amsterdam provided a dramatic start to group B of the Champions League on Wednesday as the Londoners beat Swiss outsiders Thun 2-1 and Ajax grabbed a 1-1 draw at Sparta Prague. 

Benfica also struck in stoppage time to beat Lille 1-0 in Lisbon and take the early lead in group D after Manchester United drew 0-0 against debutants Villarreal. 

Udinese, also in the competition for the first time, got off to a flying start as they thumped Panathinaikos 3-0 with a hattrick by Italy international Vincenzo Iaquinta. 

Juventus won 2-1 at Club Bruges to make it a clean sweep of victories for the four Italian clubs after AC Milan and Inter Milan won on Tuesday. 

Udinese are joined on three points in group C by Barcelona, 2-0 winners at Werder Bremen, while Bayern Munich won 1-0 at Rapid Vienna to share the early lead in Group A with Juventus. 

Thun were playing in the amateur Swiss third division nine years ago but showed they had come a long way by beating Dynamo Kiev and Malmo in the Champions League qualifying rounds. 

The trip to Arsenal demanded a further step up and they responded to the challenge to reach half-time goalless, with the London side reduced to 10 men just before the break when striker Robin van Persie was shown the red card for dangerous play. 

Arsenals Brazilian midfielder Gilberto Silva headed the opening goal after 51 minutes but Highbury was stunned when Nelson Ferreira looped in an incredible equaliser two minutes later. 

Arsenal struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute Dennis Bergkamp slotted home the winner with his first Champions League goal for three years. 

Sparta also looked on course for something of an upset after Miroslav Matusovic slammed in a superb volley after 66 minutes. However, Ajax grabbed a point with another shot from outside the box by Wesley Sneijder. 

Benfica left it late to give their fans something to cheer at last as striker Fabrizio Miccoli headed past the previously dominant Lille keeper Tony Sylva. 

Villarreal almost matched them as Marcos Senna hit the bar in the last minute against a Manchester United side who had England striker Wayne Rooney sent off midway through the second half for ironically clapping the referee, who had just booked him for a foul. 

Juventus also saw red as Patrick Vieira was dismissed in the 89th minute in Bruges ? but only after Pavel Nedved and David Trezeguet had secured their victory. 

Bayern Munich were somewhat flattered by their 1-0 win in Vienna. 

Barcelona were also lucky to come away from Germany with three points after Werder Bremen missed a host of chances. The Spanish champions went ahead with a scruffy Deco goal after 13 minutes and somehow won it with a second-half Ronaldinho penalty.

 Sourav singles out Pathan for praise 

Bulawayo: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly Friday singled out Irfan Pathan for special praise, saying the left-arm pacers spell with the new ball was a key factor in the teams huge victory over Zimbabwe in the first Test. 

We bowled well in the second innings. It is a good sign that Irfan got a few wickets with the new ball when they were playing our spinners well, Sourav said after India won the first Test by an innings and 90 runs here. 

For Sourav, the emphatic victory and his century, came at the right time. The pressure was always going to be there as I have not played well for the last 6-7 months, plus expectations were there from me, he said, admitting that he played under pressure in his record 48th match as Indian captain. 

It felt good to be back among runs. I will be more confident in Harare, Sourav said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Double-shift training for Real Madrid stars 

 - Spanish League 

- Atletico turn the heat on city rivals 

 Beckham arrived 45 minutes late for training session 

Madrid: Vanderlei Luxemburgo has begun his new job as Real Madrid coach by introducing training sessions twice daily for the players following the short winter break. 

Players will train in the morning, have lunch together and then remain at the club?s base in Las Rozas on the outskirts of Madrid until they take part in an afternoon session. 

Former coach Jose Antonio Camacho, who quit after three league games at the start of the season, had asked for a similar regime to be introduced, but his request was turned down by the club. 

Midfielder David Beckham arrived 45 minutes late for the team?s first session on Sunday owing to problems with the private jet that was due to take him back to Madrid after seeing in the New Year in England. 

Real return to action on Wednesday when they play the remaining seven minutes of their league match against Real Sociedad after the fixture was abandoned shortly before the final whistle because of a bomb scare at the Bernabeu with the score at 1-1. 

They then face city rivals Atletico Madrid at the Calderon on Sunday. 

Atletico?s Uruguayan midfielder Marcelo Sosa began the build-up to the local derby with some controversial comments about Beckham. 

?There are 10,000 players better than him,? Sosa told sports daily Marca on Sunday. ?All that happens is that he appears in the press and fashion magazines. He is only at Real because of marketing, but as a player he doesn?t worry me at all.? 

Real Madrid fullback Michel Salgado was dismissive of Sosa?s opinions. 

?The best thing to do is to ignore him,? he said. ?He hasn?t been here long enough to show such a lack of respect for other players. I don?t understand what he?s trying to say.?

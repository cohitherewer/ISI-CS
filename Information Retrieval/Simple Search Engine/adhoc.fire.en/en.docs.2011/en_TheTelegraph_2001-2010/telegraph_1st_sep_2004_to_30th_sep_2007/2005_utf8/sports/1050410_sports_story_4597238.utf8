 Mad rush for tickets

Ahmedabad: A mad scramble for tickets for the fourth one-day International between India and Pakistan was witnessed on Saturday in the city, forcing police to use mild force. 

GCA had opened two centres for selling the tickets, one at Navrangpura Cricket Stadium and the other at Motera Stadium, the venue for the match. Police personnel at both the venues had to intervene as some fans broke the queue and created commotion. 

Mild force was also used to control the crowd who had literally made a bee-line in the scorching heat. 

By afternoon, tickets priced at Rs 100, 150 and 1000 were already sold out, GCA sources said.

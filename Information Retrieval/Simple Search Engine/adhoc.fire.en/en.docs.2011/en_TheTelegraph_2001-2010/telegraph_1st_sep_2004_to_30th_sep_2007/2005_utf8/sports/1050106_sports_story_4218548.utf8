 Australia hungry for a fight

 An exciting time is coming up for us, says Ponting 

Sydney: Australia?s cricketers are spoiling for a fight and desperately hoping England will be the team to give it to them. 

Ricky Ponting?s team hardly broke a sweat this summer as they brushed aside New Zealand and Pakistan to win their five home Tests. And although the Ashes is still six months away, they?re already thinking about the old enemy. 

?We?ve got a one-day series and a Test series in New Zealand to worry about first, but there?s no doubt it?s going to be the biggest Ashes series for a while,? Ponting said on Wednesday, after his side beat Pakistan by nine wickets. 

?Certainly our guys are talking about it being that way so it?s an exciting time coming up for us.? 

Australia have won the last eight Ashes series, but there are signs this year?s five-match series could be a lot closer after England won eight successive Tests and were unbeaten in 2004. 

?As professional cricketers we?re always keeping a close eye on what?s happening around the world,? Ponting said. ?England have obviously played some great cricket lately and have won a lot of Tests, so they are a great side and we?re looking forward to playing them.? 

Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne said the tour will be the toughest Ashes series he has been involved in. 

?Every time we go over there they think they have their best (team) in a while,? Warne said. ?They?ve been saying that for the last few series... but I think this time they have a real chance. 

?It will probably be my last one, I don?t think I?ll be playing again in an Ashes series in England so I have to make sure I keep myself fit and hopefully bowl well enough to be selected on that tour and upset the Poms. 

?I wouldn?t like to lose a series against England in my time.? 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer agreed England had improved, but after seeing his side thumped 0-3 by Australia, he doubted they could regain the Ashes and identified Adam Gilchrist as the biggest obstacle. ?They?ll have to play very well to beat Australia, assuming the Australian side stays constant. England will find it very tough to beat them,? Woolmer said. 

?With Gilchrist coming in at number seven, it?s just an awesome fact. He?s the closest thing I?ve seen to Gary Sobers for a long time. He?s a wonderful player and a genius as a batsman.? (Reuters)

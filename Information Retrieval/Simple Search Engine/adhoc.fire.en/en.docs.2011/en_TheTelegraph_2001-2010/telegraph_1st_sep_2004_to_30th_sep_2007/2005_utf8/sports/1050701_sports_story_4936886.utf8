Sao Paulo: Ronaldo has said that hell have to fight hard to maintain his place on the Brazilian national team after returning from vacation. 

(coach Carlos Alberto) Parreira has said that my place is guaranteed, but I know thats not how things will work, the Real Madrid striker told a local daily Wednesday. If I get back to the team and dont start scoring goals, he wont keep calling me. 

Ronaldo made the comments before Brazils 4-1 routing of Argentina to win the Confederations Cup in Germany. Ronaldos replacement has been Santos striker Robinho, who played alongside Adriano up front to help lead the Brazilians to the title. 

Ronaldo was released from the Confederations Cup roster after saying he needed a rest following the Spanish League season. Although Parreira said at the time that no one was irreplaceable and that fatigue was no excuse for missing the tournament, he later confirmed that Ronaldo would return to the roster. 

When I asked for my vacation, I did what I thought was the right thing to do. I have to thank Parreira for understanding my reasons, Ronaldo said. But I know that I will have to prepare myself the best I can for next year. 

Ronaldo also praised Robinho, who is one of his challengers in Brazils starting line-up and is reportedly close to a transfer to Real Madrid. 

Im hoping he signs with Real, Ronaldo said. Robinho is worth any kind of investment, he is a great player.

 Seasons first pole for Schumi

Budapest: World champion Michael Schumacher put Ferrari back on top with a stunning first pole position of the year in Hungary Saturday. 

With his title hopes in tatters after a season of struggle, the 36-year-old fired off a devastatingly quick qualifying lap of one minute 19.882 seconds to pip McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya by 0.897. 

Renaults runaway championship leader Fernando Alonso ran slightly wide at the last corner, kicking up dust, to qualify a disappointing sixth. The Spaniards title rival, Kimi Raikkonen, was fourth in his McLaren. 

Jordans Narain Karthikeyan finished 18th in a time of 1:25.057, ahead of Robert Doornbos (1.25.484) in a Minardi. 

The considerable margin, at the second slowest circuit on the calendar, added up to the 64th pole position of Schumachers phenomenal career. 

Schumacher is now one short of equalling the record set by Brazilian Ayrton Senna the day before his death at Imola in 1994. 

Even if rivals suspected the Germans Ferrari was light on fuel for a race sponsored by title-backer Marlboro, Schumacher was delighted to find himself in such a strong position at a circuit where overtaking is difficult. 

It was a good lap, he said. We obviously feel very delighted after a suffering period where not very much seemed to work in our favour. All weekend we have been very competitive and this is the result. 

Italian Jarno Trulli, in a Toyota, was third fastest to share the second row with Raikkonen. The Finn, who led last weeks German Grand Prix before retiring with an hydraulics problem, finished ahead of Toyotas fifth-placed Ralf Schumacher Saturday. 

 Alonso leads closest rival Raikkonen 

 by 36 points with six races remaining after Hungary. Schumacher 

 is 40 points adrift of the Spaniard.

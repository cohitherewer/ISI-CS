 Bhutia worry for EB

 Bhutia is a doubtful starter vs Mahindra 

Mumbai: It will be crunch time for champions East Bengal when they take on Mahindra United in the National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup at the Cooperage on Wednesday. 

The heavyweights from Calcutta have to win to keep alive dreams of completing a hattrick of NFL titles. 

East Bengal currently occupy the third spot (40 points from 19 games). Sporting Clube de Goa, who face the almost-relegated State Bank of Travancore in Kozhikode on Wednesday, are in pole position (42 points from 20 matches) while Dempo are second (41 from 19). 

East Bengal have a few worries going into the Mahindra clash. Bhaichung Bhutia is indisposed while Ernest Jeremiah is ruled out with a double booking. 

?Bhutia is slightly unwell. He is not certain to play tomorrow,? coach Subhas Bhowmick said after practice on Tuesday. 

?This is a crucial match for us and we have to try and win it. Mahindra are one of the top teams in the country and we can?t take them lightly,? Bhowmick said. The coach will be praying that Bhutia, the side?s top scorer in the NFL with nine goals, is available to complement the left-footed wizardry of Alvito D?Cunha. 

Mahindra haven?t done justice to their potential and are out of the title race, having tallied 29 points from 20 ties to be in fourth place. Syed Nayeemuddin?s men can at best spoil East Bengal?s aspirations. 

While East Bengal are involved in a championship battle at the Cooperage, Churchill Brothers will be out to pull themselves out of relegation zone when they take on JCT at the Nehru Stadium in Margao. 

SBT (15 points), Vasco (17) and Tollygunge Agragami (17) are looking down the barrel as far as relegation is concerned. The fourth team to be demoted should be either Churchill (21) or Mohun Bagan (19). 

Churchill desperately need three points against JCT as they will face Mohun Bagan in their last match in Calcutta. The Goan outfit will depend on Marcos Pereira and Yusif Yakubu, who has been very inconsistent in this edition of the NFL. 

Churchill coach Insuah Jenny has full faith in his team. ?My boys know the exact situation and are well prepared for the challenge? we?ll go all out for a win,? he said. 

JCT have not much at stake except to improve their position. Sukhwinder Singh?s team is currently at No. 6 with with 26 points from 20 matches. 

Sporting Clube de Goa, fresh from their 5-2 victory over Vasco, will try to consolidate their position with a win against the lowly SBT and hope East Bengal slip in Mumbai. (PTI)

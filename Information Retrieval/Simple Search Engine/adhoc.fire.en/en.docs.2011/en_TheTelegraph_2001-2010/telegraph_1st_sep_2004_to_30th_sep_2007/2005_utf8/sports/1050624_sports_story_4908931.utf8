 Good day for Indians 

London: The Indian cricketers playing for English county sides had a fruitful day with all of them, except for Sourav Ganguly, essaying key roles in their respective teams win in the Twenty20 Cup tournament. 

Dinesh Mongia claimed a wicket giving away just 19 runs from four overs before blasting a 28-ball 39 to guide Leicestershire to a five wicket win over Nottinghamshire at Grace Road (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

Nottinghamshire, electing to bat, made 143 for eight, a target overhauled by the defending champions with four balls and five wickets to spare. 

At the Rose Bowl, Irfan Pathan wrecked Hampshires middle-order with three for 16 off four overs as Middlesex, making 210 for six batting first, restricted their opponents to 192 for seven to win the match by 18 runs. 

Harbhajan Singh remained wicketless in Surreys match against Kent at Beckenham but the off-spinners miserly spell of 4-0-22-0 troubled the batsmen as they managed just 140 for 8 in 20 overs. Surrey reached the target in just 16 overs losing three wickets with the Indian not required to bat at all. 

Souravs Glamorgan recorded a win against Somerset at Sophia Gardens in dramatic fashion with the Indian skipper making 10 with the bat as an opener after giving away 30 runs for his one wicket from three overs. Somerset made 183 all out in 18.4 overs and though Glamorgan also made 183 for eight, they were declared winners for losing less number of wickets. (PTI)

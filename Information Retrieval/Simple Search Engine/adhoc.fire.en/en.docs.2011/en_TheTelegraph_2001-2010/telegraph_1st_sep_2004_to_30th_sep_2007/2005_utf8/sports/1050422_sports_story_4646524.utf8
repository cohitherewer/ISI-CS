London: Runaway Premier League leaders Chelsea were held 0-0 at home by champions Arsenal and Manchester United finished with nine men in a 1-0 defeat at Everton on Wednesday. 

Chelsea, hoping for a win to set up a chance of clinching their first league title in 50 years against Fulham on Saturday, deserved only a point from a pulsating, finely-balanced game at Stamford Bridge. 

The draw hardly represented a major setback, though, for a convincing Chelsea side who moved on to 82 points, 11 ahead of Arsenal with five games to play. 

Chelsea will become champions if they beat Fulham in the west London derby and Arsenal, whose manager Arsene Wenger has already conceded the title, are unable to defeat Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby on Monday. 

Everton striker Duncan Ferguson headed the team?s winner in the 55th minute and they took charge after a 72nd-minute red card for United?s Gary Neville, who kicked the ball at a section of the Goodison Park crowd. 

United midfielder Paul Scholes was dismissed in stoppage time for a second booking as Alex Ferguson?s men stayed third on 67 points, four points adrift of Arsenal. 

Everton?s first league win over United for 10 years cemented their hold on fourth place and a slot in the Champions League qualifying round by moving on to 57 points. They stay three points and a game in hand ahead of Merseyside rivals Liverpool, who won 2-1 at Portsmouth. 

 Inter beat Juventus 

Inter Milan beat Juventus 1-0 at the Delle Alpi stadium on Wednesday, allowing defending champions AC Milan to return to joint top of Serie A with a 1-0 win at home to Chievo, add reports from Milan. 

Juventus and Milan both have 70 points with Inter third on 59 with six games remaining, including a potentially decisive clash between the leaders on May 8. 

Argentine Julio Ricardo Cruz headed home the winner for Inter in the 24th minute of a game in which Juventus twice struck the woodwork. 

Milan beat Chievo with a 65th-minute strike from Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf. 

Roma?s miserable season continued as Francesco Totti was sent off in the second half of their 0-2 defeat at home to lowly Siena.

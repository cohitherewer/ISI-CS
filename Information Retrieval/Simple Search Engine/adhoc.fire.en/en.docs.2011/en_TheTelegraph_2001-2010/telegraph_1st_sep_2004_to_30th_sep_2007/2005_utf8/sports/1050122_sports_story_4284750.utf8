The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ex-Chelsea boss buys out Leeds

London: Former Chelsea chairman Ken Bates has bought debt-ridden second division Leeds United for ? 10 million ($ 18.7 million), the club said Friday. 

Bates, one of the most outspoken and abrasive men in English soccer, ended a 22-year spell at Chelsea when he resigned as chairman in March, having sold his controlling interest in the club to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in 2003. 

?I recognise that Leeds United is a great club that has fallen on hard times,? Bates said in a statement.

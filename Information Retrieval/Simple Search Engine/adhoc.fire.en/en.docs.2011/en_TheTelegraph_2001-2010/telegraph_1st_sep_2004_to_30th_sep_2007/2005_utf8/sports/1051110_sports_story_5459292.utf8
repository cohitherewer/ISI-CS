Gamanda Ram of Services created a meet record, clocking 1:46.67 seconds in the 800m, bettering the earlier 1990 record held by Avatar Singh who sprinted the distance in 1:47.45. 

Josimon Mathew of Services and R. Bagiradh of Arunachal Pradesh settled for minor placings in the race. 

One more meet record was created by V. V. Geeshkumar of Police, who leaped to 5.05m, thereby erasing the previous best of 5.00m scaled by Ma Eldo in 1990. 

The day was dominated by Railways who claimed the majority of the medals on offer.

 McGrath on top, Warne second 

Dubai: Australia bowling greats Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne have moved to the top two slots in the latest ICC Test player rankings which also saw Englishman Andrew Flintoff take over the mantle of the top allrounder in the world. 

The Aussie legends moved up a slot from their previous rankings with McGrath taking over top position. 

Warne now on 874 points, his highest ranking since December 1995 when he stood at 876, is placed second. 

The rankings have been updated after the Super Series Test between Australia and World XI which finished in four days with a 210-run victory for Ricky Pontings men. 

McGrath and Warne, with more than 1150 Test wickets between them, leapfrogged Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, who slipped to third spot. 

Fourth in the bowling list was Andrew Flintoff whose seven wickets lifted him to his highest-ever points total. 

This also put him ahead of Jacques Kallis in the allrounders stakes, the rankings being calculated by multiplying batting and bowling points. 

Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting moved up three places to joint second in the batting list along with Brian Lara. Kallis remains No.1 batsman. 

Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag, who were part of the World XI, occupied the fourth and fifth spots. 

Matthew Hayden re-entered the top ten at sixth place, up 10 places after his Man of the Match performance in Sydney. 

Adam Gilchrists first innings of 94 helped him move back up to No. 11 following a gain of three spots. 

The biggest mover in the bowling rankings was leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, who took nine wickets in the super Test and jumped 10 places to No. 20.

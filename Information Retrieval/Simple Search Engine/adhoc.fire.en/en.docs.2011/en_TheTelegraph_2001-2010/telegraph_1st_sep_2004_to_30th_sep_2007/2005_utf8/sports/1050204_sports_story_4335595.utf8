 PCB wants Malik cleared on medical grounds

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to clear the bowling action of Shoaib Malik on medical grounds. 

?We have sent the biomechanic reports on Malik?s action from the University of Western Australia human movement department in Perth to the ICC,? PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Thursday. 

?We have also submitted the report of our committee on illegal bowling actions as we want them to clear his action at least before the tour to India later this month,? he said. 

?The tests have shown that Malik, who was involved in a road accident two years back, has lost control of tendon in his bowling arm which is causing the problem,? Shaharyar said. 

?We have asked the ICC to permit him to bowl again on medical grounds.? 

Malik, 23, bowls off-spin and was reported for suspect action last year in October during a tri-series final in Lahore, the second time since 2000 his action had been reported to the ICC by match officials. Since than he has undergone two test sessions at the Perth institute under the supervision of biomechanics specialist professor Bruce Elliot and bowling coach Daryl Foster. 

After finding that while bowling he bent his elbow well above the current limit allowed by the ICC, they advised the Pakistan board not to allow him to bowl at the international level until he underwent remedial action. 

 Arshad, Shahid in frame 

Veteran off-spinner Arshad Khan and pacer Shahid Nazir are leading contenders for berths in the India-bound squad as the Pakistan team grapples with a spate of injuries to key players, adds a report from Islamabad. Fitness worries are dogging Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed and Umer Gul.

 Motivator won like a true champion 

 Epsom: Motivator landed a blow for racings second tier with an Epsom Derby victory in the style of a true champion on Saturday.

 The Montjeu colt, trained in Englands racing headquarters Newmarket by Michael Bell, put the well-fancied runners of superpower stables Aidan Brien and Godolphin in the shade with a breathtaking burst of speed to win by an easy five lengths.

 quot;It proves you dont have to be a big battalion to produce the goods if you have the right ammunition, quot; said 44-year-old Bell of the 3-1 favourite after landing his biggest success of a training career spanning 17 years.

 quot;It is a privilege to have a horse like this, we are so bloody lucky. We are a relatively small yard, we dont have 100 horses and it was up to us not to make a balls of it.

 quot;I was pretty convinced he would win from four or five furlongs out. Seeing horse win like (ill-fated 1981 Derby winner) Shergar you always hope they will produce something like that and when they do it its just unbelievable. quot;

 Bell has had no end of worry with doubts over Motivators stamina and a suspect temperament giving him many a sleepless night, despite the colt taking an unbeaten record into the race.

 In the event, Motivator behaved impeccably, handling the razzmataz and the race preliminaries with no hint of a problem and cantered to the start as if 120,000 racegoers were invisible.

 quot;Hes no more excitable than a lot of horses. He is not a nutcase, quot; added Bell.

 quot;A bit more has been made of his temperament than maybe should have been. Hes just a little bit effervescent, but very easy to train. He only did one serious bit of work after winning the Dante Stakes (at York last month).

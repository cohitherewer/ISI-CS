The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Zaheer is pleased

Arshad Khan (top) and Younis Khan

Islamabad: Former skipper Zaheer Abbas Saturday gave PCB the thumbs-up for selecting the best available team for the forthcoming Test series vs India. 

?It is a good team. Cannot be better than that,? he told a local television channel here while reacting to the announcement of 16-member squad. 

?Arshad Khan made a comeback. He may do well in India as the wickets there are spinner-friendly. But a lot depends on how well he bowls,? Zaheer said. 

Asked whether the removal of Yousuf Youhana as vice-captain and the appointment of Younis Khan in his place was to groom a future captain, Zaheer said before becoming captain Younis first needs to cement his place in the team. 

?He has not cemented his place yet in the team. Captain is the one who has permanent place in the team,? he said. 

Meanwhile, in Karachi former Test off-spinner and ex-chairman of Pakistani selectors Salahuddin Ahmed said here Saturday that ?Pakistan?s only strength was its fast bowling which has now been neutralised with the withdrawal of Shoaib.? 

Salahuddin, who has served as a national selector for a record nine times, said the balance of the series was now heavily in favour of India. 

?Mohammed Sami is an over-rated fast bowler while Rana Naved-ul-Hasan is an improved pacer. But neither is in the same class as Irfan Pathan or Zaheer Khan,? he said. 

Salahuddin was of the view that Pathan would prove to be a dangerous bowler during the series. ?He becomes extremely difficult when he bowls round the wicket because the batsmen struggle to pick his line.? 

Like Wasim Akram, he has learnt the art of bringing the ball inside from round the wicket rather than swinging the ball away like other left-armers.? 

Salahuddin said besides Irfan, India had Zaheer, Ashish Nehra, Ajit Agarkar and Laxmipathy Balaji ?which give India a more formidable look compared to Pakistan. There was never any doubt about the spinners in Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik.?

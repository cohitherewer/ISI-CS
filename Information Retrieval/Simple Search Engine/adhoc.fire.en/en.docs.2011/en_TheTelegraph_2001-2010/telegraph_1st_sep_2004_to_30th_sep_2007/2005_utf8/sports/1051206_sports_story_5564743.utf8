 Greg: No compromise on discipline

Chennai: India coach Greg Chappell says he wants to build on a new-found flexibility in the one-day batting order rather than pin the teams hopes on individuals. 

If we are relying on one or two players for our success then we are a limited team and any success we have will be fleeting, Chappell said. 

India often surprised the opposition by promoting Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Dhoni to No. 3 to great effect despite criticism of too much experimentation. 

What we have tried to achieve is to get as much flexibility in the squad as possible, Chappell said. 

It was a calculated strategy to try and challenge the guys to go further with their cricket. 

Much of what you do in cricket and in life is a calculated gamble. The gamble is less if you know what you are doing, he said. 

Chappell said there can be no compromise on discipline. 

Anyone who displays the attitudes and the other requirements to fit into the vision that is required for success, continuing success, for Indian cricket, Im happy to work with. 

But if they should display that they are not prepared to fit into that environment, then there is no place for them. 

New captain Dravid was quickly settling down, the 57-year-old said. His strength of character has shown through. He will continue to get better as a leader and as a captain.

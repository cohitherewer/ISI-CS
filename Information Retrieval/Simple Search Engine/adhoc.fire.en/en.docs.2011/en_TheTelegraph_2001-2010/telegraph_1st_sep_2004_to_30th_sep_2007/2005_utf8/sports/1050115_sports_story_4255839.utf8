The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Leander keeps fingers crossed

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The news from Sydney is a mixture of good and bad. Leander Paes hasn?t broken a bone, but there are enough doubts whether he will be fit to play in the Australian Open beginning in Melbourne next week. 

Paes fell down and twisted his ankle chasing a return during the Sydney meet quarter final. The Indian and his Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic were playing Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge. 

The MRI scan revealed that the Indian ace had substantial soft tissue damage on his left ankle. ?They have put me on a light cast? I am on crutches, can?t walk,? Paes told The Telegraph from Sydney Friday evening shortly before flying to Melbourne. 

Paes will be doing physiotherapy with Dr Andrea Bisaz with whom he has worked since 1991. ?I?m keeping fingers crossed. We?ll work for five days and see how much it has healed. Right now, I?m taking it one day at a time,? said Paes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Wright may not seek extension of contract

 John Wright 

Hyderabad: John Wright Wednesday indicated that he may not go for an extension of his contract as coach of the Indian team, saying the cricket board is likely to look for someone who will coach the side till the 2007 World Cup. 

?But I am not in a position to do it,? said Wright giving enough hints that he was not in favour of an extension of the contract which was coming to an end in may. 

[The Telegraph had reported on November 20, 2004, during the last series? Kanpur Test itself that there is a good chance that Wright will not be with Team India for long. He had said then that he could quit after the SA series itself.] 

?We will concentrate on the ensuing series (against Pakistan) and other things will fall in place,? he said on the sidelines of the Duleep Trophy match between West Zone and South Zone being played here. 

Wright said he was expecting the series against Pakistan to be more serious and tough than the Revival Series played between the arch rivals last year. 

?It?s always good to get a back-to-back wins against Pakistan and that should be at the back of our minds while the series is on,? Wright said.

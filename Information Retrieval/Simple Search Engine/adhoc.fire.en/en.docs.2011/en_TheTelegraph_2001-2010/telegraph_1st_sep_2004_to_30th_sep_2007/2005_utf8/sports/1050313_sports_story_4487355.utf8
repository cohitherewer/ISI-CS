 Janzen takes 2nd-round lead

Toronto: Twice US Open champion Lee Janzen shot an eight-under 64 to grab the second round lead at the $5.5 million Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, on Friday. 

Janzen, US Open champion in 1993 and 1998 but without a win in almost seven years, began the day five shots behind overnight leader Chad Campbell before rocketing up the leaderboard to lie at 11-under through 36 holes. 

Playing the back nine first at the Country Club at Mirasol Palm Beach Gardens, Janzen got his round off to a modest start going one-under. 

He then carded five birdies and an eagle on the par-five fifth to sit four shots clear of other early finishers compatriot Patrick Sheehan and 2001 Honda champion Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, who fired a two-under 70. 

Campbell, who opened his round with a birdie on the first, was two adrift at nine-under. (Reuters)

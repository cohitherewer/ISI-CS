 Woolmer blasts batsmen for spineless display 

 - Dressing-room incident may have affected team psychologically, says Pak coach

Bridgetown: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has blasted his batsmen after the West Indies sealed a convincing 276-run victory with more than a day to spare, calling the teams first innings performance spineless. 

Woolmer said the catalyst for the defeat was Pakistan being bowled out for 144 in their first innings. 

I thought we were spineless on that particular day with our batting, he said. Its something well address in the next few days. 

Pakistan, overnight 113 for four in their second innings, were out for 296 just after lunch on Day IV despite 122 from Shahid Afridi. The two-Test series resumes with the final Test scheduled to start in Jamaica on Friday. 

Its not like the guys are out of form. They have been playing well, added Woolmer. Its just that they got themselves out very stupidly. There seemed (to be) no spirit, no fight at the crease which is surprising really. 

Woolmer acknowledged a dressing room incident involving two players, saying it may have deflated the team to an extent. The Pakistan media has reported that Afridi and captain Younis Khan argued heatedly on the Tests first day, apparently because Afridi was upset about his placement in the batting order. 

It was all over the Pakistan press, who made a mountain out of a molehill, Woolmer said. That might have affected them psychologically, but there is no excuse really to go out there and play the way they played. 

Both Woolmer and West Indies coach Bennett King acknowledged that the loss of Pakistans two leading batsmen, Inzamam-ul Haq and Yousuf Youhana, weakened the visitors. 

Inzamam was serving a one-match International Cricket Council ban while Youhana flew home to Pakistan Thursday to be with his ill father. 

It was a bonus for us to have two world-class players not in their side and were under no illusions that they could be back for the next Test, King said. 

The victory was the first for King in his fifth Test in charge of the West Indies, who had also lost eight one-day matches in a row before this match. 

Its quite relieving I guess, the 40-year-old Australian said. The boys have really worked hard and deserve to win today. 

King credited his bowlers, who he said have worked hard behind the scenes to get the reward. 

I dont think were there yet and my smiles doesnt mask the hard work that we still have to put in, King added. 

Younis Khan has promised a strong fightback in the second Test in Jamaica. Younis said Pakistan had the capability to come back and square the two-match series. 

It is disappointing to lose in this manner. But we lost the match when we were bowled out for a low score in the first innings. Our poor batting was the key to our defeat, Younis said. 

But you cant expect to win all the time and this was a bad match for us. They outclassed us from Day One. But we will come back strongly in the second Test, he promised. 

Younis praised the century by Brian Lara on the first day saying it put his team on the back foot. 

Man-of-the-match Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who enjoyed his first Test win as captain after a horrible home season, hoped his team would carry their confidence into the second Test. 

We have been lacking in confidence in recent matches. But this win will lift us up and we need to take this confidence forward, said the left hander who had scores of 92 and 153 not out in the Test. 

It was a complete team effort with the bowlers putting the ball in the right areas and the batting also clicking. 

We started well and stayed ahead until the end. 

West Indies will have to wait for the next two days to discover if pace bowlers Fidel Edwards and Dwayne Bravo can recover from hamstring and knee problems to be fit for the second Test.

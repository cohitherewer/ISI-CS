 6000-run milestone beckons Fleming

Bulawayo: Captain Stephen Fleming could become the first New Zealander to reach 6,000 Test runs during the second and final Test against Zimbabwe starting on Monday. 

Fleming goes into the match with 5,985 runs from his 95 Tests and will fancy his chances of reaching the milestone against suffering Zimbabwe. 

He said on Sunday: It would be good do it, but Im more orientated towards team statistics than individual achievements. 

New Zealand have named an unchanged side for a pitch that is perennially slow and low and favours slow and medium pace bowlers. 

Zimbabwe spent the three unused days of the first Test training hard and having a huge chat. 

We cant hide the fact that we didnt bat well, we all need to take a look in the mirror, said captain Tatenda Taibu. 

TEAMS 

Zimbabwe (from): Brendan Taylor, Neil Ferreira, Dion Ebrahim, Stuart Carlisle, Hamilton Masakadza, Craig Wishart, Tatenda Taibu (captain), Heath Streak, Blessing Mahwire, Graeme Cremer, Chris Mpofu, Andy Blignaut, Keith Dabengwa, Anthony Ireland. 

New Zealand: Lou Vincent, James Marshall, Hamish Marshall, Stephen Fleming, Nathan Astle, Scott Styris, Brendon McCullum, Daniel Vettori, James Franklin, Shane Bond, Chris Martin.

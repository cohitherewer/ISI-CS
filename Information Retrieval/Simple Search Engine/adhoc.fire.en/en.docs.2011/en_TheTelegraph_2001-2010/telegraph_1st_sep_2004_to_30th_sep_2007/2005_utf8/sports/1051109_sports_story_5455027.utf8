The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Selectors have to answer for unfit Singhs inclusion

 - Jai Prakash Yadav makes a quick comeback in Team India XV 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Rajkot: With keeping Sourav Ganguly out topping the senior national selectors agenda, they forgot a Board of Control for Cricket in India guideline ? that anybody coming off an injury has to prove his fitness in a domestic match ? when picking rookie Vikram Rajvir (not Raj Veer) Singh for the last two ODIs against Sri Lanka. 

The strapping Punjab speedster replaced allrounder Jai Prakash Yadav after the fifth ODI, in Motera, and arrived on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the day before the sixth ODI, Team India physio John Gloster put him through a test and recommended that he stay off cricket for a couple of weeks. 

Yadav, of course, has made the quickest comeback of all time: Now, he has been named Singhs replacement! 

Ironically, Singh (who idolises Waqar Younis) suffered an injury on his left leg in the very match that Sourav proved his fitness and form ? last months Duleep Trophy face-off here between East and North. 

That match, incidentally, was watched by two of the five selectors ? Yashpal Sharma and Gopal Sharma. Yashpal is Norths representative on the committee and should have monitored the 21-year-olds recovery. Chief selector Kiran More too. 

Singh wasnt considered for Norths next match, versus the Zimbabwe Presidents XI, as he was anyway down with viral fever. 

I didnt realise my recovery isnt complete... Its unfortunate that my first call-up has ended this way, but Im not shattered... Im looking beyond the next two ODIs... Looking at the future... Ive got to wait for a fortnight, Singh told The Telegraph at the Imperial Palace hotel. 

The Singh-development was conveyed to the Media by team spokesman Wng Cdr M. Baladitya. According to him, the selectors werent aware of the extent of Singhs injury when they deliberated in Motera. 

Among other things, that conveys a huge lack of communication and a lack of honesty on the part of many ? including the Punjab Cricket Association, Singhs home body. Surely, somebody must have known the extent of his injury. 

Explanations are bound to be offered, but the selectors have invited egg on their faces.

 London: Football legend Diego Maradona, in a slimmer version of himself after getting his stomach stapled, has caught the attention of a beautiful model.

 The 43-year-old Argentine superstar, who had to undergo the surgery to recover from health problems linked to his cocaine abuse, has caught the eye of gorgeous model Silvina Luna when they met on a TV show, according to a report. quot;He loved her curves and they have been dating ever since quot;, said a friend of the World Cup champion. quot;Now he is really smitten. quot; 

 Madrid: Real Madrid captain Raul is a doubt for the Champions League clash with Olympique Lyon after he had to come off with a knee injury on Saturday.

 Raul left the field midway through the second half of Real?s 0-3 Primera Liga defeat to arch-rivals Barcelona at the Bernabeu after twisting his knee while shooting. 

 London: Mansfield?s new goalkeeping coach Peter Wilson died after suffering a heart attack at Saturday?s fourth division match away to Shrewsbury.

 Wilson had spent 10 minutes overseeing Kevin Pressman?s warm-up ahead of the Gay Meadow match when he collapsed. The coach was rushed to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and his death was confirmed by doctors later on Saturday. 

 Pune: A 25-year-old industrial helper from Maharashtra, Uttam Shantaram Joshi, clinched the Hercules 45th Mumbai-Pune Cycle Race against a battery of top cyclists drawn from major parts of the country on Sunday.

 Shanghai: The organisers of men?s tennis will scrap the third set for doubles and replace it with a tie-break from next year to speed up play, the ATP said on Sunday.

 The new-look format will consist of a first-to-10 tie-break and there will also be no advantage played in the first two sets with games decided by the first point after deuce. ATP officials announced their decision at the Masters Cup in Shanghai despite fierce objection from doubles players. Several specialist doubles players filed a lawsuit against the ATP in September seeking an injunction to stop the ATP from implementing changes to scoring rules and qualifying methods. 

 Tokyo: Sydney Olympic champion Naoko Takahashi won the Tokyo Women?s Marathon in an unofficial time of 2:24.39 on Sunday, crowning her comeback from a two-year layoff with a warning to her rivals ahead of the 2008 Beijing Games.

 Fixing by individuals may still be on 

 Ehsan Mani 

Islamabad: Cricketers could still be fixing matches in their individual capacity, fears International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani while ruling out the possibility of teams being involved in it. 

I can say with confidence that now no match is fixed because weve taken strict measures to examine the entire performance of a team and in the given circumstances it is not possible to fix a match, Mani said during a press conference at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Monday. 

We have put in a lot of effort to eliminate match fixing and we have gained success in it but the existence of match fixing by individuals cannot be denied, he said. 

He said ICCs Anti Corruption Unit was working to find ways to control it. 

We cant do it overnight, definitely it will take some time, the way our efforts are in eliminating fixing an entire match, he was quoted as saying in a newspaper on Tuesday. 

Mani also said an ICC committee was reviewing whether leg before wicket and dismissals through catches should be decided by the third umpire as was done in Super Series in Australia earlier this year. 

Rules cannot be implemented at once, they need a thorough review and then a positive feedback and if the feedback is negative they can be dropped, Mani said. 

He said suspect bowling actions were also being reviewed by the ICC bowling committee and decisions were being taken on merit. 

But it is hard to mend the bowling action of senior players, we should make efforts at junior level when players are in the process of learning, he noted. 

He said the ICC was in the process to maintain a balance between one-day matches and Test cricket as a number of one-day games were being played around the globe which had increased the burden on the players. 

The ICC also pledged to crack down on verbal sparring during international matches, saying it did not want to see the game reduced to a hooligan sport. 

There are a growing number of incidents of verbal exchanges on the field and they are concerning for us, Mani said. We dont want cricket being reduced to a level where it turns into a hooligan sport.

 Warne tries to be larger than game, says Ranatunga

Colombo: Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga on Thursday slammed Shane Warne for suggesting that rivals like Muttiah Muralidharan benefited by taking cheap wickets. 

Shane tries to be larger than the game and life and expects a lot of credit for his performances. He thinks theres no better bowler than him, Ranatunga said. 

Warne said that his world record tallies of 651 career wickets and 87 in a calendar year would not last long. 

Without naming Sri Lankas off-spinner Muralidharan Warne said, theres a lot more cricket being played these days and you have teams like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh in there, with some teams playing them a lot more (than others). (AFP)

 MacGill also makes Ashes squad

Sydney: Australia have broken with tradition by choosing two leg-spinners in a 16-man squad for this year?s Ashes tour of England. 

In recent tours to England, the selectors opted for at least one finger spinner but both Stuart MacGill and Shane Warne have been selected this time in the hope of exposing the home side?s vulnerability to wrist-spin. 

Australia have not chosen two leg-spinners for an Ashes tour since 1953 and while Warne is an automatic choice, chairman Trevor Hohns said MacGill deserved his spot after being overlooked last time. 

?Stuart has done everything asked of him when he?s been included in the Test team,? Hohns said in a statement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Title for Mukesh 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Mukesh Kumar completed his fourth win on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour (2004-2005 season), by claiming the inaugural Airtel Open in Mumbai on Friday. 

According to information received here, overnight leaders and Chandigarh lads Harinder Gupta and Ranjit Singh, crumbled with rounds of six over and four over respectively, paving the way for Mukesh to bag the title and the winner?s purse of Rs 1,62,000. 

Three groups behind the leaders Arjun Singh shot a scintillating six-under sixty-four to jump into joint second spot with city?s Firoz Ali. Arjun and Firoz split the second and third place earnings to take home Rs 87,500 each. 

Meanwhile, a final-day show of six-over 78 saw Gaganjeet Bhullar claiming his third title on the Royal Challenge Indian Golf Tour. His four day tally stood at six-over 294, a solitary stroke ahead of second-placed Amardip Sinh Malik who returned a card of two-under 70 in Chandigarh on Friday.

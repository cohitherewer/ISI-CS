 Kidambi keeps hopes alive

Pardubice: International Master S. Satyapragyan missed out on his chances of winning a Grandmaster norm after going down to local favourite GM Petr Haba in the eighth and penultimate round of the Czech International Open chess tournament here. 

IM S. Kidambi played another fine game to beat Erik Zude of Germany to emerge as the only Indian in with a chance for a shared top place. Kidambi has tallied 6 points from eight games. 

Sandipan Chanda, after three straight victories, was held to a draw by German David Hausrath, who played black. Chanda definitely wanted to do better than a draw in the closing stages of the tournament but the defences of Hausrath proved stronger in the end and the German squeezed out half a point from the match. Chanda now has 5.5 points. 

The tournament has been thrown open by Russian GM Vladimir Potkin who scored a hard-earned victory over tournament leader IM Valeri Shalimov of Ukraine. As a result, GM Evgeny Najer of Russia, IM Mikhailo Oleksenko of Ukraine, GM Andrei Kovalev of Belarus and Potkin emerged joint leaders with 6.5 points each. 

The fifth place was shared by as many as 13 players including Kidambi. 

GM Tejas Bakre defeated Ejsmouth Krzysztof of Poland to take his tally to 5.5 points.

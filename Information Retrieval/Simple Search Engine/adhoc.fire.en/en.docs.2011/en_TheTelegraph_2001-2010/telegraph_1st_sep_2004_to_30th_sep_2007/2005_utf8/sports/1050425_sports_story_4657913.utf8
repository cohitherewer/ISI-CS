The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Shoaib has a lot of convincing to do

 - Younis Khan favours pacer?s inclusion for WI tour 

Islamabad: Keen to be a part of the West Indies-bound Pakistan team, Shoaib Akhtar hopes to convince national selectors that he has fully recovered from his hamstring injury that kept him out of the Indian tour. 

?Hopefully, I should be able to convince everyone that I am fit for the West Indies tour when I play in the tournament,? Shoaib was quoted as saying by The News ahead of the Twenty20 Cup tournament beginning in Lahore Monday. 

Chief selector Wasim Bari and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan have already raised doubts over Shoaib?s selection for the Caribbean tour saying he would first have to prove that he was 100 per cent fit before being considered for selection. 

Since the tournament allows a bowler only four-over spell in a match, Bari said the selectors would also like to see him bowl a long spell off his full run up at nets if needed. 

Sources said the Board had got a report on Shoaib?s fitness from South African trainer Grant Compton and were sceptical about him being fully fit. 

They also said Shoaib would not only have to prove his fitness but also convince everyone including captain Inzamam-ul-haq that he was willing to give 100 per cent for the team. 

However, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif and pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan have come out in support of Shoaib being included in the team as they feel his inclusion would definitely strengthen the bowling line up and any attitude problems can be worked out across the board by the top officials. 

Meanwhile, former captain and selection committee chairman Aamer Sohail has slammed coach Woolmer for his rude remarks on shoaib and asked the PCB to take action against him. 

Woolmer in a recent interview with an Indian newspaper had said ?Shoaib is not an integral part of the team.? 

?Woolmer is a part of Pakistan team management who earns his bread and butter from the hard earned public money. The PCB should ask him how he dared to utter such silly words,? Sohail was quoted as saying. 

Sohail said Woolmer?s job was only to stick to his work and not to indulge in mud-slinging. 

?I am astonished over the language used by Woolmer. I had thought of him as an intelligent person. He should have not used such language for Shoaib who has done remarkable service for Pakistan cricket. I demand of Woolmer to apologise to Shoaib and the Pakistani people who would never tolerate such outbursts from a foreigner,? he said.

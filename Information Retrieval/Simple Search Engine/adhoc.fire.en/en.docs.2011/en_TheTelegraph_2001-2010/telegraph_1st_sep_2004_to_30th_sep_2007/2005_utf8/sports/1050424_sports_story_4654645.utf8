 Churchill edge past Mahindra, now 8th 

Margao: Churchill Brothers survived anxious moments in the second half to edge past Mahindra United 2-1 and moved to eighth place in the National Football League match played at the Nehru Stadium here Saturday. 

Churchill started with a flourish and took the lead in the 10th minute through Yusif Yakubu. 

But Mahindra fought back after the deficit and restored parity in the 21st minute through their Brazilian recruit Marcos da Silva. 

Dominating the major part of the match, Churchill scored the winner through Man of the Match Marcos Pereira who powerfully headed in substitute Roque Barreto?s free-kick from the right. 

Mahindra tried hard in the closing stages but could not find the equaliser as they failed to beat alert ?keeper Marc Mascarenhas. 

Churchill are now in a position ? eighth with 20 points from 19 matches ? from where they can think of avoiding relegation. 

Later, Peter Siddique failed to score from close and in the dying minute Marc brought off a good save punching Abhishek Yadav?s header out.

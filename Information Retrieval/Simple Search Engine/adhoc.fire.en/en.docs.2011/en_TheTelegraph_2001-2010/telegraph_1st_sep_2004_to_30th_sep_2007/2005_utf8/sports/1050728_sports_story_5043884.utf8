 Srinath stays in the hunt

Belfort: N. Srinath remained on course for gold in the U-12 boys section of the World Youth Chess Championships after settling for a draw with Hou Yifan of China in the ninth round on Wednesday. 

With just two rounds remaing, Srinath took his tally to eight points out of a possible nine. He is half-a-point adrift of second seed Sujgirov Sanan of Russia who has 7.5 points in his kitty. 

Srinath will next take on Ray Robson who dealt another blow to the medal hopes of top seed Parimarjan Negi after holding him to a draw. 

The other Indian in the medal fray, S.P. Sethuram, moved up to seven points after beating Gil Popliski. 

Sahaj Grover lost his sole lead after he was outplayed by Ivan Bukashvin of Russia among U-10 boys. 

However, circumstances still favour Sahaj to bag gold as he has the best tie-break score in his group. 

In the U-14 boys too, the medal chances of Y. Sandeep (6.5) suffered a huge setback as he was outdone by Maxim Matlakov. 

Among other boys, only G. Rohit remained in contention for a medal in the under-16 boys category, despite drawing his ninth round game with Dergey Trofinov. He moved to seven points. 

Among the girls, K Sai Nirupama jumped to sole second spot in U-10, defeating Susanna Gaboyan. With Anna Iwanow in command here on eight points, Nirupama is just a half-point adrift of the leader. 

In the under-12 girls, however, Meri Arabidze proved much stronger than Indian hope P. Lakshmi Sahiti and coasted to an easy victory, while in the U-14 too, it was a similar story with Mary Muzychuk handing I. Ramya Krishna a crushing defeat. 

WGM D. Harika, among the U-16 girls, remained in contention for a medal after winning her ninth round game and taking her tally to 6.5 points.

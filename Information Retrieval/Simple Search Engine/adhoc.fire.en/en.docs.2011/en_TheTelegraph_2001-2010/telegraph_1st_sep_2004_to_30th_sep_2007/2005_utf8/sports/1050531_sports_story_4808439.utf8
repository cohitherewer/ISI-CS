The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its with my compliments?

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Hanif Mohammed has summed it up beautifully 

by saying Fazal Mahmood was a great human being in addition to having 

been a great fast bowler. 

In fact, Fazal Saab was generous with everything ? be it extra helpings of his favourite Spanish omelette or even time? And, always, he was impeccably dressed. 

Fazal Saab, after all, was Asian crickets first pin-up boy. 

This correspondents last meeting with the legend was as recently as end-February. 

Fazal Saab was somewhat under the weather, 

but promptly agreed to contribute an article for The Telegraphs 75 

years of Indian cricket supplement. 

We spoke for over an hour (at the Ayesha Textiles Lahore office) and, at the end, one asked for his bank account number to transfer a thank-you amount. 

Fazal Saab seemed offended. 

After a few seconds, though, he grinned and said: I dont have to be paid? Not by an Indian newspaper? Its with my compliments? 

Fazal Saab represented a generation thats 

going to be missed forever.

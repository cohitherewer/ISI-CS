The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan a win away from title

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Amal Dutta is not leaving anything to chances. 

Come Sunday, Mohun Bagan will take on Tollygunge Agragami at the Salt Lake Stadium in the CFL Premier Division match with just one aim in mind ? a win. Because a full three points will ensure them the title with two matches in hand. 

Dutta, thus, is set to field a full strength, with both Gley Yao Rodrigue and Eduardo Coelho making a comeback. While Rodrigue missed the previous match due to suspension, Eduardo had been suffering from high temperature. 

Mohun Bagan have 33 points from 11 matches while Tollygunge have eight points.

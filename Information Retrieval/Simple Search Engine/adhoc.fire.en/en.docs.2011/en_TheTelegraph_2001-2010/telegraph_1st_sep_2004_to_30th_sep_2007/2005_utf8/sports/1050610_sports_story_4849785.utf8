 Shabbir to undergo tests in England

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed, who has been reported for a suspect bowling action, will undergo tests in England this week. 

The tests, to be conducted by a biomechanics specialist recommended by the International Cricket Council (ICC), will determine if he is exceeding the tolerance level of 15 degrees of bend allowed for bowlers to straighten their elbows from. 

We are concerned with the fact that Shabbir has been reported for the third time in his career. The tests in England will confirm what corrective measures are required for him, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director of cricket operations Salim Altaf told Reuters on Thursday. 

Shabbir was also reported in September 1999 and January 2004. 

The tall 29-year-old, who has taken 46 Test wickets in nine matches, rattled the West Indies with match figures of eight for 119 in Pakistans victory in the second Test in Jamaica this week. 

He also took five wickets in the first Test in Barbados where he was reported for his action. 

Pakistans next international series is at home to England in October.

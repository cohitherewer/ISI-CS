 London: Troubled England defender Ashley Cole says the fallout surrounding his ?tapping-up? links with Chelsea might have caused an irretrievable breakdown in his relationship with Arsenal. Cole, 24, was fined ?100,000 on Wednesday after being found guilty of approaching Chelsea and the chance of him fulfilling the contract that should keep him at Highbury until 2007 now looks remote.

 ?I think it?s a broken bridge that might be impossible to mend. I blame (chairman) David Dein for trying to force me out of the club I love,? Cole told a tabloid. ?They?ve left me feeling there is no way back, that they don?t want me to put my beloved Arsenal shirt on again. I feel betrayed, confused and badly let down. If there?s no future for me at Highbury then it?s all down to them. It?s no exaggeration to say that they?ve broken my heart.?

 Lisbon: Luis Figo says he is proud to have become Portugal?s most capped player after he emerged from short-lived retirement on Saturday to take part in the team?s 2-0 home win over Slovakia in a World Cup qualifier. ?I am not here to break records but to help the team. But at the same time this means that I have taken part in many matches for my country,? he said. ?I feel very honoured for having defended the jersey of my country so many times,? he added.

 Figo, 32, now has 111 appearances since making his debut in 1991 and is the team?s third-highest scorer with 31 goals. 

 Lisbon: An Indonesian child survivor of Asia?s deadly tsunami fulfilled his dream Saturday and watched as his heroes, Portugal?s national team, defeat rivals Slovakia 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier. Martunis, who was seven when he was rescued after spending 19 days alone on a Banda Aceh beach following the December 26 disaster wearing a red-and-green Portugal jersey, sat in the stands beside AC Milan midfielder Rui Costa, who retired last summer. Fifa president Sepp Blatter gave the boy a cheque of 40,000 Euros, a gift from Portugal football federation.

 Beijing: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge Sunday praised the organisers of the 2008 Beijing Olympics for doing a good job so far. Rogge, said the Beijing organisers have done a very good job in its preparation for the 2008 Olympics and they have received a positive assessment from the IOCs co-ordination commission for the Games.

 His remarks came after the IOC coordination commission, headed by Hein Verbruggen, wrapped up its fourth visit to the host city on Thursday. quot;I have received very positive assessment from Mr Verbruggen, quot; said Rogge, who is here to attend the Beijing Games volunteers launching ceremony.

 During its three-day visit, the IOC co-ordination commission inspected the venues under construction and discussed with Beijing organisers a wide range of subjects such as budget, transport, sport, communications and marketing.

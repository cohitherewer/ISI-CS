 Jaffer, Zaheer shine

Mumbai: Pakistan-bound Wasim Jaffer gave Mumbai a Christmas present by scoring a scintillating 162 to help the 36-time champions recover from a shaky 27 for 2 to 372 for 6 on the opening day of their Elite division group A match against Tamil Nadu here Sunday. 

Jaffer displayed superb stroke-play to notch his third first-class ton of the domestic season and second in the championship. 

The right hander, chosen as one of the three Test openers for the upcoming tour of Pakistan, struck 24 fours and a straight six in his 331-minute, 244-ball essay as he completed 500 runs for the season in the tournament, having scored a classy 267 against Delhi earlier. 

Meanwhile, Zaheer Khan took four wickets and along with fellow Baroda pacer Rakesh Patel wrecked Punjab on the opening day in Vadodara.

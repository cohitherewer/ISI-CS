 Double-bogey shatters Michelle Wie dream

 - I finished under par, so I guess that counts for something 

 By DAVID PICKER

 Michelle Wie after missing the cut on Friday. 

Three months shy of her 16th birthday, Michelle Wie failed on Friday to become the first female golfer in 60 years to make a cut in a PGA Tour event. But she proved once again that she can hold her own against the men. 

Wie shot an even-par 71 in the second round of the John Deere Classic and missed the cut by two strokes. But her 1-under-par 141 was better than 49 golfers who finished two rounds, and she tied with 14 others for 88th place. I finished under par, so I guess that counts for something, said Wie, an amateur competing on a sponsors exemption. 

Wie, who was competing in her third Tour event, said she hoped to make the cut on her fourth attempt, although she would not specify when that would be. She made her first LPGA Tour cut on her fourth try. 

For now, Wie said she would shed no tears. Sometimes Ill cry, sometimes Ill punch, she said when asked about how she put an experience like missing a cut behind her. Sometimes I wont even care. Its different every time. 

After 14 holes, Wie was three under par and it appeared she had a good chance to become the first woman to make a PGA cut since Babe Didrikson Zaharias in the 1945 Tucson Open. The only other women to compete on the Tour were Annika Sorenstam and Suzy Whaley, both in 2003. 

But Wie, who started on the back nine at the 7,193-yard TPC at Deere Run, then showed her age, three-putting from within 21 feet for double bogey on the 367-yard, par-4 sixth hole to go 2-under par. On the next hole, she drove to the edge of a cart path and settled for bogey, her 24-foot par putt running a foot past the hole. 

Those two holes really killed me, said Wie, who called her putts on No. 6 too aggressive. They went by really fast. 

When asked what she got out of her experience playing here, Wie said, I just really realised how important the last six holes are. 

J.L. Lewis, who fired a 65 for a 13-under-par 129, led the tournament by two strokes over Hunter Mahan (68), the first-round leader, and Shigeki Maruyama (63). 

Wie was trying to accomplish a difficult feat. It took Tiger Woods eight attempts as an amateur before he finally made the cut in a PGA event. He missed his first seven cuts by an average of six strokes before doing it at age 19. 

Wie said she was getting used to playing on the Tour. She played in the Sony Open in 2004 and 2005 in her home state of Hawaii, where she missed the cut by one stroke and seven strokes, respectively. In the 2004 tournament, she fired a 68, her best round on the tour. 

On Friday, Wie wore the number 68 on her belt buckle. Sixty-eight was the number I was trying to shoot today, she said. 

It did not quite work out that way. But, playing in the last group of the day, Wie got off to a sizzling start under a strong sun. She birdied four holes on the front nine, including three of the first five, to make the turn in 3-under for the day and 4-under for the tournament. She did not make a bogey until her sixth hole. 

Wies last shot on the front nine might have been her finest of the tournament, a 161-yard approach shot that stopped 10 inches from the cup on the 463-yard, par-4 18th hole. After she tapped in for birdie, the gallery, which was about 20 people deep, roared. 

But for the second consecutive day, Wie struggled on Nos. 1 through 9. She parred the first five holes before double-bogeying on No. 6, where she three-putted after hitting a greenside bunker with her second shot. 

Some players on the Tour were not pleased to see Wie competing here. Before the tournament, Mark Hensby, the defending champion, told the Chicago District Golf magazine, I dont think a 15-year-old girl, whos done nothing at all, should get a sponsors invitation to a PGA Tour event. Others have criticised Wie for not learning how to first win in the amateur ranks. 

But Wie takes pride in breaking down barriers. She became the youngest golfer to win an adult US Golf Association title, the Womens Amateur Public Links Championship, at 13. And she handled herself here with poise and posted some impressive numbers. Her average driving distance over two days, 271.3 yards, is astounding for a 15-year-old girl; the tour average heading into the John Deere was 285.7 yards. Her drive on the second hole sailed 310 yards. 

Wie will now compete in the mens US Amateur Public Links Championship, starting on Monday. The winner traditionally receives an invitation to next years Masters. 

Wie said she likes her chances at the Public Links Championships. After I shot under par here, I feel that I can really compete there, she said.

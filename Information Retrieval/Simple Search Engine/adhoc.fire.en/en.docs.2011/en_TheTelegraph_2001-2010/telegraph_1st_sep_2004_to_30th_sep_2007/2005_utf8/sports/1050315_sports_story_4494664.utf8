 Prince, Zondeki in squad

Centurion: Batsman Ashwell Prince and fast bowler Monde Zondeki were named in South Africa?s squad for the four-Test tour of the West Indies following their good performances in the victory over Zimbabwe on Sunday. 

Prince made an unbeaten 139 and Zondeki had match-figures of nine for 105 as South Africa swept to a win by an innings and 62 runs. 

The 15-man squad will leave country on March 24 for a training camp in Antigua. 

The first Test starts in Georgetown on March 31. 

All 11 members of the team which played in the second Test were picked, including swing bowler Charl Langeveldt, who could not bowl in the second innings because of a back injury. 

Meanwhile, Haroon Lorgat, convenor of South Africa selectors, announced that 13 players will be offered national contracts. 

They include all the West Indies-bound players except A.B. De Villiers and Zondeki, who Lorgat said will have an opportunity in the West Indies to stake a claim to be added to the list.

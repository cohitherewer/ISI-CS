 Atwal upbeat about Indias chances 

 - WORLD CUP GOLF 

 Arjun Atwal feels both he and Randhawa are playing well 

Algarve: Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa are set to make history as the first Indian team to get a direct spot in the World Cup of Golf, the fourth and last in the years World Championship series. 

The Indian duo, which arrived in Portugal on Tuesday, is ready to take on the top teams in the worlds premier team competition at the Victoria Clube de Golfe-Vilamoura in the Algarve region of Portugal. 

It is indeed a great honour to play such an event, said Atwal who was upbeat about Indias chances at the event starting on Thursday. 

We dont intend to go there to make numbers. We intend to do well and we can. Both of us are playing well. 

The two Indians have occupied the top spot in the Asian Tour in the past, Randhawa winning it in 2002 and Atwal, the following year. 

Since then, Randhawa has divided his time between Asian and Japan Tours and next year will divide it between Europe and Asia. Atwal is concentrating totally on the USPGA Tour, for which he has a full card for 2006, which will be his third season in the worlds strongest Tour. 

Randhawa has the added honour of becoming the first Indian to play three World Golf Championship events in a single year ? he has already played in the WGC-NEC Invitational and WGC-American Express Championships. 

However, Atwal did not get to play any of the WGC events this year, but did become the first Indian to make it to the PGA Championships, the years fourth major. 

The World Cup is a big event and getting a direct spot is indeed great. I think we can do well. I have played in Europe, and Portugal should be fine. Arjun also has a lot of experience playing in Europe, Randhawa said. 

Atwal has a strategy of sorts worked out. 

Jyoti hits the ball long and I have been hitting the irons nicely. So on par-five holes we can actually have eagle chances, if I can put the ball on the green on the second shot. Jyoti is a good putter and I am also in good form, he said about their chances in the alternate ball competition. The key is to keep the mistakes down. 

We combine well and our strengths complement each other, added Atwal, who is taking his American caddie Stephen Kay with him. Randhawa has his cousin Bunty Randhawa on the bag. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan may release Akeem

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Following Mohun Bagans early exit in the Federation Cup, Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra sat down with coach Amal Dutta and the players to scrutinise the cause of their poor show. 

The meeting was broken up in two sessions with the players and the coach separately. I have asked the players to forget about the loss and look for the IFA Shield. We have about a month left for the tournament and the players have to work hard for a turnaround, said the club secretary. 

He also said that the performance would be video recorded and discussed with the coach and the technical changes would be sorted out. 

Meanwhile, club sources revealed that Akeem Abolanle will be released before the IFA Shield. Two other foreign recruits ? Edurado Coelho and Gley Yao Rodrigue ? are expected to be in the squad.

 Lanka put Bangla to the sword 

 Sanath Jayasuriya cuts a cake to celebrate his 100th Test in Colombo on Tuesday 

Colombo: Tillekeratne Dilshan and Thilan Samaraweera scored centuries as Sri Lanka piled up 449 runs for seven wickets against Bangladesh at close of play on the opening day of the second and final Test on Tuesday. 

Chaminda Vaas was unbeaten on 61 and Muttiah Muralitharan was on 24 not out. 

Bangladesh grabbed the early initiative, reducing Sri Lanka to 48 for four after the first hour thanks to some intelligent swing bowling from Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain. 

In a brilliant batting performance, Dilshan stroked an aggressive 168 from 179 balls with 19 boundaries and one six before being caught behind off medium pacer Aftab Ahmed. 

Samaraweera played a supportive role, starting aggressively and then dropping anchor while Dilshan ran amok, to finish with 138, including 20 boundaries. 

Hossain had triggered the early collapse by Sri Lanka when his outswinger found the outside edge of Maravan Atapattus bat (11). 

Rasel then trapped Sanath Jayasuriya leg before for 13, ending the 36-year-old openers hopes of marking his 100th Test with a big score. Jayasuriya, the first Sri Lankan in history to reach the milestone, was presented with an award before the start of play by former captain Arjuna Ranatunga.

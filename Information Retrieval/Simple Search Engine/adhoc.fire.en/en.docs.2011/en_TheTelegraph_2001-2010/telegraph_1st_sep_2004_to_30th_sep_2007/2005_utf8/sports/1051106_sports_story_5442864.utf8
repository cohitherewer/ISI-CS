 Dalmiya rubbishes Bindra charge 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Saturday rubbished the allegation that he had masterminded Sourav Gangulys ouster from the current ODI squad, saying I.S. Bindras tirade was aimed at destabilising the East Zone captain amid a crucial Duleep Trophy match against Zimbabwe. 

This is not just a routine allegation ahead of the BCCI elections to malign me, this is aimed at disrupting Souravs concentration as he is busy playing at the CCI in Mumbai? However, any attempts of trying to do so will not go unprotested, Dalmiya, who currently is the CAB president, said here on Saturday. 

Refuting the PCA presidents charge that he had a one-on-one with Team India coach Greg Chappell in Chennai as a pack of lies, Dalmiya said, I have hardly spoken to Chappell, and the few occasions that we have, our conversation never went beyond his contract. 

The former BCCI president also said that he had a chat with Sourav on Friday. 

I told him to concentrate on his job and ignore this hate campaign? In any case, Sourav doesnt need anyone to recommend him. He has led India on merit and will do so again? His record speaks for him, Dalmiya said.

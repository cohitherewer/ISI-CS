Doha: India?s Arjun Atwal, who is leading Asia?s charge, carded 71 to continue in the title frame while Swede Henrik Stenson produced the fireworks on his back nine en route to a two-shot lead after the third round of the Qatar Masters at the Doha Golf Club on Saturday. 

Atwal ended the day in tied sixth place, four off the pace with an aggregate of 210 while Dubai-based Stenson charged up the leaderboard with a flawless six-under-par 66 eyeing his third career title at the $1.5 million event, co-sanctioned for the first time by the Asian and European Tours. 

Atwal, who also plays on the US PGA Tour, made an early run with three birdies in his first eight holes before dropping a bogey on the ninth after finding water with his second shot. He dropped two more bogeys on the back nine against one birdie. 

?I hit it really good on the front nine but struggled on the back nine. I hit it pin high on every hole and had birdie putts on the first eight holes. Then bogeyed nine which I?ve been doing this week. 

?I?m surprised no one is taking a bigger lead. I thought the guys on eight under would have taken a bit more. It was pretty easy as there was hardly any wind when we played. Four back, I?ll give it my best shot tomorrow,? said Atwal. 

Fellow Swede Niclas Fasth, winner in New Zealand in February, carded a 69 with four birdies over his last seven holes for tied second place alongside halfway leader Richard Green of Australia, who scrambled to a 73. 

Els was a frustrated man on the greens, missing numerous birdie chances as he produced some of his best golf. The South African feels he has got an outside chance of landing his second straight title in the gulf after winning an unprecedented third title at the Dubai Desert Classic last Sunday. 

Thailand?s Thaworn Wiratchant started the day two behind the leader but a double-bogey on his first hole saw him sign for a 75 as he dropped to tied 14th place. 

Thaworn got unlucky right from the opening hole, hooking his approach shot into wasteland before running up a double bogey seven.

 Pursuit may come good 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: High Commissioner and Foolish Pursuit are the two horses look best to fight it out for the 1,600 T. V. Reddy Memorial Trophy, the main event here on Thursday. However, the Vishal Yadav-trained Foolish Pursuit, with apprentice Chary in the saddle, appears to have a slight edge over High Commissioner, and may win.

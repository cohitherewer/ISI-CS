The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav must not be reduced to guessing selectors next move

 Former captain Rameez Raja speaks to The Telegraph

Calcutta: The uproar over Sourav Gangulys omission from the final Test against Sri Lanka continues, but the focus really isnt on Motera ? rather, on the three-Test series in Pakistan, beginning early next month. 

The Indian squad will be picked next week (either Wednesday or Thursday). Indications are that Sourav is going to make a comeback, but weve got to wait till the selection process is over. 

As expected, the drama of the past few days hasnt gone unnoticed in Pakistan. Former captain and Board chief executive Rameez Raja is one who has been keeping a tab. 

Owing to my TV assignments, I couldnt watch Souravs innings at the Kotla and, so, cant comment on the quality of his batting? However, a good management would use his aggressive eagerness of seeking to make a point. Sourav, after all, had only just been brought back and would be intent on proving many wrong? 

If, on the other hand, the selectors and the coach feel he has reached the end of the road, that must be conveyed to him immediately? Sourav shouldnt be made to know where he stands through leaks to the Media, Rameez told The Telegraph. 

Agreeing that the Sourav issue has been poorly handled, he added (on his cellphone from Lahore, on Friday evening): Only Sourav can decide whether the team and he need to move on independent of each other, but he must not be reduced to guessing the selectors next move. That, to my mind, is not done? 

In Rameezs opinion, Souravs experience (86 Tests, 5,150 runs) would be useful in Pakistan, but the Shoaib Akhtars are unlikely to feel threatened if he does make the cut. 

I accept experience will be useful, but youve also got to look at what Sourav has done this year? The take has to be realistic? Not that Pakistans plans are going to revolve around individuals, though, he said. 

India may have thrashed Sri Lanka in the Kotla Test, earlier this week, but Pakistans 2-0 win over England makes them favourites ? in Rameezs view, at least. 

Your team has been doing well, but weve played terrific cricket over the past five weeks? Indeed, today, our attack (Shoaib, Mohammed Sami, Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Danish Kaneria) is arguably more balanced than even Australias? 

Then, the dressing room atmosphere has changed? Attitudes have changed? Shoaib, for example, has realised that socialising with Indian film stars isnt what will place him on a pedestal. He was dropped for much of the year, but has returned transformed, Rameez observed. 

Rahul Dravids pre-series assessment can be different, but 15 days (excluding the ODIs) of potentially pulsating cricket is on the cards. 

Surely, the Team India captain is going to concur.

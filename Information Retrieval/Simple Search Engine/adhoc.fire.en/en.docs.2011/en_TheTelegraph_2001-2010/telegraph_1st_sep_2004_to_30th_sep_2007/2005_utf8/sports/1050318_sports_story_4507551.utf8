The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kaif flies in

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Following a request from the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA), the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has permitted middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh to join the Punjab Ranji Trophy squad for their semi-final tie against Mumbai. He was released from Team India this afternoon, BCCI joint secretary Goutam Dasgupta said. 

Yuvraj, who was not included in the team for the ongoing second Test against Pakistan at the Eden, is being replaced by Mohammed Kaif, Dasgupta said. Kaif flew into the city late on Thursday evening. 

Punjab take on Mumbai at the Wankhede Stadium in the five-day semi-final beginning Friday. In another semi-final, Railways face Hyderabad in Delhi. 

Yuvraj left the Eden at about 2.45 pm and on his way to the airport he said: ?It is not a good feeling to sit outside when the team is playing, but it is good that I will get some match-practice by playing the Ranji semi-final.?

 Mourinho, Ferguson face FA censure

Christopher Davies

Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson are each facing a charge of misconduct for comments made after the weekends Premiership matches. 

The FA have asked Mourinho for an explanation after he called Wigans Lee McCulloch a cheat following Saturdays 1-0 victory at Stamford Bridge. He was punished for a similar offence last season after the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final against Manchester United when he made a reference to cheat and was fined. 

During Saturdays match, the Chelsea manager told William Gallas not to throw the ball back to an opponent when McCulloch had taken a knock. We know what fair play is, Mourinho said. When a player is cheating we are not stupid. 

While most observers praised referee Rob Styles handling of Uniteds 1-1 draw against Everton, Ferguson highlighted an incident when Louis Saha tumbled after a challenge by David Weir. I dont know if it was a penalty, Ferguson said. But I dont think we would ever get one from Rob Styles. 

The FA were on Sunday night still considering whether to take any further action against the United manager.

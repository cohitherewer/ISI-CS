 History beckons Bazid

Bridgetown: Bazid Khan could become the second third-generation player in Test history if Pakistan pick him for the first Test against the West Indies starting on Thursday tomorrow at Kensington Oval. 

Bazids grandfather Jahangir Khan played four Tests for India in the 1930s, while father Majid was a permanent fixture in the Pakistan line-up in the 1970s. 

The only other three-generation Test-playing family was the Headleys of England. George played Tests from the early 1930s to the late 1940s, his son Ron played a couple of Tests in 1973 and grandson Dean featured for England in the 1990s. 

Im very excited about the prospect, Bazid said Tuesday. I feel quite proud and it would be an honour to follow in their footsteps. 

The middle-order batsman, who has played three one-day Internationals so far, is expected to take the place of banned captain Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Coming from a cricketing family, there has always been the idea that I would one day make it big in the game? now Im on the verge of getting my big chance, Bazid said. Im not focusing on the family connection, but rather on doing a great job if I get a chance on Thursday.

 Jockeys suspended 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Jockeys S. Paswan and Mark Reuben were suspended by the RCTC stewards following two separate enquiries conducted by them late on Saturday evening. Stewards slapped a five-week suspension on Paswan for his unsatisfactory riding of Sign Of Class in the 1,200m Crystal Man Cup.

 Reuben was, on the other hand, stood down for a three-week period. Reuben?s handling of Way To The Stars, in the 1,400m Spats Colombo Cup, appeared to be questionable. Both punishments starts from March 1.

 Jeev tied 46th after poor final round

Hiroshima: Jeev Milkha Singh crumbled in the end with five bogeys in six holes to bring in a card of five-over 76, which saw him finish at tied 46th in the Woodone Open here on Sunday. 

Jeev ended at six-over 290 with rounds of 69, 74, 71 and 76. Jeev, who started from the tenth, had eight pars in a row, before bogey on the ninth. Then a birdie on the third brought him to par for the day. 

But bogeys on fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth saw him slide down. 

Takao Nogami held back a superb charge from Fijian Dinesh Chand to grab the title. Nogami had a round of three-under 68, while Dinesh shot a eight-under 63 to come from nowhere into contention. 

Nogami, starting the day at 11-under with rounds of 68, 67 and 67, finished at 14-under 270. 

Dinesh, with rounds of 69, 71, 68 and 63, finished just one behind at 13-under 271. Dinesh had three birdies on the front nine and five more on back nine. (PTI)

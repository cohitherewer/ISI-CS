 Real jeered off pitch after another home loss

Madrid: Real Madrid ended their year in miserable fashion as they were jeered off the pitch after a 1-2 defeat by Racing Santander at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. 

Reals fourth home loss of the season came two days after the club confirmed caretaker coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro as the man in charge until the end of the season. 

Real dropped to fifth in the Primera Liga 11 points adrift of leaders Barcelona, who notched up their 13th consecutive win in all competitions with a 2-0 victory over Celta Vigo at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. 

Champions Barcelona have 40 points from 17 games, five ahead of second-placed Osasuna who will defend a 100 per cent home record against Atletico Madrid in the final game of the year on Thursday. 

Valencia moved up three places into third on 32 points after a high-class 3-0 win over struggling Real Mallorca. 

In Italy, Serie A leaders Juventus maintained their eight-point cushion at the top of the division with a 2-0 win over Siena. The Italian champions now have 46 points from 17 matches. 

AC Milan, one point further back in third, also enjoyed an impressive 3-0 win at Livorno. It was the Tuscan sides first home defeat of the season. (Reuters)

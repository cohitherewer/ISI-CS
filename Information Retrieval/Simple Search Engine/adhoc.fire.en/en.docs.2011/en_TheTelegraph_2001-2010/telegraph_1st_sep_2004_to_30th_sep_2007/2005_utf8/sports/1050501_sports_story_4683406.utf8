The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Warne strikes back 

 - ?I play the way I play and I?m not going to apologise? 

 Shane Warne wants the controversy to end 

London: Australian spin legend Shane Warne launched a passionate defence of himself and his Hampshire team as the English county cricket sledging row showed no signs of slipping quietly away. 

Warne insisted his conduct in the controversial clash with Sussex stands up to the closest scrutiny and wants to see the matter brought to a close. 

The world?s leading Test wicket-taker came in for severe criticism from Sussex skipper Chris Adams who accused the leg-spinner of being overly aggressive in his verbal sparring with batsman Matt Prior. 

But on Friday, Warne hit back at Adams. 

?We conducted ourselves in a good manner and the umpires took their hat off to us for the way we clapped their players off when they made a good score,? Warne told a news channel. 

?The game was a hard one, everyone enjoyed it, there was no reports, no nothing. 

?It is disappointing the way Chris Adams conducted himself. I think it is a bit hypocritical the way he did it and I am sure he regrets it now. 

?But it?s closed, let?s move on. It has got far too much airplay as it is.? 

Warne said his conscience is clear and has no plans to apologise for his actions. 

?The reason you only hear about Australians sledging is we don?t say what happens out on the field,? he added. ?We just have a beer afterwards. 

?If people want to say what happens out in the middle and they don?t like it, I can?t control that. I?m not going to apologise for it either. 

?I play the way I play and I?m not going to apologise for the way Hampshire play. 

?Anyone who comes up against us is going to be tested, mentally, physically and if they can sustain the pressure and technically in the way they play, then good. 

?If they don?t like it, we?ll win easily which is good and what we want to do. I?ll make no apologies about the way we play. 

?As I said before, it?s always Australians being accused of sledging generally because we don?t say what other people say, we leave it out in the middle. 

?If anyone says what goes on in the middle, it is up to them and their right to do that if they want to, but if I get sledged out in the middle you won?t hear me saying what anyone said to me.?

Wellington: Australia crushed New Zealand by 122 runs at Napier on Saturday to complete a 5-0 sweep of their one-day series. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting smashed an unbeaten 141, his 16th one-day century and his deputy Adam Gilchrist belted 91 to help the world champions pile on 347 for five from their 50 overs. 

An understrength New Zealand could only manage 225 for eight in reply with Craig McMillan top scoring for the hosts with 63. 

Michael Kasprowicz captured three wickets for 36 runs. 

?We?ve played some great cricket on this tour,? Ponting said. (Reuters)

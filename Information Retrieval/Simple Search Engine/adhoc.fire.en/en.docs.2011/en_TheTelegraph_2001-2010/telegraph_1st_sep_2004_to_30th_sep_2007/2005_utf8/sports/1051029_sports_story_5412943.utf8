 Atwal fixes practice date with Woods

New Delhi: Arjun Atwal has some serious money to win, or lose, over the next fortnight. 

The Indian, the first to play on the US PGA Tour, has fixed a practice round with world number one Tiger Woods ahead of the HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai from November 10 to 13. 

It is the first time Atwal would be practising with Woods, and the 32-year old Indian is keen to beat the legend in this informal bet and pocket the money. 

We put some money because we want to put ourselves under some pressure. It is just practice but we want to practice under pressure, said Atwal, who has played for the past two years on the elite Tour and has secured his card for the next season as well. 

So, whats the bet? 

I am not going to tell you that, it is against the rules, Atwal said with a grin. 

The $5 million event includes Woods and number two Vijai Singh, and is co-sanctioned by the Asian, European, Australian and the Sunshine Tours.

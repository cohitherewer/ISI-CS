 Astroturf for Army in Bangalore

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: They may have ended runners-up on grass, but Army XI?s not too worried about it save the disappointment attached with it. 

Their real priority lies doing well on astroturf and to that extent they are setting up an astroturf in Bangalore. 

?Work has begun on setting up a turf in Bangalore and it will be launched next month,? Army XI coach Gopal Chand informed on Wednesday. ?We don?t play much on grass as our real focus is to do well on astroturf,? he added. 

The turf is being set up by Army Sports Promotion Board. While Army is ready to launch its own turf, BSF?s plan is still on the drawing board.

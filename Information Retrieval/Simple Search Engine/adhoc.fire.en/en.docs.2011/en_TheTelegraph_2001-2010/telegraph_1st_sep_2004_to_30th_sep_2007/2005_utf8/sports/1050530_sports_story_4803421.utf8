 England win 2-1

Chicago: Kieran Richardson had a dream England debut on Saturday as the 20-year-old midfielder scored twice in a flattering 2-1 victory over the US in an international friendly at Soldier Field. 

Manchester Uniteds Richardson had spent the last four months of the season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, helping them avoid relegation from the Premier League, and was given his England chance in the absence of a host of first-team regulars. 

He opened the scoring with only his second touch of the ball, a superb curling free-kick after four minutes, and got his second from 15 metres just before half-time. 

Richardson was the first England player to score twice on his debut since striker David Johnsons double against Wales in a 2-2 draw at Wembley in May 1975.

Springfield: The outdoor oven that was Baltusrol Golf Club on Saturday baked greens, broiled spectators and turned the leader board at the 87th PGA Championship into a delicious souffle, stuffed with more than a few neat story lines. 

At different junctures in the third round, Phil Mickelson and Davis Love III looked as if they were about to become a couple of overcooked victims of the 102-degree afternoon. 

But just as Mickelsons physical conditioning and mental resolve in major championships were about to be questioned again, and just as Loves age and recent inconsistent performances became issues, the two veterans found their way into the lead. 

Mickelson did it with atypical toughness, Love with his old touch. The result was that both are at 6-under-par 204 going into the final round, one stroke ahead of a fast-charging Thomas Bjorn of Denmark, who shot himself into contention with a major-championship record-tying round of 7-under-par 63. 

Though he missed back-to-back birdie putts within 10 feet on the two closing par-5s, Mickelson was proud of the way he overcame the three bogeys he made in the first six holes that cost him the lead. Mickelsons only major victory came when he took the 54-hole lead in last years Masters. 

I thought that after the start, for me to fight and still be in the lead is a huge boost because guys were out there making birdies and I was going the other way, said Mickelson, 35, who shot a 2-over 72. 

Loves round, his third consecutive in 2-under-par 68, played out much differently than Mickelsons. 

Starting out four strokes behind at 4-under, Love birdied the first two holes, but then began to fade with three bogeys in a five-hole stretch. But starting at the par-4 11th, he made three birdies in five holes. 

Suddenly, he was tied for the lead and, except for one hole, when he bogeyed the par-3 16th, remained there. So Love finds himself in the final pairing at a major for the first time since the 2003 British Open at Royal St. Georges, where he finished tied for fourth. 

Im hitting the ball more solidly than I have in a while, said Love, 41, who hasnt won a tournament in two years and, until recently, has been troubled by back problems. 

Among the more notable names near the top include two-time and defending champion Vijai Singh and former PGA champion Steve Elkington of Australia at 4-under 206; and two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa, former British Open champion Ben Curtis and Englands Lee Westwood (207). 

And then there is two-time PGA champion Tiger Woods, who after barely making the cut Friday, shot a 4-under 66 to climb back to even par. But Woods, looking to win his third major this year and 11th of his career, left the Lower Course as hot as the weather after making pars on the closing par-5s. 

A little (ticked) right now, Woods said. I thought if I shot 63 today, it would be a pretty good number. 

Only one player had that magic number. With eight birdies and one bogey, Bjorn climbed up the leader board early, tying the record for a major-championship round held by 21 others, including Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf, both of whom shot that score here in the opening round of the 1980 U.S. Open. 

Ive always been a guy that enjoyed playing tough golf courses when its tough, said Bjorn, 34. I really dont enjoy these 25-under-par things. So to get on a golf course like this, to post this kind of number, is certainly special to me. Its a long list, but its certainly a good list to be a part of.

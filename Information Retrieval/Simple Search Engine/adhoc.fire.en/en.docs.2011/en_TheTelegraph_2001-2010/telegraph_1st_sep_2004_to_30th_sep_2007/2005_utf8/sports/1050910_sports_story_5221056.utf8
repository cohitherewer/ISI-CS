The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Iranian lady enjoying new life 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bahareh 

Calcutta: Not many women in Iran dared to break the male bastion, but squash referee Bahareh Karagah is an exception. 

No wonder that Bahareh, who happens to be the general secretary of the Iran Squash League Association, didnt think twice when she got an invitation to come here and officiate a few matches. 

When I received the invitation, I didnt have any problem to convince my family or the community. No many in my country enjoy such freedom... so in this sense, I feel lucky, Bahareh told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Bahareh informed that Iran are going to host first-ever womens international squash tournament in Tehran where she will be one of referees. Since that is a womens meet, only ladies will be allowed to officiate and only women can throng the stands, she pointed out. 

Bahareh, who started playing squash some five years back, had to enter the court with scarf and covered T-shirts on and that forced her to discontinue playing the game for long.

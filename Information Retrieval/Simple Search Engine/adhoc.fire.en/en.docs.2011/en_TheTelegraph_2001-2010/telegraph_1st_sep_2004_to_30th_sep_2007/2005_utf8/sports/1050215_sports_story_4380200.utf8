The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No 2nd trip for Pak ?team?

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Unless Monday?s position changes, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) won?t send its venue inspection team on another trip to India. 

That, then, is good news for the Delhi and District Cricket Association and the Kotla. 

The two-member (Zakir Khan and Sohail Khan) inspection team, after all, had announced it would return to New Delhi ?after three weeks? at the end of its January 24-31 visit. 

The Kotla is undergoing extensive renovation and there?s this apprehension that it may not be completed ahead of the fifth and final ODI of the forthcoming series, on April 9. 

?The inspection team isn?t going to make a second trip? Of course, we do hope everything will be ready in time,? a PCB source told The Telegraph, when contacted in Lahore. 

Incidentally, owing to the tight schedule, the Khans couldn?t visit Kochi and Vizag (scheduled to stage the first and second ODIs). With a second visit off, both are set to be cleared without an inspection. 

Meanwhile, according to Jharkhand State Cricket Association president Amitabh Choudhary, the Director General of Civil Aviation has given permission for a chartered ATR-42 to ferry the teams to-and-from Jamshedpur. 

The Steel City is to host the fourth ODI, on April 6. 

The ATR is going to be in service for carrying the teams from Calcutta (after the Kanpur ODI) and, then, taking them to Ranchi for a connection on a regular flight to New Delhi.

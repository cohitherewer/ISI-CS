 Eleven hopes for the New Year

 - 2005 must bring silverware for Chelsea, action against racism and a look at the England captaincy 

Henry Winter 

 The national obsession with Rooney?s life is damaging him 

London: The following are my wishes for 2005: 

CHELSEA 

The consistently prodigious displays of John Terry, the player of the season so far, and Frank Lampard must be rewarded with some silverware. Chelsea?s heart and soul, the English pair operate with discipline and resolution. People moan about Chelsea?s wealth but their real riches lie in the character of individuals like Terry, Lampard, Damien Duff and the coach, Jose Mourinho.. 

REFEREEING 

The ridiculous clause jettisoning good referees on grounds of age, such as the well-respected Paul Durkin, must be waived even before Brussels legislation arrives. The killjoy law forcing referees to caution goalscorers who remove their shirts must be scrapped; football has become such a serious business that elation should be encouraged. The 10-yard rule for dissent should be applied far more frequently; it would punish the unseemly hounding of officials by creating more chances. Linesmen should become more involved in decision-making, particularly when spotting the blatant shirt-pulling, nudging and deliberate bumping that scars set-pieces. 

SIMULATION 

Even in the pantomime season, Tal Ben Haim?s melodramatic tumble was as offensive as Wayne Rooney?s hand-off (while the Manchester United striker was arguably guilty of a dive in the first place). Forget Ben Haim, an insignificant actor on the Premiership stage. The real sadness is in witnessing such sweet ball-movers as Rooney, Robert Pires, Cristiano Ronaldo and Arjen Robben stooping to such subterfuge. Kids copy them. Fact. The appliance of such dark arts as diving to cheat fellow professionals, damages football and must be confronted by the Professional Footballers? Association. 

WAYNE ROONEY 

Of course he should channel his aggression better. But we must never forget he is a teenager whose background hardly prepared him for handling fame and fortune. The national obsession with the minutiae of Rooney?s life demeans us and damages him. Heaven knows, England boast few enough virtuoso talents that we can afford to lose one of Rooney?s phenomenal potential. Fortunately, he has the ideal footballing father figure in Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, who will protect him in public and put him right in private. 

FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION 

The new chief executive, Brian Barwick, must run the organisation like a coalition, using his famed affability to break down barriers between governors, players, managers, chairmen, amateurs and supporters. Changes are required. The FA?s executive board should be more representative, including a lobbyist for fans? rights. 

CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 

Even taking into account the post-Heysel wilderness years, one European Cup triumph since 1984 is embarrassing for a country that prides itself on the quality of its domestic league. People confuse excitement with excellence. The Premiership?s constant turnover of possession does not prepare teams for more subtle Continental duelling. That might be changing. The spirit is stirred by the sight of Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool ? teams who appreciate the importance of accurate passing ? all involved in last-16 ties. AC Milan, United?s opponents, look eventual winners but do not rule out a welcome English presence in the Istanbul final. If Mourinho?s savvy Chelsea can overcome Barcelona, the Premiership may finally live up to its cheerleaders? hype. 

CHARLTON ATHLETIC 

If only every club were like the Happy Valley residents, English football would be a far better place. Well run on and off the pitch, Charlton are a model of footballing and financial prudence, exuding ambition without ruinous risk. A dribbler like Jerome Thomas for ?100,000? You?re having a laugh! Yet more good business for a club which specialises in it. Fan-friendly, Charlton are a genuine community focal point with players often involved in charity work. 

RACISM 

The cancer persists. The game?s international governors, Uefa and Fifa, appear unwilling to excise this malignant growth in the body of European football, so it is down to right-minded individuals like England?s players, the PFA and the FA to lead the campaign against discrimination. The urge to walk off pitches should be resisted because the racists will smugly feel their poisoned barbs have found the target. The way forward can be only through education, through players like Sol Campbell, David Beckham and other icons railing against the evil of racism. 

ENGLAND 

With qualification for the 2006 World Cup finals all but guaranteed, this year must be used for fine-tuning. Blessed with belief, touch and pace, Stewart Downing looks the long-term answer to England?s left-sided problem but must be given a run of five starts at least to become assimilated. The captaincy is now an issue, not because of David Beckham?s unspectacular form but because Steven Gerrard has matured into England?s most important midfielder and a dynamic leader of Liverpool. 

WAGES 

For all its faults, football remains the best show in town and the headline acts, Lampard, Gerrard, Henry and Van Nistelrooy, deserve their handsome remuneration. Yet too many members of the supporting cast are paid unsustainable amounts. Remember that Winston Bogarde raked in ?40,000 a week guesting for Chelsea reserves and going shopping. Remember that Patrick Kluivert receives ?136,000 every fortnight for not delivering on Tyneside. The numbers do not add up. Football must accelerate the trend towards performance-related packages, with affordable salaries topped up by generous bonuses for trophies, league position, goals, clean sheets, promotion, European qualification, full houses and merchandising. 

TELEVISION 

It was tempting to summon Sky engineers the other evening because something seemed wrong with the picture, something rarely experienced before: no live game was being broadcast. From satellite to terrestrial, the quality of coverage is undeniably outstanding, and emerging commentators of John Murray?s calibre are a delight to listen to, but the nightly feast causes indigestion. Televised football is not special any more, it is often just ?on in the background? which is sad because we are in the grip of a fascinating Premiership race. Less can be more. Football?s lifeblood, the match-going fans, also deserve some sanity restored to a schedule ripped up by television.

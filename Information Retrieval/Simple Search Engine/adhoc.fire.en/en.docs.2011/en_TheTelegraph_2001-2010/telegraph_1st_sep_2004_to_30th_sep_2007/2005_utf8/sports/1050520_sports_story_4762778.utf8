 Hewitt pulls out 

Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt has withdrawn from the French Open after failing to recover from a rib injury he sustained last week in an accident at his Sydney home. 

I have decided to take doctors advice and not play next week as returning too early runs the risk of prolonging my recovery period, the No. 2-ranked Hewitt said in the statement released late Thursday by Tennis Australia. This is obviously disappointing but I am taking a longer term approach. 

My sights are now firmly set on the forthcoming grass-court season starting with Queens and then Wimbledon, building up to (Australias) tough Davis Cup tie against Argentina in Sydney. 

The Queens tournament starts June 6. (AP)

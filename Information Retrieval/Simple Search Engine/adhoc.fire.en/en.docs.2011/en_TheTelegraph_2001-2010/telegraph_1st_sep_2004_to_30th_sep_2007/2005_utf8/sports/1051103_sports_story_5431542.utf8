 Enjoying Sachin duel: Murali

 - Jayasuriya: No question of any additional pressure 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Murali 

Pune: They had played a huge role in Sri Lankas elevation to the No. 2 spot in world rankings and were supposed to come out with guns blazing on this tour as well. Sanath Jayasuriya and Muttiah Muralidharan hold as much key to the visitors hopes as does Sachin Tendulkar for India. 

Unfortunately, the pair has failed to strike form and the results are there for all to see. While Jayasuriya has been bothered by a shoulder injury, Muralis tricks have proved to be inadequate. For the record, though, the offie braved the Mahendra Singh Dhoni carnage to return with best figures of 10-1-46-2. 

The Sri Lankans may still be psychologically struggling to come to terms with the Dhoni aftermath, but Murali tried to play it down. Its just been a good innings executed exceptionally well. Nothing more. Theres no question of it having any impact on us. Things are back to normal... It was all a matter of one match, he told The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon. 

In one-dayers things may not always fall in place even if you try hard. The key is to stay positive. In Test matches, things will obviously be different, he explained. 

Everyone has been trying hard but things are just not working out. Anything can happen any day. Theres no question of any pressure on the side... Its just a game and the Indians have enjoyed the luck so far... Things can turn around anytime. Were not trying to cite any excuses but theres still plenty of cricket left in this series, Murali remarked. 

Sanath Jayasuriya also agreed. No question of any additional pressure. I look at it this way ? one exceptional innings from Dhoni took the match away in Jaipur. My form has been a bit disappointing, but I would like to see myself getting more runs, he said. I dont think we need to change anything. The shoulder injury is improving, he added. 

Murali is enjoying his duel with Sachin Tendulkar. I am happy with my bowling. The battle will be more intense in Tests as in one-dayers a bowler is limited to only ten overs. Nevertheless, Im enjoying my battle with Sachin. He is a class act and is playing well. The problem is he has to commit one mistake while I cant afford to do any, he said. 

Kaif fit 

Mohammed Kaif has been declared fit by Team India physio John Gloster. Kaif, who was battling a hamstring injury, arrived with the squad and underwent a fitness test at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. He will now play for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy match against North Zone in Aurangabad from Friday. 

His inclusion means he will be under consideration when the selectors meet in Ahmedabad to pick the squad for the last couple of ODIs in Rajkot and Vadodara. Meanwhile, Rahul Dravid visited an orphanage in the afternoon and was touched by the kids affection.

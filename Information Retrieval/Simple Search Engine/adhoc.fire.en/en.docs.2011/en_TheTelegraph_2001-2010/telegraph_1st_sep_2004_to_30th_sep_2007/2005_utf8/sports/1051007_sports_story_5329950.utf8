 Morozevich shock for Anand 

 Anand is almost out of the championship race 

San Luis: Viswanathan Anands quest for the World Championship title received a near-decisive setback as the Indian suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of tailender Alexander Morozevich of Russia in the seventh round of the World Chess Championship here. 

With his second loss in four days after a fine 2.5/3 start, Anand was pushed to a 50 percent score and now stands only joint third in the 8-players double round-robin event. 

Meanwhile, Veselin Topalovs dominance over an otherwise elite field continued, as he coasted to his sixth overall and fifth straight victory. On the receiving end was defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan, who was outdone in a finely played endgame. 

At the half-way stage of this $1 million event, Topalov (6.5 points) retained his two-point lead over Russian Peter Svidler who scored over Hungarian Judit Polgar. 

Yet again the day produced all decisive games with Peter Leko coming out good against Michael Adams of England, who is now firmly in the cellar along with Polgar with just 2 points. 

Anand, on 3.5 points, has the company of Peter Leko while Kasimdzhanov and Adams share the fifth spot with 3 points each in their bags. 

Anands loss once more indicated that the he is not in best shape. Morozevich dominated proceedings for the major part of this Caro Kann defence game where the former played black. 

The Short attack, named after Englands Nigel Short who is one of the commentators here, gave Morozevich ample board room in the early stages of the middle game and prompted the Russian to sacrifice an exchange for just one pawn on the 22nd move. 

Thereafter the Russian, who had been struggling thus far without a win in the championship, whirled his pieces in perfect accordance with the position and his win was quite obvious by the 30th move. 

Anand tried a few tricks towards the end hoping for a miracle that did not come forth and threw in the towel after 50 moves.

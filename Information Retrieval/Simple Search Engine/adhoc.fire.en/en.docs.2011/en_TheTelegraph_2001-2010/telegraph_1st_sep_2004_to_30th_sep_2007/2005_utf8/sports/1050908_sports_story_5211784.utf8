 Kim outguns Venus

 - Federer drops a set to Kiefer, faces Nalbandian in last eight 

 Lleyton Hewitt celebrates his win over Dominik Hrbaty at Flushing Meadow on Tuesday 

New York: The burning desire of Kim Clijsters illuminated New Yorks midnight hour on Tuesday, and her reward was a place in the US Open semi-finals. 

Fourth seed Clijsters overturned a set and 2-4 deficit against Wimbledon champion Venus Williams to claim a 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 quarter-final victory that she described as the best of her career. 

In the last four, the in-form Belgian will face Russian top seed Maria Sharapova, who clawed her way to an equally compelling 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 win over compatriot Nadia Petrova. 

Mens champion Roger Federer safely reached the quarter finals despite the shock of dropping a set against German Nicolas Kiefer, but for the first time the womens singles took the spotlight with its two quarter finals providing a five-hour slab of spellbinding action. 

Clijsters lost four Grand Slam finals before a chronic wrist injury threatened her career in 2004, and was jubilant in her moment of triumph after wearing out Venus in a match that finished 36 minutes into Wednesday. 

This definitely means a lot more than any win that I had before my surgery, the 22-year-old said. I was seeing the ball really well out there. I just kept going for it. 

Clijsters said her defensive scrambling, which saw her do the splits at one stage, had been important in her victory. 

Even though I probably wasnt playing my best tennis at all, for a set and a half, I was still fighting, she said. 

I was defending well. I think thats kept me in a lot of the games... We had a lot of long rallies, and I think that got her tired. 

I noticed that she wasnt running as well as she used to. And not moving as well. I knew that if I would win that second set I was going to have a good chance to win because I felt fine. 

Venus was at a loss to explain her defeat. 

I think I was playing decent, Williams said. 

And she started playing really bad, and it totally threw me off. She started hitting these really weird shots and short balls and just weird stuff. 

Next thing I knew, I was playing as bad as she was, and she was able to recover, it seemed like I just wasnt. 

Kiefer, who was the only man to take a set off world No. 1 Federer during the Wimbledon Championships, took another off him before bowing 4-6, 7-6, 3-6, 4-6. 

Its always a strange feeling when that happens, said the Swiss. Four sets says it all. It was difficult. 

Federer remains on course for a semi-final showdown with third seed Lleyton Hewitt, the Australian he thrashed in last years final, after Hewitt won his fourth-round match against Dominik Hrbaty with aplomb (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). 

Before that, of course, Federer must beat dangerous Argentine 11th seed David Nalbandian, the 2003 semi-finalist who ousted Italian Davide Sanguinetti, in the quarter finals. 

Nalbandian saw off Sanguinetti 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 and will face Federer with some confidence, having won five of their previous seven encounters. 

Hewitt will play Jarkko Nieminen, who earlier became the first Finn to reach a Grand Slam quarter final when he floored Spains Fernando Verdasco 6-2, 7-6, 6-3. 

Kiefers ability to vary the pace of his shots has often troubled Federer in the past and the Swiss looked uneasy from the start on Arthur Ashe Court. 

It was only while facing a moment of real danger, trailing 30-40 at 3-3 in the third set, that Federer roused himself from mediocrity with a wondrous backhand winner to hold serve. He controlled the match thereafter. 

The heavily disguised crosscourt winner was reminiscent of the one Federer played in the final game of his four-set struggle against Kiefer in the third round at Wimbledon. 

It was an unbelievable shot, Kiefer said. The angle was just too good. 

Hewitt, the champion in 2001, hammered Hrbaty 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. 

The Australians only real distraction was the Slovaks dandy pink and black shirt with two holes cut out of the back. Hewitt is not quite so in touch with his feminine side and said: I didnt want to lose to a bloke wearing a shirt like that. 

His win meant he has reached the quarter finals at Flushing Meadow six times in a row. 

Its a great record to have here, Hewitt said. Its not an easy Grand Slam to do well at every year. So its a huge positive. I love playing in New York.

 Sania makes early exit

 Sania lost 3-6, 3-6 to Gisela Dulko of Argentina 

Paris: Sania Mirzas French Open campaign ended with a whimper after she lost in the first round of the clay court Grand Slam womens singles at the Roland Garros here on Tuesday. 

Sania, yet to reach her peak fitness after an ankle injury eight weeks ago and playing in only her second tournament on comeback, went down 3-6, 3-6 to 30th ranked Gisela Dulko of Argentina. 

The 18-year old Indian did well to break her opponent four times, twice in each set, but Dulkos experience on the red clay helped her bounce back every time and prevail over the Indian to close the issue in an hour and 17 minutes. Sania received one WTA point and 11,790 euro for her effort. She would now turn her attention to the doubles play where she partners Anna Chakvetadze of Russia. 

The match failed to raise to a level as both the players committed series of unforced errors ? 32 and 31 for Sania and Dulko, respectively ? but the Argentine won 72 points as against Sanias 58. 

Sania, the first Indian woman to reach the third round at Australian Open, had said ahead of the match that clay court not being her favourite court and her opponent a specialist on the surface, she had a tough ask on the hand but she would give all she had. 

Sania did give all she had, as she frequently caught Dulko off guard with her trademark forehands. But she lacked the consistency and her rival came up with clever variations in the depth of her strokes to upset her rhythm. 

The second set saw the players trade breaks but in the seventh game, Sania put an easy forehand into the net to drop serve and went down 3-4. 

Dulko then had two double faults but managed to save three breakpoints. 

She then hammered the last nail in the coffin by breaking Sania once more to hasten the end. In all, Sania and Dulko had an ace each, five and eight double faults, respectively and first serve percentage of 50 and 54 per cent. (PTI)

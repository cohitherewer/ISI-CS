Sydney: Australia strolled to a nine-wicket win over Pakistan in the third and final Test Wednesday to complete a 3-0 series sweep. 

The Australians wrapped up victory late on the fourth day at the Sydney Cricket Ground, wiping off the 62 required runs in 9.3 overs. 

The lone casualty was Justin Langer who was bowled by Pakistan leg spinner Danish Kaneria for 34 with victory just four runs away. 

Matthew Hayden finished 23 not out while Australian captain Ricky Ponting drove the only ball he faced to the fence to seal the victory and finish the series with a batting average over 100 after his double-century in the first innings. 

Pakistan began the day on 67 for one in their second innings, needing to make at least 264 to force the Australians to bat again, and were dismissed for 325 shortly after tea. 

Asim Kamal ensured the tourists at least managed to avoid an innings defeat when he propped up the tail with 87 while opener Yasir Hameed made 63 but the target of 61 was never enough to worry the world champions. 

?I don?t think we played our best cricket today, but we won the game comfortably as I predicted we would,? Ponting said. ?We didn?t bowl our best and we let them get 60-odd runs in front, but we did what we had to do with the bat at the end.? 

Shane Warne was the pick of the Australian bowlers, capturing four for 111 while fellow leg-spinner Stuart MacGill added three scalps to his five from the first innings to win the Man of the Match award. 

The Australians comfortably won the two previous Tests in Perth and Melbourne inside four days and it had seemed certain Pakistan would concede an innings defeat after slumping to 164 for four before lunch, but Kamal defied the bowlers for more than three hours. 

Despite running out of partners at regular intervals, Kamal kept his own wicket intact and then shared a last-wicket partnership of 55 with Test debutant Mohammad Asif, who remained not out 12. 

Hameed had also played strongly at the top of the innings. He began the day on 40 and reached his 50 within the first half an hour of play before his resistance ended when he was trapped lbw by Warne with the total on 104. 

?I think you?ve got to give Pakistan some credit. They scored nearly 650 runs in this match and that would normally win you a lot of Tests,? Warne said. ?I thought Shoaib (Akhtar) gave his heart out as much as he could through the whole series... and Danish Kaneria is a really talented bowler. 

?I think Shoaib is a real trier... He is the fastest bowler in the world... He obviously wasn?t as fit as he would have like in this Test or he would have bowled more than 15 overs in 130-140 overs. He was obviously hurting and he gave his best shot.? 

Warne had also some kind words for MacGill. ?Stewie and I get on fine, contrary to what some people think,? Warne said. ?The comparisons (with me) are always going to be probably unfair on Stewie. If I wasn?t around he would be playing a lot of Test cricket and doing a real good job. (But) that?s not my fault, either. 

Younis Khan and stand-in captain Yousuf Youhana steadied the innings with a third wicket stand of 60 only to fall in successive deliveries just before lunch. 

Pakistan went to lunch at 172 for four but piled on 151 in an extended afternoon session before Australia finished them off after tea.

 Aperitivo has the appetite 

 STAR RACER

 Vijay Singh

Calcutta: Sunday will be a day of reckoning 

for the four-year-old classic horses in the city. The exclusive category has toiled 

and slogged its way up to make the cut for the most illustrious event in the RCTC 

racing calendar, the 2,400-metre Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes. There are eight 

in the line-up, including two fillies ? Make A Wish, a moderate performer from 

Daniel David?s yard, and her fair sex stablemate Star Angel. Moon Emperor, also 

from the same stable is another Derby hopeful from the stable eyeing the winner?s 

purse of over Rs 15 lakh. 

 Star Angel has, however, already collected two classics ? the Calcutta 1,000 Guineas, over 1,600 metres,. and the 2,400m Oaks in runaway manner. But she hardly beat anyone of repute on each occasion. The livewire in the line-up will be Moon Emperor? a facile winner of the 2,000 Guineas ? and Vijay Singh?s Aperitivo who was placed only a length behind the former in the same race. However, he is considered to be a suspect over the Derby trip despite the fact that the Placerville-Menorah son is bred to stay. His morning workouts, though brilliant over a metric mile, leave element of doubt over middle distances. It may have prompted Vijay to pack the field with five and each one has a job assigned. 

 Strategies are know to have paid off in mega events like Derby. The likes of Calorifics, Exclusive Affairs, Bountiful Treasures and Formal Invitations ? Vijay?s quartet ? are, therefore, going to sacrifice their chances playing a relay game upfront for the convenience of Aperitivo. The sizzling hot-pace may make Moon Emperor?s task as much difficult, though Star Angel may enjoy every bit of it. Moreover, Derbies does not always mean dominance of the masculine power as was proved by last year?s winner Psychic Flame, and also by quite a few other fillies in the RCTC?s history of Classics. But Star Angel has displayed plenty of stamina and less of speed, Aperitivo appears to be a right balance between the two necessary elements needed to make a champion, or a Derby winner. 

 Sunday?s Classic, therefore, could turn out to be an interesting contest between the contrasting packages. But call it a gender-bias, a gut feeling or microanalysis, it is Aperitivo who has the capabilities to upstage all. C. Alford partners the Diffident -Dramatic Irony son.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

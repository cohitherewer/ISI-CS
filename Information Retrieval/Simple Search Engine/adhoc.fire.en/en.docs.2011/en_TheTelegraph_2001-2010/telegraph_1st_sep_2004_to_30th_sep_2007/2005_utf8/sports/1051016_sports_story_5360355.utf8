 Amal Dutta hospitalised 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagans last-minute preparations for Federation Cup received a jolt on Saturday when coach Amal Dutta was admitted to a city hospital following chest pain. He has been kept under 48-hour observation. 

Dutta, who had earlier had a bypass surgery, complained of the pain after returning home following the practice session and was immediately rushed to the hospital. Mohun Bagan will leave for Goa on Sunday. Assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee will accompany the squad, and Dutta is likely to join them after his release. 

Meanwhile, Bhaichung Bhutia is learnt to have given his consent to the contract East Bengal have offered him. Hes likely to sign for the club on Monday. 

On the other hand, Mohammedan Sporting club has decided to showcause Madhab Das on grounds of indiscipline. The defender is unlikely to feature in the Federation Cup squad. 

In another development, Jose Ramirez Barreto landed in Mumbai on Saturday to play for Mahindra United.

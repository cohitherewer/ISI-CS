Yokohama: Brazils Sao Paulo survived a second-half siege to beat European champions Liverpool 1-0 and win Fifas World Club Championship on Sunday. 

Midfielder Mineiro latched on to a clever through-ball from Aloisio to fire past goalkeeper Pepe Reina in the 27th minute and give the South American champions their third world title. 

Liverpool dominated for large periods and had three goals disallowed as they failed in their bid to become world champions for the first time. 

We scored three goals but they didnt allow any of them, said Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez. We made lots of chances and did enough to win the game. 

Mineiros strike snapped Liverpools club record of 11 successive clean sheets and was the first goal they had conceded in 1,042 minutes of play. 

Liverpool almost struck back moments after the goal when Luis Garcia flicked a Xabi Alonso corner onto the crossbar. Rafael Benitezs side should have been in front as early as the second minute when Spanish striker Fernando Morientes missed the target with a point-blank header. 

Garcia came close with two more headers and Gerrard blasted wide in the 35th minute after good work from Harry Kewell on the left. 

Gerrard forced a superb save from Sao Paulo goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni with a curling free-kick six minutes into the second half. 

Garcia had a headed goal disallowed for offside and Morientess spectacular overhead kick flashed just wide as Liverpool probed for an equaliser. Mexican referee Benito Archundia also ruled out a Sami Hyypia effort after adjudging that Alonsos corner had curled out before the big Finn volleyed it home. 

Substitute Florent Sinama Pongolles late effort was then disallowed for offside, to the annoyance of Liverpools players and most of the 68,000 crowd. (Reuters)

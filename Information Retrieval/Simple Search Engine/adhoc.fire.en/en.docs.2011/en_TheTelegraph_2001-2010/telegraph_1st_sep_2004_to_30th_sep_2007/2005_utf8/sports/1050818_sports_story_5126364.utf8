 Panel to submit report in 2 months

New Delhi: The inquiry tribunal to look into the doping allegations against discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh will be set up soon and will give its report in about two months, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) said on Wednesday. 

A committee would be formed according to the format of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and based on its conclusions the future course of action will be decided, AFI president Suresh Kalmadi said here. 

The panel will go into the Ukraine angle and what happened during Neelams week-long stay in Kiev before the World Athletics, he said. 

The IAAF procedures for an inquiry will be followed and only after its results are confirmed can we reach any conclusion, the AFI chief said, adding, the regulations forbid us to comment on the subject as the process needs to be totally confidential. 

The federation defended its decision to send athletes to east European countries before major competitions, citing better facilities and infrastructure there. 

The training facilities and other infrastructures in those countries are world class and we have made a conscious effort to provide our athletes with the best facilities possible, AFI secretary Lalit Bhanot said. 

Even at the World Championships, the results achieved by these countries were very commendable, Bhanot said.

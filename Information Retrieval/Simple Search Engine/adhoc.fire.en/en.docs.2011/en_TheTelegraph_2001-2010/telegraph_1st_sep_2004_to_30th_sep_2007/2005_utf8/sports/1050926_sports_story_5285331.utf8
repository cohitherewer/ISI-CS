The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Berlin move up

Frankfurt: Hertha Berlin moved up to fourth place with a 1-0 win away to Cologne on Sunday, while VfB Stuttgart eased the pressure on Giovanni Trapattoni by beating Kaiserslautern by the same score. 

Herthas only goal came from Alexander Madlung in the 52nd minute of an uninspiring Bundesliga game. 

Madlung reacted quickly to squeeze a shot past Cologne keeper Stefan Wessels after the ball had fallen to him at a corner. 

It was enough to take Hertha to within four points of Bayern Munich, who retained the league leadership despite a 1-0 defeat by Hamburg SV on Saturday. 

With seven games played, Bayern are top with 18 points, followed by Hamburg on 17. Werder Bremen are third with 16 after beating Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 on Saturday, with Hertha now fourth with 14.

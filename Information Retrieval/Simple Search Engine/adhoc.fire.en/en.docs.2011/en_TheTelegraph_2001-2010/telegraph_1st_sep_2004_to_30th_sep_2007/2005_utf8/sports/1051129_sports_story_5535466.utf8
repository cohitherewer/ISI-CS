 Hyderabad meet moved to Bangalore

Bangalore: Indias first WTA Tour event has been moved out of Hyderabad and will be played here from February 13 to 19. 

The announcement was made by Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh, doubles specialist Mahesh Bhupathi and Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association secretary C.S. Sunder Raju at a press conference on Monday. 

Bhupathi said the intention behind shifting the $175,000 (Tier III) event, now christened the Bangalore Open, was to scale up interest in other cities as well. 

In Hyderabad, the success of Sania Mirza was immense. 

The whole country watched. The aim is to move the event to a different geography and different level, Bhupathi said, adding that the focus now was to hold it here successfully. We want to keep it here, he said. 

Bangalore is hosting an event of this stature for the first time. The event, to be held at the KSLTA Signature-Kingfisher Stadium, may attract a few top names, according to KSLTA officials. Indian players Sania and sisters Shikha and Neha Uberoi, and Sunitha Rao are sure to take part. 

The city has witnessed international tournaments like the Legends Cup and the World Doubles Championship. 

Meanwhile, regarding playing doubles with Sania, Bhupathi said: This is something we dont prefer to put pressure on. When its supposed to happen, it will happen. 

When it was pointed out that he had hinted he would pair up with Sania after she broke into the top 50, he said, there is still some possibility. I know her ranking; I am her manager. 

It could happen in Australia (at the Australian Open); it could happen in 2008. I am not going to put a time frame on it When we are ready to play, we will play, he said.

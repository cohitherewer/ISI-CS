London: Two Brazilians called Adriano made their mark in Champions League qualifying matches on Wednesday. 

The famed Brazil international laid on one goal and scored the other for Inter Milan in their 2-0 away win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the first leg of the third qualifying-round tie in Ukraine. 

Striker Obafemi Martins put Inter ahead in the 67th minute from a back-heeled pass by Adriano. Eleven minutes later, Adriano headed home a high cross from substitute Ze Maria. 

The lesser known Adriano Pimenta scored for Swiss side Thun, who took another step in their rise to a possible place in the lucrative group stage with an upset 1-0 win over Malmo. 

Liverpool also won but Sporting, losing finalists in the Uefa Cup three months ago, were upset 0-1 at home by modest Italian side Udinese, who scored from a first-half penalty through Vincenzo Iaquinta. 

Liverpool, forced to play all three qualifying rounds after finishing fifth in the Premier League, won 3-1 against CSKA Sofia in Bulgaria with two goals from Fernando Morientes after Djibril Cisse scored the first in 26th minute. 

Morientes increased the lead just after the half-hour mark with a header from a free-kick by captain Steven Gerrard, who laid on all three Liverpool goals. 

Morientes restored Liverpools two-goal advantage in 58th minute after Velizar Dimitrov had pulled one back for Sofia in first half stoppage time. (Reuters)

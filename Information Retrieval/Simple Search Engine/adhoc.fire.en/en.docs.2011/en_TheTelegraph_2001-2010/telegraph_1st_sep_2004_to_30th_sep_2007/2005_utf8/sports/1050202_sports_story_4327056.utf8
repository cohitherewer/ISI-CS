 Gavaskar, Dhoni fashion East win 

 - Deodhar Trophy 

 Rohan Gavaskar (89) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (87) played blistering knocks 

Rajkot: Former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar and wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni and played blistering knocks of 89 and 87, respectively, to steer East Zone to a four-wicket win over Central Zone in a high-scoring tie in the Deodhar Trophy limited overs league tournament on Tuesday. 

Dhoni smashed the ball around to hit 13 fours and a six in his 68-ball blitz. 

Rohan (unbeaten 89 off 79 balls with nine fours and a six) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (60 in 58 balls with six fours) chipped in nicely as east successfully overhauled Central?s tall score with an over to spare by making 348 for six. 

Earlier, Central?s Suresh Raina and Abbas Ali cracked centuries after skipper Mohammed Kaif won the toss and chose to bat first and guided their side to an imposing 346 for eight in 50 overs. 

The two batsmen rescued central after they lost three wickets, including that of Kaif (14), within the first ten overs with a double century stand for the fourth wicket which was worth exactly 200 runs and in 179 balls. 

Rana struck four sixes and 14 fours in his 104-ball 129, while Ali made 100 off 103 balls with 12 fours and one six. J. P. Yadav (43) and Jyoti Yadav (22) provided useful contributions in the end.

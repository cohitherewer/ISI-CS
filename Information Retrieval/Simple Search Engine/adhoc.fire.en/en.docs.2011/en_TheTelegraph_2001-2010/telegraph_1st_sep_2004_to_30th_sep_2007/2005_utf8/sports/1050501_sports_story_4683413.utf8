Jaipur: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi were not at their best but were still good enough to clinch the doubles rubber and carry India to the Davis Cup World Group play-off round. 

The former world No. 1 duo laboured to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Uzbekistan?s Murad Inoyatov and Denis Istomin at the Jai Club on Saturday giving India an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the Asia-Oceania group I second-round tie. 

Luckily for Paes and Bhupathi, the Uzbek pair struggled to come to terms with the grasscourt and never really posed a serious challenge. 

The visitors had their moments when they pounced on Bhupathi?s serve in the fourth game of the second set as the three-time Grand Slam champions seemed to take the foot off the accelerator after bagging set I. 

But the Indians broke back immediately and although the third set saw Inoyatov and Istomin coming up with some solid serves and booming returns, Paes and Bhupathi knew what needed to be done to close out the match and the tie. 

?We certainly did not play our best tennis,? Paes said later. ?The opponents were not that highly experienced? It was smooth sailing, just like another day in the office.? 

It was Paes? 74th Cup win, the Indian captain joining Brazilian Tomas Koch?s at joint eighth position in the all-time list. He is four wins short of Ramanathan Krishnan?s Indian record of 50 singles wins. 

Will he be in a dilemma when he decides on who plays Sunday?s dead reverse singles? ?Harsh (Mankad) is ready to play? but of course the record is in mind. If history is to be made, I?d like to be part of it.? 

The captain has a responsibility to the team but it is also my prerogative to rewrite history books. ?The record is not something modern players can think of. Davis Cup is my special stage,? he said. 

The Indians got an early break when Istomin served four double faults, including three on the trot, in the second game. Paes? serve came under pressure in the sixth game when he was forced to save three break-points before the first set was taken in 29 minutes. With the bounce getting even, Istomin fired some fine forehand returns from the baseline as the Uzbeks kept pace with the Indians in the second set. 

Inoyatov dropped serve in the third game with a double-fault but the visitors immediately neutralised by breaking Bhupathi?s serve. Istomin saved two break-points in the fifth game before Paes and Bhupathi got the vital breakthrough in the seventh game capturing Inoyatov?s serve. 

Inoyatov and Istomin put up some fight in the third set as well, the latter again saving three break-points. 

The Indians were looking like dead men walking, playing mostly from memory. But sheer experience carried them through. (PTI)

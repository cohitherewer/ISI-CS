 - Sharapova takes on Mauresmo

Los Angeles: Frances Mary Pierce took down compatriot Amelie Mauresmo 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 in their last group match on Friday to complete the semi-final line-up at the WTA Championships. 

With the victory, Pierce won the round robin Black Group and now plays top-ranked Lindsay Davenport, who finished second in the Green Group behind defending champion Maria Sharapova. 

Mauresmo will face Sharapova, who won her group by defeating Davenport on Thursday. 

But on Friday, an exhausted Sharapova showed none of her stellar form, going down quickly to Nadia Petrova 6-1, 6-2. 

Sharapova said the winner of the event would be the player who can gut it out after a long season. 

This is the kind of tournament where all the soldiers are down, and its whoever can get up (will win), she said. I cant sleep. Throughout the day Im like a walking zombie. 

The 30-year old Pierce finished her group with a 3-0 record, after earlier victories over Kim Clijsters and Elena Dementieva. 

Although both Pierce and Mauresmo have already qualified for the semi-finals, they contested a hard-fought match, with Mauresmo mixing serve-and-volley tactics and Pierce hammering her countrywoman from inside the baseline. 

Mauresmo had Pierce back on her heels during the first set, but in the final two sets Pierce served extremely well, passed with efficiency and took apart Mauresmos backhand. 

Pierce broke twice in the third set. She broke to 3-1 when Mauresmo missed a backhand volley and then again to win the contest on her third match point when Mauresmo missed a forehand. 

These kind of matches are tough to play, said Mauresmo. I still had the opportunity to win, but after I lost the second set, it was tough to keep up the intensity in the third. 

Since we were both in, you dont want to push yourself too much, she added. 

It was only the second time that France has had two WTA Championships semi-finalists, the other time being in 1997. (Reuters)

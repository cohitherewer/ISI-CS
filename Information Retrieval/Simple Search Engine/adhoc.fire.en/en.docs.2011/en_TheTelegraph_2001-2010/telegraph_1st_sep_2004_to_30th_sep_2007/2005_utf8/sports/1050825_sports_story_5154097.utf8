 Trent Bridge set to host mother of all Ashes battles

Nottingham: Expect a sharp drop in industrial productivity in England and Australia this week, in boardrooms as well as on the shop floor. 

Expect a rise in English absenteeism and a dozy workforce Down Under, with all ears glued to radios and eyes fixed on television screens. 

The fourth Ashes Test at Trent Bridge, starting on Thursday, could be the most important cricketing confrontation between the two nations since 1989. 

England have surprised the pundits, their opponents and themselves in making all the running in the last two Tests and levelling the series at 1-1. Despite that, they cannot afford to lose in Nottingham. 

Defeat would mean a drawn series at best and allow Australia to retain what they have hogged for 16 years. 

Englands pugnacious brand of cricket has suggested a long-awaited toppling of the world order yet Australia remain in the contest, however punch-drunk. 

Home captain Michael Vaughan must demand a knockout blow from his battery of fast bowlers at Trent Bridge. 

Barring unforeseen mishaps, he will be accompanied by the same players who stole victory from defeat at Edgbaston to level the series before Australia, equally thrillingly, turned a losing position into a gritty draw at Old Trafford. 

Australia will certainly make one change, axing out-of-form paceman Jason Gillespie and giving tearaway Shaun Tait his maiden cap. 

Glenn McGrath has an elbow problem, but Australia are cautiously optimistic that the experienced opening bowler will play the crucial Test. 

Michael Kasprowicz is on standby, but there is a good chance Glenn will be okay, captain Ricky Ponting said on Wednesday. 

McGrath, who missed the second Test with an ankle injury and was only half-fit in the third, complained of pain in his right elbow after training at Trent Bridge on Tuesday. 

Basically its swelling, the joint is irritable, Australia physiotherapist Errol Alcott said of McGraths latest problem. We would like more time but we are confident he is responding to treatment. 

England, beset by one injury after another (Andrew Flintoff did not get on the pitch and Simon Jones lasted one session), were lampooned in Australia as the most physically and mentally brittle bunch of losers ever to show up Down Under. 

Mockery, of course, is the preserve of undisputed world champions. 

In 2005, however, the Australians have spent more time anxiously studying their navels. Adam Gilchrists lack of dazzle has been as perplexing as Matthew Haydens shortage of runs. 

Former captain Ian Chappell has suggested the side may not be quite as good as they imagined, having spent so many years subsidised by the twin genius of Shane Warne and McGrath. Dennis Lillee has talked of an ageing team in decline. 

England, in this serries, have stayed remarkably fit and with the same 11 that began the series. In their last home series, they used 19 players. 

Trent Bridge, though, is not one of Englands favourite Ashes haunts with only three wins there in 19 Tests. In 1997 and 2001, Australia wrapped up the series in Robin Hood country. The last English champagne was uncorked in 1977. 

But Vaughans side, inspired by Flintoff, Jones and Steve Harmisons pace bowling, have been ripping up history books for 18 months. And, for all Warnes verbal spin, Ponting may be feeling the pressure as well. 

His leadership has come under criticism and it must have crossed his mind that he could go down in history as the captain who relinquished the Ashes. 

Vaughan, for his part, has certainly not betrayed much angst during the campaign, concentrating on enjoyment and leaving others to make the predictions. 

McGraths forecast of a 5-0 whitewash has been consigned to the cricketing dustbin. It did not seem that rash a statement at the start of the tour but seems risible now. 

Talking of risible forecasts, many tried to muffle their laughter when Englands selectors announced a few years ago they planned to be the worlds best side by 2007. 

Victory at Trent Bridge would replace any remaining chuckles with a widespread belief that those selectors, as well as Lillee, may yet be proved right. 

LIKELY TEAMS 

England: Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan (captain), Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Steve Harmison, Simon Jones, Matthew Hoggard. 

Australia: Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting (captain), Damien Martyn, Michael Clarke, Simon Kattich, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath/Michael Kasprowicz, Shaun Tait.

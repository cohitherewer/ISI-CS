Auckland: Australia thumped New Zealand by nine wickets to win the third and final Test with a day to spare and clinch the three-match series 2-0. 

Set 164 to win, Australia raced home in the 30th over with captain Ricky Ponting smashing an unbeaten 86 at better than a run a ball and opener Justin Langer scoring 59 not out. 

?I wanted to get the game over and done with,? Man-of-the-Match Ponting explained. ?I didn?t want to wait and see what the weather was going to be like tomorrow.? 

The Australians got the runs in less than a session after mopping up the New Zealand second innings at tea with paceman Glenn McGrath left stranded on 499 Test wickets and New Zealand left licking their wounds. 

?Get the ice packs out because the guys have been pretty beaten up,? said New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming. 

?We have to try and salvage the positives to come out of a series like this. 

?The last time they were out here, they played extremely well but we came away a better side and had a good period for a couple of years.? 

McGrath took four for 40 in the innings but will have to wait until the first Ashes Test at Lord?s before he can join Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralidharan and Courtney Walsh in the exclusive 500-club. 

Warne also captured four wickets on Tuesday as the Black Caps collapsed in two sessions despite defiant half-centuries from Nathan Astle and Daniel Vettori. 

Astle top-scored with 69, sharing a 70-run partnership with Lou Vincent, and then an 81-stand with Vettori. The left-arm spinner scored 65 for a batting average of 66 in the series. 

New Zealand started the day on 11 for two and needed to make 91 to force Australia to bat a second time but they lost Fleming for three and Hamish Marshall for seven in the first half hour. 

Fleming completed a miserable series with the bat when he hit a return catch to Jason Gillespie. Then Marshall became McGrath?s 498th victim when he nicked the ball to Adam Gilchrist, who was named Man of the Series after scoring 343 runs at 171.5. 

Vincent struck four boundaries and two sixes before a brilliant throw from Michael Clarke ended his cameo. Warne captured the next four wickets, denying McGrath the chance to reach his target. 

Australia, who won the first Test in Christchurch by nine wickets and then drew the second in Wellington after rain washed out most of the match, suffered an early setback in their run-chase when Matthew Hayden was run out by Vettori for nine. 

But Ponting and Langer made sure of the result with an unbroken partnership of 148, Ponting slamming 11 fours and two sixes while Langer hit 10 boundaries. 

?I was a bit surprised at the way they were really trying to slow things down,? Ponting said. ?They were hoping to sneak through tonight and hope it rained all day tomorrow.? (Reuters)

 No catching Aperitivo 

 STAR RACER

 When Aperitivo won the Calcutta Gold Cup last Saturday, he proved that there were no peers in RCTC to match his credentials in the highest set-up and over all distances. His outstation records since winning the Calcutta Derby, early in the year, have also been equally impressive. It may not, therefore, come as a surprise if the Vijay Singh-trainee remains unconquered in the city and also in the countrys other plum events during the winter season.

 Formal Invitation has had the misfortune of playing brides maid to Aperitivo whenever they clashed since the Derby. The story was no different on this occasion, the verdict between them was the closest ? a long-neck, albeit a with a 10kg pull at the weights. However, C. Alford, who partnered Aperitivo, had something in reserve.

 Vijay and Alford combined to dash opposition hopes in the Elusive Pimpernel Cup when Romantic Fire produced a brilliant gallop from the start and carried his topweight to a smashing victory. The 6-4 favourite was also taking on seasoned outstation campaigners like Gaslight and Saratoga Sizzle and finished in the order named.

 The trainer-jockey combo of Daniel David-P.S. Chauhan and Javed Khan-M. Mark, otherwise dominated the afternoon.

 The later combination, in particular, was a treat to watch as the apprentice snatched his two less-fancied winners ? Local Thriller and Actuary ? from jaws of defeat. While Local Thriller caught a heavily-backed Falcon Fly (Chauhan) napping when in total command during the closing stages of the race,Actuarys victory over the Mark Gallagher-ridden Bollywood Dreams was a result of forceful riding.

 Visibly shaken, Chauhan took no chances on his other rides. His Star Phoenix delivered the goods with a degree of comfort in the 1,600m Avalanche Star and the Dont Forget Me-Dramatic Irony-son, a half-brother of Aperitivo, may strike again. Chauhans next ride, Amber Glory, in the baby race, the 1,100m Revelation Plate, proved speedier than Vijays hot-favourite, Watergate, and the late-finishing Chitralekha from Javeds yard.

 Chauhan displayed no complacency while partnering Talent Unlimited to victory on Vijays strongly-fancied debutante Drop Dead Gorgeous in the 1,400m Flamenco Dancer Cup. Striding in close proximity of the Gorgeous till 100m from home, Chauhan had the measure of the inexperienced runner.

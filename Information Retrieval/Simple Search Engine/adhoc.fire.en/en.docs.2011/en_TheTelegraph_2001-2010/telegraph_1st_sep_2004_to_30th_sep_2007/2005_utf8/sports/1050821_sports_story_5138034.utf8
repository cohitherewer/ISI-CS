The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Negotiating the left turns will be challenging

 - Istanbul circuit is one of three which runs anti-clockwise

The Istanbul circuit is one of three which runs anticlockwise, with Brazil and San Marino being the other two. Driving in such a circuit means a lot of pressure is exerted on the neck muscles since we drivers are not used to making so many left turns at the corners. 

Turkey, staging its first-ever Formula One race, has a new-generation circuit at the Istanbul Park. It has excellent spectator facilities. 

The circuit is very challenging and also a bit slippery. One very interesting characteristic of this circuit is that there is a lot of elevation-change in the course of the lap. 

The track is built on four different ground levels. Turn VIII is a very demanding and challenging corner, which requires a lot of commitment. 

It was slightly overcast on Friday during the practice session, but on Saturday it was clear, with the temperature rising, and we can expect the same for raceday. It will definitely be one of the more demanding races of the season. 

Turkey is a really nice place and I have been really impressed by this country. There is a lot of excitement and buzz throughout Istanbul this weekend. 

The whole city seems to be geared up for this event. Its a vibrant city and I am sure the grandstand will be choc-a-bloc on Sunday. 

My practice sessions on Friday was hampered slightly by a gearbox problem but we still managed to do some important laps to get accustomed. The track was a bit dusty during the first practice session, but as more and more cars went through their the laps, it seemed to get better for the second session. 

In my three weeks off between Hungary and Turkey, I had the time to travel to India. Its always nice to come home. 

I was returning after a long time, so I was very busy with all my sponsorship commitments. 

I was running around from one place to another and was always on the move even in India. I was also very happy with the response I got from the media. 

I was very happy with my last outing in Hungary. We ran a consistent race and I finished 12th, ahead of my teammate. I wasnt too comfortable all weekend in Hungary but we managed to put a great show on raceday to bring both the cars home and that, too, in strong positions. 

With Raikkonen scoring maximum points in Hungary and Alonso none, Sundays race will prove very important in context of the world championship.

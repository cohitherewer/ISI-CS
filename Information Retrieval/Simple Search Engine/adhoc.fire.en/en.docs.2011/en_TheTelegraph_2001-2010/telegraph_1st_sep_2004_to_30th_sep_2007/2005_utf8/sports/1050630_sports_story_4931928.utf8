 Truant teams guilty, face huge fines

Paris: With the FIA admitting that tyre maker Michelin were out of bounds because of no contractual binding with the world body, it found the seven teams using such tyres and who failed to start the US Grand Prix in Indianapolis guilty on two of five charges they faced at a hearing on Wednesday. 

They were cleared of the other three. The FIA said they had decided to adjourn discussion of any penalties until an EGM on September 14. 

The teams were found guilty of failing to ensure they were in possession of suitable tyres for the June 19 Grand Prix but with strong mitigating circumstances. FIA boss Max Moseley said the world body, though, could impose a series of enormous fines on the teams with which to compensate fans. 

The seven ? Renault, McLaren, Williams, Toyota, Red Bull, Sauber and BAR ? were also found guilty by the world governing body of wrongfully refusing to allow their cars to start the race. 

They were cleared of refusing to race subject to a speed restriction, combining to make a demonstration and failing to inform the stewards of their intention not to start. 

Michelin, whose failure to provide appropriate tyres for the track conditions to the seven teams which led to the boycott on safety grounds, will not be subject to any sanctions. 

We cant impose a penalty on Michelin, Mosley said. They have no more of a relationship with us than any other team supplier. We have no power over them.

 Italian cyclist in drugs net

 Dario Frigo has been detained by the French police 

Courchevel (France): French police have taken Italian rider Dario Frigo in for questioning after finding performance-enhancing drugs in a car driven by his wife at the Tour de France, his team said on Wednesday. 

A police source said Frigo, 31, had been detained before Wednesdays 11th stage of the race in the French Alps. 

The source said the riders wife had been arrested by French customs on Monday near the French Alps town of Albertville after some 10 vials were found in the boot of her car. The vials were being analysed at a laboratory near Lyon. 

A spokesman for Frigos Fassa Bortolo team confirmed the arrest, saying: The gendarmes came at 0730 (0530 GMT), arrested him and held him for questioning. It is a case which concerns only Dario Frigo and not the team. 

Frigo was excluded from the Giro DItalia and banned for nine months in 2001 after drugs were found in his hotel room during a police raid. 

Wednesdays incident recalls the events of 2002 when the wife of Lithuanian rider Raimondas Rumsas was arrested by French customs officers with drugs in her car on the day her husband finished third in Tour de France. 

Rumsas and his wife will go on trial in November in France. This is not the same as the Rumsas case, a source close to the Frigo investigation said. We havent found as much drugs. 

Tour de France executive director Jean-Marie Leblanc said he did not know which drugs were found. 

We deeply regret this case which concerns a rider who has already had brushes with the police and the sports authorities, said Leblanc. 

He belongs to a generation of riders who just wont learn. (Reuters)

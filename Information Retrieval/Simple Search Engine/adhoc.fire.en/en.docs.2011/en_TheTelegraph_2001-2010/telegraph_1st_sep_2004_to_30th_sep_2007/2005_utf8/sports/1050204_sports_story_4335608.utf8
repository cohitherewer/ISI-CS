The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ponting backs off-form Hayden 

Melbourne: With Inzamam-ul Haq enjoying a big slice of fortune, thanks to Match Referee Chris Broad?s oversight, the Pakistan skipper is poised to carry his good form with the bat into the first tri-series finals game at the MCG on Friday. 

Pakistan qualified for the best-of-three finals after two successive wins over Australia and the West Indies. The skipper, who should have been suspended for time-wasting, struck four half-centuries in the six pool matches. 

On the Australian front, there is a great deal of speculation about who will partner Adam Gilchrist following Matthew Hayden?s recent poor form. 

Ponting was adamant Hayden should be continued with, ahead of rising star Michael Clarke ? who has stood in with enormous success ? but said it would be up to the selectors to decide. 

?It?s going to be a tough selection and as far as I?m concerned, Matthew is our best opener when he?s at his best,? Ponting said. 

?Quite often there are really tough selections around this team, I think it?s only fair that selectors make those calls. 

?I?ll get my point across to the team that I want to have, but if there?s something that the other four selectors see differently, then they?ll make that call.? 

There is another tricky selection issue for the Aussies with three bowlers competing for two spots. Pacers Michael Kasprowicz and Brett Lee are both vying for a start, as is left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg. 

Although he took five for 32 in his last ODI at the MCG, forecast thunderstorms could count against Hogg. 

?If it?s going to be a rain-affected game, it?s generally pretty hard for leg-spinners to hold the ball or spinners of any sort to grip the ball,? Ponting said. 

The elements prevented either side from getting a net session at the MCG, but despite 120mm of rain falling at the ground Wednesday night, the new drainage system ? installed late last year ? meant the wicket and outfield are in good condition. (AFP)

 We need to pull up our socks: Bhowmick

 - NATIONAL LEAGUE 

- Churchill Brothers upbeat ahead of big tie 

 Yusif Yakubu is the main threat, feels East Bengal coach 

Margao: Victory will be the first thing on their minds when Churchill Brothers and East Bengal meet each other in the third round of the National Football League here Sunday. 

That is one thing they are yet to get, despite having gone through two matches already. When they drew their opener versus Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said he wasn?t interested in victory so early in the league. Having gone through another deadlock, things may have changed now for Bhowmick. 

It is worse for Churchill. Having earned a point off their draw with Mahindra United, they conceded a match to Tollygunge Agragami 1-2. And injuries to their James Singh and Venancio Gonsalves did not help. 

Churchill coach Shabbir Ali, though, is sounding positive. ?The defeat to Tollygunge is a thing of the past, as we get back to the crunch match with East Bengal,? he said. 

The Churchill attitude was understandable. Even when reduced to ten men in the second half versus Tollygunge, they controlled the game, though they found goals hard to come by. ?The boys realise their mistakes now and hope to do things differently from the last game, Shabbir said. ?We are now facing a game that will draw all attention, expecting us to win. 

?East Bengal are a strong side, but so are we,? said Churchill?s Yusif Yakubu. ?We can?t afford to stay depressed with the past. We have to play our own game as well as we can. We need to play with personality. I have not got into the scoring sheet and have reserved my best for tomorrow,? he said. 

The lion-hearted display by debutante Fransa has sent a clear message to Bhowmick on what is in store for them from the Goan club. ?They (East Bengal players) will have to pull up their socks and give their best tomorrow where Yakubu will be the main threat for them,? Bhowmick said, adding, ?Yakubu is one of the best foreigners I have seen playing in India in recent times.? 

East Bengal will be without Habibur Rahman Mondal, who is on two bookings, and Debjit Ghosh will be around instead. 

Even if the two draws were worrying him, Bhowmick did not show it. ?The NFL is a marathon where every team should remain consistent if they are to achieve results. We are always slow starters who like to compete when the contest hots up. Our main aim is not to lose but be content with one point and be happy if we win,? asserted Bhowmick.

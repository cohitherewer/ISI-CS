The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A boon for Australia

Ivo Tennant

A schedule of five Ashes Tests on the dry pitches of late summer, when Shane Warne would be able to make the ball grip, bite and turn, was always likely to favour Australia. So, too, was Englands decision to select a middle order of like-minded attacking batsmen without an experienced, compact, organised collector of runs. Without, in other words, Graham Thorpe. 

Before he announced his retirement from Tests on Friday, Thorpe had been informed by the selectors that he is now behind Rob Key, Ed Joyce and Paul Collingwood in the pecking order. It is not so much a harsh verdict as an insulting one. 

When Thorpe was left out of the side for this first Test, David Graveney, the chairman of selectors, said that the choice between him and Kevin Pietersen was the hardest selectorial judgement of his time in office. Now we are told Thorpe is not in the picture whatsoever. 

Pietersen deserved to play, of that there can be no doubt. He has enhanced his standing as an international cricketer through his batting in both innings of this match. The fact remains, though, that to select him, Ian Bell and Andrew Flintoff to go in after the out-of-touch Michael Vaughan smacks of a cavalier approach. 

Vaughan we know is a predominantly attacking strokemaker, but he is horribly out of form. 

In the modern era of helter-skelter batting, and with suggestions that Tests should be played over four days, Thorpe and his ilk are regarded almost as dinosaurs. There is scant room, it would seem, for the old-fashioned accumulator, although Indias Rahul Dravid has proved the continuing worth of a tight technique. 

What is to be done? Vaughan will not be dropped and neither, surely, will Bell. Pietersens place is secure, as is Flintoffs. The opening pairing will not change. All of which may well be to Australias continuing advantage.

 BCCI game for Test in Karachi

Karachi: The BCCI has expressed willingness to play a Test and one-day International in Karachi during Indians tour of Pakistan next year. 

A senior PCB official said the BCCI has also asked for an additional three-day practice match in Karachi after the proposed itinerary, sent last week, included only a Test and an ODI. 

Since 2000, when England beat Pakistan in near darkness, only Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have played Tests in Karachi while South Africa, India and England refused to play the longer version of the game in the port city. India played an ODI on their tour last year. 

We at the PCB think it is a major development in restoring the image of Karachi as a major cricket centre. The BCCI has lived up to its commitment of playing a Test in Karachi in 2006, said the official. 

The PCB official added that the BCCI has forwarded the itinerary to its foreign office. The BCCI has accepted the proposed itinerary but requires foreign office approval. 

The BCCI will send its security delegation most probably when England will be playing in Pakistan, the official informed. 

Besides Karachi, the Tests have been slotted in Lahore and Multan, while the ODIs have been proposed in Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Lahore and Karachi.

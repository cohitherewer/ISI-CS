 PCA defends Yuvraj

 Yuvraj Singh 

Mohali: The Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) defended its star batsman, Yuvraj Singh, on Saturday following his comments on the Sourav-Chappell episode, saying it was upto the cricket board to take measures to prevent players from making such remarks. 

Bindra did not clarify if PCA would summon Yuvraj, like it had done in Harbhajan Singhs case, but said we will definitely ask him about his comments. 

The comments (by players) have become order of the day. Norms are meant to be observed, but the board has to ensure their strict enforcement, Bindra said. 

Bindras comments came a day after BCCI secretary SK Nair took objection to Yuvrajs remark, saying he had breached the boards gag order. 

Yuvraj had said the row between skipper Sourav Ganguly and coach Greg Chappell was disappoin- ting but the team should move ahead. 

PCA had earlier summoned Harbhajan following his outburst against Chappell and advised him to have a word with the association rather than rushing to the media. (PTI)

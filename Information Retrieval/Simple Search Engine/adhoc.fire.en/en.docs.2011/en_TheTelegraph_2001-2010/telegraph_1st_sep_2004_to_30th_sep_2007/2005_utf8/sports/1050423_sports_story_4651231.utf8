 HONKY DORY

 Antia

 With just four meetings to go, the battle for the jockeys? championship is hotting up between C. Rajendra, who heads the table with two points, and Mallesh Narredu. The season ends on May 1, but a clear picture may emerge over the weekend. The two jockeys are expected to dominate Saturday?s seven-event race card. Nevertheless, trainer Hormuz Antia?s Hot Tin Roof may dash the hopes of Rajendra and Mallesh in the afternoon main event, the 1,000m P.D.Bolton Trophy. P.S.Chauhan partners the Portroe-Tin Roof colt.

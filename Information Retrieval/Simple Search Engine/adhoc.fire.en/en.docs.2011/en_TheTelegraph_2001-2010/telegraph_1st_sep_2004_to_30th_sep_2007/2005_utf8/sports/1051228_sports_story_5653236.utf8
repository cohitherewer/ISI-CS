 Inzy amp; Co. favourites, says Imran

Islamabad: Legendary allrounder Imran Khan has termed Pakistan as favourites to win the upcoming three-Test series against arch-rivals India. 

Hailing current captain Inzamam-ul Haq and speedster Shoaib Akhtar as a match-winning pair, Imran said the timing and weather would also help the Pakistani fast bowlers. The last time when India visited it was summer (April) and now it is winter (January), which will benefit our bowlers, the former left-arm paceman was quoted as saying by a local daily on Tuesday. 

On the issue of Karachi hosting a Test between the arch-rivals, he said India must play in the port city since the successful conduct of a one-dayer against England recently had proved that conditions there were quite satisfactory. 

Meanwhile, fast bowler Umar Gul was Tuesday named in a 12-member Pakistan A squad to face India in the three-day tour opener in Lahore from January 7 to 9.

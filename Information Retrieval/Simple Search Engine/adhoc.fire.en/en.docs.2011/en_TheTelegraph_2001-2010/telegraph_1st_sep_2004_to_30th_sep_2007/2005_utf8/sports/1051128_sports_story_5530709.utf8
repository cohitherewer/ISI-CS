The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We should finish among top-three in Chennai

Stickwork

 Gurbux Singh 

 Much will depend on Sandeep rsquo;s penalty corner conversion

All players ? who have made it to the final list of 25 for the Champions Trophy ? are in good shape. The nucleus of the team is known; its the same old faces that have done duty for the country in recent times. I think they should do well in the big tournament. 

The Champions Trophy,to be played in Chennai, is a round robin meet and it is important the players perform to the optimum right from the beginning. Dont forget that the worlds best teams will be participating here. 

Australia have announced a full-strength squad and it only goes to vindicating the fact that they are not in any experimental mode. 

There is no gainsaying the fact that all teams are preparing for the next big events in 2006 and 2007 and so, they are focussing on the Champions Trophy with more importance than usual. 

One significant aspect about Indias build-up to the tournament is that most of the players have been concentrating on training for the sole purpose of the Champions Trophy. 

The Indian Hockey Federation has postponed all local meets till the conclusion of the tournament. Players, thus, should not complain about being over-trained and tired when the meet gets underway on December 10. So the boys should be raring to go. 

If Raj Pal gets fit in time and Gagan Ajit Singh and Prabhjot Singh use the flanks to their potential, India can be a danger to the rest. Much will, however, depend on Sandeep Singh as far as penalty corners are concerned. I dont mind if Sandeep takes the field as a forward if theres no place for him as a defender in the starting line-up. 

But worry still remains about the midfield, which mainly depends on Vikram Pillay, Viren Rasquinha, Ignace Tirkey and a few youngsters like Bimal Lakra and Nitin Kumar. 

Todays hockey is much like football. Its the midfield that helps the team win or lose a match. Despite all this, my view is we should finish in the top three and if we achieve that well be on the right track. 

One question, however, may arise as to whether we should try out youngsters in the Champions Trophy, and I do not favour such an idea. The Champions Trophy is No. 3 after the Olympics and World Cup. And being the hosts, there shouldnt be any time for experimentation and I feel we have to put up the best team. 

After the meet, well, we can take a cue from cricket. I believe cricket is on the right path with its focus on grooming youngsters ahead of the 2007 World Cup. 

Similarly, we need to try out youngsters and see how gritty and strong they can be in international arena. A process to this effect should put in gear immediately after the Champions Trophy. If we can groom 10-15 players in this way, nothing can better serve Indian hockey. 

Lets shift our focus to the next edition of the Professional Hockey League. Its going to take place in Chandigarh in January. Pakistan will send eight players to the tournament including Rehan Butt, Mohammed Shabbir and their new penalty-corner specialist Imran Warsi. 

The timing of the meet, however, is a bit tricky since Chandigarh will be facing a severely cold weather and everybody feels this is not the right time to hold the meet there. 

Unfortunately, the Bengal Tigers will be not be taking part and the players will be assimilated into a Rourkela outfit. Its a pity that Bengal, having no astroturf, have to suffer like this. I again appeal to the powers-that-be in Bengal to allot a piece of land so that hockey does not suffer nonchalance and negligence. 

Many people dont know that Bengal have qualified for the National Games despite having no astroturf. Only eight teams have managed to qualify for the Games. It is hockey and hockey alone that brought glory to Indian and Bengal. Bengal players won 27 Olympic gold medals, one silver and five bronzes. Tell me, which other game in Bengal has brought so much glory to the state? 

I would like to appeal the chief minister to give us a piece of land so that an astroturf field can be laid and our pride in hockey be restored. 

Once we have this facility, we can shift our oldest meet ? the Beighton Cup ? there. We can also attach more international colour to the meet and explore the option of staging it in winter. 

I dont know how long we have to suffer before our wait for a ground comes to end.

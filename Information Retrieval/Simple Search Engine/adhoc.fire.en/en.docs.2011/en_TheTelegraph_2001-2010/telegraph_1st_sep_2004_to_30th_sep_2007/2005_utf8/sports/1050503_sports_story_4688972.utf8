 Anju wants to break into world?s top three

Bangalore: Anju Bobby George has set three goals for the new season which she kicks off by competing in the opener, the Doha Super Grand Prix on May 13. 

Anju, the first Indian to win a world championship medal, wants to break into the top-3 of world rankings, win another medal at the world meet and achieve seven metre-plus jumps consistently in international meets. 

The Kerala athlete will also be taking part in the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene (US) in early June, the Asian Grand Prix series in Singapore, Malaysia and Bangkok, and then the European circuit events. 

For the first time, she will also be taking part in the Asian championship. 

?It?s going to be a long season? I am planning to take part in 20-24 international meets culminating with the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next year,? Anju said in an interview. 

?The Helsinki world championship in August is the main focus,? the 28-year-old said. 

?I am not only looking forward to defending the (bronze) medal, but also to improve on that,? said Anju, currently world No. 6 in her event. 

Husband and coach Bobby George, a former triple-jumper, said: ?She can do much better than 6.83 metres, which is her personal competition best. She has crossed seven metres in training last year. 

?She is going to cross seven metres a few times this year,? remarked George. He explained that the focus of training this time had been on consistency and ?energy distribution on the approach? as the effort would be to see that Anju places her foot exactly on the board, does not lose ?measuring distance? and commit fouls. 

?I feel she has improved her speed,? he said, adding that training pattern had been designed in such a fashion that Anju peaks by early August. 

Anju, who has been among the top-ten in the world since August 2003, said: ?If I peak early, it will affect my performance at the world championship.? 

 Anju, the Asian Games gold-medallist and Commonwealth Games bronze-medallist, said that for European meets, they may consider London as the training base for a brief period. 

Anju refused to speculate on how many more years she would compete at the top level. ?Right now I am enjoying training and competing. Bobby is enjoying the role of a coach. Until I feel it?s enough, I will keep at it.? 

She signed off on a dismal tone, saying that right now there was no good long-jumper in the country to whom she could pass on the baton. (PTI)

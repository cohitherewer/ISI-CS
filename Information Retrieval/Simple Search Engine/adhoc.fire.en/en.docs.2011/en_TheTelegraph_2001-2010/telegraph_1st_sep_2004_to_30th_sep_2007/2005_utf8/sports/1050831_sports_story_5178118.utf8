Calcutta: Having come through a tight three-setter against local girl Mashona Washington, the draw has suddenly opened up for Sania Mirza. She would have had to face Marat Safins sister Dinara Safina, but the 21st seed from Russia bowed to little-known Italian Maria Elena Camerin on Monday. 

But, the Sania camp is not counting the chickens before they are hatched. 

Yeah, it looks a good draw. But womens tennis has become so competitive that everything boils down to the form of the day? anyone can get the better of a higher-ranked opponent any given day, as we saw in the case of (defending champion) Svetlana Kuznetsova, Sanias coach John Farrington told The Telegraph from his hotel room on Tuesday morning (New York time). 

Neither Sania nor her coach has any idea of how Camerin, ranked No. 81 in the world, plays. I am trying to get some information? but Ive told Sania to concentrate on her strengths and not worry too much about her rival, Farrington said. 

If the Indian teenager can get through the next two rounds, a potential clash with Maria Sharapova looms. I know it, but right now we are focusing on our next match only, said Farrington, adding that he is very satisfied with Sanias ability to put in 110 per cent every match, whatever the odds. 

On Monday afternoon, for example, Sania had problems with a stomach muscle. She strained it just before the French Open, it showed up again in Cincinnati (earlier this month). Shes aware of it, so her serves are getting affected, Farrington said. 

The 42nd-ranked Hyderabad girl is getting ultrasound treatment, along with icing and taping. We have to make sure it doesnt flare up, said her coach. 

Delighted to see his ward clear the first hurdle, Farrington felt tennis wasnt of the highest quality as both players were a little nervous. But Sania handled the pressure very well. 

Stomach problem or not, Farrington is upbeat about Sanias prospects at the Open. Shes very positive as always, very competitive as well. If she can play to her potential, she can go far?

Gros Islet (St Lucia): A majestic hundred from Chris Gayle failed to stop Pakistan from sweeping the one-day series against West Indies 3-0 on Sunday. 

Gayle made a well-constructed 124 but West Indies fell 22 runs short of an imposing Pakistan total of 303 for six in the final game of the three-match series. 

The home side were bowled out for 281 in 49.3 overs, seamer Abdul Razzaq finishing with figures of four for 45. 

It was Razzaqs second fourth-wicket haul of the series but Gayle gave the home supporters something to cheer about with his 11th hundred in hot and humid conditions. 

Gayle kept the home team in touch with the victory target but his dismissal off the first ball of the 46th over sparked a lower-order collapse as West Indies lost their last four wickets for just 31 runs. 

West Indies suffered their second successive one-day clean sweep following a 5-0 drubbing by South Africa and have lost 12 of their last 13 limited-overs Internationals since winning the ICC Champions Trophy in England last September. 

Sundays loss was West Indies ninth in a row, the longest losing streak in their history, while Pakistan have won their last seven matches. 

Gayles well-paced hundred, which included 13 fours, kept the home side in the hunt until the 46th over when he was caught in the covers by captain Younis Khan off Shabbir Ahmed, leaving West Indies to get 54 runs in 29 balls. 

Gayle did not get enough support from the other batsmen as Wavell Hinds (35), captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul (33) and Runako Morton (27) all failed to go on after solid starts. 

Earlier, Shahid Afridi smashed a sparkling 56 from just 30 balls, hitting six fours and two sixes in his 26th one-day half century as Pakistan made West Indies captain Chanderpaul rue his decision to field first. 

After Afridis fireworks, Yasir Hameed (41), Bazid Khan (66), Yousuf Youhana (50) and Younis (40) batted solidly and wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal smashed the last three balls of the innings from left-arm seamer Ian Bradshaw for six to lift Pakistan past 300.

 Randhawa improves to tied 42nd

St Andrews: Jyoti Randhawa shot an even par 72 at the Carnoustie on the second day of the Dunhill Links Championship, being simultaneously played on the Old Course at St. Andrews and at nearby Kingsbarns. 

Randhawa improved from tied 51st to tied 42nd at the midway stage, while compatriot Amandeep Johl shot an even par and moved up from tied 95th to tied 75th. 

Colin Montgomerie, who was second at the Old Course, St. Andrews, at the British Open this year, equalled the course record with a seven-under par 65 and stormed into lead. Johl is playing with Kapil Dev and together they have a better ball score of six-under 138 in tied 87th place.

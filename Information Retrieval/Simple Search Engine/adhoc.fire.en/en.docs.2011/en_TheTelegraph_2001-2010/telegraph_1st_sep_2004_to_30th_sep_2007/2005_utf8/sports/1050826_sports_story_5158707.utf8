 Sania makes last eight

 - Indian to face Roberta Vinci next 

 Sania beat Shahar Peer 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza celebrated winning the Arjuna Award with a victory over Shahar Peer of Israel in the first round of the $75,000 Forest Hills Womens Classic in New York. 

Third seed Sania, who has been troubled by a stomach strain, scored a 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 win over her 59th-ranked opponent to enter the quarter finals. 

Returning to the circuit after nearly a fortnights rest after her first-round loss in Los Angeles, Sania was a bit rusty as she dropped her serve in the fifth game. 

But she pulled up her socks in time to break back when Peer, who had beaten her in the final qualifying round of a WTA event last month, was serving for the set to level the scores 5-5. 

The 19-year old went on to clinch the tie-breaker without trouble and, once into the second set, she was in top gear. 

Sania will next play Roberta Vinci of Italy. 

Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Martin Damm, seeded second, were upset by the Israeli pair of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram in the doubles first round in New Haven. The second seeds lost 6-1, 1-6, 4-6.

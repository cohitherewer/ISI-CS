 Apprentices rule Day I 

 Star Racer

 Amandeep on Noble Flash

 Calcutta: Attendance was very thin on Thursday, the first day of the winter season, yet the totalisator did its usual business. Favourites, too, found the going tough but apprentices were on a high, winning four of the six events on the card. While Amandeep booted home two, including Noble Flash, who won the main event, the Rising Star Cup, M.Mark and Malcolm Maseyk picked up a win apiece. 

 Jockey C.Alford was expected to win on all the four favourites from Vijay Singhs stable but he could manage to drive home just two.

 Three other riders ? Md Yacoob, S. Tamang and apprentice Melvyn Maseyk were big losers on the day. They were handed suspensions varying between three and 17 weeks for unsatisfactory riding. Melvyn was hit the hardest and will sit out till March 11 next year.

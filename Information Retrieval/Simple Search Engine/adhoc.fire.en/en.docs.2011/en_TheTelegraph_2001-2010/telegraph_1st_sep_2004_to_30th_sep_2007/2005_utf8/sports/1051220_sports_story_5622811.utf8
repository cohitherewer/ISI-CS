The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 First-innings lead for Bengal

 - Sourashish grabs 6 wkts vs Karnataka 

 Sourashish was in fine form 

Mysore: Karnatakas batting woes continued as they were dismissed for 292 in their first innings to help get a vital 43-run first innings on the third day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match here on Monday. 

Replying to Bengals 335, Karnataka began on a promising note on Sunday but failed to maintain the tempo ?? on Monday?? as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Sourashish Lahiri wrecked the Karnataka batting as he picked up six wickets. 

The only solace for the hosts was a fine knock by Bharath Chipli who scored a gutsy 115 (15x4, 3x6) off 171 balls. 

Resuming at their overnight score of 117 for the loss of one wicket, Karnataka lost seven wickets in quick successions. 

Sunil Joshi with his 44 managed to stretch Karnatakas innings by defying Bengal bowlers for some time before he fell victim to Lahiri. 

Shib Shankar Paul and Shib Sagar Singh of Bengal shared two wickets each. 

In the second innings Bengal were 75 for no loss at close with openers Arindam Das on 33 and Subhmoy Das on 40.

San Luis: Viswanathan Anand and Russian Alexander Morozevich played out an exciting draw, while Bulgarian Veselin Topalov emerged as the new world champion after drawing with Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the 13th and penultimate round of the World Chess Championship. 

The draw by Anand meant that the Indian ace will now have to battle it out for second place against Russian Peter Svidler in a final-round showdown. 

Topalov emerged as the worthy winner with his sixth draw on the trot after he had raced to 6.5/7 in the first half. 

It was a difficult endgame against Kasimdzhanov that Topalov survived in the penultimate round game. 

As a matter of fact, there was no change in the standings after the 13th round as the remaining two games of the day also ended peacefully with Svidler taking it easy against Hungarian Judit Polgar and Briton Michael Adams settling for draw against Hungarian Peter Leko. 

With just a round to go, his rivals cannot catch Topalov, on 9.5 points, as he has a 1.5-point lead. Anand and Svidler remained joint second on 8. Morozevich is next on 6.5, while Kasimdzhanov and Leko shared fifth on 5.5. (PTI)

 Shabbir delays Aussie trip

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed has delayed plans to undergo remedial work on his bowling action in Australia. 

Instead, he is training with team coach Bob Woolmer to rectify the problem. 

Woolmer is confident his action can be improved. So we have postponed plans to send him to Australia, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf said on Wednesday. 

But if there is a need we can do it later. 

Shabbir was suspended from bowling last month after he was reported for his suspect action for the third time since 1999 during the first Test in the West Indies in May. 

With Shabbir unable to bowl again until the ICCs bowling action review committee clears his action, Pakistan are keen to resolve the problem before the home series against England begins on October 26. 

Tests carried out in England in June revealed the 29-year-old exceeds the ICC threshold of allowing bowlers 15 degrees elbow extension by more than eight degrees.

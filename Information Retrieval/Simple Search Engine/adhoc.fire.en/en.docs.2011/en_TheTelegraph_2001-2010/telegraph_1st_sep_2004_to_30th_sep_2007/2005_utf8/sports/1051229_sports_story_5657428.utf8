Pamplona (Spain): World junior champion P. Harikrishna settled for a draw with Georgian GM Izoria Zviad in Round V of 15th Ciudad de Pamplona International Chess Tournament here. 

The Indian was joined at the top by former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine who defeated GM Jan Timman of The Netherlands. 

On a day full of good contests, Dutch GM Sergei Tiviakov got the better of Andorran GM Oscar de la Riva Aguado to jump to joint third where he now has the company of Ivan Cheparinov, who drew with Laurent Fressinet of France in the fifth round. 

With only two rounds remaining, Harikrishna is sitting pretty with 3.5 points along with Ponomariov. (PTI)

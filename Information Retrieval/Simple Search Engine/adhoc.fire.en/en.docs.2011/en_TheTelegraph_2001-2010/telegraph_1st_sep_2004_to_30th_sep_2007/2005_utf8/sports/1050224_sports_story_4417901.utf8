 Injury scare for Hayden

 Shoulder injury a blow to Hayden 

Sydney: Opening batsman Matthew Hayden?s long-awaited return to form has taken a blow with a shoulder injury putting him in doubt for Saturday?s third one-day International against New Zealand, the team said on Wednesday. 

Hayden hurt his shoulder making a diving catch to dismiss Chris Cairns on Tuesday. 

Australia?s team physiotherapist, Alex Kountouri, said Hayden had a ?grade one? strain to his right shoulder joint and that his arm was in a sling to take pressure off the joint. ?At this stage there is a fair amount of swelling around the joint, so we will have a clearer picture as to how Matthew is progressing once that swelling subsides,? Kountouri said. 

?Whilst there is some doubt over his chances of playing in the third game, he certainly hasn?t been ruled out at this stage,? he said. 

 NZ recall Papps 

Meanwhile, opening batsman Michael Papps was recalled to the New Zealand squad on Wednesday for both the third and fourth ODIs, adds a report from Wellington. Papps, who has averaged 51 in his five previous ODIs, replaces Mathew Sinclair. (Agencies)

 Kumble: Im not 100 per cent fit 

Bangalore: Anil Kumble, who has been omitted from the Indian squad for the first two matches of the one-day series against Sri Lanka, on Saturday sounded optimistic about being back in action soon. 

I am not hundred per cent fit for the international series and I am under rehabilitation, he said. 

I have a slight niggle in the back. I am undergoing physiotherapy sessions and hope to be back in the field very soon, the spinner said. 

On Rahul Dravid being chosen as captain, Kumble said, he (Dravid) has been there for long, has proven himself. It is nice that he has been given the role of leading the country for a couple of series. 

On exclusion of Kumble, chairman of the selection committee Kiran More had said on Friday his fitness would be reviewed on October 18. 

The minor niggle had kept Kumble out of action from the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy in Mohali also.

 Long live the champion

 - Armstrongs incentive was to have his children see him retire wearing the yellow jersey

Paris: Lance Armstrong wouldnt cry. He whispered to his children ? son Luke and twin daughters Grace and Isabelle. He kissed his mother Linda, and hugged his rock star girlfriend Sheryl Crow, whose eyes did get wet behind her oversized sunglasses. 

With his Discovery Channel team director Johan Bruyneel, Armstrong shared a glass of champagne. Bruyneel held his with one hand while driving the team car with the other. Armstrong reached over to clink glasses while he rode his black bike with only his legs. 

Armstrong bit his lip when the US national anthem was played for him. In the background was the Arc de Triomphe. Rising in the distance was the Eiffel Tower. Armstrong wore a yellow jersey, the one that has come to symbolise so much for a 33-year-old Texan who always wanted to win. At cards, at rock throwing, in a bike race, over deadly cancer. 

Vive the Tour forever. Goodbye, were Armstrongs last official words to the French crowd at the Tour de France. Armstrong finalised his seventh consecutive Tour victory Sunday with a nervous ride into Paris on slippery, rain-slicked streets. With two more victories than any other cyclist in the 92nd edition of the worlds most famous race, Armstrong is now emphatically retired. Its absolutely final, he said. 

Armstrong concluded his 14-year professional career with a 89-mile ride from suburban Corbeil-Essonnes into Paris and for eight laps around the Champs-Elysees. The final result had all but been determined over three weeks of riding 2,242 miles in sun and rain, heat and chill, over mountain passes, switchback roads and winding paths past cows. 

He finished the three-week trip in 86 hours 15 minutes 2 seconds. That was 4:40 better than Italys 27-year-old Ivan Basso and 6:21 better than Germanys 32-year-old Jan Ullrich, who won the 1997 Tour and who has finished second five times. 

Said Ullrich: Lance was too strong from the start. Added Basso: Lance is just better. 

Even so, it was Armstrongs second-smallest margin of victory. In 2003, badly affected by the lingering effects of a pre-Tour crash and suffering dehydration in a brutal heat wave, Armstrong defeated Ullrich by only 61 seconds. His first Tour victory, in 1999, was by 7:37, occurring less than three years after he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs. 

When Armstrong won his first Tour in 1999, the event barely registered on the US sporting radar. A year earlier, a drug scandal had tarnished the race so badly there were fears it would end. But in his first appearance at the Tour since his cancer diagnosis in the fall of 1996, Armstrong rode powerfully to a shocking victory. 

As he kept winning in dramatic fashion ? coming from behind in mountain stages and dominating during the individual time trial stages ? Armstrong brought the little-understood sport to the point where the Outdoor Life Network televises the entire three weeks live and has seen its ratings rise in each of the last four years. 

Armstrong also started the Lance Armstrong Foundation to raise money for cancer research. The foundation created the Livestrong bracelet, a yellow ring of rubber symbolising both Armstrongs stranglehold on the yellow jersey and his belief that cancer can be conquered. Selling at $1 each, the bracelets are worn by schoolchildren and heads of state (President Bush wears one, as does Monacos Prince Albert) and more than 52 million have been sold. 

The Tour route is filled with groups of fans who are cancer survivors and who credit Armstrongs return to cycling with their determination to return to their pre-cancer lives. 

 Armstrongs five-year-old son and three-year-old daughters, dressed in matching yellow sundresses, were conceived with the sperm Armstrong had saved before undergoing chemotherapy. He divorced the childrens mother, Kristin Armstrong, last year but shares custody of the children and owns a home in Austin, Texas, within a mile of Kristins. 

Since his divorce, Crow has been a constant presence. Last year, when the US cyclist broke the record of five wins held by Frances Bernard Hinault and Jacques Anquetil, Spains Miguel Indurain and Belgiums Eddy Merckx, Armstrongs children didnt attend, but Crow rode in the team car and took practice rides with Armstrong. 

This year, Armstrong said his incentive to race wasnt for more money or fame or to make his record harder to break. It was to have his children see him retire wearing the yellow jersey. 

They are the three most important people in my life, Armstrong said. I wanted to ride into Paris today for them, so that the last image they had of their father as a sportsman was that of a champion, wearing the yellow jersey. There was no other incentive for me in terms of money or history or legacy. Only to have these three precious little people remember their dad in the yellow jersey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jyotirmoyee proposes new stadium

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Asian Games gold medallist and Member of Parliament Jyotirmoyee Sikdar has proposed the setting up of a new stadium with a 400-metre track at the Krishnanagar Government College ground to Union sports minister Sunil Dutt. 

I made the proposal to him and a formal letter will follow within a week, Jyotirmoyee said at the Salt lake Stadium on Friday. 

She also has plans of setting up seven stadiums in each block of her parliamentary constituency, Nadia. 

I dont have enough money to buy grounds, but if schools or colleges comes up with proposals to convert their ground into small stadiums including tracks, I will surely try to do that from my MP quota, she promised. 

According to the MP, she is trying hard to convince the government to spend more money in searching and grooming raw talents in the sub-continent. 

I dont feel there is any need to induct foreign coaches for our athletes, instead it is important that we should bring trainers from abroad to train our coaches, she stated. 

Jyotirmoyee stressed hard on the improvement of infrastructure in every district in the state and other parts of the country to get good results at least in the Asian level. 

In Atlanta Olympics, we could only send athletes for a relay event, but now the numbers have increased and last time in Athens, Anju (Bobby George) missed a medal by a whisker, which is definitely a step forward, she felt. 

The Bengal athlete seemed optimistic about Anju and Pinky Pramanicks performance. 

The way Anju is working, I feel she will produce even better results in the next Games and Pinkys chances are bright in the Asian level if she concentrates on two events, Jyotirmoyee signed off.

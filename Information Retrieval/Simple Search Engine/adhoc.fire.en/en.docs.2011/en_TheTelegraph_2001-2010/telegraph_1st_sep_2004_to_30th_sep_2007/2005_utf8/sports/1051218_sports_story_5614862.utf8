 Aronian lifts title

Khanty Mansiysk (Russia): Former world junior champion Levon Aronian of Armenia comprehensively defeated former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine 2-0 in the tie-break games of the final to lift the World Chess Cup that concluded here on Saturday. 

Winning both the games under rapid time control, Aronian stamped his authority on the event and remained the only contestant in this long seven-round grind to remain undefeated. 

The superiority of the Armenian can be gauged by the simple fact that he was stretched to the tie-breaker only twice ?? once in round four against Spanish Francisco Vallejo Pons and next in the finals against Ponomariov. 

Besides, Aronian won all the two mini-matches under normal time control games. The success rate of the Armenian was phenomenal as he won as many as seven out of 14 games under normal time control and drew the remaining. In the rapid tie-break games, Aronian scored 3.5 out of four overall. 

The highest rated Armenian ever went home richer by $ 80,000 (approximately Rs 36 lakhs) for his exploits here. 

Ponomariov, the youngest ever world champion after his triumph in the Moscow World Championship of 2001-2002 had to be content with second place and got $ 54,000 for his efforts. 

The third place went to Etienne Bacrot of France who had beaten Alexander Grischuk of Russia in the play-off for the third spot. Grischuk finished fourth. (PTI)

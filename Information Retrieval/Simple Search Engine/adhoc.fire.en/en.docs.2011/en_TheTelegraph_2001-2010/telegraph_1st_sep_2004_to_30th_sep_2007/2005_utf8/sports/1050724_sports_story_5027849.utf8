Calcutta: Call it Peter Thangarajs misfortune or a reflection of football officialdom in our country, the fact remains it took a helluva long time to organise a benefit match for a true great. 

It was almost three decades-and-a-half ago that Thangaraj played his last competitive match. Had he been an accomplished Test cricketer, rather than a formidable goalkeeper, Thangaraj would surely have received his testimonial cheque 30 years back. 

Of course, the 69-year-old wasnt complaining. In fact, he was quite overwhelmed by the occasion ? an East Bengal versus Mohammedan Sporting exhibition game at the Barasat Stadium ? and profusely thanked the organisers (Sports Management Group, Aamra Barasat and the IFA) and fans for making it an afternoon to remember. 

Its great to catch up with so many of my contemporaries? I wish we could all slip into football gear and get on to the ground. This is a wonderful occasion and I hope more such games are arranged for those who have represented the country, Thangaraj said after receiving a cheque for Rs 3 lakh from Bhaichung Bhutia and a bunch of gifts and mementoes in the presence of Sailen Manna, Tulsidas Balaram, Sahu Mewalal, Chuni Goswami, PK Banerjee, Sukumar Samajpati, Parimal Dey, Santo Mitra and Tarun Bose. 

There was a common thread in the legends recollection of Thangarajs playing days ? none forgot to mention his 50-metre throws from the goal area and 70-metre goalkicks. I even scored from one of his long passes? the opposition used to run backwards on seeing him prepare for a goalkick, remarked PK. 

It was an ideal venue for such an event. Fans came in droves, filling up every nook and corner of the 20,000-capacity stadium. And they were treated to some serious football by the new-look East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting teams, both playing their maiden competitive game in the state this season. 

For the record, the red-and-golds won via an R.C. Prakash penalty early in the second half. There was a bit of everything: a penalty, some penetrative attacks, solid defending, a heavy 10-minute shower making the turf slippery and heavy, as well as some rough play leading to an injury to Madhab Das. 

The Mohammedan Sporting defender got a nasty elbow-hit on the forehead from Gouranga Dutta and had to be taken to a nursing home after losing consciousness temporarily. He was ruled out of danger late in the evening after medical tests were carried out.

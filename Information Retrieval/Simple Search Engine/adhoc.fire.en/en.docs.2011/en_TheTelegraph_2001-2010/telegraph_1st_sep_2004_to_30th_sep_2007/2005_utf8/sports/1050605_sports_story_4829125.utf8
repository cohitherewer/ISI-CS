 Collymore scalps seven

 - Second test 

 Pakistan restricted to 374 

 Younis after reaching his century on Friday 

Kingston: Younis Khans ninth Test hundred steered Pakistan to 336 for six on the first day of the second and final Test against the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, on Friday. 

The 27-year-old batsman anchored the innings before paceman Corey Collymore claimed three wickets in the final session to keep the home team in the match. 

Corey Collymore took seven for 78 to bowl out Pakistan for 374 on the second morning of the second Test. At lunch on Day 2, the West Indies were 59 for the loss of Chris Gayles wicket. 

Collymore dismissed Younis (106), Asim Kamal (51) and Shahid Afridi (33) to peg Pakistan back after they had reached 247 for three after winning the toss at Sabina Park. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq, back in the side for his 101st cap after being banned for the first match due to excessive appealing in the last Test of the tour to India in April, chalked up his 39th half-century. 

Collymore, who also removed Shoaib Malik for 13 in the morning session, finished with figures of four for 55 for the West Indies, who are 1-0 up in the series. 

The West Indies could have picked up a seventh wicket when fast bowler Tino Best, back in the side in place of the injured Fidel Edwards, had Kamran Akmal caught behind off a thick edge but umpire Darrell Hair called a no-ball. 

Television replays, however, showed that Bests heel was behind the line. Akmal finished the day unbeaten on 24 with Abdul Razzaq 19 not out. 

Younis took the days batting honours, hitting 14 fours in a 168-ball innings as he compiled his third century in four matches. He shared partnerships of 87 with Inzamam (50) and 117 with left-hander Kamal, who struck his eighth half-century in his 11th Test.

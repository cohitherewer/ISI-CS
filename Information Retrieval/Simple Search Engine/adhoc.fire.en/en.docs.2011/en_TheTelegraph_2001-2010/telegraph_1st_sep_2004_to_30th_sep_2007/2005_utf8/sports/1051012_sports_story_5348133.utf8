 Baros to miss match vs Finland

Helsinki: Czech Republic striker Milan Baros is set to miss his sides must-win World Cup qualifier against Finland on Wednesday because of injury. 

The Czechs need three points in Helsinki to secure second place in Group One. Failure to do so would allow Romania, who have a superior head-to-head record, to finish second behind group winners The Netherlands. 

Everyone knows what is at stake. Im not worried about motivation, Czech coach Karel Brueckner said. 

Aston Villa striker Baros, who played as a lone frontman in the 2-0 home defeat by the Dutch on Saturday in the absence of Jan Koller and Vratislav Lokvenc, has an Achilles problem. 

Right now, its looking more as though he (Baros) wont play, team doctor Petr Krejci said on Monday. 

Brueckner is likely to start Galatasarys Marek Heinze up front, and could pair him with Jiri Stajner, although the Hannover 96 player was ineffective against the Dutch. Vladimir Smicer is likely to start despite a nagging thigh injury. (Reuters)

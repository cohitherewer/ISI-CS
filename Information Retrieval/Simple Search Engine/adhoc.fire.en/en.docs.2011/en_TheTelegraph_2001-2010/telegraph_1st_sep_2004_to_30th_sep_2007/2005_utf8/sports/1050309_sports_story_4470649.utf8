The Telegraph - Calcutta

 July deadline for Netaji Indoor

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Renovation work at the Netaji Indoor Stadium for September?s $170,000 WTA Sunfeast Open has to be completed by July. 

?WTA Tour officials will come for a final inspection of the venue, so the stadium has to be ready before that,? said Mahesh Bhupathi whose management company Globosport is organising the Tier III event in association with the state government, from September 19-25. 

Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya will co-ordinate the event on behalf of the state. 

Bhupathi, who had a 15-minute meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the Writers? Buildings on Tuesday, said no decision has been taken on whether to make entry free. Globosport tried that at last month?s Hyderabad Open where the police had a tough time controlling the thousands wanting to see Sania Mirza play. 

Work at the Netaji Indoor has started in full swing. The roof is being repaired, the floor will be changed to facilitate the laying of synthetic courts and the air-conditioning system is being revived. 

According to Bhupathi, two courts will be laid at the main stadium and three more for practice purposes at the Khudiram Anusilan Kendra. The courts, to be imported from Spain, are likely to be set up in late August. 

Whichever top-10 player Bhupathi manages to bring to the Calcutta meet, Sania is going to be a huge attraction. After her brilliant Dubai Open campaign, Sania?s next assignment will be the Miami event, . 

?She?ll play the qualies there even if she can?t get in directly. That will be followed by a $75,000 Challenger in France before she returns to India for the Fed Cup,? informed Bhupathi.

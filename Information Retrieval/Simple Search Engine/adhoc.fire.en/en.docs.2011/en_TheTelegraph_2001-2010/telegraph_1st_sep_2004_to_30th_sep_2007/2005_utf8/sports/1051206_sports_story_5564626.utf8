 It was tough to sit through the tie: Goran

Bratislava: Goran Ivanisevic revelled in Croatias historic Davis Cup triumph over Slovakia on Sunday after being a reluctant spectator all week. 

It was tough? tough to sit down and go through all these matches, the former Wimbledon champion said after Croatia became the first unseeded nation to win the trophy with a 3-2 victory in the final. 

Its easier to play, you get out all the emotions. 

The 34-year-old Ivanisevic last played for Croatia in 2003 and has since retired from the ATP Tour because of nagging shoulder injuries. However, he was named by captain Niki Pilic as Croatias fourth player for the final. World No. 9 Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic ended up playing all five matches in the tie, relegating Ivanisevic to the sidelines. 

Ivanisevic, who has appeared in a record 26 Davis Cup ties for Croatia and compiled an excellent 48-15 win-loss record, had to settle for being an inspirational cheerleader in the Sibamac Arena. 

Wimbledon I won by myself, this is different. But this comes after Wimbledon, added Ivanisevic. 

Ivanisevic won two bronze medals at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, was three times a Wimbledon runner-up and finally clinched a Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2001.

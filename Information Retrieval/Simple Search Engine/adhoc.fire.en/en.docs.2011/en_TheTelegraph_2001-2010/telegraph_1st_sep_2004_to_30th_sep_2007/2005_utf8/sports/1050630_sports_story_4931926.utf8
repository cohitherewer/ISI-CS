The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB draws a blank

 - BENGAL COACH Ghavri out of bounds 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ghavri has in principle agreed to be Mumbai coach 

Calcutta: Karsan Ghavri is unlikely to rejoin as Bengal coach and will most probably sign on for Mumbai, it was learnt. That, incidentally, has left the states cricket mandarins in a quandary. The CAB has nobody to fill this important post in state cricket. 

The Mumbai Cricket Associations cricket improvement committee has the power on all cricketing matters including the appointment of the coach. At its meeting Tuesday, the committee was told that Ghavri had been approached and that the former Test mediumpacer had agreed in principle. No paperwork has been done on this, yet, though. 

The CAB bosses, till the other day, were sitting on their hands, unwilling to commit themselves to another season with Ghavri. This was even after Ghavri himself had indicated at the end of last season that he was not too keen on staying on in the state (citing family reasons). Surprisingly, the CAB had not even initiated talks with any other prospective person for the coachs job. 

With Ghavris joining Mumbai becoming a virtual reality, the CAB draws a blank. They had, probably, taken it for granted that Ghavri would change his mind and would be available even as a last resort. 

Yes, we did not show any interest in renewing his contract, but then Ghavri was never in our scheme of things this season, said a senior CAB functionary, desperately trying to put up a brave front. 

The officials are now eagerly waiting Jagmohan Dalmiyas return from London to chart out the course of action. The options are, however, limited. 

W.V. Raman is not interested, office work in Chennai is keeping him back. Robin Singh was contacted but the former India all-rounder also did not show much interest. 

With a foreign choice being limited, it may finally fall upon a state coach to take up the responsibility in the forthcoming season. Ashok Malhotras name is being considered strongly in certain circles. 

But all will depend on Dalmiyas decision.

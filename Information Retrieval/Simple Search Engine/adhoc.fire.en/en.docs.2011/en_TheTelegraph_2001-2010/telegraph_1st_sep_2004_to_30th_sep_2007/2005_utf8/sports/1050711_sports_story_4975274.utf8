 Steven Gerrard keeps Liverpool fairytale alive

 - Entire process of selling or buying a player through agents needs to be regulated

 Guest Column - Gary Linekar 

 Gerrard rsquo;s exit would have consigned Liverpool to mediocrity

What a bizarre six weeks Liverpool have suffered since last season supposedly ended because, at Anfield, it has been business as usual, not that you could describe the extraordinary happenings there as remotely usual. I was dragged into their crazy summer when I had to defend myself against a libel action brought by Harry Kewell, while the club were successfully fighting for the right to defend their Champions League crown. 

We then had the remarkable volte-face of captain Steven Gerrard, who was apparently on his way through the Bill Shankly Gates one day and the next was talking about signing on for life. The fact he could even contemplate leaving may anger supporters, but they should share the immense relief of everyone at the club that he is staying because, in my book, if he had left, it would have been the end of Liverpool as a big club. 

That might sound overly dramatic but allowing a player of his quality to leave would have put Liverpool, once the most feared club in Europe, into the category of a selling club and once a team are perceived that way, they are on the fast track to mediocrity. Losing a top player is one thing; losing him after winning the Champions League would have sent out all the wrong signals to other top players who might have been considering joining Liverpool. 

Any top player thinking of signing would have taken a step back, and said, Hang on, theyve just sold one of the best midfielders in the world, what sort of ambition have they got? And can they afford to compete at the top level? 

Would Luis Figo have been interested in signing if Gerrard had just caught a train to Chelsea? 

Gerrard is a great player and is going to develop into an even greater one. And, as such, I can understand the problems he had in making his decision. There seems no doubt that there was also some friction with the manager, Rafael Benitez, and Gerrard would genuinely have thought that the club wanted to sell him. 

They certainly showed no inclination to rush to the negotiating table, which must have made him think, Do they really want me? Do they need the money? 

I think it was a case of heart ruling the head in the end, although by turning down Chelsea he has to accept that it will be much harder to win things with Liverpool. They finished 40 points behind the Londoners in the Premiership last season and there is no reason to believe that they can dramatically close that gap. 

Whatever people think of him, it must have been a hard decision for Gerrard. 

I remember how hard it was for me to leave my home-town club, Leicester, because youre comfortable there, everyone loves you and there is a comfort zone. 

But it was easier for me because they were never going to be challenging for honours, while Gerrard is clearly frustrated because Liverpool are a big club who have not been winning trophies in recent years. Even though Liverpool won the Champions League, he is realistic enough to know they may never do it again in his lifetime, but a little bit of him has probably persuaded the rest of him that fairytales can have sequels, that his team can do it again. 

All those idiotic people who flooded the phone lines condemning him when he looked like leaving love to complain that players are only interested in money these days when the evidence does not support that. In fact, very few of the very best players move. They are all earning fortunes and, if you are already on pounds 100,000 a week, is it really going to change your lifestyle to earn an extra pounds 10,000? What can change your lifestyle is a move to a club where you might be miserable, so it boils down to where a player wants to play and where he feels happy. 

Thierry Henry is a classic example of that. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger rescued him from a desperately unhappy situation at Juventus and he is now clearly happy with his life in North London, on and off the pitch. He could play wherever he wanted and name his own price, as all the top players could. 

But it really is not just about money. You have to love the game, the passion surrounding it and have the desire to win the big trophies to play the game at the top level. And if you look at players who really are in it only for the money, they tend to be the ones who never reach that top echelon. 

The aforementioned Kewell was accused of being interested only in money, but not by me. He obviously thought he would be furthering his career by moving from Leeds to Liverpool and, although my comments about the transfer and the amount that Kewells agent received led to the court case, which ended in a goalless draw, it raised an issue that I still hope the football authorities will consider. 

I was personally saddened that a court case was necessary but, whatever it was about, it was not me trying to say that footballers should not use agents. That would be complete nonsense. 

Everyone is aware that players earn astronomical sums of money and I have always believed that they need agents to look after them because they are not qualified, strong enough and, in some cases, well-educated enough to negotiate their own contracts. 

But if football clubs are run by sensible business people, which we have to assume they are, then why on earth would they need to use an agent for transfer work? Surely they could use a director of football, the chairman, a chief executive or any other competent person employed at the club. 

We all know, of course, why agents are used. Because the clubs want to test the water so that they are not left with egg on their faces if the player they are targeting does not want to come ? or not for the amount they want to pay in wages. 

I was happy to use the services of an agent when moving between clubs as a player but I would have been appalled if I found out he was also working for the selling or buying club. That would have been a clear conflict of interest. I cannot believe the games rulers cannot see that and resolve to show some leadership to correct the problem. 

Look at the Chelsea and Ashley Cole business, which was done with a degree of arrogance that was unbelievable. Tapping up has always gone on, but to have a player and his agent and representatives from another club in the same room just beggared belief. It was blatant and if you banned agents from working for clubs, the Cole thing would never have happened or, if it had, there would have been huge punishments in place, as indeed was eventually the case. 

The game is constantly shooting itself in the foot on this issue and we need some strong people at the top to correct it, be it the FA, the European governing body, Uefa, or the world governing body, Fifa. 

Football needs to help itself by regulating the whole process, which really should not be that difficult. 

Football, despite what the knockers say, also has an image to uphold and it is important that it does everything within its powers to make sure that, as far as possible, it is seen to be beyond reproach. 

It is miles off that at the moment but if it could remove this particular cancer, it would certainly be in much more robust health. As indeed Liverpool are now that Gerrard is staying.

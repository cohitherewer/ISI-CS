Sofia: Viswanathan Anand did not get the start he was looking for as he had to split the point with world No. 3 Bulgarian Veselin Topalov in the first round of the Mtel Masters chess tournament here. 

Russian classical champion Vladimir Kramnik emerged early leader with a finely crafted victory over Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in this category-20 event. 

On the other board, Brit Michael Adams and Hungarian Judit Polgar drew their game after an absorbing battle. 

With Kramnik on one point at the top of the table after Round I of this double round-robin event between six players. Anand is second along with Polgar, Topalov and Adams with half-point from the first game. Ponomariov, the former world champion, after losing the first game itself, is at the bottom. 

Even as Kramnik stole Day One honours with his lone victory, the Anand-Topalov battle was clearly the game of the day in the oft-repeated Sicilian defence. 

Playing white, Anand repeated the same order of moves that had fetched him a fine victory in the Linares tournament earlier this year over Topalov, but this time, the Bulgarian, as it appeared, was much better prepared. 

Taking a cue from young compatriot Cheparinov, Topalov embarked on a better defence in the middle game and faced an astonishing queen sacrifice by Anand soon after. 

Though Anand had three minor pieces in the bargain, the local hope maintained his cool in difficult situation and found almost the best available moves in complicated position to steer the game to a draw by perpetual checks. 

I am sure the computer will show something better than what I could see at the board in the middle game. I felt I was better but somehow it was not easy, Anand said after the 60-move game. 

Kramnik was the hero on all counts as he outplayed Ponomariov in all departments of the game. Playing the white side of a Caro Kann classical, Kramnik showed who rules better with his deep positional insight and got a huge advantage right from the middle game after employing a popular set-up. 

Ponomariov was at his wits end in the ensuing endgame to work on his defensive measures and after the dust subsided he found himself a pawn less. 

Kramnik left him with little chance of survival showing impeccable technique and notched the full point in 60 moves. Even though he earned widespread praise, Kramnik was not too delighted with his one-sided effort. 

Adams was in for a surprise from Polgar who employed the Paulsen Sicilian to get a reasonable start. After the opening, the Brit was doing just about fine till such time Polgar embarked on an equalising plan with a series of exchanges leading to an opposite colour bishops endgame. 

No matter what Adams tried thereafter, the game remained within the boundaries of a draw. The peace was signed in 74 moves.

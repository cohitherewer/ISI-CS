 Narain takes a practice spin

 - Im happy with progress 

Nurburgring: Narain Karthikeyan was into Team Jordans vigorous practice session ahead of the European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring circuit Friday, but the rookies spun and lost time and timings were not too good. 

The arrival of Renaults experienced test driver Franck Montagny of France boosted the teams spirit although problems haunted bo-th the drivers, Karthikeyan and his teammate Tiago Monteiro of Portugal. 

Both the drivers spun which made them lose some track time but managed to finish in 20th and 24th position, respectively. 

I did not have a very good afternoon session, as I hit a cone and slightly damaged my car and then I had a small spin, said Karthike-yan, who will be driving at Nurburgring for the first time. 

I have spent most of the two sessions learning the layout, as again this is a circuit I have never been on. We have made some changes to the car that we had not tried before and I am quite happy with the progress we are making, said the Indian who failed to finish in the previous race at Monaco. 

Jordans Friday technical programme consisted of fine-tuning of the chassis and evaluation of different types of Bridgestone tyres. 

Alex Wurz once again undertook the role of third driver for the Mercedes-McLaren team this weekend and later in the day he maintained the mornings quick run by setting the fastest time. (PTI)

 Its Sporting vs Dhoni today

 - P.SEN TROPHY FINAL 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 M.S. Dhonis two knocks have left the CAB officials wondering whether the home talent is good enough 

Calcutta: If theres anything particular to make Sundays P. Sen Trophy final between Shambazar and Sporting Union, it has to be the new batting sensation in Indian ODI brigade. 

Such has been the impact of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in this tournament that this 23-year-olds sheer presence will boost Shambazar and his side will start as favourites. 

A 126-ball 207 in the first match against George Telegraph and the 44-ball 102 in the semi-final (versus Kalighat) were too hot to handle for the opponents. 

Former India opener Sridharan Sriram and medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul have packed further punch to Shambazars chances. 

Sporting, on the other hand, will also look forward to claiming their maiden crown in the season. 

We will definitely keep an eye on checking Dhoni and consequently, we are working on some plans, veteran spinner Utpal Chatterjee said. 

Chatterjee, incidentally, presented a ball ? named David after him ? to the Jharkhand player. 

Chatterjees Sporting and Bengal teammate, Ranadeb Bose also echoed the same feelings. 

No doubt, he (Dhoni) is a good bat. But were ready to put him to a sterner test. We are under no pressure, Bose remarked. 

Sporting also have taken three players on loan ? Tollygunge batsman Sanjib Goel, Eastern Railway keeper Rahul Dev and Services lef-arm spinner Subhra Sankar Chakraborty ? for this invitational meet. 

Dhonis two swashbuckling innings have left the CAB officials wondering whether the home-bred talents are good enough to match the prize visitors. Just the other day, a top CAB official was lamenting that the 23-year-old had utterly exposed the quality of local players. 

Well, a lot will be at stake when Bose amp; Co. will come face to face with Dhoni on Sunday. 

Shambazar, eyeing their maiden P. Sen title, would also look forward to India A mediumpacer Shib Shankar Paul to deliver the goods on the crunch day.

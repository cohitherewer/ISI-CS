 Well find true form this week: Warne

Nottingham: Leg-spinner Shane Warne says Australia will find their true form in this weeks fourth Ashes Test after being dominated by England in the previous two matches. 

You will see us coming out firing in this game, no doubt, he told a news conference at Trent Bridge on Tuesday. 

I can guarantee you will see a good performance from Australia. I expect some special performances from a few of the guys. 

He conceded that England were playing the better cricket after levelling the five-match series 1-1 in the second Test at Edgbaston before just missing out on victory at Old Trafford. 

Whatever it is, the pressure or wanting it too much, I dont know, Warne said of the world champions struggle. He said they were still pleased with the way they had held on to draw the third Test from a losing position. 

Australia also had the luxury of knowing that they only needed one more victory in the final two Tests to retain the Ashes that the team have held since 1989. 

I think in the back of their (Englands) minds they will think they have played very well but we have held on for the draw and only lost by two runs when we were outplayed. 

I think they will be disappointed they are not 2-1 up. 

I think the pressure is on England and not Australia. At the end of the day, they have to win, we only have to win one (of the last two Tests). 

Warne, whose marriage broke up just before the series, tops the wicket-takers list with 20 at 20.90 apiece. 

Im pretty proud of the way I have been going in this series, considering what I have been going through, he said, adding that the series was already one to remember.

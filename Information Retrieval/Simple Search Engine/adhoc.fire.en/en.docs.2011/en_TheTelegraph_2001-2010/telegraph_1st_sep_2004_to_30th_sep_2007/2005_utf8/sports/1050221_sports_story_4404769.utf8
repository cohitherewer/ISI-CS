 India beatable at home: Woolmer

 India are an all-round team, feels Woolmer 

Lahore: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said Sunday that India are beatable at home and his young team can take inspiration from Australia and South Africa who won a series in India. 

?It would be a challenging tour to a country which is regarded as probably the second best team in the world, but in recent years Australia, Pakistan and South Africa have beaten them and that would be an inspiration,? Woolmer said as Pakistan prepare for their tour of India. 

?A home team always starts as a favourite but this Pakistan team is maturing and is ready for the India challenge.? 

Australia won their first series in India since 1965 last year while Hansie Cronje led South Africa to a 1-0 win in their series in India in 2000. 

Pakistan under captain Wasim Akram beat India in two of the three Test matches in their last tour of India in 1999. 

?They (India) are an all-round team now than in 1999 and 2000 and it would be a challenge to confront the likes of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh,? said Woolmer, who played 19 Tests for England and coached South Africa between 1994-1999. 

Woolmer took over as coach in June 2004, replacing Javed Miandad after Pakistan lost the home series against India. 

Pakistan arrive in India on February 28 to play three Tests and six one-day games in their first tour of their neighbour since 1999. 

?It would be as challenging as Australia in a different sort of way but we won?t be confronted with the same sort of fast bowling attack like Australia but Indian spinners would also be challenging,? Woolmer said. 

Pakistan announced a 16-member squad Saturday, recalling off-spinner Arshad Khan after pacer Shoaib Akhtar pulled out due to injury. 

He disagreed that Pakistan?s pace attack was depleted with fit-again Mohammed Sami under more pressure. 

?I don?t think it would put Sami under pressure, it will give him a chance to become the strike bowler, he is due for some luck and hopefully take wickets when it matters.? 

Woolmer agreed with former Pakistan great Imran Khan that India were vulnerable on pace. 

?Don?t think about getting India out on spin, they played Australian Shane Warne with consummate ease and I tend to agree with Imran that they are more vulnerable on pace, people bowling in the right areas.? 

He also said scoring big in India would be vital. 

?We haven?t been convincing with the bat in Tests in the sense that we have not played long innings, something we must do in India and obviously India have the edge as they are very dangerous in batting.?

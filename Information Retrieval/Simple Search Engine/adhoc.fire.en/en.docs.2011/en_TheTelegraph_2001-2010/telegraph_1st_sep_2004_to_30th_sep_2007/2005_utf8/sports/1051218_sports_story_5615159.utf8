 Aperitivo strikes Gold 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs Aperitivo delivered the goods again, but the Diffident Dramatic Irony-son made a heavy weather of his stablemate, Formal Invitations challenge before lifting the 1,600m Calcutta Gold Cup on Saturday. Jockey C.Alford, who partnered the Deepak Khaitan-property to victory, could have scored far more comfortably had he kept the Mayfowl Cup-winner under pressure in the last furlong of the race. However, the nose that separated the two stablemates was a long one as Alford allowed the challenger to come that much closer.

 The 9-10 favourite was ridden off the pace in view of Senor Pele opening up an eight-length lead prompting Alford to alert the favourite a trifle earlier than planned. Aperitivo was right on the haunches of the leader nearing the final turn and into the lead soon after with a two-length break, which Alford, perhaps, thought was invincible one.

 Alford was, however, at his best on Vijays Romantic Fire while varying the pace upfront to lift the 1,400m Elusive Pimpernel Cup over 1,400 metres. It was a scintillating performance produced by the Steinbeck-Allspice horse with a topweight of 60 kg on his back.

 Trainers Javed Khan and Daniel David also had a profitable afternoon. They scored a double and a treble, respectively. Javeds Acturay had the measure of Bharath Singhs Bollywood Dreams in a tight-finish. Incidentally, Bharath will be packing off to Mumbai on Sunday to saddle three runners and will return on the Oaks day for his filly, Sanskara.

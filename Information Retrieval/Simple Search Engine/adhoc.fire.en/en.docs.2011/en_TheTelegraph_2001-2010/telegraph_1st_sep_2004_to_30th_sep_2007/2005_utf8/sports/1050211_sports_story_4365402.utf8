Colombo: Many people in cricket-crazy Sri Lanka had a grudge against Shane Warne but the Aussie leg-spinner?s reputation in the Indian Ocean island is changing fast. 

As he walked out to the field at a sun-drenched cricket stadium in suburban Colombo to conduct a spinners? camp with Muttiah Muralidharan on Thursday, the Australian was mobbed by hundreds of teenagers. 

Over 200 children from schools hit by the December 26 tsunami took part in the coaching camp conducted by the game?s top two spinners. 

?I hope you kids will learn something from him, he is one of the greatest bowlers I have seen, you will be lucky if you end up bowling like him,? Muralidharan told the children. 

The two bowlers have vied for the world record for most Test wickets over the past 12 months. ?I think the record-chase between the both of us is good for the game,? Warne said. 

?But kids, Murali is the best, he spins the ball 14 feet,? Warne added. Warne, who made his Test debut in Sri Lanka in 1992, currently holds the record with 566 wickets in 120 matches. MuraliDharan is second on the list with 532 scalps from 91 Tests. 

?I met Shane Warne and learned a few things from him, that is enough to cherish for a lifetime. He is just great,? said 16-year-old Chinthaka Perera, who could not stop smiling after shaking hands with the Australian. 

Warne has a soft spot for the Indian Ocean island as he took his 500th Test wicket at the Galle stadium in southern Sri Lanka, which was destroyed by the tsunami. 

?I just can?t get over the spirit of these kids, even after what has happened they are smiling,? Warne said. (Reuters)

 United chairman resigns

London: Manchester United Plc. said on Tuesday that non-executive chairman Roy Gardner and two non-executive directors had resigned from the board of the worlds richest football club following a take over by US tycoon Malcolm Glazer. 

Glazers sons, Avram, Bryan and Joel, meanwhile, have joined the board as non-executive directors, the club said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange. 

Following the unconditional mandatory cash offer for Manchester United... Roy Gardner, the non-executive chairman, and Ian Much and Jim Neill, both non-executive directors, have each resigned, the release added. 

The English Premiership club also announced the reappointment of Andy Anson as commercial director. 

Malcolm Glazer initially seized majority control of United after buying a 28.7 per cent stake in the club from Irish racing millionaires J P McManus and John Magnier last month. 

Uniteds board later caved in to Glazer after agreeing to sell its minority stake to the 76-year-old owner of NFL franchise Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 

Minority shareholders in the Premiership team have until June 13 to accept Glazers unconditional offer, valuing the club at ?790.3 million ($1.47 billion). (AFP)

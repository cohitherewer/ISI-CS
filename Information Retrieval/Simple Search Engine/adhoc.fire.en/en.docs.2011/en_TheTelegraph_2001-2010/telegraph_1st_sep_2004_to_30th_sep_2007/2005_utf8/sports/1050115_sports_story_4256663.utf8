Melbourne: Damien Martyn?s unbeaten 95 and a five-wicket haul from spinner Brad Hogg helped Australia crush the West Indies by 116 runs in the tri-series opener on Friday. 

World champions Australia smashed 301 for four including half-centuries from Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting before the West Indies were dismissed for 185 in 46.2 overs. 

Paceman Brett Lee (three for 36), having returned to action after quite some time, removed Chris Gayle (0), Ramnaresh Sarwan (four) and Xavier Marshall (five) to peg back the West Indies at 33 for four in the seventh over. 

Captain Brian Lara (58) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (46) rebuilt the innings with a 98-run partnership for the fifth wicket before the pair fell to left-arm spinner and Man of the Match Hogg, who took a career-best five for 32. 

Martyn, who hit six fours and one six in his 93-ball innings, continued the stunning form he showed in 2004 when he hit six Test centuries. The 33-year-old was on 93 with one over remaining but could manage only two singles to finish five runs short of his sixth century. 

Opener Clarke hit 66 and Ponting also cashed in on the touring side?s poor fielding, the Australian captain blasting 78 including five fours and one six. 

Dwayne Bravo took a sensational diving catch at mid-wicket in the third over to remove Adam Gilchrist for a duck off the bowling of Ian Bradshaw. 

Clarke shared a 115-run stand with Ponting for the second wicket to put the home side on track for a big total. 

Left-hander Darren Lehmann (20 not out) brought the Melbourne Cricket Ground crowd of 51,453 to their feet with a boundary through point off the final ball to lift the total over 300. 

Unable to break into Australia?s Test X1 for their last three series, Lee trapped Gayle leg before from the third ball of the West Indies innings. Wavell Hinds was run out for five before Lee had Sarwan and 18-year-old debutant Marshall caught behind fending off short balls. 

Hogg claimed the key wicket of Lara caught at cover and in his next over he caught and bowled Chanderpaul to kill off the West Indies challenge at 136 for six.

 Farewell to Richie, the Bradman of commentary

 - Aussie great to bid goodbye to Channel 4 after The Oval Test 

MARK NICHOLAS

 Richie Benaud 

At the completion of next weeks mouth-watering Oval Test, there will be some goodbyes. To the Ashes perhaps, by the touring Australians who have held them so deservedly and so gloriously for so long. If not, then to Englands dream. 

To Channel 4s cricket coverage, which has brought a different colour to the game and, most poignantly of all, to the Bradman of the commentary box, to the microphones most prolific and definitive performer. 

Yes, its Goodbye everyone from Richie Benaud. 

And we will miss him, terribly. More than just a cricket person, Richie has become a guest at home, a mate in the pub, a deviation at the office, even a pop-up on the laptop. There is no imposition but he is there if you want him, a guiding hand and a soothing voice in a mad world. 

It is an astonishing 42 years since Morning everyone became the catch-phrase of summer and it will be no more. 

Contrary to reports, there has been no offer from Sky and nor would it be accepted if there were: Im a free-to-air man, thats how it has always been and thats how it will stay. It is a good time to go, while much loved and still with the legend in tact after the greatest series of them all. 

I thought 1981 was the best and most dramatic I would ever see but this has shaded it, pretty much whatever happens at The Oval, says the master of less is more. The 1960-61 series with the tied Test in Brisbane was the best in which I played but this summer, well, what tension, what surprises. The teams are stronger now than in 1981, so the standard is higher. In fact Id go further and say that the Test matches I have watched in the last two years have provided the best cricket I have seen. 

He should know for he has attended more Tests than anyone, alive or dead. 

What hurts with his parting, is that most of us grew up with him and those who did not, saw him play. And he could play. Vaunted as a captain and unbeaten in any series while in charge, he retains an all-time great rating as a leg-spinner. 

Always, Benaud has been the games devoted servant. Careful with his words, considered and mostly private with his opinions, he has just occasionally let rip with withering comment about that with which he did not approve. 

He learned the art of commentary ? and an art form he has made it ? long before the job had celebrity attached to it. Forty-nine winters ago, he inhabited the bowels of the BBC, trailing producers, editors and researchers before following Peter Sullevan to the races and Henry Longhurst to the links. 

He had worked as a young crime reporter on a Sydney newspaper in between cricket engagements and says now: I had no real idea that there was future in broadcasting. Without the BBC course my days may have been very different. The key thing was that I learnt the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see. 

I am not sure he says as little as people think but rather his timing is magical, his phrasing simple and his choice of what and when, quite brilliant. Thus, when Michael Kasprowicz was caught at the wicket with Australia two runs shy at Edgbaston, he followed the camera ? Jones! pause, Bowden! 

I asked about Ricky Pontings language at Trent Bridge. Pure frustration, though that doesnt condone an outburst in front of spectators. But Im happy with Ricky. 

If you are defending, it is because you are not bowling well. The loss of Glenn McGrath is a cruel blow, two blows in fact. 

And Michael Vaughan? Very good, terrific imagination. The key to the series was the England bowlers and with the way that they have performed, he has been able to attack and defend as he chooses.

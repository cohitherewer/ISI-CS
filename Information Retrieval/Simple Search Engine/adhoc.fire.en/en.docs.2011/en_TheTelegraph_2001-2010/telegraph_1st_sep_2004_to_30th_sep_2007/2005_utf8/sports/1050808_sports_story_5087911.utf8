 Edgbaston was our last chance: Vaughan

Birmingham: England captain Michael Vaughan conceded on Sunday that his sides Ashes challenge would have been ended at Edgbaston if they had lost the second Test. 

The home side looked certain of victory on the fourth morning at Edgbaston, with the visitors still needing 107 to win with only two wickets left, but only sneaked home by two runs to level at 1-1. 

If we had gone down 0-2 today, I dont think we would have come back, said Vaughan. Not against a team like Australia. It sets up a great series. I think the helter-skelter cricket will continue. It was ebb and flow, up and down. 

Australia were bowled out for 279 chasing 282 for victory. It was the closest winning margin in Ashes history. It was also Englands first win in a live Test against Australia since the first Test of the 1997 series, also at Edgbaston. 

All their other recent wins have been in dead rubber games. Australia have won the last eight Ashes series. 

We are going to relive the moment today and continue to talk about the game, then we will take time off on Monday and Tuesday, said Vaughan. 

If you think about the game all the time your brain will get dazed. Its been quite a mentally draining game. We now have four days off, which is what we ask for between Tests. Then we will try and reproduce this performance at Old Trafford, he said. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting, whose side had resumed on 175 for eight chasing 282 to win, said: We were just trying to survive. We thought if we hung on and a few things went our way we could get close. We probably got closer than we expected. 

Im not sure we were ever favourites, even right at the end. It was still our number 10 and 11 batsmen against Flintoff and Harmison, said Ponting. 

The Australia captain conceded he might have been wrong to put England in on the first morning following a prolonged spell of rain. The home side, however, hammered 407 on Thursday. 

He said: I thought there would be some movement. The wicket surprised me on the first day, I must admit. I guess I was wrong. 

But he also said: Even though we lost, I think we can take as much from this game as England, The way we fought with our backs to the wall. It just makes you hungrier still. 

You want to be just a little bit better and sharper because you know you can make a difference. The third match of the series starts at Old Trafford on Thursday. Only one side in Ashes history, Don Bradmans in 1936-37, has come back from 0-2 down to win a series. 

For Australian camp, however, the good news is Glenn McGrath is improving after missing the second matchwith an ankle injury but seems set to miss the third one as well, according to Ponting. 

I dont know if Glenn is definitely out (of the third Test) but hes unlikely to play, the Australian captain said. He has improved, hes off his crutches and moving quite freely but more realistically it will be Trent Bridge. 

You are always going to miss someone of Glenns ability, Ponting added. But if he had been batting at the end we might not have got that close. 

 McGrath has 508 Test wickets and needs only 12 more 

 to become the most successful fast bowler in Test history.

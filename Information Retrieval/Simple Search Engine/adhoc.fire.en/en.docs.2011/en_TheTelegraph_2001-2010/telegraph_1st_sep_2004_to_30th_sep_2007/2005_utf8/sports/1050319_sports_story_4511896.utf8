 Offer to buy out players? contracts

St George?s: CL Financial is willing to buy out the contracts of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to resolve a sponsorship dispute that could keep seven star players out of the series against South Africa and Pakistan. 

?We have offered to buy out the contracts of Cable and Wireless-contracted players and also to buy out Digicel?s contract,? said CL executive director Andre Monteil Thursday. 

Monteil made the offer in a letter to WICB chairman Teddy Griffith and chief executive Roger Braithwaite. ?CL Financial is interested in resolving the dispute in the interest of West Indies cricket,? he said. 

The WICB recently announced that captain Brian Lara, vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle, Fidel Edwards, Dwayne Bravo, Dwayne Smith and Ravi Rampaul were ineligible for selection for the home series against South Africa and Pakistan as they were contracted to Cable and Wireless, a telecommunications rival of the board?s chief sponsor, Digicel. 

WICB lawyers have been examining the players? contracts to make sure they would not cause the players or WICB to be in breach of the $20 million deal with Digicel. 

An undisclosed 13-man West Indies squad was chosen Thursday to face South Africa this month, without revealing whether it included the seven banned cricketers. The squad will be announced soon, said WICB spokesman Leonard Robertson. 

The first Test against South Africa starts in Guyana from March 31. (AP)

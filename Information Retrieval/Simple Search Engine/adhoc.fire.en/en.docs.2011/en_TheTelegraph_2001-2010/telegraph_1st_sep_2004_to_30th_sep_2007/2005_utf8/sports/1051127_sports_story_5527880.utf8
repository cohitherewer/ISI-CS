 Jeev Milkha slips to tied 28th

Kochi (Japan): Three bogeys in five holes on the back nine ruined the day for Jeev Milkha Singh, who finished with a one-over 73 and slipped to tied 28th in the 140 million yen Casio World Open. 

Toru Taniguchi pulled into sole lead with a four-under 68 that placed him at eight-under 208 for three days and one clear of J. D. Kim, who also had a third round 68 and is at nine-under. 

Hideto Tanihara and overnight co-leader T. Suzuki are at eight-under in shared third place. Other overnight leaders, M. Osanai and T. Teshima had 73 each and slipped to tied fifth. 

Jeev, lying 19th overnight, started with a bogey on the second but the birdie on eighth saw him turn in even par. A birdie on tenth seemed a good start for the back nine, but then he hit disaster trail with bogeys on 12th, 14th and 16th holes and dropped to two-over. 

He made up a bit with a birdie on 18th to end at one-over for the day and one-under 215 for three days. Putting, which has been a trouble zone for Jeev, was once again the Achilles heel, as he needed 32 putts, after 30 and 29 on first two days.

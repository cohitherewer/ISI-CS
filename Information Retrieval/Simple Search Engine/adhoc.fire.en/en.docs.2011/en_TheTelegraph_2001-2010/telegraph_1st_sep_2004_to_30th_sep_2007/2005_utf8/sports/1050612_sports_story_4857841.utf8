The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sunday, June 12, 2005 

 London: The International Rugby Board (IRB) has complained to IOC president Jacques Rogge following ?insulting comments? made by an IOC executive about the sport?s possible inclusion in the 2012 Olympic Games. Rugby Sevens is one of five sports which could be voted into the 2012 Games at the IOC?s session in Singapore next month if one of the current 28 disciplines is dropped.

 Earlier this week, however, IOC executive board member and president of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) Denis Oswald described sevens as ?something of a joke.? The comments infuriated the IRB ? which has spent two years compiling its case for inclusion ? and the sport?s governing body fired off letters of complaint to Rogge. ?For a man of his position to say things like this is not only deeply insulting to us and to the Sevens World Cup champions Fiji but it shows a complete lack of understanding,? IRB director Chris Rea said. 

 London: Scottish teenager Andy Murray can provide a bright future for British tennis after Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski have retired, feels former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker. The 18-year-old won over an army of fans at Queen?s Club this week when he ran former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson close. ?He is an exciting, fresh talent. He played well under pressure and was unlucky against Johansson,? Becker said on Saturday. ?He seems to be the best young player Britain has. It is tempting to believe the hype but this is just the beginning for him ? all the signs are good.?

 Rome: Lazio have named Delio Rossi as their new coach, the Italian Serie A side announced on their website on Friday. The 45-year-old replaces Giuseppe Papadopulo, who resigned after securing the club?s top-flight status on the last day of the season. Lazio finished 11th in the 20-team division, two points above the relegation zone. Rossi?s previous Serie A experience includes stints with Salernitana and Lecce. This season he almost saved Atalanta from relegation to Serie B after taking over a seemingly hopeless situation at Christmas.

 Tokyo: Japan?s Shunsuke Nakamura is poised to move to Spain from Italian club Reggina, a Japanese newspaper reported on Saturday. Atletico Madrid and Deportivo Coruna have both made offers for Nakamura and the 26-year-old midfielder could leave Italy by the end of the month.

 ?He is a top player and has been a real asset for Reggina,? Reggina president Lillo Foti was quoted as saying in the report. ?He can be a star in La Liga too. We have had offers from Atletico and Deportivo. We want to take a decision by the end of June.?

 Nakamura, who joined Reggina from Yokohama F-Marinos three years ago, would become the first Japanese player to move between the top European leagues.

 London: Cycling has dropped two track events to make way for BMX at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. 

 The men?s one-kilometre time trial and the women?s 500 metres time trial have been dropped, the sport?s world governing body UCI said on its website. The decision, which does not affect the two events at the cycling world championships, was taken at a UCI meeting in The Hague on Friday. The meeting also awarded the 2009 road world championships to the Swiss city of Mendrisio.

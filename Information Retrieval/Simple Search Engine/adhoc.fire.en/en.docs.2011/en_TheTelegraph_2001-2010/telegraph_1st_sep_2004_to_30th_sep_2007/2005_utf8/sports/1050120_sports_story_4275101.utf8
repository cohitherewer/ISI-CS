 Geet Sethi storms into last 16

Mumbai: Seven-time world billiards champion Geet Sethi unravelled yet another sparkling display en route to a place in the senior billiards pre-quarter finals in the Goregaon Sports Club national billiards and snooker championship here Wednesday. 

Sethi, who has been consistent while uncorking century breaks, came up with two significant wins in group H that saw him first crush west Bengal?s Brijesh Damani 798-247 and later overcome a spirited challenge from Maharashtra?s Rishabh Thakkar 444-377 in a tight contest. 

While demolishing Damani, Sethi impressed with breaks of 195 and 232 on his fifth and sixth visits that reflected the brilliant form that he is enjoying. 

He added a 90 and 91 off successive visits late in the tie, before returning in the evening to beat Thakkar by a mere 67 points. 

In his concluding group match against Thakkar, Sethi struck a brilliant 188 on his third visit, before the former made a late bid for a surprise win that was in vain. 

The loss, though, did not affect Thakkar?s chances of qualifying for the pre-quarter finals along with Sethi. 

Rafat Habib of the Railways made a surprise exit after crashing to Yasin Merchant in his concluding group E tie.

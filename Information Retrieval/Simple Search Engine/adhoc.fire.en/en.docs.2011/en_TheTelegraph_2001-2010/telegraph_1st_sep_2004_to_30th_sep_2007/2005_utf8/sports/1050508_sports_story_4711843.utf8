Rome: Andre Agassis Rome Masters bid ended when he lost 5-7, 6-7 to Argentine ninth seed Guillermo Coria in the semi-finals on Saturday. 

In the final Coria will play another claycourt specialist, Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal, who beat compatriot David Ferrer 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. The match will be a repeat of last months Monte Carlo Masters final, which Nadal won in four sets. 

Corias victory ended Agassis hopes of reclaiming the title he won in 2002. It was an erratic performance by the 35-year-old American, whose flashes of brilliance were undone by often wayward groundstrokes. 

A break down after the seventh game, Agassi produced a pair of winning service returns to level at 5-5. In the next game, however, a series of long forehands gifted Coria the chance to serve out for the set. 

The Argentine tightened his grip on the match when Agassi committed another series of unforced errors to drop serve in the opening game of the second set. 

He levelled with a volley winner and a serve return that rocketed down the line to go a break up but another shaky service game sent the set into a tie-break. Agassi made four more unforced errors to lose it to love and gift Coria a place in the final. 

Twelve months ago Coria was the most dangerous claycourt player in the world as he won titles in Buenos Aires and Monte Carlo on his way to the French Open final. 

Now, however, the man to beat is 18-year-old Nadal. Rome will be his sixth final of the year and has won four titles on clay in 2005. 

Victory against Ferrer extended his winning streak on the surface to 16 matches. 

Nadal started in business-like fashion, lashing groundstrokes past his bewildered opponent to break in the opening game. 

As the match continued, however, Ferrer began to time his shots better and forced the fifth seed into forehand errors that caused him to drop serve in the eighth and 10th games and lose the first set. Ferrer twice battled back from a break down in the second, but a long forehand in the ninth game gave Nadal the break he needed to take the contest into a decider. 

Nadal rallied to break in the fifth game before Ferrer scrapped for every point and saved two match-points to level at 5-5. His relief, however, was short-lived as a pair of backhand errors, a double fault and a wild smash by Ferrer put Nadal back in front and the teenager served out for victory. 

 Mahesh-Todd out 

In doubles action, Mahesh Bhupathis hopes of clinching his second title of the season were dashed when he and Todd Woodbridge went out in the semis on Saturday. The fifth-seeded Indo-Aussie pair lost 4-6, 4-6 to Frenchmen Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro. 

Bhupathi, 30, and Woodbridge, 34, are yet to win a title since their triumph in Sydney in the first week of the year. The duo, with 23 Grand Slam crowns between them, has not even reached a final four months. Reaching the last four in Dubai was their next best effort. 

 Bhupathi and Woodbridge currently 

 languish at No. 11 in the ATP teams list. (Agencies)

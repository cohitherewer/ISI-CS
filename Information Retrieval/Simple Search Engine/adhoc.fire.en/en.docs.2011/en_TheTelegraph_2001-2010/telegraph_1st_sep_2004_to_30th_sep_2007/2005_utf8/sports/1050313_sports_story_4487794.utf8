The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harbhajan was needed: Qadir 

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

 Abdul Qadir at a city hotel on Saturday 

Calcutta/Karachi: Pakistan?s former greats were unanimous in hailing the achievement of Inzamam-ul Haq amp; Co., who managed to force a miraculous draw in Mohali. 

Abdul Qadir and Ijaz Ahmed, who were in Calcutta (en route to a veterans? tournament in Silchar), also said that omitting Harbhajan Singh was a ?mistake? for India. 

Meanwhile, in Pakistan, chief selector Wasim Bari and two former captains ? Moin Khan and Rashid Latif ?heaped praise on Kamran Akmal and Abdul Razzaq. This is what they said: 

 Ijaz Ahmed: Razzaq 

 and Akmal have been absolutely outstanding. Razzaq, despite 

 being an attacking batsman, played patiently. And Akmal 

 showed great maturity. 

But, India did make a mistake in not picking Harbhajan in the team. Anil Kumble is not a great turner of the ball. Pakistan would have been in some difficulty had Harbhajan been there as our batsmen have not been playing spin well in recent years. 

Regarding the coaching, I am not against a foreigner for the post. But it would have been better had Bob Woolmer been made coach of the National Cricket Academy instead. Former Test players would have done a better job as coach of the national squad. 

I think Yousuf Youhana should be moved up the batting order to number three. He should take up responsibilities. 

And as far as Shoaib Akhtar is concerned, he seems to me like a problem child. He should concentrate on the job for he may find it one day that his time?s up. 

 Wasim Bari: A tremendous team effort. 

 The way the team fought back from a desperate situation 

 has made the entire nation proud. Razzaq and Akmal probably 

 played the innings of their lives. 

 Moin Khan: ?Simply awesome? If luck 

 had favoured Pakistan, I?m sure Pakistan would have won. 

 In my view, the new star on horizon is Kamran Akmal. 

If you analyse the match in a broader prospective, Pakistan were a better side. They had been completely written-off and were branded as the weakest team ever to go on a tour. So, credit must be given to Inzamam who injected a new life in his young outfit. 

 Rashid Latif: I think Pakistan saved 

 the Test only because they played with purpose and with 

 a lot of spirit. Kamran Akmal and Abdul Razzaq should be 

 given full marks because they not only occupied the crease 

 but kept the scoreboard moving. The two showed that they 

 had cool and intelligent heads on their shoulders. 

I think after this result, the balance of the series has now shifted in Pakistan?s favour. 

 Abdul Qadir: India were wrong in selecting 

 the Mohali team. They should have had Harbhajan in the XI. 

 Zaheer Khan is being persisted with despite his not performing 

 well. Not playing Harbhajan was a mistake. 

However, Abdul Razzaq and Kamran Akmal batted brilliantly Saturday and managed to save the Test. They have shown lot of maturity. 

Danish Kaneria is a talented bowler but he has to be positive. He should now look to win matches for the country. I was the one who spotted him during a camp some years back. He has the ability to turn the ball. 

On Woolmer, I feel he is shuffling the batting order and making too many experiments. While other teams are getting ready for the 2007 World Cup, he is busy experimenting. It would be better if we had an advisor (one from the country itself), who would guide the team like an elder brother.

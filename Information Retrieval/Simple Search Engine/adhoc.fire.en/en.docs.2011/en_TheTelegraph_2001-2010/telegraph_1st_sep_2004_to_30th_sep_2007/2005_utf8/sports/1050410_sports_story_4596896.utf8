 - US MASTERS

Augusta: Storm clouds surrounded Augusta National on Friday with the US Masters second round barely starting and Phil Mickelson and Vijai Singh becoming involved in a war of words over spike marks. 

When play was finally suspended for the day owing to the threat of thunderstorms and lightning, British Ryder Cup players David Howell and Luke Donald and American Chris DiMarco held the early lead at five under par. 

Englishman Howell made a fast start to round two with five birdies in his first seven holes. His compatriot and fellow Masters debutant Donald had completed two holes and first-round leader DiMarco just one. 

Defending champion Mickelson, after an opening 70, and world No.1 Singh, whose 68 was his best start at Augusta National in 12 appearances, were among 15 players in the 91-strong field yet to tee off in the second round. 

However, the pair had earlier shared a verbal spat when 2000 champion Singh complained to tournament officials that Mickelson?s golf shoes had caused spike marks on the 12th green. 

The two players had a heated discussion in the champions? locker room when the left-handed Mickelson approached the Fijian over the incident. 

?He expressed his concerns and I expressed my disappointment with the way it was handled,? Mickelson said in a statement. ?I believe everything is fine now.? 

This is the third time in the last four years second-round play at Augusta National has spilled over into the third day, and the ninth event out of 15 on this season?s PGA Tour to be hit by the weather. 

Howell, a member of Europe?s triumphant Ryder Cup team at Oakland Hills last September, produced red-hot form in overcast afternoon conditions after completing a level-par 72 earlier in the day. 

The 29-year-old Englishman reeled off birdies on 10, his first hole, 11, 13, 15 and 16 before play was suspended. 

?My expectations weren?t that great at the start of this week because I haven?t been playing very well over here,? Howell told reporters. 

?But as soon as you start hitting it well, then you start expecting to score well. I am delighted to have played 26 holes so nicely today.? 

Donald, who moved into a share of the lead at five under with a birdie at the par-five second hole, is becoming accustomed to the stop-start nature of the 2005 PGA Tour. 

?It?s been this way for most of the year,? said the 27-year-old Englishman, who plays most of his golf in the US. 

?I try and kind of switch my brain off when I?m on a break, try not to think of anything. That?s what I?ve been working on this week.? 

Earlier in the day, American Ryder Cup player DiMarco held off initial challenges by Mickelson and Singh to retain his overnight lead when the thunderstorm-hit first round was completed. 

DiMarco, a stroke clear at the start of the day after three consecutive birdies from the par-four first, picked up another shot at the par-three sixth on his way to a five-under-par 67. 

?We?ve got a long way to go but I?ve given myself a really good chance here,? said the 36-year-old DiMarco, who also held the first-round lead on his debut at Augusta in 2001. 

?I?ve felt comfortable every year I?ve been here and I like the golf course. It sets up good for me.? 

Singh, boosted by back-to-back birdies on 13 and 14, had a chance to join DiMarco at five under but missed a five-foot birdie putt at the par-five 15th. 

The tall Fijian, Masters champion in 2000, parred the last three holes to share second place with Briton Donald. 

?It?s a great start, but nothing more than that,? said Donald after missing a birdie putt from four feet at his final hole. 

There was little joy, however, for Tiger Woods and Ernie Els, the remaining members of golf?s so-called ?Big Four?. 

Three-time winner Woods, chasing his first major title since the 2002 U.S. Open, had to settle for a two-over-par 74 after a roller-coaster ride over his last six holes. 

The former world No.1 birdied the fifth, his second hole of the day, and the seventh but dropped on six and eight to extend his run of opening rounds above par since his last Masters victory in 2002. 

He then parred the opening hole of his second round to stay at two over for the tournament. 

Els, runner-up a stroke behind Mickelson at Augusta last year, battled to an opening three-over 75 after spending much of his time in the trees. 

The big South African, who has finished no worse than tied for sixth in his last five Masters starts, was among those yet to tee off in round two.

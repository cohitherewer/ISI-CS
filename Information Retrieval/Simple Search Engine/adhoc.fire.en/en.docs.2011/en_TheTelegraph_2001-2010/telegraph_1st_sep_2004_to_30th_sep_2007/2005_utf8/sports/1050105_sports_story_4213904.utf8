The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan to play 9 home ties in first phase

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The highest ever sponsorship, diversified television coverage and increased medical facilities are some of the major highlights of the ninth National Football League (NFL), slated to kick off in Calcutta from January 12. 

The opening tie will be between holders East Bengal and arch-rivals Mohun Bagan. The derby is going to be first of the three NFL benefit ties for Cristiano de Lima Junior, who collapsed and died during the Federation Cup semi-final and the proceeds will go to the Brazilian?s family. 

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told a press conference on Tuesday that Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh will be the chief guest at the opening match at Salt Lake Stadium. 

The federation has roped in ONGC as the title sponsors for the tournament for a whopping amount of Rs 7 crore. This is the largest sponsorship the AIFF has managed to procure so far. The previous highest was Rs 4.5 crore by the Oil Public sector undertakings during the seventh NFL in 2002-03. 

Teams in the ninth NFL will vie for the ONGC Cup. 

ONGC, in return, will get free co-sponsorship in all AIFF-organised tournaments like the Federation Cup, Santosh Trophy and age-group national championships. Meanwhile, the draw for 11 rounds of the competition was released on Tuesday by the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco. 

East Bengal will play six away matches and five home matches in the first phase. Mohun Bagan play nine home matches in the first phase. Their only two away matches are in Goa ? against Churchill Brothers and Dempo on January 29 and February 1, respectively. 

The third Calcutta side, Tollygunge Agragami, will start with five matches against clubs from Goa. 

Colaco said that the draw for the second phase will only be released after East Bengal and Dempo?s AFC Cup fixtures get known. The AFC Cup will start in March. 

However, television coverage details were partially worked out. Das Munshi said that a deal has been struck with Prasar Bharati. Doordarshan will telecast 60 important matches during the year. 

They will pay AIFF Rs 10 lakh each for Class 1 matches, which include all NFL games and semi-finals and finals of Santosh Trophy and Federation Cup. For class 2 matches, which includes second division NFL games, Doordarshan will pay Rs 6 lakh each and for junior and sub junior nationals Rs 4 lakh each.

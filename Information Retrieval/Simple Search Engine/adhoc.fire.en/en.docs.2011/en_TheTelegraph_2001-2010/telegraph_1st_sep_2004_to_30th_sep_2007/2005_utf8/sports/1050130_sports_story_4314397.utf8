The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Zone run South close

Ahmedabad: A sparkling century by Barrington Rowland helped South Zone beat 

East by 13 runs with two balls to spare and earn four points in the Deodhar Trophy limited overs match played here Saturday. 

South put up a challenging 280 for nine and East came close, but packed up at 267 in 49.4 overs. 

Rowland gave a smart start to South with his 104, studded with seven hits to the fence and one six before he was bowled by Ranadeb Bose. He picked up four for 40. 

The other opener Dinesh Karthik managed only 29 before being caught by Sanjib Sanyal off Deepak Mangaraj. India middle order player V.V.S. Laxman also gave a dismal performance, sent back for just five. 

Mangaraj took this scalp too. (PTI)

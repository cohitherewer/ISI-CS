 Goosen, Bryant leaders

 - US PGA MEET Woods in pursuit, 3 strokes behind

Atlanta: Defending champion Retief Goosen rallied and Bart Bryant survived a midday wobble to share the second round lead at the Tour Championship on Friday with Tiger Woods leading a chasing group three shots back. 

Bryant, who shot a course record of eight-under 62 on Thursday, scrambled to a nervy two-under 68 for an encore. It was just enough to keep the 42-year old journeyman atop the leaderboard at 10-under 130 alongside a charging Goosen. 

The South African, who began the day two strokes behind the overnight leader, opened his round with a bogey at the first, but that was the only blemish on the world number fours card as he hit five birdies on the way to a four-under 66. 

Bryant, making his first appearance at the Tour Championship, said: Im gaining a lot of valuable experience. Its kind of uncharted territory for me, having that big of a lead in a tournament and learning to pace myself. 

Im not even halfway done with the tournament, learning how to deal with the emotions. Theres a lot of stuff going on. Im happy to be at 10-under and happy to be tied for the lead. 

Woods hit just three fairways all day, mixing six birdies with three bogeys for a three-under 67, leaving the world number one tied for third with Scott Verplank (66) and Ben Crane (65) at seven-under 133. 

South Africas Tim Clark (67) is one shot further adrift at 134 while Australian Stuart Appleby, who shared the best round of the day with Crane at five-under, and American Charles Howell III are five off the pace at five-under 135. 

Stalked by some of golfs biggest names, Bryant refused to wilt under the intense pressure with three birdies on his first seven holes stretching his lead to five-strokes over the field before his first bogey of the week at the par-four eighth. 

Bryants moment in the spotlight appeared over as he continued to lose ground on the inward nine with back-to-back bogeys on 12 and 13 until his slide was halted with a 29-foot putt for an eagle three on the par-five 15th.

Calcutta: Like many at the Salt Lake Stadium, Biswajit Bhattacharya felt his team should have won Sundays CFL Premier Division match versus East Bengal. 

Refusing to blame the 1-2 defeat on misfortune, the Mohammedan Sporting coach said: Theres no such thing as bad luck? the fact is, we should have won today. 

Biswajit rued the fact that some of his players didnt listen to his instructions. I had anticipated the way East Bengal got their equaliser, but my defenders didnt fall back to cover (Syed Rahim) Nabi, said the coach. 

Biswajit said: We showed we can play good football? we forced them to take us seriously. 

East Bengals assistant coach Bikash Panji felt there was nothing wrong with his teams showing but for the missed opportunities. The boys are doing fine but missing too many goals. Thats the biggest problem area. 

In no mood to grant Mohammedan Sporting, a team of lightweights, moral victory, Panji said: The crosspiece denied them a goal, but we also missed so many sitters? even if we had gone 0-2 down, we had it in us to bounce back with three goals. 

Panji didnt agree that Nabi, who scored both goals after being pushed up front from defence, should be fielded in his preferred strikers position only. If we need him in defence, well use him there? he can adjust to all positions.

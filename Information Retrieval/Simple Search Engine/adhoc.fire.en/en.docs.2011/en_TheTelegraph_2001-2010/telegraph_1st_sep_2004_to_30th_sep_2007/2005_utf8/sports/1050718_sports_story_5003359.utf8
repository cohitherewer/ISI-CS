London: David Nalbandian completed a single-handed demolition of 28-time champions Australia on Sunday when he thrashed world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt to send Argentina into the Davis Cup semi-finals. 

The Argentine posted a humiliating 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 victory over the man who beat him in the 2002 Wimbledon final to give Argentina a decisive 3-1 lead in Sydney before Guillermo Coria rubbed salt into the wounds to make it 4-1. 

I cant believe this moment, this is great, Nalbandian said after being mobbed by his jubilant teammates. To beat Australia here, and on grass, for us thats amazing. 

Argentina, who will play Slovakia in the semi-final in September in Bratislava, will now be favourites to lift the crown for the first time. 

Dominik Hrbaty clinched victory for Slovakia, conquerors of holders Spain in the first round, with an easy victory over Martin Wessels. Slovakia defeated the Netherlands 4-1. 

Memories of the 2002 final came back to haunt France, however, as they were ambushed again by Russia. 

As in Paris three years ago they held a 2-1 lead going into the reverse singles, but Russia, who were without Australian Open champion Marat Safin, again stormed back to turn the tie on its head. 

World No. 7 Nikolay Davydenko overwhelmed French teenager Richard Gasquet 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 to square the tie at Moscows Olympic stadium before Igor Andreev obliterated Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-0, 6-2, 6-1 in the deciding fifth rubber. 

Russia will play Croatia, who also reached the semi-finals for the first time when Ivan Ljubicic gave them a 3-1 lead against Romania by beating Andrei Pavel 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Mario Ancic then made it 4-1 by defeating Victor Hanescu 7-6 (3), 7-6 (8). 

After a tie sprinkled with controversy and ill-feeling, world No. 9 Nalbandian let his racket do the talking as he dismantled Hewitt on a temporary grass court at the Olympic tennis centre. 

Playing faultless tennis Nalbandian broke Hewitts serve twice in each of the first two sets then once more in the third to complete a one-sided victory in less than two hours. 

Hewitt, who traded insults with Coria in his opening singles on Friday, had not lost a Davis Cup singles rubber since 2001. 

I think he was very, very nervous, said Nalbandian who beat Wayne Arthurs in his first singles before teaming up with Mariano Puerta to put Argentina ahead.That gave me confidence and made it easier for me. 

It was not a great day, I went into my shell a bit, said a demoralised Hewitt.

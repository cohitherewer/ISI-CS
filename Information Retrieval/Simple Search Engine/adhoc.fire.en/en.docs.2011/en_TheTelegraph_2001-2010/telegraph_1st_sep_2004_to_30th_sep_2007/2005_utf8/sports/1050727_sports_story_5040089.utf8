The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im not on edge, says Sourav

 - Manager Jagdale takes initiative to reserve a room for former captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: One isnt sure if an effort is being made, but Sourav Ganguly continues to be calm. 

Im not on edge? As Ive been saying, my fate isnt in my hands? Im prepared for whatever is decided by Justice (Albie) Sachs, he told The Telegraph on Tuesday, shortly before boarding a British Airways flight from London. 

Sourav, who completed his commitments for Glamorgan on Sunday, arrives home in the early hours of Wednesday. 

However, he must wait for at least 36 hours to know whether the six-ODI ban stays or is lifted. 

That punishment cost him the Team India captaincy. 

Justice Sachs, the ICC-appointed arbiter, has already indicated his award on the dispute between the BCCI and the world body is going to be made public on Thursday evening. 

That will directly impact on the ban. 

Incidentally, till late on Tuesday, Justice Sachs hadnt responded to a BCCI request that lawyers Siddhartha Shankar Ray and Soli Sorabjee be allowed a hearing. 

A tele-conference, one understands, would also constitute a hearing. 

Sourav stands to benefit if the award favours the BCCI. He has, of course, served out one-third of the punishment. 

Surprisingly, the BCCI isnt readying itself to put the former captain on the first flight to Colombo (en route to Dambulla) if Justice Sachs award leads to the ban being quashed. 

As of now, Sourav is the provisional 16th member for the tri-series which begins with the India versus Sri Lanka face-off on Saturday. 

Perhaps, the BCCI is waiting? Ive not been told anything, maintained manager Sanjay Jagdale, when contacted in Dambulla. 

He himself took the initiative to reserve a room for Sourav in Colombo ? the Indians first stop ? and is going to do the same in Dambulla. 

I got the needful done there (Colombo) through our liaison officer and will do likewise here, Jagdale, a former national selector, informed. 

The Indians, who landed in Colombo last Saturday, travelled to Dambulla (some four hours by road) on Tuesday afternoon. 

Dambulla is hosting the first three of our four league matches.

Pune: Bengal settled for a draw on the final-day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match against Maharashtra on Saturday, earning two points for the first innings lead of 28 runs over the hosts. 

Resuming at 101 for three, Maharashtra were out for 249 in their second innings and the most successful bowler for Bengal was Sourashish Lahiri who bagged seven for 93. 

Maharashtra captain Hrishikesh Kanitkar was the top-scorer (48) for his team in the second innings. 

Former Mumbai skipper and leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule who has switched over to Maharashtra this season contributed with 35 runs which contained four boundaries. 

Sourav Ganguly, who made a fine 159 on Friday and had taken five wickets in Maharashtras first innings did not bowl in the second innings. 

Bengal had enough time and 46 overs to overhaul 222 for an outright win, which could have helped them get four points. 

The team management sought to play it safe. At stumps, Bengal were 93 for one with Arindam Das out for 37.

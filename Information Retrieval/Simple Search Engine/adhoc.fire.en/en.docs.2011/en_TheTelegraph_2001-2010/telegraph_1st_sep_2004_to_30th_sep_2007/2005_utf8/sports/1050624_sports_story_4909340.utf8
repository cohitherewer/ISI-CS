 Argentina date makes Mexico smack lips

Frankfurt: Ricardo La Volpe is relishing the thought of leading Mexico into a Confederations Cup semi-final against his homeland Argentina on Sunday while striving to put their success into context. 

Countries like the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have all made it to the top in the past, but could not stay there if I am not mistaken, he said. 

While countries like Brazil and Argentina are always going to be among the best, to reach their level you have to get to the top and stay there and this is what Mexico has to do. 

I think we have surprised a lot of people here. Suddenly I hear people are talking about us as favourites to win the tournament, but Brazil and Argentina are going to be extremely demanding on you and we might have to beat both of them to be champions. I think we have to keep this in context. 

Although La Volpe plays down their achievement, his record speaks for itself. For the first time in their history Mexico have gone unbeaten for 20 matches, coming from behind to beat a good Japan team 2-1 in their opening match then beating world champions Brazil 1-0 on the way to winning their group. 

They are also certain to return to Germany next year for the World Cup finals. Only a sudden and totally unlikely loss of form in the final matches of the CONCACAF qualifying group would prevent that from happening.

 Indian teenager making waves in Britain 

 - Meet gollfer Kiran Matharu 

London: Sixteen-year-old Kiran Matharu, a Yorkshire-based non-resident Indian, is fast emerging as the best woman golfer of Britain. 

Dubbed by the British media as the Sania Mirza of British golf, Kiran leaves this week for Texas to train under Butch Harmon, the former coach of Tiger Woods. Kiran is the daughter of Amarjit Matharu, a barman in Leeds. 

According to media reports, sports companies Nike, Ping and Red Bull are considering offering promotion contracts to Kiran, who is already being compared to American golf sensation Michelle Wie. 

Kiran is one of the rare Asian women playing golf in Britain, but is confident of making it to the international level. She will play in the Curtis Cup next year, where she would be the youngest member of the squad, before turning pro. 

Her father said in a newspaper interview: To be honest, the amateur game doesnt suit her because its largely match play and anyone can beat anyone on a given day. Shes a stroke player and in the professional game thats what you have to be good at. The cream will always rise to the top over four rounds. 

The qualities you need to be the best ? dedication, talent, work ethic and temperament ? she has all of those. Shes very determined inside, but shes not very aggressive. 

If media reports are any indication, she might soon become the first woman golfer of Indian origin to make a deep impact. (PTI)

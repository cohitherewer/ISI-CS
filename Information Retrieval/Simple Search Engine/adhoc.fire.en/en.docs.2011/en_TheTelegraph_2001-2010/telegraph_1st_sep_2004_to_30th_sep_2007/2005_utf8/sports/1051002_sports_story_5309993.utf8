New Delhi: Anil Kumble and Ashish Nehra have been rested for the N.K.P. Salve Challenger Trophy. 

Announcing the three teams (India Senior, India A and India B) on Saturday, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said that the leg-spinner has been advised four weeks rest following a fitness report by Indian physio John Gloster. 

Nair said Kumble was under rehabilitation, but did not know about his actual problem. 

Nehra, who had to fly home before the Test series in Zimbabwe because of an injury (he was replaced by Ajit Agarkar), would be unavailable for six weeks, according to Nair. 

The BCCI secretary said Kumble and Nehra, and anyone else with a fitness problem would have to prove his recovery by playing in a domestic match to be eligible for India selection. 

Sachin Tendulkars return was formalised when he was named on the India Senior squad, under Sourav Gangulys leadership. This will be Sachins first competitive match in nearly six months. 

Tendulkar has been out of action since the home series against Pakistan. A surgery he underwent on the left elbow forced him to miss the tri-series in Sri Lanka and also the tour of Zimbabwe (tri-series followed by two Tests). 

The master blaster was also forced to opt out of the World XI squad to take on Australia in the ICC Super Series, consisting of three ODIs and a six-day Test, Down Under. 

The Challenger Trophy, featuring the cream of Indian cricket divided into three teams, will be held in Mohali from October 10 to 13. 

All top names barring Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag will be seen in action. Dravid and Sehwag will be doing duty for the World XI in the ICC Super Series Down Under. 

The India A and India B teams will be led by V.V.S. Laxman and Dinesh Mongia, respectively. 

Two from Bengal ? allrounder Manoj Tewari (India A) and medium-pacer Ranadeb Bose (India B) ? have got the selectors nod. 

ICCs experimental super sub rule will be operational in the four limited overs matches.

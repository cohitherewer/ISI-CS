 Flintoff, Harmison restrict Pakistan 

Multan: England pacers Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison took four wickets between them to restrict Pakistan to 244 for six at close on the first day of the first Test at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Saturday. 

On a pitch offering little, Flintoff and Harmison, who grabbed two wickets in one over after tea, pegged back the home side from 161 for one to 183 for five. 

Captain Inzamam-ul-Haq (41 not out) and wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, who made 28, then shared a damage-control stand of 55 for the sixth wicket. 

Inzamam stood firm, trying to ensure that the solid foundation provided by the earlier batsmen was not wasted, including a good opening stand of 80 by openers Salman Butt (74) and Shoaib Malik (39). Butt also put on 81 for the second wicket with Younis Khan (39) before he was caught behind by wicketkeeper Geraint Jones. 

Off-spinner Shaun Udal, making his Test debut at the age of 36, picked up Butts wicket but there was a degree of luck, the ball ricocheting off the temple of slip Marcus Trescothick and down into the hands of the diving Jones 

Butt said: The pitch is still good for a total of 400-plus, but we squandered our chance today. 

Harmison rocked Pakistan first ball after tea when they resumed on 181 for three by trapping Younis, and then, five balls later, bowling Hasan Raza with a fast inswinger. 

Raza, playing his first Test in three years, was softened up with a quick bouncer that hit him on the shoulder and soon after lost his off-stump. 

Flintoffhad provided the breakthrough by trapping Malik leg before in the morning session.

Two minutes later, Micky Fernandes could have increased the lead but for Chowbey. Fransa were further reduced to nine men when Sebastiao Endro was sent out for a dangerous tackle on substitute Bhuvan Joshi. 

Fransa came with counter moves and equalised in the 85th minute when Alberto scoring off a Peter Rodrigues cross from the right.

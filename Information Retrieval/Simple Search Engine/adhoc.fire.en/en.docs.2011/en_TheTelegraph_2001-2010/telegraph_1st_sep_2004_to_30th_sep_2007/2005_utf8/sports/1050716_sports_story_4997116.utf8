Colombo: Sri Lanka fast bowler Chaminda Vaas took four wickets for 12 runs to leave West Indies precariously placed on 59 for six at the close of a rain-affected third day of the first Test on Friday. 

West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul was unbeaten on 29 with Omari Banks yet to score. 

The under-strength tourists, who are missing 10 of their leading players due to contracts dispute, extended their slim second innings lead to 117 during the 106 minutes of play possible at the Sinhalese Sports Club. 

Vaas, 31, followed up a fine allround performance on the second day with the wickets of Narsingh Deonarine (seven) and Dwayne Smith for no score. 

Deonarine was trapped leg before while padding away a delivery that held its line sufficiently to hit off stump and Smith, who recorded a pair, was trapped lbw by an in-dipper that swung back extravagantly. 

Chanderpaul and 19-year-old wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin (11) survived a searching session before bad light forced the players off. 

After the resumption the sixth-wicket pair extended their partnership to 27 before Muralidharan pinned Ramdin leg before on the back foot with a sharp-spinning off break.

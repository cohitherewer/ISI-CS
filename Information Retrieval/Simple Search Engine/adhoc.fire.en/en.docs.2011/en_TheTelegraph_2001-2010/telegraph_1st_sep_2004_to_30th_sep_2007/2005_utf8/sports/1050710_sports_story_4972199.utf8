The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England are basking in collective confidence

 - Australia will find it tough to come back at Lords 

 Derek Pringle

 Collingwood says beating Australia in the 2004 Champions Trophy has been the catalyst 

By defeating Australia more times in a month than many of their predecessors enjoyed over a career, the present crop of England cricketers appear to have crossed a mental Rubicon against the old foe. What other explanation is there for producing such persuasive cricket against a side that once habitually brought the worst from them? 

The answer, particularly if the winning habit can be extended in the NatWest Challenge match at Lords on Sunday, has many strands, though perhaps the most apparent is the collective confidence found in Michael Vaughans side. If previous England teams lacked it, this one has shown it to be contagious enough for both team and individual to play without fear or doubt. 

Nobody better personifies this than Paul Collingwood, whose occasional medium-pace is causing Australia as much bother as his busy batting. A man whose bowling was once used more in apology than expectation, his four wickets at Headingley on Thursday were a major factor in Englands nine-wicket win. 

Its the best Ive ever known it, said Collingwood about the mood in the England dressing room. You can only really build confidence and team morale when you are winning, but weve done quite a bit of that over the past two years. Its what Australia have done so well over the last 10 years. 

For most, self-belief in sport is built on eggshells, being both precarious and easily dislodged. Yet, it can just as easily be boosted by seemingly small events, which is just what Englands victory over Australia achieved during the ICC Champions Trophy last September, a match now seen as the catalyst for recent successes. 

That game was a real hurdle for us as wed not beaten them for such a long time (14 one-day matches), Collingwood said. Winning that made us realise we could actually beat Australia and our results this year have just been a progression from beating West Indies and South Africa over the past couple of years. 

Collingwood is certainly playing like a man expecting to do well. His 53 in the NatWest Series final, which was tied, was the smart innings of a man who refused to allow the parlous situation England found themselves in to dictate how he played. Instead he and Geraint Jones, who made 71, kept the score ticking over until both were established and back in the game. 

As one used to operating in the shadow cast by bigger names such as Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen, Collingwood simply gets on with his own game. 

Although ambitious to the point where he would like to play more Test cricket (he has two caps), he does not seek the limelight as Fridays choice of relaxation revealed. But while he, Andrew Strauss and Jon Lewis were true to type by spending the day at Woburn playing golf, the day-glo duo of Pietersen and Darren Gough headed for the glamour and buzz of Silverstone. 

Another reason for Englands success is the moderate form of key opponents like Ricky Ponting and pace bowler Jason Gillespie. While Collingwood is right in saying that England have put Australia under a lot of pressure, the itinerary, which has comprised solely one-day matches, has meant few have been able to ease into the tour. 

Gillespie, a bowler whose body has let him down more than once, has simply not been able to go from 0-85mph in the space of a few one-day matches. 

Ponting is also short of his best. His dismissal on Thursday, pulling a short ball from Collingwood to deep mid wicket was careless. Indeed it looked like the shot of man unbalanced not just by sketchy form, but by a mind occupied with the growing realisation that he might be the first captain in a generation not to have the Ashes in his possession when he returns home. 

Australia will respond, that is their nature, though with Shane Watson doubtful after injuring a thigh muscle at Headingley and with Mike Kasprowicz, his possible replacement, short of match cricket, it is difficult to see the charge coming from fresh legs. 

TEAMS 

England (likely): Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood, Geriant Jones, Ashley Giles, Darren Gough, Simon Jones, Steve Harmison, Vikram Solanki (sub). 

Australia (likely): Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting, Damien Martyn, Andrew Symonds, Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath, Michael Kasprowicz, Brad Haddin (sub) if Shane Watson unfit.

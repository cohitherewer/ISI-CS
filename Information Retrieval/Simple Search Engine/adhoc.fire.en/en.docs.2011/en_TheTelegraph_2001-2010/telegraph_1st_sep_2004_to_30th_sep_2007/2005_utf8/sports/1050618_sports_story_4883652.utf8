 PCB chief under fire

Islamabad: Three senators have given a notice to move a privilege motion against Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan for refusing to submit a draft copy of the proposed constitution of the Board to the senate committee as per the earlier commitment. 

He (Shaharyar) has dishonoured the members of the committee ignoring the authority of Senate which is a breach of privilege of the senators, senators Muhammad Enver Baig along with Murad Ali Shah and Dr Kouser Firdaus said in the notice, according to a local daily. 

The three members, who had staged a walkout from the senate standing committee on sports meeting on Wednesday protesting against Shaharyars refusal, also demanded that the matter be discussed on the floor of the house. (PTI)

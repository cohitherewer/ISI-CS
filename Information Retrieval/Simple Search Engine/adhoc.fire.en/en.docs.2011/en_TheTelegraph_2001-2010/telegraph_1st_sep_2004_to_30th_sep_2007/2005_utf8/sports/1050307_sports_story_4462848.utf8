Melbourne: It was India?s baptism by fire for India?s Formula One rookie Narain Karthikeyan. He did all that was asked of him, specifically bringing the gleaming yellow Jordan car back home safe, but having slipped a bit in starting, managed no more than a 15th place in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix at Albert park here Sunday. 

Renault?s Giancarlo Fisichella won, and Michael Schumacher managed no more than 42 laps in tough conditions that made Karthikeyan?s feat look brighter. 

The Indian, whose next stop will be the Malaysian Grand Prix March 20, could also take heart from the fact that he was fastest among the rookies. 

Overall, Karthikeyan was satisfied despite a ?very bad start?. ?I had a very bad start and then stayed behind (Jordan Teammate Tiago) Monteiro for a while. After the first pit stop, I pushed a lot and it was a trouble-free race,? Karthikeyan said later. 

?It is very good to finish the first Grand Prix of the season and I am looking forward to the next race, even though the weather conditions will be much warmer and humid,? he said. ?The car has been reliable as I expected. It is a good team work and really a very good feeling.? 

Now, Karthikeyan has a new target. ?I?ve just got to do a good job and stay on in Formula One for as long as I can,? he said. ?My dream was to compete in Formula One. I?ve done that and now it is to score points.? 

Karthikeyan?s debut performance warmed the heart of Jordan bosses who were glad that their drivers managed to take the Jordan Toyota EJ15s home. 

?We are very glad we finished this year?s first Grand Prix. We got both cars to finish and that is an achievement, even though it would have been nice to finish a bit higher up the results table,? Jordans sporting director Trevor Carlin said adding the team was now looking forward to going to Malaysia and ?if possible improving the car a little bit?. 

Collin Kolles, Jordan?s managing director, said: ?Before the GP our aim was to get both cars to the end, so I am very happy that they finished the race in the same conditions that they started in and that there were no nasty surprises.? 

Earlier, Karthikeyan, who had secured the ninth place in the first qualifying Saturday, dropped three places in today?s qualifying despite coming up with a better timing at 1:32.735, 12 seconds faster than his previous effort. 

While starting well ahead of Schumacher, he lost six places at the start and did not pass another car on the track. ?I was excited. It was a bit like the Macau Grand Prix,? he said. ?That was the biggest race I?ve done with all the hoopla going on. But when you start the race it?s like any other race ? you just concentrate and do the best you can. 

?Obviously, I really have a lot of supporters,? Karthikeyan said of the many fans behind the wire meshing and the autographs. ?I?m really happy and proud. Now I?ve learnt what it is to finish a Grand Prix,? said Karthikeyan. ?I didnt expect so many supporters, there were maybe five or six hundred of them. 

?It?s great to have Indians behind me. The seat was a little bit bad and my shoulders are hurting as well but I am so happy to finish,? he said. ?I had one hairy moment coming in to the pits but I think the second stint was very strong,? he added. ?I think we will improve race by race and finish as many as possible. When there is a possibility to score points we must be there to take it.? 

The next race is Malaysia and Karthikeyan can expect an even noisier reception from what could be an army of supporters. ?Malaysia is probably my home Grand Prix because it?s only two hours from India and there are going to be a lot of supporters,? he smiled. ?I?m just so thrilled that they are also following racing in a big way in India now.?

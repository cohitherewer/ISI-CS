 Fifa may hold exhibition ties in India: AIFF chief

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Fifa?s effort to raise funds for the tsunami affected will reach Indian shores sometime in February. Two exhibition matches, involving some top international stars could be held in Calcutta and in New Delhi to raise funds. This was announced here Sunday by AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. 

?The matches will be played either between a Fifa XI and an Asia XI, or between two World XI sides, depending on Fifa?s decision,? Das Munshi said. ?We have requested Fifa to include two-three Indian players in the teams.? 

Most of the players in the matches will be ?immediate past players,? but a few active Premier League or Serie A players might also be seen in action, he said. Early this month the AIFF had requested the AFC and Fifa to organise such exhibition matches in the country. The AFC had faxed a message to AIFF Friday approving this proposal. 

?The faxed message says that that two matches can be arranged in a gap of three days in first or second week of February. Since most of the top players are busy playing in professional leagues in Europe, we have to wait for about a month to hold the matches,? Das Munshi said. 

The AIFF has announced a contribution of Rs 15 lakh to the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund. The fund collected from these two matches will also be donated likewise. He said the Rs 15 lakh AIFF donation will be presented to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the inauguration ceremony of the ninth National Football League here Wednesday. 

He said the AIFF was striving to make the NFL inaugural match a grand success to draw the attention of Fifa and infuse confidence in the apex soccer body that holding Fifa fraternity matches would raise adequate funds to serve the purpose. Das Munshi, a member of the task force set up by the AFC on the tsunami, said other countries in the region affected by the natural disaster like Sri Lanka and the Maldives, expressed their inability to raise adequate funds from such matches due to lack of marketing ability. 

Those countries, he said, preferred that India host the matches and distribute funds raised from the initiative. 

And, following that big-ticket initiative, in a bid to help the shock-ridden children of tsunami-hit Andaman and Nicobar islands return to normalcy, the AIFF has planned to take the country?s leading soccer stars for a visit to the football-crazy islanders. 

?We have planned a visit by three-four Arjuna Awardees and star players, including Bhaichung Bhutia, to the islands to meet the children there, who are still in a state of shock,? Das Munshi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand wins, finally

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand finally scored his first victory as he defeated Russian Alexander Morozevich in the fifth round of the Corus chess tournament on Thursday. 

Anand is now on 2.5 points from five outings. Playing black, Anand faced the Torre attack by Morozevich and got the dynamic balance he was looking for without much ado in the early middle game. 

Signalling his intentions of a bloody battle, Anand castled on the queen side to invite Morozevich?s attack and the later did not quite handle it properly after a rather flashy piece sacrifice on the 16th move. Anand quickly regrouped his forces to stop Morozevich?s onslaught and later won another piece to turn the game decisively in his favour. 

Morozevich resigned after 41 moves. (PTI)

Auckland: Australian captain Ricky Ponting blasted a century at a rapid one-day pace to put his side within 73 runs of New Zealand?s first innings total with six wickets in hand at the close of day two of the third Test here Sunday. 

However, Australia?s frantic scoring ended when Ponting went after slaying 105 off 110 balls, and the run-rate slowed from more than five an over to 3.4. At stumps Australia were 219 for four after dismissing New Zealand for 292 just on lunch. 

In a whirlwind session between lunch and tea, Australia overcame a shaky start to put on 143 for two, with Ponting blazing 76 to breath life into a game which had suffered from New Zealand?s pedestrian progress at 2.5 an over. 

Ponting opened with a six when he came to the crease in the second over with Australia one for eight, and added three more sixes along with 13 fours as he cashed in on the small Eden Park boundaries. 

Australia reached 82 for one after 15 overs and they passed 100 in the 20th over as Ponting unleashed his full array of shots. He enjoyed one life when slashing the ball through the hands of substitute fielder Tama Canning at gully, and was eventually out with the score at 187 in the 40th over when he attempted to paddle a loose ball from Nathan Astle down the leg side but steered it into the gloves of wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. 

With Matthew Hayden, Ponting put on 76 in 60 minutes for the second wicket and then 103 with Damien Martyn for the third wicket. 

?I felt really good out there but it wasn?t a pre-planned thing, just go out there, see it and hit it really,? Ponting told a news conference. 

New Zealand must have felt confident when Justin Langer chopped a ball on to his stumps at the end of James Franklin?s first over, but then watched helpless as their limited pace attack was carted to all points of the ground. 

Franklin also picked up Hayden?s wicket ? when umpire Rudi Koertzen accepted a leg before wicket appeal for a delivery that appeared to be heading down the leg side ? but he was soon out of the attack with two for 49 off 10 overs, while Chris Martin bowled 11 overs for none for 53. 

Earlier, Australia wrapped up New Zealand?s first innings, capturing the last five wickets for 64 runs with only Vettori offering any resistance, reaching 41 not out when the innings ended. 

Glenn McGrath was again the standout performer, taking three for 49 off 34 overs including 20 maidens. 

Shane Warne ended with three for 63 off 23 overs, while Michael Kasprowicz and Gillespie took two wickets apiece.

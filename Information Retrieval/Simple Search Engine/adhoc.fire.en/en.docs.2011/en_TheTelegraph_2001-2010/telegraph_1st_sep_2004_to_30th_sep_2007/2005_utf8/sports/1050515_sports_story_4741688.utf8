The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fixing fiasco would have hurt Patil chances

 Sandeep Patil 

Nairobi: The Kenyan match-fixing scandal, which led to a five-year suspension of former captain Maurice Odumbe and further investigations on other players, would have jeopardised Sandeep Patils candidacy as Team India coach, media reports said on Saturday. 

Patil pulled out of the race citing existing commitments with Oman as the primary reason. 

The 48-year-old former India batsman was coach of the Kenya team twice ? first in 1996-1997, and then, returning after the 1999 World Cup. 

He ended his first stint under controversial circumstances after the final of the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia and it was during his second spell that he had much success with Kenya, leading the East African nation to the semi-finals of the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. 

It was also during the same period that allegations of match-fixing tainted the sport and Odumbe faced an investigation by the ICCs anti-corruption and safety unit. 

The 2003 probe, which found the player guilty of taking bribes from an Indian bookmaker, also implicated other players who were later questioned by two investigators from the London-based unit. 

Early this year, Kenyan cricket officials said the investigators were also keen to interview Patil in connection with a four-nation tournament held in Nairobi in 1999. 

Kenyan player Maurice Odumbe has been banned for five years and the ICC is wondering how his (Odumbes) nexus with the Mumbai bookie went unnoticed by Patil who also hails from Mumbai and was a coach of the team during Odumbes frequent visits to the city, a website said quoting the sources. 

Patils compatriot Mohinder Amarnath is one of three men who will be interviewed by a selection panel later this month before Wrights successor is announced.

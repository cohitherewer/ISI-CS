 Ritwik upsets fourth seed

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: It was a mixed day for the Indians in the Calcutta International Squash Championship at the Calcutta Racket Club on Wednesday. 

World No. 62, Indias Ritwik Bhattacharya pulled off a major upset beating fourth seed Egyptian Mohammed Essam A Hafiz in a high-voltage game to move into the quarters. On the other hand, senior national champion Saurav Ghosal went down after a fighting display to top seed Mohammed Azlan Iskandar of Malaysia in the first-round tie. 

Ritwik, who qualified for the main draw via the qualifiers, displayed fine athleticism and let loose some solid attacking strokes to outsmart Hafiz 11-9, 8-11, 9-11, 11-3, 11-8 on a day when four seeds fell like nine pins. Ritwik won the thriller by keeping his cool and using the unforced errors of the Egyptian. 

The Egyptian, who came only this morning, seemed tired and lost steam in the last two games as Ritwik seized control to set up a last eight date with Pakistans Khayal Mohammed who emerged a surprise winner against fifth seeded Englishman Ben Garner 11-10 (2-0), 5-11, 11-7, 11-8. 

Saurav, who got a wild card for the tournament, never seemed overawed by his opponent, ranked 15th in the world, and gave a good exhibition of artistic touchplay and deft placings before going down 8-11, 11-9, 7-11, 3-11. 

Iskandar clinched the issue by putting his experience to good use in the fourth game when he changed his gameplan and went for powerful angled forehand serves which foxed Saurav with their topspin. 

Stacey Ross also from England caused the other upset of the day when he outclassed compatriot and eighth seed Phillip Barker in straight games 11-8, 11-7, 11-4, to move into the last eight. 

Ross would take on second seeded Australian Cameron Pilley. Third seeded Shahier Razik of Canada kept his reputation intact humbling 11-8, 9-11, 11-7, 11-0 to set up a clash with sixth seed Alister Walker of England for a place in the semi-final.

 We need to win this series well: Chappell

 - BULAWAYO TEST - Streak to play subject to passing fitness test

Bulawayo: There are milestones in store for Indian captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Greg Chappell in the first Test against Zimbabwe beginning here on Tuesday, but the duo has decided to take it in stride and concentrate on winning the rubber. 

Sourav is set to lead in his 48th Test, which will take him past Sunil Gavaskar and Mohammed Azharuddin as the ones who have led India in the most number of games. For Chappell, it marks his first Test as India coach. 

Sourav, in his own inimitable style, sought to downplay the milestone. I have learnt about this approaching milestone but to my eyes its not a major one. For me, the cricket which I have played in the past or the one which I would play in future is going to be the more satisfying one, he said. 

 Sourav has captained India in 47 Tests with 19 wins, 13 loss and 15 draws. While Gavaskar won nine, lost eight and drew 30 of his 47 Tests and Azharuddin had 14 wins and 14 loss with nine being drawn. 

Sourav said there was no pressure on his team to do well against Zimbabwe. In a match, there are going to be some guys who are going to miss out. I dont think their talent can be judged because he missed out against Zimbabwe and scored 100 against Australia. 

Its what you do over a period of time against all sorts of attack ? that is the true judge of somebodys ability, said Sourav. 

However Chappell said he was preparing the team no differently than what he had been doing so far for the one-day matches. The criteria is pretty similar. There are certain things in the game of cricket that you need to do well. 

 It is a series, which we need to win and win it well. I am happy with the preparations and the way it is going but we sure would be happy to see it translated on the field. 

Chappell found the Australians way of preparation before a match a terrific example to follow for the other teams. 

One of the great strengths of the Australian team in recent years is that no matter who they play against, they prepare the same, go through the process and continue to get better. Process is the same whomsoever you play. You got to get it right, he said. 

Chappell said there was worry about Lakshmipathy Balajis fitness who has pulled up sore after the Mutare game. 

But we have enough players to cover up for him in case the need arises, he added. Sourav stressed that he would bat at his usual number five spot in the Test. 

Zimbabwe skipper Tatenda Taibu indicated that the pitch would not be as overtly in favour of fast bowlers as it is perceived. It would offer low bounce. The spinners might get some help on the fourth and fifth day but it would be pretty much the same over the next five days. 

Taibu said he had been encouraged by the form of Dion Ebrahim and Terrence Duffin in the three-day game in Mutare. 

He also cleared Heath Streak for the match although the allrounder may have a fitness test, following surgery on a blood clot on his shin nine days ago. 

 Batsmen Terrence Duffin and Charles 

 Coventry are likely to make their debuts. (Agencies)

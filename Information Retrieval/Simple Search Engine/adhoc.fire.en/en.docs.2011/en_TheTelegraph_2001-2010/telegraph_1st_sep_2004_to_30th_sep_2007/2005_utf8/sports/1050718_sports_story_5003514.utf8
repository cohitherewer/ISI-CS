 Centres to open in September

 Bhupathi graduates to a new role with 

 academy. 

Bangalore: Indias tennis doubles star Mahesh Bhupathi is graduating to a new level by rolling out a tennis academy to show the way to budding talents. 

He will set the ball rolling in September by opening two Mahesh Bhupathi Tennis Academy (MBTA) centres in Mumbai and one in Dehradun, slated to commence from October 1. 

Three more are in the pipeline ? one each in Hyderabad, Bangalore and probably in Salem, MBTAs director (operations) Sunil Yajaman said here on Sunday. 

The initial phase would see MBTA tying up with existing tennis courts. 

Yajaman, honorary director of All India Tennis Associations coaches education programme, said MBTA would initially have a pool of 15 coaches ranging from assistant level. 

On an average, each MBTA centre can induct up to 150 wards but that may vary depending on the number of courts, added Yajaman. 

Former Davis Cupper Gaurav Natekar is also in the scheme of things; he would impart training tailor-made for entry-level, advanced and elite groups. 

Yajaman said the coaches would undergo training at a tennis village here run by Maheshs father Krishna, to ensure uniformity in coaching methods. 

Bhupathi, fresh from his mixed doubles title win at the Wimbledon partnering Mary Pierce, has left for Germany to participate in the Stuttgart Open, along with his new doubles partner Martin Damm of Czech Republic.

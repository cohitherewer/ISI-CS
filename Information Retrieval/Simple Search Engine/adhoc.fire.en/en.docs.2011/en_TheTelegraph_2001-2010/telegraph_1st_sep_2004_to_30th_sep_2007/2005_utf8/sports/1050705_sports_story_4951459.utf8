 Bidding war too close to call 

Singapore: The hottest bidding war in Olympic history looked set to go to the wire on Monday less than 48 hours before International Olympic Committee (IOC) members cast their votes for the five candidate cities. 

Members, observers and delegations from London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris were shaking their heads and declaring the vote too close to call as they gathered for the IOC session which will determine the host city for the 2012 Summer Games. 

IOC president Jacques Rogge gave away no clues at a news conference on Monday. 

Whoever wins, its going to be a prestigious city, he said. Im often asked who is going to be the winner. The winner will be the IOC. 

Rogge has repeatedly said since arriving in Singapore for the IOC session that the vote looked too close to call, a view that has found growing support in the plush hotels housing the Olympic delegations. 

Paris came to the city state of Singapore confident in their role as clear favourites.

 Manju puts India in final

 - SAFF CUP Mehtab sent off in tie vs Maldives 

Karachi: A diving header by Nanjangud Manju sent India to the final of the South Asian Football Federation Championship here on Wednesday. 

The 38th minute goal by the Mahindra United defender saw off the challenge of the Maldives and ensured India a spot in the title match for the third time in four tournaments. 

However, the team from the Indian ocean nation had much of the upper hand in the match and they even had a goal disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper Sandip Nandy. 

Mehtab Hussain was sent off for a dangerous tackle and will miss Sundays final. 

India, who were without the suspended Mehrajuddin Wadao, did not get many attacks together as skipper Bhaichung Bhutia cut a lonely figure upfront. 

They were lucky that the rival forwards did not show better finishing to convert the several chances they got. Nandy also saved at least two certain scoring opportunities by the Maldives. 

With seven minutes left for half-time, India, against the run of play, took the lead. 

Attempting to clear Shanmugam Venkateshs corner, skipper Abdul Assad Ghani only succeeded in knocking the ball across the face of the goal where it was met by Manjus diving header. 

India also had two goals disallowed. In the 70th minute, Syed Rahim Nabis header off Ajayans cross went into the net. But referee Mukhtal Al Yarimi from Yemen ruled that the ball had gone out of play before the East Bengal forward diverted it into a goal. 

Al Yarmi completed his hattrick of disallowed goals when he ruled out substitute Abdul Hakims tap in after Bhutia had fouled the Maldives keeper. (PTI)

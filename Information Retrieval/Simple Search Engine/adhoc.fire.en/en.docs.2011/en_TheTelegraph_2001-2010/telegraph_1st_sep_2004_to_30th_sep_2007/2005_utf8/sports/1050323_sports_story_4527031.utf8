 AC Milan players refuse blood tests

Milan: AC Milan players Gennaro Gattuso and Giuseppe Pancaro declined to take optional blood tests after Sunday?s Serie A game with AS Roma, leaving Italian Football Federation president Franco Carraro in a tricky position. 

Although there are no formal sanctions for refusing to give the optional blood samples, Carraro had threatened that those who declined would not be picked for the Italian national side. 

Midfielder Gattuso, who is in the Italy squad for Saturday?s World Cup qualifier against Scotland, defended his decision by saying the system was badly organised. 

?Either you do things seriously or you don?t do them at all,? Gattuso told Tuesday?s Corriere della Sera. 

?For months no-one has been seen (for blood tests) and then now they bring up this new thing. 

?At any rate, I don?t see where the problem is given that nothing is obligatory. We should plan the controls well, making them equal for all and then I would be happy to adhere.? 

Italy introduced random blood testing in January 2004 to supplement their existing compulsory urine tests. 

Carraro must now decide whether to carry out the sanction he promised last year when he said: ?Players who don?t accept blood testing will not be called up for international duty. ? 

Later speaking at the squad?s training in Florence, Italy coach Marcello Lippi backed Gattuso. (Reuters)

 Amittrajit champion

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: A soggy Chennai, hit by Cyclone Baaz, came to life with screeching tyres and revving engines at the seventh and final leg of the JK Tyre National Racing Championship, held at the MMST Track near here on Sunday. City boy Amittrajit Ghosh of Team Valvoline, who started on pole position at the Formula Maruti category (Fissme), had a red-letter day as he annexed the overall championship title with 95 points. 

In Race I, Amittrajits job was made easier by the dropping out of his main challenger, championship leader Rayomand Banajee of Pune. He had to retire with a broken shaft on lap I. 

In Race II, however, local favourite Gaurav Dalal gave Amittrajit a run for his money, scorching the track with a brilliant rally, which saw him conquer the chequered flag. Ghoshs second-place finish was enough, however, to see him clinch the crown with one point separating the two. 

Banajee, with 86 points, finished third in this category. But the Pune-based Banajee of Team Valvoline more than made it up by clinching the top honours in the Formula LGB, the premium category, with Sarosh Hataria finishing second and Ameya Walavelkar third. 

In the Esteem category, the races for which were held on Saturday, Ayub Khan emerged overall winner with 124 points, as against 113 of KE Kumar, who finished second.

 London: Manchester United, the world?s richest soccer club, reported a 54 per cent fall in half-year profits due to lower television revenue and heavy spending on players like England striker Wayne Rooney. The club is the takeover target of US billionaire Malcolm Glazer who is examining United?s finances before deciding whether to make a formal offer for the 1999 European champions.

 United?s pre-tax profits fell to ?12.4 million for the six months to January 31 from ?26.8 million. United warned last September of a profits fall of ?14 million this year because of a new Premier League broadcasting deal and the club?s third-place finish last season which cut earnings from the European Champions League this season.

 Wages rose to 46.6 percent of turnover compared to 40.8 percent in the previous first half due to the signing of Rooney and Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze, and new contracts for Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and manager Alex Ferguson.

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil striker Adriano has been ruled out of the World Cup qualifiers against Peru on Sunday and Uruguay the following Wednesday because of a knee injury. Adriano was taken off on a stretcher in the 43rd minute of the Serie A game between his club Inter Milan and Fiorentina on Sunday which the former won 3-2.

 ?The Italian club?s medical department sent the CBF (Brazilian federation) a report explaining the injury to Adriano?s right knee which makes it impossible for him to take part against Peru and Uruguay,? said the CBF on its official website. Inter said on Sunday that Adriano had a ?suspected light strain to his medial ligament on his right knee.?

 Beijing: Spanish giants Real Madrid plan to buy 30 to 40 per cent stakes in a Chinese club, Beijing Guo?an, for $3.62 million and have signed an initial agreement on the deal.

 ?The agreement is a confirmation of intentions of cooperation between the two clubs rather than a concrete contract,? said Xinhua news agency. The two clubs would carry on detailed discussions about the deal, it said. 

 ?Even if both sides strike a bargain, we still have the majority stake in Guo?an. Citic Guo?an will not withdraw from Chinese football,?

 London: World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Richard Pound has accused Major League Baseball of adopting a half-baked doping policy which insults the intelligence of the US public. In an article contributed to The New York Times, Pound said it was a disgrace that baseball authorities and players had had to be dragged before a US Congress hearing.

 ?Baseball has been dragged, kicking and screaming, into adopting a half-baked policy that is both illusory and insulting to the intelligence of the American public,? he wrote. ?Only congressional pressure forced baseball, reluctantly, into agreeing to determine if there was, in fact, a drug ?problem?.?

 Pound said the 10-day suspension for cheaters caught for the first time was part of a smokescreen that was ?insulting, worse, dangerous as matter of public health and integrity?.

 London: The world?s fastest server Andy Roddick will crank up his formidable delivery again at the Stella Artois championships in June before gunning for a first Wimbledon title, the American said. Confirming his entry into the London grasscourt event, Roddick said: ?I have some fond memories of the Stella Artois over the last couple of years and I look forward to going back.?

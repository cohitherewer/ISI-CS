 Dempo take on JCT

Margao: On Sunday, Dempo Sports Club will be looking to emerge strong from the loss of their exhilarating forward Cristiano de Lima Junior and put the right foot forward when they take on JCT in their NFL opener at the Nehru Stadium. 

Dempo, last year?s runner-up, started off the season well by winning the Federation Cup for the first time, but at the expense of potent striker Junior who died after an on-field collision with rival goalkeeper in the final. 

?He was an asset to our team. But now that he is no more we have to find a quality player to replace him upfront. At present, we have Nigerian striker Wassjiou Olalawon on trial,? coach Armando Colaco said. 

Dempo?s main strength lies in the midfield where Clifford Miranda, Jose Colaco, Riston Rodrigues, Nascimento Silveira and Lazarus Fernandes have carried the bulk of the load. With Stanley Colaco, Bolaji Majek, Valerian Rebello, Melwyn Rodrigues and Samir Naik, they have a reliable defence. (PTI)

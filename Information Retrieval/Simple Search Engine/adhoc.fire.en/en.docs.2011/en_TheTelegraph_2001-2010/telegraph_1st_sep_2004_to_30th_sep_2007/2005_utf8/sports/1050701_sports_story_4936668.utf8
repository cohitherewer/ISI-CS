 New ICC rules to debut on July 7

London: England and Australia have agreed to play next months three-match one-day NatWest Challenge under new International Cricket Council (ICC) rules introducing substitutions and new fielding regulations. 

The rules had been due to come into effect, on a trial basis, from the end of July, but will now do so on July 7 at Headingley. 

David Collier, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive, said: We are delighted that the host grounds, the players and our commercial partners have braced these new regulations. We are also delighted that Cricket Australia (CA) shares the ECBs views on this innovation. 

The ICC, hoping to make one-dayers more exciting, announced a 10-month trial earlier this month allowing teams to use one substitute during one-day Internationals. 

Fielding restrictions, currently active for the first 15 overs of an innings, will now be in place for the first 10 overs, followed by two more blocks of five overs later in the innings at the fielding captains discretion. 

Michael Brown, general manager cricket operations at CA, added: Cricket Australia is committed to continually look at ways of making our game appeal to more people. We believe these changes will add a new dimension to one-day cricket which will be embraced by the players, cricket fans, and new-comers to the game. 

The next two games of the one-day series are at Lords on July 10 and The Oval on July 12.

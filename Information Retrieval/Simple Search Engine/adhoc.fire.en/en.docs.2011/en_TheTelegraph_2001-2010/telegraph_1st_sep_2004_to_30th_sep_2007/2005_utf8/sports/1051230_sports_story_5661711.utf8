The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ACC decision next week

Karachi: The PCB is keen to host the postponed Asia Cup next September when all the teams would be available for participation. 

The meet was postponed indefinitely and there were doubts over it being held at all. But the PCB is under pressure to review their stand as the official broadcasters have threatened to move court. 

The broadcasters have paid nearly half the money as guarantee. If the Asia Cup is not held, the ACC and all four Test members would be taken to court because the meet was postponed following a decision taken by India and Pakistan, and not the ACC, said sources in the PCB. 

According to PCBs director (board operations) Saleem Altaf, a final decision on the Asia Cup would be taken during ACCs meeting in New Delhi next Tuesday and Wednesday. 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan is keen to host the tournament in September but some other board officials feel it would be too hot then and the home series against Zimbabwe would also be round the corner. 

The Asia Cup was originally scheduled in February but the PCB agreed to postpone the tournament because of the Indian teams tight schedule. The Indians will be involved in a home series against England immediately after returning from Pakistan.

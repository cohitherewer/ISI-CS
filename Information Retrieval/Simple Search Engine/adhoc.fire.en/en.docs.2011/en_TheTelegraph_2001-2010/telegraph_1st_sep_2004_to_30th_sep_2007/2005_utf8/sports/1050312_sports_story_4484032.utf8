 ?No hard feelings over Clijsters?

 Clijsters and Hewitt in happier times

Indian Wells: Lleyton Hewitt said there will be no bad feelings if he bumps into his former fiance Kim Clijsters at this week?s Pacific Life Open. 

The pair split in October last year, ending a nearly five-year relationship, and this will be the first time since then that they have appeared at the same tournament. 

?It?s something you?re going to go through,? said twice Indian Wells champion Hewitt on Thursday. ?It?s going to be different than seeing any other player, but we both have big careers to look forward to and have big goals. There?s no bad blood or bad feelings. You learn a lot about yourself in different situations. The end of last year was a tough situation mentally.? 

World number two Hewitt is now engaged to Australian actress Bec Cartwright.

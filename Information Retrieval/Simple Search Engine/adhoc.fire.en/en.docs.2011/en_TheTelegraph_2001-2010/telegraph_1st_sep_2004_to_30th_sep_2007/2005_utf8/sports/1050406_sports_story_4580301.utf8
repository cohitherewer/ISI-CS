 Moscow: Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova has been left out of Russia?s Fed Cup first-round tie against Italy later this month because of her hectic tournament schedule. Tennis Federation head and Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, who had been to Miami to try and persuade the 17-year-old to join the squad, said: ?I spoke to her father and we decided not to (include her). It is a burden to play all the tournaments in a row.?

 Tarpishchev named a squad of French Open champion Anastasia Myskina, French and US Open runner-up Elena Dementieva, Elena Bovina and Dinara Safina to begin the defence of Russia?s title. 

 London: Boris Becker will celebrate the 20th anniversary of his first stunning victory at the Stella Artois championships by playing John McEnroe on a grass court for the very first time.

 Becker, who burst onto the tennis scene by winning the 1985 Stella Artois at Queens? as a 17-year-old and then Wimbledon three weeks later, will face McEnroe in a special challenge match on June 12.

 Despite winning eight Stella Artois and six Wimbledon titles between them, Becker and McEnroe have never previously played each other on grass. 

 Denver: A female boxer died from a head injury sustained in their Colorado Golden Gloves amateur competition, the Denver county coroner?s office said.

 Becky Zerlentes, 34, of Fort Collins, died on Sunday. The preliminary cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. Zerlentes was hit by a punch from Heather Schmitz, and despite wearing protective headgear fell unconscious during the third round of a bout late Saturday. 

 London: Twice Olympic 10,000m champion Haile Gebrselassie has pulled out of the London marathon on April 17 because of an injured left Achilles tendon.

 In a statement on Tuesday, organisers said Gebrselassie?s fellow-Ethiopian and world champion Gezahegne Abera had also withdrawn from the 25th edition of the world?s most prestigious marathon with a similar injury.

 London: Chelsea will not appeal against Uefa punishments handed to the club and coach Jose Mourinho over incidents involving referee Anders Frisk during last month?s Champions League match in Barcelona.

 ?Chelsea can confirm that, following the receipt of the detailed reasons from Uefa, we will not be appealing any of the penalties imposed on the club or any individual,? the club said in a statement on Monday.

 Chelsea were fined 75,000 Swiss francs and Mourinho given a two-match touchline ban by Uefa last week. 

 Yerevan: Armenia national coach Bernard Casoni has been sacked after the team?s 0-2 loss to the Netherlands last week in a World Cup qualifier.

 ?We were very dissatisfied with the coach?s work, especially his choice of players for games and his work methods,? said Armenia federation head Ruben Hayrapetyan on Tuesday. 

 London: Feyenoord will have to play their next match in European competition behind closed doors after crowd trouble during an Uefa Cup match against Sporting Lisbon. The club said on Tuesday they had also been fined 25,000 Swiss francs ($20,600) by the European governing body.

 Maiden Test win for Bangladesh

Chittagong: Bangladesh made history by claiming their first Test victory at the 35th attempt on Monday, crushing Zimbabwe by 226 runs. 

Bangladesh, who became the world?s 10th Test team when granted Test status in 2000 but who have struggled for respectability ever since, sealed victory just before tea on the final day as 18-year-old spinner Enam-ul Haq Junior took career-best figures of six for 45. 

The players then ran towards each other to celebrate before being joined by coach Dav Whatmore and setting off on a lap of honour. 

?It?s the best day in my life,? captain Habibul Bashar said. ?I won?t forget the day I was a member of Bangladesh?s winning team. I don?t want to remember those hard days, I only want to think about the victory.? 

Zimbabwe, resuming on 46 for three and 133 for six at lunch, were dismissed for 154 in their second innings, Christopher Mpofu the last man out as he edged Haque to Mohammad Ashraful at silly point. 

The touring side were playing in their first match since having their Test status suspended last June. The ICC ruled that the team was uncompetitive following a selection dispute which sparked a walkout by a group of leading white players. 

Outside the stadium, thousands of people ran onto the streets, beating drums and waving flags and chanting ?Bangladesh, Bangladesh, cricket, cricket? and creating a logjam on the roads. 

?Zimbabwe are not as inexperienced as people say,? Bashar added. ?Their batting is good. We?ve got our confidence back.? 

Before the game, left-arm spinner Haq had taken six wickets in three Tests at an average of 57.16. 

The home side was always in control after making 488 in the first innings and taking a 176-run lead. 

They then set the Zimbabweans 381 to win and pressed home their advantage when Tapash Baisya removed Barney Rogers and Vusi Sibanda for ducks to leave the visitors on two for two. 

Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu, who had made 92 in the first innings, was the key wicket on Monday, dismissed for a duck by Man-of-the-Match Haq. 

Haq also removed Hamilton Masakadza, caught and bowled for 56. 

The second and final Test begins on Friday. 

Bangladesh had managed three draws in their previous 34 tests ? two of them against Zimbabwe and one against West Indies. Two of those encounters, however, were badly affected by rain.

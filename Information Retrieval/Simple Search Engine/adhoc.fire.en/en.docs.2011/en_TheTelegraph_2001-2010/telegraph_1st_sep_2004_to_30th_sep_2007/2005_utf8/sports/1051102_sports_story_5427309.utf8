Paris: Argentine Guillermo Corias run in the Paris Masters came to an abrupt end on Tuesday as he bowed out to Czech Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-2. 

Second seed Coria, who would have secured a Masters Cup berth with a victory, looked clumsy and made a string of unforced errors. 

Berdych, who had beaten fellow Czech Jiri Novak in the first round, capitalised on his opponents mistakes and earned three match points when Coria netted a backhand. 

Coria saved the first two with service winners but on the third Berdych fired a backhand pass down the line to seal victory in just over an hour. 

Currently in sixth place in the ATP Champions race, Coria can still win one of the two remaining tickets to Shanghai. 

His fate now depends on how the other eight contenders fare in Paris. 

Russias Nikolay Davydenko, however, stayed on course for a Masters Cup berth at the year-end when he crushed former champion Greg Rusedski 6-2, 6-2 in the second round. 

Davydenko, seeded third, needed just 59 minutes to move past Rusedski, who won the indoor tournament in 1998. 

A semi-finalist at this years French Open, Davydenko sits in seventh place in the ATP Champions race and will qualify for the eight-strong seasons finale from November 13 in Shanghai if he can hold on to that spot. 

The 32-year-old Rusedski, who scored a memorable win over Pete Sampras in the final here seven years ago, was never in contention against Davydenko. (REUTERS)

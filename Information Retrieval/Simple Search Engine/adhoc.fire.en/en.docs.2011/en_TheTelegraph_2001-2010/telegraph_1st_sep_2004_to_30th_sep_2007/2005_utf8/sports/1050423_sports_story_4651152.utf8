The Telegraph - Calcutta

 The coaching badge factor

New Delhi: Vivian Richards on Friday indicated that though he lacked experience, he was well equipped to handle the job of a coach. 

Richards did not directly say whether he would consider an offer to coach the Indian team, but made it clear that he had a sound knowledge of the game. 

?I have not got a coaching badge, I am reluctant to go for one,? Richards said. 

?But what I have is the experience of playing 124 Tests. I know that I have a sound knowledge of the game? 

?There is nothing wrong in having a foreign coach. The game is getting globalised and this way we can learn from each other,? Richards added. (PTI)

Sydney: Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes he has played a part in damaging the confidence of Matthew Hayden, who is struggling to regain form, but is now keen to watch the Australian opener in full flight ? against other teams. 

?We had very good plans against him, about where to place our fielders and how to bowl to him. We were successful, but I do miss watching him bat now,? Harbhajan was quoted as saying by The Sydney Morning Herald on Friday. 

?I am disappointed because I love watching him against other teams, with his body language and the way he bats, and I hope he finds his form again soon,? said the bowler. 

Meanwhile, Australian vice-captain and one-day opener Adam Gilchrist threw his support behind Hayden. 

Hayden, the established opener with Gilchrist, was dumped in favour of lower-order batsman Michael Clarke just before the match following a run of poor form. (Agencies)

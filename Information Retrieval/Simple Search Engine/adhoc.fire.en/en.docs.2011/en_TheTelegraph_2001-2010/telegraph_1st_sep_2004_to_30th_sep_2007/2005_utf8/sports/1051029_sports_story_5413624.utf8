 Best remains serious

London: Manchester United great Denis Law wept on Friday after visiting his old teammate George Best in a London hospital, where he remains seriously ill. 

The clubs manager Alex Ferguson said everyone at United was praying for Best, who is in intensive care suffering from internal bleeding thought to be linked to an infection. 

Hes been fighting for quite a while but I did get a shock, former United striker Law said after visiting the Cromwell hospital. The mans not looking too good. 

Bests doctor Roger Williams said he had shown some signs of improvement overnight but remained seriously ill. He is a little better than he was last night, but he is still a very sick man, Williams said. 

Everyone at the club is praying and hoping he pulls through this recent dip in his health, Ferguson told reporters in Manchester on Friday. 

He has had a lot of problems over the last few years and we are all rooting for him and hope he pulls through.

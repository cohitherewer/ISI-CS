The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tie put off till April

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Owing to concerns about player workloads, 

 the second tsunami fund-raiser between the Asia XI and ICC 

 XI, slated to be held at Eden Gardens on February 13, has 

 been postponed until the second half of April. The decision 

 was arrived at after International Cricket Council?s discussions 

 with its member countries, the Asian Cricket Council and 

 players? representatives. 

 The ACC executive board will meet on Monday in Dubai 

 to discuss the issue. The first match at the MCG had raised 

 over $11 million. 

?On reviewing the proposed date of February 13, it became apparent that there were serious workload issues for many of the players who have indicated a desire to play in this tie. At that time, England will still be in South Africa and Australia?s series against New Zealand will be about to begin,? ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed was quoted as saying in a press release. 

The ACC was left with two alternatives, according to its president Jagmohan Dalmiya. ?Either to go ahead with the match on the scheduled date with second-string players or to postpone the match. The first alternative was not acceptable since the cricket loving public would be deprived of seeing the best players in action. Therefore, the ICC desired that the Cricket for Humanity match be postponed,? Dalmiya said at a press conference this evening. 

 The ICC was aware of the inconvenience it would cause 

 to the hosts. ?There is never an easy time to fit in an 

 additional match but this fundraising initiative is very 

 important to us all,? Speed said. ?We?re accepting it for 

 goodwill. There?s no reason to believe it as a step-motherly 

 treatment. ?

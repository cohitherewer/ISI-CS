The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Super selectors likely to meet in India

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Sunil Gavaskar 

 and his fellow selectors (Clive Lloyd, Sir Richard Hadlee, 

 Aravinda de Silva, Michael Atherton and Jonty Rhodes) are 

 likely to meet in India by May 10 to shortlist 30 players 

 each for the World XIs that will feature in the Super Series 

 against Australia. 

Confirmation may come before the week is out. 

The first-ever International Cricket Council (ICC)-sanctioned Super Series is going to showcase three ODIs ? October 5,7 and 9 in Melbourne ? and the October 14-19 Super Test in Sydney. 

All four matches have official status. 

 According to The Telegraph?s 

 sources, the 30 players for each form will be reduced to 

 20 around the middle of July, with the final 14 selected 

 by mid-August. 

While the Test is going to be at the SCG, the ODIs will be at the Docklands Stadium and not the MCG. 

Significantly, chief selector Gavaskar and the rest won?t name the captains when the pool of 30 is picked. In fact, it?s not clear whether that?s even going to be done when the number is pruned to 20 in each form. 

Unless an injury rules him out, the Australians are bound to be led by the redoubtable Ricky Ponting. Cricket Australia, by the way, hasn?t yet been set a deadline for either the preliminary pool or the final 14. 

As already announced, the World XI selectors aren?t bound to follow the ICC rankings in choosing the teams. However, they will have to bear in mind that nobody is going to be ineligible on account of any ban coinciding with the Super Series. 

 Incidentally, edition No. 2 of 

 the ICC?s annual awards is scheduled to be held in the lead-up 

 to the Super Test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dream come true for a British fan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Patrick Cummings? dream is about to come true. The Briton, an avid cricket fan, has for long wanted to watch an India-Pakistan Test at a packed Eden Gardens. Well, the turnout may not be bigger than 55,000 (according to a CAB estimate) on Wednesday, but the 30-year-old will surely be at the ground to witness the action on Day I of the second Test. 

The day the BCCI announced that the originally planned Ahmedabad Test was being shifted to Calcutta, Cummings got into the ?act?. 

?I got to know that Bablu Kolay is the joint secretary of the Cricket Association of Bengal and so e-mailed my request to arrange a pass for me,? Cummings told The Telegraph on Tuesday after collecting his ticket. 

?My dream will come true on Wednesday? I?ll be there before the first ball is delivered at 9.30 am,? said Cummings. 

Despite coming from a country which is part of an age-old cricket rivalry with the Australians, Cummings feels an Indo-Pak clash at the Eden is bigger than anything else in cricket. ?This contest is a much bigger occasion than the Ashes,? he said. 

He has seen (on television), read and heard about the huge crowds that throng to the Eden every time an international match is staged there. The low level of interest this time around has surprised. 

Cummings, who runs an educational trust in England, plans to share his Eden experience with the children under his guidance.

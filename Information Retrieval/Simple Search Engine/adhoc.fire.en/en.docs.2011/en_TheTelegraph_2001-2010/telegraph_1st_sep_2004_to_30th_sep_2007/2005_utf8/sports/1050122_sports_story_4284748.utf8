The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Soumyajit, Jayita best

Chennai: Soumyajit Ghosh and Jayita Pushilal of Central of Excellence (CoE), Calcutta, claimed the sub-junior boys? and girls? titles, respectively, in the 66th national sub-junior and inter-state table tennis championships here Friday. 

Sourav Saha of the Petroleum Sports Promotion Board and Nikhat Banu of Andhra Pradesh won the cadet boys and girls titles, beating Maharashtra?s Sanmay Paranjpe (11-2, 8-11,11-5, 11-8,11-3) and V. Sneha of Tamil Nadu (11-4, 11-5, 5-11, 13-11, 11-7), respectively. 

In the sub-junior boys? final Ghosh, last year?s cadet champion, excelled with his deep forehand smashes and defensive jabs to great effect in scoring a straight 4-0 win over Jenil Shah of Gujarat. 

Jenil was lucky to have progressed to the final, mainly because top-seeded Sushovan Das of CoE was debarred as being over-aged. Shah made a lot of unforced errors before losing 8-11, 6-11, 9-11, 7-11. 

The sub-junior girls final, on the other hand, turned to be a long drawn one as Pushilal and Shreya Ghosh (both CoE) fought tooth and nail. Pushilal beat Ghosh 4-11, 11-4, 8-11, 12-10, 9-11, 11-8, 11-8.

 Stakes high for United, Porto and Milan

London: The stakes are high for former European champions Manchester United, Porto and AC Milan in this weeks penultimate round of Champions League group matches. 

All three are making heavy weather of reaching the last 16 with Porto facing certain elimination if they lose at home to Rangers in group H on Wednesday. 

A loss for United at home to Villarreal on Tuesday, combined with a victory for Lille over Benfica, will leave them scrapping for a Uefa Cup place from group D. 

AC Milan face a testing night in Istanbul on Wednesday against Fenerbahce where defeat would leave the six-time European champions struggling to emerge from a tight group E. 

Nerves are less fraught for some of Europes other big guns with holders Liverpool and group G rivals Chelsea both set to book their places in the last 16 on Wednesday. 

Barcelona, Arsenal, Olympique Lyon and Real Madrid have already qualified for the knockout phase. 

Liverpool need just a point at home to Real Betis while English champions Chelsea will move through to the next round with victory over pointless Anderlecht. 

Juventus and Bayern Munich can also take their places in the last 16 in home matches against Club Brugge and Rapid Vienna, respectively, in group A. 

Juventus need just a point, while Bayern will go through with a victory as long as the Italians do not lose to Brugge. 

Unsettled midfielder Michael Ballack is likely to miss Bayerns clash against bottom club Rapid with a thigh injury suffered in Germanys friendly against France. 

Four-time winners Ajax are one group B victory away from the knockout phase and should manage that against Sparta Prague, while Inter Milan need just a point against Artmedia Bratislava to emerge from group H. 

PSV Eindhoven are also in pole position in group E and will clinch a top-two berth with victory at Schalke on Wednesday, irrespective of how Milan fare against Fenerbahce. 

Philip Cocu is doubtful after missing the weekends 4-4 draw at RKC Waalwijk, while American DaMarcus Beasley is out with a hamstring injury. 

Bottom with three points, Porto will hope to benefit from the pressure building on Rangers manager Alex McLeish after a 0-3 defeat by arch-rivals Celtic left them hopelessly adrift in the Scottish Premier League at the weekend. 

Porto will also take heart from the absence of Rangers Croatian striker Dado Prso who damaged a hamstring in the morale-sapping defeat at Celtic Park. 

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson describes Tuesdays home match against Villarreal as one of the most important in Europe for us over the last few years. 

It is 10 years since United failed to progress from the group stage, although with Villarreals Argentine playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme missing with a thigh injury, the under-pressure Scot should sleep a little easier. 

Milans unease at a return to Istanbul, scene of their astonishing final defeat by Liverpool in May, will not have been placated by a 1-3 loss to Fiorentina in Serie A on Sunday. 

Wednesdays group F clash between group leaders Olympique Lyon and Real Madrid in the Bernabeu will give the Spanish club the perfect chance to erase the memory of Saturdays 0-3 defeat by Barcelona. 

Madrid captain Raul will have to wait to become the first player to make 100 appearances in the Champions League since it began in 1992 after the striker was ruled out for around two months with a complex knee injury. 

Raul suffered a partial tear of the cruciate ligament in his left knee against Barca and requires specialist treatment.

 Bengal in final, to take on Tamil Nadu 

Tiruchirapalli: Last years runners-up Bengal trounced Services 3-0 to enter the final of the 14th national youth (U-21) football championship for the Dutta Roy Trophy on Sunday. 

In the final on Tuesday Bengal take on Tamil Nadu. 

Bengal dominated play from the start with striker Seikh Habib Ali finding the net in the third minute. 

Lal Kamal Bhowmick made it 2-0 in the eighth minute. Habib Ali struck again in the 31st minute. 

Both Bengal and Services dished out insipid fare in the second half, missing a host of scoring opportunities. Services, especially, lacked the finishing touch.

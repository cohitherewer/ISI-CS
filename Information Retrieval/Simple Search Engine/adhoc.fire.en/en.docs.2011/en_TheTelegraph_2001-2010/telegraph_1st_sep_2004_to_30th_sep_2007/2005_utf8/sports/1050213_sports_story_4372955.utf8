The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rawat, Srikkanth run riot

A STAFF REPORTER

 Srikkanth hit a gutsy 88 

Calcutta: Openers Ankit Rawat and Anirudh Srikkanth scored unbeaten 76 and 88 runs, respectively, as India under-19 coasted to a ten-wicket victory over their England counterparts at the Eden on Saturday. The win also helped them clinch the series 3-1, before the final one-dayer in Siliguri on Monday. 

Anirudh, the son of former India opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth, stole the limelight with his explosive innings which came off only 74 balls and dincluded 13 boundaries and three sixes. The Tamil Nadu batsman did not meet with much success in the first two games in Agartala and was dropped for Friday?s match. But he made most of the opportunity that came his way on Saturday. 

A swept six, few wristy shots square of the wicket, coupled with his flamboyant approach earned him the Man of the Match award. Quicksilver reflexes aid his style, but he often commits himself to shots when he shouldn?t h ave. Experience will certainly make him wiser, otherwise he runs the risk of falling easy prey to the guile of good bowlers on seaming wickets. 

Saturday, too, his propensity to go for early shots could have cost him dear had he not survived a chance early at slip. Undeterred he, however, tore through the English attack with consummate ease. This English side hardly possesses the ability to trouble the Indian batsmen and the two openers never found the going tough, wrapping up the match with 21 overs to spare. 

Coach Venkatesh Prasad spoke of the need to make nets more enjoyable to the players with match-simulated situations. The exercise has certainly started to pay off with the players showing the right attitude and mental toughness in a crisis. 

The visiting batsmen faltered in the morning and that made their task even more difficult. Off-spinner Rohit Sharma returned the most successful with three wickets. The England batsmen have struggled against spinners right through this tour and the story was no different. 

Opener John Denly was the only successful, with a 80 off 129 balls. The innings hardly proved effective with the lack of support at the other end.

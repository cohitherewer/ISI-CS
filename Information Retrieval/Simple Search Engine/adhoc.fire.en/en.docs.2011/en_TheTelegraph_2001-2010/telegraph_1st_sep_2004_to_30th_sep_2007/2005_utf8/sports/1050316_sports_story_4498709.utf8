Calcutta: A wry smile hung on Inzamam-ul Haq?s lips as he left the media conference at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. If Pakistan had gained from the Mohali experience, he wasn?t showing it, merely trying to hide his feelings. 

Late Tuesday night it was learnt that Shahid Afridi 

will replace Salman Butt. 

?India are the more experienced side? We still have 

a lot of hard work ahead of us,? the visiting captain said. 

The fact, however, remains that the underdogs have suddenly got overexcited while the favourites have the tag of ?lacking killer instinct? woven around them. 

The hint of green on the wicket had kept the hosts undecided about the XI, but the mowers were back in action in the afternoon and that should pave the way for the return of Harbhajan Singh. Zaheer Khan will then have to sit out. 

The Indians cannot expect a hard wicket at the Eden. The nature of the soil here is such that it hardly encourages much bounce after the second day and the spinners? role will assume greater significance. 

Even during the last Test here, versus South Africa in November-December, Harbhajan and Anil Kumble had spun India to victory. Sourav himself spoke of the wicket not retaining much moisture in the hot and humid climes ? another good reason for going in with two spinners. 

The visitors? problems have been compounded by the shoulder injury to Rana Naved-ul Hasan. Mohammed Khalil will replace him. 

 The opening blues have been Pakistan?s bane for sometime now, though it has been attributed to their constant chopping and changing policy. Inzamam acknowledged the problem, saying ?we are trying to unearth good openers through academies. The ones here are young and still learning. They will be better with experience.? 

The top-order flop show caused a lot of distress in the first Test and it is likely that Yasir Hameed or Shahid Afridi will come in for Salman Butt. Whatever new life the Kamran Akmals, Abdul Razzaqs and Asim Kamals may have infused into the side, the top-tier has to deliver. 

India doesn?t have to contend with such issues. Virender Sehwag?s presence at the top sets the tone for the innings, and unless Pakistan find ways to curb his exploits, they will struggle to harbour much hope in this series. The Delhiite showed glimpses of his form during his ninth Test century in Mohali and Calcuttans are hoping the blitzkrieg continues. 

Sehwag spent much time on Tuesday tackling the spinners at nets, probably taking into account the Danish Kaneria threat. 

Whatever Sehwag unleashes over the next five days, Sachin Tendulkar will have to carry the burden of expectations of completing his 35th century here. It grew once he fell for 94 in Mohali and is expected to reach a crescendo as the moment draws near. For his part, the Master Blaster didn?t show any signs of his being affected by it all. 

Amid all the growing demands, Sourav remains cool. He was an early bird at practice Tuesday morning, getting down to work with the Shib Shankar Pauls and the Ranadeb Boses. 

For the dress rehearsal, there was the short-pitched stuff aimed at his rib cage, the defensive shots, et al. For the record, he is yet to get a hundred on his home turf. 

?When you play for India there is pressure to perform anywhere in the world? I?ve been trying to score a hundred here for the last five Tests but it has just has not happened. I?ll go out there and stay positive and hopefully it will come this time,? the Team India captain said. 

Pakistan?s unbeaten record at the Eden is another cause for inspiration for Inzamam amp; Co. But, as Sourav always stresses, this Indian team is adept at rewriting history. Maybe another opportunity awaits the Indians.

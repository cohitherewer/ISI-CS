 Sporting trounce Dempo

 Dudu Omagbemi scored a brace 

Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa exploited the jittery rival defence to score a thumping 4-0 win over fellow-Goan outfit Dempo and moved up to third place in the National Football League for ONGC Cup on Wednesday. 

Sporting, who changed their plan and fielded three men upfront, reaped rich dividend as Nigerian imports Dudu Omagbemi and Edeh Chidi literally toyed with the rival defence and scored a brace each at the Nehru Stadium. 

Dempo, who played without conviction, did not have a clear look at the rival goal except for a long ranger by Riston Rodrigues. 

With the curtains coming down on the first phase of the championship, holders East Bengal lead the table with 24 points from 11 matches. 

Dempo, who suffered their second defeat, were three points adrift of the leaders while Sporting are placed third with 20 points from 11 matches.

 Sourav hits century, Bengal take lead

 Sourav Ganguly

Pune: Sourav Ganguly continued to display tremendous form when he hit a big hundred for Bengal in the first innings of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match against Maharashtra here on Friday, which helped his team gain a slender lead of 28 runs. 

In a stay of 384 minutes at the crease, the Bengal southpaw, who was involved in a partnership of 160 runs with Rohan Gavaskar for the sixth wicket, made 159 runs from 227 balls with 17 boundaries. 

Resuming on his overnight score of 81, Sourav reached the three figure mark without much problem and was involved in another small partnership of 44 runs for seventh wicket with all-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who made 42 runs. 

Chasing Maharashtras first innings score of 350, Bengal suffered early blows, but it was Souravs innings, which saw his team take the slender first innings lead. 

His two partnerships of 160 and 44 runs with Rohan and Shukla respectively in the middle order helped Bengal to post a total of 378. 

Fast bowler Munaf Patel was the most successful bowler for Maharashtra. He dismantled Souravs stump with a beauty and then picked up three other Bengal batsmen to end the day with figures off four for 104 in 31.5 overs. 

Maharashtra were precariously placed in the second innings at the score of 101 for the loss of three wickets. 

Both the openers Mansingh Nigde and Yogesh Pawar were back in the pavilion after making 30 and 39 runs respectively. Abhijit Kale was out for zero. 

Captain Hrishikesh Kanitkar was not out on 22 and Dhruv Mohan on one. Bengal spinner Saurashis Lahiri scalped two wickets.

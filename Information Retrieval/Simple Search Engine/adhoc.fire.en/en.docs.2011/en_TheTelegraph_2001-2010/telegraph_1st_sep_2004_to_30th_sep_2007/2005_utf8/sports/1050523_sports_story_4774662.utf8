 Topalov beats Kramnik, takes title

 - SOFIA MASTERS 

 Draw takes Anand to second-place finish 

 Topalov, who was in devastating form in the second half of this event, recorded his fourth win in 

 five rounds 

Sofia: Viswanathan Anand ensured a second place finish after he was held to a draw by Hungarian Judit Polgar while local stalwart Veselin Topalov pocketed the title with a fine win over Russian Vladimir Kramnik in the 10th and final round of MTel Masters chess tournament on Sunday. 

Topalov, who was in devastating form in the second half of this category-20 double round robin event, recorded his fourth win in five rounds to take his total points tally to 6.5, a full point clear of Anand. 

The other game of the last round between Britains Michael Adams and former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine was still going on at the time of going to press and if it ends in a draw, Anand would take sole second place in the standings. 

Anand tried hard to beat Polgar in a Sicilian Taimanov game where the latter played black. 

Playing the most popular variation in the opening, Polgar could not quite equalise in the middle game but her defence was quite good, especially when her pieces appeared to be a bit passive. 

The position became absolutely closed and Anand walked his king over to the queenside before uncorking an exchange sacrifice to retain some hopes of winning. 

However, as the position was, Polgar did not succumb to pressure and brought all her pieces to guide against a possible onslaught. 

Anand did not take long to realise that the blacks defence was very perfect and the players repeated the position to sign peace in 45 moves. 

Playing black, Topalov needed just a draw to clinch the title, after Anands result. 

But the Bulgarian relentlessly fought for an advantage and in the end succeeded after a rather poor show by Kramnik. It was a Sicilian Nazdorf wherein Kramnik went for unorthodox variation after employing the English attack and Topalov soon had the dynamic balance he was looking for on board. 

Topalov then guided his forces to most effective squares and once he won a queenside pawn there was nothing that could stop him. 

In the ninth round, Anand outmanoeuvred Adams for his second win of the tournament (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). That win helped the Indian jump to the sole second spot after Topalov outclassed Ponomariov. 

Saturdays other game, between Hungarian Judit Polgar and Russian Vladimir Kramnik ended in a draw. 

The Petroff opening is known for its solid impact at all levels and Adams learned it the hard way. Playing white, the English employed the main line and was outdone from an almost equal position in the middle game. 

Securing a passed pawn in the centre, Adams thought he was at least equal but Anand had other plans as he trapped whites Bishop on the edge of the board with his pawn mass and thereafter Adams fought a lost battle. Getting two pawns but no hope after losing the material, Adams later allowed Anands queen to penetrate the kingside and it was all over. The game lasted 60 moves. 

If Adams suffered his third loss in four days, Topalov registered his third victory in as much time. Starting off a bit shakily in the event, Topalov is now a firm contender for the title for which he just requires a draw in the final round. 

Ponomariov was no match for Topalov in this engrossing encounter. Playing the queens Indian defence, the Ukrainian simply did not know what hit him when Topalov went for a direct attack against his king after first sacrificing a rook and then a knight. The end came soon and in just 26 moves Topalov emerged a winner. 

Kramnik drew with Polgar in another Petroff game of the day that lasted 44 moves. Going for exchanges at regular intervals the Russian was in no trouble whatsoever with his black pieces and reached a drawn knight and pawns endgame in quick time. (PTI)

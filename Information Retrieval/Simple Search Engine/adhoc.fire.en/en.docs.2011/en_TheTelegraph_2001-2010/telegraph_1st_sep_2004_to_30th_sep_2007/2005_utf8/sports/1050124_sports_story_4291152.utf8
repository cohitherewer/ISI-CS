The Telegraph - Calcutta

 CA regrets delay in informing Pakistan

Sydney: Cricket Australia on Sunday regretted for sitting for two weeks on an information about allegations of rape against a member of the Pakistan team touring Down Under. 

CA said it could not act on the information because it was busy with the tsunami fund-raiser match in Melbourne earlier this month. 

[That the CA was aware of the incident, but kept quiet was reported by The Telegraph on Saturday.] 

?Clearly, we should have told them (Pakistan),? CA?s spokesperson Peter Young said. 

?I was told by a police officer, who was telling me about a third-hand conversation that no one was supposed to hear about. 

?But we should have let them (Pakistani team management) know,? he said. 

Young said he learned of the allegation two weeks ago while ?comparing notes? on dealing with sexual assault claims with a member of the Victorian police force. 

Young said he informed the rest of CA management, including chief executive James Sutherland, about the allegation, but no one alerted Pakistani management because CA?s resources were stretched in organising the tsunami relief match on January 10. 

?It is no excuse for not acting on other stuff, but the urgent priority was sorting out the tsunami match,? he was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald. 

Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid refused to comment on whether the touring party was angry at not being informed about the brewing storm. 

?We are having a good relationship with Cricket Australia at the moment, so I don?t want to say anything,? he said.

 Off-field trials may hasten retirement, says Warne

London: Shane Warne admits the problems hes faced off the field will hasten his retirement. 

Having emerged from another sex scandal ? which ultimately led to a split from his wife ? to join his Australian teammates for the upcoming Ashes series, Warne said he was keen to return. 

But with the trials of his private life, he now can envision himself stopping before he might have previously. 

I definitely think itll make me play shorter, he said, without specifying why or when he would retire. Id rather not go into what they are but Ill probably play shorter for those reasons. Im not sure when that is. 

At 35, Warne doesnt plan to play in another Ashes series in England, by which time he will be approaching 40. 

Last month, Warne and his wife Simone said they were splitting. Warnes contract with an Australian broadcaster also was cancelled after widespread reports of his extramarital affair involving a 25-year-old student in England, the latest scandal in a long history of lurid media coverage detailing Warnes infidelities. 

The worlds leading wicket-taker said the controversy hasnt affected his ability to return to the Australian squad ahead of the first Test, which starts at Lords Thursday. 

Its been great to be back with the lads. Theyve all been very supportive of me and I think theyre enjoying having me back, contrary to what some people think, Warne said. 

And, while he admitted it would be difficult, he was confident the drama would have no bearing on his form. 

The tougher the situation the better I generally respond, he said. Nothing like this has ever happened in my life before and its not the way I obviously wanted it to be. Theyre things I have to deal with and hope I can deal with them the best way I can and I can concentrate on the cricket and be there for the guys, which Im sure I can. 

Its a period in your life that nobody would like to be made public, some things should remain private, but unfortunately thats the way the world works these days, he added. You have some good days and some bad ones. Some days youre trying to move on and youre moving on, and on other days, its tough to move on ... But I have to. (AP)

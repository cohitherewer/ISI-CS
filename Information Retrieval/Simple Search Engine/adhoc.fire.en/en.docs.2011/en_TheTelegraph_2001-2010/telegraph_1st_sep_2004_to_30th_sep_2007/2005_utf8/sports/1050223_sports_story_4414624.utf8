 Cricket Online 

Ravi Shastri

 I am a mediumpacer. After completing my first 

spell, I often fail to strike the right line and length and prove to be expensive. 

Please help.

(Rishi Subba, 17, Darjeeling)

Work on your fitness. Your action is obviously getting 

faulty because of tiredness and loss in concentration.

I am a right-handed batsman. I am generally 

solid in defence, but whenever I try any big hits I get caught near the boundary. 

Please help.

(Nitesh Sharma, 20, Midnapore)

The big shot is not all about power. It entails timing 

as well. So watch the execution of your shot closely.

I am a left-handed batsman and am very weak 

on the leg side against mediumpacers. Please help.

(Ankan Raj, 16, Bardhaman)

Try and open up your stance a bit. Check your grip 

as well.

I am a right-arm mediumpacer. I often fail to 

hit the right line when bowling an inswinger. Please help.

(Surojit Roy, 17, Hooghly)

Don?t fall away too quickly in your action. Make sure 

you have a still head and watch the spot you want the ball to land.

I am a mediumpacer. Recently I?ve changed my 

action and my pace has decreased a lot. How can I bowl at my old pace again?

(Soumyajyoti Mukherjee, 14, Calcutta-68)

Go back to your old action. And work on your strength 

training as well.

I am a mediumpacer. Whenever I try to deliver 

a yorker, the ball falls short of the right length. Please help.

(Ramen Dey, 18, Calcutta-15)

It?s a ball that demands a lot of practice. Try and 

watch the centre of middle stump when you decide to bowl and see if it makes a 

difference.

How does one read the top-spinner coming out 

of the bowler?s hand?

(Tapas Pal, 16, Nagpur)

Watching the ball coming out of the bowler?s hand 

and its rotations will help.

I am a mediumpacer. How does one bowl the off-cutter?

(Raj Sharma, 19, Calcutta-69)

Roll your fingers across the seam in a clockwise direction 

if you are a right-arm bowler and the opposite if you are a left-armer.

I am a right-handed batsman. I often get bowled 

or am adjudged leg before when attempting the flick. Please help.

(Debajit Roy, 17, Calcutta-42)

Don?t lift your head too early and watch the ball 

onto the bat when you are meeting it.

How does one prepare on the night before an 

important match?

(Debashish Sen, 21, Calcutta-16)

Get a good night?s rest and don?t allow negative thoughts 

to come to your mind.

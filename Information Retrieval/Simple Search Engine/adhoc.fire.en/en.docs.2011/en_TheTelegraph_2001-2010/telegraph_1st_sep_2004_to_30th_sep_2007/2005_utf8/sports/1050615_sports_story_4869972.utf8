London: Indian spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh claimed six wickets between them as MCC XI defeated International XI by 112 runs in the Lords tsunami match on Tuesday. 

Kumble took three for 49 in his eight overs while Harbhajan, who is also playing his maiden county season for Surrey, chipped in with three for 32 as the Brian Lara-led side collapsed to 215 all out in 35 overs. 

Chasing a stiff target of 328 to win, International XI failed to get a good start as they lost opener Virender Sehwag (5) cheaply, with the team score reading 10 for one. 

South African captain Graeme Smith (68) then built a 56-run partnership with Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya (21) before Kumble struck in the 11th over for his first scalp. 

With their backs to the wall, Lara (42) came into bat and immediately took the attack to the opponents, hitting two successive fours of Jacques Kallis and then hoisting the Indian leg-spinner for a six. 

The West Indian batsman also hit five fours in his 27-ball knock but when he was looking like running away with the match, Kumble struck again forcing Lara to give a simple catch to Shoaib Akhtar. 

Indian vice-captain Rahul Dravid tried to make a match of it but he was foxed by Harbhajan on 18 and then Chris Gayle (three for 28) ran through the lower order to complete a comprehensive win. 

Earlier, Stephen Fleming, Jacques Kallis and Andy Flower hit impressive half-centuries to guide the MCC XI to a mammoth 327 for seven in 50 overs. 

Both Fleming and Kallis struck 62 each and former Zimbabwe captain Flower made a quickfire 55 off 40 balls in the match which saw regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly making 14 and V.V.S. Laxman scoring almost run-a-ball 47. 

Sourav, a late replacement for Ramnaresh Sarwan, came first down and in the company of Fleming, took the teams score past the half-century mark before he was castled by the Sri Lankan seamer. 

Proceeds from this match will be shared between five charities, including the British Red Cross and the Foundation of Goodness, which has been working in southern Sri Lanka for six years and is supported by Muralitharan and Warne. 

It means a lot to be involved, said Sangakkara. We were in New Zealand when the tsunami struck. The guys switched their phones on after a match and a couple of texts came through saying there had been a bit of flooding in Colombo. 

But switching on to CNN and BBC that night really drove home what had happened. It became more devastating every day as the death toll mounted. All Sri Lankans are in it collectively, and its special to be able to help like this. 

Kumble also revealed how he and his family only narrowly escaped after leaving their Chennai holiday home minutes before the wave struck the city. 

About 10 minutes before the tsunami hit, I checked out, said Kumble. I was at the reception, totally ignorant about what had happened. Our cottage was about 60 metres from the beach and it did get affected, so I consider myself very lucky, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav satisfies Greg Chappell

 - 15-minute hit for regular captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday 

Bangalore: Till the elements took centrestage Thursday afternoon, scuppering the first full-fledged nets for the Team India probables, the talking point was regular captain Sourav Gangulys 15-minute hit in coach Greg Chappells presence. 

Im not one to judge anybody on nets and, so, I wont speak about how I felt batting. However, Greg didnt say anything negative and, so, I assume he was satisfied, Sourav told The Telegraph shortly before catching the last flight for Calcutta. 

Among others, he faced Zaheer Khan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Harbhajan Singh. Incidentally, the last named got caught in yet controversy, the other day, at the end of his stint with Surrey. 

Sourav added: More than nets, its important to regularly play matches... I wont be around for the three practice games (among the probables), but Ill be playing for Glamorgan till July 24... 

The ongoing (final) camp ends on July 19. 

Chappell, who was keen on Sourav being present for the first two days, had a word with him after nets. Later, both probably viewed the video recording of those 15 minutes. 

Obviously, the coach is going to compare the latest footage with recordings of some of Souravs better innings, particularly on the 2003-04 tour of Australia. 

Talking exclusively, Chappell said: Given the amount of travelling Sourav has put in over the past couple of days, his body-clock was... He tried a few things and, in the circumstances, definitely did okay. 

Whatever the activity, Chappell wants excellence.

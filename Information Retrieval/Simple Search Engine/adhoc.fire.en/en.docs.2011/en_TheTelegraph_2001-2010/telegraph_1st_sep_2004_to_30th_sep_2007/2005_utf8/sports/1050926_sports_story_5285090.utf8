 Greg peeved at e-mail leak

Mumbai: Greg Chappell expressed his disappointment that a private and confidential e-mail that he had sent from Zimbabwe to BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra did not remain secret. 

I sent a private and confidential e-mail to the president of BCCI. It did not remain confidential though I would have preferred it to have remained so. At this stage I cannot say much on the matter. I think you (media) get a lot excited at such happenings. It is a fairly normal thing happening in cricket. So things change and sometime in future we can talk about it, Chappell said after arriving from Zimbabwe early on Sunday. 

Chappell was effusive in his praise of the youngsters, particularly opener Gautam Gambhir, pace bowler Irfan Pathan and wicketkeepers M. S. Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik. 

He also praised the performance of two other youngsters, Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh, in the one-day format of the game. 

Pathan did very well in both one-dayers and Tests, and especially in the latter. I think the role model for him is (Sri Lankas) Chaminda Vaas, someone who bowls well in the subcontinent, he said. 

In the eye of a controversy over his remarks on Sourav, is hoping to squeeze in a short camp ahead of the one-day series at home against Sri Lanka next month. (AGENCIES)

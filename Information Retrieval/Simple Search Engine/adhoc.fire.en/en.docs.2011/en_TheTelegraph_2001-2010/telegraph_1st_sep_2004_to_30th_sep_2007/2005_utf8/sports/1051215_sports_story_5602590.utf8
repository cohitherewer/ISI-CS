 Sao Paulo in final

 - World Club Championship 

 Amoroso after scoring one of his two goals on Wednesday 

Tokyo: Striker Amoroso scored twice as South American champions Sao Paulo beat Saudi Arabias Al Ittihad 3-2 on Wednesday to reach Fifas World Club Championship final. 

Sao Paulo goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni was also on target in a pulsating game in Tokyo the Brazilian club never seriously looked like losing, despite Ittihads brave resistance. 

European champions Liverpool take on Costa Ricas Deportivo Saprissa in Thursdays second semi-final in Yokohama. The final takes place in Yokohama on Sunday. 

Amoroso gave Sao Paulo the lead in the 16th minute, finding space for a right-foot shot, which took a deflection and trickled past goalkeeper Mabrouk Zaid. Ittihad equalised in the 33rd minute when captain Mohammed Noor bundled in the loose ball after Sao Paulo goalkeeper Rogerio had parried Mohammed Kallons initial effort. 

But Amoroso restored Sao Paulos advantage two minutes into the second half, tucking in Real Madrid-bound Cicinhos low cross from point-blank range. 

Rogerio scored from the penalty spot in the 57th minute to make it 3-1 and give the goalkeeper his 53rd goal since his first-team debut for Sao Paulo in 1993. 

Defender Hamad Al Montashari pulled one back for Al Ittihad with a 68th-minute header but the Asian champions never quite had enough firepower to break down Sao Paulo for a third time.

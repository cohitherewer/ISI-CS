 Amittrajit earns a fine win

Coimbatore: Calcuttas ace driver Amittrajit Ghosh earned another feather in his racing career-cap when he won one race in the FISSME category of the JK Tyre National Racing Championships second leg here and just about missed another when a 30-second penalty was pushed his way. 

Despite his finishing fourth in that race, he is now third overall, trailing Gaurav Dalal (32) and Rayomand Banajee (30) by only three points. The third leg will be in Chennai. 

It was easy for Amittrajit in the first race, but there was a crash with Banajee and an enquiry committee decided to slap that 30-second penalty on the Calcutta lad. 

Ayub Khan continued to dominate in the Esteem class at Kari Motor Speedway and in the Formula LGB category Ameya Walavalkar won, follwed by Sarosh Hataria and Banajee. (PTI)

 Glamorgan soar on Day I

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Glamorgan had a brilliant opening day in their County Championship division I match against Middlesex at the John Walkers ground in Southgate on Wednesday. 

Opting for first strike after a delayed start, Glamorgan raced to 248 for one in 55 overs at stumps on Day I, according to information received here. 

Weather permitting, he will most likely be bowling to regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly on Thursday.

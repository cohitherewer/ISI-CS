 Mystical slams opposition on heavy track 

 TITAN BOY

 Defying discomfiture over a rain soaked track, the half-money favourite, Mystical, beat the field hollow to lift the 1,600m Usha Stud Bangalore Summer Million on Sunday. S. Ganapathy trained the three-year-old by Alnasr Alwasheek out of Mystic Memory.

 Jockey B. Prakash, who had a fall in the last race on Saturday, virtually had an armchair ride on the winner who may be heard of in the Classics.

 The eight-event card was, however, truncated after the Million race in view of heavy showers. Rains had left the underfoot condition of the track hardly conducive for racing.

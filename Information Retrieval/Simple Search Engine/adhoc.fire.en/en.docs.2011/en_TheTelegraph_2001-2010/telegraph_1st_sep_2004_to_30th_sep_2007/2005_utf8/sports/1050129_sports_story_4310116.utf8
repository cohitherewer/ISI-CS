Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt battled his way into the Australian Open final with a tenacious 3-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-1 win over Andy Roddick on Friday to become the first Australian Open men?s singles finalist in 17 years. 

?It?s awesome,? the 23-year-old said after defeating the second seed. ?I always said I?d do anything to play in the first night final in Australian Open men?s history and I?ve got my chance.? 

Only Marat Safin stands between Hewitt and his dream of becoming the first Australian to win the men?s title since 1976. 

The Russian, twice a runner-up, beat runaway world No. 1 Roger Federer on Thursday and Hewitt knows he faces an uphill battle. 

?Obviously, Marat?s beaten the best player around. He?s obviously playing extremely well. He always plays well at the Australian Open,? Hewitt said. 

?I?ll have to raise my game again, go out there and give it everything I?ve got and see what happens.? 

American Roddick had dominated third seed Hewitt with his heavy service game in the opening two sets, crashing down 31 aces in total, but eventually he crumbled as Hewitt stood firm. 

?I?m pissed off. You know, I?m mad. I felt like I was in there with a shot. To lose two breakers like that, which either one of them would have given me a distinct advantage, it?s disappointing,? Roddick said. 

Hewitt?s whose win lifts him to number two in the world, sank to his knees with his arms raised to wild cheers from the Rod Laver Arena centre court crowd when a Roddick backhand sailed long on the final point after two hours and 54 minutes. 

Hewitt had never made it past the fourth round at Melbourne Park since he began as a 15-year-old qualifier in 1997, but is now bidding to become the first Australian to win the men?s title since Mark Edmondson beat John Newcombe 29 years ago. 

Winner of the US Open in 2001 and Wimbledon in 2002, Hewitt is the first Australian to reach the final since Pat Cash in 1987 and 1988. 

 Molik?s revenge 

Australian Alicia Molik took her revenge over Lindsay Davenport for her defeat in the quarter finals of the Australian Open as she teamed with Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova to win the women?s doubles on Friday for her first Grand Slam crown. 

Sixth seeds Molik and Kuznetsova beat Davenport and fellow American Corina Morariu 6-3, 6-4 to win the title in 56 minutes, clinching victory in their first tournament together. 

Meanwhile, seventh seed Max Mirnyi (Belarus) and Martina Navratilova (US) beat second seed Zimbabwean pair of Wayne and Cara Black 7-5, 6-4 to reach the last four of the mixed doubles. Aussie duo of Scott Draper and Samantha Stosur have already made it to the finals defeating Andy Ram (Israel) and Conchita Martinez (Spain) 7-5, 6-3.

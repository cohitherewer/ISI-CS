 Atwal misses title by whisker

Duluth (Georgia): India?s Arjun Atwal produced his best-ever result on the USPGA Tour, coming within striking distance of the $5 million Bellsouth Classic title here on Monday. 

In a tournament reduced to 54 holes because of incessant rain and bad weather, Atwal carded the tournament?s best round of eight-under 64 in the final round to force a five-man play-off, which was ultimately won by defending Masters champion Phil Mickelson. 

Atwal lost out in the play-off as he hit his approach shot into the water guarding the 18th green at the Sugarloaf Golf Course to finish joint second. He shot one-over for the hole ? ironically a hole that he birdied in the second and third rounds. 

?My game has been showing progress and I am glad that I am coming close (to my best),? said Atwal, who is playing the season on a conditional card, which will give him about 18 starts. 

The Bellsouth Classic was only his third start, and with finishes of tied 16th at Pebble Beach and then tied 26th at the Chrysler Classic of Tuscon, Atwal is well on his way to making his card for 2006. 

Atwal picked up $330,000, the highest-ever for an Indian golfer anywhere, and it catapulted his earnings to over $418,000 in just three starts. 

He also rises to 55th on the money list in US Tour. Mickelson, the tour?s leading money-winner, earned $900,000 of the $5 million purse. 

The playoff began with five players ? Atwal, Brandt Jobe, Jose Maria Olazabal, Rich Beem and Mickelson ? after they had tied on eight-under-par 208 after three rounds. 

Atwal and Jobe dropped out at the first playoff hole ? the 18th ? after missing their putts for par while the other three parred the hole and moved on to the 17th. 

Two-time Masters champion Olazabal had blown two chances to clinch the title with birdie putts ? one on the 18th and another on the first playoff hole. He then bowed out after his fifth shot landed in the water on the third playoff hole. 

Atwal struggled in the first round with two double bogeys, and just three birdies in a 77. But then he fought back with six birdies and just one bogey on the second day to get into the weekend rounds, as his friend Daniel Chopra missed the cut. 

In the final round, there was no indication of his sensational round, even though he began reasonably well with birdies on 10th, 13th before dropping a shot on 14th. 

He then birdied 16th and 18th to turn in three-under 33. On the front nine of the course, he was on fire, with birdies on second, fourth, sixth and seventh and then closed with a birdie on ninth to finish at eight-under 64. 

It was quite easily the most exciting card for the day, as Atwal playing well ahead of the lead groups came in at eight-under 208 to join the clubhouse leader Olazabal. 

His first two rounds were five-over 77 and five-under 67, which put him at even-par 144 after 36 holes. In the final round, Atwal, went into an overdrive and played one of his finest rounds in the US in two years. 

?It was a great round. Things began happening on the back nine (the front nine for the course). I had a five-under 31, which shot me right up the leaderboard,? he said. 

?I was very fortunate to dodge a few bullets and ultimately win,? said Mickelson, who captured his third title of 2005. There were six or 10 people that could have and should have won this tournament.? 

It was a great end to the meet, which had the first two and half days washed out by rain and snow. (AGENCIES)

 Adams bows to Anand guile

San Luis (Argentina): World No.2 Viswanathan Anand scored a thumping victory over Grandmaster Michael Adams of England, unleashing a brilliant novelty in the third round of the World Chess Championship here on Friday. 

With his third victory in two days, Anand remained in joint lead with 2.5 points along with Bulgarian GM Veselin Topalov, who defeated Russian GM Alexander Morozevich in the round, which produced all four decisive games. 

Also ending on the winning side was worlds strongest-ever woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary, who put it across defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan, while Peter Svidler added to the woes of Hungarian Peter Leko with a finely-crafted victory. 

Their nearest rival Svidler, who was on two points, followed joint leaders Anand and Topalov. 

Another half-point adrift was Polgar on 1.5, while Morozevich, Adams and Kasimd-zhanov were next in li-ne with one point each. 

One of the pre-event favourites, Leko was languishing on the last spot with just a half point from three games in this $1 million championship. 

Anand was in his elements on Friday. The Indian ace uncorked a brilliant opening novelty and clearly enjoyed the fruit of hard work at home. Adams had no clue what hit him soon after the opening and by the time he understood it was all over.

Johannesburg: Seamer Matthew Hoggard took a career-best seven for 61 to spearhead a dramatic 77-run victory for England over South Africa in the fourth test at The Wanderers on Monday. 

Fired by Marcus Trescothick?s second-innings 180, the tourists set South Africa 325 to win and then carved through their much-vaunted batting before sealing victory late in the final session. England now lead the five-match series 2-1. 

After taking five for 144 in the first innings, Hoggard finished with 12 wickets in the match, his first 10-wicket haul in Test cricket. 

Herschelle Gibbs provided the stiffest resistance with 98, while the in-form Jacques Kallis was dismissed first ball by Hoggard, who ended with seven for 61. 

South Africa captain Graeme Smith tried to salvage the game, coming in at No. 8 after being advised by doctors not to bat following a blow on the head during fielding practice. He made an unbeaten 67 but was left stranded as wickets fell at the other end. 

Dale Steyn was the last man out, caught behind off Hoggard with barely half an hour of light left. The innings lasted 59.3 overs. 

An England victory looked unlikely when Michael Vaughan, knowing that several of his bowlers were carrying injuries, delayed his declaration. 

Hoggard, though, quickly trapped AB de Villiers in front for three in the fifth over of South Africa?s second innings and the home side were soon 18 for three. Hoggard bowled Jacques Rudolph with an inswinger and had Kallis caught by Trescothick the next ball. 

Boeta Dippenaar survived Hoggard?s hattrick ball, and along with Gibbs, added 62 runs for the fourth wicket. They were parted just before tea when Dippenaar edged a drive off Hoggard to Giles in the gully and Boucher quickly followed for a duck. 

Hoggard then accounted for Nicky Boje in the final session, catching a return catch to make it 118 for six. 

Gibbs, though was the key wicket. Pushing forward, he given out lbw on his front foot to Giles to make it 163 for seven. 

Flintoff then bullied Pollock back to the pavilion, hitting him on the helmet, having him dropped at silly point by Vaughan on four and then inducing an edge behind. Flintoff got Makhaya Ntini lbw before the dramatic finale. 

Earler England had resumed on 195 for five, still looking vulnerable, but they threw caution to the wind as they hammered 135 more runs before declaring just before lunch. 

Trescothick faced 248 balls in all and hit 24 fours and four sixes, putting on half-century stands with Ashley Giles and Steve Harmison, who contributed just three. (REUTERS)

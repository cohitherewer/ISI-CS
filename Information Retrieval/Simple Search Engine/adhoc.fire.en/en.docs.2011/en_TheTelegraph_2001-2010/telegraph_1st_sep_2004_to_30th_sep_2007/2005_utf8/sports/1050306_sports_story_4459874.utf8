The Telegraph - Calcutta

Look out for car No.19

- We have realistic targets 

 Overdrive 

Narain Karthikeyan

The Saturday before each raceday is always a very 

important day in the entire qualifying process. There are two practice sessions 

and then the very important first qualifying session. I finished ninth overall 

after the first qualifying session and am quite pleased with my performance.

With the weather playing havoc, everyone had an added 

problem to deal with. This really did skew the timings a lot. Being my first qualifying 

session, I was determined to do well and tried not to let the weather conditions 

bother me too much. We came up with a game plan and stuck to it. With the track 

conditions a little slippery, I slid a couple of times but managed to stay focused.

It has been a great and hectic week so far in Melbourne. 

I gave my first official interview and shared the podium with other drivers, such 

as Michael Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya. 

There has been a lot of support for me from the driving 

fraternity and that was very heartening. My learning curve is going up and up 

and though it is a dream come to true to be rubbing shoulders with these great 

names, I cannot remain in awe of them and have to focus on my tasks.

As a team, we have set realistic targets and the most 

immediate is to finish races and be competitive. It?s very important that we pose 

ourselves to be reckoned with and capable. Once we reach there, then it will be 

a question of pushing for points and podium finishes. Tiago Monteiro, my other 

teammate, is a very capable driver and though he was slightly slower than me, 

is looking and raring to go as well.

As far as positions go on the starting grid, it all 

depends on the qualifying sessions. Final positions will be reached after aggregating 

the times from both qualifying rounds.

The support from the media, especially from India, 

has been staggering. A few media representatives have come to cover the event 

and it?s always good to see that, especially for a sport like Formula One. I am 

very excited about my first race! Look out for car number 19. TCM

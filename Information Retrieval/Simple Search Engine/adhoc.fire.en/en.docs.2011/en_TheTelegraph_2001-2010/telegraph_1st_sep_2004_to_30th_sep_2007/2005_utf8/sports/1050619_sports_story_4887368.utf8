 Crash puts Ralf out

Indianapolis: Toyotas Ralf Schumacher will miss Sundays US Grand Prix after crashing heavily at the Indianapolis circuit for the second year in-a-row (As reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

I am basically fine, or 80 percent fit to drive but the FIA decided not to let me back in the car because of the risk of having another hard impact within the 24 hours, the German told reporters on Saturday. The risk was too high to let me go again. 

Brazilian Ricardo Zonta, the regular test driver who took part in Friday practice, will take the 29-year-olds place instead. 

Zonta raced five times for Toyota in 2004 with his last appearance coming at his home Grand Prix in Sao Paulo in October. He has also driven for BAR, finishing sixth at Indianapolis in 2000, and for Jordan. 

Ralf, who had a check-up with FIA medical delegate Gary Hartstein Saturday morning after a brain scan in hospital on Friday, said he was unhurt in the crash. 

I am relatively happy, I went through the scans and everything is fine. There was a little concussion but nothing severe really, said the younger brother of Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. 

Obviously I dont feel 100 percent fit after a crash like that and its a shame not to be there for the team. Lightning is supposed not to strike twice in the same place but on this occasion I guess that does not apply to me. 

Ralf missed six races after last years accident left him with spinal injuries but he was sure he would be back in time for the next French Grand Prix on July 3.

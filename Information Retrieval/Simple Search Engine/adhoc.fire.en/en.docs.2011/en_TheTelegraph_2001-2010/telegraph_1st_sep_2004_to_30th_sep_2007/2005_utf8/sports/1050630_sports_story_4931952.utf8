 Marias 100 decibels

 - Queen of shouts pumps up the volume

Perhaps it is appropriate that Maria Sharapova has been recorded during this fortnight at about 100 decibels, which is about the equivalent of an emergency siren, as it is when the teenager is experiencing a few tense moments that she increases the volume of her grunting, her shrieking and her screaming. 

And Tuesday, as the defending champion reached the semi-finals, was one of those days when the noise from Sharapova was fairly relentless, the sound carrying halfway across the All-England Club. It was the closest match of the tournament so far for Sharapova, and she needed to play some of her best grasscourt tennis to defeat Nadia Petrova 7-6, 6-3 in the all-Russian quarter final. 

The Florida-based prodigy has the game for grass, with flat-hit groundstrokes that skim over the net and then skid through the back of the court, but she was often unsettled by Petrova, who was striking the ball with some determination and ambition. It was a high-quality match, with several enthralling exchanges from the baseline, but the occasion is likely to be remembered for its soundtrack, not for the tennis itself. 

It had been suggested before these championships that Sharapova, and some of the other noisy women, deliberately indulge in a little gamesmanship by grunting so loudly. Alan Mills, the referee, was quoted as saying that the worst offenders should be removed from the tournament for cheating. Sharapova, it seems, should be seen, and not heard. 

But the argument does not hold with Sharapova. Her grunt is not a deliberate attempt to ruin her opponents concentration, but an involuntary exhalation of air that accompanies the physical effort of striking the ball. It is often possible to tell how close a match is simply by listening to the noise she is making. 

The closer the match is, the louder she grunts. Sharapova also has an impressive vocal range, with several different kinds of grunt. Occasionally she shrieked, occasionally she let out a low bass note of a grunt, occasionally she attempted to muffle the noise, and occasionally she really went for it and came close to stripping the paint off the debentures enclosure. 

That must have been the most unsettling aspect for Petrova, that there was not one constant noise for her to cope with. But it was interesting to note that Petrova, who was making her first appearance in the Wimbledon quarter finals, never complained to the officials. 

So it was at the moments of greatest tension Tuesday that Sharapova was at her loudest, such as in the tie-break when she was denied with her first two set points. Up went the volume, and then the tempo. She converted her third set point. And the volume went up again as she served for the match, staving off the only break point she faced all afternoon when a backhand hit the tape of the net and rolled over for a winner. 

And Sharapova would enjoy another lucky net-cord in the next point, which took her to match point. She did not see it as luck. Yeah, I thanked the fairy for taking the ball and bringing it over the net, she said with some sarcasm. You know, this is tennis, and that is what happens. Sometimes it will go over the net and sometimes it wont. 

Sharapova needed only the one match point and, at the moment of victory, she threw her head and arms back in celebration. It mattered that much. But there was more to come. It seemed that Sharapova has added something to her repertoire for this year, the deliberate and semi-regal wave that she performed ? in between blowing kisses ? to all four sides of the stadium. 

The questions in the post-match interview tend to deviate from the forehands and the backhands. She was asked whether she had received any marriage proposals this year. 

There havent been that many at Wimbledon, Sharapova said. At other tournaments there are a lot of signs saying, Will you marry me, Maria? Its like, Will you jump off a bridge? Its the same answer.

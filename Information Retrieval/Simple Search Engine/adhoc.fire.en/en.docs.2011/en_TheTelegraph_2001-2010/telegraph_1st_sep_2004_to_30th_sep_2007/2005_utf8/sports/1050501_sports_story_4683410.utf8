 Shoaib Malik verdict tomorrow

 Malik can lose match fee or be banned for a Test or two ODIs 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has decided to put up Shoaib Malik?s disciplinary case before its high powered ad hoc committee which meets at the cricket headquarters in Lahore Monday. 

The inquiry committee has submitted its findings and the disciplinary committee will take appropriate action Monday that will be put up before the ad hoc committee for approval, a PCB spokesman said on Saturday. 

Disciplinary action will be taken in consonance with the serious implications of the offence after consulting the ad hoc committee, the spokesman said. 

Malik, while captaining Sialkot Stallions, had admitted conceding a Twenty20 Cup match to Karachi Zebras for which he was fined Rs 10,000 by the match referee. 

Malik admitted throwing a match on Thursday to knock rivals Lahore Eagles out of the meet. After leading his Sialkot Stallions team to a four-run defeat by Karachi Zebras, Malik said his team did not chase a modest victory target because they wanted to knock Lahore Eaglets out. 

Malik has been charged under ICC Level 2 for which he can be docked his entire match fee or can be banned for one Test or two ODIs. The PCB is putting into effect the ICC code because it is considering this match to be an ?ODI? for disciplinary reasons. 

Malik Saturday appeared before a three-man inquiry committee and pleaded guilty. Sources said the inquiry commission, headed by former Test player Haroon Rasheed, had shown Malik video tapes of the match and he had admitted his mistake. 

In a press statement, the PCB said chairman Shaharyar Khan had taken serious note of Malik?s decision to deliberately concede the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Bengal cautious vs Salgaocar 

Margao: East Bengal will be in cautious against Salgaocar on Sunday as the defending champions face first of two tricky away hurdles in their push for completing a hattrick of National Football League titles. 

East Bengal, with 39 points from 18 matches, are three points behind leaders Sporting Clube de Goa, who have played two matches more than the Calcutta side. East Bengal need to win three and draw one of their last four matches to achieve the target. 

Salgaocar have 23 points from 19 matches. They are currently out of the relegation threat, but any slip-up in the remaining three matches could prove to be costly for them. 

East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, stated on the match-eve his team would try not to lose since that would jeopardise their chances. 

Describing the hosts as ?tricky customers,? he said that ?the match is important for us in winning the title. But beating Salgaocar at home is a difficult proposition as they are a tough team.? (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Cronje legacy haunts Centurion 

 Hansie Cronje 

London: Centurion Park, venue of the final Test between South Africa and England starting on Friday, was an implausible backdrop for a corruption scandal which threatened to rip international cricket apart. 

Five years ago in the last clash between the teams at Centurion, rain poured solidly for three days after South Africa had reached 155 for six in their first innings. 

The hosts had already clinched the series and England were preparing to go through the motions in a match destined for a draw. 

Then South Africa captain Hansie Cronje approached his opposite number Nasser Hussain with an unprecedented offer. 

Cronje proposed forfeiting the next two innings for the first time in Test cricket. He would then set England a target of 255 from 73 overs on the final day. 

The eventual declaration was even more attractive. England were set 249 from 76 overs and, with their current captain Michael Vaughan stroking 69 from 108 balls, they won by eight wickets in the final over. 

Cronje was robust in defence of his unexpected action and said ?whispers? from the International Cricket Council condemning the two forfeitures were unwarranted. 

?I would be disappointed if this is the attitude and do not want to be part of the game if this is their thinking,? he said. ?I am playing in a very positive side and today was another chance to back their ability throughout to beat England.? 

Hussain swallowed any misgivings he might have had when first approached by Cronje. 

?Of course I would have been gutted had we lost,? he said. ?I think we all would have been. But Hansie deserves every support for what he did. He gave us a chance, he gave his side a chance and we gave the public a great day.? 

A match destined for the dustbins of history was now acclaimed as one of the most exciting ever, ranking with the famous tied Test between Australia and the West Indies in the 1960-61 series. 

Except, as was to be revealed in chilling details over the coming months, the final day had been a fraud. 

Cronje, in his confession said the offer to Hussain followed a late night visit by bookmaker Marlon Aronstam. Even though the deal with Hussain was too late for Aronstam to place his bets, he still gave Cronje 53,000 rand, around $9,000, and a leather jacket for his wife. 

The result in the Centurion Test of January, 2000, is just another of his tarnished legacies.

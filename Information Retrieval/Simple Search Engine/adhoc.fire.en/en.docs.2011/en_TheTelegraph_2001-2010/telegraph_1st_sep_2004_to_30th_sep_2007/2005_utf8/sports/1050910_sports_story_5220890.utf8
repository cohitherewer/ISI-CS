 Narain finishes 15th in first practice

 Raikkonen clocked the fastest time on Friday

Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium): Narain Karthikeyan demonstrated the power of his new Jordan-Toyota EJ15B for an excellent 15th position while teammate Tiago Monteiro finished 20th in a rain-hit free practice session ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix. 

However, his hopes of adding a few more miles to the new car were dashed as heavy rains washed out the second practice session. 

Narain had to rely on his past experience at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit where he won his F3 race in 2003 to clock 1.53.148 which was more than two seconds quicker than Monteiro 

Karthikeyan was highly satisfied with the new car. 

Indeed, I was right to have been eagerly looking forward to having the opportunity to drive the EJ15B. The new car seems to be well adapted to do the job. The first moment that a car goes out on the track, is always a great moment of emotion. I am glad it all went well. 

McLarens Kimi Raikkonen clocked the fastest time. Their Austrian test driver Alexander Wurz came up with the second fastest lap, a mere 0.010 slower. 

McLaren changed the engine of Juan Pablo Montoyas car on Friday but the Colombian escaped a 10-place penalty on the Belgian GP starting grid. 

Renaul had Italian Giancarlo Fisichella in third place ahead of Toyotas Brazilian test driver Ricardo Zonta.

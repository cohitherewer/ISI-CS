Calcutta: She could have been the next golden girl. Coming from an extremely poor family in Purulia, Pinky Pramanik had a meteoric rise to stardom on the tracks. 

One unfortunate incident later, Pinkys fairytale career capped with a gold medal at the Asian Track and Field (ATF) meet in Manila on 2003, came to an abrupt halt. 

The athlete, who was arrested for possessing a one-shot pistol, now says she has put the trauma behind her and is concentrating on the next World Championship meet in Helsinki, Finland, in August. 

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 53rd state athletics meet at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday, Pinky said, Under the guidance of my Russian coach, I hope to qualify for the 400m and 800m events. 

Though she knows it will tough after her long hiatus, Pinky, it seems has regained the focus. 

Right now I am only concentrating on my career and have stopped reporting to the courts last December, she said, adding I hope to clinch the gold here. 

Pinky posted four meet records in 2002 at the junior (under-18) state meet in Manbhum. 

My main target is to participate in the ATF meet in South Korea in September 2002, and subsequently, the Asian Games next year in Doha, she said.

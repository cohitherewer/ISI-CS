The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania can hold her own against the best

Serve amp; Volley

Though Sania could collect only three games in her US Open fourth-round match against Sharapova, the late night vigil was certainly worth it. The quality of the first seven games brought a lump to my throat and had me shaking my head in disbelief. 

I got carried away by the sight of the No. 1 seed scampering all over the court to retrieve Sanias devastating forehand and announced grandly to my fellow watchers: This is one of the best forehands I have ever seen. 

Sharapova looked nervous and uncertain, as she went through the ritual of tucking her long hair behind her ears before serving. When she broke through to lead 4-2 in the first set, one was ready to accept a Sania roll-over. 

But Sania fought back tenaciously and had Sharapova struggling at 0-40 on her serve. This was the moment Sania needed a break. A breakback could have brought down the wavering Sharapovas confidence a notch or two, resulting in a much better score. But Grand Slam champions blossom under pressure. 

Sharapova went for the lines and raised her game to a higher level. The score in the first set did not reflect the intensity of the contest. We all exulted at some of Sanias crosscourt backhands, which the dogged Sharapova did not even make an effort to reach. In the second set, Sharapova was in full flow and wrapped up the match comfortably. 

This match has done many things for Sania. Firstly, it has firmly established that Sania is no straw in the wind and shown she has the potential to get to the top-10. Secondly, it has brought to the fore the weakness in her service and the need for greater consistency. Thirdly, it has given her much needed experience at the topmost level of Grand Slams ? a very valuable and essential asset. 

A few breathtaking groundshot exchanges, especially one of the 15 shots seemingly at supersonic speed in the second set proved that she can hold her own against the best in the world. 

Enough has been said about Sanias weaknesses. I would like to talk about her forehand and why I rate it as one of the best I have seen. The power in the shot comes from a wrist snap, which accelerates the speed of the racket head. With a flat racket face, it resembles a slap at the moment of impact. It requires perfect timing. 

Last summer at Wimbledon, the BBC showed a super slow motion breakdown of Federers forehand. His power also comes from a wrist snap. He uses this mostly for punishing fatally, balls short of length. But Federer also has the normal heavy topspin forehand which he uses when he has been pushed behind the baseline by the depth of his opponents shot. Sania could develop and use this shot. It will help reduce her errors. 

In recent times, no sporting event has evoked such a level of interest, bordering on hysteria. Prayers to the Almighty by all religions for Sanias victory bombarded the heavens, seeking divine intervention. 

The masses in India hooked onto television want to see Indian sportspersons perform successfully at the international level. They are hungry for sporting icons and can now recognise the chasm between national and international standards. Also, they are aware of the sacrifice and tremendous effort to achieve such level with poor resources. 

In simple terms, the Sania story is of a talented and dedicated young girl who dared to dream. Strong family bonding and sacrifice have welded them together into a single unified force. She is not afraid of losing, says her father, liberating her from the compulsive pressure of the west where losing is akin to a crime. 

Sanias success will inspire and liberate Indian women all over the country ? not only in sport but in all spheres of life. While saluting her parents, one has to caution them that even tougher times lie ahead if Sania is to make the top-10 and keep in mind Henin-Hardennes mantra: Impossible is nothing.

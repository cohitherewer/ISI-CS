The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Second trip a possibility

 - ASSESSMENT OF VENUES in INDIA 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Zakir Khan 

Mumbai: The Pakistan Cricket Board?s (PCB?s) venue assessment team, currently in India, may require another trip to complete its job. 

?Well, yes, that?s a possibility,? informed former quick Zakir Khan, who is the PCB?s operations chief, when contacted by The Telegraph in Calcutta on Thursday evening. 

Zakir and his partner on the assessment team, SSP Sohail Khan, met the Board of Control for Cricket in India?s (BCCI?s) immediate past president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, and secretary S.K. Nair earlier in the day. 

?As of now, we?re definitely visiting all three Test centres (Mohali, Ahmedabad, Bangalore) and three of the five venues for the one-dayers? We?re returning home on January 31 itself as I need to head for Melbourne which is hosting the International Cricket Council?s chief executives? meet on February 3 and 4,? Zakir added. 

The PCB hasn?t appointed a chief executive after Rameez Raja?s resignation last August and Zakir has often had to wear two hats. 

According to Zakir, the assessment team heads for Bangalore on Friday and will be in Ahmedabad the next day. After that, trips have been planned for Kanpur and New Delhi. Zakir and Sohail, who arrived on Monday, have already visited Mohali and Jamshedpur. 

The centres not on the assessment team?s itinerary (as of Thursday evening) are Kochi and Vizag, both scheduled to stage one-dayers. As also Dharamshala, expected to host the three-day tour-opener, from February 27. 

Zakir and Sohail were (understandably) bowled over by Mohali and, apparently, seemed happy with the Keenan in Jamshedpur. Zakir, however, has suggested that the dressing rooms there be airconditioned. 

As wide-bodied aircraft can?t land in Jamshedpur, the BCCI intends chartering two ATRs to ferry the teams. 

Much of the attention is going to be on the assessment team?s trip to Ahmedabad. Significantly, Zakir reiterated that they will be landing there with an ?open mind? and that the PCB hasn?t received a government advisory not to play there. 

Meanwhile, whether the touring party is going to include a security officer will almost surely depend on the report submitted by this assessment team.

 Bangla stun world champions

Cardiff: Bangladesh produced the biggest shock in one-day International history to beat world champions Australia by five wickets with four balls to spare in the triangular series match at the Sophia Gardens on Saturday. 

Within a span of six months, Bangladesh have humbled both finalists of the 2003 World Cup. In December, they had beaten India at home. 

Australia were 1/100 to win this match with leading British bookmaker William Hill before the start of play and Bangladesh 16/1. 

But Mohammed Ashrafuls run a ball hundred, only the second by a Bangladesh batsman in one-day Internationals, took the minnows ? bottom of the world one-day International rankings ? to the brink of an astounding win. 

Bangladesh, chasing 250, got the target down to seven off six balls. 

And when Aftab Ahmed slammed the first ball of the last over from Jason Gillespie for six over long-on, Bangladesh were almost home. 

Ahmeds scrambled one off the next ball saw Bangladesh to an astonishing win. When Ashraful was caught at long-on by Brad Hogg off Gillespie, one ball after his hundred, 23 runs were needed off the last three overs. 

But left-hander Mohammed Rafique sliced Glenn McGrath down to third man to make the target nine runs off 10 balls. 

Bangladesh though couldnt score off two short-pitched McGrath deliveries and were left needing seven off the last over. 

And then Ahmed (21 not out) and Rafique (nine not out) took over. 

Australia who lost Adam Gilchrist for a second ball nought and collapsed to nine for two, against a side England had thrashed by 10 wickets in the series opener at The Oval on Thursday, eventually reached 249 for five. 

But their top order found runs hard to come by, their bowlers lacked imagination and even Australias usually fine fielding became ragged. 

Defeat capped a week that also featured a 100-run Twenty20 defeat against England and a four-wicket reverse in a 50 overs per side match against Somerset. 

Australia now face England in Bristol Sunday. Bangladesh had got the target down to 73 off the last 10 overs. 

After being 72 for three a stand of 130 between Ashraful and Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar (47) kept their side on course. Damien Martyn top-scored with 77 and together with Michael Clarke (54) put on 108 for the fourth wicket. (Agencies)

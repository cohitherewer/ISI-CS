The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sidney set for Fed Cup

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia hopes to sign for East Bengal as soon as possible but he hasnt found his place on the 19-member squad, coach Subhas Bhowmick on Friday picked for the Goa-bound Federation Cup. 

South African Sidney Nakalanga, who signed on the dotted line on Friday, has been named as one of the forwards in the squad. I. M. Vijayan and K. Kulothungan are going to be his partners upfront. 

However, Bhowmick has left a place open. The club is waiting for a Congolese players international transfer certificate (ITC) to arrive. If it comes in a day or two, he will be the third foreigner, apart from Sidney and Mike Okoro. 

But it has been learnt that its going to be Sasthi Duley, and not Bhaichung, who will fill up the final spot if the Congolese ITC does not reach the club in time. 

Bhaichung, however, had a one-on-one with Bhowmick on Thursday night and admitted that hes keen to sit with the club officials to complete the formalities. 

I want to sign for East Bengal as soon as possible and seeking the release order from Malaysias MK Land wont be a problem, Bhaichung said. 

Bhaichung, however, said that Bhowmick had asked him to join the squad in Goa as soon as he signed on the contract paper. 

But that move should be seen in the light of acclimatising with the squad rather than having a chance to play in the tournament.

Goalkeepers: Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Naseem Akhtar.

Calcutta: Greg Chappell has always maintained his cricket education remained ?incomplete? as he didnt play in India. 

Twenty-one years after retiring, the former Australian captain has a chance to at least coach Team India: He is among four shortlisted by the Board, which has launched the hunt for John Wrights successor. 

Compatriot Tom Moody, too, is in the quartet with Mohinder Amarnath and Sandeep Patil. 

All will be invited for an interview by the month-end and the chosen one named ?by June 15,? promised Board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra. 

The appointment is going to be till the 2007 World Cup. The August 2-14 tri-series in Sri Lanka, by the way, will be the new coachs first assignment. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the specially constituted six-member selection committee ? which met here for almost two hours on Sunday afternoon ? also spoke about ?checking? the availability of Desmond Haynes and John Inverarity. 

West Indian Haynes needs no introduction, while Inverarity was once tipped to lead Australia. He just played six Tests, but was prolific for Western Australia. 

Respected for a brilliant cricket mind, Inverarity is currently coaching Warwickshire. Haynes has worked with Sussex and Hampshire. 

Inverarity, though, is 61. 

Incidentally, the Mahendra-chaired committee ignored the claims of Dean Jones and Dav Whatmore. 

Hardly a surprise as Whatmore has extended his contract with Bangladesh and India wouldnt risk damaging Asian unity by poaching. As for Jones, he figured in the CBIs report on match-fixing (in late 2000). 

That Jones wouldnt, therefore, come into the frame was reported in these columns on April 20. 

No Indian sent his CV, but a source revealed Amarnath and Patil got shortlisted largely to keep the swadeshi lobby happy. Also, nobody can now make an issue of the selection process in, say, Parliament. 

Amarnath has coached Bangladesh, while Patil succeeded Ajit Wadekar in early 1996. That India innings was, of course, short. Patil made bigger headlines in the 2003 World Cup, when Kenya made the semi-finals. More recently, he has coached A sides. 

Known to talk straight, Amarnath said ? ?My opinion is that only an Indian should be coaching India.? Speaking soon after the Boards decision, he added: ?Yes. Im happy Im going to be called for an interview? However, I take one thing at a time and, so, wont say anything more.? 

Chappell, who has privately worked with regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly (and, to a lesser extent, with seniormost pro Sachin Tendulkar), was informed of his shortlisting by this newspaper. 

?I havent heard anything from anybody, but thank you for this piece of news? Im delighted and looking forward to a formal call,? he remarked. 

Asked whether he could make it for the interview at short notice, Chappell replied: ?Yes, indeed?? 

Its to be seen whether the Board will actually be comfortable with Chappells profile, but he does have the credentials to take Team India forward. 

Chappell hasnt coached a national team, but has worked with South Australia. Moodys experience, too, is limited to working at Worcestershire. 

 Unless Haynes or Inverarity make it a three-way race, 

 it may eventually be Chappell vs Moody ? the Big 

 Fight in the build-up to 2005-06.

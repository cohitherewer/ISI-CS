 Steve: Sourav a committed individual

 Steve slams Souravs bickering over pitches 

Sydney: Steve Waugh feels Sourav Ganguly is a committed individual and praises the former Team India captain for injecting combativeness into the side. 

I saw in Sourav a committed individual who wanted to inject some toughness and combativeness into a side that had often tended in the past to roll over and expose a soft underbelly, Waugh wrote in autobiography Out of My Comfort Zone. 

However, Waugh has slammed Souravs bickering over pitches and his tendency to interact with groundsmen before international matches, and said it was not too different from match-fixing. 

He (Sourav) was... Constantly bickering over the nature of pitches and trying to influence the groundsmen in India. To me, this wasnt too different from match-fixing, because captains who try this on are attempting to alter the conditions in collusion with a force they shouldnt be tampering with, the Australian legend writes. 

Its a groundsmans job to prepare a pitch to the best of his ability, then hand it over to the players for them to adapt to the conditions. Thats why its called a Test its supposed to challenge you, not appease your wishes. 

The two former skippers shared a strained relationship during the two historic series that they were involved with, Souravs turning up late for toss during Indias home series being the lowest point in their game of oneupmanship. 

Mentioning the toss episode, Waugh says he was wound up by Souravs continued petulance in being late for the toss and then walking off by himself. 

Waugh also terms Sourav elitist and a bloke who made a few rules for himself in his exalted position in the book. (PTI)

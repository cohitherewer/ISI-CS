 Armstrong: Mere tabloid journalism

 - Fresh doping allegation against cycling champion rocks fraternity 

 Lance Armstrong has reiterated he has never used performance-enhancing drugs 

Paris: Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has denied ever taking performance-enhancing drugs following a report in a French newspaper that he had used the blood-boosting drug EPO. 

I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs, the 33-year-old, who retired in July, said on his website. 

Armstrong, who recovered from testicular cancer to become the most successful rider in the Tours history, has been forced to rebut several doping allegations during his career. 

The newspaper, which claimed to have access to laboratory documents, reported on Tuesday that six of Armstrongs urine samples collected on the 1999 Tour de France showed indisputable traces of EPO (erythropoietin). 

It published what it claimed to be a result-sheet from the laboratory which appeared to show six figures revealing traces of EPO. The newspaper also published documents from the French cycling federation showing exactly the same figures under Armstrongs name. 

The Chatenay-Malabry lab said the samples they tested did not have names attached and they could not confirm if any of the samples were Armstrongs. 

It said all test results had been sent to World Anti-doping Agency (WADA), the agency in charge of the fight against doping in world sport, on the condition they would not use them to take disciplinary action. 

Despite the lack of proof and Armstrongs denials, cycling officials expressed disappointment. 

Tour de France executive director Jean-Marie Leblanc said he felt let down by Armstrong after the allegation that the American had taken the banned drug in 1999 when he won the worlds greatest cycle race for the first time. 

I remain cautious and slightly circumspect but this is troubling and I feel disappointment inside me, like many sports lovers must do, Leblanc told a French radio station. He added that he felt let down by Armstrong. 

International Cycling Union (UCI) president Hein Verbruggen said: We have to wait and see if this is true. Only then will we be able to ask ourselves whether there should be any legal action and whether this is a further blow for cycling. 

I have to say this is not pleasant but, for the moment, it only involves Lance Armstrong and France. 

There were no tests to detect EPO, a drug that increases the level of red blood cells and endurance, in 1999. 

However, samples from the 1999 Tour were kept and have been recently re-tested by the specialist anti-doping laboratory in Chatenay-Malabry outside Paris. 

The WADA-accredited lab, which developed the test to detect EPO, started re-testing last year samples that had been taken in 1998-99 and frozen. The new tests were part of a scientific research programme. 

A spokesman for WADA said the latest research results from the French laboratory had arrived at the Montreal-based organisation on Monday. 

He added that like the lab, WADA had no means of matching names to the samples and this could be done only by the French cycling federation, the French sports ministry or the UCI. 

Despite being in a class of his own in recent years, Armstrong could never win over French fans or journalists. A book on his life containing accusations of doping was published on the eve of the 2004 Tour. 

The leader of the US Postal team, which became the Discovery Channel team this year, he lost a Paris court case in 2004 when his request that the controversial book should include his denial of drug-taking was turned down. 

Armstrong said on Tuesday: Unfortunately, the witch-hunt continues and the article is nothing short of tabloid journalism. The paper even admits in its own article that the science in question here is faulty and that I have no way to defend myself. 

The American retired after winning his record seventh Tour de France in July. Since retiring, the Texan has concentrated on supporting the fight against cancer, pressing US President George W. Bush to boost spending on research.

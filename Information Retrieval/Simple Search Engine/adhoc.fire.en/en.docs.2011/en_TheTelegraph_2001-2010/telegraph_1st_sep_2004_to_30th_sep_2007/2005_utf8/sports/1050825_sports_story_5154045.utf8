French Open champion Rafael Nadal of Spain was seeded second ahead of Hewitt, while 2003 champion Andy Roddick was seeded fourth and Russias Marat Safin fifth. 

After becoming the first Russian woman to top the WTA rankings earlier this week, Sharapova was seeded ahead of American Lindsay Davenport, the runner-up at the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year.

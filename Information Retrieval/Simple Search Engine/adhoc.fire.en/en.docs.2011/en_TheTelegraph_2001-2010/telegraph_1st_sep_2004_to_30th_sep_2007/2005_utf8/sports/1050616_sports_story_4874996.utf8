 Greg Chappell arrives

Bangalore: Insisting that commitment to excellence was his motto, new coach Greg Chappell Wednesday said he had been working on lot of strategies to make the team best in the world. 

Committment to excellence is what we are going to work on, Chappell told reporters after his arrival in Bangalore this evening. 

The 57-year-old Australian, who takes over from New Zealander John Wright, would be based here as the National Cricket Academy is also situated in the city. 

Asked whether he had thought of specific strategies for the team, Chappell said he had been working a lot on them. I have been working on lot of things but nothing that we can talk about at this moment. 

The former Australian skipper also played down the pressure of expectations on him and said his job was to do the best he can.

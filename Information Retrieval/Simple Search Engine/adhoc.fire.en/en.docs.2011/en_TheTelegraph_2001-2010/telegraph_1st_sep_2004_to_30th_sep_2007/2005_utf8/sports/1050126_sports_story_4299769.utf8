 Leipus suggests Gloster

Mumbai: Australian John Gloster is all set to take charge of Team India from Andrew Leipus by next week. 

?I will be handing over charge to John (who looked after the Bangladesh team till recently) by next week and then go back to continue a five-month course. I am planning to return in India in July on personal work,? the South African told reporters after interacting with budding cricketers at the Cricket Club of India here on Tuesday. 

Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary S.K. Nair said that Leipus had suggested Gloster?s name to the board and a decision would be taken within a few days. 

?We will definitely consider his (Leipus) suggestion and decide within this week,? Nair added. 

On Sachin Tendulkar?s fitness, Leipus said, ?I have advised Sachin to take six weeks? rest and hopefully he would be able to play a few matches in domestic cricket before the home series against Pakistan?. 

?I sincerely hope Sachin gets fit for the home series and apart from him the other members of the squad should also be fit to take on Pakistan as many of them are already playing in the ongoing Deodhar Trophy,? Leipus added.

 - NORTON MEET 

 Tiger Woods in lead

Norton (US): Arjun Atwal carded a one-under 70 on the opening day of the $5.5 million Deutsche Bank championships at the Players Club of Boston. 

Atwal had a great start as he was three-under after four holes and then parred the next eight holes. 

Then came the horrendous streak that saw him run up three back-to-back bogeys from 13th to 15th holes. 

A birdie on the final 18th was a consolation, as he ended the day at one-under 70 in tied 46th place. 

Daniel Chopra started on the tenth and with three birdies and two bogeys and one double, he ended with a card of one-over 72 in tied 86th place. 

Tiger Woods grabbed the lead with a six-under 65. Woods had a flawless round and he birdied two of the three par-fives after reaching all three in two shots. 

He was one shot clear of the foursome of Billy Andrade, Carlos Franco, Steve Lowery and Briny Baird. 

In his seven events since missing the cut at the Byron Nelson Championship, Woods has won twice and finished at least tied fourth in each of his other five appearances. 

Vijai Singh could not return to defend his title because he injured his back and pulled out.

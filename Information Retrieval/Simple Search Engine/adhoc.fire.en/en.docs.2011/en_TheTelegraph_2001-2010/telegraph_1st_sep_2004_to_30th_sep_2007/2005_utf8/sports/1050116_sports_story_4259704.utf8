 Gill admits hiring Rach was a mistake

 - IHF chief rubbishes sprouting allegations 

 Gerhard Rach 

New Delhi: In a damage-control exercise, IHF president K.P.S. Gill Saturday dismissed the allegations made by former coach Gerhard Rach as ?absolute nonsense? and admitted that hiring him was a mistake. 

Gill had beside him IHF vice-president Narinder Batra, who has also raised his voice against the former super cop at a press conference here, but the IHF chief refused to answer the questions raised by his deputy in the last couple of days. 

While Batra toed Gill?s line on Rach, he also made it clear that he would contest against Gill if he chose to stand for another term. 

Admitting that the federation had made one or two mistakes, Gill said the IHF was ?forced? to appoint the German but now it would not take any decision under compulsions or ?media pressure?. 

?The federation has made a couple of mistakes... Appointing Rach was one of them. It was an error of judgement, our assessment of his character was wrong.? 

Asked about Rach?s statement that the IHF was like a ?madhouse?, he said, ?His knowledge of English is very poor, his choice of words leave a lot to be desired... I don?t respond to such trivialities. 

?Rach was in Chandigarh for 15 days. In such a small time he seems to have gathered a lot of knowledge or probably those who interviewed him briefed him too well,? he added sarcastically. 

Gill also said IHF did not owe Rach even a single penny and that he had never raised any objection during his seven-month tenure as the coach. 

?We used to speak regularly. In fact only since the last five-six days his phone had stopped responding, otherwise he had been in touch. He was happy with the team, he never complained about it or raised any objection about anything during his stint.? 

Gill, however, said in hindsight he did not regret appointing Rach. ?We were forced into that (appointing Rach), we had no option. We had asked him to be a coaching advisor, he stayed on and watched other teams in Germany and Holland. He kept the other coaches informed, these were the circumstances. ?Rach did a very good job. In the Olympics we played well in two-three matches.? 

Gill also did not agree that Indian hockey was on a downslide. ?We are ranked fifth in the world, we have to jump only one step.? 

On Batra?s allegations pertaining to financial irregularities, Gill said, ?Some questions have been asked, I will give an explanation at the executive committee meeting.? 

Gill ruled out sending a show cause notice to Batra. ?There is no question of sending any show cause notice,? he said. On the allegation of Rach that Dhanraj Pillay was taken into the Olympic team only on the behest of sponsors, Gill said ?it is absolute nonsense?. 

Meanwhile, vice-president Batra has begun to count the numbers on his side . 

?We are eight to ten of us talking among us. There is a very strong dissent,? said Batra. ?The president called me up and asked me to say in front of him whatever I had told the media earlier and written in my letter to secretary K. Jyothikumaran. I had no problem in doing that,? Batra said.

 Star Angel favourite 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Moon Emperor

Calcutta: With jockey B. Prakash opting for 

Star Angel in Sunday?s Derby, the double-Classic winning filly is being quoted 

as a 7-4 favourite in the eight-horse field. Aperitivo and Moon Emperor are next 

in demand at 3-1 each.

 Exclusive Affair, relatively most inexperienced horse in the field, is surprisingly attracting lot of money. Unbeaten in his two career starts, the Alnasr Alwasheek-Baroque Pearl son is in demand at 6-1 while Formal Invitation is less fancied at 10-1. 

 Calorific is a 15-1 shot and Bountiful Pleasure is a 25-1 outsider. Punters may write their own card on Make A Wish.

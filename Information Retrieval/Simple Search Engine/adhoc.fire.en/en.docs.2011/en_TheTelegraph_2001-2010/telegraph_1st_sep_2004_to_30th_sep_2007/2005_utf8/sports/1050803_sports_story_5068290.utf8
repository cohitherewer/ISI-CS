The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav set to open vs Lanka

 - TRI-SERIES - Yuvraj, Zaheer ruled out; Kumble may make Team India XI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Virender Sehwag and V.V.S. Laxman have a quick bite in between practice sessions in Dambulla 

Dambulla: Regulars Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan are (as of Tuesday night) to miss Wednesdays return clash against the formidable hosts, Sri Lanka. 

Yuvraj is down with fever and skipped the match-eve workout, while Zaheer is nursing a swelling on his left ankle ? the consequence of being hit in last Saturdays IndianOil Cup opener. 

According to sources, Yuvrajs non-availability could mean good news for teenaged Suresh Raina. 

Had Yuvraj been fit, both Raina and Yalaka Venugopal Rao would have had to be dropped to allow Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxmans comeback. Now, it seems only Venugopal will be axed. 

Zaheers berth may go to Anil Kumble and not Lakshmipathy Balaji. Neither made the XI in the first two matches. 

Jai Prakash Yadav isnt in contention. 

The fitness worries, though, havent unsettled captain Rahul Dravid. Ive never been too concerned with such developments, simply because everybody in the squad is good enough to play, he told The Telegraph. 

Asked whether too much was being made of Sri Lankas record at home ? the hosts, by the way, thrashed the West Indies on Tuesday, Dravid replied: Weve not been psyched out... At the same time, Sri Lanka do have a very impressive record. We need to bat better than in the opener... 

Both Dravid and coach Greg Chappell still feel a target of 250 (not 206) ought to have been set that evening. As it turned out, the hosts won by three wickets. 

An announcement hasnt been made, but one learns Sourav is going to open with Virender Sehwag. Laxman, who has recovered from back muscle spasms, is to bat at No.3. 

Chappell, by the way, apologised to his players for a heavy workload in the lead-up to a big match. 

There will be pain in the short-term for long-term gains... To reach the next level, everything (including nets) has to be done better, he explained after the match-eve workout. 

That was greeted with applause. The spontaneity suggested Dravid and Co. didnt mind having to sweat a lot more than they had bargained for. 

Chappell didnt tell the players ? not publicly, at least ? but did remind the Media there would be occasions when some would have to be taken out of the comfort zone. 

A smart exit line that. 

Meanwhile, Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu has indicated Sanath Jayasuriya and Chaminda Vaas wont be fielded on Wednesday as well. 

LIKELY INDIAN XI 

(as of Tuesday night) 

Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Mohammed Kaif, Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra.

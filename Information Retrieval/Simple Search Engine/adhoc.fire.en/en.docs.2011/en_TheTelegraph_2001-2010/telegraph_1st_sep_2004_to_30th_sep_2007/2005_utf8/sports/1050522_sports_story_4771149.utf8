 Arsenal champions

Cardiff: Arsenal became the first team to win the FA Cup final on penalties with an undeserved 5-4 victory over holders Manchester United after a goalless draw on Saturday. 

Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira coolly converted the final spot-kick in front of the United fans after his teammate Jens Lehmann had superbly saved a Paul Scholes penalty. 

Yet Arsenal, who finished the match with 10 men after Jose Antonio Reyes was sent off seconds from the end of extra time, were not the moral victors of a game in which their arch-rivals made all the best chances and enjoyed none of the luck. 

Inspired by teenage forward Wayne Rooney and winger Cristiano Ronaldo, United dominated the match and Arsenal failed to create a single clear-cut scoring chance over 90 minutes and badly missed injured striker Thierry Henry. 

While Arsenal showed none of their usual attacking fluency, United had a Rio Ferdinand effort disallowed in the first half, Rooney hit the post and Ruud van Nistelrooy was denied by the crossbar in the second. 

Alex Fergusons luckless side also had two penalty appeals waved away in extra time, which ended seconds after Arsenals Spanish forward Reyes became only the second player to be sent off in the final. 

The first chance fell to United after six minutes with a teasing run down the left by Ronaldo and a chipped cross that was headed over by Scholes. 

Arsenal had their share of possession and worked the ball well enough around the midfield, but United always looked the more dangerous going forward and could have been 3-0 up midway through the half. Ferdinand put the ball in the Arsenal net after Lehmann failed to hold a Rooney shot through the penalty area, only to have the strike ruled offside. (Reuters)

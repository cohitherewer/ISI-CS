The Australians raced to their victory target of 78 in just 97 minutes from 26.1 overs before lunch on the fifth and final day at Bellerive Oval. 

Mike Hussey struck 31 not out, including the winning runs, from 82 balls to win the Man-of-the-Match award after making 137 in the first innings, his maiden Test hundred. 

Its been a great game. Theres lot of positive to come out of it, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. 

Matthew Hayden, who also made a century in the first innings, was the lone batsman to be dismissed, throwing his wicket away for 46 with just one run needed for victory.

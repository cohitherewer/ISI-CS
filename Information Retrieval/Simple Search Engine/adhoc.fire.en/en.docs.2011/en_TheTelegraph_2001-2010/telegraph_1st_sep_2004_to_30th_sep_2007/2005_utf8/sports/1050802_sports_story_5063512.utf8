 Sanskara may bounce back to form before Classics 

 STAR RACER

 Trainer Errol Bhungard had all the luck on his side last Friday. His tally for the day was four, though he really deserved to lead in two ? Regal Successor and Arabie. The other victories ? Renegade and One For Me ? were, rather, presented to him on a silver plate.

 If the slipped-saddle of a less-fancied Mischevious Notes helped the friendless Renegades cause in the 1,200m Aladancer Plate, Karans Choices ambitious gallop on the rail-side soft track brought about her downfall, though Harvinder Baths filly enjoyed a near three-length lead in the last 150 metres. She was caught napping in her last stride.

 Vijay Singhs Spectacular Star ran third, a fair effort, which could have furthered the horses cause had his jockey apprentice, Shane Domingo, not lost his whip in the stretch run. 

 In the Renegades race, both Alcinia and Sailing Home galloped leisurely. If expectations were high from the former in her debut run, a slow start ruined whatever chances Sailing Home had in the race. Both Renegade and One For Me won by very close margins.

 Regal Successor was, however, a deserving winner. A tearaway type, the Wassl Reef-Helens Dynasty son was held in a tight grip with a length lead over the field by the visiting jockey G. Ross till the final turn. The moment the four-year-old was given some rope, he skidded clear of the opposition to suggest more will be heard of him in coming weeks.

 Errols Exotic Strides remains a blood-sucker with numerous failures to his name in the past 18 months. It was another friendless Amazing Blaze who humbled the Bhungard-favourite with a long lead from the start in the 1,200m Avaglow Handicap. 

 Bharaths Sanskara was expected to do justice to her winter form, but the she turned out to be a big let down in the feature event, the 1,400m Harry The Horse Cup ? her lead up race to the Classics. The 35-100 hot favourite was no match for Daniels Magical Strike, a convincing winner in his previous start. She was always in contention but lacked acceleration when most needed. Her run is best ignored as she is sure to bounce back stronger in the coming weeks.

 In the 1,400m Roll N Twist Cup, favourite Arabie led from the start and held on to the advantage. However, Bhungards ward was also somewhat lucky as the strongly fancied Rare Beauty had taken a slow jump out. But she was immediately hustled up to gain the position behind the leader. Such manoeuvrings wore down the Javed Khan-trainee who looked tired in the end. Yet it was her courageous effort that fetched her the third slot close behind the winner. Rheinheart made a belated surge to finish a good second.

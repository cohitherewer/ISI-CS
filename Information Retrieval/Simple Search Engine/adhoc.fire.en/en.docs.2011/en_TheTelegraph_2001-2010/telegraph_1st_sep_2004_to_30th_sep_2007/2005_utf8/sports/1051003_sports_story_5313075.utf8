 Mushtaq ready to spin a web around England

Lahore: Pakistan legspinner Mushtaq Ahmed said on Sunday that he was confident of playing a key role against England next month if selected. 

The 35-year-old said he had studied the England batsmen closely during his county stint at Sussex. 

If I am recalled, I can still spin a web around the England batsmen, said Mushtaq, who is tipped to earn a recall after two years of being out of the national side. 

Pakistan host England for three Tests and a five-match one-day series. The first Test starts in Multan from November 12. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and coach Bob Woolmer have hinted at giving Mushtaq another chance after the bearded leg-spinner took 80 wickets for Sussex. 

His efforts helped the country finish second behind champions Nottinghamshire and boosted his chances of playing for Pakistan. 

I am right up there and enjoying my bowling, and if my country needs me, I will be there and even if, god forbid, I am not recalled, I am ready to pass on my experience and my knowledge of the English batsmen, he said. 

Mushtaq, who played last of his 52 Tests against South Africa two years ago, said he was confident he could get under Englands skin despite their recent Ashes success. 

England are now a very confident side with players like Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen, but I have special plans for both of them and have dismissed them cheaply, said Mushtaq, who made his debut against England in 1987. (AFP)

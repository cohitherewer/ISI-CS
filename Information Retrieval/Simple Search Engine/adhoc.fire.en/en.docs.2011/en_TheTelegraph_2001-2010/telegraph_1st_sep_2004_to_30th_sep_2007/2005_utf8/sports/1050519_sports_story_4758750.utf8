 Ruiz reinstated

Las Vegas: The WBA reinstated John Ruiz as WBA heavyweight champion, effective immediately after it was learned that James Toney was in violation of the illegal substance rule after he claimed the title from Ruiz. 

Toney, who assumed the title with a convincing unanimous decision over Ruiz in late April, had to give the belt back less than two weeks after the New York State Athletic Commission overturned the victory ? ruling it a no decision. 

Toney was suspended for 90 days with a fine of $10,000. In addition, Toney is barred from fighting for the WBA title for two years. 

However, the NYSAC did not specify which drug resulted in the positive test, but Toneys camp has identified it as the steroid nandrolone. 

A WBA letter addressed to Toney on Tuesday stated the following: quot;Based on the actions of the New York State Athletic Commission and the test results on which the Commission relied, the WBA must vacate your championship ranking and reinstate John Ruiz as the champion. quot; 

Under WBA regulations, the former champion gets the title back if the fight is declared a no contest, which it was after Toneys positive test. 

Ruiz announced his retirement after the setback to Toney, but changed his mind last week ironically just before Toneys tests results were released. Toney had won the April 30 bout decisively on all three scorecards, as he claimed the title that Ruiz won with a victory over Hasim Rahman. (ReuterS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Not the end of the road for Sourav

 - Citys sporting fraternity feels the former captain should have been brought back into Team India

Calcutta: Team India, once conceived and controlled by Sourav Ganguly, may have no place for him now, but this is certainly not the end of road for him, feels the sporting fraternity who has seen him grow and rule international cricket from close quarters. 

For former national selector and captain of Ranji-winning Bengal team Sambaran Banerjee, Sourav as opener is still capable of causing sleepless nights to his opponents, while former Olympian Gurbux Singh, its all about the famous Indian psyche of not disturbing the winning combination. 

Heres what they had to say about Souravs exclusion from the Team India ODI squad till the Ahmedabad match: 

SAMBARAN BANERJEE: Its a policy usually used all over the world that if a team keeps on winning, it is not changed unless there are fitness problems for some players. 

But my personal feeling is that Sourav should have got his place back in Team India on two counts. Firstly, Gautam Gambhir is not getting chances and he could have been dropped and his place gone to Sourav. Secondly, its high time to give (Virender) Sehwag a big shake-up by dropping him for a few matches, since hes not been performing true to his potential of late. 

BHAICHUNG BHUTIA: Im sorry I have not been following the developments around him. So, I think Im not in a position to comment on this issue. 

 Ashok 

 Malhotra: I knew it would be tough for Sourav, once 

 the team has comprehensively won the last two matches. In 

 this case, it was tough for the selectors too. Personally, 

 I wouldnt have liked to be in a selectors chair 

 this time. 

Now Sourav will have to dig deep and come back into the side. Selectors wanted him perform and prove his fitness, which he did (with a century in Duleep Trophy), but still none can be blamed for his exclusion. 

But I will not like to write off Sourav as he is a champion. 

JAIDIP MUKERJEA: Its very unfair that Sourav was not considered for the next three ODIs. You cant leave a class like him out in such a way and he shouldve been picked in the squad. Well, its understandable that he was not considered for the first couple of matches on fitness grounds. 

But its really unfortunate that hes now being made a scapegoat out of all this. Since he was asked to prove his fitness and form and he did it in style, how can you ignore one with about 15000 international runs? 

GURBUX SINGH: I think it started out to be a touch-and-go issue, but ultimately, it boiled down to the Indian psyche that when a team is doing well, you shouldnt disturb it. 

The selectors might have acted on such a psyche, but when you are talking about the 2007 World Cup, Sourav should straightaway walk into the team not only for his game, but the vastness of his experience as well.

 ?Respect govt decision?

 - Onus now on Shiv Sena: Miandad 

 Miandad is all for tour to be on

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and coach Javed Miandad Friday urged the Shiv Sena to respect the Indian governments? decision to resume cricketing and political ties between the two countries and play a responsible role in smoothening that process. 

?The decision of the government should be respected, particularly when it is related to sports. I think the onus now lay on how they (Shiv Sena) respond and react,? Miandad said here. 

?I remember that extremist groups (in Pakistan) had initially resisted Indian team?s tour of Pakistan but later acted responsibly that eventually enhanced Pakistan?s image as a moderate, sports-loving and tolerant country,? Miandad said while reacting to reports of a handful of Sena activists causing ?very minor damage? to the pitch at the Punjab Cricket Association Thursday. 

The activists, however, were nabbed by the security personnel before they could cause any serious damage to the pitch. 

The incident brought back memories of 1999 when Shiv Sena men dug up the Kotla pitch. Pakistan did play a Test match there, and Anil Kumble bowled India to victory with his record 10-wicket haul in the second innings. 

Miandad, who invited Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray to be his personal guest for the 1996 World Cup games in Pakistan and also visited Thackeray in Mumbai last year, said as far as he was concerned, he would not think for a second regarding touring India despite Shiv Sena?s most recent reaction. 

?I like to meet challenges and when someone tries to stop me from doing something particular, I become more determined to do it,? Miandad, who was Pakistan coach on the 1999 tour, said. 

?Even in 1999 when they dug up the Kotla pitch, we went ahead with the tour because we had the clearance from the Pakistan government and security assurances were given by the Indian government. I expect a similar script this time.? 

He advised the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Pakistan team not to be scared by these distracting factors and stay focused on cricket. ?Their (Pakistan team?s) job is to play cricket while security is the responsibility of the host nation who are capable of accomplishing their assignments.?

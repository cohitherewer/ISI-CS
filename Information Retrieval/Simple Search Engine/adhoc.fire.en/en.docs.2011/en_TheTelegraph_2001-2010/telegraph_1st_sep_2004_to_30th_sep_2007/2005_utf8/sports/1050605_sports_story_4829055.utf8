 Motivator has it easy in Epsom DerbyMurtagh 

 Epsom: Motivator, the 3-1 favourite ridden by Johnny Murtagh, romped to a five-length victory in the Epsom Derby on Saturday.

 Walk in the Park (11-1), the mount of Alan Munro, ran on in the closing stages to take second place in the 13-strong field. Frankie Dettoris mount Dubawi, a 5-1 shot, finished third for the Godophin stable of Sheikh Mohammed, three lengths behind the runner-up.

 It was Murtaghs third success in the classic following wins in 2000 on Sinndar and High Chaparral in 2002.

 Saturdays winner and runner-up are both by the same sire, Montjeu.

 Murtagh begins his two day suspenssion from Sunday. The jockey was cleared on Wednesday to ride favourite Motivator in the Derby after his three-day ban for careless riding was reduced on appeal. (Reuters)

 Joshna falters in title round 

Chennai: Joshna Chinappa faltered at the final hurdle as she lost to Egypts Raneem el Weleily in straight games in the final of the world junior squash meet that concluded in Belgium on Tuesday. 

Top-seeded Joshna was totally off-colour and a bundle of nerves in her loss to the second seeded Egyptian at 3-9, 4-9, 8-10, according to information reaching here. 

Weleily pinned Joshna to the back-court. It was only in the third game that the Indian threatened her rival, albeit briefly, taking an initial lead but Weleily, No. 36 in the WISPA ranking, got back into her rhythm. Though Joshna saved a match point, the Egyptian managed to win the match on single extra point. 

Joshna, ranked 60 on the WISPA, attributed her loss to lack of strong sparring partners. 

Perhaps, I need to practise with an equally strong player back home. I will now concentrate on the Asian Games and Asian-level meet in the WISPA. On my return, I will undergo a physical training programme and then move to Amsterdam to train under Liz Irving, she said. (PTI)

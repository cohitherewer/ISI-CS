Rome: A fair-play gesture backfired badly for Andy Roddick as Spains Fernando Verdasco came back from the brink of defeat to oust the top seed 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 in the third round of the Rome Masters on Thursday. 

One set down and serving at 3-5 and 0-40 in the second, a linesman called Verdascos second serve out and the umpire started to announce the American as the winner. 

Roddick, however, corrected the call, telling the umpire the ball was in. Verdasco went on to hold serve and then break his distracted-looking opponent in the following game. 

The set went to a tie-break, which the Spaniard won easily by whipping crosscourt winners off both wings. 

Roddick then put a forehand wide to drop serve in the opening game of the decider and the unseeded Verdasco, now playing with increasing confidence, went on to claim victory. His reward will be a quarter-final against fellow claycourt specialist and number nine seed Guillermo Coria of Argentina, who crushed home favourite Davide Sanguinetti 6-0, 6-4. 

?Maybe I should have stood on the mark,? Roddick joked with reporters.?I dont think I did anything extraordinary, the umpire would have come down and said the same too. I just saved him the trip. 

?When he (Verdasco) hit it, before I saw the mark, I thought it was out. On a hardcourt I wouldnt have done anything but then I walked back and saw it was good.? 

Fourth seed Tim Henman of Britain tumbled out when he lost 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 to Slovak Dominik Hrbaty but sixth seed Andre Agassi remained on course to repeat his 2002 victory in Rome. 

The 35-year-old American gave a near-faultless display to defeat Ivan Ljubicic 7-6, 6-3. 

The big-serving Croat has already reached four finals this year and had won his last two matches against Agassi, including one contest in the Davis Cup earlier this season. 

After swapping breaks in a tight first set, Agassi dominated the tie-break, finding the range and pace on his groundstrokes to fire a series of winners. He maintained his concentration in the second set, breaking Ljubicic to love in the second game and serving out for victory. 

Spains Alberto Martin also progressed with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Luis Horna of Peru. 

Late on Wednesday, Australian Open champion and second seed Marat Safin tumbled out, beaten by Spanish teenage qualifier Nicolas Almagro 6-4, 6-3. 

?Today I just couldnt hurt him at all. I was running from side to side and I didnt have any chance to beat him ? thats what bothered me,? said a bewildered Safin afterwards. ?He played solidly ? nothing spectacular ? it was just me. I couldnt play my game.? 

Nineteen-year-old Almagro, who is world-ranked 101 and only reached the main draw through qualifying, was outclassed for most of the first set, but stubbornly fended off a succession of break points. 

The balance of the match swung as Safin served to level the scores at 4-5 down. A disputed net cord caused the Russian to lose concentration and the next three points to concede the first set. 

Twice in the second set Safin broke serve, only to be pegged back by the Spaniard. Almagro gained the decisive break in the eighth game when a weak drop shot by Safin allowed him to send a winning pass down the line. 

Almagros win underlined the strength of the new generation of Spanish claycourt specialists, spearheaded by his 18-year-old compatriot Rafael Nadal, who also reached the last 16 by sweeping aside Romanian qualifier Victor Hanescu 6-1, 6-1.

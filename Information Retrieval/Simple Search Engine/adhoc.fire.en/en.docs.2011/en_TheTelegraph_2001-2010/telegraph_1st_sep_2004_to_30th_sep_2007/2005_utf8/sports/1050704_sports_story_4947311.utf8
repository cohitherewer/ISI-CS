 Hidayat at it again

Singapore: Indonesias Taufik Hidayat put on a sparkling display of attacking badminton to capture his second Singapore Open title with a 15-9, 15-3 victory over Chinas Chen Hong on Sunday. 

Despite Chens defeat, China enjoyed a successful finals day at the penultimate event before Augusts world championships, taking three of the five titles on offer. Indonesia won the other two. 

Building on a stirring semi-final victory over world No. 1 Lin Dan, the eighth-seeded Olympic champion bullied Chen into submission after a tentative opening to the contest that was highlighted by delicate drop shots. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Hewitt was like Connors sans obscene gestures

 After an ordinary start, Safin produced three 

sets of awesome tennis

The first Grand Slam of 2005, the centenary Australian 

Open, was a memorable event. The long, at times monotonous, baseline rallies of 

supreme skill scripted a fascinating fortnight.

Marat Safin, the 25-year-old six-foot-four Russian, 

emerged triumphant, winning his second Grand Slam title after a gap of nearly 

five years. After an error-strewn first set in the final, Safin moved out of his 

mental maze into ?the zone? and produced three sets of awesome power and skill 

overwhelming Australian hope Lleyton Hewitt in four sets.

Hewitt was at his fighting best, but even with cries 

of ?come on? and piston-like fist pumping, he couldn?t summon enough power to 

counter Safin?s brilliance. As the lights went out on the first Australian Open 

final played at night, the crestfallen crowd, their hopes dashed, melted into 

the Melbourne night.

Come 2006, it will be exactly 30 years since an Australian 

(Mark Edmonston) last won the Australian Open. Aussie hearts pine for greats like 

Laver, Rosewall, Hoad, Emerson and a host of others now buried in history.

But wait a minute. Hewitt is no pushover, he is now 

No. 2 in the world. He came back from a decline, showing off rippling biceps and 

triceps wearing a sleeveless shirt. Physically stronger after some very rigorous 

training, Hewitt has added power to his groundshots and quite a few kilometres 

on his service.

His top-spin lob, which so many times left Safin standing 

in despair, has touches of Laver. But Hewitt is reluctant to attack from the net 

and, in my view, this is a significant shortcoming at the highest level. His intense 

passion, commitment and fighting spirit were a joy to watch and his matches lit 

up the fortnight. It was like watching Jimmy Connors without the obscene gestures.

Roger Federer lost a great match to Safin. In defeat 

he was dignified and composed. The flashes of brilliance which set him apart from 

the mortals waned as the match reached the concluding stages. Whether it was fatigue 

or the burden of winning an unprecedented 26 matches in a row was not clear. To 

me, Federer looked tired and faded. It could be that he had injured himself, and 

chose not talk to about it.

Whatever the reason, his earlier matches showed that 

he belongs to a different world, but will have to be at his best to tackle Safin 

on song. Federer?s big test will come in May on the slow clay of Roland Garros 

in the French Open. If he can win there, it will be a step ahead from the great 

Sampras.

Second seed Andy Roddick was most disappointing. I 

was surprised to see him slicing a single-handed backhand and choosing quite often 

to help the ball in play. His game is rooted in aggression. To curb his natural 

attacking instincts will destroy him. He is best with the accelerator flat to 

the boards. Parting from his coach, the wily fox Brad Gilbert, could prove to 

be his biggest blunder.

Tennis is no longer in the grip of Australians or 

the Americans. Russia, Argentina, Spain, France and a host of other countries 

have an inquenchable thirst for success. Watch them play and you can see how hard 

they try ? as if their lives depend on the result.

Seventh seeded Serena Williams, who last won a Slam 

in 2003 (Wimbledon), came back from her injuries to win the women?s singles. Just 

one point away from defeat in the semi-final against Maria Sharapova, she fought 

back tenaciously to win in three sets. Serena?s greater experience won the day.

In defeat, Sharapova was impressive. She has matured 

and become physically stronger since Wimbledon. She now has more power on her 

service and groundshots and, with experience, has scope to improve further. I 

like the way she goes for her shots fearlessly. Not once did I see Sharapova push 

or pat the ball back.

Davenport was in devastating form and seemed well 

on way to the title. After demolishing Serena in the first set, Davenport had 

many break-points at 2-2 in the second set but could not convert. Then, at 2-3, 

Davenport lost serve after being up 40-0! After that, Davenport folded like an 

accordion.

Serena may have won the title but she was far from 

the confident champion of her pre-injury days. Her forehand is vulnerable and 

will be mercilessly pummelled by the Russian girls on slower surfaces. For me, 

the William sisters are bewildering phenomena. They have tenaciously clung to 

their off-court interests. Placed No. 6 on a list of worst-dressed women and being 

called a ?cat walk? menace has not affected Serena in any way apart from signing 

a $60 million shoe and clothing contract with Nike!

Their liberated and futuristic thinking has rubbished 

the hallowed concept of total tunnel-visioned focus to be a great champion. Hot 

pants gallantly struggling with bulging buttocks, micro-mini skirts, high-tech 

cooling mesh fabrics are some of Serena-endorsed creations. When the Martians 

land to play against the earth in the Inter Galactio Cup, they may pick a thing 

or two from Serena?s haute couture collection!

Apart from Sharapova, the Russian brigade drew a blank. 

The slow clay tournaments, their favourite hunting grounds, are just a couple 

of months away. Myskina, Dementieva, Kuznetsova, Zvonareva, Petrova are now seasoned 

campaigners and will spice up women?s tennis in 2005.

Alicia Molik, the young Australian, is the new emerging 

star. Strongly built, tall and tough, she has a delightful all-court game. She 

beat Venus Williams and went out in a close match to Davenport in the quarters. 

We will read a lot about her in the coming months as she?ll be right on top of 

the women?s game.

How can I conclude this article without talking about 

Sania Mirza. I was stunned to see her with one of those back-breaking garlands 

in an open jeep heading a motorcade to Raj Bhavan! Again, at her school brandishing 

a sword, like today?s Jhansi ki Rani! For a third-round appearance in a Grand 

Slam, this is a bit too much.Her hungry promoters are to blame for this. One is 

inclined to overlook this. Which one of us can resist wishing her well with her 

fresh bubbling utterances, the nose ring, the head mistress spectacles and gypsy 

earrings. I despair for her when I see the Amazons in women?s tennis. They are 

bigger, stronger, better and merciless.

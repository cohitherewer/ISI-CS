The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Biswajit quits, blames officials

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings joy of defeating East Bengal was short-lived as coach Biswajit Bhattacharya announced his decision to resign in a post match press conference on Thursday owing to a fallout with the club officials. 

In his resignation letter addressed to the general secretary of the club, Bhattacharya said that the atmosphere of the club has made it nearly impossible for him to work freely for the betterment of the team. Bhattacharya also raised fingers at the football secretary and the ground secretary, holding them responsible for the fiasco which affected the dressing room culture as well. 

But the story in the rival camp was a little different with East Bengal coach Subash Bhowmick sporting a dejected look as his players failed to live up to his expectations. 

His disappointment of missing some of the main players was evident as he said: I had to play with the best possible side that was available. I hope that within a day or two I will get my players and we will be able to perform well. 

Now I am only concentrating on the next match (against Mohun Bagan).

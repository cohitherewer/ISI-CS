Kandy: Sri Lankan fast bowler Chaminda Vaas grabbed six wickets to help his team seize control of the second Test against the West Indies before rain halted play early on Saturday. 

Sri Lanka, leading by two runs after bowling out the West Indies for 148 in the morning, made amends for their poor performance in the first innings with 146 for two in the second, finishing with a lead of 148 at the close. 

Sangakkara batted for nearly two hours for his unbeaten 46 and Jayawardene was batting on 38. 

Vaas was in ominous form in the morning, snapping up two wickets in his first over of the day to finish with six for 22 from 15 overs. 

Vaas needed just three balls to trap wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin leg before for 13 with an inswinger. Three balls later, Daren Powell (0) ended up chopping on to his leg stump. Left-arm spinner Jayasuriya broke through in the opening over of the day as Narsingh Deonarine added just four runs to his overnight score before he was caught and bowled for 40. 

Vaas is confident of recovering from a side strain in time to lead the hosts new ball attack in the second innings. 

I expect to be alright in the second innings and I am now looking forward to another chance to bowl as Im bowling well at the moment, he added.

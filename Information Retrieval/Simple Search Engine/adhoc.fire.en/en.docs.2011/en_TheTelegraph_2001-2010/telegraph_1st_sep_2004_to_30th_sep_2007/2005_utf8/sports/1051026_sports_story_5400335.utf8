 Bindra: BCCI lost Rs 44 crore 

Mohali: Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) president Inderjit Singh Bindra fired yet another salvo at the Board claiming that BCCI had lost Rs 44 crore by awarding telecast rights for ODI series against Sri Lanka and South Africa to Prasar Bharti. 

Bindra, incidentally, was a member of the marketing committee, didnt attend the all-important meeting, where Doordharshan bagged rights. 

Doordarshan clinched the deal after offering BCCI a deal of Rs 7.5 crore per match. Another TV company had offered the board Rs 135 crore for telecast of 12 matches as against Rs 91 crore what it will get now, Bindra said on Tuesday. 

The former BCCI chief said the board was playing a fraud with the countrys cricketers and the cricket-crazy public as the rights for the 12 matches had been awarded to Nimbus for 1.75 million dollars as against Nimbus own offer of $5 million. 

It is a big fraud with the cricketers, state associations and the general public. Last year, the board lost Rs 350 crore by undervaluing what it could have earned by awarding various rights, Bindra said adding that he had approached Delhi High Court on Monday regarding the alleged fraud by the Board.

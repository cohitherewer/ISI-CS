 West take lead versus North 

Lucknow: North Zone?s highly rated batsmen failed to live up to the expectations as the side suffered a dramatic collapse to concede the first innings lead to West Zone in the Duleep Trophy cricket match on Wednesday. 

North, who were sitting pretty at 113 for two after dismissing their rivals for 201 overnight, began cautiously in the morning session before being bowled out for 195 with spinners Rajesh Pawar and Ramesh Powar doing the maximum damage. 

North, who were 151 for three at one stage, lost their last seven wickets for just 45 runs at the K. D. Singh Babu Stadium. 

West, in their second innings, were 146 for five at close of play on the second day. 

Earlier, North resumed at the overnight score of 114 for two but soon crumbled to West?s double spin attack of Ramesh and Rajesh, who claimed four wickets each. 

First to depart was Akash Chopra, who managed to add just one more run to his overnight score of 44, edging a catch to wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel off Zaheer Khan. 

Yuvraj Singh (21) did not last long and was smartly stumped by Parthiv off Ramesh. Ravneet Ricky followed soon after making 33. 

Dinesh Mongia (2) also disappointed when he was caught by Wasim Jaffar of Ramesh. 

The last six batsmen added only 45 runs as North was bundled out soon after the lunch break. 

West began their second innings on a confident note through openers Satyajit Parab and Wasim Jaffar before Parab (14) fell leg before to part-time bowler Dinesh Mongia. 

Jaffer, meanwhile, exhibited some classic shots and made 47 runs from 93 balls with the help of seven fours before being caught by Akash Chopra off Gagandeep Singh. 

Next to depart was Dheeraj Jadhav (31) when he failed to read an incoming delivery of Amit Mishra and was caught plumb in front. 

Parthiv Patel (1) did little to impress the national selectors with his batting prowess and was out to brilliant catch by Yuvraj when the ball popped up after hitting the wicketkeeper?s gloves. 

Brief Scores: West Zone 201 amp; 146/5 (Dheeraj Jadhav 31). North Zone 196 (Akash Chopra 44, Virender Sehwag 33, Ravneet Ricky 33; Rajesh Pawar 4/30, Ramesh Powar 4/40). Match to continue.

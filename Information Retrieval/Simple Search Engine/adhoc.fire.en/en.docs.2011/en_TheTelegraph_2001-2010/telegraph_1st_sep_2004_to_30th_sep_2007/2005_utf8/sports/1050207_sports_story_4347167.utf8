 Good chance for the young guys: Dravid 

 - CHALLENGER TROPHY BEGINS TODAY 

Mumbai: Rahul Dravid, captain of India A, who take on India Senior led by Sourav Ganguly Monday under lights to kick off the Challenger Trophy, feels the tournament will provide a great opportunity for the young players to make a mark. 

?It is a great tournament. The best 36 players of the country will be seen in action. It?s a fantastic opportunity for the new guys to make a mark,? he said. 

Dravid practised with a few teammates, including the fit-again Lakshimpathi Balaji, Murali Kartik, Dinesh Karthik and Irfan Pathan. 

About his own preparation, Dravid said after the welcome break from cricket he was slowly getting set through stints at the nets. 

?It was a good break. I got a chance to put my feet up. Now I am slowly getting back into it by practising,? he added. 

Dravid said he felt the team would not face any problem in adjusting to new physio John Gloster, who has replaced Andrew Leipus and is set to take charge Monday, as ?both are thorough professionals.? 

?Andrew made a huge difference to the team since he joined us in 1999. Prior to his arrival not much attention was paid to this aspect of the game. We will miss him as a friend, but the man who replaces him is also a thorough professional and I don?t expect any problem. 

?It is true he will take some time to settle down. He?s joining the team well in advance (of the Pakistan tour) and has got time to know the boys who would work with him,? Dravid said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 First hour crucial for Bengal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Before the crucial Ranji Trophy tie vs Madhya Pradesh, Bengal were looking up to Team India captain Sourav Ganguly to save relegation from the Elite group. 

Coach Karsan Ghavri said he is looking upto three batsmen ? Sourav, Devang Gandhi and Laxmi Ratan Shukla to save Bengal the blushes. 

?I am praying for two big partnerships from the three. Only then we will be able to avoid relegation,? Ghavri said after the day?s play. 

The coach feels that till such time that Sourav (batting on four) stays put at the crease, Bengal can?t be written off. ?He has played so many big innings for the country. We are all hoping he does the same here.? 

Madhya Pradesh captain Amay Khurasia seemed a bit hesitant about celebrating their stay in the Elite Group. ?We are obviously in the driver?s seat. But as long as Sourav is there we cannot take anything for granted,? Khurasia stated. He also made it clear that the first hour on the penultimate day would be crucial.

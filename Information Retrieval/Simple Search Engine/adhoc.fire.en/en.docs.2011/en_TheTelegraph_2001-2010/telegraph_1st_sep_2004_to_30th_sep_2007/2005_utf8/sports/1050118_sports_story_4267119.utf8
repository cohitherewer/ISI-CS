 Federer?s cricket angle

Melbourne: Having conquered tennis, cricket might be next up for Roger Federer. 

The three-time 2004 Grand Slam champion won his opening match on Monday at the Australian Open, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 over France?s Fabrice Santoro. During the match, he hit a cricket-style defensive shot back at Santoro, prompting questions about his cricket prowess. 

?I haven?t actually ever played, never really with a bat,? said Federer. ?I don?t know, get a few nice balls from some real cricket players, that would be fun to see how it is for a change.? (AP)

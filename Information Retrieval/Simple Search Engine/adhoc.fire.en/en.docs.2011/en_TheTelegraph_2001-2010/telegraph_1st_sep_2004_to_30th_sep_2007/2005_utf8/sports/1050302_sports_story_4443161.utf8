 Diwadkar passes away

Mumbai: Former Mumbai captain and allrounder Sharad Diwadkar died here on Tuesday following a massive heart attack. 

He was 69 and is survived by wife and two sons, according to Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty. 

Diwadkar, who was the executive secretary of the Indian cricket board for more than five years, collapsed while taking his regular evening walk along with another ex-Mumbai and India cricketer Polly Umrigar near his residence in Worli in south central Mumbai, Shetty said. 

Diwadkar, a fine off-spinner in his heydays, whose career clashed with those of Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, had succeeded Umrigar as the BCCI?s executive secretary. 

Diwadkar had accompanied Harbhajan Singh to London to have his action corrected by Fred Titmus when Harbhajan?s action first came under the microscope. (PTI)

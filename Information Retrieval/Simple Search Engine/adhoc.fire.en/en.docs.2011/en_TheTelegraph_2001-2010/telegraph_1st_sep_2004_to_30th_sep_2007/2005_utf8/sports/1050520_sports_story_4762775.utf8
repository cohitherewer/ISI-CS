 Mickey Arthur is SA coach

Johannesburg: Mickey Arthur was appointed coach of South Africa on Thursday. Arthur, 37, succeeds Ray Jennings, whose six-month contract as interim coach expired after South Africas tour to the West Indies ended last weekend. 

Arthur, whose appointment was confirmed at a news conference, is under contract until the end of the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Jennings had led South Africa to a 2-0 Test series win and a 5-0 whitewash in the one-day Internationals against the West Indies. 

A former opening batsman for Griqualand West and Free State, Arthur began coaching at first-class level after he retired as a player four years ago. 

South Africas first series under Arthur will be at home against New Zealand in October. 

Arthur swiftly stated his ambition was to make his team the best in the world. I believe I can step into the breach and make a difference. We have to create a platform for the players to perform to the best of their ability, he said. 

He added: Were looking to become the best team in the world in both formats of the game. To do that no player can be allowed to rest on his laurels. 

Arthur will be given an opportunity to measure his teams progress when South Africa, sixth-ranked Test team and fourth-ranked one-day side, tour Australia in December. The world champion Australians will tour South Africa in February. 

Its the right time, because after that tour we will know where we stand if we want to be the number one team in the world, Arthur said. 

Arthur challenged perceptions that he was not experienced enough to coach an international team. Ive been involved in this game for 19 years, he said. In fact, you could say that my masters degree is in cricket. Ive been through the junior ranks as a coach and Ive coached the South African A team and at provincial level. 

If youre ready to take the position youre old enough.

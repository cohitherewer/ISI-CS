 Shoaib to undergo crucial fitness test

Lahore: Pakistans controversial speedster Shoaib Akhtar faces a make-or-break test of his fitness and commitment this week ahead of the home series against England. 

The 30-year-old returned to Pakistan from Australia on Sunday amid a chorus of questions about his poor fitness record and attitude. 

With his age he is at the crossroads, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan said. 

Pakistan hope Shoaib, who has 144 wickets in 36 Tests, proves his fitness in a practice camp this week and later in a trial match, and be selected against England in the first Test at Multan from November 12. 

Coach Bob Woolmer still has him in his plans. 

He is in our scheme of things because he is a genuine fast bowler, but question is whether he can last five days of a Test and 15 of the series, said Woolmer. 

Rameez Raja, former captain and ex-CEO of the Pakistan Cricket Board, said Shoaib has a lot to prove. 

Its up to Akhtar to prove everyone wrong. There are always lots of expectations of him and he has got to prove a point to everyone against England and then against India, said Rameez. (AFP)

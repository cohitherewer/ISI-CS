 Shoaib misses deadline

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar appeared to be inviting more trouble after he failed to reply in time to a showcause notice by the PCB for violating their contract during the tour of Australia. 

A PCB spokesman from Lahore said that till the offices were closed, they had not received any reply from the temperamental fast bowler, whose deadline was Monday evening. 

Meanwhile, a 16-member Pakistan squad for the three-Test 

series against India will be announced on February 18, chairman of selectors Wasim 

Bari said on Monday. (PTI)

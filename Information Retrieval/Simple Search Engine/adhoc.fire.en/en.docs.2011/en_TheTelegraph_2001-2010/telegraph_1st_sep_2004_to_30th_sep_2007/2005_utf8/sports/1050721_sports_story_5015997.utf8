 Suwon: PSV Eindhoven coach Guus Hiddink will take charge of Australia?s national side if they qualify for next year?s World Cup. The Dutchman said on Wednesday that he had reached a basic agreement with Football Federation Australia (FFA) to become the next coach of the Socceroos.

 ?If Australia qualify for the 2006 World Cup, then I will take over (by) November,? Hiddink said after PSVs 1-1 draw with Olympique Lyon at the Peace Cup pre-season tournament. ?We just have to agree on some details before finalising (the deal).? 

 London: Chelsea have settled out of court with former Spanish midfielder Enrique De Lucas who sued the English champions for more than ? 2.5 million ($4.37 million) after they terminated his contract in 2003.

 De Lucas began a London High Court action on Monday, seeking damages in unpaid wages, bonuses, appearance fees, accommodation and other expenses, including English language tuition. ?Chelsea FC and Enrique De Lucas are pleased to announce that they have settled their differences in relation to the High Court claim brought by Mr De Lucas,? a joint statement said on Wednesday.

 London: World No. 6 Serena Williams has withdrawn from next week?s WTA tournament in Stanford because of an ankle injury.

 The tournament was to have been Serena?s first since she lost to American Jill Craybas in the third round of Wimbledon last month.

 ?I took some time off after Wimbledon to try to get fit again, which is what my doctors advised me to do, but that has not allowed me sufficient time to train and be fully prepared to compete at a high level next week,? the American said in a statement on Wednesday.

 ?So, I am going to work hard the next several days to get ready for the remainder of the summer hardcourt season and ultimately the US Open.? 

 Lausanne: The Court of Arbitration (CAS) upheld Austrian skier Hans Knauss 18-month doping ban Wednesday, finding him negligent for using nutritional supplements containing steroids.

 Knauss had appealed to CAS, seeking to have his ban reduced to one year. But a three-man panel said the 18-month penalty was ?fair and reasonable and ruled that Knauss will remain ineligible until May 26, 2006. 

 The decision means the 34-year-old Knauss will miss the Winter Olympics in Turin in february. 

 Sofia: Bulgaria?s Olympic Committee (BOC) president Ivan Slavkov will be replaced in September after being expelled from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following allegations of corruption in a television documentary.

 Moscow: Czech Ondrej Sosenka broke the world cycling hour-record, covering 49.700 km at Moscow?s Olympic velodrome in Krylatskoye on Tuesday.

 Sosenka beat the old mark of 49.441 km, set 

 by Briton Chris Boardman on a traditional bike in 2000. 

 ?I knew I had a good chance to set the record in Moscow 

 because they have a bigger track here than in most other 

 European cities,? said the 29-year-old Czech.?The big track 

 suits me better as it has a longer straightaway.?

 Lara to England: Be aggressive always

 - Ill step aside if I become a liability for West Indies cricket 

 Lara feels the Ashes series will be very exciting 

London: West Indies superstar Brian Lara has told England they must forget about trying to play a containing game if they want to wrest the Ashes back from Australia. 

England have lost their last eight Test series against their oldest foes but are now second behind Ricky Pontings men in the world Test rankings. 

And home hopes of a first Ashes triumph since Mike Gattings side won in Australia in 1986-87 have been stirred by the sides last two limited overs matches. 

In September, England beat Australia by six wickets in the Champions Trophy semi-final and on Monday ? in the teams first meeting this season ? Michael Vaughans men won the Twenty20 clash at the Rose Bowl by a whopping 100 runs. 

Australia know its a more competitive English team that they are facing, Lara, who was in charge of the West Indies side that lost seven Tests home and away against England last year, said at Lords after Tuesdays tsunami tie. 

I think its going to be a good contest, I dont know if it is going to be close but I know England are playing good cricket at present, added Lara, who led the International XI which suffered a 112-run defeat against an MCC XI. 

The pitches in England offer results and may be you are going to get four or five results in the series. Hopefully, its not going to be one-sided? I think it is going to be very exciting, Lara said. 

I think Australia love teams that sit back, be patient and try to win a game from a few mistakes by the Australian team. They (England) have to be aggressive all the time, three sessions a day, 15 sessions a Test match, insisted Lara, who led the West Indies in their 1-3 Test series defeat against Australia in 2002-03. 

The last two successes England have had over the Australians, in the Champions Trophy and on Monday its because of aggressive cricket, attacking cricket, said the gifted left-hander ahead of the triangular one-day series, also featuring Bangladesh. 

They played it better than Australia, they didnt sit back and allow the world champions to dictate. 

Thats what they need to do in the triangular series and in the Test series. It cant just be for one or two sessions, it has to be for the entire day, every day. 

On a personal level, Lara admitted he didnt know if his Wednesday appearance at Lords was his last match at the headquarters of the game. 

I thought the Test match (last year) was. Ive always loved playing at Lords. Every time I go out there I try to make sure that people see the best of me, said Lara. 

Lara said he felt he was playing fairly decent cricket at the moment. If I do become a liability to West Indies cricket Ill definitely step aside, he said. 

New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, MCCs skipper for the tsunami match, talked about his interest in the Ashes series. I think it will be a great series. The billing is one and two in the world, I cant wait to watch it. 

Monday night was a spar, the first of many Im sure, said Fleming, whose side has lost its last five Tests against Australia, including a 0-3 sweep in New Zealand in March. 

Its Englands best chance to win the Ashes for a number of years now and theyve been very focused on it for some time now, insisted the experienced batsman who saw New Zealand beaten 0-3 in last years Test series in England. 

We need to acknowledge that the last two years of their Test cricket has been superb. Theyve got every right to feel confident they can challenge Australia. 

England have got a good bowling attack and good players throughout. To beat Australia you need to have five or six players to have an outstanding series. England have got the calibre of player in that side now to genuinely say they can compete. 

I havent beaten Australia so Im in no position to advise (England captain) Michael Vaughan. 

Weve tended to compete for a period of time. The trick is to compete for the entire series. Thats the challenge, maintaining a higher standard for a longer period of time. 

England and Australia meet for the first time in the tri-series in Bristol on Sunday. The first Ashes Test starts at Lords on July 21. (Agencies)

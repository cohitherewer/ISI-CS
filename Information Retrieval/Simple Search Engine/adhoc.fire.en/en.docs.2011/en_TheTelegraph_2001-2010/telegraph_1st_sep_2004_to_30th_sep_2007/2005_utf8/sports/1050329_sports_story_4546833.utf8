 CM boost for DDCA

New Delhi: In a major relief to the Delhi and District Cricket Association, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit Monday said she was satisfied with the progress of work at the Kotla, which was racing against time to be ready to host the sixth and final one-dayer of the Indo-Pak series. 

?I am satisfied with the fact that things are working according to schedule. Hosting the match is not just a matter of great prestige for Delhi but it?s an honour,? Dikshit told reporters after inspecting the ground for about half-an hour. 

Municipal Corporation of Delhi had recently said that it would not issue any temporary occupancy certificate without which DDCA will not get police and fire safety clearance, a pre-requisite for hosting the match. But the chief minister made it clear that her government would do everything necessary to help DDCA stage the match. (PTI)

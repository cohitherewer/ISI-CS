 Parveen hattrick in JCTs 4-0 victory

New Delhi: A hattrick by Parveen Kumar of JCT Mills was the highlight on the third day of the Durand Cup Football Tournament and resulted in a 4-0 demolition of Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club, Bangalore on Friday. 

The millmen produced a dominant display and became the first team in the competition to secure full three points in the quarter final league phase, as all the previous matches had ended in stalemate. 

Earlier, two late goals salvaged a draw for Army XI against National Football League champions Dempo Sports Club, Goa. 

Parveen scored in the 19th, 30th and 65th minutes while Marcos Pereira found the net in the 58th minute to seal HASCs fate. Rennedy Singh was the playmaker responsible for most of JCTs attacking fervour. (PTI)

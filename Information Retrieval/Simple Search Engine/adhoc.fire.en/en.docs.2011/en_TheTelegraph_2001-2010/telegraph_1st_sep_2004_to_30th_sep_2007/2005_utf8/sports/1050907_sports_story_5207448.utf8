Calcutta: The sister duo of Dolly and Rinki Singh from the School of Physical Culture (SOPC) stole the limelight with their golden performance on the final day of the state boxing championships at Body Guard Lines on Tuesday. 

In the womens (46kg) section, younger Dolly defeated Suman Kumari of Kidderpore School of Physical Culture (KSOPC). 

Dolly was on the top right from the start against Suman and notched up the win comfortably. However, her sister Rinki in the womens (54kg) category, had a tough time against Monu Hela of KSOPC. 

Helas punch in the first round didnt miss much of Rinki. However in the next two rounds, Rinki came back strong to the clinch gold. 

However, their proud father, Raj Kumar Singh ? a sergeant of the Calcutta Police ? had to be satisfied with silver as he lost to Rajib Ghosh of Durgapur Sub-Division Amateur Boxing Association (DSABA), in the mens heavy weight category. 

In the first round, Singh with his strong punches didnt give Ghosh any chance to hit back. But some intelligent play by Ghosh saw Singh being fatigued out soon. Ghosh took the opportunity and hit back strong and Singh retired soon before the end of the final round. 

In the mens lightwelter division, the referee stopped the contest between Mohammed Tarique and Rakesh Chowdhury with the latter flooring the opponent in less than a minute. 

Bishnu Bahadur Chhetri (KSOPC), Ram Sahani and Dolly Singh were adjudged the best boxers in mens, sub-junior and womens categories, respectively.

 AFI panel to meet in 8-10 days

New Delhi: The four-member disciplinary tribunal set up by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) to hear discus thrower Neelam J. Singhs case, following her positive dope test at the World Athletics Championships, will hold its first meeting in eight to ten days. 

The date of the first meeting will be decided by Walter Devaram, AFI vice-president. But most probably we will meet in the next eight to ten days, committee member Olympian Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, who finished fourth in the 1960 Rome Games, said. 

Asked whether the tribunal would be able to bail out the banned athlete, Randhawa said the responsibility to prove her innocence lies with Neelam. 

Our job is simply to find whether she is guilty or not. The onus is on the athlete to prove her innocence, he said. 

After receiving Neelams appeal, the AFI on Wednesday announced the formation of the tribunal headed by Devaram, a former Tamil Nadu director general of police. 

Besides Randhawa, the other members are former sprinter Adille J. Sumariwalla and Dr Girish Tyagi, secretary of the Delhi Medical Association.

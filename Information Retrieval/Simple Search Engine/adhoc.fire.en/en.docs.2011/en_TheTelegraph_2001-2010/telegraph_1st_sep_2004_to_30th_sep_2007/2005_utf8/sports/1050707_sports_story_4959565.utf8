 How Coe turned it around 

 - A testament to a great athletes tactical skills built over the years

 Sebastian Coe is all smiles in Singapore on Wednesday. (AFP) 

It was not a sprint, nor was it a marathon. It was the kind of middle-distance race at which British athletes excel ? and none more so than Sebastian Coe. When Coe won the first of his two Olympic 1,500-metre titles in Moscow back in 1980, he was up against a great favourite in Steve Ovett, a man who had won 42 consecutive races over the distance and had just grabbed the 800-metre gold medal that had seemed destined for Coe. 

But Coe, lambasted in the British press for his tactical failures in the shorter race, kept his nerve and hung on as East Germanys Jurgen Straub made the running. He made his own run 200 metres out, with Ovett matching him stride for stride, and produced his final kick 80 metres out. He covered the final 100 metres in a stunning 12.1 seconds. 

When London overhauled Paris Wednesday in the International Olympic Committee (IOC), it was a testament to the tactical skills built up over the years by the now ennobled Coe ? and his conviction that a race is never over until someone has crossed the line. After a shaky start, Londons finish in the last few days could not be faulted. 

Coe was promoted to take over the London Olympic bid from the American businesswoman Barbara Cassani in May last year at a time when the bid was in a mess. It had just been castigated by IOC inspectors for its transport links and infrastructure as well as for the siting of many of its proposed venues. 

Far from sitting pretty in the pack, London was a distant third ? way behind Paris and Madrid on the IOCs shortlist of five candidates. Victory was indeed a distant prospect. 

Some questioned the wisdom of Coes appointment ? was this just the blazers pulling together? Many people remembered him not as an Olympic champion but as a defeated Tory MP who had gone on to become the chief of staff of a defeated Tory leader. 

But Coe oversaw a major reform of the technical and physical aspects of the bid to produce a blueprint for a more compact and manageable Games that was acceptable to the IOC, even if some reservations remained. 

At the bids headquarters at Canary Wharf, he managed to enthuse the team with a new sense of purpose, to reawaken the feeling that victory was not impossible despite Paris clear lead. 

Internationally, as one of Englands most recognisable Olympians, Coe took over as Londons main salesman, a role that he has carried off with aplomb at successive IOC meetings and major sports events. 

Most crucially of all, he used his political connections to earn a clearer commitment from both the Government and Ken Livingstone, the London Mayor, the sort of backing that the IOC demands. By the time the IOC inspectors came back earlier this year, Londons transport promises appeared less empty. 

Coe described Wednesdays result as the result of a team effort, which it most certainly was. Among those who could claim credit for the London victory was Tony Blair, for his last-minute lobbying in Singapore, the Queen for her offer of a Buckingham Palace tea party ? and of course President Jacques Chirac for his diplomatic gaffe in Russia last weekend. 

At a press conference in Singapore after the signature of the Host City Contract which lays out Londons obligations as an Olympic host city, Coe was asked to compare Wednesdays result to his two Olympic victories in Moscow and Los Angeles four years later. I have to say, I think it is of an entirely different order, he said. 

When he captured his first gold medal, 25 years ago, Coe was asked why he had looked up to the sky as he stood on the podium. Perhaps somebody, somewhere, loves me after all, he replied. Someone still does. The Times, London

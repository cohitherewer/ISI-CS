 Another referee arrested

Berlin: German referee Dominik Marks has been arrested at his apartment in Berlin on suspicion of fraud for fixing three soccer matches in late 2004, prosecutors said on Thursday. 

A spokesman for the Berlin state prosecutors office said the arrest warrant for Marks, 29, was based on ?credible information provided by Robert Hoyzer that was supported by other objective evidence?. 

Hoyzer, 25, is at the centre of the worst match-fixing scandal to hit German soccer in more than 30 years. Hoyzer has admitted fixing matches for money from a gambling gang and is co-operating with prosecutors. 

Hoyzer and Marks worked in the German second and third divisions. Hoyzer, arrested in February, faces eight charges of complicity to defraud. (Reuters)

 Tough to fill in for Sachin: Jadhav

Mumbai: Maharashtra opener Dheeraj Jadhav said on Monday that filling in for Sachin Tendulkar was a huge ask, but he would try to make the best of the opportunity during the two-Test series versus Zimbabwe. 

Sachin Tendulkar will definitely be missed. But it is an opportunity for me and Ill try to do to the best, Jadhav said before departing for Harare. Jadhav was named as replacement for Tendulkar who was in the original Test squad but is still not fully fit. (PTI)

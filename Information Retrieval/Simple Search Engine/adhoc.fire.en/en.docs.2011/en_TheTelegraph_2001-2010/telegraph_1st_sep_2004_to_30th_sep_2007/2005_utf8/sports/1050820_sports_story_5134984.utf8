 Randhawa struggles to 9-over 79

Akron (Ohio): Jyoti Randhawa got a rude awakening on his first day back after a long injury lay-off as he laboured to a nine-over par 79 at the WGC-NEC Invitational on Thursday. 

Randhawa opened with three pars and then double-bogeyed the fourth. It was downhill from there, as he collected seven more bogeys ? three on the front nine and four on back ? for a 79 and is tied 69th among 72 starters. 

One consolation for Randhawa is that there is no cut and everybody in the field makes money. Another is that Retief Goosen is at 68 with a seven-over 77. 

South Koreas Choi Kyung-ju rallied to a one-over-par 71 and was the best among Asian players. He was tied for 23rd. 

Last seasons Asian Tour No. 1 Thongchai Jaidee carded a 73 for a share of the 44th spot. 

Meanwhile, the worlds top two players, Tiger Woods and Vijai Singh, carded four-under 66s to share the first round lead with unheralded Swede Henrik Stenson at the Firestone Country Club. 

 Woods launched his bid for a fourth title here with a flawless opening round. 

Singh returned an almost equally tidy scorecard that included a single bogey but Stenson, playing just his second event in the US, mixed seven birdies with three bogeys to get to his 66. 

A stroke behind, at three-under 67, are Briton Nick Dougherty and Americans Davis Love III and Chris DiMarco. 

Spains Sergio Garcia and Australian Stuart Appleby and Nick Hern sit two shots adrift at two-under 68, while PGA champion Phil Mickelson, Chris Riley and Britains Luke Donald finished at one-under 69. 

Having clinched his second career major on Monday after dangerous weather pushed the final round of the PGA Championship into an extra day, Mickelson only arrived in Akron on Wednesday evening following a whirlwind victory celebration. 

The popular lefthander showed no signs of a hangover, keeping himself in contention, producing a steady round that included three birdies and a pair of bogeys.

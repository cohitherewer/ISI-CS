 Red Orchid may win main event 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Red Orchid and Randsberg are the two horses most likely to battle it out for the 1,600m Dharmaprakasha L.S. Venkaji Rao Memorial Cup, which is the main attraction here on Saturday. Going by their morning workouts, they look the best in the field. However, the V. Deshmukh-trainee Red Orchid, with Mallesh Narredu in the saddle, appears to have a slight edge over Randsberg, and may score.

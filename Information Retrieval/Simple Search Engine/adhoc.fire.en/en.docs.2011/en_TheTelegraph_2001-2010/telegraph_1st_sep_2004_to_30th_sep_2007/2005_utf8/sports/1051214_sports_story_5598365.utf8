 Aristotle displayed amazing improvement 

 STAR RACER

 Fence-sitters jumped on to Aristotles bandwagon last Saturday, the moment bookmakers made the sparingly raced horse a 7-10 favourite for the 2000 Guineas. Arturo, too, had his following at 3-1 despite a nagging doubt among his backers about him lasting the mile trip against the reputed middle-distance horses. More importantly, the past records of Aristotle indicated improvement with each outing. Rising Force, the third heavyweight in the field of eight, was simply untouchable. His paddock looks defied his south India exploits.

 The race-result, too, was on expected lines as Aristotle triumphed unextended, leaving Arturo to fight a fierce battle for the second with last seasons champion galloper, Rasalas.

 Pace in the race was moderately fast as none of the frontrunners ? Acrostic, Imperial Dynasty and Proud Native ? was a reputed sprinter. But all three had a brief stint in front till the halfway mark and managed to cross the half-line in a flat 48 seconds. Anyway, the tiring leaders were caught and humbled nearing the turn once jockey C.Alford changed gear on the Vijay Singh-trained favourite.

 Aristotle skidded clear in a trice with Alford never having to take the stick out to ask for more from the prized property of Deepak Khaitan.

 Big fields mean bigger crowd. It also means heavy collections at the totalisator. Therefore, the Guineas day was the virtual start of the winter racing season. In fact, the once-a-week fixture seems to be suiting fine in view of an increased number of events with large and competitive fields.

 The afternoon was, otherwise, monopolised by trainer Daniel David who got full support from visiting jockey Pradip Chauhan who assisted the trainer score four of his five winners in an eight-event card.

 The trainer-jockey were on a roll from the start when Supreme Princess, in the 2,000m Burdwan Memorial Cup, overhauled Vijays Bounti

 ful Pleasure to suggest Romantic Liaison was going to run a capital race in the Indian Guineas the next day. Romantic Liaison had outclassed the Princess in the 1,000 Guineas. Therefore, the Princess victory seems almost certain in the Ladies Derby, the Oaks, on Christmas-eve.

 Best Of The Blue had to sweat it out real hard to contain the hot favourite, Bright Blossom, in the baby race, the Hong Kong Jockey Club Trophy. The Daniel-Chauhan-combo also showed their fellow professionals that the early juvenile races are all about speed. Not all babies, nursed early in the race, manage to produce their best in the later-half of the contest. 

 Nevertheless, Chauhan had the Blues settled behind the stable-fancy, Dynamic Quest, till 300m from home before shooting off. The Warrshan-colt, though troubled by the late warming-up favourite in the closing stages, hung on determinedly to score.

 Poetic Moment was the third winner for the duo who cashed in on his current form and also an erratic running by the co-favourite, Asterisk, in the 1,600m Kings Academy Handicap. The in-form trainer-jockey team notched up the Antequera Handicap through Russian Valour who was hard-pressed to beat Aag last month. 

 However, Daniels fifth winner was partnered by A.Imran Khan who, despite losing nearly a distance at the start, nursed Secret Valour back into contention for a fluent win in the Cavalry Cup over 1,100 metres.

 Trainer Javed Khans Ardella found the 1,400m Bengal Area Cup an easy pick as Daniels even-money favourite, Imperialist, looked a nervous-wreck in the pre-race parade. Bharath Singhs Gypsy King, on the other hand, decided to shock Daniels heavily fancied Remarquable in the 1,400m Galstaun Cup, though the five-year-old had not been showing form.

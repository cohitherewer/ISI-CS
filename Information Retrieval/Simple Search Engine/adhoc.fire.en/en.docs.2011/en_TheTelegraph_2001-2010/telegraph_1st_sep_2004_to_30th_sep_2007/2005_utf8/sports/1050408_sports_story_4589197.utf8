 London: Former South African President Nelson Mandela threw his support behind London?s 2012 Olympic bid as Britain reaped the reward for backing the 2010 soccer World Cup in South Africa. Mandela?s endorsement is important because Mandela enjoys unrivalled standing and recognition across the world.

 His announcement also reflects the close ties between British and South African sport ? the Football Association were big supporters of the successful 2010 World Cup bid, sending out the England team to help the campaign, and there is also a written Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries about developing sporting links.

 Hanoi: Vietnamese sports authorities want to host the 2014 Asian Games, an official of the Vietnam Olympic Committee (VOC) said Thursday. The committee sent a letter on March 30 to the Kuwait-based Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) indicating interest in hosting the 17th Asian Games.

 A VOC official said that, ?the OCA on April 1 gave Vietnam the okay to go ahead with the bid to figure on the list of candidate nations... The committee has also asked us to send before June 30 the technical details of Vietnam?s ability to stage the Games.? The OCA website lists India, Jordan and the UAE as countries whose national committees have expressed their desire to host the event.

 Bucharest: Octavian Belu and Mariana Bitang have signed a four-year contract to coach the Romanian Olympic women?s team after a former gymnast dropped her claim for damages against them last month. ?The crisis that has hit local gymnastics (due to Belu and Bitang?s resignation) has ended,? Romanian Olympic and Sport Committee (COSR) spokeswoman Maria Baleanu said on Thursday. ?Belu and Bitang signed a four-year contract with the COSR, which could be renegotiated each year taking into consideration the gymnasts? results in major competitions.?

 Belu and Bitang quit in January after 2002 world silver medallist Oana Petrovschi sought more than $50,000 in damages and accused them of demanding some of her prize money and forced her to train despite a back injury. Belu admitted receiving money from his athletes but said it was offered out of gratitude for his help. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Atletico Mineiro and Paysandu named new coaches on Wednesday as Brazil?s so-called ?dance of the coaches? warmed up before the start of the national championship later this month. Tite, who resigned from Corinthians in February, was named as coach of Atletico Mineiro who fired Procopio Cardoso, the man who helped them escape relegation last season, on Monday.

 Paysandu, from the city of Belem on the banks of the Amazon river, appointed Paulo Campos as their fourth coach since the end of last year?s Brazilian championship. Cardoso had been in charge of Mineiro for the final three games of last years Brazilian championship when the Roosters escaped the drop by the skin of their teeth.

 London: Cuban Olympic gold medallist Mario Kindelan has pulled out of this months fight with Amir Khan, the British teenager he beat in the lightweight final in Athens.

 The fight, which had been scheduled for April 30 in Bolton, was expected to be the 18-year-old Khans last fight before turning professional. The 33-year-old Kindelan is fighting in Liverpool on Friday and is also planning to fight in Dublin before returning home, making the Khan fight ?logistically impossible?.

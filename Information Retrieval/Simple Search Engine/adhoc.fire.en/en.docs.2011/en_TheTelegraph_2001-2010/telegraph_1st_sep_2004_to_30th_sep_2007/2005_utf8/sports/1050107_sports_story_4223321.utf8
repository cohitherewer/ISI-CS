 Sasikiran shares lead

New Delhi: Top seed Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran registered his third consecutive win to join International Master R.R. Laxman at the top after the sixth round of the Parsvanath International Open chess tournament here Thursday. 

Sasikiran beat B S. Sivanandan to score full point while Laxman was held to a draw by GM Abhijit Kunte on the top board at the Bapu Samaj Seva Kendra. 

With five rounds remaining, 11 players trail the leaders by half a point in the second spot. Laxman, who had a cent percent win record till the previous round, played it safe and accepted the truce offered by his more fancied opponent after just 10 moves. Kunte, with black pieces, played an irregular queen-pawn opening. 

Sasikiran, who played white, employed the Torre attack and capitalised on Sivanandan?s mistakes to win in 33 moves. 

IMs S. Satyapragyan, Deep Sengupta and Verughese Koshy drew their matches with IM Anton Filippov, GM Dmitry Kayumov and GM Alexander Fominyh, all of Uzbekistan, on the top boards to be joint second with five points. 

Another GM R.B. Ramesh drew with V. Saravanan to be joint third with 4.5 points.

 Dhoni offered DSP post

 Dhoni says he will think about the offer 

Ranchi: Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda has offered wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni a job in the state police department in the rank of deputy superintendent. 

Hosting a dinner for the latest pin-up boy of Indian cricket Tuesday night at his residence, Munda made the offer in the presence of Dhoni?s parents and relatives. 

The cricketer said he would think about the chief minister?s offer. 

However, Dhoni urged Munda to initiate the setting up of standard turf wickets in the state capital to groom budding talents. 

He also requested the government to renovate the Birsa Munda Stadium into an international standard one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Liverpool won with only 4-5 top players

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez had earned a great reputation as a master tactician even before the reshuffling of his pack that led to that extraordinary victory in the Champions League final against all odds. But even in the glow of victory, he showed that he is also a realist by insisting that he needs to completely restructure his side. 

Without wishing to be cruel to a team that has shown such unbreakable character in the Champions League, Liverpool have only four or five top players, with the rest just makeweights. That is what makes their achievement so remarkable but Benitez needs to spend a massive amount on new players if his team is going to compete with Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal in the Premiership. 

The other great managerial beneficiary of that night was England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson. In Gerrard and centre-half Jamie Carragher, who is not even an England regular, he now has two players with immense belief that they can compete with the worlds best. 

The good news does not end there for Eriksson. The Chelsea trio of John Terry, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole will also be flying after securing the Premiership title and once again reaching the Champions League semi-final. 

When English clubs dominated the European Cup in the late Seventies and Eighties, it added to the belief that the England side could go on and win the World Cup. And although there were far more homegrown players in those club sides, Chelsea and Liverpool have a healthy core of England players. 

I have always believed that England can win next years World Cup, especially with so many young players of outstanding quality. Add Wayne Rooney, David Beckham, Michael Owen and Rio Ferdinand to the five from Liverpool and Chelsea, and you can see just what an exciting side Sven can put out. Now that he has negotiated a months rest at the end of the season, there is every hope that we can, for once, go into a major tournament with our best players fit and rested. 

If Liverpool are really to be denied a chance to defend their crown, as now seems likely, it will severely diminish next seasons Champions League. Imagine Tiger Woods winning the Masters and being denied the chance to defend it. That is too ludicrous even to contemplate. 

Whether or not it happens, Liverpools winning team has earned a permanent place in Champions League folklore after a night of madness. 

It was not just the simple fact of Liverpool recovering from a three-goal deficit against a side considered to be the best in the world at holding onto a single goal lead, let alone anything larger. It was that Milan had been so utterly dominating before the first Liverpool goal. 

For almost an hour, Milan were absolutely magnificent, spraying the ball about, making chances and scoring terrific goals. Then in six mad minutes, they lost everything. You have to feel sympathy for them. 

Somehow, though, it seemed that Liverpool were destined to lift the trophy. If they are now not allowed to defend their title, I think the football authorities will have discharged a 12-bore into their own feet.

 PCB drops the Waqar idea

 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has dropped the idea of appointing former captain Waqar Younis as the national team?s bowling coach. The decision was made by the ad-hoc committee that met for nearly four hours at the National Stadium on Thursday. 

?The deal between the PCB and Waqar didn?t go through. We have decided to invite the (fast bowling) stalwarts to the National Cricket Academy for which a proper plan will be chalked out,? PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said later. 

It is believed that the ad hoc committee had agreed on a bowling coach for the India tour but was not willing to extend the contract beyond that. Waqar had demanded a long-term contract. (PTI)

 Neutrals to pick Asian squad

 - ODIs versus Africa 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Unlike in January, when the chief selectors of the four Asian Test-playing nations picked the squad for the tsunami fund-raiser in Melbourne, neutrals will soon select the Asia line-up for the inaugural three-match series against Africa. 

The fund-raising matches have ODI status. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the Big Four ? India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? have each been asked by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) to nominate somebody who isnt a current selector. 

Pakistan, one understands, have put forward Majid Khans name. India could nominate a Ravi Shastri. 

The idea of neutrals, one learns, came from flamboyant ACC chief executive Syed Ashraful Huq. 

As already decided, the matches are going to be hosted by South Africa on behalf of the continent. Next year, it will be Asias turn. 

Its not confirmed, but Durban may host one match despite weather-related apprehensions, with the other two going either to the Wanderers (Johannesburg) or SuperSport Park (Centurion). 

Organised by the recently-formed Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation, the matches are going to be held between August 17-21.

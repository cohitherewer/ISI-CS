 Mani slams Akram

London: Claims by former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram that the ICC has become a forum for white cricketers are ill-informed and offensive, ICC president Ehsan Mani said on Sunday. 

Mani said that he was disappointed by his compatriots comments, which were reported in a website. 

Wasim had said: Mani may be a Pakistani but he has never played cricket and never been associated with Pakistan or India or Bangladesh. 

Mani said: As a Pakistani I am honoured by the privilegegiven to me to lead the ICC. It is a great disappointment to see this former great player make such ill-informed, offensive and inaccurate comments. 

The reality is that what Wasim has alleged is offensive not just to me but to everybody involved with the ICC ?? the directors, the umpires and referees, the staff and the many former great players.(AGENCIES)

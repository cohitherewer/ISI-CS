 No referrals for disputed catches

London: Ricky Ponting and Michael Vaughan have agreed to try and stop referrals of disputed catches to the third umpire during the Ashes series starting at Lords on Thursday. 

Ponting and Vaughan met Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle on Wednesday to discuss the Australian proposal that the two on-field umpires accept a fielders word that he has made fair catch. 

I have just walked out of the Referees meeting 10 minutes ago and had a chat with Michael about that, Ponting said.(We) will ask the fielder if he has caught it and it will be left to the umpire to make the decision. 

Ponting said he wanted to get away from the situation where disputed catches were referred to the third umpire. 

He said the technology involved in television replays was not good enough to enable the extra official to make a definite decision and accordingly batsmen were usually given the benefit of the doubt.

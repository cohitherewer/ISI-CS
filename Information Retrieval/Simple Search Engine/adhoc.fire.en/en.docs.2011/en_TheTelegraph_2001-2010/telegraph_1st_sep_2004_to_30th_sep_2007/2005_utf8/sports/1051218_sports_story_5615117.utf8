 Kumble right up there with Lillee

 - Hes one of the greats? Much under-rated, says Chappell 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad: Anil Kumble is only hours away from achieving another milestone. The fifth Indian cricketer to play 100 Test matches is, however, not taking any chances. 

Let it happen first and then I will give my reaction. For now, I can only say it will be a great moment, was all he would say on Saturday. 

Indias most successful bowler has 478 wickets. Kumble, along with Sachin Tendulkar, will be felicitated by BCCI president Sharad Pawar before the start of the third Test on Sunday. 

The Gujarat Cricket Association is also racing against time to erect a 35-feet long statue of Sachin inside the stadium complex. 

Greg Chappell, though, offered the best compliments when he compared the Indian leg-spinners competitive skills to Dennis Lillee. 

Hes not only one of the greatest that India has produced, but one of the greats? a much under-rated bowler, was how the Indian coach described his efforts. 

Hes a great competitor and has terrific control. He hardly bowled a bad ball right through the match in Delhi. He has very subtle variations and is not a great turner of the ball, which is probably why hes so under-rated. He has both consistency and persistence. When I was playing, Dennis Lillee was a great competitor. Anil is right up there with him. 

Chappell felt that there were many young promising cricketers, but none who could match Kumbles skill and dedication. 

Mahela Jayawardene was also all praise for Kumble. His record speaks for him. He has close to 500 wickets and the consistent performance over so many years tells the story. He is the best Indian bowler right now. 

For Kumble, tomorrow will not just be another day. But it will be business as usual for the Man-of-the-Match in the Kotla Test and architect of several other Indian victories. 

Meanwhile, Zaheer Khan also earned some praise from Chappell in response to a question regarding the Indian squad for Pakistan. 

Zaheer is in good form, well consider him when the time comes, he said.

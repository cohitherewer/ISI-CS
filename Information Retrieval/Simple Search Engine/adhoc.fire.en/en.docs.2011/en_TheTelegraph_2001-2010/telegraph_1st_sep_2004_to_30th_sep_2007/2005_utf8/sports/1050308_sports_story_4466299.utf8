 Milan, Barcelona, Bayern out to break English hearts

 Andriy Shevchenko?s return will boost Milan 

London: A week of misery lies in store for English football if AC Milan, Barcelona and Bayern Munich have their way in this week?s Champions League first knockout round. 

The high hopes of Manchester United, big-spending Chelsea and champions Arsenal were all dented by first-leg defeats a fortnight ago, leaving only Liverpool to take a 3-1 lead to Germany?s Bayer Leverkusen. 

Milan?s defence kept United striker Wayne Rooney and substitute Ruud van Nistelrooy firmly under wraps in a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford, while Barcelona ran out 2-1 winners over 10-man Chelsea at the Nou Camp. 

Arsenal lost 1-3 to Bayern at the Olympic Stadium, their faint hopes left clinging to a late away goal after a poor defensive performance against the Bundesliga leaders. 

Seven quarter final spots hang in the balance on Tuesday and Wednesday, with one seemingly reserved for Olympique Lyon after their 3-0 away win over Werder Bremen. 

Real Madrid?s pursuit of a 10th European crown continues at the Delle Alpi Stadium in Turin, where the Spaniards? 1-0 first-leg lead faces a demanding test from Juventus. 

Last season?s runners-up Monaco are in the same boat as Juventus, trailing 0-1 after their game at PSV Eindhoven and needing to turn the tie around at the Stade Louis II. 

Inter Milan?s second leg against holders Porto will be played on March 15 because the San Siro Stadium they share with Milan is being used by their neighbours on Tuesday. Milan?s defence, superbly led by skipper Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Nesta, was rock solid and their attack could be strengthened by the return from injury of European Footballer of the Year Andriy Shevchenko and Filippo Inzaghi. 

Six years after a famous United semi-final victory at Juventus paved the way to their 1999 Champions League title, Rooney and Van Nistelrooy know what is expected of them.

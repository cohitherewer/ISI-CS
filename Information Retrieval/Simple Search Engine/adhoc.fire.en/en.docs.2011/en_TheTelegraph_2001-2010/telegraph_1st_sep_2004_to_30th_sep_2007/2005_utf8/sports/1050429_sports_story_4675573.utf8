The Telegraph - Calcutta

 O?Sullivan goes down to Ebdon

Sheffield: Holder Ronnie O?Sullivan slumped out of the world championship after a quarter final defeat by Peter Ebdon on Wednesday and promptly declared he could take a year-long break from the game. 

?I?ll probably have a year off,? said the deposed champion, who lost 11-13.?I haven?t made a final decision but it?s 90 per cent positive and maybe it?ll be good for me to have a break. 

?I?ve not fallen out of love with snooker, I absolutely love the game and it has been so good to me. But I?ve got to put myself first and it isn?t making me happy. Physically, I?m feeling pain out there and mentally it?s taking its toll.? 

However, O?Sullivan refused to condemn Ebdon?s time-wasting tactics that have taken him through to a semi-final against Shaun Murphy, while Matthew Stevens faces Ian McCulloch. 

?Peter has got to do what he?s got to do to win the match and you?ve got to give him credit,? said ?Sullivan. 

Ebdon defended his laboured approach to the match after battling back from 2-8 down. 

?I don?t do it intentionally but I?m under a tremendous amount of pressure and I tried for my life out there,? he said. ?I?m just so proud of myself to have won.? 

Stevens became the first player through to the last four when he beat seven-time former champion Stephen Hendry 13-11.

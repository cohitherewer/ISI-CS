 A conditional backing for Sourav 

Bangalore: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly received a conditional vote of confidence from new coach Greg Chappell who said a player of his calibre should be given more opportunities to hit form. 

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Chappell said: Speaking on cricket in general, one has to pick the team first and then the best person to lead the team. 

Asked whether Sourav should continue to be in the team by default, because he is the captain, Chappell said: From time to time, you will have players out of form. But may be a player who has been successful for a long time should get more opportunities than perhaps you would give someone else. 

There are not many players who can succeed at that level. Its not just about talent, its about personality, temperament... Its about learning. They also make mistakes, have a bad day but they learn from mistakes. The best players are those who learn fast. 

So, you dont throw those players out lightly. You give them one game too many, one series too many; one or two too many; not one or two too few. 

Its important that other players do a good job and give adequate cover for players out of form, he said. Asked if Sourav should be continued as the captain, the coach said: If he is the best man for the job, he should have it. 

Chappell does not expect difficulty in handling senior players. He said over the years he has been involved with strong-willed people both as a player, captain and coach. Generally, you work out the best way to deal with each individual. 

Chappell also said India should evolve a series-specific and country-specific strategy. He said the team will define important issues to concentrate and work on. That (the strategy) will change from day-to-day, series-to-series and country-to country, he said. 

Each country has different wickets, different methods to the game to be successful. In some countries, fast bowlers are the best weapon; in some others, spinners are the best, Chappell elaborated. 

What we need to find is probably 15-20 guys who are well-focused on being part of a successful team, he added. 

Chappell indicated that he would try not to replicate the hardball aggressive tactics that the Australian team employs on the field. 

Every country and every culture is different. Every country has different personalities; each individual is a different personality, he said. You cant transplant a format that works in one country to another and expect it to work exactly the same. 

Regarding Sachin Tendulkars injury, Chappell said: It (the injury) might be an opportunity for someone else to come up as the next champion cricketer for India? It might turn out to be a blessing in disguise. 

Chappell hastened to add: Dont twist my words. I am not saying that its a good thing Sachin is injured. All I am saying is Sachin is injured and one can make the most of the opportunity. 

Chappell said he is prepared for the intense public and media scrutiny in India. Its part of the profile. 

We (with trainer John Gloster and physio Gregory King) will be under lot of scrutiny. We have got the job to prepare the team to the best of our ability. At the end of the day its up to the players to perform. All we can do is offer the best support thats possible.

 Sydney: The maxi Trimaran Geronimo, skippered by French sailor Oliver de Kersauson, completed a record circumnavigation of Australia on Saturday after surviving storms and a mini tornado south of Sydney.

 De Kersauson and his 11-person crew returned to the Sydney Opera House in an elapsed time of 17 days, 13 hours, 32 minutes, 39 seconds, about 20 days faster than the 2003 time set by the yacht Kaz and skipper David Pescud. Pescud?s elapsed time was 37 days, 1 hour, 23 minutes for the 12,010 km trip.

 Earlier on Saturday, De Kersauson?s 34 m boat sailed into the path of weather cell that had 70-knot winds along with a mini tornado which picked up the boat and drove it backwards at 20 knots.

 New Delhi: India put up a spirited fight against Kazakhstan before going down 73-76 in the final league game in the middle-Asia Zone qualifiers of the Asian basketball championships here on Sunday.

 Kazakhstan finished unbeaten after four matches to top the zone while India came second with three wins and one defeat. Uzbekistan were the third team to qualify for the Asian meet to be held in Doha, Qatar, in September after beating lowly Bangladesh and Nepal.

 Talwinderjit Singh top scored for the hosts with 21 points. 

 Monterey (California): American Nicky Hayden claimed the first pole position of his career in Saturday?s final qualifying session for the US Grand Prix.

 The 23-year-old Honda rider clocked a time of 1:22.670 at the Laguna Seca track which is hosting the first American Grand Prix for 11 years.

 World champion Valentino Rossi of Italy, a critic of the 2.238-mile road course in the hills east of Monterey, was second quickest on his Yamaha in 1:23.024. Brazil?s Alex Barros, who raced here the last time the US Grand Prix was staged in 1994, was third fastest on his Honda in 1:23.312.

 New Delhi: Railways set themselves on course for their 20th national title, defeating Jharkhand 2-0 in the semi-finals of the 53rd senior women?s hockey championship here on Sunday.

 Railways came up with a lacklustre show before winning the drab encounter at Shivaji Stadium and setting up the summit clash with last year?s runners-up Haryana who trounced Mumbai 7-1 in the other semi-final.

 Sumrai Tete gave the side the lead in the 8th minute converting a penalty corner. Mamta Kharab added to the tally in similar fashion 15 minutes into the second half.

 In the other contest, Haryana set a repeat of last year?s final when they swamped a hapless Mumbai. The winners slammed home four goals in the first half and three more after the break while Mumbai scored once in the 45th minute. 

 Bucharest: Otelul Galati coach Mihai Stoichita quit the Romanian first division side on Saturday, saying the club?s cash shortage prevented him from building a successful team. ?You can?t make performance without money,? Stoichita said.

 Barcelona look to emulate Dream Team of 1990s

Barcelona: The recent history of Barcelona is dominated by the exploits of one side, the Dream Team of the early 1990s who won four consecutive league titles as well as the clubs only European Cup. 

Every Barcelona side since then has had the unenviable task of trying to live up to the expectations created by a team that brought unparalleled success to the Catalan club and delighted fans with their brand of spectacular attacking soccer. 

A Rivaldo-inspired Barcelona briefly threatened to make the same sort of impact in the late 1990s, but the more conservative tactics of coach Louis van Gaal were never greeted with the same enthusiasm as those of his more attack-minded fellow countryman Johan Cruyff. 

However the present team, coached by yet another Dutchman Frank Rijkaard, are playing with a mixture of effectiveness and style that has roused hopes that a new Dream team may finally be in the making. 

It will be difficult to emulate their success because they were the best team in the history of Barcelona, midfielder Xavi said in an interview. 

But weve got players here who are fully prepared to get equal or get close to what that great team did. At the moment we cant make comparisons because weve won just one league title and a Super Cup so we are still well below their level. 

Barcelona won their first trophy in six years with their victory in last seasons Spanish championship and they are already expected to build on their success by bringing more silverware back to the club in the present campaign. 

The mere fact of playing for a Barcelona team like this brings with it a brutal amount of pressure, said the Spanish international. 

You are obliged to keep on winning trophies and to be on top form in every training session ? you have to demonstrate in every game that you are worth your place in the team. 

But a player who cant take the pressure cant play for a club like this. For me it is fantastic to have this type of pressure to win as it makes you feel like a winner. 

Some commentators have expressed doubts about Barcelonas capacity to continue their success given that they have recruited only two players since the end of last season while arch-rivals Real Madrid have brought in five new faces. Portugal midfielder Deco believes the continuity shows that the present squad would be difficult to improve upon. 

I dont think we needed to make a lot of new signings like Real Madrid, he said. (Reuters)

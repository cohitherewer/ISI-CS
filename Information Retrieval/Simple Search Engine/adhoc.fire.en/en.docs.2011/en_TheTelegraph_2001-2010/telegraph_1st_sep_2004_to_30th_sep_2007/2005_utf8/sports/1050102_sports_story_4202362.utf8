 Rogge lauds dope police

Berlin: International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge defended the use of what he called ?Big Brother? methods in the fight to catch doped athletes. 

?We have ?Big Brother? everywhere in the fight against doping,? Rogge told the German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung Friday. ?I don?t have a problem with it, it?s about punishing cheaters. If someone wants to sue for their right to privacy ? then please, go ahead.? 

Rogge said the tactics were necessary because athletes can cover signs of using banned substances during competitions. 

?We can test better now than six months ago, we can find epo. Still only one thing really counts: unannounced training tests,? Rogge said. ?During competitions, the cheaters are clean, beforehand they?re not.? 

Since athletes are required to notify their governing athletic organisations of their whereabouts at all times, Rogge called for a clampdown on those who cannot be found when controllers appear at their door. 

?We have to be stricter in punishing athletes that don?t appear at these tests. They should be disqualified,? he said. ?Those who aren?t available right away have to be within one or two hours. No more exceptions for those that don?t appear three, four or five times.? 

Another key step to catching dopers, Rogge said, is to make governing bodies legally responsible for the whereabouts of their athletes. ?That is the only way,? he said. 

Athletes can now secretly send their own samples to co-operative labs beforehand to make sure they do not test positive during competitions. Most success stories against cheaters, Rogge said, came when they were surprised by unannounced tests.

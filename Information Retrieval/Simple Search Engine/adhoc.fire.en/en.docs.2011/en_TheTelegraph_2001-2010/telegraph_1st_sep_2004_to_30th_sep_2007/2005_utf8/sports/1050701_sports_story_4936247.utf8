The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Woodbridge quits, Damm Bhupathis new partner

London: Todd Woodbridge dealt Australias Davis Cup planning and Indias Mahesh Bhupathi major blows when he announced he was retiring after Wimbledon. 

The 34-year-old said he took his decision after failing to win a 10th mens doubles title at Wimbledon. Woodbridge and his partner Bhupathi lost in the third round. 

[A Staff Reporter adds in Calcutta: Martin Damm of the Czech Republic will partner Bhupathi for the rest of the year. 

The Indian seemed to have taken the news in his stride. Todd told me about his retirement only after we lost the third round match at Wimbledon, Bhupathi told The Telegraph from London. 

Theres no question of getting upset? This is how he wants to end his career? So he is going his way and I have to go my way now.] 

Woddbridges decision to retire means that Australia, who face Argentina in their Davis Cup quarter-final clash in Sydney from July 15-17, will have to find a new combination with the likelihood of Lleyton Hewitt teaming up with Wayne Arthurs. 

I have had a good run and I have decided to call it a day, said Woodbridge. I planned to play this year but my partnership with Mahesh hasnt worked out quite as I planned. 

I wanted to win a 10th doubles title but that wasnt possible. 

Woodbridge has won 83 doubles titles including 16 at Grand Slams.

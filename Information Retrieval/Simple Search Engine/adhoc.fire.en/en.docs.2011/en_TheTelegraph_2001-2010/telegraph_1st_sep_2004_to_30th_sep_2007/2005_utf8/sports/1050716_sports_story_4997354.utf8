St Andrews: Jack Nicklaus made an emotional exit after the most illustrious career in golf at the British Open on Friday, a day when Tiger Woods took a giant step towards clinching his 10th major. 

The 65-year-old, who holds a record 18 major titles, was intent on avoiding the halfway cut but despite perfect conditions on the Old Course, a round of level 72 left him three short of the likely mark of level par (144). 

Nicklaus, a competitor to the end, was given a deafening reception as he strode the 18th hole for the final time, stopping at the Swilcan Bridge to wave to galleries packed deep either side of the fairways. He has won two of his three British Open titles here. 

Nicklaus said beforehand the event would be his final major and he rubbed his eyes repeatedly as he approached the green, apparently close to tears. 

His playing partner Tom Watson, a long-time arch-rival, was in tears as the pair embraced while a host of golfing greats gathered at greenside to offer their congratulations. 

Meanwhile, Woods tightened his stranglehold on the tournament with a flawless display of links golf. 

The 2000 champion here ran in three birdie putts to build on his overnight 66 on his outward nine and then launched the shot of the day, a towering drive to reach the 380-yard 10th green with one blow from the tee. 

It gave him the luxury of two putts for birdie and he collected another at the long 14th to move to 11 under, a lead of four over his nearest rival on the course, playing partner Australian Robert Allenby. 

Earlier, Briton Tony Jacklin, another of the Opens most popular figures from decades past and the winner in 1969, bade farewell on his final appearance with a round of 76 to finish 11 over. 

Holder Todd Hamilton also missed the cut, as 2003 champion Ben Curtis did last year, on his defence. The American finished four over par after double-bogeying the 13th. 

World No. 2 Vijai Singh and third-ranked Ernie Els had early starting times and made the most of bright, almost windless conditions to collect a string of second-round birdies. 

Singh, who shot 69 on Thursday, struggled with his putter but still picked up three birdies to equal his opening score for six under overall. 

That matched South African Trevor Immelman, who fired a 70 to set the early second-round pace on 138, and US Ryder Cup man Brad Faxon. The American posted a best-of-day 66, having gone through final qualifying earlier in the week to book his place. 

Elss sombre mood from Thursday brightened after he picked up five shots with a second-round 67 to follow his opening 74, leaving him three below par for the tournament. 

Phil Mickelson also repaired the damage of an indifferent first round of 74 and a return of 67 also took him to three under. 

Sergio Garcia of Spain was in the hunt too, a couple of shots clear of Mickelson after a 69. He drove the 357-yard last hole but narrowly missed a 20-foot eagle putt. 

Briton Nick Faldo, playing in his 30th British Open, belied his veteran status on Friday as the six-time major winner made the cut with ease. 

After a flawless three under par 69 that took him one-under at halfway, Faldo was delighted to improve on last years performance at Royal troon where he missed the cut. 

Meanwhile, David Toms was disqualified after owning up to a rules infringement. The 38-year-old signed for a two-over 74 in the first round but later told officials he believed he had hit a moving ball when he played the notorious 17th Road Hole. 

That would carry an automatic two-shot penalty, said a Royal and Ancient spokesman. So he was disqualified for signing for an incorrect score. I dont think anybody else noticed ? he called it on himself.

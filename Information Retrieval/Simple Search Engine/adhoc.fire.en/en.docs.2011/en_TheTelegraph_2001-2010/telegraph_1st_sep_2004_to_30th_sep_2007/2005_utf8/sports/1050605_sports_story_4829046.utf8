 Vieira denial

London: Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira has denied sending a text message to teammate Ashley Cole telling him not to accept less than ?80,000 ($145,400) a week from the club. 

The Premier Leagues decision document on the Cole tapping-up case involving Chelsea said the England defenders agent Jonathan Barnett had shown Arsenal chief executive David Dein a text message from Vieira during contract talks. (Reuters)

 Anand is champion yet again

Mainz: Viswanathan Anand scored a 5-3 victory over Russian Alexander Grischuk after two decisive games on the final day to stamp his authority for the fifth time on the trot in the Mainz Chess Classic here. 

The Indian ace, who needed just half a point from the last two games, won the seventh game of the eight-game contest in Grenke Leasing Championship, the main event of the tournament, while Grischuk managed to win the last game but that only helped him reduce the losing margin. 

Mainz, thus, continued to remain Anands favourite hunting ground. I expected a close match and on the chessboard it was clear that it was a really close match. But the score tells a different story. 

I wanted to reach the 4-5 points as soon as possible and that resulted in this disaster in the sixth game. You should never sit on your lead. It was an interesting match, with a lot of good games. I even enjoyed the last game that I lost. It was a beautiful game? I was in a winning position, but somehow lost it, Anand said. 

Playing with white pieces in the first game of the day, Anand was yet again up against the Sicilian Nazdorf and employed the English attack once more to force matters. 

In the middle game, Grischuk did not handle his pieces well and Anand got a subtle edge that he nurtured well enough to get the decisive attack. Grischuks king was almost dancing to the tune of Anands pieces in the end and the Russian finally called it a day after 47 moves. 

The final game of the contest on Monday, too, would have been a similar story had Anand not fumbled from what appeared to be a surefire winning position. 

It all started with the Caro Kann Defence wherein Anand as black got the dynamic balance ticking in his favour first and later made his attack nearly fatal for Grischuk. However, the Russian was lucky enough to survive more than a few anxious moments and finally won in 47 moves. 

It was a miraculous victory for me in the end, admitted Grischuk, who also played in the Ordix Open simultaneously with his match against Anand and ended as joint second. 

Meanwhile, Teimour Rajdabov of Azerbaijan was the worthy winner of the Ordix Open scoring 9.5 points out of a possible 11. 

Once the youngest Grandmaster in the world Rajdabov drew his final game against Russian Alexey Dreev to win the event solely. 

World junior champion and Grandmaster P. Harikrishna also came good in this strong section finishing joint second on 9 points along with Dreev, Levon Aronian of Armenia, Alexander Morozevich of Russia, and Gabriel Sargissian, also of Armenia. (PTI)

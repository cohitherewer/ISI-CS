The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Nazir recalled

Karachi: Pakistan selectors left out Shoaib Akhtar and made three changes to the squad currently in India, but had to give in to the team management?s demand to sacrifice an opener for a spinner when they announced the 16-member squad for the six-match one-day series against India beginning on April 2. 

The selectors decided to leave out Shoaib on fitness ground and omitted openers Yasir Hameed and Taufeeq Umar along with left arm paceman Mohammed Khalil, currently touring India for the Test series. 

Off-spinner Mohammed Hafeez and medium pacers Shahid Nazir and Rao Iftikhar Anjum would join the squad in their place. 

Nazir was recalled in the squad after nearly five years in wilderness. He last played against Sri Lanka and has taken 19 wickets in 17 appearances. He will join Inzamam-ul Haq amp; Co. from Colombo where he is with the Pakistan A squad taking part in a triangular series. 

Wasim Bari, chairman of selectors, said: ?Shoaib Akhtar was not considered (for selection) because he is not fit. His trainer Grant Compton told me that he requires two weeks to regain fitness. Once he conveys us his availability, we will take his fitness test and then decide about his selection.? 

Pakistan retained Danish Kaneria in the one-day squad and sacrificed an opener.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pal kept off media

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Subrata Pal returned to competitive football two days after the AIFF lifted his suspension. And the Mohun Bagan goalkeeper?s show under the bar against Salgaocar at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday was ample proof that he had recovered from the trauma of Cristiano Junior de Lima?s tragic death. 

He still went for the ball in the air, was shouting at his comrades to buck up and even saved his team from the blushes by denying a Jyothi Kumar effort. 

Coach Subrata Bhattacharya, however, didn?t allow him to talk to the press after the match.

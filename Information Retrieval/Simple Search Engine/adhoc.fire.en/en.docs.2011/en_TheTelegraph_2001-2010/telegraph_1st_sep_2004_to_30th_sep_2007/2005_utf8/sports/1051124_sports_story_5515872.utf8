 New Zealand recall Cairns

Wellington: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming may miss the opening ODI against Australia early next month but the selection of veteran allrounder Chris Cairns will restore some experience to the side. 

New Zealand selectors on Wednesday included Fleming in the 14-man squad for the three match Chappell-Hadlee Series but said Fleming could miss the first match on December 3 because of an undisclosed personal medical matter. 

Coach John Bracewell was also unable to confirm whether the captain would be available for the remaining two matches on December 7 (Wellington) and 10 (Christchurch). Its a medical issue, Bracewell said. 

THE SQUAD 

Stephen Fleming (captain), Daniel Vettori (vice captain), Nathan Astle, Shane Bond, Chris Cairns, James Franklin, Hamish Marshall, James Marshall, Brendon McCullum, Craig McMillan, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Scott Styris, Lou Vincent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bulas book released

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Accolades never really dried up for Bula Chowdhury. Following her superbly successful international sprint career, she splashed into ocean swimming where she crossed nine rather perilous stretches around the world, covering the seven seas. 

In the city on Wednesday Bula released her book, Saat Samudre Santar (Swimming the seven seas), a sort of autobiographical work that stresses on her long distance swimming feats. 

At the Bangla Academy, in the presence of theatre personality Soumitra Chatterjee, novelist Samaresh Majumdar and Arjuna Awardee footballer and Sheriff of Calcutta, Chuni Goswami, the neat book was released. 

Like many of my dreams, this was also one of my dreams. No Indian swimmer has ever written a book on his or her or on any swimmers exploits. I am proud to have achieved this first as well, Bula told The Telegraph. I hope this endeavour of mine does attract other swimmers of the country to do the same. 

The book involves, in the main, her sea swimming achievements, her successes and her heartbreaks. It also captures, though in brief, her international achievements when she was the countrys best sprinter.

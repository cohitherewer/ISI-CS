 Afleet Alex claims Belmont Stakes 

Elmont: Afleet Alex stormed to an easy victory in the $1 million Belmont Stakes, the last leg of the Triple Crown, with a late surge on Saturday to confirm his status as US racings top three-year-old.

 Afleet Alex, who won the Pre-akness Stakes three weeks ago despite a near-disastrous collision down the stretch, won by seven lengths after biding his time in the 1-1/2 mile test.

 He threaded his way through the pack around the last turn and exploded down the stretch to win comfortably. Andromedas Hero finished second, followed by Nolans Cat another 6-3/4 lengths back.

 As a hot-favourite, Afleet Alex had placed third in the Kentucky Derby. (REUTERS)

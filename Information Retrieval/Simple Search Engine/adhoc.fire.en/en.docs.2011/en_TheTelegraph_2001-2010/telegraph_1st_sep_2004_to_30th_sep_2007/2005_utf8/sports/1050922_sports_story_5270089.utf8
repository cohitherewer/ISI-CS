 Ian Thorpe back from sabbatical

Sydney: Ian Thorpe has returned from his years sabbatical with a real spring in his step as he sets out on the long road to China. 

The Australian took an extended break from the relentless grind of training after last years Athens Olympics to re-charge his batteries. 

He travelled extensively through the United States and Europe, learning to ski in Switzerland, and indulged his new passion for business and fashion. 

Swimming was the last thing on his mind but it was not long until the fierce competitor inside him began to stir and, after watching the Montreal World Championships at home on television, the competitive juices were back in full flow. 

Having that time away has just re-ignited the passion and the fire, he told a news conference in Sydney on Wednesday. There was a time when I didnt always have that but now its back. 

Thorpe recommenced training in July, rising before dawn each day to churn through the laps with renewed vigour. He has already shed his unwanted fat and is looking fitter than ever. 

Im getting a kick out of training at the moment, like you do out of racing, he said. You go through a phase when you get these glimpses of what you used to be able to do. 

Now Im at the phase of being able to do things that I was doing, and doing it consistently. Thats encouraging and Im getting a buzz out of that. 

I was going through some very hard sets and struggling during winter. Ive kind of come out of the dark end of that. Its character-building and Im really pleased Im over it. 

Thorpes long-term goal is, of course, Beijing 2008, where he will be bidding for his place in sporting immortality as the first male swimmer to win individual gold medals at three Olympics. 

He won the 400 metres freestyle at the Sydney 2000 Games when he was just 17, then the 200-400 freestyle double in the Greek capital last year. He also has two relay golds from Sydney for a grand total of five and the prospect of more to come. 

Thorpes immediate aim is next years Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, which are looming as a watershed in his career. 

Thorpe has primarily been regarded as a middle-distance swimmer but is flirting with the idea of concentrating on the sprints after his encouraging third in the 100m at Athens. (Reuters)

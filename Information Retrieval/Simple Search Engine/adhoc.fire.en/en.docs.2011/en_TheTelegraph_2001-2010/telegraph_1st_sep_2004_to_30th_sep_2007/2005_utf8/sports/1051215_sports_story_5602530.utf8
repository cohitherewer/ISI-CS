A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Tejbir Singh Bhandari has been conferred the Indian Coach of the Year award by the USPTR. 

The experienced Calcutta-based coach, who is director (technical) of BTA and director of ITA as well, got the USPTR degree in 1995 and later was elevated to the role of a national tester whereby he would judge and grade other coaches. In 1998, the USPTR adjudged him the Indian Tester of the Year. 

Bhandari was non-playing captain of the Indian junior girls team which participated in the World Youth Cup in Melbourne earlier this year.

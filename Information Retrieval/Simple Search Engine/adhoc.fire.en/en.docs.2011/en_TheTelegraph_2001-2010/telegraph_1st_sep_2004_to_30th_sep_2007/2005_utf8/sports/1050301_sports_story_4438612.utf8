 Raleigh: Little-known Angela Daigle used an explosive start to equal the fastest women?s 60 metres in the world this year at the US indoor championships in Boston, Massachusetts on Sunday.

 The 28-year-old Daigle, eighth in the US Olympic trials 100m last year, clocked 7.09 seconds to tie Jamaican Olympic 200m champion Veronica Campbell for the year?s fastest time.

 The performance improved Daigle?s personal best in the event by 0.12 seconds. US Olympian Muna Lee was second in 7.11 seconds.

 Daigle received $25,000 for her overall championship on the four-meeting US indoor circuit and $2,500 for the US title. 

 Lisbon: Jose Mourinho is hoping for a referee he regards as impeccable for Chelsea?s Champions League home leg against Barcelona on March 8 following his criticism of Anders Frisk at the Nou Camp.

 ?There is something that tells me that, in London the referee will be (Pierluigi) Collina, the best in the world,? Chelsea?s coach said in a Portuguese sports newspaper.

 A spokesman for Uefa said, however, that the European body had not yet designated the officials for the second legs of the Champions League first knockout round ties.

 Chelsea have said they are filing a report to Uefa about a halftime incident in Barcelona. 

 Berlin: Bundesliga side Hansa Rostock have suspended midfielder Rene Rydlewicz after he failed to explain why he had stayed out until 6 am before two league matches in May last year.

 The club, who are bottom of the Bundesliga and are still winless at home, said that Rydlewicz had been suspended until further notice.

 Rydlewicz, 31, returned to the team hotel at around 6 am before the 1-4 loss at Dortmund on May 1 and before the 0-4 drubbing at relegated Cologne on May 15, the club said.

 Madrid: Rafael Nadal is concerned about Spain?s prospects in their opening Davis Cup tie in Slovakia despite enjoying early-season form himself. 

 ?Personally I?ve started the year much better than I expected,? said the 18-year-old after notching up back-to-back ATP titles in Brazil and Acapulco. 

 But Nadal, who played a key role in Spain?s victory over the US in last year?s Davis Cup final, said that the team would have to be on top form if they were to avoid a first-round loss to Slovakia this weekend.

 ?I?m worried because it?s going to be a very difficult tie and we will have to be at 100 percent over the three days if we want to get through,? he said. ?Slovakia are the favourites because they are playing at home on their own courts and the record books show that winning away from home is pretty difficult.?

 The Mallorca-born player will be joined by the experienced Albert Costa and youngsters Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez. 

 Athens: Greek sports authorities have postponed by two weeks the judgement on the country?s top two sprinters for missing dope tests, including one on the eve of Athens Olympics, their lawyer said on Monday. Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanouw ere expected to learn their fate by the end of February but late evidence from them has pushed the date back.

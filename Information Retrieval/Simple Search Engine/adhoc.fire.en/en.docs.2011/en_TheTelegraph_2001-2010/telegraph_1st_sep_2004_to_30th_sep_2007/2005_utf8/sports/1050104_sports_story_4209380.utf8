The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kudos to hero from Sourav 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Laxmi Ratan Shukla exults after Bengal secured first innings lead at the Eden on Monday 

Calcutta: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly indicated Monday that the 81-run innings played by Bengal allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla could be a fresh start for the youngster?s career. This is especially so because of the dearth of genuine allrounders today. 

?He will have to get fit and start bowling well soon,? Sourav said after the match at the Eden. Shukla?s ?maturing over time? has pleased the Indian captain. Probably as an incentive, it was learnt from sources, Sourav has decided to give his match fee to Laxmi. 

Sourav doesn?t feel Bengal?s performance has dipped much from the time when he made his debut in the Ranji Trophy 15 years back. ?They obviously had three or four bad matches, but that doesn?t say that the performance has dipped. And for myself, whenever there is scope, I make it a point to play for the state,? Sourav remarked. 

He also praised tailender-mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose for his 61-ball stay out in the middle and helping Shukla to achieve the target of 393. ?He has given good company to Laxmi and so he also deserves the credit.? 

Meanwhile, the hero of the day, Shukla rated this innings as the best in his career. ?This innings came at the right time, when Bengal needed it, so no other innings can be equated with this,? he said. 

Shukla even wants to resume his bowling soon as soon as he gets fully fit. ?Probably I will be fit before the one-dayers and in that case I roll my arms there,? he stated. Shukla revealed that this match was a different one for all players. After the inclusion of Sourav, Devang and Utpal, they all were charged up to prove a point. 

Last but not the least, it will be okay with Shukla if he gets a promotion in the batting order for performing consistently.

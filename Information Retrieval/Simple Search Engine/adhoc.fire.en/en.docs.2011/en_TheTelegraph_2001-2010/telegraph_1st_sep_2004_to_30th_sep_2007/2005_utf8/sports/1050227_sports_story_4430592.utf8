 Wenger?s dig at English football 

London: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger hit out at the ?superiority complex? of English football and claimed that no teams have a divine right to win in Europe. 

The Frenchman, whose side lost their knockout round first-leg clash 1-3 to Bayern Munich on Tuesday, said on Friday it was a ?miracle? that Arsenal manage to consistently qualify for the Champions League. 

From the four Premiership sides in action in the first leg of their second-round matches earlier this week, only Liverpool were able to record a victory and that 3-1 win came at Anfield. 

Despite the world-class talent on display in the English top flight, no English side has made the Champions League final since Manchester United six years ago. 

?I don?t know where this English superiority complex comes from, that in the European Cup we have just to turn up and win,? said Wenger.

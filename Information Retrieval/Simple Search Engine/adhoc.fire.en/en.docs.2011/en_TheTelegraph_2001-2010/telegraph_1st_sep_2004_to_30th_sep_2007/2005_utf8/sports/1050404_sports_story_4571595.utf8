 Churchill, Vasco draw

Margao: An injury-time goal by Sidney Rodrigues helped Vasco hold Churchill Brothers to a 1-1 draw in a National Football League match played at Nehru Stadium on Sunday. 

Churchill surged ahead in the 27th minute when Yakubu tapped in a flag kick by Roque Baretto. 

After coming close to equalising on three occasions, Vasco restored parity in the injury time when Sidney Rodrigues banged home from close a pass from substitute Denis Cabral. 

The draw took Churchill to 14 points from 15 matches while Vasco, who are below Churchill Brothers in 11th place, took their tally to 13 points from the same number of matches. 

Mahindra hold JCT 

Meanwhile in Ludhiana, Mahindra United held JCT Mills to a 1-1 draw at the Guru Nanak Stadium. 

It was a solo effort by JCT?s Harvinder Singh who put his team ahead in the 73rd minute. 

Mahindra went on an all-out attack to find the equaliser. They also made three substitutions in quick succession, which ultimately proved fruitful as Abhishek Yadav?s header found the net off a corner kick in the dying minutes.

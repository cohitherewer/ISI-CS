The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wait and find out... 

 - Greg Chappell doesnt reveal his cards on handling Team India 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 I don rsquo;t think it rsquo;s going to help if, over the next two years, I keep reacting to everything talked about and written in India. If I do, I may not have time for my job - 

 GREG CHAPPELL

Calcutta: The past week has seen high-voltage developments in Indian cricket. Arguably, the talking point still remains Sunil Gavaskars comments about our first coach from overseas ? John Wright. 

His latest column, after all, included: One of the things that may have made up Wrights mind to not renew his contract could have been the way some players treated him in the last year. 

He was told off and sworn at by some players and one thing is for sure that however inefficient an Indian coach may be, there is little chance that he may be abused by any of the players, however big the current players may be. 

Significantly, misbehaviour by a couple of seniors was, in fact, reported by The Telegraph as far back as November 20. 

Wright, who coached Team India for four-and-half years, has become incommunicado (apparently, hes relaxing at his property outside Christchurch). However, questions on how successor Greg Chappell will tackle the players ? particularly the temperamental ones ? are doing the rounds. 

The Adelaide-based Chappell declined to speak about the columns contents, but did make a few points. 

Ive just got the coachs job and, as I said in New Delhi, wish to start with an open mind and heart. What happened under Wright is history and I dont intend responding to that, Chappell maintained, when contacted on Thursday. 

He added: In any case, I dont think its going to help if, over the next two years, I keep reacting to everything talked about and written in India. If I do, I may not have time for my job. 

Asked whether, nevertheless, he was perturbed by what Gavaskar wrote, Chappell replied: No? And, if people are wondering how Ill handle the players, my response is straightforward: Wait and find out? Hopefully, the questions are now going to stop. 

Perhaps.

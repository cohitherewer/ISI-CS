 Dravid stars in World XI victory

 Dravid, who top-scored with 66 for World XI 

Melbourne: Indias Rahul Dravid top-scored with 66 and captain Shaun Pollock of South Africa was 54 not out as the World XI scored 281 for eight on Sunday to beat a Victorian state side by 12 runs. 

A crowd of about 10,000 crammed into the Junction Oval to watch the practice game, the world squads only match ahead of the three-game one-day International Super Series against Australia that begins on Wednesday in Melbourne. 

Paceman Shane Harwood was the best Victorian bowler with four for 37, including the wickets of Brian Lara, for nine, and Englands Kevin Pietersen, for five, both off catches. 

Harwood could have had a five-wicket haul, but Bushrangers captain Cameron White dropped Dravid off his bowling when the India vice-captain was on 61. 

White, who claimed two for 49, caught Dravid off the bowling of Mick Lewis. 

Brad Hodge top-scored with 92 for Victoria, which made 269 for nine from its 50 overs. 

Paceman Shoaib Akhtar took two for 29 from 10 overs, while Muttiah Muralidharan and Jacques Kallis also took two each. 

England allrounder Andrew Flintoff, who arrived in Melbourne only on Friday, was rested by the World XI.

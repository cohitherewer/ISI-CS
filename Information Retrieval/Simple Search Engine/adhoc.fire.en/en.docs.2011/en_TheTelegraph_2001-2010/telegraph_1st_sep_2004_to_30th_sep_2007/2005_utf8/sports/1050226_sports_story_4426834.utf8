 Waqar slams PCB

 Waqar still ready to serve the country in future 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis Friday slammed the country?s cricket authorities, saying they did not even have the courtesy to inform him about their decision not to appoint a bowling coach. 

?I am disappointed that we could not strike a deal. I wanted to serve the country and I will certainly work in future if provided with an opportunity,? said Waqar, who has 414 one-day and 373 Test wickets to his credit. 

?But what has hurt me most is the attitude of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). I never initiated the move of a bowling coach. It was the PCB that started it all and when they decided they didn?t want me, they did not have the courtesy to inform me about their decision,? the former captain remarked. ?I came to know of the decision when newsmen called to take my reaction. I am extremely disappointed,? he informed. 

PCB Thursday decided against appointing a bowling coach on a long-term basis, thus shooting down the proposal floated by captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer. 

Meanwhile, Inzamam Friday defended former fast bowler Waqar Younis? demand for a long-term contract and said ?he is not a magician who can correct things in a week.? 

The skipper said he was expecting Waqar to teach youngsters the art of reverse swing to trouble the famed Indian batting line-up in the absence of Shoaib Akhtar. 

Former Pakistan coach Javed Miandad too has come out in support for Waqar. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan manager for the tour of India, Saleem Altaf, has said nobody should discount his team before the start of the series. ?Pakistan have shown good performance on the second half of the Australian tour which would have definitely given them plenty of confidence for the Indian trip,? Altaf said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Paes-Zimonjic surprised

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: The tennis-loving fans of this southern metropolis will have to do with just one dream final. The unfancied duo of Rainer Schuettler and Yen-Hsun Lu spoilt the perfect Sunday script by knocking out second seeds Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in the second doubles semi-final of the Chennai Open Saturday night. 

The scratch German-Chinese Taipei combination, playing together for the first time, will meet top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Jonas Bjorkman. 

It was kind of a grudge match for Paes. He and Mahesh Bhupathi had been unexpectedly beaten in the Athens Olympics semi-final by Germans Schuettler and Nicolas Kiefer. Well, the Indian ace came out second-best yet again, for no fault of his. 

His Serbian partner had a tough day on court. Neither his famed serve nor his returns worked. Schuettler and Lu kept targeting Zimonjic right through and got rich dividends. 

Lu and Schuettler clinched the first set breaking Zimonjic. Some inspired tennis from Paes gave them the second set. In the decider, Zimonjic again got broken early. Two double-faults from Schuettler gave the Indo-Serbian pair a fresh lease of life. 

Came crunch time in game 10 and Zimonjic, serving to stay in the match, crumbled under pressure yet again to give Lu and Schuettler passage to the title-round.

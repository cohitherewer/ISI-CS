LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ian Chappell

Calcutta: Brother Greg has regularly been making headlines in these parts, but Ian Chappells fan following hasnt diminished one bit. The iconic Ian spoke to The Telegraph for over an hour during the Super Test in Sydney. 

The following are excerpts 

 On himself 

 (Grins) Must you start with this? 

 Im a simple person... A front bar drinker from the 

 bay, because I was brought up just off the sea... The front 

 bar in a hotel is the least salubrious part... Thats 

 where the workers, so to say, drink as opposed to a saloon 

 bar (mixed clientele) and the lounge where you need to be 

 in a suit... When people referred to me as the Australian 

 captain and so on, I introduced myself differently. 

 On whether he had a pampered upbringing 

 No... No... My father (Martin) never hit 

 me, but mother Jeanne did ? because I couldnt tie 

 the shoelaces properly or something like that... My fathers 

 way of punishing me was to say right, Im not 

 going to take you to the cricket match or I 

 wont take you for the baseball game and I would 

 plead hit me, for Gods sake, but do take me 

 with you... Father was a good club-level cricketer 

 and when he got older, would lead the Glenelg Grade III 

 team packed with youngsters... I would go along with him 

 to the Adelaide Oval as a scorer, not because I liked scoring, 

 but in the hope that one of the young guys wouldnt 

 turn up and I would get to play! And, thats the way 

 I got to play as a nine-year-old... I didnt score 

 many, but held out for around 45 minutes at No. 9. I expected 

 to be patted by father, but he said Id backed away 

 once when somebody really fast was bowling and, so, I wouldnt 

 get another outing. I didnt think I had, but it left 

 me devastated... Thats how I was brought up... It 

 was meant to toughen me ? and my brothers (Greg and Trevor). 

 The growing-up days were immensely enjoyable. If you ask 

 Greg, even he will say he had a great time. By the way, 

 we didnt have homework till secondary school and, 

 till that stage, one could play the sport of ones 

 choice once school got over in the afternoons. 

 On his fathers influence 

 Huge... Inculcated the love for cricket 

 and guided me on how to play it: Hard, but fair. If Id 

 appealed for a catch on the bounce, in his presence, he 

 would have taken me off by the collar... 

 On the values he (and his brothers) grew up 

 with 

 Being truthful... Trying to be a decent 

 human being... Ive disappointed myself as Ive 

 got older, though... 

 On how he began playing 

 By throwing the ball against the wall and 

 giving it a whack. While doing so, I would also give my 

 brand of commentary. 

 On the rivalry between the brothers 

 Greg was five years 

 younger and Trevor another five... (Adds laughing) 

 When Greg first came into the South Australian side, we 

 had some mix-ups and people would say theyre 

 brothers, but dont have an understanding... 

 What they didnt realise is that we never played together 

 ? in our backyard, we were opponents. I was Australia and 

 it fell on Greg to be England! Later, Greg became Australia 

 and Trevor had to be poor England... Because of the imaginary 

 Ashes Tests, I never looked upon Greg as a brother... Where 

 I was concerned, he was an opponent... I suppose the first 

 time I thought of him as a brother was when I was the captain-coach 

 of a baseball team... Others felt Id picked the 16-year-old 

 because he was my brother, but that wasnt so... Greg 

 did very well in the first game itself. It confirmed I picked 

 guys who could play, who could be winners. Whatever the 

 sport, I played to win and my team would be packed with 

 guys who, too, wanted to win... To get back to brotherly 

 feelings, it really surfaced during one of the games when 

 an opponent hurt Greg... I remember throwing down my gloves 

 and going for him... Somebody intervened... That night, 

 I sat down at home and said to myself I really do 

 look upon him as my brother... The first time we batted 

 together was for South Australia, but it wasnt a long 

 partnership... Of course, we were different as batsmen ? 

 being tall, Greg favoured drives, whereas I was more of 

 a puller and cutter. The bowlers, therefore, had to change 

 their length all the time if we happened to be together. 

 Its fair to say we complemented each other. 

 On the one quality of Greg which stood out 

 His determination... Once his mind was 

 made up on something, he would go through with it... That 

 was evident in the battles we had in our backyard... I twisted 

 his arm once to get him to concede hed got out, but 

 he didnt yield... I realised if I continued twisting, 

 that arm would break... In any case, I think mother came 

 out of the house... 

 On how he rated Greg as a batsman 

 Highly... From the time he got a fifty-odd 

 in the final of a club tournament... Indeed, when he got 

 a Test hundred on debut, it was a wake-up call for me... 

 I was the captain, but if I didnt get runs myself, 

 there could be a situation where Greg would become a regular 

 and I would have to sit out... My record as a batsman improved 

 after he came into the Australian XI. 

 On the rivalry once Greg left South Australia 

 for Queensland 

 We had a major showdown during a match 

 when Greg hit the No. 11 with a bouncer... I told him listen 

 you p****, if you want to bowl a bouncer bowl it at me, 

 not the No. 11... To which Greg, who was fired up, 

 retorted shut up and get on with your batting... 

 So, there was that needle between us. 

 On whether the brothers were privileged because 

 maternal grandfather Vic Richardson had captained Australia 

 Not at all. Whatever the grade of cricket, 

 we got picked because we were good enough. Let me add that 

 our parents sacrificed a few things to make sure we played 

 for Australia... Except for their support, we werent 

 privileged in any way. 

 On interacting with his maternal grandfather 

 He never coached us, but would speak of 

 his experiences... Talking of myself, I havent forgotten 

 what he emphasised: Even if you cant be a good cricketer, 

 at least look like one; after winning the toss, think of 

 batting nine times out of ten. 

 On whether he was a rebel when young 

 No... Thats because I was educated 

 in an atmosphere where one was allowed to speak his mind... 

 One was allowed to question things... If I was rebellious, 

 it was as an army cadet... I couldnt blindly follow 

 orders... In fact, when Gregs elder son Stephen became 

 a fighter pilot, I wondered from where hed got the 

 trait ot listening to orders. The Chappells didnt 

 do that. 

 On being branded a rebel in the later stages 

 of his career 

 Look, I never saw myself as a rebel. Rather, 

 Ive always looked at myself as somebody who speaks 

 his mind... If something was wrong, in my view, it had to 

 be fixed immediately not six months later... Thats 

 how I approached the captaincy... After all, if we lost 

 because something hadnt been put right, my record 

 would get affected..5. It wouldnt hurt some bloody 

 Board member... 

 On the fear that cricket could be more commercially 

 driven in years to come 

 The first reason for playing should always 

 be the love for cricket... That you can make a good living 

 out of it is something that follows... I dont have 

 a problem with that and I do believe it must get to a point 

 where, for the players, its another day in the office. 

 On whether hes happy with cricket in 2005 

 Theres plenty to improve and, for 

 starters, former players should be involved in the administration 

 in a much bigger way... Today, not enough decent cricket 

 minds are involved... The administrators, in my view, have 

 diluted the importance of values by expanding the use of 

 technology... Id like to see cricketers being honest 

 all the time. 

 On his heroes outside cricket 

 American baseballer Jackie Robinson... 

 He broke the colour barrier in 1947... His courage was remarkable... 

 Outside sport, it would be Mahatma Gandhi ? unfortunately, 

 I dont know as much about him as I ought to be knowing 

 ? and Martin Luther King. Like Gandhi, very courageous and 

 very intelligent. They used their mind, not force, to score 

 points. The problem with force is that somebody with more 

 strength may emerge... 

 On who qualifies to be a hero 

 Anybody who makes a difference to the lives 

 of others... Anybody who makes society better... (After 

 a pause) The problem I have with the concept of royalty, 

 for example, is that one has to bow and... That suggests 

 somebody is better than the rest... I have a problem with 

 that as I was brought up to believe everybody is equal... 

 The heroes, of course, stand apart. 

 On the qualities a leader must have 

 Hes got to be honest and hes 

 got to have the respect of his men. 

 On differences with Sir Don Bradman 

 As Ive told you earlier, he lied 

 to me on a few occasions... Also, he tended to treat the 

 Boards money as his own... I respected him as a cricketer, 

 not so as a human being... Im happy I had the guts 

 to stand up to him. 

 Finally, on how would he like to be remembered 

 (Grins again) When I die, I wont 

 be able to worry... How Im going to be remembered 

 is something that doesnt particularly bother me... 

 Obviously, Ive done things in life which I regret... 

 Generally, Im happy with who Ive been... That 

 way, Im comfortable...

 Soma may cheer India at Eden 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Asian Games gold medallist Soma Biswas may come to the Eden and cheer for the Indian eves when they take on their British counterparts in the fifth and final one-dayer here on Friday. 

Since it is an all-women affair, we want Soma to be here and cheer for the team. She has achieved laurels for the country and made us proud, former Indian international Keya Chakraborty (Roy) said. 

Since India have already taken an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series, the fifth one-dayer will be an inconsequential tie. But that doesnt affect the enthusiasm among the women cricketers of the state. 

It is pleasing to note that India have already bagged the five-match series. We intend to promote womens cricket in this part of the country. As a matter of fact, it is in a sorry state in Bengal, said A. K. Ganguly, the chief of the B.C. Ganguly Memorial Committee, who have been entrusted by the Womens Cricket Association of India to stage the final one-dayer. 

The organisers are trying to rope in another former Indian international Ashok Malhotra to be a guest on Friday. 

The organisers plans to give cash awards to the woman of the match and woman of the series are yet to bear fruit since no sponsors so far have responded to it.

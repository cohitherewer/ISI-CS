 Dual role for Pat Cash 

 - Chennai visit 

 Pat Cash will conduct coaching clinics for juniors in Chennai 

Chennai: Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash will play a dual role at the 11th edition of $400,000 Chennai Open starting here on January 2. 

Cash will conduct coaching clinics for promising juniors while also being a key member of the commentators team on ESPN-Star Sports during the week-long premier tennis tournament of south Asia. 

Cash, who had earlier played in the 1997 edition of the meet, has created a unique training and coaching academy, combining sport sciences with discipline of hard work. 

I am doubly thrilled at my second outing in Chennai. I eagerly look forward to coming back to this great city of tennis lovers. 

While commentating on the matches is by itself very exciting, I am keener about my role as a coach for promising youngsters, he said in a statement issued by the organisers on Tuesday.. It would be great to give back to this city and its youth brigade important lessons that will help them become future champions. I look forward to this opportunity, said Cash, who has won seven singles titles and 12 doubles titles in a sparkling career. 

He won Wimbledon singles title in 1987 and doubles title in 1984-85. (PTI)

 Soma eyes European circuit 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Soma Biswas feels she can be more consistent and improve her performance by taking part in the European circuit, but money remains the problem. 

Speaking during a felicitation ceremony organised by the Athletics Coaches Association of Bengal on Friday, the Asian Athletics Championships gold-medallist said, There is no point taking part in national tournaments any more because I wont get any worthy competition. 

I want to participate in the upcoming meets in Italy and Switzerland, but it will depend largely on whether I find any sponsors or someone to fund me. 

Soma also feels she can do well with a personal coach.

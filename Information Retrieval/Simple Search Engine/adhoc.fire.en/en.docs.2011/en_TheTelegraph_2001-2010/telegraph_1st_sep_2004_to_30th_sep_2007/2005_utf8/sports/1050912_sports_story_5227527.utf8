 Atwal drops to joint 29th

Vancouver: Arjun Atwal faltered midway through his third round with a string of bogeys to drop to a three-over 73 that took him down to tied 29th place in the $4.9 million Bell Canadian Open on the US Tour. 

Atwal, tied eighth overnight, is now two-over for the tournament after rounds of 72, 67 and 73 on the par-70 course at the Shaughnessy Golf Club course. 

Mark Calcavecchia held on to the lead on a day when Stephen Ames tied the course record of 64. Calcavecchia, the 1989 British Open champion, started the day with a five-shot lead, and saw it shrink to one after a round of 72.

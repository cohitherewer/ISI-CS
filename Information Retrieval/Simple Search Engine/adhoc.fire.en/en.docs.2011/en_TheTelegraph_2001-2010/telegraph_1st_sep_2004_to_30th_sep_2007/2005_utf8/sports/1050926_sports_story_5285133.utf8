 Ghei ends tied 12th

 Taipei: Gaurav Ghei was the lone Indian to shoot an under-par round of 71 in the final to finish tied 12th while Lu Wei-Chih of Chinese Taipei claimed his maiden title by two strokes after carding a final round of two-over-par 74 at the $ 400,000 Mercuries Taiwan Masters on Sunday. 

Shiv Kapur (74) who seemed to have put himself in line for an excellent finish after a fine front nine, shot a four-over on the backstretch and ended tied 18th at five-over for the week.

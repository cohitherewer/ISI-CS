 Sania moves up to 72nd

New Delhi: Her lacklustre show in recent times notwithstanding, Sania Mirza has improved her world ranking by three places in the latest WTA rating list released Monday. 

The 18-year-old Indian who is preparing for the Wimbledon tennis championships beginning next week moved up to 72 from her last weeks ranking of 75. 

Her career best ranking was 70, which she touched last month before slipping a few places in the next few weeks. 

The Indian has a good chance to improve her rankings further in the coming weeks when she plays in the Wimbledon, which is played on her favourite surface grass. 

Meanwhile, in the ATP rankings for mens doubles pairs, Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia were rated fifth while Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge of Australia were at the 10th spot. 

In singles, Justine Henin-Hardenne moved up a spot in the WTA ranking to No. 1 following her victory in the French Open. Otherwise there were not much movement in the both the ATP and WTA rankings list published on Monday.

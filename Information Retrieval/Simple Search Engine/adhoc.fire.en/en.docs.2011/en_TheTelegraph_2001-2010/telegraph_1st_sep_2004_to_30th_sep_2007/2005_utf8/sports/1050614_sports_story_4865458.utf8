 Kimi Raikkonen made no mistake

 KEVIN GARSIDE

Montreal: Kimi Raikkonen made no mistake this time. The victory that should have been his at the Nurburgring was duly recovered in Canada, courtesy of the kind of luck that deserted him a fortnight ago. Better still, championship leader Fernando Alonso failed to finish, allowing Raikkonen to claw back the 10 points he had ripped from his grasp in Germany. 

Raikkonen had a rare mistake from Alonso and a catastrophic error by his team-mate, Juan Pablo Montoya, to thank for his success on the Isle Notre Dame here (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

Alonso clipped a wall as he blazed out of turn 10. Unfortunate, but even champions elect make mistakes. Montoya will be in the cooler for days after ignoring the red light as he came out of the pit lane. He was perhaps unlucky to pit at the same time Jenson Button clobbered a wall to bring out the safety car. 

The cars were running under the yellow flag when he emerged. Instead of waiting for the all-clear in the pits, he came out anyway and was subsequently disqualified. That left Raikkonen with only Michael Schumacher to see off in the closing 15 laps. Schumacher closed to within metres at the finish, but the result was never in doubt. 

How different things looked an hour and 40 minutes earlier, when all eyes were on Button and Schumacher at the front. In what proved a prelude to a miserable afternoon, Button did not even make it to the first corner in front, a distance of only 200 metres. He was taken on either side by the Renaults of Giancarlo Fisichella and Alonso. 

At least he managed to lead the race until the first round of stops when he started from pole at Imola last year. That day, too, Button had Schumacher five metres behind him on the front row. The proximity of the world champion appeared to unsettle Button then. Not here. He was entirely undone by the brilliance of the flying Renaults. Schumacher also went backwards, at twice the rate, with the McLarens of Montoya and Raikkonen sweeping past. 

To add to the embarrassment of Schumacher and Button, the pair were first to pit, the Ferrari after 12 laps, the BAR after 15. Burdened by fuel they were not. Their retreat from the front left the seasons outstanding cars to duel for supremacy. Fisichella led Alonso, Montoya had Raikkonen glued to his rear. By the time Alonso and Raikkonen pitted on the 24th lap, the four were more than half a minute clear of the field. 

They were immediately followed a lap later by their respective team-mates. All four returned to the fray as they left it, filling the leading positions, though Montoya may have edged Alonso had he not gone wide as he left the pits. 

As the second stint unfolded, the bad luck that has dogged Fisichella since his victory at the seasons opening race in Australia, returned. After holding up Alonso for seven laps, Fisichella brought his ailing car back to the pits, his afternoon ending early for the fourth time in eight races. 

Alonso now had Montoya and Raikkonen to contend with, the rhythm of the race mirroring the story of the championship, flying McLarens in pursuit of the seasons pre-eminent force. They did not have to wait long. Five laps after Fisichellas demise, Alonso was back in the garage. Unlike Fisichella, who was undone by mechanical failure, Alonso was the architect of his own downfall, clipping the wall as he exited turn nine. Though he made it back to the pits, the damage incurred to his rear right wheel proved terminal. 

Montoya happily accepted the gift to lead a Grand Prix for the first time in a McLaren. Button ought to have been smiling, too. The departure of the Renaults dragged him back into third. Perhaps it was the excitement of heading for a legitimate podium finish for the first time this season that got the better of him. 

As he came onto the start-finish straight at the start of the 48th lap, Button hit the kerb too hard and clattered into the wall.Button arrived back at the pits about the same time as Nick Heidfeld, whose recent good run came to an abrupt halt when his engine blew.Much of the preamble to the Canadian Grand Prix focused on the state of relations between Williams and their engine partner. At least there was no doubt about where the fault in performance lay Sunday. The Daily Telegraph

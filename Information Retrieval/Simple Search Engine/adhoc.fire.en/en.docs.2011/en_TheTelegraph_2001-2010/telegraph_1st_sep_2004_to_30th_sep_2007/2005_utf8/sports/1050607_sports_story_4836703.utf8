 Bryant wins, Atwal finishes 45th

 The bogeyman keeps haunting Atwal 

Dublin (Ohio): US Bart Bryant fired a final round four-under-par 68 on Sunday to capture the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio, by one stroke from Fred Couples. 

Spending nearly as much time in hospital as on the PGA Tour, the injury-prone Texan turned a back nine rally and nervy 18th at the Muirfield Village Golf Club into a 16-under 272 for his second career title. 

Indias Arjun Atwal failed to reproduce his earlier form, finishing the final round at two over and totalling 288 for a tied 45th finish. 

He started the round with a bogey before saving it with a birdie, but went into the bogey routine again. He hit three birdies, but cancelled all that with five bogeys. In all, in this meet, he scored 14 birdies, and cancelled all that with 14 bogeys. 

Not only that. He hit an eagle, and cancelled that with a double bogey. 

So far, from the nine events he has played (he has made the cut in all), he has gathered $ 686,701 and stands 57th on the Tours money winners list. 

Three-time Memorial champion Tiger Woods, playing his first event since his record run of 142 consecutive PGA Tour cuts ended at the Byron Nelson Championship three weeks ago, rebounded with a solid performance to bolster his US Open preparations. 

Woods carded a final round 68 to finish in a tie for third with Bo Van Pelt and Jeff Sluman at 12-under 276. 

Even par through the front nine, Bryant mounted a determined charge at the turn with four birdies, but sealed the victory with a gritty 15-foot par putt on the last after his tee shot had found a hazard to leave Couples needing a birdie to tie. 

Along with the $990,000 purse, the victory carried a special bonus for the 42-year-old journeyman, earning him a spot in the US Open at Pinehurst in two weeks time. 

It was the second win in nine months for Bryant, who collected his maiden title at the Texas Open last September, rewarding his resilience in a career disrupted by two elbow and shoulder operations that has limited him to only six full seasons since 1991. 

Im almost speechless, its a real honour to win here at Jacks (Nicklaus) tournament, said Bryant, who has made six successful trips to Qualifying school during his career. 

At the beginning of day I had high hopes but there are so many good players out there. 

While Bryants story is compelling, it was another underdog, Fred Couples who had the massive galleries cheering. 

Without a win since 2003, Couples chances of returning to the winners circle appeared slim going one over through his first eight holes. 

However, the former Masters champion carded five birdies on his next seven holes to surge to the top of the leaderboard, much to the approval of the galleries. 

But the hard work was undone by a bogey on 16, and a second Memorial title slipped through his fingers despite a three-under 69. 

Bart deserved to win, Couples said. It was nip and tuck with four or five people, then we pulled ahead and I had a great time.

London: Stephen Huss and Wesley Moodie became the first qualifiers to win the Wimbledon mens doubles title on Saturday by beating American twins Bob and Mike Bryan 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3. 

While South African Moodie, 26, reached the third round in the singles at the All England Club in 2003, Huss was previously almost an unknown to followers of top-rank tennis. 

Nine-time Wimbledon doubles champion Todd Woodbridge announced his retirement following his defeat to the debutants with Mahesh Bhupathi in the second round and in the semi-final they beat the defending champions Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi. 

Huss and Moodie had never stepped on court together in a tour level event before this tournament but having come through the two qualifying rounds the pairing claimed some notable scalps.

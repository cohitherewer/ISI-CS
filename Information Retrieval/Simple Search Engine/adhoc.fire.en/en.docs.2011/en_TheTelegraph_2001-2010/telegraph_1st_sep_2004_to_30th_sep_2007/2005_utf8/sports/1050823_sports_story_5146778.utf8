Calcutta: Henry Chukwukei, who played for Mohammedan Sporting last season, is in the middle of a new controversy. 

Mohammedan Sporting officials claim that the Nigerian striker, who has been playing in the Maldives, has taken an advance from the club, but is now remaining incommunicado. 

The city club has also learnt that a Maldivian outfit has also made advance payment to Henry. 

Mohammedan Sporting has brought the matter to the notice of both AIFF and IFA, asking the national federation to take necessary steps against the Nigerian.

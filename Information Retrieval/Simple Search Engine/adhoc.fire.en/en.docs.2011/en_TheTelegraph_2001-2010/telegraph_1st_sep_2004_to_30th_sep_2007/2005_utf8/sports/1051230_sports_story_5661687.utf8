 I know I can be better in 2006: Woods

 At 30, Woods eyes Nicklaus career record 

Washington: Tiger Woods makes the turn on Friday onto the back side of 30, celebrating his landmark birthday with 10 major titles and a fighting chance at surpassing Jack Nicklaus career record in the next decade. 

Although my friends keep reminding me, it hasnt really sunk in yet, Woods said of his 30th birthday. I dont feel old, but I have been grinding on the PGA Tour for almost 10 years now, which is pretty scary. 

What Woods has done to his rivals in that time is truly frightening. 

He has won the Masters four times and the US and British Opens and PGA Championship twice each, including a run of four consecutive major titles from the 2000 US Open through the 2001 Masters ? the Tiger Slam. 

I never thought Id win 10 major championships in my 20s because that has never happened before, Woods said. 

Hopefully, my best years are still ahead of me. 

Woods needs a back nine of major crowns to surpass the 18 career majors captured by boyhood idol Nicklaus. 

If Woods is right and his best years are ahead, other players can only wonder how good he might ultimately become. 

People keep asking me if I can improve. Are you kidding? You never get there, Woods said. Any time you think youve arrived in a sport, its time to quit. 

Thats what excites me about 2006: I know I can be better than I am today. (AFP)

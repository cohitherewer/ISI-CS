 Ferguson calls for united front

[+uc('OLIVER KAY 

THE TIMES, LONDON')+]

 Ferguson feels both Keane and he are combustible characters 

An armoured police van was required to protect the Glazer brothers from a lynch mob on their only previous visit to Old Trafford since the familys take-over of Manchester United, but while a heavy security presence was required as they headed for the stadium again on Tuesday night, they were offered a more cordial welcome by Sir Alex Ferguson, who admitted that his tentative support for the new owners has led to calls for his resignation. 

Fergusons refusal to condemn the take-over, having previously been vocal in his support of anti-Glazer organisations such as Shareholders United, has earned him criticism for some supporters. 

A lot has been said about the (takeover) situation, with calls for my resignation in some quarters, the United manager said. But when the club became a plc., somebody was going to buy it. Lets stand together and be a truly united football club. Its the only way to achieve success, so lets welcome the Glazers to United and show them whats so special about the club they bought ? and what makes Old Trafford a truly electrifying place. 

Ferguson also admitted for the first time that he had an argument with Roy Keane on a training camp in Portugal before ? although not necessarily leading to ? the captains absence from the pre-season tour. 

Roy and I had a few words at our training camp in Portugal, but as I say, an argument is nothing, Ferguson said. We are both combustible characters and we are always having arguments. I wish I had a pound for every row I have ever had with Roy.

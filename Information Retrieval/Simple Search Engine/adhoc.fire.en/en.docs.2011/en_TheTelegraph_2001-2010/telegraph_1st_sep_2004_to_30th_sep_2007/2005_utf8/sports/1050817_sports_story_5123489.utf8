 AUG.15 DIGEST 

 New Delhi: Sania Mirza just about managed to remain in the top-50 bracket following her first-round loss in the $585,000 women?s tennis event in Los Angeles last week. Sania, who had reached a career high ranking of 48 a week ago, slipped two places to be at 50 in the latest WTA Tour rankings released Monday.

 Meanwhile, Roger Federer became the seventh longest reigning world No. 1 in ATP rankings history. The Swiss player overtook the 80 weeks Llyeton Hewitt spent atop the men?s rankings from November 2001 to June 2003.

 New Delhi: India?s Amit Sanghi finished 19th in men?s skeet event in the ISSF World Cup shooting in Americana, Brazil. Sanghi, who finished 18th in the Belgrade World Cup last month, scored a total of 119/125 points. The Hyderabad-based shooter returned scores of 23, 23, 24, 24 and 25 in the five rounds, according to information received here.

 The other Indians in the fray Allan Daniel ended 33rd with a total of 117 points (23, 22, 25, 24 and 23) while Congress? Lok Sabha MP Naveen Jindal came 44th with a total of 110 points (20, 23, 23, 22, 22).

 The gold medal went to 16-year-old Vincent Hancock of the US. 

 London: Dinesh Mongia announced his return to form with an imperious 164 which helped Leicestershire take a vital first innings lead against Durham in a County Championship Division Two match at Riverside. Replying to Durham?s first innings score of 315, Leicestershire posted 443 for a 128-run lead on the fourth and final day of the rain-affected match. Mongia blasted his way to 164 off 191 balls, studded with 26 fours and three sixes before being dismissed while attempting a big shot off Gareth Breese, the off-spin bowler from West Indies. Breese was the most successful performer for Durham returning figures of five for 91 from 19.4 overs.

 Rome: Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson was fined Euro 300 for riding a jet ski too close to shore and without a helmet on the popular tourist island of Capri, police said. 

 Tyson, reported to have linked to misbehaviour on various other islands up and down Italy?s coast in the last week, entered within the safe distance of 500 meters from shore, said police. The fine was paid by the captain of a boat Tyson has been travelling on.

 The incident occurred on Thursday at a time of day when Capri was filled with tourists having come over from nearby Naples or the Amalfi coast.

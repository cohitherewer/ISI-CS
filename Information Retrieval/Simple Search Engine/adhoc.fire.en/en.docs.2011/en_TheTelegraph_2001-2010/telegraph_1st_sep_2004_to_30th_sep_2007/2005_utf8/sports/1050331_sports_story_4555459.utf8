New Delhi: Fifth seed Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge had an easy outing against their American opponents in the men?s doubles second round of the Nasdaq-100 Open tennis tournament at Key Biscayne, Miami. 

Bhupathi and Woodbridge defeated Graydon Olivier and Travis Parrott 6-3, 6-4 to enter the pre-quarter finals of the $3.45 million event, according to information received here on Wednesday. 

They will next play third seed Swede-Belarussian pair of Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi, who scored an identical 6-3, 6-4 win against Ashley Fischer of Australia and Fernando Verdasco of Spain in their second round tie. 

Venus Williams beat her sister Serena for the first time in three and a half years on Tuesday, sealing a place in the semi-finals of the Nasdaq-100 Open with a 6-1, 7-6 victory. 

Venus brought to an end her sister?s three-year reign as women?s champion here and will play Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova in the last four. 

Sharapova beat former world number one Justine Henin-Hardenne 6-1, 6-7, 6-2 in her quarter final to end the Belgian?s comeback run. 

In the men?s draw, six-time champion Andre Agassi went through to the last eight beating French Open champion Gaston Gaudio 7-6, 6-2. 

Top seed Roger Federer survived a stiff fourth round test from Mario Ancic, eventually beating the Croatian 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 to record his 29th win of the season. The Swiss has lost just one match since last August and next plays Tim Henman after the sixth seeded Briton beat Czech Radek Stepanek 7-5 6-3. (Agencies)

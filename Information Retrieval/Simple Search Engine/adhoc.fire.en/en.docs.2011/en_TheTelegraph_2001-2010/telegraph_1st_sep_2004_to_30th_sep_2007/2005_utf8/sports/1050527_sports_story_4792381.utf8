 Lara rescues Windies

 Youhana returned to be with his ailing father 

Bridgetown: Pakistan pacer Shabbir Ahmed made a double strike to leave West Indies struggling on 102 for three at lunch on the opening day of the first Test at the Kensington Oval on Thursday. 

The 29-year-old removed Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan in his opening spell on a pitch which was fresh and had some moisture in it. 

Abdul Razzaq picked up the wicket of Devon Smith to leave the home side reeling on 45 for three after they elected to bat. 

Brian Lara came to the wicket at 25 for 2 and played a punishing 44 from 41 balls with six boundaries to revive the innings. 

He had put on 57 runs with skipper Shivnarine Chanderpaul (14 from 44 balls) with 26 overs bowled in the session. 

Shabbir, out of action with a knee injury since last September, had Gayle (4) playing a casual drive in the fourth over to short extra cover where Razzaq picked up the catch. 

Five overs later he dismissed Sarwan (6) with a beautiful outswinger with debutant Bazid Khan taking a low catch at second slip. 

Pakistan are without captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana. Inzamam is serving a one-match ban for excessive appealing in India and Youhana returned home to be with his ailing father.

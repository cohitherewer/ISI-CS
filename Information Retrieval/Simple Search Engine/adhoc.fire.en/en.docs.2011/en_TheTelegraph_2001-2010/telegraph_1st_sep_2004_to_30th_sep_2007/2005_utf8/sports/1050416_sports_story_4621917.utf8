 Dudu seals Mohun Bagan fate

 Mehtab?s 25 yard shot hit the crossbar 

Margao: A 76th minute goal by Man of the Match Dudu Omagbemi guided Sporting Clube de Goa to victory over Mohun Bagan in a 17th round National Football League (NFL) match here on Friday. 

The winner came after Adebayo Adewusi ran down the right flank. Entering the box, he relayed the ball to Dudu, who got the better of defender Eduardo Coelho and found the far corner of the net to remain the highest goal-scorer with 14 hits. 

Playing a defensive game, Bagan relied on counter attacks and had their best chance in the closing stages of the first half. Mehtab Hussain?s shot from 25 yard hit the cross bar. 

With this win, Sporting brightened their title chances with 35 points from 17 matches, the same as Dempo. 

Bagan, meanwhile, remained on the eighth spot with 17 points from 17 matches. 

Sporting started fluently with early probing that kept Bagan ?keeper Subrata Pal on guard. Sporting had their first chance to score in the 20th minute when Rajesh Meetei released the ball to Joseph Pereira who relayed it to Dudu, but the wily striker shot over. 

Opening up in the closing stages of the first half, Bagan nearly took lead seven minutes before the interval when Mehtab?s shot hit the underneath of the cross bar. 

JCT hold Fransa goalless 

In Ludhiana, hosts JCT Mills held Goa?s Fransa FC goalless. JCT could have clinched the issue in dying minutes but Manjit Singh?s volley was saved by Fransa ?keeper Kalyan Chowbey. 

With this draw Fransa took their tally to 26 points to be in fourth place. JCT have secured 23 points to move to fifth place ahead of Salgaocar.

Colombo: With acting captain Sylvester Josephs inspirational moves halting Sri Lankas run in the IndianOil Cup, the West Indies face-off with India, on Sunday, has become a virtual semi-final. 

This do-or-perish scenario is hardly new, though. 

Rahul Dravids team is ahead by three points (eight vis-?-vis five), but thats of no relevance: The winner qualifies for Tuesdays final against the hosts. Theres a reserve day-provision as well. 

Having surprised the pundits, on Saturday, the West Indies will be aiming for a repeat. However, conditions here arent as pleasant as Dambulla and a double-header is going to be terribly demanding. 

Physically and in the mind. 

Its to be seen, then, whether the West Indies can carry the momentum a shade over 16 hours after stunning Sri Lanka. Even if they dont, they have at least put an end to the demoralising string of one-day defeats ? as many as 11. 

Significantly, till late at night, captain Shivnarine Chanderpauls availability wasnt clear. He scored a solid half-century, but didnt take the field owing to a viral infection. 

Chanderpaul wasnt well even before the toss. 

I wouldnt say theres too much to worry... At the same time, I cant confirm I will play ? its another matter that I would like to, Chanderpaul told The Telegraph. 

Now that the stakes are sky-high, Dravid and Greg Chappell are unlikely to experiment as the best XI has to be out on the (Premadasa) park. 

Its not official, but one learns V.V.S.Laxman, who struggled in his comeback ODI (on Wednesday), isnt in the XIII informally shortlisted after Saturday evenings team meeting. 

Others out of the frame are teenaged Suresh Raina, who featured in the three previous engagements, and Yalaka Venugopal Rao. The latter made the XI in the first two. 

Laxman, who missed the first two matches because of a back problem, toiled for 22 (43 balls) versus Sri Lanka. Now, he has to worry about his future in ODIs. 

While Laxman gets into the worrying-mode, Anil Kumble must be pleased. Its not official, but hes going to make the XI for the first time in the tournament. 

That Kumble is set for a comeback has already been reported in these columns. 

Given the problems with the fifth bowler(s), there are indications that five specialists will be fielded. Yet, this may change overnight... 

Sourav Ganguly was a bit under the weather in the morning (and even left nets early), apparently due to the prawns at our high commissioners reception on Friday, but was fine by the evening. 

Theres nothing to worry... Im definitely playing, the former captain said. 

INDIA (from): Virender Sehwag, Sourav Ganguly, Yuvraj Singh, Rahul Dravid, Mohammed Kaif, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Jai Prakash Yadav.

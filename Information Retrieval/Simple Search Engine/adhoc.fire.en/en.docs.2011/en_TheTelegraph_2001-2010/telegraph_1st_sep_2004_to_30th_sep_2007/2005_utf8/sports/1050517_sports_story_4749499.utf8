 Roman derby under scanner

Milan: Italys main consumers association has called for fans to get their money back and the stock market to take action after Sundays goalless Rome derby between AS Roma and Lazio led to allegations the teams had arranged the result. 

The game ended amid whistles and jeers from both sets of supporters and the consumer association Codacons said it had received calls from fans looking to get their ticket money back. 

Lazio forward Paolo Di Canio and Roma coach Bruno Conti both appeared on Italian television on Sunday denying any agreement had been reached for the draw. 

Roma and Lazio have struggled this season and with two games to go neither side is yet safe from relegation, although the point each got on Sunday could eventually turn out to be vital. 

In a statement Codacons said legal action aimed at retrieving ticket money could be taken out with the Justice of the Peace in Rome. 

Codacons, who described the match as strange also said they were asking the stock market regulator Consob, to intervene. 

We do that because you can read in the newspapers today concerns over a possible agreement between the two teams to end the match in a draw. This is a situation, which if verified, would falsify the value of the shares in Roma and Lazio through faked results, said Codacons president Carlo Rienzi. 

Italian media slammed the performance of both sides with one Rome newspaper branding the match the derby of shame. Never again its headline said. 

Roma-Lazio will go down as the most ugly game of the century and a rip-off for the 66,323 spectators in the Olympic Stadium who did not know whether to laugh or cry, whether to get angry or feel ashamed, the paper wrote. 

The result did little to help either team on Sunday though as none of the bottom four teams in Serie A lost. 

The point gained left Roma just three points away from the relegation zone with two games remaining and Lazio have just one point more. (Reuters)

 Aparna will meet Saina in final 

Jamshedpur: National junior champion Saina Nehwal on Saturday shocked top seed Trupti Murgunde 9-11, 11-8, 13-10 to set up summit clash with Aparna Popat at the 69th senior national badminton here on Saturday. 

Seventh seeded Thomas Kurien, who upset top seed Arvind Bhatt in the men?s singles quarter finals on Friday, fell to eighth seeded Abhinn Shyam Gupta of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) 15-11, 11-15, 15-8 in the semis, while second seed Anup Sridhar ousted unseed Utsav Mishra 15-10, 15-8 in the other last-four clash. 

Fifteen-year-old Nehwal continued her dream run when she took on the experienced Murgunde whose complacency cost her the game. 

Fourth seed Popat of PSPB cut short the march of teammate Jwala Gutta, winning the semis 11-3, 11-1. 

The 26-year-old Popat never allowed Gutta any liberty to manoeuvre and stitched up the win in straight games. 

In the men?s doubles semi-finals, wildcarders Sanave Thomas and K.T. Rupesh Kumar beat fourth seeds J.B.S. Vidyadhar and Chetan Anand of PSPB 15-4, 15-7, 15-4, while second seeds Jaseel P. Ismail and V Diju beat third seeds Marcos Bristow and Jaison Xavier 15-9, 15-6. 

In the women?s doubles, sixth seeds Krishna Dekaraja and Oli Deka beat Trupti and Fatima Nazneen 15-4, 15-4, while second seeds Jwala and Shruti Kurien overcame Aparna Balan and Saina 9-15, 15-12, 17-14 win.

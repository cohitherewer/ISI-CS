 Sydney: Australian Mark 

 Philippoussis Sunday withdrew from the Sydney International 

 tennis tournament with an adductor muscle injury he picked 

 up in last weeks Hopman Cup in Perth. His Australian 

 Open hopes remain in doubt but he said he will continue 

 to receive treatment from a chiropractor in a bid to be 

 ready for the opening Grand Slam tournament of the year 

 starting in Melbourne on January 17.

 Philippoussis? injury ? sustained in a match against Dutchman Peter Wessels ? could not have come at a worse time as the former US Open and Wimbledon finalist attempts to emerge from a troubled year. 

 Philippoussis is ranked outside the top 100 and if he is to play in the Australian Open he will need to match last year?s fourth round appearance to avoid a further slide in the rankings. 

 Frankfurt: Turkish investor Sadettin Saran plans to boost his investment in troubled Borussia Dortmund , the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported. Saran told the paper he planned to double his investment to eight million Euros, giving him a stake of about 10 percent in Borussia, the Bundesliga champions in 2002 who are now grappling with record debt and losses.

 ?I have done much for Turkish football. But that?s not enough for me. I want to make a name for myself in Europe and show that we Turks, too, can work successfully on this stage,? he said. 

 Borussia, Germany?s only listed soccer club, has run up a record debt of almost 120 million Euros. Last week, team manager Stefan Reuter quit the club, sending its stock down.

 Dakar: Defending Dakar 

 rally champion and race leader Stephane Peterhansel remains 

 confident of following up last years victory despite 

 limping home in stage nine on Saturday. The Mitsubishi driver 

 had to play second fiddle to fellow Frenchman and teammate 

 Luc Alphand on the Tidjikja to Atar leg in Mauritania but 

 holds a lead of just over 20 minutes over the former World 

 Cup downhill skier. Sunday is a rest day.

 Peterhansel, the most successful competitor 

 ever to have competed in the event after winning seven of 

 his 17 attempts, six on a bike and one in a car, suffered 

 engine trouble towards the end of the 361-kms stage. ?Forty 

 kilometres before the end of the stage, the engine made 

 a very strange noise. So I drove very carefully and slowly 

 until the finish line to take care of the car,? he said

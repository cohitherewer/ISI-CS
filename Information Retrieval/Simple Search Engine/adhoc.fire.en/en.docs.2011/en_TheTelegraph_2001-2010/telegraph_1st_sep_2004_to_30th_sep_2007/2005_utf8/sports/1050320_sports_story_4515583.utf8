 Lara cleared, 6 others kept out

 Brian Lara?s contract was with the board?s consent 

Bridgetown: The suspension on Brian Lara has been lifted, and the West Indian captain has been invited by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to make himself available to play against South Africa in the upcoming series. His personal contract, it was found, did not intervene with the board?s, making him eligible. 

However, six other national players, banned with Lara by the board two weeks ago, remained ineligible for selection because their endorsement contracts with Cable amp; Wireless were still deemed to be in conflict with telecommunications rival Digicel, the board?s chief sponsor. 

Lara, a veteran of 112 Tests and captain since 2003, agreed Friday to decide within 24 hours whether he will play for the West Indies in the first of four Tests against South Africa, starting in Georgetown, Guyana March 31. 

In the meantime, the WICB delayed the announcement of its squad for a second straight day.. 

Lara and the other Cable amp; Wireless-contracted players Dwayne Bravo, Fidel Edwards, Chris Gayle, Ravi Rampaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Dwayne Smith were originally ruled out of contention by the WICB when it chose 22 players March 4 to prepare for the series. 

The seven players? contracts were given to the WICB last weekend so its lawyers could determine whether they included any breach of its $ 20 million agreement with Digicel.

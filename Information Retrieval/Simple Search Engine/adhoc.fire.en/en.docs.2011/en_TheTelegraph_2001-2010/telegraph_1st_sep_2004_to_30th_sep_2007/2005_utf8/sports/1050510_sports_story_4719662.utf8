The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhaichung diagnosed with hepatitis 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhaichung Bhutia needs to be under medical care for 2-3 weeks 

Calcutta: With the National Football League (NFL) crown almost out of reach, theres more bad news for East Bengal. 

Bhaichung Bhutia has already been ruled out of the red-and-gold outfits AFC Cup engagement against Muktijoddha Sansad and the India captain is now doubtful for the teams final couple of NFL matches as well. 

Bhaichung, who was fast losing weight since playing against Nebitchi FC in Turkmenistan in the AFC Cup on March 16, was admitted to a private hospital on Monday. 

The doctors attending to the player say though hes likely to be released in a ?couple of days?, he needs rest for recuperation. 

?Bhaichung has been admitted for diagnosis. Endoscopy and some blood tests were done on him Monday, which indicated hes had a little bit of hepatitis and thyroid abnormalities,? Dr Mahesh Goenka, head of the gastro-enteritis department of the hospital, said on Monday. 

?He is likely to be released day after tomorrow, but he needs to be under medical care for at least two-three weeks,? he added. 

East Bengal team doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta also didnt press the panic button. 

?Theres nothing to worry. Hes been losing weight considerably and feeling weak. So he will undergo a series of tests to determine the cause,? he said. 

Bhaichung scored one goal in East Bengals 2-3 loss against Nebitchi FC. Since returning, he was complaining of indifferent health. 

He was pressed into service in the previous NFL match against Mahindra United in Mumbai, but he clearly struggled during his stay in the second-half. 

East Bengal lost 0-1 to Mahindra, denting their hopes of completing the hattrick of NFL titles. 

Meanwhile, Subhas Bhowmicks wards left for Dhaka on Monday to take on Muktijoddha in their AFC Cup match, slated for Wednesday. 

Coach and veteran defender Debjit Ghosh will join the squad in Dhaka on Tuesday. 

Without Bhaichung and with the fate of retaining the NFL crown looking a distant dream, Bhowmick may have a hard time motivating his team against the Bangaldeshi outfit. 

The unavailability of Marcos Secco and Selwyn Fernandes (owing to double booking) has further dented Bhowmicks chances. 

East Bengal need to win their last two matches (the other being Nebitchi at home on May 25) to keep their hopes alive for moving into the next round.

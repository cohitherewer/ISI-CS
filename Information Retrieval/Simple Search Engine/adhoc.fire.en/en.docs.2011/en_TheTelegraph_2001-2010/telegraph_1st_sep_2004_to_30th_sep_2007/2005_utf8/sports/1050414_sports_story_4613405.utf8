 Italian PM for drastic steps

Rome: Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi authorised the use of ?drastic measures? on Wednesday in a crackdown on violence in Italy?s football stadiums. 

Berlusconi, who also owns AC Milan, met interior minister Giuseppe Pisanu, a day after a barrage of missiles from Inter Milan fans led to their team?s Champions League match against AC Milan being called off at San Siro on Tuesday. 

Berlusconi?s office issued a statement warning: ?There is a clear risk of even more serious incidents in future, a risk which must be avoided by all possible means. Resorting to the most drastic measures available should not be ruled out if necessary.? 

Tuesday?s quarter final was the second Champions League game in Italy to be called off this season because of violence. AS Roma?s match with Dynamo Kiev in September was stopped after referee Anders Frisk was struck by a missile. 

Meanwhile, Inter Milan can expect severe punishment when Uefa meet on Friday to decide what action to take over the abandoned quarter final match against city rivals AC Milan, another report adds from Milan. 

Having won the first-leg 2-0, AC Milan were leading the second leg 1-0 after 73 minutes on Tuesday when the game was stopped because flares were thrown on to the pitch of the San Siro stadium the two clubs share. 

Uefa could order the second leg to be replayed or just the last 17 minutes, but precedent suggests AC Milan will be awarded victory and Inter handed a very heavy fine or a suspension and a banning order. 

AC Milan director Umberto Gandini said it was a bad night for the city of Milan. 

?Whatever result will come (from Uefa), it has been very, very difficult and very sad,? Gandini told a news channel. 

?It will be difficult to clean the image of the Milan stadium, the Milan supporters and the city in general but I think a penalty is deserved and I think Inter people know they deserve a penalty.? 

said Gandini, adding that he did not want Inter kicked out of competition. (REUTERS)

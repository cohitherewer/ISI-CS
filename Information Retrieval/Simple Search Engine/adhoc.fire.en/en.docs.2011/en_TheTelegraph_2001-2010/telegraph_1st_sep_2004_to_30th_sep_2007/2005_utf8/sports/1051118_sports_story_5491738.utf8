 Shabbir, Malik reported again

London: Pakistan pace bowlers Shabbir Ahmed and Shoaib Malik have been reported for suspected illegal bowling actions after Pakistans first Test against England in Multan, the ICC said on Thursday. 

Match Referee Roshan Mahanama said they would be able to continue playing in the Test series pending the outcome of biomechanical analysis of their actions. 

The position is that we have got the Match Referee and umpires report from the ICC. Shabbirs case is a bit complicated and the ICC will advise us in next 48 hours if he should continue to bowl in the series, PCB director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf said. 

Altaf said the selectors and Pakistan team management had been advised to discuss a replacement for Shabbir in case he is unable bowl again in the series.

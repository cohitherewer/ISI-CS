 Di Stefano in hospital 

Madrid: Real Madrid great Alfredo Di Stefano is in a stable condition in hospital in Sagunto near Valencia after suffering a heart attack in the early hours of Saturday morning. 

Alfredo Di Stefano was admitted to the hospital at 1245 GMT last night complaining of pains in his chest and tests have revealed that he had suffered an acute heart attack, doctor Victoria de la Cueva said in a statement. 

He is in the intensive care unit at the moment. His condition has improved and he is conscious. He is aware of what is going on, is stable and breathing well on his own. 

Doctor de la Cueva said the 79-year-old Argentine would remain under observation in the intensive care unit for at least 48 hours. 

Di Stefano, Real Madrids honorary president and record goal scorer, led the Spanish club to five consecutive European Cups between 1956 and 1960 and eight Spanish league titles. He was voted Europoean Footballer of the Year in 1957 and 1959. 

An immensely versatile player, Di Stefano began his career at River Plate in 1945, but joined Colombian club Millonarios four years later following a players strike in Argentina. 

He led Real to the 1953-54 championship, which was only the clubs third league title in their history, and together with winger Paco Gento he revolutionised a team that went on to dominate European football in the late 1950s. 

Di Stefano was the key player in Reals five consecutive European Cup victories, scoring goals in every final and a hattrick in their stunning 7-3 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park in 1960.

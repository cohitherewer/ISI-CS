 NZ govt letter to ICC

Wellington: The New Zealand government has written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) asking it to exclude Zimbabwe from future tours because of concerns about human rights abuses under President Robert Mugabe. 

Foreign minister Phil Goff, in a letter to ICC, also urged that the New Zealand team be allowed to cancel its scheduled trip to Zimbabwe without facing a hefty fine.

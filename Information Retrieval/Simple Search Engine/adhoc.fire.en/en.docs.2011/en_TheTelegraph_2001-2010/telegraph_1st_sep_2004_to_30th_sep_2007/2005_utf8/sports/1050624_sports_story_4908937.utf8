 Sasi finishes third

 Sasikiran drew with Berkes 

Paks: GM Krishnan Sasikiran played out an enterprising draw with Hungarian GM Ferenc Berkes in the 10th and final round game to finish third in the third Marx Gyrogy Memorial Grandmasters chess tournament. 

Hungarian Zoltan Almasi emerged as the winner of the category-15 double round robin event after taking a quick draw with compatriot Peter Acs while Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland drew with top seed Emil Sutovsky of Israel in the other game of the last round. 

Almasi finished with 6.5 points out of a possible 10 while Korchnoi finished with 6, half a point more than Sasikiran. Berkes was fourth on 5 points while Sutovsky and Acs tied for the last spot on 3.5 points apiece. 

Sasikirans winning run towards the end was halted by Berkes in a well-fought game. Playing the black side of a Queens Gambit declined, the Hungarian won a sacrificed pawn early in the middle game but soon he fell under some difficulties as Sasikirans tactical motives came to light. (PTI)

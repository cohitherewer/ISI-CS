 Lawson cleared by ICC

London: West Indies pacer Jermaine Lawsons bowling action has been cleared after the ICC ruled that his action complies with the laws of the game. 

The ICC stated that analysis of Lawsons action ? reported as suspecting in July ? showed that his arm was not flexed at the elbow by more than the 15 degrees allowed under current regulations. 

The ICC also noted that Lawsons action had improved since he was reported during a Test in Sri Lanka, although it added that there were still areas of potential concern which had been notified to the West Indies Cricket Board. 

David Richardson, the ICC general manager said, The findings of the report mean that Jermaine can continue to bowl in International cricket. 

It is important to be aware, however, that no bowler is ever cleared as they could simply revert to bad habits. All bowlers are subject to further reporting if the match officials are of the view that they have concerns about whether a delivery or deliveries conform to the laws of cricket when observed with the naked eye. 

Lawson took eight wickets in the Test which led to him being reported, although that was not enough to prevent a second-string West Indies side slumping to a six-wicket defeat. 

Umpires Simon Taufel of Australia and Nadeem Ghauri of Pakistan had expressed particular concern about the Lawsons short-pitched deliveries. 

He was also reported after taking seven for 78 against Australia in Antigua in 2003.

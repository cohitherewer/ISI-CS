 Hackett swims way into history

 - WORLD AQUATICS - Aussie Jade Edmistone sets 50m breaststroke world mark 

 Jade Edmistone celebrates her world record in the 50m breaststroke at the World Aquatics in Montreal on Sunday 

Montreal: Grant Hackett finished the 11th Fina World Championships as he started them by winning another gold medal to enhance his reputation as the greatest long-distance swimmer on the final night of competition on Sunday. 

The Australian captured the 1500m freestyle to become the first swimmer to win the same event four times, eight days after he won his first 400m freestyle gold. 

Hackett, awarded the Fina Trophy for the Best Male Swimmer of the Championships, led all the way to win in a time of 14:42.58 and extend his unbeaten record in the event since 1996. 

American Larsen Jenson finished second in 14:47.58, while David Davies of Britain was third in 14:48.11 in a repeat of the placings at last years Athens Olympics. 

It is an awesome feeling to be able to achieve something like that and be the first person in history to do it, said Hackett. It is something that I have been focussing on and its really satisfying to do it. 

The 25-year-old law student also became the first person to win seven career individual world titles, surpassing the previous record of six he shared with Ian Thorpe and Michael Phelps, and finished the week with three golds. He also shattered Thorpes 800m world record. 

Phelps won his fifth gold medal in Montreal without even getting wet on Sunday when the US took the mens 4x100m medley relay. Phelps was not selected in the team but still got a medal because he swam in the heats. 

Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker and Jason Lezak won the relay in a time of 3:31.85. Peirsol and Hansen both finished with three gold medals each after winning the 100m-200m doubles in backstroke and breaststroke respectively. 

Russia finished second in 3:35.08, with Japan coming in third in 3:35.40. 

American teenager Katie Hoff struck gold for the third time when she won the 400m individual medley to ensure the US topped the medals table with 15 golds. 

Hoff, 16, won in 4:36.07 to add to the 200m medley and 4x200m relay golds. 

Zimbabwes Kirsty Coventry finished second to end with two golds and two silvers. She single-handedly helped her troubled African nation finish third on the medal table and earned herself the Fina Trophy for the Best Female Swimmer. 

Australia, who dominated the womens events with 10 titles, won three golds on Sunday to finish second with 13 while Zimbabwe, South Africa, France and Poland finished tied for third with two each. 

Australias Jade Edmistone set the ninth and final world record of the meet in 50m breaststroke, while compatriot Libby Lenton won the 50m freestyle to claim her first individual world title. 

Edmistone won her first gold in a time of 30.45 to shave 0.12 seconds off the 30.57 set by Zoe Baker at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. American teenager Jessica Hardy , who set the 100m breaststroke world record earlier this week, finished second in 30.85, while Brooke Hanson of Australia was third in 30.89. 

Lenton won the 50m freestyle in 24.59. Marlene Veldhuis of The Netherlands finished second in 24.83, while Zhu Yingwen of China was third in 24.91. 

Laszlo Cseh of Hungary capitalised on Phelps decision to skip the 400m individual medley to win in a time of 4:09.63. Luca Marin of Italy was second in 4:11.67, while Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia was third in 4:13.47. 

Aristeidis Grigoriadis became the first Greek to win a world title with victory in the 50m backstroke, snatching the gold in 24.95. Australias Matt Welsh finished second in 24.99, while Liam Tancock of Britain was third in 25.02. 

Meanwhile, the Championships ended with pleas from coaches and swimmers for a return to staging the event once every four years. 

Wed really like to encourage the World Championships to be once every four years, said US coach Dave Salo. Its just such a crowded calendar. 

I personally think we should have one world championships in between the Olympics just like we use to do, that would be the best, said Phelps coach, Bob Bowman. Its just to hard to get up every year. 

Relief for the worlds top swimmers, however, would appear far away as Fina president Mustapha Larfaoui dismissed any suggestion that it might return to staging the meet once every four years. 

The 2007 championships will be held in Melbourne.

 Dullet well placed

Pune: Patiala-based Jaskeerat Dullet placed himself in a sound position by carding a two-under par 69 in the penultimate round of the Royal Challenge Pune Amateur Golf Championship at the Poona Club Course here on Thursday. 

Six strokes behind Dullet ? whose score stood at eight under par 205 ? was Jasjeet Singh, who carded a three-under par 68. 

In third and fourth places were Anirban Lahiri of Bangalore (one under 212) and Manav Jaini of Delhi (par 213). 

Dullet began in a sluggish manner before a birdie on the seventh. (PTI)

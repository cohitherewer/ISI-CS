 Advani, Sethi set up title clash

New Delhi: Pankaj Advani will look for a double when he takes on top seed Geet Sethi in the final of the IBSF time frame format championship in Qawra, Malta. 

Advani, who came into the competition winning the 150-up format, defeated Ashok Shandilya 1700-1090 after the latter was in front for the first part of the match. 

In another semi-final, three-time IBSF champion Sethi comfortably won 1493-925 against fellow Indian Devendra Joshi. 

Joshi pushed Sethi ? the finalist of the previous two editions ? for the first three hours of the match, but the latter pulled it away in the last hour to book the final berth.

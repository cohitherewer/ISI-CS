 Englands Test refusal justified: Imran

 - Unless the law and order situation is restored (in Karachi) such things will happen 

Karachi: Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan said Wednesday that Englands refusal to play a Test in Karachi this winter was justified. 

England said they would not play a Test in the violence-prone city, but agreed to play a one-day International there and will decide in 10 days time whether to play a second game as well. 

Until and unless the law and order situation is restored such things will happen, Imran said. 

When Englands security team was in Karachi the city mayor was quoted in a newspaper as saying that local elections next months will see bloodshed and everyone took notice of it, said Imran. 

You cant blame the Pakistan Cricket Board because in such a situation if they press for a Test in Karachi the whole tour might get jeopardised. 

However cricket officials in Karachi vowed to protest the decision and hit out at the PCB for failing to argue the case for the countrys largest city. 

Englands refusal to play a Test in Karachi is disappointing and we would protest over it, Karachi City Cricket Association secretary Sirajul Islam Bukhari said. The PCB has failed to plead the case of Karachi, Bukhari added. 

Meanwhile, Englands decision to avoid a Test in Karachi was due partly to security concerns for the teams Barmy Army travelling fans, a PCB official said. 

They told us they were reluctant to play in Karachi as they had safety concerns not only for their players but also for their supporters, the official said on Wednesday. 

The official, who declined to be identified, said ECB officials were expecting many England supporters to travel to Pakistan for their teams three Tests and five one-day matches, beginning in October.

Port-of-Spain: Boeta Dippenaar struck a 41-ball half-century to lead South Africa to a seven-wicket victory over West Indies and a 5-0 series whitewash in Sundays final game. 

Dippenaar scored 61 not out, with five sweetly-struck fours and a superb six over long-off, as South Africa chased down a target of 139 in 20 overs with five balls to spare in a match reduced to its bare minimum by persistent morning rain. 

While South Africa have had two seasons of domestic 20-over cricket, the shortest version of the game was a new experience for West Indian cricket. 

South Africa were not extended by a mediocre West Indian score after opening batsman AB de Villiers got their innings off to a flying start with 30 off 25 balls. 

After his uppercut off left-arm seamer Ian Bradshaw was caught by Brian Lara at third man, there was more punishment for the West Indies bowlers from Dippenaar. 

South Africas big guns, Jacques Kallis (18) and Justin Kemp (8) were dismissed relatively cheaply but Dippenaars controlled innings ensured they never strayed from the road to victory. 

A mad scramble of runs left West Indies with a modest total of 138 for seven wickets after South Africa won the toss and asked them to bat first. 

Chris Gayle posed his usual threat during a dynamic burst of 28 from just 20 balls at the start of the innings but, like most of the batsmen, he made the mistake of trying to hit a boundary off every ball and paid the price. 

Gayle smashed 14 runs off paceman Andre Nels first three deliveries but then skied the fourth ball to third man. 

The talismanic Lara made a hash of a full toss from part-time spinner Justin Ontong and was caught at short third man for just 12, while Ramna-resh Sarwan (15) was also cau-ght playing a poor slog shot. 

All-rounder Dwayne Bravo gave the home side a chance with an unbeaten 41 from 40 deliveries, with three boundaries, but the home sides total always looked below par against South African batsmen.

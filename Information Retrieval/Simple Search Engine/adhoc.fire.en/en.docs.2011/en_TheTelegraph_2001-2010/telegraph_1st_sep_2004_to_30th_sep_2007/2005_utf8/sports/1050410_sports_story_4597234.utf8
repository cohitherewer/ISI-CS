The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India hope to rewrite history

 - WOMEN?S WORLD CUP 

- Seventh appearance in final for ladies from land down under 

 Anjum Chopra 

Durban: After beating New Zealand for their maiden appearance in final, India?s women cricketers would be seeking to achieve what their male counterparts could not do two years back ? winning the World Cup crown by beating Australia. 

The side, which is in sublime form having lost just one match in the competition so far, will face an uphill task against four-time winners Australia at Supersport Park, Centurion, on Sunday. 

But if the form of their players in the tournament is any indication, India could very well rewrite history by surprising their formidable opponents. 

The team?s recent performance in a one-day series against Australia at home was highly commendable when they showed a lot of character despite losing the series 3-4. 

India?s only concern would be the fitness of their captain Mithali Raj, who is nursing a knee injury. 

Mithali was instrumental in the win against New Zealand in the semi-finals where she struck an unbeaten 91 to earn the Player of the Match award. 

The Indian captain, however, was confident of taking the field in the all-important tie. 

?I will definitely play the final. I cannot just leave my team now. I suffered the injury while playing the nationals before the World Cup, and it had almost healed, but I don?t need to worry about that,? she said. 

Among India?s plans to conquer Australia, one is seeing off the new ball while batting. 

?They just have one bowler who is very quick ? Cathryn Fitzpatrick. In the first semi-finals, England lost the game when Fitzpatrick took three wickets in her first spell, thus exposing the English middle order. We need to keep that in mind and survive the first spell,? Mithali said. 

Having come thus far, India would be hoping that Mithali, who has so far accumulated 193 runs for a tournament-best average of 65, and senior batswoman Anjum Chopra, who has 170 runs at 42.5, come out firing on all cylinders against a bowling attack led by seamers Karen Polton (10 wickets) and Fitzpatrick (eight). 

Indian bowlers have so far displayed great discipline with Neetu David, Amita Sharma and Jhulan Goswami topping the bowling chart. 

Left-arm spinner David has 19 scalps to her credit at an outstanding average of 6.73. Sharma and Goswami have accounted for 13 and 12 wickets, respectively, with very impressive averages. Nooshin Al Khader has also chipped in with her off-breaks claiming 11 wickets at 18. 

The Australians, who will be playing in their seventh final, retained their unbeaten record in the tournament when they beat England by five wickets in the first semi-final Tuesday. 

Captain Belinda Clark and Fitzgerald, who have played in four World Cups each, would lend experience, would be keen to erase the memory of the final loss to New Zealand in the last edition in 2004. 

Odds were also stacked heavily in favour of the Australians who have won 17 of the 21 encounters between the two teams. 

Their match against India in the league phase had to be abandoned owing to heavy rain.

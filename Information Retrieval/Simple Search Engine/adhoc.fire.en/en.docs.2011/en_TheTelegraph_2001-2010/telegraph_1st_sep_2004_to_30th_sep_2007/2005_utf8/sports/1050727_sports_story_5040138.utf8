 Kumar may not make it despite win

New Delhi: Defending champion Alok Kumar was hoping against hope to stay in contention despite hammering Salman Haroon of Bangladesh in his last group A match in the Asian Snooker Championship in Bangkok on Tuesday. 

Despite blanking his opponent 4-0 (93-1, 69-30, 102-0 and 57-44), Kumar was virtually out of the running for a place in the pre-quarter finals after suffering his second consecutive defeat earlier in the day. 

Ending his campaign with a 3-2 win-loss record, Kumar only has a mathematical chance to advance, and to make it happen, his main opponent has to suffer heavy defeats in all the remaining matches. 

Former world champion Pankanj Advani, meanwhile, kept his chances alive with two crucial wins in group B. After beating Hung Hung Chung-ming of Chinese Taipei, Advani won 4-0 against Ieng San Fat of Macau winning 68-44, 69-13, 67-1 and 68-29. 

The third Indian in the fray, Manan Chandra, went down tamely to fifth seed Kobkit Palajin of Thailand in group E. Chandra failed to put up a fight against the Asian under-21 runner-up, losing 36-74, 25-90, 49-60, 23-73. 

Earlier, top-seeded Kumar lost his fourth match to Mohammed Sultan al-Joker of the UAE, the 16th seed, 56-69, 79-24, 0-78, 61-33, 37-51, 51-59. 

Second seed Advani came good in a must-win situation against Chung-ming 103-32, 26-57, 109-24, 67-10, 34-68, 52-69, 72-5. The Indian had two superb century breaks in the first and the third frames apart from registering scores of 80, 71 and 58 in the first, third and seventh frames, respectively.

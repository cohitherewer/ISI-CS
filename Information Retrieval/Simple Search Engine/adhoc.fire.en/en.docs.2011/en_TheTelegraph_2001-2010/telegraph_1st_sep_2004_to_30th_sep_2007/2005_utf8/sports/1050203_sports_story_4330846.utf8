The Telegraph - Calcutta

 JCT, Vasco draw 0-0

 - National League 

 Sandip Nandy has been impressive for Mahindra 

Ludhiana: JCT Mills Phagwara and Vasco Sports Club of Goa played out a barren draw in a fifth round match of the National Football League here on Wednesday. 

In a dull match at the Guru Nanak Stadium here, both teams adopted a cautious approach and hence failed to make most of their chances. 

Both JCT and Vasco now have seven points each after this outing. 

JCT will play their next match against defending champions East Bengal in Calcutta on Sunday, while Vasco next meet Mahindra United at home on Monday. 

Meanwhile, a tussle for supremacy is on the cards when Mahindra United take on Goan outfit Salgaocar Sports Club in the ninth National Football League for ONGC Cup at the Cooperage here on Thursday, adds another report from Mumbai. 

Mahindra United, who started off the season with mixed luck ? drawing their opener against Goa?s Churchill Brothers, upsetting Calcutta giants Mohun Bagan and losing to Goan outfit Dempo ? will have to pull up their socks and play really well to get full points against Salgaocar. 

Goalkeeper Sandip Nandy has impressed in earlier matches for the hosts and will be first choice, while their defence will be manned by Surkumar Singh, Arun Malhotra, Covan Lawrence and Debabrata Roy. 

In the midfield they have Steven Dias, Jatin Bisht, skipper S. Venkatesh and Abhishek Yadav, while their forward line consists of the two Brazilians, Flavio Rodrigues and Rodrigo de Almeida. 

On the bench they have Sunder Rajan, Jinto Jose, N.S. Manju, Rauf Khan, Hekmat Singh, Khalid Siddique and Koluthungan. 

Juje Siddi will be the first choice goalkeeper for Salgaocar while Remus Gomes, Roberto Fernandes and John Dias are the three defenders. Their midfield consists of Bello Rasaq, Jerose Oliveira, Rocus Lamare and Micky Fernandes. 

In the forward line they have Francis Andrade, Jyothi Kumar and Felix Ibrebru while Milagrio Medeira, Prashant Jaggi, Amandeep Singh, Pawan Kumar, Ragui Singh, Bhuvan Joshi and Samson Singh will be on the bench.

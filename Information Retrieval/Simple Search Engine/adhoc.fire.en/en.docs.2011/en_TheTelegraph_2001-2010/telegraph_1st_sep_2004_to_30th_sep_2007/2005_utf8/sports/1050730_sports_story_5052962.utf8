The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Focus on coach Chappell as Dravids test begins today

 - Kumble left out - Yadav set for comeback - Laxman favoured to open

Dambulla: For once, India take to a tournament with much of the glare on the coach, not a star-rated batsman. This can only help Rahul Dravid as the potentially defining 2005-06 season gets underway on Saturday. 

The glare is also on somebody who isnt here: Sourav Ganguly. The former captain, eligible from the tri-series third league match, reaches Sri Lanka on Sunday. 

Its the start of a new innings, but there arent any knots in the stomach... Having said that, I do want the first match quickly out of the way, Chappell told The Telegraph. 

Dravid, on the other hand, spoke of challenges. First, not allowing wily Muttiah Muralidharan to dominate and, then, beating the hosts. 

Sri Lanka have a good record at home, but history is best forgotten, he insisted. 

Thats a reasonable take, but Dravid must also be aware his captaincy is under scrutiny. Hes not exactly filling-in for Sourav and excellent marks may facilitate a longer tenure. 

At stake, then, isnt just the IndianOil Cup. 

The Sourav-factor isnt omnipresent. Still, Dravid maintained the focus was on the back-to-back ODIs ? Sundays face-off is with the West Indies ? not on any selection problem once his predecessor lands. 

We can worry about the rest when we get to that stage... Right now, the back-to-back ODIs matter most, he declared. 

Asked whether he felt much was always expected of him, Dravid replied: Right through my nine years, Ive never felt Ive had to play a lone hand... Ive played with greats and, even now, Im confident somebody or the other will put his hand up... 

Indeed. The three-and-half months lay-off is a thing of the past and its time to be counted. 

Sadly, owing to a horses for courses policy, the teams senior-most pro, Anil Kumble, has been counted out of the season-launcher ? he isnt in the XIII shortlisted late on Friday. 

 Similarly placed is Lakshmipathy Balaji, who may drown his disappointment with more pool at the idyllic team hotel here. 

One learns that though both rookies, Suresh Raina and Yalaka Venugopal Rao have made the cut, they have to wait for cap No.1. Its going to be a big match where experience is bound to be more handy. 

Unless theres a rethink and Mahendra Singh Dhoni gets promoted, Virender Sehwag will open with V.V.S. Laxman. That this could happen was reported in these columns the very day the squad was picked. 

Allrounder Jai Prakash Yadav, whose last ODI appearance was almost three years ago, is making a comeback. 

The Sri Lankans have been hit hard by injuries, with Chaminda Vaas and Nuwan Zoysa not available. However, as captain Maravan Atapattu pointed out, opportunities have been created for those who wouldnt otherwise have played. 

It couldnt be confirmed, but it appears allrounder Dilhara Lokuhettige is being capped. There was talk of blooding opener Upul Tharanga as well, but it seems the captain is himself going to open with veteran Sanath Jayasuriya. 

Significantly, at an interaction with the Media, Atapattu didnt agree his team starts as the favourite. Not that he strongly disagreed, though. 

The hosts havent featured in ODIs for quite a while, but theyre coming off a successful Test series against the West Indies. As an Ian Chappell would say, Test cricket prepares you for everything... 

The Indians, of course, need to erase ? to the extent possible ? memories of ending last season with four ODI defeats in succession. Worse, they were at the hands of Pakistan. 

LIKELY TEAMS 

INDIA: Virender Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Rahul Dravid, Mohammed Kaif, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Jai Prakash Yadav, Harbhajan Singh, Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra.

No restrictions 

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket chief executive Duleep Mendis has announced the Indians wont have to de-register anybody once Sourav arrives: There are no restrictions and theres no controversy.

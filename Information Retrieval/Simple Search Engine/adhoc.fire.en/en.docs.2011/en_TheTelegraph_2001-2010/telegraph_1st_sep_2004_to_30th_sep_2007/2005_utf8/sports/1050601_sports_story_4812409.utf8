 Atapattu hopes to topple Aussies

 - Moodys presence will make Lanka stronger: Vaas 

 Atapattu feels with Moody, Lanka will be more consistent 

Colombo: Sri Lanka could pose a major threat to world champions Australias supremacy in international cricket after picking Tom Moody as their new national coach, says skipper Marvan Atapattu. 

Sri Lanka are second behind Australia in one-day rankings, but Atapattu hopes his team will now be able to threaten the leaders position and put up a strong performance in the 2007 World Cup under their new Australian coach. 

We are now No. 2 on the ICCs (International Cricket Council) ODI rankings. We need to go one notch up to get to the pinnacle and hope well be able to achieve that with the new coach, Atapattu said Tuesday. 

He (Moody) has been part of a great team and has been highly regarded as a coach. I hope with his fresh ideas well be able to achieve a higher level of consistency. 

The 39-year-old Moody, who played significant roles as an allrounder in Australias World Cup triumphs in 1987 and 1999, was named Sri Lankas new coach last week. 

Moody immediately set his sights on the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, saying his aim would be to make Sri Lanka more competitive, especially away from home. Our main focus obviously will be on the World Cup, Moody said last week. 

Id like to think that the journey between now and 2007 is a process towards a successful campaign in the West Indies. 

We as a team should achieve one of the top three positions in Test standings and in order to get there we need to improve on our form at home and away. That will be one of my main areas of concern, Moody had said. 

Moody, who played eight Tests and 76 one-dayers, will arrive here next month to prepare Sri Lanka for two home Test matches against the West Indies in July and then a triangular one-day series also featuring India. 

Top fast bowler Chaminda Vaas echoed his captains sentiments, saying Moodys presence will make the team stronger. 

I appreciate his desire to succeed, said Vaas. 

Hes very young and aware of the requirements of the modern game. He knows how to get the best out of players. Im sure hell enjoy his stint with the Sri Lankan players who will benefit from him a lot. 

What I like most about him is his preparation ahead of a game. Ive been part of the Worcestershire dressing-room for a couple of months and I feel he is a coach with a difference who will have an impact on the Sri Lankan side. 

Vaas is currently playing county cricket for Worcestershire where Moody is a Director of Cricket, but with a get away clause which will make him free to take on the new job. 

Moody was also in the running to coach India before losing out to compatriot Greg Chappell. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mums the word between Beckham, 

 Ferguson

 - England captain believes Keane will move on quickly

 (Top) Ferguson and

 David Beckham is not sure whether 

 he or Roy Keane can claim to have made the more stormy departure 

 from Manchester United, but more than two years after his 

 own exit, the England captain has revealed that he has not 

 spoken to Sir Alex Ferguson since the day he left for Real 

 Madrid.

 It is a regret for Beckham, who 

 has always spoken respectfully of the man who guided his 

 career for a decade at Old Trafford, but Ferguson is barely 

 willing even to acknowledge the former United midfield players 

 contribution. His name is on the list of taboo subjects 

 at Fergusons press conferences, as is Rock Of Gibraltar, 

 the racehorse, or the reasons for offloading Jaap Stam and 

 Keane.

 Beckham believes that Keane, his 

 former teammate, will move on quickly and maybe that 

 is the best way, but the Irishman at least has been 

 offered a testimonial, when he can bid a proper farewell. 

 Beckham cannot help wishing that he had had a chance to 

 say goodbye to the manager and fans who cheered him to the 

 European Cup, two FA Cups and six championships.

 Maybe United think thats 

 the best way to do it, out before you know it, Beckham 

 said. Im not sure that I agree. I remember saying 

 after I left that I would love to say goodbye and thank 

 the manager and at least get a handshake.

 People criticised me for 

 that, saying Get on with it, its football and 

 thats how it is, but I had lived half my life 

 there and I never said goodbye. I have never been back to 

 play there with Madrid or for a United match. It is not 

 easy because I live in Spain now, but I would love to go 

 back and see people.

 Dropped for important matches 

 against Arsenal and Real in his final weeks at Old Trafford 

 ? and cut above an eye when Ferguson kicked a stray boot 

 in the dressing-room in his last, title-winning season ? 

 Beckham still appears a little stunned by the way that United 

 sold him.

 There have been a few dramatic 

 exits from Old Trafford, he said. Mine came 

 as more of a surprise to me than anyone else. Roy Keanes 

 was a shock, too, but I hope he is remembered for the 12 

 years and the trophies and not his departure. He has had 

 one of the most successful careers of any United captain 

 ever. The fans loved the way he led the team, the way he 

 spoke his mind. It was an honour to be in the same side.

 Beckham failed to win a trophy 

 in his first two seasons at Real but, settled with his family 

 in the Spanish capital, he will shortly open talks on a 

 new contract. His advisers have denied some of the more 

 outlandish estimates of his likely wage demands, but they 

 do know that they can drive a hard bargain.

 His popularity with the supporters 

 is high and he has a greater global impact than any of his 

 teammates ? he makes far more money for the club than his 

 wages of about ? 100,000 a week. At 29, Beckham knows that 

 extending his deal in Madrid will almost certainly rule 

 out a move elsewhere.

 You never know what can 

 happen, but I cant see myself moving back to the Premiership 

 or any other club, he said. I am happy here 

 and I am passionate about winning something with Real. It 

 has been a great experience already and a trophy would make 

 it even more fantastic.

Estoril: World No.1 Roger Federer and Britains double Olympics gold-medallist Kelly Holmes won the two top individual honours at Mondays annual Laureus World Sports Awards ceremony. 

Federer, who captured three Grand Slam tournaments in 2004, and Holmes, who won 800 and 1,500m gold in Athens Games, were joined on the winning podium by Euro 2004 soccer champions Greece and Chinese Olympics gold medal-winning hurdler Liu Xiang. 

There were also awards for Italian racing driver Alessandro Zanardi, Canadian Paralympics athlete Chantal Petitclerc and record-breaking British yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur. 

Greece won the team award, Liu Xiang the newcomer prize, and Zanardi, who lost both legs in a racing accident in 2001, but completed a full touring car season last year, took the Comeback of the Year award. 

Petitclerc, winner of five wheelchair gold medals in Athens last year, who lost both of her legs in an accident when she was 13, won the Disabled Sportspersons award. 

MacArthur took the alternative sportspersons award after breaking the world record for a round-the-world solo voyage. 

The Boston Red Sox, who last year won baseballs World Series for the first time in 86 years, received a special Spirit of Sport Award. 

A celebrity audience included the England soccer coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, his captain David Beckham, together with wife Victoria, Hollywood actresses Teri Hatcher and Joely Richardson and actor Cuba Gooding Jr. 

They rubbed shoulders with others such as tennis great German Boris Becker, Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting and former world drivers champion Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil. 

Federer pipped, among others, Lance Armstrong and Michael Schumacher to the World Sportsman of the Year title. 

He said: Now my main ambitions are to win the French Open for the first time and to stay as world No.1. 

Holmes, named World Sportswoman of the Year, picked up her 27th award since her double triumph at the Olympics last August. 

Fellow nominees had included Wimbledon tennis champion Maria Sharapova and top golfer Annika Sorenstam, 

 The awards are decided by the

 Mythical Star may strike again today 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Favourites have been playing a hide and seek game during the last few meetings. It may not, therefore, come as a surprise if the trend continues in successive fixtures beginning Wednesday.

 Three favourites, however, select themselves, again, in the seven-event card if their recent performance are taken into account. Trainers Daniel David?s Pacific Jewel and John Stephens? Mythical Star, both, were very facile winners and there is no reason to ignore them in their respective events ? the 2,000m Romantic Eve Handicap and the 1,600m Altimara Cup, the main event.

Bharath Singh?s Hoagy, too, is unlikely to disappoint 

in the 1,400m Twilight Lady Handicap. Although, the topweight may work against 

him, the Metal Precieux-Stardust Melody son being a better class horse may do 

the trick.

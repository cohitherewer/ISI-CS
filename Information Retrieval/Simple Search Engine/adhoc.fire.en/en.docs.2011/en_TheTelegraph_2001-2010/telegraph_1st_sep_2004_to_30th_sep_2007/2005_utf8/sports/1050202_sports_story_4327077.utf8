 Dugarry calls it a day

Paris: Former French international striker Christophe Dugarry has retired. 

Dugarry, who helped France win the World Cup seven years ago as well as the 2000 European title, is the eighth member from the 1998 generation to retire. 

Last month, midfielder Emmanuel Petit, who had been without a club since the start of the season, also quit. 

?I made up my mind about four or five days ago,? Dugarry, 32, was quoted as saying by sports daily L?Equipe. 

Dugarry made his international debut in a 1-0 victory over Australia 1994. (Reuters)

Bratislava: Three days of unrelenting drama ended in a blaze of red flares and glory when Mario Ancic beat Slovakias Michal Mertinak 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 to claim a 3-2 victory for Croatia in the Davis Cup final on Sunday (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

The 21-year-old sealed victory on his second match-point and was promptly mobbed by his ecstatic teammates, including former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic and Ivan Ljubicic, the player who took them to the final virtually single-handed. 

With hundreds of celebrating fans going berserk in the Sibamac Arena, Croatia captain Niki Pilic paid tribute to his team which became the first unseeded nation to win the trophy. 

The Davis Cup is one of the greatest competitions in the world and Im so proud that my team is number one in 2005, said Pilic, who is the first captain to win the title with two different nations, having triumphed three times with Germany. 

There is no doubt this one is the sweetest. 

Just because some nations are bigger, it doesnt mean they are better than we are, he added. Whats important is the feeling that with my own people we won it and for us its an historic moment. 

Ancic, who like Pilic is a native of Split, chose the perfect time to win his first live singles rubber of the year, coming to the rescue after Slovakias Dominik Hrbaty had beaten Ljubicic in a five-set thriller to make it 2-2. 

Sadly for Ljubicic, who woke up with a stiff neck and was sick during his 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 4-6 defeat, fell one win short of matching John McEnroes 1982 feat of 12 straight victories in a Davis Cup year, although the teams debt to him is enormous. 

I took a chance, I decided to play, said the 26-year-old, who declared himself fit little more than an hour before he was due on court. Then after the second set I went to the toilet to throw up. 

Ljubicic looked shattered after his three-hour, 20-minute defeat by an inspired Hrbaty, but thanks to Ancic he could still celebrate the end of a stellar year. 

I think its a fantastic win, this will never be forgotten, it will be written in the books forever, he said. 

Ancic has lived in Ljubicics shadow during the run to the final, but emerged to outclass world No. 165 Mertinak, a 26-year-old better known for doubles. 

Mertinak was only named to play the fifth rubber 15 minutes before it begun, Slovakias captain Miloslav Mecir preferring him to the more experienced Karol Kucera. 

Kucera had only been called up for Fridays first singles against Ljubicic after Slovak No. 2 Karol Beck, who denied a doping rumour on Thursday, was ruled out with a bad knee. 

Mecir was gracious in defeat. 

The best team won but all my players were fantastic, he said, adding that choosing between Mertinak and Kucera had been a tough call. 

The atmosphere for the decisive rubber was electric, but nothing like as highly-charged as for Sundays pulsating first singles. 

Hrbaty had lost all five meetings with Ljubicic, but as he had done against Ancic on Friday to level the tie at 1-1, he produced tennis of the highest quality. 

In terms of mental pressure it was the most difficult match of my career, said the 27-year-old who threw all his rackets into the crowd after clawing Slovakia level. 

He was outgunned early on, Ljubicic pumelling seven aces and countless searing winners to take the opener in 34 minutes. 

Hrbaty launched a stunning counter-attack, however, that rocked an increasingly weary-looking Ljubicic back on his heels. 

Hrbaty broke Ljubicics mighty serve for the first time in the second game of the second set, then broke twice in the third set as the momentum shifted completely his way. 

Ljubicic clawed one break back but Hrbaty hung on grimly to move two sets to one in front. 

Ljubicic dug deep in a fourth set, then pounced for a decisive service break as Hrbaty went 0-40 down at 3-4. He closed out the set in ruthless fashion. 

Hrbaty had the advantage of serving first in the fifth, forcing his opponent to serve to stay in the match at 4-5. 

With the noise deafening, Ljubicic saved one match-point with a backhand winner and another with a big first serve. 

Hrbaty was relentless, however, and clinched victory when Ljubicic netted an attempted backhand pass. 

His efforts proved in vain, though, as Ancic made sure it was Croatia, who became the 12th nation to have its name engraved on the famous old trophy.

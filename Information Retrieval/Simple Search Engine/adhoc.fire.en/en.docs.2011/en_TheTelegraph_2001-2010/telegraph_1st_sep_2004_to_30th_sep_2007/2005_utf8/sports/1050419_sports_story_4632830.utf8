The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No takers for Team India bat

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: There were no takers for a bat autographed 

 by Team India members at an auction of cricket memorabilia 

 at a city hotel on Monday evening. 

 The auction, held in aid of needy groundsmen, coaches 

 and tsunami victims, and organised by city-based NGO Ushashi, 

 fetched just over Rs 5 lakh. Sourav Ganguly was present 

 at the function to hand over some of the memorabilia to 

 the winning bidders. 

A total of 17 items went under the hammer, including Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq?s gloves and flannels he wore during his 100th Test in Bangalore last month, Sourav?s gloves and an autographed bat and the ?300-club bat? signed by Inzamam and Virender Sehwag. 

 Inzamam was scheduled to be present at the auction 

 but could not make it following a change of plans.

 Lawsuits filed by fans

Washington: Three lawsuits have been filed by Formula One fans seething over the decision to stage the US Grand Prix with only six cars. A class-action lawsuit was filed in Indianapolis on behalf of Larry Bowers, who wants a refund for his five tickets and travel expenses from his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a newspaper reported. 

The suit, like two others filed on Monday in Marion Superior Court, holds Formula One, the sports governing body FIA and the Michelin tyre company responsible for not holding the type of event that was advertised. 

Meanwhile, Formula Ones governing body FIA has framed charges against the seven teams using Michelin tyres who refused to take part in Sundays Grand Prix .

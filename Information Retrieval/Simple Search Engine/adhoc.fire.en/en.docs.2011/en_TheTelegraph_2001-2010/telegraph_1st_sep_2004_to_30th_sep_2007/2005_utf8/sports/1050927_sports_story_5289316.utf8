 Inzy refuses to take part

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq on Monday refused to represent the ICC World XI in next months Super Test against Australia. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had given me an understanding that I would be in both the World XIs (ODI and Test). But till today, they have not conveyed to me my selection. I have already read my selection in the newspapers, an angry Inzamam said from Lahore. 

The ICC on Friday announced Inzamam as the replacement for Sachin Tendulkar for the Super Test to be played at Sydney from October 14. But two days before the official statement, the PCB announced that Inzamam had been selected in both the teams. 

The ICC named Chris Gayle and Rahul Dravid as the replacements for Sachin Tendulkar and Herschelle Gibbs, respectively in the one-dayers to be played on October 5, 7 and 9. 

I am not pleased at all with whatever has happened. Having played cricket with respect and distinction, I dont deserve this at the fag end of my career. 

I have not conveyed my decision to the cricket board and there is no need for this because they have not yet communicated to me about my selection, Inzamam said. 

He said that if he was not representing the World XI in the Test match, there was no question of him participating in the captains conference and the second ICC annual awards. 

I will not go to Australia for just one match. 

Inzamam said he had agreed to represent the Asian XI in the Afro-Asian series because he was given due respect. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Teams fitness level a concern for Das 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Immediately after taking charge as the Mohun Bagan, coach Jahar Das felt that the teams fitness level has decreased alarmingly since their season-opener ? against the arch rivals East Bengal in the CFL Premier Division in July. 

The teams fitness level is only 30 per cent? and its a concern, Jahar Das said on Wednesday. 

All Mohun Bagan players ? excepting Basudeb Mondal and Gley Yao Rodrigue ? attended the practice session under Das, which ran for two and a half hours at Salt Lakes Bidhannagar Municipality ground. both Basudeb and Rodrigue turned up at the practice ground. While Basudeb, who has been nursing a knee injury, concentrated only on jogging for few minutes, Rodrigue was not allowed to practise on grounds of indiscipline. 

Newly-appointed goalkeeper coach Pratap Ghosh was also present during the practice session. The physical trainer is yet to be named. 

Mohun Bagan are likely to ask for four footballers on lien from other clubs before the NFL gets underway. I will ask for four players ? one each in forward, midfield, defence and goal ? to strengthen the squad as a whole before the NFL, he said. 

The new coach has asked for a laptop to the club officials as he wants to do away with the old system explaining moves to the players on the blackboard. 

Das is also planning to bring a few juniors from the Mohun Bagan-SAIL Academy into the senior squad. As a coach of the academy, he has a fair idea about who is capable of what. I have a few players in mind, but I dont know how they will fare when pitted against the seasoned campaigners, Das said.

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil?s 1970 World Cup winning coach Mario Zagallo has been admitted to hospital suffering from nausea, vomiting and abdominal pains, a hospital spokesman said on Wednesday.

 The 74-year-old, who also led Brazil to fourth place in 1974 and second in 1998 and is currently technical director, has been kept at the Hospital Samaritano in Rio de Janeiro since Tuesday night. The spokesman said Zagallo would probably undergo a biopsy and added that his illness was not related to the irregular heart rhythm he has suffered in the past.

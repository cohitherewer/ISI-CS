The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SAI-IFA spat

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: SAI, Eastern Centre has demanded Rs 1 lakh from the IFA to host the national under-16 selection trials, informed IFA secretary Subrata Dutta on Tuesday. 

According to him, a letter was sent to SAI by AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco on January 24, seeking infrastructure support to conduct the trials, which started from Saturday at Salt Lake Central Park. 

While SAI had previously agreed to the proposal, two days prior to the scheduled start it went back on its words on the ground that AIFF owes Rs 10 lakh to SAI, despite the fact that the national camps should be allowed free of cost. 

IFA was forced to make alternative arrangements. Following Tuesday?s letter from SAI, Dutta is now planing to send a report to the Union sports ministry and has ruled out further negotiations with SAI.

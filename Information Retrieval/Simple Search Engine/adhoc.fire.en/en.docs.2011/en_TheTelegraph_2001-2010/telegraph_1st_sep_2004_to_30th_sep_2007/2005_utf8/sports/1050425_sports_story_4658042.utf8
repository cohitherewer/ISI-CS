The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan vent ire at ref after defeat

A STAFF REPORTER

 Alvito D?Cunha was named Man of the Match 

Calcutta: So infuriated was Amal Dutta, he didn?t turn up at the mandatory press conference after Mohun Bagan?s 0-1 loss in the NFL match to East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium. Instead, the coach sent word through team manager S. K. Mukherjee that neither he nor his assistant Satyajit Chatterjee will meet the press as a mark of protest against biased refereeing. 

Goa?s Benjamin Silva did have a bad day in office ? ignoring genuine penalty appeals, flashing the yellow card when a red was due and often blowing the whistle the other way. The Mohun Bagan camp feels they were the most affected party. 

?We were denied at least two penalties? why was this Goan referee posted for this match? He denied us a penalty against Mahindra United too,? said a club official. He added a letter of protest would be sent to the AIFF, their tenth such correspondence in the ongoing NFL. 

East Bengal skipper Alvito D?Cunha, who walked away with the Man-of-the-Match trophy, did talk of the refereeing without being half as blunt as the rival camp. 

?There were some incorrect decisions made in today?s game? but, after all, the we must bear in mind the referee is a human being and like all of us, he can make mistakes,? said D?Cunha. His coach Subhas Bhowmick stayed away from the press conference because, as the team manager said, ?he was feeling very sick after the match.? 

D?Cunha, who set up the matchwinner for Syed Rahim Nabi, was ?very happy? with his performance. ?But the most important thing is victory for the team. That was achieved which makes me even more satisfied.? 

He paid the Mohun Bagan defenders a handsome compliment. ?We played against the toughest defenders in the country, (Ajibade) Babalade and Du (Eduardo Coelho). It was a very tough match for us. All the boys had to play their hearts out to pull off this win?, said D?Cunha. 

 The skilful midfielder admitted that Sunday?s result 

 would serve as a great morale-booster in the four matches 

 ahead. ?We?ll take each of those games one at a time, but 

 today?s win will surely help boost our confidence,? said 

 D?Cunha.

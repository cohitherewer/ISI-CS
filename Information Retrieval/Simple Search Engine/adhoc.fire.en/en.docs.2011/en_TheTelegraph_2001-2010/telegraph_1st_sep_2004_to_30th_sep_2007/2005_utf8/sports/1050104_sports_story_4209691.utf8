 South Africa make early inroads

 - THIRD TEST 

- Strauss reaches 1,000 runs in just 10 Tests 

 Jacques Kallis hooks one en route to his epic 149 in Cape Town on Monday 

Cape Town: Jacques Kallis scored his 19th century to inspire South Africa?s bowlers on the second day of the third Test against England in Cape Town on Monday. 

Kallis scored 149 in South Africa?s 441, their highest first innings total of the series so far. Makhaya Ntini then took two wickets as England slumped to 95 for four at stumps. Graham Thorpe was six not out with nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard yet to score. 

Kallis batted for more than eight hours, facing 334 balls and hitting 11 fours. Fast bowler Andrew Flintoff took four for 79 for England. 

Andrew Strauss scored 45 in England?s reply to reach the 1,000-run milestone in only his 10th Test match. 

South Africa resumed on 247 for four, and were immediately put under pressure by accurate, probing spells from fast bowlers Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard. 

England failed to take another wicket until four overs before tea as Kallis and Nicky Boje (76) set about building their eighth-wicket partnership of 104. 

Meanwhile, South African Charl Langeveldt took to the field with a fractured left hand after being struck by Flintoff while batting. 

Vaughan missed the first 45 minutes of the day?s play after being struck on the right hand by fast bowler James Anderson while batting in the nets. 

Vaughan was taken to hospital for a precautionary X-ray, which revealed bruising but no fracture.

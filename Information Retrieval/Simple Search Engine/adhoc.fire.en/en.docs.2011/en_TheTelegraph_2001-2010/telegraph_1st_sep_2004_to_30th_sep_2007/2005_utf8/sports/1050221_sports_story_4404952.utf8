 New Delhi: Harsh Mankad boosted his confidence ahead of the Davis Cup tie next month by winning the doubles title in the third leg of the ITF satellite men?s event in Great Britain this week.

 Second seeds Mankad and Eric Butorac of the US beat Flavio Cipolla and Alessandro Motti of Italy 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (10-8) to clinch the crown.

 In singles, however, Mankad went down to Britain?s Matthew Smith 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in the quarter finals 

 Brussels: Struggling FC Brussels sacked coach Emilio Ferrera on Saturday following their disappointing results this season.

 Ferrera has been replaced on a temporary basis by the Belgian first division club?s sports manager Dimitri Mbuyu.

 In a statement, Brussels said the ?painful decision? had been taken to ?promote the good spirit within the club? and to help improve the side?s performance in the league. Brussels are bottom of the 18-team standings, with just 14 points after 22 games.

 Kuala Lumpur: Colin Montgomerie has confirmed he will contest the March 24-27 Indonesian Open in a move which could help him into the US Masters.

 Montgomerie has failed to qualify for the US Tour?s Players? Championship being held in the same week in Florida and victory in Indonesia could be the stepping stone for the Scot into the Masters.

 March 27 is the cut-off point for golfers in the top-50 on the world rankings and not otherwise exempt to gain entry into Augusta National. Montgomerie is ranked 69.

 Montgomerie, currently contesting the Nissan Open in Los Angeles, said: ?A win anywhere in the world is good but winning the first-ever European Tour event in Indonesia would be great and I am looking forward to playing in Jakarta.?

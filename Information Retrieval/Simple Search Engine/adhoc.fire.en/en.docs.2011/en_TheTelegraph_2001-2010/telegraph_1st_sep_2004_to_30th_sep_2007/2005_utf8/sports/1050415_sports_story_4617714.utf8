Wellington: New Zealand crushed Sri Lanka by an innings and 38 runs on Thursday to win the second and final Test at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. 

Stephen Fleming?s side wrapped up a comfortable victory with a day to spare to clinch the two-match series 1-0 after last week?s first Test in Napier ended in a draw. 

The Sri Lankans needed to make at least 311 to make the Black Caps bat a second time but could only manage 273 despite a defiant 73 from middle-order batsman Tillekeratne Dilshan. 

The visitors started the day one wicket down and were all out after tea to leave the hosts to celebrate their first win of a difficult summer that included a heavy series loss to the Australians. 

?This puts things a bit more into perspective,? Fleming said. ?We?ve hit the canvas a few times this summer but we knew we had one chance to show we do have a good side. 

?That was the goal of this series and it was rewarding... it?s also special for the young guys who?ve only experienced Test defeats.? 

Left-arm paceman James Franklin captured four wickets while part-time seamer Nathan Astle chipped in with three important dismissals and Chris Martin finished with seven victims for the match. 

Lou Vincent was the unanimous choice as Man of the Match after making a career-best 224, the seventh highest score by a New Zealander in a Test, to help his team amass a huge total of 522 got nine. 

Sri Lanka?s hopes of saving the match were dealt an early blow when they lost two vital wickets in Thursday?s morning session followed by another four between lunch and tea. 

Dilshan reached his half-century off 71 balls and blasted 10 boundaries and a six to get to 73 but ran out of patience and was bowled trying to whack Astle out of the ground. 

Astle also shattered Upul Chandana?s stumps for eight before Franklin finished off the match when Chaminda Vaas played on for 38.

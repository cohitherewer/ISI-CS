 Bhupathi in quarters, Paes out

 Bhupathi and Damm overcame Suk and Vizner 

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi advanced to the quarter finals while Leander Paes crashed out of the doubles competition in the second round at the $2.2million Montreal Masters in Canada. 

Bhupathi and his Czech Republic partner Martin Damm, seeded seventh, overcame an edgy encounter from Cyril Suk and Pavel Vizner 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) at the hard court event on Thursday. 

On the other hand, fifth seeds Paes and Serbias Nenad Zimonjic were unlucky to end on the wrong side of a nail-biting 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (3-7) scoreline against Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel. 

Both the seeded pairs had a bye in the first round. 

Bhupathi and Damm next face Zimbabwean duo Kevin Ullyett and Wayne Black, who were in rousing form against Franco-Spaniard combination Richard Gasquet and David Ferrer, winning 6-2, 6-3. 

In singles action, top-seeded Rafael Nadal of Spain moved into the quarter finals with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Sebastien Grosjean of France. 

The 19-year-old Nadal, winner of eight tournaments this season, is looking for his first career hardcourt victory and looked impressive against Grosjean. 

He lost the first game of the opening set and then trailed 15-40 in the second game but rallied to tie the match and wasnt in any real difficulty after that. 

Nadal will meet eighth-seeded Mariano Puerta of Argentina, who stopped Xavier Malisse of Belgium 6-2, 6-4. 

Fourth-seeded Andre Agassi also moved into the final eight on Thursday night, knocking off Germanys Nicolas Kiefer 6-4, 6-2. 

Agassi will face sixth-seeded Gaston Gaudio of Argentina, who overcame 11th-seeded Tommy Robredo of Spain 6-3, 7-6 (6-0) in another match Thursday night. (PTI)

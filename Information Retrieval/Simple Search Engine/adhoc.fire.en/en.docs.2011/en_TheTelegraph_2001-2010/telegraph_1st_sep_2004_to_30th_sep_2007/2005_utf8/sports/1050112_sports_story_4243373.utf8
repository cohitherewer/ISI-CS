Calcutta: Yet another East Bengal-Mohun Bagan soccer tie and yet another dose of hackneyed sentiments. ?Matter of mind over substance?, of ?followers over strategy?, of ?the days? quota of fighting spirit?. Basically, it boils down to the first National Football League (NFL) match of the season, Wednesday at the Salt Lake Stadium, and barely more than soccer skills and strategy. 

The coaches have sung different tunes, expectedly. Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya talks of ?I must give my supporters something, we must win, and we can think of the league later.? East Bengal chief Subhas Bhowmick speaks of ?no sentiments, just arithmetic.? 

Sounds serious enough. Add to that the fact that this match will be the inaugural match of the NFL, and that Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh is scheduled to inaugurate it, and that the proceeds from this match will go to the family of the late Cristiano de Lima Junior, and you get a pretty heady mix. 

On a softer note, Bhattacharya says it?s this match and that?s that. ?I will start thinking about the rest of the league later. I must give my supporters something to live by, to lift their spirits.? He said he believes he has the armoury to beat East Bengal. ?In the last three encounters we had come out stronger.? 

He also admits, though, that he will be missing striker Sunil Chhetri, who injured himself playing for his employers in the inter-bank meet at the SAI ground recently. ?He would have been an asset.? Of course, Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? has been a handful and more for teams and Bhattacharya tried to distance himself from claims that the team?s ?foreign policy?, so to say, drove its spirit. 

His counterpart Bhowmick says he prides himself in the club jersey, and that the club, holders for the last two years, has remained the team for quite some time. ?It?s the toughest competition, 22 matches and a long time to think,? said Bhowmick. ?If you talk about preparations, I won?t say I have tied it all down perfectly. But we are good enough.? 

He will miss Deepak Mondal and Subhas Chakraborty, both injured, and M. Suresh is injured but just might turn out. But Bhowmick is eager to have Bhaichung Bhutia back on the field. ?I?ll have him on. Won?t say which part of the match or in which position, but he will play tomorrow.? Good enough. He is a must. Especially when Mike Okoro isn?t there any more. 

The Brazilian Douglas da Silva factor adds mileage, as does Nigerian Earnest Chukwuma Jeremiah. But, admittedly, the Mohun Bagan midfield ?looks better.? 

The small change in scenario has been the unseasonal rains and the soggy ground. ?If it rains again Wednesday morning, it?s be a different story, so far, though, is so good. No problem,? said Bhattacharya. 

Yet, experience says, it?s a big setting for what is going to be anything but a thriller. Get ready for a lazy afternoon. 

Bagan coach Bhattacharya oversaw the practice of two Nigerians Tuesday ? defender Ajibade Babalade and striker Orahemo Onome. The squad split into teams and played a match, though not much was evident of the two. ?I will see them again, later, then decide,? said Bhattacharya. 

The two, of course, can?t take part in Wednesday?s match, there being not enough time for their signing, in case they are selected.

 Whatmore critical of Super Series selection

London: Bangladesh paceman Mashrafe Mortaza was unlucky to miss the probables cut for the Super Series against Australia later this year, coach Dav Whatmore said on Monday. 

Whatmore said the selection panel, headed by Sunil Gavaskar, missed an opportunity to help Bangladesh cricket by failing to pick a single player from the fledgling Test nation. 

?I was really hoping Mashrafe Mortaza might have been in that one-day group,? Whatmore said. ?I reckon he was a bit unlucky. I would have said (to the selectors) look mate, its your initial squad and this kid can play.? 

A select group of 39 were picked on Monday, including 21 players who have been shortlisted for both the one-off six-day Test and a three-match one-day series to be hosted by the worlds top-ranked team in October. 

The captains and vice-captains will be announced when the squads are reduced to 20 each in July. The following month, they will be trimmed to 14 players for the one-dayers and 13 for the Test. 

?It would have been a huge boost for him (Mortaza),? added Whatmore. 

?Hes coming from a team thats developing and it would be a huge shot in the arm for Bangladesh cricket generally and it would really help the whole country along.? 

The 21-year-old Mortaza, who has taken 43 wickets in 16 Tests and 19 wickets in 18 ODIs, said he would not have been out of place in the select group which includes players like Darren Gough, Shaun Pollock and Chaminda Vaas. 

?Of course, I would have been ready,? he said. ?I have already played 16 Tests, and I have played against every team except the West Indies.? 

On the upcoming series, Whatmore insisted the success of the Asian side is not simply a matter of results. 

?Success or otherwise is certainly not measured in the scoreline. It is measured in other areas; there will be objectives both for individuals and the team as well. 

?Essentially we want to show progress and push the opposition as hard as we can,? said Whatmore, who guided Sri Lanka to the 1996 World Cup. ?Playing on the fifth day of Test matches is very much an objective.? 

Bangladesh begin a two-Test series against England later this month before taking part in a tri-series with the hosts and Australia.

 AIFF no to Douglas replacement

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Friday rejected East Bengal?s plea seeking replacement for injured midfielder Douglas da Silva. 

There was, however, some consolation for the reigning National Football League champions after they were allowed Douglas? substitute for their Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Cup matches, scheduled to start next month. 

Goa?s Fransa Football Club had also sought a replacement for an injured foreigner, which too was turned down. 

The AIFF, meanwhile, announced the dates for players? transfer. The first phase will commence from June 1-20 and the second from October 15-30. 

The AIFF also decided to review the performance of referees and their assistants in the ongoing NFL. A three-day seminar will be held in Margao from Wednesday which will be attended by panel of referees, assistant referees and match commissioners. 

Experienced Fifa and AFC referee?s instructor Mohammed Naziri will conduct the seminar. 

The tenure of national coach Stephen Constantine was also discussed. It was decided that he would be allowed to continue till his contract runs out in June.

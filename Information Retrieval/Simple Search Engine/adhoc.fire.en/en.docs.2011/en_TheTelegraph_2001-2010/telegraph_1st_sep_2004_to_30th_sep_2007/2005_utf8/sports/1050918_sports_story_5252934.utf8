 Johannesburg: Former boxing champion Mzukisi Sikali was shot dead at his home in Uitenhage, apparently by robbers, a news agency reported on Saturday.

 Left-hander Sikali, 34, was one of South Africa?s leading boxers and had held titles in different divisions including light-flyweight, super-flyweight and flyweight. He was International Boxing Organisation flyweight champion until last March. 

 New York: American David Toms was released from a Pittsburgh hospital on Friday and said he will play in next week?s President?s Cup despite being forced out of the 84 Lumber Classic with chest pains and rapid heartbeat. Toms sent a scare through the golf world on Thursday when he was taken to hospital after suffering from what appeared to be a heart attack midway through his opening round at the Mystic Rock Golf Course in Farmington, Pennsylvania.

 Toms, ranked No. 11 in the world and an 11-time winner on the PGA Tour, was placed on a stretcher and transported to a local hospital as a precautionary measure before being airlifted to Pittsburgh?s UPMC-Presbyterian University Hospital where he was admitted in critical condition. He remained in hospital overnight and was released on Friday saying he was returning to the 84 Lumber tournament.

 Motegi (Japan): Valentino Rossis hopes of wrapping up his fifth consecutive world motorcycling title in Sundays Japan Grand Prix were complicated after he finished 11th quickest in qualifying on Saturday.

 The 26-year-old Italian will start from the fourth row in Motegi after clocking a fastest lap of 1:47.563 seconds to produce his poorest qualifying effort of the season. Ducatis Loris Capirossi was quickest in a lap record of 1:46.363 to claim his first pole position for more than two years with Suzuki rider John Hopkins second in 1:46.861. Italys Marco Melandri filled out the front row on his Honda.

 A 10th win of the year, or second place, would put runaway MotoGP leader Rossi alongside Giacomo Agostini and Mick Doohan as the only men to win the world title in the top class five times or more.

 London: Arsenal striker Thierry Henry is hoping that his lengthy enforced break to treat a persistent groin injury will see him return to top form with club and country.

 The French star said that he had been in pain each time he played at the end of last season and that his groin was so inflamed that some mornings he could hardly walk.

 Finally, he accepted that he would have to completely rest the injury for two weeks before beginning a rehabilitation period that his coach, Arsene Wenger, hopes will see him back in action in a further four weeks.

 London: England are poised to bid for the 2018 World Cup, the Football Association has said.

 FA chief executive Brian Barwick confirmed ?serious consideration? is being given to a bid for the 2018 World Cup. ?2018 is the first obvious opportunity for a European country to host the competition,? said Barwick. ?We are clearly giving some serious consideration to putting together a bid for the tournament.? The prospect of England hosting World Cup 2018 was recently welcomed by Fifa president Sepp Blatter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Juniors too had the chokers virus

Stickwork

 Indian probables at practice on Friday, 

 the second day of the Chandigarh preparatory camp 

 for the Rabo Cup the mini World Cup in 

 Amstelveen. (PTI) 

 I am writing this column with 

 mixed feelings. The Indian junior hockey players performed 

 reasonably well as a team at the just-concluded World Cup, 

 but the desired result did not come.

 I personally feel that the main 

 reason for this was the inability of the forward line to 

 interact between themselves and with the team in general. 

 Together, they should have scored more field goals. When 

 they failed to do that, pressure was relayed down the defence.

 At the same time, though, I have 

 learnt from the coach and from reports that the midfield 

 performed exceedingly well, the most promin- ent among them 

 being V.S. Vinay. Vivek Gupta and Vikram Kanth also performed 

 reasonably well.

 Tushar Khandekar (on the right) 

 in the forward line performed well, but the left flank failed. 

 The deep defence was found wanting 

 ? whether due to pressure from failures upfront or otherwise 

 ? and it was really unfortunate that goalkeeper Adrian DSouza 

 (declared one of the best in Asia just a few days back) 

 did not perform to his own standard. That should not have 

 been.

 Much was expected from William 

 Xalco and Sandeep Singh in the defence, but from all accounts 

 they too slipped. Sandeep, even today, will probably find 

 it difficult to get into any Indian senior team purely as 

 a defender. He has not earned his spurs on that sore. 

 Though it must be said in his 

 favour that he was one of the highest scorers in the meet 

 and took India to where they went.

 I can only hope that one day, 

 quite like Sohail Abbas, Sandeep too becomes a natural in 

 the team, and not just because of his drag-flicking abilities.

 Of course the old Indian malady 

 of not able to keep the lead has survived. Like against 

 Australia, we were 2-0 up, before conceding three in the 

 second. Choking at such crucial times and in such crucial 

 matches is dangerous. 

 This malady has to be addressed 

 not only at the senior level, but at the junior level too. 

 And to do that, a lot of character, determination and fighting 

 spirit in required, by each individual player as well as 

 the whole team. 

 Then, it was also sheer bad luck 

 that a crucial goal was nullified by the second umpire against 

 Spain in the bronze match. That decision went grossly against 

 us.

 In hindsight, I must say that 

 Indias decision to not include the juniors in the 

 Azlan Shah meet was right. Pakistan had their juniors in 

 the Azlan Shah, sent up for exposure, but they fared quite 

 badly in the junior World Cup.

 Summarising, except for the one 

 pool match in which India lost 0-4 to Spain, they were not 

 outplayed and the performance was reasonably good.

 I believe that some from these 

 junior 18, can walk into the Indian senior team. Of course, 

 come of them are already in the Indian team, like Sandeep 

 and Adrian. 

 I foresee eight-nine of the juniors 

 moving into the senior team in the near future.

 Moving over to the eight-nation 

 mini World Cup, so to say, or the Rabo Trophy in Amstelveen, 

 we will be missing only Argentina. The gathering is pretty 

 high class. 

 And India are in the tougher pool, 

 with Germany Pakistan and Spain. On the other side are Holland, 

 England, Korea and Australia.

 In the selection committee meeting 

 it was decided in principle to not disturb the junior boys 

 who had returned from the World Cup. This allows many of 

 the seniors to go for this meet. 

 Of course, two seniors return 

 (Gagan Ajit Singh and Kanwalpreet Singh) and the presence 

 of Arjun Halappa and Bimal Lakra makes the team look good. 

 This camp will be almost (with 

 a few exceptions) the Azlan Shah squad with the additions 

 of Gagan Ajit and Kanwalpreet.

 If Gagan Ajit can get back his 

 earlier form he can make a difference in the India team.

 Of course, the addition of the 

 juniors, who have performed well in the World Cup would 

 have strengthened the team a little, but they will certainly 

 be considered for the Champions Trophy. This Amstelveen 

 will be a good warm-up for that.

 The juniors will be training separately; 

 they wont be sitting idle in the off season.

 Len Ayappa was actually called 

 for the Patiala camp, but he did not turn up and sent word 

 that he was no more interested and would be playing in the 

 Malaysian league.

 This eight-nation meet could be 

 a life-death meet for India. A win will make them feel good, 

 but a big defeat could destroy the morale of the team before 

 the Champions Trophy. 

 To that end, the junior players 

 will come in as not only a breath of fresh air, but also 

 as a solid backup for change.

 It is a morale-backup that we 

 need, and one we can afford. Hence keeping the juniors out 

 of this was a good, tactical decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Central lead by 417 runs

New Delhi: Central Zone tightened the noose around Bangladesh by bowling out the visitors for 146 in the first innings and batting themselves to a position of strength on the third day of the Duleep Trophy match here today. 

Bangladesh, resuming at 117 for six, could add just 29 runs to their overnight score before being bowled out. 

Salabh Srivastava was instrumental in packing off the visitors, taking four for 33. 

Central then rode on Sanjay Bangar?s unbeaten 91 to reach 212 for six at stumps, taking their overall lead to 417. 

At close, Murali Kartik was giving company to Bangar on five. A five-wicket haul by medium pacer Aftab Ahmed (five for 28) was not enough to stop the hosts from taking a firm grip on the match. 

With a mammoth lead under their belt, Central would go for the killer punch on the final day. Central opener Amit Pagnis, quite like the first innings, did not last long as he lost his wicket after making 15 in 41 minutes. 

He added 21 with Bangar before Anwar Hussain dismissed him. Devendra Bundela (53) came up with his second fifty of the match, following his 83 in first innings, and was the dominant partner in the 76-run stand with Bangar.

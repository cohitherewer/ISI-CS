 Inzamam escapes ban

Melbourne: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has been cleared to play in Friday?s first game of the tri-series finals against Australia after escaping a suspension because of an administrative blunder by the ICC. 

Under ICC rules, Inzamam should have incurred an automatic ban after he was found guilty of time-wasting in Pakistan?s win over the West Indies in Perth on Tuesday. 

However, the Pakistan skipper was let off with a fine after Match Referee Chris Broad admitted to an error during the proceedings. 

?In applying the provisions of the ICC Code, I neglected to consult Inzamam?s past record,? Broad said in a statement. ?It was an honest mistake and the matter has been dealt with.? 

Inzamam was charged with a Level 2 offence for his team?s slow over-rates in the match with the West Indies but under ICC regulations the charge should have been upgraded because it was his second offence in 12 months. 

A Level 3 charge carries an automatic ban but the ICC said there would be no retrospective suspension because it was their mistake. 

?Under the provisions of the ICC Code, Inzamam?s penalty should have been upgraded to a Level 3 offence which carries an automatic ban as this was his second breach of this particular Level 2 provision in a 12-month period,? the statement said.

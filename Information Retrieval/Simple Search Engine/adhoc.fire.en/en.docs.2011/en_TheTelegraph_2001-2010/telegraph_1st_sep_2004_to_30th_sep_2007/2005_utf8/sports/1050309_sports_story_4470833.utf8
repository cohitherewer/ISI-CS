The Telegraph - Calcutta

 CAB mulls format change

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal?s dismal performance in the Ranji Trophy has prompted the CAB to review the structure of local cricket in the state. It won?t be a surprise if some radical changes are introduced from the season after next. 

The CAB top brass, at an informal meeting on Tuesday, discussed the idea of introducing an Elite Group of eight teams in the senior division league championship from the 2006-07 season. The other suggestion was to have the eight teams play three-dayers (instead of the existing two-dayers) among each other. 

Any proposed change in format can?t be applied next season as a one-year notice has to be given to the clubs. 

According to a source, the CAB will summon club representatives after the Eden Test (which ends on March 20) to discuss the proposals. If there is a favourable response, the working committee will have to ratify the decisions.

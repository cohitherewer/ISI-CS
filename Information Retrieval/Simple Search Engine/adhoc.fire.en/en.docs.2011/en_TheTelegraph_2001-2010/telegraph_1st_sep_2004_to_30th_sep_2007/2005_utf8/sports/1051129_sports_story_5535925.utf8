 5 Indians among top-50

 Jyoti Randhawa is third on the list 

Hong Kong: Ace golfer Jyoti Randhawa was at impressive third place as five Indians figured in the top-50 of the Asian Order of Merit with the battle for the list hotting up in time for the $1.2 million Hong Kong Open, the penultimate event of the season. 

The top-60 are eligible to compete in the season-ending $600,000 Volvo Masters of Asia in Thailand. Randhawa, who showed a welcome return to form with a tied seventh place finish despite a poor back nine on final day, is lying third with $255,315, while Shiv Kapur (17th), Jeev Milkha Singh (21st), Gaurav Ghei (31st) and Harmeet Kahlon (47th) form the other Indians in top-50. 

Others with a chance to make it to the top-60 with good finishes in Hong Kong are Amandeep Johl (64th) and Rahil Gangjee (69th). A top-10 placing in Hong Kong could do the trick for them. 

Meanwhile, it will be down to the wire for Thailands golf idols Thaworn Wiratchant and Thongchai Jaidee in the fight for the prestigious Asian Tour Order of Merit title. 

Thongchai reduced Thaworns lead at the top of the money ranking with a tied seventh finish at the Volvo China Open on Sunday, with current leader Thaworn settling for equal 24th place in Shenzhen. 

Thaworn, who has won a record four times this year, has accumulated a record haul of $496,745, and saw his lead trimmed to $78,970.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Dhoni was nearly orphaned

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Supreme Court-appointed observer, T.S. Krishnamurthys ruling upholding the Jharkhand State Cricket Associations affiliation to the Board has prevented Mahendra Singh Dhoni from landing in a peculiar situation. 

Had the former chief election commissioner ruled otherwise, Dhoni would have been orphaned. Indeed, his Test debut on Friday (Chepauk, against Sri Lanka) would then have been as the registered player of an association which didnt figure in the Board! 

Were happy with the turn of events... Dhoni has done us proud and were delighted that he will be realising his dream as a Jharkhand player, association supremo Amitabh Choudhary, manager on the recent controversial tour of Zimbabwe, told The Telegraph.

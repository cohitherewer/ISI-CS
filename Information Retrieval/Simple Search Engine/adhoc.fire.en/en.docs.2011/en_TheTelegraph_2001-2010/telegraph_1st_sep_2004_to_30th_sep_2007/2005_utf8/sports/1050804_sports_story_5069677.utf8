 Mickelson looks to 

regain touch

Toronto: Phil Mickelson will look to sharpen his competitive edge ahead of the years final major when he returns to action for the first time since the British Open this week at the International, in Castle Rock, Colorado. 

The 2004 Masters meet has undergone a form slump since May, with a tie for seventh place at the Wachovia championship being his only top-10 finish in his last six starts. 

He has also had uninspiring 33rd and 60th place finishes at the US and British Opens and must quickly rediscover his form at the Castle Rock Golf Club if he hopes to challenge Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh at the PGA championship next week. (Reuters)

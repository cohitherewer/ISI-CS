 Giving up not an option: Schumacher

London: Ferraris Michael Schumacher is looking forward to Sundays Monaco Grand Prix as much as ever, even if others have written off the Formula One champions chances already. 

I always enjoy coming here. Its just a lot of fun to wind your way through the streets, the German said on his website on Monday. 

Even though it will be difficult for us this time, because the position on the starting grid at Monaco is somewhat decisive for the outcome of the race, that does not diminish my excitement. 

We are looking forward to taking on this challenge. Giving up is not an option, but giving up before you try is completely out of the question, added Schumacher. This is sports and anything is possible. 

Schumacher has not won a race since the penultimate round of last season in Japan, the longest drought he has suffered since joining Ferrari in 1996. 

Ferrari, constructors champions for the past six years, won 15 of the 18 races last season but have gone without a victory for six races now. 

Renault, winners in Monaco last year, have won four out of five races with Spains Fernando Alonso leading the championship after three victories. 

Austrian Niki Lauda said at the weekend that Schumachers title hopes were over, with Alonso on 44 points and the German just 10. 

The rules call for that and we will naturally try to make the best of it, said Schumacher. We may be going through somewhat of a weak phase right now but thats the way it is in sports ? there are always ups and downs. 

We were doing extremely well for an unusually long period of time and now were having to struggle a little bit.

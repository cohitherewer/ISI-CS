 India ready for all conditions

 - Dravid amp; Co. in sri lanka with new challenge 

Colombo/Chennai: The Rahuhl Dravid-led Indian team arrived in Colombo Saturday to take part in a triangular one-day series against Sri Lanka and the West Indies. 

Dravid brings with him a new challenge, what with regular Team India skipper Sourav Gangulys (provisionally the 16th member) arrival unsure because of a ban, and with Sachin Tendulkars worrisome elbow keeping the star batsman out. But Dravid warned, before leaving from Chennai ? with a 35-minute delay, because the plane carrying vice-captain Virender Sehwag arrived late ? that his team had the resources and variety and was ready for different Lankan conditions. 

Also, if Dravid was worried in the absence of the stalwarts, he did not show it, harping on a positive fallout instead. 

Both Sourav and Sachin are experienced players, he said. It does give the opportunity to some of the other guys to shine and show that they can play at this level. There is a lot of quality in the batting in the top half through the youngsters there. The situation gives us an opportunity to try out a few young players. 

The absence of the stalwarts led to the induction of rookie batsmen Venugopal Rao and Suresh Raina in the 15. And medium pace-bowling all-rounder J. P. Yadav is back after a couple of years. 

The Indians travel to the Buddhist pilgrim city of Dambulla to play their first match, versus the hosts, Saturday, before travelling back to Colombo for the rest. 

The skipper believes the composition of the team gives us the option of playing whatever combination we like. We do have two specialist spinners in Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. 

If the conditions permit, we might play both of them, or it will be three medium pacers and a spinner, Dravid said. 

Coach Greg Chappell, on his first assignment with the team, said: The aim in the tri- series is to play consistent cricket. The players will have to do the basics day in day out. 

If they can do that, then the outcome will look after itself. Hopefully, with the talent that we have and if we do that, the outcome will be more consistently in our favour.

 Ballack keen to leave Bayern

Berlin: Germany captain Michael Ballack said on Sunday he would like to move from Bayern Munich to a foreign club one day although he is keeping his options open on a contract extension when it expires next year. 

There are hardly any (German) players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step, Ballack, 28, told a German newspaper. 

Its good for a persons overall development. It would also be very interesting for me. 

Spanish clubs, especially Barcelona, have pursued the midfielder in the past. 

Bayern Munich have said Ballack must make up his mind on a contract extension soon. However, Ballack said he was in no rush.

Madrid: Real Madrid moved top of the Primera Liga after goals from Robinho and Alvaro Mejia clinched a 2-0 win at struggling Real Betis on Saturday. 

Brazil forward Robinho, a $30 million close-season buy, scored in the 30th minute to settle Vanderlei Luxemburgos side, who had lost their previous two league games. Former youth team player Mejia made sure of the points with a second-half header. 

Betis continue to struggle and have now lost their last three league matches since a 4-0 mauling by Chelsea in the Champions League. 

Real are level on 18 points with Osasuna but Luxemburgos team have a superior goal difference. 

Third-placed Getafe, who have 17 points, travel to face Deportivo Coruna. Celta Vigo moved into fourth, also on 17 points, after drawing 1-1 at bottom club Athletic Bilbao. 

Champions Barcelona and Real Sociedad both have 16 points. Betis are stalled in 16th with nine points. 

Hosts Betis and Real fielded unfamiliar sides due to injuries and suspensions. 

Real were missing Brazilian pair Ronaldo and Julio Baptista, England midfielder David Beckham and France playmaker Zinedine Zidane through injury. 

Real took the lead with their first attempt at goal. Rauls square pass on the edge of the area found Robinho, with teammate Carlos Diogo stepping over the ball, and the Brazilian curled a low shot inside the post. Brazilian forward Edu headed against the post in the 77th minute but three minutes later the game was effectively sealed. 

Guti lifted a pass over the defence and Mejia, who had only been on the field a minute, headed past Toni Doblas. 

Meanwhile, AC Milan beat Juventus 3-1 on Saturday to end their record 100 per cent start to the season and move within two points of the Serie A leaders, add reports from Milan. Champions Juventus, who had won their opening nine games, were swept aside by an outstanding first-half performance from Milan who raced 3-0 up at the break with goals by Clarence Seedorf, Kaka and Andrea Pirlo.

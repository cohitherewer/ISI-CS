 Hinds steadies West Indies

Georgetown: Wavell Hinds smashed a half century to guide West Indies to 96 for two at lunch on the first day of the first Test against South Africa on Thursday. 

Hinds, batting on 54, shared an unbroken 72-run partnership with debutant Donavon Pagon (29 not out) after the hosts lost two wickets in the space of six balls. (Reuters)

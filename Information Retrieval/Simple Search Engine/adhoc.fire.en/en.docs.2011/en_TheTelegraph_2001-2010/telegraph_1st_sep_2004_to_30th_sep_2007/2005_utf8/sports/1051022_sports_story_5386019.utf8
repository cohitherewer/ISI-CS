Madrid: American Robby Ginepri produced an immaculate exhibition of controlled power tennis to see off Spains David Ferrer 6-1, 6-4 and earn himself a place in the Madrid Masters semi-finals on Friday. 

A highly focused Ginepri, who upset third seed Nikolay Davydenko in the third round, made an impressive start at the Madrid Arena, holding serve to love in the opening game and then breaking in the second. 

The 23-year-old 16th seed showed no signs of weakness on his own serve and always had Ferrer under pressure on his. 

He stretched the Spaniard around the court with his high velocity groundstrokes and broke again in the fourth on way to a 5-0 lead. 

Ginepri, who lost to Andre Agassi in five sets in the semi-final of this years US Open, then served out to take the set 6-1 after forcing Ferrer into a string of errors. 

Ferrer beat sixth seed Mariano Puerta on way to the quarters, but he was never given the chance to find the sort of rhythm that took him to a victory over the Argentine as Ginepri pinned him to the baseline and dominated at the net. 

Ginepri, who won his previous two meetings with Ferrer, broke again in the fifth game of the second set, kept the tempo high and weathered some late pressure from the Spaniard when he was serving for the match. 

On Thursday, world No. 2 Rafael Nadal brushed aside Tommy Robredo 6-2, 6-4 in an all-Spanish clash to march into the quarters. 

The 19-year-old top seed, who is bidding for his fourth Masters title of the year, put Robredo under pressure with his characteristic brand of high-energy tennis. 

Nadal will meet pugnacious Czech Radek Stepanek, who downed Argentine Jose Acasuso 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 to advance to the last eight for the fourth time in a month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Solkars talent was never appreciated

 Guest Column 

 Erapalli Prasanna

 Eknath Solkars death is 

 a great loss for Indian cricket, and with his sad demise 

 we have lost the best talent in close-in fielding. Its 

 a tragedy that he died without being roped in to train our 

 Test cricketers (now playing for India). His talent was 

 never appreciated and he passed away while in a financial 

 crisis.

 Eknath was the best close-in fielder 

 I have ever seen. I watched him field and dive forward like 

 a swimmer even in his younger days at the B J Hindu Gymkhana 

 in Bombay where the conditions were not conducive for diving. 

 Later on, he proved to be a fearless allrounder and gave 

 us spinners the opportunity to have a go at the batsmen 

 by merely flighting the ball. 

 For bowlers like Bishan (Bedi) 

 and me, his presence at the close meant additional pressure 

 on the batsmen. Every batsman had to play with extra care 

 as Eknath would be waiting to scoop up the ball. His best 

 catch was of Alan Knott at the forward short-leg off Venkat 

 at The Oval during that historic win (in 1971).

 I dont remember him taking 

 evasive action at all nor for that matter getting hit by 

 a batsman. He was not afraid of fielding close to the batsmen 

 because he had this extraordinary anticipation of catches 

 at the forward short-leg position and could sense when a 

 batsman even offered a half chance that he could turn into 

 a catch.

 I once asked him about protective 

 gear and he said he wore the box only because he saw others 

 use it. This is in contrast with the present-day cricketers 

 who wear every protective gear but continue to duck when 

 they see a batsman play the sweep shot.

 As an allrounder, he was ready 

 to open the bowling and bowl spin or bat at any number. 

 He was a source of trouble for Geoffrey Boycott and Rodney 

 Marsh with his left-arm bowling. As a batsman he got a hundred 

 against Clive Lloyds team in the Bombay Test in 1974-75.

 Off the field, he was a teammate 

 full of confidence and one who looked out for opportunities. 

 He had a communication problem in that he could speak fluent 

 Hindi and Marathi but only some English. He used to make 

 an effort to talk to us in English and make known his opinion 

 on and off the field.

 We were close friends and our 

 families kept in touch. We used to visit Solkar and his 

 wife whenever we went to Mumbai. It is unfortunate that 

 we let him pass away without taking his services to improve 

 our fielding.

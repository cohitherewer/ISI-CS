 Lampard admits being in love with Barcelona

 - If I had to pay and watch someone, itd be Ronaldinho

 Lampard feels Barcelona will retain Spanish league title 

Frank Lampard has reaffirmed how happy he is at Chelsea, but admitted to being in love with Barcelona ? the city, the football team ... and with watching Ronaldinho. The England midfield player paid tribute to the man tipped to beat him to the World Fifa Player of the Year award this month when he spoke to a Spanish football magazine. 

If I had to choose one player to pay to watch, it would be Ronaldinho, Lampard said. All the success that Barcelona have at the moment began the moment he turned up. He enjoys playing so much and it is a pleasure to watch him. 

On the prospect of appearing alongside the Brazil playmaker at the Nou Camp, Lampard conceded that because of personal loyalties ? his girlfriend, Elen Rives, is from Barcelona ? it was far more likely than him lining up in the same team as David Beckham at the Bernabeu despite topping a Real Madrid poll that asked supporters who they wanted the club to sign in the summer. 

He said: I was joking when I said that my girlfriend would kill me if I went to Madrid, but there is some truth in it. She would support me whatever I did but she is a massive Barca fan and her whole family are Barca so you can imagine how difficult it would be for me if I signed for Real Madrid. 

I watch Spanish football regularly so does John Terry and Joe Cole. We mainly watch Barcelona and Madrid. I love the way Barca play football ? I think that they will win the league again. 

Lampard, who is learning Spanish and is looking for a house in Barcelona, added: I love the city. I have been a few times and I have fallen in love with the place. Elen goes to Spain more than me but I go with her when I can. 

It seems he would have little trouble adapting to life in Spain and comments last week attributed to a member of the clubs board of directors suggested that the Catalans would welcome him with open arms. But he admitted three things could stand in his way ? his age, his coach and the man who pays his wages. Roman Abramovich, Chelseas owner, has made a huge impression on Lampard. 

The best thing about Roman Abramovich is that he has caused such a big change at the club and he hasnt done it from a distance, Lampard said. He comes down to the dressing-room after games. He is in Chelsea Village even when it is freezing cold and raining. He adores football and lives for Chelsea. 

And his acquisition of Jose Mourinho has finally brought success to the club and to Lampard. As the Premierships equal top scorer he has been transformed by the Portuguese who recently described his midfield player as currently the best in the world. THE TIMES, LONDON

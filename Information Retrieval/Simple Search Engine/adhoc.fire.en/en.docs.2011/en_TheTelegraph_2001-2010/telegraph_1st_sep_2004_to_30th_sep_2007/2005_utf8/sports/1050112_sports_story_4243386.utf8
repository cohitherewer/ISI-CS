 Hayden to skip first two ODIs

Melbourne: Matthew Hayden will be rested for Australia?s first two matches in the triangular one-day series against the West Indies and Pakistan, selectors said Tuesday. 

The decision was made by the selectors in conjunction with Australian team management and Cricket Australia (CA) general manager of cricket operations, Michael Brown, a CA statement said. 

?This short lay-off should help Matthew,? said chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns.

 Kerala storm into semis 

Kochi: Defending champions Kerala stormed into the semi-finals with an all win record in the three-team quarter final league of the Air India Express Santosh Trophy on Wednesday. 

In their last match, the hosts, who needed a draw to qualify, crushed Delhi 3-0 in a one-sided affair. 

Medio Ajayan drew the first blood for Kerala in the 43rd minute, striker Abdul Hakkim increased it in the 53rd minute, and Pradeep completed the tally in the 67th. 

Delhi bowed out losing both matches. Kerala dominated the first session with Delhi failing to have a clear look at rival goalmouth. (PTI)

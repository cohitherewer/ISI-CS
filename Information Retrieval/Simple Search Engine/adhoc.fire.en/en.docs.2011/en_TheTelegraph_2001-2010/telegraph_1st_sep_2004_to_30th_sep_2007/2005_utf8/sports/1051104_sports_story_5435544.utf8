 Vijay set to lift two trophies 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainers Vijay Singh and Richard Alford are expected to be the frontline players in Fridays race card. However, the absence of the MAM Ramaswamys colour bearers will be strongly felt during the afternoon. 

 The racing baron has reason to be upset following the suspension of his three riders on filmsy grounds. He has just a token representation in the six events.

 Vijay, therefore, will be in a position to call the shots in the days major events ? the 1,400m Hilliard Cup and the Legal Steps Cup over 1,200 metres ? through the Classic filly Romantic Liaison and the brilliant sprinter Serrafina. Vijays another ward, Magical Romance, too, is expected make a winning debut.

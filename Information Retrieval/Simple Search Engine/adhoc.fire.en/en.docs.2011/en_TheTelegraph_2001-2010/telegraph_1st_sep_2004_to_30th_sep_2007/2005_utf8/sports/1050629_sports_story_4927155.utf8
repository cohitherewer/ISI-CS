The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 SA wont pitch for Zimbabwe ban

Durban: South Africa would not support calls for a boycott of Zimbabwe, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Tuesday. 

We view tours to and from Zimbabwe as cricketing matters, and we will continue to meet our obligations to the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) in this regard, a CSA release quoted chief executive Gerald Majola as saying. 

Majola was reacting to reports that the New Zealand government planned to ask the ICC to suspend the ZCU because of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. 

Meanwhile, Australia said it was holding emergency talks with its cricket board, Cricket Australia, based on which it will decide whether to join the British and the New Zealanders to lobby the ICC for boycotting Zimababwe, adds another report from Sydney. (AGENCIES)

On Thursday, the club?s secretary Anjan Mitra, sans power, had talked of a long discussion with Bhaichung Bhutia. A day later, there is talk of Jose Ramirez Barreto?s possible return to the club, a possibility mentioned after nearly a year of an acrimonious exit, and has even said that club president Swapan Sadhan Bose is actively trying to bring back the Brazilian.

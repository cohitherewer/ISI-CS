 - CONFEDERATIONS CUP

Frankfurt: Host nation Germany survived a bout of first-night nerves to beat Australia 4-3 in a frantic Confederations Cup match in Group A on Wednesday. 

Germany led twice in the first half with opportunist goals from Kevin Kuranyi and Per Mertesacker but amateurish defending allowed Australia to equalise through a Josip Skoko free-kick and a fine finish from John Aloisi. 

Michael Ballack converted a 60th minute penalty to restore the lead and Germanys captain set up 20-year-old forward Lukas Podolski to give them some breathing space in the 88th minute. 

There was still time for Aloisi to score his second of the night but Germany came through a nervous last few seconds to go top of the group after Argentina had earlier beat Tunisia 2-1 in the tournaments opening game. 

We didnt really expect a result like that before the game, said Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann. 

Germany, playing their first competitive match since Euro 2004, attacked gamely but Ballack was poor in the first half and their passing suffered as a result. 

There were plenty of mistakes but it was still hugely entertaining as the first three goals came in a breathless six-minute spell midway through the first half. 

Germany went ahead in the 18th minute when Kuranyi diverted Arne Friedrichs long shot, giving keeper Mark Schwarzer no chance. 

Australia grabbed their first equaliser almost immediately. Robert Huth conceded a free kick by barging Aloisi out of Kahns way and Germany were left looking embarrassed when Torsten Frings and Thomas Hitzlsperger jumped up and Skoko squirted the ball underneath them. 

Germany continued to pour forward and went ahead for the second time from a corner. 

The ball drifted over towards the far post and Bernd Schneider cut a pass to the giant centre-back Mertesacker, who took one touch before crashing the ball in. 

Flat-footed defending then allowed Aloisi to race clear on the left of the penalty and sweep a shot past Kahn, levelling the scores again in the 31st minute. 

Schwarzer made two outstanding saves at the start of the second half before Friedrich was blocked by Ljubo Milicevic, giving Ballack his penalty. 

Germany looked much more assured after the third goal and they carved out a fourth when Ballack surged down the left and cut back for Podolski. 

There was more late drama when Skoko set up Aloisi, who converted at the second attempt after Kahn had pulled off a good save. 

A last-gasp equaliser would have been in keeping with a gloriously unpredictable game but there were only seconds remaining after Aloisis goal and Germany held on for a much-needed boost in confidence. 

Popovic injury 

Australian defender Tony Popovic is set to miss the rest of the Cup after picking up an ankle injury. 

Popovics ankle is inflamed following a tackle which led to him being replaced by Jon McKain in the 57th minute. 

It is unlikely he will play again in the tournament, team spokesman Stuart Hodge said on Thursday, adding that McKain would probably take over for Saturdays game against Argentina. (Reuters)

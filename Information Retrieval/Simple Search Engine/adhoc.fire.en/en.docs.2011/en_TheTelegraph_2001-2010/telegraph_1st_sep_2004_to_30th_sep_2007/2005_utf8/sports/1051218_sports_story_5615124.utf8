 Kapur still at tied seventh

Okinawa (Japan): Three bogeys on the trot on the back nine on an extremely windy day ruined what could have been a great third round for Shiv Kapur in the $830,000 Asia Okinawa Open. 

Kapur ended the day at even par after being three-under on the 13th tee. He is now tied for seventh and five off the lead. 

Meanwhile, local sensation Tetsuji Hiratsuka fired a sparkling seven-under-par 64 to take the third round lead. The 34-year-old topped the leaderboard on 10-under-par 203 with countryman Kaname Yokoo in hot pursuit. 

Jeev Milkha Singh suffered two double bogeys and a series of putting problems to return a card of three over 74 and he slipped to tied 28th place from overnight 11th with a one-under 212. Gaurav Ghei shot a four-over 75 and is tied 38th with a one-over 214. 

Amandeep Johl, also 75, is two-over and tied 48th. Arjun Singh was the only Indian apart from Kapur to shoot an even par and his 71 took him to two-over 215 and tied 48th with Johl. 

Rahil Gangjee went three-over 74 and his total of three-over 216 placed him at tied 51st.

 Sporting look to avenge NFL loss 

 - Jotin nets fastest goal as Churchill finish 3rd 

 Sporting defence would have a tough time contending Barreto 

Margao: An explosive contest is on the cards when Super Cup champions Sporting Clube de Goa take on the mighty Mahindra United of Mumbai in the final of the Alchemist Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. 

For Sporting, it is more than a point to prove themselves after their loss against Mahindra in the last edition of the National Football League, which saw them losing the title to Dempo. 

Both teams have had a successful outing in this tourney. Mahindra, who earned a hard-fought win against JCT in the opener, later scored comfortable wins against Hindustan Aeronatic Sports Club, and Churchill Brothers to reach the finals, while Sporting beat SBT in their opening match. Later they beat Fransa Pax and then Salgaocar via a tie-breaker to reach the finals. 

The final would be billed between Mahindras star striker Jose Ramirez Baretto and Sportings Edeh Chidi who have scored four goals each so far and are vying for the Alchemist Golden Boot award of Rs 1 lakh. 

Mahindra play possession football and have a sound defence and formidable strike force. Jose Barreto as a withdrawn striker is the fulcrum on which the whole team relies. 

With Venkatesh leading the attack from the middle and Steven Dias playing the role of a provider from the right flank, the rival defence would have a tough time contending Barreto, who played havoc against Churchill, scoring two goals with clinical finish. 

Sporting too have a lethal attack in the form of Dudu Omagbemi and Chidi but were found wanting in their last match against Salgaocar where Chidi muffed several scoring chances before he equalised in the second-half to decide the match via tie-breaker. 

Meanwhile, casual approach by rival keeper Juje Siddi allowed Churchill Brothers to score a comprehensive 5-0 win over Salgaocar in the play-off for third place on Saturday. The highlight of the match was the fastest goal ever scored in the competition by Churchills Jotin Singh, who gave his team the lead within 15 seconds of the start of the match. 

Carlos Fernandes and Tony Ngozi added two more goals to surprise Siddi, who replaced Sangram Mukherjee, while MoM Osumanu Husseini and P. T. Sony rounded off the tally. (PTI)

 Wiratchant keeps nerves, lifts crown

New Delhi: Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant kept his nerve to hold off a brilliant late charge by Gaurav Ghei to win the $300,000 Hero Honda Indian Open at the Delhi Golf Club on Sunday. 

Birthday boy Ghei produced a stunning six-under 66 but the Asian Tour money leader played conservatively to finish 16-under 272, two strokes ahead of the Indian, to claim his third title of the season and a winners cheque of usd 47,250. 

Jyoti Randhawa, third going into the final round, had a disappointing 73 and finished tied sixth with the ever-consistent Mukesh Kumar who had a card of 68 for an overall nine-under 279. 

Among the other Indians, Arjun Atwal returned a card of two-under 70 but that could not make up for Saturdays 73 and he finished joint 11th with an aggregate of 281. 

Ashok Kumar (68) and Shiv Kapur (69) were joint eighth, with Rick Gibson of Canada at eight-under 280 overall. 

I am happy to win this week. Everybody plays to win, I think I played better... Made less mistakes than others, said Wiratchant, who won the Indonesian Open and Taiwan Open earlier this year. 

For Ghei, who turned 37 on Sunday, the birdie on the 18th hole brought back memories of 1995 when he won the Western Gadgill Masters to become the first Indian to win a title on the Asian Tour. 

It was also a replay of the shot he played 10 years ago ? His third shot, a 4-iron, left him on the right edge of the green at the par-5 hole and he holed it from 25 yards. 

Ghei had a bogey-free day with birdies on the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th and 11th. He missed a birdie on the par-5 14th. 

Although it (the birdie miss) did not get to me, it was a big mistake. Had I made the birdie there, I would have been within one stroke. And if Thaworn had seen me make that hole, it would have put him under pressure. 

But after missing that, I knew that Thaworn wasnt going to make any mistakes. 

Randhawa began with a bogey, and although he birdied the 4th, 5th and 7th, three more bogeys on the back nine ruined his day. 

The 33-year old Indian said he perhaps had kept his eye too much on the scorecard and did not concentrate on playing his normal game. 

I tried my best, but maybe tried too hard and stopped thinking, said Randhawa. I kept looking at the leader (board). I think I wanted to win the tournament badly? perhaps I would have won it had I played the way I usually do. 

Wiratchant began with a birdie on the second, and went on to overcome bogeys on the third and ninth holes. 

An eight-foot birdie on the 16th put the tournament beyond Gheis reach. 

This course doesnt really suit my game, said Wiratchant, who is not known for his driving. I have missed the cut a couple of times. 

But it was to Wiratchants credit that he did not miss the ball once the whole week. 

Any other course, if you miss the fairway, you can come back. But here, if you miss the fairway, it could be the toughest course, the 39-year old said. 

Wiratchant, who led from the second day on, said he just made it a point to keep it on the fairway and did not look at Ghei. 

I did not worry about anything, cant control his game. I always tried to make par. Even when I wanted to hit a 3-wood, I just chose to hit a 3-iron. I made mistakes but controlled my mind. 

Wiratchant rated his Indonesian Open win better since it was a co-sanctioned event. 

Even though I won here, I still dont like the course, he said of the DGC where the narrow fairways punishes the slightest error in driving. 

 I cannot guarantee that I will come to defend 

 my title, it depends on whether I am playing in another 

 tour the same week or not.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Gunners shoot into last 8

 - EURO ROUND-UP 

- Espanyol hold Barcelona goalless; Lyon upset 

London: Arsenal won a penalty shootout 4-2 against underdog Sheffield United to squeeze into the quarter finals of the FA Cup. 

A fifth-round replay at Bramall Lane ended 0-0 Tuesday after extra time as Sheffield United goalkeeper Paddy Kenny defied the Gunners with a series of saves after the Blades almost took the lead 45 seconds after kickoff. 

Gunners? goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, frequently criticised for blunders during open play, saved two spot kicks in the shootout while Arsenal converted all four of its attempts kicks through Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Fredrik Ljungberg and Ashley Cole. They will visit Bolton for a place in the semi-finals. 

In other fifth-round replays, Blackburn edged championship side Burnley 2-1 and Southampton won 3-1 at league two Brentford to set up a quarter final against defending champion Manchester United. 

Held to a 1-1 draw by Sheffield at home, the Gunners went into their replay without forwards Dennis Bergkamp, Jose Antonio Reyes and Robin Van Persie ? all suspended ? and the injured Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Sol Campbell. 

The Blades nearly led in the first minute when Andy Liddell broke down the left and pulled the ball back to Michael Tonge. With Almunia off his line, Tonge but prodded the ball over the empty goal. 

Arsenal had plenty of possession but didn?t muster a single shot on target in the first half. Ljungberg pulled a shot wide after good approach work by Vieira. 

Gunners? manager Arsene Wenger sent on 18-year-old attacking midfielder Quincy Owusu-Abeyie to start the second half and the teenager almost put them ahead six minutes later. He broke clear down the right and fired a low, angled shot only for Kenny to get his right hand to the ball. 

A minute later, Fabregas beat Kenny from 10m only for defender Derek Geary to turn the goalbound shot over his own crossbar. 

After all that pressure, the championship side almost snatched victory in the 90th minute when John Harley produced a firm diving header from Geary?s right wing cross only for Almunia to tip the ball over the bar. 

Danish striker Morten Pedersen scored Blackburn?s winner four minutes from the end against neighbour Burnley at Ewood park. 

Kerimoglu Tugay gave Rovers a 31st-minute lead. Brett Emerton?s volley was blocked but the ball came to Tugay 30m out, and the Turkish international?s shot deflected off Micah Hyde and past ?keeper Brian Jensen. 

Hyde atoned for the goal with an equaliser three minutes before halftime. He collected a throw-in and fired a long-range shot from the corner of the area into the roof of the net. 

Brentford stunned Southampton by taking a fourth-minute lead through Eddie Hutchinson at Griffin Park. Jay Tabb?s shot was blocked by the Saints defence and the ball rolled to Hutchinson, who fired home the rebound. 

Saints levelled seven minutes later when bees goalkeeper Stuart Nelson parried Kevin Phillips? shot and Peter Crouch pounced on the loose ball. 

Phillips put the Saints ahead in the 67th minute when he turned Crouch?s cross home from close range after Olivier Bernard had broken out of defence. Crouch scored his second of the game in the final minute to ensure Southampton?s place in the last eight. 

Meanwhile, an inspired performance from Espanyol ?keeper Carlos Kameni prevented Barcelona from extending their lead to 11 points at the top of the Primera Liga as they were held to a goalless draw at the Nou Camp. 

Second division Clermont Foot pulled off a huge upset when they beat champions Olympique Lyon 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw to reach the French Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday. 

Third division Nimes crushed Ligue 1 Nice 4-0 in another shock result and second division Sedan beat fourth division Quevilly 2-0. 

The result was a setback for Lyon, who demolished Werder Bremen 3-0 last week in the away leg of their Champions League first knockout round tie and beat arch-rivals St Etienne 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Saturday. 

To add salt to their wounds, Lyon captain Sidney Govou picked up a thigh injury and is doubtful for the league match against Caen on Friday.

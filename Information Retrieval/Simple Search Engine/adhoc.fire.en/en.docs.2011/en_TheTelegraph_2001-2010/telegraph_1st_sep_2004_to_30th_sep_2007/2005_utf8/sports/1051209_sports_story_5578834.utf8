 I am against the ICC: Akram

Bangalore: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram criticised the International Cricket Council, saying it was dominated by former white cricketers, who made little mark during their careers. 

I am against the ICC. The reason is it is run by all the goras (whites). Passion is here (in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), money is here and talent is here. All the cricketers who retire after playing two matches, they work for ICC. From Pakistan, Sri Lanka, nobody gets there (to ICC), Akram said. 

The former fast bowler, who was here to attend a promotional meet on Wednesday, said that was the reason why he was always keen to help cricketers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, who seek tips to improve their skills. 

On the bilateral series between India and Pakistan, he said pressure builds up on both sides of the border much before the action begins. 

It evokes tremendous excitement and so much interest that sometimes even office functioning in many parts of the two countries comes to a standstill. Rivalry during the Ashes series, too, is no comparison, Akram said. 

On Pakistans prospects in the 2007 World Cup, Akram was tongue-in-cheek. 

In India and Pakistan, we dont know whats going to happen tomorrow. The World Cup is in 2007. 

There are a host of possibilities before the big event. There are chances of Inzamam-ul Haq and the coach being sacked and change of (Pakistan cricket) board. Its too early to say what will happen, he said.

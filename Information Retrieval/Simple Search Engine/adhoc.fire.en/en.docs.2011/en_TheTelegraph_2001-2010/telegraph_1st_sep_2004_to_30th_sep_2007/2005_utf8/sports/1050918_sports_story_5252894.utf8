The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid alone is the winner

 - SOurav ganguly-greg chappell face-off 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Till Sourav Gangulys stunning revelation (on Thursday) about his being asked to step down, the biggest cricket news of the season had been Englands Ashes triumph. 

But if England were very public winners at the start of the week, the crown must go to Team India vice-captain Rahul Dravid. 

Not for the 77 he scored in the only Indian innings in the Bulawayo Test, but his role in the Sourav-Greg Chappell face-off. 

Actually, Dravid got into the act around the same time as Kevin Pietersen was ensuring Australia had to let go of their most cherished trophy. 

But, then, no one knew it then except Sourav, Chappell, and manager Amitabh Choudhary. Some hours later, somebody with huge influence in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), too. 

If the Sourav-Chappell face-off did much to affect the Team India image, Dravid did enough ? away from the public eye, of course ? to limit the damage. 

As first reported by The Telegraph on Friday, Dravid refused to fish in troubled waters and told the manager (who sought his views) that Chappell had chosen the wrong time ? hours before the start of the two-Test series ? to ask Sourav to step down. 

Dravids point was simple: The move would cause (not solve) problems. 

That Chappell agreed with Dravid, during the emergent team management meeting on Monday afternoon, enhances the vice-captains stature. 

Its another matter that Chappell didnt take back what hed conveyed to Sourav ? step down to allow for Mohammed Kaifs inclusion (alongside Yuvraj Singhs). 

Those with a cynical bent can argue Dravid vetoed it to avoid being labelled an opportunist, but that would be being more than just unfair. 

Dravid is protocol conscious ? his off the field actions are as straight as the bat he offers out in the middle ? and values the collective element in Team India. 

Hes ambitious, yes, but wont have anything to do with even the semblance of a coup. 

Thats why Dravid is the only winner in the Sourav-Chappell face-off. 

Incidentally, its to be seen just how wisely the BCCI handles this crisis. 

Will the coach (particularly when its somebody of Chappells stature) be allowed a free hand or is status quo going to be maintained? 

If theres no change in the structure and equations, we may only have seen Act I of a power struggle. 

After all, no dressing room anywhere is big enough for two bosses?

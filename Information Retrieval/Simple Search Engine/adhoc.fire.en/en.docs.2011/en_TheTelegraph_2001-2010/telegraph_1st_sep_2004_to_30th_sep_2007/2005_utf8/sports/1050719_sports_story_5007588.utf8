 McGrath: England lack confidence 

 - FIRST ASHES TEST - Aussie quick says the hosts body language isnt 

 right 

 Grenn McGrath is one wicket away from joining 500-club 

Sydney: The England cricket team was suffering from a lack of confidence heading into the first Ashes Test at Lords on Thursday, according to Australian opening bowler Glenn McGrath. 

McGrath, who is on 499 Test wickets, said the Australians had noticed Englands players were exuding self-belief during earlier one-day matches on the tour but had started to slump with Australias comfortable victories in the last two matches. 

To me, body language is the biggest key and that is one thing Australia does so well, McGrath was reported as saying by a daily Monday. 

During the last two one-dayers (at Lords and The Oval), it was quite obvious to see that their body language had dropped. It was so quiet out there (on the field). That is a sign that it wont take much to get on top of them. It is easy to get aggressive when things are going well. 

They believe in themselves more than in the past. They have world-class players and that helps, but whether they really believe they can beat us, we will have to wait and see. 

In the back of their minds, they will know we probably had the edge over them in the one-dayers. 

McGrath said he also felt that England relied too heavily on certain players to perform, notably openers Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss, captain Michael Vaughan and fast bowler Steve Harmison. 

England needed to ensure that Harmison was right for the series after he had a disappointing return in South Africa, where he admitted to suffering badly from home sickness, McGrath added. 

I thought England had a far better team and should have beaten South Africa, but Harmy (Harmison) didnt perform as well as I thought he would, McGrath said. 

Hoggy (fellow seamer Matthew Hoggard) bowled pretty well and that helped them out, but they wont get away with relying on just two guys performing. If they do, we will win and win well. 

England opener Marcus Trescothick is the bookmakers favourite to become McGraths 500th wicket. 

McGrath is set to become the second pace bowler after Courtney Walsh (519) to achieve the milestone. 

British bookmakers William Hill have offered the left-handed Trescothick at 9-4 to become McGraths 500th victim with fellow opener Andrew Strauss 11-4. England captain Michael Vaughan, who is expected to bat at number three, is third favourite at 7-2. 

Australian bookmaker Centrebet had Trescothick at A$3.25, as was Strauss, while Vaughan was paying $4.50 for every dollar invested. 

McGrath has dismissed Trecothick and Vaughan four times each in Tests. 

The Australians are heavy favourites to retain the Ashes for the ninth successive series with Centrebet offering odds of $1.37, while England are priced at $4.65.

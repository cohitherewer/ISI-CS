 Harrington pulls out

St Andrews: Irelands Padraig Harrington pulled out of the British Open on Tuesday following the death of his father, organisers said. 

Harringtons father Patrick, a former policeman, had been suffering from cancer of the oesophagus. He was diagnosed in March, one week after his son became the first Irish player to win a PGA Tour title at the Honda Classic in Florida. 

Harrington, ranked ninth in the world, skipped last weeks Scottish Open at Loch Lomond after his fathers condition worsened. Henrik Stenson of Sweden, at world number 78 the highest ranked player not already exempt, will take Harringtons place in the 156-strong field at St Andrews. (Reuters)

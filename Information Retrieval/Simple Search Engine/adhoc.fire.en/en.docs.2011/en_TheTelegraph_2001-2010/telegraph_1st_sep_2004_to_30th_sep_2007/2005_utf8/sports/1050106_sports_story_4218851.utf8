The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Great opportunities for our girls: Nirupama

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Sania has made fantastic progress, thinks Nirupama 

Chennai: She was the torch-bearer of women?s tennis in our country for the best part of a decade. The first Indian to feature in a Grand Slam women?s singles draw, Nirupama Vaidyanathan attained a career-high world ranking of 130 before time ran out on her playing days. 

Married and settled in California, Nirupama is still very much hands-on with the game. Besides being a permanent fixture on the TV commentary team for the Chennai ATP meet as well as the Grand Slams, she runs an academy (Niru?s Tennis Academy) back home jointly with brother K.V. Ramesh. 

Very soon, Nirupama may wear another hat ? that of a travelling coach of the talented Uberoi sisters, Shikha and Neha. 

?I had preliminary discussions with their dad Mahesh just before coming to India? He?s very keen that I travel with his daughters. The details will have to be worked out, but if things do fall into place, I?ll start with them in March,? Nirupama told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

The Florida-based Uberoi siblings have been making the right noises with their racket strings in the past year or so. The 21-year-old Shikha, ranked around 150, shot into prominence after qualifying for last year?s US Open main draw, beat world No.56 Saori Obata before losing 5-7, 1-6 to Venus Williams. Neha is 18 and currently ranked inside the top-300. 

?The girls are talented, no question about that. On top of that, they are eager to learn, are very enthusiastic and have parents who are keen to put them on the right track. In short, the possibilities are endless,? Nirupama observed. 

In Florida, Shikha and Neha train with Rick Maci, Venus Williams? ex-coach, while their father travels on the WTA Tour. 

With Sania Mirza also starting to fulfil her immense potential, Nirupama oozes excitement talking of Indian women?s tennis. ?Sania has made fantastic progress in the last few months. Making the final of a $50,000 Challenger event in Florida last month confirmed that.? 

During her time, she made it a one-woman army as far as the Fed Cup was concerned. The past was tense, but the present and future look perfect. ?What a Fed Cup team we?ll have once Shikha comes in? Sania, Shikha and, maybe, Neha in a year or two. I can?t wait to see the Indian team in action,? Nirupama quipped. 

With Mahesh Bhupathi?s management company Globosport backing women?s tennis, the scenario looks quite rosy. ?There?s one WTA meet already in Hyderabad, another one is set to take off in Calcutta? what great opportunities for our girls,? Nirupama marvelled. 

Though she started her academy a year ago, it?s just been five months since it became a full-fledged training centre. ?My brother has joined me as a co-director and we have about 50 kids, all Indians,? informed Nirupama. 

There?s been no stopping Nirupama ever since she blossomed as a player, a trifle late in her career. Indian tennis can still get a lot out of her as the genial lady tries to get the right balance between business and passion.

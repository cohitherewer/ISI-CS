Bangalore: The spotlight was on Sachin Tendulkar ? who made a comeback after a long injury layoff ? as the three-day camp for Team India commenced here on Wednesday. 

The conclave started with indoor training sessions at the National Cricket Academy before trooping out for light nets which was interrupted by rains in the afternoon. 

Rahul Dravid, appointed captain for the next two series, and Virender Sehwag, both of whom played for the World XI in the Super Series in Australia, missed the proceedings on Wednesday. 

However, both Dravid and Sehwag, who arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday evening, left for Nagpur and Delhi, respectively. 

Dravid took a connecting flight to Nagpur after landing here from Australia to be with his new-born child and wife, while the Sehwags left for Delhi, according to board sources. 

The two players are unlikely to take part in the camp, they added. 

Meanwhile, Sachin batted for a while, facing deliveries from Kerala speedster Sreesanth, the lone new face in the 15-member squad that will do duty in the first two one-dayers against Sri Lanka beginning at Nagpur on Tuesday. 

Team India coach Greg Chappell was assisted by his support staff ? trainer Gregory King and physio John Gloster ? besides bio-mechanics expert Ian Frazer. 

Chappell, whose public spat with Sourav Ganguly made headlines recently, declined to speak to the scribes. 

Members of the electronic media sought to cajole Sachin for sound-bites while he was sipping tea, but the batting maestro, who was in a jovial mood, quipped: I am having biscuit bites. 

The camp comes in the wake of a gruelling home season that will witness India play 12 one-day Internationals ? seven against Sri Lanka and five against South Africa ? besides three Tests against Sri Lanka. 

Meanwhile, Anil Kumble and Mohammed Kaif ? who are under rehabilitation ? spent some time with Gloster, who is supervising their progress. 

The first tie of the seven-match rubber is set to commence at Nagpur on October 25. 

The Lankans are scheduled to reach India on Thursday and will start their tour with a warm-up game against Mumbai Cricket Association Presidents XI here on October 22. (PTI)

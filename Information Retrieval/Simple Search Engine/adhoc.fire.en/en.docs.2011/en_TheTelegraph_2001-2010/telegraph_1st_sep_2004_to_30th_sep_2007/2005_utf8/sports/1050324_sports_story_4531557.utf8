 ?Dalmiya represented BCCI?

New Delhi: International Cricket Council (ICC) said that former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya attended its executive board meeting here last week as a BCCI representative. 

The ICC said that it allowed Dalmiya to attend the two-day meeting on March 17-18 on an ?advice? from the BCCI. 

?In relation to the legal issues, the BCCI provided the board with advice that Mr Dalmiya was its representative and entitled to take his place at the meeting,? ICC spokesperson Brendon McClements said. 

A ruling of the Madras High Court prevents Dalmiya from representing BCCI in ICC and other international meetings. ICC president Ehsan Mani, while answering reporters after the meeting on Friday, had said that Dalmiya attended the said meeting as an ICC director. 

As per the ICC constitution, the executive board of directors are the current presidents and chairmen of the ten full member countries (Test playing nations) and three associate member countries. 

McClements said that ICC regulations provided for someone other than a president to represent the board concerned. (PTI)

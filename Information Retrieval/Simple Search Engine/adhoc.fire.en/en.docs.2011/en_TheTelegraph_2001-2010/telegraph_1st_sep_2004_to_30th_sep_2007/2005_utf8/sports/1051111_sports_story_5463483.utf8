 Hodge replaces Katich

Melbourne: Out of form batsman Simon Katich has been dropped from the Australian squad for next weeks second Test against the West Indies, and replaced by Brad Hodge. 

Katich has struggled since returning from the Ashes series in England, scoring just two runs in the Test against the World XI, though a century in a first-class match prior to the first Test against the Caribbeans earned him another chance ahead of Hodge in Brisbane. 

However, Katich was out for a duck in his only innings in the 379-run victory at the Gabba, forcing selectors to make the change. 

The middle-order batsmen also had a disappointing series in England, averaging just 27.55 with a top score of 67 in five Tests.

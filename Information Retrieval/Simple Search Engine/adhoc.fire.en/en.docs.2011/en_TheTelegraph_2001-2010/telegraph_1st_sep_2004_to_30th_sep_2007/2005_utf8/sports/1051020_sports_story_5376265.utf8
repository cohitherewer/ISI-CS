 Fresh injury for Jayasuriya

Colombo: Sri Lankan allrounder Sanath Jayasuriyas recovery from a dislocated shoulder has suffered a setback after a freak accident playing water polo when he collided with the team physiotherapist. 

Sri Lanka had hoped before the accident, he would have recovered sufficiently to bowl during the seven-match one-day International series in India starting next week. 

Skipper Marvan Atapattu said: We had some water sports in Bentota (a beach resort) and unfortunately this accident happened. 

Jayasuriya sat-out a warm-up match on Tuesday, but Sri Lanka are optimistic about his chances of playing as a batsman in the first game next Tuesday in Nagpur. 

Atapattu, looking forward to the series, said: We are expecting a tough challenge from India and we are now all geared up for the tour. We know we have done well in Sri Lanka but it is different when you face the Indians at home. 

After the one-dayers, the Sri Lankans will return home before a three-match Test tour in December.

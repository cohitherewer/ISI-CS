 Lebedeva wins $1m jackpot

Berlin: Russian triple jumper Tatyana Lebedeva won the Golden Leagues $1 million jackpot with a victory in Berlin on Sunday that left her as the only unbeaten competitor after the seasons six meetings in Europe. 

The 29-year-old mother from Volgograd won the prize with a leap of 14.85m, beating Yamile Aldama of Sudan into second place. 

A two-time world champion, Lebedeva skipped last months World Championships in Helsinki to focus on the Golden League and the sports richest prize. 

Ive always dreamed of something like this, Lebedeva said. 

And now my dreams are finally coming true here. 

The $1 million in gold bars is awarded to competitors who win their disciplines in all six Golden League meetings in a single season. 

Lebedeva became the second athlete, after Mozambiques 800m runner Maria Mutola in 2003, to win the entire pot. 

The Russian was a model of consistency at all six meets ? winning in Paris, Rome, Oslo, Zurich, Brussels and in Berlin on Sunday. 

Her shortest jump before Sunday was 14.94 metres in Brussels and her best was 15.11 in Paris.

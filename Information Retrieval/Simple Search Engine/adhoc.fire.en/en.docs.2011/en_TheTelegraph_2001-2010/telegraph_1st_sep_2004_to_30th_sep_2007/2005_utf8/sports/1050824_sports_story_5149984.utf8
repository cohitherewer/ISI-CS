The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kulkarni no to CAB offer 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Nilesh Kulkarni has turned down an offer from the CAB to play for the state during the forthcoming domestic season. According to a senior CAB functionary, Kulkarni made his intentions known a couple of days ago. 

It is learnt that the left-arm spinner has decided to turn out for Maharashtra along with Sairaj Bahutule. 

Bengals hunt for a left-arm spinner has so far drawn a blank. It is still unclear if Bengal will down the shutters in its search for outstation recruits. Talks are still on with Hemang Badani and the Tamil Nadu cricketer hasnt made up his mind yet. 

Meanwhile, the local inter-club transfers begin on September 1. Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta is set to turn out for Kalighat. The club has also finalised talks with Asok Dinda from Sporting Union and DKS Sovam Ghosh. Kalighat has, however, decided to release pacer Shabbir Ali, who is set to play for Sporting Union. 

Sporting Unions biggest catch so far has been Arindam Das from East Bengal. With Ranadeb Bose set to stay, the club will be a force to reckon with. Its not confirmed, but Shib Shankar Paul is likely to move to Eastern Railway from Mohun Bagan. 

NSW 184/3 vs CAB XI 

New South Wales were 184 for three against CAB XI in a rain-shortened opening day of the two-day invitational meet in Bangalore on Tuesday. According to information received here, 16 overs remained to be bowled when play was called off. Paul took two wickets. 

If both innings are not completed on Wednesday, the winners will be decided by the spin of the coin.

Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt swept aside Ivo Minar for his fourth Sydney International title Saturday before setting his sights on Roger Federer at next week?s Australian Open. 

Australia?s world No. 3 captured his 24th career singles title with a 7-5, 6-0 victory in an hour over the gallant but outgunned Czech qualifier and said he was now ready to step up for the battles ahead in the year?s first Grand Slam. 

Federer is the man they all have to beat in Melbourne after dominating men?s tennis last year winning three of the four Grand Slams and the season-ending tennis Masters Cup in Houston. 

?Someone?s going to have to play extremely well to beat Roger and try to stay with him early in his matches,? said Hewitt, who lost to the Swiss world number one in all their six meetings last year to trail 8-7 overall in career match-ups. 

?He?s definitely the favourite, there?s no doubt about that, the way he?s been going over the last 18 months, but he?s human and he has guys like Marat Safin and Andre Agassi in his half. If he?s slightly off, it?s still not going to be that easy for him.? 

It was Hewitt?s 20th consecutive match win on the Sydney Olympic Centre court following earlier Sydney title triumphs in 2000, 2001 and last year. Hewitt?s only loss at the Sydney tennis centre came in the 2000 Olympics against Max Mirnyi, whom he beat in the semis here Friday. Hewitt became the first man to win four Sydney titles since Australian John Bromwich in 1949. 

 Agassi feeling better 

Meanwhile, Andre Agassi plans to play the Australian Open after coming through a hastily-arranged exhibition match to test a hip injury. The 34-year-old suffered the injury when playing fellow-American Andy Roddick in the Kooyong Classic Thursday. 

Although his movement was not at its best in Saturday?s match with Briton Tim Henman, Agassi said the prospects were encouraging. ?Today?s a good sign, no question,? said Agassi, who lost 3-6, 7-6, 5-7 to Henman. ?I plan on playing. But I?ll have to see how I pull up tomorrow and take it day by day. 

?To be out there playing for two hours was good, but I definitely wasn?t getting to balls I usually would. To be at my best is what I am shooting for, but I?ll have to get there soon.? (Agencies)

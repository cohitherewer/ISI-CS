 Robin Corner to return 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Robin Corner is returning to the city ? lock, stock and barrel. The jockey-turned stipendiary steward will be seen in a new role at the RCTC ? training horses, according to sources. He was granted a training licence on Tuesday by the RCTC.

 Corner, who has been working as a senior stipendiary steward in Bangalore Turf Club, resigned from the job last month. He has also disposed of his Koramangala bunglow and moved to the city with family.

 Corner, it may recalled, started his riding career in the city as an apprentice and he went on to mature as fine jockey, winning many championship titles in his heyday. In his prime, he was the main jockey for Khaitans, and also helped brother, trainer Phillip Corner, win many races before shifting base to Bangalore where he rode for MAM Ramaswamy and others. He hung up his riding boots in the mid-nineties.

 Articulate and soft spoken, Corner may, however, make his beginning in the new profession mostly for outstation owners for whom he rode in the past. Locally, Phillips faithfuls may also extend support but Corner is learnt to be looking for quality horse-flesh, and not quantity. It is also learnt that the Khaitans have promised him a couple of juveniles for training. Corner could not be reached for comment.

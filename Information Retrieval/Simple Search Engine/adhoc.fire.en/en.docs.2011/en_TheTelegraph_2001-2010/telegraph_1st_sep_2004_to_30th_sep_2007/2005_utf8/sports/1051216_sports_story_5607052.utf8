 ICC to review rule earlier

Karachi: Instead of June 2006, the International Cricket Council (ICC) will review the experimental one-day super sub rule in February next year. 

Under the rule, which came into effect last September, teams name a 12th man before the toss who can then replace one player during the match. 

ICC President Ehsan Mani told reporters on Thursday that the meeting would be discussing the rule in detail. 

We will review it and see if it needs to be amended or finished, he said.

 Sania remains at No. 37

London: Indias Sania Mirza remained at No. 37 in the WTA rankings for a second week, according to list released on Monday. 

There was no change in the top 10, with Maria Sharapova of Russia leading the way, followed by American Lindsay Davenport and Belgian Kim Clijsters. 

On the mens side, Aussie Lleyton Hewitt jumped up two places to No. 3, while Andy Roddick (US) and Marat Safin (Russia), slipped down one place each to No. 4 and No. 5, respectively. 

Swiss Roger Federer is guaranteed to end the year as world No. 1 after winning his 11th title of the year at the Thailand Open on Sunday. 

Last year Federer sealed the year-end number one spot in mid-September. 

Meanwhile, Sania is hoping her successful season will continue this week at the Japan Open, add agencies from Tokyo. 

Ive never played at the senior level in Japan, but Ive been to Osaka twice and to Nagoya twice in the juniors. Ive always played well in Japan. Im looking forward to a great week, said Sania. 

The 18-year-old, who won the japan open junior doubles title in 2003, will take on qualifier Vilmarie Castellvi of Puerto Rico on Tuesday. 

Sania said her successful results were just a matter of time and had happened sooner than she had expected. 

I got the opportunities and I just grabbed them with both hands. I played some good tennis when it really mattered, she said.

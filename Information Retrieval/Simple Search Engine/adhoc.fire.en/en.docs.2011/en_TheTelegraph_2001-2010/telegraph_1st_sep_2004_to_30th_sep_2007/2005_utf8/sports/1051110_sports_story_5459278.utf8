 Nalbandian to replace Roddick

Singapore: World number three Andy Roddick has become the latest withdrawal from the Tennis Masters Cup, a lower back injury forcing the American to miss the season-ending eight-man tournament starting in Shanghai on Sunday. 

Roddicks decision was confirmed on the ATP Tours official website on Wednesday, just a day after Australian world number four Lleyton Hewitt said he would skip the tournament as his wife was close to giving birth to their first child. 

Roddick sustained the injury during his quarter final match against David Ferrer at the Paris Masters last Friday and the 23-year old has been replaced by Argentine world number 12 David Nalbandian. Though I have tried to continue with practice, the lower back spasms continue, Roddick was quoted on the website. 

After being evaluated by medical staff upon my return to the United States, it is now clear that I will not be able to resume tennis activities for 10-14 days. 

I apologise to the loyal fans and sponsors who had expected my participation in the Masters Cup. 

I realise the tremendous amount of time and effort the ATP and the Chinese government have spent on the event, and know it will be a huge success. 

I look forward to getting healthy, starting my off-season workouts for the 2006 season, and working towards qualifying for Shanghai next year.

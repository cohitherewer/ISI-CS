 Team India gets batting practice

 Sourav Ganguly en route to his 46 on Saturday 

Mutare: India batted throughout the final day in the warm-up tie against Zimbabwe Board XI on Saturday. Resuming at 365 for two, India stretched their innings till 572 for nine before declaring at tea, giving the tourists a lead of 278 runs. 

In their second innings, Zimbabwe Board were 96 for one. India batted throughout in order to give Sourav Ganguly a chance to get back into runs as Rahul Dravid retired at his overnight score of 102 not out. However, Sourav only scored two before pulling out due to a strain in his right forearm. 

The Indian captain returned at 477 for six, progressing to 45 with ease before his lift in the deep was gratefully accepted. 

Sourav later said that he has been having pain in his right elbow since the tri-series. However, he intends to play in the two Tests against Zimbabwe over the next two weeks. 

This brought Dravid back to the crease. He added six runs to his total before tea. 

In between, India suffered a batting collapse as VVS Laxman (28), Mohammad Kaif (4) and Yuvraj Singh (1) were all dismissed due to indifferent strokes. 

Dinesh Karthick (40) and Anil Kumble (61) however managed to score. 

Both were dismissed by Graeme Cremer. The leg-spinner finished with four scalps. 

The hosts made 96 for one from 18 overs in their second outing when the match met its dead end.

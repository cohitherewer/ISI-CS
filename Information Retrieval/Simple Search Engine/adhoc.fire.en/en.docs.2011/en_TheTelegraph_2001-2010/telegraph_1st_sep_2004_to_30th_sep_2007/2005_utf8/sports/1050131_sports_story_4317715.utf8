 Pak can bounce back: Dravid

Jaipur: Rahul Dravid has warned teammates against complacency and said Pakistan can ?bounce back? from their disastrous series in Australia in the upcoming tour of India. 

Dravid felt that talks of pressure on either side was purely media hype and that a strong challenge from the visitors cannot be ruled out only because they put up a lacklustre performance against Australia. 

?Bad performance in one series does not mean much and I believe these talks of pressure is an assumption by the media,? the Team India vice-captain said. 

Dravid, accompanied by wife Vijeta, is in the city as a brand ambassador for a telecommunication firm. 

?If Pakistan had one bad series it does not mean the end of the road for them. It is the performance in a particular series which decides the result at the end of the day. 

?So one shouldn?t read much into that one bad performance. They are good and can bounce back. It will be a hard fought series,? he said. 

The middle-order batsman gave thumbs up to John Gloster, who has been suggested by Andrew Leipus to take over the job as team physio. 

?I have heard about him. He is good and would certainly be a great help to the team,? the vice-captain said. 

He, however, refused to enter into a debate on the wicketkeeper?s slot, particularly regarding youngsters Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik. (PTI)

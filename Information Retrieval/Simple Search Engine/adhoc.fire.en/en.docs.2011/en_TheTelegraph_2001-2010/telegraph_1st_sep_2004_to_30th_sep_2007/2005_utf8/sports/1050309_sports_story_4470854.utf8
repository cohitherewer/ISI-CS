 Bolton keep Uefa dream alive

London: Battling Bolton Wanderers jumped to sixth place in the Premier League with a 1-0 victory at Manchester City on Monday. 

Senegal international El Hadji Diouf tapped in the winner at the far post at the stroke of halftime following a cross from Stelios Giannakopoulos. 

Bolton defended stoutly to clinch a win that lifted them above Middlesbrough on to 43 points, the same as fifth-placed Liverpool. A sixth-place finish will guarantee a spot in next season?s Uefa Cup. 

City manager Kevin Keegan said this week he would retire when his contract expires in 2006. City stay 12th on 36 points. (Reuters)

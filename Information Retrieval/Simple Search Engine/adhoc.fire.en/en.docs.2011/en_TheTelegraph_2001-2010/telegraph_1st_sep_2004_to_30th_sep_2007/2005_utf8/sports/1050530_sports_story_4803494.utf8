Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia rode a second-half blitz to rout three-time champions India 4-1 in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here on Sunday. 

Both teams have four points from three games, though the hosts have a better goal-difference. 

The comprehensive win at the Bukit Jalil Stadium was Malaysias biggest against eight-time Olympic champions India. 

Pakistan, playing without suspended captain Muhammad Saqlain, were still good enough to beat South Africa 2-0. This is Pakistans third win in as many games and they stay atop the table with nine points. 

The three-time champions drew first blood in the 24th minute when Shakeel Abbasi latched on to Dilawar Hussains cross to beat goalkeeper Chris Hibbert with a solo. The lead was doubled in the 30th minute when Rehan Butt, set up by Akhtar Ali, cashed in following a goalmouth scramble. 

Though India dominated Malaysia in a mediocre first half, they failed to wrest advantage and were locked 1-1 at half-time. 

The midfield committed plenty of unforced errors, in particular centre-half Bimal Lakra and left linkman Devender Pal Singh who normally plays on the right. 

Malaysia were the first to score in the sixth minute from a penalty corner, awarded when Inderjit Chadha flung himself deliberately at Mohammad Fairuz Ramli in the 25-yard area. 

Skipper Kuhan Shanmuganathan, who played for Bangalore Hi Fliers in the inaugural Premier League in Hyderabad, did not disappoint beating Devesh Chauhan with a powerful flick. 

The lead was shortlived as India got the equaliser three minutes later. Winger Prabhjot Singh and his Indian Oil teammate Deepak Thakur found their way into the Malaysian circle where defender Azlan Bakar committed a foot fault resulting in a penalty corner. 

Captain Dilip Tirkey scored from the set-piece after Len Aiyappas dummy. 

There was nothing of note in the remaining period of the session with India failing to take advantage of Jiwa Mohans temporary suspension for an infringement. 

Rajpal Singh and Arjun Halappa were not fed accurate passes as the Indian strikers fumbled time and again around the Malaysian circle. 

Barring Prabhjot, who made good penetrative moves, none else sizzled for India up front. (PTI)

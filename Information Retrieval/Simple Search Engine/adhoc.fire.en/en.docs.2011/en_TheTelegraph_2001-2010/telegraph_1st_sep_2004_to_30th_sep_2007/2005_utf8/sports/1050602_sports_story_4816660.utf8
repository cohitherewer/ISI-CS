 Srinath wants rotation policy for pacers

 - Ex-international says current bowlers lack self-belief 

 Srinath rates Zaheer Khan as the best on current form 

Mumbai: In an attempt to streamline the Indian pace attack, Jawagal Srinath Wednesday advocated the need for having a rotation policy for fast bowlers in the team. 

The selectors should shortlist six to seven fast bowlers and pick them for a tour by rotating them instead of going for a head hunting while selecting the team, Srinath said. 

The policy of selecting different mediumpacers for different tours put pressure on the youngsters and creates instability in the fast bowling department, Srinath said. 

If we select the same bunch of mediumpacers, the fast bowlers can work as a team and give results, he added. 

There is also an urgent need to have fair wickets in the country so that the upcoming mediumpacers can bowl on them and get a feel of the different pitches they would bowl on while playing for the country in future, Srinath said at a symposium at Bombay Gymkhana. 

It is the fast bowlers who can change the course of the match and not the spinners, he added. Despite having good facilities, our mediumpacers lack in self-belief which is because they are frequently dropped due to some reason or the other, Srinath said. 

He felt Zaheer Khan was the best mediumpacer in the country. 

If properly groomed, we will have good fast bowlers in future, but for that we need to adopt the latest technological advances as fast bowling is all about energy, Srinath added. 

Srinath felt the need of a bowling coach for the Indian team. I think the bowling department can improve a lot if a bowling coach is appointed who can contribute by sharing his experience and skills with the players, he said. 

However, he categorically denied that he was in the race for the post. 

Meanwhile speaking in Lucknow, former captain Ravi Shastri expressed confidence that the Indian team would get all it needed from new coach Greg Chappell, to improve its performance. 

If the team needs vaccine, Chappell will provide them, Shastri, who was in Lucknow as Unicefs national goodwill ambassador for polio eradication, said.

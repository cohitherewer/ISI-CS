 Bellamy Road favourite 

 Kentucky: Bellamy Road can cap a phenomenal spring season on Saturday though, the 5-2 favourite, must battle some hard-to-ignore race history and 19 other horses in the Kentucky Derby.

 An easy winner of two races, the Nick Zito-trained colt has only been to the starting gate twice as a 3-year-old and the last time a horse won the Kentucky Derby with those credentials was Sunnys Halo in 1983. Earlier, Jet Pilot had managed the feat in 1947. (REUTERS)

London: Chelseas marauding start to the Premier League season continued as they came from behind to thrash Bolton Wanderers 5-1 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. 

Manchester United moved up to third with a 3-1 victory at Sunderland but Arsenals problems increased with a 1-2 reverse at West Bromwich Albion that leaves them 14 points off the pace. Tottenham Hotspur maintained their best ever start to a Premier League season with a 2-0 defeat of bottom club Everton at White Hart Lane to go second. 

Promoted Wigan Athletic also have plenty to celebrate after a 1-0 victory at home to Newcastle United that elevated them to the giddy heights of fourth. Chelseas last league loss came exactly a year ago at Manchester City and, for 45 minutes, Bolton Wanderers looked capable of snapping their 37-game unbeaten league run. 

Greek striker Stelios Giannakopoulos silenced Stamford Bridge with a fourth-minute opener and the visitors threatened to add to their tally before the break. 

The match turned completely in nine devastating second-half minutes when Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard both scored twice for the champions and Boltons Ricardo Gardner was red-carded for a deliberate handball on the edge of the area. 

Eidur Gudjohnsen completed the rout to maintain Chelseas 100 per cent start and keep them nine points in front of London rivals Tottenham. 

Wayne Rooneys classy finish gave United the lead at Sunderland just before halftime and Ruud van Nistelrooy made it 2-0 after the break only for Stephen Elliot to reply for the hosts. Italian teenage substitute Giuseppe Rossi sealed the points to keep United 10 behind Chelsea. 

Arsenal looked on course for victory at West Bromwich Albion when Swiss defender Philippe Senderos volleyed in after 17 minutes for his first goal for the club. 

But former Arsenal striker Kanu came back to haunt the Gunners with an equaliser before the break and substitute Darren Carter got the winner from 20 metres in the 76th minute. 

Meanwhile in Germany, Werder Bremen took over at the top of the Bundesliga with a 6-2 win at home to Nuremberg on Saturday, after Bayern Munich were held to a 1-1 draw in a dramatic finish away to Schalke 04. 

Bayern had been heading for victory over Schalke after taking the lead in the 19th minute through Roque Santa Cruz but Bastian Schweinsteiger gave away a penalty in stoppage time and Soren Larsen converted to snatch a point. Bayern then had Martin Demichelis sent off. 

The result meant Bremens victory over Nuremberg, featuring a hattrick from Miroslav Klose, was enough to take them to the top. With nine matches played, Bremen and Bayern have 22 points apiece, with Thomas Schaafs side ahead on goal difference. (Reuters)

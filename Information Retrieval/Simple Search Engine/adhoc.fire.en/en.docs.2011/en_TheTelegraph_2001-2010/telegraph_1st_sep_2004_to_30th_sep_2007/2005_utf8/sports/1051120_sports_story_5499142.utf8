The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ticket sales yet to pick up

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Though only a few days are left ahead of Fridays fourth ODI against South Africa at Eden Gardens, CAB officials feel sale of tickets will pick up gradually. 

The second day was a good one. Today the sale was around Rs 80 lakhs, CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal said on Saturday. 

But sources in CAB revealed that the sale was not as good as expected. The clubs havent taken their full quotas. 

We have seen this trend before. Ticket sales rise on the last two days of the match. We are not too worried about it, a CAB official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Russia are favourites 

 Myskina has set her sights on becoming world No. 1 

Perth: Marat Safin and Anastasia Myskina, the only Grand Slam champions in the eight-team field, will be hot favourites to win Russia?s first Hopman Cup when the ITF mixed team event gets underway on Sunday. 

With a knee injury keeping women?s world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport from joining James Blake for the US, the Russian duo are odds on to triumph at Perth?s Burswood Dome. 

Myskina arrived down under early in an effort to avoid a repeat of 2004 when she and Safin failed to make it through the group stage. 

Safin also lost in the group stage on his only other appearance, in 2001. 

?Hopefully Marat and Iwill do our best here because last year we lost and it was because of me most of the time,? smiled Myskina, who won her first Grand Slam title at the French Open last year. 

Myskina, one of three Russian women to win a Grand Slam title in 2004, said that she has set her sights on becoming world No. 1. 

?It was a great year for me and all the Russian girls with the Fed Cup, Grand Slam titles and (WTA) Championship,? she said. ?That (world No. 1) is my goal for next year and if I can achieve that goal that would be great.? 

Russia will take on Argentina, Italy and Germany in Group A of the round robin stage, while the US will face the Slovak Republic, Australia and the winner of Saturday?s play-off between the Netherlands and Zimbabwe in Group B. 

Guillermo Coria and Gisela Dulko lead Argentina?s challenge, while Tommy Haas spearheads Germany?s title bid after he regained his place in the world?s top 20 in 2004.

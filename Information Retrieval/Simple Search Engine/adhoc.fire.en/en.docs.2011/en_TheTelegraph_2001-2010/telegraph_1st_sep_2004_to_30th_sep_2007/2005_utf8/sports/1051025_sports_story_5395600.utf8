 Fletcher?s swipe at Gavaskar

 London: England coach Duncan Fletcher has flayed batting maestro Sunil Gavaskar for his ?derogatory? remarks about England?s performance after their last tour of India, saying he had lost respect for him after those comments.

 In his book Ashes Regained ? the Coach?s Story, published on Monday, Fletcher said the former Indian skipper had not appreciated how well England played in India, ?especially as we were missing so many key players.?

 He quotes Gavaskar as saying: ?Why our cricket board is keen on having a five-Test series when England visit India next is beyond comprehension, for, without the slightest doubt, they are the most unattractive and boring side to have played in India.?

 ?After these comments, I lost respect (for Gavaskar),? the coach said.

 Fletcher said the comments might have been made because ?he (Gavaskar) had a problem with the English press rather than the cricket team.?

 Fletcher made the reference to Gavaskar after recalling remarks of International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed about England?s use of substitutes during the recent Ashes series. (PTI)

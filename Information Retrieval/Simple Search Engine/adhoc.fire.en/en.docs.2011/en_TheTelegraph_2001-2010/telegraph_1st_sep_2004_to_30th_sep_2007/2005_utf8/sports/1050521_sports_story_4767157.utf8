 Arjun 13th

Manila: A flawless back nine with three successive birdies saw Arjun Singh finish strongly and tie for the 13th place in the $200,000 Philippines Open golf tournament on Friday. 

Arjun, who was tied eighth last week in Macau. Is the best among the eight Indians, who entered the Philippine Open, of whom five made the cut on a difficult day for scoring. 

Firoz Ali (tied 34th), Vivek Bhandari and Shiv Kapur (both tied 51st) and Digvijay Singh (tied 60th) made the cut, which came at five-over 147. Mukesh Kumar, Gurbaaz Mann and Uttam Singh Mundy missed the weekend rounds. 

Thai veteran Boonchu Ruangkit produced vintage golf to grab the halfway lead after three-under-par 68. Boonchu carded five birdies against two bogeys for a two-day total of four-under-par 138 and leads by one stroke from overnight leader Andrew buckle. 

Former Philippines Open champion Felix Casas and Juvic Pagunsan, raised local hopes by ending the day two off the pace in equal third place with American Ron won.

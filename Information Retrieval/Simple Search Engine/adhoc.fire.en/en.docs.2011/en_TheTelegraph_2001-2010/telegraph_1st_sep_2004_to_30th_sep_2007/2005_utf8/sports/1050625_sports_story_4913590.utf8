London: Brooding Russian Marat Safin skulked off Court One on Friday, his Wimbledon dreams shredded by a Spanish left hander who serves and volleys. A rare species back home where clay is king, 26th seed Feliciano Lopez produced stunning grasscourt tennis to win 6-4, 7-6, 6-3 in less than two hours. 

It was all too much for the combustible Safin who angrily thrashed one ball clean out of the arena after missing two break points in the first set. 

I couldnt really find my game against him today... what do you want me to do? I cannot play my best tennis every day, said Safin, who was troubled by a nagging left knee injury. 

Later, Andy Roddick returned to Centre Court and finished off Daniele Bracciali 7-5, 6-3, 6-7, 4-6, 6-3 to reach the third round in a match spanning two days. 

Roddick had led the Italian by two sets to one when poor light forced the pair off court on Thursday evening. 

Bracciali, a lucky loser from qualifying, broke the man with the worlds fastest serve to take the fourth set 6-4 but Roddick punched back in the fifth, taking it 6-3 with his 23rd ace to clinch the win. 

Runner-up last year and second seed, Roddick will face Russias Igor Andreev on Saturday. 

There were no hiccups for the mens and womens third seeds. Lleyton Hewitt scurried through. The 2002 champion edged out unseeded American Justin Gimelstob 7-6, 6-4, 7-5 in an entertaining Centre Court tussle. 

Amelie Mauresmo continued her smooth progress, flowing into the fourth round with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over American Shenay Perry. As the predicted storm clouds gathered around the All England Club another moody Russian, Anastasia Myskina, came through a crackling third-round match against Jelena Jankovic. 

The feisty 2004 French Open champion won the first set in 19 minutes, squandered three match points in the second and then clawed back a 5-1 deficit in third. 

With the rallies growing ever more intense and both players stretching every sinew, Myskina eventually came through 6-0, 5-7, 10-8 the final set lasting 86 minutes. 

The ninth seeded Myskina plays compatriot Elena Dementieva who made light of a sore shoulder to beat Mashona Washington 7-5, 6-1 and set up a repetition of last years French Open final. 

I did not even think I would be able to play here because of my shoulder injury but Im so pleased to be here, even if Im not playing my best tennis, said Dementieva, who was forced to withdraw from last weeks Ordina Open in the Netherlands. 

The small army of Russians in action on Friday also included US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, the powerful fifth seed getting a fright against 16-year-old Czech Nicole Vaidisova before scraping through 7-5, 6-7, 6-2. 

Elena Likhovtseva came from behind to beat Italian Silvia Farina Elia 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 and will now play Mauresmo. 

Mauresmo, a semi-finalist on her last two appearances, has dropped just 11 games so far and she is beginning to fancy her chances. 

It gives me a lot of confidence to play like this, she said. I feel my game is great on this surface and well see where it takes me. 

Mahesh-Todd exit 

Sixth seed Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge of Australia were shown the door in the second round of the mens doubles on Thursday (As reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

The Indo-Australian pair went down to the unseeded pair of Stephen Huss of Australia and Wesley Moodie from South Africa 3-6, 6-7 (3-7) 3-6 late on Thursday. (Agencies)

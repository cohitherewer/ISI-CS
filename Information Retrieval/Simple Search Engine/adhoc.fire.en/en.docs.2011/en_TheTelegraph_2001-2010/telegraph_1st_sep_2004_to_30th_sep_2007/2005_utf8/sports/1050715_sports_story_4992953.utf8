 Pietersen gets the nod

 Kevin Pietersen 

London: England selectors picked Kevin Pietersen ahead of Graham Thorpe on Thursday for the first Ashes Test against Australia starting on July 21, opting for youth over experience. 

The selectors had been agonising over the decision and chose the flamboyant 25-year-old Pietersen because of some dazzling performances in recent one-day matches against Australia. 

David Graveney said the decision had been one of the most difficult he had had to make as a selector with both batsmen making compelling cases for selection. 

Ultimately we have opted for Kevin because of the form he has shown against Australia, Graveney said. 

The selectors do not view this decision as marking the end of Graham Thorpes international career, Graveney added. 

He has been one of our most impressive performers with the bat since he returned to Test cricket in 2003 and subject to form and fitness he will continue to come under consideration for the remainder of the Ashes Test series.

 Harikrishna out

Lausanne: Grandmaster P. Harikrishnas chances of claiming the Lausanne Young Masters International title here on Sunday ended as he drew the second semi-final against GM Andrei Volokitin of Ukraine. 

Having earlier lost the first of the two-game mini-match, Harikrishna had a tough task of pulling one back as the Ukrainian displayed fine defensive technique. 

The Indian was never really in the game to make it to the tiebreak stage and settled for the draw to be 0.5-1.5. 

Harikrishna will now battle it out for the third place against former World Junior Champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan while Volokitin will vie for the top honours against US champion Hikaru Nakamura. 

In the contest for 5-8 places, status quo was maintained as higher seed GMs Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Magnus Carlsen of Norway accounted for Georgian Nana Dzagnidze and German Elisabeth Paehtz fairly easily.

 Dare You Say may beat Ankole 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: The two horses who look best to be involved at the finish for the 1200m Wynad Plate, Wednesdays feature event for runners rated 30 and above, are Dare You Say and Ankole who finished behind Chill Pill on the opening day. Chill Pill is also in the line-up but the G.Sandhu-trained filly is out-handicapped.

 However, Dare You Say seems to be in a good nick now and the six-year-old may reverse the order. Warren Singh partners the Mallikarjuna-trained ward.

 Italian clinches longest stage

 Paolo Savoldelli of Italy after clinching the 17th stage on Wednesday 

Revel: Giro dItalia champion Paolo Savoldelli completed a near-perfect Tour de France for Lance Armstrongs Discovery Channel team when he won the longest stage in Revel on Wednesday. 

The 32-year-old Italian outsprinted breakaway companion Kurt-Asle Arvesen of Norway at the end of the 239.5-km stage from Pau to give the six-time champions team their third stage win of the Tour. 

Australian Simon Gerrans took third place and Frances Sebastien Hinault was fourth. 

Race leader Armstrong, on course for a record seventh Tour victory before he retires, finished in a bunch of riders some 22 minutes later, his overall lead intact. 

Discovery Channel won the team time trial in the fourth stage while George Hincapie won the hardest mountain stage in Pla dAdet on Sunday and the American outfit also leads the team classification. 

For the last year, everything has been going well for me since I joined Discovery Channel. When were not leading the Tour for Lance, we always manage to have one guy going for the stage victory, Savoldelli said. 

The more I see Lance, the more I tell myself there is only one like him. Hes on another planet. 

Armstrong, who leads Italian Ivan Basso by 2:46 overall, has yet to win a stage, a situation he is expected to correct on Saturday in the penultimate stage, a 55.5-km individual time trial. 

The wind blowing strongly on the flat, straight roads of south-western France split the bunch and a group of 17 riders moved into the lead, never to be seen again by the main pack, who were happy to relax after the mountains. 

The 17 took a maximum lead of 23 minutes over the bunch when eight of the escapees broke clear, 43 km from the finish. 

They were Savoldelli, Arvesen, Gerrans, Hinault, Spaniard Oscar Sevilla, Dutchman Bram Tankink, Urkaines Andryi Grivko and Italian Daniele Righi. 

In the final climb, seven km from the finish, Hinault ? who is not related to five times champion Bernard Hinault ? attacked and was quickly joined by Savoldelli. 

They were caught by Gerrans and Arvesen two km from the finish and the stage was set for a final sprint between the four.

 Narain: Driving new car an exciting prospect

 - BELGIUM GRAND PRIX

 Karthikeyan hopes to close gap with teams in front 

Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium): Narain Karthikeyan will be hoping that a combination of new car and history help him turn around his fledgling Formula One career as the team head to the Belgium Grand Prix here over the weekend. 

Jordan will come to Spa-Francorchamps with two ej15b for Karthikeyan and his teammate Tiago Monteiro, who had actually driven his previous race at Monza with the new car. 

Belgium carries good memories for the team, the scene of some of the teams greatest results as well as the drivers personal milestones. 

In 1998 Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher finished first and second; Giancarlo Fisichella took second place in 1997, with the team having achieved its first pole position with Rubens Barrichello in 1994. 

It is also the circuit where both Karthikeyan and Monteiro have won F3 races and where Jordan have scored more points than at any other circuit. 

I will be driving the new car in Spa, hence I am very excited, the Indian said. I won the F3 in Spa and I enjoy the circuit a lot. Therefore, I am eagerly looking forward to having the opportunity to drive the ej15b. 

There is more downforce in Spa than at Monza, so our car should be more competitive there and hopefully we will be able to close the gap with the teams in front. 

Located in the Ardennes Forest, Spa-Francorchamps is a fantastic track that is a favourite among the drivers. 

Monteiro said, Spa is probably one of my top three favourite tracks. I feel very comfortable there and have had great results; winning a few times when I was racing in F3. 

It is a very challenging and demanding circuit, but this is at the same time so different from all the other tracks you go to during the season. It is a great pleasure for a driver to be at Spa. We think our new car will be better in Belgium than it was in Italy. 

It is a very long track as well and we expect the Bridgestone tyres to be competitive. Therefore I am looking forward very much to racing at Spa. 

Unpredictable weather conditions often add to the excitement of this circuit, where there can be torrential rain at one end of the track whilst it remains dry at the other end. (Pti)

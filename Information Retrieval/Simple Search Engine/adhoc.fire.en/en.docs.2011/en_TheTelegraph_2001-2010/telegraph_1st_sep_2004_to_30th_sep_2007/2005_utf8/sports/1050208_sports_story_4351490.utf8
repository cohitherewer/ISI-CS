The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Aussies confirm one-day berth too

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Australia ?s 2-0 victory over Pakistan in the final of the tri-series has confirmed their participation in the Johnnie Walker ICC Super Series one-day matches in Melbourne in October, according to a ICC release. 

The Super Series will pitch the best team in the world against an ICC World XI in three-one day matches and one Super ?Test?. The cut-off date for the selection of the best team is April 1, but the win over Pakistan means that second placed New Zealand can no longer overhaul Australia?s lead before this date. 

 This means Australia will take on the ICC World XI in both forms of the game, having secured its Test berth with a series win over Pakistan in January.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chelsea claim League Cup

Cardiff: Chelsea claimed their first silverware under Jose Mourinho on Sunday, beating Liverpool 3-2 after extra time to win a rollercoaster League Cup final. 

The Portuguese coach was forced to watch alone inside the stadium after being sent from the dug-out for inciting Liverpool?s fans, but he had the last laugh as goals from Didier Drogba and Mateja Kezman clinched a victory that had looked unlikely for much of the afternoon. 

The Premier League leaders were stunned after just 43 seconds when Norwegian John Arne Riise thumped Liverpool ahead from a cross by Fernando Morientes. 

Despite overwhelming possession, Chelsea could find no way through a resolute Liverpool defence for the next 78 minutes, but were handed a lifeline from an unlikely source. 

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who had minutes earlier wasted a glorious chance to put Liverpool 2-0 ahead, rose to defend a harmless-looking Paulo Ferreira free kick only to deflect it past goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. 

Mourinho immediately became involved in unsavoury scenes behind his dug-out with Liverpool fans as he gestured by putting a mocking finger to his lips before being sent down the tunnel. 

Both sides had chances to win it late on, Chelsea?s Frank Lampard lashing one shot over the crossbar and Liverpool substitute Milan Baros slicing horribly wide in stoppage time.

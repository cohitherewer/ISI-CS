 Ever-Ready lift Kalinga Cup

Cuttack: Ever-Ready won the all-India Kalinga Cup football tournament beating local challengers State Sports Hostel 2-0 in the final at Barabati Stadium here on Wednesday. 

After a goalless first half, the Calcutta team struck through skipper Eugene Gray in the 77th minute. Chesting the ball down nicely, Gray flicked the ball home past onrushing custodian Santosh Das. 

Two minutes later, Sheikh Habib Ali scored from a solo effort. He dribbled past three defenders before putting the ball into the net. 

The unheralded State Sports Hostel team, which had created a stir by registering five consecutive wins including one against Mohammedan Sporting in the semi-final, had two good scoring opportunities.

 India fail to make final 

Kuala Lumpur: Defending champions India lost the crucial match against Malaysia 0-1 after questionable decisions by the neutral umpires in the under-21 junior hockey tournament here on Saturday and failed to enter the final. 

A distraught Indian coach Harendra Singh was clearly upset with two yellow cards and another decision to disallow a field goal by India. 

Nitin and Vivek Gupta were shown yellow cards by the umpires from Australia and New Zealand. 

A goal by Ajitesh off a deflection was also disallowed by the umpires. ?It was a clear goal, but it was disallowed,? coach Harendra Singh said. 

The win put Malaysia in the title-round against Pakistan on Sunday while India will play South Korea for the bronze medal. (PTI)

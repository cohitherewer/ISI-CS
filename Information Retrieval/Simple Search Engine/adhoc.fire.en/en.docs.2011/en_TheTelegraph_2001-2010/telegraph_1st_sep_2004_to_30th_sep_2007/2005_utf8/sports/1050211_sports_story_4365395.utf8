The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No player said no to Eden tie: Steve

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Aussie legend Steve Waugh, Thursday rubbished suggestions that players? unwillingness to play at Eden Gardens led to the calling off the second fund-raiser against Asia XI. 

?The board didn?t have enough time to fit in the schedule. The players were desperate to play in Calcutta. Not for a split second did the players say that they were not interested in playing at the Eden. I hope the match will be on at some point of time,? said the ICC XI coach. 

In the city to raise funds for the tsunami affected, he said he wished to visit the tsunami-affected areas some time. 

The former captain is now working on setting up a school for visually impaired girls here in collaboration with the Christian Blind Mission and the Orthodox Church. 

?I am also in the process of setting up the Steve Waugh Foundation. We?re hoping to get the foundation up and running shortly, trying to rope in big corporate bodies. I want to make a difference in the lives of the people. I don?t want to look glossy,? he said.

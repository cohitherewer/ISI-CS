 Sania: Im not perfect

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Even Sania Mirza had to concede that her 6-2, 6-2 win over Japanese qualifier Junri Namigata in the first round of the WTA Sunfeast Open on Tuesday was not an easy one. 

She made heavy weather of an easy scoreline with too many double faults and first serve errors. 

It was not an easy victory, she acceded during a post-match press conference at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. But I played better when it really, really mattered. It was a good first-round win for me to get warmed up for the tournament. 

I was satisfied with my performance, and it wasnt as easy as the scoreline looks. 

There was no getting away from the inevitable query on the double faults, she laughed and shot back: You guys are never satisfied, are you? Im not perfect, you know! Yes, I did commit double faults. But what is more important is that I never got broken. 

As for the crowd: Its amazing, she said. The atmosphere was great. So many people cheering you on can only motivate you to give 120 per cent. 

But she was about to be even more amazed when one scribe informed her that she was actually part of the syllabus of a school in Chattisgarh, with a chapter dedicated to her in their schoolbooks! 

Really, an amused Sania said. I didnt know about that, but if its true, Im honoured! 

Back to ground zero. What about Wednesdays match against Melinda Czink? 

I really havent thought about it. I just want to get a good nights sleep and be ready for tomorrow. I havent played her before, so well see how it goes, she signed off.

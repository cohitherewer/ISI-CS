The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Temples on Kaneria ?agenda?

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: The Bal Thackerays, perhaps, will 

be pleased to know that one member of the Pakistan squad isn?t just interested 

in sight-seeing and shopping, but visiting temples too. 

One is, of course, talking of Danish Kaneria ? the 

first Hindu to play for Pakistan since Anil Dalpat in the Eighties. 

?Jahan ho sakta hai, wahan main mandir mein zaroor 

darshan karoonga,? Kaneria, whose roots are in the vicinity of Surat, told 

The Telegraph on Sunday evening. 

Asked whether he intended visiting the Kali Temple either before or during the Calcutta Test, Kaneria replied: ?Why not? Mauka mila to bilkul jaunga...? 

The leggie, by the way, has already visited a temple: ?I prayed at one during the Dharamshala match... Bahut accha experience tha...? 

Unlike some teammates who have been accompanied by their family, the Karachi-based Kaneria doesn?t have wife Dharmita for company. 

?Our first child (Parisa), after all, was born only a few days before the squad left and, so, my wife can?t travel... I have no choice but to be content with telephonic conversations,? he remarked. 

This is Kaneria?s first visit to India.

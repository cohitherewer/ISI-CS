 Am unlikely for first Test, says Langer

Melbourne: Australian opening batsman Justin Langer has admitted his broken rib is likely to keep him out of the first Test against the West Indies. 

Langer broke the rib in a domestic one-day contest at the weekend and had been given until Tuesday to prove his fitness ahead of the opener of the three-match series, which starts at the Gabba in Brisbane on Thursday. 

One-day batsman Mike Hussey has been placed on standby as cover for Langer, who said on Monday his West Australian teammate was now likely to earn his first Test cap. 

If its anything like this morning, I dont think Ive got that much chance, Langer said in Brisbane on Monday. 

Its pretty sore and its a lot worse than I thought it was when I spoke to everybody on Sunday. 

Im not so worried about getting another hit in the ribs. Its just the fact that its hard to run and its hard to breathe. 

You can be as optimistic as you like. But I saw the intensity and the way the guys trained this morning and if Im not up to 100 per cent, I wouldnt be playing on Thursday. 

Langer said he had been advised to rest for 10 days, making him available for the second Test in Hobart on November 17. 

Theres not a lot you can do, he added. What the medicos are saying is if I give it seven to 10 days to heal, then it should be almost back to 100 per cent. (REUTERS)

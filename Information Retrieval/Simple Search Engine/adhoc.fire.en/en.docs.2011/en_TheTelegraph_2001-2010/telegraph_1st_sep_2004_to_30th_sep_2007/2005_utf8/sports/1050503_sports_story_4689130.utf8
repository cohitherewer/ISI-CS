London: Teenaged striker Wayne Rooney helped Manchester United to a thumping 4-0 win at Charlton Athletic on Sunday to move within a point of Arsenal in the sprint to next season?s Champions League. 

A day after Chelsea won the Premier League title with a 2-0 win at Bolton Wanderers, the race for European soccer continued with United?s win and a 5-1 victory for Tottenham Hotspur over Aston Villa which moved Spurs into a provisional Uefa Cup slot. 

Paul Scholes opened the scoring for United after Charlton ?keeper Stephan Andersen spilled a Rooney shot in the 34th minute and Darren Fletcher rifled in the second just before halftime. 

Both United?s second-half goals came on the break, with Alan Smith adding a cool finish and Rooney getting on the scoresheet with a neat flick past a stranded Andersen on 67 minutes. 

Charlton?s day ended on an even sourer note with an 85th-minute red card for Chris Perry for dragging down Wes Brown as the United defender bore down on goal. 

Chelsea have won the league with 88 points, Arsenal are second on 74 and United are third on 73 with three games left to play. The second-placed finishers are guaranteed a place in next season?s Champions League while the third-placed club must go through the final qualifying round. 

Further down the table, Spurs have 51 points and are seventh on goal difference ahead of Middlesbrough ? who they face next Saturday at the Riverside in their penultimate game of the season. 

Spurs were 3-0 up inside the opening half hour after two goals from Mali international striker Frederic Kanoute and one from captain Ledley King, while Gareth Barry pulled one back from the penalty spot for Villa just before the break. 

Andy Reid added the fourth with a superb 20-metre strike and Stephen Kelly completed a miserable afternoon for Villa?s stand-in keeper Stefan Postma with a close-range effort on 90 minutes. 

Barcelona restored their six-point lead over Real Madrid in the Primera Liga as a spectacular strike from Samuel Eto? and a cool finish from substitute Lionel Messi contributed to a 2-0 win over Albacete. 

The African Player of the Year notched up his 22nd goal of the season when he cracked a stunning first-time shot into the far corner to break the resistance from a stubborn Albacete. Messi added a second with a delicate chip in the final minute. 

With four games to play, Barcelona have 78 points. Real follow on 72, a distant 14 ahead of Sevilla who gained the edge in the race for the remaining two Champions League places with an emphatic 2-0 win at home to Deportivo Coruna. 

Earlier Villarreal got their bid for a Champions League place back on track by crushing Getafe 4-0 at home to notch up their first win in five games. 

Juventus kept pace with AC Milan in the Serie A title-race with a 2-1 win over Bologna on Sunday that left the two clubs level at the top before their head-to-head meeting next week. Goals from Fabio Cannavaro and Marcelo Zalayeta gave Fabio Capello?s side a win which lifted them to 76 points and alongside Milan who beat Fiorentina 2-1 on Saturday. 

Four rounds remain in the season and, if the teams remain level on points, they face a two-leg playoff.

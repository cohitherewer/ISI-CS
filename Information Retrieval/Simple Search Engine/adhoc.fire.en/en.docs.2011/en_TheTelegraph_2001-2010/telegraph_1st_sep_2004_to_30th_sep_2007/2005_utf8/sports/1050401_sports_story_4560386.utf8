The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India thrash England 5-1

 Sandeep Singh scored a brace 

Kuala Lumpur: Defending champions India Thursday thrashed England 5-1 in the six-nation junior hockey tournament. 

Captain Prabodh Tirkey scored from a penalty corner, while two field goals by Ajitesh and two brilliant penalty corner conversions by Sandeep Singh fashioned India?s thumping win. 

Thursday?s convincing win comes after the unfortunate incident of the umpire handing out two yellow cards to India on Wednesday during their clash against Pakistan which led to the holders playing with only nine men in the crucial last few minutes, eventually losing 2-3. 

?Today?s win was most important for us. The boys were all charged up. They had realised the mistakes they made in their matches so far and played as a team,? coach Harendra Singh said. 

Ajitesh displayed both skill and agility when he dived to collect the ball from Adam Sinclair and netted it. His second goal was also a swift dive to the right as he gathered a pass from Hari Prasad and converted it. 

?Ajitesh?s goals were fascinating to watch, he expedited beautiful connections and got two excellent goals,? the coach said. 

Harendra picked penalty corner specialist Sandeep Singh for special mention.

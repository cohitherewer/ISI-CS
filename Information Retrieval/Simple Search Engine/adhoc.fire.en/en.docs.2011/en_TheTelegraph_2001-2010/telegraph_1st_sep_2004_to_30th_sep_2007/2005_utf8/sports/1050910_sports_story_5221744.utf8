 Current Brazil attack can challenge the best

 Adriano, Ronaldinho and Robinho celebrate Brazil rsquo;s win over Argentina in the Confederations Cup final

Ronaldinho, Kaka, Ronaldo, Adriano, Robinho: What a treasure of riches Carlos Alberto Parreira has at his command. Ronaldo and Ronaldinhos calibre we already knew. Over the past 12 months, the new kids on the block have blossomed for their clubs and country, so much so that everyone is expecting the Brazilian flower to be in full bloom during the World Cup finals next year in Germany.

 The most striking feature of this quintets style is their attacking flair. They create opportunities with silky touches, they finish off moves with rare brilliance. And they make everything look so simple.

 Ronaldo and Adriano are out-and-out strikers, the other three operate from behind but are equally goal-hungry. The problem is to fit them all in into the XI. The system followed by football coaches have changed significantly over the years. The 4-2-4 or, at times, even 3-2-5 formation were prevalent during our time when there would be at least four men upfront with two on the flanks and two in the middle. 

 Casting my mind back to the late 50s and early 60s, I can recall the great Pele spearheading a five-man attack along with Tostao, Vava, Didi and Garrincha. What a potent force that was!

 Subsequently, the focus got shifted to the midfield where you now have four or sometimes five men in place. Versatility is the modern mantra. One has to be prepared to cover two-thirds of the ground so that he can function as a defender, a half or a striker as and when the situation demands. This is the era of allrounders.

 In such a scenario, its not prudent to start with three or four attack-minded players. One of these five will have to sit out. If I were the Brazilian coach, I would follow a policy of rotation so that every footballer gets a break.

 Going a bit deeper into the matter, Ronaldo and Adriano give the team the cutting edge with their ability to conjure goals. Robinhos scoring skills are yet to be fully established, but I have already seen his ability to be an excellent support player, so I would use him alternately as a medio and striker. 

 Two of the trio (Ronaldo, Adriano and Robinho) would be in my starting XI. Ronaldinho is 60 per cent an attacker, 40 per cent midfielder, while in Kakas case its 40:60. I would like Kaka to start all games for Brazil, fitness and health permitting. Ill handle Ronaldinho a bit more carefully with Robinho filling up his slot as an attacking midfielder at times.

 I dont think Parreira will be losing sleep over this problem of plenty. He is a shrewd coach and will certainly know how to use these five skillful footballers to get optimum results.

 It may be a trifle too early to pass final judgment, but this group of Brazilians could well establish themselves as one of the best all-time attacks. Having said that, let me add had one of them been a genuine winger, they could have been an even more deadly force. I mean a real speedy winger in the Thierry Henry mould who can beat defenders by sheer pace and carry the ball from the centreline to the rival goalline, thus scaring the wits out of the opposition.

 Roberto Carlos and Cafu are good at overlapping, but it has to be kept in mind that their job is 70 percent defending and 30 per cent attacking. Theres nothing like a speedy winger to generate pace and momentum into a teams forays.

 Looking at the scene back home, Mohun Bagans revival is most heart-warming for the sake of Bengal football. A club with such tradition was bound to turn around at some point of time. An experienced coach and a welcome focus on football on the part of officials, forgetting their internal squabbling, are the two significant factors behind this revival.

 The team is a good mixture of youth and experience, with the most important department ? the midfield ? looking to be in good hands. Dharamjit has got speed and energy, Noel Wilson is a hard-running boy who can pass well and has defensive qualities too, Mehtab is a big-hearted footballer who has matured over the last two-three seasons. 

 Then there is Tomba Singh and not to forget Basudeb Mondal. Age may have robbed him of speed but his self-confidence, ball-control and distribution skills are still coming in handy.

 Subrata Pal is a great prospect under the bar, though he still has a thing or two to learn, for instance, when to give the charge. Mehrajuddin Wadao can develop into the countrys most dependable central defender.

 Du (Eduardo Coelho) was a trifle slow and hesitant when he first donned Mohun Bagan jerseys, but he has picked up since then. Getting a decent foreign striker has been a boon for Mohun Bagan. 

 Rodrigues biggest asset is that he moves into goal-scoring positions and has a nose for goals, just like Cristiano Junior had. 

 Whenever Rodrigue is being tightly marked, the midfielders, Dipendu Biswas and Manjit Singh are utilising the gaps to do the needful. Mohun Bagan are riding the crest of a wave. My advice to the players would be to try and make it last longer. The winning habit they have developed should not be lost.

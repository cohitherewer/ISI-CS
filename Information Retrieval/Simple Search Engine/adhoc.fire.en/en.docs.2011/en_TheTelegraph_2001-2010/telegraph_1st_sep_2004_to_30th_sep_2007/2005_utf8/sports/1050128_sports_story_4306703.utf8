The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhajji deadline 

London: The ICC on Thursday said the deadline for the BCCI to submit its report on Harbhajan Singh?s bowling action has been ?revised? but declined to give the revised date. 

[A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Earlier, BCCI secretary S K Nair said that the Board had sought an extension of the six-week period ? operational from the last day of the Chittagong Test ? to review and correct Harbhajan?s action following a delay in receiving the relevant video tapes.] (PTI)

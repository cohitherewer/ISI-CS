London: Manchester United look destined to extend their record run of appearances in the group stage of the Champions League after comfortably beating Hungarian champions Debrecen 3-0 in the first leg of their third qualifying round tie on Tuesday. 

There were also first-leg wins for Spanish duo Villarreal and Real Betis, plus Wisla Krakow, Rangers and Valerenga. A further 10 ties will be played on Wednesday. 

The prize for the 16 winners is a place in the group stage of the Champions League, and the millions of pounds that come with it. The losers will have to settle for a slot in the Uefa Cup. 

Visitors Debrecen arrived on the back of an 8-0 aggregate victory over Hajduk Split in the second round but they were never a factor at Old Trafford. 

Wayne Rooney got Uniteds season under way with a low shot after seven minutes, Ruud Van Nistelrooy scored the second four minutes into the second half and Cristiano Ronaldo capped an excellent individual performance with the third in the 63rd. 

A reduced crowd of 51,701 watched the game, more than 15,000 short of capacity, with many fans boycotting the match in protest at the clubs takeover by American tycoon Malcolm Glazer. 

A few miles west tickets were like gold dust for Evertons return to the continents premier competition after 34 years and their first European match since 1995. 

However, the occasion ended in anti-climax for the locals with a 0-1 home defeat by Villarreal. Everton were surprise fourth-placed finishers in the Premier League but found their spirited efforts not to be enough against a classy Villarreal side making their first appearance in the competition after finishing behind Real Madrid and Barcelona last season in Spain. 

Superb goals by Argentina striker Luciano Figueroa (27) and midfielder Josico (45) either side of a close-range effort by James Beattie put the Spanish side, formidable at home, firmly in the driving seat. 

Real Betis left it late against Monaco after missing a host of chances in Seville as Edu struck in extra time to clinch a 1-0 win over the 2004 runners-up. 

Rangers, knocked out at this stage last season, look better positioned to go through this time after winning 2-1 in Cyprus against Anorthosis Famagusta with two goals in five minutes midway through the second half by Nacho Novo and Fernando Ricksen. 

Valerenga will take a 1-0 lead into the second leg against Club Bruges after Steffen Iversons 57th-minute effort gave them victory on the night in Oslo. (REUTERS)

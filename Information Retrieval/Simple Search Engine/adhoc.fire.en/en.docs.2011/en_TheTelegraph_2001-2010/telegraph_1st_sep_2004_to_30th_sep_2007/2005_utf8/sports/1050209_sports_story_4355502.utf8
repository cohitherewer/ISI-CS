 Miandad planning to move court

Islamabad: Not satisfied with the Pakistan Cricket Board?s (PCB?s) explanation that it was the home series loss to India last year which led to his removal as the national coach, Javed Miandad is planning to move court. 

?My lawyer had sent the board a notice few weeks back in which he had asked them to properly explain the reasons behind my contract?s termination prematurely (in June). The board asked for some time and finally sent its reply but my lawyer is not satisfied with their explanation,? the former skipper said. 

?Basically, my lawyer had sent them the notice because he wanted an explanation from PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan for some of the statements he had made on my removal as coach.? (PTI)

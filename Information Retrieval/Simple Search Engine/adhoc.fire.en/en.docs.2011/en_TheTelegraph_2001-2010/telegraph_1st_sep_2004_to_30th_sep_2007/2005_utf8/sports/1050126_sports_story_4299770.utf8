The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Beaten Agassi ponders future 

 Melbourne: Roger Federer said he played the perfect match in his 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 thrashing of Andre Agassi at the Australian Open on Tuesday. 

He broke Agassi?s serve once in each set and, despite having to fend off break points on his own serve, won virtually every key point to seal a surprisingly one-sided victory. 

?For me it was a perfect match,? Federer said. ?Everybody knows how quickly matches can turn around and for this reason I was happy to win the first set. That kind of gave me just a little bit of cushion. 

?I served through the whole match perfectly. So I think that?s what made me win the match today.? 

Federer credited Agassi for his performance, saying the American had brought out the best in him. ?I really had to concentrate very hard today, which didn?t really allow me to enjoy the match too much.? 

Agassi, meanwhile, was considering his future. The 34-year-old four-times champion, who departed Melbourne Park as a loser for only the fourth time, would not be drawn on whether he will return. 

?I plan to be back, but a year?s a long time,? he told reporters. ?It?s hard to say right now. You know me. I have to play it by ear and make some good decisions.? 

Agassi gave little away as he waved to the crowd on his departure from Rod Laver Arena but with his 35th birthday just three months away, he knows time is against him. 

?It?s disappointing,? he said. ?I?ve spent a lot of years coming down here and having some real memorable matches and leaving with the trophy. I wanted tonight to be memorable but it?s one I?d probably prefer to forget.

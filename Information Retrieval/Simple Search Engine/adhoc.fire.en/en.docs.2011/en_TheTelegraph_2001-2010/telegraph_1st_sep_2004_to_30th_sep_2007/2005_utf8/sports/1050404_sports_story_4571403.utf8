 Railways clinch title

 Yere Goud remained unbeaten on 138 

Mohali: Railways clinched their second Ranji Trophy title by virtue of first innings lead over hosts Punjab in the Elite Division final here Sunday. 

Railways, whose second innings ended at 471 on the final day of the match, set Punjab an improbable target of 518 runs which were to be achieved in just less than two sessions of play. 

Punjab, who had conceded a first innings lead of 46 runs after being bowled out for 309 in reply to Railways 355, had reached 137 for four in 47 overs before play was called off. 

This was Railways? second Ranji title win after their maiden triumph in 2002. It was frustrating final day for the home side, who were desperate to bowl out Railways as soon as possible to have a go at the target. 

But overnight batsman Yere Goud, who hit a fluent unbeaten 138, and the tail-enders ensured that the visitors, who resumed at 362 for eight, bat their opposition out of the match. 

Goud, who hit 16 fours and a six in his 288-ball knock, added 42 runs to his overnight score to guide Railways and he got ample support from Harvinder Singh (26) and last man Madan Yadav (38). 

The hosts, chasing the huge target, had a shaky start when they lost their top three batsmen for just 52 runs. Retinder Singh Sodhi, who opened the innings, was caught by wicketkeeper Sudhir Wankhede off the bowling off captain Sanjay Bangar for 15 with the team?s score reading 32. (PTI)

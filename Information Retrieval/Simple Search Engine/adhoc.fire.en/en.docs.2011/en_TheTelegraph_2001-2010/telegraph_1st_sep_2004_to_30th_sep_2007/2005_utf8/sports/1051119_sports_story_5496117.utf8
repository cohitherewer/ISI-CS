 Lets focus on juniors for 3-4 yrs

 Bhaichung could have made a difference in Kerala

This is turning out to be a bleak year for Bengal football. Our heavyweight clubs bowed to Goan power in the National Football League and, more recently, were dumped out of the high-profile Federation Cup in the early stages. And now, the Santosh Trophy debacle.

 Bengals two drawn games in the cluster stage ? 2-2 with Nagaland and 1-1 with Mizoram ? underlined the fact that the north-eastern states are ready to challenge the supremacy of traditional powerhouses.

 Having squeezed into the quarter-final league stage, Bengal needed to beat Maharashtra. But despite dominating the first half, when they should have scored at least twice, Bengal let Maharashtra win 2-0.

 Maharashtra didnt have too many big names, but they showed an intense desire to succeed. It was quite like the determination and resolve that any Goan side shows while taking on an outfit from Bengal these days.

 Blaming coach Aloke Mukherjee for Bengal failing to reach the semi-finals makes no sense. He was given a squad of players to be led by Bhaichung Bhutia. The striker practised with the rest of the squad for quite a few days before being ruled out of the championship due to a technical problem.

 Bhaichung belongs to a different league and could have made a difference in Kerala with his inspirational play. The administration has to take the rap for picking a player and not being able to ensure his participation for no fault of his.

 As in all disciplines, a coach is only as good as his team. And the fact is, Bengal do not have a team which can brush aside the resurgent and motivated units from Goa and Maharashtra.

 Bengal was once the nursery of Indian football, but I can see the talent pool drying up rapidly. The middle-class is turning its back on the game and focusing on cricket and studies.

 We still have the best goalkeepers in Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Kalyan Chowbey and Subrata Pal. But other than that, you will struggle to find a son of the soil who can walk into the first XI of the Indian team.

 During the past decade or so, our clubs have won the National League or other all-India tournaments powered by foreign-power. The Chimas, Barretos, Okoros and Douglas da Silvas made the difference more often than not as Mohun Bagan and East Bengal won six of the first eight NFL titles.

 The administration has quite relished this scenario as the likes of Barreto and Okoro have proved to be huge crowd-pullers. Im not against our clubs recruiting quality foreigners, but the fact is, except for a handful of names, most of these imports have been of sub-standard quality. They have hardly enhanced the standard of soccer here. In fact, with the clubs retaining most of the foreigners despite their mediocrity, the growth of local talent has been stunted.

 I have been saying this for some years now, and I will repeat it: the only way to go forward is for the IFA to unearth local talent and groom them properly through regular long-term training programmes.

 The best way to go about it will be to curtail our ambition for a few years. We have won the Santosh Trophy more times than any other state, not adding to our collection over the next three-four years wont affect our record. Instead, let us fully focus on developing the state under-15, 17, 19 and 21 sides. If that is properly done, well get rich dividends in the not too distant future.

 Already, I can hear murmurs around India that teams from Bengal struggle away from their den. A quick look at the results over the last couple of years will show that there is some merit in such talk. Unless we take serious corrective measures, and soon, it will get established that we are tigers only at home.

 Vaughan unlikely to participate

Multan: England cricket captain Michael Vaughan was unlikely to recover from a knee injury before the teams first Test against Pakistan in the coming series, a team official said on Wednesday. 

Michael remains very doubtful for the first Test, but will continue to travel with the squad, said England teams media manager Andrew Walpole. The first Test begins on Saturday in Multan, hometown of Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq. 

 Players and officials from both teams arrived on Wednesday morning from Lahore, where Pakistan A defeated England by six wickets in a three-day warm-up game on Tuesday. Vaughan twisted his right knee during Englands second innings against Pakistan A on Monday, when he sprinted for a run and fell at the non-strikers end. 

The England and Wales Cricket Boards medical experts consulted radiologists and orthopaedic specialists about the injury after the reports of the scans were sent to England on Tuesday. 

Michaels orthopaedic specialist in the UK has viewed scans of his knee ... And the advice we have received is that he should rest, the board said. 

Also on Wednesday, the England selectors named Essex opening batsman Alastair Cook as cover for Vaughan. (AP)

 Alonso set for history

 - BELGIAN GP 

 Montoya eyes constructors title 

 Alonso needs to score four more points than Raikkonen 

London: Renaults Fernando Alonso needs to score four points more than McLarens Kimi Raikkonen to become Formula Ones youngest champion on Sunday. 

Even if McLaren have won the last three races, and have clearly the quickest car, the 24-year-old Spaniard knows he has a good chance to put the title beyond all doubt at Spa-Francorchamps. 

I will be going to Belgium to win ? and we will see how the weekend develops from there, said Alonso, who is more than a year younger than Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi was when he became the youngest champion in 1972. 

Leader of the championship since the second race in Malaysia in March, Alonso is close to journeys end with three grands prix to spare. 

Alonso has 103 points, Raikkonen 76. In 15 Grands Prix so far, Alonso has beaten his Finnish rival by at least four points on six occasions while also celebrating six wins. 

Raikkonen was triumphant in Spa last year, and Alonso has yet to finish a Formula One race there, but the daunting rollercoaster of a circuit is the Spaniards favourite. 

Raikkonens hopes were dealt a cruel blow in Italy last weekend when an engine failure cost him pole position and forced him to fight to fourth place from 11th on the starting grid. 

He, and Colombian teammate Juan Pablo Montoya need to end McLarens five-year run without a one-two finish and score maximum points in the last European race of the year. (Reuters)

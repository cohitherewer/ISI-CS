 Pargat blasts IHF president, secy

 Pargat Singh 

Jalandhar: Even as the stage is being set for the much awaited election of the office-bearers of Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) to be held Monday in Calcutta, former Olympian and skipper Pargat Singh Sunday alleged that the combine of IHF president K. P. S. Gill and secretary K. Jyothikumaran has ruined the game. 

If you take a look at the performance of Indian hockey team during the last 11 years, tenure of Gill as IHF president, the team has not won any big international event except the Asian Games in 1998, Pargat said here, while claiming that both Gill and Jyothikumaran have no moral right to continue in their post. 

On the uncertainty over whether Gill would seek another term in office or not, Pargat termed it a drama and said: I do not find any such good gesture from the IHF president and moreover, if he wished so (not to seek another term), what was the reason to advance the elections by 11 months? 

As under the current scenario, the opposition is weak and divided, Gill and Jyothikumaran want to make use of such a situation by conducting the elections in advance, Pargat said. (PTI)

Calcutta: If there was any confirmation necessary on Bhaichung Bhutia?s professionalism, it was dispelled Saturday. He wasn?t the most mobile, neither was his onfield visibility worth noting. Yet, when it came to the crux of the matter, it was his fine, clinically executed side-volley that fetched East Bengal full points from their National Football League ONGC Cup match versus Salgaocar. 

The rest of the match can be described in three parts: a tale of misses, rank bad supervision, and a drudgery of something called football. 

As East Bengal caoch Subhas Bhowmick said after the match, and pretty dramatically too: ?It was by far the toughest match East Bengal has had this season, and I had predicted that this would be so?? Not that he had predicted the misses and poor supervision parts. 

Possibly the only player who stood out through the match was Salgaocar deep defender John Dias. It remains a mystery why Bhaichung got the Man of the Match award instead. 

Misses started in the 13th minute when a faulty clearance at the East Bengal goalmouth put Samson Singh in possession. Singh tried an excellent back-volley but East Bengal custodian Rajat Ghosh Dastidar parried well. 

Douglas da Silva was playing a defensive screen, with Alvito D?Cunha doing the game-making spadework. It didn?t help the speed of the midriff. And Salgaocar were finding space up the wings, with resultant infringements deserving yellow cards that referee Deepak Dey of Assam seemed not to notice. 

The second half picked up some momentum. Shylo Malsawmtluanga replaced new Brazilian recruit Juliano Pasoarolo Martins in the striking region. Juliano failed to play up to the reputation that preceded him, being somewhat slow on the uptake. 

At the other end, Dias was giving off his best, thwarting the many East Bengal attacks with sheer determination, and sans rough edges too. 

Bhaichung showed once showed a touch of genius in the 61st minute when he sent a touch classy centre to Alvito at the goalmouth. Alvito was too slow to react. 

In the 77th minute Jerose Oliveira had loped into the East Bengal box and was about to strike when Sasthi Duley tripped him. Protestations by Oliveira came to no avail, with referee Dey failing to notice. 

Four minutes later Malsawmtluanga was in the rival box, lifting to the goalmouth. Bhaichung played a dummy as Climax chested the ball down. Then he failed to shoot into the untenanted goal. 

Samson centred to the East Bengal goalmouth and Bernard Pires, with only goalkeeeper Ghosh Dastidar to beat, let the goalkeeper have the last laugh. 

In the 81st minute Habibur Rehman Mondal sent a throw-in near the Salgaocar box. The high, loose ball was back-headed by Douglas, who had finally moved up. Bhaichung made that half-chance pay, with his volley that beat the entire defence hands down. 

The sparse crowd at the Salt Lake Stadium cheered. Happy, finally. 

?Misses like this won?t help us,? said Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira later. ?It?s what Bhowmick says, ?one point is better than none?? we much keep gathering those points, no point in just playing well.?

Liverpool won the Champions League final on penalties and Wednesday should really have won this intriguing, if unfulfilling Group G tie on spot-kicks. Three times they appealed for legitimate-looking penalties but three times their pleas were ignored by the Italian referee, Massimo De Santis. 

If all draws are equal, this goalless one seemed more equal for Chelsea. Away from home, and constantly under pressure from a fired-up Liverpool, Jose Mourinhos side was clearly delighted with the point and even brought on Roberth Huth for Didier Drogba, centre-half for centre-forward late on as they shut up shop. 

Inevitably in a spat between the champions of Europe and the champions of England, few niceties were observed when loose balls were contested. Frank Lampard, John Terry and Claude Makelele and Xabi Alonso were all cautioned for nasty lunges. But the real offences, the penalty-box fouls on Sami Hyypia, Luis Garcia and then a hand-ball by William Gallas, went unpunished. 

Liverpool, who stay top, can take great pride from their performance, and their fans saluted Steven Gerrard and company at the final whistle, while deriding De Santis. 

This absorbing collision of contrasting cultures unfolded into a fascinating tactical duel embodied in the battle between Makeleles defiance and Gerrards ambition. 

As Liverpool kept a high line and a high tempo, as Gerrard kept running at Makelele, the hosts enterprise made a mockery of Mourinhos belief that Benitezs side would sit deep and play on the counter. 

Cautious? Liverpool? No chance here. Not with the Kop in full voice. Not with Gerrard so determined to pile into last nights visitors because of the speculation about me and Chelsea for two years. With the outstanding Alonso and Didi Hamann the mobile holding men, Liverpool were set up tactically and temperamentally to flow forward. Gerrard played the advance clearing house behind the willowy and willing Peter Crouch while Garcia and Djibril Cisse attempted to insinuate themselves behind Chelseas fleet full-backs. 

Nip and tuck, pace and parrying, neither side could find a way through, for all the urgings of both sets of supporters. Chelsea have been constructed into a formidable machine by Mourinho, with the smoothest of midfield engines pumping through the industrious limbs and minds of Lampard, Makelele and Michael Essien. 

With Drogba struggling to win the physical battle against the stout-hearted Jamie Carragher, Chelsea lacked a high-class outlet, although Arjen Robben made inroads down the flanks. Racing on to one Lampard pass, Robben cut inside Hyypia and let fly venomously. Reina, reacting brilliantly, flicked the ball over into a relieved Kop.

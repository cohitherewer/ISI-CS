 Arjun tied 8th

Macau: Arjun Singh finished tied eighth at the $ 275,000 Macau Open golf tournament here on Sunday. 

Arjun carded a four-under 67 on the final day to finish with a total of eight-under 278, as the 42-year-old Wang Ter-Chang of Chinese Taipei emerged victorious by just one stroke over the Australian duo of Jarrod Lyle and Marcus Both, who made a fine charge with 67 and 66, respectively. 

Wang turned in a card of three-under-par 68 for a total of 14-under-par 270 on a wind-swept day at the Macau Golf and Country Club. (PTI)

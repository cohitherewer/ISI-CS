 Ponting backs Warne

 - He?s subject to closer media scrutiny than others: Aussie captain 

 Warne claims he tried to get under Matt Prior?s skin because of the way he chested Simon Katich during a collision 

Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting on Thursday came out in support of Shane Warne over the sledging controversy in English county cricket. 

Ponting said he intended to call Warne to find out exactly what happened but pointed out that the leg-spinner was subject to closer media scrutiny than other players. 

?Unfortunately for Shane he?s always going to be in the media spotlight, there?s nowhere for him to hide for that, and quite often a lot of the things that he?s involved in are highlighted and bigger issues are made of them,? Ponting said. 

Sussex captain Chris Adams said Warne, captain of Hampshire, verbally assaulted English fringe batsman Matt Prior at Hove last weekend. 

?I have lost a lot of respect for him because of the way he behaved,? Adams had said after the altercation. 

But Test cricket?s leading wicket-taker claims he had a pop at Prior because the latter had ?chested? Warne?s Australian and Hampshire teammate Simon Katich, when the pair collided. 

?I tried to get under Prior?s skin because of the way he chested Katich on the field,? Warne told a London daily. ?I am sick and tired of being cast as the villain because English captains give one side of the story,? Warne had spat back. 

?I thought cricket was a non-contact sport. I was sticking up for my mate and letting Prior know what I thought about his behaviour. I think Adams needs to put his own house in order before he goes complaining to newspapers.? 

The controversial leg-spinner has a history of sledging ? most famously in 1993 when he gave South African batsman Andrew Hudson an ugly send-off in a Test match. 

But Ponting said his side had reduced sledging significantly since October 2003, when the players abolished personal insults directed at opponents under Cricket Australia?s ?Spirit of Cricket? code. 

?I think certainly in the public?s eyes, but more importantly I think everyone who you speak to involved in the game have been really impressed with what we?ve been able to do to our on-field attitudes,? Ponting said at a Cricket Australia (CA) press conference here on Thursday. 

CA chief executive James Sutherland said he was concerned about Adams? allegations as a captain-against-captain complaint, but indicated he would take no action against Warne, who was ?well-versed? in the players? code. 

?I think if you have a look at Shane?s record in international cricket over the last year and you ask Ricky ? he?s been out on the field with him ? I would have thought that he?s subscribed very well to the players? spirit of Australian cricket,? he said. 

The latest controversy involving Warne comes as England prepares to host Australia in the Ashes series starting in July. (AFP)

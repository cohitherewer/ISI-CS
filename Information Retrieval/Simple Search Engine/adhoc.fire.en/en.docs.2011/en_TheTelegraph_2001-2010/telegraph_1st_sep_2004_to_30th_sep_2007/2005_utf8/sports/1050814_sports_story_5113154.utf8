Carson: Maria Sharapovas ascent to world No. 1 is on hold, but only temporarily. 

The 2004 Wimbledon champion, vying to become the first Russian woman to capture tennis top spot, pulled out of the $585,000 WTA tournament on Friday with a painful pectoral muscle. 

She withdrew just hours before her scheduled last-eight clash with Daniela Hantuchova, knowing that a victory would have seen her vault past injured American Lindsay Davenport to the No. 1 position when the rankings are released on Monday. 

I said if I was going to wake up with any kind of pain and with a feeling that I cant play 100 per cent, then I would have to unfortunately withdraw and that was the case, she said. I didnt find any miracle cream. 

But with Davenport nursing an injury, the leggy 18-year-old can still expect to see her name atop the rankings before the US Open which begins on August 29. 

Indeed, Sharapova is still on course to becoming the 15th player and fifth-youngest to reach the coveted throne when the rankings are released Monday after next. Of course its a dream come true to be able to win a Grand Slam and be number one in the world, she said. It definitely puts a smile on your face. 

While Sharapova remains entered in next weeks WTA meet in Toronto, she said it was unlikely that she will play there. But she was unperturbed at the prospect of reaching the top of the rankings while sitting on the sidelines. 

The computer doesnt lie, Sharapova said. You have to achieve something in order to get there. Its been an amazing two years. Its been all hard work and dedication. The achievement is amazing. 

Sharapova said she originally suffered a strained right pectoral muscle in Zurich last October, blaming a switch to heavier balls. 

Although she pronounced herself healthy prior to this event, the injury flared up in a practice session on Monday, prompting her to have an MRI on Wednesday. She said she played in pain in Thursdays 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 victory over compatriot Anna Chakveadze. It has been an on and off problem for me, said Sharapova, who said the injury interfered with her serve and her powerful forehand. 

Sharapovas injury followed earlier withdrawals of Davenport, Serena Williams, Mary Pierce, Vera Zvonareva, Elena Likhovtseva and Ai Sugiyama. 

Fans turning out for the late night session were still able to collect their Sharapova bobblehead dolls, but the Russian they saw on court was third seed Elena Dementieva. She made short work of Italian Tathiana Garbin 6-1, 6-1 to book a semi-final clash with Hantuchova. 

Fifth-seeded Belgian Kim Clijsters advanced to the semis with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over fourth-seeded Russian Nadia Petrova.

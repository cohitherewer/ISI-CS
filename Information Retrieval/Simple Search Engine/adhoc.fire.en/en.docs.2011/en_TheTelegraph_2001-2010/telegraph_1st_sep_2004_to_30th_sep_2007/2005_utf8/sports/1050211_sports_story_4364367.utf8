 Zico faith in domestic players puzzling

Tokyo: Japan coach Zico left for his native Brazil on Thursday a highly relieved man after his team?s 2-1 win over North Korea in a World Cup qualifier. 

While he can point to three points as proof his methods are working, however, Zico?s puzzling decision to keep faith in J-League players almost cost Japan dearly on Wednesday. 

Only a scrambled injury-time goal from substitute Masashi Oguro spared Japan?s embarrassment in their opening match in the final round of 2006 qualifiers. 

?We did our job and that was to take three points at home,? Zico told reporters. ?It was a very tough game but we have to keep our feet on the ground and take it one step at a time.? 

Zico dropped captain Hidetoshi Nakata and British-based midfielder Junichi Inamoto even though both players have proved their recoveries from lengthy injuries. 

Hamburg striker Naohiro Takahara and Reggina?s Shunsuke Nakamura were left out of the starting line-up in Saitama despite their recent good form. Takahara scored twice in Hamburg?s 3-1 win at FC Nuremburg last weekend and made it clear he was unhappy at having to travel to Japan to be named among the substitutes. 

Zico stuck by the players who had beaten Syria 3-0 in a warm-up game a week earlier. 

It nearly backfired as Nam Song-chol cancelled out Mitsuo Ogasawara?s early strike in the 61st minute and North Korea had clear chances to win the game. 

Zico offered to quit a year ago after Japan needed another injury-time goal to beat Oman in the previous round of World Cup qualifiers. He is still no closer to finding a system in which he can accommodate his best players.(Reuters)

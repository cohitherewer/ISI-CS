The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Steve?s new ?innings? begins in Dubai today

 - Icon and his entourage to reach Calcutta on February 9 Interaction with 

 corporates on the cards 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The iconic Steve Waugh is going to take the first steps towards becoming a full-fledged entrepreneur when he and his three-member entourage interacts with top-bracket businessmen in Dubai on Thursday. 

The former Australian captain (and the most capped Test cricketer-ever) left Sydney on Wednesday and, after three days in that glitzy Emirate, will land in Mumbai for the India-leg of a very different tour. 

?Steve and I are travelling with two powerful men from the banking industry? We intend featuring in joint-ventures, but this trip is largely to study the feasibility,? manager Robert Joske told The Telegraph. 

Somewhat understandably, Joske didn?t go into specifics. As he put it, shortly before departing from Sydney: ?Right now, that wouldn?t be proper?? 

Steve and his entourage are going to spend two days in Mumbai before heading for Bangalore and meeting corporates there. They?re expected in Calcutta on February 9, the journey from Bangalore possibly being made on a private jet. 

?We will definitely be in Calcutta for a couple of days? However, it?s undecided whether we?re going to return home from there or go back to Bangalore/Mumbai/Dubai one more time,? Joske informed. 

The appointments with businessmen in India, one understands, have been arranged by the trade wing of the Australian High Commission (in New Delhi). 

Incidentally, that Steve will be coming to Calcutta with an entourage was reported in these columns on January 10. 

While in Calcutta, Steve is going to take time off from pre-arranged one-on-ones and interact with corporates at the Oberoi Grand on the night of February 10. 

That will be preceded by a ?formal talk? from Steve himself and is going to be followed by a tsunami fund-raising fashion show where the designer dresses (from the likes of Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Kiran Uttam Ghosh) worn by models will be auctioned. 

The show and the accompanying dinner ? tables, mind you, have to be reserved against a fee ? is being organised by the Calcutta Foundation in collaboration with a newly-formed NGO (Together, We Will).

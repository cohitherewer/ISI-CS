 I have quite enjoyed captaincy stint

 - Surprised myself a bit in Pakistan: Trescothick 

 'SIMON BRIGGS 

 Trescothick showed a steady hand in Pakistan 

Marcus Trescothick may have endured a trying time as Englands emergency captain in Pakistan, but it has not been enough to completely turn him off the idea of being Michael Vaughans long-term successor. 

Trescothick led England under sufferance after Vaughan returned home for a knee operation. And suffer he did, at least during the central period when England lost three successive matches and with those, the one-day series. 

It has been hard work dealing with the losses, he said, but overall Ive quite enjoyed the captaincy. I surprised myself a bit. I dont know yet whether it has changed my thinking on whether Id be interested in the job full-time, but Ill sit down over Christmas and have a think about it. 

Since the latest round of injuries, the question of Englands succession has become a bit more urgent. Vaughan is determined to have a tilt at the 2007 World Cup, but his troublesome knee may not last much longer than that. Trescothick, the most loyal of lieutenants, is likely to have first refusal when he goes. 

Trescothick showed a steady hand on the tiller in Pakistan, especially when Englands consolation victory in Rawalpindi improved the one-day scoreline to 2-3. Afterwards he summed up the series, and tour, as a case of what might have been. 

The fact is, though, that the narrow margin flattered England. After a deceptively perfect start at Lahore, they were manifestly second-best, out-bowled and out-batted until Pakistan collapsed in that final dead rubber. 

England showed a lack of nous against spin and a dangerous over-reliance on Andrew Flintoff. But, in their defence, they were missing four or five first-choice players and handicapped by an erratic itinerary. 

The players looked bleary-eyed for the second match, after staying up for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show, and under-prepared for their brief visit to Karachi. 

If you asked England to name their World Cup XI tomorrow, they would probably be confident about eight or nine players. 

The top six batsmen pick themselves, as do Geraint Jones and Steve Harmison. If Ashley Giles recovers from hip surgery, he gets in ahead of Blackwell, as much for his batting and fielding as anything else. 

The biggest question mark relates to the seam attack: who will line up alongside Flintoff and Harmison? 

England would love to get Simon Jones involved, but he has played precious little one-day cricket and will need to learn fast over the next year. 

Anderson is a contender, but a bottom three of Jones, Harmison and Anderson would run counter to coach Duncan Fletchers emphasis on tail-end runs. This is where Plunkett could fit in. England have been looking for a seam-bowling allrounder since the departures of Craig White and Mark Ealham, and it seems they might have found one. 

Finally there is the supersub ? assuming the rule has not been dropped by next spring. The likelihood is that the small print will be gently tickled, allowing both teams to pick 12 men and announce the identity of the sub after the toss. 

England would thus be able to play a seventh batsman, probably Vikram Solanki, and leave one of the top four fuming in the dressing room when their turn came to bowl. Imagine being a fly on the wall while that one was thrashed out.

 Kapil reserves comment 

Hyderabad: All the four former cricketers ? Greg Chappell, Tom Moody, Sandeep Patil and Mohinder Amarnath ? being considered for coaching Team India, have their own strengths, said legendary allrounder Kapil Dev. 

All four have their own strengths and it is for the BCCI to finalise the name. I do not want to comment on the issue, Kapil, who was on a business promotional trip, said here on Wednesday night. 

On Sourav Gangulys form, Kapil said: As a skipper, he did a good job and as a batsman maybe he is passing through a bad phase. He should improve and do better. (PTI)

 Tiger chases history at St Andrews

 - It will take an entire career to catch up with Jacks 18

So far this week, it has been unseasonably warm ? it is Scotland, after all, where summer lasts a week or so ? but the forecast for the British Open calls for partly sunny and a chance of Tiger, maybe a very good chance. 

He won the Open Championship in 2000, the last time it was played on the Old Course, so Tiger Woods is the safe choice this week when the 134th edition of the worlds oldest major championship gets underway. 

And, as these things usually go, hes chasing history as well. Coinciding with Jack Nicklaus last British Open, Woods is trying to join Nicklaus as the only players to win all four majors twice. 

If Woods comes through this week, he will be the youngest to have accomplished the feat, beating Nicklaus by two years. 

No one has won the Masters and then the British Open at St. Andrews in the same year since Nick Faldo in 1990, but thats the job, if Woods is up to it. 

To get into the mood, Woods said, he had a scoring goal in mind. 

If I shoot 72 under, I should be pretty good, he joked. 

When he won here five years ago, 19 under was pretty good, and thats what Nick Faldo remembers. It was Faldos record that Woods broke. 

He wasnt worried about winning the British Open, he wanted to beat my 18 under, Faldo said, adding that he too was joking, then pointing out that Woods play this week is no joking matter. 

I think Tiger is the favourite, obviously. Hes played, hes won, and he comes here with a mission, as always, and his record of every event where Nicklaus is basically handing over the torch, hes the one who wins every time. So we shall see. 

When Nicklaus played his last PGA Championship at Valhalla in 2000, Woods won. And when Nicklaus played his last US Open at Pebble Beach in 2000, Woods won there too. Nicklaus also has indicated that he played his last Masters in April, and Woods won that one as well... 

I wish hed keep retiring, Woods said. Its been very good so far. 

And so has Woods, who has returned to No.1 in the rankings as he tries for his 10th major title. He will do it over a somewhat altered Old Course, site of the Open Championship for the 27th time since 1873. 

The new Old Course is 164 yards longer than when Woods beat it up five years ago, thanks to four new tees, including the extremely beefy par-five 14th. With 37 yards added, the hole is now 618 yards ? the longest on any British Open course. 

Woods doesnt sound intimidated. 

Any time you lengthen the golf course, you have to use driver more often, he said. But any time a longer hitter ? any golf course ? if a guy hits the ball further, hes going to have an advantage if hes hitting it well, even if its a short course. 

There is more than just a longer course, though. Woods has been reminded that he missed every one of the 112 bunkers on the Old Course in 2000 and that his 19 under was an Open record. There is the constant reminder that his record will be viewed in comparison to Nicklaus. 

With 18 major titles, Woods is halfway to Nicklaus record and even if he wins Sunday, hes not going to catch up this week. 

In order for me to ever have the opportunity to be lucky enough to have either tied or come near or past Jack, its going to take an entire career, Woods said. 

Its not something thats going to happen with a short period. 

So its going to take me awhile. At least Im heading in the right direction.

 Aussies aim to wrap it up

 - SECOND TEST vs NZ 

 McGrath needs 12 wickets to join the 500 club 

Wellington: Australia has the chance to compound hosts New Zealand?s misery by clinching the second Test starting here on Friday. A win would give the Australians a 2-0 lead in the three-Test series, following a 5-0 thrashing in the ODIs. 

New Zealand has to regroup after the first Test in Christchurch, where they suffered a nine-wicket drubbing after collapsing for 131 in the second innings. 

Opening Australian bowler Glenn McGrath, who changed the course of the first Test with a six-wicket haul in New Zealand?s first innings, will be eager to remind New Zealand who they are up against. 

?If we can make early inroads one way or the other if we bat or bowl, then the pressure will be straight back on.? 

McGrath and the rest of the formidable Australian attack will be looking to target New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, who has been in a form slump throughout the tour. ?We?ll be keen to get on top of him again,? said McGrath, who is just 12 wickets short of a career Test tally of 500. 

Besides a brittle batting line-up, New Zealand?s lack of penetrating pace bowling is a serious worry. Left arm spinner Daniel Vettori ? the one bowler to consistently trouble Australia ? continues to battle with his fragile back. 

New Zealand off spinner Paul Wiseman was 12th man in Christchurch but Fleming said he could be called in to partner Vettori. 

TEAMS 

Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn, Michael Clarke, Simon Katich, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee (12th man). 

New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Craig Cumming, Hamish Marshall, Lou Vincent, Nathan Astle, Craig McMillan, Brendon McCullum, Daniel Vettori, James Franklin, Iain O?Brien, Chris Martin, Paul Wiseman (12th man to be named).

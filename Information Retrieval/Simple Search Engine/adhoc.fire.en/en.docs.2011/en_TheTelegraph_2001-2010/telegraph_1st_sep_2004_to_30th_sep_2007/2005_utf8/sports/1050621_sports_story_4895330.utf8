 Sasikiran draws with top seed

Paks: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran held top seed Emil Sutovsky of Israel to an easy draw in the 7th round of the 3rd Marx Gyorgy Memorial grandmasters chess tournament here. 

Grandmaster Viktor Korchnoi, the 74-year-old player from Switzerland, regained the sole lead with a thumping victory over former world junior champion Peter Acs of Hungary in the category-15 double round robin event. 

The Swiss took his tally to 5.5 points out of a possible seven and was half a point clear of Zoltan Almasi of Hungary, who drew with compatriot Ferenc Berkes. 

Sasikiran and Sutovsky remained joint third with three points each after their none-too-eventful draw while Berkes improved his position marginally to move to fifth position on 2.5 points. (PTI)

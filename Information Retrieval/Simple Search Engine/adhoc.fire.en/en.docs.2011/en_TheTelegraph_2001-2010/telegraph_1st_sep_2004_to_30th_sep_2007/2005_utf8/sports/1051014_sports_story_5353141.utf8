 Uthappa excels

Mohali: Robin Uthappas cracking century in the Challenger Trophy here Wednesday has created a buzz but the youngster himself does not rate his knock among his best. The 19-year-old smashed 19 fours and two sixes during his 116 that laid the platform for India Bs thrilling win over India A. 

But despite the attention, the Karnataka player felt his century scored away from the limelight in a Ranji Trophy match last season as more endearing. I think my hundred against Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy was a better knock. It was a comeback match for me, it is where it all started, said Uthappa. 

I spent the entire day at the crease, and I learnt a lot playing alongside Rowland Barrington. I hold that innings close to me. 

A bit of sporting spirit runs in his vein. His father A E Venu Uthappa is an international hockey umpire. Robin himself dabbled in tennis and hockey in his childhood before taking up cricket full time. 

Robin has come through the age-group levels. And despite the fact that Karnataka team has been in transition, it has taken lot of hard work to cement his place in the side. 

It was difficult initially, I had to work my way through. I learnt a lot from being in the India under-19 side, he said. 

Uthappa impressed in an under-17 tri-nation series in Sri Lanka where he scored more than 300 runs in five innings, but the break came when he caught the eye of Dilip Vengsarkar during a stint at the National Cricket Academy, resulting in the call-up for under-19 World Cup.

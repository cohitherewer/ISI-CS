 National side prevented from using grounds

 - Chingoka under pressure to stand down

Harare: The embattled head of Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) Peter Chingoka came under renewed pressure to stand down on Friday after a ban was introduced to prevent the national team from using the countrys seven major cricket grounds. 

 The ban was imposed by the chairman from the seven provinces that make up ZC in support of the players who went on strike on Thursday. 

 The players downed tools and said they would not travel to next months Afro-Asian A-team tournament in Bangladesh unless Chingoka and managing director Ozias Bvute were dismissed, and money owed to them were paid. 

 Their action was fully endorsed by Zimbabwes provinces. 

 Charles Robertson, head of the country districts province, said: We want to give all the players our fullest support in their refusal to play in the Afro-Asian Cup in Bangladesh next month, as well as the forthcoming under-23 tournament in South Africa. 

 They took this decision because Chingoka and his managing director Bvute are still running ZC and they want them removed. 

 And we ourselves also want to oust Chingoka as well as Bvute so that an independent audit can be carried out into the dubious financial affairs of ZC. These two men are crippling the game here. 

The players were still awaiting a response from Chingoka after notifying him of their refusal to play in Bangladesh and South Africa.

 Haryana put Services on the mat

Gurgaon: Haryana piled on the misery of Services as they took command of the Ranji Trophy plate division final on Friday. 

The hosts, who restricted the opposition for just 191 runs in their first innings, made 136 for two in their second innings for an overall lead of 287 runs. At stumps, Sunny Singh (27 not out) and Ishan Ganda (18 not out) were at the crease. 

The third day entirely belonged to the hosts. Resuming at 102 for five, Services were immediately sent on the backfoot when they lost overnight batsman Sarabjeet Singh (9) with just one run to the total. 

Wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals as Joginder Sharma completed his five wicket haul ? finishing with five for 67 ? while Sachin Rana took three for 42. 

With a 151 run first innings lead, Haryana openers Bageshwar Bisht (37) and Chetan Sharma (45) played cautiously.

 Michigan (US): Only a tiny plaque on a small brick monument here commemorates 99-year-old ferry field as hallowed ground, the site of the finest hour in athletics thanks to the legendary Jesse Owens. Wednesday marks the 70th anniversary of Owens setting three world records and matching another within a span of 45 minutes, shrugging off back pain from a fall to produce the sport?s greatest one-day effort at age 21.

 Owens matched the 100-yard world record of 9.4 seconds at 3.15 pm, then just 15 minutes later took one leap and set a world long jump record of 8.13m that would stand for a quarter-century. The ?buckeye bullet? set a 220-yard dash world record of 20.3 seconds at 3.34 and at the top of the hour set a 220-yard low hurdles record of 22.6 seconds. Conversions showed Owens? longest runs broke world 200m records even though he ran 201.68m to set the times.

 Paris: Former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters will compete in the Eastbourne grasscourt championship (June 13-18) for the first time this year as part of her Wimbledon preparation. Clijsters, who romped through her first-round match at the French Open on Monday, is still seeking her maiden Grand Slam title.

 ?I?ve never played the tournament before but I?ve heard a lot of good things about Eastbourne from a lot of the players. I?m really looking forward to it,? Clijsters said on Tuesday. ?For me it is a great way of preparing for the Wimbledon fortnight. I?m really motivated and ready to play the grasscourt season.?

 Madrid: Real Madrid have denied making an offer for Juventus striker Zlatan Ibrahimovich. Media reports quoted the player?s agent as saying that the Spanish club had offered 70 million euros ($88.54 million) for the Sweden international. ?Real Madrid would like to make it clear that no one from the club, either directly or indirectly, has opened negotiations of any sort with the player?s agent, nor the Italian club, nor with the player himself,? Real said on their website on Tuesday.

 The club issued a similar statement recently denying that they had any interest in signing any players from Manchester United.

 London: David Beckham will miss England?s friendly match against the United States on Saturday in Chicago. The English FA had said previously that the Real Madrid star was doubtful for the match, and England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson confirmed it on Monday. ?Real Madrid want David to train with the club this week,? Eriksson said in a statement.

 Beckham is suspended from playing Real Madrid?s season-ending game this weekend, but coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo wants him to practise. ?We never expected David to be with us for the first game, and I understand and respect their view that they want him with them until the end of the season,? Eriksson said. Beckham and Michael Owen will play the second and final game on the US tour against Colombia on May 31 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 

 Cape Town: The feuding leadership of SA Rugby rejected a call on Tuesday for their resignation by South Africa?s sports minister Makhenkesi Stofile. Stofile had backed the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) which demanded that warring union president Brian van Rooyen and his deputies Andre Markgraaff and Mike Stofile ? the minister?s younger brother ? resign immediately.

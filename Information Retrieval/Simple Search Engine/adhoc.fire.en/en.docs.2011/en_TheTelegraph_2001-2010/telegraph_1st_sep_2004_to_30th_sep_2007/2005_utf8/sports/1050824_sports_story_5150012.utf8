 Owen rejects Everton bid

London: English Premiership side Everton have failed in a bid to lure Michael Owen from Real Madrid to Goodison Park. 

The former Liverpool hero has had talks with several Premiership clubs in the wake of Reals double swoop for strikers Robinho and Julio Baptista. 

But the 25-year-old has said he does not want to join Everton, whose Champions League fate will be finalised on Wednesday when they take on Villarreal in their third qualifying round second leg match in Spain. Everton trail 1-2 from the first leg. 

Everton boss David Moyes said, we have been in contact with Michael and his advisors ? and unfortunately he doesnt see Everton as a team he would choose at this present time. 

It is another snub for the highly-rated Moyes, who has also been turned down by Dutch striker Dirk Kuyt earlier this month. 

We offered ?10 million for Dirk Kuyt and that was rejected on August 1 by Feyenoord, said the Scot. 

Baros for Villa 

Czech Republic striker Milan Baros has completed his move to Aston Villa from European champions Liverpool, signing a four-year deal with the Premier League club on Tuesday. 

The 23-year-old will link up with fellow Czech Patrik Berger, who played a big part in his decision to join the midlands club, under manager David Leary. (AFP)

 Khalil?s leg-theory for Tendulkar

Dharamshala: Pakistan?s 22-year-old fast bowler Mohammed Khalil says he has ?studied? Sachin Tendulkar?s batting and discovered his weakness against left-arm bowling which he would try to exploit in the upcoming series. 

Left-arm pacer Khalil has drawn attention from all quarters. Parallels are even being drawn with legendary Wasim Akram. 

Khalil, however, has been humble enough to brush aside such comparisons. But he is keen to get at the Master Blaster, against whom even Akram had come a cropper. ?Yes, I have studied him (Tendulkar). More than me, my younger brother Akheel Mohammed,? said Khalil. 

Akheel runs an internet cafe in Lahore and, Khalil said the two had spent enough time surfing the net gathering information on Tendulkar, to whom the ball delivered from around the wicket at his ribcage or thigh pad had caused difficulty on more than one occasions. 

Left-arm spinners Ashley Giles of England and Ray Price of Zimbabwe, besides Pedro Collins of the West Indies, have successfully used the leg-theory to pin down Tendulkar. 

?We have studied every aspect carefully, and if I get to play I will use it in the match,? the pacer added. 

But Khalil was quick to acknowledge Tendulkar?s supremacy as batsman. 

?Dravid would be the prize scalp in Tests and Sehwag in one-dayers. But Tendulkar is great in both form.? 

Khalil said he admired his counterpart Irfan Pathan very much and the two have exchanged information over the years. ?Irfan has given me some good tips. Both of us are left-armers and I don?t have problems in learning from a young pro,? he said. 

?I have not talked to Irfan about bowling on Indian tracks. But then the tracks here and in Pakistan are somewhat similar,? Khalil observed. 

The youngster said he was looking forward to the first Test in Mohali to soak in the atmosphere. 

?Yes, I want to meet every one. If the heart wants to meet, then why not? ?Khoon to ek hi hai na? (the blood is the same, right),? he said. 

Khalil said he had lot of expectations from himself and that hopefully he would get a chance to be in the playing eleven.

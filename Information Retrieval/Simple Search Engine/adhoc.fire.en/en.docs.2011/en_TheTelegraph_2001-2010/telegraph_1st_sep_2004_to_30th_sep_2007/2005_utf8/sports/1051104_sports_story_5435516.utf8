 PCB slots Test, ODI in Karachi after all

Karachi: The PCB has drawn up a revised itinerary for Indias tour early next year. According to it, Karachi will host the third and final Test as well as the fifth and final ODI. 

A PTI report from Lahore a fortnight ago had said the PCB had agreed to a request from the BCCI that Karachi will host only a practice match during Indias visit to Pakistan. 

The fresh proposal, which has already been sent to the BCCI for approval, has the series starting with a practice game in Lahore (January 2-3). The 40-day tour ends with the Karachi ODI on February 11. 

Basically we have swapped the first and third Tests in the revised itinerary, PCBs director operations, Saleem Altaf said. 

The first Test has been scheduled from January 5 in Lahore, the second Test from January 13 in Faisalabad and the final Test in Karachi from January 21. 

The five ODIs have been proposed in Peshawar (January 28), Rawalpindi (January 31), Lahore (February 3), Multan (February 6) and Karachi (February 11). 

Altaf added that the PCB had not yet received any communication from the BCCI on the revised itinerary. 

PCB officials expect the Indian foreign ministry to clear Karachi as a venue for Test and ODI. (PTI)

 How practice makes perfect

 - Shane Warne sets example after nets with guru Terry Jenner 

DEREK PRINGLE

 Vaughan would like to have his sluggish footwork against the likes of McGrath and Lee corrected 

London: Shane Warne is bowling better than ever, reckoned his captain Ricky Ponting after Australia 239-run routing of England at Lords, words guaranteed to give one or two of the home teams batsmen the collywobbles before the second Test in nine days time. 

A fortnight earlier, Pontings eulogy about his champion spinner would have been unthinkable after Warne failed to prevent Middlesex from beating Hampshire in the championship ? a game in which Warne took two for 108 off 29.4 overs in the second innings. 

The word, as it filtered back to Lords before the first Test, was that his legendary accuracy, as well as some of the buzz-saw spin, had deserted him. Yet Warne, who had just returned from a break to sort out his private life, knew before anyone that something was amiss and called in his coach and guru, Terry Jenner. 

A wrist-spinner who played nine Tests for Australia between 1970-75, Jenner knows Warnes action well and immediately set about rectifying the flaws with a strenuous two-hour session in the Lords nets two days before the first Test. 

England captain Michael Vaughan, twice bowled during that match, is planning to have a similar one-on-one tutorial with Duncan Fletcher this week, presumably to correct the sluggish footwork that saw his defences breached by Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. 

Some coaches dont believe in tinkering with players techniques before a big match. Most players dont either, especially those with preternatural talent. But while Warne, currently the worlds highest wicket-taker in Tests with 589 wickets, is a virtuoso, he is not a prima donna ? at least not when it comes to working on his bowling. 

The public rarely see the effort sportsmen put in on the practice ground, only the end results. Warnes hard yakka in the nets mostly concentrated on his follow through. The problem, at least as it appeared from the sidelines, was that Warne had been falling away too sharply after releasing the ball. 

What Jenner did was to alter the length and direction of Warnes stride pattern so that his momentum, lead by his head, would continue on towards the batsmen rather than be pulled sideways. 

If the cause and effect mechanism here seems obvious, working on specific problems is mostly the remit of batsmen. Before the 1987 World Cup semi-final between England and India in Mumbai, Graham Gooch took one look at the dry, dusty pitch prepared for Indias spinners and decided the sweep was the only shot that was going to bring him runs. 

Instead of batting in the nets against Englands bowlers, Gooch summoned the locals to bowl at him. For the next 30 minutes he attempted to sweep every ball regardless of length or line. While teammates looked on perplexed, it became clear a day later when England won following 115 from Gooch, most of them from sweeps. 

Matthew Hayden worked on something similar on Australias 2000-01 tour of India. Although he had a reputation for bullying bowlers, he was considered vulnerable against spin. Like Gooch he practised sweep after sweep, including the slog sweep which during matches often sailed into the stands for six. The Test series is remembered for Indias 2-1 win, after one of the great fightbacks of modern times. Yet Hayden made 549 runs at an average of 109. 

Fed up with being kicked away by batsmen, and with umpires doing little to prevent it, Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan dedicated hours to perfecting the doosra, a ball that spins like a leg-break with an off-spinners action. 

The illusion quickly brought him a spate of wickets, as batsmen, used to negating his off-spin with their front pad, found they were being given out lbw. He even overtook Warne as the worlds greatest wicket-taker, though a moratorium on his doosra, while the International Cricket Council sorted out tolerance levels on elbow flexion for bowlers, meant he is behind again. 

Yet, as the great players above have shown, practice works best when you foresee problems in advance rather than react to them once they have happened, something Vaughans team may struggle to do now they are 0-1 down.

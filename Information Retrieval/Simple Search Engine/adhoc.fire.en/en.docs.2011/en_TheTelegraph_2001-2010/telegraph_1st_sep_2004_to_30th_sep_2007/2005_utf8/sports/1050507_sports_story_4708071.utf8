 Inzy speaks out against Shoaib

Islamabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has said that Shoaib Akhtar has a disciplinary problem and the fast bowler must improve his conduct if he hoped to make a comeback to the national team. 

Inzamam, quoting the report of the fitness trainer, admitted that fitness was one of the reasons for not considering Shoaib and added that disciplinary problems were also responsible for his omission. 

?Shoaib has disciplinary problems and I believe no player is bigger than the team,? Inzanam said in his hometown Multan where he had gone to attend a reception. (PTI)

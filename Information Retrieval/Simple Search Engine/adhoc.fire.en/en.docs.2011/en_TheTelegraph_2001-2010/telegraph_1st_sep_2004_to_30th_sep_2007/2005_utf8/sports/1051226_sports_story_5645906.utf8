 Laxman eyes first century versus Pak

 - They will probably give us seaming tracks 

 Laxman 

Mumbai: V.V.S. Laxman plans to practise on pitches similar to the ones in Pakistan in a bid to score his first century against the team during next months tour. 

They will probably give us seaming tracks, Laxman said, adding he intended to practice on pacy pitches in the next few days in his hometown of Hyderabad. 

In 2003-04, I got 71 in the third Test in Rawalpindi. This time, I intend converting 60s and 70s into hundreds, the 31-year-old said. 

India arrive in Pakistan on January 5 for three Tests and five one-day matches. They play a three-day warm-up match in Lahore, starting on January 7. 

Laxman has scored 428 runs, averaging 30.57, with four fifties, in nine Tests against Pakistan over three series in 1998-99 (home), 2003-04 (away) and 2004-05 (home). 

I thought I batted really well in the last series. But I was left stranded on 79 in the third Test in Bangalore and was ninth out for 58 in the first Test in Mohali, said Laxman. 

Pakistan won the final Test In Bangalore in March to level the three-match series 1-1. They went on to clinch the six-game one-day series 4-2, after being 0-2 down. 

Fortunes have improved for India and Laxman since then. 

The wristy strokeplayer scored a 140 against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in September, ending a 14-Test century drought. He added another against Sri Lanka last week to help India to a 2-0 home series victory. 

Pakistan come into the matches against India having beaten England 2-0 in a Test series and 3-2 in one-dayers. 

But Laxman was encouraged by the depth in batting of Indias Test squad. 

As a middle-order batsman, you definitely feel much more secure that you have got partners with you and that you wont get stranded like I have on more than one occasion, he said.

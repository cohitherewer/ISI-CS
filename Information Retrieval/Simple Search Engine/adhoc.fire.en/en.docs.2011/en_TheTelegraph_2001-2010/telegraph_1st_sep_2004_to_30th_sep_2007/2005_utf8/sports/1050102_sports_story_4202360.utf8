The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Cricket?s many faces of sympathy

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The tides of tsunami are lapping all shores. Besides organising fund-raiser cricket matches, the cricket fraternity intends to do more. 

The following are on the agenda: 

 Teams from Australia, England, New Zealand, 

Pakistan and South Africa agreed to donate signed memorabilia for auction in support 

of relief efforts. 

 Collections are also planned during the New 

Year?s Tests in both Australia and South Africa. 

 ACC has appealed to its member countries, especially 

those not affected, to come forward with generous contributions. 

 Cricket South Africa Pvt. Ltd has pledged a 

donation and the South African mobile phone network MTB, a co-sponsor with Castle 

Lager of Test cricket, will donate the proceeds from its match day ?SMS the scoreboard? 

phone line. A pledge line will also be in operation during the third Test match 

against England. 

 New Zealand Cricket (NZC) will donate $ 1 from 

every ticket sold to the 20-20 game to be played between Australia and New Zealand 

to the tsunami relief, while NZC?s ticketing partner, Ticketek will donate its 

share of the service fee on all the tickets for the unplayed matches directly 

to the World Vision fund. 

 NZC?s apparel supplier and partner Wstar will 

donate a portion of the sale price of all products sold at ground during the forthcoming 

Australian team?s tour of New Zealand.

 Chamindas complaint

Colombo: Sri Lankas pace spearhead Chaminda Vaas, struggling to be fit for the tri-series opener against India on Saturday, believes fast bowlers risk injuries by playing too much County cricket. 

For a batsmen its okay playing for Counties. You learn a lot of things and get a lot of opportunities, a Sri Lankan daily quoted him as saying. For a fast bowler it is not an easy job. Two or three months is all right, but more than that I wouldnt recommend. 

The grind of a packed County schedule takes too much of a toll on pacers who also have to play Test and ODIs, said Vaas.

 New Delhi: Encouraged by the international success of professionals like Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa, the Womens Golf Association of India (WGAI) was launched here on Thursday.

 The WGAI will provide a platform for talented Indian women golfers to perform on home ground so that they can make it to the Asian Tour and eventually the world stage.

 To begin with, the association, to be overseen by the Professional Golf Association of India, will organise a womens professional tour where sportswomen from other disciplines would also be encouraged to take part. 

 Tokyo: World and Olympic champion Justin Gatlin will compete in the 100m at this month?s IAAF track and field meet in Yokohama, organisers said on Thursday.

 The American, who won the 100-200 double at last month?s World Championships in Helsinki, is one of several top athletes set to appear on September 19. Pole vault world record holder Yelena Isinbayeva, who has broken the world record nine times this year and became the first woman to clear five metres, will also take part.

 China?s Liu Xiang, who won Olympic gold in the men?s 110m hurdles in Athens, is also scheduled to line-up.

 American captain Patrick McEnroe also named James Blake, Robby Ginepri and doubles team Bob and Mike Bryan on Wednesday for the tie at Leuven, Belgium, starting on September 23.

 McEnroe said he expected Roddick to take one of the singles berths and would choose between Blake and Ginepri for the other spot after evaluating their practice on the indoor clay surface.

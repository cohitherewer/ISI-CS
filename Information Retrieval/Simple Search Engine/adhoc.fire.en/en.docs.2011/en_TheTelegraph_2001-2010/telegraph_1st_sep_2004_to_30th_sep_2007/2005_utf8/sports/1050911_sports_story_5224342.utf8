 Former greats hail Anju

New Delhi: The athletics fraternity hailed the historic achievement of Anju Bobby George on Saturday who won the silver medal at the World Athletics final in Monaco. 

Anju won the silver medal in the womens long jump in Monaco last night (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). She jumped a seasons best of 6.75m, behind Russias Tatyana Kotova, who cleared 6.83m. American Grace Upshaw got bronze, leaping 6.67m 

This is a great performance and leaping 6.75 metres at such a prestigious meet is very creditable, former sprint queen P. T. Usha said. 

Her performances have improved as the season has gone on and may be next year she can do even better and reach her personal best of 6.83m, Usha said from Kozhikode. 

Ushas thoughts were echoed by another athletics legend, the flying sikh Milkha Singh, who said the lanky Keralite should not shy away from big events. 

She needs to test herself against the best in the world and not limit herself to smaller tournaments, Milkha Singh, who finished fourth in the 400m at the 1960 Rome Olympics, missing the bronze by only 0.1 seconds, said. 

Milkha, however, expressed concern that Anju had not been able to match her personal best of 6.83m she achieved at the Athens Olympics last year. 

Meanwhile, describing Anju Bobby Georges silver at the World Athletics final to be a big achievement, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) on Saturday said that it was planning to felicitate the ace jumper on her return. (PTI)

 Nairobi: Twice world half-marathon silver medallist Susan Chepkemei has been banned from all national and international competitions for the rest of the year, Athletics Kenya Chairman Isaiah Kiplagat said on Monday.

 Chepkemei, 29, failed to beat last Wednesday?s deadline to report to Kenya?s national cross country training camp in Embu, 250-km north-east of capital Nairobi, and was dropped from the team for the world cross country championships in France on March 19-20.

 ?We have banned her (Susan Chepkemei) from all local and international competitions including the London marathon (on April 17),? Kiplagat told a news conference. ?We shall communicate this decision to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and all meet directors all over the world. Her ban will run until December 31 this year.?

 Milan: Juventus midfielder Pavel Nedved is almost certain to miss his club?s Champions League second leg match with Real Madrid.

 Czech international Nedved has been in a clinic since suffering concussion in Juve?s 0-1 first leg defeat to Real in Madrid on Tuesday, when he clashed heads with Spanish defender Raul Bravo.

 Juventus said on Monday that after undergoing tests, Nedved had been released from the clinic but needed seven days of rest at home. The Italian club said further Tests would be made on March 8, just a day before the second-leg with Real, to decide when Nedved could begin training.

 Juventus face Roma on Saturday in Serie A.

 London: Robert Pires has joined a growing list of injured and suspended Arsenal players and will miss their Champions League match against Bayern Munich at Highbury next week, manager Arsene Wenger said on Monday.

 The French winger, victim of a lunge that earned Southampton?s David Prutton a red card in the teams? 1-1 draw on Saturday, will be out for up to three weeks with a sprained ankle.

 ?It doesn?t look like anything is fractured,? Wenger told the Arsenal website. ?But it is a good ankle sprain. It does not look like he will be ready for two to three weeks.?

 Frankfurt: Bayern Munich will have Germany captain Michael Ballack back when they continue their treble quest with a German Cup quarter final away to SC Freiburg on Wednesday.

 Ballack has been out since mid-February with a thigh muscle strain but he returned to training this week and coach Felix Magath confirmed on Tuesday that he would be back in the side for Bayern?s second trip to Freiburg in four days.

 Madrid: Spain international Carlos Marchena has signed a six-year contract extension with Valencia that will keep him at the club until 2011. The 25-year-old has become a permanent fixture in the centre of defence and helped Valencia to league titles in 2002 and 2004 and last season?s Uefa Cup. 

 Bangkok: German Siegfried Held has been sacked as coach of Thailand after less than six months on the job, the AFC said on Tuesday. 

 The 62-year-old had been under pressure after holders Thailand failed to advance from the group stages of the Tiger Cup last December. 

 Charnwit Polcheewin will take over from the former German international and become the fifth person to hold the post in the last 16 months.

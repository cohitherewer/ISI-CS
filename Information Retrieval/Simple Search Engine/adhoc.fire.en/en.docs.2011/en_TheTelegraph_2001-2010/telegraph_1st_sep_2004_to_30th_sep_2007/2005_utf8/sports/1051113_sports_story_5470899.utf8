Seoul: South Korea had to settle for a 2-2 draw with Sweden in a friendly on Saturday, but the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists did more than enough to suggest new coach Dick Advocaat has them on the right track. 

Ahn Jung-whan put South Korea in front after only eight minutes, controlling a Seol Ki-hyeon headed knock-down before rifling a left-footed volley low past Eddie Gustafsson from the edge of the box. 

The lead lasted less than a minute. Johan Elmander played a neat one-two with Niclas Alexandersson before slotting low into the corner of the net past a helpless Lee Woon-jae. 

South Korea dominated possession in the second half and went ahead in the 52nd minute, defender Kim Young-chul rising above the Swedish defence to nod home a Park Ji-sung free kick. Sweden hit back quickly, Elmander squaring across goal in the 58th minute for substitute Markus Rosenberg to sidefoot home from a difficult angle. 

Park came close to netting the winner for Korea five minutes from time, dragging a shot wide from inside the box. 

In Helsinki, Estonia scored twice in the last half-hour to salvage a 2-2 draw away to Finland in a friendly on Saturday, while Bulgaria stormed to a 6-2 victory over Georgia in Sofia.

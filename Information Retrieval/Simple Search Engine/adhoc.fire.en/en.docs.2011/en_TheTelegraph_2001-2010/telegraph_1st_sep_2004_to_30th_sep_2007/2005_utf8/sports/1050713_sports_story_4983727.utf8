Calcutta: For somebody in the eye of an international storm, Sourav Ganguly looked remarkably calm on returning to his home town, Tuesday, after almost two months in the UK. 

And, well, the rush for autographs (and photographs via camera phones) at the airport must have made the regular Team India captain feel at home straightaway. 

Busy exclusively with Glamorgan for the past six weeks, Sourav leaves for Bangalore in the early hours of Wednesday. 

Hes going to be back with the Welsh County after attending the first two days of the final conditioning camp for the 2005-06 seasons probables, being hosted by the National Cricket Academy. 

Souravs travel plans are such he wont miss a single match for Glamorgan, yet be around when coach Greg Chappell shares his vision with both the established lot and aspirants. 

For now, though, most of the attention is on what the International Cricket Council (ICC)-initiated arbitration holds for our most successful Test captain. 

Im not tense about being caught in no mans land? Ill go to Sri Lanka for the tri-series if the arbiter (Justice Albie Sachs) rules in my favour, I wont if he doesnt? 

The issue is beyond my control and Im not allowing it to weigh on me, he told The Telegraph. 

Till late at night, there was no word from the ICC about when and how the eminent South African judge would conduct proceedings. 

The world body, it may be recalled, appointed Justice Sachs after a plea from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to reopen the chapter on Souravs six-ODI ban. 

He has already served out one-third of the punishment and, so, the fight really is over four ODIs ? the exact number India need to play in the forthcoming tri-series league stage. 

In fact, the BCCI is faced with a potentially awkward situation: What if Justice Sachs clears Sourav a day after the national selectors have appointed Rahul Dravid as captain and picked the tri-series squad? 

To limit that possibility, it wont surprise if the BCCI defers the selection ? slated, right now, for July 18 ? by a day or two. 

Incidentally, even if Justice Sachs doesnt rule in Souravs favour, he wont extend his contract with Glamorgan. 

Im contracted till July 26 and intend returning immediately thereafter? I can work on fitness and look forward to being chosen for the three Asia versus Africa ODIs besides, obviously, preparing for Zimbabwe, he said. 

Asked whether it was depressing being with a County which kept losing, Sourav replied: I wouldnt say so? Weve been hit hard by retirements, an injury to Alex Wharf, Simon Jones England duties? Even Matthew Elliott has torn a cartilage? 

The losses notwithstanding, Ive enjoyed my time with Glamorgan? The boys have been very nice, Ive got some runs (379, at an average of 75-plus, in four Championship matches) and Ive drawn on my experience with Lancashire? 

He elaborated: For example, unlike in 2000, Ive shared car rides? Elliott and I took turns driving from one city to the next? It suited me, it suited him? Pity hes now out with a bad injury. 

Sourav signs off with the July 21-24 Championship match against Middlesex. Before that, hes required for two (limited overs) National League fixtures ? on July 17 and 20, versus Worcestershire and Middlesex, respectively. 

By the way, his arrival here was delayed by three-and-half hours owing to the cancellation of his original flight from New Delhi. 

Sourav landed in the capital, from London, late Monday night.

 PCB rejects CA request 

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board has turned down a request from Cricket Australia to prepone their teams scheduled visit to Pakistan for five one-dayers and three Tests by six months. 

Australias request for rescheduling the February 2008 tour to August 2007, just after the World Cup, was rejected on the ground that the weather in Pakistan then would not be conducive for international cricket. 

CA had sent us a request that they would like to undertake their scheduled tour of Pakistan in August 2007 instead of February 2008. But weve declined because the weather in August ? specially in Punjab ? is not conducive for international cricket, a senior PCB official said.

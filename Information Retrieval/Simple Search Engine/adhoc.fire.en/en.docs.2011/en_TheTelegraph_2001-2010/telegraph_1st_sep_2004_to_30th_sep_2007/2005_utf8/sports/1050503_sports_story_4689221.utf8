 Lee says he?s back to best

Mumbai: Australian pacer Brett Lee Monday claimed he had fully recovered from his ankle injury and was bowling with the same pace and rhythm with which he made an impressive international debut six years ago. 

The Aussie fast bowler, who has been clocked to have bowled in excess of 160 kmph, also said he was hoping to break back into the Test squad during the forthcoming Ashes series in England and grab the opportunity, when it arrives, with both his hands. 

?I have had a tough 13-14 months and have not played any Tests in that period. I have played a dozen one-dayers recently during the tri-series featuring West Indies and Pakistan and then in New Zealand and have taken a lot of wickets,? Lee told a press conference. 

?My ankle is now 100 per cent and I have done whatever I have been asked to do (on the fitness front). 

?It feels like I am back to where I was in 1999,? said Lee, who was here on a promotional visit.

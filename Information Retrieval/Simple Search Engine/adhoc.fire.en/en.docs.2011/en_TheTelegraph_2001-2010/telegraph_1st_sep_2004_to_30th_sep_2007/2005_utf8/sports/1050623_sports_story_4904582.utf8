 Sania goes down fighting

 - Kuznetsova avenges Dubai defeat 

London: Sania Mirza put up a brave effort but it was not enough as Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova won the battle of teenagers in the womens singles second round match at Wimbledon here Wednesday. 

The 18-year-old Indian showed great fighting qualities before losing 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6 in 137 minutes. 

Sania, who had her fifth ranked opponent in trouble on a number of occasions, saw all her hard work going in vain on the Center Court of the All England Club after failing to benefit from the advantageous position she had put herself in with some fine display. 

The loss meant Sania, the world No. 75, failed to reproduce her performance of the Dubai Open where she beat the Russian earlier this year. 

Sania, playing on her favourite grass court, also failed to match her Australian Open feat where she had made it to the third round. 

Though Kuznetsova, who will turn 19 on June 27, won the contest, there was hardly any difference in the level of play with both the players hitting an almost identical number of winners ? Sania 35 to Kuznetsovas 38. 

Sania, startedby breaking her much-higher ranked opponents serve in the very first game, much to the delight of her supporters. The Indian held her next two games and Kuznetsova her serve in between as the scoreline read 2-1 in favour of the Indian. 

But making it clear that Sania was not going to have it easy, the Russian girl squared the score with some perfect shots. Sania saved two break points before Kuznetsova converted the third to level the score. 

The Indian raised hopes of clinching the first set when she broke the Russian again and held her own to take a 4-2 lead. But a plethora of double faults in her next game marred her hopes as Kuznetsova levelled the score yet again. 

The Russian won the next two games with quite ease to pocket the first set. 

Sania cruised to a 3-0 lead including two breaks immediately in the second set, before the Russian claimed two games on the trot to put the pressure back on the Indian. 

But Sania, keeping her cool, held her serve next to make it 4-2 before some keen tussle saw the lead changing hand with Kuznetsova winning three games consecutively to take a lead, 6-5, for the first time in the set. Sania won her game as the set entered the tie-breaker which she won to take the match to the decider. 

The Russian put her opponent under pressure breaking the third game in the decider and made matters worse for Sania by breaking her again three games later to make it 5-2. 

Sanias last ditch effort, which saw her breaking Kuznetsovas serve once, could not stop the Russian from booking a third round berth. 

Mahesh-Todd wins 

Indias Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge of Australia advanced to the second round of the mens doubles. The sixth seed Indo-Australian pair defeated Americans Graydon Oliver and Jared Palmer 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in their opening round tie. 

They next face Stephen Huss of Australia and Wesley Moodie of South Africa, who beat French-Belgian duo of Cyril Saulnier and Tom Vanhoudt 6-7 (6-7), 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.

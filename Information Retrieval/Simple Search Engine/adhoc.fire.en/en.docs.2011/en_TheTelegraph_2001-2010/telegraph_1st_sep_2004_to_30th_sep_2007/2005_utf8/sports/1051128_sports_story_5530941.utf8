 Kapil falters

Bangalore: Kapil Devs dream of winning another World Cup for India fell short by about seven feet, as he bogeyed the 18th hole of the McDowells Signature World Cup of Golfing Cricketers to hand the trophy to Australia B, comprising of Dean Jones and Colin Miller. 

India A, comprising of Kapil and Roger Binny, finished with the gross score of 134, one more than the Australians. England B (Ian Botham and Martin Bicknell) grossed 136 to finish second runners-up. 

Kapil, one of the brains behind this novel event, however, had the distinction of winning the individual title with a score of one-over 71 to get one back on Jones, who finished runner-up with 73.

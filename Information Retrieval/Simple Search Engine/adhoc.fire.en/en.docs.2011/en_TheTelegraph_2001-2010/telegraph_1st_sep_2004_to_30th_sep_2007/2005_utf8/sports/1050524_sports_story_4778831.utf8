 Ancelotti hopes for hattrick

 Carlo Ancelotti

Milan: AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti, jeered as a loser when he was sacked as coach of Juventus four years ago, is on the brink of becoming one of Italys most successful coaches. 

Ancelotti claimed a Champions League title in his first full season at Milan in 2003 and followed up that triumph with the clubs 17th Italian scudetto last term. Victory against Liverpool in Istanbul would be his title hattrick. 

The win on penalties against his former club Juventus in the 2003 Champions League final at Old Trafford was the moment when Ancelotti cast off any remaining doubts about his ability to achieve at the highest level. 

For two successive campaigns Ancelottis Juventus, featuring Zinedine Zidane in midfield, finished second in Serie A and the coach paid the price for failing to live up to the Turin clubs stratospheric expectations. 

Things changed for me after we beat Juventus in Manchester, said Ancelotti during the build-up to Wednesdays final as he took time out at the teams plush Milanello training centre. I want to continue this run and I hope we can do that with a win in Istanbul. 

This final has a different feel to the one of two years ago. The team was not yet complete and was playing its first final. We opened a cycle with that win and this final is part of that cycle, he said. 

When club owner and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi turned to his former player to replace Turk Fatih Terim, he gave Ancelotti the task of restoring Milan to the status they enjoyed in the early 1990s when they dominated at home and in Europe under the guidance of Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello.

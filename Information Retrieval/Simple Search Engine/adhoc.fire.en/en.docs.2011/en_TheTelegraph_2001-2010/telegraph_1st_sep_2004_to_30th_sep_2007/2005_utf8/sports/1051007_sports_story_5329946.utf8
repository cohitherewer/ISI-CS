 Youngsters should cooperate with Sourav, says Yuvraj

 - Time to put captain-coach row behind us 

 Yuvraj Singh 

New Delhi: Team India middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh came out in support of captain Sourav Ganguly on Thursday, saying Sourav had given chance to many youngsters and now it was their turn to cooperate with him. 

At times, a senior player deserves a chance while the youngsters can sit out in view of the contributions made by him towards the team. One should not feel bad about it, he said. 

The left-hander, however, said the row between Sourav and coach Greg Chappell had been disappointing, but the team should now move ahead. 

It was definitely disappointing and I would be lying if I dont say so. But we have to forget everything and move ahead for the betterment of the game. 

The Punjab batsman said that at the moment it is most important for the team to stay together. 

If I was the captain, I would have talked to the team and asked the players to be together in the present situation, he said. 

On Chappells stress on fitness, Yuvraj said, I dont think that his fitness regime is too harsh. All the boys are happy doing it. The fitness level of the team has improved? We are still working on it, the star batsman said on Thursday. 

I share a good rapport with the coach and I am happy with him, he said. 

Yuvraj, who scored 120 in the last league match against New Zealand in the tri-series in Zimbabwe recently, felt that India need to raise their level against major teams in one-dayers. 

We need to have good performances against good teams such as New Zealand. 

Having established himself in the one-day Internationals, Yuvraj is now keen on cementing a Test berth. 

My one-day record is okay. I am working hard for my place in the Test matches, Yuvraj said. Now I play with more responsibility in the middle order. I try to stay till the final overs. (PTI)

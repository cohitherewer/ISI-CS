 Murali Kartik helps Railways earn first-innings lead

 - IRANI TROPHY 

 Ramesh Powar bags four wickets for Rest 

 Murali Kartik scored a career-best unbeaten 89 

New Delhi: Murali Kartik displayed his batting prowess as he helped Railways wriggle out of a tight spot and post a slender first innings lead over the Rest of India in the Irani Cup match on Sunday. 

Arriving at the crease with the Ranji Trophy champions left with only one recognised batsman, Kartik hit an unbeaten 89, his career best first-class score, to pull the hosts out of trouble. 

At stumps, Railways were 235 for six, a lead of 12 runs that at one stage looked improbable after the Rest had reduced them to 106 for six soon after lunch. 

Accompanying Kartik at the other end was the seasoned Yere Goud on 43 not out. 

Gouds dour knock of 193 balls from 247 minutes with four fours was in contrast to Kartiks approach. 

The left-hander struck 13 fours and a six during his 198-minute stay at the crease during when he faced 135 balls. 

His effortless performance also made batting look easy on a wicket of uneven bounce that had consumed the top order inside the morning session. 

Offie Rame-sh Powar did the damage wit-h four for 78 but left-arm orthodox R. Ram-kumar was effective with no-ne for 29 from 16 overs. The other impressive bowling performance of the day was that of right arm seamer S. Sreesanth with two for 35. 

But the spectacled Kerala player blotted the scoresheet himself after stepping on the danger area on the follow through thrice from the same end and was ordered out of the attack for the innings. 

Resuming at six for no loss, Railways failed to deliver the knockout punch on the Rest after having dismissed them for a modest 223 on the opening day. 

Sreesanth gave the visitors their first breakthrough when he had Amit Pagnis (14) snick one to the wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel in the ninth over of the morning. 

Powar then struck his first blow when he had skipper Sanjay Bangar (31) leg before while attempting a sweep. 

After Jai Prakash Yadav (1) was undone by a Sreesanth delivery that kept low, the Mumbai off-spinner then picked two wickets in successive overs to leave Railways reeling at 90 for five. 

Tejinder Pal Singh (19) was caught behind for Parthivs second catch of the innings while Raja Ali (8) was caught at slip while going for a cut. 

When Vineet Saxena (9) was out in similar fashion the death knell was sounded for the hosts. But Kartik, ever the rebel, had other ideas. 

The 29-year-old has an average of 18.36 with the bat but has as many as 10 half centuries in first-class cricket, some record that not many No. 8 batsmen do not possess. 

Kartiks batting was no slam-bang though. There were umpteen silken-smooth cover drives, both off the pacers and slow bowlers. 

The high point, however, was the six lofter over the sightscreen off left-arm spinner Ramkumar. Goud.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Fear revisits soccer pitch

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Martins 

Calcutta: A sense of d?j? vu gripped the Salt Lake Stadium during the Mohun Bagan-Dempo SC match on Sunday. 

The leading Dempo striker Ranty Martins fell down following an aerial challenge with Mohun Bagan?s Nigerian striker Ajibade Olaniran Babalade in the 34th minute. As he remained unconscious, Babalade and his fellow defender Eduardo Coelho rushed forward and immediately called for medical assistance. As Martins was being stretchered off the park, Babalade was seen holding his head with both hands, praying. 

With the fear of another Cristiano Junior-like tragedy on everybody?s mind, the IFA medical was pressed into service. Martins, however, regained consciousness before the stand-bye ambulance was required. 

?Martins suffered a concussion and remained unconscious for about a minute. But he came to his senses while being stretchered off. I found the vital signs of his body to be normal and his pulse was normal,? Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, in-charge of the medical unit, said.

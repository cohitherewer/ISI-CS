The US Grand Prix two weeks ago will go down in the history books as the most bizarre race ever in Formula 1. Nobody could have predicted the events and the results that unfolded on the race day. With seven out of the ten teams backing out, only six cars were left racing the Indianapolis Grand Prix. 

Despite the fact that 14 cars returned to the pits after the warm-up lap to retire, it was still a very hard race and I think we did a great job to bring the car home. I am obviously very happy for the team by winning championship points. 

It feels really great to enter the history books as the first Indian to win F1 world championship points, though we would have preferred to get there under different circumstances. 

It becomes really hard in a situation like this to pinpoint the blame on someone for the fiasco in Indianapolis. But, Michelin seemed to have it got it all wrong during the race weekend. Perhaps they could have learnt from the mistake last year at Indianapolis when two of their tyres failed during the race. 

The Indianapolis Grand Prix clearly demonstrates how important tyres are to the success of the Formula 1 team. Incidents like these rob the fans of what may have been once in a lifetime experience of viewing an F1 race at a special venue. 

 In the two weeks leading to the French Grand Prix we tried our new car EJ15B. There is a lot of potential in the car and is quicker than our existing car by over half-a-second a lap. 

Our third driver, Robert Doornbos, drove that car in Fridays practice and demonstrated the pace. However, there are some cooling problems and reliability issues with the car, which has delayed the launch of the car till the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim in two weeks time. 

The Fridays practice was a normal session and it feels good to come back to a familiar track after having raced in unfamiliar territories. The Magny Course Circuit is a smooth, fast circuit with long chicanes. 

We can feel five Gs of positive gravitational pull on this circuit. It gets hot in Europe around this time and this will be another physically demanding race. 

In my time off during the two races, I managed to relaunch my website narainracing.com. Its something on which I have worked on and a site where my fans can know more about my progress and me. 

The Ferraris are looking stronger than before after their good performance in two races in America but the McLarens are looking a class apart and we can expect them to win this race. TCM

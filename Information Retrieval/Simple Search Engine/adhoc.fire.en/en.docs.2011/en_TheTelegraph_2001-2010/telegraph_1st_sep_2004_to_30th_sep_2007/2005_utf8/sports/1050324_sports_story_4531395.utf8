 Shoaib bowls from full run-up 

Islamabad: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar gave his first fitness test to join the team in India for the ODIs when he bowled from his full run-up. 

The 29-year-old appears to be fast recuperating from a hamstring strain suffered in January as he bowled four overs from a full run-up at the Gaddafi in Lahore on Tuesday. 

?Zeeshan kept wickets and Shoaib bowled for a full four overs from his full run-up. He seemed to be fine and got plenty of nip into his deliveries,? PIA team manager Rashid Khan said in a local daily. 

When contacted, Shoaib said he had been bowling in the nets at the National Cricket Academy for the last two days, but in short spells. 

?But today I bowled off a proper run-up on the main pitch to see whether I felt any strain in my hamstring muscles, and so far so good,? he said. (PTI)

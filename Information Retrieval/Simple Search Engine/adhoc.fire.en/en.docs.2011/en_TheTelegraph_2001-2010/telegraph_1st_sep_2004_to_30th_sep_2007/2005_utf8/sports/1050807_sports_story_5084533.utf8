The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Door opens for Owen to rejoin Liverpool

 Michael Owen has an admirer in Rafael Benitez 

The way was cleared Friday for Liverpool to try to bring Michael Owen back to Anfield when it was confirmed that Louis Saha had undergone knee surgery, making it all but impossible for Manchester United to sell the France forward and make room for Owen to head to Old Trafford. 

With United seemingly out of the race and Arsenal and Chelsea never contenders, Liverpool have become the obvious destination for the England forward, although that deal is not without its complexities. Rafael Benitez needs to sell at least one forward to make room for Owen and, despite interest in Milan Baros from Aston Villa, Schalke 04 and Everton (among others), the Czech Republic forward has yet to leave. 

The Liverpool manager has emphasised that his priority is a new centre half, but with Owen likely to be available for as little as ?12million, most Kop regulars would regard it as foolhardy for the Spaniard to pass up the chance of buying the man at present Englands leading goalscorer. None of Peter Crouch, Fernando Morientes and Djibril Cisse can be relied upon for 20 Premiership goals and, although the latter has scored regularly in France, he was bought by Gerard Houllier, not Benitez. While the Anfield manager did not beg Owen to stay last summer, knowing his head had been turned by Real, he is known to be an admirer. 

Although willing to fight for his place at Real where, on top of Ronaldo and Raul, he has fresh competition from Robinho and Julio Baptista, Owen would jump at the chance to return to the North West, where he still has a home. There have been suggestions of a loan deal but Real, who gave Liverpool a verbal first option when they bought Owen for ?8million last summer, may insist on a permanent deal. 

Owen, who is in Austria on a two-week training camp with Real, is also aware of interest from Lyons and Newcastle United but he will hope that Liverpool can clear the obstacles to a deal. A move to Old Trafford appears dead after United confirmed Friday that Saha will be out of action for the rest of the month ? and almost certainly beyond the end of the transfer window ? after arthroscopic surgery for damage to the medial meniscus in his right knee. 

Saha, who cost ?12.8milion when he joined from Fulham 18 months ago, has made just 21 starts for United and his injury record would have made it difficult to sell him for half that sum even before this latest operation. 

While Sir Alex Ferguson has a long-standing interest in the striker, Jose Mourinho Friday explained why Chelsea had not joined the bidding for Owen. We play normally with one striker and two wingers, he said. I have a big investment in Didier Drogba, a player I love and the same with Hernan Crespo. 

Carlton Cole is a personal bet that I want to win. And Eidur Gudjohnsen can be what I want, a striker or midfield player. The reason why Michael wants to leave Real Madrid is because he does not play as much as he would like. To come to Chelsea for a similar situation would be stupid. 

The Glazer family are planning to attend their first match at Old Trafford since the controversial takeover of the club this summer when Debrecen visit in the Champions League third round qualifying match on Tuesday. The brothers have not been seen in Manchester since there were riots when all three came to look around the stadium at the end of June.

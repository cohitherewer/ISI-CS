Calcutta: Mainland Sambaran Cricket Academy (MSCA) rode Subhojit Banerjees unbeaten 50 to the Pepsi Ambar Roy sub-junior title at Eden Gardens on Thursday. In the final played under lights, they defeated Durgapur CC by 9 wickets. 

Opener Subhojit was the best player of the tournament, amassing 931 runs in eight matches including a double hundred and two centuries. The youngster from Barasat, who comes from a humble family, set the tone for the victory with a 107-run opening stand with Arijit Seal (51). MSCA reached the target of 131 in 34.1 overs. 

Anjan Chatterjee, the Mainland China Pvt. Ltd boss, who is based in Mumbai, called The Telegraph to convey that Subhojit is going to be adopted by his organisation. 

Specifically, Chatterjee remarked everything will be done to ensure his family doesnt get burdened economically and, at the same time, the boy gets international exposure (at an academy) either in England or Australia. 

Details, of course, are to be worked out and it wont surprise if the very promising youngster even shifts to Mumbai to improve his skills.

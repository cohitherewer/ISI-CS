The Telegraph - Calcutta

 BCCI issues warning to organisers

New Delhi: The cricket board on Tuesday warned that it would shift the sixth and final one-day International between India and Pakistan out of Delhi if the Feroze Shah Kotla was not ready in time to host the tie. 

Delhi and District Cricket Association is racing against time to prepare the Kotla ground, undergoing massive renovation, for the all-important rubber to be held on April 17. 

But board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra sounded the warning bell saying if its pitches and grounds committee did not give the green signal to the venue, Delhi would have to let its chance slip away. 

?The chairman of pitches and grounds committee of the board would inspect Delhi soon. If he is not satisfied, the match may be shifted elsewhere,? Mahendra told reporters after a meeting of the working committee. 

 Tsunami tie 

Meanwhile, Mahendra said BCCI would negotiate with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) as well as the International Cricket Council (ICC) to ensure the second tsunami relief charity match is held as scheduled in Calcutta in April. 

ACC president Jagmohan Dalmiya had said on Sunday that the high-profile match between Rest of the World and an Asia XI had been called off because it was not feasible to hold the match in April. 

But Mahendra sounded upbeat about the prospect of the match being held. 

?The match is still on. We are going to play that match. We are negotiating with ACC as well as the ICC,? he said.

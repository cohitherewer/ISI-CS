 K. Sasikiran 

New Delhi: Grandmaster K. Sasikiran was held in the final round but he still managed to edge past GM Abhijit Kunte on better progressive scores to lift the third Parsvnath International open chess tournament here on Monday. 

Sasikiran went for an outright win in the final round against International Master Anton Filipov of Uzbekistan but had to settle for truce after 67 moves. He finished with nine points from a possible 11. 

Kunte defeated Saptarshi Roy in 46 moves to join Sasikiran at the top of the list. 

Koya walks out 

Meanwhile, during the prize distribution ceremony, All India Chess Federation (AICF) general secretary P.T. Ummer Koya walked out after Kunte utilised the platform to express players? resentment on various issues. 

In a related incident, Koya, in a letter to GM Dibyendu Barua, asked him to clarify the ?unfounded allegations? against the AICF with regard to the selection of the Indian team for last year?s Asian Women?s meet. 

Barua, president of Chess Players? Association of India, had taken up the cause of WGM Nisha Mohota who accused AICF of not selecting her for being associated with the CPAI. (agencies)

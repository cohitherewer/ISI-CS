 Anand draws with Svidler

 Anand 

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Viswanathan Anand failed to capitalise on a winning position and was held to a draw by Russian champion Peter Svidler in the fourth round of the Corus chess tournament. 

Anand, the winner in the previous two editions, apparently had a winning position on the board and the result was a clear indication that the Indian ace was not in his best form. 

In the first four rounds, Anand had just 1.5 points and was still looking for his first victory in Corus that is known as one of his favourite hunting grounds. 

Meanwhile, the standings in the category-19 event took a steep turn as in-form Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria was grounded by world championship finalist Michael Adams of England. 

For Adams it was the game of the event thus far as he outclassed Topalov in all departments of the game. 

As things stand after the fourth round, Leko and Adams share the lead with three points each in their kitty with two victories and two draws apiece while Topalov, Alexander Grischuk, Nigel Short and former world champion Ruslan Ponomzariov of Ukraine follow them half a point behind. 

For Anand it turned out to be yet another tough day in office as he tried hard but did not succeed in taming Svidler, who had two losses in first three games. 

Anand dominated the proceedings after Ruy Lopez opening as white and after the first 20 moves it was evident that the Indian was on top. 

In another decisive game of the day, Commonwealth champion Nigel Short crushed Russian Alexander Morozevich who is clearly struggling here with just half a point. M 

In group C, Parimarjan Negi put up an improved performance and held higher rated l Pliester to a draw. ?I was perhaps better in the final position but it got repeated,? Negi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

It?s time Indian youngsters stood up to be counted

- This could be a watershed tie for the Indian team

 Rameshs decisive win in Frejus provided 

one of the best moments in Indias shining Davis Cup history

In 1900, Dwight Davis donated a huge silver bowl as 

prize for an annual tennis match between the US and Britain. Gradually, over the 

years, other nations joined the competition. This weekend, 72 nations all over 

the globe will kick off the 2005 meet which will culminate in the final from December 

2.

While threading its way through the two World Wars 

in the last century, the Davis Cup has managed to maintain its reputation as a 

symbol of friendly tennis rivalry between nations.

Till the 1970s, the Davis Cup was monopolised by four 

nations ? Britain, Australia, France and the US. With the advent of professionalism, 

the Davis Cup had to take a backseat. Players were reluctant to play merely for 

pocket money when tournaments offered huge prize-money. More often than not, players 

were unable to adjust their schedules and declined to play.

Noble instincts of patriotism and camaraderie, echoes 

from the old-fashioned past, were lost in the scramble for more money. Now, with 

deep-pocketed sponsors who have realised the potential of Davis Cup matchplay, 

as also settlements between players and associations about the distribution of 

the earnings, the Davis Cup seems to be back on track.

The dust has settled and the ?market correction? has 

taken place, the tournament schedules adjusted and the top players are back playing 

Davis Cup for their countries. The Davis Cup final is now at par with the Grand 

Slam finals with the TV channels. The national anthems, the fluttering flags, 

the score being called as advantage India (and not in the players? name) in the 

presence of a ranting home crowd, sends the pulse berserk.

The dormant patriot in everybody stirs into a strident 

force charged with emotion. The tension is unbelievable. Even some Grand Slam 

winners have succumbed to the pressure of Davis Cup play and lost to players of 

a far lower class.

Though sports journalists and pundits of the game 

have often accused Indian greats of lacking the ?killer instinct?, a view I totally 

disagree with, India?s performance in Davis Cup indicates otherwise. Thrice finalists 

(1966, 1974 and 1987), the Krishnans and Amritrajs, Mukerjea and Premjit Lal fought 

their way through the higher-ranked nations of the world. 

Then there was the fist-pumping, swaggering Leander 

Paes who produced some of the greatest matches I have seen in more than five decades. 

His finest moment was when he won both his singles matches on slow claycourts 

against France in Frejus to take India into the semi-final. An ageing Ramesh Krishnan, 

braving niggling injuries, quietly delivered the coup de gr?ce in the fifth 

rubber. No Bollywood producer could have conceived and scripted a more nerve-wracking 

finish.

India have a rich Davis Cup history and we can all 

be proud of it.

In many ways, the current tie against China could 

be a watershed of sorts. Our team is playing against a relatively weak China and 

everyone is taking a win for granted.

Their top player is Sung Pen, ranked No. 337, while 

their No. 2 Wang Yu Jr is ranked No. 409. In comparison, Prakash Amritraj and 

Harsh Mankad are ranked 357 and 359. Rankingwise, leaving Paes out of it, they 

seem to be evenly matched with the Indians having the edge because of playing 

at home and on grass.

With Leander having played only one doubles match 

since the Australian Open, it was time to shift the burden of singles to youngsters 

Harsh Mankad and Prakash Amritraj. Mankad?s recent victory in the British Satellite 

Masters and his superb Chennai Open performance in January, when he won three 

qualifying matches and produced a great match in the first round, signals in the 

strongest manner that he is match-tight and much improved. Prakash has had a training 

stint and polished up his serve and volley.

Leander has thrown them both into the deep end and 

given them an opportunity to prove their mettle. It is high time they delivered. 

A victory for the youngsters could provide a vital step up in experience and confidence. 

If Mankad and Amritraj fail to click on the opening day, current Davis Cup rules 

allow substitution of a singles player on the final day and Paes could step into 

the breach.

If India clinch this tie, we would most likely play 

Uzbekistan who should win their first-round tie against Indonesia. Uzbekistan 

are tough customers and if the choice of ground is India?s, we should welcome 

them to the low-bouncing, fast grasscourts of the South Club.

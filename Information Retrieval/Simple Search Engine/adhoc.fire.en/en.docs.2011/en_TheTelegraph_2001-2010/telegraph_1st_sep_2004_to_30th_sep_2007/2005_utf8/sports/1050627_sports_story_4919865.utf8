The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Michael Vaughan the man for both Tests 

 and ODIs

Guest Column 

Ian Chappell

 The only good thing to come out 

 of Englands heavy defeat on Thursday was the realisation 

 that, yes, England are a better one-day team with Michael 

 Vaughan playing and leading them. 

 The doubters are growing in number, 

 which is understandable when you consider his alarmingly 

 poor record in one-day cricket: not one hundred in 66 innings 

 at an average below 30. The statistics are even more puzzling 

 when you consider this is a man with one of the best conversion 

 rates in Test cricket of fifties to hundreds. Twenty-six 

 times he has crossed the half-century threshold in the five-day 

 game; 14 times he has gone on to three figures. In one-day 

 cricket that ratio is 14:0. 

 The spectre of different captains 

 for Test and one-day cricket reared its head in one newspaper 

 in the build-up to the Durham match. Then Vaughan missed 

 out through injury, Marcus Trescothick took up the reins, 

 and look what happened: England looked a bunch of, as Allan 

 Lamb used to say rolling his rs with a heavy 

 South African twang, raggy-arsed rangers. 

 For the first time in this series 

 Englands fielding made Australias look good. 

 The intensity and passion was down a notch on what we have 

 been used to under Vaughan and, no matter what noises emanated 

 from the England camp after the game, there was a misjudgement 

 at the toss. England should have batted first and let Australia 

 chase under pressure and under lights.

 No doubt, the decision to field 

 first was not Trescothicks alone. Englands one-day 

 think-tank (mostly Welsh come to think of it, since Duncan 

 Fletcher, unlike Sir Clive Woodward, has plenty of faith 

 in the Welsh) would have given their two-pennys worth. 

 But since the wins and losses go against a captains 

 name, it is Trescothick who must take responsibility. 

 From the outside it is not always 

 easy to gauge what a captain brings to a team. Clearly Vaughan 

 brings something. At least his team believes he does, which 

 is half the battle. In fact, if you want to check out the 

 England captains views on leadership turn to page 

 36 of the British Airways business magazine, as I did returning 

 from Durham, and you can learn a whole lot more. 

 Clearly Vaughan brings something to 

 a team

 In it, the England captain is 

 dressed in a pukka pin-stripe suit, and pads, playing determined-looking 

 strokes and issuing forth sound-bites about motivation, 

 communication and any other ation you care to 

 think of. When he retires maybe he will join the frauds 

 on the motivational circuit who believe that sportsmen have 

 something to teach big business about leadership. Until 

 then, hes got to convince the doubters about his one-day 

 credentials by scoring a hundred or two, because England 

 are a much better team with him at the helm and the last 

 thing they need right now is the instability that a change 

 would bring.

 How about this for a solution: 

 forget about moving up and down the order; forget about 

 trying to hold the middle of the innings together, and get 

 back to the position where you have batted best for England 

 ? opening. The nerds will say Vaughans best one-day 

 figures are at No. 3 (average 33.36, ten fifties) and that 

 he averages 17 when he has opened in one-day cricket. But 

 who would Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath prefer to bowl to? 

 Andrew Strauss, or the only England top-order batsmen who 

 has consistently been able to take the attack to them? 

 Vaughan should prosper most when 

 the ball is coming on to the bat; when the fielding restrictions 

 are in place and when he can best showcase his boundary-hitting 

 ability, which is better than his nurdling. Besides, Strauss 

 was developing quite nicely at No. 4, a position that is 

 too high in the order for Paul Collingwood, despite his 

 heroics against Bangladesh. Ideally, Collingwood should 

 float at five, six or seven, allowing Kevin Pietersen and 

 Andrew Flintoff the flexibility to get to the crease when 

 their power-hitting is most effective. 

 Which leaves Geraint Jones ? too 

 frenetic to be a finisher at No. 7 and too vulnerable when 

 he opens ? to fill in at No. 3.

Milan: Juventus claimed their 28th Italian league title on Friday without kicking a ball after rivals AC Milan were held to a 3-3 draw at home by Palermo. 

The result leaves Juventus, who have two games remaining, four points clear of last years title winners Milan who have just one more match to play. 

Milan, who fielded a reserve side ahead of their Champions League final against Liverpool in Istanbul on Wednesday, led 3-1 at the break, thanks to two goals from Brazilian Serginho and a Jon Dahl Tomasson strike. 

Carlo Ancelottis side were all set to force Juventus to win their penultimate match at Livorno on Sunday to secure the title but Palermo struck twice inside the final 13 minutes. 

A twice-taken penalty from Italy international Luca Toni got Palermo back in the match before Simone Barone fired in at the near post for a 79th minute equaliser. 

Milan remain 10 points clear of third-placed Inter and their runners-up spot means they will go straight into the group stage of the Champions League next season. 

Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Liverpool and beat Milan in the decisive head-to-head Serie A game at San Siro four days after their opponents beat PSV Eindhoven in the semi-finals. 

Juventus coach Fabio Capello has now won titles with four different clubs ? AC Milan, AS Roma and Juventus in Italy and Real Madrid in Spain. 

The title is Juventus third in the past four seasons and sixth in the last 11 campaigns ? all five previous triumphs coming under the guidance of former coach Marcello Lippi. 

There was also a personal milestone for Juventus defender Ciro Ferrara who equalled the record eight Serie A titles won by former Juventus players Giovanni Ferrari and Giuseppe Furino. 

Ferrara, who will retire from playing to join Juventus coaching staff at the end of the season, won two titles with Napoli before moving to the Turin club. 

There was an air of anti-climax surrounding the title win with few signs of celebration reported in Turin.

 England paid price for failing to adapt

Multan: England missed a great opportunity for a rare Test match victory in Pakistan. But the really galling thing is that, after controlling the match for three-and-a-half days, they gave it away because they are unable to adapt their game. 

If they play like that in Australia next winter, they will get walloped. If this is how they play under pressure, they will never retain the Ashes. They have to learn to adapt. 

All England had to do on Wednesday was take the sting out of the opposition, get to lunch with the loss of only one or two wickets down and the game was ours. 

After playing Shane Warne in the summer, you would think England could play wrist spin better than this. But they have learned nothing. England are just not able to play wrist spin. They sweep or lap the ball or wait for a short one to punish because they cant pick Danish Kanerias bowling. 

They are not confident of driving or coming out of their crease because they are not sure which way the ball is going to turn. If Pakistan had picked Shahid Afridi for his leggies or Mushtaq Ahmed then we would have struggled even more. 

Overall, however, it was an opportunity lost through an attack of over-confidence, foolhardy shots and lack of skill under pressure. The reason for this is England can play only one way; they attack. If it comes off it looks great. 

Four runs an over is fantastic; I like it, it is exciting, dramatic cricket that produces thrilling matches. But you need flat pitches and fast outfields in order to do it and in Pakistan that is not the case. 

All great teams and players around the world, in every sport, can adapt. Sometimes the pitch, the type of bowlers you are facing and a pressure situation forces you to change your game. Sometimes you have to graft, work hard and take your time. You cant just play one way and biff, bang, wallop the bowlers. 

It is difficult to win Tests in Pakistan, we have only ever won two, and this was a great opportunity. The pitch was a very good fifth day pitch, normally it is badly scarred and the spinners can exploit the footholes, but this one never broke up. 

I know 200 on the final day can be difficult but we have fallen under pressure and weight of expectation. 

Nobody in this England side wanted to stay in and work. 

Andrew Flintoff was caught on the boundary sweeping, Kevin Pietersen wafted at a wide ball, Ian Bell was out forcing off the back foot and the only batsman who was got out by the bowler was Andrew Strauss, dismissed playing defensively. 

As for Paul Collingwood, I just dont think he has what it takes to be good enough at this level. We scored 400 in the first innings but one man, Marcus Trescothick, scored half of those runs. To me, the rest look out of nick and short of match practice. 

Nine of the 11 players in this Test had never played in Pakistan before and two matches as preparation is simply not enough. The pitches here are very different to England and places like South Africa, and guys have gone into this match underdone. 

Trescothick said after the match they were not short of match practice. Nonsense. They will all toe the party line ? captain, coach and players ? because they will see it as a weakness to admit they are wrong. But they need more practice matches, not fewer, which is the way modern tours are going these days. 

The good thing for England is that their seam bowlers did a fantastic job. They got 18 out of 20 wickets and except for the first three hours of the match, when Pakistan batted well, England had the upper hand for all four days. 

England have come back before, but they will have to bat a hell of a lot better next time.

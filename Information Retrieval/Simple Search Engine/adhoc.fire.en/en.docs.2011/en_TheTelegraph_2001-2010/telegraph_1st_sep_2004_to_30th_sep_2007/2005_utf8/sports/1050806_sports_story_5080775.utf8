The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A coach has to challenge his players to go a step further: Moody

 - Whether youre a coach or player, its nice to make a successful start... My feet are firmly on the ground, though 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Colombo: At 39, Tom Moody (a member of the Australian squad which won the 1987 World Cup and a member of the XI which regained the title 12 years later) isnt much older than Sri Lankas most experienced cricketers. Age, though, isnt being seen as a handicap ? rather, the new coach has that contemporary feel. Moody, who has just begun his innings with Sri Lanka, spoke to The Telegraph at Taj Samudra on Friday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

On whether winning his first Test series (versus the West Indies) as coach and Sri Lankas strong start in the tri-series has taken some of the pressure off him 

Not at all as these are very early days. However, whether youre a coach or player, its nice to make a successful start... My feet are firmly on the ground, though. 

On whether he was relieved when the West Indies arrived sans the biggest names 

No... Again, whether youre a player or coach, you want to do well against the best... Its when the opposition is strong that the skills get tested... The West Indies do have off-the-field troubles and I feel for them. I didnt expect a cakewalk and winning didnt come easy. 

On how disappointed was he at not getting the Team India job 

(After a pause) Wasnt hugely disappointed as I went for the interview (in New Delhi) with an open mind... I was also coming here for an interview and, given the chance, would have weighed the pros and cons. As it turned out, the Indian Board helped me make my mind up... In fact, Greg Chappell got the job even before my interview with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). 

On Chappell 

I respect him. 

On Sri Lanka winning both matches versus India 

Im happy the results have gone in our favour... We came through difficult times, but neither I nor anybody in the team is getting carried away. In time, Im sure India will have much success under Chappell. 

On whether Indias failure to win the second match (on Wednesday) surprised him 

(Laughs) One should never be surprised as no match is over till the last ball... My experience shows that whatever the situation, you must not write off any team... Thats the beauty of cricket. We won because we stuck to our game plan. 

On a coachs role at the international level 

Preparing the players in the best way... Challenging them to do even better... Only the talented make the highest level and coaching is about getting them to improve... A coach has to challenge his players to go a step further than the last series or tournament... One has to encourage them to look at new ideas without trying to change them. Essentially, players never stop learning... 

On whether he has looked up to any one coach 

Im the sort to draw on my experience of having been coached by different people... Im also the type to learn from having played alongside gifted cricketers... Im the sort who looks at other sport as well... Basketball, golf... Whatever... Im open to learning. 

On whether, having been an allrounder, he has an advantage over most other coaches 

I have an understanding of what a bowler thinks and, equally, what a batsman thinks... I enjoy the bio-mechanical side of bowling and the technical side of batting... I comfortably relate to both. 

On his approach 

Giving the job hundred per cent... As long as I do that and the players respond enthusiastically, theres nothing to worry. The rest has to fall in place. 

On whether a coach has a shelf life 

With one team, yes... A maximum of five, probably seven, years... Depends on when a coach takes over... A long run (seven years) is possible if the coachs arrival coincides with the nucleus of the team being young. 

On having been Worcestershires director of cricket 

I learnt an enormous amount... I had a diverse role, for example I controlled the budget for cricket... So, it wasnt just fine-tuning skills... However, what I learnt most in four years is managing players. 

On working with Graeme Hick, an icon at Worcester 

We had a good relationship... Perhaps, it helped that Id played with him before taking on a different role... Hes good enough to still be playing international cricket, but has become realistic and challenges himself to get better at the stage where he is. Actually, it was challenging for me to get him to improve even though the chance of an England comeback wasnt there. Graeme has been remarkable. 

On his mental preparation in the lead-up to succeeding John Dyson 

At Worcestershire, I was fortunate to work with players having Asian roots ? Vikram Solanki, Kabir Ali... And, this summer, Chaminda Vaas... That helped in a big way. Then, I researched on cricket in Sri Lanka... Ive been in the country for six weeks and have enjoyed every minute. 

On whats needed for Sri Lanka to take the next step 

First, weve got to sharpen the structure... Domestic cricket has to be looked into, as also the structure at the U-19 level... Then, weve got to review whats being done at the academy... Idea, of course, is to ensure talent doesnt escape us and our net is wide enough. The SLCs Cricket Committee is on the job. 

On whether hes going to be involved beyond coaching the senior national team 

Thats what Ive been given to understand. 

On his biggest challenge 

Improving Sri Lankas away-record... All teams from the sub-continent are good at home, but... The away-record is an area that needs to be addressed. 

On whether he will have a Sri Lankan as assistant coach 

Its on the cards. 

On whether hes satisfied with the existing support staff 

Its a period of transition... Ive already said theres going to be an assistant coach... Then, were soon getting a new physio... Everybody appreciates the importance of a good support staff. 

On whether hes concerned that Sanath Jayasuriya (36), Muttiah Muralidharan (33) and Vaas (31) are towards the end of their careers 

Depends on how one looks at things ? I tend to be positive... All three have been great players and have had a huge impact on Sri Lankan cricket. But, if one door closes, the other opens... Who knows who will walk through that door? Thats my philosophy... Surely, nobody predicted Murali would take the number of wickets he has. Its necessary to have the right structure, so that talent comes through the door which opens. 

On whether he gets to unwind 

I prefer spending time with the family ? my wife and kids are to move here next year... Im fond of golf... 

On his handicap 

(Laughs again) My swing! 

Finally, on how closely has he been following the Ashes 

The best teams are battling it out and Ive got friends in both dressing rooms... Like so many others, Im following it passionately.

Mumbai: Striker Ayan Choudhary slammed in five goals, including a hattrick as East Bengal Club trounced Vasco Sports Club of Goa 11-0 to enter the final of the third junior (under-19) Ongc Cup football meet for first division NFL teams Thursday. 

Choudhary got into the score-sheet first in the 31st minute of play by scoring EBs third goal to consolidate the 2-0 lead provided by his teammates Swarnabha Barua (sixth) and Gowrang Biswas (20th) at the Cooperage Football Ground. 

After Abhijit Goswami made it 4-0 in the eighth minute of the second half, Choudhary struck a purple patch by netting four goals on the trot in a 20-minute East Bengal blitz.

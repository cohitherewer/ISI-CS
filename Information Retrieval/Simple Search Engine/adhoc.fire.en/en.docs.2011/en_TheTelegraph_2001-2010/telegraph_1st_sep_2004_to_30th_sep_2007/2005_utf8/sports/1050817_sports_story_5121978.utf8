 Surya held by Iran GM

 Surya shares second spot with 18 others 

Abu Dhabi : International Master-in-waiting Abhijit Gupta held Grandmaster Saidali Iuldachev of Uzbekistan in the second round of the Masters section of 15th Abu Dhabi International Chess festival. 

Indias best bet, GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly, was also held by Iranian GM Elshan Moradiabadi while IM-in-waiting Parimarjan Negi lost to GM Konstantin Chernyshov of Russia in the $16,400 prize money tournament. 

Meanwhile, top seed Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan shared the lead with six others maintaining a clean slate with 2 points. 

Ganguly and Gupta, along with 17 others, were on the next slot with 1.5 points as seven rounds remain in the Swiss event. 

It turned out to be a good day for Gupta, who seized the initiative from Iuldachev. A side variation by the Uzbek yielded no results in the Sicilian Defence and Gupta was quick enough to prove a pawn sacrifice wrong in the middle game. However, the Uzbeks experience saved his day as he managed to draw in 39 moves. 

I just slipped towards the end, I thought I was easily winning but missed his tactical stroke leading to a draw, Gupta said. 

Unlike Gupta, Ganguly could not do much with black. Moradiabadi went for the exchange variation which Ganguly equalised. Draw was agreed in just 17 moves. 

My opponent just played a safe game and did not venture into any complications, Ganguly said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Will credentials alone count or...

 - Board clarifies Whatmore, Moody sent CVs directly to Mahendra and not Nair 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 One of the three former captains on 

 the panel is more than inclined towards 

 Greg Chappell 

Calcutta: With the first steps towards appointing John Wrights successor set to be taken in a few hours, the buzz is that one of the three former India captains on the selection committee is ?more than inclined? towards Greg Chappell. 

The Board-constituted committee to pick the coach features Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri, president Ranbir Singh Mahendra, immediate past president Jagmohan Dalmiya and secretary S.K. Nair. 

The committee meets here on Sunday afternoon and Chappells CV is with the Board. He hasnt coached a national side, but his credentials are unmatched. 

Incidentally, Chappell was a contender in 2000, too, when Wright got the job. 

?The former captain in question favours Chappell not only because he himself holds him in esteem, but even the most experienced players will be happy working with a great,? a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

The views of the other two former captains werent known till late on Saturday. However, one did tell a confidant he would ?play it safe? ? in other words, probably go along with the majority view. 

As for the Board officials, Dalmiya has already declared everybody has an ?open mind.? Moreover, the ?experience? of the Venkats is going to be tapped. 

Yet, its inconceivable that Dalmiya will be a passive participant. If not anything else, hes bound to ensure the former captains dont end up taking extreme positions. 

Even though Nair insisted (on Friday evening) that just two CVs ? Dean Jones and Chappells ? had been received, the Board has clarified Dav Whatmore and Tom Moody forwarded theirs directly to Mahendra. 

Whatmore, by the way, has extended his contract with Bangladesh; Moody is with Graeme Hicks Worcestershire. 

Why Mahendra didnt send those CVs to Nair is, of course, a mystery. 

Apparently, he forwarded them to Dalmiyas office in Calcutta, assuming the selectors would meet here. 

Mahendra got that right. However, he breached protocol. 

Meanwhile, a former captain (not on the committee) is understood to be lobbying for Jones, despite his figuring in the CBIs report on match-fixing. 

Also, one learns the Board did informally ?sound out? Allan Border, but Test crickets most prolific run-getter conveyed his inability to accept a full-time coachs job only weeks after quitting as Australias chief selector. 

Had Border been interested, the pitch would have queered for the rest.

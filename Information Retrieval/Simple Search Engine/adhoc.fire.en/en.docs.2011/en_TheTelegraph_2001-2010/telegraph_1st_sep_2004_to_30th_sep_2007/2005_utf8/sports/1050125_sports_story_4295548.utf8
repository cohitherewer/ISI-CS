 So far so good for Klinsmann

 - Coach has revitalised faltering Germany 

 Klinsmann cherishes his anonymous lifestyle in California 

Huntington Beach (California): It is a long way from northern Europe?s frozen soccer pitches to southern California?s surfer-filled beaches but Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann stays tuned to his homeland from half a world away. 

Commuting 40,000 km each month, Klinsmann has revitalised Germany since taking over the faltering team six months ago and has turned the great distance between his United States home and German job to his advantage. 

Capitalising on technology advances, Klinsmann has no trouble reaching players, assistants and club trainers by e-mail or cell phone. He tracks German media reports on internet websites and watches Bundesliga matches on television. 

?At the end of the day the only thing that matters is the quality of the work you deliver,? Klinsmann said in an interview in his adopted hometown of Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles. ?I see only advantages to this set-up.? 

A little jet lag, red eyes that come with rising before dawn to have more time on Europe?s schedule, and high phone bills are negligible drawbacks compared to the welcome side effect that nine time zones and 9,000 km provide a barrier to Germany?s fickle media. 

Klinsmann ? whose rejuvenated team has impressed with five wins, a draw and a loss since he took over in August ? has silenced most domestic sceptics of his long-distance commuting. 

A few die-hard critics such as Schalke 04 commercial manager Rudi Assauer still argue he should be in Germany all the time, observing players and talking in person with Bundesliga coaches. 

?I have no problem with that criticism and respect those who have differing views,? Klinsmann said. ?But at the end of the day I have to decide what?s best. And in my view this set-up benefits the team.? 

Klinsmann has also avoided the treacherous embraces and menacing scrutiny of Germany?s demanding media, which viciously turned on predecessor Rudi Voeller just two years after idolising him for leading the team to the 2002 World Cup final. 

Klinsmann, who as a player won the 1990 World Cup and the 1996 European championship with Germany, cherishes his anonymous lifestyle in California, his home for six years, and says it is better for his family.

Calcutta: For Shiv Kapur Friday it was a close call to fame as Vijay Kumar went past the three-round leader to win on the sixth play-off hole thereby capturing his first Amby Valley PGAI Tour title this season and the winner?s cheque of Rs 1,62,000 at the RCGC Open. 

Starting the day at 10-under par, with a comfortable cushion of four strokes, Kapur must have had his third PGAI Tour all packed up, but Vijay has some other plans. 

?My long game was really out of sorts today. I was hitting it all over the place and struggled to find most of the fairways. If it was not for my putting today, there would sure be no play-off. Vijay played very well and was breathing down my neck all the way. In the end the best golfer for the day won as is always the case?, said Shiv coming from behind, Vijay parred the first two holes and bogeyed the third. He went on to birdie the par-5 fourth, par-4 seventh amp; ninth holes cutting the deficit down to just two strokes as they hit the turn. 

A small setback later birdies on the 12th and the par-5 15th saw Vijay standing on the final hole just one shot short of what was to be one a great last-round turnaround. 

After their tee shots on the eighteenth both Shiv and Vijay were neck-and-neck, rolling over to sudden death, the sequence being the 18th played twice followed by holes 1, 2, 3 and so on till a result was reached.

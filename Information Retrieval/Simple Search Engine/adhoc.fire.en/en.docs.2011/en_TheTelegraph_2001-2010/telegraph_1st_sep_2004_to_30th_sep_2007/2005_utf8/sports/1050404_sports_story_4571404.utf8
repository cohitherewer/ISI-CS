 Vizag already a sell-out

Visakhapatnam: A full house of 26,000 will greet the Indian and Pakistani cricket teams at the picturesque ACA-VDCA Stadium when the arch-rivals clash in the second one-dayer here Tuesday. 

The new stadium, surrounded by hills, is all set to host its first ever one-day International and the atmosphere appears quite charged with a stream of cricket buffs expected to converge on the port city from various parts of the state. 

All tickets were sold out two days ago and the mad rush for tickets has not stopped. 

The stadium, completed in 2003, has held only one match involving a foreign team so far. The three-dayer between the visiting New Zealand team and the Board Preident?s XI in September 2003 had ended in a draw, with rain playing spoilsport for the first two days. 

Members of the Indian and Pakistani teams arrived here, two hours behind schedule and headed straight to the hotel. 

Meanwhile, in a departure from normal practice, the two sides will hold nets Monday at the Port Sports Council Stadium, with the organisers deciding not to organise the match-eve practice session at the venue lest it interfere with last-minute preparations.

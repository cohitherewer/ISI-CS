 Ive no chance at Big W

 - Roger Federer is an unbelievable player, says Rafael Nadal 

SUE MOTT

 Nadal says his ambition is to be a very, very normal guy 

So like a film star. Still like a kid. The world of Rafael Nadal, the swashbuckling sensation of Spanish tennis, just became crazier on Friday. After winning the French Open last Sunday, three hours and 24 minutes of physical dynamite, he returned to his home country to find himself feted as a full-fledged hero. 

Cameras queued up to secure footage of his face, managing a smile, as he signed a deluge of tennis balls. Radio stations beamed his teen-speak to all quarters of the Spanish nation. Screens were erected, security staff employed and his agent was never off the phone. Chocolate milk has been one of Nadals major sponsors. Now the cream of the corporate world will be clamouring. 

Nadals career has not begun in the conventional sense. It has exploded in a shower of sparks and forehands. And he only celebrated his 19th birthday last week, the day he beat Roger Federer in the semi-final in Paris. A good present. He had a cake and his first Grand Slam final simultaneously. Typically, he took his chance and now the world knows his name, his hairdo and his muscles. 

Sprawled on a couch in his suite of rooms at a hotel in downtown Madrid, Nadal exuded the languor of a rock star between performances. This was a brief lull before he took the Spanish tennis press out to lunch, having posed all morning by a pool under a poster of himself looking strangely like Che Guevara, and he was clearly favouring inertia as an occupation. 

He started in sweetly hesitant English, before reverting to an interpreter. You spend your whole life thinking about, talking about how to win a Grand Slam. Suddenly you find youve won it. What can I say? I just have to be very thankful. Everybody now pays attention to what I do. 

They certainly do. Especially Federer, one suspects, the almost-perfect one, who found his virtues sorely taxed, and eventually overwhelmed, by this hyperactive bundle of biceps in their latest confrontation. But that was clay and this is grass now. Wimbledon is just over a week away and you wonder whether the young Spaniards self-confidence will waver as the world turns from red to green. 

I have no chance, Nadal said with an amiable grin. No. I am realistic. Hes an unbelievable player. Imagine, I played on my best surface, in my best period of the year, I won almost every match and I could still only tie with him. 

He meant that Federer had won their first confrontation this season, in Miami, and he had reversed the score in Paris. Roger is on another level. I played the best I could. I could only tie with him. No chance at Wimbledon. 

Well, there is a lot of things that have to change for grass. But Im still young and I have time to learn. I will try to improve my game and win Wimbledon one day. Of course I would love to do well, but I am realistic to know that it will be very difficult for me to win matches at Wimbledon. I love it. It would be a dream. 

I am afraid of lots of things, he said, confessionally. A dog. I could be scared of a dog thats upset, for example. And on the tennis court, maybe on the outside I look fearless, but on the inside Im scared. Theres not one player in the world who isnt nervous before matches. Especially important matches. 

Hair by Gabriela Sabatini, legs by Maradona (only a foot longer), he is the perfect Latin sports star. He is huge! Huge! As huge as the footballer Raul, said Benito Perez-Barbadillo, director of communications for the Association of Tennis Professionals, who does not appear to be exaggerating given the intimate hug bestowed on Nadal by King Juan Carlos of Spain after the theatrical victory last week. 

The Queen has never clasped Tim Henman, has she? Off duty, Nadal has a few surprising habits. He claims to love golf, surely far too sedate, unless he enters Grand Prix in his golf buggy. But this is to misunderstand the essentially gentle nature of his spirit. 

He is a modest man. Nothing could be more certain. This is perhaps why he will not contemplate discussion of being No. 1 in the world. His admiration for Federer forbids him entering the race (at least out loud). 

Anyone who finishes the year as No. 2 is really No. 1 because the other guy is a different level. I wish I could be considered his rival going into the future because that would mean I have improved my game to be as good as he is. 

That is Nadals ambition. My ambition is to be a very, very normal guy. A very humble guy. To play tennis, which I love and I want to be the best. And, when Im done, I just want to be at home with my friends. 

Home is Mallorca, where he lives with three generations of his family ? grandparents, parents and sister in the village of Manacor. It is a village 10 kilometres away from the sea. When I was a kid, I played on the beach, went swimming, played in my parents boat. I played tennis and football with my friends. I got one thousand friends. 

He is still coached by his uncle Toni and enjoying the same genetic inheritance as another uncle, Miguel Angel, the Spanish football star who played for Barcelona for nine years. Nadals English is also good enough to proudly list the World Cups his uncle attended as a Spanish squad member: United States, France and Korea, he said. He could not go to any of them, little Rafa, not being born for the first, too tiny for the second, and practising tennis for the third. 

But he knows the history of his uncles career and loyally disputes that the Beast of Barcelona was ever an appropriate soubriquet for his famous relative. He was a little bit similar to me in physique, but he was a very classy player. 

We may not see the best of Rafa at Wimbledon this year. Emotionally, physically, he may find the adjustment too great after his wonder-season on clay. But it will come, his challenge to the dominance of Federer and the Royal Box at Wimbledon had better get used to the presence of the Spanish monarchy. 

It seemed only right to advise Nadal of English protocol, just in case. While it is fine to embrace King Juan Carlos (and cover him with clay), he cannot manhandle our Queen Elizabeth. Is ok, he said, understandingly. Im too shy.

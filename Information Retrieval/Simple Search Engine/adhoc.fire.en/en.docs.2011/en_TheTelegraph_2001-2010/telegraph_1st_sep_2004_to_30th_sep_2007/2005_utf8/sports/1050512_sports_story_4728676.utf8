 Dont write off Henry, warns Wenger

JOHN LEY

Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, having been almost written off, could feature in the FA Cup final. Arsene Wenger also warned that Henry could be sharper and fitter if he is given the go-ahead to lead Arsenals attack at the Millennium Stadium a week on Saturday. 

Henry has missed the last five games with a groin injury but was a surprise inclusion in Wednesdays squad for the Everton game. He could possibly start the final Premiership game of the season, on Sunday at Birmingham. Wenger said: He has worked very hard in training. I expected the season to be over for him, but in the last week he has improved tremendously. 

The Arsenal manager promised he would not take risks with Henrys fitness, adding: I wouldnt play him, even in the Cup final, if there was the slightest risk. 

Henry has scored 30 goals this season but Wenger admitted: He needed a break physically. The body was telling him to take a breather. He wants always to play but maybe he will have to be a little more cautious. He thought his season was over as well, but he may be sharper when he returns than he was before he got this injury. He was getting a little bit tired. 

Arsenal are missing Gilberto Silva, who has an ankle problem, but the Brazilian should return to face Birmingham while Freddie Ljungberg, suffering from a hip injury, could also be closer to making the final, particularly if, as Wenger hopes, he can give the Swede at least a half at Birmingham. 

The position of Sol Campbell, however, remains unclear. Campbell, having recovered from an ankle injury, has sat on the bench for the last three games while Philippe Senderos continues to impress in defence. Campbell has not featured in a first-team game since February and Wenger has yet to determine if he will face Manchester United. 

Edu could make his farewell appearance at Highbury after the Brazilian confirmed on Tuesday that he will be leaving the club.

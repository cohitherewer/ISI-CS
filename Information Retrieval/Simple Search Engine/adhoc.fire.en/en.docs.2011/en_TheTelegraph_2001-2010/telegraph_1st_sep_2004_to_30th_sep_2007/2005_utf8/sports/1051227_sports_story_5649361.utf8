 Deep slams 124 n.o.

 Deep looked in sublime touch 

Surat: A captains knock of unbeaten 124 by Deep Dasgupta and his unborken 172-run eighth-wicket stand with Shiv Sagar Singh helped Bengal post 405 for seven wickets against Gujarat on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match at the Lalabhai Contractor Stadium on Monday. 

On winning the toss, Gujarat invited Bengal to bat and the visitors were 195 for three with former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar (26) and Manoj Tewari (2) remained unbeaten at the close of play on Day I. 

But Gavaskar could add only three runs before being judged leg before to A. Makda only in the third over of the day after Tewari had already departed in the previous over without adding anything to his overnight score. 

Captain Deep Dasgupta looked in sublime form and his unbeaten 124 was laced with 10 boundaries. 

He was ably assisted by left-arm spinner Shiv Sagar Singh, who scored a flawless 46. His 46 comprised three fours. 

The duo added 172 runs for the eighth wicket and the platform was set for Bengal to collect two crucial points from the outing. 

Deep and Sib Sagar consolidated the Bengal innings after Gujarat pacer Siddharth Trivedi took two successive wickets to reduce the visitors to 198 for five after they resumed at overnight 193 for three. 

Deep was dropped in slips by Niraj Patel at his individual score of 36 while facing the delivery of Hemal Watekar. Trivedi took four for 81. 

Earlier, on Day I, Bengal was in a stable position due to a 64 by opener Arindam Das and a vital 72 by Avishek Jhunjhunwala.

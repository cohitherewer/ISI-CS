 Liaison floors rivals in 1000 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Romantic Liaison fully justified her superior class while winning the Calcutta 1,000 Guineas, the first Classic of the season on Sunday. The hottest order in the eight-event card floored her four rivals after taking charge of running from long-time leader Clockwork, her stablemate, at the top of the final turn. C.Alford partnered the Vijay Singh-trainee to victory.

 The afternoon also witnessed a scintillating performance from another of Vijays runner, Aperitivo, in the 1,400m Mayfowl Cup. Assigned a topweight of 60kg, the last winters Derby winner found the opposition, including the lowly placed stablemate, Formal Invitation, an easy prey. 

 Rasalas, who failed as a favourite in the monsoon Derby, met another good one in Vijays Aristotle, who was enjoying a sizeable weight advantage in the 1,600m Burning Fire Cup. At level terms, the two youngsters are expected clash again in the 2,000 Guineas. All the three winners were partnered by jockey C.Alford.

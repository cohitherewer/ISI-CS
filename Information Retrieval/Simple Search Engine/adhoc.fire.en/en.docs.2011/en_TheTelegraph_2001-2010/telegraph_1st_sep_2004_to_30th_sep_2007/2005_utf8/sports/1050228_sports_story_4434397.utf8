 DiMarco, Toms in all-American final

Carlsbad (California): Chris DiMarco completed a week of upsets at the WGC-Accenture matchplay championship on Saturday, beating fourth seed Retief Goosen to set up an all-American final with Ryder Cup team mate David Toms. 

With world number one Vijai Singh and Tiger Woods, the 2003 and 2004 champion, leading the elite 64-player field, few would have tipped a DiMarco-Toms showdown when the rain-delayed $7.5 million event began a day late on Thursday. 

The match play format, though, continued to live up to its unpredictable reputation. 

DiMarco, without a tournament win in nearly three years, rallied from three down to dismiss South African Goosen 2 amp; 1 while Toms reached the final for the second time in three years with a 3 amp; 2 victory over Britain?s Ian Poulter. 

It marks the fourth consecutive year two Americans will play in the final, which is decided over 36 holes and is worth $1.3 million to the winner. 

?We?ve played a lot together over the years, we?re friends,? said Toms, the only man apart from Woods to reach the final twice. 

?We have similar games as far as length and everything goes. He (DiMarco) is a very tough competitor and will never give in at any time, no matter what the situation.? 

DiMarco, who had never advanced past the third round in four previous visits to the La Costa Resort and Spa, displayed plenty of that grit after going three down after three holes. 

Goosen, who enjoyed good fortune most of the tournament, saw his luck change on the par-five eighth when his tee shot lodged in the tangled branches of a tree. 

As the gallery cheered, his caddie was hoisted up the tree but could not shake the ball free, the South African finally conceding the hole as his advantage was trimmed to one up. 

Seizing his chance, DiMarco carded four birdies in five holes from the 10th, clinching his spot in the final when Goosen missed a two-foot par putt at the 17th. 

?I was down three, through three, that?s not too good against Retief,? said DiMarco, who began the day with a 2 amp; 1 quarter-final triumph over compatriot Stewart Cink. 

?I just tried to stay patient. I had about a six-footer on number five to stay only three down and I made it.?

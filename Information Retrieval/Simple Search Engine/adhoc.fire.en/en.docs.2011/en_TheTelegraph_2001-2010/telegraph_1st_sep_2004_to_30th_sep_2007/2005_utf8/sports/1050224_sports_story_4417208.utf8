 Md Islam pushes into lead

New Delhi: Md Islam put to good use his new driver to fire a superb round of five-under 67 and assume the opening round lead at the Rs 10-lakh Sir Padampat Singhania Open at the Noida Golf Course Wednesday. 

The Chandigarh duo of Gurbaaz Mann and Amritinder Singh impressed with rounds of four-under 68 each which tied them at second position, one higher than Bangalore?s Gaurav Diwan. 

Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia (Calcutta) and S. Madhaiah (Banglore) were tied for fifth place at two-under 70. 

A tenth tee starter, Islam struck gold early with a birdie on the 12th before following it with similar efforts on the 14th and 15th before a bogey on the 16th halted the good work, according to information received here. 

Meanwhile, Shaurya Singh fired a round of level-par 72 to lead the amateur field over Aparup Saikia who was positioned two strokes behind.

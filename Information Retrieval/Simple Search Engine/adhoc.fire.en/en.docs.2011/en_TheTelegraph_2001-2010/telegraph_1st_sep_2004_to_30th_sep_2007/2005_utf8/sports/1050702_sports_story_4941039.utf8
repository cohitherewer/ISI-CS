 - TRI-SERIES FINAL

 Saturday will be about who handles pressure better: Vaughan

London: England and Australia have met four times in the past three weeks but the serious business begins in earnest with Saturdays tri-series final. 

With Bangladesh removed from the equation, the two teams go head-to-head in four one-dayers and five Tests over the coming two-and-a-half months. 

Australias Twenty20 defeat by England, according to Ricky Ponting, was something to laugh off while the one-day Internationals ? one win each, with the rain claiming the third ? were mere group games leading to Lords. 

Saturdays winners, however, will be able to claim the first genuine psychological points of the English summer. 

Some would argue things began turning serious on Tuesday. 

The meeting at Birmingham may have been washed out but featured an altercation between Matthew Hayden and Simon Jones which suggested competitive tensions were on the rise. 

Significantly, though, Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff was quick to move in, ready to barge their way into the argument in support of their teammate. That suggested that the English, despite eight consecutive Ashes series defeats and 15 losses against Australia in 17 one-dayers, are geared up for battle. 

England captain Michael Vaughan, however, has played down the bad feeling. 

Both teams are competitive, he told a news conference on Friday. Australia arent really more vociferous than other teams. They are just a good team who play it hard. You cant get drawn into confrontations if it affects your performance. 

I have always said you stick together as a team but you do your talking with the bat and ball. I dont go out to promote confrontations in the middle. 

Vaughan also rejected the idea that England had lacked such feistiness in the past. We have always been well up to the challenge of playing Australia, he said. Both teams have played good cricket. I think Saturday will be about who handles the pressure better on the day. 

The world champions, though, head for Lords as firm favourites, despite their slow start to the tournament which began with an extraordinary defeat by Bangladesh. 

Australia have been steadily improving ever since. Strike bowler Brett Lee and allrounder Andrew Symonds missed those opening defeats but have both looked razor-sharp since. Symonds is averaging 94.5 with the bat and 15.16 with the ball. 

Englands Test side were magnificent in 2004 but the one-day team has yet to make a similar breakthrough. They lost their last series 1-4 in South Africa. 

Kevin Pietersen lived up to the hype with an extraordinary 91 not out off 65 balls against Australia at Bristol but key weaknesses remain. 

Darren Gough has failed to take a single top-order wicket during the tri-series. Ashley Giles remains a canny defensive bowler, conceding 4.3 runs an over, but has only taken one wicket for his 168 runs conceded. 

Bangladeshs young side, meanwhile, head home with pride. Their five-wicket over Australia in Cardiff was widely regarded as the biggest shock in one-day International history.

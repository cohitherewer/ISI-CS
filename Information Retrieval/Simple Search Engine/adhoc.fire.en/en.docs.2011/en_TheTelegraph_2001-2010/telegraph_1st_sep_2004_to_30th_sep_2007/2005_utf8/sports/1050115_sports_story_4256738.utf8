Johannesburg: England captain Michael Vaughan returned to form as his team recovered from a middle order collapse on a rain-hit second day of the fourth Test against South Africa at the Wanderers Friday. 

Vaughan?s unbeaten 82 enabled England to recover from 278 for seven to reach a first innings total of 411 for eight at the close. 

When bad light stopped play it was the South Africans who accepted the offer from the umpires, with Vaughan and ninth wicket partner Steve Harmison keen to continue punishing a bewildered bowling attack. 

Vaughan and Harmison thrashed 82 runs in 72 minutes off only 91 balls as the advantage swung back to England after South Africa dominated the early part of a disjointed day in which only 38.2 overs were bowled. 

England?s strong position seemed unlikely after they had lost five wickets for 16 runs against Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini, who were able to bowl the first 29 overs in tandem with the second new ball because of breaks in play. 

There was plenty of life in the pitch after overnight rain, which continued into the morning, delayed the start by more than two hours. 

Vaughan, with a previous highest score of 20 in six innings in the series, saw five partners depart while he scored only 15 runs. 

Then Ashley Giles joined him and provided stoic support in an eighth wicket stand of 51, forcing South African captain Graeme Smith to make his first bowling change of the day, with Dale Steyn replacing Ntini. 

Steyn dismissed Giles for 26 with his first ball of the day but Harmison continued in the form which saw him make top score of 42, batting at No. 11, in the final innings of the third Test in cape town. 

Harmison, going for his shots, hit an unbeaten 30 off 49 balls. 

Vaughan, who took 131 balls to reach his half-century, finished the day on 82 off 159 deliveries with ten fours and a hooked six off Ntini.

 Robben worry for Van Basten

Birmingham: Netherlands coach Marco van Basten is putting a brave face on the prospect of losing Arjen Robben for their next two World Cup qualifiers. 

Already missing for Wednesday?s friendly against England at Villa Park, the Chelsea winger has a foot injury that could keep him out of the qualifiers against Romania and Armenia in late March. 

?We?re not happy about it, but that?s the situation,? Van Basten said on Tuesday. ?We hope he is able to recover quickly for us, but also for Chelsea and for football in general, because he?s a very attractive player and everyone wants to see him on the field. 

?He?s a big player, very important, for us. But, on the other hand, in the last six games he?s only played once against Andorra and we?ve had good results without him. Nothing is impossible. 

?It?s a pity but we have to handle this situation,? said the former Netherlands and AC Milan playing great, whose career was cut short by injury. 

?Maybe it?s part of his career. He?s becoming a big player so everybody wants to stop him...it?s a situation where he has to become maybe a little bit cleverer.? 

One England player who is already on the Dutch radar is promising winger Shaun Wright-Phillips.

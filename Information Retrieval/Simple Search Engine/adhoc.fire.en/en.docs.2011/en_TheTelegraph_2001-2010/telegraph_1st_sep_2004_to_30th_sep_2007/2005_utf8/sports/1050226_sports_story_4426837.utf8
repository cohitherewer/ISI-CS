 Streak back in ZC fold

 Streak?s move paves the way for return of other rebel players 

Durban: Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak has signed a contract to play for his country again after a year-long exile, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) said in a statement on Friday. 

The move paves the way for a return of a large group of rebel white players who walked out in April in a dispute with the Zimbabwe board over selection policies. 

The team temporarily lost its Test status last year as a result of the row and has struggled to compete since, reaching a low point when they lost a Test and one-day series to Bangladesh at the start of the year. 

?Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak has signed a contract to play again for Zimbabwe,? the ZC statement said. 

The affair had begun when Streak, a world-class bowling allrounder, who would get in most international sides, lost the captaincy. The board said he had resigned but he said he had been sacked. 

When 14 other players walked out in support of Streak, the Zimbabwe board responded by sacking them, leading to months of bitter recriminations. Attempts by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to solve the crisis failed. 

The players argued the team was being selected along racial lines while the board accused them of undermining efforts to broaden the game?s appeal in the country. 

?I just need to finalise some aspects of my contract with Warwickshire so that it ties in with my international commitments,? Streak said in the statement. 

?Otherwise I am ready to play for Zimbabwe when selected. I am putting my weight fully behind the captain, Tatenda Taibu, and the rest of the lads.? 

A Zimbabwe government committee is trying to resolve the dispute in meetings involving the rebel players and ZC. (Reuters)

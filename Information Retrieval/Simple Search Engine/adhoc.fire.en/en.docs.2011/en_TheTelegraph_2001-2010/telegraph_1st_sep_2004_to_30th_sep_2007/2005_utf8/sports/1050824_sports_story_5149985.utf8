 NZ thinking more about super-sub than Zimbabwe

Bulawayo: Even against an opposition as weak as Zimbabwe, New Zealand were worrying about their options for super-sub ahead of the tri-series opener against Zimbabwe here on Wednesday. 

If we bat first and collapse, we would consider pulling a bowler out and introducing an extra batsman, said New Zealand coach John Bracewell, but given the present state of Zimbabwe cricket, the statement seemed generous to the extreme. 

New Zealand took just five days to thrash the hosts by an innings margin in the two Tests preceding the one-day series and a practice game on Monday did not go beyond 25 overs. Still, the new ODI rules and the planning it requires has kept New Zealand well occupied. 

Captain Stephen Fleming isnt in favour of the substitutes rule. Its false, it detracts from the game and doesnt add any meaning to it, Fleming said. 

The substitute also means that the team that wins the toss starts the match with a distinct advantage. 

 The new rules allow 20 of 50 stipulated overs to be played in a restricted field and a team could replace any of its playing 11 with a super substitute at any stage of the match. 

New Zealands top order has been wobbly on this tour and Bracewells remarks imply that allrounders Scott Syris, Jacob Oram and Chris Cairns can expect to play a full part, leaving Craig Mcmillan and Lou Vincent to vie for the subs position. 

It just doesnt make any sense for us to nominate any of our allrounders as the sub because theyre our best one-day players and we want them in the game as much as possible. 

So were looking at the idea of crisis management; naming a batsman to guard against the consequences of being put in on a green seamer, said Bracewell. 

New Zealand were anxious about Nathan Astle who dislocated the ring finger on his right hand on the last day of the second Test. All other players were fit and available for the start of the series. 

Zimbabwe, on the other hand, are adding their bit to the irony. They are opting to have specialist one-day and Test teams which, given their poor bench strength, seems an ambitious exercise. 

Test regulars Dion Ebrahim, Neil Ferreira and Graeme Cremer and fast bowler Christopher Mpofu have been axed and in their place Prosper Utseya, Gavin Ewing, Charles Coventry, Vusimuzi Sibanda and Chamunorwa Chibhabha have been included. 

Coventry and Chibhabha are coming in after doing well against Pakistan A in the warm-up games. Chibhabha can be a good option at the top of the order while Coventry is meant for the middle order as he enjoys spin. Utseya is a good spinner and Ewing is useful with both bat and ball. 

Star allrounder Andy Blignaut is back in the squad and will add some flair to the side. Former captain Heath Streak too has a lot to do to make up for an average Test series. 

Skipper Tatenda Taibu has earned respect for his performances both as the wicketkeeper and a batsman. 

The toss could be critical, if that expression can be used against Zimbabwe, because of the early morning dew. Fast bowlers can call the shots in the opening hours before batsmen find their feet in the afternoon. 

Indians, who arrived in Harare on Tuesday, will be lucky to reach Bulawayo before the opening game gets underway and coach Greg Chappell may miss watching Shane Bond in action.

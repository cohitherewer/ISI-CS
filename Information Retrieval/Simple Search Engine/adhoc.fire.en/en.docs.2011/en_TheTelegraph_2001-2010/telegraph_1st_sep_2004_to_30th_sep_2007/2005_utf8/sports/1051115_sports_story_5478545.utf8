Hyderabad: South Africa warmed up for the upcoming five-match limited overs series against India with a strong eight-wicket win against a Hyderabad Cricket Association XI on Monday. 

Making most of the early dew conditions, the South African seamers bundled out HCA XI for a paltry 127 before knocking off the target in just 25.5 overs. 

Right-arm seamer Andre Nel returned with two for 14 while Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini and Justin Kemp exploited the favourable conditions to pick one wicket apiece. 

The best bowler on view was however spinner Johan Botha who claimed three for 54 with his teasing flight. 

After testing their bowling strength, the South African batsmen waded into the weak HCA bowling. 

Skipper Graeme Smith scored a blistering 44 off 45 balls with a towering six and six boundaries. 

AB de Villiers played a sensible knock of 55 with two fours and sixes each. South Africa were to play their first one-dayer against India in Hyderabad on Wednesday.

Calcutta: It was Nigerian Suley Musah who brought Mohammedan Sporting back to winning ways in the CFL Premier Division. Man-of-the-Match Musah scored in the second minute, while Abdul Kadir added a second in the 20th to help Mohammedan Sporting down Ever-Ready at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

On a slushy ground, the men in black-and-white capitalised on some early pressure with Musah showing flashes of his old brilliance. 

Musah, picking up the ball in the Ever-Ready area, moved up and took a long-ranger which took a deflection off a defender and beat a diving Shibram Dey. 

Happy with a one-goal cushion, coach Biswajit Bhattacharya decided to put Musah in charge of the defence. 

Mohammedan Sporting, firmly in control of proceedings, doubled the lead courtesy a Kadir solo effort. Cutting in from the left, he outpaced two defenders and smartly lobbed the ball over the custodian. Mohammedan Sporting slowed the pace and managed to keep the ball away from their danger area. 

Mohammedan Sporting are now on 13 points from 10 matches, while Ever-Ready remained on 12 after 11 outings.

 Pursuit may win in Mysore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Foolish Pursuit, from Vishal Yadavs yard, and to be partnered by A. Quereshi, looks in fine trim to lift the 1600m Nagahole Plate, at the Mysore races on Wednesday.

 The Kristal Rock-Merry Madonna gelding may, however, face serious opposition from Star Trustee, Crow Wood and stablemate Summer Storm. But over the mile trip, it may be the Pursuits day.

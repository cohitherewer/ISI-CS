The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Henry injury has healed, not his melancholy

 - Only a transfer to Spain can be the permanent cure 

 MATT DICKINSON 

 Even a sulking Henry 

 is capable of moments of matchwinning brilliance 

 In times of trouble, a team looks 

 to its senior players and, above all, to its captain, but 

 what if the captain himself is desperately in need of a 

 lift? That is the problem at Arsenal where, although Thierry 

 Henrys groin has healed, there are fears that his 

 melancholy could last for months.

 His malaise, a common one that 

 has been known to twice afflict Steven Gerrard before he 

 made a full recovery, begins as a nagging concern that everyone 

 else is winning medals. Before too long, the player is refusing 

 to sign a new contract or dropping hints through the newspapers 

 (and often denying the quotes afterwards) that his ambition 

 is not being matched by his club.

 In Henrys case, recovery 

 from injury may see an immediate upturn in his mood but 

 there are grave concerns among his employers that only a 

 transfer to Spain can act as a permanent cure for his frustrations.

 The prospect of him forming a 

 fearsome attacking trident with Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto 

 is said to be the talk of the Barcelona dressing room.

 Arsenal, however, have not given 

 up all hope of persuading Henry to extend his contract but 

 well-placed sources are already saying that the best they 

 may be able to hope for is an auction between Barcelona 

 and Real Madrid to drive up the price.

 Otherwise, it is a buyers 

 market as Liverpool discovered to their cost when they had 

 to sell Michael Owen to Real Madrid for ?8 million rather 

 than risk him walking out for nothing 12 months later.

 Henry will have only one year 

 left and so expect an opening bid from Barcelona to be about 

 ?20 million; less than half the ?50 million Roman Abramovich 

 once offered which, given the lingering emnity between Arsenal 

 and Chelsea, would still not be nearly enough.

 Even a sulking Henry is capable 

 of moments of matchwinning brilliance but the uncertainty 

 over his future, and his inability to mask his disenchantment 

 at Arsenals decline in the 12 months since they were 

 renowned as the Invincibles, could overshadow a campaign 

 that, in managerspeak, was always likely to be transitional. 

 Or bloody frustrating in terrace vernacular.

 Selling Patrick Vieira, at 29, 

 to Juventus for about ?14 million made sense to Wenger and 

 his board but the players have performed as though they 

 still need convincing that it was the right decision. At 

 times, like in surrendering the lead to lose 1-2 at West 

 Bromwich Albion on Saturday, a young team has been searching 

 for its leader.

 Vieira has gone and, for all his 

 many gifts, Henry is not a natural successor to Tony Adams.

 It all adds up to a difficult 

 campaign for Wenger so it is as well that he has more credit 

 than Abramovichs savings account. Arsenal owe more 

 to the Frenchman than to the financial organisations who 

 have funded the new ?400 million stadium at Ashburton Grove.

 There are valid criticisms, such 

 as his failure to reinforce his squad ? with ?20 million-plus 

 available according to some sources ? but, in footballs 

 world of excess, it seems rich to have a go at a manager 

 for spending his clubs money as if it was his own. 

 Particularly at Highbury, where one manager thought Arsenals 

 money was his own, and had to give it back.

 The other, common failing 

 of Arsenal is said to be their over-elaboration. Unashamedly 

 aesthetic, Wenger can hardly be expected to apologise for 

 trying to play pretty football at a time when the whole 

 country is supposedly pleading for a break from 4-5-1.

 With his squad at present depleted 

 by injuries, the passing patterns are all too easy to disrupt 

 and Wenger can be sure of a lack of sympathy from a couple 

 of his managerial counterparts. Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex 

 Ferguson seize every opportunity to undermine the Frenchman 

 ? or old vinegar face as one of his rivals has 

 been known to describe him.

 After their recent disputes, Chelsea, 

 in particular, will take glee from Arsenals lowly 

 eighth-place but, if this campaign represents one of Wengers 

 biggest tests, there is an enduring faith beyond N5 that 

 The Professor can return with another great 

 team.

 If you doubt that, just ask most 

 neutrals in London whether they would take a season ticket 

 to Highbury or Stamford Bridge. The majority would not choose 

 the home of the English champions, even after a weekend 

 when the gap between them stretched to 14 points.

 Narain happy to complete clean lap

Budapest: Narain Karthikeyan on Saturday completed a clean race in trying conditions in the qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix and is now hoping to finish for the second Sunday in succession. 

Karthikeyan, who left as fourth driver after Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro returned to the stands with no times, finished 18th, clocking 1:25.057, ahead of Robert Doornbos (1.25.484) in a Minardi. 

Michael Schumacher grabbed his first pole position of the season with a 1:19.882. Juan Pablo Montoya was second (1.20.779) and Jarno Trulli third (1.20.839). 

Karthikeyan said: I am pleased to have completed a clean lap for qualifying under these very hot conditions. At the end, I am positioned between our two most direct competitors which gives us a good indication that they are on different fuel load ? and as this is so important for the race it may really be different on their two cars. 

Overall, I hope I have understood how the F1 track works and will be able to complete a good race with a finish result on Sunday. 

This morning I completed 14 laps in the fourth session, improving my time to 1.24.265. I had completed 10 laps in the earlier session as the temperature was not so hot with a time of 1.25.721. I can say that we made good progress with chassis set-up during the final two practice sessions. (PTI)

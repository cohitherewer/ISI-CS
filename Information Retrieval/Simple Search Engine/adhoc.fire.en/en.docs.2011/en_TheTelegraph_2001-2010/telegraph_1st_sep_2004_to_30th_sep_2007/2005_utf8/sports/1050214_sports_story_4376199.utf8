 Hari eyes 2700-mark 

Bermuda: P. Harikrishna is still in his teens but having reached the doorstep of the 2700 elo mark, he is eager to be among its elite members. 

?I would like to reach there as soon as possible. I had set myself 2650 as the first goal after winning the world juniors. After my performance here, I am already knocking on that door,? said world junior champion Harikrishna in an exclusive interview soon after his joint triumph in the category-17 international invitational tournament. 

And the unmistakable determination in his eyes is a just indication that the Hyderabad lad is as much capable of realising his immediate dreams. 

?2700 obviously is the next target and even though I am aware that it will be a giant leap forward, I am going to give it my best shot in the coming months,? he said. 

There are only around a dozen chess players with or above 2700 including the only Indian in Viswanathan Anand. 

Speaking about his performance in general in his first major round-robin tournament abroad Harikrishna, who gained 14 elo points here to be 2646, seemed pleased. 

?I came here just to get a feeling about how players like Boris Gelfand (co-winner in the event) have maintained themselves near the top for so long. I learned a whole lot of new things from their level of preparation and I am happy that I played well too,? said Harikrishna, who also won the world under-10 title almost a decade back. (PTI)

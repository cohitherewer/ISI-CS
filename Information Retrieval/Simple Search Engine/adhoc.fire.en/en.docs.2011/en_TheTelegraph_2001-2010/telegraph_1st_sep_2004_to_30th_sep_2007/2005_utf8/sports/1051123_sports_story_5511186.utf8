 Lahore: Chiragh Kumar and Vaishnavi Sinha of India won the 45th Pakistan Amateur Golf Championships titles at the Lahore Gymkhana Golf Club course over the weekend. Chiragh carded four-under par to beat stiff competition from local favourite M Saddiq and Sidiqur Rehman of Bangladesh, who had won the All India Championship last year. The Indian finished with a four-day aggregate of 277 (68, 71, 67, 71). Saddiq clinched the second spot with 281.

 Vaishavi earned the second title for India, while teammate Sharmila Nicollet was runner-up.

 London: Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic has been named in Croatia?s team for next month?s Davis Cup final against Slovakia in Bratislava from December 2-4. Ivanisevic, 35, who retired from professional tennis after Wimbledon in 2004, is likely to be used in the doubles only if Ivan Ljubicic or Mario Ancic are injured or exhausted after the first day?s singles.

 London: Formula One fans have voted Renault?s world champion Fernando Alonso their Man of the Year and McLaren?s Kimi Raikkonen driver of the year in an online poll conducted by a Formula One racing magazine.

 The magazine, which claims a worldwide readership of three million for its various editions, said 43,612 people had responded.

 Spaniard Alonso, who was also named Personality of the Year, took 32.3 per cent of the vote with his Finnish rival on 31.5. The positions were reversed for Driver of the Year with Raikkonen polling 1,832 more votes.

 Madrid: Real Madrid and Spain captain Raul says he is hopeful he will be able to recover from a serious knee injury in time to help his club win a trophy this season and lead his country at next year?s World Cup.

 Club doctors said on Tuesday they planned to follow a ?conservative? programme of treatment to deal with a partially torn cruciate ligament and cartilage damage in his left knee.

 ?There was a moment in which I thought I would be out for a very long time,? the striker told a news conference on Tuesday. ?That still may happen, but the probability is that I will be back in a much shorter period.

 ?At the moment there are no dates set, but it might take three or four months to see how the knee responds, but I can see myself helping Real win a trophy and then playing in the World Cup.?

 Istanbul: Assistant Turkey coach Mehmet Ozdilek has resigned following the fracas between Turkish and Swiss players after the World Cup play-off last week, the Turkey federation said on Tuesday.

 TV pictures showed Ozdilek trying to trip up one of the Swiss players as he ran off the pitch. Swiss international Benjamin Huggel retaliated by kicking Ozdilek in the back of the leg. The Eintracht Frankfurt player has since received threats of violence against himself and his family.

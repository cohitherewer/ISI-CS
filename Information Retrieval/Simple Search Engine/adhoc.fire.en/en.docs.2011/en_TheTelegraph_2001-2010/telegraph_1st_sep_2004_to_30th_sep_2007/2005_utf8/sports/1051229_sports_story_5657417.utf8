 Nine-wicket victory for Mumbai

Mumbai: Mumbai thumped Tamil Nadu by nine wickets in their Ranji Trophy Group A Elite Division match at the Wankhede Stadium here on Wednesday and shot to the top of the pool table. 

Set a target of 197 in 38 overs by the visitors, the hosts won after a solid start from openers Sahil Kukreja (80 not out) and Vinayak Samant (67). 

The Mumbai openers put on 129 runs in only 26 overs to give the home team a flying start and then Pakistan-bound Wasim Jaffer scored an unbeaten 44 in just 19 balls. 

Resuming at their overnight score of 202 for five, Tamil Nadu did well to lose only the wicket of captain Badani in the two-and-a-half hour first session to be 290 for six at the interval. 

The fightback was led by the 99-run stand, occupying 39 overs, by left-handers Sharath and Naresh before both departed in the space of 3.4 overs. 

While Mumbai got four points to boost their points tally to 12 with two matches in hand, Tamil Nadu remained stuck on five.

Chennai: Sourav Ganguly is not worried about his position in the batting order on his return to the Team India XI after serving out a four-match ban. 

I will go by the team managements decision? I am confident about my own performance, Sourav said at the Chennai airport before emplaning Sunday night for Sri Lanka where he will join the squad as the 16th member. 

Earlier, speaking to newsmen at the Calcutta airport, Sourav said India could have won the first game (versus Sri Lanka on Saturday), too, had the batsmen put a few more runs on the board. 

It was a close match. It would have been good if we had a few more runs on the board, Sourav remarked. But it was only the first match of the season, there are many more matches to go? 

Sourav said it felt great to be returning to action after a three-month lay-off. 

He praised Rahul Dravids captaincy and reiterated that he had no problems playing under him. 

Yesterday I was the skipper, today Rahul has taken my place, tomorrow someone else may lead India. Thats very natural, he said. 

The left hander had a word of praise for Y. Venugopal Rao too. He played well (versus Lanka). Slowly but surely he will shape up as a fine player. (Agencies)

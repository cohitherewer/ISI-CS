 Federer, Sharapova post scrappy wins 

 - A good day for Leander, Mahesh and Sania Davenport to meet Clijsters 

 Roger Federer returns a backhand to Nicolas Kiefer during their third-round 

 match at Wimbledon on Saturday

London: It takes more than talent to make a champion, and both Maria Sharapova and Roger Federer needed a sprinkle of that something special on Saturday to keep their Wimbledon defence alive. 

While there was more base metal than gold in their performances, both managed to do just enough on a day when they would rather have stayed at home. 

An off-colour Federer, who had been due to play on Friday before rain wiped out the schedule, failed to stamp his authority on Nicolas Kiefer but had enough in reserve to advance 6-2, 6-7, 6-1, 7-5. 

He plays Juan Carlos Ferrero next after the Spaniard beat German Florian Mayer 3-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1. 

That was definitely a test today... definitely, said Federer, who is bidding for a third successive Wimbledon title. I had the feeling I shouldve won in three sets but in the end I am happy to have won in four. 

Sharapova posted a scrappy 6-2, 6-4 win over Slovenias Katarina Srebotnik and will be happy to have got the first week out of the way at the All England Club. 

The score doesnt say much about the match, second seed Sharapova said. It was a lot tougher than it seemed. Definitely a tough match... every single point, I needed to find a way to win it. 

Sharapova was joined in the fourth round by 1999 champion and top seed Lindsay Davenport and twice champion Venus Williams. Fourteenth seed Venus beat Daniela Hantuchova 7-5, 6-3. 

Davenport strolled through 6-2 6-1 against Russias Dinara Safina. She next faces former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters. The Belgian beat Italian Roberta Vinci 6-3, 6-4. 

Mondays going to be a lot different story, Davenport said. Kims not going to let me do that so easily and will get more balls back and will really press me a lot more. 

Surprise French Open finalist Mary Pierce advanced with great authority. The 30-year-old Frenchwoman, a first-round loser last year, blasted Serbian teenager Ana Ivanovic 6-1, 6-4. 

Second seed Andy Roddick romped into the last-32 with a 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 win over Russian Igor Andreev. Young Frenchman Richard Gasquet also made Round 4 with a convincing 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Gilles Muller of Luxembourg. 

Gasquets experienced countryman Sebastien Grosjean, a semi-finalist in the last two years, needed all his experience to subdue teenaged Serb qualifier Novak Djokovic 7-5, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. 

Eighth seed Nadia Petrova also advanced with ease, the Russian beating Zimbabwes Cara Black 6-4 6-3. Petrova will next face Czech Kveta Peschke who beat 1994 champion Conchita Martinez 6-4, 6-1. 

Meanwhile, the Indians enjoyed a successful day at the All England Club, with Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza all tasting success. 

Paes and Nenad Zimonjic finally won their mens doubles first-round match which got underway three days ago. The fifth-seeded Indo-Serbian pair saw off Lucas Arnold (Argentina) and Daniele Bracciali (Italy) 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 and will next meet Rick Leach and Travis Parrott. 

The match was evenly poised when play was suspended on Wednesday with the teams sharing the opening two sets. The players could not play for the next two days because of frequent rain interruptions. 

Paes and Zimonjic next face American pair Rick Leach and Travis Parrott. 

Mahesh Bhupathi and Pierce beat David Sherwood and 

Elena Baltacha 6-3, 6-4, while Sania and her Swedish partner Simon Aspelin battled 

past Gaston Etlis and Lisa McShea 6-7, 6-2, 7-5 in mixed doubles first-round encounters.

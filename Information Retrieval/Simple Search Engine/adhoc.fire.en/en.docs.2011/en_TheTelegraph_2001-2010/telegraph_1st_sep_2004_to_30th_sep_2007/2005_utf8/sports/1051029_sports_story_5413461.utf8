The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Maharoofs lessons from Hindi films 

 - Lankan a big fan of Hrithik, Aishwarya 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Fervez Maharoof 

Mohali: Arre bhai, ek chai le ana, was directed at one of the Taj Chandigarh waiters by Fervez Maharoof and not a Virender Sehwag, at breakfast on Friday. Impressed, the waiter obliged quicker than he normally would have. 

Even the masala dosa was served at express speed. 

On being complimented by The Telegraph for such fluent Hindi, the allrounder said: Its thanks to the Hindi films that I can speak pretty well... The dialogues have helped me improve... Communicating with anybody isnt going to be a problem on this tour. 

Maharoof is a big fan of Hrithik Roshan and Abhishek Bachchan as also Aishwarya Rai and Preity Zinta. The last Hindi movie seen by him, though, is Aetbaar (starring John Abraham, Bipasha Basu and the legendary Amitabh Bachchan). 

I dont know whether Ill get an opportunity to see one of the movies in a theatre, but Im definitely going to add to my DVD collection, he added. 

Muttiah Muralidharan, too, is a big one for Hindi films.

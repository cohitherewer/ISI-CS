 NZ govt leaves it to players

Wellington: New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark doesn?t support a tour to Zimbabwe by the national cricket team, but her government isn?t prepared to underwrite any financial penalties resulting from a player boycott. 

Replying to a question in parliament, Clark restated her personal view that the tour should not proceed but said any moral decision on the August tour should be left to individual players. 

The ICC could fine New Zealand as much as $2 million for defaulting on its playing obligations, including the trip to Zimbabwe which forms part of its international schedule of tours. 

NZC chief executive Martin Snedden has refused to comment as pressure increases on individual cricketers to boycott Zimbabwe. 

In response to a question from Donald in parliament in Wellington on Tuesday, Clark said the issue of whether the tour proceeded was not for the government. 

?I was expressing my personal view, but the decision as to whether the New Zealand cricket team tours Zimbabwe is one for the players and New Zealand Cricket to make,? Clark said. (AP)

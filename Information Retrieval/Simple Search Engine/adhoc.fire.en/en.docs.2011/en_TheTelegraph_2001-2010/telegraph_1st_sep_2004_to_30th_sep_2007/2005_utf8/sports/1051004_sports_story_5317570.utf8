Madrid: Real Madrids Brazilian contingent overwhelmed Real Mallorca 4-0 in the Bernabeu on Sunday and helped move the team up to third in the Primera Liga. 

England midfielder David Beckham put in another eye-catching performance, setting up three of the goals. 

Brazilian striker Ronaldo scored the opener after 32 minutes and compatriot Roberto Carlos volleyed a spectacular second just before the break. 

Roberto Carlos made it three with a free kick after 66 minutes and another Brazilian, Julio Baptista, added a fourth 13 minutes from time. 

Mallorca, the leagues bottom club, had defender Sergio Ballesteros sent off for a second yellow card offence in the 76th minute. 

Celta Vigo missed out on the chance to return to the top of the standings when they were held to a 1-1 draw in Cadiz earlier in the day. 

Getafe remain top with 14 points after they beat Valencia 2-1 on Saturday, a point ahead of Celta in second. 

Osasuna are fourth, level on 12 points with Real but with fewer goals scored. Barcelona are fifth with nine points after coming from behind to draw 2-2 at home to Real Zaragoza on Saturday. 

Mallorca, who had spoken of attacking Real before their visit to the Bernabeu, lived up to their promise early on. 

Japan forward Yoshito Okubo and midfielder Alejandro Campano unsettled the home defence, the former having a goal ruled out for offside after 25 minutes. 

But Real were always the more dangerous side with the midfield duo of Beckham and Baptista dictating terms. 

Raul had a shot saved on the line before Beckham set Ronaldo free on the right flank in a swift counter-attack shortly after the half-hour. 

The Brazilian cut in, made a step-over and thumped a left-footed shot inside the far post for his fifth goal of the season. 

Beckham was instrumental in the second, swinging a corner to the waiting Roberto Carlos outside the penalty area, from where the Brazilian unleashed a volley low into the corner. 

France midfielder Zinedine Zidane made his first appearance after four weeks out with a groin strain when he was brought on for Guti in the 61st minute. 

Englands Jonathan Woodgate soon joined him on the pitch but it was Roberto Carlos who scored the third with a fierce free kick. 

Ballesteros received his marching orders after fouling Brazilian forward Robinho 14 minutes from time, giving Beckham another set-piece opportunity. 

The Englishmans shot struck the wall on its way into the area but Baptista steered it home from close range. 

In Italy, Serie A leaders Juventus beat title challengers Inter Milan 2-0 to open up a five-point lead at the top of the table and deal Inter a heavy psychological blow. 

First-half goals from David Trezeguet and Pavel Nedved secured victory for the champions in the first major clash between title contenders this season, making it six wins out of six for Fabio Capellos side. 

AC Milan are in second place on 13 points after two first-half goals from captain Paolo Maldini earned them a 2-1 victory over Reggina. 

Fiorentina are level on points with Milan after a 3-2 home victory against fellow Tuscans Livorno, who scored both their goals in the final four minutes. 

AS Roma suffered their second home defeat of the campaign with a 3-2 loss to 10-man Siena. To add to the pain of defeat all the goals from the visitors, including Francesco Colonneses 90th-minute winner, came from former players of capital rivals Lazio. 

Capellos Juventus swept aside Inter with a dominating first-half display that began with a 22nd-minute opener from French forward Trezeguet. 

Zlatan Ibrahimovics well driven free-kick was parried out by Inter keeper Julio Cesar but Trezeguet responded sharply to head in the loose ball.

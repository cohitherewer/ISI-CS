 Spanish league suits my style: Robinho 

Madrid: Brazilian forward Robinho believes he will have few problems adapting to European football when he makes his move from Santos to Real Madrid at the end of the month. 

Ive always dreamed of playing in Europe, and in particular Spain, because the league there suits my style and is the closest to the type of football played in Brazil, the 21-year-old told a Spanish sports daily on Saturday. 

In Spain, they tend to pass the ball around a lot and play in space and that will be perfect for me. 

Robinho signed a five-year contract with Real at the end of last month when Santos finally agreed to accept a $30 million offer from the Spanish giants. 

However, the deal between the two clubs included a clause that allows the slightly built forward to play a handful of league matches with Santos before joining Real on August 25. 

Robinho believes the presence of former Santos boss Vanderlei Luxemburgo at the Spanish club will also help ease his transition to European football. 

Luxemburgo took charge of the nine-time European champions at the end of last year immediately after steering Santos to the Brazilian title. 

Luxemburgo knows me perfectly and I know how he works, he said. I have got a particular style and technique and Luxemburgo has always put me in positions where Im used to playing. We were Brazilian champions together in 2004 and now I hope we can win other trophies together at Real Madrid.

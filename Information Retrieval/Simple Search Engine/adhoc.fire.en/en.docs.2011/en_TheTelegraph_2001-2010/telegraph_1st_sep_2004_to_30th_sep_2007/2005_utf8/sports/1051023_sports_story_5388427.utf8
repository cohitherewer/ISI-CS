 EB looking beyond Churchill test 

 Alvitos injury is not a major worry for East Bengal 

Margao: Churchill Brothers face an uphill task when they take on formidable East Bengal in the second quarter final of the Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. 

East Bengal had won their previous encounter against Air India comfortably. And now, they are certainly looking beyond the next challenge. 

South African Sidney Nkalanga, with his speedy run and skilful play, have impressed along with Mike Okoro and the two foreign recruits of East Bengal can tear any rival defence. 

Alvito DCunha, Syed Rahim Nabi, Dipankar Roy and Debabrata Roy have played their role well in the midfield, creating space for their strikers to punch hole in the rival defence. 

Churchill Brothers, who scored a big win against Tollygunge Agragami, will have to play to their potential. Their midfield ? which looked out of sort in the second half ? will have to give their best if they want to create any impact against East Bengal. 

Churchills attack will be spearheaded by Fredy Mascarenhas who stole the limelight in the last match. 

East Bengal coach Subhash Bhowmick said: All matches are tough. We will not take any team lightly. Churchill Brothers have some good players, but I have confidence in my boys who will deliver the goods. 

About the injuries, he said Alvito DCunha and Debabrata Roy are having minor injuries but that is not the major worry. 

Churchill Brothers coach Peter Rodrigues said the big win has raised the morale of the team who are confident of putting across on Sunday. 

In another match on Sunday, Hindustan Aeronautics Sporting Club (HASC), upbeat after their giant kill of Dempo in the tournament opener, are all geared up to face the challenge of Mahindra United. 

HASC, who do not have any foreigners, played as a unit. Xavier Kumar and Sunil ? who were largely responsible for the victory after their defence played their hearts out to blunt Dempos attack ? would have to play a major role in order to win against a team that has all stars in their rank. 

Mahindra defence gave a good performance against JCT, led by Mahesh Gawali who stood like a rock in the middle. 

The man who can do most of the damage for HASC is star striker Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto, who combined well with Gabriel in the last match, masterminding the attack, playing as a withdrawn forward. 

HASC coach Krishnaji Rao expressed satisfaction over his teams performance in the last match which they won against Dempo. 

My boys played according to the plan. Tomorrow is another tough match and our plan will be different. I know they are the best side with all stars and good foreign recruits like Baretto who can turn the game anytime. I have worked out a plan for him which you will see tomorrow, stated Rao. 

Mahindra coach Derick Pereira said his boys played well against JCT, especially the defence. HASC is a good side who play as a unit and we cannot underestimate them. It will be a good contest, he said. (PTI)

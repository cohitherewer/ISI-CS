Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan have decided to send Dipendu Biswas medical reports to Fifa in order to seek the world bodys views on his fitness after a panel of four doctors at a city hospital on Tuesday declared him fit. 

There is no risk element involved in his taking the field, the doctors ruled. 

Another panel had earlier said that Dipendu should not take the field because of cardiac problems. Owing to that, he also didnt find his place in the Federation Cup squad. 

In the last season, Mahindra United terminated Dipendus services citing the same problems.

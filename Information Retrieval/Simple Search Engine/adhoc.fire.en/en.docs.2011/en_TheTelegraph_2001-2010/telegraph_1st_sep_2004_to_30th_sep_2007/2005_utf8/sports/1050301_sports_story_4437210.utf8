 Leander relishing dual role

 Leander?s job is also to motivate youngsters 

New Delhi: From a 16-year-old rookie playing with the likes of Ramesh Krishnan and Zeeshan Ali to single-handedly leading the Indian challenge in the Davis Cup ties, Leander Paes has come a long way. 

And the Indian team captain is now easing himself into the role of a leader and motivator. 

The 31-year-old has kept the Tri-colour flying across the world in Davis Cup for the last 15 years and now has to shoulder additional responsibility of winning matches and also helping youngsters to perform at the big stage. 

?I have played many different roles in the team. Now my job is also to motivate the youngsters and get the best out of guys like Harsh (Mankad) and Prakash (Amritraj),? said Paes, who is preparing for India?s Davis Cup tie against China beginning Friday. 

?I have thrived on such responsibilities all through my career and I am enjoying it even now. Today my job also includes sharing my experiences with the youngsters and helping them give their best for the country.? 

Paes, who has a record 71 victories to his credit in Davis Cup ? including those against Croat Goran Ivanisevic and Chilean Marcelo Rios ? said as captain his job is just not limited to winning matches, but also to field the best possible team in a given situation. 

On what has kept him going for such a long period, the 31-year-old shot back saying he does not need any motivation to play for the country. 

?I love representing the country. I love to come out and play my best tennis for the country.? The Indian captain said though he could choose only four players for a tie, he was in favour of having a seven or eight-player group training together before the matches as it would give exposure to youngsters. 

?I like to have couple of youngsters in the team so that they get the feel of the environment of the Davis Cup and mature over the years.? 

The team has young Karan Rastogi in the reserves. The Indian think tank has also roped in the services of Vishal Uppal and juniors Vivek Shokeen and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan. 

Team coach Nandan Bal said Paes is a role model for other players. 

?He is a huge role model for others. He was here on Friday practising for the tie. He gives his 100 per cent for the team and that?s what he also conveys to others. 

The Chinese, meanwhile, tried to play down the court disadvantage saying they had the players who could take the game to their opponents. 

?It is true that we do not have much experience of playing on grass. But we have the guys who can raise their game and tackle the fast surfaces,? China?s non-playing captain Zhao Xie said. (PTI)

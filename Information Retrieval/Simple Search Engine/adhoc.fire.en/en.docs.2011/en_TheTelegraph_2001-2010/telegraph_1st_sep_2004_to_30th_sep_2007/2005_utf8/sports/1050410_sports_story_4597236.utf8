Port-of-Spain: Brian Lara made a sensational return to the West Indies team on Friday, scoring an unbeaten 159 on the first day of the second Test against South Africa on his home pitch. 

Lara?s 27th hundred, which put him at the top of the list of West Indies Test centurions, helped the Windies reach 281 for six when bad light ended play three overs early. 

Previously, Lara had jointly held the record with Garfield Sobers who scored 26 centuries for the West Indies. 

By reaching 41 at lunch, the charismatic batsman also leapfrogged Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar into the third place on the all-time list of leading run scorers in Test cricket. 

Lara, who along with six other players was left out of the drawn first Test in Guyana owing to a dispute over sponsorship, came to the crease with West Indies wobbling on 13 for two, after captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul had won the toss and elected to bat on a lively track. 

For South Africa, fast bowler Makhaya Ntini did the early damage, first removing Chris Gayle in the sixth over when the opener top edged a pull shot to ?keeper Mark Boucher, having scored just six. 

He struck again in his next over when he induced an uppish pull shot from Ramnaresh Sarwan, on five, and the ball looped to Andre Nel at fine leg. However, solid batting from opener Wavell Hinds and Lara?s aggression halted the slide. 

?I really enjoyed this innings, and within the first 15 minutes I thought this could be something big,? Lara said at the news conference after play ended on Day I. 

?I love playing for the West Indies, and it doesn?t matter to me who the captain is. Sometimes you can lean on the captaincy, now I?ve got to stay in the team by scoring runs.?

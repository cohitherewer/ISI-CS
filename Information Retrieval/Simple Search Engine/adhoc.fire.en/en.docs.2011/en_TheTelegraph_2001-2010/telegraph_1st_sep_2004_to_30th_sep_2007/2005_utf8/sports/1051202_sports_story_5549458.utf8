 Umpires to stand in for Lloyd

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: In whats bound to be a first ? unless the start of Test No.1 is delayed ? since it became mandatory for the Match Referee to supervise the toss, that role is going to be played by on-field umpires Daryl Harper and Mark Benson. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Clive Lloyd (the designated Match Referee for the three-Test series) will only be landing at around 8.20 am and, so, cant make it to the Chepauk before the 9.00 am toss. 

Details werent available, but the legendary West Indian has been delayed because of a family problem. 

Harper, in fact, conducted the customary pre-series briefing featuring the captains as well as the team and match officials on Thursday evening. The Australian did so after being authorised by the International Cricket Council.

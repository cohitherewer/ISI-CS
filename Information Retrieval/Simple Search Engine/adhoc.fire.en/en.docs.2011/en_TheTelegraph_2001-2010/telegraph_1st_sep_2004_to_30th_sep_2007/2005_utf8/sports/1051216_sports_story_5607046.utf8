The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Still fast, not furious

 - Critics are my best friends... They keep me going, says Shoaib Akhtar 

RICHARD HOBSON in Karachi

Half an hour in the company of Shoaib Akhtar must be like facing one of his overs ? a mass of contrast and contradiction. A batsman can expect the fast ball, the slow ball, the yorker and the bouncer, with a bit of seam and swing in the mix. An interviewer hears bravado and humility, hope and regret, respect and disdain. 

Life around Shoaib is never dull. He is a showman. On Thursday, his stage was the National Stadium, where England and Pakistan contested the third game of their five-match one-day series. His audience on Wednesday was a group of reporters who sat on one of two double beds in his hotel room. Shoaib, cross-legged, held court from the other. 

He has every reason to feel content after re-launching a career that had stalled in the first ten months this year. Missed series in India and the West Indies and a supine performance in the ICC Super Series spoke of a player who was drained. Worse, of a man who was not prepared to sweat himself back to his former lustre. 

Now the Rawalpindi Express is gleaming again and his biggest thanks go not only to the Pakistan management, who offered a last chance to galvanise his talent, but to the critics who unwittingly gave him the incentive to take it. England will be less than amused to discover the part played by Andrew Flintoff in his recovery. 

We were playing for the World XI in Australia, Shoaib said. Flintoff said to me, You look like Tarzan, but you cant bowl. He meant it as a joke, but I realised that something needed to be done. My critics are my best friends, they keep me going. 

The response was emphatic ? 17 wickets in the Test series against England followed by a brilliant display of sustained hostility this week in the second one-day game in Lahore. 

I wanted 25 wickets in the Tests, Shoaib said. I should have got them, but I cant complain. Maybe the security and culture put off England. The score is in the record books ? 2-0. 

He described the England players as lovely people. These include Kevin Pietersen, christened chicken man by Bob Woolmer, the Pakistan coach. Pietersen is fine, Shoaib said. The other day he missed one and I asked what sort of batsman he was when he couldnt even hit the ball on a flat track. 

Another critic was John Elliott, the Worcestershire chairman, who said that Shoaib was no use to any team. 

He said that anybody questioning his commitment should look at his most recent 18 Tests. It is a curious figure to pluck, but the statistics show that Shoaib is self-aware. During this period he has taken 92 wickets at an average of 20.95. Overall, he has 161 wickets at 24.76. Analysis, however, confirms another thought. 

Shoaib has taken a little more than three years to play those 18 games. Eight years on from his Test debut, he has featured in only 39 out of 74 matches overall. Those figures can be attributed to inconsistency, which does not stem entirely from injury. He will need a long run in the team to reach his target of 300 wickets. 

He cites questions over his action as a significant reason for dips in form around the turn of the decade. 

The first time I was called a chucker I thought of packing in the game, he said. That period should have been the peak of my career. Dennis Lillee took one look at my elbow and said, You dont need a bowling coach, you need a doctor. 

His delivery finally cleared, Shoaib became the first bowler to be recorded at 100mph. 

I was sick of all the talk, he said. I was the fastest man in the world, but I said to Brett Lee, Heres the crown, please take it away. At the 2003 World Cup, I wanted to bowl that ball to get it out of the way. I predicted the very ball. 

At 30, Shoaib says he is a calmer personality and is even talking about marriage. 

I have had a rough ten years, he said. In the next five I think I want to be a normal person.

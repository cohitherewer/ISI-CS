 Rooney guides United past City

 Wayne Rooney after scoring United?s first goal against City on Sunday 

Manchester: Wayne Rooney was Manchester United?s inspiration as they won 2-0 at local rivals Manchester City on Sunday to keep alive their faint title hopes. 

The 19-year-old England striker scored the first goal with a shot that flew in off City defender Richard Dunne after 68 minutes and provided a cross that the luckless Dunne miscued into his own net seven minutes on to settle the match. 

United?s win meant they cut the advantage of runaway leaders Chelsea to nine points with 11 games of the season left. Chelsea won 1-0 at fourth-placed Everton on Saturday to remain on course for their first English title in 50 years. 

Jose Mourinho?s team have 68 points, United have 59 and third-placed champions Arsenal, who host Crystal Palace on Monday, have 54 from a game less. 

Mid-table City are the only team to beat Chelsea in the league this season and they won the equivalent fixture against old foes United 4-1 last term and 3-1 the season before. 

Kevin Keegan?s side squandered the clearest chance of the opening 45 minutes when Steve McManaman side-footed wide from close range after some dazzling wing play by Shaun Wright-Phillips.

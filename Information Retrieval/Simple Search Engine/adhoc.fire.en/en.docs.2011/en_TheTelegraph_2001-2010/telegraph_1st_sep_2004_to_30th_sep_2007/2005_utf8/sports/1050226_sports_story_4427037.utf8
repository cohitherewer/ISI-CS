 Annabee fancied 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Annabee and Corvino, both from trainer Vijay Singh?s yard, are capable of winning the 1,600m H.H. Maharaja Jagaddipendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur of Cooch Behar Memorial Cup, the main event in Saturday?s eight-event card.

 From horse to horse, Corvino is a good miler but Annabee, has matched strides with superior horses. The Steinbeck-Annaberg filly is, however, a lazy mover and his jockey, C. Alford, may need to work hard on him right from the word ?go.?

Alford may need to be equally alert on Alarico in 

the 1,400m Supernova Cup. Also, a late finisher, the Steinbeck progeny may find 

a smart galloper in A?Ma Jaju if Alford decides to give a long lead to the Farle 

Rodrigues-trainee.

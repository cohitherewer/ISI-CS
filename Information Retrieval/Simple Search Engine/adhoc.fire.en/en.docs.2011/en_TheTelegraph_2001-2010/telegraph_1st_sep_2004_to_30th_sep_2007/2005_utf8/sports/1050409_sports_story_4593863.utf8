 Orissa, Railways in quarters

 - NATIONAL ONE-DAYERS 

 S.S. Das hit 82 off 66 balls 

Mumbai: Orissa shocked Karnataka by six wickets in a high-scoring match to earn a quarter final meeting with holders Mumbai in the inter state one-day All India Knockout tournament at the Brabourne Stadium on Friday. 

Put into bat, Karnataka made a flying start and when they seemed all set to cross the 300-mark, Orissa applied the skids restricting their rivals to 284 for nine in 50 overs. 

Orissa raced towards the target with an opening stand of 83 in only 51 balls between BBCC Mahapatra, who cracked 50 in only 26 balls with the help of 4 sixes and 5 fours, and Shiv Sundar Das (82 retired off 66 balls). 

Earlier, Rowland scored a fine 104 in 123 balls with eight fours and put on 153 runs in 150 balls for the second wicket with Sujith Somasundar, who smashed 77. 

The quarter final match between Orissa and Mumbai will be played Saturday. 

In another match at the Wankhede, Jai Prakash Yadav?s allround show helped Railways down Delhi by five wickets with nearly 10 overs to spare and to enter the last eight stage.

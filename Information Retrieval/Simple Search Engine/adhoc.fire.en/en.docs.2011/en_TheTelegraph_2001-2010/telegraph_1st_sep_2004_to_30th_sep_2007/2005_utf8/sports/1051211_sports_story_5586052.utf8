Bangkok: Shiv Kapur and Jyoti Randhawa, playing together for the first time, fed off each other and produced scintillating golf on the back nine to have a share in the three-way lead at 15-under 201 at the end of the third round of the $600,000 Masters of Asia. 

Defending champion Randhawa and challenger Kapur missed a few close putts on the front nine and came out with just a par 36, but no sooner had the back nine begun, they were firing on all cylinders. 

Randhawa, in fact, could have gone into sole lead, but for a birdie miss from eight feet on the 18th. Randhawa went ahead of Kapur just once, when he birdied the tenth and 11th to go 12-under, one ahead of his teammate. 

A little before the Indian duo trooped in, Marcus Both shot a six-under 66 to come to 15-under, a score Randhawa and Kapur equalled. Way behind at fourth place was Chawalit Plaphol at 10-under 206 with a third round of 67, that included two eagles in the first four holes. 

Among other Indians, Gaurav Ghei (74) was one-under for three days at tied 28th place, while Jeev Milkha Singh (71) and Harmeet Kahlon (75) were tied for 49th at eight-over. 

At that second hole, I three-putted from eight feet, because I was thinking abut the lead, admitted Randhawa.

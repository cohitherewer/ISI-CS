 New Delhi: Anju Bobby George?s gold medal winning leap at the Asian Athletics Championship in Incheon, Korea, saw her inching up to the seventh spot in latest women?s long jump rankings of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).

 Anju, who struck gold with a jump of 6.65m at the championship on Sunday, climbed up two spots in rankings released by the IAAF on Monday. She has also booked her berth at the world athletics finals in Monaco on September 9-10.

 In the latest rankings, the Russian trio of Tatiana Kotova, Irina Simagina and Tatyana Lebedeva hold on to the first three spots. Helsinki gold medallist Tiana Madison of the US and her compatriot Grace Upshaw occupy the next two places.

 Mumbai: Five Olympians, including former India captains Dhanraj Pillay and Somaya Maneypande, have questioned the working of the Bombay Hockey Association in a notice to the registrar of companies.

 Olympians Dhanraj, Somaya, Merwyn Fernandes, Iqbaljit Singh and Joaquim Carvalho and other former internationals have charged BHA president Dilbagh Singh Baxi and secretary Kehar Singh of ?conducting the affairs of the company in total contravention of companies act?.

 Crans-Sur-Sierre: Sergio Garcia fired a three-under-par 68 to win the European Masters by a shot on Sunday, the sixth European Tour victory of his career.

 The 25-year-old Spaniard, one stroke clear overnight, chipped in for birdie at the par-three 16th after a mid-round stumble to forge ahead of the chasing pack before finishing at 14-under 270.

 Sweden?s Peter Gustafsson secured second place with an equal best-of-the-week 64 with British Ryder Cup player Paul Casey a further shot back in third after a 66.

 Defending champion Luke Donald, also of Britain, returned a 69 to tie for fourth at 11 under with compatriot Garry Houston, who carded a 70. 

 Moscow: Former French Open champion Anastasia Myskina will lead holders Russia in the Fed Cup final against France, Russia captain Shamil Tarpishchev said on Monday.

 He also named Elena Dementieva, last year?s losing finalist at Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows, Dinara Safina and Vera Douchevina for the September 17-18 encounter on clay in Paris. Tarpishchev kept faith in the same team which beat the United States 4-1 in the semi-finals in Moscow in July.

 Glasgow: Former Scotland midfielder Archie Gemmill has claimed four teammates took banned substances at the 1978 World Cup finals in Argentina.

 Winger Willie Johnston, then with West Bromwich Albion, was sent home after testing positive for an energy boosting stimulant. Johnston said it was to combat hay fever.

 Now Gemmill, in his autobiography Both Sides of the Border, claims three other players also took pep pills.

 He said: ?I saw the guys openly taking them in the changing rooms.Gemmill refused to name the players.

 Kenny Dalglish, who shared a room with Gemmill in Argentina, said in a Scottish daily: ?He would have to substantiate that. It?s the first I have heard of this. I certainly don?t know of anybody taking that stuff.?

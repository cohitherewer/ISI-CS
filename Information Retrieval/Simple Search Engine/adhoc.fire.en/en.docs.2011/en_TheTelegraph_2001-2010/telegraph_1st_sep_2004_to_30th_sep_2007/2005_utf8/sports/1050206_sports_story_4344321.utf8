The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tolly face SBT today

Kozhikode: An intense battle is on the cards when home team State Bank of Travancore take on a resurgent Tollygunge Agragami in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup on Sunday. 

Tollygunge start favourites following their convincing win over Fransa Pax which took them to the third spot with eight points. SBT, however, would look to improve upon their performance following a defeat against East Bengal. 

The Bankmen would try to find success by resorting to an attacking game after their weak defence caused them worry in the previous match. 

SBT?s attack also seemed to be more concentrated on the centre, leaving the left and right wings untouched after their gameplan of blocking star player Bhaichung Bhutia really helped others players, Climax Lawrence and Chandan Das, to go on a rampage. 

With their main striker, Ashif Saheer forced to sit out for the next two matches following a red card on Tuesday, the Kerala outfit should be planning several new things. 

The only disadvantage for Tollygunge, finding a new hero in Dinesh Swar, who scored both the goals in its 2-1 win against Fransa, would be that it would not be playing on home turf. However, with a powerful forward line in Nigerian Akeem Abolanle and Swar and an experienced custodian in Arindam Ghosh, the Calcutta team can hope to maintain its upswing. (PTI)

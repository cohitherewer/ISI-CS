The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 2 outstation players needed: Utpal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Veteran Utpal Chatterjee has called for two outstation player berths per senior division club for all local tournaments of the CAB. 

I feel that there is no harm in bringing good quality outstation players in all the local cricket meets. This will actually raise the standard of our boys, Chatterjee said after the P. Sen Trophy final on Sunday. 

According to the left-arm spinner, Bengals standard has been on the downhill for the last few years. If the CAB allows the clubs to keep at least two berths open for outstation players, it will surely have a positive effect in the years to come, he said. 

Chatterjee, who broke retirement to save Bengal from being relegated to the plate division of the Ranji Trophy, believes Bengal cricket is not following the right track at the moment. Its a shame that Sourav (Ganguly) and I had to play for Bengal against Madhya Pradesh to save face. 

He also doesnt support the idea of the Ambar Roy sub-junior cricket tournament to be held under these hot and humid conditions. Its not scientific to make the kids play under these conditions.

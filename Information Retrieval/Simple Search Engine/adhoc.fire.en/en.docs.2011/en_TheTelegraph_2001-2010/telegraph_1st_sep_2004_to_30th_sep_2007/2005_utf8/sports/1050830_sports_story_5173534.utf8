 England are now in home stretch

 Trent Bridge: This was 

 a fantastic win. However harrowing the last few balls, England 

 are now on the homeward stretch. In racing terms, we have 

 got our noses in front. And there is no doubt we are playing 

 the better cricket.

 Small targets are always difficult 

 in Test match cricket. The eight and seven runs that Matthew 

 Hoggard and Ashley Giles scored will be the best few runs 

 they ever make. They showed better composure than some of 

 the more experienced and better batsmen. 

 Ian Bells shot was unbelievable. 

 He doesnt normally hook but it was pressure that got 

 him out. Kevin Pietersen was the same. Shane Warne was the 

 one who could win the match for Australia, so it was important 

 to keep him out and score sensible runs off the seamers. 

 There were plenty of overs and 

 plenty of time to get to the total but intense pressure 

 and superb bowling by Warne and Brett Lee brought out the 

 mistakes. 

 England needed strength of character 

 and mental toughness. Giles provided it. He went in knowing 

 that Warne had got him out four times in this series. Giles 

 had only scored eight runs off him in total, so it was a 

 tremendous performance under pressure. 

 But in the end it doesnt 

 matter how many mistakes we made, the vital thing is that 

 we got over the line. It doesnt matter how many you 

 win by, just that you win.

 Another reason England made such 

 hard work of it was that they lost Simon Joness bowling 

 on the third evening and all day Sunday. 

 He has produced the biggest improvement 

 out of all the bowlers in this series. That is amazing because 

 when you think back to the South African tour last winter, 

 he was an afterthought. 

 Michael Vaughan usually threw 

 the ball to him after everyone else had had a go, somewhere 

 around the 50th or 60th over.

 Jones has made such strides that 

 when the first innings finished and Australia followed on, 

 Vaughan gave him the new ball. He is bowling so well, swinging 

 the old and new ball more than he ever has done, keeping 

 a more consistent line on off stump, and giving the batsmen 

 fewer and fewer free leg-side balls to hit. So England now 

 have the conviction to leave him on.

 The other reason why England have 

 struggled is the wicketkeeper, Geraint Jones. His mistakes 

 cost 47 runs in Australias second innings. He missed 

 a stumping off Michael Clarke on Saturday night, then two 

 chances from Brett Lee early in his innings.

 But for that, England would have 

 cantered home comfortably. Joness keeping means the 

 bowlers have to strive much harder. Instead of having to 

 take 10 wickets in an innings they have to take 14 or 15. 

 Jones could have atoned for his 

 mistakes with the bat. He came in with 18 needed and should 

 have shepherded England across the line, but instead he 

 played an absolutely stupid shot. That could have lost England 

 the Ashes for another few years. 

 Thankfully his teammates bailed 

 him out. Everyone makes mistakes but Jones makes too many. 

 The problem is, I dont know who you would stick in 

 his place. But if he doesnt improve sooner rather 

 than later, his errors will cost a Test match.

 There is one change I would make 

 to the England side. I would put Pietersen up to No. 4. 

 I feel that if he gets in, he is such a dominant player 

 in a way that Bell isnt at the moment.

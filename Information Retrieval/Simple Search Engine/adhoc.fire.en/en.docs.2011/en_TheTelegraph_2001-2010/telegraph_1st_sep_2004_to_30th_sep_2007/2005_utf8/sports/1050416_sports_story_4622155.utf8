 Dravid: We succumbed to Afridi

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mohammed Kaif in Kanpur on Friday 

Kanpur: India?s stand-in captain Rahul Dravid admitted on Friday that the team needs ?new strategy? to curb the Pakistani mission to take the one-day International series back home. 

?We had the early momentum. But Pakistan came back strongly and played better than us in the last three matches. Now we?ve to look for a new strategy to contain them,? Dravid told a press conference after losing the fifth ODI. 

?We have to get our act together ? especially in the bowling department ? in the first 15 overs. We need to work on it and hope that New Delhi will be a different story,? he added. 

He, however, gave full credit to Shahid Afridi. 

?We lost to just one man... We tried all options possible to contain Afridi. We even got him out off a no-ball (when the Pakistani opener was on 75). It was his day and we succumbed to his innings,? Dravid remarked. 

The stand-in captain also defended his decision to bat first, stressing that the pitch had assisted the slow bowlers towards the end. 

?We knew 250 was a very good score. If you take away Afridi?s innings from the Pakistan total, we would have been in a very good position to win the match,? he said. 

His Pakistani counterpart Inzamam-ul Haq, meanwhile, attributed the team?s resurgence after a 0-2 deficit to self-belief and teamwork. 

?It was difficult to come back after going 0-2 down. But we kept our self-belief intact and everybody responded to the challenge,? Inzamam felt. 

?The game has changed now. Earlier, 240-250 was believed to be a winning score. But now even 290-plus doesn?t look safe. Reliance on individual brilliance has gone and you have to develop total teamwork to win matches. We?re collectively performing now and the result is here,? he observed. 

On whether Sourav Ganguly?s absence affected India in Kanpur, Inzamam said it was to some extent, but hastened to add: ?Rahul did an extremely good job. He batted well, threw us a 250-run target, which was not easy to reach. It?s another fact, though, that Shahid turned it into a one-sided match.?

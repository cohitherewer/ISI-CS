 Syed Nayeemuddin gets AIFF nod

 - Appointment till Doha Asian Games, review after SAFF Cup 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) chose Syed Nayeemuddin as the coach of the senior national team on Sunday following an experts panel recommendation, but the appointment came with a rider. 

Nayeemuddin will take over as the senior national coach from Sukhwinder Singh, whose contract wont be renewed, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said here on Sunday. 

However, Nayeems appointment is till the 2006 Asian Games in Goa, and his performance will be reviewed within 48 hours of the conclusion of SAFF Cup in December this year, for which we have set a stiff target, Das Munshi added. 

The AIFF president said that former Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharyas name was considered seriously by the selection panel, but the Hyderabadis past performance in 1988 Asian games and recent success in Bangladesh tipped the balance in his favour. 

On the removal of incumbent coach Sukhwinder, Das Munshi said, He had done quite well and I wouldnt like to undermine his contribution? But the recent debacles in Fiji and Pakistan has left me with a rude shock, he informed, adding fitness and conditioning was not in order. 

Apart from Nayeem, Atanu Bhattacharya has been appointed as goalkeeper coach, Das Munshi informed. 

Regarding the appointment of a technical director, the AIFF supremo said, We have received at least 18 applications from places like Germany, Russia, Nigeria and Ukraine. A decision will be taken soon. 

Claiming that at least one or two top teams will be invited for the Nehru Cup, which will revived next year, Das Munshi said, Before the Asian Games, we will send the senior team to at least three exposure trips to gather foreign experience. 

Sukhwinder upset 

PTI adds from New Delhi: After being replaced by Syed Nayeemuddin as the national football coach, Sukhwinder Singh said the manner in which he was sacked left him upset and disappointed. 

Any person who does his job with honesty and sincerity would feel upset with the drama that took place in Delhi during selection interviews, Sukhwinder said over the phone on Sunday.

 Milan rally to beat Udinese

Rome: Italian champions AC Milan kept the pressure on Serie A leaders Juventus when they came from behind to beat third-placed Udinese 3-1 at the San Siro Stadium on Sunday. 

The result gave Milan 42 points from 19 games, one behind Juventus who play away at Cagliari in a later match. 

Lazio suffered their first defeat under recently appointed coach Giuseppe Papadopulo when they lost 3-1 at home to Palermo, who moved up to fifth in the division on 28 points. 

Palermo?s victory was bad news for Roma, who are also chasing a European place. They had to rely on a brace by leading Serie A scorer Vincenzo Montella to claw back a two-goal deficit in a 2-2 draw with lowly Chievo Verona. 

Even with home advantage and the return of Dutch defender Jaap Stam from injury, Milan expected a scrap against Udinese, who were the only team to beat them at the San Siro last season. 

Another upset seemed on the cards as early as the ninth minute when Antonio Di Natale unleashed a long-range shot that flew into the top corner of Dida?s goal. 

By the half-hour mark Udinese looked to have established control of the match but a defence-splitting pass by Brazilian midfielder Kaka allowed European Footballer of the Year Andriy Shevchenko to stab in a surprise equaliser. 

Milan looked more composed after the break. But they had Udinese midfielder Marek Jankulovski to thank for their 53rd-minute lead. His attempt at a headed clearance ended up in his own net. 

Milan began to dominate and striker Jon Dahl Tomasson had already missed a sitter before Kaka dribbled through the defence to add a third a minute before the end. 

Meanwhile, Lazio?s hopes of notching up their third Serie A win in a row were sunk by Palermo striker Luca Toni who scored twice in their 3-1 win. (Reuters)

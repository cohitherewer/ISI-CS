 Rain plays spoilsport

Centurion: Rain washed out the first day?s play in the fifth Test between South Africa and England here on Friday. 

England lead the series 2-1. 

Play would start 30 minutes earlier on Saturday. 

South Africa made a last minute change in their line-up, dropping middleorder batsman Boeta Dippenaar in favour of allrounder Andrew Hall. 

England made just one change to the team that won the fourth Test ? Simon Jones came in for James Anderson. 

Andrew Flintoff, who was in doubt for the match with a foot problem, and Steve Harmison, who was recovering from a calf-muscle injury, were declared fit to play. (AP)

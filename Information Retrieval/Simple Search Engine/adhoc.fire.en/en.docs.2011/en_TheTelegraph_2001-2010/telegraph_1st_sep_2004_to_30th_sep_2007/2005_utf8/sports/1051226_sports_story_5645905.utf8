The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vieiras departure cost us dear, 

 says Gilberto

 MATT HUGHES 

 Vieira was a fantastic 

 leader, says Gilberto 

 After falling 20 points behind 

 Chelsea last Sunday, Ars?ne Wenger conceded the Premier 

 League title, but Gilberto Silva believes all hope was lost 

 the moment Patrick Vieira left the club last summer. All 

 he wants for Christmas is to turn back time.

 Wenger continues to insist that 

 he was right to sell Vieira to Juventus, but players tell 

 a different story. Deprived of their captain colossus, Arsenal 

 have looked a shadow of their former selves, collapsing 

 to defeats where previously they powered to victory, particularly 

 away from home, where they have collected five points all 

 season.

 Gilberto has felt his loss more 

 than most. With Francesc F?bregas and Mathieu Flamini alongside 

 him, the 29-year-old is the one senior player in the centre 

 of midfield and admits that he initially viewed Vieiras 

 departure as a bad dream.

 We struggled a bit at the 

 beginning of the season and Patricks departure had 

 a big impact on us, Gilberto said. I think we 

 worried a bit too much about his departure and when we woke 

 up we had lost some games and it was very difficult for 

 us to win the league.

 I think it caused a big 

 impact because no one expected him to leave. We didnt 

 realise he had definitely gone and then carried on without 

 him. Patrick was a fantastic leader for us and when he left, 

 it was difficult for us to accept his decision.

 Of course we respected that, 

 but it was very difficult when we came to the training ground 

 and Patrick was not here. It was different, as we had been 

 together for three years. But certain things happen in football 

 that you have to accept. Its life. We need to carry 

 on and play without him and support the young players and 

 be together all the time.

 Wenger has shown considerable 

 faith in the clubs talented youngsters, though Gilberto 

 fears many of them lack sufficient belief in themselves. 

 Arsenal are enduring their worst league run under the Frenchman, 

 suffering three successive defeats for the first time in 

 his stewardship, and Gilberto believes that their problems 

 are psychological.

 Even the night after sparing his 

 sides blushes against Doncaster Rovers in the Carling 

 Cup, Gilberto seemed down, reflecting the discontent at 

 the club.

 We need to believe in ourselves, 

 he said. Its quite frustrating for us because 

 in a couple of games it doesnt work like we train. 

 When it doesnt come its more psychological than 

 technical. 

 Everyone knows it is not 

 our best moment. Since Ive been here weve never 

 had results like this, three consecutive defeats in a short 

 period of time. It gets you a little bit down. You need 

 to do something more to what you normally do. To talk with 

 the players on the pitch or outside.

 When you have results like 

 we have, you feel a little bit down and then you see the 

 other team in front of you. It is difficult to find the 

 problem.

 Wenger appears reluctant to search 

 for solutions in the transfer market, but Gilberto is adamant 

 that the squad needs to be strengthened during the January 

 transfer window. Having watched his teammates overpowered 

 by Michael Essien and Claude Makelele last Sunday, he believes 

 that Arsenals midfield is in most need of reinforcing.

 I think you need a really 

 strong squad. Its not the 11 players but the squad 

 needs to be strong, Gilberto said.

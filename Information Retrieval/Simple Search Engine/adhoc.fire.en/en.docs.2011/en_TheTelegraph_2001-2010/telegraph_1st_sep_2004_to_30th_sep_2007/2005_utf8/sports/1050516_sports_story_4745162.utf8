 Woolmer: Windies can still stretch us 

 - It is just a matter of adjusting slightly to the pitches 

St. Johns: Though West Indies are trailing 0-4 to South Africa in their five-match ODI series having lost the Test series 0-2, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer wasnt about to believe his side will also have an easy tour of the Caribbean. 

Pakistan play West Indies in the first one-dayer on Wednesday. 

I think they are playing a strong South African team. But I think they are rebuilding and will be a tough opposition, Woolmer told the West Indies Cricket Board web-site on Saturday. 

They (South Africa) have a different side to us. They rely very much on their pace attack. We have a very good spin attack. It is not to say we havent got a good seam attack. We have a very good seam attack as well. 

We dont have the super pace but we have players who bowl up there ? 145 (kph), 148, so they are not slow. We have some exciting young batsmen. And so we are really looking forward to the tour. 

It is important for us to hit the road running, in this series because it is so short. Fortunately, all the players have been playing a lot of cricket, he said. It is just a matter of adjusting slightly to the pitches. I think they are going to be the same. 

Woolmer also believed Brian Lara may affect the results. 

Hes a world-class player so if he plays spin well someone will have to try and get him out, the coach said. 

But we have noticed some very good performances from the other players. We dont underestimate the West Indies side at all. (AP)

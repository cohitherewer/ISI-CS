 Pires fine goes into aid fund

 Paris: France midfielder Robert Pires has 

 been fined 50,000 euros ($65,520) for infringing national 

 team sponsorship rules and agreed to pay the money into 

 a tsunami aid fund, the French Football Federation (FFF) 

 said on Friday. 

?Pires has been punished for not respecting the contract with the national team?s sponsor Adidas. He will have to pay a fine of 50,000 euros,? FFF vice-chairman Gerard Enault said. 

?In agreement with Robert Pires, the money will go to an aid group set up by the French ministry of sports to help the countries hit by the Asian tsunami,? Enault told reporters at the end of a FFF council meeting. Pires did not attend the FFF council meeting. 

The Arsenal player was summoned by the FFF on November 18 to explain why he appeared in a sweater with a rival logo during a television show on October 10 when he was with the national team. 

?I told them I was sorry and apologised,? he said after the hearing. ?I can understand they (Adidas) were upset and I won?t do it again.? 

 NZ matches get govt hacking

 Wellington: New Zealand?s cricket series against 

 a Rest of the World side later this month will receive government 

 support as a fundraiser for Sri Lankan tsunami victims, 

 foreign minister Phil Goff said on Friday. 

Goff said the government would pay NZ $20 New Zealand ($14) for every run scored, NZ $1,000 ($695) for every four hit and NZ $5,000 ($3,475) for every six struck in the three-match limited-overs series. All proceeds will assist Sri Lankan victims of the December 26 disaster. 

The three matches on January 22, 24 and 26 replace a scheduled one-day series between New Zealand and Sri Lanka, abandoned when the Sri Lankan team returned home to join relief efforts.

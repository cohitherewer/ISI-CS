The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hard work paying off for Vaas 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Chennai: Chaminda Vaas remains the unsung hero in the Sri Lankan side. He has not got the recognition he deserves, but the pacer solely concentrates on performing to the best of his abilities. 

A dismal showing in the one-day series against India only made him more determined as he had gone back to the drawing board and worked on his shortcomings. The rewards are just beginning to show. 

His superb spell (21-14-20-4) on the fourth and fifth days helped the visitors restrict India to 167 in this opening Test. The MoM was almost unplayable on Tuesday as his first ten overs were maidens on-the-trot. 

I was carrying a few bad habits in my action during the one-day series and just got back and worked on them. This is a reward for my hard work, Vaas told The Telegraph. 

I am grateful to Tom Moody and T.A. Sekar of the MRF Pace Foundation here. They helped me correct the flaws in my follow through and front arm movement. The run-up also needed some attention. 

Only two short of 300 wickets after 89 Test matches, Vaas is looking forward to the landmark. I would have been happier if I could complete my 300 wickets here. It would have been great? I am also looking forward to playing 100 Test matches. 

Vaas felt Rahul Dravids wicket gave him the most satisfaction. The ball reverse swung and Rahul could not read that. The nick was well held by Sangakkara. 

I was concentrating on the basics. The ball was keeping low on this wicket and I knew a good consistent line would help me reap the rewards. I was solely aiming for that and the other things just fell into place. 

If we can continue with this sort of performance in the remaining two matches, we will be able to put the Indians under tough challenge, the Sri Lankan felt. 

While captain Maravan Atapattu described Vaas spell as exceptional, Moody said: Im happy that he managed to come up with such a good show. I hope he continues in the same vein.

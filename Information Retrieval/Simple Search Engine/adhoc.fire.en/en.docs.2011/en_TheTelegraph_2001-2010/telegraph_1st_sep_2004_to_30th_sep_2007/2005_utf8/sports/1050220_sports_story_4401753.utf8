London: Second division Sheffield United scored a last-minute penalty to earn a 1-1 draw at ten-man Arsenal in a scrappy FA Cup fifth-round tie on Saturday. 

Arsenal, third in the Premier League, looked to have overcome the first-half sending-off of Dennis Bergkamp when substitute Robert Pires struck from close range 12 minutes from time. 

Sheffield kept pushing forward, however, and won a penalty when Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos handled the ball in the area and Andy Gray calmly converted the spot-kick to earn his side a replay. 

Arsenal were reduced to ten men after 35 minutes when Bergkamp, captain for the day in the absence of the rested Patrick Vieira, was controversially sent off for pushing an opponent in the chest during a confrontation between players of both sides. 

Sheffield?s Danny Cullip headed the ball into the net from eight metres just before halftime but the effort was harshly disallowed for pushing. 

Arsenal forward Jose Antonio Reyes twice went close with long-range strikes before midfielder Mathieu Flamini?s firm shot was pushed away by United goalkeeper Paddy Kenny and Pires forced the ball home from six metres. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fresh threat 

for BTTA

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The fate of the city hosting the Asia Cup table tennis championship, scheduled to be held in September, is hanging in the balance. And once again the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) and Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA) are at loggerheads over the issue. 

The TFFI top brass ? in its executive committee meeting, held in New Delhi on Friday ? decided to set the state body on conditions to be the hosts of the tournament and at the same time, keep Bangalore ready as an alternative venue. 

The national federations No. 1 objection to the BTTA being the hosts revolves round the demand that the latter withdraw the case, challenging the TTFIs constitution amended in 1988. 

The BTTA runs on its own constitution of 2002, which eventually led TFFI to disaffiliate the state association on grounds of indiscipline and setting up a parallel body ? West Bengal Table Tennis Association. Paradoxically, both associations host state meets on their own. 

Since the BTTA has been disaffiliated, they dont have the legitimacy of being the ho-sts. But weve given them the deadline of July 31 to withdraw their case. If they fail to do so, the Asia Cup will not be held in Calcutta, Mool Chand Chouhan, the TTFI president, told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

He further informed that Bangalore will be alternative venue for the meet. 

The BTTA secretary Ash-ish Dutta, however, hoped everything will be settled in due time. Were ready to wit-hdraw the case and that will be done in meeting the deadline set by federation, he said.

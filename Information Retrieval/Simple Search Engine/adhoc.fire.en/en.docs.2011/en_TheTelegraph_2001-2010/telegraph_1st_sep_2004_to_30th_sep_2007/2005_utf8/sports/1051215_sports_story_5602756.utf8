 A hard-earned win: Dravid

New Delhi: The huge margin notwithstanding, Rahul Dravid felt it wasnt an easy win at the Kotla. It was a hard-earned win, said Dravid. 

We had to work hard because this was not a pitch where you put a good total and expected it to turn and help the bowlers. 

 There were, however, words of caution from the captain. True, a win always gives you a good feeling and it has given us confidence before the third Test (in Ahmedabad). It was a good team effort. The boys stood up to be counted. Sachin (Tendulkar) was fantastic and then Anil brought us back on the second day. Then Irfan Pathan batted well too. 

On his love affair with the Kotla, MoM Kumble said: Its just a coincidence that I do well here. 

The leg-spinner added that he enjoyed good memories of the Kotla, but the pitch behaved differently this time around. This was not the typical Kotla pitch. There was not much spin. 

What then is the secret behind his success here? At the end of the day you have to create doubt in batsmens mind, no matter whether you are a spinner or fast bowler... We had a good total on the board and it made our task a bit easier, said Kumble. 

Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody felt it was 45 minutes of madness that did his team in. Sri Lanka lost four wickets for just 19 runs in the last hour of Day II,. 

Maravan Atapattu echoed the same thoughts when he said: Yes, we were doing well till tea on Day II but lost grip from there on. We now need to lift our game in Ahmedabad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid gesture moved Sehwag

 - Number of calls from hospital 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Ahmedabad: Virender Sehwag received the best congratulatory message, after being informed Saturday evening that he would lead in the third Test, from Rahul Dravid. The Team India captain called up the stand-in captain from his hospital bed to convey his best wishes. 

Dravid has been in hospital since late Friday evening with a bout of diarrhoea. 

 Dravid called me up a few times and conveyed his best wishes. He enquired about the team and had words of encouragement. Its unfortunate that he is not able to play this game. The team is missing him, Sehwag told The Telegraph at the end of the opening day. 

Sehwag was obviously very moved by this gesture. He asked me to concentrate on the game and not worry about his condition. He said he would be fine in a few days. 

Sehwag was all praise for the V. V. S. Laxman-Mahendra Singh Dhoni stand. Unfortunately we lost a couple of wickets early. But Laxman and Dhoni were brilliant in their efforts. With Laxman and Pathan still around, we should be able to carry on the good work tomorrow (Monday), Sehwag hoped. 

Meanwhile, Dravids condition has shown signs of improvement. Board president Sharad Pawar also visited him before taking an afternoon flight en route to New Delhi. 

Dravid is improving. He had semi-solid food today (Sunday), and if he manages to withstand solid food tomorrow, he might be released from the hospital, media manager Wg Cdr M. Baladitya said.

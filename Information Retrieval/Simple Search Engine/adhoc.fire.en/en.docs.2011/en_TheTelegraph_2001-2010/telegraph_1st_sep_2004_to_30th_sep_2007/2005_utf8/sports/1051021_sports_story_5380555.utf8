 Vaughan heads bumper Ashes Christmas

 Andrew Baker 

Englands cricketers were not the only people celebrating at the close of the fifth day of this summers final Test match. While the players celebrated victory in the Ashes series in the gathering dusk at The Oval, the nations book publishers were rubbing their collective palms and looking forward to a bumper Christmas. 

Sure enough, bookshop shelves are starting to groan under the weight of Ashes-related material. Pictorial records were first, followed by newspaper compilations, and now the players are starting to issue their own versions of events. Before long there will be Drink Yourself Slim: The Freddie Flintoff Diet and Hair dos and Hair donts, Coiffure the Pietersen Way. 

While awaiting those and similar volumes, we must make do with the thoughts of a less charismatic, though equally important, member of Englands triumphant team, a man with a fair claim to being the forgotten figure of the Ashes summer ? captain Michael Vaughan. 

Think back over those five fascinating matches, and which figures leap first to mind? Flintoff and Pietersen, without doubt. Simon Jones, Steve Harmison, the doughty Matthew Hoggard, the maligned but ultimately defiant Ashley Giles, the elegant Andrew Strauss... but the mind, the soul, the manipulator who drew all these talents together with others and ensured that the combination worked to the maximum possible efficiency was Vaughan, who in retrospect, dwindles into the background. 

This is undoubtedly the way the captain would want things. Vaughan has never demanded the limelight, never demanded anything much, according to his account of his time leading the national side, Calling The Shots priced at ? 18.99) 

Yet Vaughan, for all his reserve, proved an inspired and inspirational choice, at once a galvanising force for previously under-performing colleagues. 

The book reads like a vastly extended close-of-play boundary interview, and Vaughans experienced ghost-writer, Martin Hardy, should perhaps have been a less spectral presence and introduced some contrasting structural elements to break up his subjects monotonous flow. 

When the pair attempt literary flair, you wish they hadnt: The Australians thought they could batter us.

 North have it easy vs South

 Yuvraj justified his recall to Test squad with a fiery 60 

Indore: Yuvraj Singh once again justified his Test recall with a belligerent 60 as North Zone cantered to a comfortable seven-wicket victory against South to make it to the final of the Duleep Trophy on Friday. 

Chasing a target of 144, North Zone overcame minor hiccups before scoring the required runs in 22.5 overs on the fourth and final day of the league match here at the Usharaje Stadium. 

North lost openers Gautam Gambhir (6) and Virender Sehwag (16) cheaply and were reduced to 36 for three, before Yuvraj joined forces with Dinesh Mongia (52, 4x9) to steer the team to victory. Both Mongia and Yuvraj were in a punishing mood as they flayed the bowlers all round the park at will. Mongia hit nine fours while Yuvraj hit seven boundaries besides four sixes. 

Yuvraj slammed 20 runs in what turned out to be last over of the day, hitting a hapless M.R. Srinivas for two boundaries and two sixes to finish off the innings in style. 

BRIEF SCORES 

South Zone 338 amp; 305. North Zone 500 amp; 146/3 in 22.5 ovs (D. Mongia 52 n.o., Y. Singh 60 n.o.; Balaji 2/29). (PTI)

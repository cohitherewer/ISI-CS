The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Australia in title round

Pretoria: Skipper Belinda Clarke?s 62 powered Australia to the final of the women?s World Cup cricket championship on Tuesday. Set a target of 159 at the Supersport Park, the Aussies overtook the England total with five wickets to spare. 

The Aussies await the winners of the India versus and New Zealand semi-final. The final is slated for Sunday in Centurion. 

India finished with 30 points on the league table, while New Zealand have 29. 

England, put in to bat by Clarke, were bundled out in 49.4 overs. Australia cruised home in 47 overs. 

Top-scorer Clarke?s knock spanned 122 minutes and included seven boundaries. She shared crucial partnerships for the second and third wicket with Karen Rolton and Mel Jones. The other important contribution came from Lisa Delaka who made 29. 

Earlier, Cathryn Fitzpatrick took three wickets to have England gasping at 21 for three. Arran Brindle (32) and Clare Connor (30) tried to revive the English innings with a defiant stand. 

The floodgates opened again following Connor?s dismissal, leaving England at a precarious 106 for eight. 

Clare Taylor then chipped in with 29 to take England past 150. 

Fitzpatrick (three for 27) was the best bowler for Australia who are unbeaten in the tournament.

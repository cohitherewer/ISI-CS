 Warne mentor on England mission

Sydney: Shane Warne?s spin mentor Terry Jenner leaves this month to help England develop a Test-standard leg-spinner. 

Jenner has been hired by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to unearth the closest he can find to the next Warne, who is Test cricket?s leading bowler with 561 wickets. 

Warne?s mentor leaves for England on January 9 in a project that has already spanned five years. 

?It?s not about finding another Shane Warne ? there?s only one of him, and only ever will be,? Jenner said on Saturday. 

?But they want a leg spinner. They have seen what (paceman) Glenn McGrath and Warne have done and like a lot of countries, they are looking at that as a bit of a model for the way the game can be played. 

?A quick and a fantastic leggie. Finding the fast bowlers isn?t the major problem. Finding a good leg-spinner is. 

?There is some good talent over there. I?d say at the same age there is as much talent in England as there is in Australia. ?But I think players are maybe more determined to push themselves and do the work here than some of the younger English blokes.?

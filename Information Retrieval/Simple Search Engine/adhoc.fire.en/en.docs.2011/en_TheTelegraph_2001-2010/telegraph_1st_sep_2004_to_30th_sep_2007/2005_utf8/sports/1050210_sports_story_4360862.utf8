The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India colts go two up

Agartala: India under-19 defeated England by three wickets in a low-scoring one-dayer at the Maharaja Bir Bikram Stadium here on Wednesday to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. 

After Steven Davies opted to bat first, the tourists could only score 169 in 48.5 overs. The hosts scored 173 for seven with four overs to spare. 

None of the English batsmen could come to terms with the spinning track except for the skipper who made 22 before being caught by Manoj Tewari off Gaurav Dhiman. 

T. Smith (19), Moeen Ali (18), M. Stoke (15), B. Harmison (13) and A. Harrison (11) failed to build on their starts. 

M. Tehlan was the pick of the Indian bowlers taking five for 25. 

India lost four quick wickets for 66 but reached the target through some superb batting by MoM Ankit Rawat (69). Indians reached to their target off the last ball of 46th over with three wickets to spare. 

Brief scores: England U-19 169 in 38 ovs (S. Davies 22; M. Tehlan 5/25). India U-19 173/7 in 46 ovs (A. Rawat 69, R. Shukla 32; Moeen Ali 3/32). India U-19 won by 3 wkts.

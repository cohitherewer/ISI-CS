 Army XI hold Air India

New Delhi: A late equaliser from Samuel allowed Army XI to share points with Air India, Mumbai in the opening match of the quarter final league stage of the Durand Cup here on Wednesday. 

Samuels powerful strike from outside the penalty box beat custodian Yusuf Ansari with only five minutes left, thus neutralising P. Shivalkars eighth minute goal. 

It took only eight minutes for Air India to forge ahead. Shivalkar received a pass on the left edge of the penalty area and dribbled past two Army defenders before launching a strong grounder which beat the goalkeeper on his far post. 

The first meaningful attempt from the Army team came in the 18th minute when a header by Hemant Lama was tipped over the woodwork by Ansari. When play resumed, Army XI missed a golden chance to equalise when skipper L. Angam failed to tap in the ball after a goalmouth melee. 

Air India had an opportunity to put the result beyond doubt but Sheikh Sanjib managed a weak shot from just inside the box with only Robi Kanta Singh to beat. 

The equaliser came late when a free-kick, which was cleared by Air India defence only for it to reach Samuel, who found the top corner of Ansaris goal. (PTI)

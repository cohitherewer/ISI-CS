 Grandmasters Sandipan Chanda and Surya Sekhar Ganguly at Gorky Sadan on Thursday 

Calcutta: Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly, who was instrumental in winning Indias maiden Asian team title in Iran that concluded on Wednesday, however, felt that the tournament would have been more competitive had defending champions China been around. 

The tiring flight journey from Iran didnt reflect on their faces when they turned up for the prize distribution ceremony of The Telegraph Schools Chess championship. 

This time we were looking forward to take revenge against China as they denied us the title last year, Surya said. This time still it was a tough field. Iran A team had put up a tough challenge but we fought well, he stated. 

On his future plans Surya said: I will now play the tournament organised by CPAI and then I will play in Gibraltar and Moscow. 

Surya Sekhar and Sandipan both are products of this Fide rated school tournament and their presence on the final day was a golden moment for the young chess players. 

Meanwhile, Sandipan feels that this tournament provides a good launching pad for the young players. We are the products of this event and after it was recognised by Fide then it has become more competitive, concluded Sandipan.

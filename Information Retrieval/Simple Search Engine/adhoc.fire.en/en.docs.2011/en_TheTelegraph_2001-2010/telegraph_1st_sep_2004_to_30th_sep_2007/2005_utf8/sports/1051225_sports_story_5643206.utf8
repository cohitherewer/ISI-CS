 Twenty SA cricketers banned

Durban: In an unprecedented move in South African cricket, 20 players have been banned for three years each after they were found to have been involved in racist abuse and violence. 

In addition, two other players have been banned for 10 years each after being found to have been the chief culprits in a violence-ridden match in Durban on November 27. 

The president of the Kwazulu-Natal Cricket Union, Dr Logan Naidoo, said the players belonged to two first division clubs in Durban ? Reservoir Hills Crimson and Crusaders. 

An investigation had found that the Indian players had been subjected to racial abuse and one of them, Akesh Kisoonlal, was involved in a skirmish with one of the opposition players, Tim Dunk. 

The Indian players are reported to have been told: You coolies dont come into our area and take a chance, we will wipe you out. 

Another comment was: This guy is so black he should be playing for the African Warriors (a development team). Both Kisoonlal and Dunk had been banned by the disciplinary committee for ten years, five years of which had been suspended, provided they are not found to be involved in another incident again.

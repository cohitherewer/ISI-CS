 Loss a reality check: Federer

Rotterdam: Roger Federer believes his shock defeat in the semi-finals of the Australian Open provided him with a timely reality check. 

?I?ve become used to winning so much that when you lose, it can get to you easily as tennis is a very mental sport,? the world No. 1 said at the world indoor meet on Wednesday after winning his first match since that Melbourne defeat. 

?Everyone was praising me before and saying ?No one can beat Federer? which creates pressure. But I don?t want the pressure off my shoulders as I always want to win.? 

Federer had entered the season?s opening Grand Slam as one of the hottest favourites in the tournament?s history after capturing 11 titles in 2004. 

Enjoying a run of 21 consecutive victories, he even had a match point against eventual champion Marat Safin in an epic five-set contest. 

However, his decision to return a Safin lob with a shot between his legs eventually proved to be his downfall. 

?It?s hard to take, because I felt that maybe it was just another Grand Slam that went away from me,? said Federer, who won three of the four Slams last year. 

?But then again I was happy with the way I fought.?

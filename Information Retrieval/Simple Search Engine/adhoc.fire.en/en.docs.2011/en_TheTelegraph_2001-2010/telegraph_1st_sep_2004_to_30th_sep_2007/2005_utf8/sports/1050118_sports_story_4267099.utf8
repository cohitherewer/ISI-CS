The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Negotiations on, says Chidambaram 

New Delhi: Finance minister P. Chidambaram said on Monday that negotiations were on over the issue of granting tax exemption to the second of the tsunami charity cricket ties, raising hopes of India hosting the high-profile match. 

?Negotiations are on with the revenue department as well the BCCI,? Chidambaram told reporters here when asked if any decision had been taken on granting tax exemption to the match, the proceeds of which would go towards relief of victims of the tsunami disaster. 

The match, that the BCCI proposes to host in Calcutta, is most likely to be held anytime between February 11 and 13 to enable cricketers from Australia and New Zealand to take part in the fundraiser. 

The Board is fighting against time to get a positive response from the government since an ICC pre-condition requires that the match be exempted from tax. 

If India is unable to meet the pre-condition, in Lahore or Dhaka would get the chance to host the match.

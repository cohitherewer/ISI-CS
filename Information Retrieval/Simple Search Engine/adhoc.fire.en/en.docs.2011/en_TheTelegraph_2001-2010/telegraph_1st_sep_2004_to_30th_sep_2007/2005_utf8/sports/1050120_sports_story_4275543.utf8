The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Just play as you do, don?t get overawed?

 - Three experts on how Sania should tackle Serena

Calcutta:Sania Mirza?s march into the third 

round at the Australian Open has come as a welcome sign for women?s tennis in 

India. But how should she now tackle Serena Williams? 

The Telegraph spoke to three stalwarts of Indian tennis ? former Davis Cuppers, who have also either been captain or coach ? and this is what they had to say: 

AKHTAR ALI: It has been a great experience 

for Sania... A very creditable performance. She has nothing to lose against Serena 

and that should bring out the best in her. She?s only 18 and the success has been 

very good for Indian women?s tennis. 

I don?t expect her to beat Serena but it will be great to play in the third round singles of a Grand Slam. She?s from a conservative family and two weeks ago when her parents called before her departure for Australia, I had wished her well. Little did I realise then that she would make history in Melbourne. 

Sania?s hardworking and has a great future ahead. She hits the ball very hard and that?s the reason behind her international success. No technical advice for the match against Serena? Let she concentrate on her own game. 

NARESH KUMAR: Sania should play her natural 

game against Serena. The expectations will not be much, and hence, she will not 

be burdened with extra pres-sure. 

In such circumstances, there?s always this tendency to take a chance and try to do things beyond one?s capability. My advice would be not to get carried away since that can make the task difficult for her. 

She?s performed excellently and has had two good matches. 

She?s now up against a very, very difficult task. Serena?s speed and service is very strong and it will be a tough proposition for her to match the American. 

JAIDIP MUKERJEA: Sania?s done very well in 

the last two matches but it?s going to be tough for her against the former world 

No. 1. She shouldn?t be overawed by the occasion and concentrate on her natural 

game. If good enough, she will cross this hurdle too. 

She has been fantastic till now. Except for Leander (Paes) and Mahesh (Bhupathi), no Indian has enjoyed so much success in a Grand Slam in recent years. 

Hats off to her and her success is good for women?s tennis. Lots of promising youngsters are waiting in the wings and the future looks good.

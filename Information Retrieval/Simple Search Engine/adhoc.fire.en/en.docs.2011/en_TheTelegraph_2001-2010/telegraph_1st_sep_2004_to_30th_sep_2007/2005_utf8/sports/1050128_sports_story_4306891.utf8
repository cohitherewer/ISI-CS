Calcutta: Players of Sporting Clube de Goa, their manager Angelo Albuquerque and coach Clifford Chukuwama were on way to the airport Wednesday evening when their bus overturned near Rajarhat in the eastern fringes of the city and four were seriously injured. They are now out danger and are at a Salt Lake clinic recovering, but the All India Football Federation has cancelled the Goa club?s three forthcoming engagements (fourth to sixth rounds) of the ninth National Football League. 

The injured ? Joseph Pereira (midfielder), Peter Pereira (midfielder), John Barreto (midfielder) and Ajay Diwadkar (defender) were rushed to Suraksha clinic. Among them, Joseph and Peter were seriously hurt, having sustained head injuries. However, hospital authorities said they are now out of danger.

Some others were taken to a nearby Apollo hospital. Among them Sandip Colaco was released on Thursday while the rest were released on Wednesday itself. 

The team was supposed to meet Mahindra United in Mumbai on Saturday, but the AIFF has cancelled the Goa club?s three forthcoming engagements, adds PTI from New Delhi. 

According to the AIFF, the matches will be rescheduled after considering their medical reports. 

According to a spokesman of Suraksha, ?Joseph and Peter were taken to intensive care unit (ICU) while John and Ajay were put in the high dependency unit (HDU) on Wednesday. CT scans on Joseph and Peter revealed nothing. 

?While, John and Ajay have been moved to the general ward on Thursday and may be released Friday, the other two have been shifted to the HDU and a decision on when to release them will be taken by the medical board on Thursday.? 

The manager and the five players have stayed behind.

 Bangla teenager close to history

 - Mushfiqur presses claim for Test debut 

DEREK PRINGLE

 Whatmore says Mushfiqur has shown a maturity far beyond his age 

Bangladesh are not expected to break many records in the Test series against England that begins on Thursday, but one that should fall their way is the youngest player to make his Test debut at Lords, after teenager Mushfiqur Rahim played himself into contention with a brilliant unbeaten century during a tame draw against Northamptonshire. 

At 16 years and 264 days, and barely 5ft tall in his socks, you feel Bangladeshs selectors ought to be reading Mushfiqur a bedtime story rather than handing him a Test cap. 

Callowness can be relative, especially in Bangladesh where privation tends to make children grow up fast. Yet, given the same depleted Northamptonshire attack to face, he coped rather better than his more experienced colleagues, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the team coach Dav Whatmore. 

Im pleased for Mushfiqur, he looks so controlled ? an old head on young shoulders, Whatmore said. I see no reason why he shouldnt play at Lords. It would be a good positive move and a great Test debut for him. 

The lad is showing he wants to play and that means a lot, Whatmore said. 

Despite being the reserve wicketkeeper, the visual and statistical evidence for including him as a batsmen is categoric, and this was his second hundred in only his fifth first-class match, a body of work that also includes two fifties. 

There will be caveats for the selectors, not least that an early encounter with Stephen Harmison might do more harm than good. India delayed Sachin Tendulkars Test debut until after a series against the West Indies (when they had a barrage of fast bowlers), just in case it should do lasting damage. 

The temptation to play him will be great and deserved. While teammates found increasingly soft and irresponsible ways to donate their wickets, Mushfiqur showed both resolve and a compact technique. 

His only error came well after his hundred, when he carved left-arm seamer Charl Pietersen to gully. The catch was floored, but by then so were the bowlers. 

Mushfiqurs disdain for off-spinner Andrew White, whom he kept drilling to the extra cover boundary, bordered on bullying and a six off another White, leg-spinner Rob, took him to his highest first-class score. 

Englands bowlers will be a different proposition, but his confidence on the pitch was more than matched during his press conference off it. 

Cricket is not an age or a height thing, he said when asked if he was big or old enough to play Tests. I just watch the ball and play it. The coach told me to play sensibly, which has helped me get runs in England. Im getting excited about chances of playing at Lords and Im sleeping okay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Morientes to sign for Reds

Madrid: Spanish international striker Fernando Morientes will join Liverpool from Real Madrid for a fee of nine million euros ($11.8 million), the Primera Liga club said on Wednesday. 

?The player will travel to Liverpool this afternoon in order to undergo a medical tomorrow,? the club said on its website. Liverpool were unable to comment on the Real announcement. 

Morientes?s move to Anfield had been mooted for weeks, with Liverpool known to be in the market for a striker during the January transfer window and the Premier League club?s new coach Rafael Benitez expected to pick another fellow Spaniard. 

The 28-year-old would become the fifth Spanish player to join under Benitez after former Real Madrid team-mate Antonio Nunez, Luis Garcia, Josemi and Xabi Alonso. 

Argentine centre-back Mauricio Pellegrino arrived last week from Benitez?s former club Valencia. 

Though he is ineligible for the Champions League, having already played for Real in the group stage, Morientes should provide a much-needed boost to Liverpool?s domestic form. 

Liverpool had expected a flood of goals this season after pairing Michael Owen with Djibril Cisse, only to suffer a drought after the England forward went to Real in August and the Ligue 1 top-scorer suffered a double leg-break in October. 

It was Morientes?s performances last season at Monaco, who he helped to reach the Champions League final, that meant he would no longer be satisfied with a second-string role at Real. (Reuters)

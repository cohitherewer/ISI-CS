The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Narow escape for Khalil 

 Khalil?s car turned turtle 

 Karachi: Pakistan pacer 

 Mohammed Khalil narrowly ditched death after suffering a 

 serious road accident in Islamabad on Saturday. Khalil?s 

 car turned turtle at high speed after he tried to avoid 

 a cyclist who suddenly emerged from the right side of the 

 high-speed track. 

 The bowler, in an unconscious state, was rushed to 

 a local hospital where he was kept for 24 hours under intensive 

 care. 

He was discharged on Sunday with stitches on his face and head. He also suffered bruises on his shoulder, hand and other parts of the body but there were no fractured bones. 

 Khalil had returned from India last week after participating 

 in the three-Test series. He played the Calcutta Test which 

 Pakistan lost. The 23-year-old has played two Tests and 

 three one-day Internationals for Pakistan so far. 

 When contacted in his hometown 

 in Peshawar, Khalil said: ?I am still in a state of shock. 

 It was a terrible experience. I am thankful to almighty 

 to survive because my friends and relatives who saw my car, 

 were simply amazed to see me escape with injuries that can 

 now be termed as minor,? Khalil said. (PTI)

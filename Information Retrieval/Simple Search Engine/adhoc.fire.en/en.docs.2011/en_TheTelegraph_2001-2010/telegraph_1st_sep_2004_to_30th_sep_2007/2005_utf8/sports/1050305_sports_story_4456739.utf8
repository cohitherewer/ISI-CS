The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Female fans mob Afridi

Dharamshala: Shahid Afridi, whose unconventional good looks and cavalier style has won him many female fans, has struck a chord with the fair sex in this sleepy holiday resort as well. 

For about 30 minutes, the Pakistani cricketer had to endure mock chiding from his Indian female fans who had come to watch him at the nets Friday. Accha, to ab idhar aa jao (ok, why don?t you come here), Afridi said to one over-enthusiastic fan. 

Asked about all the attention, Afridi said as long as his flamboyant batting brought the crowds to the stadiums, he did not bother about the rest. 

?It doesn?t matter. If you are good, you will get a good response, whether it is India or Australia or England. Obviously in Pakistan the culture is totally different but I don?t mind,? said Afridi, who celebrated his 25th birthday the very next day he arrived in India on February 28. 

Afridi, however, said the days of his rendezvous with young women were behind him. ?I am married now and have two kids. Of course there are lots of experience but I can?t tell all that now.?

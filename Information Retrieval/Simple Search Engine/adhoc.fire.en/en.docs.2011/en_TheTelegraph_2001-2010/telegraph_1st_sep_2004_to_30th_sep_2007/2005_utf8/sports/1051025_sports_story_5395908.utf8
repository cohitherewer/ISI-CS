 No pressure on me, says Atwal

 - Indian star feels he has become more consistent 

 Atwal feels he doesnt have to prove anything 

New Delhi: Ace golfer Arjun Atwal on Monday said he might be in a catch 22 situation as he is returning to the course after a month-long break but denied he was under pressure to win the Hero Honda Indian Open starting here on Thursday. 

There is no pressure on me. Whether an Indian wins or not doesnt bother me, said Atwal, the first Indian to play on the US PGA tour, after a practice round at the Delhi Golf Club course, the venue for the open. 

When I play on the Tour, I play for myself. And I dont have to prove anything, do I? I have the confidence coming from winning 2003 Hero Honda Masters here. I have some good memories of this course. 

The last time an Indian won the event was in 2002 when Jyoti Randhawa claimed the title. Mike Cunning and Mardan Mamat won the following editions. 

Atwal, who has retained the card for next years US PGA, agreed that capturing his peak form that saw him finish in the top-10 four times this season and earn $963,768 in prize money was not going to be easy. 

I am a bit rusty, but I am also lot more relaxed. It is a catch 22 situation, said the 33-year-old whose last tournament was the Valero Texas Open four weeks ago. 

But there could be no doubt that the Indian has been in sublime form. He had a career-best finish of tied second at the Bellsouth Classic and was No. 1 on the putting average before slipping to his current second. Atwal said with a bit more luck he could have won the Bellsouth. 

 I had shot an eight under in the final round, and did not think of the play-offs. I was in the clubhouse when others were still finishing the last round. It was couple of hours and I lost my rhythm there. 

When I was called for the play-offs I did not have the rhythm of the original round and hit my first shot into water, Atwal recalled the memorable moment. 

How close did he think he came to winning his maiden title then? 

Of course, no one had a birdie in the play-off. If I had found the green and made a birdie, I could have won, he said. 

New Orleans was another event where he fancied his chances. 

At the BC Open, too, I had a one-shot lead going into the back nine, and then finished ninth from there. Obviously, I did not play well in the last nine holes. 

Atwal said consistency was one area where he had improved immensely. I am a lot more consistent now, am playing week in and out. I missed lot of cuts after winning the Caltex Masters (in 2002), but I missed the cut only once on the PGA Tour.

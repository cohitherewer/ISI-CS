 Sourav has transformed India: Inzy

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Karachi: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq is convinced that Sachin Tendulkar would take the risk and play in the upcoming series even if he is half-fit, considering the stakes involved in an Indo-Pak encounter. 

?He is a great player and would hate to miss the mother of all series. I think even if he is half-fit, he will take the risk of playing in the series because he knows his influence over his team and the confidence his presence gives to the players,? Inzamam said on Saturday. 

Tendulkar is recovering from a left-elbow injury and is expected to be fully fit before the first Test begins early next month. 

Inzamam was all praise for the Indian batting genius saying one could always learn something new from Tendulkar. 

?We have been under Tendulkar?s hammer quite often, but I have always enjoyed watching him bat. Each time he goes out there, he teaches you something new. He is a thorough entertainer, a great teacher and a true model for youngsters,? he remarked. 

The skipper was also effusive in his praise of Sourav Ganguly and had no hesitation in declaring that he was the best captain around, given the way he has transformed the Indian team. 

?The present Indian side has started believing in itself. They now know that they can win matches abroad. A few years ago, there was only one match-winner in the team, now every player is capable of single-handedly guiding India to victory,? Inzamam stated. 

?They are no more dependent on just one player anymore. This is a great turnaround and the credit for this massive transformation has to given to Sourav Ganguly. In my book, he is the best captain today,? he said. 

On the kind of wickets he expects to face in India, Inzamam said it was the prerogative of the home team to prepare pitches although personally he would like to play on faster tracks. 

?It is the prerogative of the home team what type of pitches they want to prepare. I would let Sourav decide on that but if he asks me, I will opt for fast tracks.? 

Meanwhile, Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi says he would try to curb his impulse to hit every ball for a six and help his team build a long innings in Test matches. 

?It?s going to be my first full tour to India and I am keen to earn honour and glory for my country against the arch rivals,? the hard hitting batsman said. 

?I am fully aware that India-Pakistan series will be full of tension and it will be a hard tour, but it?s my goal to perform under pressure,? Afridi quipped. 

The 24-year-old holds the record for hitting the fastest one-day hundred off just 37 balls against Kenya in 1996. Recently he became the first batsman in ODI history to complete 200 sixes.

But Afridi said he was trying to curb his habit of 

hitting every ball for a six as Pakistan, who lack batting experience as compared 

to India, need youngsters to complement seniors Inzamam-ul Haq and Yousuf Youhana. 

?Look, they have Tendulkar, Sehwag, Dravid and Laxman, who can play long innings. Staying at the crease for long periods is the key in Test matches. We have only two good batsmen in Inzamam and Youhana. 

?So, in this scenario, the young lot like Salman Butt, Yasir Hameed and others have got to be consistent to help in building the innings,? he added. 

Afridi, whose strike rate is above 100, hoped that his team?s batting would click in the three-Test series which also features five one-dayers. 

?The Indians will be having a slight edge in home conditions. But if our batting clicks it?s going to be an interesting series. 

?We have to produce top class performance in batting, bowling and fielding to beat them on their home grounds.? 

The Karachi-born player said the recent Australian tour toughened the team members and they have improved their performance in the later stage of the tour. 

Afridi also rued the fact that Pakistan did not have a top class spinner in their line-up. ?Leg spinner Danish Kaneria is our main spinner,? he said but added that Indian batsmen have a good track record against tweakers on their home grounds. (PTI)

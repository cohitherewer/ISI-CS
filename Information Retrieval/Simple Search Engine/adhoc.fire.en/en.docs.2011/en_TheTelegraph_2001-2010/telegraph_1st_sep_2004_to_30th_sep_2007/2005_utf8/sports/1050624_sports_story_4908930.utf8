A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Accolades for Bula Chowdhury keep coming, reminders of not only her sprinting heydays but her seven-seas successes as well. 

Now she has been inducted into the organising committee of the 2010 Commonwealth Games to be held in New Delhi. She has been invited by Suresh Kalmadi, chairman of the organising committee for her experience, Bula told The Telegraph here Thursday. 

She also said that she has submitted to the West Bengal Government a project for the countrys first swimming academy that she wishes to set up. She has asked for three acres of land near the Bypass. 

Meanwhile, the long pending felicitation for Bulas seven-seas conquering feat will come off on July 5.

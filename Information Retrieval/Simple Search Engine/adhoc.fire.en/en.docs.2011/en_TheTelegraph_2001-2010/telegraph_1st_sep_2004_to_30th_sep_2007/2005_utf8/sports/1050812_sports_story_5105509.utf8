Manchester: Australias Shane Warne became the first man to take 600 Test wickets on Thursday but Michael Vaughan cut short his celebrations on the opening day of the third Ashes Test. 

The England captain ended his lean run to score 166, the first century of the series. The home side, fresh from levelling the contest at Edgbaston, closed on 341 for five after opting to bat on a flawless track. 

For Australia, the day began perfectly when Glenn McGrath was declared fit after missing the second Test with damaged ankle ligaments. Things, however, got worse as the world champions dropped four catches in a ragged fielding display. 

Vaughan, who hit one six and 21 fours, was given two lives and also bowled off a no-ball before recording his 15th Test century. 

Marcus Trescothick made 63 in a 137-run stand for the second wicket while Ian Bell, struggling at times, put on 127 with Vaughan for the third wicket to end on 59 not out. Nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard was bowled by Brett Lees final ball of the day. 

I always knew low scores had to end somewhere. Fortunately it ended for me today, said Vaughan. A lot of people talk about technique, a lot of people talk about pressure. Today I just wanted to go out and bat on instinct. 

The defining moment, though, was Warnes. 

He dismissed Trescothick, caught-behind off an attempted sweep for his landmark. 

It was not pretty but Warne did not care. The ball came off the back of the left-handers bat and looped up off Adam Gilchrists thigh before the wicketkeeper gratefully completed the catch. 

The crowd rose to give Warne his ovation, the 35-year-old saluting back by holding the ball above his head. He ended the day with one for 75 to Lees three for 58. 

Vaughan hogged the rest of the applause. 

McGrath, who appeared to have little chance of playing after also missing the second Test, ended the day empty-handed on none for 76 although he deserved a lot more. His second ball of the match spat up and flew over the slips for four off Trescothicks gloves. 

Trescothick, beaten repeatedly, should have been out to McGrath again on 13 but Gilchrist tried to take the catch one-handed and fumbled. 

Lee made the breakthrough, shaking up Andrew Strauss with a 95mph lifter that hit him just under his jaw line, then fooling him with a slow yorker. Strauss, who made six, was Lees 150th Test wicket. 

Vaughan marched in at 26 for one and looked assured immediately, turning the ball off his legs and driving immaculately off the back foot. It was 93 for one at lunch. Soon after, Vaughan had his double lucky escape. 

Cutting at McGrath, he snicked high to first slip but Gilchrist dived across Warne and tipped the ball for four. Next delivery, Vaughan drove, missed and lost his off stump only for a no-ball to be called. Vaughan, breathing again, celebrated with two lavish back foot boundaries off Jason Gillespie.

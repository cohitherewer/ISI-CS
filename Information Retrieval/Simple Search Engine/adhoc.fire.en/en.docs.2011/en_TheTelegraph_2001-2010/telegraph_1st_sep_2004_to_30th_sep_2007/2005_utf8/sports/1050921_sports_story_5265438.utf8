 Dressing room talk should not come out: Sachin

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday said that what is discussed in the dressing room should remain inside and not come out in the open. 

Its difficult for me to speak on the issue. But such talks should not come out of the dressing room, and if it comes out, then its not right. Dressing room discussions should remain within the dressing room only, he said. 

BCCI should speak to the players after they come back. We would get the real story once they talk to the (Board) officials (after returning home), Sachin said. 

The champion batsman was reacting to a query about his view on the recent spat between Indian captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Greg Chappell in Zimbabwe. 

Sachin, recuperating from an elbow surgery undergone in late May in London, was not forthcoming on whether he would take part in the Super Series ties in Australia for the World XI squad next month. 

I am fine and feeling good. But I cant say anything to the press (now). I would inform the Board on Wednesday (on whether I would be playing in the Super Series or not), Sachin said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A win and a draw for Anand vs Kramnik 

 - MONACO MEET 

- Indian GM on top despite dropping half a point 

 Anand is still on top 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand saw his cent per cent win record come to an end when he had to be content with a win and a draw against Russian Vladimir Kramnik in the fourth round of the amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament here. 

Though the Indian ace could not complete a 2-0 verdict against Kramnik after taking the blindfold game, but the 1.5-0.5 win once again proved that Anand was one of the best in the business. 

Anand with an indomitable 7.5/8 score maintained his huge two points lead in the tournament and it seems now that the Indian is unstoppable in his quest for his fourth Amber chess title. 

Going into the first rest day, Russian Alexander Morozevich and Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk are on joint second spot in the unique tournament with 5.5 points apiece which could be termed as a very good score but for Anand?s extraordinary heroics in the tournament so far. 

Russian peter Svidler and Corus champion Peter Leko of Hungary are joint fourth with five points apiece while Kramnik is right behind them with 4.5 points in his bag, with seven rounds still left in this euros 193250 prize money tournament. 

Besides helping him in strengthening his tournament situation, the victory over Kramnik helped Anand in securing the top spot solely in the blindfold section as well where the Russian had been giving him company so far. 

Now the Indian stalwart has a full point lead in the blindfold and half a point lead in the rapid section of the tournament. 

Playing white in the blindfold, Anand was a class act in the Petroff defence game, in which Kramnik failed to get what was expected from him. 

In the last event, Kramnik had emerged as the undisputed king of the blindfold chess and here too he was thus far giving Anand a run for his money. 

However, as the dust subsided after Anand?s rather simplified choice of opening variation, Kramnik proved no match and subsequent exchanges led to a lost endgame. 

It took Anand 52 moves to force resignation. 

In the rapid, Anand?s juggernaut after seven straight victories in the tournament was finally halted but experts predict that it is only a temporary matter. 

Kramnik decidedly played safe chess with white pieces after Anand came up with a surprise Berlin defence in the opening. It may be recalled that Kramnik played the pioneer to popularise Berlin defence in his Braingames match against fellow Russian Garri Kasparov. 

However, given Anand?s great run in the tournament so far and Kramnik?s misery a few hours before in the blindfold the draw was almost a predictable result and it was reached in just 24 moves. 

Right from the beginning, Alexander Morozevich was considered a dangerous opponent and he proved it yet again with a 2-0 whitewash of compatriot Evgeny Bareev. 

First it was the blindfold that provoked a blunder from Bareev as he misjudged his rook position and left it en prise for a queen capture. 

After making his blunder Bareev in fact was relieved as he thought his rook was protected but as he kept on trying to click his mouse the computer did not respond as it was an illegal move. 

In the rapid game, Bareev played a rather speculative 

piece sacrifice and Moroevich defended accurately to obtain a won position. The 

technicalities, thereafter, had no troubles for the winner. (PTI)

 Player-media policy change

New Delhi: The Indian cricket board is likely to incorporate new clauses in the players contracts as part of its effort to streamline its policy with regard to media commitments of cricketers, a BCCI official said on Sunday. 

The new terms and conditions on how and when players could deal with the media, will be in addition to what exists in the contracts and probably included when the contracts are renewed in November. (PTI)

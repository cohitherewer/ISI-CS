Hong Kong: Jyoti Randhawa holed a huge 25-footer on the 18th and final hole to keep himself in the frame at the $1.2 million Hong Kong Open. 

Randhawa, two-over for the day at the stage, finished at one-over and was four-under 136 at the midway stage to be in 11th place ? still a fair distance from bigger honours over the weekend. 

Five of the seven Indians ? Randhawa, Jeev Milkha Singh, Shiv Kapur, Gaurav Ghei and Amandeep Johl ? made the cut. Randhawa was the best at tied 11th, five strokes off the lead, held by Canadian Rick Gibson, whose second round was a 66 with five birdies and one bogey at the Hong Kong Golf Club. 

Gibson, who came to Hong Kong after a three-week break, was one clear of southpaw Edward Loar, whose six-under 64 helped him to eight-under for 36 holes. 

Briton Colin Montgomerie sounded a warning after he shot a second round four-under-par 66 to move into contention at the halfway stage. 

Jeev Milkha was the only Indian with two sub-par rounds of 69 each and at two-under he was tied 20th. 

Kapur, who found 15 greens in regulation, had just three birdies to show for it, as he too had a frustrating day on the greens. He carded a 70 and was at one-under 139 in tied 34th, while Gaurav Ghei was tied 47th at even par. 

Johl just made the cut with a 69 that included a jumpy par on the 18th. He was tied 60th at one over. Rahil Gangjee (144), Harmeet Kahlon (148) missed the cut, as did Indo-Swede Daniel Chopra (149).

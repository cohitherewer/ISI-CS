 Bond back after a year

 - NZ TOUR OF ZIMBABWE 

 Shane Bond has recovered from a back injury 

Wellington: Shane Bond has been recalled to the New Zealand Test and one day squads for the tour of Zimbabwe starting in August. The paceman will be returning to international action after a year-long injury break. 

Wellington off-spinner Jeetan Patel, picked for the ODI squad, is the only new face in both line-ups selected on Tuesday. 

Bond will provide a welcome boost to the Black Caps attack after making a successful recovery from surgery to fix a persistent back problem. 

It is exciting to see Shane Bond back after a successful return to first-class cricket, New Zealand coach John Bracewell said in a statement. 

We will monitor his progress in Australia with the Emerging Players team and expect that should he continue to progress well, we will see him return to international cricket at some stage during the Zimbabwe tour. 

Pacer Daryl Tuffey and allrounder Chris Harris have both been left out of the touring party as they recover from injuries. 

The squads are almost full-strength with no players unavailable because of moral concerns about Zimbabwes human rights situation.

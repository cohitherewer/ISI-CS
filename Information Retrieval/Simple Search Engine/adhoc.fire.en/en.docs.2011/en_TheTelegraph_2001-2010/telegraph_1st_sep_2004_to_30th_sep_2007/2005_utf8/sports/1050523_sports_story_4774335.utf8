The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Monday, May 23, 2005 

 London: Twice Olympic 10,000 metres champion Haile Gebrselassie won the Great Manchester 10 kms race in a British record 27 minutes 25 seconds on Sunday.

 The 32-year-old Ethiopian, who has retired from the track to concentrate on the marathon, sliced 14 seconds off Kenyan Felix Limo?s previous best.

 Gebrselassie pulled out of last month?s London marathon after his training was hampered by an injured left Achilles tendon. 

 Patiala: National record holder K. M. Binu will receive Rs 1 lakh from Milkha Singh in July for breaking the 400m record set by the ?Flying Sikh? in the 1960 Rome Olympics.

 Binu clocked 45.48 seconds to better Milkha?s time and qualified for the semi-finals in the Athens Olympics. In the process he also clipped 0.08 off the national record set by Paramjit Singh in 2000 at Chennai.

 Though Paramjeet had bettered Milkha?s mark, clocking 45.73 in Calcutta in 1998 and later 45.56 in Chennai, no one has bettered the legend?s time of 45.6 outside India and it was this 44-year-old record that Binu broke in Athens.

 Milkha had promised Rs 1 lakh to the athlete who betters his record. 

 Moscow: Russian president Vladimir Putin hosted CSKA Moscow?s players and coaches at his home to congratulate them on their Uefa Cup victory.

 In return, he got a gold shirt with his name on the back.

 Praising the club for its ?brilliant result? in Wednesday?s 3-1 victory over Sporting Lisbon, Putin said on Saturday he had watched the entire match. The come-from-behind win produced the first European title for a Russian team.

 CSKA coach Valery Gazzayev handed a soccer ball to Putin, who bounced it on an oriental rug and placed it in the trophy. 

 Niigata: Japan?s World Cup qualifying preparations were upset with a 1-0 home defeat by a depleted Peru side on Sunday.

 Substitute Gustavo Enrique Vassallo scored an injury-time winner to give the visitors victory against the run of play in Niigata.

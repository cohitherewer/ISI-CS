 Vasco out of elite division

Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa kept themselves on course for the title when they beat Vasco 5-2 in the 20th round of the National Football League at Nehru Stadium here Friday. 

With this win, Sporting, who have played two matches more than East Bengal and Dempo, lead the table with 42 points from 20 matches. East Bengal (39 points) and Dempo (38 points) follow Sporting. 

With 17 points from 20 matches Vasco?s relegation is confirmed. Sporting, who led 2-1 at half time, scored through Dudu Omagbemi (8th, 50th, 86th), Edeh Chidi (37th) and Wilton Gomes (68th) while Sidney Rodrigues (34th) and substitute Levy Coelho (75th) reduced the margin for Vasco. Dudu, who was the leading scorer with 20 goals, was declared the Man of the Match for his brilliant efforts scoring three goals. 

The match started at a fast pace as both the teams matched each other in the first half. Sporting, who needed a win to stay in the title hunt along with East Bengal and Dempo, forged ahead in the 8th minute. 

Chidi, who combined well along with Dudu upfront, laid a pass to Dudu who fell down along with rival defender Kamal Thapa while going for a tackle. But Dudu quickly got up and gained position to essay a left footer into the net. 

Vasco retaliated and after coming close to scoring once restored parity through Sidney Rodrigues when he directed a curling shot off a free kick past ?keeper Luis Barreto to find the far post. 

Three minutes later, Sporting again took the lead after a move which saw Wilton Gomes from the right giving a pass to Dudu on the left. The latter relayed it to Chidi, who beat a defender before getting better of the onrushing Virender Singh. He sent a deft placement to give Sporting 2-1 lead at halftime. 

After the change of ends, Sporting continued to dictate terms with Dudu and Chidi troubling the rival defence.

 Fifa orders replay

 - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain 

Tokyo: Fifa have declared the result of Saturdays Asian World Cup qualifying play-off between Uzbekistan and Bahrain void and ordered a replay following a refereeing blunder. 

Soccers governing body ruled on Tuesday that Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida made a technical error in disallowing an Uzbekistan penalty and then awarding Bahrain a free-kick instead of ordering it to be retaken. 

Uzbekistans 1-0 home victory has been wiped out and Wednesdays second leg in Bahrain has been postponed. The tie will instead be played on October 8 and 12. 

Taking into consideration that the referee...had indeed committed a technical error, as a consequence, the match needed to be replayed, Fifa said in a statement. 

Yoshida waved off Server Djeparovs 39th-minute penalty in Tashkent and gave Bahrain an indirect free-kick after spotting an infringement. 

In such a situation, the laws of the game require the referee to order the penalty kick to be retaken, said Fifa. 

The decision was approved by Lennart Johansson, chairman of the 2006 World Cup organising committee. 

Uzbekistan, however, are still unhappy with the verdict after Fifa rejected their request to be awarded a 3-0 win. 

Obviously it is not fair for us to replay the whole game after winning 1-0 and then being robbed of a successful penalty, an Uzbekistan spokesman said. 

Rizayev added that UFF officials will attend the Fifa congress in Morocco on September 10 and lobby for the game to be restarted from the penalty incident with Uzbekistan 1-0 up. Since Fifa did not award us a 3-0 win as we demanded, we ask for the first leg to be replayed from 38th minute, he said.

 Getafe?s turn to humble Real

Madrid: Real Madrid slumped to a 1-2 defeat at lowly Getafe as the 29-time Spanish champions fell 11 points behind league leaders and bitter rivals Barcelona in the race for the title. 

After winning seven straight games following the arrival of Wanderley Luxemburgo as coach, Real have now won only one of their last five league outings. 

Real?s latest loss comes in the wake of their Champions League departure on Wednesday, and they now face the prospect of a second successive season without a trophy. 

Raul Albiol opened the scoring for Getafe six minutes before the break. Albiol was booked for ripping his shirt off in delight to celebrate his first goal for Getafe after moving from Valencia last summer ? but there was a particular reason for his joy. He missed the first half of the season after being involved in a bad car crash while moving his possessions to the Spanish capital?s southern suburbs and was in a coma for several days. 

There were initially fears for his life but Albiol made a remarkable recovery. Adding to the fairytale of Getafe?s first league visit from the Spanish giants, their second goal came from Riki Sanchez four minutes after the break. It was sweet revenge for Sanchez, the Real reserve who was discarded last summer. 

In Italy, AC Milan and Juventus remained neck and neck at the top of Serie A after they both recorded hard-fought 1-0 victories but the Turin giants? victory at Chievo was shrouded in controversy. 

Reigning champions Milan defeated Sampdoria at home for their seventh league win on the trot and Juventus edged Chievo in Verona on Sunday. Brazilian playmaker Kaka headed Milan?s winner in the 65th minute, while Uruguayan midfielder Ruben Olivera struck for Juventus three minutes from time before being sent off for two yellow cards. 

However, Juventus? win was controversial as Chievo had a perfectly good goal ruled out five minutes after half-time. Sergio Pelissier broke free and hammered a right-footed shot that hit the underside of the crossbar and clearly crossed the line before bouncing back into play. 

Referee Gianluca Paparesta consulted his linesman who saw things differently and said the ball had bounced on the goalline. Slow-motion television replays confirmed that the whole ball was behind the line by about a yard. 

Juventus rubbed salt into Chievo?s wounds in the 87th minute when Olivera pounced from close range after the home defence had failed to clear a high ball. 

Patrick Kluivert?s fifth-minute strike put Newcastle into the FA Cup semis after a 1-0 victory over Tottenham. 

The Dutchman kept the Magpies on course for a first FA Cup triumph for 50 years with a strike from Alan Shearer?s pass. 

Paul Dickov converted a penalty eight minutes from the end to knock out his former club Leicester and put Blackburn into the semis for the first time in 45 years.

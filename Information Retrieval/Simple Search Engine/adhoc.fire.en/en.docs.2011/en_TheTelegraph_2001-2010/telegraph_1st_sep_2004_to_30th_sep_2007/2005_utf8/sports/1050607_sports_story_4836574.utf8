 IN THE CITY

 It is now the East Bengal juniors? turn to complete what their seniors missed out on ? the hattrick of titles in the (under-19) National Football League (NFL). 

 The East Bengal under-19 side left for Mumbai to play the championship-round of the competition on Monday. Coach Tarun Dey, however, looked concerned about lack of practice. East Bengal will take on Vasco in their first match on Thursday. 

 Basudeb Mondal and Manas Das withdrew their transfers in favour of Mohun Bagan for another season in the inter-club transfers on Monday. Bhola Dey, however, switched allegiance to newly-promoted side in the NFL, Mohammedan Sporting. 

 Mahindra United goalkeeper Nasim Akhtar sought inter-state transfer for East Bengal. 

 CRICKET: P. Sen Trophy matches at various grounds from 10 am. 

 TENNIS: Mini junior meet at DKS complex.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Couldnt reschedule my marriage: Mahela 

 - It has been a long innings with Cristina 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mahela Jayawardene 

Mohali: Its unusual to desert the team on tour and rush home to get married, but Sri Lankan vice-captain Mahela Jayawardene cant be blamed for not being available for the fourth ODI, in Pune, on November 3. 

Till the dates got revised, we were to have been in India from November 7, which is why my wedding (to Cristina) was scheduled for November 3. However, owing to a number of reasons, I couldnt reschedule it, he told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Interacting briefly over breakfast at the Taj Chandigarh, Mahela revealed hed been going steady for six years and it was time to move to the next stage. Well, yes, it has been a long innings, he quipped. 

Cristina, who works in a Colombo-based travel agency, will be in India when the Sri Lankans return for a three-Test series in early-December.

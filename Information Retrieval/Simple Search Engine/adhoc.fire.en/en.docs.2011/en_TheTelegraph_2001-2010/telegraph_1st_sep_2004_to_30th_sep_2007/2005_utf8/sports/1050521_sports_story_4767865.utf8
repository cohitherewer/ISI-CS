 United, Arsenal in grudge tie

London: Manchester United and Arsenal players will be looking to settle a few scores in what could be a particularly ill-tempered FA Cup final on Saturday. United captain Roy Keane has already warned it could be an explosive meeting in Cardiff when his holders take on an Arsenal side hungry for revenge. 

United have beaten Arsenal 2-0 at home and 4-2 away in the Premier League this season, while the two clubs have traded blows for more than two years in the FA Cup. 

Arsenals last competitive victory over United in February 2003 was a big step towards winning the Cup for the second year in a row. 

More important than the statistics, though, will be the personal battles at the Millennium Stadium and notably Keanes tussle in midfield with Arsenal skipper Patrick Vieira. 

The pair have traded crunching tackles and spats for many years and recently broadened the front into barbed newspaper comments about each others World Cup loyalties. 

There was an acrimonious exchange in the players tunnel before Februarys 4-2 win and Vieira has said he is ready for anything from the Irishman in Cardiff. 

Significantly, the pair were the most booked players of their respective clubs in the league season just ended, with Keane collecting 11 yellow cards and Vieira nine. 

Left-back Ashley Coles best game in an England shirt was the muzzling job he did on Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo at Euro 2004, while the Portuguese responded by scoring twice at Highbury in February.

 Caffeine may be put back on banned list

 Gregan claims caffeine gave him a seven per cent boost 

Sydney: The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will consider restoring caffeine to its list of banned substances after Australian Rugby Union captain George Gregan said he used it to enhance his performance. 

WADA director general David Howman on Wednesday said reports that Gregan and other Australian athletes were using caffeine to boost performance were disturbing. 

Although there is no suggestion that anyone has broken the rules, WADA director-general David Howman said the agency was alarmed at the increasing use among Australian athletes. 

Thats troubling, that disturbs us, Howman told reporters on Wednesday. The only laboratory in the world that indicates a little bit of a worrying trend, is the one in Australia. 

It was a substance that we thought wasnt being abused and wasnt being used for performance enhancing (because) you had to have at least 12 cups of coffee to get over the level or start swallowing tablets. 

Howman said the issue had already been discussed by the WADA executive board and caffeines status would be reviewed later this year. 

We will put it back to our list committee, they are at the present considering what should or should not be on the list for 2006, he said. 

They will consider not only the information from an anecdotal point of view but also from the material theyve collected this year from the laboratories and well make a decision whether to put it back on the list. 

Gregan said on Tuesday that he and some of his teammates had been using caffeine tablets before big matches ? with the knowledge and approval of Australian sports authorities ? since caffeine was removed from WADAs list of banned substances in January 2004. 

He claimed the caffeine could improve performance by up to seven per cent, attributing his statistics to research done by the Australian Institute of Sport. 

AIS director Peter Fricker said Gregans figures on caffeine were inflated, saying any boost would be in the region of three per cent. 

WADA chairman Dick Pound said caffeine had been taken off the banned list because studies suggested it had no performance-enhancement effect. 

Several top Australian Rules Football players have also admitted using caffeine tablets after getting approval from their clubs. (AGENCIES)

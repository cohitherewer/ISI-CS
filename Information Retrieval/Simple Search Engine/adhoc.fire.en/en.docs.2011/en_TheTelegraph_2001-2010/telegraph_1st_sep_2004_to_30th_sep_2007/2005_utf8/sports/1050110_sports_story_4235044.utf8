The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I?ve moved on in life... realised the world is bigger than I thought it was?

 - Sporting legend Steve Waugh to visit Calcutta with a delegation of businessmen next month 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Steve Waugh being carried by Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer after his farewell Test at 

the Sydney Cricket Ground last January 

Melbourne: More grey hair is visible but, otherwise, Steve Waugh looks fit to make a comeback. In town as coach of the ICC XI for Monday?s tsunami fund-raiser at the MCG, cricket?s Elder Statesman spoke to The Telegraph over two sessions on Sunday. 

The following are excerpts: 

 On associating himself (as a selector and coach) 

 with the tsunami fund-raisers 

 I got a couple of calls and, really, didn?t 

 think twice about lending a hand for an excellent cause. 

 On his role as coach 

 (Laughs) It seems easy here... I just want 

 to sit back and enjoy what should be a high quality of cricket. 

 Of course, it?s nice that my CV now has an addition! 

 On whether, in years to come, coaching will 

 be an option 

 If it?s going to be as easy as this, yes... 

 Actually, more than coaching, I would prefer mentoring. 

 On the rather relaxed build-up to the first 

 fund-raiser 

 I expected it... Look, more than who wins, 

 the players are focussed on putting up a good show. After 

 all, a sell-out crowd deserves nothing less. One must also 

 remember there are few opportunities for the greats to perform 

 together on one day. 

 On the fund-raisers getting ODI status 

 Could have been a tough call for the ICC... 

 Now, I expect the Super Series (in October) to get similar 

 recognition. (After a pause) Even if the fund-raisers weren?t 

 ODIs, there would have been enough competition out of respect 

 for the people for whom money is being raised. 

 On whether he is associating himself with other 

 tsunami-related work 

 I?ve already told our Prime Minister (John 

 Howard) that I?m available... If something crops up, I?ll 

 be game... I understand the Calcutta Girls? Foundation, 

 an organisation I?ve been associated with, intends doing 

 something in South India. However, I don?t have details. 

 On whether he is returning to the MCG for the 

 first time after retirement (last January) 

 Yes... Indeed, except for two hours at 

 the SCG during a New South Wales game, I haven?t gone to 

 a cricket ground... Haven?t picked up a bat... Haven?t watched 

 anything live... 

 On what has kept him busy 

 I?ve spent much time interviewing top sportspersons 

 (including Cathy Freeman, Pat Rafter and Michael Clarke) 

 and entertainers (singer Shannon Noll, for example) for 

 a DVD that?s going to be distributed across all 11,000 schools 

 in Australia... Then, I?m still working on my latest book... 

 I?m writing fast, but there?s lots to write. I hadn?t realised 

 so much happened in my career. 

 [The DVD, incidentally, has ?Follow your Dreams? as 

 its theme and a deal has been struck with the federal education 

 department. The DVD, though, won?t be available off the 

 shelf. As of now, its release is slated for next month.] 

 On whether he is missing cricket 

 My love hasn?t diminished, but I don?t 

 miss the sport... But, yes, it did feel strange when I left 

 home this morning to board a flight for a match I wouldn?t 

 be playing. Having said that, the game has (and will remain) 

 greater than any individual... I?ve moved on in life and 

 realised the world is bigger than I thought it was. 

 On how long did it take to accept he was a former 

 player 

 (Grins) That acceptance came the very next 

 morning ? January 7, 2004... I was prepared to be an ex-player. 

 On which form of the sport he would pay to watch 

 Test cricket. 

 On whether he expected Australia to win the 

 recent series in India so convincingly 

 I expected it to be close... The (Sachin) 

 Tendulkar-factor made a big difference... I don?t think 

 the Indians anticipated the extent to which he would be 

 missed (in the first two Tests). Even when he made a comeback, 

 he wasn?t fit... The Indians did win the last Test, in Mumbai, 

 but lacked a bit of self-belief. Talent alone isn?t ever 

 enough. 

 On whether, mentally, the Australians gave it 

 away in the ?dead? last Test 

 No... However, 106 should have been chased. 

 The wicket was diabolical, but... 

 On whether he felt relieved ? owing to the ?Last 

 Frontier? hype ? when the series was clinched in Nagpur 

 Absolutely... I got emotional... 

 On how he expects the 2005 Ashes to unfold 

 Oh, it?s some time away... It appears it?s 

 going to be tight, though. 

 On his next trip to Calcutta 

 Early next month, with 

 a delegation of businessmen. I?ll also use that opportunity 

 to catch up with Udayan and the project for underprivileged 

 girls.

 Finally, on the biggest 

 moment of his fantastic career 

 (Emotionally, after a pause) My Test debut 

 at the MCG (against India, 1985-86).

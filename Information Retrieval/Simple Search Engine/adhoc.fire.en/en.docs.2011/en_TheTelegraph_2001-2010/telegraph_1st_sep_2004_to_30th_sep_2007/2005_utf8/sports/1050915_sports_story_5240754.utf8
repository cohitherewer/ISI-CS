The two Pakistanis ? Javed Inayat and Matloob Rana ? who created minor flutter on the opening day, fizzled out with cards of one-over 73 each but remained in contention along with overnight leader Mukesh Kumar who had a disappointing day returning four-over 76 for the day. 

 The trio shared the fourth spot at 143.As many as 63 pros made it to the money-making rounds after the cut was applied at 12-over par 156. (PTI)

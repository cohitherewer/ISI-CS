Budapest: Narain Karthikeyan, preparing for the tough Hungarian Grand Prix, had an unimpressive outing Friday finishing 18th and 22nd in the two practice sessions at the Hungaroring circuit under testing conditions. 

The Indian, who has set a goal for himself to finish the Sundays race quite like he did in Germany last week, registered the best time ? 1 minute 26.130 seconds ? by a rookie in the first session with the track temperature reaching as high as 50 degrees. 

Karthikeyan, running on the track for the first time, improved on his timing to 1:25.184 in the second practice on a dirty and dusty surface but still finished behind the likes of his Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro and Christijan Albers of Minardi. 

The track here in Hungary is quite difficult for newcomers, as you have a lot of corners, chicanes and bumps. Therefore, you have to do as many laps as possible and this is what I tried to do, said Karthikeyan, who did 14 and 25 laps respectively. 

I will sleep on it tonight and see how I can drive tomorrow. I will also have to sort out some handling issues for tomorrow but I am pretty confident, Karthikeyan said. 

The day belonged to two test drivers with Alexander Wurz of McLaren-Mercedez and Toyotas Ricardo Zonta claming the honours, respectively. 

A late flyer by Zonta gave him the fastest time of the day, 1:20.409, and McLaren counterpart Wurz followed into second, a tenth down. Kimi Raikkonen was the fastest of the race drivers coming third in his McLaren.

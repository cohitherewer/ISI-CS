 Unfit Cairns left out 

 - NEW ZEALAND TOUR OF SOUTH AFRICA 

Sydney: Veteran allrounder Chris Cairns has been left out of the New Zealand one-day squad announced on Monday for a five-match series against South Africa. 

James Franklin has been brought in as his replacement. 

Coach John Bracewell, however, said the dropping of the 35-year-old for the series starting on October 23 did not signal an end to Cairnss International career. 

Chris Cairns was not selected due to issues with his cricket fitness, Bracewell said. I have met with Chris to discuss his non-selection, and what is required for him to play his way back into the side. 

He is focused on playing in the World Cup (in 2007) and will have plenty of opportunity to return to form and full match fitness over the domestic season. He will be considered for a return to International cricket later in the summer. 

Off spinner Jeetan Patel, who made his first senior appearance on the recent tour of Zimbabwe, retained his place in the squad. 

Jeetan Patel showed good progress in his first tour in Zimbabwe, Bracewell said. He provides a second spin bowling option and is good in the field. He is a long term investment and deserves to be retained for a second tour. 

New Zealand would tour with 15 players to allow them to experiment with tactics involving substitute players, Bracewell said. 

The Black Caps play a Twenty20 match in Johannesburg on October 21 before five one-dayers that finish in Pretoria on November 6. 

They then return to New Zealand for a three-match one-day series against Australia in December, and will head back to South Africa for a three-match Test series in April 2006.

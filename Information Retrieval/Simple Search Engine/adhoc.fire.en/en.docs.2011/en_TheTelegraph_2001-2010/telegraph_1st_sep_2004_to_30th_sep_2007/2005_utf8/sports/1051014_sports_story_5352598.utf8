Sydney: Dennis Lillee has strong views about Ricky Pontings leadership, but the Australian captain is smart. The heat, clearly, is well and truly being felt by the World XI even before the first-ever officially sanctioned Super Test gets underway at the rather romantic SCG. 

In any case, the 0-3 scoreline in the Johnnie Walker Super Series-launching ODIs, in Melbourne, hasnt earned the World XI any admirers. Even coach John Wright questioned his wards commitment. 

Merely looking at the quality of the players, the World XI start favourites, Ponting declared at a pre-Test interaction on Thursday afternoon. He did add: Of course, we have the players to challenge them, but the quality-bit added the weight of the Harbour Bridge to the visitors pressures. 

Poor Graeme Smith. 

First, the Ian Chappells criticised his selection as the World XI Test captain. Then, according to The Telegraphs sources, others on the thinktank left it to him alone to determine who must sit out. 

Shoaib Akhtar is under the weather (I think Im down with a viral) and out of reckoning. So, from the remaining XII, Smith may have to choose between compatriot Shaun Pollock and a specialist batsman. Being a six-day affair, both specialist spinners ? Muttiah Muralidharan and Daniel Vettori ? should play. 

Its going to be his toughest call. 

There could be a controversy over somebodys exclusion, which is why the captain has been advised to pick the XI he will be most comfortable with, one of the sources pointed out. 

One expects Smith to have a sleepless night. 

He has, by the way, accepted that getting the best out of those he doesnt know well at all is his greatest challenge. 

A team cant be built overnight and Im not here to make things rosy... Weve got to start with the belief that were equals and can beat Australia... But, yes, one cant have a national team environment and the passion cant be similar... Whatever, Im looking for a hundred per cent effort and intensity, Smith said. 

 The odds really are against Smith: He even has to worry about the fields that ought to be set for Murali and Vettori ? after all, he isnt used to handling such high quality spinners. 

Also, theres a question mark over gloveman Mark Bouchers ability to pick Murali. Kumar Sangakkara did duty in the ODIs, but hes home now. 

On paper, the World XI is formidable with a capital F, but its unlikely that the Super Tests outcome is going to be influenced by the odd spark of brilliance or one innovative move. Plus, the six-day factor cant be discounted, even though rain may curtail play on Days 1 and 2 (dedicated to raising funds for Asias earthquake victims). 

Incidentally, the last scheduled six-day Test was way back in 1977-78, featuring England and New Zealand in Auckland. Even that many days couldnt produce a decisive result. More unique is that only once before (in 2003-04) has the SCG hosted a Test in October. 

I dont think the strategies will change because of the additional day... However, one has to bat longer... The extra day, I assume, is to eliminate a stalemate, Ponting remarked. What he didnt highlight is that the spinners are expected to have a bigger than traditional role to play. 

Despite being delighted with the wins in Melbourne, Ponting acknowledged that too much cant be taken out of a series when its switch-over time from one form to the other. 

Every game is an opportunity to improve... There were big moments in the (recent) Ashes when we let ourselves down... The areas which needed to be addressed, have been... There wasnt anything wrong with the individual preparations, we were just a bit off team-wise, he observed. 

Perfectly understandably, Ponting declined to speak at length about his counterpart: I dont know him well enough and its hard to sit in judgement. He enjoys the respect of the South African players and Im sure its going to be the same in the World XI dressing room. 

The Indians in the Super Series, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag, were far from super in Melbourne. Perhaps, the SCG will inspire ? 21 months ago, Dravid had an unbeaten 91 in his last Test innings here. Sehwag has already promised to score big. 

If he and the rest fire, that can be more ammunition for Lillee.

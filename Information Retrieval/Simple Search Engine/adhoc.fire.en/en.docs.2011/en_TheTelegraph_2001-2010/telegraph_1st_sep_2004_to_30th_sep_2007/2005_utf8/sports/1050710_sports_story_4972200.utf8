 London: It was a reversal 

 of roles as Harbhajan Singh wielded the willow and Sourav 

 Ganguly swung the ball to great effect in the County Championship 

 on Saturday. 

Harbhajan hammered a 95-ball 84 including 11 fours and three sixes as Surrey posted 603 against Gloucestershire in Bristol. The offie returned to dismiss James Pearson as Gloucestershire ended the day on 221 for six. 

 In Nottingham, Sourav claimed three for 68 in Nottinghamshires 

 425. Nottinghamshire were cruising at 268 for three before 

 Sourav removes Stephen Fleming (78) and Australian David 

 Hussey (81). Trailing by 158, Glamorgan were 107 for four

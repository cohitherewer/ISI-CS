Gros Islet (St Lucia): West Indies slumped to their eighth successive one-day defeat, going down to Pakistan by 40 runs in the second one-day International at the Beausejour Stadium here on Saturday. 

It is the first time Pakistan have defeated the West Indies in a one-day series in the Caribbean, although they won a triangular competition in 2000 involving Zimbabwe. 

The home side, chasing a victory target of 259, were bowled out for 218 in 48.2 overs. 

Shahid Afridi returned figures of four for 38, including a double-wicket maiden in his sixth over as Pakistan took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match contest. 

We are playing our best cricket for a while, vice-captain Younis Khan said. 

I think the tough tours to Australia and India have helped us gel as a team and believe in ourselves. Those tours were a turning point for us. 

The defeat equalled the longest losing streak for the West Indies, who were also beaten in eight consecutive games in 1999-2000. 

Chris Gayle gave the hosts a good start with a breezy 43 from 45 balls before he was bowled by seamer Shabbir Ahmed with a delivery that pitched outside leg stump and jagged to hit off. 

Earlier, Pakistans total was built around a knock of 51 by captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, another 51 from Shoaib Malik and 48 by Younis.

 Maharashtra-Bengal tie today

Kochi: Slushy conditions prevailing at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here following rains over the last two days forced organisers to postpone Mondays matches and reschedule the quarter final league fixtures in the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy. 

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, tournament commissioner B. N. G. Neogi said the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu and Assam-Goa matches, scheduled for Monday, had been postponed owing to unplayable ground conditions. 

He said a meeting of team managers convened had also decided to play the Assam-Goa and Uttar Pradesh-delhi matches on Tuesday. 

The Maharashtra-Bengal and Karnataka-Tamil Nadu matches would be played Tuesday evening at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, he said.

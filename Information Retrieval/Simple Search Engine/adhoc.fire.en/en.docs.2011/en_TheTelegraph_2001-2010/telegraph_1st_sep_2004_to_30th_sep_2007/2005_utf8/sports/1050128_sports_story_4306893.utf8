The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Bengal humble Vasco

 Bhaichung Bhutia scored after 15 matches 

Margao: Defending champions East Bengal warded off a second half challenge from Vasco Sports Club to score a convincing 3-0 win in the fourth round of the ninth National Football League match on Thursday. 

The Calcutta giants, who dominated the first half, took the lead in the 31st minute through Selwyn Fernandes. 

Climax Lawrence doubled the lead in the 74th minute with a back header off a flag-kick by Chandan Das. Bhaichung Bhutia then made the issue safe in injury time. 

It was a long wait for the star striker ? 273 days and 15 matches before he found the net. He had last scored in the 3-0 win over Indian Bank in the eighth edition of the National League at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

East Bengal, who registered their second win in the ninth edition, now have eight points from four matches. While Vasco, who suffered their third defeat have just one point from four matches. East Bengal, who had Vasco under pressure before the break, had a clear chance in the 13th minute when Shylo Malsawmtluanga intercepted a back pass from Agnelo Colaco, beat onrushing goalkeeper Ramos but drove the ball wide in front of an empty net. 

Ramos again came into the picture two minutes later and this time he tipped the ball over off a free kick taken by Douglas da Silva. East Bengal surged ahead after Bhutia initiated the move from the middle. He relayed the ball to Malsawma who found Selwyn. The overlapping defender got the better of Nicolau Colaco and send a firm grounder past ?keeper Ramos. 

Vasco went all out in search for an equaliser in the dying minutes of the first half, but Sushant Mathew?s shot missed the target narrowly. They Goans were also unlucky when referee B.K. Singh denied Vasco a penalty after Rahim Nabi tripped Sidney Rodrigues inside the box. 

After the change of ends, Vasco midfield co-ordinated well and their Brazilian duo of Sidney Rodrigues and Fabio Xavier made forays at regular intervals. Twice East Bengal ?keeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar was forced to bring diving saves off Fabio and Kamal Thapa. (PTI)

 Olympiakos, Panionios penalised

Athens: Olympiakos Piraeus and Panionios have had points docked and been heavily fined following crowd violence in which 14 policemen were hospitalised and forced cancellation of their Greek first division match on Sunday. 

After a two-day disciplinary hearing which was interrupted by a bomb hoax, the judges docked both clubs three points and ruled that Panionios? home match would not be replayed. 

Olympiakos were also fined 300,000 euros and Panionios 100,000 euros while both teams face the prospect of playing their next four home games behind closed doors. 

The penalties are due to come into effect in seven days, although the two sides are expected to appeal. 

Two men arrested during Sunday?s violence were given a five-month suspended sentence and ordered to report to their local police station before and after each match.

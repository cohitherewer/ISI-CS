 Pak beat India to share series

Lahore: Pakistan put up a memorable performance to defeat India 3-0 in the third and final football match here this evening to end the series 1-1 (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

Mohammad Essa, who had denied India victory in the series opener in Quetta, struck for the home side as early as the third minute and former captain Tanveer Ahmed put the icing on an excellent first half when he tapped the ball into the net in the 44rd minute. 

Pakistan then made a sensational start to the second half when Arif Mahmood scored in the 15th second after the break and though the home team continued to mount the pressure on the Indians in the remaining time, failed to earn any more goals. 

This was Pakistans third ever win over the traditional rivals in nearly 57 years. 

It also helped them share the trophy and cash award of Rs 200,000 besides pocketing the cash incentive of Rs 500,000 announced by the PFF president Faisal Saleh Hayat.

Mumbai: Sania Mirza, who became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, aims to crack the world?s top-50 by the end of the year. 

?Before the Australian Open, my goal was to break into the top-100, but this performance has given me a lot of confidence. 

?My aim now is to get into the top-50 before the end of 2005,? Sania said on arrival at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Terminal here on Sunday. 

Thanking her family members, coaches and the public for their support, she said she wanted to be an inspiration for youngsters and would love to see them come up like her. 

?There are a lot of talented youngsters in our country and I would like to inspire them to do well on the international stage,? Sania said. 

Right now, the 18-year-old wants to spend a few days at home. ?I would like to rest for a while and then decide about the tournaments I would be playing. 

?But for now I would just like to spend some time with my family.? 

Sania had got an entry into the main draw of the year?s first Grand Slam courtesy a wild card for winning the Asian championship. 

She beat local girl Cindy Watson in three sets in the first round before whipping world No. 80 Petra Mandula in the second round. In round 3, she played a fine second set versus Serena Williams before bowing out. (PTI)

 Rafael Nadal masters Coria

 - Paes-Zimonjic champions 

Monte Carlo: Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal swept aside defending champion Guillermo Coria 6-3, 6-1, 0-6, 7-5 to win the Monte Carlo Masters on Sunday. 

The doubles crown was bagged by Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic. The fifth-seeded Indo-Serbian pair got a walkover from Bryan twins Bob and Mike as the latter suffered a shoulder injury. 

This was Paes? 32nd career doubles title, and his second with Zimonjic. 

The singles final saw 18-year-old Nadal playing near-perfect claycourt tennis for three sets, becoming the youngest winner of a Masters Series title since Michael Chang in Toronto 15 years ago. 

His victory in three hours seven minutes means Nadal will move to second in the ATP Champions Race, with only Roger Federer standing above him. Argentine sixth seed Coria was appearing in his third successive Monte Carlo final and he started confidently, braeking Nadal?s serve in the opening game. 

The Spaniard then caught fire, surging back to give his more experienced opponent the run-around and take a two-set lead. 

Hitting his forehand with fizzing topspin Nadal dominated the rallies from the baseline, dragging one of the fastest players in the men?s game all over the court. 

With light drizzle falling on the court Coria looked forlorn at times against the raging Spaniard, but he refused to relinquish his title without fight.

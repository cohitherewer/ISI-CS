 Sourav can come back, says Kapil 

 Kapil Dev 

New Delhi: Legendary allrounder Kapil Dev on Thursday warned that too many experiments with team composition and strategy could have an adverse impact on Team Indias performance. 

Changes are good when they are made in small doses... Too much experimentation could leave the team vulnerable and it may not know what hit them when things go against them, Kapil told reporters here. 

The most important thing is to continue winning as it is a very good habit to have and instils confidence in the side, the legend said. 

Expressing happiness at the series win over Sri Lanka, he said the important thing now was to preserve the winning momentum. 

Rahul Dravid has led the side well and has responded to the added responsibility in a positive manner. Not only has his personal form been good, but he has also succeeded in getting the best out of the other members of the side, Kapil said on the sidelines of a function where he was appointed the brand ambassador of the Special Olympics movement. 

However, he said that it was too early to pass a judgement on Dravids leadership. 

He has led the side with passion and maturity but he needs to continue winning matches for India. 

Referring to the continued absence of Sourav Ganguly from the squad, Kapil said the Bengal left-hander needed to work harder to make a comeback. He is a determined and stubborn cricketer and can definitely come back if he is ready for the challenge, the former captain said. 

However, it is a good sign that seniors like Sourav and Zaheer Khan are struggling to find a place in the side.

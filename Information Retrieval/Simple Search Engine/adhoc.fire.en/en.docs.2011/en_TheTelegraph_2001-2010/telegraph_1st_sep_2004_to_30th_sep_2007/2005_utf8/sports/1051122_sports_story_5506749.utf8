 Too early to give Greg credit: Kapil

 - I wouldnt like to see Sourav begging for a place

Calcutta: India under Greg Chappell are shining, but Kapil Dev feels it is too early to give credit to the Australian for the show. According to the legendary allrounder, consistency over a longer period of time is what identifies a team, and the current one under Chappell is yet to achieve it. 

Its good to see the team performing well as a unit, winning a (one-day) series 6-1 and being full of confidence. But Im not going to give too much credit to Chappell. The fruits of his actions will be seen in two years time and not today. 

And dont forget, its Sourav Ganguly who built this team. Probably at the end of next year, well be in a better position to judge the boys, Kapil told a news conference at a city hotel on Monday. 

He, however, is against the idea of split captaincy. If a player can perform and is assured of a place in both forms of the game, he should lead, remarked the World Cup winning captain, who is in the city on a promotional tour. 

But wasnt Sourav the leader in helping Team India claim the Test-series in Zimbabwe ? a first outside the subcontinent in 19 years ? only a few months back? 

The former allrounder said, its past and we should concentrate on what is best for the country today. 

Kapil, however, believes Sourav is too strong to leave the field without a challenge. 

I wouldnt like to see Sourav begging for a place in the team. I like him for his arrogance and hes a strong character. But he must perform (in domestic cricket), stand up, fight for his place and make himself counted. 

That is how I know him. Look at how many times (Mohinder) Amarnath came back after being dropped. Sourav should be solid in his mind and prove his detractors wrong. Its true Bengal is missing him more than me. But dont you miss me, Sunil Gavaskar and others? We dont need to give Sourav any support. Hes strong enough to take care of himself. 

Way back in 1984, when Kapil was dropped from the side, the Eden had raised the no-Kapil-no-Test slogan. With the same venue set to host the fourth ODI between India and South Africa on Friday, a slogan on similar lines is also being raised now. 

Kapil, however, doesnt wish to compare his case with Souravs. 

As he observed: I dont think any Board politics are involved in Souravs case. Speaking about myself, well, I was happy with the way I had finished my career. I might have felt at that time that I had still some cricket left in me, but it was ultimately the selectors call.

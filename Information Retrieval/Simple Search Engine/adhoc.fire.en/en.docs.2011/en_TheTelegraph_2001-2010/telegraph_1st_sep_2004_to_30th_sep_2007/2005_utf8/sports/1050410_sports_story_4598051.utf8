Calcutta: Indian Oil?s 2-2 draw with Corps of Signals in group A and Army XI?s 4-1 hammering of Bombay XI confirmed the two teams? berth in the semi-finals of the 110th Beighton Cup meet here on Saturday. Indian Oil have five points, while the Armymen have six points. 

In a fine group B turnaround, Punjab Police swamped Tamil Nadu XI 6-1, Satwinder Singh scoring a hattrick. That pushed the policemen a step away from confirming their semi-final berth. Only if they lose by seven goals to Army XI on Sunday, will they be out. In that case Bombay XI (on three points and a goal differential of ?3) will make it. That is a very long shot. 

BSF (Jalandhar), with four points, need just a draw versus Karnataka XI on Sunday to make it through to the last four. Karnataka have one point, and they have to win by more than two goals on Sunday to pip BSF to the semis. 

Only after Sunday?s matches will the semi-final line-ups be clear. 

At the Mohammedan Sporting ground on Saturday, Army XI were actually in the red by the sixth minute as Rashid Ali put Bombay ahead through a field goal. The Armymen settled down soon enough, and skipper Ignace Tirkey equalised in the 31st minute. 

Suresh Kumar pushed home a stroke in the 52nd minute and Chandrasekhar Xalco converted a penalty corner in the 62nd minute to seal the issue. 

At the CC amp;FC, Punjab Police were ahead by the sixth minute through Jagbir Singh?s penalty corner conversion. Skipper Harmik Singh added another through a penalty corner in the 21st minute. Then came the Satwinder hattrick (30, 43 and 70), all field goals, with just a 50th-minute Heartlin James Anythyavab reverse interfering. Avtar Singh?s 61st-minute field goal was the last nail in the Tamil Nadu coffin. 

In the second match at the CC amp;FC, Nabin Lakra?s (Corps of Signals) fifth-minute penalty corner conversion was neutralised by Kamlesh Kumar of Indian Oil next minute. Rajesh Kumar put Signals back in the lead in the 30th minute and Kamlesh ?scored? again in the 37th. 

That goal, though, was contested and cancelled when it was found that it had been kicked in. Kamlesh made amends in the 40th minute, converting a penalty corner.

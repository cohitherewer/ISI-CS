Carson: After a string of fine performances, Sania Mirzas luck ran out with her first round exit in the $585,000 WTA JP Morgan Chase Open at Carson in Los Angeles. 

Sania, who is suffering from a stomach muscle pull, gave a tough fight by stretching the match to three sets before losing 3-6, 6-1, 4-6 against Iveta Benesova of Czech Repulblic. 

Benesova, ranked 51, has wins against the likes of Elena Jankovic (No. 18), Nicole Vaidisova (27), Shuai Peng (32) and Nuria Llagostera-Vives (44), this year. 

Sania has opted out of Rogers Cup to be held in Canada next week to be in proper condition before the US Open beginning on August 29. 

Meanwhile, Russian top seed Maria Sharapova shook off the rust of five weeks away from the court to overcome a frustrated Maria Kirilenko 7-6, 6-2 in the second round. 

Playing her first tour match since losing to Venus Williams in the semi-finals at Wimbledon, an erratic Sharapova mixed pinpoint accuracy on her booming groundstroke with a string of errors forced by her speedy and creative compatriot. 

There was a lot of rustiness, said the world No. 2, who had received a bye into the second round. First matches are always tough. You work in practice but then go out and competing is totally different. You just have to go out there and shake it all off. 

In other second-round matches, Klara Koukalova of the Czech Republic beat American Amy Frazier 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 and Varvara Lepchenko of Uzbekistan beat Silvija Talaja of Croatia 6-4, 6-2. (agencies)

 Records tumble as Lara smashes 156

 - TRI-SERIES 

 - 58-run win over Pak takes WI to second place 

 Brian Lara en route to his 156 on Friday 

Adelaide: Brian Lara returned to top form on Friday, hitting an imperious 156 to lead the West Indies to a 58-run win over Pakistan in a tri-series tie at the Adelaide Oval. 

Lara?s 138-ball innings lifted the West Indies to a record 339 for four ? the highest score recorded by any team in an ODI here. It was Lara?s 19th ODI century. 

Pakistan made a respectable 281 for nine in reply, batting through their 50 overs, but never approached the onerous winning run-rate. 

The win took the West Indies into second place with nine points, behind Australia with 26 and ahead of Pakistan who took a bonus point to move to seven. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq won the toss and sent the West Indies in on a pitch freshened by recent rain and there was enough early movement for the bowlers to make batting difficult. 

Chris Gayle and Ricardo Powell fell cheaply before Lara put on 197 for the fourth wicket with Shivnarine Chanderpaul (85) to see the West Indies through the most dangerous period before fully launching his assault. The West Indies were 177 for two after 35 overs, scoring at barely five runs and over and looked like struggling to reach 250. Lara?s onslaught changed everything. 

It was Lara?s second century against Pakistan and the biggest of his four 100-plus ODI knocks in Australia. 

Pakistan?s reply was steady but there was no one to match Lara. Yousuf Youhana scored 45, Abdul Razzaq made 44, Mohammad Hafeez 41 and Azhar Mahmood 40. 

Pakistan need to win one of their two remaining matches to overtake the West Indies for a place in the final. They play Australia in Perth on Sunday then the West Indies two days later. (AP)

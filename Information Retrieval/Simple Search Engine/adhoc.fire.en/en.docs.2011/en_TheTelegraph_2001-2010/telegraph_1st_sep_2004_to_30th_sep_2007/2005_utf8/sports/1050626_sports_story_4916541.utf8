Manchester: Andrew Symonds claimed a career-best five for 18 as Australia took their revenge by crushing Bangladesh by 10 wickets in Saturdays triangular series one-day match. 

The world champions, who lost to Bangladesh a week ago in one of the greatest upsets in the games history, made a nonsense of that aberration as they dismissed their opponents for 139, and then, raced home with 31 overs to spare. 

Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden both made 66 while Symonds got his second Man-of-the-Match award in a row. 

Were starting to get in our full stride now, said allrounder Symonds. We are close to our best. 

Bangladesh, put in, had collapsed from 113 for two in the 24th over at Old Trafford to be dismissed in 35.2 overs, losing their last eight wickets for 26 in just under 12 overs. 

Symonds, bowling off spin rather than his medium-pacers and finding significant turn, took his wickets in 7.2 overs while wrist spinner Brad Hogg took three for 29. 

Australia lost their first two games of the tournament but have rebounded with two victories. 

The spinners did the job, captain Ricky Ponting said. Theres still a bit of untidiness in our bowling at the start but otherwise everything is going in the right direction 

Mohammed Ashraful, who made 58, and Shahriar Nafees, who made 47 ? the only Bangladesh batsmen to get past five ? had resurrected the innings with a 90-run stand after Brett Lee had taken two early wickets. 

The 20-year-old Ashraful became only the second Bangladeshi to score a century in his last game against Australia, before making a lightning 94 against England. He looked set for a repetition, hitting 20 off the 11th over from Lee, including two sixes off the top edge. 

But Hogg and Symonds then strangled the scoring rate after the Bangladeshis looked well placed on 97 for two after 20 overs. 

Symonds, who began the tournament with a two-game ban for staying out all night before Australias opening game but who then scored 73 against England at Chester-le-Street, yorked Nafees as he shaped to sweep to make it 113 for three. 

Next ball he had captain Habibul Bashar caught behind off a straight ball for a golden duck. 

He then bowled Aftab Ahmed as the batsman played across the line to his leg and removed Ashraful by diving to his right and taking a one-hand catch off his own bowling. He wrapped up the innings by bowling Mohammed Rafique for a duck. 

Gilchrist and Hayden quickly underlined the gulf in class. The pair hit out after reaching 25 without loss after five overs. Hayden clobbered seamer Nazmul Hossain for four fours in an over, passing 4,000 ODI runs in the process, as the ball disappeared to mid-wicket, square leg and past the bowler.

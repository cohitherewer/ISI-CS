The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Days best by Arjun Singh

Beijing :Arjun Singh carded a six-under 66, the best score of the day, to move to tied 14th. He thus brought himself in reckoning for at least a top-10 finish in the $300,000 Volkswagen Masters China here on Saturday. Arjuns performance of the day was the best among the nine Indians left in the field. 

Meanwhile, South African Retief Goosen scrambled to a one-under-par 71 to retain his overnight one-shot edge over Michael Campbell of New Zealand. 

Arjun, who began with three birdies in the first four holes, had another three on back nine, moving up from 44th to 14th. 

Ashok Kumar, another Indian, also fared well with a front nine of 30. He ended with a card of five-under 67, moving from cut line to tied 30th. The day also went well for Gaurav Ghei and Shiv Kapur. Ghei climbed from 44th to tied 20th with a third round of four-under 68, including a back nine of 31 with five birdies. Kapur, fighting fever, had a bogey on the 17th, but still managed to bring in a three-under 69 that helped him join Ghei in tied 20th place at four-under 212. 

Harmeet Kahlon lost his way on the back nine with three bogeys and just one birdie which saw him finish the day with a par round of 72. He is now in tied 18th place. (PTI)

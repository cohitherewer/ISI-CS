 London: Striker Robbie Keane has been ruled out of Ireland?s squad for Wednesday?s World Cup group IV qualifier in the Faroe Islands by a shoulder injury. Keane picked up the injury in Saturday?s 2-2 home draw with Israel, during which he scored Ireland?s second goal. Medical experts decided on Monday he would not recover in time, the Football Association of Ireland said.

 The striker, Ireland?s all-time top scorer with 25 goals, is one of three players who will be unavailable in Torshavn. Steve Finnan, who missed Saturday?s game with a calf problem, has withdrawn from the squad, while fellow defender Andy O?Brien is suspended after a red card against Israel.

 London: Germany?s FSV Mainz and a Danish club were awarded places in next season?s Uefa Cup following the Fair Play draw by European soccer?s ruling body on Sunday.

 Sweden?s Hammarby, Tulevik Viljandi of Estonia, England?s Tottenham Hotspur and Young Boys of Switzerland were also in the draw made at halftime in the opening game of the women?s European championship between England and Finland in Manchester. The Danish club will be confirmed when their season ends on June 19. Norwegian side Viking FK had already been handed a place in the Uefa Cup after Norway finished top of the Fair Play league. 

 Piacenza: Empoli won promotion to Italy?s Serie A when a 1-1 home draw with Arezzo on Sunday secured a return to the top flight after a year?s absence.

 Genoa, looking to get back among the big clubs after 10 years in the second division, were left frustrated, however, after a 2-2 draw at Piacenza meant they must wait until the final day of the season to see if they can gain promotion. Two teams are automatically promoted from Serie B and Empoli lead on 74 points, with Genoa on 73, and Torino and Perugia on 71.

 London: Tottenham Hotspur manager Martin Jol has brushed off the suspension of director of football Frank Arnesen and believes the club must move on. Tottenham suspended Arnesen on Saturday, saying English champions Chelsea had made an approach to the Dane without their permission.

 Arnesen, the former Denmark international who joined Spurs in May 2004 and brought Jol to White Hart Lane after the departure of Jacques Santini in November, has told the club he wants to join Chelsea.

 The champions, fined 300,000 pounds ($545,300) and given a suspended three-point deduction last week for an illegal approach to Arsenal defender Ashley Cole, say they have acted within the rules.

 Mugello: After just five of 17 rounds, MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi is already well on his way to claiming a fifth world title in the premier class.

 Victory at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday gave the Yamaha rider 120 points, 49 ahead of nearest challenger Marco Melandri.

 It is easily the biggest lead at this stage of the season since the current scoring system was introduced in 1993.

 Seemingly, only injury or an uncharacteristic series of errors can derail Rossi.

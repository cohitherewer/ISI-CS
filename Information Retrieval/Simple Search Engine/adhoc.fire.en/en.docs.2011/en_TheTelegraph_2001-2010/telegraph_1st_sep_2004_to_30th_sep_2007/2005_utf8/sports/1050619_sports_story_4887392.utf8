 Mushtaq Ali is no more

 Indore: Former India captain 

 Mushtaq Ali, who helped set the record for most runs in 

 a days play in Tests, died on Saturday. The oldest 

 Test batsman and Padma Shri-winner, famous for his daredevil 

 approach towards fast bowlers, passed away in his sleep 

 a few months short of his 91st birthday. 

A tall and flamboyant opening batsman, Ali played 11 Tests over 18 years after making his debut against England in 1933-34 as a left-arm spin bowler. 

 He became the first Indian batsman to score a Test 

 hundred abroad, against England at Old Trafford in 1936, 

 an effort which helped set a record 588 runs amassed in 

 a single day. Openers Ali and Vijay Merchant piled up 190 

 runs after England had amassed 398 runs earlier in the day 

 before declaring their innings at 571 for eight. 

 Born on December 17, 1914 in Indore, 

 Mushtaq made his India debut at 19 as a left-arm spin bowler 

 in the 1933-34 season in Calcutta against the touring England 

 side. Mushtaq was the last surviving member of Indias 

 first-ever full cricket Test team to tour overseas to England 

 in 1936. Mushtaqlast played for India in 

 1948, and is survived by two sons and two daughters. The 

 nation honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1964 while Wisden 

 recognised his contribution to the game by conferring 

 a special award. 

 Later, Ali was laid to rest at 

 Luniapura graveyard with state honours in the presence of 

 family members and the cricketing fraternity. A tie, commemorating 

 the platinum jubilee celebration of the BCCI reached his 

 residence, Ali Manzil, a little before the burial.

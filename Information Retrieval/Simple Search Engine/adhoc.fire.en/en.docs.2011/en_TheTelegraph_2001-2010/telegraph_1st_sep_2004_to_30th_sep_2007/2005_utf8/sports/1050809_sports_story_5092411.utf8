 Ponting heaps praise on Flintoff

 - Australians not up against the same old England anymore 

MATTHEW PRYOR

 Most nerve-wracking Test Ive played, says Ponting 

Australia will be saying many things as they head up the M6 to Manchester, but same old England will not be one of them. It was certainly not the same old Australia, who have made a virtue of rescuing themselves when in a tight corner. 

Its right up there, its probably the most nerve-racking end to a Test match that Ive played in, Ricky Ponting, the Australia captain, said. We had a great win against Pakistan down in Hobart. Gilly [Adam Gilchrist] basically got us home there when we were out of the game. But this is up there with any game Ive played in and thats including tied World Cup semi-finals. 

It was obviously very tense in our dressing-room. I was talking to Michael [Vaughan] at the presentation and he said for the whole game he had his players coming and giving him advice, but for the last half an hour not one was coming near him, so I think things were pretty tense out there as well. 

There were some private mutterings about Michael Kasprowicz not being out at the end, after replays appeared to show that the glove the ball struck on its way to Geraint Jones had already come away from the bat. 

The Australian press was half-jokingly saying that they were stitched up by Billy Bowden, the umpire, who is from New Zealand. 

Kasprowicz, whose dismissal saw Australia lose the match by two runs, said: I will probably leave Edgbaston with the most vivid memory that I will replay in my mind for the rest of my life. 

Theres maybe a sense of pride, but initially theres disappointment. In a lot of ways its cruel to get that close and just miss out in the end. Kasprowicz played in the match only after Glenn McGrath was injured just before the start. It was a dramatic end to an enthralling game that levelled the five-match series before the third Test at Old Trafford on Thursday. 

But Steve Bernard, the Australia manager, said: The decision [by Bowden] was made in the game and its not our position to question those decisions. 

Ponting proved himself a magnanimous loser by paying tribute to England and particularly Andrew Flintoff. At the start of the tour, Ponting said that Flintoff was the one England player who would stand a chance of getting in the Australia squad. 

Hes done OK. Hes not a bad player at all, Ponting joked. Weve known about his talents for a long time. He did a great job yesterday (Sunday) to bat on with his shoulder and then the spell of bowling last night (Sunday), especially when I went in, was very, very good. Hes a terrific player and England have got a few of those guys in their side now. 

Ponting said that he made the wrong choice by putting in England after winning the toss. He said that the overcast conditions on Thursday morning had swayed him rather than any desire to back his new bowling attack after Glenn McGrath had pulled out with his late injury. 

Also, I expected there to be a bit of moisture under the surface, he added. It was quite hard on top, but I thought there would be a little bit underneath it. As I said to some of the guys, if it had been a really sunny day on Thursday then the decision might have been different. 

I think our first innings was pretty poor on that wicket, we had to make more than 300 in our first innings. I guess our bowling on the first day wasnt that great, either. But Im actually pretty proud of how weve played over the last couple of days. 

Theres probably a couple of batters, Kasper [Michael Kasprowicz] and Brett [Lee] who feel pretty shattered. But all the guys have [had it ] made clear to them were really happy with what theyve done under intense pressure. THE TIMES, LONDON

Sydney: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has thrown his support behind beleaguered captain Sourav Ganguly and said he hoped the public row between him and coach Greg Chappell was now over. 

The rift became public during the recent Zimbabwe tour when Sourav told the media, without naming Chappell, that there had been a suggestion for him to step down in favour of an in-form batsman. 

A confidential e-mail from Greg Chappell to Board officials, subsequently leaked to the media, said Sourav was no longer fit to lead the side. 

The pair agreed to a truce after a meeting with a six-man review committee, including Gavaskar, in Mumbai. 

We hope it wont crop up again, said Gavaskar, who is here as team director of the ICC World XI to play Australia in three one-dayers and a Test match over the next fortnight. 

Indias got a pretty busy season (this year), weve got 12 one-dayers ? seven against Sri Lanka, five against the South Africans, and then Sri Lanka come back (for a three-Test series). 

Its a busy season and were hoping that everything will be okay. I know its not always easy when youve had a public spat. 

But both are mature people and having spoken to them, the committee believes that they will put their misconceptions behind them and go forward. 

The former India captain also said he did not believe Sourav had any problems dealing with other players in the team. 

Gavaskar said Chappell and Sourav had both accepted they might have stepped out of line just a bit and would try to work together to take Indian cricket forward.

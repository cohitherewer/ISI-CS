 Daniel, Aman lift 2 trophies 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Racing returned from the monsoon track to the winter strip on Thursday as grass on the main course appeared to have grown thick and fast in a weeks time. It, however, left the racing fraternity pondering whether it was a miracle or the RCTC manueverings.

 Racing, nevertheless, was hardly a fun as favourites fell one after another to the delight of satchelmen who have been at the receiving end since the season got underway three weeks ago,

 The chief contributor to the bookies cause was jockey C.Alford, whose poor start on the two heavily backed runners ? Serrafina and Santarelle ? in the RWITC Cup and the BOL Publication Cup, respectively, helped apprentice Amandeep Singh and trainer Daniel David to cash in on less fancied winners Noble Flash and Wayward King. Daniels Russian Valour had won earlier on.

 Ferrari feeling the pressure

 - New car may be used in Bahrain

Sepang: After one of the most dominant seasons in Formula One history, Ferrari are feeling the pressure. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher left steamy Malaysia on Sunday knowing the heat will still be on when he reports for his first test of Ferrari?s new F2005 car in Italy this week. 

Ferrari, winners of 15 of last year?s 18 races, have now gone three grands prix without a win and Sunday?s race at Sepang was the first since Hungary in August 2003 without one of their drivers on the podium. 

Renault have run away with the first two races of 2005 while Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya ended 2004 with a victory for Williams in Brazil. Schumacher, after failing to finish in Australia, was seventh at Sepang while teammate Rubens Barrichello retired. 

?There can be no excuses after a race like this,? said team boss Jean Todt. ?We were beaten by opponents who proved to be stronger than us.? 

Spaniard Fernando Alonso?s win on Sunday makes it more likely that Ferrari will press their new car into service for next month?s third round in Bahrain rather than waiting as planned for Spain in May. Even then, it may not be the immediate world beater, the F2004 ? modified for use in the first few races of this season ? proved to be last year. 

?The question is how good the new Ferrari will be,? said Germany?s Nick Heidfeld after finishing third for Williams on Sunday. 

?There is no question at the moment the gap with Renault is very big,? said Schumacher on Sunday. ?If after five or six races we are still struggling then we won?t have to bother talking about the championship. 

?I can see how it?s hard to understand how we won 15 races last season and coming here we are fighting for seventh,? added the German, who has two points to Alonso?s 16. ?But things can turn around very, very fast. 

?I don?t expect a giant leap in Bahrain. It?s clear we must improve,? he added. (Reuters)

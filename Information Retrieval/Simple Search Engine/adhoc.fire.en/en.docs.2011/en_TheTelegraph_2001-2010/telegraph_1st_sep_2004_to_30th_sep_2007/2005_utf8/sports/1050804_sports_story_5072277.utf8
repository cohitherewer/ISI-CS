 Greg Chappell recalls Colombo showdown

 - I wasnt surprised when Arjuna emerged an outstanding leader 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Dambulla: Greg Chappell was in his penultimate season of international cricket and Arjuna Ranatunga a feisty teenager when they faced each other for the first time, on Australias 1982-83 tour of Sri Lanka. 

No pleasantries were exchanged and Ranatunga was indifferent to the Australian captains iconic image. On Wednesday, though, they greeted each other most affectionately at the Team India hotel. 

Chappell and Ranatunga spoke for a couple of minutes and, later, the former told The Telegraph that their showdown during one of the two ODIs at the P. Sara Stadium (Colombo) seemed to have taken place much longer than 22 years ago. 

Recalling the incident, Chappell said: I cant remember whether it was the first or second ODI, but Arjuna made some remark when an appeal was turned down. I asked whats your problem? His icy response ? You play your game, old man ? took me by surprise. 

That showdown suggested Arjuna would be somebody to watch out for... That he was a mentally tough bloke willing to take on an opposition captain... Obviously, even then, he wasnt overawed by reputations. 

Chappell added: So, I certainly wasnt surprised when Arjuna emerged an outstanding leader... Indeed, the qualities were evident back in that series... Im sure hes also going to be successful in the career (politics) he has now chosen. 

Ranatunga, one learns, was particularly keen on Chappell coaching Sri Lanka. However, he opted for India.

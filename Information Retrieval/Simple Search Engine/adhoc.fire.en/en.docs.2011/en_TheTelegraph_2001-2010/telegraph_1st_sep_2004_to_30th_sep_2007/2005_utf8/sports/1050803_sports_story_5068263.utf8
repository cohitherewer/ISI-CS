 Akram thumbs up for India left-armers

 - Last seasons failures will make Irfan Pathan stronger 

 Akram says the trio of left-arm seamers is Indias best bowlers now 

New Delhi: Indias strategy of playing three left-arm seamers has earned the approval of none other than sultan of swing Wasim Akram who says the trios talent justified their inclusion in the squad. 

India are fielding Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Irfan Pathan in the ongoing tri-series in Sri Lanka with an eye on the 2007 World Cup. 

Akram, who holds the unique distinction of taking more than 400 wickets in both versions of the game, sees no reason why India should not use their talent in left-arm bowling department to maximum returns. 

The three (left-arm seamers) are looking good. They are bowling well and are the teams three best bowlers, so the Indian thinktank is right in fielding all three, the former Pakistan skipper said in a telephonic interview. 

Akram, now a commentator, had kind words for Pathan. 

Pathan is good, as I have always said. He did not bowl well last season but success and failure are part of the game. He tasted success early and the failures of last season would have made him strong. He must have learnt to take both success and failure in his stride. 

Criticising those who wrote off Pathan, Akram said: People who have never played for their country, or played just one or two games tend to pass such judgements. They think if they say something positive, none will listen to them, so they resort to such gimmicks. Even in Pakistan, people look for an opportunity to pull someone down. 

As far as Pathan is concerned, give him 3-4 years? He is just 21. Negative criticism can be demoralising for a youngster, Akram said. 

Unlike current captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Akram feels the skipper should be blamed for a teams slow over-rate. 

Definitely the captain should be blamed. If he takes credit for the teams success, he should also be ready to take responsibility for defeat as well as issues like slow over rates. 

I have been the captain and I think it is right to penalise the leader. 

Akram was also critical of boards raising hue and cry over the security factor during tours. 

For once I agree with Javedbhai (Javed Miandad). Our cricket boards ought to be stronger, once we have promised foolproof security, there is no point in bowing down to the pressure tactics of visiting teams. 

Look at Australia? had they been playing in Pakistan now instead of England and there was to be a bomb blast, they would have disappeared within a couple of hours, Akram said. 

Slamming the latest practice of sending security experts prior to tours, Akram said: These security guys have good fun, the trip is like a paid holiday for them. 

As far as Im concerned, the security issue should be left to the governments, they are very much capable of handling these issues.

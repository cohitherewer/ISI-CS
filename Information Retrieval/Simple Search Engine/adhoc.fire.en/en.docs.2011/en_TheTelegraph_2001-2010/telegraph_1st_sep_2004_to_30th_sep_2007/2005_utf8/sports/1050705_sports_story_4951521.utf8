The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 This EB squad looks fitter: McKnight

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengals British physical trainer Peter McKnight feels Subhas Bhowmicks squad for the upcoming season looks fitter than last years and stresses on year-long conditioning camp for Debjit Ghosh and Co. 

The Britisher also feels that a residential camp will come in handy for the red-and-gold brigades bid to shine in the domestic and international arena. 

McKnight, who had trained the squad last season as well, joined the boys at the club ground on Monday. He will have a six-week stint with the club. 

This squad looks in good shape? I think, fitter than last years, McKnight said after overseeing the boys on his first day. Last year, I saw the players a bit sluggish. These guys look more energetic, he added. 

I have plans to introduce some new methods. A proper training schedule will also be drawn up after discussing some points with the coach, the Englishman maintained. 

He informed that the players will undergo an endurance test on Wednesday and thereafter, each player will be provided with training charts. 

Bhowmick, meanwhile, supervised the proceedings briefly, despite suffering high temperature. In all, 21 players joined the practice and according to a club official, the rest is expected to arrive within Wednesday. 

Mohun Bagan also kicked off their practice at Salt Lakes Bidhannagar Municipality ground with 11 players. Coach Amal Dutta had Basudeb Mondal and his teammates encamped at the ground itself as players could leave for home after training. 

Mohommedan Sporting, on the other hand, would be getting a new set of jerseys from their Dhaka counterparts for the forthcoming season. 

Coach Biswajit Bhattacharya, meanwhile, believes that new sensation Juber will be allowed to play for his team, despite his case forwarded to the AIFF players status committee.

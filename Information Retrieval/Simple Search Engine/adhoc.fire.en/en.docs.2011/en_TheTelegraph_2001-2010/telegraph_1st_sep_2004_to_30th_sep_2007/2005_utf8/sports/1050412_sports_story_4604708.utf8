 Gupta closer to IM title

Dubai: Abhijit Gupta gave yet another inspired performance to hold GM Pavel Kotsur of Kazakhstan in the seventh round of the Dubai Open chess meet here, getting a step closer to his third and final International Master (IM) norm. 

The 15-year-old, who had some very tough games in the competition so far, took his tally to 4.5 points out of a possible seven and appears all set to become the youngest IM of the country. 

In the eighth and penultimate round, the Bhilwara-based teenager will face compatriot GM Abhijit Kunte. 

The other IM norm hopefuls, 12-year old Parimarjan Negi and G. Rohit, 15, also remained on track, though both failed to earn full points from their respective boards. 

Negi played a fine game to hold GM Mikheil Mchedlishvili of Georgia but Rohit went down to GM Al-Modaihki Mohamad of Qatar. 

Both Indian youngsters have now an identical score of four points and require two draws in their remaining games against quality opposition to achieve the feat. 

At the top, overnight leaders Ashot Anastasian of Armenia and Georgians Georgi Kacheishvili and Merab Gagunashvili were joined by Chinese duo of Zhang Pengxiang and Zhang Zhong on 5.5 points following another spate of draws on higher boards. 

A group of 15, including top seed Alexander Motylev, were on the heels of the leaders with five points each. (PTI)

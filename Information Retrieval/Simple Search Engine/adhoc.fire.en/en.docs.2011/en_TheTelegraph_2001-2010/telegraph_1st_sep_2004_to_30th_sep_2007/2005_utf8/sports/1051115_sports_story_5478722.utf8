 Neelam files submission

New Delhi: Discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh, provisionally suspended for a positive dope test at the World Athletics Championships this year, on Monday filed her written submission to the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) panel hearing her case. 

Sushil Salwan, her counsel, sent the written submission to the four-member panel hearing the doping charges against her. 

I sent my written submission in Neelams defence today to the panel chairman Walter Davaram (president of the Tamil Nadu Amateur Athletics Federation), Salwan said. 

Neelam had appeared before the panel which asked her to present her arguments in writing. 

Salwan refused to divulge the specific arguments he has made in Neelams defence. 

He said that the panel could ask him to appear in person again if it needed any clarifications before arriving at a decision. 

It is up to the panel now, Salwan, who headed the enquiry into the Sunita Rani case after she tested positive at the 2002 Busan Asian Games, said. The AFI panel hearing on Neelams case is headed by Davaram and comprises Adille Sumariwala, G. S. Randhawa and Girish Tyagi. 

The panel was expected to submit its report to the AFI in little over a week, one of the panellists said. 

We will have one or two sittings of the panel to discuss the case once we receive Neelams arguments in writing, Tyagi, secretary of the Delhi Medical Association, said. (PTI)

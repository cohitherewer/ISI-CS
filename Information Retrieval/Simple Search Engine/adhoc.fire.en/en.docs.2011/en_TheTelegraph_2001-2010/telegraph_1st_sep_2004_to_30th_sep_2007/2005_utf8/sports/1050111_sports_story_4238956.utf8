Melbourne: The ICC XI captain Ricky Ponting stroked a superb 115 to lead his side to a comprehensive 112-run win over Asia in Monday?s fund-raiser for victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami. 

International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed announced after the game that $11 million had been raised on the day for the tsunami appeal. 

Man-of-the-Match Ponting was in sparkling touch, hitting eight fours and three sixes in a game played before a sell-out crowd of 70,101 at Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns smashed 69 from 47 balls and West Indies captain Brian Lara scored an effortless 52 for the ICC XI. Sri Lanka off spinner Muttiah Muralidharan took three wickets for 59 for Asia XI. 

In reply to the ICC XI?s 344 for eight, Asia XI scored 232 all out in 39.5 overs. 

 Rahul Dravid was unbeaten on 75 and his compatriot Virender Sehwag hit an aggressive 45 from 39 balls at the top of the order, including five fours and one six. 

Spinners Daniel Vettori of New Zealand (three for 58) and Australia?s Shane Warne (two for 27) took five wickets between them for the ICC XI. 

Watched by an estimated global television audience of one billion, the match was the first of a two-game series. 

Australia?s World Cup-winning captain Ponting and Test cricket?s world record holder Lara were two of the big name players the crowd came to see and the pair batted beautifully, adding 122 for the third wicket. 

Zaheer Khan had struck two early blows for Asia XI, removing openers Chris Gayle (1) and Adam Gilchrist (24), both caught behind by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara. 

Ponting and the hard-hitting Cairns shared a 91-run stand from 55 balls before the Australian was stumped off Kumble at 263 for four. 

Sangakkara gave a fine individual effort behind the stumps for Asia XI with three stumpings and two catches. 

Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, who could not play because of an elbow injury, made an appearance as a substitute fieldsman to the delight of the crowd, as did ICC XI coach and former Australia captain Steve Waugh. 

Sri Lanka?s Sanath Jayasuriya (28) and Sehwag put on 59 for the first wicket for Asia XI before Cairns had Jayasuriya caught at slip in the 10th over. Sehwag tried to smash Warne over mid-wicket in the 13th over and was caught in the deep by Gayle at 76 for two as Warne struck with his second ball of the match. 

Vettori made the key breakthrough of removing Asia XI captain Sourav Ganguly for 22, caught at mid-on by Darren Gough, and Warne claimed the wicket of Pakistan?s Yousuf Youhana (4) seven runs later at 114 for four.

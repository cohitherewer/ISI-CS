 Warne puts pressure on umpires: Arthur

 - I cant say if its wrong or right

Melbourne: South Africa coach Mickey Arthur acknowledged on Thursday that Australia, in general, and Shane Warne, in particular, were masters of putting pressure on the umpires. 

Warne took three wickets on the fourth day of the second Test as the visitors slumped to 99 for six in their second innings after being set 366 to win. 

Theyre masters at it, Arthur told a news conference. Especially Warney. He does put pressure on umpires. 

I cant say if thats right or wrong because if I had a guy like him Id also be putting pressure on umpires. 

I guess he has an aura about him. He is a world champion bowler. 

One appeal for a caught-behind of Ashwell Prince involved virtually the entire Australian side. Prince was given not out and television replays showed the ball had spun well past his bat. 

Arthur said he had no problem with wicketkeeper Mark Boucher walking after Ricky Ponting took a spectacular bat-pad catch. 

The entire Australian side appealed and began to congregate and congratulate each other in the middle of the pitch although umpire Asad Rauf had not given Boucher out, to Warnes visible annoyance. 

Boucher, however, walked and Arthur said it had been the right thing to do. 

Ive got no problem with that. Its within the spirit of the game, said Arthur. 

He thought it was an obvious deflection. There was a lot of appealing and histrionics going on and he hit it and he walked. Thats fine. 

Ive never instructed a player to stand or walk, thats a personal preference. He hit it. Good catch. And off he went.

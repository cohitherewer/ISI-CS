 Fifth title in succession for Rossi 

Sepang: Italian Valentino Rossi won the MotoGP world championship for the fifth year in a row on Sunday after finishing second in the Malaysian Grand Prix. 

Rossi finished the race with a tally of 281 points with just four rounds of the championship remaining. He, finishing behind compatriot Loris Capirossis Ducati, joins Giacomo Agostini and Mick Doohan as the only riders to have won the premier class of grand prix racing five times or more. 

Last year was more of a surprise, he said, explaining that his switch at the end of 2003 from Honda to Yamaha, then seen as the inferior bike, had lifted the burden of expectation in 2004. 

This year, all of the other riders want to beat me and try 100 percent, he told reporters after performing a victory lap in a helmet also painted with a large7. 

Rossi needed to finish within 12 points of Max Biaggi, another Italian, to take the championship. Biaggi, on a Honda, finished sixth. 

Spaniard Carlos Checa took third, giving Ducati two places on the podium and a boost for the manufacturers. Rossi said later that Capirossis Ducati was unassailable on a baking-hot Sepang circuit. 

However, Rossi is contracted to Yamaha only until the end of next season and has had two tests in a Formula One car with Ferrari this year, with more planned for next.

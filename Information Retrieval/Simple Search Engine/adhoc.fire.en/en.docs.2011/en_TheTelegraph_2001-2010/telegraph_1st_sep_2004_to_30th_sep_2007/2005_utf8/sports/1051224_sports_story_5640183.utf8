 Imran: Sourav captaincy played key role last year

 Imran Khan

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan said England underestimated Pakistan thereby losing both the Tests and one-day series, while the hosts performed better than expected. 

After beating a team like Australia in the Ashes, England underestimated the strength of the Pakistani team, Imran said. 

England came to Pakistan on the back of their Septembers Ashes win, their first in 18 years, but lost the three-Test series 2-0 and the following one-day series 3-2. 

Imran said captaincy plays a key role in any teams win. Captain is the key. Last year when India came to Pakistan they were led by a buoyant Sourav Ganguly who had done well on the previous tour of Australia, while Inzamam did not have the confidence of a captain, said Imran. 

India beat Pakistan 3-2 in the one-dayers and 2-1 in the Tests last year, their first series win in Pakistan since 1990. He said Inzamams captaincy against England this month was the main difference between the two sides.

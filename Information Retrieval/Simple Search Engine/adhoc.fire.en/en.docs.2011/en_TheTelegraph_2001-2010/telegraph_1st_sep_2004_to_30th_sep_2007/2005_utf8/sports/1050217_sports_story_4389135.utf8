The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mohun Bagan ask Beto to show cause 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan Wednesday initiated disciplinary proceedings against their Brazilian striker Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?. The club slapped a show-cause notice on the player for walking off the pitch and going home without the consent of authorities after he was substituted in the 37th minute of their National Football League match versus State Bank of Travancore at the Salt lake Stadium. 

Mohun Bagan assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury said: ?Beto has 48 hours to reply to the notice. Till such time he will not be allowed to practice. And disciplinary action will be taken against him if he fails to answer or if his answer remains unsatisfactory.? 

The notice has alleged ?unsporting behaviour? as a reason and has also made it clear that the player has acted in an extra-constitutional manner, ignoring club authority. 

?He has to understand, that for any acknowledgement, he has to perform. He has played a number of matches in the NFL? where are those goals?? asked Chowdhury. 

Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya did not want to comment on this issue, except saying that ?this is now a disciplinary issue.?

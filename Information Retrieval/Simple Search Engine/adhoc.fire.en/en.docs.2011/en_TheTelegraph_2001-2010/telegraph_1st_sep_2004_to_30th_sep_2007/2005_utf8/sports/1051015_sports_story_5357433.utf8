 Positives outweighed Nayeems negatives

 Nayeem

Hes too tough a taskmaster and gives the players absolutely no respite, hes very fussy with their eating habits, he forces them to closely cropped haircuts. On the face of it, some of Syed Nayeemuddins methods defy common logic and border on madness. The expert committee formed to interview the candidates and select the Indian football coach discussed all these factors before deciding that Nayeem, indeed, was the most suitable person.

 The committee, comprising Chuni Goswami, Derek DSouza, C. Viswanathan and myself, felt that Nayeems eccentricities were directly linked to his commitment to coaching. 

 Hes a strict disciplinarian who happens to think differently than others. For instance, he feels long hair can obstruct vision and come in the way of a footballer scoring a goal or defending his citadel. It may be a one-in-a-thousand possibility, but his logic is that it will still be a chance lost or chance gifted.

 All of us felt that Nayeem does all these for the welfare of the team he is in charge of, and not with any sinister motive. His attitude also impressed us. He said he genuinely believes in the methods he follows, but if we felt some of those werent right, he was willing to make some adjustments.

 Of course, Nayeem had several factors going in his favour ? coaching courses from Germany and Brazil, first recipient of the prestigious Dronacharya award in football, composure as player and coach, experience and success as coach of several clubs and national team. 

 Though he hadnt got a chance to coach the Indian team after the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games, he had great success in Bangladesh even last season. He guided Brothers Union to four titles and officials there felt he was in no way inferior to a foreign coach.

 In his presentation, Nayeem was very clear about how he wanted to take the Indian team forward. He stressed on the importance of a number of intensive camps that need not necessarily be of very long duration. 

 He gave equal weightage to foreign trips and exposure to competition with high-quality opposition. In the final analysis, Nayeems positives far outweighed his negatives.

 That, of course, doesnt mean Nayeem had an easy passage. Subrata Bhattacharyas presentation was just as impressive. He showed he was well-versed with modern techniques and thoughts. 

 He came across as a very confident and bold candidate who presented his views very unambiguously. He claimed he knew every leading player in the country well enough to judge who was capable of what. 

 Most importantly, he was aware that only performance counts and if he couldnt deliver in a reasonable period of time, he had to look for another job. 

 Last but not least, the AFC recognised Subrata by picking him as the coach of the month five years ago, when Mohun Bagan were riding the crest of a wave.

 Though Subrata lost out in the race to be national coach, he came a very close second. He did his cause no harm by the way he argued his case and Im convinced he can be entrusted the job sometime in the future.

 Subrata

 The surprise package was Manipurs Birbal Singh. Not many had heard of him before he applied for this post, but the fact is, he holds an AFC A licence in coaching and had been in charge of his state team which won the National Games crown. Thats not all. Birbal is a qualified sports psychologist having done his PhD on the subject.

 A psychologist is an integral part of any teams support staff these days. I know its a fairly new concept in Indian football, but if we are to take a step in the right direction, the AIFF has to build up a solid back-up team to support the coach. 

 Our brief was just to rate the coaches, but we have suggested to the national federation that the services of someone like Birbal could be used in other suitable capacity in any age-group.

 Never before has the national football coach been selected this way. A new beginning has been made, hopefully for the better. We have done our job as sincerely as we could. Only time will tell how Nayeem shapes up, but it certainly wont be easy for him to transform Indian football overnight.

 But as you all know by now, Im an eternal optimist. I dont think Nayeem will do an inferior job than Stephen Constantine.

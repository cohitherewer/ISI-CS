 Sethi falters in semis 

New Delhi: Geet Sethi was defeated 2-4 by second seed Joe Delaney of Ireland in the semi-final of the IBSF World Seniors Snooker Championships in Manama, Bahrain. 

Sethi, seeded three, was neck-to-neck with Delaney in the first four frames but the Irishman sealed the matter by pocketing consecutive wins in the fifth and sixth frames scoring a 44-51, 71-21, 41-51, 63-53, 51-53, 15-56 victory ending the Indians run for the title on Thursday. 

Former world billiards champion Sethi was one down after the first frame but he levelled the score by taking the second frame, which was also studded with a break of 47. Delaney won the third frame to take a 2-1 advantage but Sethi returned to take the fourth frame and restore the parity at 2-2. 

Delaney pocketed the black to take a 3-2 lead after the tension-filled fifth frame and also took control of the sixth frame to run away with the winner for a place in the final. 

Delaney will face Dean Kane of New Zealand overcame the challenge of Walid Hatim of Kuwait, beating him 4-3 (59-83, 69-20, 30-58, 74-48, 41-74, 83-74, 58-20) in the semi-final. (Pti)

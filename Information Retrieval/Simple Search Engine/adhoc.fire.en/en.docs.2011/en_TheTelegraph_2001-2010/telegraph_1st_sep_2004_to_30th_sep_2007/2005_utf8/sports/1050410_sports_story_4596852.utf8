The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bengal hope to derail Rlys

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal will be under no pressure when they face Ranji Trophy champions Railways in the national one-day meet in Mumbai on Sunday, says skipper Devang Gandhi. 

?They (Railways) emerged champions in the longer version of the game? this is limited overs cricket, a different ball game altogether,? Devang told The Telegraph over phone on Saturday night. 

The skipper felt his team had the ability to put it across Railways. ?We have a fit line-up and I believe they can do the job,? he said. 

Bengal?s Arindam Das is ruled out by a hairline fracture and will be replaced by Subhamoy Das. 

LIKELY TEAM 

Subhamoy Das, Sanjib Sanyal, Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tewari, Deep Dasgupta, Shib Sagar Singh, Sourashish Lahiri, Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose

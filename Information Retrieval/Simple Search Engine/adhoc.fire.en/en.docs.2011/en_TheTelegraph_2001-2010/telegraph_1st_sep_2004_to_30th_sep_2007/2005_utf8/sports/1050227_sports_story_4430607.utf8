The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chowrasia champion

Noida: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, who missed most of the 2004-05 PGAI Tour season due to wrist fracture, romped home to a convincing win at the Rs 10-lakh Padampat Singhania Open golf tournament on Saturday. 

The 26-year-old Chowrasia?s tally of eight-under 280, courtesy a final round 73, was six better than Rafiq Ali?s aggregate of 286 at the Noida golf course. 

Rafiq edged Kanpur pro Shiv Prakash on the final day, courtesy a round of 69. (PTI)

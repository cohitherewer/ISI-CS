 Perseverance, patience have paid off: Parthiv

 - Shortened run-up brought me success: Zaheer 

 Parthiv Patel 

Ahmedabad: Parthiv Patel, who was recalled to the Indian Test squad for the tour of Pakistan on Saturday, said he would make the most of the chance that has come his way. 

I am very happy. My patience and perseverance have finally paid off, the young wicketkeeper said from Surat where he would be playing in the Ranji Trophy match against Bengal starting Sunday. 

I have been working very hard since the last season, I have done well in the Challenger Series, Irani Trophy, Duleep Trophy and Ranji Trophy games, said Patel, who was dropped from Team India after a string of poor shows behind the stumps, including on the tour of Australia. 

I have got a chance and I will make the most of it, he added. 

Patel was on Saturday named as a back-up wicket-keeper to Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the 16-member squad which would be touring Pakistan early next year. The most memorable moment during last years Pakistan tour was when I made 69 runs as an stand-in opener in the Rawalpindi Test which we won, he said. 

Meanwhile, Zaheer Khan, who was also recalled to the Team India Test squad, said in Vadodara that a shortened run-up has helped him take a number of wickets in domestic cricket. 

I have shortened my bowling run-up and have got good results in domestic matches. I want to experiment with my shortened run-up at the international level too for the first time (on the tour of Pakistan), said the left-arm fast medium bowler. 

He is to play the Ranji Trophy Elite Division group B tie for Baroda against Punjab starting on Sunday. 

Zaheer, ignored by the national selectors for 12 ODIs and three Tests after the tour to Zimbabwe, said: The Indian team has been doing well. I will be very happy to be part of this team. 

The Baroda pacer has taken 111 wickets in 40 Tests. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No PCA invitation for Asif, Malik

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Asif Iqbal 

Chandigarh: The Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) hasn?t invited Asif Iqbal and Salim Malik, two former Pakistan captains tainted by allegations of match-fixing, to watch the first Test as guests. 

All the other surviving captains ? including Wasim Akram ? were sent invitations. It?s another matter that only Mushtaq Mohammed, Zaheer Abbas, Rameez Raja and Aamer Sohail (besides Punjab coach Intikhab Alam) have consented to be present. 

Nobody in the PCA wished to be quoted, but a top official confirmed that the reason for excluding Asif and Malik indeed was the match-fixing controversy of not too long ago. ?We didn?t want to attract any awkwardness,? he told The Telegraph. 

Incidentally, the PCA has also invited former heads of the Pakistan Cricket Board.

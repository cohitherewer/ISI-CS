The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhowmick wary of ?unpredictable? Tolly

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Even as East Bengal are attaching significant importance to their National Football League for ONGC Cup tie against Tollygunge Agragami on Friday, coach Subhas Bhowmick issued a veiled threat of not continuing with his job next season. 

Tollygunge?s ?unpredictable? nature has kept Bhowmick worried despite having blanked them 5-0 in the first leg. East Bengal, who have 30 points from 14 games, will be without Alvito D?Cunha, who has left for Goa. M. Suresh and Sangram Mukherjee will also miss the tie through injuries. 

Tollygunge officials, though, are sensing ?foul play? in Musah?s second yellow in their previous game and have show caused the former East Bengal captain. Amitava Chanda has also been asked to showcause for his irregular attendance at practice. Kabijit Khotel and Gour-anga Dutta are also on double booking. 

PTI adds from Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa thrashed Churchill Brothers 4-0 in their return match here to move to third place. 

Sporting struck after a barren first half through MoM Bibiano Fernandes (64th), Joseph Pereira (72nd, 74th) and Adebayo Adewusi (79th).

 Kallis doesn?t mind being called ?boring? 

Cape Town: South Africa batsman Jacques Kallis said he did not mind being called ?boring? after his side thrashed England by 196 runs in the third Test on Thursday. 

The win squared the five-match series at 1-1 with Kallis providing the backbone of South Africa?s batting since the first test in Port Elizabeth. 

England?s travelling fans, dubbed the Barmy Army, chanted ?boring, boring Kallis? as he worked his way to a patient 66 in the second innings as South Africa accumulated a huge lead. 

Kallis also hit 149 in the first innings. 

?As long as I keep boring them I?ll be happy,? Kallis said. ?It?s just a matter of summing up the match situation and playing according to that. 

?Sometimes there is a time when you can try and take the game away from the opposition and times when you have to grind it out.? 

In the three Tests so far Kallis has scored 448 runs in a little under 22 hours, including 215 runs at Newlands which took him 12 and a half hours. ?I am playing well at the moment and to continue that would be nice,? Kallis said. 

Captain Graeme Smith was full of praise for the right-hander. ?Jacques has been superb, I?m running out of things to say about him,? Smith said. ?As far as I?m concerned he is the best player in the world at the moment..? (Reuters)

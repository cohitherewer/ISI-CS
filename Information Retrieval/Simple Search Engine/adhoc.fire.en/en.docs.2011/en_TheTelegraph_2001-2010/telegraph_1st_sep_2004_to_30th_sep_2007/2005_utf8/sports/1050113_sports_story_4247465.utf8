The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Flintoff fit to bowl, Langeveldt may play

 - Fourth Test

 Plans afoot to break deadlock 

 Andrew Flintoff 

Johannesburg: While England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will be fit to bowl in the fourth Test against South Africa starting at the Wanderers on Thursday, South Africa are considering playing fast bowler Charl Langeveldt despite his fractured hand, skipper Graeme Smith said Wednesday. 

Flintoff suffered a side strain during the third Test in Cape Town last week and bowled for the first time during a middle practice Wednesday. ?Freddie is fine. He had a bowl in the middle and has been declared fully fit to take a full part in the Test,? England captain Michael Vaughan said Wednesday. 

?He is a crucial part of our team ? I thought he was our best bowler in Cape Town ? and at 1-1 in the series, missing Freddie would be a huge blow. He is a real big threat to the batsmen,? Vaughan said. 

Vaughan said he was looking forward to the special atmosphere of the Wanderers, which hosted the World Cup final in 2003, even though England?s last visit to South African cricket?s premier ground started disastrously and ended in an innings defeat in 1999-00. 

Vaughan, making his Test debut, came to the crease on the first morning with England on two for two and watched from the non-striker?s end as they plummeted further to two for four before he had faced a ball. But the Yorkshireman batted with great determination to survive through to the lunch break and ended with 33. 

?Nasser Hussain said afterwards that if I could play like that every time I would play 50 Tests and he was right.? 

Vaughan hinted that paceman James Anderson, unused in the first three Tests, would come strongly into contention for selection Thursday. ?He?s been pushing hard all tour and is swinging it and looking good in the nets. He?s making our life difficult when it comes to selection,? Vaughan said. 

Of his own poor form, an upbeat Vaughan said he had spent an intensive week working on his batting and was hopeful a big score was just around the corner. ?I?ve spent a lot of time in the nets this week and a lot of time talking with Duncan Fletcher about batting, and I certainly hope I?ve found the magic touch again.? 

England strike bowler Steve Harmison has also had an unsuccessful series but Vaughan was confident he would have an impact at the Wanderers. ?Steve?s obviously not hit his straps as he would have liked but the ball?s coming out nicely and I?m sure a match-winning spell from him is just around the corner,? Vaughan said. 

?As a team we haven?t played anywhere near our best cricket and intensity is our big word, the main thing, we?re taking into this game.? 

And regarding Langeveldt, Smith said: ?He?s not going to be 100 percent fit if the selectors do decide to pick him. The injury doesn?t affect his bowling and fielding, just his batting. I feel he added value to our bowling in Cape Town.? 

Langeveldt injured his left hand while batting in the third Test, his first match, but then took five for 46 after taking pain-killing injections. South Africa won by 196 runs to level the five-match series at 1-1. 

Smith added that Mark Boucher, recalled to the squad after missing South Africa?s last five Tests, was odds-on to replace Abraham de Villiers behind the stumps. ?It does look that way at the moment,? Smith said.

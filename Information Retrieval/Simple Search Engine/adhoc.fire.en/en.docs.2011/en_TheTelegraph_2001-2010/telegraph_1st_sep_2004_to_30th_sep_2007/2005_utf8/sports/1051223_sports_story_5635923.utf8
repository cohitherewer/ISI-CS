 Maradona held for creating trouble

Rio de Janeiro: Police arrested Diego Maradona at the Rio de Janeiro Airport on Thursday for causing disturbance after missing his flight to Buenos Aires. 

Police told Radio CBN that they intended to conduct an alcohol test on Argentinas 1986 World Cup hero. 

Maradona, vice-president of Boca Juniors, found himself in trouble after losing his cool over failing to make his plane back home, an agent reported. 

Maradona was in Brazil to take part in a charity match on Wednesday with Brazils former football star and now coach of Japan, Zico. 

According to the channel, Maradona had already ruffled feathers when announcing just before kick-off for the game in aid of Rios poor children that he wouldnt be playing. 

He finally turned up surrounded by a posse of bodyguards for the fixture at Zicos football school, which ended 4-4.

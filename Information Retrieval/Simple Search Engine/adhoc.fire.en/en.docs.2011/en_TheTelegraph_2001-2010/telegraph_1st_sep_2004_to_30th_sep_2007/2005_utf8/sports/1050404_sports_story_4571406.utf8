 Ferrari gamble fails to pay

 - I can?t blame anyone, says Schumacher

Manama (Bahrain): Michael Schumacher?s and Ferrari?s miserable start to the Formula One season continued on Sunday when the seven-time champion retired from the Bahrain Grand Prix. 

Schumacher, winner of 13 of last season?s 18 races, has now retired from two of the first three Grands Prix, with just two points to his credit. 

Ferrari took a gamble on rushing their new F2005 car into service in Bahrain, two races ahead of schedule, after their modified old car proved powerless to match Renault?s pacesetting Fernando Alonso in Malaysia. 

Despite Schumacher qualifying on front row and matching Alonso for the first 12 laps, his brakes appeared to lock up. 

?I think I picked up debris on the circuit following Fernando which may have caused some radiator to be broken,? Schumacher told TV reporters. 

?We were in good shape with the car. I?m quite confident. 

I can?t blame anyone. I think our strategy was absolutely the right strategy. 

It was just a piece of something that got into the car.?

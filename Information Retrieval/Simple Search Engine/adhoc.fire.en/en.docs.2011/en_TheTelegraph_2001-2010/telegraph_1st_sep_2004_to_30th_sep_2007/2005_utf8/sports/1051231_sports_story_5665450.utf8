 Ronaldo sidelined by calf injury

Madrid: Real Madrid and Brazil striker Ronaldo will be out of action for up to two weeks after suffering a calf injury, the club said in a statement on Friday. 

The diagnosis means the player is ruled out of Reals Kings Cup last-16 match against Athletic Bilbao on January 3 and is doubtful for the league game at Villareal five days later. 

Real are already without striker and captain Raul who suffered a serious knee injury in November. The clubs website reported that Raul ran for the first time in his rehabilitation at the training ground on Friday. 

Real have slipped to fifth in the Primera Liga, 11 points behind league leaders and arch-rivals Barcelona.

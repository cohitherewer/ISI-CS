The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Teams arrive

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India and South Africa players reached the city on Wednesday evening amid tight security, with the police being on their toes to thwart any untoward incident. 

Ajit Agarkar, who flew back to Mumbai after the third ODI in Chennai was washed out, will join the squad on Thursday morning. 

Incidentally, in a break from the tradition, both teams came out of the airport through the regular exit point and not the one, used by the VVIPs. The players also had a smooth run from the airport to the team hotel without facing any protest about Sourav Gangulys omission. 

While South Africans are scheduled to practise at the Eden on Thursday morning, the Indian counterparts will do their bit in the afternoon. 

The CAB, incidentally, is yet to think about felicitating Sachin Tendulkar on his record-breaking 357th match. A senior CAB official, however, didnt rule out the idea either. 

Meanwhile the police carried out an inspection at the stadium in the afternoon.

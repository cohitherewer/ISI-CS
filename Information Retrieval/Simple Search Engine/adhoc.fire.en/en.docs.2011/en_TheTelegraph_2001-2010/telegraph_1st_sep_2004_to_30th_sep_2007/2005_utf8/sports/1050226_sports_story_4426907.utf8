The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SA coast to 301

Johannesburg: South Africa scored 301 for seven in their 50 overs in the first one-day International against Zimbabwe on Friday. Top-order batsmen Graeme Smith, Adam Bacher and Jacques Rudolph all scored half-centuries. 

Zimbabwe won the toss and surprisingly sent South Africa in to bat and the hosts immediately laid the platform for a big total. Captain Graeme Smith scored 50 off 55 balls, while fellow opener Adam Bacher scored a career-best 56 off 73 deliveries. 

The duo put on 87 in 16.4 overs, before Smith fell in off-spinner Stuart Matsikenyeri?s first over, trapped leg-before. 

Bacher went 9.5 overs later, who produced an inspired spell, taking three for 40 in his 10 overs. 

Jacques Rudolph (50) and Herschelle Gibbs (40) shared a carefree stand of 56 for the third wicket at a run-a-ball. 

Mark Boucher and Albie Morkel gave a dazzling exhibition of late hitting and South Africa scored 104 runs in the last 10 overs. Boucher hit 49 off just 29 balls, with four fours and three sixes. Morkel scored 16 off six balls.

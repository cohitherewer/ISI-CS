 No substitute for experience, realise England

 - If super subs continue, a new type of cricketer will evolve: the bowler who never bats

 Flintoff, Harmison are cast iron, guaranteed 10-over bankers 

The anti-climactic end to Englands year of Test cricket could well be matched in the one-day game. On Saturday England begin a five-match series of day-night internationals ? or rather day-dusk internationals as they start at 11 am and only the two hours or so will be under floodlights ? when their lack of experienced bowling will make Pakistan favourites. 

Englands batting should be fine. Their batting now has the makings of a World Cup-winning line-up, especially if Ian Blackwell can take over the spinning role and make the runs to match his left-handed talent (Ive changed my lifestyle completely, Somersets new captain promised). Even though Michael Vaughan cannot conceivably be fit enough to fly back for this one-day series, the line-up of Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood and Geraint Jones is the strongest England have had since they reached the 1992 World Cup final. 

It is the bowling, which will have to be topped up before the next World Cup in only 15 months time. For the forthcoming series only Flintoff and Steve Harmison are cast-iron, guaranteed, 10-over bankers. Simon Jones, when he has recovered, may well take over the new ball from Darren Gough, but for the moment England have to hope that James Anderson starts his international rehab, and Liam Plunkett carries on from his impressive Test debut. 

If there is uncertainty over Englands bowling, there is even more over the format of one-day cricket, following the hasty introduction of power-plays and super-subs. These two experiments are due to run until next September ? but it was only by accident they were introduced in the first place. Inadvertently an ICC spokesman announced that power-plays and super-subs were going to be introduced before the ICC executive board had approved them: and it is understood that the executive board would have introduced one innovation or the other, but not both. 

Power-plays, since their introduction in July, seem to be a relatively harmless way of adding interest to a one-dayer. After the first 10 overs, during which all but two fielders must be inside the semi-circles, the fielding captain must chose two lots of five overs with the same restrictions. If you want to encourage attacking batting ? which is the object of the exercise ? it would be more logical to let the batting captain chose the two power-plays, but either way it is inoffensive tinkering. 

What is offensive to a lot of spectators, and not just old fogeys, are the super-subs who turn a one-day international into a 12-a-side match. There was a reason why 12-a-side cricket died out the best part of two centuries ago: it diluted the dramatic tension. You might as well add a ninth row to a chess board: the game would still be interesting, at least until the novelty wore off, but not half so interesting and dramatically tense as eight-row chess. 

The original idea of the ICC cricket committee when they came up with the proposal (which, insanely, was implemented without a single trial game of any kind) was that the super-sub would allow the batting captain to be more adventurous in the middle of a one-day innings: those tedious overs in which a flat off-spinner spears in six balls on leg stump which get worked away for three singles and a leg-bye. Bring in (dread phrase) an impact player, such as Matt Prior or Vikram Solanki in Englands current party, and he might have a go at clattering that flat off-spinner. 

It has not turned out like that. The only thing to be said for the super-sub is that he can save a day from total anti-climax when his side is sent in and collapse in bowling conditions. It happened at the Oval last summer when Australia reduced Englands top order to 93 for six wickets and Solanki was brought in to replace Simon Jones, making a fifty and enabling England to bat out their 50 overs. But it was still a hopelessly one-sided game, just a long drawn-out one rather than a brief one. 

There must also be the danger, if super-subs continue, that a new type of cricketer will evolve: the bowler who never bats. He could be a super-fast bowler who scares and hits people but never has to expose himself to the same dangers. That would violate the principles of fair play which are supposed to be at the heart of cricket. 

As organisations are loath to admit they have made a mistake, the ICC may decide to keep super-subs and make one change: to allow the captains to nominate their team after the toss, once they know whether they will be batting or fielding first. Thus if England bat first on Saturday, they could name Solanki in their starting XI, then replace him with Kabir Ali when they bowl. No, it still doesnt seem right. You might as well play 13-a-side or use as many players as you want. Or would you prefer to have two queens, or three rooks?

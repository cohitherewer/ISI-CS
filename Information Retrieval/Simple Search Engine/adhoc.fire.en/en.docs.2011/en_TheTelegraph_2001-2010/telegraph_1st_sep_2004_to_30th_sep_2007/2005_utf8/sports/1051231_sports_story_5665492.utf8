Karachi: Jaya Sharma produced a record-breaking century as India routed Pakistan by 193 runs in a womens Asia Cup match in Karachi on Friday. By virtue of this win, India made it two wins out of two. 

Jaya blasted the highest score by an Indian in one-day Internationals as India amassed an imposing 289 for 2. Pakistan failed to offer any sort of challenge as they were bundled out for a meagre 96. Indian spinners played a vital role in that Pak batting debacle. 

Jaya faced 150 balls and smashed 15 boundaries as the inexperienced Pakistan attack was taken to pieces. Her century overtook the previous record of unbeaten 114 by Mithali Raj, made against Ireland at Milton Keynes in 1999. Jaya added a mammoth 223 runs with Anjum Chopra, who also cracked a brilliant 86 off 112 balls. 

Faced with such a daunting total Pakistan were never likely to make much of an impression. The openers ? Tasqeen Qadeer and Sajjida Shah ? battled hard for a stand of 31 but once they were parted the middle and lower order slumped. 

The Indian spinners were superbly economical with Nooshin-al Khader conceding just seven runs in her 10 overs while Neetu David helped herself to three cheap wickets. 

BRIEF SCORES

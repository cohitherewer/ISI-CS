Harare: Mohammed Kaif slammed a sparkling century as Indias top order came out of a prolonged slump to fashion a convincing six-wicket victory over New Zealand in a crucial Videocon Cup tri-series match on Friday. 

Kaif notched up his second one-day International century as India overhauled New Zealands competitive 278 with 15 balls to spare, recording the highest-ever run chase at the Harare Sports Club. 

The win ensured Indias title face-off against the Black Caps on September 6. 

Kaif (102 not out) shared important partnerships with Rahul Dravid (39), Yuvraj Singh (22) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (37 not out) to ensure that India did not suffer from any hiccups. 

Indias next game against Zimbabwe on Sunday is of academic interest now. 

Kaif took 121 balls for his 102 with 11 fours, his second hundred in 95 games. His 101-run third wicket stand with Dravid was the cornerstone of Indias innings. 

Souravs boys achieved the target in a flourish in the end with Dhoni striking a flurry of fours and sixes to remain unbeaten on 37 off 27 balls with three fours and two sixes. 

Well as Kaif batted, the foundation for the mammoth chase was laid by openers Virender Sehwag (45) and Sourav Ganguly (19) who put on 66 runs from a mere seven-odd overs. 

Sehwag bludgeoned the Black Caps with a terrific knock, which took him only 34 balls and included six fours before a ball from Jacob Oram breached his defence in the 10th over. 

Sourav, for the second time in the series, had hooked for an on-side fielder to get involved. 

The momentum was not lost by the third wicket pair, especially Kaif who creamed many sweetly-driven fours on either side of the wicket. 

Kaifs half century came from only 54 balls with eight fours and as Dravid also took roots, New Zealand bowling wilted. 

Dravid departed in the 31st over, bowled by a sharp incoming delivery from Scott Styris, only the third time the Indian vice-captain has been bowled in the series. 

Earlier, New Zealand were pulled back from a definite 300-plus total by some good performance in the field by the Indians. 

Most of New Zealands thrust came in the initial and final overs with Stephen Fleming (47), Lou Vincent (37), Craig McMillan (40), Scott Styris (56) and Brenden McCullum (28) being the chief protagonists. 

Fielding, the bane of Indian cricket, was the highlight as two crisp run-outs of two rampaging batsmen completely turned the game on its head. 

Stephen Fleming (47 off 53 balls) and Lou Vincent (37 off 23 balls) had given New Zealand a blistering start before both fell to outstanding work in the field by the Indians.

 With Kimis mistake, pole was easy: Alonso

 - BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX 

 Alonso feels the weekend started in a big way 

Sao Paulo: Renaults Fernando Alonso took another huge step towards becoming Formula Ones youngest champion by seizing pole position for what could be a title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix. 

The 24-year-old Spaniard, who can secure the crown on Sunday with two races to spare if he finishes third or better, could only smile as McLarens Kimi Raikkonen made an error under pressure at the first corner and qualified fifth. 

With Kimis mistake, the pole was much easier for me, grinned Alonso after his fifth pole of the season. 

Raikkonen, 25 points behind Alonso, is the only man with a chance of keeping the Spaniards hands off the championship but his hopes look slim now. 

Alonso will line up alongside McLarens Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, race winner for Williams last year at Interlagos. 

Raikkonen was last to run in qualifying after winning the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks ago but a puff of smoke from a locked wheel under braking on his timed run betrayed the Finns error. 

The weekend has started in a good way, said Alonso. The car is competitive enough to be on the podium in all three races (to the end of the season). We have a perfect opportunity tomorrow. 

Renaults Italian Giancarlo Fisichella was third, another boost for Renault who are just six points ahead of McLaren in the constructors standings, with Briton Jenson Button a strong fourth for BAR. 

Raikkonen lines up alongside Austrian Christian Klien in a Red Bull. 

Japans Takuma Sato, in a BAR, did not complete a timed lap due to a 10-place penalty incurred after he collided with Ferraris seven-time champion Michael Schumacher in Belgium. 

Schumacher qualified seventh and starts alongside his future Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa in a Sauber. 

Tyre change 

Meanwhile, McLaren changed the front left tyre on Kimi Raikkonens car without penalty on Sunday that could hand Alonso the Formula One title. Drivers are supposed to complete the race on the same tyres they qualified with. 

However, team boss Ron Dennis said an exemption had been allowed following a mid-season rule change after tyre damage saw Raikkonen crash out of the European GP in May while leading. 

Raikkonen flat-spotted the tyre in qualifying at Interlagos when he braked late into a corner and locked the front wheel.

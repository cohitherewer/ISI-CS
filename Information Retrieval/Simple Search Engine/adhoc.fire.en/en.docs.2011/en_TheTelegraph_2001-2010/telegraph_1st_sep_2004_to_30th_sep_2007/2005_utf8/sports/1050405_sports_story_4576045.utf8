 Carrie eyes ?Grand? history

 London: Horses ridden by women dont win Grand Nationals, says Ginger McCain, trainer of last year?s winner Amberleigh House and the world famous Red Rum, three times trium-phant in the 1970s.

 Richard and Carrie Ford disagree. The husband and wife trainer and jockey team are set to give the worlds most challenging horse race their best shots when Forest Gunner, the 11-1 fourth favourite, lines up with 39 rivals at Aintree in Liverpool on Saturday.

 If they win, 32-year-old Carrie would be propelled into the record books as the first woman to capture the race in its 166-year history.

 ?To be fair its probably going to be the best chance a lady rider is going to have in the race ever,? Ford told the Aintree website.

 Women have raced the Grand National before, but none has realistically stood as good a chance as Forest Gunner whose Aintree claims are firmly in the form book after a series of eye-catching performances. Since Charlotte Brew became the first woman to ride in the race, on a 200-1 rank outsider in 1977, there have been 21 other attempts by women.

 Only two have completed the 4 1/2 mile (7.2 km) marathon with its 30 fences, Rosemary Henderson recording the best finish with fifth place on 100-1 shot Fiddlers Pike in 1994.

 Veteran McCain, a near neighbour and friend of the Fords, was typically forthright when asked recently about Carries chances.

 The 74-year-old declared: ?Carrie?s a grand lass but she is a broodmare now. Having kids doesnt get you fit to ride Grand Nationals.?

 Carrie, who raced to victory in last years Foxhunters Chase over the National fences just 10 weeks after giving birth to her daughter, is good humoured about McCains comments

 ?Ginger is a great guy. It?s very, very like him to say that. But I can understand people who dont know him thinking its outrageous,? she told The Daily Telegraph.

 Carrie had planned to retire after her Foxhunters win but was tempted back into the saddle when her National winning prospects became clear.

 Only pressure from high expectations and the media spotlight could sway the Cheshire-based team, who are new to the sort of attention their announcement to contest the National spurred. Forest Gunners nervous demeanour means the couple prefer to keep him away from too many interested parties. (REUTERS)

 Roberts: The atmosphere was fantastic

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: British referee Dave Roberts will return to Singapore with loads of happy experiences from the city after officiating the derby clash between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

This was a fantastic experience. It was hard to concentrate when so many people were shouting at the top of their voice. But I must give credit to the players who behaved professionally, played to the true spirit of the game and allowed me to enjoy the game, Roberts, who is currently associated with Singapore FA, said after the match. 

He, however, stuck to his decision of awarding the penalty against Mohun Bagan, saying Eduardo (Coelho) handled the ball while clearing it and was a clear penalty to me. 

He, however, insisted that when the ball struck Mehrajuddin Wadao, prompting East Bengal players to appeal for a penalty, it was not intentional and hence, he waved play-on. 

Roberts, however, had another interesting story to take home. When I was warming up, I heard whistles blowing from here and there across the stands. Eduardo came to me and requested whether I could blow the whistle a little louder. I jokingly told him, I hope you should concentrate on the game rather than on my whistle-blowing. 

The British referee, however, said he should not be dragged into any controversy following some of the local referees grudge over his appointment for the match. 

I understand every local referee should be keen on officiating this match under such a beautiful atmosphere. But I came here following a request from the IFA and Ive nothing to do with this, he said. 

Will you come back to officiate again? I dont know whether Ill get another opportunity. But Im planning to spend sometime here on a holiday, he said, smilingly.

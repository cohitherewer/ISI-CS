 Coral Gables set for hattrick 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Coral Gables, who is in rousing from, looks set for his third straight win when he takes on 10 rivals in the 1,400m Daisy Appoo B.T.C. Anniversary Cup here on Saturday.

 The L. DSilva-ward is maintaining his brilliant form and may be unstoppable in the hands of K.P.Appu. Spectacular Quest who did have the beating of him in the Chennai Super Mile, Lancaster, Gaslight and Crown Secret look best to offer resistance but unlikely to beat the Gables.

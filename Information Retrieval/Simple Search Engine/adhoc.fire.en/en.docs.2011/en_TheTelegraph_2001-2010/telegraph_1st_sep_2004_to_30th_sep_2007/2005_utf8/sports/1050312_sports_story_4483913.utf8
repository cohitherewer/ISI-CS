 Anand ends meet on a losing note

 - LINARES chess 

- Kasparov claims title despite going down to Topalov 

 Anand lost to Adams in trying to win at all costs and finished third 

Linares: Viswanathan Anand suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Michael Adams of England while world?s top-rated Garri Kaspaov of Russia won the title despite being upset by Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the 14th and final round of the Linares meet that concluded here. 

Both Topalov and overnight sole leader Kasparov scored an identical 8 points out of a possible 12 but the Russian was declared the winner of this edition by virtue of his more number of victories with black. 

As per Linares? tradition, a player scoring more number of victories is generally declared a winner in the event of a tie but since Topalov matched Kasparov?s four wins after his superlative triumph, the organisers had to consider the number of wins with black. 

Kasparov was clearly superior following his three victories with black pieces earlier in the event against local lad Francisco pons Vallejo and Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Adams. 

Topalov had just one win against Vallejo with black pieces. Topalov?s only loss came against Anand in Round II when he was tamed from a balanced position. 

Anand finished his campaign on a negative note after losing to Adams. 

As for Adams, it was a sweet revenge after he succumbed to a loss in his last encounter with the Indian which was the last round of the Corus tournament last month at Wijk Aan Zee. 

For the records, Anand finished third in the event tally with 6.5 points or a ?plus one? score, half a point ahead of Peter Leko of Hungary, who recorded the dubious distinction of drawing all his games in this year?s event. 

Adams (5.5 points) got charged up only in the last round of the tournament and had to be content with the fifth place in this seven-players double round-robin tournament under classical time control. Kasimdzhanov and Vallejo finished at the bottom of the tables with 4 points apiece. Anand lost to Adams in trying to win at all cost. Whenever he plays white, it is common knowledge that Anand goes for the blood but his second loss of the year also came with the same colour. 

It was a queen?s Indian defence by Adams that generated enough counter play and soon in the middle game Anand was battling hard to retain the initiative. After subsequent exchanges, Anand lost a pawn but Adams, with his precise technique, wrapped the issue in 52 moves. 

Kasparov lost to Topalov almost without a fight. Hoping to get a draw and win the championship solely, the Russian was in for a surprise in the opening itself as Topalov went for swift exchanges in the closed variation of the Sicilian and yet retained a slight initiative with his active pieces. 

Picking up a pawn, Toaplov quickly liquidated to a pawn plus king and pawn endgame wherein only the technical part remained to be handled. Kasparov threw the towel in after 30 moves. The other game of the day was a long drawn encounter between Leko and Vallejo that witnessed a draw after over six hours of play. 

Final standings 

1-2: Garri Kasparov, Veselin Topalov (8 each); 3: Viswanathan Anand (6.5); 4: Peter Leko (6); 5: Michael Adams (5.5); 6-7: Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Francisco Pons Vallejo (4 each). (PTI)

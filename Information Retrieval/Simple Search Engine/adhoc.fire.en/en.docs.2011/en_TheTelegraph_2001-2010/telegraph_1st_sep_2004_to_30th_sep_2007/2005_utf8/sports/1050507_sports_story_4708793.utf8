Veterans and former champions Anupama and Bhagyashree were placed fifth and sixth, respectively, to complete the Indian team composition for international meets. 

Swathi faced the Piro Defence from Anupama, who came out equally from the opening phase but committed a mistake in the middle game to be saddled with three isolated pawns. Swati, exploiting the weakness, encashed to earn full points.

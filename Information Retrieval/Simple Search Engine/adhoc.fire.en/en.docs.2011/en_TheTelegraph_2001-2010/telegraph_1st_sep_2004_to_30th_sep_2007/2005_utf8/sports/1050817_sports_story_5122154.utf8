 Ponting replaces Sehwag at No. 4

London: Ricky Pontings match-saving century in the third Ashes Test helped him replace Virender Sehwag from fourth place among batsmen while Andrew Flintoff became Englands highest ranked Test bowler at No. 10 in the ICC rankings released on Tuesday. 

Several England players have gained places due to their performance at Old Trafford. Skipper Michael Vaughan jumped up to 23rd in batting and Simon Jones climbed up to 22nd in bowling. Marcus Trescothick (eighth) was on his career-best Test batting ranking. 

Flintoff became Englands highest ranked bowler, at present. England, though, cannot catch Australia at the top of the ICC Test Championship in the current series, a 3-1 win would close the gap between them from 19 points to five. India remain third. 

Jacques Kallis continues to lead the Test batting ratings. (PTI)

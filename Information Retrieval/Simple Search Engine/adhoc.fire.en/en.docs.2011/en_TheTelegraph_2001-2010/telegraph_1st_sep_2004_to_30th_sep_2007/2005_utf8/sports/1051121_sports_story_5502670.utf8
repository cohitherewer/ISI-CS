 Australia need 78 to take series

Hobart: Australia were set just 78 to win the second Test and wrap up the series with West Indies after an unexpected fightback from the tourists on Sunday. 

The Australians dismissed the embattled West Indies for 334 on the final ball of the fourth day, leaving the formalities of clinching an unbeatable 2-0 lead to Day V. The hosts had won the Brisbane Test by 379 runs two weeks ago. 

The match looked certain to finish well inside four days when the visitors slumped to 140 for six before lunch, needing to make at least 257 to make the Australians bat again. Dwayne Bravo and Denesh Ramdin had other ideas and they put together a stubborn partnership. 

Bravo scored a brilliant 113 and Ramdin made 71 as the pair added 182 for the seventh-wicket. 

They withstood the Australian bowlers for almost two sessions with a mixture of defiance and aggression but their dismissals triggered a late collapse that left the home team on the verge of victory. 

They probably got a couple more runs than we would have hoped, Australian leg-spinner Stuart MacGill told a news conference. 

But in Test cricket, youve got to expect teams you are playing against to be up to the task, even though its apparently a very one-sided contest. 

Shane Warne captured four wickets while MacGill, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee grabbed two each. 

The West Indies had started the day on 82 for four and were soon in deep trouble when Warne dismissed Brian Lara for 45 and Marlon Samuels for 29 in his next over.

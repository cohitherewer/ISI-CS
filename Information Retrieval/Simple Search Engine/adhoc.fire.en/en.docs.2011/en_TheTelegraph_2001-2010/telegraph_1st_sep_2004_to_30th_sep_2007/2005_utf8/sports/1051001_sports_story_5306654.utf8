 Focus on Gambhir, Yadav

 - IRANI TROPHY 

 Gambhir 

New Delhi: Gautam Gambhir will be carrying a huge burden on his young shoulders when he leads Rest of India against Ranji Trophy champions Railways in the Irani Trophy tie starting at the Karnail Singh Stadium on Saturday. 

Opening the innings for the Indian Test team has brought him honour and with it the responsibility of leading a bunch of talented individuals in the countrys premier first-class event, and the 23-year old chose to look at it with a positive attitude. 

It is a young side but many of them have played for India. It is an opportunity for everyone to prove themselves, said Gambhir. 

As it goes with such ties, Gambhir will have to do a fine balancing act as a captain since he would have to aim at stopping the strong Railways from steamrolling them. Also he will have to make sure the players, who will be watched by the selectors, are given enough space to display their talent. 

The Delhi batsmans task was not made any easier with no manager around to facilitate the teams practice and other requirements. 

It was almost tragi-comedy when at the end of nets at the Karnail Singh Stadium, North Zone selector Yashpal Sharma declared himself the manager after a communication from the BCCI. 

With the host-appointed manager failing to turn up, the teams went almost without breakfast in the morning before the 1983 World Cup hero stepped in to the players rescue. 

When the railway board finally sorted out the issue and a manager did arrive at the scene, the practice session was almost over. 

It will be a crucial match for the likes of Y. Venugopal Rao and Suresh Raina, part of the Indian ODI squad in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, to consolidate their position and bolster their chance in the longer version of the game as well. 

But the limelight will be on Railways allrounder Jai Prakash Yadav. Yadav, ever the backbone of the Railways, should be that much more pumped up after his confident show in the tri-series in Zimbabwe. 

Left-arm spinner Murali Kartik too would be coming into the match with his confidence high following some sparkling performance in the English summer for Lancashire.

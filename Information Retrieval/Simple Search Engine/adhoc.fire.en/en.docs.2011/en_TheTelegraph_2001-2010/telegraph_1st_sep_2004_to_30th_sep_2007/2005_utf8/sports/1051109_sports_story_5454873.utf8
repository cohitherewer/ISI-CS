 Player denies not playing to potential

Berlin: A former German first division player denied in court on Tuesday that he had ever deliberately under-performed or sought to lose a game as part of Germanys match-fixing scandal. 

Steffen Karl, formerly of Borussia Dortmund and Hertha Berlin, is accused of accepting money from alleged fraud ringleader and obsessive gambler Ante Sapina to throw lower league matches. 

Mr Karl was not directly involved in any match-fixing, his lawyer Andreas Bartholome told the court, reading a statement on Karls behalf. 

Prosecutors say Karl accepted 20,000 euros ($23,500) from Sapina for holding back in his regional league side Chemnitzs losses to local rivals Dynamo Dresden, Holsten Kiel and Paderborn in April and May 2004. 

Karl, who played for Dortmund when they lost the Uefa Cup final to Juventus in 1993, disputed the prosecutors claim that he had ever played with the handbrake on. 

In the Paderborn match, Bartholome said television footage proved Karl had tried his hardest and had even disputed a penalty awarded to the opposition by Robert Hoyzer, the referee at the centre of the match-fixing charges. 

However, Karl did admit in the statement that he had met Sapina at a restaurant, had later spoken with him by telephone and had passed on to the goalkeeper of second division Energie Cottbus an offer of 15,000 to 20,000 euros for fixing a match.

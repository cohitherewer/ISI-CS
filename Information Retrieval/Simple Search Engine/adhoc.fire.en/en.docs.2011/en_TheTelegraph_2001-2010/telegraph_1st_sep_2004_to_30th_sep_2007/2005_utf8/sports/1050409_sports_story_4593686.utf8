The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?One-day game has become predictable?

 - The cricket is flat between the 20th and 40th overs... Changes will also make captains think, says Ravi Shastri 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Jamshedpur: Ravi Shastri began his India career as a Test cricketer, but soon enough evolved into an effective one-day player as well. His crowning glory, of course, was the 1985 World Championship of Cricket (WCC) when fifties in each of the last three matches as also wickets gave him the Champion of Champions title. The former captain, who quit almost 11 years ago ? when only 32 ? to concentrate on a career as commentator, spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about the one-day game. 

The following are excerpts 

On his impressions of one-day cricket when he 

started his international career (1980-81) 

The one-day game was just beginning to take off... 

Had started to become popular... It soon became obvious one had to work towards 

becoming a good one-day cricketer too. If I may add, there was that two-year period 

when we won the biggest tournaments ? the World Cup, the WCC and that blockbuster 

in Sharjah, soon after the WCC... It was great being a part of that team. 

On having to adjust after getting ?educated? 

in the longer version of the sport 

Well, initially, nobody treated the one-day game seriously... 

Even the seniors never suggested one actually had to develop in both forms... 

It was after the one-day game began to grow that I realised it was there to stay 

and I had to be proficient both in Tests and the shorter version. 

On his one-day debut 

Was in Ahmedabad, during the 1981-82 series against 

Keith Fletcher?s England... I got run out (for 19), but bowled quite well (ten 

overs for only 24)... After a couple of years, I realised the one-day game suited 

me perfectly... I could bowl ten overs and also contribute with the bat ? whatever 

the position I was sent in. 

On that epoch-making World Cup win 

I didn?t play the final, but remember having played 

a significant hand (three for 26) in our victory over the West Indies at the start 

of that tournament... That win in Manchester is what opened a lot of eyes... Moreover, 

our self-belief ? which took root after the victory in Berbice a couple of months 

prior to the World Cup ? soared. 

On whether not having made the XI in that final 

at Lord?s is his biggest regret 

It?s definitely a regret... However, two years later, 

I not just played the final of the next biggest tournament (the WCC), but emerged 

the player of the meet: The Champion of Champions. 

On the biggest change in the one-day game in 

the past 25 years 

The approach to the first 15 overs... (Krishnamachari) 

Srikkanth and Mark Greatbatch tried their hand at being explosive, but Sanath 

Jayasuriya transformed one-day cricket in 1996... The Sri Lankans took to every 

match with a plan and Sanath showed the way brilliantly... That pace... The range 

of shots... It was breathtaking... Then, the standard of fielding and the running 

between wickets has improved. (After a pause) Also, nowadays, batsmen aren?t 

shy of being inventive and unorthodox. 

On the lack of quality allrounders in India 

I can?t explain why we don?t have them in good numbers... 

The one-day game, in particular, encourages allrounders and we should ideally 

be blessed with a large pool. 

On his top five one-day cricketers (alphabetically) 

Wasim Akram: His record speaks for itself... 

A complete bowler who, lower down the order, could contribute with the bat as 

well. A matchwinner. 

Adam Gilchrist: Besides being a brilliant ?keeper, 

he has the ability to take the match away all on his own... Clearly, his strike-rate 

is phenomenal. 

 Sanath Jayasuriya: As I?ve said, he gave a 

new dimension to batting in the first 15 overs... Besides, he?s a brilliant fielder 

and can bowl ten overs. A hundred per cent performer. 

 Viv Richards: Another matchwinner... Could 

pull it off single-handedly... And, what a presence ? he would be intimidating... 

He meant business from the moment he stepped on to the turf. 

 Sachin Tendulkar: Awesome... Has the ability 

to play all the shots and get hundreds... Is a very good fielder and breaks partnerships 

too. 

On whether somebody narrowly missed the ?cut? 

Kapil Dev... Leaving him out has been tough... He 

was a natural in the shorter version ? terrific strokeplayer, magnificent fielder 

and somebody who could bowl ten overs for next to nothing and also pick up a couple 

of wickets. 

On whether Twenty20 has the potential to ?threaten? 

one-day cricket 

No... Twenty20 only has entertainment value... Nothing 

more as the actual skills don?t come into play... It?s more of mickey mouse cricket. 

On the ICC looking at effecting changes 

(Almost interrupting) About time the world 

body did... The one-day game, after all, has become predictable... The cricket, 

for example, is flat between the 20th and 40th overs... Changes will also make 

the captains think. 

On the one stand-out team (in limited overs 

cricket) in recent years 

Australia... They?ve consistently been outstanding... 

The Australians have natural ability and, as important, the talent pool is rich... 

Then, their bench-strength is impressive and there?s consistency and toughness 

in selection. To top it all, the Australians have a high standard of fitness. 

Finally, his tips for a one-day rookie 

Know your strengths, work on fielding and, above all, 

enjoy every moment.

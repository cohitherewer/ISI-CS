The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sehwag is among the most prized of wickets anywhere: Rameez

 - ?An opener has to be courageous and must have a temperament to withstand pressure? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: Rameez Raja began his Pakistan career in the middle-order, but became one of the finest openers of his time. He finished, in 1997-98, with appearances in 57 Tests (2,833 runs) and 198 ODIs (5,481 runs). A former captain and chief executive of his Board, Rameez ? in India on a TV assignment ? spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about opening. 

The following are excerpts 

On the qualities an opener should have 

First, he has to be a quality player because tackling the new ball calls for technical proficiency. Next, he has to be courageous and must have a temperament to withstand pressure. That has to be part of his mental make-up. 

On the opener?s job profile undergoing a change 

Absolutely... Earlier, he was largely required to see off the new ball and build a platform for the middle-order. Today, even in Tests, he?s required to maintain a run-a-ball performance... Nowadays, because of the pace, the job is much more demanding. 

On having himself begun in the middle-order 

(Grins) Yes... We didn?t have a solid opening pair in the mid-Eighties and Imran Khan asked me to move up as he felt I played the quicks better than the spinners... I found it enjoyable. 

On promotee openers 

It?s definitely easier in the middle-order... There?s less stress and, usually, a platform in place for you to enjoy... Makeshift openers, of course, have to tighten their game. Also, they have to ready themselves in the mind for long innings... Even Saeed Anwar began lower down, yet went on to become Pakistan?s most successful opener... Obviously, the demands are more in Test cricket... (After a pause) Once I?d established myself, I would attack from the beginning... We had such a wonderful middle-order and I didn?t have to protect anybody. 

On Virender Sehwag being moved to an opening slot from the summer of 2002 

Inspired and, today, his is among the most prized of wickets anywhere... The pace Sehwag sets is exceptional... What surprises me is that he?s more of a hit in Tests rather than the one-dayers.... Given his approach, he ought to be more successful in the shorter version. 

On whether there?s a formula for being able to concentrate over long periods 

Well, an opener should set small targets and, then, grow ambitious... It?s important, I think, to be clear about what you want in the first half-hour or so... Dominate or play out time? Seeing off the two opening spells will give confidence and help in concentrating. 

On the partner he was most comfortable with 

(Laughs) I had so many... It used to be distracting because almost each time I took guard, I had a ?new? face at the other end! To do well, you need a regular mate. The openers must know each other?s game as that?s going to help complement each other... Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes gave each other strength; Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer do that now... 

On whether he rates Hayden-Langer above Greenidge-Haynes 

No... When Greenidge and Haynes were around, the bowling was top class... Then, in their time, there were no minnows... No Bangladesh and no Zimbabwe... Also, no restrictions on the bouncer... That was a tougher era. If I may add, the one-day game was still taking off, yet Greenidge and Haynes were outstanding... They were naturals. 

On Pakistan having tried a different opening combination in each of the three Tests 

Because of the circumstances... If I had a say, I would have Yasir Hameed as one opener and Salman Butt/Taufeeq Umar at the other end... They aren?t technically the most gifted, but could deliver if given the confidence. Additionally, Pakistan is then going to have a right-left combination. 

On his top five openers 

Sunil Gavaskar: Very balanced... Neat, intelligent... And, despite his short stature, intimidated... Sunny had a presence and we respected him more because Imran held him in such esteem. 

Greenidge: He was blessed with an excellent technique and was a murderer. He combined the two to give cricket some of the finest innings by an opener. Even he had an intimidating presence. 

Haynes: He wasn?t as gifted as Greenidge, but worked hard to be treated on a par... In fact, he became a phenomenal opener and we would struggle to cut off his singles and twos. I remember our Haynes-specific discussions at team meetings focussed not on getting him out, but stopping those runs. For an opener, he played the spinners superbly. 

Anwar: A big match player... I don?t think I?ll forget his unbeaten 188 at the Eden, in 1998-99... Moreover, Saeed was an entertainer and that quality alone put him in a different category. 

Hayden: A big performer, again one who intimidates... That he came back so strongly after being dropped early in his career speaks volumes of his mental toughness. It?s because of Hayden that Australia get at least 300 on any day of a Test... Langer, of course, complements him. 

On the finest innings he has seen from an opener 

The one instantly to mind is Sehwag?s awesome 309 in Multan last year. 

On his own innings which gave maximum satisfaction 

In Tests, the 47 here in the second innings in 1986-87... The wicket was, if you recall, unplayable... In one-dayers, my three World Cup hundreds (one in 1987, two in 1992)... 

Finally, his tips for young openers 

Be prepared for failures, but don?t allow them to pull you down... Learn from mistakes and, please, don?t get frustrated.... After all, just one ball can do the damage... For a number of reasons, it?s essential to make the most of form.

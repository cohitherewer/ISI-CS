 New F1 team from Japan

Tokyo: Former Japanese star driver Aguri Suzuki announced on Tuesday that he would lead a new Formula One team next season with engines supplied by Honda Motor. 

Suzuki, 45, said his Super Aguri F1 had submitted an entry form to F1s governing body, the FIA, last week. 

Im filled with the desire to hoist Japans flag on the podium as a constructor or team, Suzuki said. 

I have joined many races. If I look at them as mountains, F1 is like climbing Mount Everest. No one knows what will be waiting for us ahead ... But I will do my best, he said. 

The team will be based in Langley in Oxfordshire and use the factory of disbanded F1 team Arrows. 

We will use Honda V8 engines, but the drivers are undecided, Suzuki told a news conference at the Honda headquarters in Tokyo. 

Suzuki said Japanese driver Takuma Sato, who was rejected by the Bar-Honda team last season, could be one of the drivers. We are in talks with Mr Takuma Sato and are also negotiating with several other drivers, he said. 

Meanwhile in London, Formula One team Midland on Tuesday announced that Dutch driver Christijan Albers will race for them next year. 

The 26-year old, who made his Grand Prix debut with Minardi this season, will have his first test with the Toyota-powered team at the Jerez circuit in southern Spain on December 7. (Agencies)

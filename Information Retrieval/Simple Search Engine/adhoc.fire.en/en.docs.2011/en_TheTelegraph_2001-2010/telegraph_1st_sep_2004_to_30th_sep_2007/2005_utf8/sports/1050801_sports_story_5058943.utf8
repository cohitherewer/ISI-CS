 Steve Warne-ing for England openers

London: Steve Waugh has told Englands opening batsman they must find a more effective way of combating leg-spinner Shane Warne if the team are to have a chance of winning the second Ashes Test at Edgbaston starting on Thursday. 

The former Australia captain Waugh said in hiscolumn he was shocked to see the complete lack of a gameplan from both Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss. They couldnt detect Shanes variations and in the process of looking dumbfounded sent a wave of danger signals to their teammates. They need to get the video tapes out and conjure up a plan that at least throws some pressure back on Warne or else they are as good as cooked for remaining Tests.

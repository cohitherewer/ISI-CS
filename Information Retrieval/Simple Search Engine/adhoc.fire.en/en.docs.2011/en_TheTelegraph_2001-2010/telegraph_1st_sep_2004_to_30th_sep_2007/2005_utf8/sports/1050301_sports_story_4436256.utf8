The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Another unification attempt by Fide

Tbilisi (Georgia): Fide will hold a tournament this year in an attempt to unify the chess world that split nearly a decade ago when world champion Garri Kasparov walked out. 

Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said the world?s top eight Grandmasters would play a tournament in October to identify the world champion. 

Under the latest plan, Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Michael Adams, Peter Leko, Viswanathan Anand, Veselin Topalov, Vladimir Kramnik, Garri Kasparov and Alexander Morozevich will play two round-robin rounds. 

There was no immediate reaction from any of the eight chess players. 

?A historical decision was made which will ease the nervousness in the chess world,? Ilyumzhinov said after the federation?s presidential council meeting. 

The likely venue for the event would be Kalmykia?s central city of Elista. The minimum prize-money for the event will be $500,000. All participants will have to sign up by March 15. (AP)

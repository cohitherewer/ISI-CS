 Mohali to host first Test

 - Series vs Pakistan 

 - Jamshedpur to stage fourth one-dayer 

Mumbai: Mohali, Ahmedabad and Bangalore will host the three Test matches against Pakistan in March, the BCCI announced on Thursday. The tour will begin next month. 

BCCI?s programmes and fixtures committee, chaired by its vice-president Kamal Morarka, also selected Kochi, Visakhapatnam, Kanpur, Jamshedpur and Delhi as the venues for the five one-day Internationals to be played after the Test series. 

?The venues will now have to be cleared by the Indian government and the dates will be finalised soon,? secretary S. K. Nair and Morarka told reporters here. 

Morarka said the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will send their security team to India on January 25 to inspect the venues while the cricket team will arrive either on February 24 or 25 for the tour expected to last till April 10 or 11. 

Apart from the three Test matches and five one-dayers, the visitors will also play a three-day game, likely to be held at Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, and a one-day practice game in between the Tests and the one-day series. 

The venues and dates of the warm-up matches will be finalised later, Nair said. 

Both Morarka and Nair said the committee strictly adhered to the rotation policy of the Board in choosing the venues. 

?We now intend to intimate the home and sports ministries immediately about these venues for their approval since any India-Pakistan series is a special one needing the government?s green signal. We expect to get a reply very soon,? they said. 

Nair said the dates were yet to be finalised as there might be minor changes depending upon the logistics of the teams? travel from one centre to another. ?It will be done in consultation with the PCB.? 

?The three-day warm-up match will involve the Board President?s XI and the visiting Pakistan team. The modalities of the one-day match will be discussed with the PCB before the dates and venues are finalised,? Nair said. 

All the ODIs will be day affairs, it has already been decided. 

Morarka clarified that Mumbai was never in the running to host either a Test or a ODI as per the rotation policy of the BCCI. Pakistan have not played a Test match here since 1979-80. 

While Mohali will be hosting its first-ever Test match against Pakistan, both Ahmedabad and Bangalore will be hosting a Test against Pakistan after a gap of 17 years.

 Buenos Aires: Experienced Davis Cup campaigner Agustin Calleri was added on Saturday to Argentina?s team to meet the Czech Republic next week in place of injured French Open champion Gaston Gaudio.

 Argentina host the Czechs in their World Group first round tie at the Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club from March 4 to 6.

 ?I made my decision, spoke to those who were not picked and then called Agustin to tell him and he was very happy and keen to join the group,? team captain Alberto Mancini told a news conference.

 Mancini opted for 28-year-old Calleri, eliminated in the semi-finals of the Abierto Mexicano in Acapulco on Friday, over Mariano Puerta and Juan Ignacio Chela, who is ranked higher.

 ?My choice of Agustin was based a bit on his career and experience in the Davis Cup. He is in good form,? he said. 

 Imphal: Kerala beat Maharstra 4-0 and last year?s runners up Bengal were held 1-1 by Orissa in the quarter final league of the 13th senior women?s national football championship here on Sunday. 

 Kerala beat Maharastra in group R with Subitha Poovatta and striker Angel Adolfes scoring the goals.

 In group S, Bengal and Orissa settled for a 1-1 draw. India striker Sradhanjali Samantaray scored in the 8th minute to give Orissa 1-0 lead before Bengal equalised through Shilpi Deb?s strike three minutes later. 

 Berlin: Substitute midfielder Mehmet Scholl injured his thigh during Bayern Munich?s 1-0 win over SC Freiburg on Saturday and will be out for three to four weeks, the club said.

 He will miss the second leg of Bayern?s Champions League first knockout round tie with Arsenal in London on March 9.

 The 34-year-old midfielder came off the bench in Bayern?s 3-1 win over Arsenal in the first leg in Munich on Wednesday and sent a free kick straight to the head of Claudio Pizarro for their second goal.

 Berlin: Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann appealed to the German Football Federation (DFB) to hire Berti Vogts as technical director and chief scout as soon as possible, saying he was opposed to any delays in the appointment.

 Klinsmann told a newspaper that Vogts, who coached Germany from 1990 to 1998 and quit as Scotland manager in November, was ideal for the job.

 ?(The DFB) squandered much time in the past failing to set up professional structures,? he said.

 Vogts told the newspaper that he was interested in the job, which reportedly includes a 500,000-euro ($662,900) annual salary, but will not accept it if it did not begin until 2006.

 ?I?ve made it clear that I won?t be available in 2006,? Vogts said. 

 London: A top-flight English referee has been suspended over his involvement in an online racehorse syndicate site, a British newspaper said.

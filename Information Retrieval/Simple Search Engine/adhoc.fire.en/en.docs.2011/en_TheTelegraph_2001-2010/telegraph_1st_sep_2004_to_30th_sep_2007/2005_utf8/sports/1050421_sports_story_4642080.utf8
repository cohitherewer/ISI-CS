The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India need to develop 3-dimensional players 

 - Apart from Kaif and Tendulkar, the fielding is pretty pedestrian 

BOB WOOLMER

 Sriram is quick singles and twos man, as well as a brilliant fielder 

One of the great things about cricket is that it stimulates debate. It is the sort of game where no one really knows if they are right or wrong when they assess teams or individuals. 

After conceding the lead in the Test series against Pakistan and then again losing their way against a Pakistan team in the one-day Internationals, naturally pundits, critics, coaches will ask the question: why to India? 

My guess is that it was caused by a multitude of factors, one being that Pakistan played as a team and all contributed and that the side seemed to have a better game plan. 

Of course this is pure speculation as I do not sit with the Indian team and discuss these things. 

I am only able to comment from our perspective as the opposition. I am often asked what I think of the Indian team. In fact, someone asked me the other day can India win the 2007 World Cup. So much can and will take place between now and the World Cup that the only answer is that India have the same chance as most other teams in the competition. 

India?s performance in the last World Cup in South Africa was interesting. 

They were unheralded before the tournament started, for reasons I am unable to explain. They have on paper a batting line up that rivals Australia?s, both in ability and talent. Yet following their World Cup performance, they have been unable to sustain that momentum and probably, as I write, have regressed slightly. 

With a batting line up boasting of Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, most of us would agree that they would never be short of runs. 

Apart from the Delhi chase on a pitch not fit for one-day International cricket they stacked up runs heavily against us in the just-concluded series. So why did they fall from a 2-0 lead to concede the series? 

My opinion is, most modern day limited-overs sides have at least five frontline bowlers, usually six and sometimes with South Africa in the 90s they had seven. This allows for flexibility in strategy and tactics. 

India also have an interesting problem in that they have three very fine left-arm bowlers, but like right arm bowlers bowling over the wicket, the ball ends up going wide of the off stump and the modern one-day player will latch onto any width. 

I though Ajit Agarkar?s inclusion and his ability to cramp the right hander with reverse swing gave India more options. Lakshmipathy Balaji to me is a Test match and not a one-day bowler, as he also tends to give too much room outside the off stump. 

Another area where India must concentrate is in the fielding department. Kaif stands out, but it looks pretty pedestrian apart from Tendulkar who is a great allround cricketer. 

The batting I do not think is a problem as the ability to score heavily is always there. 

One thing that really struck me though was a lot depended on Dravid to do the donkey?s work in the middle, taking the ones and twos. It seemed that the individuals? roles were blurred. 

I hasten to add here that I am not privy to their meetings but I guess the instructions are pretty much play your natural game, Rahul you bat through, Kaif you pressurise them later with running between the wickets etc. All teams have that. 

However, if one of Tendulkar or Sehwag were to bat through the innings instead of blasting together, India would have a great advantage. 

Yuvraj Singh is a fine player whose form has not come to the fore in this series. He has not had that much opportunity to bat for long periods, but it is these strategic areas that India were unable to put it together, or that is how it seemed to me! 

It is no different in the Test match arena ? runs are rarely the problem. But containing and pressurising the opposition with a balanced attack is. 

Whether they like it or not, India need to find an allrounder with the capabilities of an Andrew Flintoff, Shaun Pollock or Jacques Kallis. I suspect most sides would crave that. I have always believed that in order to win one-day Internationals it is important to have three-dimensional cricketers in the team, not bits and pieces players. 

With the depth they have, India can put together many combinations. 

Despite V.V.S. Laxman being not included in the one-day side, batting was never a problem. I was very impressed by S. Sriram at Hyderabad as he is a quick singles and twos man, hits the ball hard and is a brilliant fielder, completely three dimensional. 

Irfan Pathan looks like he can bat. He might be encouraged to be used at seven with a specific role. In M.S. Dhoni India have found a good allround cricketer and as he improves he will be a very important part of their one-day side. 

Yes, I think India can win the World Cup but I also think Pakistan can! I suspect Australia think they can too! Don?t forget other teams as well! 

The most important part of any debate are concrete facts not hypothesis. As I said cricket is just the sort of sport where no one will ever be one hundred per cent correct but it is fun to speculate and hope that your team plays better on the day than the opposition! (PTI)

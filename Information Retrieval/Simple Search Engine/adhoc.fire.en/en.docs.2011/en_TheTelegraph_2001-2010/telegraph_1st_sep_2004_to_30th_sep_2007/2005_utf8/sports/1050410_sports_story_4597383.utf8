 Kunte back to winning ways

 Humpy had a bad day in office 

Dubai: Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte got back to winning ways while young Abhijit Gupta stayed on course for his third and final International Master norm, holding GM Sergey Fedorchuk in the fifth round of the Dubai international chess meet on Saturday. 

Kunte, who suffered a shock defeat in the fourth round, cruised past Yemen?s Al Qudaimi Basheer to take his tally to 3.5 points out of a possible five, but GMs Sandipan Chanda, Koneru Humpy, WGM aspirant Eesha Karavade and IM aspirants G Balaji and Parimarjan Negi suffered defeats against higher-ranked opponents. 

Humpy lost to Alexander Riazentsev of Russia, Negi succumbed to Wang Yue of China and Balaji caved in to Czech David Nara. 

At the top of the table, Georgi Kacheishvili maintained his slender lead after signing truce with top seed Alexander Motylev of Russia. Kacheishvili moved to 4.5 points. He is trailed by 14 players, including Motylev and second seed Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria. 

Lower down, it was a better performance by some Indians as IM S. Kidambi pounced on the opportunities to score a comfortable victory over compatriot Sashikant Kutwal. D Sai Srinivas scored over local youngster Saeed Ishaq while Kruttika Nadig did well to hold IM Elina Danialian of Armenia. GM R B Ramesh, IM Rahul Shetty and G Rohit also won. (PTI)

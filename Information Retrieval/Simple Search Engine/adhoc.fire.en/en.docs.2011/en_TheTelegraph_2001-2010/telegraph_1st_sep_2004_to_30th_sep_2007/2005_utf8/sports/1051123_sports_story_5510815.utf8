 Sourav had his chances, now its Rahuls turn

 - Chief selector Kiran More justifies change of guard

Chennai: Its official: Rahul Dravid will take over as Test captain from Sourav Ganguly, who won Indias last series, in Zimbabwe. Dravids elevation is for the three-match series against Sri Lanka beginning here next month. 

The following is what chief selector Kiran More had to say at the end of the more than hour-long meeting at the team hotel on Tuesday morning: 

We respect Souravs contribution to Indian cricket. He has performed well in his five years as captain. Rahul is doing well in the one-dayers and whenever he has got the opportunity. We have plans for the future. We are not counting Sourav out in any way, but as of now, Rahul is the captain. 

We discussed about it in detail, and finally, the decision was unanimous. There is no question of Sourav being victimised after the Zimbabwe fiasco. Sourav had his chances, now its Rahuls turn. We did discuss and take into account all recent records... If you dont win against teams like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, then you shouldnt be playing. 

Were not happy with Souravs performance over the past couple of years. Rahul, on the other hand, has been performing consistently.

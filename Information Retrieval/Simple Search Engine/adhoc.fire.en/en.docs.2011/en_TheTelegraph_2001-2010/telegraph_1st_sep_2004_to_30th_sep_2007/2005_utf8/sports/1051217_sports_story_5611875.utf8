The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravids silence borders on complicity 

Straight Talk

 Arjuna Ranatunga

 I would not like to be in Rahul 

 Dravids shoes if I am the captain. In the entire Sourav 

 Ganguly episode, his silence borders on complicity. He has 

 every reason to seek the team he wants, but he also owes 

 it to his men to be seen standing right next to them. At 

 best he would miss out on the trust and loyalty of his mates 

 which allows a captain to ask for the impossible; at worst 

 he would be very unpopular in the dressing room.

 Truth to tell, Sourav was very 

 impressive at the Kotla. His two knocks (40 and 39) were 

 well crafted and critical to the eventual scores. His dismissal 

 in the first innings triggered the collapse which only accentuates 

 his contribution on the first day. A few of his cover drives, 

 trust me, were the best I saw in the entire match.

 He was seen giving his 100 per 

 cent, he wanted his place back badly. Such hunger is to 

 be welcomed, not scorned. It has not reflected well of the 

 system, not of selectors or team management.

 The match, by and large, did not 

 reflect well on the batsmen who seemed to suffer from sudden 

 collapses. In a way it was a tribute to Murali and Kumble 

 who both tend to take wickets in a clutch. You give them 

 an inch and they would set you back by miles.

 It was thus imperative for the 

 batsmen to stay at the crease for long hours. India made 

 the mistake in the first innings but learnt their lesson 

 in the second outing. Sri Lanka only did the repeat act.

 It was not a wicket where you 

 score 240s in your two innings. It is here that Mahela Jayawardenes 

 horrid shot in the first innings hurt the team the most.

 Kumble needed just such an invitation. 

 The man now has more variety than he used to in our times 

 when we strictly dealt with him like a medium-pacer. He 

 has a good slider with a hint of googly and his variation 

 of pace is brilliant. He still is best negotiated if you 

 keep rotating the strike.

 Maravan Atapattu and Jayawardene 

 did it in the first innings and Kumble looked ordinary. 

 The moment he could force batsmen to go back into their 

 shells, the pressure built up. The wicket, too, was his 

 ally in a way ? it was slow and low, and batsmen were forced 

 to play him in front of the wicket. It restricted them from 

 manipulating him around the field.

 If the Lankans looked messed up 

 in their handling of Kumble, they also did not win any points 

 for allowing Irfan Pathan to run away with an impressive 

 score. The visitors did not seem to have learnt anything 

 from the one-dayers.

 Sri Lankan planning against Pathan 

 was all skewed up even though bringing on Murali in the 

 second over suggested they sensed his weakness against the 

 magical off-spinner. I would have preferred to keep medium-pacers 

 on for at least four-five overs, but then, it is easier 

 to be wise on hindsight.

 I cant really close without 

 joining others in applauding the feat of Sachin Tendulkar. 

 He has been a marvel of our times, a once-in-a-generation 

 cricketer who scores a perfect ten on all scales of excellence.

 His lustre remains undimmed and 

 so is the inspiration which his presence imparts to millions 

 of youngsters. He is the high deity of the game we all love.

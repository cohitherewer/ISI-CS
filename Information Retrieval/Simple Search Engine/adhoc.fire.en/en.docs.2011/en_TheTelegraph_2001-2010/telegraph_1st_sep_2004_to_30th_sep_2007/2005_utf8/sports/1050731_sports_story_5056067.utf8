Montreal: Aaron Peirsol and Leisel Jones set world records to win their second gold medals at the World Aquatic Championships on Friday, while Michael Phelps collected his fourth, courtesy another American relay victory. 

American Peirsol lowered his own 200m backstroke record to join Australians Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett as the only swimmers to win the same event at three world championships. 

Jones slashed 0.72 seconds off Amanda Beards world record to win the 200m breaststroke final, giving the Australian a second gold after her win in the 100m earlier this week. 

Australias Olympic champion Jodie Henry also won her second title this week with victory in the 100m freestyle to confirm her status as the fastest woman in the world. 

Brendan Hansen, Peirsols training partner, completed the 100m-200m breaststroke double for the first time by winning the longer race to extend the US lead at the top of the medal standings. 

Phelps put the icing on the cake when he teamed up with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay and Klete Keller to win the 4x200m freestyle relay in a combined time of 7:06.58 to take the gold ahead of Canada and Australia. 

Peirsol led all the way to take the gold in 1:54.66, 0.08 under the previous mark of 1:54.74 which he set at last years US Olympic trials at Long Beach, California. 

Markus Rogan of Austria finished second in 1:56.63 while American Ryan Lochte was third in 1:57.00 but all the plaudits were with Peirsol. 

Jones stopped the clock at 2:21.72 to erase the mark Beard set at Long Beach last year. Germanys Anne Poleska finished second and Austrias Mirna Jukic third. 

Controversy erupts 

Meanwhile, an Australia coach, Alan Thompson, has called for the use of video replay in swimming, saying it would have helped officials spot a disputed move by Polish swimmer Otylia Jedrzejczak during a world-record performance.

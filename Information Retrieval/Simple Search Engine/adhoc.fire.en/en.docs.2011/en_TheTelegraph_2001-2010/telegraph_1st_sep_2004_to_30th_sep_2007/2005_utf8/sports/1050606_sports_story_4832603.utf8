The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thanks to family: Nadal

Paris: A ruthless warrior on his way to the French Open title, Rafael Nadal exposed a softer side Sunday after becoming the first man in 23 years to win at Roland Garros on his debut. 

After asluting King Juan Carlos Nadal climbed over a barrier and into the stands to hug his family who cut short a holiday in China to witness his triumph. 

Nadal emulated Swede Mats Wilander who lifted the Musketeers Cup on his first visit to Roland Garros in 1982. 

The trophy was then presented to him by French soccer great Zinedine Zidane, a fitting choice for Nadal who once thought about imitating his uncle Miguel Angel Nadal, the former Barcelona and Spain soccer player, before concentrating on tennis. 

Zidane plays for Real Madrid, the club Nadal supports despite his uncles allegiance to their fierce rivals. 

Miguel Angel Nadal had been anxiously watching from the stands and so had another uncle of the Spanish prodigy, Toni, who has coached Rafa since he picked up a racket for the first time. 

I want to thank my family, who have always supported me, and particularly my uncle (Toni), who has accompanied me and helped me since I was little, Nadal told the 15,000-strong Parisian crowd giving him a standing ovation. 

Nadal also had kind words for Puerta. Congratulations to Mariano, who has had a great season and played a great match, he said. 

I lost to an excellent player, probably the best in the world, Puerta said.

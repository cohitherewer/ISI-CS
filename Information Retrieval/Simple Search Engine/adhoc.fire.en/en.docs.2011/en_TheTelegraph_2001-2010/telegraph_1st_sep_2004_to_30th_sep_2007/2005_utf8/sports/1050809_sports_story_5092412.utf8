 Majid for series every 2 years

Dubai: The surfeit of India-Pakistan cricket matches over the past 18 months has prompted former great Majid Khan to warn that such frequent contests could result in a fall in expectations and excitement among the public. 

I feel that if the India-Pakistan series is played too frequently, it may dampen the spirits of the players and public, Majid was quoted as saying in a Dubai daily on Monday. 

He suggested that series between the arch-rivals should be staged only every two years like the Ashes between England and Australia. 

Majid was one of the finest opening batsmen for Pakistan and played 63 Tests scoring 3,931 runs with eight hundreds. 

About the upcoming Afro-Asian series, for which he was a selector, he said it could turn out to be exciting. 

We have seen matches between a World XI and a country, but never between two continents. However, we have to see how it is going to be received by the public, he said. 

Majid, the son of Mohammed Jahangir Khan, who played four Tests for India before Partition, and a cousin of former captain Imran Khan, expressed satisfaction at the direction Pakistans cricket was taking and reposed faith in the leadership of Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Inzamam performed very well last year. He has gained experience and is maturer now. 

However, he is also at that stage or age of his career where it might take a long time to recover from an injury, he said. 

Referring to the treatment of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, he said: The administration and captain must draw a policy line and everyone must adhere to it. Anyone who crosses the line should not be included in the team.

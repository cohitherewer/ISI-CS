The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India should have won 2nd match

 - Jayasuriyas shoulder still hurts, but he wants to play against WI tomorrow 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Colombo: Nowadays, besides helping Sri Lankas cause on the field, Sanath Jayasuriya is acting as Tom Moodys interpreter! 

The former captain had just got off his gleaming Toyota Prado (with the distinctive 7979 numberplate) at the Taj Samudra, on Thursday evening, when the new coach walked up for assistance. 

Moody was having problems communicating with the driver at his disposal and Jayasuriya promptly got into the act in Singhalese. After a minute or two, the drivers nod suggested the message had been conveyed. 

Sorted out, Tom, Jayasuriya announced, grinning. It was Moodys turn to grin. 

Having finished the interpreters job, Jayasuriya briefly spoke to The Telegraph. 

Asked whether the Indians had developed a mental block, losing four of the last five ODIs against Sri Lanka, he replied: Dont know if thats the reason, but India should have won the second match (in Dambulla) last night... Mental block or not, were happy... 

Jayasuriyas injury-defying unbeaten 43, versus India last Saturday, gave Sri Lanka a flying start in the tri-series. That knock, incidentally, has taken him to 9,967 runs (18x100, 57x50). 

He said: Im happy Sourav (Ganguly) has reached 10,000... Hes a good batsman and a good person... Of course, even I want to get there quickly, but Im not going to risk my shoulder... I want to play against the West Indies on Saturday, but... 

Jayasuriya, it may be recalled, dislocated his right shoulder in the opener. Forget till when I was in pain, its still hurting, he remarked. 

The 36-year-old remains feisty.

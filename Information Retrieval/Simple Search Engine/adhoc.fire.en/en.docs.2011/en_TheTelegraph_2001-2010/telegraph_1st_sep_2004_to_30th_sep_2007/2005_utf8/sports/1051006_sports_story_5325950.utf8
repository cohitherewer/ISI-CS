 London: Colin Moynihan was named on Wednesday as the man to lead British sport in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics. Sports minister from 1987-90 under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Moynihan beat fellow former Olympic-medallist David Hemery in a vote to replace Craig Reedie as chairman of the British Olympic Association (BOA). Moynihan won a rowing silver medal at the 1980 Moscow Games as the cox to the men?s eight. 

 Buenos Aires: Argentina striker Hernan Crespo said he was happy for rivals Brazil to be considered as favourites to win the 2006 World Cup. Crespo remembered that Argentina arrived at the previous World Cup as favourites, only to be knocked out in the first round, while Brazil started as dark horses and went on to win a fifth world title. ?It?s best not to talk about Argentina as favourites,? he said on Tuesday. ?Let?s see how they (Brazil) handle the pressure this time. 

 Frankfurt: VfB Stuttgart striker Jon Dahl Tomasson has been banned for three matches after being sent off against Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. The Denmark international clattered into Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and was shown a red card in the 80th minute of the goalless draw. Tomasson?s promising form has been one of the few positives for Stuttgart this season.

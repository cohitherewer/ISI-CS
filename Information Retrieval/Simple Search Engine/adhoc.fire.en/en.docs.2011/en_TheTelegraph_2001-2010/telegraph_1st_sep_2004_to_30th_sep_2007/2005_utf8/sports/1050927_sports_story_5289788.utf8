 Dungarpur livid at e-mail leak 

 - Former BCCI chief wants voting rights for coach, captain 

Mumbai: Former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur Monday said he was in favour of giving voting rights not only to the coach but also to the captain at national selection committee meetings. 

Why only the coach, the captain too should have a vote in the meetings as these are the two guys who are directly connected with the team, said the former national selection committee chairman. 

But he said he was not in favour of whittling down the size of the committee from the present five to three, as suggested by former Test cricketer and KSCA secretary Brijesh Patel. 

I feel five is the right number as India is a vast country and nowadays a lot of talent is found in rural areas. Its not possible for a three-man committee to do the job effectively. 

Dungarpur also said that it was wrong on the part of Sourav to reveal dressing room discussions to the media which had started the ongoing spat between him and coach Greg Chappell. 

Sourav told the media after scoring a century in the first India-Zimbabwe Test in Bulawayo that there had been a suggestion (without naming Chappell) that he step down from captaincy before the commencement of the match. 

There have been a lot of instances in the past of untoward happenings in the dressing room, but they all remained within the confines of the area. 

The dressing room is the preserve of the teams privacy, he added, echoing the sentiments expressed by Sachin Tendulkar recently on the issue. 

A day before the review committee meeting, Dungarpur demanded Sourav should quit to help solve the raging controversy. 

Slamming both Sourav and former Board chief Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is a member of the review committee, Dungarpur said as such the only way out is for Sourav to put in his papers and allow coach Chappell to continue his task of taking Indian cricket forward. 

Its painful for me to criticise an Indian captain, but I feel in this situation its Sourav who should quit. But I know this is not going to happen as hes been protected right through his tenure by another person from his city, Dalmiya, Dungarpur said. 

Dungarpur also said that towards the latter part of his tenure as Indian coach John Wright was at his wits end on how to tackle Dalmiya and Sourav. John (Wright) told me before leaving that he cannot function at all when these two were running Indian cricket. I know what he had to endure in the interest of Indian cricket, even abuses from the captain and his cronies. (PTI)

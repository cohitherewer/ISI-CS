Calcutta: Anastasia Myskina brought an end to Indias presence at the WTA Sunfeast Open, at least in singles, with a 6-4, 6-2 triumph over Shikha Uberoi in the quarter finals at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Friday. 

But the scoreline doesnt reveal the whole story. Shikha put up a good fight, perhaps too good a fight, and in the end, her powerful attacking game led to her downfall. 

She rushed the points too much, and had a torrent of errors that Myskina, cleverly, took advantage of. The world No. 12 held back, kept the ball in play, and allowed Shikha to make all the mistakes. 

Not that the Russian didnt make any mistakes herself. Else she wouldnt have found herself a break down at 1-3 in the first set. 

But Shikha, who was serving up a storm in the beginning, began to feel the pressure of the big game against a big name, and her first serve percentage began to plummet. 

The pressure told in the sixth game, when she began with a double fault and the impatience to finish off points led to her being broken. 

Myskina just kept hitting the ball deeper and deeper, taking the pace off the ball, while Shikha kept hitting harder and harder. The lesson for Shikha here is that only power play will not win matches. Sometimes gentle persuasion works better. 

And it did, to Myskinas advantage, as error after error came off Shikhas racket. 

The pair held serve until the tenth game, when Shikha, at 4-5, needed to hold to level things. But that was not to be, as the Indian just couldnt get her first serves in, and put three forehands into the net. 

She was finally broken, when, after running cross-court and getting to a Myskina forehand that landed in the right service box, she put the ball wide. 

Myskina began the second set holding, but not without a fight from Shikha, who took her to deuce. But a forehand into the net and a backhand long gave Myskina the game. 

Myskina then went up 2-0, two forehand winners and a double fault from Shikha giving her the game. The Indian didnt let that deter her, and the gutsy 22-year old broke back in the very next. 

Shikha lost Game IV, but not without a fight. She got to game point before giving it away after battling back to three deuces. Some excellent winners from Myskina, however, had the Indian stranded at the baseline. 

After that, Shikha managed to hold just one more game before Myskina wrapped up the match with another break. 

The top seed will now meet Kaia Kanepi, who was first into the semi-finals with an upset win over world No. 97 Sybille Bammer of Austria. The Estonian, ranked 172, won 7-5, 6-3. 

Meanwhile, Elena Likhovtseva completed the line-up with a 6-1, 7-5 dismissal of Swedens Sofia Arvidsson in the last match of the day to set up a semi-final date with Karolina Sprem. 

The world No. 16 raced through the first set, before Arvidsson woke up to give some semblance of a fight in the second. 

She broke the Russian in the third game and began to put a lot more power into her serves. The errors on return, however, were too many, and she allowed Likhovtseva back by losing her serve in the sixth. 

The second seed didnt need another invitation. She broke again in the 11th and then served out the match. 

Sprem steamrolled her way past Melinda Czink 6-3, 6-1. 

The seventh-seeded Croat was just too good for Sania Mirzas conqueror, who showed none of the tenacity she exhibited in her fightback against the Indian on Wednesday. 

The only thing she did do continually was attack Sprems backhand, but the world No. 85 countered that strategy with some excellent returns that eventually ran Czink to the ground. 

In the first set, Sprem went up a break immediately and followed that up with another in the fifth. Czink salvaged one break in the very next, and things went with serve till the ninth. 

Once again Czink had trouble on her serve and gifted two set points to Sprem, who let go the advantage and allowed the Hungarian to scramble to deuce. 

Sprem had it all too easy in the second set, sending aces and service winners whizzing past a befuddled Czink who knew, this time, that there was no coming back.

 Simone: Shane in a rarefied bubble

Sydney: The estranged wife of Shane Warne said Monday the high-profile Australian Test cricketer lived in a rarefied bubble and did not understand reality. 

Simone Warne, 35, who has separated from Warne over his highly-publicised infidelities, said the champion leg-spinner did not comprehend that he was behaving badly towards her. 

Warne, 35, has been the subject of lurid English tabloid headlines after a series of dalliances with young women which Simone Warne confirmed had occurred since he moved to England to play for county Hampshire three months ago. 

He just doesnt get it, he cannot comprehend that he is behaving badly, Simone told the latest issue of Australian magazine New Idea. 

He knows Im hurting, but he doesnt understand that what he is doing is wrong. Its been a massive reality check for him that he has lost his family. He kept saying: I dont understand why you have to go, we can get through this. 

I think he lives in such a rarefied bubble these days, he doesnt understand what reality is anymore. Hes living the high life and its not a good way to live, sooner or later the bubble bursts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Subrata rues missing out on win 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya apologised to the club supporters for what he said was ?letting them down? at not being able to earn a victory in the opening match of the National Football League for the ONGC Cup at Salt Lake Stadium Wednesday. 

?I tried hard, and my boys did dominate most of the match, but we could not translate that domination into goals. That is something I desperately wanted today, and I apologise to my supporters.? 

Subhas Bhowmick, East Bengal coach, wasn?t so dramatic over his own cause ? ?I had already said a draw wouldn?t defeat me, the result is okay? ? but was blowing fire, demanding a goal, mostly wasn?t there. A Rahim Nabi strike early in the match was disallowed for infringement. 

?There was no problem, it was a clean goal?? was what Bhowmick said. An adventurous club official feels the video of the match should be sent to the AFC. 

Bhowmick was also fuming about the delay in starting the match (due to the speeches in the PM?s opening). ?We were asked to be in the tunnel at 2.55 pm and we were. Then why did we have to wait? Even the referee arrived at 3.08 pm.? 

Asked if the referee ? K. Shankar of Tamil Nadu ? was being targetted, Bhowmick said ?no.? The real scapegoat happened to be the organisers, it seems. The IFA, that is.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No qualms about not having been strict 

 John Wright 

Melbourne: Former Indian coach John Wright hopes his under-fire successor Greg Chappell to sort out the teams poor one-day form. 

Wright, the coach of World XI playing in Australia in the Super Series, left as Indias coach last April. 

Wright, whose five years as coach included Test series victories against Australia and Pakistan, admitted to poor results in the last months of his tenure and said he hoped that straight-shooting Chappell would fix it. 

My last seven months with the (India) one-day team ? the form was poor and Gregs going about sorting that out, Wright told reporters here Saturday ahead of the final Super Series one-dayer against Australia. 

There will always be a couple of bumpy issues along the way when you are in a coaching situation, but I hope my successor, Greg, and his team can take it a bit further forward. 

Wright defended his gentlemanly demeanour against criticism that he was not tough enough to get his way in the world of Indian cricket. 

I dont want to get into that conjecture, but the bottomline from my perspective as a coach is I work in my way. I know that several people made judgements on how I approached the job and generally its from their perspective, Wright said. 

I know the way I did the job and I feel we made progress. I dont have anything to add. At the end of the day you do it the way you want to do it. I certainly dont have qualms for not having been strict? 

I think you have to ask the players about those sorts of things. I had several years with the team, I enjoyed it, I loved the fans over there. It was probably my most enriching cricketing experience. 

We took the process of trying to get a team that would keep everyone... Happy and take it a stage forward and I hope my successor Greg and his team take it a bit further forward. 

Wright said he was a keen observer of Indian cricket and had no doubts that India could one day reign as the worlds No. 1 team. 

I know that they can play and theyll get the results, he said. 

I always felt that India could be No. 1. Theyre ranked third in the Test rankings and one-day form can turn around very quickly, as we showed in the (2003) World Cup and the (2004) ICC Championship. 

India have a seven-match one-day series against Sri Lanka starting on October 25.

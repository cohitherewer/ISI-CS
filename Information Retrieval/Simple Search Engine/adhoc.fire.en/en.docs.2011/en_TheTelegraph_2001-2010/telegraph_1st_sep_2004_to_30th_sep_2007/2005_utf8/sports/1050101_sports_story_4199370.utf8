 Rooney ban hits United

 Rooney admitted to a charge of violent conduct 

London: Manchester United?s push for the Premier League title suffered a major blow when star striker Wayne Rooney was hit with a three-match ban after admitting a charge of violent conduct, the FA announced on Thursday. 

The England striker will miss Premiership matches against Middlesbrough, Tottenham Hotspur and the FA Cup third-round clash with Exeter. 

The ban was imposed after United decided not to appeal against the charge which was brought when Rooney pushed his hand into the face of Bolton defender Tal Ben Haim at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

Ben Haim, who was widely criticised for his reaction to the incident, has also been charged with improper conduct with Bolton confirming they will appeal. 

Earlier Thursday, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson claimed the FA?s disciplinary procedures were ?flawed and immoral.? 

Ferguson said: ?The violent conduct charge bemuses me because every man and his dog would agree it was not violent conduct. If it is violent conduct, why are they charging Ben Haim? I can?t understand it. ?If it is violent conduct, Ben Haim should not be charged. He is being charged so they therefore believe he is guilty of diving and bringing the game into disrepute. 

Rooney?s ban leaves United short of firepower with Ruud van Nistelrooy and Louis Saha both currently sidelined through injury. (AFP)

 Gough doubtful for final ODI

Johannesburg: Darren Gough, England?s leading bowler in the one-day series against South Africa, is doubtful for the final match in Centurion on Sunday. 

England media manager Andrew Walpole said on Saturday that Gough had woken in the morning with a respiratory virus. That may force England to play Steve Harmison.Medium-pacer Alex Wharf said the team had not yet been selected. 

?Goughie?s bowled beautifully this series and has not taken as many wickets as he?s deserved,? Wharf said on Saturday. 

?He?s a quality bowler, out there with the best, and he?s living proof that at 34 years, and after a major injury, you can still come back. 

?Darren used to look after me when I was a kid starting with Yorkshire and it was a good thing he took me under his wing.?Wharf played his first match of the series in Durban and took three for 48, including the wickets of Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis with successive balls in the fourth over of the match. 

Kevin unperturbed 

Meanwhile, South African-born English Kevin Pietersen says he has no regrets about playing for England and is not bothered by the brick-bats he has received from South African fans. 

?I don?t have any regrets (over) leaving South Africa at all,? he said on Friday when asked about the criticism from some South African fans and his eye-ball to eye-ball contacts with South African captain Graeme Smith during the match on Wednesday.

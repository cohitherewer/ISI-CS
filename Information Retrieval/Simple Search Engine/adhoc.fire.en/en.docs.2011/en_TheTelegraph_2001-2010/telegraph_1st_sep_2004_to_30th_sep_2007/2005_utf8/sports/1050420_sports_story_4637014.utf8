Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who has often been criticised for not being innovative and not asserting his authority in the field, Tuesday said the successful tour of India was a ?great learning experience? which helped him to mature as a captain. 

?I would only say that this tour has helped me tremendously and I have gained what I might not have learnt in 50 Tests as captain,? Inzamam said from Lahore. 

?I kept revising the gameplan according to the situation that kept changing probably every over. I made regular changes in the batting order, kept running the fielders here and there and experimented with regular bowling changes. It has been tough but great learning series as a captain,? he said. 

Inzamam?s men, who were virtually written off as pushovers when they landed in India, drew the Test series 1-1 and went on to record a remarkable come-from-behind 4-2 win in the one-dayers. 

The 35-year-old veteran of 100 Tests said his players deserved all the praise and they should enjoy the moments after the tension filled 50-day tour but should not get overwhelmed with the win. 

?The team should enjoy and celebrate these moments because they deserve it. But they can?t live on these laurels forever. We have to keep our feet on the ground, stay humble and collect all the praise, well-wishes and prayers because these will help us in future,? Inzamam said. 

Inzamam admitted that he was feeling much lighter after the gruelling tour. ?I admit that after months, I slept tension-free and there were no nightmares haunting my dreams. It feels like I have been reborn. 

Inzamam said as he saw the flood of Pakistan supporters waiting outside the arrival lounge at Lahore airport Monday to catch a glimpse of the players, the complete tour rewinded through his mind. 

?I was collecting my baggage when Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan left and I could see through the glass that they were being patted, garlanded, showered with rose petals and what not. It was then when I recalled what they had gone through during the last two months. I don?t think I will do justice if I try to describe their efforts in words. 

Praise from Shaharyar 

Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan hailed Inzamam amp; Co?s fighting spirit against India. 

?To draw the Test series with a magnificent victory in Bangalore and to win the ODI series after losing the first two matches, is testimony to their fighting spirit, commitment and pride of performance. 

?President Musharraf has personally congratulated the team in New Delhi. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz will be receiving the team in Islamabad on April 24,? Khan said in a statement. 

The PCB chairman also expressed happiness that the team?s conduct was exemplary during the high profile tour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cricket is a hard game and doesnt offer guarantees

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 - Irfan Pathan explains why he still doesnt see himself 

 as an allrounder 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Jaipur: Terrific with the bat in Nagpur; superb with the ball in Mohali. Ifran Pathan is in form and the Sri Lankans are paying dearly. The 21-year-old (who has developed an accent) spoke to The Telegraph at the Team India hotel. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q The season began with the tri-series in 

 Sri Lanka. Were you comfortable with the rhythm there? 

 A As Id 

 been dropped for the last two ODIs against Pakistan, the 

 tournament marked my comeback... I was under some pressure, 

 but the short stint with Middlesex proved helpful... I didnt 

 get many wickets (in Sri Lanka), but swung the ball and 

 was generally happy with my rhythm. 

 What did you learn at Middlesex? 

 Lots... I learnt to adjust to a new environment. 

 For example, there werent any familiar faces in the 

 dressing room and, if I had a problem, I couldnt straightaway 

 turn to the captain (Ben Hutton) or the coach (John Emburey)... 

 Of course, they were helpful, but being in the Indian dressing 

 room is different... Then, I learnt to bowl on different 

 surfaces in a short span of time... Also, learnt much about 

 professionalism. Being an overseas pro, there was more responsibility 

 to deliver. 

 You had a bit of a shoulder problem... 

 It got blown out of proportion by the Media... 

 Owing to the cold, I got a catch while throwing 

 off balance... There wasnt anything more to it. 

 Then, you got injured in the tri-series final... 

 While fielding, yes, which is why I skipped 

 the Afro-Asia Cup. 

 Thanks to the swing, you were often unplayable 

 in Zimbabwe. Did you work harder than usual? 

 (Laughs) Id been told that 

 the wickets wouldnt be helpful, but they were... I 

 got enough swing because I adjusted to the wickets and bowled 

 in the right areas... The length becomes critical. That 

 the Kookabura was being used also made a difference. Usually, 

 it swings appreciably. I accept that Ive got to get 

 used to balls of different brands, though. 

 Do brands really make such a difference? 

 Its how you prepare some 

 brands... The kind of treatment you give the ball. 

 In a fresh series, how long does it take for 

 a fast bowler to get into rhythm? 

 Depends... Could take some overs, may take 

 many matches... Its all about how the bowler himself 

 feels. 

 While in Zimbabwe, you said that the coach (Greg 

 Chappell) helped you quickly find rhythm. What did he do? 

 Greg and (sports scientist) Ian Frazer 

 devised drills both for bowling and batting and that helped... 

 Greg reads the wickets well and suggests the length I should 

 bowl... Often, small suggestions make a big difference. 

 How much of cricket is confidence-driven? 

 Confidence is everything, but you can still 

 get hit in the ODIs... 

 What were your thoughts before the start of 

 the ongoing series ? the first of the 2005-06 season at 

 home? 

 Given the nature of wickets in India, Id 

 pepared myself for tough days... Im still learning 

 and challenges dont deter me. 

 The series was preceded by the Challenger, where 

 you even opened the batting in the first match... 

 (Laughs again) Opening with Sachin 

 (Tendulkar) was a wonderful experience... 

 When were you told you would bat at No. 3 in 

 Nagpur? 

 On the evening before the match... It gave 

 me time to mentally prepare myself... I told myself I must 

 stay relaxed and play the shots which come naturally. 

 You thoroughly enjoyed the promotion (getting 

 83)... 

 I did, thanks to Sachins presence 

 at the other end... He guided me on the strengths of the 

 bowlers and the shots I should go for... He made me feel 

 so comfortable. 

 Did you become conscious you were approaching 

 a hundred? 

 To an extent... At the same time, I knew 

 if it had to happen, it would. Im not disappointed 

 that I fell 17 short. 

 In the next ODI (Mohali), you had a blast with 

 the ball (MoM with four for 37). Now, are you worried that 

 the pressure is going to be more? 

 Ill be inviting pressure if I keep 

 thinking about it... Today, I dont see myself as an 

 allrounder. My primary job is to get wickets and most of 

 the effort is going to go towards bowling. To become an 

 allrounder, I guess one needs five-six years of international 

 experience. I havent even completed two years... I 

 need to have my feet on the ground and get over my limitations. 

 I dont look at the mirror and tell myself that Ive 

 already become an allrounder. 

 What have you learnt from Adelaide (debut Test, 

 in December 2003) till Jaipur? 

 That success doesnt come easy... 

 That cricket is a hard game and doesnt offer guarantees... 

 At the end of last season, I even got dropped... 

 Did that teach you something? 

 That there are no guarantees and I need 

 to know my body and own form well. 

 Your debut was under Sourav Ganguly. Now, the 

 captaincy has gone to Rahul Dravid. Does the comfort level 

 vary with a change at the top? 

 I think every Indian bowler gets the field 

 he desires... Sourav did a wonderful job in the past and 

 Rahul is doing a wonderful job now... I havent had 

 a problem with either. 

 Has any batsman dented you confidence? 

 Look, I dont think too much about 

 any batsman... If I do, then my game is bound to get affected. 

 I back myself but, yes, if Im not bowling well then 

 even a No. 11 will hit me for a straight drive. 

 Surely, life has changed in the past two years... 

 Big time... Its difficult going to 

 all the places I want to... Its not that big a problem 

 in Mumbai and Bangalore, but Ive lost the freedom 

 to move about in the other cities... At home, however, Im 

 still the same Irfan... I continue to trouble my mother... 

 Could even more success go to your head? 

 It wont... First, because of my family 

 and, secondly, my close friends circle. 

 Today, are you indebted to anybody more than 

 the rest? 

 (Emotionally) The late Bashir Sheikh, 

 my coach and mentor... Hes no more, but remains alive 

 in my heart... Also, the Baroda Sports Club... Actually, 

 a lot of people have helped me in different stages of my 

 career... (Chief selector) Kiran More, I remember, gave 

 me a pair of boots when I was 14... I still have those... 

 John Wright remembers you with affection... 

 Its mutual and I cant forget 

 him... He helped me not get carried away... Told me what 

 to expect as an India player and what to do and what not 

 to do... He made me tough mentally... John will always be 

 special. 

 The last question: You must be excited that 

 the last match of this series is in Vadodara, your hometown... 

 Absolutely... The squad hasnt yet 

 been picked, but God willing, Im going to be in the 

 XV... Im also concerned, though: How will I oblige 

 so many well-wishers with complimentaries!

Chennai: India went down tamely as Australia won 4-1, scoring all their goals in the first 20 minutes, in a third-round league match of the Champions Trophy hockey tournament at the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium here Tuesday. 

The hosts had raised visions of a good performance after their stunning come-from-behind 3-2 win over arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday, but their hopes lay shattered with the Australian blitzkrieg sweeping them off their feet. 

India, who suffered their second defeat in three matches after their 1-2 loss to Spain, found the consolation goal through Tushar Khandekar in the 31st minute. But they could do little thereafter against their stronger opponent. 

The defeat also virtually shattered Indias hopes of a podium finish since the 1982 edition. But they still have a chance if they win both their next matches against the Netherlands and Germany. 

Striker Nathan Eglington, who scored a brace, opened the floodgates in the first minute and scored his second goal in the 14th minute while Dean Butler (12th) and Travis Brooks (20th) sealed Indias fate. 

It was total domination by the Olympic champions who had a different plan for the Indians as compared to their games against Netherlands and Spain in the previous league matches. 

Staying on course for an all-win record in the six-team league phase, the Aussies, eyeing to regain the title which they last won in 1999, put the Indian midfielders in total disarray with their crowding tactics in the first 20 minutes of play. 

Indian coach Rajinder Singh and captain Gagan Ajit Singhs pre-match plans to slow down the Australians also failed to take off as the latter hardly gave any opportunity to do so. 

The sheer pace of the Australians came to the fore in the very first minute of the match as they surprised the Indians with one of the fastest goals. The Aussies Olympic hero Jamie Dwyer gave a good cross and Eglington sounded the board as the crowd went silent. 

Even before the Indians could recover from the early shock, the Australians increased the lead with Dean Butler doing the scoring from the left with a reverse flick after a combined move with Michael McCann. 

Just two minutes later, Eglington scored his second and the teams third with a superb solo effort as custodian Adrian DSouza could do little once again. 

Travis Brooks took the match further away from India scoring the fourth goal with DSouza charging out only to miss. 

The margin of loss for India would have been much higher but for Bharat Chetri, who replaced DSouza in the 21st minute. Chetri effected a diving clearance of a rasping shot from Brooks from a close range in the 60th minute. 

Trailing 0-4 and after failing to make use of their lone penalty corner in the first half, the Indians however managed to salvage some pride in the half when Tushar Khandekar sounded the board. 

Earlier, seven-time winners Netherlands withstood a late charge by holders Spain to carve out a thrilling 3-2 win. 

The Dutch were leading 3-0 till the 60th minute but allowed their rivals to score two quick goals in the 60th and 64th minutes and conceded a penalty corner in the last minute. 

However, Spain failed to convert the chance to suffer their second loss in three matches. For Netherlands it was their second win in the elite six-nation tournament.

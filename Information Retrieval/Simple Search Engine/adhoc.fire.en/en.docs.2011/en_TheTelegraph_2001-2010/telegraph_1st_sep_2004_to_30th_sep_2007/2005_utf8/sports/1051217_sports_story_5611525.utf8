Perth: South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini ripped through Australias fragile middle-order to skittle them for 258 on the opening day of the first Test at the WACA on Friday. 

Ntini (five for 64) removed the Australian openers Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer then added the scalps of Brad Hodge, Mike Hussey and Adam Gilchrist to complete his first five-wicket haul against the world champions. 

South Africas openers Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers consolidated their teams position by surviving a hostile 34-minute spell from Australias fast bowlers to reach the close on 38 without loss. 

Smith was unbeaten on 18 and De Villiers on 14 with the tourists 220 runs behind and in a strong position. 

Pacer Andre Nel (three for 29) dismissed Andrew Symonds, then Nathan Bracken and Glenn McGrath in successive balls to be on a second innings hattrick while Shaun Pollock and Charl Langeveldt chipped in with one wicket each. 

Ricky Ponting top scored with 71 from 107 balls while Hodge (41) and Langer (37) both made solid starts before the tourists rattled the Australians on a typically lively WACA pitch. 

Ntinis first three victims, Hayden, Langer and Hussey, were all caught trying to pull good length balls that lifted sharply while Hodge and Gilchrist were both caught after misjudging the bounce. 

Ntini broke through in the second over of the day when Hayden skied a catch to Jacques Rudolph in the slips cordon for a duck, but Ponting and Langer steadied the Australian innings with a second-wicket partnership of 111.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 United top money list, Real 2nd

 Chelsea ballooned on Abramovich largesse 

Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal could soon be the three richest clubs in Europe, putting the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona in the shade, a leading accountancy firm predicted Wednesday. 

Deloitte?s eighth Money League, covering the 2003-04 season, underlined the financial power of the Premier League, with eight clubs featuring in the top 20. The two Glasgow giants, Rangers and Celtic, also featured. 

United, a target for American businessman Malcolm Glazer, are already Europe?s richest club, having generated ? 171.5 million in the 2003-04 season, despite a slight fall in income and a disappointing season in which they finished third and were eliminated in the first knockout stage of the Champions League. 

Chelsea, fuelled by Roman Abramovich?s riches, took fourth, behind Real Madrid and AC Milan. However, the club earned ? 143.7 million, which made them ? along with Barcelona ? the fastest movers in the financial chart. 

Despite having only a 42,500-seat stadium, Chelsea leapt six places. 

?Chelsea will not think that future overall leadership is beyond them,? Deloitte said. 

The coffers were fuelled by reaching the Champions League semi-final and the ability of fans to dig deeper than any other club?s. Average matchday income per fan was ? 1,351 over the season. 

Arsenal?s triumphant season, in which they went unbeaten, earned ? 115 million and enabled them to climb from seventh to sixth place in the European money league. 

All three clubs seemed set fair for further progress, the accountants said. ?With Chelsea?s success and Arsenal?s Emirates Stadium development, we can foresee a scenario where English clubs fill the top three places in the 2006-07 Money League.? 

Other English clubs whose on-field achievements were decidedly modest, nevertheless fared well when it came to making money. 

Liverpool, who earned ? 92.3 million, clung on to their top-10 place, even though income fell by seven per cent. They should maintain their position this season, having qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League. 

Newcastle United?s long-suffering supporters enabled the club to earn ? 90.5 million, for 11th place. A successful new kit launch and sell-out 52,000 crowds ensured the books remained healthy. 

Despite another season of footballing mediocrity, Tottenham Hotspur took 14th place in the rich league, earning ? 66.3 million in 2003-4. Spurs supporters will doubtless be heartened to know that the club displayed a willingness to ?embrace good business principles in generating revenues?. 

Tottenham raised ? 15 million from a share issue, but the accountants sounded a note of caution. ?This investment will need to deliver on the pitch if Spurs are to move towards the upper reaches of the Money League.? 

Thanks to their move to a new stadium, Manchester City reached the top 20 for the first time. A 35 per cent attendance increase and doubling of match-day income brought earnings of ? 61.9 million. 

Aston Villa entered the top 20 for the first time, after earning ? 55.9 million. Deloitte added that Villa would have to secure regular European football to hold their place. 

Real Madrid halved the gap on United in a season. The Spaniards made ? 56.9 million from commercial income alone. How much of that was due to David Beckham replica shirts was not disclosed. 

Barcelona soared six places into seventh, quite a feat given their refusal to carry a sponsor?s name on their shirt. 

Nevertheless, sponsorship will remain a huge source of income, with football giants holding the whip hand in deals with ?corporate partners?, according to Deloitte.

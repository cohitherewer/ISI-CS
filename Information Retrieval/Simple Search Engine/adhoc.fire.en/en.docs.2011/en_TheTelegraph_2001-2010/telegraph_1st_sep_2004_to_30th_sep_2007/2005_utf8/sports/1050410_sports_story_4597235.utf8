 Orissa bow to Bahutule

Mumbai: Captain Sairaj Bahutule?s allround show helped holders Mumbai whip Orissa by 158 runs in the quarter final of the inter state all-India one-day knockout meet at the Wankhede on Saturday. 

Bahutule played a cameo worth an unbeaten 42 off only 27 balls after a firm foundation was laid by opener Wasim Jaffer and Amol Muzumdar, both of whom slammed half tons, in Mumbai?s tall score of 289 for four after being put in. 

The allrounder also put on an unfinished stand of 86 runs in the last ten overs with Vinit Indulkar, who too remained not out on 62 with four fours. 

Later Bahutule spun a web around the middle and lower order batsmen of Orissa to bowl them out for 131 in 33.1 overs.

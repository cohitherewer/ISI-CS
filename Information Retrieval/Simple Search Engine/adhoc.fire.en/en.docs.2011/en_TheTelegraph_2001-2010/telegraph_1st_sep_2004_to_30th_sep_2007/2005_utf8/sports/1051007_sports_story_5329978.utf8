The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nayeem to meet AIFF chief today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Newly-appointed Indian football coach Syed Nayeemuddin will take up the issue of players release from different clubs with AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi for the national camp he intends to hold at the earliest. 

I will speak to the president on Friday and will send requests to the respective clubs via the AIFF to release their players for national duty, he said on Thursday. 

Nayeem reiterated that at least a two-week camp is necessary, followed by exposure trips to China and Korea. 

I will ask for fit players and whoever is hundred percent fit will be in my scheme of things? Names dont matter at all, the coach said. 

He feels that a thorough preparation is necessary to perform well in the forthcoming SAFF Cup. Bangladesh started their camp a fortnight back under an Argentine coach, so we have to get cracking immediately, he quipped. 

I will inquire about Ashim Biswas, Deepak Mondal, Sandip Nandy and others who have it in them to perform at the highest level, he said.

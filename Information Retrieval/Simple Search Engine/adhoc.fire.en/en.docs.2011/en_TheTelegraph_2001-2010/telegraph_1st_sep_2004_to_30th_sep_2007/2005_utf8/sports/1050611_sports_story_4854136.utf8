 Narain put on notice by Jordan

Montreal: Indias first Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan has been told to raise his game by the Jordan team. 

We are all aware that the drivers are rookies, said team boss Colin Kolles at the Canadian Grand Prix Friday. I was not very happy with the performance of Narain in Monte Carlo, I was not very happy with his performance at Nuerburgring. He knows this, I told him this. 

Neither Karthikeyan nor Portugals Tiago Monteiro has scored a point yet in seven races for a team struggling at the back of the grid, although Monteiro has managed to get to the finish every time. 

Karthikeyan failed to finish in Monaco and came home 16th at the last European Grand Prix behind his teammate after outperforming Monteiro in the opening two races. 

The Indian has also been outqualified by Monteiro in the last two Grands Prix. At the beginning Tiago was a little bit behind Narain, now Tiago is doing a better job, said Kolles. 

I think both drivers are not as bad as they look. We have to give them a better car and then they will look much better. We are realistic enough to know that the car is not a good car, you can see it on the track. 

While Karthikeyan has no previous experience of Montreals Gilles Villeneuve circuit, Monteiro has driven there before during his time in the US ChampCar series. 

I think he is putting himself a little bit too much under pressure and he is a little bit overdriving the car, Kolles said of Karthikeyan. This is what I hear from the engineering side. I hope that it will improve. 

Kolles believed Karthikeyan, who brings useful sponsorship from an important market for Formula One, had a future with the team that will change its name to Midland next season. There were plenty of candidates, however. We are speaking to several drivers, he said. 

Kolles said the Toyota-powered team were also close to announcing an engine deal for 2006, possibly within days. 

I think we are happy, they are happy, he said when asked whether Toyota were likely to continue their partnership. 

Karthikeyan, meanwhile, believes that his week-long stress-relieving session in the wilds ahead of Canada will bolster the teams prospects of collecting some points. 

I know that the circuit has been quite successful in the past for the team where they scored their first ever Formula One world championship points in their history. It is also kind of a home race for the team with the team owner being from Canada. The serious business will begin tomorrow on the track, Karthikeyan said on Thursday. 

He said the circuit was everyones favourite, but his team concentrated on being relaxed for the eighth race of the season here. I landed Sunday and we travelled two hours north-east from Montreal to Lake Sacacomie (Lanaudiere) with Tiago and our trainer Gerard Gray. 

It was very wild up there. A great place for wild animals. We even saw black bears and beavers. Dont speak about mosquitoes to Tiago Monteiro. My skin may be more resistant than his.

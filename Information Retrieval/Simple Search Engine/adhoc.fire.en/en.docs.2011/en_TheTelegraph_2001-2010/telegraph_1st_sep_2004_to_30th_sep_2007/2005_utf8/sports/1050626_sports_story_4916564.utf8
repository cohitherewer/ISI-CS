 Johl in tied 6th after Round III

Bandar Seri Begawan: Amandeep Johl bounced back with a three-under 68 in the third round to climb to tied sixth spot and move into contention for his first top-10 finish of the year in the inaugural $300,000 Brunei Open. 

Johl, who was 17th after two rounds, is eight-under 205 for the tournament. The Indian is seven shots behind leader Terry Pilkadaris (Australia). He grabbed the third round lead at a battling three-under-par 68. 

Pilkadaris edged ahead by one stroke with his three-day total of 15-under-par 198 at the par-71 Empire Hotel and Country Club. Compatriot Jarrod Lyle carded a 69 for second place while overnight leader Danny Chia of Malaysia stumbled to a 72 for third position, three shots behind the leader. 

Though Johl is best placed among six Indians, the days best card came from former Indian Open champion Firoz Ali, who shot a four-under 67. It could have been even better but for a bogey on the final hole. 

At six-under 206, Firoz is now tied 15th, while Gaurav Ghei and Ashok Kumar brought home par rounds and are tied 27th at four-under. Uttam Singh Mundy played his third straight par round to be at tied 49th, while Digvijay Singh slipped with a seven-over 78 to be tied 68th. 

Johl had two birdies on the front nine on third and fourth but dropped a shot on seventh. He picked up a birdie on 12th, but gave it back on 14th, before getting his concentration together again to birdie the 15th and 18th. 

Firoz looked set for a brilliant card as he was four-under after seven holes and rapidly climbing up the leaderboard. Then he dropped a shot on the ninth, but still came back with birdies on 12th and 16th. Just then on the final hole, he dropped one more for a four-under 67. (PTI)

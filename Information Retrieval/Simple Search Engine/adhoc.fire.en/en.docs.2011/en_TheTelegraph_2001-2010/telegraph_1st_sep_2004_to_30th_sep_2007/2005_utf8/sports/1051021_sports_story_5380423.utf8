 Cristiano gets bail

London: Manchester United footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was on Wednesday arrested on suspicion of raping a woman at a London hotel earlier this month. 

He was subsequently released on bail. A Scotland Yard spokesman said last night: The man in his 20s has been bailed pending further inquiries to return at a future date. 

Two women had alleged that Ronaldo and another man took them back to a penthouse suite in Sanderson Hotel in London on October 2 after they met at a nightspot. 

The attack is alleged to have happened in the hotel. 

Ronaldo was said to have gone voluntarily to the police station in Manchester with his lawyer to attend an appointment with detectives. 

The 20-year-old Portuguese international told officers that he was completely innocent. 

Ronaldo was arrested by officers from Scotland Yards Operation Sapphire team, which investigates sex crime, and who travelled up to Manchester to speak to him. 

Ronaldo has told friends that he is the victim of a stitch-up.

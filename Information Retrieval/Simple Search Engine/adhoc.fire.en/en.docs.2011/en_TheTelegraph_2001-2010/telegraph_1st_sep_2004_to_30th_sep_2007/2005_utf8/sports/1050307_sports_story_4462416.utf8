 Randhawa finishes 11th 

Dubai: Ernie Els won an unprecedented third Dubai Desert Classic in dramatic style Sunday, holing an eagle putt from 18 feet at the last for a one-shot victory. South Africas world number three, who went into the final round a stroke behind leader Miguel Angel Jimenez, fired a four-under-par 68 to finish at 19-under 269 on a sweltering day at the Emirates Golf Club. 

India?s Jyoti Randhawa also fared well, finishing tied at 11th spot with four others, following a fine fourth round of 67. That was extraordinary, seen in the backdrop of his first three round scores of 72, 68 and 71. Randhawa?s final round was bogey-free, and with birdies on the third, eighth, 13th, 15th and 18th holes. 

Jimenez, the European Tour?s form player last year with five victories, had stretched his advantage to two with nine holes remaining but stumbled with a bogey-six at the 13th.

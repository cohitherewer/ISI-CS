The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania awaits just another match

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Teenage sensation Sania Mirza was, as expected, short on time after her stunning progress into the pre-quarters of the US Open. However, she responded to questions from The Telegraph, on Friday night. 

Over to Sania: 

I am, obviously, extremely happy ? Today I was, by far, the better player and my progress was effortless. However, I always take one match at a time ? The next, too, will just be another one. 

No, I am not intimidated at the prospect of an expected showdown with Maria Sharapova (in the pre-quarters) ? She may be the top seed and world No. 1, but I will ? as always ? try to deliver. 

Yes, I have been slightly hampered by injuries, yet I have no choice but to make the best of the circumstances. 

How do I intend celebrating my best-ever Grand Slam performance? By resting and, of course, focusing on the next match. Thats all.

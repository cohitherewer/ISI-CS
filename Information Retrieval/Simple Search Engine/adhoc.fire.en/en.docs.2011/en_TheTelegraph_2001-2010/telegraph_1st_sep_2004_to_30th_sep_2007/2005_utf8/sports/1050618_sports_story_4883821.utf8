 Montoya willing to help Kimi win title

 Juan Pablo Montoya 

Indianapolis: Juan Pablo Montoya has said he is prepared to personally help McLaren teammate Kimi Raikkonen to win the world title if he is in the position to do so later this year. 

Colombian Montoya has fallen further out of the championship chase after being disqualified from a possible victory at last weekend?s Canadian Grand Prix and is currently 21 points behind second-placed Raikkonen. 

But championship leader Fernando Alonso, of Renault, has a 22-point advantage over Raikkonen and Montoya has promised to help his teammate overhaul his rival once he is out of the chase himself. 

?If I am mathematically out of the points then it would be case of working with the team,? said Montoya. ?But the rules say that there are no team orders so I think if that would happen it would be my decision. 

?I?m pretty clear on what we have to do. I still believe I have a chance for the championship, but you?ve got to be realistic to know when it stops and if this year means helping Kimi, then that?s what it?s going to be. 

?If I need to help Kimi then at the end of the year, because I had my injury and all the bad luck I?ve been having, it doesn?t mean I?m going to be out of the championship next year.? 

Montoya joined McLaren this season from Williams having won his last race for his former team in Brazil but he has failed to find the groove with his new team having suffered a series of misfortunes since the start of the year. 

He missed two races in Bahrain and San Marino after injuring his shoulder in a sporting accident and has struggled to find his form since returning from his spell on the sidelines. 

This weekend?s US Grand Prix will see him racing in front of his strong following of Colombian fans and he insists he can still fight back and pull himself into the championship race. 

?We still have quite a few races and I think I have got the pace to close the points on Fernando and Kimi,? he said. ?I am not too bothered about that to be honest.? 

But Montoya suffered a difficult start to the north American back-to-back races last weekend in Canada when he missed out on victory after being called into the pits too late by his team. 

Montoya was left out on track when the safety car came out following an accident and the team brought in Raikkonen instead, effectively handing him the lead and, ultimately, the win. 

The enraged Colombian driver was then disqualified when he shot out of the pits past the red stop lights but after post-race discussions with team boss Ron Dennis he is focussed again this weekend. 

?Ron came to me through the race, when I got out of the race and he actually came to my hotel room that night to apologise for what happened,? said Montoya. 

?I?m pretty confident the team is a hundred per cent behind me.?

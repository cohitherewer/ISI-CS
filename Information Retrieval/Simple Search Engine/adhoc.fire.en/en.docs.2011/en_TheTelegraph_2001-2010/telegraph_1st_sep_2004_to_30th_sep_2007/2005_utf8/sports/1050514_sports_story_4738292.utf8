Hamburg: World No. 1 Roger Federer swept through to the Hamburg Masters semi-finals with a resilient 6-4, 7-6 victory over Argentinas Guillermo Coria on Friday. 

The 23-year-old top seed, who also beat Coria in last years Hamburg final, was a break down in both sets and behind in the tie-break but recovered to quell the Argentine 10th seed and set up a semi-final against Russian Nikolay Davydenko. 

Federer, who will be attempting to win the only Grand Slam title missing from his collection at the French Open starting in 10 days, wowed the Rothenbaum crowd with some breathtaking groundstrokes on a sun-kissed centre court. 

Having trailed 3-1, the Swiss wrested the initiative from last years French Open runner-up, flourishing his backhand to devastating effect. He forced the decisive break at 5-4 when Coria twice hit forehands out to lose the set. 

The second set was interrupted with Coria trailing 2-3 for five minutes after a spectator apparently fell ill in the stands and the incident seemed to break Federers concentration. 

A careless forehand gave Coria break point and, riding his luck, the Argentine mishit a forehand on to the line to break and he held serve to lead 5-3. 

Federer, though, broke straight back to force the tie-break, which he took 7-3 after overturning a 0-2 deficit as Coria, who lost in five sets in the Rome final last Sunday, lost his nerve under pressure. 

Federer has now won 39 of his 41 matches this year and together with Rafael Nadal is the favourite for the French Open crown. 

Davydenko, the world No. 20, overcame Italys Filippo Volandri 7-6, 6-4. 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic notched up a fine 6-4, 6-2 win over Swiss pair Roger Federer and Yves Allegro to enter the quarter finals. 

The sixth-seeded Indo-Serbian duo will next meet No. 3 Bob and Mike Bryan, the team they bowed to last week at the Rome Masters.

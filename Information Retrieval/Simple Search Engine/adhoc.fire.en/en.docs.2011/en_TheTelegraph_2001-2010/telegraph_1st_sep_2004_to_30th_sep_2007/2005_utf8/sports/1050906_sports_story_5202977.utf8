 Yadav find of the series: Sourav

 - Well try to exploit top orders lack of confidence: Fleming 

 Yadav has lent balance to the side, feels Sourav 

Harare: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has asked his players to put their poor record in recent one-day International finals behind them when they face New Zealand at Harare Sports Club on Tuesday. 

Our record in finals is an issue were trying to forget? Tomorrow is a new start, Sourav said on Monday. 

Instead of worrying and worrying, I would ask my boys to treat it as just another game. We have to take the situation of a final out of our heads. 

The guys must just go out and play tomorrow like any other game. Weve been playing well, we must do nothing different, Sourav asserted. 

Sourav had special praise for Jai Prakash Yadav. 

He obviously has been the find of the series. He has bowled, batted and fielded well. But whosoever is picked for India has to do it over a period of time and we feel he has the ability to do it, he said. 

Sourav accepted the importance of his own return to batting form in Tuesdays final, along with that of fellow opener Virender Sehwag. 

Its not easy at the top because the ball seams around and youre up against the new ball, but me and Sehwag just have to fire at the top. 

We both need time at the wicket and we need to settle down against the hard ball. 

Fast bowler Shane Bond took six for 19 as India plummeted to 44 for eight, but was rested for last weeks game in Harare. 

Bond has gone through their top order and I know Id be pretty anxious about facing him if I were the Indian top-order tomorrow, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said on Monday. 

Well try to play on that little lack of confidence at the top of their batting order and Shane will be a threat even on a flat pitch because hes fast and he swings the ball. 

Its a dangerous thing, however, to say theyre lacking confidence with such quality players at the top of the order. Theyre very naturally talented, so well need early wickets, Fleming added. 

He conceded that India had been doing well under pressure, but said the three-day break would work in his favour. 

Indias win against Zimbabwe was a good dress-rehearsal, but it is an advantage to have the three-day break and we would be fresh for it (the final), he added.

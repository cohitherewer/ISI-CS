 Wilson named in NZ squad

 Jeff Wilson 

Wellington: Former rugby international Jeff Wilson has been included in the New Zealand squad for Thursday?s historic Twenty20 match against Australia in Auckland. 

Wilson was named in a 13-man squad captained by Stephen Fleming to play the Australians in the first 20-overs-a-side match between two international sides. 

Wilson, 31, played the last of his four one-day matches for New Zealand in 1993 before quitting to concentrate on rugby after being picked for the All Blacks. 

In a brilliant career as a winger and fullback, Wilson played 60 Tests for New Zealand before hanging up his boots in 2002 to return to cricket. 

He resumed in domestic first-class competition but caught the eye with an impressive performance for New Zealand in last month?s exhibition series against a World XI. 

New Zealand coach John Bracewell said Wilson?s inclusion was part of a strategy to use as many players as possible over the next few months with the Black caps due to play five one-dayers and three Tests against Australia then two Tests against Sri Lanka. 

?This is an exceptional season now, playing five one-dayers and then five Tests on the trot, there?ll be some attrition and we?re going to end up using some resources,? he said. ?We?ve got to be quite careful and it may need some changes from time to time.? 

Bracewell said the rotation policy, which has been successfully used by depth-laden Australia, was necessary in such a packed season. 

It was first tried with caution on the October tour of Bangladesh when Jacob Oram, currently sidelined with a back stress injury, and captain Stephen Fleming were rested. 

?It?s a little bit harder to make that gutsy decision to rest one of your vital players when you?re playing No. 1 in the world,? Bracewell said. ?It?s a big dilemma for us.?

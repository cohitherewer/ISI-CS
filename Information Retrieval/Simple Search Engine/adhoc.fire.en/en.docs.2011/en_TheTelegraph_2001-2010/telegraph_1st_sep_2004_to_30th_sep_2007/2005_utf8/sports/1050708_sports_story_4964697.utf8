Calcutta: There was no stopping Karnataka as they scooped up as many as 11 golds out of a possible 18 on the concluding day of the junior age-group aquatic championships at Subhas Sarobar on Thursday. But Lekha Kamat of Maharashtra stole the show with three golds and two new meet records. 

It was an outright challenge from the 14-year-old to the overwhelming Karnataka domination in the meet. In the morning she helped her state bag gold in the girls group II 4x200m freestyle, in which Bengal finished a distant fifth. A few hours later, in her pet butterfly event, she was simply unstoppable. 

Lekha first went on to win 50m butterfly at 29.83, erasing on the way Karnataka rival C. Shubhas record of 30.79. She then stamped her class in that particular swimming style, winning the 100m event with a new record timing of 1.02.11, which was 2.02-second improvement on his own mark, set last year. 

Shubha, on the other hand, also won three golds, but Lekhas two record-breaking performances clearly put her on a special pedestal. 

In all, 40 meet records were broken during the championships, and 25 of them were done by the girls. 

Bengal, who failed to make any podium finish in individual and relay events, finally managed a gold in waterpolo. In the final, the boys were trailing 1-2 against Maharashtra before staged a remarkable comeback to notch up a 6-3 victory. Babu Naiya and Pronob Das ? both were selected among Indian probables for the next months Asian age-group meet (in Bangkok) ? scored three goals each for the host state. Babu was also adjudged the best player in waterpolo (boys) event. 

Bengal girls, on the other hand, went down 1-4 to Karnataka in the third-place match. 

Karnataka emerged overall champions in all four divisions (Boys and Girls I amp; II). While Rohit R. Hawaldar and Aaron DSouza bagged the best individual player awards in Boys I and II categories, respectively, the Girls I and II honours went to Pooja R. Alva and Lekha.

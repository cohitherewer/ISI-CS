 Anwar hails dawn of new era in Pakistan 

 Anwar says Pakistan have shown a lot of character 

Karachi: Former Pakistan players feel the ODI series victory in India will start a new era in Pakistan cricket but feared the beginning of the end of Sachin Tendulkar?s illustrious career. 

?Pakistan are no more a one-man team. You had Younis Khan marshalling troops when Inzamam-ul Haq was in the dressing room, you had Rana Naved-ul Hasan excelling on docile pitches in the absence of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami and finally you developed six excellent batsmen from Shahid Afridi and down. 

?I think this is an excellent combination and from now, this team should only improve,? said 35-year-old Basit Ali, who scored 858 runs in 19 Tests and 1,265 runs in 50 ODIs. 

?This (tour) has to be the start of Pakistan?s preparations and build-up for the 2007 World Cup.? 

He added: ?I think this series marks the beginning of the end of Sachin?s career. He got some runs but clearly lacked in confidence and his usual near-perfect stroke selection was also poor. In this series, he was a shadow of the Sachin we know. Maybe Pakistan planned well but Sachin was unable to get out of the web like he has done in the past when he countered all gameplans against him.? 

Sachin scored a century in the Ahmedabad game but could muster only 124 runs in the entire ODI series with four single-digit scores. In the Test series, Sachin aggregated 255 but failed to record the landmark 35th century. 

Former captain Saeed Anwar said Pakistan had shown a lot of character in bouncing back in the mother of all series, after having being thrashed on the previous tour (to Australia). 

?Playing back-to-back tough away series and performing in the testing second series after a disastrous previous tour, clearly indicates that Pakistan cricket is on the rise and maybe it?s the start of a new era,? he said. 

?Having played for nearly two decades, I know it is next to impossible for any team to bounce back from a nightmarish Australian tour and perform on the next demanding tour which was India in this case. But this Pakistan team has shown true character, fighting spirit, discipline and potential which are signs of a team that will be a force to be reckoned with in days to come,? said Anwar, who still owns the world record for the highest ODI score (194). 

He felt Pakistan are a better one-day team. ?As soon as they find a good opening pair that provides solid starts, I?m sure they will be a hard nut to crack in Tests as well. The key to this success in India has been perseverance and continuity with the right talent.? 

Aaqib Javed, a critic of Inzamam?s team, was gracious in acknowledging their achievement. ?We have to give credit where it is due. 

?We had been harsh and severe on Inzamam, but with his dynamic leadership, he has succeeded in taking this young team to new heights. Inzamam has led the team from the front and by example. I think he and Bob Woolmer have struck the right combination,? said Javed, who took a hattrick against India in his haul of seven for 37 in 1991 in Sharjah. 

Javed felt Pakistan were now a complete team. ?They have won without top pacers Shoaib, Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul. Even Sami was out of the last two games. They now have a bench strength that will make them even more dangerous side. 

?I think the difference in this series was that Pakistan produced collective performances while the Indians relied on Virender Sehwag,? Javed remarked. (PTI)

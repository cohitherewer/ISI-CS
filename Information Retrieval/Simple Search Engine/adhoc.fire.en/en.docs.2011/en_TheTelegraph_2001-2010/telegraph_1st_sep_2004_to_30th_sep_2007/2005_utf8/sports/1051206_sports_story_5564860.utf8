 London: McLaren?s Kimi Raikkonen has been crowned International Racing Driver of the Year by a British magazine despite being beaten to the Formula One title by Renault?s Fernando Alonso. The Finn was presented with his trophy at an awards ceremony in London on Sunday by Britain?s 1992 world champion Nigel Mansell.

 ?I know what it is like to be a bridesmaid,? said Mansell, who finished championship runner-up three times before eventually taking the title with Williams. ?I think it is just a question of time. He is a future world champion.?

 Raikkonen, 26, has finished overall runner-up twice since his debut in 2001 ? to Ferrari?s Michael Schumacher in 2003 and this year to 24-year-old Spaniard Alonso. 

 Vatican City: The chairman of Ferrari on Tuesday presented Pope Benedict XVI with a cheque for euro 950,000 ($1.1 million) for charity and the steering wheel of a Michael Schumacher racing car.

 Ferrari said chairman Luca di Montezemolo kept a promise he made to the Pope John Paul II during an audience in January that a specially constructed 400th car of the Enzo Ferrari series would be auctioned off for charity.

 Melbourne: Australian domestic cricket will enter the Twenty20 revolution with the ominously named ?Big Bash? tournament starting January 6. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said the 20-over each innings competition was the biggest innovation in domestic cricket since the introduction of limited-overs competitions in 1969-70.

 Milan: Former AC Milan and Italy midfielder Demetrio Albertini announced his retirement as a player on Monday, saying he intended to study to become a coach.

 Albertini was part of the successful AC Milan side of the early 1990s, winning five Serie A titles and the 1994 European Cup. He also won 79 caps for Italy.

 ?After a career like mine, I think it is inevitable that I will study to be a coach,? said Albertini, who played under Fabio Capello and Arrigo Sacchi at Milan.

 The central midfielder spent the second half of last season with Spanish side Barcelona but made just five league appearances and he has been without a club since. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Paysandu coach Carlos Alberto launched another of his familiar tirades on Sunday when he insulted the referee and blamed his team?s relegation on a conspiracy.

 The 1970 World Cup winning captain, who as Azerbaijan coach made an attack on Michael Owen earlier this year, was sent off as Paysandu crashed 1-4 to Flamengo in their Brazilian championship game.

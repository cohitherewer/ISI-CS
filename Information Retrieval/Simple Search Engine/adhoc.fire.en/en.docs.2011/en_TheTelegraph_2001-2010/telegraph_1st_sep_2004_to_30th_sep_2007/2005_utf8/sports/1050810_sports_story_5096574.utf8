 New role for Rod Marsh

Sydney: Former Australia wicketkeeper Rod Marsh has accepted a coaching role with the South Australia Cricket Association, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Tuesday. 

Marsh is returning to Australia in September after four years as the head of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) academy which helped mould several of the current side playing in the Ashes series against Australia. 

Prior to joining the England academy, he was head of the Australian academy from 1991-2001, overseeing players such as Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee, when it was based in Adelaide. 

Marshs new role will see him work with South Australias elite and junior squads, CA said in a statement on their website. 

Meanwhile, former Australian allrounder Ian Harvey, now playing for English county side Yorkshire, has been cleared to play cricket in South Africa next season.

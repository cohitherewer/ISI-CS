 Sourav signs off with 55 

London: Sourav Gangulys half century could not stop Glamorgans spiral towards defeat in the County Championship Division I tie against Middlesex in Cardiff on Saturday. 

Souravs 92-ball 55 with 10 fours propped up the hosts second innings after they had slipped to 153 for four. Then Sourav added 53 runs for the fifth wicket with Mike Powell (unbeaten on 55) before falling leg before to New Zealand bowler Scott Styris on Day III of the four-dayer. 

Glamorgan, following on were 240 for six in the post-tea session. They were earlier all out for 232 ? with Sourav contributing four ? in reply to Middlesexs 534 in the first innings. 

Sourav, by the way, totalled 438 in five Championship matches at an average of 62.57 with the highest being 142 versus Kent. (agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Air surveillance during Karachi Test, ODI

 - Minimum time likely to be spent in Peshawar this time too 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh go out to practise in Karachi under heavy security cover during Indias last tour two seasons ago 

Calcutta: Not wanting to leave any room for security-related misgivings, the concerned agencies have assured continuous air surveillance during the two matches scheduled to be hosted by the often troubled Karachi. 

Subject to New Delhis approval, Team India will be playing both the third and final Test as also the last (No. 5) ODI on the forthcoming tour there. 

On the previous trip, almost two years ago, India only played the first ODI in Karachi. In fact, the last Indo-Pak Test there ? Sachins debut ? was way back in November 1989. 

Besides everything on the ground, the agencies have promised constant surveillance by air. Weve taken note of that, IGP Yashovardhan Azad told The Telegraph. 

Azad, who (again) headed a joint team sent by New Delhi and the Board to assess security, returned with his boys on Thursday evening. 

He added: Despite a reduction in the threat perception and a vast improvement in bilateral relations, the agencies intend extending the same (Presidential-type) security cover as was given on the last tour. 

Azad is expected to submit his report by Friday afternoon. Much of what he says may focus on Karachi ? possibly, even Peshawar (venue of ODI No. 2). 

Significantly, Azad indicated that as in 2003-04, minimum time is to be spent in Peshawar.

Calcutta: ?Nothing is impossible,? said Mahindra United manager Henry Menzes on the sidelines of the team?s practice at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. 

This seems to be the new mantra of the Mumbai-based side as they seek the elusive National Football League title. ?We have been putting together good teams in the last couple of seasons, but we never managed to win the National League,? Menzes added. This time around, though, the team management is leaving no stones unturned. 

They have signed Dronacharya Syed Nayeemuddin as coach, besides roping in Nigerian Mike Okoro (who is expected to arrive in India this week). 

On Tuesday, they will meet Mohun Bagan in the second round of the ninth National Football League match at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

?We will have to win, we need the full three points,? Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said after the team?s training at home on Monday. 

The match is likely to be dominated by the midfield. Both teams have good players here ? 2004 national Player-of-the-Year S. Venkatesh, Jatin Singh Bisht, Steven Dias, Khalid Jamil for Mahindra and Noel Wilson, Basudeb Mondal, Dharamjit Singh and Tomba Singh for Mohun Bagan. 

But, the similarity does not end here. Lack of strikers is a problem for both. The green-and-maroon side is yet complete their foreigners? quota and will rely on Brazilian Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? to provide firepower. He will have Ashim Biswas for support. 

Mahindra, on the other hand, have managed to find three foreigners ? two Brazilians Flavio Oliviera Rodrigues and Rodrigo Callisto de Almeida (his ITC is awaited) and Okoro. Hence, Flavio will be partnered by Abhisek Yadav. 

Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan club officials have warned players from talking to the media and have threatened to deduct part of their salary if they are caught doing so. 

TEAMS 

Mohun Bagan (likely): Prasanta Dora, Dulal Biswas, Mehraj-ud-din Wadao, Eduardo Coelho, Mehtab Hussein, Tomba Singh, Basudeb Mondal, Noel Wilson, Dharamjit Singh, Ashim Biswas, Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?. 

Mahindra United (from): Sandip Nandy, Sundar Rajan, N.S. Manju, Arun Malhotra, Covan Lawrence, Debabrata Roy, Abdul Rauf, Vijit Shetty, Sur Kumar Singh, S. Venkatesh, Jatin Bisht, Steven Dias, Kulothungan, Khalid Jamil, Hekmat Singh, Jinto Jose, Flavio Oliviera Rodrigues and Abhisekh Yadav.

 Sehwag?s confident note

Mumbai: Opening batsman Virender Sehwag is confident that the Indian cricket team will do well against Pakistan in the upcoming Test and one-day series in the light of the squad?s fine display in that country last year. 

?We did very well when India visited Pakistan (last year). They are now coming to India and this time we will have the crowd behind us. There?s no reason why we should not do well,? Sehwag said here. 

?Obviously it cannot get bigger than this,? he said about the forthcoming series against Pakistan. 

The Pakistan team is set to land in India in the last week of February to play a series of three Tests and five one-day Internationals against the hosts. It will be their first visit to the country since 1999.

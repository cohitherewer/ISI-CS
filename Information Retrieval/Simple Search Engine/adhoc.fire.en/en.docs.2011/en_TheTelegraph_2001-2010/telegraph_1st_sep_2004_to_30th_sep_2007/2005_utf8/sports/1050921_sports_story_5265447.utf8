 Inzy not to go Down Under

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said on Tuesday he will not travel to Australia next month for the captains conclave and the second ICC Annual Awards function. 

I havent made up my mind about playing in the Super Series if given a late call, but I have definitely decided not to travel to Australia for the captains conference and ICC awards function. I have conveyed my decision to the concerned authorities, Inzamam said from Lahore. 

Inzamam made no secret of his displeasure after not being included in the World XI Test and ODI squads for the Super Series. Inzamams announcement came a day after the PCB said it would back the 35-year-old if he decided to skip the Australian trip. 

I dont think it would be wise to take a long flight to-and-from Sydney when the same time can be better utilised to prepare for the home series against England that is far more important than anything else at the moment, said Inzamam who will be conferred with the Sitara-e-Imtiaz, the highest civil award of Pakistan on the 58th Independence Day (August 14, 2006). 

Inzamam said it was a great honour to be nominated for three ICC awards, but didnt think he would win any. 

I dont think Ill win any award for the simple reason that if I get even one, it would be embarrassing for the selectors? I dont think the ICC would put its selectors in a situation where they would be left with no place to hide. 

Inzamam has been nominated for Player of the Year, Test Player of the Year and ODI Player of the Year awards. (PTI)

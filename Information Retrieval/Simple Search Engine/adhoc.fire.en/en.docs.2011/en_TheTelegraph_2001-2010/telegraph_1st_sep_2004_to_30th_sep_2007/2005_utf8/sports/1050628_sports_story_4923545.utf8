 Harrington lords it over Furyk

 - Irishman lands 65-foot eagle putt to claim title

 Padraig Harrington with the trophy in Harrison on Sunday 

Harrison: Walking off the 12th green at Westchester Country Club on Sunday afternoon, Padraig Harrington, who had bogeyed his last two holes, looked over his shoulder at the leader board. 

Earlier, he had been tied for the lead with Jim Furyk in the Barclays Classic, but now he trailed by three shots. Harrington smiled. 

I was thinking that my tournament is over, he said later. But with my family situation and everything that has gone on in the last couple of tough months, Ive been trying to lighten up and enjoy things more. 

Two days after Harringtons first PGA Tour victory, at the Honda Classic in March, he was told that his father, Paddy, had cancer of the esophagus. 

What can I say, its terminal, Padraig said on Sunday of his fathers condition. 

About 90 minutes after he left the 12th hole, Harrington was again tied for the tournament lead. He stood over a 65-foot uphill eagle putt that would break twice as it traversed nearly the entire 18th green. 

I was just hoping to two-putt, Harrington said. 

But his putt rolled over the green with perfect pace, broke several feet to the right, then about a foot to the left and dropped directly into the centre of the hole. 

Harringtons three on the par-5 18th dropped him to 10-under-par 274 and gave him a one-stroke victory over Furyk. And it had the gallery at the final hole serenading Harrington as if he were at a European soccer match. 

The response in Harringtons native Ireland might have been much the same. 

They would have had it televised and watched it to the end, said Harrington, who shot a 1-under 70 for the round. Lots of cheering. 

Of his father at home in Dublin, Harrington said: Hes going to be thrilled. He was given only a couple of weeks back in March, so Im sure hes glad he hung around this long. Its good that hes managed one more win anyway. 

Harringtons comeback at the Barclays Classic was actually his second rally of the day. He was also three strokes behind Furyk after a double bogey on the third hole. He climbed back into a tie with a birdie at No. 7 and an eagle on No. 9. 

But Furyks consistency trumped Harringtons resilience once again. 

While Furyk was making pars at the 11th and 12th holes, Harrington was making mistakes. A poor tee shot set up a bogey on the 11th; at No. 12, Harringtons greenside chip stopped 12 feet short of the hole. He then missed the par putt. 

Harrington pressed on, with a smile on his face. His big break came when Furyk made bogeys at the 16th and 17th holes. At the 17th, Furyk missed a three-and-a-half-foot putt. 

I left the door open and I let him in and he closed it, Furyk said of Harrington. Ninety-nine out of 100 times I make that putt on 17. Finishing second stinks. I had this golf tournament won, I felt.

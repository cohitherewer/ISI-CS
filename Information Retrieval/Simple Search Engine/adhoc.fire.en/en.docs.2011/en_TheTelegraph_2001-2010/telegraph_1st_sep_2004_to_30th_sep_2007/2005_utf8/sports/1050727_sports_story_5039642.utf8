 Srinath stretches lead, Saheli loses 

Belfort: Putting up yet another sterling performance, N. Srinath defeated compatriot S. P. Sethuraman to stretch his lead to a full point over his nearest rivals in the under-12 boys section of World Youth Chess Championship here. 

With this win, Srinath took his tally to 7.5 points out of a possible eight, and is now followed by second seed Sujgirov Sanan, Hou Yifan, So Wesley and Vav Rajesh, all of whom have 6.5 points. Half-a-point adrift were top seed Parimarjan Negi, Sethuraman and six others in this section. 

It was a heroic effort from Srinath as he beat another higher rated opponent with his effective attack. Employing the Italian game with white pieces, Srinath squeezed out the defences of Sethuraman and romped home in 76 moves. 

In the under-10 boys, Sahaj Grovers dream run was halted by Daniel Naroditsky of United States. 

Y Sandeep came back strongly after losing the previous round game and accounted for Sebastien Feller. 

Among the girls, Woman Grandmaster D. Harika again suffered a setback, losing to Maria Ignacz in the eighth round of under-16 girls. In fact it was a double blow for the Indian team in this section as in-form Saheli Nath also went down against leader Anna Muzychuk of Slovenia. Both the girls would now have to do really well in the remaining rounds to remain in medal contention.

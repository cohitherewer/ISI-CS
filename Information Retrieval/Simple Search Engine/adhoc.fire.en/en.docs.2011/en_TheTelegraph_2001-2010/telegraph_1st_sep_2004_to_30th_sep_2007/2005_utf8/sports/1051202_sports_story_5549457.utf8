 India would count out Lanka at own peril

Straight Talk 

 Arjuna Ranatunga 

The Sri Lankans can regroup and Chennai can provide the proof even if the match itself is not slated to go the distance. We in Sri Lanka know the fury of weather enough to submit to its wishes. It can be a good pointer for the two Tests that remain. 

It still would be disappointing as India and Sri Lanka do not often play Tests. It is difficult to account for such bad vibes for there is enough talent and likeness to promise intriguing contests. How do you otherwise account for a split one-day and Tests itinerary? 

The Sri Lankans were deported for 10 days and South Africa were ushered in as Indian Board sought to maximise its commercial and election prospects. I have already voiced my dissent at the unfashionable one-day centres the Sri Lankans were saddled with. I now hear that Kanpur as a Test venue for the present series is in doubt. And to think of all this happening even as the Chennai Test is set to unfold within a few hours. 

No wonder there is little build-up for the series. 

However, both Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan will be handful in Tests and my reasons are simple: one-dayers usually provide flat pitches and defensive fields which would not be an issue in the Tests. 

Besides, Murali can bowl 30 and not only 10 overs in a day which, backed by aggressive fields, can be daunting for batsmen. As it is, but for Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, also Sourav Ganguly if he plays, not many have faced him in Tests. The Indians too would follow the return of Anil Kumble and Ajit Agarkar with interest. Kumble has always been a probing bowler and that he is now aiming 500 wickets in Tests is a tribute to his longevity and fitness, not the least to how he has reoriented himself in the past couple of years. 

A few youngsters too have a window of opportunity. We would watch the advent of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Tests with interest and along with Pathan he gives the Indian batting that extra depth. I wonder if the presence of the two can embolden the Indians to try out five bowlers for the Test. I dont know whether the Indians would review the situation following the inclusion of Ganguly but they have experimented enough in recent weeks to suggest they can do the unthinkable. 

The Indians would surely look to shape their Test squad for the battles ahead. Yuvraj Singh can no longer be held back and seems ready. The same is with Mohammed Kaif. It must put the likes of Gautam Gambhir and Laxman on alert. Ganguly too seems to be hanging only by the thread. 

However, I must stress that India would count out Sri Lanka at their own peril. It would be a mistake if they treat these Tests as warm-up for the battles against Pakistan and England. Atapattus men would be on a mission to salvage their battered honours. If the Indians can keep up the momentum, they would be the side to watch for the rest of the season. (PTI)

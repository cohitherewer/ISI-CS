 IOC, PSB in title round 

 Deepak Thakur netted a brace for IOC 

Hyderabad: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) grounded defending champions Indian Airlines 4-1 to set up a title-clash with Punjab and Sind Bank (PSB) in the 61st senior national hockey championship for the Major Rangaswamy Cup on Tuesday. 

PSB rallied from one goal down to beat Services 2-1 at the Gachhibowli Hockey Complex for a place in the final. Chandrasekahr Xalxo scored for Services in the second minute before Navpreet Singh netted in the 43rd and 55th minute to give PSB a hard-fought win. 

Deepak Thakur (2, 15), and Prabhjot Singh (5 and 55) struck for IOC while Dhanraj Pillay netted the lone goal for Indian Airlines in the 52nd minute. 

Airlines were off colour from the beginning as Thakur put IOC ahead in the third minute leaving the defending champions dumbfound. 

Prabhjot and Thakur struck in quick succession to put pressure on the Arjun Hallappa-led team which was trailing 0-3 at one stage of the match. 

Indian Airlines struggled for control and paid for missing out on scoring opportunities. They missed as many as 10 penalty corners. (PTI)

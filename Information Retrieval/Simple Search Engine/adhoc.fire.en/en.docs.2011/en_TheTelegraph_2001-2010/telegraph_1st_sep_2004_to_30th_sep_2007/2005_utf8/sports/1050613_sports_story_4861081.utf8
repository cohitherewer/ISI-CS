 Johnson betters Liu

New York: Four-time world champion Allen Johnson surprised Olympic gold medallist Liu Xiang of China in an early-season 110m hurdles showdown at the New York grand prix Saturday. 

The 1996 Olympic champion clocked 13.03 seconds for the fastest time in the world this year. And Sydney Olympics champion Maurice Greene showed he was in form for the US championships later this month by claiming the 100m in 10.08 seconds. He defeated Olympic 200 m gold medallist Shawn Crawford. 

In Monterrey, Marion Jones finished a disappointing fourth in a womens 100 m race Saturday. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Whatmore to remain with Bangladesh

Dhaka: Bangladesh cricket coach Dav Whatmore signed an agreement on Wednesday that would keep him with the Test newcomers through the World Cup 2007. 

[Whatmore?s comments have confirmed a report by The Telegraph on Wednesday that he had reached an agreement with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and only the formal signing remained.] 

The Australian?s current two-year contract with the BCB was to expire on April 30. 

Whatmore, speaking over the phone, said he preferred staying with Bangladesh though he has been linked with the Indian team following the departure of John Wright. 

Whatmore is now with the team in Chittagong, preparing for Bangladesh?s maiden visit to England in May. (AFP)

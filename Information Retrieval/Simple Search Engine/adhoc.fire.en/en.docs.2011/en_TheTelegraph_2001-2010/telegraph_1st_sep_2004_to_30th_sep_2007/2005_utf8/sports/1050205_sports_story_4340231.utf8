 Venus Arising may be one to beat: Shroff 

 PRAVESH GUPTA

 Mumbai: When it comes to Indian Derby, views of jockey-turned-trainer Pesi Shroff always matter. And why shouldn?t? The man has eight Indian Derbies in his kitty and is considered the first person on Indian turf. He strongly fancies the winning chances of Venus Arising in Sunday?s Derby but also thinks that the horses sporting Calcutta owner Deepak Khaitan?s colours ? Adreyan and Aperitivo ? are no pushovers. ?Venus Arising is a kind of horse I would have picked up for Derby. She is a very calm filly and has maintained her peak form. Her Oaks? victory indicated so when she covered good ground in the final stretch to return triumphant;? said Pesi.

 A hoard of other professionals, too, agree with Pesi?s observations, though Cooji Katrak was firm in his opinion that his other filly Farida Kahlo is also capable of surprising the stable favourite Venus Arising and other runners. Pesi had watched Venus Arising from the sidelines, but for that matter he had virtually done so when he agreed to ride Psychic Flame. 

 It?s years of association and experience with the quality horseflesh that helps one narrow down the choice. ?Yes, I had cantered the Psychic Flame and had only watched her previous wins on video. It satisfied me immensely before I gave the nod to ride. Venus Arising gives me the feeling that she is a fighter;? he added.

 Trainer Altaf Hussain, however, opined that it is going to be an open race. ?There are at least four horses who may matter in the Derby. Venus Arising apart, Aperitivo and Adreyan are very much in the reckoning. And Imtiaz Sait?s filly Warsaw Pact, MAM?s Southern Regent cannot be overlooked. And finally, how can one write off Berlioz (trained by S. Padmanabhan) the winner of the 2,000 Guineas;? questioned Altaf.

 Padmanabhan said, ?Berlioz has been very consistent performer over the month. Southern Regent and Venus Arising are my danger.?

 But, trainer Vijay Singh, who has been camping here since Tuesday evening appeared very hopeful about his charge, Aperitivo. ?My horse produced a blinder in the Calcutta Derby because the pace was hot. The Indian Derby pace is going to be still faster. Now you can draw your own conclusion;? said Vijay.

 Trainer Imtiaz Sait?s observations also made sense. ?Warsaw Pact?s two runs have been judiciously spaced while Venus Arising will be running two long distance races within a fortnight;? Sait felt. But Warsaw pact being a temperamental filly does not worry most, including Pesi.

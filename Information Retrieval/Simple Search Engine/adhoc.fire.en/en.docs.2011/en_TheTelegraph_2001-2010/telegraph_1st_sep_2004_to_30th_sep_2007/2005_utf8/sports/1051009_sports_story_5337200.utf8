 I can rely on my past experience in Suzuka

Its the penultimate race of my maiden Formula 1 season and I cant believe how fast its gone by. I think this season has given me a lot of experience and made me a more complete Formula 1 driver. It will be very useful using this experience in my future-racing career. 

We had a very good first session in the Friday practice, but we had a problem with the shock absorbers in the second session, which saw me complete only six laps. I had a wrong car set-up. I would have liked to put more laps under my belt, but this is one place I can rely on my past experience. 

I have raced in Suzuka before and I am very familiar with this track. I really like this track. Suzuka includes some of the Grand Prix calendars most challenging corners. 

The high-speed 130R and the famous Spoon Curve are quite demanding. I hope it rains this weekend because it tends to give our cars an advantage. Our Bridgestone tyres perform well in the wets. There is a very high chance of rain this weekend and we are hoping to capitalise on that factor. If we start the race under wet conditions you can expect us to finish in a fairly respectable position. 

My last race at Interlagos in Brazil was a decent race. We had started the race ahead of Sato and Trulli and I think we did a good job in keeping them behind us for a good number of laps. We were not fazed by their presence behind us and we kept on going on about our race. 

Brazil also saw Alonso becoming the world champion. He has raced consistently and fast throughout the year and he richly deserves the championship. Its good to see a new world champion. 

However the constructors championship is still wide open and this weekends race and the rain will play a vital role in swinging the favour to one team. It will be tricky but we can surely expect some excitement this weekend. 

We will be going into this race with the same package we had in Brazil. The new car is a lot better and we are happy with its progress. I hope to finish the season on the same high note that I had started it. TCM

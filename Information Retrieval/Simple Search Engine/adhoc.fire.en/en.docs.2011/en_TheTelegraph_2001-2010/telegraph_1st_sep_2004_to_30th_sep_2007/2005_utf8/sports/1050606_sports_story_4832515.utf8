Second-half goals from Cristan Lara and Agustin Delgado in Quito mean that Argentina, who would have made sure of their place in Germany if they had won, will now have to try again in Wednesdays meeting with Brazil. 

Colombia trounced Peru 5-0 in Barranquilla and Marcelo Salas became Chiles all-time leading scorer after hitting the target in the 3-1 win over Bolivia, ending a four-year wait for his 35th international goal. 

Venezuela were held 1-1 at home by Uruguay in the nights other tie, which ended with scuffles between the players. 

Argentina still lead the 10-nation South American group with 28 points from 14 games. Ecuador have 23 points. 

Argentina coach Jose Pekerman rested several top players and refused to blame Quitos high altitude after the first defeat in eight games since he took over. 

Full-back Neicer Reasco weaved his way through the Argentine midfield and laid the ball off for Lara to score from the edge of the area in the 54th minute. 

Then Lara tricked his way past his marker and crossed for Agustin Delgado to head the second in the 90th. 

Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso was sent off for elbowing an opponent in the scuffle which followed. 

 Mexico, US well-placed 

The final stage of the Concacaf zone maintained a predictable course with Mexico and the United States winning again on Saturday. Mexico pounced on some dreadful defending to win 2-0 in Guatemala while the United States gave Alexandre Guimaraes an unhappy return to the Costa Rican bench as they trounced the Central Americans 3-0 in Salt Lake City.

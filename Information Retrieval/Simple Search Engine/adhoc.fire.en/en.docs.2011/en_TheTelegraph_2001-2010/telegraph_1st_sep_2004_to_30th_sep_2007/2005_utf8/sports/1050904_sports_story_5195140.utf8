 Streak pulls out 

 Heath Streak 

Harare: Heath Streak has pulled out of the last round-robin match against India in the Videocon Cup tri-series on Sunday. 

Streak, who was hit on his left knee in the second Test against New Zealand in Bulawayo, apparently cannot carry on any longer and has withdrawn from the game. 

The tie is inconsequential since India and New Zealand have already made it to Tuesdays final. Streak was confident that given proper rest, he would be fit for the Test series. 

India, on the other hand, having already assured a place in the final, would be looking to use their bench strength in the inconsequential match. Bowlers Rudra Pratap Singh and Murali Kartik and batsmen Suresh Raina and Yalaka Venugopal Rao can all expect a game as coach Greg Chappell is a great believer in giving everyone a feel in the sun on a tour. 

It would only be fitting that these youngsters are given a game before they head back home since the reinforcements for the Test series would be arriving early next week. The four have done very little since arriving in Zimbabwe last month even though Rao had played one and been a super sub in another game. 

It would mean a few regulars could sit out, including the hero of the last match against New Zealand on Friday, Mohammed Kaif. 

Obviously thats an option for us to consider. Though Kaif having got a hundred would like to carry on, Chappell said. 

If the new players have to be accommodated and a few regulars given a break, then high on the list could be Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif among batsmen and Irfan Pathan and Ashish Nehra among bowlers. Harbhajan Singh too could be asked to make way for Kartik.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Only families to watch

Karachi: The first womens cricket series between Pakistan and India will begin in Lahore on Wednesday with only families allowed to watch because of cultural restrictions in the country. 

Unaccompanied male spectators will be barred from entering the venues for the four one-day matches, said Shamsha Hashmi, the secretary of the Pakistan Womens Cricket Association (PWCA) on Monday. 

We have to keep in mind our cultural values and give no reason for anyone to discourage womens cricket, said Hashmi. 

While tussles between Pakistan and India in mens cricket enjoy a huge following in the sub-continent, Hashmi hopes the women will also capture the publics imagination. 

We see cricket as a channel for womens empowerment and development in Pakistan. Those playing the game now are becoming aware of their basic rights, she said. 

The PWCA is also planning to host the Asia Cup tournament in December. India and Sri Lanka have confirmed their participation. (REUTERS)

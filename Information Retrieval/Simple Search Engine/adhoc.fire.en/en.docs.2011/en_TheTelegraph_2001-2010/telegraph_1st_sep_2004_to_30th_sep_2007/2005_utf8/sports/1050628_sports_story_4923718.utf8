 Bermuda, Canada lead challenge

London: Bermuda and Canada will lead the challenge in their respective groups in the ICC Trophy beginning in Ireland from Friday. 

The top two teams in groups A and B will proceed to the semi-finals and will also qualify for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. The teams that finish third and fourth in the group will play-off against the third and fourth place finishers in group B for the final qualifying spot. 

All group stage matches will be played in the north of Ireland, while the knock-out stages will be played in the south with the final at Clontarf near Dublin on July 13, an ICC release said Monday. 

Bermuda skipper Clay Smith could be the man to look out for with a record three centuries under his belt in the Cup Classic, countrys biggest cricket event. 

Canada will be led by captain John Davison, who holds the World Cup record for the fastest century off 67 balls in the tournaments history. He reached his landmark hundred against the West Indies in South Africa two years ago. 

Davison is also quite handy with the ball ? in last years ICC Intercontinental Cup match vs the US, his wily off-spin fetched him 17 wickets. Canada is the only side participating in this years ICC Trophy to have won a World Cup match, when they defeated Bangladesh in the 2003 edition. 

GROUP A: Bermuda, Denmark, Ireland, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, US. GROUP B: Canada, Holland, Namibia, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Scotland. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ...But the show must go on

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: In faraway Pune, Sourav Ganguly was proving his form when Team India was getting their first feel of the Eden turf. Yet, Souravs shadow loomed large over Eden Gardens on Thursday. 

There were no slogans raised in support of the former captain, but the turnout that managed to sneak in to have a glansce of the teams practice were vociferous in applauding the Indians. Still, the common refrain remained, if Sourav was around and this team still needs him. 

This will only be the second time since 1996 that India will be without Sourav at the Eden. The only other instance was against Australia in November 2003, when a groin injury forced him to stay out. 

The situation resembles a boatman who has been separated from his oar or a batsman without a bat, says former national selector Sambaran Banerjee. But Calcuttans have to accept the facts and prepare for a match without their favourite son of the soil. 

The Ganguly familys attendance at the Eden on Friday will also be thin. Father Chandi, also the chairman of the CAB Board of Trustees, is likely to be present. Brother Snehasish, though, will not be Eden-bound. Wife Dona is also likely to give it a miss. 

My absence will have nothing to do with Sourav not being part of the side. Its just that I dont feel like going, Snehasish told The Telegraph. 

Former India wicketkeeper Syed Saba Karim felt it was time for the Calcuttans to accept it as part of life. Weve to accept it. Its time for all of us to get behind the side. I believe Sourav will also appreciate that. Ironically, a lot of hullabaloo have been made about Sourav, who himself led India out of a parochial attitude. 

Another Calcuttan Arun Lal, too, feels that the time has come to accept and carry on. 

Its, no doubt, sad that Calcutta will host a International without Sourav, but? 

That Sourav is now a part of the Test squad is good, says Ashok Malhotra. The way the one-day side is playing it would have been tough to find a berth. In Tests, he will be better placed.

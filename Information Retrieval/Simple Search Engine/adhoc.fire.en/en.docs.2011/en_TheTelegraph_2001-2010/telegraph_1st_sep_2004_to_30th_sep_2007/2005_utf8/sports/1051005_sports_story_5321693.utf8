The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nayeem intends inviting Sourav to chat with national team

 - The notion that foreigners know best is terribly misplaced 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Nayeem

Calcutta: The Boards review panel exonerated Sourav Ganguly, but the damage caused by Greg Chappells leaked e-mail is unlikely to ever be repaired. The Team India captain, though, can draw comfort from what the Nasser Hussains have been saying. 

Thus far, of course, the pro and anti-Sourav debate has almoost exclusively been confined to the cricket fraternity. On Tuesday, the much-decorated Syed Nayeemuddin entered the ring and landed a flurry of punches for Sourav. 

Im amazed at the lack of respect for Souravs achievements... To me, records matter and it hurts that his achievements have been forgotten so quickly... Surely, winning nearly a hundred (97, in fact) matches is not a small matter, Nayeem, back as Indias soccer coach after seven years, told The Telegraph. 

An Asian Games bronze medal-winning captain himself, he added: I have nothing against Chappell, but the coach has to be sensitive in his dealings, particularly when somebody with over 15,000 Test and ODI runs is his captain. Sourav wouldnt have come so far if he was petty and indisciplined. 

Nayeem, who worshipped Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi for over a decade, also said that cricket lends itself to the captain being the boss and no coach should begin believing his powers are on a par with those who manage soccer teams. 

 Sourav

Soccer is played at such a furious pace that a captain doesnt have the time to pause and re-draw strategy. Thats done by the coach, who is on the sidelines. Cricket is different, which is why many are applauded as thinking and innovative captains. 

Asked whether the Sourav-Chappell truce would hold, Nayeem replied: I hope so... Both have to respect each other and respect each others roles... However, as Ive pointed out, Chappell must be sensitive... The notion that foreigners know best is terribly misplaced. Moreover, they cant be as passionate as somebody from the country itself. 

Nayeem, by the way, intends inviting Sourav to have a chat with the national players. 

Obviously, a suitable date has to be worked out, but it will be nice if Sourav gets to interact with them... A session with him is going to be a privilege... Ive already announced Ill be asking my gurus (P.K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami, for example) to have a chat with the boys. 

The SAFF Cup, in December, is going to be Nayeems first assignment. Characteristically, hes looking for passion bordering on madness from those he will be working with. 

Like Sourav, Nayeem ? whose mantra is if you dont prepare, youre preparing for failure ? doesnt fit a stereotype. 

Footnote: Board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra has indicated Sourav is on notice, but that applies to Chappell as well. Both have been told theyre going to be judged by results. Both accepted that, informed a member of the review panel.

 ICC clears Harbhajan

 Harbhajan Singh 

London: India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has 

been cleared of a suspect bowling action, the International Cricket Council (ICC) 

said on Wednesday. 

Harbhajan was reported for a suspect action when bowling 

his doosra delivery by match officials during the second Test against Bangladesh 

in Chittagong in December. 

The doosra is a delivery that spins away from a right-handed batsman, the opposite direction to an off-spinner?s stock ball. 

The ICC said they had received a report from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that confirmed the ?bowling action for both his off-spinner and doosra falls within the tolerance threshold prescribed in its new regulations?. 

The ICC introduced a new threshold on March 1 allowing all bowlers to straighten their arms by up to 15 degrees. 

Previously, spinners were only permitted to straighten their arms by five degrees, medium pacers 7.5 and fast bowlers by 10. 

Harbhajan, who has been named in India?s squad for their Test series against Pakistan starting next Tuesday, worked with a biomechanics expert from the University of Western Australia to correct his action. 

He had been reported once before, in 1998, for a suspect 

action.

Nagpur: East Zone medium pacer Shib Shankar Paul?s six for 45 wreaked the Bangladesh batting as the visitors were all out for 142 in their first innings on the second day of the Duleep Trophy league match at the VCA ground here on Wednesday. 

East Zone, riding a fine 170 from Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly, declared their first innings at 454 for six. Sourav, who was unbeaten on 110 at stumps Tuesday with Sanjib Sanyal (2), started the second morning with the scorecard reading 356 for five. East Zone added 98 more runs to the overnight score before finally declaring the innings an hour before lunch. 

The visitors, following on with a 312-run deficit, are in for an innings defeat as they lost eight wickets for 123 runs at stumps. The visitors still require another 189 runs to avoid that with just two wickets in hand. 

Opener Al Shahariar (33) and skipper Mohammed Ashraful (40) were the only batsmen to offer some resistance in an otherwise pathetic batting display. Paul picked up two more in the second innings, taking his day?s haul to eight wickets. 

Ashraful played some crisp shots but failed to convert a good start. Earlier, Sourav continued from where he left off Tuesday, playing shots all around the field. His 170 included 21 boundaries and four sixes. (PTI)

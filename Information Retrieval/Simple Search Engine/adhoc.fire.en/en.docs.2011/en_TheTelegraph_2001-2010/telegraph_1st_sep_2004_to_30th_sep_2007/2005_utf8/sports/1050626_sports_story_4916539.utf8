 Warnes to separate

London: Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne and his wife Simone are to separate, the couple said on Saturday. 

It is with regret that we inform you that we have decided to separate, they said in a joint statement issued through Warnes brother and manager Jason. 

We remain best of friends and we will both continue to be there for our three beautiful children. Please respect our privacy at this difficult and tough time. 

The 35-year-old Warne, one of five players named as Wisdens cricketers of the 20th century, has settled in England where he is captain of county side Hampshire. 

Meanwhile, Australia captain Ricky Ponting on Saturday said he hoped Warne would be able to concentrate on his cricket during the forthcoming Ashes series. 

Ponting said: Thats awful news for anybody, to be separated from your wife. Theres no doubt that everyone in our squad will be in touch with Shane at some stage. 

As far as it being a distraction when the Tests come around, hopefully its not. Its obviously going to be a tough thing for Shane to deal with and cope with but hopefully he can do that as well as he can.

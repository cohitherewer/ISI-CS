 Singapore: Bulgarian International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Ivan Slavkov was expelled on Thursday following allegations of corruption in a television documentary. Slavkov and Serbian sports agent Goran Takach were shown discussing ways to secure votes for choosing the site of the 2012 Games with undercover journalists posing as business agents in a one-hour programme broadcast in Britain by the BBC just before the Athens Olympics last August. Slavkov has said he and Takach had tried to pull a reverse-sting operation to catch what they thought were ?corrupters? of the Games bidding process.

 The IOC suspended Slavkov last August and he was not allowed his accreditation for the 2004 Olympic Games. Their ethics commission launched an investigation into Slavkov and in November the IOC Executive Board recommended he be expelled from the organisation at this week?s session in Singapore for tarnishing its reputation. A two-thirds majority of the 114 members at the session was required for Slavkov?s expulsion. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid?s Portugal forward Luis Figo is poised to join European champions Liverpool, according to a Spanish sports daily. Real were reported to have accepted a ?2 million bid from the English Premiership side. Figo, 32, was on the bench for Real?s last eight league matches.

 He cost Real a then-world record ?37 million when he moved from Barcelona five years ago. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Disgruntled Brazil striker Robinho made a brief appearance at Santos? headquarters on Wednesday, but once again defied club directors by not training with the team. Angry with the Brazilian champions because they turned down a $25 million bid for him from Real Madrid, Robinho joked with his teammates before having a conversation with coach Gallo. Neither Gallo nor Robinho commented and the 21-year-old, regarded as one of Brazil?s most exciting player, left without training. On Monday, Robinho had been ordered to resume training as Santos said that any team wanting to buy him before the end of his contract in 2008 must pay a $50 million penalty.

 Beijing: China?s Olympic and world table tennis champion Zhang Yining has resumed training after a two-month lay-off due to a wrist injury. She had fractured her right wrist badly during a training session on May 12, less than a week after she captured the women?s singles title at the world championships in Shanghai. ?My life turned so boring after I injured my wrist,? said Zhang. ?I feel so excited about holding the paddle again.?

 But the head coach of the Chinese women?s national team, Lu Yuansheng said Zhang could do only ?basic? practice at present. ?She cannot play competitive games until at least August,? Lu said, adding that Zhang will continue to receive ?herbal? treatment.

 Tel Aviv: Top class professional tennis will return to Israel next year for the first time since 1994 following the announcement of a new WTA Tour event. ?We will do all we can to attract the world?s best players. My intention is to raise the standard of women?s tennis in Israel,? tournament sponsor Henri Zimand said on Wednesday.

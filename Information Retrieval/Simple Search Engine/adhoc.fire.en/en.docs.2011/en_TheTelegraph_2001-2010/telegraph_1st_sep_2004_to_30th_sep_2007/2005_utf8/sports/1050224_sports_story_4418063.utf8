The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Shoaib?s troubles may not be over

 - Paying up $500 is a joke... That amount is peanuts for today?s professionals, feels an ex-Pakistan captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Lahore: Shoaib Akhtar?s 

 troubles, apparently, haven?t ended with his being fined 

 $500 and reprimanded by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) 

 disciplinary committee.

 According to The Telegraph?s sources, 

 the Justice Ameer Alam-headed committee has ?only submitted 

 a preliminary report? and PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan is 

 ?within his rights? to impose a penalty over and above what 

 has been announced. 

In any case, just about everybody in the fraternity here is peeved that the committee took the ?easy way out? by slapping a token fine. 

?This was an excellent opportunity to nail our enfant terrible.... Paying up $500 is a joke... That amount is peanuts for today?s professionals,? a former Pakistan captain observed on Wednesday. 

Intriguingly, the committee acknowledged Shoaib was ?indisciplined? on the tour of Australia, yet didn?t come down on him like a tonne of bricks. 

While teammates didn?t exactly threaten to ?revolt? if Shoaib was picked for India ? the tearaway himself opted out, insisting he wasn?t fit ? they have had enough of his ?I?m the biggest around? attitude. 

?Shoaib believes he?s indispensable, but Pakistan have won more matches with him not in the XI than when he has played... It isn?t a coincidence the team spirit picked up once Shoaib left Australia (early in the tri-series),? remarked somebody who was on tour. 

That Shoaib insists he is unfit even when an injury can?t be detected is something that?s already being ?discussed? by the powers-that-be. 

Also, Shoaib?s reluctance to work with and follow the fitness programme suggested by the support staff has been ?reported.? Unusually, he gets treated by his personal doctor, something okayed by the previous dispensation. 

Indications, therefore, are that Shaharyar could have to take an ?unpleasant? decision. 

Significantly, coach Bob Woolmer (targeted by a section of the Media) had this to say: ?I want everybody to appreciate that I want the best and fittest XI on the park... I want the most committed XI.... Unfortunately, Shoaib has had injuries and that has been unsettling for him and the team... 

?If he is to be a force in Pakistan cricket, he should make a genuine effort to get one hundred per cent fit ? physically and mentally... Frankly, it?s his choice... We?re there to support him, but Shoaib alone has to decide how he wishes to make a return...? 

Woolmer feels let down. And, why not? After all, within days of replacing Javed Miandad last summer, he took the initiative for a ?heart-to-heart? chat with Shoaib during one of his County matches, in Taunton. 

Actually, it was at Woolmer?s behest that the selectors picked Shoaib for the Asia Cup, even though many wanted him out after his ?antics? in the series-deciding Rawalpindi Test against India. 

 Shoaib, it seems, doesn?t learn from the past.

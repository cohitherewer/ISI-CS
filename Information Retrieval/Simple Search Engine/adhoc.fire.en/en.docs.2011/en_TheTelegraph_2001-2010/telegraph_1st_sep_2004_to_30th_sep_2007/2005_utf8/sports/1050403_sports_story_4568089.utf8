 Railways get closer to title

 J.P. Yadav hit a fine 97 

Mohali: Railways virtually assured themselves their second Ranji Trophy title after extending their lead to 408 runs against Punjab on the fourth day of the Elite Division final here on Saturday. 

Railways, resuming at 123 for two, ended the penultimate day at 362 for eight at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium with overnight not out batsmen JP Yadav (97) and Sanjay Bangar (77) and Yere Goud (96 batting) frustrating the home side. 

With just a day left and with two second innings wickets of Railways standing, Punjab now face an almost impossible task of winning the match. 

Even if the match ends in a draw, Railways will clinch the title on the basis of first innings lead. 

 Punjab had conceded a first innings lead of 46 runs after being bowled out for 309 in reply to Railways 355 all out. 

Yadav and Bangar were involved in a 148-run partnership for the third wicket, which came to an end when the former was caught behind by Pankaj Dharmani off VRV Singh. 

Bangar did not last long and was bowled out by Rajesh Sharma with the total reading 205. The fifth wicket in the form of Raja Ali (14) also fell at the same score. Goud held his wicket as the visitors lost three more wickets ? Tejinder Pal Singh (12), Sushir Wankhede (24) and Kulamani Parida (6).

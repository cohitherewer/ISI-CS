 Lawson reported 

London: The West Indies seamer Jermaine Lawson has been reported for a suspect bowling action by match officials, the ICC announced on Sunday. 

The report was made by on-field umpires ? Simon Taufel and Nadeem Ghauri ? and TV umpire Peter Manuel, after the first Test in Colombo which saw Sri Lanka beat the West Indies by six wickets on Saturday. Lawson took eight wickets in the match. 

Match Referee Mike Procter has informed both the ICC and the West Indies team management of the report, as per the ICC regulations governing the reporting process. 

The match officials had concerns with potential elbow flexion when viewing the bowlers action with the naked eye, Procter said. This assessment has led the team of officials to request the ICC to commission a biomechanical report into the bowlers action in accordance with the new process introduced earlier this year. 

The report will be handled under the ICCs recently-revised bowling review process. Lawson will now undergo independent analysis of his action by a member of the ICCs panel of human movement specialists. 

This will take place as soon as practically possible, and within a maximum period of 21 days from receipt by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) of formal notice of the report by the ICC. (PTI)

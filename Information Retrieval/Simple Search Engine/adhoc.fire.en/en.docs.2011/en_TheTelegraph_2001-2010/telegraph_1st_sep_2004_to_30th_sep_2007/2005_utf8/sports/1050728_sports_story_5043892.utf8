London: European champions Liverpool stepped up a gear to snuff out Lithuanias FBK Kaunas on Tuesday, recovering from a goal down to take a 3-1 lead into the return leg of their Champions League second round qualifier. After being down by a Giedrius Barevicius goal, Liverpool pumped in three via Djibril Cisse, Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard.

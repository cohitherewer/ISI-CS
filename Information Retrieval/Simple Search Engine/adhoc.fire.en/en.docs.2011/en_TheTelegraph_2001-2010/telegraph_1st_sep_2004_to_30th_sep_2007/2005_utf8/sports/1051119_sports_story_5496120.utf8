Calcutta: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly didnt attach too much importance to Indias five-wicket loss to South Africa in Hyderabad. Only one game has got over, there are four more still to go. There is nothing to panic about, Sourav said at the Videocon School of Cricket in Salt Lake on Friday. 

On his equation with Greg Chappell, if he is recalled to the Team India squad, Sourav reiterated that it would be like a normal coach-player relationship (as was reported by The Telegraph on Friday). 

The left-hander said he would not be short on motivation while leading Bengal in the Ranji match against Maharashtra. I have no problem motivating myself. The biggest motivation is that if I play well, I will play for India again, he said. 

Sourav appealed to the fans to come to the Eden ODI even if he is not drafted into the squad for next Fridays fourth match versus South Africa. 

As far as I am concerned, the game is at Eden Gardens and India are playing. Thats the most important thing. I am sure when India play South Africa, there will be a hundred thousand people at the Eden, he said.

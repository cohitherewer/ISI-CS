Calcutta: Inclement weather didn?t allow India to hold the grip further over the second under-19 ?Test? against England at the Eden on Friday. 

An overcast sky halted the second day?s proceedings thrice before the umpires finally brought the action to an premature end, nearly one hour before the scheduled close at 4.30 pm. India were 337 for five at that time, with Aditya Jain and Gaurav Dhiman batting on 16 and 34, respectively. 

A 190-run first-innings lead is already on the board. India captain Ambati Rayudu will want to accelerate the pace of scoring on Saturday morning and go for the jugular from the second session onwards. 

However, a great deal of his plans will depend on how the weather improves in the morning because the call-off of the match on Friday followed steady showers in the evening. 

The overnight unbeaten batsmen ? Rayudu and Faiz Fazal ? were in scintillating form and toyed with the English attack in the morning session. 

The duo added 151 in the third wicket. Fazal was better to watch as he didn?t pay respect to any of the bowlers on way to his 94, which included 15 hits to the fence. 

Fazal was unlucky to miss out on a century. He inside-edged a sharp in-cutter from Andrew Miller that nipped back from outside the off-stump. 

Both the batsmen, who were there in the middle for quite sometime, showed perfect use of feet against spinners. Especially, Fazal didn?t look in any trouble in front of any spinner. But he was unlucky and fell six runs short of the three-figure mark. 

Before perishing, both batsmen showed perfect use of feet against the spinners. 

Manoj Tewari, named Man of the Match in the last ?Test?, was also set for a big score. But he was shown the door by Ben Harmison (brother of English fast bowler Steve) on 25.

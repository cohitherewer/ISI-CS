 Anju carrying Indian hopes

New Delhi: Anju Bobby George will lead the Indian challenge at the World Athletic Championships beginning in Helsinki on Saturday, well aware that she is the sole medal hope for the country. 

Discus throwers Neelam Jaswant Singh and Vikas Gowda, who make up the Indian trio, are not expected to pose much of a challenge. 

The Amateur Athletic Federation of India (AAFI) resisted the temptation to name a bigger squad for the 10th edition of the championships, saying selection was based on the current performances of the athletes concerned. 

Anju, the first Indian with a medal at the World Championships which she won in Paris two years ago, will once again lead Indian hopes in the long jump when her event gets underway on Tuesday. 

But the 28-year-old, currently ranked fifth in the world, has had an average season by her standards with her best being only 6.42m achieved in Doha in May. The mark is way below her personal best of 6.83m she jumped at the Athens Olympics last year, a national record. 

The Busan Asian Games gold medallist will look to find some of her old form in the face of stiff Russian challenge led by Tatyana Kotova and Irina Simagina. 

In the lead-up to Helsinki, she has managed a fourth-place finish at the British Grand Prix in London with a jump of 6.41m. She could not attain a podium finish at the next event in Stockholm, too, with a distance of 6.49m. 

But Anju maintains that her preparation for the World Championships was on track and she was ready for a good performance at Helsinki. 

I am almost close to my Olympics form, she said. 

Her coach and husband Bobby George was also hopeful of leaving behind an average season and peaking in the elite competition. 

We know how to peak in time. We will do our seasons best at the World Championships, Bobby George said. 

With Olympic champion Tatyana Lebedeva and Swedens Carolina Kluft not figuring in the long jump entry list, the prospects of Anju defending her bronze medal seem brighter. 

The Indian would, however, hope that it is bright and sunny during the competition as she never performs her best in cold and damp conditions. 

Gowda had represented India at the Athens Olympics. He finished eighth in the discus qualifiers with an attempt of 61.39m, thus narrowly missing the finals. 

The 22-year-old from Mysore has set national records with 64.35m (Salinas, May 2004) and 64.69m (Charlotte, April 2005). He was the NCAA silver medallist at Sacramento this year with a distance of 60.08m. Gowda is currently ranked 29th in his event. 

The 34-year-old Neelam has had an impressive career with discus gold medals at the Busan Asian Games and the 2000 Asian Championships. 

Coached by husband Jaswant Singh, Neelam, ranked 26th in the world, reached the finals at Paris Saint-denis two years ago where she finished 12th. Her best performance this season was a distance of 60.65m in Patiala in May.

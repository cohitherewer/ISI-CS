 Lancaster may strike 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: The 1,400m Kelachandra New Millennium Cup, a terms race for four-year-olds and over here on Frdiay, looks to be a very open affair with four runners Attorney, Lancaster, Polar Force and Havana Goodtime having an equal chance to take the spoils. However, the one who looks to hold the edge over the rest is the Michael Eshwer-trained Lancaster who will be ridden by Y. Srinath.

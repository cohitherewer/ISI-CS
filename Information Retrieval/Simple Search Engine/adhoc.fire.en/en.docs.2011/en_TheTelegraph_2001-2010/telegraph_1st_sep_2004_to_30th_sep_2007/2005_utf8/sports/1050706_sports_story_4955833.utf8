 Hidayat expected to carry his form

Kuala Lumpur: An intriguing first-round clash between two old foes in the mens singles will get the $ 120,000 Malaysian Open off to a cracking start when it opens Wednesday. 

Malaysias Hafiz Hashim, currently ranked No. 6 in the world, faces world champion Xia Xuanze of China, now a lowly 18th after poor form and injuries robbed him of a chance to defend his world title in California next month. 

Xia Xuanze, 27, the older of the two by five years, may have lost some of his edge but has fire in his belly following the International Badminton Federations decision not to award him a wildcard to defend his world crown, after failing to meet the qualifying mark. 

Chinas quota of three players will be taken up by world No. 1 Lin Dan, Bao Chunlai and Chen Hong. 

So Xia Xuanze has something to prove and has been given the perfect platform to do so at the KLBA Stadium. 

Hashim, the 2003 All-England Open champion, and Xia Xuanze have crossed swords on numerous occasions and while records favour the Chinese, the Malaysian is the form player. 

All world championship-bound players are competing in Kuala Lumpur, as the four-star Malaysian Open is the final event prior to the World Championships in Anaheim, California, which will be held from August 15 to 21. 

Valuable ranking points are up for grabs as the tournament offers the players a chance to upgrade their seedings and secure a better draw for the World Championships. 

Lin Dan, who has won five of his last eight tournaments, will start as the favourite to finally land the Malaysian Open title. The 20-year-old was a quarter finalist last year. (AFP)

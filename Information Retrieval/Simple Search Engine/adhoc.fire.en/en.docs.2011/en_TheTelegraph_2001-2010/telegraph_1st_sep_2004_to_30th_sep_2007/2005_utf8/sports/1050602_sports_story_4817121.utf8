 Jobless Jhanu mulls quitting

 Jhanu Hansda says she?s the sole earning member of her family 

Jamshedpur: Frustrated over not getting a permanent job despite her good show in several archery meets, world record holder Jhanu Hansda is considering quitting after this November?s Asian archery championship if job uncertainty persists. 

?What is the use of striving hard if I am unable to get a job despite earning laurels for the country at the international level,? said Jhanu, who is training in the national camp at the J.R.D. Tata Sports Complex for the world championship in Spain this month. 

However, she affirmed that right now her focus is on the world championship and she would try hard to better her performance in the Asian archery meet later this year. 

?I am 29 years old right now, and after a couple of years, I won?t be able to get a job,? said Jhanu, who eclipsed the world record of Valerie Fabre of France by scoring 352 out of 360 at the first national ranking prize money meet at Hyderabad last month. 

?The Asian meet will be my last major tournament if I fail to get a job before it,? she said. 

Jhanu had secured a job at Tata Steel, but the six year contract expired last year. 

Jhanu came to limelight in 1994 when she finished third at the national archery championship in Punjab. 

She said her father had retired two years ago and she would have to look after her family now, being the sole earning member. 

On the Jharkhand government?s job assurance after her world record, Jhanu said nothing has materialised. ?I do not even know whom should I approach?. 

The Jamshedpur girl, who switched over from the usual ?re-curve? to ?compound? division last year, said the world championship will be her major international tournament.

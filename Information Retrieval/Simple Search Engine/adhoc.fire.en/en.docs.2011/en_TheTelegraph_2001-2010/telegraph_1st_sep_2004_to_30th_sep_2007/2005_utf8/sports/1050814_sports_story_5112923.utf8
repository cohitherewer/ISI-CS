Manchester: Shane Warne took full advantage of English blunders to score an unbeaten 78 and help save the follow-on as Australia reached 264 for seven on a rain-hit third day of the third Test on Saturday. 

Only 14 overs were possible in two separate passages of play during which England were unable to remove either Warne or Jason Gillespie (seven batting). The pair took their partnership to 63 runs at Old Trafford. 

England made 444 in their first innings. The five-match series stands at 1-1. 

While Warne enjoyed himself, having hit a six and 10 fours, England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones made two shocking errors to give him two extra lives. 

Most of the first two sessions were washed out by rain before Australia resumed on 214 for seven, needing 31 more to avoid being asked to bat again. England opened with Ashley Giles and Warne opted for attack, hitting a rash of boundaries off the left-arm spinner before the rain returned after just eight overs. 

Warne reached his 70-ball 50 with a lofted single off Giles, then smashed a straight four just past Giles fingertips.

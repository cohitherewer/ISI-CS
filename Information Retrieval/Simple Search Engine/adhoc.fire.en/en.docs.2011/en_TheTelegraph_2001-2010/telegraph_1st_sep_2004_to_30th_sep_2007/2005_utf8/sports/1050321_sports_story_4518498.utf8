The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hard to come back: Sohail

 - FORMER INTERNATIONALS ON INDIA?S TRIUMPH 

NILESH BHATTACHARYA AND SANJIB GUHA

 Calcutta: If it were perceived as Rahul Dravid?s match, Anil Kumble would have something to say as India thrashed Pakistan by 195 runs at the Eden on Sunday. It was a ?complete? performance from Team India for Rameez Raja, while Aamer Sohail felt Kumble was too hot to handle on a fifth-day Indian pitch. 

Erapalli Prasanna: This win once again confirms Anil Kumbles essentiality in the team. He may not be a conventional leg-spinner, but he is supreme in terms of effectiveness. The win was much-needed after failing to close it out in Mohali. 

India again were the better-placed side here and the win will put them in good stead for the rest of the series. 

Harbhajan?s performance also showed improvement in the second innings and that will add to Pakistans woes. 

Syed Kirmani: The Indians completely outplayed Pakistan. What?s important is that everybody chipped in with crucial performances in crunch situations, be it Dravid, Karthik and Kumble. 

I would rather like to say that nothing went wrong for Pakistan, it was the Indians who did everything right and stole the limelight. 

Rameez Raja: India put up a complete performance, whereas Pakistan lacked vision in surviving the challenge on the fifth day. Pakistan?s inexperience also got exposed against Kumble and Harbhajan. 

The batsmen needed to show more patience while dealing with the Indian bowlers on a wearing and turning pitch. But in the end, full credit to Sourav?s boys to go 1-0 up in the series. 

Aamer Sohail: Anil Kumble at it again. People were talking about Danish Kaneria, particularly after his Mohali performance, but he still has a long way to go. 

He will have to take lessons from this great Indian spinner about how to win a match for his team. 

Pakistan lacked temperament and they didn?t look adept at playing quality spinners on a five-day-old track. In comparison to the Mohali track, the Eden pitch suited the Indian spinners more. I feel it will be hard for Pakistan to make a comeback. 

For this, they need to re-assess their strategy and raise the level of the game in Bangalore.

 India in easier Fed Cup pool

 Sania will seek medical opinion on her ankle at home 

New Delhi: India were clubbed with the top seed and two of the weaker teams in the Asia-Oceania zone group I tie of the Fed Cup women?s team tennis competition. 

As per Monday?s draw, the third seeds should have it relatively easy in the round-robin stage against Singapore and Kazakhstan, but will have to topple China and top pool A to make sure they reach the weekend final. 

The second and fourth seeds, Australia and Korea, were drawn with Chinese Taipei and New Zealand in pool B. 

As per the new format, the top team from each pool will play each other on Saturday and the winner will qualify for the world group 2 play-off match in July. 

The tie against China, fast emerging as the most powerful nation of the region, will thus decide India?s fate. 

The eight captains also agreed that the seeded teams in the league stage will play each other last. 

This gives some extra time for Sania Mirza to be ready for the crucial China tie, should she be cleared by her doctor to play. Sania, is due to fly back to Hyderabad on Tuesday to get medical opinion on her left ankle before rejoining the team the next day. 

The 18-year-old, India?s sole WTA Tour title-winner, has moved up two places to No. 73 in the latest world rankings. Sania, who hasn?t played an event since the Miami meet, has 464 points in her kitty. 

Captain Enrico Piperno said the draw could not have been more favourable to India. ?I am absolutely thrilled. It is a good draw. We have one top team and if we could beat them we would qualify. Ours is the weaker of the two groups,? he said. 

?Australia, we know, are a powerful team and New Zealand, Chinese Taipei and Korea all can pose serious challenge. I am happy, I am lucky we are not in pool B.? 

Piperno said he was waiting to know of Sania?s availability before finalising the singles combination. 

India play Singapore in their opening match on Wednesday, followed by the tie against Kazakhstan on Thursday. 

The first singles match of each tie will pit the number two players of the two teams, followed by the clash between the number ones and then the doubles. 

Shikha Uberoi, ranked 130, is thrilled at the prospect of playing her maiden Fed Cup for India. Rushmi Chakravarthi (No. 374) is also in great form, having reached her maiden $25,000 final in Mumbai last week. (PTI)

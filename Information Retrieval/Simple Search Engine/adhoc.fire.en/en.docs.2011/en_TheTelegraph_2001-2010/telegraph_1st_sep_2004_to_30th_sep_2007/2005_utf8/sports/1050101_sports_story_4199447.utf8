The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rest of World vs Australia one-dayer likely

Sydney: A one-day match, pitting world champions Australia against the game?s best cricketers, is being mooted to raise funds for tsunami victims. 

Tim May, chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers? Associations, had sent a proposal to all player associations seeking to know whether they would support a match to be played on either January 11 or 12. The proposal received an overwhelming response, following which it was put before the International Cricket Council (ICC) for official recognition. 

?The only reason why it would not get up would be if there was too much to do but I don?t think that is an excuse,? May was quoted as saying in The Herald Sun On Friday. ?It took only two minutes for the devastation to occur. It should not be too much trouble to organise a cricket match in 12 days,? he said. 

The match would be played in a one-day format between Australia and the Rest of the World. However, May said England and South Africa might be unable to take part in the game as they are in middle of a five-Test series hosted by the African nation. 

Though Sri Lanka, one of worst tsunami-hit countries, have postponed their tour of New Zealand, their players would be available for the charity match.

 Beloff may go by written submission

London: The ICC appeals commissioner Michael Beloff has indicated that he is likely to hear the appeal by Sourav Ganguly against his six ODI match ban based on the extensive written submissions from the Indian captain and match officials. 

Sourav had sought to have the matter heard at a second personal hearing via a telephone hook-up but Beloff has indicated that he believes that a hearing based on the written submissions is the appropriate way. 

Beloff has sought Sourav?s final comments as to why a personal hearing is required as a matter of urgency, the ICC said in a press release. (PTI)

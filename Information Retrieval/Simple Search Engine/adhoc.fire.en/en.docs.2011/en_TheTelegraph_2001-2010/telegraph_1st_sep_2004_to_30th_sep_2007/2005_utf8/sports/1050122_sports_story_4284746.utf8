 Annecy (France): French authorities have opened a preliminary inquiry into doping allegations made against six-time Tour de Fance winner Lance Armstrong in a book published last summer.

 Judicial officials confirmed the probe on Thursday but declined to give details, describing the case as confidential. The investigation centres on a magistrate?s interview with Armstrong?s former British assistant, Emma O?Reilly. Shortly before last year?s Tour de France, O?Reilly made allegations in a book, La Confidential, The Secrets of Lance Armstrong. She claimed that Armstrong sent her on long road trips to pick up pills and dispose of used syringes.

 ?I will make myself available anytime and anywhere to meet with the investigators in this case,? Armstrong later said in a statement. ?I am confident my name will be cleared and I look forward to racing in France for years to come.?

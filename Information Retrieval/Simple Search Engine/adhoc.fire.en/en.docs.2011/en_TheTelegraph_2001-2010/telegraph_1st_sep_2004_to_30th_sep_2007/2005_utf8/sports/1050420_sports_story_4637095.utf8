 Karthikeyan ready for Imola challenge

 Karthikeyan is happy with his fitness 

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan was happy with his fitness after undergoing a strenuous training for the San Marino Grand Prix coming up in Imola, Italy this weekend. 

?I did a lot of kilometres and I am particularly happy with my fitness. I do not really know what to expect from Imola because out of the Jordan drivers, I am the only one that has never driven on this circuit,? Karthikeyan said. 

?It looks like I will need to use the kerbs a lot to get a good time, which will probably be a bit tricky. But having said that, Malaysia was also difficult, however I did well there. So I am ready for the challenge and I will give my best.? 

Karthikeyan and Tiago Monteiro carried out two days of testing for Jordan Grand Prix on the circuit Paul Ricard, in the south of France on April 14 and 15, contributing to the team?s preparations for the San Marino Grand Prix. 

Karthikeyan completed the greatest number of laps on Thursday ? 183 laps. Between them the drivers clocked up a total testing mileage of over 1000km and fastest lap time was on the last day with Monteiro?s time of 1.00.505 (66 laps). 

The rookie Indian driver, who failed to finish the last GP in Bahrain, was hopeful of another decent finish in Imola next Sunday and was happy with the progress. 

?The test at Paul Ricard last week went very well. We did a lot of work trying to find the right Bridgestone tyres for San Marino but also for the next European races. We have also tested some new parts for the car and we are definitely making some progress,? Karthikeyan said in a press release by Jordan.

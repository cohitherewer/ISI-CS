 Newport: Britain?s Greg Rusedski became the third ?30-something? winner on the ATP Tour this year when he outlasted American Vince Spadea to retain his Hall of Fame title. Rusedski, seeded third, defeated second-seeded Spadea 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 6-4 to earn his second straight title and third overall at the $380,000 grasscourt tournament, which he also won in 1993.

 The 31-year-old joined 33-year-old Wayne Arthurs (Scottsdale) and 31-year-old Kenneth Carlsen (Memphis) as veteran titlists this season.

 Abinash fired first salvo in the first chukker and later scored two goals in second chukker to give a 3-1 lead. Mohammad Mushtaq scored the solitary goal for the visitors in the third chukker. 

 London: India?s Shiv Kapur failed in his bid to make it to the British Open at the course in Lundin, in the final local qualifiers before the year?s third major. Kapur, an Asian Tour regular in his rookie year, shot a first round 71 and then did not complete his second round.

 Daniel Chopra, a Swede of Indian descent, qualified through the final qualifying held in the United States last month.

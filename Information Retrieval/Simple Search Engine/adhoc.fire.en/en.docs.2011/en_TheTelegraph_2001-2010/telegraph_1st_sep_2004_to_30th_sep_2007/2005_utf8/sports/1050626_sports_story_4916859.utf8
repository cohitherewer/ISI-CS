 Ritwik is champion

Chennai: Delhis Ritwik Bhattacharya became the first Indian to win a world-level title at home when he stopped giant killer Siddarth Suchde, to win the 3rd ICL Chennai Open World Professional Squash Association (WPSA) championship on Saturday. 

Bhattacharya got past Suchde 11-5, 11-5, 11-7 in 41 minutes. 

Even before the title clash, Suchde was looking tired after a hard-fought wins over top-seed Kashif Shuja of New Zealand and Indias Saurav Ghosal. 

 Bhattacharya made Suchde run right from the first point. Though Suchde most often tried to counter attack, the world No. 59 showed his experience to win points on rallies. 

In fact, Ritwik led all the way in all three games to victory.

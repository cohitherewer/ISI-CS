 Inter face banned 2006

Geneva: Already knocked out of the Champions League, Inter Milan face a heavy price for the misbehavior of their fans ? including a ban from next season?s competition. 

Uefa will meet on Friday to consider sanctions against Inter, whose fans threw flares and bottles onto the field in the second half of Tuesday night?s quarter final match against AC Milan at San Siro, forcing the game to be cut short. One of the flares injured Milan goalkeeper Dida. 

?There is a huge range of punishments possible,? Uefa spokesman William Gaillard said. ?But it?s impossible to tell what the control and disciplinary body is going to decide.? 

Uefa could also heavily fine Inter or force the club to play its European home games in an empty stadium. 

Earlier this season in the Champions League, AS Roma?s stadium was closed to spectators for two games after referee Anders Frisk was hit on the head by an object thrown from the stands during a game against Dynamo Kiev. 

Milan have qualified for the semi-finals, but Uefa must still determine whether Tuesday night?s result should stand at 1-0 or whether to award the team a 3-0 victory ? the standard for an abandoned match. Milan won the first leg 2-0. 

?In terms of the result there?s no suspense, but it has to be confirmed officially,? Gaillard said. 

Inter Milan have a history of crowd trouble, having been ordered by Uefa to play two games away in 2001 after a Uefa Cup tie against Alaves was abandoned when Inter fans hurled seats and bottles on the field. No team has ever been thrown out of the Champions League. (AP)

 Chandigarh: India lifted the overall Muscat festival Olympic style wrestling Commonwealth Challenge Cup held recently. India defeated Canada 5-0 in the team event to claim the honours winning three golds, one silver and one bronze medal in the individual events. Shokinder Tomar (66 kg), Ravinder Kumar (84 kg) and Rajiv Tomar (120 kg) won the gold medals, Narender Tomar (74 kg) the silver and Naveen (96 kg) the bronze.

 Canada won two golds (74 kg and 96 kg), one silver (66 kg) and two bronze medals (84 kg and 120 kg) to finish second while Great Britain won three silver medals in 84, 96 and 120 kg categories and one bronze in 74 kg to be third behind India. 

 Jacksonville (Florida): Olympic swimming legends Ian Thorpe of Australia and Michael Phelps of the US appeared at the Super Bowl here to support New York?s bid for the 2012 summer Olympics. ?Thorpedo? won three gold medals and two silvers at the 2000 Sydney Games and added two golds, a silver and a bronze last year in Athens. Phelps won six gold medals and two silvers in Athens.

 International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials will make a visit later this month to New York, which is competing against Paris, London, Madrid and Moscow to host the 2012 Games. The decision will be made in July. Thorpe expressed confidence a New York Olympics would be successful even as he revelled in the hoopla of a Super Bowl weekend.

 Athens: Athens, Berlin and Moscow will present bids to host the 2005 swimming world championships to the sport?s ruling body Fina on Wednesday, swimming officials said on Monday. ?All three cities have been asked to go to Frankfurt and support their bids,? Greek swimming federation spokesman Fontas Chitas said. Fina took the championships away from Montreal last month because of financing problems. It plans to announce the new hosts by February 15.

 Athens, which hosted last summer?s successful Olympic Games, is emerging as the likely favourite. 

 Frankfurt: The ongoing match-fixing scandal in Germany has prompted European football?s governing body Uefa to draw up plans for legislation to stop all players, management and referees in Europe from betting on games. Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, president of the German football federation (DFB), confirmed Uefa was looking at bringing in a new law to ensure that the manipulation of matches does not become more widespread.

 ?Uefa wants to introduce a code of honour so that players, coaches, management and referees in Europe cannot bet on matches,? explained Mayer-Vorfelder. ?It is not just a German problem. Italy, Romania and the Czech Republic have also experienced problems with manipulation.? On January 27 of this year referee Robert Hoyzer admitted to fixing four matches for financial gain.

 Shanghai: Visitors to Shanghai will soon be able to take a spin around the city?s brand new Formula One circuit. But would-be racers first have to take a health check, pay up, put down a 20,000 yuan ($2,400) deposit and ?get some much needed training? before getting behind the wheel, the state-run Shanghai Daily reported Monday.

 The new service, beginning on the first day of the lunar new year, costs 100 yuan ($12) for once around the track in an ordinary BMW and 1,500 yuan ($182) for 15 minutes driving a Renault F1 car, the report said. The cost for driving one?s own car once around the circuit is 300 yuan ($36).

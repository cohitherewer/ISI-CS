 London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been offered a new contract by the Premier League club, his agent said on Wednesday.

 ?The negotiations are going well and nearing an end,? Jorge Mendes told a London evening paper. ?It will be concluded very soon, maybe even on Thursday.?

 Mourinho was handed a two-match touchline ban after Chelsea were found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute in the first knockout round against Barcelona. 

 Mourinho, whose existing contract with Chelsea was due to run out in 2007, has been offered a three-year extension worth ?5.2 million ($9.79 million) a year, according to the paper.

 The new deal would earn him a pay rise of ?1 million a year, added the report. 

 London: Tottenham Hotspur striker Robbie Keane has been fined ?10,000 ($18,820) by the club for an incident in last Saturday?s Premier League game at Birmingham City.

 Keane, one of the substitutes, was punished for showing dissent towards the Spurs management when it became clear he was not going to be used during the 1-1 draw at St Andrews. 

 Keane, who is in competition with England striker Jermain Defoe, Mido of Egypt and Mali?s Frederic Kanoute, has been unable to hold down a regular place in the Spurs starting line-up this season. 

 Frankfurt: Bundesliga referee Torsten Koop faces a six-month ban from the German football association (DFB) for not reporting his disgraced colleague Robert Hoyzer quickly enough.

 Koop informed the DFB in February that Hoyzer, who has admitted taking bribes of 67,000 euros ($86,340) to fix matches, had tried to recruit him to join a betting ring during the previous month.

 Meanwhile, German referee Dominik Marks was released on bail on Wednesday four weeks after his arrest under suspicion of match-fixing.

 Austin: Lance Armstrong has filed a counterclaim with a Texas judge asking for $125,000 from a former aide who earlier claimed he discovered steroids in the bathroom of cycling champion?s apartment, US media reported.

 It ?was an egregious character assassination founded upon a demonstrably false string of sensational, untrue and fabricated allegations,? the latest court documents from Armstrong?s lawyers stated on Tuesday.

 Riyadh: Some 6,500 athletes from 54 Muslim nations will assemble in Saudi Arabia this week for a sporting festival aimed at projecting a more positive image of Islam to the world. The first Islamic Solidarity Games will be formally opened on Friday, and will run until April 20.

 Nairobi: Armed thieves burst into Olympic 3,000m steeplechase champion Ezekiel Kemboi?s home on Monday and attempted to steal his gold medal. 

 Kemboi, who was not at home at the time, said intruders ordered his wife to hand over the medal and other valuables.

 ?They kept asking my wife where it was, but luckily I have deposited it in a bank for safe keeping,? he said on Wednesday.

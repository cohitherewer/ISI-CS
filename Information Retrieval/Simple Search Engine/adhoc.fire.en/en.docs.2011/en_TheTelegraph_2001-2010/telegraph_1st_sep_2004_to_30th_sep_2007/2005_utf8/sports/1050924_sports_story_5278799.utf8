 Theres still some tennis left: Paes 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jonas Bjorkman in New Delhi on Friday 

New Delhi: The Davis Cup World Group play-off tie is a match-and-a-half-old and the Swedes are looking good to fulfil their promise of being clear favourites. The talking point among the visitors at the end of Day I, though, was the low and at times uneven bounce of the temporary grasscourt laid at the R.K. Khanna Stadium. 

Im happy and lucky to have guys like Jonas (Bjorkman) and Thomas (Johansson) playing singles? they can adapt to any surface and any situation, as they showed in really trying conditions today (Friday), said Swedish captain Mats Wilander. 

If there are too many bad bounces, you can easily get upset. Both Jonas and Thomas stayed level-headed mentally and didnt let the conditions affect their composure, Wilander elaborated. 

He isnt, however, against grasscourt tennis. There should be more grasscourt tournaments other than Wimbledon and Queens. 

The eight-time Grand Slam singles winner conceded that his team was a bit lucky on Friday. The first match was close, the second (unfinished one) even more so? In fact, the first was Rohans, Thomas was lucky to get it, said Wilander. 

Leander Paes said he knew Bopanna had a big game. He took his chance well today (Friday) but came up a bit short? Had he won that first set, the tie could have turned on its head. Anyway, theres still some tennis left to be played over the next two days, Paes told The Telegraph. 

Wilander had high praise for Bjorkman. Jonas served better than Ive ever seen him do and volleyed very well? If he hadnt played at his best, it could have got very tricky for him. 

Amritraj wasnt too unhappy with his performance. I played okay, it was just that he was a little better today. 

His father felt experience made the difference. He (Prakash) will certainly be richer from this experience? He has to improve on his volleys and stretch a little more at net. remarked Vijay.

 Licence blow leaves Chandhok in lurch

New Delhi: Karun Chandhoks hopes of representing India in the A-1 Grand Prix suffered a blow on Thursday with the motorsports national governing body expressing its inability to give him a suitable drivers licence for the current season. 

Chandhok needed an Indian licence to be eligible to participate in the A-1 GP to be launched next month. 

But the Motorsports Association of India (MAI), citing international regulations, said in a press release that the Chennai lad had already driven with a British licence this year and cannot procure a fresh one till the end of the year. 

The A-1 GP will see teams competing against each other rather than individuals. 

Under the international sporting code of the FIA, the sports world governing body, the nationality of the driver is determined by his licence. 

Chandhok drove in the British F3 championship this year with a UK licence and so would be treated as a British national. 

The FIA code states that a driver wishing to procure a foreign licence would need the agreement of his parent association and his licence would stay for that whole year. But the code is silent on a situation when a driver wants to revert to his parent bodys licence. 

Chandhok has already surrendered his British licence. 

It is no secret that MAI president Nazir Hoosein and Karuns father Vicky Chandhok, a former national rally champion himself, dont see eye to eye. Hoosein, however, maintained that the issue was purely a regulatory matter. 

It is a regulatory issue and it is what the FIA says that matters, Hoosein said. The British MSA doesnt mind, neither has MAI objected (to Chandhok getting an Indian licence). The rules are clear. 

Chandhok can race in A1 GP as a British national or get his Indian licence after January 1, 2006, he added. (PTI)

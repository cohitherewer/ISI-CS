 Hondo scripts win

 Hondo took three for 36 

Dhaka: Fast bowler Douglas Hondo grabbed three wickets in four overs to bowl Zimbabwe to a 22-run victory over Bangladesh in the first one-day International here on Thursday. 

Chasing a stiff 252-run target on a slow pitch, Bangladesh were all out for 229 in the day-night game to concede a 0-1 lead in the five-match series. 

Earlier, Zimbabwe overcame a poor start to post a competitive total as middle-order batsmen Brendan Taylor (58) and Hamilton Masakadza (54) slammed half-centuries. 

Bangladesh, who had never chased more than 237 to win a one-dayer, were well-placed at 119 for two in the 27th over before losing their way under lights. They were in deep trouble when they lost their next four wickets in the space of 24 runs. 

Man-of-the-Match Hondo wrecked the middleorder, dismissing Aftab Ahmed, Alok Kapali and Khaled Mashud to finish with three for 36. 

Zimbabwe were earlier struggling at 14 for two after electing to bat before Taylor and Masakadza propped up the innings with half-centuries. 

Elton Chigumbura then built on the duo?s efforts with a 32-ball 41 in the closing stages. He was later barred from bowling in his last over for sending down a second beamer. (AFP)

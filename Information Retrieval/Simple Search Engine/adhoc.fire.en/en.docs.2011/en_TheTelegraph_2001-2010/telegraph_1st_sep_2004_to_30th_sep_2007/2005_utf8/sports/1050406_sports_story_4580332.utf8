Visakhapatnam: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer admitted on Tuesday that his team was outplayed by Indian batsmen in the second one-day International. 

?India played outstanding cricket. Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virender Sehwag played fantastic cricket. We were simply outplayed by a better side,? Woolmer told a press conference after the match. 

?The key to losing the game here was our bowling in the morning. Later, though we batted well, we lost wickets at crucial stages,? he pointed out. 

?The euphoria of Bangalore has been shelved. We are not doing right things at the right time. This is a worry. 

?We need to go back to the drawing room, rethink our plans and hope we can make up the 0-2 deficit and come back into the series,? Woolmer hoped. 

Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, meanwhile, was guarding against complacency. 

?The series is not over. There are still four matches to go, so anything can happen,? he said. 

On his own form, he reiterated that he couldn?t carry his efforts at the nets to the match. ?I have been doing everything at nets. May be I need little bit of luck,? he added.

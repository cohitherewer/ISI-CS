 Madrid: Real Madrid striker Ronaldo is doubtful for Saturday?s league match against Athletic Bilbao after returning from his lavish Valentine?s Day engagement party in Paris with an injury to his toe.

 Club medical staff said that the Brazilian was suffering from inflammation of the big toe on his left foot and would undergo physiotherapy to deal with the problem. 

 Ronaldo turned up late for training on Tuesday after being delayed on his return from the celebrations at a secluded chateau near Paris and also missed the first 15 minutes of the session on Wednesday.

 According to a local daily, the 28-year-old would be fined by the club because of his late arrival.Ronaldo turned up on time on Thursday, but pulled up after a few minutes and it now looks unlikely that he will play against Bilbao. England striker Michael Owen will take Ronaldo?s place in the starting line-up if he fails to recover in time. 

 Paris: Fabien Barthez may be punished after a referee said the Olympique Marseille goalkeeper spat at him during a friendly with Morocco?s Wydad Casablanca on Saturday. 

 Referee Abdella El Achiri said he was going to report the incident to the Moroccan soccer federation, a sports daily reported on Thursday.

 ?I was a bit surprised to see Barthez coming towards me on the pitch as he had been replaced at the interval,? El Achiri said. ?He came up to me, he insulted me and he spat at me.?

 The match was stopped when a brawl erupted in the 80th minute while the Moroccan hosts were leading 2-1, which was the final score.

 Borussia said without a restructuring it expected its record debt to increase to 134.7 million euros ($175.4 million) by mid-2006.

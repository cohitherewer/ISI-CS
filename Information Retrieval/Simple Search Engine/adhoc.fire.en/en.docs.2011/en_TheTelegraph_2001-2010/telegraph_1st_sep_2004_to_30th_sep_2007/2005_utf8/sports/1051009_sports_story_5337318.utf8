The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Call for selectors with stature

 - RESTRUCTURING OF PANELS Former chief selector Patel wants coach to have a vote 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Brijesh Patel 

Calcutta: Its not clear when the Boards adjourned AGM is being reconvened, but the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) is hoping its proposal on restructuring of the national selection committees is discussed whenever the 30 affiliates get to meet all over again. 

The KSCA, it may be recalled, has called for abolishing the zonal system and the pruning of both the senior and junior committees from five to three members each. 

Specifically, the proposal states: ? This will help in ensuring that selection takes place purely on merit and not on regional representation or quota system. 

The language couldnt have been more blunt and, frankly, is an indictment of whatever has been practised till now. 

If the proposal is adopted, those wanting the Board to be run professionally are going to have something to cheer about. 

Elaborating, KSCA secretary Brijesh Patel (incidentally, a former chief selector) told The Telegraph: We want people of stature to serve on the committees. And, if needed, the Board should pay them ? thereby making the selectors more accountable. 

The senior committee, according to him, must comprise those with a minimum experience of 20 Tests. 

Patel explained: That way, the committee will have enough weight of big-time cricket and nobody can question its wisdom. 

Currently, those (particularly from Central and East) who havent even played ODIs make it to the senior committee. 

In Patels view, the restructured committees may have two-year terms instead of the existing 12 months. Among other things, continuity wont suffer. 

The appointments should be left to a panel formed either by the Board president himself or the general body? For obvious reasons, it must not be large, he pointed out. 

Patel (the ruling groups candidate for joint-secretary), by the way, favours the coach getting a vote at selection meetings. 

Im all for the coach ? not the captain, though ? having a formal say? Otherwise, having a coach is a waste of time, he remarked. 

Why not the captain, too? 

Because there can be situations when the captain has to be dropped. He cant sit in judgement on his own fate, Patel countered. 

Its an interesting take.

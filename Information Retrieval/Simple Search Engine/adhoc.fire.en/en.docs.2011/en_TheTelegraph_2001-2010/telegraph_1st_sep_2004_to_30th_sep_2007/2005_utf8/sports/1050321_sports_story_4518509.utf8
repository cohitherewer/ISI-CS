 ICC not keen on second neutral umpire for ODIs

Calcutta: The ICC is not too keen to introduce a second neutral umpire for ODIs, despite Pakistan?s call for it. 

The ICC president Ehsan Mani said at the Eden on Sunday that prospects for the umpires to vie for top slot (Elite Panel) might be affected if ODIs were to go Tests? way. 

?It?s true, the players always want best umpires on the field. But if we introduce two neutral umpires for an ODI, the chances of home umpires will be minimised. Besides, performances of umpires from each country are periodically evaluated so that there remains competition for Elite Umpire slots,? Mani said. 

Amid controversies surrounding Steve Bucknor?s decision to rule Sachin Tendulkar out, the ICC is keen to raise the bar for the umpires. 

?We are aware that a wrong decision can turn a match in somebody?s favour. We are keen to improve the rate of correct decisions. We scrutinise through CD all (controversial) decisions and see if any umpire has any specific problem,? Mani said. 

Mani pointed out in this connection that a Sri Lankan umpire ?was found to have troubles with balls pitching on leg side while giving his verdicts. So he was taken out of the Elite Panel (of umpires). 

ICC, meanwhile, is mulling an eight-team format for the Champions Trophy. Mani admitted that the last year?s meet got diluted with 12 teams, including minnows, in fray. According to him, top five teams may get direct entry, leaving others to qualify. 

Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Mani voiced concern over the on-field deaths in soccer, but said the ICC hasn?t yet thought about periodical check-ups of all players like Fifa. 

Kotla confirmed 

Meanwhile, BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra confirmed on Sunday that New Delhi will host the sixth and final ODI between India and Pakistan on April 17. 

?The BCCI pitch and ground committee will inspect the Kotla soon,? he said.

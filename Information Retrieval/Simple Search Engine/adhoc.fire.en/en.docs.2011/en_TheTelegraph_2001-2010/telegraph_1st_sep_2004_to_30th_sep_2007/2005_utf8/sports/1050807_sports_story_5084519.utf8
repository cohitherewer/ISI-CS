 Kluft falls behind Barber

 - First gold of meet to Equadors Perez Gatlin eases into 100m semis 

Helsinki: Ecuadors Jefferson Perez won the first gold medal of World Athletic Championships when he retained his title in the mens 20 km walk on Saturday. 

Spaniard Francisco Javier Fernandez, the pre-race favourite, led for most of the race before finishing second behind Perez, just as he did in Paris two years ago. Spains Juan Manuel Molina took the bronze. 

Perez, the world record holder who became Ecuadors first Olympic medallist in Atlanta in 1996, won in 1::18:35. 

Russian Ilya Markov, the 1999 world champion, was disqualified from the race after receiving three warnings. 

American Adam Nelson finally won the world title that has eluded him four times when he took the mens shot put gold. 

Nelson, silver medallist at the past two Olympics and two world championships, hurled the shot 21.73m with the first of his six attempts. 

Dutchman Rutger Smith was second and German Ralf Bartels edged out Olympic champion Yuriy Bilonoh of Ukraine to take the bronze. 

Teenager Tirunesh Dibaba led an Ethiopian clean sweep in the womens 10,000m final. 

The 19-year-old Dibaba, the 2003 world 5,000 gold medallist who also won the long and short course world cross country titles this year, beat defending champion Berhane Adere into second place in 30:24.02. 

Adere clocked 30:25.41, and the bronze medal went to Dibabas older sister Ejegayehu Dibaba, who ran 30:26.00. 

Olympic champion Xing Huina of China was fourth, while Briton Paula Radcliffe set the pace until just over halfway before dropping back into the leading pack to finish ninth. 

Earlier, Olympic champion Justin Gatlin was confident of winning the gold medal after qualifying for the 100m semi-finals at the 

Defending world champion Kim Collins, however, only scraped into the next round as a fastest loser by just 0.02 seconds. 

The 29-year-old from Saint Kitts and Nevis ran a poor first half of the race and finished fourth in the second heat in 10.32, well down on American Leonard Scott, who clocked 10.19. 

After his customary slow start, Gatlin moved ahead before easing down over the final few metres to win the first quarter final in 10.27, just ahead of Jamaicas Dwight Thomas. 

I was a little bombed, it was a strong headwind, Gatlin said. I havent run that slow in a long time. Tomorrow Im going to come out blazing. Rain, sleet, snow? it doesnt matter, Im going to win the gold medal. 

Gatlin, 23, is favourite for the title in Sundays final after world record holder Asafa Powell of Jamaica pulled out with a groin injury. 

Trinidadian Darrel Brown, world silver medallist in 2003, was the fastest athlete of the round, winning the fourth and final heat in 10.10. 

Ronald Pognon, the first Frenchman under 10 seconds when he clocked 9.99 last month, was runner-up to Brown in 10.11. 

Americas hopes of a medal sweep were kept alive when Olympic 200m champion Shawn Crawford finished behind Portugals Francis Obikwelu, the 100 silver medallist in Athens. 

Crawford is not running the 200 in Helsinki because of a foot injury. 

Defending world heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft, nursing an ankle injury, recovered from a below-par start to narrow Eunice Barbers advantage after three events in a thrilling duel on Saturday. 

The effervescent Swede, who has dominated the seven-event competition since winning the European title in 2002, recorded a lifetime best of 15.02m in the shot put to revive her gold medal hopes after Barber had scorched into a 153-point lead. 

Frenchwoman Barber, the 1999 world champion and 2003 silver medallist, leads with 2,993 points, 32 ahead of Kluft on 2,961. Lithuanias Austra Skujyte, the Olympic silver medallist, lies third with 2919. 

American Adam Nelson finally won the world title that has eluded him four times when he took the mens shot put gold. 

Nelson, silver medallist at the past two Olympics and two world championships, hurled the shot 21.73m with the first of his six attempts. 

Dutchman Rutger Smith was second and German Ralf Bartels edged out Olympic champion Yuriy Bilonoh of Ukraine to take the bronze. 

Earlier, John Godinas quest for a fourth world shot put title ended in the qualifying round when a daunting list of illness and injury caught up with the 33-year-old American. 

I had four injuries in eight weeks and pretty major illnesses, he said. 

Godina, who had never before failed to reach a world final after winning the 1995 title, said he had suffered injuries to both elbows and his right hand. He had also been struck twice by a stomach virus that resulted in him losing 5kg in weight. 

Another athlete hit by injury, defending 400 metres hurdles champion Felix Sanchez, finished second in his first round heat but was in obvious pain after the race. 

Sanchez, who has been fighting injury since failing to finish in the Brussels Golden League meeting last year after winning the Olympic title in Athens, said he would need surgery on his right foot. 

Gowda falls short 

Indias national record holder Vikas Gowda just missed making the mens discus throw final on Saturday. 

Gowda, ranked 29th in the world, managed a best effort of 62.04 metres, falling agonisingly short of the qualifying mark. 

Only 10 of the 27 athletes in the qualifying event managed to breach the cut-off mark of 63.50m for a 12- berth final line-up.

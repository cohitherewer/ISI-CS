 United held 0-0

 - FA CUP 

- Shock exit for City, Villa 

 Exeter City captain Sean Divine celebrates after holding United goalless at Old Trafford on Saturday 

London: FA Cup holders Manchester United were sensationally held to a 0-0 home draw by minor league Exeter City as Manchester City and Aston Villa suffered third-round exits on Saturday. 

Premier League leaders Chelsea had to come from behind to beat fourth division side Scunthorpe United 3-1, and League Cup holders Middlesbrough needed second-half goals for a 2-1 comeback win over fourth division Notts County. 

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson paid the price for using second and third-string players against Exeter, who weathered a late storm as internationals Paul Scholes, Alan Smith and Cristiano Ronaldo came on as substitutes at Old Trafford. 

Manchester City were the biggest losers, going down 1-0 to third division strugglers Oldham in a local derby, while three struggling Premier League sides lost to second division clubs bidding for promotion. 

Villa, with only one win in their previous eight games, lost 3-1 at Sheffield United after taking the lead, and Norwich City and Crystal Palace also went out of the competition. 

Norwich were beaten 1-0 at West Ham United, while Palace surrendered the lead in a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, Marcus Stewart converting a match-winning penalty on the hour. 

Though they were on the ropes in the closing stages, Exeter made a bright start to their dream tie at Old Trafford, with Dean Moxey missing the best chance of the first half. 

Ferguson threw on his regulars during the closing stages but the holders still face an unexpected trip to Exeter?s St James? Park ground on January 18. Chelsea also had to struggle against rank outsiders at Stamford Bridge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No domestic cricket for Tendulkar

 - Elbow still tender, says physio Leipus 

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar will not play any domestic cricket in the remainder of the current season to give sufficient rest to his left elbow, Indian team physio Andrew Leipus said Friday. 

?I had spoken to a leading elbow surgeon in Australia yesterday and his advice communicated to Sachin is that he should rest his elbow. He will not play any domestic cricket this season,? Leipus told reporters at the Wankhede Stadium here. 

Sachin missed nearly three months of cricket after he was afflicted with a tennis elbow. He could not play in the Holland triangular series, the NatWest Challenge and the ICC Champions Trophy in August-September. 

The champion batsman also missed the first two Tests of the four-match series against Australia at home. 

?Tendulkar?s elbow is still tender and he has been advised not to play any domestic cricket,? Leipus added. 

Leipus also said he was set to meet Jagmohan Dalmiya next week in Calcutta to discuss his future role with the Indian team. 

?I am not going to be connected with the Indian team in the same role any more. I am going back to Australia to pursue my studies and upgrade my skills on physiotherapy from February. It?s a four-month course and afterwards I intend to continue the study through correspondence,? Leipus said. 

But Leipus said he would continue his association with the Indian team if given a chance to work on a part-time basis by the BCCI. 

?I am also interested in interacting more at the junior level and with other sports disciplines also if invited,? Leipus said. 

Leipus is to remain in India throughout January during which he would make a visit to the Bangalore-based National Cricket Academy. 

?I also want to see the progress made by Laxmipathy Balaji who I may see either in Bangalore or Chennai,? he said. 

On the injury sustained by left-arm pacer Irfan Pathan in Bangladesh, Leipus said at the moment the abdomen strain, suffered after his fall during the second Test in Chittagong, was not too serious but it needed rest. 

?Otherwise there are chances it may become worse,? the physio added. 

On Ajit Agarkar missing the Mumbai-Delhi Ranji Trophy Elite division group A match, which commenced here Friday, Leipus said he has suffered a lot of muscle loss. 

?He was assessed in Bangladesh (during the three-match limited-over series) and it was found Ajit has a lot of muscle loss all over his body after having bowled a lot in domestic cricket. And that is why he was advised rest.? 

Regarding the overall fitness levels of the Indian players since he took over five years ago, Leipus said things had improved a lot but more needed to be done especially in the off-season.

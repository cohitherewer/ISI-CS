The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Israel hold France 1-1

 David Beckham celebrates after scoring England?s second goal against Azerbaijan during their World Cup qualifier in Newcastle on Wednesday. 

England were expected to put a hatful of goals past the former Soviet Republic but it was not to be while 10-man France could only manage a 1-1 draw in Israel and Spain?s travels to Serbia and Montenegro finished 0-0 on Wednesday. 

It took 51 minutes for midfielder Gerrard to break the deadlock before Beckham beat the offside trap to seal victory 11 minutes later. 

England remain top of group six on 16 points, one ahead of Poland who beat Northern Ireland 1-0 in Warsaw. Beckham, under-fire for some poor recent international performances, insisted that the criticisms had not driven him on. 

France meanwhile paid the price of hero-to-villain David Trezeguet being sent off for head-butting. Israel?s Walid Badier scored a late equaliser at Tel Aviv?s Ramat Gan Stadium to keep group 4 wide open. 

France, who have only beaten Cyprus and Faroe Islands so far, top the group on 10 points with Israel but Switzerland and the Republic of Ireland are just one point further back with a game in hand. 

Trezeguet?s 31st goal in 58 appearances put him ahead of legend Just Fontaine into second place behind the 41 of Michel Platini in France?s all-time scoring list. 

France coach Raymond Domenech said afterwards: ?I?m disappointed by the result. We showed quality in our play until the goal and they had not had a chance until that point. But after the sending off, we really suffered when they pushed forward. It?s a pity because there wasn?t much between the two sides.? 

Five minutes after the break, France got the breakthrough goal. Sylvain Wiltord crossed from the right to the far post and Trezeguet?s downward header found the net after making the most of poor Israeli defending. 

Trezeguet was not on the pitch much longer, however. He was sent off in the 57th minute for head butting Tal Ben Haim moments after he suffered a late tackle from him. 

Badier?s equaliser came in the 83rd minute which had most of the 43,000 crowd celebrating. From an Adoram Keisi centre on the left, unmarked Badier headed home at the far post after ?keeper Fabien Barthez could only get his fingertips to the cross. (AFP)

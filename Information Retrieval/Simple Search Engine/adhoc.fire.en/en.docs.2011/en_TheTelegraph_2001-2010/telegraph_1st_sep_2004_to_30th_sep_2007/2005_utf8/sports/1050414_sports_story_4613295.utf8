 Daniel bags title on last day 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Daniel David saddled five winners while fellow-professional Vijay Singh won none, on Wednesday, the concluding day of the winter season. Therefore Daniel, who was trailing Vijay by a point at the championship table before the start of the day?s programme, had an easy passage to the top.

 Jockey Imran Chisty helped Daniel win three races, including the feature event, the Romantic Memories Cup, which was an easy pick for his prized four-year-old filly Pacific Jewel. Beauchamp Hero and Ocean Spirit were the other winners Chisty booted home.

 The afternoon also witnessed young apprentice Afzal Khan winning the first race of his short career. Afzal, son of jockey Asghar, had started donning silk from April 1. The young boy has a good seat and balances himself well on horses.

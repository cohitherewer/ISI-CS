 Chelsea ride Drogba double 

Cardiff: Two goals from Didier Drogba gave champions Chelsea the best possible start to the new season with a 2-1 victory over likely title-rivals Arsenal in the Community Shield match on Sunday. 

The Ivory Coast striker opened the scoring from close range in the eighth minute before adding the second with a superb solo effort 12 minutes into the second period. 

 Francesc Fabregas got one back seven minutes later to give FA Cup winners Arsenal hope but a myriad of second-half substitutions affected the cohesion of what had been a cagey contest at the Millennium Stadium. 

It was the third time Chelsea had won English footballs traditional season-opener and a first victory over their London rivals in a domestic match since November 1998. 

Despite starting with two wingers in Damien Duff and Arjen Robben, Chelsea failed to get much width and their early attacks came through long balls launched towards Drogba and Eidur Gudjohnsen up front. 

The tactic, though crude, proved effective after eight minutes when new signing Asier Del Horno lofted a pass from left midfield towards Drogba, who had got in front of Swiss defender Philippe Senderos on the edge of the box. 

The Ivory Coast striker took the ball on his chest before clipping a half-volley over Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann with his left foot to send the blue half of the 58,040 crowd wild with delight. 

Arsenal pressed forward but for all the skill of their talented forwards, they spent most of their time skirmishing around the edge of the box and failed to really trouble the Chelsea goalkeeper until 10 minutes before half time. 

Indeed, it was an Arsenal defender who finally forced the save from Petr Cech, Kolo Toure firing in a shot from just outside the box which the Czech pushed past his post at full stretch. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger made three changes at half-time but it was Chelsea who grabbed the initiative in the second period with Drogbas second goal. 

The 27-year-old outmuscled Senderos to get through on goal, put the ball round Lehmann and almost lost it to Toure before turning and lashing the ball into the net. 

Chelsea were not allowed to take it easy, however, and Fabregas, expected to fill the huge shoes of the departed Patrick Vieira, got one back for Arsenal with a good run and neat finish after 64 minutes. 

Thereafter the game opened up a bit with much more goalmouth incident than in the first hour and, while there was no lack of endeavour, the frequent substitutions inevitably diluted the quality. 

Wenger will have been pleased by the performance of new signing Alexander Hleb in midfield, while Chelseas ?21 million buy from Manchester City Sean Wright-Phillips replaced Robben on the wing for the last 21 minutes. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Next EB-Bagan derby on April 24

 Margao: The AIFF has announced the second phase draw of National Football League from Round 12 to 22. 

The next East Bengal-Mohun Bagan derby, a match which under the present circumstances is unlikely to have any bearing on East Bengal?s march towards the title, will be held on April 24. 

The exact dates of the matches of Round 22, which will be played between May 20 and 22, will be announced later, according to a statement by AIFF secretary, Alberto Colaco. 

The Super Cup match will be played on May 28. 

East Bengal?s main rivals Dempo Sports Club and Mahindra United would be banking heavily on a more positive outcome in the second phase after the red-golds have opened up a considerable lead with two matches still to go before the completion of the first leg.

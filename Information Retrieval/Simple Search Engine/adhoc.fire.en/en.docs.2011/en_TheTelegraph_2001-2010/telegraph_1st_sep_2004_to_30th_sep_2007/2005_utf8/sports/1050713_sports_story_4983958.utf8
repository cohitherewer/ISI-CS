 Competitive season on cards 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Horse strength has increased, by about 15 per cent compared to the last monsoon season, but falling attendance and poor betting collections are the two things worrying the RCTC as the club gears up for the year 2005 edition of the season. 

 The 15-day season, which has already been reduced by a day, starts from Thursday with a six-event race card.

 No significant changes may surface during the forthcoming season, said Sujit Bhattach-aryya, steward, RCTC, at the press-meet on Tuesday. I expect the season to be competitive, he added. Bhattacharyya, however, said on the sidelines of the meeting that the stewards were working very hard since the past 

 18 month to add colour to the wet season. Positives may reflect on RCTCs racing only after about an year.

 A total of 282 horses, including 129 five-year-olds and about 40 three-year-olds, will be seen in action during the season which ends on October 13.

 Normally, one expects six-event cards during the season but the club was prepared to frame seven races on some occasions to compensate for the already cancelled fixture.

 No new professional figures in the list supplied by the club but trainer Farley Rodrigues swelling horse strength of 24 surely suggests that nearly half of the total 282 horses will don the popular colours of the South India racing baron, Dr MAM Ramaswamy and company.

 Our Turf Correspondent adds: The following horses need watching during the season: Bold Raider, Anzello, The Polynesian, Alaskan, La Fantasie, Mighty Force, Serengeitti, Generous Gesture, Mythical Star, Karans Choice, Arrayal, Mighty Flash, Noble Falcon, Secret Desire, Magical Strike and Noble Flash.

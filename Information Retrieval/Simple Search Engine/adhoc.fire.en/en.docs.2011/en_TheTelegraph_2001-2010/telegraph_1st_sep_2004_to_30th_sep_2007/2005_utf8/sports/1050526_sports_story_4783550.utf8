 Marions Dutch date on Sunday

Amsterdam: Marion Jones will compete in the 100 m Sunday at the FBK Games in Hengelo, Netherlands, in what will be her first appearance in Europe this season, organisers said Tuesday. 

Theres no reason to stop Marion Jones from participating in the FBK Games, meet director Fedde Zwanenburg said. 

He said meet officials had granted her request to compete in the 100 m race and had also reached a financial agreement with her. Terms were not released. 

No punishment can or should be given (to Jones) before the rules in question have actually been shown to have been broken, said Zwanenburg, calling the American a fantastic athlete who will also bring us needed publicity. 

The American sprinter has been shunned by many European meet organisers since being linked to the Balco steroid scandal in the United States. The Euro Meetings Group, which represents many of Europes top meets including the FBK Games, has recommended not inviting Jones to any event. 

Jones is also expected to run on June 1 in Milan. 

Marion is delighted that some European meet directors have the courage and the integrity to do the right thing, her attorney, Rich Nichols, said in an e-mail to the associated press. 

Jones has never been charged with any doping violations. She denies using performance-enhancing drugs, and has never failed a drug test. (AP)

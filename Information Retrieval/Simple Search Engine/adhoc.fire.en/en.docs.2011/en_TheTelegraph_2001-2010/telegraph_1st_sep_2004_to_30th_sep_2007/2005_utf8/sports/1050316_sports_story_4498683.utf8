 Lack of enthusiasm to blame: Batistuta

Buenos Aires: Argentina?s record international goal-scorer Gabriel Batistuta has blamed a lack of enthusiasm for his decision to retire at the age of 36. 

The former Fiorentina and AS Roma striker, whose haul of 56 goals in 78 internationals included 10 at World Cups, announced his decision from Qatar on Sunday, where he had been playing for Al Arabi since August 2003. ?Everything has a end,? he told Argentine television. ?Training for me was not the same any more, my enthusiasm was waning. So the time arrived to say goodbye to football. I?m ready for other challenges.?

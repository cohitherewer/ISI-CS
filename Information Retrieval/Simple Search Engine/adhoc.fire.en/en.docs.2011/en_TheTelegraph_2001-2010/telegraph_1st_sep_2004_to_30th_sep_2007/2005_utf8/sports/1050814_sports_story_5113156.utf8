 Anand opens up 3-point lead vs Grischuk

Mainz: World rapid chess champion Viswanathan Anand surged to a three-point lead over Russian GM Alexander Grischuk after adding 1.5 points from the third and fourth games of the Grenkeleasing Championship, the main event of the Mainz Classic. 

With 3.5 points from just four games, Anand has almost assured himself of a fifth straight victory in Mainz as he now requires just one point from the remaining four games. 

After clinching the first two games, the Indian ace got a bit lucky in next two as he drew the third with white and won the fourth from a difficult position. In the third game, the Indian faced stiff resistance from Grischuk who had come well-armed against the English attack. The moves were same as the second game but Grischuk had a better plan up his sleeve to counter the white pieces. 

Anand sensed trouble in the middlegame when Grischuk went for a piece sacrifice and opted for a safer approach leading to a balanced endgame. The draw was agreed to in just 24 moves. 

In the fourth game, playing the white side of a Queens Indian, Grischuk did everything right to tighten the noose in the middlegame but fumbled under time pressure to let the game slip from his grasp. 

It was in the middlegame that Grischuk uncorked a fine attacking plan and got his rook to penetrate into the heart of blacks position. But when the opportunity presented itself, the Russian crumbled once more. 

Meanwhile, Levon Aronian of Armenia won the Finet 960 Open tournament scoring 10 points out of a possible 11. 

World junior champion P. Harikrishna had to be content with 32nd place with seven points to his credit. (PTI)

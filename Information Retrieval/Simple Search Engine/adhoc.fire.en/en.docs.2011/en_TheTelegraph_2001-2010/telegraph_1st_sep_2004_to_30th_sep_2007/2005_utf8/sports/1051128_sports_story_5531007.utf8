 Uthappa hits 76

New Delhi: Indian Board Presidents XI openers Robin Uthappa and Shikhar Dhawan hit fifties against a struggling Sri Lanka on the rain-hit second day of their three-day game in Bangalore on Sunday. 

Uthappa hit a breezy 76 and left-hander Dhawan a patient 65 with the young pair adding 133 runs to guide the hosts to 217 for two wickets at stumps.

 Atwal ends 59th 

Reno (Nevada): Arjun Atwal began the final day with a birdie and ended with a birdie-eagle sequence, but in between rode a roller-coaster to bring in a two-over 74 at the Reno-Tahoe Open on Sunday. 

Atwals final-day effort took his total to one-under 287, that gave him only the 59th place and $6,510 at the $3 million event. 

Vaughn Taylor, meanwhile, retained the title with a scoring record on Sunday en route to a three-stroke victory over Jonathan Kaye. 

Atwal opened with a birdie on the first and then bogeyed the third, but again birdied the sixth. He followed that up with a bogey the ninth to be even at the turn. 

He picked up a shot on 11th, but gave two away on the very next. Yet another bogey followed on the 14th and a triple on the 15th, where he lost the ball. A birdie on 17th and an eagle on par-4 18th gave him something to smile at the end. 

This was Atwals lowest finish after making a cut. His only missed cut this season was at the PGA Championships. (PTI)

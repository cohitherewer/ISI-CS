 Dravid moves up to No. 6

Dubai: Indias victory over Sri Lanka has been a triumph not just for the team but also for several individuals, who have surged up the International Cricket Council (ICC) player rankings. 

Rahul Dravid, who moved up 18 places to No. 6, is now Indias top-rated batsman and is close to his highest-ever rating, while Sachin Tendulkar has also returned to the top ten, in joint ninth spot, after his long-term elbow injury. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni has smashed into the top 20, and he now occupies the 16th place in the batting listings. 

The news is just as good for India with the ball. Irfan Pathan has moved into the top ten (10th) and they have two other bowlers, Harbhajan Singh (13th) and Ajit Agarkar (16th), in the top 20.

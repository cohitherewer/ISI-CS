 Rosset quits pro circuit

Basel: Former Olympic gold medallist Marc Rosset is putting an end to his turbulent tennis career after 17 years on the professional circuit. 

The 35-year-old Genevan will retire following this weeks Swiss Indoors meet where he is playing doubles. I actually made the decision a few months ago, Rosset said on Tuesday. 

I was still playing (on the Challenger circuit) at the start of the year, but then I had a tough time with the death of a friend, so I decided I wouldnt play again. 

Some friends talked me into playing one more time in Basel and, although Im not fond of people making a fuss over me, I thought why not? 

Rosset won 15 singles and eight doubles titles in his career, reached the semi-finals of the French Open in 1996 and won the doubles in 1992.

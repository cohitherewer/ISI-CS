 Heath Streak quits international cricket

 Heath Streak

Durban: Heath Streak has retired from international cricket to captain English county Warwickshire. 

Former Zimbabwe captain Streak, 31, said his decision was prompted by financial and personal considerations. 

Ive retired to perform my duties for Warwickshire, who have offered me a two-year contract and want to appoint me as captain, Streak said from his farm near Bulawayo on Tuesday. 

In terms of the financial aspects its a significant improvement for me and this will also leave six months of the year open for me. It will be good to be able to spend time with my family. 

Streak played 65 Test matches and captained Zimbabwe in 21 of them, a Zimbabwe record he shares with Alistair Campbell. 

Zimbabwe achieved four of their eight Test wins under Streak, making him the countrys most successful captain. 

Streak, a fast bowler who grew into an allrounder, carried the Zimbabwe attack for much of his career and is unquestionably among the greatest players his country has produced. 

His tenure as captain ended in April 2004 when he questioned Zimbabwes selection policies which he viewed as racially biased. 

Streaks removal as captain led to a walkout of 15 of Zimbabwes most senior players, and began the countrys spiral from beatable but feisty opponents to a weak team that has lost five of their last six Tests by an innings and gone down by 10 wickets in the other. 

Streak and some of the other rebel players later returned to the Zimbabwe fold. 

Asked if the uncertainties of playing for Zimbabwe influenced his decision to retire, Streak said: The stability of county cricket and the enjoyment I get out of it is also important to me. 

He conceded that it would be difficult to let go after 12 years, but added that he may still have a role to play in the game in his country. 

I havent closed the door on future involvement in Zimbabwe cricket in areas such as commentary and coaching. 

Streak took 216 Test wickets, a Zimbabwe record, at an average of 28.14. He has played for Warwickshire for the past two seasons.

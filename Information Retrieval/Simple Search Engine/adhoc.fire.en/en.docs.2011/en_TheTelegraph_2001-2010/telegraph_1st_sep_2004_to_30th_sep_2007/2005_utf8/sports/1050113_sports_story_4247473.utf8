 Windies, Pak bracing for Aussie challenge

 Razzaq hit a quickfire 89 n.o. vs Australia A 

Melbourne: The West Indies are brimming with confidence and Pakistan slowly gathering momentum as they prepare to challenge Australia in a triangular one-day series starting on Friday. 

?Winning the ICC Champions Trophy has put us in good stead. The team is pretty confident,? West Indies batsman Wavell Hinds told reporters at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday. The guys have started to believe in themselves a little more.? 

World champions Australia open the triangular series against the West Indies in Melbourne on Friday, followed by Australia versus Pakistan on Sunday. 

?They (Australia) are the benchmark of international teams,? Hinds added. ?It is two champion teams against each other and we are very much motivated and can?t wait for the game on Friday.? 

West Indies paceman Reon King added: ?They are intimidating. But if you do the basics well, I think they are beatable.? 

Brian Lara?s West Indies side have had a three-month break since winning the ICC Champions Trophy at The Oval in September. Australia crashed out in the semi-finals against England. 

The West Indies have shown mixed form in their warm-up games. Lara scored a magnificent unbeaten 116 to lead the tourists to a four-wicket win over Australia A in Hobart on January 8, but with the 35-year-old left-hander resting the next day, Australia A won by 51 runs. 

Australia do have question marks over their batting, however, with opener Matthew Hayden rested for the first two matches because of fatigue and Michael Clarke struggling with a foot complaint. 

Pakistan beat Australia A by 13 runs on Wednesday in what captain Inzamam-ul-Haq described as an important win for his team after three heavy losses in the Test series against Australia. 

The 34-year-old Inzamam and paceman Shoaib Akhtar both have back complaints but are expected to play on Sunday. 

Abdul Razzaq hammered an unbeaten 89 from 61 balls and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan produced a last-gasp three-wicket burst, sealed with eight balls to spare. (Reuters)

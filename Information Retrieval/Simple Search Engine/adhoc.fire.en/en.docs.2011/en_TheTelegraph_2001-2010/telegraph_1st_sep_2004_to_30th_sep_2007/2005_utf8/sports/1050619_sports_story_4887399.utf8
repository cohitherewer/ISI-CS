The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I would again like to say that we are 

 making progress with every race

 Overdrive

 Narain Karthikeyan

 I have to admit my performance 

 in Formula 1 lately hasnt been up to the mark with 

 the races Ive had in Monaco and Europe. My teammate 

 Tiago Montiero was outpacing me and I was having a tough 

 time racing and adapting to the circuits where I had never 

 been before. The car has also not been behaving well, which 

 made handling the car very difficult. Also, luck just hasnt 

 been on my side lately.

 A lot has been said about my progress 

 in the media after the recently concluded Canadian Grand 

 Prix where I failed to finish the race. I feel that all 

 this negative media publicity is giving people the wrong 

 notion about my progress in Formula 1. I would again like 

 to say that we are making progress with every race. In Canada, 

 which was another circuit, where I had never raced before, 

 I was having a decent showing till I hit the Wall 

 of Champions. 

 My tyres were a bit worn out and 

 thats when I made this mistake. I was on a heavier 

 fuel load and despite that I was outpacing the Minardis. 

 I also managed to get my lost place back from my teammate 

 before the first round of pits. 

 Even Rubens Barrichello, who started 

 the race behind me, was having a tough time catching up 

 with me. The reason the Minardi car out-qualified me was 

 because of the lower fuel load and I wont be surprised 

 if they try the same tactic this week. We, however, will 

 stick to our game plan and will remain unfazed by the happenings 

 around us.

 It feels special to be racing 

 at this legendary Indianapolis circuit. It has such a vast 

 history behind it. The track however is straightforward 

 and not very challenging. However, the one testing aspect 

 to this circuit is the top speed. This is the fastest I 

 have ever driven where we managed to reach 346 kmph. Monza 

 will be quicker than this but we will have to wait a bit 

 till then. 

 The middle sector of the race 

 is full of really tight corners and its very important 

 to place your car on the right racing line to get the best 

 time. You have to concentrate on the oval ring and keep 

 the racing line in mind in order to get a fast lap.

 I had a good practice session 

 on Friday and I managed forty-nine laps of the circuit. 

 This will definitely prove useful as we go into this race. 

 Besides this, there wasnt 

 much we did in the past five days since the Canadian Grand 

 Prix. We will be testing our new car next week and if all 

 goes well we will be able to use that in the next race.

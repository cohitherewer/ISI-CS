 I dont think we have the edge, says Jacob Oram

Harare: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly declared everyone in his side to be fit and ruled out major batting reshuffles when they take on New Zealand in the Videocon Cup tri-series encounter here on Friday. 

Everyone is fit and available for selection, said Sourav as he addressed the reporters on Thursday. 

Sourav also ruled out changes in the batting order so as to protect the top four against the new ball on a spongy wicket. 

I dont think we would do it. It is not easy for number five or six to go and play new ball well as it seams around. Similarly, it is not easy for top batters to do well in the middle as rotating the strike is also an art. 

As I see it, we will stick to the same batting order. The guys in the middle are doing well. Somebody has to bear the brunt with the ball snaking around in the first 15 overs, Sourav said. 

We have to see through the early period, it is not going to be a wicket where 100 runs in first 15 overs are possible or a score of 300 could be made. 

If we can bowl the way we have done and play (Shane) Bond a bit better, we are in with a chance. 

On Sachins withdrawal from the Test series against Zimbabwe, Sourav said, It is a right decision if he is not fit. He knows his injury the best. There is no doubt we will miss him but we want him for the bigger games. 

There are series against Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa and England ahead and it is good that he is taking a complete break and returning completely healed. 

Gangulys mind also wandered to the ashes series and he predicted australia to come back strongly in the final test in oval, starting on sep 8. 

Australia are a tough side and can come back in the final test if mcgrath is fit. 

It is the best cricket i have watched since australia played in india in 2001 or when we toured down under in 2003. 

Ganguly also supported matthew hayden and backed the left-hander to come good in the final test. He is a class act and has 20 hundreds from 70 tests. He is a bit under weather but it happens to everyone. I back him to come good soon. 

Ganguly said one of the reason for australia not doing well was because adam gilchrist was not shining in his customary fashion. (michael) vaughan is lucky that gilchrist has not shone with the bat. We were also similarly lucky in 2003-04 when gilchrist couldnt get going. Pti cor kk 09012043 del 

Team India coach Greg Chappell believes the batsmen would recover their poise and that they are getting better accustomed to the pace and bounce of the tracks. 

They are getting better after half a dozen practice sessions we have had till now. They are getting more and more used to the extra bounce. If hard work counts for anything, we should get better, he said. 

Meanwhile, New Zealand allrounder Jacob Oram doesnt feel his side is superior to India ahead of the crucial encounter. 

I dont think we have the edge. When I look at India, there is so much of talent and experience in their ranks. We wont be reading too much into what happened in Bulawayo and I am sure the Indians wont be reading too much into it either, said Oram. 

Oram believes the likes of Sourav and Sehwag cannot be kept quiet for too long. 

Sourav, Dravid and Sehwag are not the types who will be in a slump for long. They are a very good side, just look at the individuals and see how much talent they have.

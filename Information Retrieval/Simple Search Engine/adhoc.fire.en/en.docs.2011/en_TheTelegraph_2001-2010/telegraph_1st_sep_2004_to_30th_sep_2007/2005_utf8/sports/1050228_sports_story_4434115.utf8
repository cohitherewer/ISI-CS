 Crucial test for Bob Woolmer

Karachi: Pakistan need some quick results and coach Bob Woolmer is well aware of the fact. There?s growing calls for his head after a disastrous showing Down Under and the coach knows only too well that victory alone can silence them as the team gets ready for it?s first full-fledged tour of India in six years, beginning Monday. 

Woolmer, however, was stoic ahead of the 50-day tour where Pakistan play three Tests and six one-day Internationals. 

?For me, the importance of this series is to keep improving and hopefully get the right results. My growth as a coach will not depend on the results. But my growth as coach is also about finding ways to make players do better,? the 56-year-old said. 

Woolmer believed that despite the home advantage, Pakistan would start the series on equal footing. 

Woolmer, who replaced Javed Miandad in June last year, is yet to guide Pakistan to a series win, which has encouraged his detractors. 

He would do very well to remember that Miandad lost his two-year contract halfway through after India beat them 2-1 in Tests and 3-2 in one-dayers at home last year. 

Woolmer did not go into the game plan to contain the strong Indian batting line-up but defended England?s Ashley Giles tactics of bowling on the leg stump to Sachin Tendulkar in 2002. 

?I think there are times when one has to go on the defensive. You can?t always attack. 

?I think the Pakistan team is now on the way up. of course, it?s a personal opinion, but the (present) Indian team is a very good side.? 

Meanwhile, captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who will be playing in his 100th Test in the upcoming series, has asked his players to shed the negative mindset and firmly believe they can win in India. 

?I am thinking positively. I have not allowed anything negative to pollute my mind and that?s what I have been telling my boys,? said the Pakistan skipper. 

?The key to success on the Indian tour will be positive approach.? (PTI)

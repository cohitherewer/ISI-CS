 Sharapova warms up with Edgbaston title

Birmingham: Maria Sharapova warmed up for the defence of her Wimbledon crown by defeating Jelena Jankovic 6-2, 4-6, 6-1 in the final of the Edgbaston International grass court tournament on Sunday. 

The Russian was pushed to three sets for the third time this week but came through in a little under two hours to take the title for the second year running. 

The top seed suffered a blip midway through the second set, before moving through the gears to down the 20-year-old Serb. It was the 18-year-old Sharapovas 17th consecutive victory on grass and her 10th career title.

Irvine (US): Michael Phelps won three individual events and anchored the US to an easy victory in the 400m medley relay at the duel in the pool meet with Australia. 

The Americans won 18 races to 10 for the Aussies on Tuesday. Overall, the US outscored Australia 183-102, repeating their victory from 2003. 

Exhaustion was a factor for both teams after the recent eight-day Fina World Championships in Montreal. The teams arrived from Canada on Monday. 

Aussie Grant Hackett won the 400 freestyle in 3:45.31, but he was upset in the 200 free by American Peter Vanderkaay. 

My body felt extremely tired, Hackett said. Ive got five or six gears in me, but I was crunching to get into second without a clutch. It was a tough day. 

Hackett won three individual gold medals last week in Montreal and broke countryman Ian Thorpes world record in the 800 free. 

Phelps won the 200 and 400 individual medleys and the 200 butterfly on Tuesday. 

He was one of four world record-holders on the victorious 400 medley relay, joining hometown favourite Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen and Ian Crocker. 

They finished in 3:36.39 seconds ? beating the Aussies by more than six seconds. 

Phelps hasnt lost a 400 IM since the 2001 US Spring Nationals, a streak of eight races. 

Peirsol was another multiple winner, sweeping the 100 and 200 backstrokes. 

Afterward, he and Aussie Michael Klim swapped team jerseys. 

Couldnt have asked for a better meet as far as the competition goes, Peirsol said. Those are some great fans sitting out there, a lot of kids and thats kind of who were trying to reach with this. 

Katie Hoff, the 16-year-old who emerged as a future star at last weeks World Championships, swept the 200 and 400 IMs. 

She won the 400 IM by 4.5 seconds, besting her time in Montreal. 

Aussie Leisel Jones and American Jessica Hardy renewed their budding rivalry in the 100 breaststroke that began last week. 

Jones won in 1:06.21 ? the second-fastest time and just one-hundredth of a second off Hardys week-old world record. 

Jones would have claimed $25,000 if she had broken the mark. 

Leisel is always fun and you have to go fast to race her, said Hardy, who trains in Irvine. It hurt more than it did in Montreal. 

Hansen swept the 100 and 200 breaststrokes. 

Other double winners for the Aussies were ? Jess Schipper: 100-200 butterfly; Jones: 100-200 breaststroke; Libby Lenton: 100-200 free. 

Their strong performances helped the Aussies outscore the American women, 76-70.

 Buchanan calls for review

 - ASHES DEBACLE 

 Like Ponting, Buchanan wants to continue 

Sydney: John Buchanan has called for a full review of Australias Ashes defeat after captain Ricky Ponting admitted his team had lost their ruthless edge. 

Buchanan, whose own position is under threat following the 1-2 series loss to England, said it was obvious changes were needed and no one should be exempt from the review. 

Everything has to be reviewed. Theres no doubt about that, he told newsmen at the Brisbane airport on Thursday. Success or non-success, youre always trying to work out how you can improve things. 

Buchanan said he hoped to remain in charge despite growing calls for his sacking. 

Im keen to continue but Im part of the mix as well, so its not really up to me to venture into that debate, he said. So my position should not be exempt from that, just the same as everybody else in Cricket Australia. 

Thats all part of the territory, if you win, as we see with England, (there are) lots of tumultuous celebrations and accolades, and if you lose everyone looks for reasons why. 

Pontings leadership has also come under fire with former test bowler Dennis Lillee urging selectors to give the captaincy to Shane Warne. 

Like Buchanan, Ponting also said he wants to stay in the job and has urged the selectors not to make wholesale changes because of a defeat in one series. 

Ponting said Australias preparation for the series had been perfect but the team failed to grasp its opportunities. 

Looking back, I think the ruthless edge was missing, Ponting said. 

I think the ruthless edge comes from those really tough, big, defining moments in Tests and unfortunately we didnt stand up this time. Usually this team lifts when the big occasions are there. We didnt do that this time. (Reuters)

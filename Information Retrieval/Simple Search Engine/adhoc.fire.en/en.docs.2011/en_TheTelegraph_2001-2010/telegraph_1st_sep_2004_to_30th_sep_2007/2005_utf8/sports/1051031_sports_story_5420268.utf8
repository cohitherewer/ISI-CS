 Blast victims on Indians mind

 - Were going to do our best, says Dravid 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur: Team India will be sparing more than a thought for the families of those who lost near and dear ones in Saturdays blasts in New Delhi when the third ODI, against Sri Lanka, gets underway on Monday. 

Were aware of our responsibilities and are going to do our best for the people who have suffered... Our condolences are with the affected families, observed captain Rahul Dravid. 

While expressing grief, Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu maintained his team was satisfied with the security arrangements and that nobody was worried. In any case, those in the Emerald Isle arent unused to blasts. 

Manager Michael Tissera said as much: Were extremely sorry about what happened.... Weve gone through this for years and know how hard it is. 

The blasts occurred soon after both teams had landed from Chandigarh for an overnight stay. 

Till late on Sunday, The Telegraphs sources couldnt confirm whether a minutes silence would be observed before the first ball and/or the teams would wear black armbands as a mark of respect for the victims. 

As expected, after a post-blasts review, security has been stepped up across Jaipur.

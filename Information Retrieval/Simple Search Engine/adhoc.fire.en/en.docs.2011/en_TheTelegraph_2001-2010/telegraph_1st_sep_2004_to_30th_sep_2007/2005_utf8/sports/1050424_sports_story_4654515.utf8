 ?Sourav is No.1 captain in world?

 Harbhajan feels Sourav needs encouragement 

Jalandhar: Harbhajan Singh Saturday called for complete support to beleaguered cricket skipper Sourav Ganguly, who according to the star spinner, was an ?outstanding? leader and the ?number one? captain in the world. 

He said that it was unfortunate that Sourav had come in for criticism at a time when he should be encouraged. 

?He is an outstanding captain. Going by the match-winning record in the last four years, Sourav has emerged as the most successful captain of the Indian team,? Harbhajan said. 

?At this crucial juncture, people should encourage him for coming back into form instead of indulging in leg-pulling,? he said. 

The off-spinner was also effusive in his praise for John Wright who stepped down as India?s coach immediately after the series vs Pakistan. 

?As far as I am concerned, I consider John as the number one coach in the world. Under his guidance, the Indian team has improved a lot. But unfortunately the team could not give him a win in the last match of his tenure,? he said referring to the Delhi one-dayer which Pakistan won convincingly to take the six-match series 4-2. 

?Wright is not only a good coach, but also a great human being. He had put his best efforts to improve the game of every individual player,? he said. 

Harbhajan said he hoped that the next coach would also match the qualities of Wright. 

Asked whether the players faced any problem in communicating with the New Zealader when he was the coach, Harbhajan replied in the negative. ?Wright was very clear about his instructions and his hard work brought strict discipline in the team.? 

Harbhajan admitted he felt disturbed after his bowling action came under the scanner for the second time during the recent Test series against Pakistan. ?It also affected my performance,? he said. 

?I do not know through which parameter the ICC umpires judged the degree of my elbow flexion, which can be possible only by at least 12 close circuit cameras,? he said.

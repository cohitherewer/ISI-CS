The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav sticks to travel plans

 - ARBITRATION ISSUE - No word yet from Justice Sachs, who is in the UK 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: In the absence of any communication either from the International Cricket Council (ICC) or the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Sourav Ganguly is sticking to his travel plans for the final camp in Bangalore. 

The regular Team India captains six-ODI ban has been referred to Justice Albie Sachs for arbitration. However, no time frame has been announced. 

In fact, ICC general manager and spokesman Brendan McClements couldnt confirm whether the case papers had indeed been despatched to South Africas Constitutional Court judge. 

Justice Sachs is also on the ICC Code of Conduct Commission. 

The blasts (in London) disrupted work in the last couple of days and, so, I cant confirm Justice Sachs has received the case papers? He alone will decide on the necessity or otherwise of a personal hearing, McClements said on Saturday evening. 

Significantly, Justice Sachs (who survived an assassination attempt by the old White regime while in exile in Mozambique, 17 years ago) is currently giving lectures in the UK and may not return to Johannesburg before the month-end. 

So, if a personal hearing does take place, it could be in London ? not in South Africas commercial capital, as speculated in sections of the Media. 

The official word is awaited. 

As for Sourav, he told The Telegraph from Nottingham: Im not altering my travel arrangements as I havent heard from the BCCI or the ICC? I leave London on Tuesday and reach Bangalore via Mumbai in the early hours of Wednesday. 

A change, though, is going to be necessary if Justice Sachs (in the next couple of days) calls for a personal hearing. 

The final (cricket-specific) camp begins on Wednesday itself and attendance is compulsory for all 36 pre-season probables. 

While that camp runs till July 22, Sourav (as of now) will leave after two days as hes contracted with Glamorgan till July 25. 

That Sourav must be present on the first two days, at least, was made clear by coach Greg Chappell when the probables were picked last month. 

Indeed, the camp dates were finalised after scanning the Welsh Countys fixtures. As the next commitment ? after the ongoing Championship game against Nottinghamshire, that is ? is only on July 17, Sourav wont miss any action during the brief absence. 

Incidentally, he had a quiet 33rd birthday, on Friday. 

I neither cut a cake, nor was I showered with gifts yesterday? We had another tough day? At night, I went for a Chinese meal with some teammates ? thats it, Sourav remarked, as he prepared for Day II at Trent Bridge. 

If Justice Sachs upholds the punishment (imposed by Chris Broad and deemed correct by Michael Beloff), then Sourav wont be eligible for the league stage of the 2005-06 season-launching tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

He has already served one-third of the ban.

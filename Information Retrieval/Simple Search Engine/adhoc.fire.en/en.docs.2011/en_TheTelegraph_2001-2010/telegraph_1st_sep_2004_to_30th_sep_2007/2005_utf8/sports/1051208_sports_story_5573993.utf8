The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Firoz Ali in top spot

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Jamshedpur: Firoz Ali of Calcutta led the field into the final two money making rounds of the Tata Open with a second straight round of four-under at the Golmuri Course. 

With a total of eight-under 134 over 36 holes, Firoz enjoys a clear two-stroke lead. Following at tied-second are three players ? Rahul Ganapathy of Bangalore, S. S. P. Chowrasia from Calcutta and Sanjay Kumar from Lucknow. 

With the Tata Open reaching the halfway stage, the tournament saw 60 professionals and two amateurs making the cut, which was applied at eight-over 150. 

Firoz continued with his streak, though he was playing erratically at the beginning. I think missing out in Calcutta after leading throughout is playing on my mind. Expectations can sometimes really prey on your mind, he felt.

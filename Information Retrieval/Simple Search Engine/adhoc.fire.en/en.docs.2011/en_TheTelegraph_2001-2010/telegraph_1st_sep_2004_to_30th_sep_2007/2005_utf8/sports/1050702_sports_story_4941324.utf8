 Transfer ban on AS Roma

Rome: Italian Serie A side AS Roma have been banned from registering new players for a year by Fifa following the controversial transfer of Philippe Mexes from Auxerre. 

The ban was imposed as a punishment for improper conduct in the transfer of the defender from the French club a year ago. 

Mexes arrival in the Italian capital was overshadowed by Auxerres claim that the player had broken his contract without their permission and that Roma had encouraged him to do so. 

A ban has been imposed on AS Roma from registering any new player, either nationally or internationally, until the expiry of the second transfer period following the notification of this decision, Fifa said in a statement on Friday. 

 Roma will only be able to register new players as of the transfer period in the summer of 2006. 

Fifas decision comes as a massive blow to the 2001 Serie A champions.

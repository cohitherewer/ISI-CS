 Harikrishna wins, keeps title in sight

Taiyuan (China): World junior champion P. Harikrishna continued to be in title contention with a crucial win over Bu Xiangzhi of China (reported in Tuesdays Late City edition) in the ninth round of the second Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters chess tournament here. 

With his seventh win in nine games, Harikrishna retained his slender half-point lead over Alexander Motylev of Russia who had a smooth sailing over Grandmaster Tigran Petrosian of Armenia. 

It is now down to a race between Harikrishna and the former Russian champion in the remaining two rounds of this category-15 round-robin tournament. 

Despite the loss to the Indian GM, Bu Xiangzhi remained in sole third spot with 5.5 points as his nearest contenders fell apart. 

Wang Yue of China was joint fourth along with Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine and Ni Hua of China with five points each in their kitty. 

Having lost his eighth round game to Motylev it was imperative for Harikrishna to come back in full swing and he did precisely that. 

Xiangzhi, once the youngest GM in the world, was no match for the Indian stalwart, playing white, as he fell easily in just 36 moves after the complexities took centrestage in the closed Sicilian opening. 

Motylev accounted for the out-of-form Tigran Petrosian of Armenia who had a fantastic start in the event. By winning with black, Motylev made sure that the difference between him and Harikrishna did not go out of reach.

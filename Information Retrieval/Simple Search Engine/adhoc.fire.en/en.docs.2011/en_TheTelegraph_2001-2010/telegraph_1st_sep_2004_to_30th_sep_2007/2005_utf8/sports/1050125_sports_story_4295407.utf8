 Agassi ready for favourite Federer

 - ?Roger?s earned the respect... I want him to prove it to me again? 

 Roger Federer and Andre Agassi 

Melbourne: Ageless tennis wonder Andre Agassi has a ready-made reply to those playing down his chances against overwhelming Australian Open favourite Roger Federer in Tuesday?s blockbuster quarter final. 

The Las Vegas hustler is coming up against world No. 1 Federer, on a 25-match unbeaten roll, and the loser of his last four encounters with the Swiss maestro. 

Agassi, who?s seen it all in men?s tennis, says: ?He?s been playing the best tennis in the world for a while now. I mean, somebody has to beat him sooner or later, right? I hope it?s Tuesday night.? 

Such is the peerless stature of 23-year-old Federer?s game that he is considered the one to beat in every Grand Slam, and 34-year-old Agassi is relishing the prospect of testing himself. 

?I?m excited. I mean, this is what I prepare for, to play the best in the biggest of situations. It?s why I do this. 

?Roger offers me the opportunity to push myself more than I?ve been pushed in a long time. That?s a great feeling.? 

Agassi is in the tennis pantheon. The winner of eight Grand Slams and only one of five men to have won all the Grand Slams on all surfaces and a four-time winner of the Australian Open inside 10 years. 

In his 20th year on the ATP men?s tour, Agassi has for some years been written off as a spent force, yet he looked like his old self in overcoming Swede Joachim Johansson?s 51 aces and and 96 winners to conjure a four-set win through sheer experience and cunning in the fourth round Sunday. 

No doubt Agassi faces a supreme test, but he?s relishing the opportunity to test himself against the contemporary best player in men?s tennis. 

?I mean, it?s what makes sports so great. You can?t phone in the result. You got to show up and you got to tee ?em up and you got to find a way to get it done over and over again. Roger?s earned the respect he deserves. I want him to prove it to me again. 

Federer is supremely confident in his abilities and rightly so. Agassi, he says, has to rise to his lofty standards in the eagerly-awaited showdown between two of the biggest names in men?s tennis. 

Federer won the last of his three Grand Slams last year in five sets against Agassi in the US Open final and was a little indignant when asked by a reporter whether he was playing at a level to beat Agassi here. 

?I don?t know why you ask me a question like this. I think I?ve proven myself in the past, and I know my game?s good enough,? Federer bristled. 

 ?Also on my day where I?m not playing perfect, I know 

 I can beat him. He?s not as good as he was when he was at 

 the top of the ranking, otherwise he would be there. Fortunately, 

 I?m there... He has to raise his game, not me.? (AFP)

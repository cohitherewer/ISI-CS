 JCT edge East Bengal out of Durand Cup

 - Parveen, Rennedy complete misery for Calcutta giants 

 Rennedy scored the winner in 63rd minute 

New Delhi: East Bengals poor run in the season continued with their exit from the Durand Cup Football Tournament after they lost 1-2 to JCT Mills, Phagwara, here on Tuesday. 

Rennedy Singhs stunning strike from outside the penalty box in the 63rd minute, which the midfielder later termed as one of the best goals of my career, ended East Bengals run in the tournament. 

JCT would now take on Army XI in the semi-finals on Thursday. 

They started on the offensive from the start and Sukhjinder Singh shot over the bar barely seconds after the play started. East Bengal started to settle down gradually but JCT men were quick in the tackle and getting most of the loose balls. 

In the 20th minute, East Bengals Sydney Nkalanga got behind the JCT defence but failed to control the through pass. Three minutes later, their Nigerian striker Mike Okoro made a good run in the rival territory failed to score. 

For the JCT team, Parveen Kumar, who got a hattrick against Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club (HASC) in the previous match, was proving to be a thorn in East Bengals side. 

He drew the first blood in the 33rd minute when he latched on to a pass from Rennedy, who had drawn East Bengal defender Habib-ur-Rahman towards him, controlled the ball before slotting it past custodian Naseem Akhtar. 

Rennedy continued to rule the midfield and passed to Brazilian teammate Marcos Pereira who had got behind the defence. 

But Akhtar came out to narrow the angle and as a result, Pereira shot wide. 

The red and gold brigade outfit brought on R.C. Prakash??who scored against HASC??in the second half and the team showed more purpose in the match, realising that they needed to win as JCT were better placed on goal difference. 

Bernard Pires and S. Malsawmtluanga had chances to equalise in the 55th minute but failed to capitalise. 

The goal came two minutes later when Chandan Das threw their Congolese striker Liswa Nduti who chested the ball for Sydney to find the net past JCT goalie Karanjit Singh. 

The goal rejuvenated the red and gold brigade who went on the offensive with Okoro and Sydney putting the mill men under some pressure. 

But it was Rennedys strike in the 63rd minute, which sealed the fate in favour of JCT. His shot from way out of the penalty box swerved in the air and totally deceived Naseem Akhtar, finding the top right hand corner of the net. 

The pressure was building on the red and gold brigade as Rennedy got a loose ball but his shot was saved by the East Bengal goalie. 

East Bengal looked despondent and JCT could have got a third when substitute Sunil Chhetri passed to Parveen but the goalkeeper narrowed the angle. 

In the first semi-final on Wednesday, Assam Rifles, who shocked Federation Cup champions Mahindra United earlier in the tournament, would take on Sporting- Clube-de-Goa.

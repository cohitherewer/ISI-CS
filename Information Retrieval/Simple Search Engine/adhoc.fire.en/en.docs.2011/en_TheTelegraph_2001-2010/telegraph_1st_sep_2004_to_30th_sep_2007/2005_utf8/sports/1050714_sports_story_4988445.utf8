 Real loan out Fernandez

Madrid: Real Madrid have loaned Borja Fernandez to Real Mallorca for a season and extended the contracts of former youth team players Alvaro Arbeloa, Ruben de la Red and Diego Lopez. 

Borja will not be allowed to play against his former club during his stint with the islanders. 

Real players on loan have frequently produced match-winning performances against them and they have therefore decided to put a restrictive clause in deals they strike with other clubs. 

Mallorca looked destined for the drop but rallied to finish two points above the relegation zone. (Reuters)

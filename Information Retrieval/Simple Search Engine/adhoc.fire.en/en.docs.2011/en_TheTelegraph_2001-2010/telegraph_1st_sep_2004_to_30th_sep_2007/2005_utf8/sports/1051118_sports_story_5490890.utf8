 Mukesh hits par 72

Hanoi: Windy condition on a tough golf course took its toll as Mukesh Kumar alone came back with a par round of 72 among the ten Indians in the opening round of the Carlsberg Masters 2005. 

Mukesh, who was two-under after 15, double bogeyed the 16th and slipped from top five towards the end of his round. 

The leader was Malaysias Danny Chia who enjoyed a fiery run as he carried the first round with a six-under-par 66 on Thursday. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hattrick beckons Anand

 - WIJK AAN ZEE Meet 

 Anand could be five-time winner 

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): This edition of the Corus chess tournament will see GM Viswanathan Anand going for his third title on the trot and fifth overall in a tough field that boasts players with a formidable average elo rating of 2721. 

The draw of lots to determine the first round pairings in this category-19 meet will be done later. 

However, the pairings of group C, featuring upcoming players, have been made available and Indian hope Parimarjan Negi will be playing GM Evgeny Alekseev of Russia in the first round. 

Negi is the only Indian, besides Anand, P. Harikrishna and Koneru Humpy to have been invited for this event. While Anand has been a regular in Corus, both Harikrishna and Humpy have played in group B in the past. 

The following are sketches of some of the top group A participants: 

 Anand (world ranking 

 2): The Indian ace is on a roll. Winning one tournament 

 after another, he has already made many believe that he 

 is in effect the top player in the world today. For Anand, 

 there is one ambition that remains to be achieved ? the 

 2800 elo rating. Right now he is adrift of the magical figure 

 by 14 points. It will not be easy for him to gain all those 

 here, but most certainly that is what he will try to achieve. 

 Veselin Topalov (world 

 ranking 3): The Bulgarian was extremely ominous in the 

 last world chess championship in Tripoli where he started 

 off with 9.5/10 before being ousted by eventual winner Rustam 

 Kasimdzha-nov of Uzbekistan. 

The performance in Tripoli also saw a spurt in his rating as he threw Vladimir Kramnik off the number 3 spot. In the last edition of the event Topalov was the only one who had beaten Anand. 

 Kramnik (world ranking 

 4): Kramnik regained lost pride after a nail-biting 

 victory over Hungarian Peter Leko in the classical world 

 championship match in Switzerland a few months ago. Yet, 

 the Russian has lost most of his followers mainly because 

 of his dry style these days. Importantly, he is the only 

 player in last 20 years who has beaten Garri Kasparov in 

 a match. 

 Leko (world ranking 

 5): The highest rated Hungarian sta-lwart is a cool 

 customer. He nearly defeated Kramnik in the classical match 

 and after the last game disaster many had thought that Leko 

 will now be shattered. 

 Alexander Morozevich 

 (world ranking 6): He is the most unpredictable player 

 in the top ten today. Morozevich had a an average result 

 in the last Russian championship won by Kasparov and also 

 in the last chess Olympiad where the Russian supremacy was 

 grounded by Ukraine. 

However, it is known that every time ?Moro? is down, he hits back more vehemently. This could be one platform where it might just happen. 

 Michael Adams (world 

 ranking 7): Cool as a cucumber and hard as a rock, Michael 

 Adams is the best English player these days. 

 Peter Svidler (world 

 ranking 8): From number four in the world in 2004, to 

 number 8 in 2005, it has been a steep fall that Svidler 

 would like to forget. The Russian champion of 2003 was moving 

 in top gear when suddenly a few below average performances 

 hit him badly. 

 Judit Polgar (world 

 ranking 9): Quite interestingly, Judit was removed from 

 the latest world ranking as she had not played any event 

 for more than a year now. 

The best woman chess player ever in the history of the game, became a mother in August 2004 and is now ready to resume action on the battlefield. 

 Alexander Grischuk (world 

 ranking 13): A consistent performer with a lively playing 

 style. 

 Ruslan Ponomariov (wor-ld 

 ranking 16): Ponomariov won the World Championship in 

 Moscow in 2002 defeating fellow Ukrainian Vassily Ivan-chuk 

 in the final. He was one of the star performers for his 

 country in the Olympiad. 

 Nigel Short (world ranking 

 29): The Commonwealth Champion, known for his lashings 

 against ?dry players?, is entertainment on and off the board.

 Sporting Lisbon, CSKA in title-clash

London: Sporting Lisbon will enjoy the advantage of meeting CSKA Moscow in their own Jose Alvalade Stadium in the final of the Uefa Cup on May 18. 

Sporting reached their first European final since 1964 after a dramatic goal from defender Miguel Garcia two minutes into stoppage time of extra-time sank AZ Alkmaar in The Netherlands on Thursday. 

Dutch side Alkmaar won the semi-final second leg 3-2 but their Portuguese opponents went through to the Lisbon final on the away-goals rule after the 4-4 aggregate. 

CSKA became only the second Russian team, and the first for 33 years, to reach the final of a major European competition as they crushed under-strength Parma. 

After a goalless first leg in Italy a week ago, CSKA struck three times at the Lokomotiv Stadium in Moscow to win 3-0 on aggregate. 

In Alkmaar, Garcias header from a right-wing corner put Sporting through at AZs tiny but atmospheric Alkmaarderhout ground. Kew Jaliens had volleyed AZ 3-1 ahead four minutes into the second extra period. 

A bullet header from Kenneth Perez put the hosts 1-0 up after six minutes of the second leg. But Sporting, who beat Hungarys MTK Budapest in the 1964 European Cup Winners Cup final replay, equalised through Brazilian striker Liedson on the stroke of halftime. 

Substitute Stein Huysegems breathed new life into AZ and the front man made it 2-1 with 11 minutes left. 

In Moscow, Brazilian striker Daniel Carvalho scored for army club CSKA in the 10th and 53rd minutes before setting up defender Vasily Berezutsky for the third goal on the hour. (Reuters)

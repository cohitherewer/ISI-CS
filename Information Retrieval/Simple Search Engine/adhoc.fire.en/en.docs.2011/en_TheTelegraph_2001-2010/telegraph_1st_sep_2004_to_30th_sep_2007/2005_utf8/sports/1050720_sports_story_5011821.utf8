 Michelle Wie back on womens trophy trail

Evian (France): Teenage prodigy Michelle Wie is resetting her sights on the womens game this week, five days after narrowly missing out on her lifelong dream to qualify for the US Masters. 

Bidding to become the first female to play in a mens major, the 15-year-old schoolgirl from Hawaii made it to the last eight of last weeks US Amateur Public Links tournament before losing in matchplay format to the eventual winner. 

Wie was hoping to win the event, thereby earning an invite for next years Masters. 

I was disappointed with the result but pleased with how I played, Wie told reporters after arriving here for the womens $2.5 million Evian Masters. Hopefully Ill have more chances in the future. 

Few who have seen Wie in action would challenge that belief. 

The six-foot (1.83-metre) Wie is already out-hitting most of her women rivals, and many of the men, with regular drives of 300-yards plus. 

In January 2004 she became only the fourth female, and the youngest overall, to play an event on the mens PGA Tour, missing the cut by one stroke. 

In her second crack at the mens circuit, in this months John Deere Classic, Wie missed the cut by two shots. 

The American looks set to become the first female to make a mens cut and maybe even become a regular on the mens tour. 

Obviously Id love for that to happen one day, Wie said. I learn so much from the men and its really fun. 

Theyre awesome players and awesome people so I really love being with them. I cant really explain it beyond that, its just something Ive always wanted to do. (Reuters)

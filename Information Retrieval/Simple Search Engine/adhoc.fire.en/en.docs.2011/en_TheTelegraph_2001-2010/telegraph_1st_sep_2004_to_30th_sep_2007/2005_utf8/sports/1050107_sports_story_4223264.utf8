 Bashar falls six short

Chittagong: Captain Habibul Bashar fell six runs short of his fourth Test century shortly before stumps as Bangladesh reached 280 for four on the opening day of the first Test against Zimbabwe on Thursday. 

Rajin Saleh was 60 not out and opener Nafis Iqbal made 56, the hosts moving into a comfortable position in their quest for their first Test victory in their 35th match. 

Zimbabwe are playing their first Test since they were suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) last June for fielding a weakened team after a dispute between their board and several leading white players. 

Bashar, who won the toss and elected to bat, scored at an impressive rate against the Zimbabwe attack, making his 94 off 128 balls before he was caught by Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu to give debutant Christopher Mpofu his first Test wicket. 

Saleh, who was dropped by Graeme Cremer on 41, equalled his Test best score of 60 while combining in a 119-run fourth-wicket partnership with Bashar. Aftab Ahmed was six not out at the close.

Mohali: Irfan Pathan produced a devastating spell of seam bowling as an inspired India ruthlessly beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the second one-dayer here Friday. 

The young Pathan captured four early wickets to help skittle out the visitors for a paltry 122 in 35.4 overs before Sachin Tendulkar (70 not out) took centrestage with a magnificent display of strokeplay to quickly overhaul the target with 29.4 overs to spare and give the hosts a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series. 

It was a stunning performance by the Indians who thoroughly outplayed the Lankans in all departments of the game, rendering the floodlit encounter at the PCA Stadium a totally lop-sided affair. 

The visitors, who suffered a comprehensive 152-run defeat in the first match in Nagpur, were left clueless as Pathan wrecked the top-order in eight consecutive overs to put India firmly in the saddle from the very first over of the contest. 

The Baroda speedster returned with impressive figures of 8-0-37-4 as he ripped apart the top-order to leave the islanders with the dubious distinction of being bundled out for the lowest-ever total at the ground. 

The previous lowest was made by South Africa who had scored 178 for nine against India in 1993. 

Kumar Sangakkara was the top scorer for the Lankans with 27 but none of the other batsmen could hang around for long in what turned out to be an abject batting surrender on a good track. 

Sachin, appearing in his 350th one-day match, again gave glimpses of his vintage form with an array of breath-taking shots in all parts of the ground much to the delight of a capacity crowd who had plenty to cheer right through the day. 

Chasing a modest target of 123 for a win, Sachin and Virender Sehwag launched the run chase on a rollicking note as the two batsmen attacked the bowlers from the word go. 

Even the wily Muttiah Muralidharan was not spared as Sachin repeatedly stepped out to clobber the off-spinner with utter disdain. 

Sehwag also looked in ominous form with a barrage of boundaries and picked up pacer Nuwan Zoysa for special treatment, blasting him for 14 runs in one over. He finally fell to Maharoof for 38.

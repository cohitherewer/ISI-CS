 Vaughan hopeful of win at Trent Bridge

 - We had better start getting things happening pretty quickly: Ponting 

 Michael Vaughan has dismissed talks of Australian gains from the Old Trafford Test 

London: England captain Michael Vaughan on Friday dismissed suggestions that Australia have gained a psychological advantage having staved off defeat at Old Trafford. 

Only a tenth-wicket stand lasting four overs between Australias Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath kept the series at 1-1 in Manchester on Monday. 

Weve been talking about psychological advantages and disadvantages throughout the whole summer, Vaughan said. We will arrive at Trent Bridge next week fully focused and hoping to go 2-1 up. 

What we do know is we can take a lot out of this last game because we dominated four days of Test cricket against the No. 1 team in the world. 

To get where we have, the team has bounced back and shown a lot of character since Lords; it can be hard to produce two performances on the trot of such high intensity and high-pressure cricket but we have. 

Vaughan added: I really do hope the two final games are as good as the last two games we have had because the series deserves that. 

Both teams have played in a real good spirit, respect each other very much and there is a lot of talent on show. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting admitted that his team had to improve in the next Test at Nottingham on August 25. 

Since inheriting the Test captaincy from Steve Waugh 18 months ago, Ponting has not faced anything like the extended challenge presented in the past fortnight, his only loss in 13 matches prior to this tour. 

There are only two Test matches to go, so we had better start getting things happening pretty quickly, Ponting said. 

I dont think there will be any personnel changes as far as the batting goes because all the guys are in good form and we have just made errors of judgement at times. 

There havent been any real extravagant bad shots which have led to our downfalls? we have just made little mental errors. 

We have had two really good wickets to bat on in the last two games and we have only just managed to get to 300 in our first innings both times. 

That is not good enough from our line-up, we should be making more runs than that and if we do we would take a lot of pressure off the bowlers in the second innings.

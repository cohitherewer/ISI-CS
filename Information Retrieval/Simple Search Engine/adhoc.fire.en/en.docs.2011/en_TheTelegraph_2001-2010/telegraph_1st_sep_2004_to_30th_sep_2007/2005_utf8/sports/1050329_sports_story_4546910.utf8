St John?s: South Africa coach Ray Jennings is confident his team will be ready to face the West Indies in the first Test starting in Georgetown Thursday. 

?We will be ready for Guyana,? Jennings said after the team?s first full workout in Antigua on Sunday. 

?We have been here for two and a half days and I?m happy to see the right attitude from the players. The session was good. It was the starting point to get the show on the road. The commitment was there. The whole side came through well. They all seemed eager and energetic.? 

Meanwhile, the West Indies decided not to replace fast bowler Jerome Taylor, a 20-year-old Jamaican who was sidelined with a back injury last week. 

The team will travel to Guyana with only 13 players who are training in Barbados, manager Tony Howard said. (AP)

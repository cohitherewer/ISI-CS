 Threat to Delhi ODI

New Delhi: The Delhi unit of Shiv Sena threatened on Sunday not to allow the sixth Indo-Pak ODI slated to be held in the capital next month. 

?The Indo-Pak match in Delhi will not be allowed to take place at any cost,? Delhi unit chief Jai Bhagwan Goel was quoted as saying, according to a Shiv Sena release. 

?While Pakistan is sending terrorists belonging to outfits like the Lashker-e-Toiba with the aim of destabilising out country, government of India has invited the Pakistani cricket team here and holding matches, which is an example of our government?s twisted thinking,? he said. 

Meanwhile, 750 Pakistan fans crossed over to India through the Wagah border Sunday to witness the first Test beginning in Mohali on Tuesday. 

This was after Pakistan cancelled the Samjhauta Express due to tecnical reasons.

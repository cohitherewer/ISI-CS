 McGrath fit to play 

 - Unfair to blame me if we lose: Ponting

London: Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath is fit to play in the fifth and final Ashes Test against England, starting on Thursday, Cricket Australia said on Wednesday. 

Captain Ricky Ponting told a news conference: Glenn was asked to bowl two spells yesterday (Tuesday) and got through those really well. 

He almost plays as two bowlers in our team. Hes probably our main strike bowler up front with the new ball and at the same time you can call on him to bowl some tight overs later. Hes a vital player. 

England lead the series 2-1 but Australia will retain the Ashes, which they have held since 1989, if they can win at The Oval. 

McGrath, Man of the Match when Australia won the opening Test, missed the second Test with injured ankle ligaments. He also missed the fourth with a sore elbow, a problem which has continued to dog him. 

McGrath underwent a final fitness test on Wednesday, after which team physiotherapist Errol Alcott said the paceman had exceeded expectations. He is set to replace Michael Kasprowicz for the match. 

Meanwhile, Ponting said he should not be made into a scapegoat if his side loses the Ashes. 

Ponting was asked by reporters whether he feared for his job if the world champions failed to retain the Ashes by winning The Oval Test. 

I would hate to think if we lost this series it is only my fault, all coming back to me, Ponting said. I have never been one who has sat back and taken all the accolades when the team has gone well. I think it would be unfair if it was my fault we lose this Ashes series. 

Around the team I would have thought I have done most things right along the way. Maybe I havent scored as many runs as I would have liked but at different times I think I have batted quite well. 

The plans have all been there but whether it is my fault we havent been able to execute them, I am not sure. At the end of the day, it is all of us. We are all responsible for the way we have played. 

England captain Michael Vaughan, on the other hand, avoided any flights of Churchillian oratory and refrained from invoking the spirit of Agincourt on the eve of the match. We will just do as we have done in the last few games, he told a news conference on Wednesday. I dont see any reason why we should change our approach. 

Vaughan has also rejected suggestions that England could be accused of defensive tactics if they opted to play an extra batsman rather than a bowler at The Oval.

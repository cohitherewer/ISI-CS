New Delhi: Crickets governing bodies in Asia and Africa have formally come together under the Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation banner. 

And, pretty expectedly, this joint venture intends organising a three-match limited overs series between Asia and Africa each year. Not surprisingly, too, the International Cricket Council is going to be moved for official status. 

Thats our plan... When the best will be on view, the status should appropriate, Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief executive Ashraful Huq told The Telegraph, when contacted in Kuala Lumpur. 

Asia and Africa are to host the series alternately with the host continent getting 70 per cent of the profit. The other is going to get 20, with the balance earmarked for a charity in the host continent. 

So, its not only about making millions. 

ACC president Jagmohan Dalmiya will chair the joint venture for three years, with the African Cricket Association boss Peter Chingoka serving as the vice-chairman.

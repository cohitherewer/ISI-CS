The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dokic likely to take part

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Jelena Dokic is likely to be the biggest attraction at next month?s $140,000 Hyderabad Open. 

Once a teenaged prodigy who rose to world No. 4 in 2002, the former Wimbledon finalist lost her way and dropped in the rankings. Her infamous clash with dad Damir din?t help her career either. 

Last year was particularly miserable as an elbow injury, preceded by a string of first-round losses, forced Dokic to skip several tournaments in the last three months. 

The 21-year-old Serbian, now out of the top-100, will have to make a new beginning as she tries together career back on track. ?She?s confirmed? but for an injury, Dokic will be playing in Hyderabad,? Mahesh Bhupathi informed. ?I hope to convince another big name for Hyderabad at the Australian Open next fortnight.? 

Bhupathi?s company Globosport brought the WTA Tour to India (Hyderabad) two years ago. Mary Pierce has been the biggest star to have featured in the meet. 

As for his latest acquisition, the Sunfeast Open in Calcutta from September 19, Bhupathi said it?s too early to talk of the field. ?It will only be around June when players will start thinking of September. My work will start then.?

London: Justine Henin-Hardennes fragile hopes of winning the only Grand Slam missing from her collection were dashed on Tuesday when she lost in the first round at Wimbledon. 

Tim Henman, once again shouldering a nations dreams for a first British mens champion in 69 years, survived. 

But only just. 

The 30-year-olds toothless display left the Centre Court crowd on the edge of its seats before he finally overcame obscure Finn Jarkko Nieminen 3-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2. 

It was ordinary at best, was Henmans candid verdict. I was struggling with my form the whole match, that was the picture really... but youve got to keep fighting. 

Fight with what youve got on the day. I am proud of the way I managed to do that. You can lose this tournament on the first day but you cant win it. 

French Open champion Henin-Hardenne learnt the harsh reality of Henmans maxim the tough way. 

She had no answer to Greek Eleni Daniilidous weight of shot and went down 6-7, 6-2, 5-7. 

Well, its pretty hard, but... that was the worst draw I could get, she said. So Im not gonna be positive today, and I have no excuse. 

I never felt the good rhythm, and I missed some opportunities in the third set. So its very hard to win when you play like this. 

Defending champion Maria Sharapova failed to match the sparkle of her 18-carat gold tennis shoes in the opening of her defence, but still advanced 6-2, 6-2 over claycourter Nuria Llagostera Vives. 

However the scoreline had as much to do with the Spaniards unease on the slick grass as the champions prowess. I can get a lot better from here obviously, she said. 

I did enough to win and so, you know, Im pretty satisfied. The pace of the court here is a lot different (to clay). I think she struggled with that a little bit. 

Still, though, Sharapova could not help but enjoy her match. It was so amazing. I was just smiling, she said. I usually dont smile when I go out on the court. 

The people are clapping. Youre just taking it all in. Youre remembering last year. This is where magic happened, I guess. So it was just really good to feel that again. 

Mens second seed Andy Roddick was far more impressive, thumping Czech Jiri Vanek 6-1, 7-6, 6-2. 

The man with the worlds fastest serve cracked 14 aces past his opponent as he racked up victory in 82 minutes. I felt like it was a pretty good performance, last years runner-up said. 

You know, three sets, Im through to round two. I felt like I hit the ball pretty cleanly. Thats what youre looking for in the first round. 

Arriving at Wimbledon as the Stella Artois champion for the third successive year, Roddick will face Italian Daniele Bracciali next. 

Bracciali won a nerve-shredding, five-set match against six-foot-10 (2.08m) Croat goant Ivo Karlovic 6-7, 7-6, 3-6, 7-6, 12-10. 

Roddick was joined in the second round by fellow-American Venus Williams who breezed past Eva Birnerova 6-2, 6-4. 

British wild card Andrew Murray crowned his Grand Slam debut with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory over George Bastl. 

Indo-Russian pair out 

Meanwhile, Sania Mirza and Anna Chakvetadze of Russia meekly surrendered in the first round of womens doubles on Tuesday. 

The Indo-Russian pair, which had reached the second round in the French Open, lost 2-6, 1-6 to Alina Jidkova of Russia and Tatiana Perebiynis of Ukraine. 

In the first set, Sania and Anna were broken in the sixth and eighth game while in the second set they lost serve in the fourth and sixth game to bow out of the competition without offering much resistance. 

Sania, however, is on a high after clinching a hard fought win against Japanese Akiko Morigami Monday in singles. She will now prepare to meet world No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round on Wednesday. Sania had beaten Kuznetsova in the Dubai meet four months ago 

Her first round win was enough to raise her ranking up by eight to 10 spots from the current No. 75. (Agencies)

 Pak as big a threat as Australia

 - Team of abundant talent faces England in the land of cricketing draws

It is hard to believe it ? so soon after the epic summer that ended in Englands first success in a series against Australia in 18 years ? but the Test series that begins against Pakistan in Multan on November 12 poses for England almost as big a challenge as the one they have just overcome. 

England have won their past six series and, because of the volatility of the area in the wake of the terrorist strike on New York on September 11, 2001 ? Pakistan have played only 12 home Tests since ? Michael Vaughan and his team will face a team of abundant natural talent guided by a shrewd English coach; the one originally favoured by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) before Duncan Fletcher got the job. 

It is purposeless to speculate what might have happened had Bob Woolmer been appointed instead of Fletcher in 1999, but he was respected in South Africa in his years as their coach and, since Javed Miandad was sacked in June 2004, he has made a promising start in organising the nucleus of players under Inzamam-ul-Haqs lofty captaincy. A young side got a pasting in Australia, it is true, but there have been three drawn series since. Pakistan recovered well after first Test defeats against Sri Lanka and the West Indies, and also came from behind in India. 

Under the experienced guidance of Shaharyar Khan, sometime ambassador to London, now chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), there has been a consistency and organisation of the natural talent that always seems to be available. It promises danger to England, both in the weeks ahead and at home next season. The main players now have central contracts and ? not without furious local opposition ? the national selectors now choose all the teams in the nine regions who compete for the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, in which the sides play eight four-day matches each. 

That England would push Australia to the limit in 2005 was obvious to anyone who had watched closely while Michael Vaughans team took shape over the past two years. The key was the fast bowling attack, the base from which most successful teams outside the subcontinent develop. But this time the place is indeed the subcontinent, and England have gone there without the bowler who seemed ideal for the purpose: Simon Jones. Having proved himself the master of late reverse swing at high pace, Jones the ball, the nearest thing to Waqar Younis since the prime of Waqar Younis, must wait until India in March to prove his recovery from an operation to remove a bone spur from his ankle. 

Without him and Chris Tremlett, the fast attack is left to Stephen Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Flintoff and, if a fourth is needed, either the untested tyro, Liam Plunkett, or, more likely, James Anderson, the confused natural from Lancashire who has lost a little swing, a little pace and a lot of confidence since his sudden rise to fame. 

It leaves the touring attack depending to a larger extent on the faithful Ashley Giles to bowl finger spin as effectively as he did in taking wickets in the three-match series on pitches that suited him nicely five years ago. The question now is whether Pakistan, with a class spinner in Danish Kaneria, a dangerous one in Shahid Afridi, and a group of genuine swing bowlers, several of high pace, will back themselves to win on bare pitches that encourage reverse swing. 

Pakistan was once the land of cricketing draws, and to some extent it still is. After two matches in keeping with the genre, Englands last tour five years ago ended in the most extraordinary manner in Karachi. A last-gasp victory for Nasser Hussains team in the darkest light that Test cricket has ever been played without the aid of floodlights. That owed much to the often maligned umpires, especially Steve Bucknor, who was determined to see justice done and time-wasting defeated. 

In the last Test played at Multan, last year on the modern ground laid out amid farmland, 45 minutes away from the city, Pakistan scored 407 in their first innings and still lost by an innings and 52 runs to India after Virender Sehwag scored 309. It was a perfect illustration of how horrible a game it can be for bowlers on the flattest of flat mud pitches. 

Others are the fact that Dennis Lillee took only three Test wickets in Pakistan at 101 runs each, that 17 of only 21 Tests played between Pakistan and England have been drawn on the subcontinent since Ted Dexters side in 1961-62 became the only one before Hussains to win a series there, and that Graham Roope once took over the wicketkeeping gloves for England when Alan Knott was injured and, according to his memory, never took a ball throughout a long session of play, for the simple reason that not one got past the bat. The winter days are short, the pitches often dead.

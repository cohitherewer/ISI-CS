 Apprentices call the shots 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: As expected, apprentice jockeys took full advantage of their seniors? two race-day suspension and walked away with four of the six events in Tuesday? race card. Vinay Jaiswal and Melvyn Maseyk were the two trainees who excelled largely on fancied runners with a brace of wins apiece.

 For Vinay, it was a dream come true after his easy wins in the two trophy events framed for the day ? the 2,000m Cupid Cup, the feature event, and the Cavalry Cup, a sprint. If his alertness paid off over the shorter trip in spite of his ride Mayavi?s awkward jump out from the gates, demands of patience and judgment over the enduring course were met by the young rider when he partnered trainer Richard Alford?s Annotate to a cruising victory.

 Melvyn, too, was equally enterprising while booting home Dream Sovereign and Salient Star ? both from trainer Errol Bhungard?s yard. For Dream Sovereign, a comfortable lead from the start was enough to hold Javed Khan?s late galloper Thanks To All at the wire by more than two lengths. Salient Star?s victory, however, revealed apprentice?s tough mind when he fought an absorbing battle with Fighting Force, incidentally ridden by elder brother Malcom, almost up the entire stretch.

 Mark Reuben was the only other professional who was in luck with a brace of wins. He had an armchair ride on Javed?s So Kind after partnering Vijay Singh?s three-year-old juvenile Aptitude to victory over Averroes, also from the winner?s stable.

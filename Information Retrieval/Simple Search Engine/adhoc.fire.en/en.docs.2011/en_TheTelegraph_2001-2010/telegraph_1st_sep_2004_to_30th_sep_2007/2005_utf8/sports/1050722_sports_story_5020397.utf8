 Autocop coasts home with main event 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Apprentice jockey Malcolm Maseyk found the target twice in Thursdays six-event race card, and each time it happened to be a Trophy event.

 Maseyk started off with a virtual armchair ride on trainer Bharath Singhs less fancied runner, Small Fry, in the Desert Shot Cup. A little over half-an-hour later, the apprentice coasted home on the Jaggy Dhariwal-trainee, Autocop, in the afternoons main event, the Schwarzenegger Cup. Bharath saddled the winner in the absence of the Bangalore-based trainer.

 The afternoon also witnessed a runaway victory of trainer Daniel Davids Magical Strike who had a troubled passage in his last start and lost to El Cid. Daniel also saddled Mr Music to victory in the Golden Praise Handicap.

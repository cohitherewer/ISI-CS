 Krishnamurthy submits report

OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Former chief election commissioner (CEC) T. S. Krishnamurthy on Monday submitted his report on the just-concluded BCCI elections to the Registrar General of the apex court. 

Krishnamurthy, who made an appearance before the Registrar General in the pre-lunch session handed over the report and went away evading the waiting newsmen. 

The Supreme Court, in its October 25 order, had asked him to submit the report within a week of the elections. 

The report would be taken up for consideration by the Court on December 12 when the contesting parties could raise objections to the conduct of the election itself.

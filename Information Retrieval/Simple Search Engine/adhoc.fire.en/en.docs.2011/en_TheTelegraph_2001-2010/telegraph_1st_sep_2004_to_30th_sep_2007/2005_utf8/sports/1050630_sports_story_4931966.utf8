 RCTC cancels seasons opener 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Owing to the delayed rains, the stewards, Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC), have decided to cancel the opening day of the citys monsoon season, scheduled for July 8, according to an RCTC notification on Wednesday. The next meeting has been billed for July 14.

 The blistering heat and humidity has prompted trainers to go easy with preparations of horses, said champion trainer Vijay Singh over telephone from Bangalore where he will be camping till July 10, the Derby day. 

 Other trainers also felt that the late last week rain have brought about some relief, but most horses may not go for the pace-work before the next couple of days. The fast-work may have to wait for another 10 days.

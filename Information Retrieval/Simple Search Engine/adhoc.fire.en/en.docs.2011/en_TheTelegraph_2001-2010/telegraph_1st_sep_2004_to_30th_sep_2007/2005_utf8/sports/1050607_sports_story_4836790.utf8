 Ill give my all: Narain

New Delhi: Though unfamiliar with the North American circuits, Narain Karthikeyan is hoping to enjoy his driving at the Candian GP Sunday. 

The two North American races will be a bit difficult for me as I have never driven on these circuits; which will be different from my teammate (Tiago Monteiro) who has already raced in Montreal when he was in Champ Car, Karthikeyan said. 

However, I think I will enjoy driving in Canada as it seems to be very similar to Australia, a track that I particularly liked, the fastest Indian said of the Gilles Villeneuve Circuit in Canada which will host the first of the two races on the North American leg. 

The 28-year-old said he would concentrate on learning the track lay-out in the first free practise sessions so that he could add up to the good memories the Jordan team has had on this circuit so far. 

I will have to spend the first sessions learning the layout but that should be ok. I know this is a circuit which has been quite successful for Jordan Grand Prix; I will then give my all and try to have a good race and a good result for the team. 

Last week, Jordan Grand Prix carried out a two-day test at Silverstone with Karthikeyan and Monteiro in changing conditions in preparation for the North American races. 

Seven teams participated in the last test session before the British GP and Jordan completed over 700km of test mileage. (PTI)

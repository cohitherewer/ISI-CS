The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tolly, SBT in goalless tie

Kozhikode: An all-out aggressive game by State Bank of Travancore and an equally strong defensive tactics by Tollygunge Agragami, Calcutta resulted in a goalless draw in a sixth round match in the National Football League at the Corporation Stadium here Sunday. 

If the bankmen were to be faulted for failing to convert despite enjoying territorial superiority, it was Tollygunge?s custodian Arindam Ghosh, later named the Man-of-the-Match, who really saved the game for the visitors. 

SBT?s Abdul Hakkim missed two bright chances in the 23rd and 34th minute as also midfielder Pradeep and striker Ignatious Sylvester, who came as substitute, minutes before the breather. 

Tollygunge went for solid defence right from the start, but SBT, in a must-win situation to improve their points tally, went on a rampage till the end. However, Kerala?s premier soccer outfit did not come up with long passes as expected and their goalbound smashes were not powerful either. Tollygunge now have nine points from six matches, while SBT have five in as many rounds. 

 Vasco geared up 

Undettered by the string of defeats at home Vasco are all geared up to take on formidable Mahindra United on Monday in the sixth round of the ninth National Football League at Nehru Stadium, adds another report from Margao. 

Vasco, who are struggling below at the bottom with two points from five matches know that the team will have to rise and give their best if they are to achieve their first win. 

?We have worked out a strategy to bottle their free flowing midfield. That would give us edge to attack our rival goal. Our team is playing well as a unit but the strikers have let us down by not converting goals which has put us down below without a win,? Vasco coach Derick Pereira said.

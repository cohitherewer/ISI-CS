The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nabi makes amends for penalty miss

 - CFL PREMIER DIVISION 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Nabi is atop the scorers list with eight goals 

Calcutta: Syed Rahim Nabi could so easily have been the villain of the show at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. He blasted a penalty kick over the crosspiece in the CFL Premier Division tie against Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), but made amends later to set up a 2-1 win for East Bengal. 

This was the striker-turned-defender-turned-strikers eighth goal of the league, putting him atop the scorers list, ahead of Gley Yao Rodrigue. 

Victory didnt come easy for East Bengal. They failed to breach the CPT defence till 80 minutes before scoring two quick goals. 

Alvito DCunha, taking on the responsibility of the principal game-maker, did the spadework. His back pass from deep inside the box and found K. Kulothungan whose right-footer bulged the netting. 

Minutes later, Sasthi Duley moved down the right and essayed a through pass for Nabi. The opportunistic striker placed the ball on the run past the advancing goalkeeper to make it 2-0. 

There was still enough fight left in CPT who stung East Bengal with a late goal. Sandip Ghoshs free-kick from the right was flicked towards the near post by Shyambabu Raut, and a diving Srimanta Das headed the ball in. 

CPT did well to keep East Bengal under pressure in the first session. Srimanta and Pradip Indu down the flanks, along with the hard-working Soumitra Chakraborty and Sandip Ghosh kept the red-and-and-golds defence on their toes. 

Chakrabortys nice backvolley was brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Abhro Mondal in the 40th minute. The custodian once again came to East Bengals rescue when he palmed over a a dangerous free-kick from Amar Pyne. 

Nabi missed the penalty in the 34th minute. It was awarded when DCunha was tripped inside the box by Kamal Bhuinya. 

DCunha was quite a livewire and was rightly adjudged Man of the Match. Having made a slow start to the season, he seems to be regaining his best form. He didnt get much assistance in the first 45 minutes, but after change of ends, things improved significantly. 

The hitherto under-utilised wings came alive with DCunha and Duley working in tandem. DCunhas powerful left-footer best the brought out of CPT goalkeeper Sandip Guha in the 51st minute. Rabi Karmakar then thwarted Nabis header with a goalline save. 

The East Bengal attacks increased in number and the inevitable only got delayed. 

East Bengal have 28 points from 12 matches, CPT 11 from 12.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand draws with Leko as well

 - LINARES MEET 

 Garri Kasparov opened up a two-point lead 

Linares: Viswanathan Anand drew with Corus champion Peter Leko of Hungary in the tenth round of the 22nd Linares Super Grandmasters chess tournament here at. 

World?s top rated Garri Kasparov continued with his demolition act and almost sealed the top place in this year?s event after scoring a positional victory over local lad Francisco Pons Vallejo. 

In the other game of the day Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan put an end to a string of losses and shared the point with Michael Adams of England. 

With just four rounds remaining in this Category-20 double roun-robin tournament between seven players, Kasparov stretched his lead to a huge 2 points over Anand and Bulgarian Veselin Topalov who had a bye Saturday. 

The Russian certainly is attesting to the common belief that there is still a lot more to come from him even if his best might already have passed. 

After giving a lesson on chess technique to Vallejo, Kasparov took his tally to 6.5 points from his nine games in the event and even though Anand and Topalov (both 4.5 points) have played one game less than the leader, the lead margin of two points looks near decisive at this stage. 

Corus champion Peter Leko is also on 4.5 points but he is yet to get his second bye, which puts him a shade behind Anand and Topalov while Adams with 4 is next in the standings. Kasimdzhanov with 3.5 and Vallejo with 2.5 (eight games) hold the last two spots in the Euro 2,97,000 prize money event. 

Anand, yet again, could not prove a point against the Sicilian Sveshnikov with his white pieces. 

In the last five games including the one against Kasparov here earlier in the tournament, Anand has been able to score just two points with his white pieces against this opening that has become a regular feature in elite chess these days. 

Leko, who, in fact, defeated Anand playing the same opening at the Corus tournament earlier this year, was comfortably placed right through the game even as Anand deviated from main variations and tried something unusual. 

By the 14th move itself the queens were off the board and 10 more moves later the players decided to split the point. 

Kasparov faced the Slav defence by Vallejo. Methodical play in the opening ensured a slight advantage for Kasparov who did not let through any slip thereafter.It was a virtual treat for the spectators as Kasparov improved his position inch by inch to reach a better queen and minor piece endgame wherein Vallejo collapsed decisively to lose a pawn. 

Giving little respite in the result queen endgame, Kasparov wrapped the issue in 54 moves. Adams, playing white pressurised Kasimdzhanov for a long time but in the end the Uzbek showed resilience to wriggle out with a draw

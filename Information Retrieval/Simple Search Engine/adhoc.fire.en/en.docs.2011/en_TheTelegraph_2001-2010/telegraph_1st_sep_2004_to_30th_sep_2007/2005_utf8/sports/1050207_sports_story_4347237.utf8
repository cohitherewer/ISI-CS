 ?India tour will be as tough as Australia? 

 - Chief selector Bari hints at two specialist spinners

Islamabad: Pakistan?s chief selector Wasim Bari believes the upcoming series against India would be as tough as the one against Australia but is optimistic of his young team pulling off a win against the arch-rivals by dint of its fighting spirit. 

?The Indian tour had always been difficult for Pakistan because of certain reasons and beating India in India is as tough as defeating Australia in Australia,? Bari was quoted as saying in local daily Dawn on Sunday. 

He said Pakistan had shown fighting spirit in the last three matches of the ongoing tri-series competition down under ?I do hope that with the same fighting spirit Pakistan can win in India,? he said. 

Pakistan is scheduled to visit India after six years to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals later this month. 

He said it was the first time that eight youngsters had been included in the team and the bunch was finally clicking in one-day competition. 

Although Bari did not reveal about the composition of the squad for the Indian trip, he hinted that two specialist spinners would be included. 

?The load will be on the spin department as the Indians are very much likely to follow their tradition of preparing spinning wickets,? he said adding the process of identifying players had already started. 

Bari also said paceman Shoaib Akhtar would be considered only after the selection committee got a green signal from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

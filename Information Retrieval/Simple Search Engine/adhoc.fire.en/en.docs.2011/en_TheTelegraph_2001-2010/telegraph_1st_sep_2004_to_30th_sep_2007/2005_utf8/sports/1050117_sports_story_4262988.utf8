The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Leander decision tomorrow

New Delhi: Indian tennis star Leander Paes is recovering from his foot injury, but a final decision on his participation in the Australian Open can be taken only on Tuesday, his father, Dr Vece Paes said on Sunday. 

Dr Paes said the cast on Leander?s foot has been taken off and he has made good progress in the last few days. 

?Leander is much better and getting his treatment in Melbourne. It seems like a sprain to the ligament of the foot and ankle,? Dr Paes said. 

?The tests had earlier shown that there is no fracture or ligament tear,? he added. 

Dr Paes said a final decision on whether the 31-year-old will play in the Grand Slam will be taken after giving him some more time. 

?A final decision will be taken on Tuesday,? he said. 

Leander twisted his ankle Thursday while playing with Nenad Zimonjic in the quarter final match against eventual winners Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge in the Medibank international tournament in Sydney.

 Day I action falls through

Bangalore: Play was abandoned on Day I of Sri Lankas three-day tour opener against Board Presidents XI following wet ground conditions and dampness on the pitch at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday. 

The Sri Lankans as well as the Yalaka Venugopal Rao-led Indian outfit appeared a disappointed lot but they could do little as the weather did not oblige them. (PTI)

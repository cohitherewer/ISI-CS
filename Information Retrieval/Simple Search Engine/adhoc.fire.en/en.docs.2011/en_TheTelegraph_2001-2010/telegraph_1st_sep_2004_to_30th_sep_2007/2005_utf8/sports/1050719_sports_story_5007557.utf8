The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF guidelines needed for contracts

 - Ive no personal scores to settle? Ill set my dos and donts as the season progresses: Bhaichung Bhutia 

NILESH BHATTACHARYA

 Bhaichung Bhutia works out at a gym in the city on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh 

Calcutta: They say old habits die soon. But not with Bhaichung Bhutia. 

He came to the Indian football scenario as the charming prince. Over the years hes matured and placed himself in the position of an undisputed king. But there is no feeling of satiation as the Indian captain still feels the challenge to break more barriers. 

It sometimes hurts me that the concept of Bhaichung Bhutia has remained a one-off phenomenon, that nobody is coming up in a big way to take the mantle from me. But Im optimistic, he told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview on Monday. 

He was free-wheeling in giving voice to a host of issues plaguing the game here in the same manner his rhythm finds expression on the field. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q The physical problems and 

 related hazards seem to have gone in the background now? 

 A Yes. Im ready to 

 come out with all my energy and enthusiasm. Ive managed 

 to keep aside those days of injury and agony. True, injury 

 is part and parcel of a playing career and you have to live 

 with it. But having said that, you need to look ahead, face 

 the reality and get prepared to come back stronger. 

 So youre looking forward 

 to a new season with new convictions? 

 You have to start from zero. You 

 just cant sit pretty on what youve achieved 

 in the previous season. Thats my way of thinking and 

 stepping into a new situation. Ive been fighting with 

 my injury and thus, the focus is obviously to bounce back. 

 But its certainly not going to be in a way that it 

 can be interpreted as old wine in new bottle. 

 There are lots more to prove 

 now? 

 Its definitely going to 

 be a tough season ahead, but no, Ive no personal scores 

 to settle? Rather its a challenge ? a challenge within 

 me to improve my game, to pursue my goals. Ill set 

 my dos and donts as the season progresses. And all 

 this depends on how I feel the challenge growing in me. 

 What do you see while choosing 

 a club to play for? 

 The clubs environment, of 

 course. The teams reputation and relations with players 

 ? everything comes under consideration and in the end, the 

 whole thing, I believe, gets down to how comfortable you 

 are feeling with the club and its culture. 

 Do East Bengal fulfil your 

 criteria? 

 You can say Ive been happy with them. Theres 

 a bit of comfort level existing between the club and me. 

 That, of course, doesnt mean I have no intention 

 to get out of this comfort zone. If I find an opportunity 

 exciting and challenging enough, Ill definitely explore 

 it. 

 Is another overseas stint 

 round the corner? 

 No, not now. My priority this 

 season will be to remain injury-free. At least for a year, 

 Ive no plans of going outside India. Afterwards, who 

 knows? 

 Now coming back to the issue 

 of playing environment, do you think that the clubs here 

 are professional in relation to the players? 

 To be honest, no. The clubs are 

 trying nowadays, but there is still a long way to go before 

 developing a healthy relationship between the two. From 

 the players end, they look indecisive whether to make 

 a career out of football or treat the game as the way to 

 get a job. The clubs, on the other hand, are always in hunt 

 of success. This is not bad, I must say, but this tendency 

 also puts the players under tremendous pressure? particularly 

 living up to the expectations of supporters. I really feel 

 for an urgency to make the situation convenient for both 

 parties. 

 Could the introduction of 

 professional league be a solution? 

 It should be a good option. But 

 the AIFF has a bigger role to play here. They need to see 

 to it that the league offers adequate level of comfort to 

 the players. The players, in turn, will have to change their 

 mindset. Its this mutual understanding that can make 

 things happen. 

 But we need a starting point and the professional 

 league could be it. 

 Lets get across to a 

 key component of any professional set-up: the terms and 

 conditions in a players contract with the club. Each 

 season starts with quite a few cases being forwarded to 

 the AIFF players status committee. Your take on that? 

 I think the federation must formulate comprehensive 

 and exhaustive guidelines for contracts that a player may 

 have with the club. The sooner it happens the better for 

 everybody concerned. See, a player remains in the dark as 

 long as his case is pending: he doesnt know when he 

 may resume practice and for which club! The relationship 

 with the club gets affected, a sense of mistrust is generated? 

 Any light at the end of the tunnel looks like a mirage to 

 him. 

 This calls for the federations immediate intervention. 

 Because if everything is bound by the federations 

 contract, this problem will be minimised. 

 Will the concept of hiring 

 an agent work here? 

 I doubt. Firstly, India doesnt 

 have a big market. Secondly, the clubs are not into this 

 kind of culture. Its difficult to get into this groove 

 in our case. 

 Lets move across to 

 another tricky issue ? the club-versus-country contention. 

 Its a global problem and India is no exception? 

 But Indias is a different 

 case. In Europe and even in Brazil, the players are always 

 in practice due to hectic club assignments. So a short-term 

 national camp is preferred. Plus, the national federation 

 over there has a good screening system in place ? which 

 player should be picked or rested. 

 But for a player, isnt 

 being part of a modern pre-season training a better option 

 than boarding the flight to Fiji? 

 Dont forget that its part of the national 

 teams preparation for the Asian Games. Fiji may not 

 be a big shot, but its an exposure trip and its 

 important that the team gets as many exposures as possible 

 in whatever way. 

The camp (currently going on in Bangalore) may rob the club of a few key players during their pre-season training and it may harm the East Bengal and Mohun Bagans for few days. But such trips are good for us in the longer process. 

Clubs can win tournaments, but its through the national teams development, we can hope for international recognition. 

 So this requires an immediate move from the federation 

 to sit with the clubs. Issues like releasing of players, 

 organising and time-span of national camps need to be sorted 

 out at the earliest. 

 Have you ever expressed your 

 views to the federation by virtue of being the Indian captain? 

 No. But if Im approached, 

 Ill do this. 

 It seems you prefer to be 

 politically correct all the time. Are you joining politics? 

 following in the footsteps of I.M. Vijayan... 

 No way. Politics is not my cup 

 of tea. 

 After retirement? 

 Im too young 

 to think of my retirement.

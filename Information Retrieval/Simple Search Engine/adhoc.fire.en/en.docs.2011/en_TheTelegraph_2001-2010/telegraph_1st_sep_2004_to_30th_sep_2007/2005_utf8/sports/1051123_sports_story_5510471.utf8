 Indians fail to win a medal

Istanbul: International Master Elisabeth Paehtz of Germany won the girls title at the World Junior Chess Championship with an easy draw against WGM Dronavalli Harika in the 13th and final round game here on Tuesday. 

Paehtz finished with an overall tally of 10 points and her final round draw with white pieces ensured that no one was able to catch her. 

The boys championship was formally won by GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan and he became the first player in the history of the championship to win it twice. 

In the final round, Mamedyarov played out a draw with Jan Smeets of the Netherlands and finished with a tally of 10.5 points out of a possible 11. 

For once, the Indian youngsters failed to bring home a medal in either category after Harika drew her game. It was a big contrast from their last years performance when GM Pendyala Harikrishna won the boys event while Eesha Karavade finished third. 

GM Deep Sengupta emerged as the best Indian amongst six boys scoring 8 points in all. In the final round, Sengupta defeated Bartlomiej Heberla of Poland in spectacular fashion. 

In the boys championship, GM Ferenc Berkes (9.5 points) of Hungary won the silver after beating Finnish GM Tomi Nyback comprehensively in the last round game. 

GMs Evgeny Alekseev of Russia and Vugar Gashimov were jointly tied for the third spot on 9 points. 

In the girls section, the silver went to erstwhile leader Gu Xiaobing of China who played a remarkable game to beat WGM Tania Sachdev and finished on 9.5 points. 

Here also there was a tie for the third place between Turkan Mamedyarova of Azerbaijan and Beata of Poland who both have 9 points. (PTI)

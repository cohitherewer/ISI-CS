 Im going after him: Roddick

 - American pips Johansson in epic semi-final to set up rematch with Federer

London: Andy Roddick has the unenviable task of trying to stop the Roger Federer juggernaut in a Wimbledon final for the second successive year on Sunday. 

Despite his impressive record on grass, the 22-year-old will have to come up with something special if he is to snap the twice champions 35-match winning streak on the green stuff and lay his hands on the Challenge Cup. 

While Swiss Federer is bidding to become only the third man in the professional era to complete a hattrick of Wimbledon titles after Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras, Roddick is aiming to win his first. 

On Saturday, Roddick survived a fierce Thomas Johansson onslaught to reach the final with a 6-7, 6-2, 7-6, 7-6 victory. 

The American second seed set up a rematch with world No.1 and champion Roger Federer by rebounding from a set down to win the rain-interrupted semi-final after nearly three hours of exhilarating tennis. 

Following his heroics on Saturday, Roddick has less than 24 hours to chalk up a plan against Federer. The American benefited from an outrageous netcord in the fourth set tie-break to bring up match point, and sunk to his knees in delight as he finally booked his place with a thunderbolt delivery. 

I definitely got very lucky in that fourth set tie-break, said Roddick as he walked off court covered in dirt. Theres no questioning hes been the better player over the last two years, no one would argue otherwise. I have to be better tomorrow. Im going to have to go in and play my game and play well. Its as simple as that. 

Im ecstatic to play Roger again and will be ready to go tomorrow no matter what. 

Federer is the only man who boasts a better grasscourt record than Roddick since 2003. 

Frustratingly for Roddick, both of his two defeats on the surface over the past two seasons have been dealt by the Swiss at Wimbledon. 

My consistency now over the last few years has been definitely incredible for me, said Federer, who has won his last 20 finals. Its basically impossible to break down my mental part now these days. 

Doesnt matter how many matches Ive lost or won, I feel like I always go into every match knowing I can win it if my form is there. 

Also if Im not playing so well, sometimes I know that I can sneak through and just wait for the big moments, that I can play my good tennis right then. 

I think knowing that is very important because tennis is quite a mental sport. 

I cant really do more than play my optimum, said the world No. 4, who was boosted up to second seed for Wimbledon. I hope that its the best in the big moments. I dont know if many people are expecting me to win tomorrow. Im going to come out and play free and Im going to go after him. 

Few, however, would bet against Federer taking his place alongside Sampras and Borg in the Wimbledon record books.

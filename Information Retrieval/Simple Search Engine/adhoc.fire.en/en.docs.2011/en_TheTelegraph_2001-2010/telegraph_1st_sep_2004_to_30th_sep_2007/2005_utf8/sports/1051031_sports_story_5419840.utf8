 Barreto brace gives Mahindra title

Margao: Jose Ramirez Barretos double strike guided Mumbai outfit Mahindra United to the 27th Federation Cup by beating Sporting Clube de Goa in the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. 

With crowd fully backing the home side, Mahindras looked perplexed in the first half and played a waiting game even as Sporting probed more into the rival box but found stiff resistance from the defence where Mahesh Gawli cut off their moves. 

Steven Dias, who was the architect in Mahindras semi-final win against Churchill Brothers, was well checked by the Sporting defenders and as a result Barreto hardly got opportunities to score. 

But as soon as the Brazilian got a chance in the 36th minute, he did not let down his team and scored when K. Ajayan put a through pass beating the rival defence. An unmarked Barreto, raced into the box and essayed a left footer which deflected defender Felip Gomes, beat keeper Felix to find the net. 

Sporting, who looked more resourceful in the second half, equalised in the 56th minute through a penalty by Dudu Omagbemi. The penalty was little harsh as Manu, who made a sliding tackle on Dudu made contact with the ball even as the latter fell down inside the box. 

The goal spur Sporting who attacked their rival goal with more power. They brought in Adebayo Adewusi in place of Joseph Pereira which gave them more thrust in attack but found Mahindras defence that stood rock solid denying them of scoring opportunities. 

Mahindra kept their cool and nearly succeeded in finding the winner in the dying minutes but Vincent Pires made a goal line save off Barreto header and off the rebound Manju shot over. Mahindra scored the winner in the last minute when Barreto scored off a well directed cross by Steven Dias to give the Mumbai outfit a deserving win . 

Top scorer (six goals) Barreto was awarded the Golden Boot and Rs 1 lakh. (PTI)

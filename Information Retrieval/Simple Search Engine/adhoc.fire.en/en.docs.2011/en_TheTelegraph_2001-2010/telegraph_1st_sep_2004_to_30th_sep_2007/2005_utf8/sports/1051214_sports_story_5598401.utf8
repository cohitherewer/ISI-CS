 Injured Pietersen returning home

Karachi: England batsman Kevin Pietersen is returning home after failing to recover from a rib injury. 

Scans taken after the first ODI showed no fracture but demonstrated a stress lesion and despite passing a fitness test ahead of the second match, Kevin suffered intolerable pain throughout, England doctor Peter Gregory said in a statement. 

Gregory said an injury such as Pietersens normally required four to six weeks rest. 

It is expected that Kevin will make a full recovery in time for the tour to India in March next year, he said. 

Pietersen said he was disappointed to be leaving the tour with the ODI series level at 1-1. 

I was looking forward to a strong one-day series, he said. I hate missing matches and despite trying to play the first couple of ODIs, the pain was just too great. 

I certainly wouldnt want to let my teammates down due to injury whether it is with the bat or in the field, so the only choice available to me is to rest with a view to a full recovery in time for India. 

Stand-in captain Marcus Trescothick said Pietersen had struggled during the second ODI on Monday. His injury affected his batting and as the game went on, he was clearly hampered by it. It is not the ideal situation for us, Trescothick said. (Reuters)

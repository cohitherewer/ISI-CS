 Collingwoods call-up puts Giles in a spot

 - Aussies enjoy decent workout vs Worcestershire 

 DEREK PRINGLE

 The Aussies sweat it out at Edgbaston on Tuesday 

The damp, grassy Edgbaston pitch, which has caused enough concern among England selectors for them to call up Paul Collingwood for the second Ashes Test on Thursday, will place pressure on spin bowler Ashley Giles, a man waging a war of words against his detractors. 

Birmingham has experienced unusually large amounts of rainfall in the last few days, David Graveney, the chairman of selectors, said Monday night. Having looked at the pitch, weve decided to add Paul Collingwood to the squad so we have the maximum number of options. 

It was England captain Michael Vaughan and coach Duncan Fletcher, when they went to see the pitch on Monday, who first alerted selectors to the need to add options to the squad. 

The rest of the country knew about it a great deal earlier after groundsman Steve Rouse had voiced his concerns following a drenching by last Thursdays freak tornado which devastated nearby houses. 

Overlooked when the squad was announced last Sunday, Collingwood, 29, has made three hundreds in his last two matches for Durham. 

If he does play, adding to the two Test caps he won against Sri Lanka two winters ago, it will be in place of another bowler (almost certainly Giles if the pitch remains seamer-friendly), which means his medium-pace swingers may need to be counted upon for at least 15 overs a day. 

Collingwoods inclusion will be noted by Australia, who will be satisfied that their batsmen and bowlers enjoyed decent work-outs against Worcestershire at New Road. 

They will have to wait for their first peep of the Test pitch on Tuesday but the strip at New Road, Worcester, at least on Sunday, might have provided them with a sneak preview. 

With the first day washed out, Ricky Ponting seemed content to opt for batting practice despite bowling out Worcestershire for 187 in 44 overs. 

Out of sorts in the first innings, he did not enforce the follow-on, instead opening the innings himself with Michael Clarke. The idea was to find some fluency, something Clarke managed with a sparkling fifty off 44 balls, but not the captain, who took 22 balls to get off the mark. 

Unlike his opposite number Vaughan, Ponting clearly believes in the value of spending time in the middle rather than in the nets. 

But while the benefits of his unbeaten 113-ball 59 were not overly clear on Monday (his silky timing had not quite returned and he was still going hard at the ball), they may become apparent when England bowl at him in a few days time. 

Dirty runs are not a currency Vaughan seems able to deal in. A batsman who likes to hit the ball in the vee between mid-off and mid-on, he needs to middle the ball to score freely. 

Mostly he does, but when he doesnt, he lacks the scruffy dabs and nudges that ensure bad trots are not always fallow ones. Happy for England, then, that his hundred against Kent was full of classy strokes. 

Vaughan will be made to work much harder by Australias bowlers, whose principal enforcers, Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, spent this match ferrying drinks and fresh gloves to their team-mates in the middle. 

However, while their class is guaranteed, irrespective of the conditions, the bad news for England is that Jason Gillespie, Australias weak link so far this tour, deserved more than the two for 45 he took from a 12-over spell.

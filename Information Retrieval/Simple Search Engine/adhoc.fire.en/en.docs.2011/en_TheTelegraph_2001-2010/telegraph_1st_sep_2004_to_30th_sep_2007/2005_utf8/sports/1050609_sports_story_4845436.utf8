Sao Paulo: A teary-eyed Pele admitted that his son was involved with a gang of cocaine traffickers arrested by police a day earlier. 

Like any father, its sad to see your son involved with groups like these, being arrested, because he will have to suffer the consequences, Pele said at a press conference at the state police narcotics division headquarters. 

Edson Cholbi Nascimento, 35, a former professional soccer player known as Edinho, was among about 50 people arrested on Monday in the seaside city of Santos, about 70 km south-east of Sao Paulo. 

Those who know Edinho and lived with him could hardly imagine that this would happen, Pele said. 

Unfortunately, I was perhaps working too much and didnt notice. Its regrettable, because Ive always fought intensely against drugs and I didnt notice this in my own house. 

Edinho was charged with criminal association with drug traffickers. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. 

In a statement released to the media, Edinho said he began using drugs out of curiosity after he quit professional soccer and regretted having set a bad example. 

Edinho was a second-string goalkeeper for eight years on Santos, Peles former club. He retired from professional soccer in 1999. 

The same year, he was convicted of vehicular homicide for taking part in a 1992 car race on a city street that killed a motorcyclist. He was sentenced to six years in a work-release programme.

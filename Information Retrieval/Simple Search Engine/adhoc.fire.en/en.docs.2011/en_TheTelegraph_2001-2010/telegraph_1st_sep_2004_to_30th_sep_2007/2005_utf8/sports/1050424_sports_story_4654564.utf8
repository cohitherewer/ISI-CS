The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Wright?s no to SA feeler

 - Former Team India coach wants a ?complete break? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: John Wright, whose four-and-half year innings as the Team India coach ended last Sunday, has said ?no? to a feeler from South Africa. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources in Johannesburg, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) ?requested? one of the Protean greats to call on its behalf. 

The gentleman, who isn?t directly connected with the administration of cricket there, telephoned Wright towards the end of the just-ended ODI series against Pakistan. 

Wright, one learns, ?thanked? him for the call, but emphasised he needed a ?complete break? after years of being on the move and away from his children ? Harry and Georgie. 

A divorcee, Wright is currently in New Delhi and will leave for New Zealand (from Mumbai) after five-six days. 

Barring a skiing vacation with his kids in August, though, Wright hasn?t planned anything. Coaching another international side is ? at this point ? farthest from his thoughts. 

Indeed, hours before the end of his Team India tenure, Wright told us he would be ?easing off for a month or two? on getting back to Christchurch. 

That?s priority No. 1. 

The South Africans are, at present, coached by selector Ray Jennings. However, he only has interim-status and is contracted till May 15, when the ongoing tour of the West Indies ends. 

The UCBSA opted for Jennings (incidentally, a former wicketkeeper) as Eric Simons? resignation in the lead-up to last November-December?s tour of India, took it by surprise. 

Jennings is the third appointee in the last six years, specifically since Bob Woolmer quit after the 1999 World Cup. 

Woolmer was succeeded by Graham Ford who, in turn, got replaced by Simons. Then began this interim era.

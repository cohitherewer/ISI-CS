 Coulthard backtracks

London: Briton David Coulthard has backtracked on his suggestion that Formula One drivers could go on strike over safety concerns. 

I dont think theres any risk in the drivers taking a strike, a British website quoted the Scot as telling reporters at a Red Bull team function in Istanbul at the weekend. 

Turkey is making its Grand Prix debut next month. 

Coulthards comments came after he suggested in a Scottish daily, that strike action could hit the second half of the season if the drivers concerns were not addressed.

 Sibanda, Mwayenga fined

Harare: Two leading Zimbabwe cricketers and an official have been fined by a magistrates court for violating foreign exchange regulations, a state daily reported on Saturday. 

The newspaper said long-serving national cricket team manager Mohammed Meman was fined one million dollars ($13) and national team players Vusi Sibanda, 800,000 dollars and Waddington Mwayenga 400,000 dollars. 

The three were arrested last week following investigations by Zimbabwes Central Bank into Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC)s financial affairs. 

The three pleaded guilty to breaching the countrys exchange control regulations when they were initially arraigned before the court, the paper said. The newspaper said the cricketers and official worked for ZC and were entitled to marketing and match fees in foreign currency each time they travelled on national duty. In July last year, the cricket league informed Meman it was holding on to $6,750 in marketing and match fees due to him, the newspaper said.

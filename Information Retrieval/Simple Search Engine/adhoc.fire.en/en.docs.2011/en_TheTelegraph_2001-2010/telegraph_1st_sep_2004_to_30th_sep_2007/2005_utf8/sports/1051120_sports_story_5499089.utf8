 Nalbandian to face Federer music in final

 - 6-0, 6-0 win by Swiss a first in the history of the competition 

 Roger Federer after his win over Gaston Gaudio in Shanghai on Saturday 

Shanghai: Roger Federer created history with a whitewash of Argentinas Gaston Gaudio on Saturday and moved to within one win of a third straight title at the season-ending Masters Cup. 

The runaway world number one will face another Argentine, David Nalbandian, in Sundays final after dishing out the first 6-0, 6-0 defeat in the 35-year history of the competition. 

Victory over Nalbandian would also see Federer match John McEnroes professional-era record for a season of 82-3 set in 1984, but the Swiss is feeling no pressure. 

If it doesnt happen I still had a fantastic year, said the Wimbledon and US Open champion. 

I think only losing three matches is quite extraordinary. The most I can lose now is four matches. I still believe thats a great result too. 

Nalbandian had briefly threatened to copy Federers one-sided scoreline at the $4.45 million event, but faced spirited second-set resistance from Russias Nikolay Davydenko before winning 6-0, 7-5. 

Nalbandian is the first Argentine to reach the final since Guillermo Vilas won the tournament in 1974. 

Federer pulverised Gaudio to extend his winning streak to 35 matches. 

It was also the first 6-0, 6-0 win of Federers career, all the more remarkable as the Swiss is playing his first event since injuring his ankle during practice last month. 

In Davis Cup Ive had a 6-0, 6-0, 6-2 against Britain, but 6-0, 6-0 has never happened, shrugged Federer. Its nice to have ? no more than that. 

Federer appeared slightly embarrassed by the ease of his victory and offered his sympathy to Gaudio. 

To get that sort of treatment is no fun for anybody, Federer said. I played fantastic tennis. I think he should still leave this tournament feeling good about himself. 

His first (Masters Cup) semi-final and hes had a solid year. He shouldnt be miserable now for a month. I wouldnt be. 

Federers 35th consecutive victory gave him the joint fifth longest winning streak in the mens game alongside Bjorn Borg in 1978 and Thomas Muster in 1995. 

Federer is still 11 victories short of Vilass record of 46 straight wins in 1977. 

A shell-shocked Gaudio had no answer to Federers deadly accuracy and was smarting after the 50-minute thrashing. 

No excuses, said a dejected Gaudio. I was playing against the best player in history. Im sad about it but what can I do? I prefer not to be here today. 

Nalbandian has the daunting task of stopping Federer from joining Ilie Nastase (1971-73) and Ivan Lendl (1985-87) as the only players to have won three in a row at the season-ending extravaganza. 

Federer beat Nalbandian in three sets in the tournaments curtain-raiser last weekend, his first match since spraining his right ankle during practice in Basel on October 11. 

He has also won 14 straight matches against Argentine opposition but Nalbandian said he did not believe that was an omen.

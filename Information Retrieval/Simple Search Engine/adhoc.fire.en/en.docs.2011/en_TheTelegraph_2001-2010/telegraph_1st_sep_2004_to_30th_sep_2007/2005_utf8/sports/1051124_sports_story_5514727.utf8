The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Leonardo still rues his lone red card

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Brazilian World Cupper Leonardo still regrets the incident of Brazil-US second round match in 1994 World Cup where he was given the marching orders after the skilful Brazilian elbowed American Tab Ramos in a freak incident. That was the first and last red card in my career, I was really frustrated as Brazil had not won the title in the last 24 years, Leonardo said on Wednesday. Incidentally, Brazil won the Cup in 1994. 

The Brazilian, who runs a social organisation partnering another World Cupper Rai, is happy with the way his organisation is running and the way kids are being brought up there. The organisations job is to look after the upbringing of poor children and providing them with education. We encourage kids to do whatever they like, Leonardo said. 

Reverting back to the game, Leonardo feels that India have the potential to make it to the international standard, but they need to learn the tactics of dealing with different situations. They must know how to tackle tough situations, trying too hard wont help. They also need foreign exposures and exchange programmes to excel, he said. 

Asked how he coped in different positions after starting his career as left winger, Leonardo said: Over the years, I have grown as a footballer and tried to become comfortable in every position the coaches wanted me to play. 

Leonardo is aware that his countrymate Jose Ramirez Barreto used to play in Calcutta and termed him a good ambassador of Brazil football. I have also seen on television, how another Brazilian Cristiano Junior died on the field, he said. I can understand, it was hard on his family, but as a striker he went for the ball and there was nothing wrong in it, he stated. 

The Brazilain seemed to have been bowled over by the passion for soccer in India. Its very nice to see the passion for football here. It seems a little bit like Brazil. The people here know everything about European clubs like AC Milan.

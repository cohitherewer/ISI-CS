 Shabbir reported for suspect action again

Bridgetown: Pakistans fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action during the first Test against the West Indies, the International Cricket Council has announced. 

Ahmed took five wickets in the match, which Pakistan lost by 276 runs with more than a day to spare at Kensington Oval in Barbados Sunday. 

Ahmed and team officials were not immediately available to comment on the allegations. It was the third time in his six-year international career that the 29-year-old has been reported by international umpires. 

He was suspect when he first came into the Pakistan side in September 1999 during a tournament in Toronoto and again in January 2004 after a one-day International against New Zealand. Ahmed has worked with Michael Holding and others to correct his delivery. 

Shabbir will remain eligible to play ? at the discretion of the Pakistan Cricket Board ? in the second and final Test against the West Indies which begins in Jamaica next Friday. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said before the match that Shabbir had been cleared by experts in Perth over a year ago. There was concern then but he has been cleared to play, he said. 

If the umpires or Match Referee make another report, then obviously we will have to look at it. (AP)

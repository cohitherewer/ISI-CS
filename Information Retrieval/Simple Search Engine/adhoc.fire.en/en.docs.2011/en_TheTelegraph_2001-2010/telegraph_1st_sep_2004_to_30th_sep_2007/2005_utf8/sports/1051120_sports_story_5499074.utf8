 Team India square series in style 

 - BANGALORE ODI 

 Six-wicket defeat for Graeme Smith amp; Co. 

 Irfan Pathan in action on Saturday 

Bangalore: Virender Sehwag came out of a prolonged form slump with a sparkling unbeaten 77 as India notched up a comfortable six-wicket victory over South Africa in the second one day International on Saturday. 

After restricting the visitors for a modest 169 for nine on a spinning track, Sehwag gave glimpses of his vintage form with a belligerent 62-ball knock to help India overhaul the target with 14.2 overs to spare and square the five-match one-day series for the Pepsi Cup. 

Sehwag came in to bat at the No. 4 slot and quickly swung the game decisively in Indias favour with his lusty hitting while Gautam Gambhir (38) and Irfan Pathan (37) were the other notable contributors in the low-scoring floodlit encounter at the Chinnaswamy. The South Africans were done in by the slow turning track which was brilliantly exploited by the Indian spinners after Pathan (three for 23) produced a devastating opening spell. 

None of the South African batsmen could hang in for long after being put into bat as the wickets kept tumbling at regular intervals, much to the delight of a vociferous capacity crowd. Andrew Hall (32), Ashley Prince (30) and Shaun Pollock (29) managed to get the starts but could not really make it count. 

Sehwag opened with a punishing cover drive off-spinner Johan Botha. The savageness of his shot was such that captain Graeme Smith immediately took the bowler of the attack. Smith had seen the omen but he could do little to change the course of the match. 

What set Sehwags innings on Saturday from his previous ones was his determination to make his good start count. After adding 53 runs with Pathan, he stitched another 50 runs with his skipper Rahul Dravid (10). 

Sehwag slammed two fours off part-time bowler Justin Ontong to hasten the finish and Yuvraj Singh, centurion in Hyderabad, drove the slow bowler to cover fence for the winning hit. 

Earlier, some gutsy batting from Gambhir and Pathan helped India counter the aggressive new ball spell from the South African fast bowlers. Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini bowled as many as three maiden overs on the trot as they stoutly defended their meagre target. 

Sachin Tendulkar (2) tried to break the shackles but mistimed an on-drive for a catch to substitute Robin Peterson at mid on off Pollock. 

South Africa, once asked to bat, didnt recover from Pathans early blows. 

The Baroda left-arm paceman ensured he made amends for his dismal performance in Hyderabad when he dismissed AB de Villiers (4) in his first over. Then he took the vital wicket of Smith off the first ball of the fifth over, the skipper being trapped plumb leg before for 3. Jacques Kallis edged another delivery to be caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Yardstick must be same for all, including Sachin

 - India won't get away with poor starts in Pakistan as they did versus US

Straight Talk

 Yuvraj seems to have made the transition to an established batsman

Good as Indian spinners are, they appear better on their pitches. It has to do with the balls used in home matches as well as the pitches which are not rolled out hard and thus tend to play a bit up and down progressively. 

If you win the toss, you avoid batting last which is a major advantage. It makes me wonder if teams really have ever opted to bat second in India in Tests. If they have, the number must be very small. 

Local balls, too, were an issue. It has a pronounced seam and Indian spinners, who hit the deck hard, get a lot out of it by way of bounce. 

If you look in recent years, men such as Saqlain Mushtaq and John Emburey, or Tauseef Ahmed in the past, have tended to do better in India. It is a quality which Muralidharan does not have. 

He relies on revolutions imparted to the ball, degrees of spin and variation. Whenever he tossed the ball up, the Indians were willing to come down the track. You could not do it against Harbhajan and Kumble. 

Just for arguments sake, it would be interesting to see how Indian batsmen would stack up against Harbhajan and Kumble on a wearing home pitch. Not many batsmen in world cricket would back themselves against these two spinners in such conditions. 

Be that as it may, Indians still were clearly the better side. They have begun to rely on cricketers with multi-dimensional ability. Batsmen can bowl when required and bowlers can bat. Such teams are difficult to beat, and certainly not by somebody like Sri Lanka who were relying on a couple of batsmen and an extraordinary spinner. 

There was sufficient exhibition of class from Maravan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene in the series, but neither went on to produce something substantial. That was criminal. 

The Indians, on the other hand, were able to come out of two tight spots while batting. It was the lower order which bailed them out on both occasions. Yuvraj Singh is proving to be a credible influence in the middle order and Irfan Pathan, too, has come up by leaps and bounds. 

Despite a century each from Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman in the series, Indias top order looks rusty and out of form. The enigma called Virender Sehwag has not fired either. 

India could get away despite poor starts against Sri Lanka because the latter lacked the firepower to deliver the killer punch. It would not be the case in Pakistan where their frontline bowlers would keep coming in at the Indian batsmen. 

In this hour of victory, Indians would do well to keep a constant vigil on their Test squad. This mix can do with a bit of dash of youth. Frankly, Indians need two young batsmen who can challenge the established lot. Yuvraj has made the transition successfully, or so it seems, and Mohammed Kaif must also now do the same. 

The likes of V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav Ganguly must look to command their place by virtue of performance and not past glory. 

Call it blasphemy or anything you like, it should be the same for Sachin Tendulkar. They must not give the impression they are trying to build scores for themselves and not for the team. 

If they continue to do so without being checked, it would appear that the Indians are adopting different yardsticks in their approach to one-day and Test cricket. It would be the right message we would like to hear. Thumb rules must apply to everyone.

 Montgomerie clinches crown

St Andrews: Colin Montgomerie came from five strokes behind to win the Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday by a stroke, his first victory in 19 months. 

Montgomeries one-under-par 71 in an error-strewn final round, for a nine-under-par 279 total, left him a shot better than overnight leader Kenneth Ferrie, who crashed to a 77. 

An $800,000 first prize took Montgomerie within $200,000 of Europes money list leader, US Open champion Michael Campbell, as the Scot continues his quest for an eighth Order of Merit. 

The 662,415 points for his first win since last years Singapore Masters also took the 42-year-old to the top of Europes Ryder Cup table. 

This was a long time coming and you dont know if the next wins going to come, said a smiling Montgomerie. 

I was looking forward to coming back here after the (British) Open and its good to come out on top this time. 

But it was as much a story of Ferries collapse as Montgomeries determination.

 Kim pulls off a major surprise

Cherry Hills Village (Colorado): Birdie Kim became the second South Korean to win the womens US Open when she triumphed by two shots after a spectacular finale at Cherry Hills Country Club on Sunday. 

It needed something special to clinch the third womens major of the year, and the little-known 23-year-old pulled it off. 

At the treacherous par-four 459-yard last, which had yielded only three birdies in the tournament, Kim holed out from a greenside bunker for a three, a round of one-over-par 72 and a three-over 287 total that earned her $560,000. 

Two American teenaged amateurs ? 17-year-old Morgan Pressel and 19-year-old Brittany Lang ? shared second place. Lang closed with a 71 early on while Pressel needed a birdie at the last to tie with Kim but dropped a shot for a 75. 

The South Korean played as Ju-Yun in her rookie year in 2004 before changing her name at the start of this season. She struggles with her English but managed to tell newsmen: This week was great fun, very exciting. 

Asked why she changed her name, she replied: There are a lot of Kims on Tour and I wanted something simple and that people would remember.

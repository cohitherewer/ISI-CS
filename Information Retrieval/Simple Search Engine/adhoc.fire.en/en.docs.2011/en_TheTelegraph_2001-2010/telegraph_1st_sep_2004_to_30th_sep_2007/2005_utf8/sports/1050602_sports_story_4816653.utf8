 Miandad joins suspend Bangladesh chorus

 Miandad wants a promotion-relegation system 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad is the latest to call for Bangladesh to be suspended from Tests until they improve. 

It is obvious now that Bangladesh cricket is going nowhere and the ICC, instead of refusing to review their Test status, should look at ways to help them raise their standards, Miandad said on Wednesday. 

Former Australian great Richie Benaud and champion leg-spinner Shane Warne also said recently that the Test minnows dont deserve Test status. 

Bangladesh lost by an innings and 261 runs to England at Lords last week. In 37 Tests so far, they have won just one game against a depleted Zimbabwe side last year. The second Test against England starts in Durham on Friday. 

I am not against weaker cricket nations like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. But when the ICC could suspend the Test-playing rights of Zimbabwe last year because they were weakened by the players boycott, why cant they do the same for Bangladesh because of their poor performances, Miandad said. 

I would suggest the ICC introduce a promotion and relegation system in international cricket and revise its future tours programme, said Miandad, who scored 8,832 runs in 124 Tests. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 TTFI stubs BTTA out of tournament

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) Monday made it clear that Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA) will have no role to play in the Asia Cup to be held in the city in September. 

An ad-hoc committee will be formed, with people from Bengal, to conduct the tournament. The BTTA is a disaffiliated unit and hence has no authority to play any role, Mool Chand Chouhan, the TTFI president, told The Telegraph from New Delhi. 

The national body had set July 31 as the deadline for the BTTA to withdraw a case in a city civil court, challenging the TTFIs constitution amended in 1988. That has not happened. 

Unfortunately the judge was absent for the past few days where the case was to come up for hearing, explained a senior BTTA functionary, who hoped the matter will be sorted out with help from Somnath Chatterjee, who was acting as the mediator between the two warring bodies. 

They could have informed the court that the case has been withdrawn and that would have settled matters, countered Chouhan. 

Chouhan, however, confirmed that although Bangalore was thought of as an alternative venue, Calcutta was always the top priority.

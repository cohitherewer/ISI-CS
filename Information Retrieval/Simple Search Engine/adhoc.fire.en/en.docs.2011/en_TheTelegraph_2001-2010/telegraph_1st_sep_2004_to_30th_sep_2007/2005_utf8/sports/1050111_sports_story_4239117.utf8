The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Reconvening AGM first priority, says Dalmiya

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Relieved at the Supreme Court verdict, Jagmohan Dalmiya stated on Monday that the postponed annual general meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should be held in the next 10 to 12 days and will most likely take place in Calcutta. Till then, Dalmiya said that he would continue as the BCCI president. 

According to Dalmiya, his first priority would be to re-convene the postponed AGM, so that the newly elected office-bearers and president Ranbir Singh Mahendra could start functioning and all proceedings could be concluded. Once the AGM is held, Dalmiya told reporters, he can get out of ?the uncomfortable position I have held for the last 100 days.? 

He also added that contentious issues like awarding of TV rights would be taken later by the BCCI working committee. He, however, pointed out that the fixtures committee is likely to meet within a week, to decide on venues for the Test series and one dayers against Pakistan. 

Reacting to the Supreme Court?s verdict, Dalmiya said he was relieved that one decision (Mahendra?s election as president) was taken and the other (his nomination as patron-in-chief) was left to the Madras High Court. 

?It shows that the judiciary in this country is existing and vibrant. The truth always prevails,? Dalmiya said. ?The point that has been established is that the my ruling as the chairman of the AGM was right, the casting vote was right, the conduct of the elections was right.? 

About the second fund-raiser between the Asia XI and ICC XI, Dalmiya said: ?The chiefs of Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh boards have expressed their desire that the match be played in Calcutta. However, the ICC wants it to be played in a country where there is total tax exemption.?

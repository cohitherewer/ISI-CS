The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bacher slips into new role tomorrow

 - South Africa cricket supremo expected to watch Calcutta ODI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: Dr Ali Bacher, arguably South African crickets most influential individual, will begin taking guard in his new avatar ? that of a South African Rugby Union (SARU) board member ? on Monday. 

Thats when he meets the sports main sponsor, petroleum major Sasol, as also co-lead sponsors Vodacom, ABSA and Canterbury. While ABSA has recently been bought over by Barclays, Canterbury is a top clothing manufacturer. Vodacom needs no introduction. 

The interaction, in Johannesburg, is going to set the agenda that Dr Bacher will place before the board on December 2 ? his debut meeting. 

Dr Bacher, it may be recalled, has been nominated by the sponsors. Their agreement with SARU always had a provision for representation, but they chose to exercise it for the first time as recently as last month. 

For now, the former captain and cricket board managing directors appointment is till the end of 2006. The board has eight members. 

Im excited... Ive got some ideas and theyre going to be shared with my colleagues on the board, the Johannesburg-based Dr Bacher told The Telegraph, when reached for a comment on his cellphone. 

Given Dr Bachers expertise ? he was also executive director of the 2003 cricket World Cup ? its unlikely that his role will be limited to safeguarding the sponsors interests. 

Incidentally, he remains a consultant for electronic display systems major Stellavista. Besides the Chinnaswamy here, the firm has installed replay screens in Hyderabad, Calcutta and Mumbai. Negotiations are on for the Kotla, too. 

Owing to a tight schedule, Dr Bacher is only expected to watch the India-South Africa ODIs in Calcutta and Mumbai.

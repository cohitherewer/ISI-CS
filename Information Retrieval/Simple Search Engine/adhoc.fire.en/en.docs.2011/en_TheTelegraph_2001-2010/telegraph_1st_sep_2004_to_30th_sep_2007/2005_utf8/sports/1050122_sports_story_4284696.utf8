 India squad by Feb. 21

Chennai: The Indian team for the Tests vs Pakistan will be selected by February 21, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said Friday. 

?The domestic tournaments are in full bloom and the selectors will witness all the three (Duleep Trophy, Challenger and Deodhar) games before meeting to select the team for the Tests,? Nair said over phone from Thiruvanathapuram. 

Nair said players like Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan and Sachin Tendulkar will feature in the domestic matches. ?All these three and other Indian seniors will be seen in action in the Deodhar Trophy, Duleep Trophy and Challenger series matches,? he said. 

He said the board has informed the Union government on the choice of venues and is waiting for ?concurrence? with the government and information from the PCB before finalising all.

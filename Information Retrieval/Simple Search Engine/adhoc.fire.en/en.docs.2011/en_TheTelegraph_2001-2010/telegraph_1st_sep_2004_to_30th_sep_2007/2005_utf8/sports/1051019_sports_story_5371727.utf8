 Confident WI leave for Australia

 - We just have to go there and tame them: King 

 Bennett King says all the players are comfortable 

Bridgetown: West Indies coach Bennett King expressed surprising confidence ahead of his squads tour of Australia, but said beating the worlds No. 1 cricket team on its home turf wont be easy. 

The Australians are very good and we are going into their den. We just have to go there and tame them, King said before most of the team departed Barbados for Sydney. I believe everyone is comfortable. 

The West Indies havent won a Test series of any significance since India visited the caribbean three years ago, and they havent had the measure of the Aussies in a series since 1993. 

The Australians, coming off a sweep of a World XI including West Indies stars Brian Lara and Chris Gayle, have held the Frank Worrell Trophy for 10 years. 

The West Indies will play Queensland in a four-day match from October 27, followed by three Tests in Brisbane, Hobart and Adelaide. 

The squad will be at full strength despite the bitter ongoing contracts dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and players association which led to a second-string side touring Sri Lanka in july. 

Australia-born King said the team has put the dispute behind it and was looking forward to competing. 

The camaraderie is there and we just have to keep moving forward and playing together as a unit, he said.

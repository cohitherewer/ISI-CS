The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 City to host second ODI versus SA

 - BCCI announces dates, venues for home series 

Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the dates and venues of Indias one-day Internationals against Sri Lanka and South Africa to be held in October-November. 

India will host Sri Lanka for a seven-match one-day International series between October 25 and November 12 while the South Africans will play a five-match series from November 16 to 28. 

The Lankans will play their matches on October 25, 28, 31, November 3, 6, 9 and 12 in Mohali, Nagpur, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Jaipur or Jodhpur, Rajkot and Pune, the BCCIs Tours and Fixtures committee decided on Tuesday. 

The South Africans will open their series on November 16, followed by matches on November 19, 22, 25 and 28 in Chennai, Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad, respectively. 

The venue for each match would be decided in consultation with their respective boards, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said. 

Nair said Ahmedabad had been allotted another ODI match for not being able to stage a Test match after Pakistan refused to play there early this year. 

Hyderabad had been allotted one match because Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association said they were still not ready to stage an ODI, he said. 

The match will be played at a new stadium in Hyderabad, he added. 

Nair said the details of both the series would be decided as per the logistics. Whether the matches would be day/night would be decided with consultations with other associations, he said. 

Nair said the meeting was chaired by BCCI vice-president Kamal Morarka and was attended by all the members barring the Boards treasurer Jyoti Bajpai. 

The persons who attended the meeting were: Morarka, Nair (convenor), Boards joint secretary Goutam Das Gupta and regional representatives M. P. Pandove (Punjab representing north zone), Dayanand Narvekar (Goa representing south), Bikas Barua (Assam representing east), Hitesh Patel (Gujarat representing west) and Prakash Dixit (Vidarbha representing central). 

Regarding Goa, Nair said a special committee had been formed to look into its case and no match could be allotted to it unless the committee gives a decision. 

Goa last hosted an ODI between India and Australia in the 2001 series which was marred by police resorting to lathi charge after thousands of unauthorised persons gained entry into the stadium at the cost of genuine ticket holders.

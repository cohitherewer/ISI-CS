The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Trescothick?s million-dollar question

London: England vice-captain Marcus Trescothick insisted the side would be fully fit and mentally fresh to take on the Australians. 

England have lost the last eight Ashes campaigns, but their recent 2-1 Test series win in South Africa followed by series victories against West Indies (home and away) and New Zealand have given them a new found hope of toppling the world champions. 

However, they will have to raise their game a few notches against Ricky Ponting?s all-conquering team. As Somerset opening batsman Trescothick said on Wednesday: ?We?ve beaten South Africa but how much we have to improve before we face Australia is the million-dollar question. 

?We have some time off now to reflect, to improve, get fit and begin work for the summer. We?ll be in good shape and ready by the time the series begins.? 

Tournament hosts England beat Australia in September?s Champions Trophy semi-final before losing the Oval climax to the West Indies. In South Africa, England lost the one-day series 1-4 with the top order, in particular, struggling.

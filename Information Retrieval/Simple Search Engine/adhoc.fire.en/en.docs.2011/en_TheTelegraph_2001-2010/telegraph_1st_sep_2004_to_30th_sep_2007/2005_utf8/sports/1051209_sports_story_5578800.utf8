The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jhulans heart still beats for Calcutta

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indian lady cricketers ? Jhulan Goswami and Rumeli Dhar ? who are originally from Bengal but had to shift their base to Delhi in search of employment will not mind coming back to their own state if they are provided with proper jobs. 

I didnt get job here and when Air India offered me a job on contractual basis, I had to accept that, Jhulan told The Telegraph at a city hotel on Thursday. 

Rumelis story is a bit different but she will also not mind if offered something better. 

Eastern Railway was ready to give me a job of class IV category while Northern Railway came up with an offer of a class III job with 17 immediate increments and so I didnt have a choice, Rumeli said. 

Both the girls who have made their presence felt in the national squad, still have a lot of feeling for place where they were born. I want to perform well, which will make my locality (Chakdah) happy. They become very proud of me whenever I do something noteworthy, Jhulan stated. 

On the contrary, Rumeli has no idea whats happening in the Bengal cricket though she almost visits Bengal. I have been staying in Delhi for last two-and-half years and it is not possible for me keep tab about the womens cricket in Bengal, she remarked.

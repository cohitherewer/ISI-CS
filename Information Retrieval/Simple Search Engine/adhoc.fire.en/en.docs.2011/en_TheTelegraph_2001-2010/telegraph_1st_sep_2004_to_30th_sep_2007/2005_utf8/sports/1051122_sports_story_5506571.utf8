The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Never thought Id play 357 ODIs

 - Its an achievement to have come thus far, says Sachin 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar didnt know he was on the threshold of a world record until he saw it appear on the giant screen at the Chinnaswamy Stadium during the second one-dayer in Bangalore. The maestro had equalled Wasim Akrams 356 appearances there and will add another feather to his cap once he walks out on the field at the Chepauk on Tuesday ? weather permitting. 

Obviously I am happy? 357 is not something which I thought of when I started. In fact, I never thought I would play so many, Sachin told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

Cricket means a lot in my life. Its been an inspiration? I think its an achievement to have come thus far, he added. 

He did not wish to pinpoint anything as special during his career, though he did admit that there have been quite a few highs. The centuries in Sharjah during April 1998, for one, will remain special. 

Greg Chappell, too, saluted Sachin. Hes a champion? I only marvel at the facts. His attitude has remained the same since he started. Hes always enthusiastic and works as hard as the junior-most member in the side, the coach explained. 

He brushed aside talks of the Master Blaster being out of form. Its not a concern to me, Chappell said. 

 The other day someone talked about Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag being out of form. They are back among runs. I can only say good players dont lose talent overnight. Sachins importance to the team far outweighs what he does with the bat. 

Rahul Dravid was also forthcoming. It will be great to have an Indian playing the maximum number of ODIs and there is none better than Sachin who fits the bill, the captain remarked. 

Dravid did not wish to reveal if the team was planning something special for Sachin. Let that remain within the players, he remarked. 

South African captain Graeme Smith was candid as well. Its very difficult to say anything? To play 350-plus ODIs is massive. I cant even think about it. 

Chepauk has been a happy hunting ground for Sachin and the city is keeping fingers crossed.

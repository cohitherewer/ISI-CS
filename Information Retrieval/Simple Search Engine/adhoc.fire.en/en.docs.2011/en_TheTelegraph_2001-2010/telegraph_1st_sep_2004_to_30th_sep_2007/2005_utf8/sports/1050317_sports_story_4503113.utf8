 Sehwag: That 309 is only a part of my record, nothing more

 - ?I handle pressure by not taking any of it on my shoulders?

It?s hardly a secret that Virender Sehwag (or apna Veeru) has, for almost three years since he took to opening, changed the complexion of the Team India batting ? thanks to his scorching pace. Sehwag, who has started the latest Indo-Pak series with a rousing 173 in Mohali, spoke to The Telegraph for around 45 minutes in the lead-up to the Eden Test. 

The following are excerpts 

Q You?ve begun the series with a bang. Has that 

taken much of the customary pressure off you? 

A The performance in the first Test of any 

series does matter as it sets the tempo for the matches to follow? Moreover, a 

good start helps you stay relaxed: The pressure of having to deliver in the very 

next outing isn?t there. Also, aap apne se upset nahin rahte ho. 

[Sehwag, incidentally, scored a fine 81 at the Eden 

on Wednesday.] 

Even otherwise, after that 309 in Multan, you?ve 

begun this series with a psychological edge over Pakistan? 

Not really, because the past is history? It?s best 

to forget what has gone and look to making the most of a new series. Today, that 

309 is only a part of my record, nothing more. Of course, I?m proud to have got 

a triple. 

How do you handle pressure? 

By not taking any of it on my shoulders? Jitna 

jyada aap socho ge, utna jyada presure ho ga. 

After an excellent series in Pakistan, though, 

you didn?t do too well in successive one-day tournaments, at the start of this 

season. Why? 

Aren?t low scores inevitable at some point in a batsman?s 

career? I had no choice but to accept that even I would go through such a phase? 

Thankfully, Sourav Ganguly and John Wright continued to back me and my confidence 

didn?t plummet? I knew one innings could end the drought? That I just needed to 

spend time at the wicket? (After a pause) I didn?t, however, allow the 

lack of runs to dent my self-belief. 

What did you learn in that period? 

That I must make the most of every opportunity when 

the going is good? Those runs come in ?handy? when the going isn?t good? 

Did that July-September drought make you more 

determined when Australia arrived in India? 

I?m always hungry, always determined? It?s a fact 

that I didn?t fare well in the lead-up to that Test series (against Australia), 

but that wasn?t because of a lack of effort? I did want to score big in every 

match, yet that didn?t happen. Meri koshish mein koi kami nahin thi? 

For somebody out of form, you were superb versus 

Australia? A 42-plus average in the four Tests? 

That?s because I spent time in the middle? 

Did the criticism when you weren?t among the 

runs upset you? 

No? It?s part of the game and one should be prepared 

for that when the performance isn?t there. 

Is the motivation more when you?re up against 

Australia? 

Yes? It?s not the same as playing Zimbabwe or Bangladesh? 

Runs off the best count the most? You get recognised as a performer. 

What about Pakistan? 

The matches are fiercely competitive and, so, the 

urge to excel is there? Facing Pakistan is a challenge and I?m driven by challenges. 

Main peeche jaanewala nahin hoon. 

Almost a year on, how emotional are you about 

that 309? 

(After a pause) I guess I?ve been lucky... 

Hundreds have played for India, yet I?m the only one to go past 300... People 

have often talked about my technique and footwork, yet I?m the one with a triple? 

How many times have you thought of that innings? 

Ek baar bhi nahin... 

Why? 

Because that?s history. I like watching the recordings 

of my better innings, but don?t think of them. 

You?ve just spoken of technique... Fact is you 

have given a new dimension to opening... 

(Laughs) I?ve been batting the way I would 

in the middle-order... I haven?t changed? In other words, if a ball is there to 

be hit, you won?t find me defending. 

Whatever, but the pace you set is mind-blowing? 

It?s good for the team, isn?t it? If an individual 

can make a difference at the top of the order, then it gets tougher for the opposition. 

In any case, protecting the middle-order is part of an opener?s job. 

Have you, at any time, in the past nearly three 

years thought of returning to the middle-order? 

Look, I don?t want to disturb the team?s combination... 

Tomorrow, if the middle-order doesn?t appear that strong, I would prefer going 

back there. Right now, the personal preference bit doesn?t arise. 

Given that you didn?t begin your career as 

an opener, how long did it take you to be comfortable in Tests? 

It helped that I got 84 in the very first innings 

(as opener) ? at Lord?s, in 2002. Also, that I had already opened in ODIs enabled 

me settle down quicker. Lekin, aisa nahi ki main kabhi uncomfortable tha. 

Unusually, all eight hundreds as opener have 

been in the first innings. Do you get bored in the second? 

(Laughs again) No... The effort I put in is 

the same, but the results are different. 

That 309 apart, is there one hundred which means 

more to you? 

The one on debut (105), in Bloemfontein... Not only 

because it?s the first, but because we were 60-odd for four when I took guard... 

While your ODI debut was in April 1999, you 

became a regular two years later. What have you learnt since 2001? 

That being mentally strong is a must... Otherwise, 

the most demanding of situations can?t be overcome. 

How does this toughness come about? 

It?s driven by self-belief? I have the confidence 

to overcome any challenge. Sabhi mein hona chahiye. 

Is there a regret? 

That I haven?t got a second innings hundred! 

Today, what?s the biggest challenge: The opposition 

or the possibility of your motivation dipping? 

I?ll quit the day I lose motivation, the day my hunger 

gets less... 

Some actually sit on the wicket (for the closest 

feel) before a match, while others are fond of shadow-batting. You hardly ever 

look at the surface. Why? 

Because I don?t wish to start with a preconceived 

notion about how it may behave. I like playing ball-by-ball and having preconceived 

notions isn?t my idea of batting. Rather, what?s important is being positive. 

How do you approach a series? 

One match at a time... This ?limited? approach helps 

me concentrate better. 

Is there one bowler whom you respect more than 

the others? 

(Glenn) McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee... Shoaib 

Akhtar... (Muttiah) Muralidharan... Depending on the conditions, all can be difficult. 

Also, they offer few loose balls. 

What?s your message for young openers? 

Know your strength... Once that?s identified, you 

don?t have to be told anything by anybody as you know where you stand. Self-belief, 

too, has to be there. 

Do you have a goal? 

To play for as long as possible... Perhaps, till the 

age of 36-37? Getting X number of runs or X number of hundreds isn?t one. 

[Sehwag, by the way, turns 27 in October.] 

What?s the significance of records? 

They?re meant to be broken. I broke (V.V.S.) Laxman?s 

when I got that triple and, some day, somebody is going to break mine. It?s nice 

to possess records, but there?s no guarantee they will be with you for long. 

Being an integral part of Team India, what do 

you think has made it tick? 

The attitude and approach of the captain and coach... 

For example, Sourav has encouraged youngsters and backed them in all circumstances... 

Besides his positive outlook, that the nucleus of our team hasn?t changed is a 

huge plus... Consistency in selection helps consistent performances. 

You?ve already been a stand-in captain. Are 

you looking at the job coming your way at some point in the future? 

It can come to me once the seniors retire... Many 

aspire to be the captain, but the No. 1 seat goes to just one. Jab kabhi mauka 

mila to dekhenge. It?s only the performers who get the captaincy. 

Finally, how different is the Veeru of today 

from 1999? 

I haven?t changed, but don?t have the same freedom 

to shop as I want or tuck into North Indian khana as I wish... Those private 

moments in a public place, at least in India, have gone. It?s a bit easier for 

my wife (Arti) and I when we?re overseas.

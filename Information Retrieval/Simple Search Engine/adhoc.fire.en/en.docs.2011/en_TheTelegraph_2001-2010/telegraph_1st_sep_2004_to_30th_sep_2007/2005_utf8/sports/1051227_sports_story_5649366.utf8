Melbourne: Captain Ricky Ponting scored his sixth Test century this year and the 26th of his career in Australias 239 for eight on the first day of the second Test against South Africa on Monday. 

Ponting scored 117 and was looking to guide his side to a commanding total before South African pace bowler Andre Nel grabbed four late wickets, including two in a row, to wrest back the advantage at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). 

Mike Hussey was unbeaten on 23 while Brett Lee was trapped leg before for four in the final over of the day. Opening batsman Matthew Hayden had quietly accumulated 65 before he was caught behind off the bowling of Shaun Pollock. 

Nel finished with four for 58 while Pollock finished with three for 46 off 20 overs. 

I was disappointed and thought I let the side down early, said Nel, who had dropped Ponting on 17. It could have changed the game. I wanted to hang myself at lunch time. But I think the best way to respond to the dropped catch is to keep bowling your heart out for your country. 

I think weve got a chance. That dropped catch could have been vital... (the middle order) could have been exposed a lot earlier. But well take 230 for eight. 

Ponting has now scored 1,533 runs at an average of 69.68 this year. The record for calendar-year runs is the 1,710 scored by Viv Richards of West Indies scored in 1976. 

He and Hayden combined in a 152-run second-wicket partnership after debutant Phil Jaques was dismissed for two off Pollocks second over of the morning. 

The pair was circumspect before lunch after they had initially been under pressure from South Africas bowlers, who made the most of the moist pitch, which had delayed the start of play by 30 minutes. 

Hayden brought up his 23rd half century when he smashed a delivery from Jacques Kallis to the cover boundary though he was dismissed 10 minutes before tea when he edged Pollock to Graeme Smith at first slip. 

Brad Hodge, who scored his maiden Test double century in Perth and was making his first appearance on his home ground, received a tumultuous welcome, with many of the 71,910 crowd still standing and applauding as he reached the wicket. 

However he was well caught by Smith at slip for seven shortly after tea to leave Australia 176 for three. 

Nel then atoned for his earlier bungle, forcing Ponting to spoon a catch to Hershelle Gibbs at point for 117. He had Andrew Symonds caught by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher off the next ball. 

Adam Gilchrist survived the hattrick delivery but fell to Nel shortly after when he was caught by Gibbs for two, leaving the home side 213 for six. 

Nel also had a strong lbw appeal against Hussey turned down, though television replays suggested the ball would have hit the stumps, before he had Warne caught by Nicky Boje for nine. 

Lee was then trapped in front by Ntini on the first ball of the last over of the day, though Ponting said the total was not as bad as it appeared. 

Its going to be interesting to see how our bowlers bowl on that wicket and how their batsman bat. 

If we can get a few more runs and bowl well early, that total might look really good.

 Palm Desert (California): Michelle 

 Wie, the 16-year-old golf phenom, was disqualified from 

 her professional debut at the Samsung World Championship 

 on Sunday when LPGA rules officials determined that she 

 had taken an illegal drop during the third round at Bighorn 

 Golf Club.

 According to officials, the infraction 

 occurred on the 470-yard, par-5 seventh hole, where Wie 

 hit her approach shot into a bush to the left of the green. 

 Wie took an unplayable lie, called a one-stroke penalty 

 and took a drop that she believed, she later said, was no 

 closer to the hole, as the Rules of Golf state. She chipped 

 onto the green and made par.

 On Sunday, however, a reporter 

 approached Robert . Smith, an LPGA official, and said he 

 believed that Wie had actually dropped her ball closer to 

 the hole. When Wie completed her final round on Sunday, 

 Smith and his fellow LPGA official Jim Haley summoned Wie 

 and her caddie, Greg Johnston, and they went to the seventh 

 hole and found the divot where Wie played her shot.

 In the rain, Smith and Haley, 

 using a string to measure the distance, determined that 

 Wie had indeed dropped her ball approximately 12 to 18 inches 

 closer to the hole, a two-stroke penalty. When she signed 

 for a one-under-par 71 on Saturday, instead of a one-over 

 73, it warranted immediate disqualification. under Rule 

 6 for signing for a score lower than she actually made, 

 Smith said.

 Once we pointed it out and 

 they realised that Michelle did play from a closer spot, 

 it was fairly conclusive, said Haley.

 About 90 minutes after the end 

 of the tournament, won by Annika Sorenstam for the fifth 

 time in her career, Wie appeared for a news conference, 

 where the same cameras that had chronicled her debut captured 

 an emotional teenager trying to explain her side of the 

 story.

 I made an error; I respect 

 the rule, Wie said before describing what she, at 

 first, believed was a legal drop. I thought I wasnt 

 closer. It looked fine to me. I didnt have any question 

 in my mind. I learned a great lesson. From now on, Ill 

 call a rule official, no matter what it is, 3 inches or 

 100 yards. Its the same thing, and I respect that.

 Im pretty sad. Its 

 obviously not the way I wanted to begin, but its all 

 right. I dont feel like I cheated. I was honest out 

 there.

 Because of the disqualification, 

 Wie forfeited $53,126, which was the prize money for finishing 

 in fourth place ? 10 shots behind Sorenstam, who won her 

 eighth tournament of the year by shooting a final-round 

 3-under 69 for an 18-under 270.

 Sorenstam defeated the 19-year-old 

 rookie Paula Creamer by eight shots in a tournament delayed 

 by more than three hours because of rain and lightning in 

 the area. Wie shot a 2-over 74, which would have been good 

 for fourth place in the elite field of 20.

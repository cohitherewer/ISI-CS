 Schumacher loves a challenge

 - Formula One struggling to justify hype 

 Button was a constant threat to Ferrari in 2004 

Paris: Michael Schumacher chases an unprecedented eighth world Formula One driver?s title in 2005 but as the German whets his appetite for another slice of history, the sport he dominates is in deep crisis. 

Spiralling costs, the steady erosion of the cash cow of tobacco sponsorship as well as spectator apathy induced by the overwhelming dominance of Schumacher and his Ferrari monolith, see the sport struggling to justify its hype. 

The abject lack of competition for the 36-year-old Schumacher and his reluctant understudy Rubens Barrichello sparked a winter of bitter in-fighting. 

Teams, with the exception of the Italian giants who command a whopping $ 400m budget, agreed to limit testing as a means of trimming costs. They backed a raft of technical and sporting changes in an effort to make Formula One more pleasing on the eye as well as easier on the bank balance. 

Tired of the stranglehold of the sport?s commercial rights holders Bernie Ecclestone and the Ferrari influence, there is even still talk of a breakaway championship in 2008. 

In an effort to find common ground, the sport?s governing body, the Fia has said yes to a new qualifying format split over Saturday and Sunday, with the times aggregated, as well as introducing new rules to have one set of tyres last all weekend. There are also new restrictions on engine changes with grid penalties for those who transgress. 

All very well on paper, but is Schumacher, who has won five world titles in a row, concerned? Not in the slightest. 

?You could say there are reasons to be pessimistic, especially considering that the other teams seem to be well prepared,? said Schumacher, who will contest the first four races of the extended 19-race season in a modified version of his 2004 car. 

?It may become more difficult, but the difficult part is also what makes it fun. It?s one more reason to look forward to the new season, because I love being challenged. 

?It was unexpected for us to be much stronger than the others at the start of 2004, and whatever mistakes they made, they probably won?t repeat. At the same time, it has been very tough to get to where we are and we?d like to hold on. I believe we can.? 

All drivers have been paying attention to tyres in testing and Ferrari, shod by Bridgestone rather than rivals Michelin, believe they have the advantage. 

?McLaren and Renault are very strong at this time, and Michelin is making a good impression as well,? said Ferrari?s technical guru Ross Brawn. But of course, we know Bridgestone. They are strong fighters, we can always rely on them when it comes to it.? 

Schumacher and his rivals face a long season. 

Despite threats to the British, French and San Marino races, all three have survived while a new race is in Turkey in August. There are also new faces on the grid. 

Jaguar sold out to Red Bull, who have handed David Coulthard a lifeline after the Scot was replaced by Juan Pablo Montoya at McLaren who, in turn, have teamed the colourful Colombian with the more conservative Kimi Raikkonen. 

Eddie Jordan has handed over the reins of his team to Russian multi-millionaire Alex Shnaider. 

Jordan have pinned their slender hopes on Portuguese rookie Tiago Monteiro and Narain Karthikeyan, who brings with him huge financial backing courtesy of being India?s first Formula One driver. 

Britain?s Jenson Button, in a vastly-improved Bar-Honda, was a constant thorn in Ferrari?s side in 2004 and got used to the podium, picking up a best finish of second place in Monaco. 

However, his public flirtation with former employers Williams could backfire on him while the pressure to clinch that elusive first win will be at its fiercest. (AFP)

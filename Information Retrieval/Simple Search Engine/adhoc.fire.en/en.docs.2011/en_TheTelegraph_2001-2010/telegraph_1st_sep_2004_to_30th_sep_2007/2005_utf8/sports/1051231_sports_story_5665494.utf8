Melbourne: Australia wrapped up a 184-run victory in the second Test against South Africa on Friday when leg-spinner Stuart MacGill bowled last man Makhaya Ntini in the first over after lunch on the final day. 

Dismissed for 181 in pursuit of an improbable winning target of 366, South Africas Shaun Pollock put up stubborn resistance to stall Australias charge and the allrounder finished unbeaten on 67 after Ntini was removed for two. 

The win gives Australia a 1-0 lead in the three-match series and any chance the tourists had of saving the Test were dashed on Thursday when they were reduced to 99 for six by the close of play. 

Mike Hussey was named Man-of-the-Match after he scored 122 in Australias first innings and combined with Glenn McGrath in an 107-run 10th wicket partnership that pushed the world champions to 355 on their first innings. 

Mike Hussey and Glenn McGraths partnership on Day II has been the defining moment of the Test match, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. 

Those extra 100 runs were vital for us and gave us a first innings total that South Africa would have to bat very well to dominate the Test match from that moment on. 

The Australians then bowled South Africa out for 311, giving them a 44-run lead before Matthew Hayden (137) and Andrew Symonds (72) combined for a brutal 124-run partnership in 66 minutes after lunch on Thursday that gave their side the necessary impetus to declare at 321 for seven. 

Whats disappointing is that we had opportunities to win the game, South Africa captain Graeme Smith said. 

Our missed opportunities probably cost us the game. The middle of the game could have been so different. We could have had a lead. 

But their batsmen made the most of their opportunities and credit to them. It took nine days of Test cricket for someone to really win a day. And that was Thursday, which Australia won, said Smith. 

South Africa made a cautious start to their second innings and after reaching 39 without loss, the tourists lost six wickets for 43 runs to leave themselves an almost impossible task of surviving the entire final day with just four wickets intact. 

However, the home sides hopes of wrapping up the win before the interval on Friday were thwarted by Pollock, who combined aggression with intelligent stroke play to reach the lunch break on 66 not out, with his side on 180 for nine. 

Leading the attack, Shane Warne had figures of 4/74 and McGrath 3/44 as the pair combined to take the three wickets to fall in the morning. 

Ashwell Prince, who had resumed on 16, was the junior partner in a 48-run partnership with Pollock before he was adjudged to have been caught by Matthew Hayden off Warne for 26. 

Television replays, however, appeared to show the ball had bounced off his arm and was nowhere near his glove or bat when it ballooned away in front of Hayden who had to dive to catch it. 

Nicky Boje also did his best to ensure the game did not end early on Friday with a watchful 13 off 38 balls before he played back to a McGrath delivery and chopped the ball onto his stumps to leave the visitors 166 for eight. 

Andre Nel was the next man to go when he chased a wide delivery from McGrath and edged an easy catch to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist for two. 

Nel, whose competitive nature has made him both a crowd favourite and hate figure, was visibly angry with himself as he walked off. 

The first Test in Perth ended in a draw and the third and final Test starts in Sydney on Monday.

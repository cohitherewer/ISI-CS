 Atwal: My mind is stronger now

 Atwal still waiting for that Tour win 

New Delhi: Now that Indias first USPGA player Arjun Atwal has made his presence felt among the top five tournament finishers and now that he has ?no pressure of trying to keep my card, I can go and try and win a tournament?. 

?My mind has become a little bit stronger,? Atwal said over telephone from Charlotte, North Carolina, where he is competing in this weeks Wachovia Championship. 

The Calcutta-born 32-year-old pro had set himself two targets for his second season on the Tour (as has already been exclusively reported by The Telegraph) ? the retention of his Tour card and wining a tournament. He has come within a whisker of doing that twice this year. 

?Im more mature and better equipped to handle courses than I was two years ago.I play a lot smarter now and dont attack like I used to, especially on the PGA Tour where we have such tough pin positions.? 

After competing in just five events but making the cut in all five, he lies 47th on the US money list with earnings of $623,248. (Reuters)

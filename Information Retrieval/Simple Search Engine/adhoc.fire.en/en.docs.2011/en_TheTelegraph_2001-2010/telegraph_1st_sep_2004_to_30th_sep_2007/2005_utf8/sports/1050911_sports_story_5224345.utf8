 Scorpion lifts English Leger 

World Cup stakes hiked 

 London: Scorpion justified favouritism under Frankie Dettori in the Ladbrokes St Leger at a packed Doncaster on Saturday.

 The Aidan Brien-trained colt was sent off the 10-11 market leader and scored a one-length success over The Geezer (7-2) in the final Classic of the season. Tawqeet (11-1) was third.

 Dettori had his mount settled in front after a quick break from the stalls and he set a moderate pace through the early stages of the extended one-mile-six-furlong showpiece. The Italian started to up the gallop just before entering the home straight and really kicked on in the last four furlongs. (Agencies)

Calcutta: It?s now or never for Mohun Bagan. Under the threat of relegation in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup, they face a must-win situation against Tollygunge Agragami on Thursday. 

Mohun Bagan have 19 points from 20 matches and will need to win their remaining two matches. Even a draw could spell disaster for the green-and-maroon brigade. 

While the Maidan is agog with rumours that Tollygunge will surrender the initiative, but club supremo Mantoo Ghosh said: ?Rumours will remain rumours. All I know is that as per the schedule, we are playing Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium.? 

He, however, hastened to add that the team was facing problems because of injuries to few of their key players ? Suman Dutta, Gouranga Dutta, Surajit Bose and Saumik Dey. Goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh is also unwell and may not take the field. 

However, according to a club source, all five may take the field Thursday. 

Tollygunge have 17 points in 20 games and a point against Bagan might keep their faint chances of survival alive. 

Mohun Bagan supporters spared no efforts to enliven the spirits of the players on Wednesday morning. Officials from rival camps in the faction-driven club were also present. There was pep-talk for the players from both secretary Anjan Mitra and assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury, at different times and setting, though. 

Also present was a Bengali musical band to add to the confidence-building measures. Former goalkeeper Debasish Mukherjee was at hand to offer some valuable tips to Subrata Pal. 

All this prompted coach Amal Dutta to say, ?Not only during happy days, but also in times of crisis do people unite for a good cause.? 

The coach, who has promised ?an attacking display?, could not help but turn philosophical, reflecting on the times when the club has bounced back from the dead. 

?It?s virtually a semi-final for us,? said Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?. ?Only after we have crossed this hurdle can we think about the ?final?.? 

?We have to win? There?s no other way out,? said Noel Wilson. 

Tollygunge coach Biswajit Das was being pragmatic. ?Against Mohun Bagan, we are always the dark horse. Going all out from the outset could spell disaster. We will be stressing on a calculative game to achieve victory.? 

That Tollygunge still have a chance arithmetically has brought about the hopes in their ranks. The coach is not paying heed to any of the rumours and is optimistic is pulling off an upset, even if that means dashing the hopes of Mohun Bagan.

 SLC cuts season short

Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has cut short its domestic season because of the tsunami disaster. 

The SLC announced that all tournaments would be abandoned after a request made by clubs affected by the tsunami. ?These clubs, which had lost players and equipment, have indicated their inability to continue playing,? an SLC media release said. 

The cricket board decided against cancelling the four-team provincial tournament, its premier first-class competition, which will now start on February 5.

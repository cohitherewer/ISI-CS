The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Change wasn?t on spur of the moment

 - LAXMAN AT NO. 5, SOURAV AT NO. 6 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar?s dismissal found V.V.S. Laxman and not Sourav Ganguly walking in. It raised eyebrows and, given that the Team India captain isn?t everybody?s favourite, the odd ?theory? began doing the rounds as well. 

Fact, however, is the batting order was changed before the third and final Test got underway. 

?That I would bat at No.6 wasn?t decided this afternoon,? Sourav told The Telegraph, adding: ?The decision was taken before this Test...? 

It wasn?t made public, though, otherwise Sourav wouldn?t have been booed by a section of the turnout which wrongly assumed he wanted to bat when there probably was less pressure. 

The switching of positions worked for Laxman (51 not out), but not for Sourav, who failed to pick Danish Kaneria?s googly. His highest in this series remains the 21 in Mohali. 

?I?m trying... I?m working hard... Yet, I?m not staying long enough to build an innings... I?m deeply disappointed,? Sourav remarked, his tone conveying the frustration.

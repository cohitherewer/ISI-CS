The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its going to be just another day in my life

 - TEAM INDIA COACH INTERVIEW - Mohinder Amarnath not short on confidence 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

New Delhi: The odds appear to be against Mohinder 

Amarnath in his quest to be the next Team India coach, but (quite remarkably) 

the 54-year-old isnt short on confidence. 

Ive been a confident person throughout 

and Im not feeling any different on the eve of the interview... I live the 

way I played my cricket and confidence has been a common thread, he told 

The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

Mohinder, who featured in 69 Tests and 85 ODIs in a career spanning two decades, is the lone Indian in the shortlist which includes Greg Chappell. The four contenders will be interviewed by the Boards six-member selection committee here on Thursday. 

Speaking a few hours before leaving Mumbai for New Delhi, Mohinder added: In fact, tomorrow is going to be just another day in my life... Im neither tense now, nor will I be during the interview... Im not, after all, appearing for an exam! 

Asked if his presentation was ready, he quipped: That Im going to present myself is good enough... Dekha jaye ga... I know Ive got the qualities to do the job. 

Mohinder, of course, has gone on record emphasising that Team India ought to be coached by an Indian and declined to comment on the fellow-contenders. 

Incidentally, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly 

are among those who have taken his tips on a personal level. Sachin did so in 

late 1996 (Durban), while Sourav sought help five years later (Ahmedabad). 

Postscript: Mohinder, as it turns out, became 

the first contender to arrive here. He will, as of now, set the interviews 

ball rolling too.

 England refuse to play Test in Karachi

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCB) hopes of reviving Karachi as a regular Test venue received a rude shock when its England counterpart (ECB) refused to play a Test this winter not due to security concerns but because they didnt want to be trapped in crossfire. 

They dont want to spend a long time in the city. They feel that while there is no direct threat to their players, yet they have concerns over the atmosphere and dont want to be caught in any crossfire, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said in Karachi after his return from London where he met ECB chairman David Morgan. 

Their main concern is that if they play a Test it would mean they would have to stay for a week in Karachi and they are not comfortable with that prospect. We have started looking at the possibility of just hosting a one-day International against them in the city, he conceded. 

England will arrive on their first tour in five years on October 25. During the two-month tour, they will play three Tests and five ODIs. 

Interestingly, on their last tour in 2000, England clinched the series in Karachi when they won the last Test in near darkness by six wickets. It was Englands first series win over Pakistan in over three decades. 

Karachi has been a contentious venue for teams in the recent past. (Agencies)

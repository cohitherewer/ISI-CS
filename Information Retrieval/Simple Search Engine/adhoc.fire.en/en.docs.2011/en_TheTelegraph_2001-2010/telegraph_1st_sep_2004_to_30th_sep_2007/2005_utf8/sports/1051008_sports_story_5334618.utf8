 Tait undergoes surgery

Melbourne: Australian pacer Shaun Tait has undergone surgery on his right shoulder and could be back in action sooner than expected, CA said on Friday. 

Tait was withdrawn from the Australian side for matches against the World XI after experiencing pain in his bowling shoulder while playing club cricket last week. 

Scans revealed torn cartilage and it was thought he would be out for at least four months, though the team doctor said recovery time could be reduced after the surgery.

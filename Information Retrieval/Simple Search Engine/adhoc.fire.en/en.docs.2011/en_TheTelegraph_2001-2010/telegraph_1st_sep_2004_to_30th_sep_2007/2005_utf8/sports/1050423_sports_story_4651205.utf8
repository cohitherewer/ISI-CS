 Galle Stadium to be rebuilt

Galle: Cricket officials in Sri Lanka have confirmed that the Galle International Stadium will be rebuilt after it was destroyed by December?s tsunami. 

The affirmation ended fears that one of the world?s most picturesque sports venues would be lost forever, mainly because of safety concerns in the event of another natural disaster. 

?We are definitely going to rebuild the stadium now and are now just waiting for the government?s approval,? ground manager Jayanda Warnaweera said on Friday. 

?There are still a lot of homeless people living here in tents and schools and it?s not fair to start reconstruction now,? he added. 

?Hopefully, we will start in about six month?s time.? 

Despite the positive news, the international future of the ground remains uncertain as officials are yet to decide whether to proceed with alternate plans for a completely new stadium just outside Galle. 

The board has identified a plot of land in a village called Habaraduwaa for a stadium that could be fully-owned. 

?We will definitely play first-class and provincial cricket in Galle now but no final decision has been made with regard to the international ground in Habaraduwaa,? Thilanga Sumathipala, the president of the currently suspended board, said.

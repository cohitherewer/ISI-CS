 WI contract dispute settled

Bridgetown: A full-strength West Indian team will tour Australia next month after the year-long contract dispute that had sidelined some players was settled on Tuesday. 

All players selected for the three-Test tour of Australia ? including star batsman Brian Lara ? will sign contracts even if endorsement and image rights are still an outstanding issue, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) said in a joint statement. 

The ICC and the international cricketers union FICA will have a maximum 10 days to negotiate the issue ? involving rival telecommunications companies ? before making a binding recommendation. 

If the ICC and FICA cannot agree, an independent mediator will be used, the statement said. (PTI)

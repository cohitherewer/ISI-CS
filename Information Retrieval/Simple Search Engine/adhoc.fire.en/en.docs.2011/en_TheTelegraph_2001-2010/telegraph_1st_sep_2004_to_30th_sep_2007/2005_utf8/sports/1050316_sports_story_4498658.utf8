 Pressure on both teams: Sourav

Calcutta: Danish Kaneria may have returned with a six-wicket haul in Mohali but Sourav Ganguly is not reading too much into his exploits. 

?He bowled very well but still went for 150 runs... He is a quality bowler. We have to play him well again. He might have got six wickets but we got runs off him too,? Sourav said on the eve of the second Test. 

The Team India captain thinks that the pressure will be equal on both the teams. ?It?s a three-Test series and we came close to winning the first. There will be pressure on both teams to win. We will try hard to win this game and I?m sure the same goes for Pakistan.? 

Pakistan?s final day showing in Mohali hasn?t been a surprise for Sourav. ?I said even before the series that Pakistan are a very good side. Young guys want to make a name for themselves and the best platform is an India-Pakistan series? I?m not surprised at the way they fought back. 

?We were in a position where we should have won. But that did not happen. All credit to the two Pakistan batsmen (Kamran Akmal and Abdul Razzaq) who saved the game.? 

Sourav felt that the toss wouldn?t be a factor in deciding the course of the match. ?It would be a factor if there is moisture. There is much heat outside, so the moisture won?t last long? The toss shouldn?t influence the outcome.? 

Asserting that he was satisfied with wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik?s performance, Sourav said, ?he conceded a few byes, but then he is aware of that.?

 Armaan dazzles in China

New Delhi: Armaan Ebrahim boosted Indian hopes in Formula BMW Asia finishing third in the eighth round in Beijing to be fourth in overall standings. 

The 16-year-old Ebrahim has now closed the gap with rookie cup leaderboard topper Charlie-ro Charlez to just five points, while fifth Michael Patrizi trailed the Indian by eight points. 

At Beijings 2.4-km Goldensport circuit Sunday, Ebrahim put up a fine effort finishing third in the championship classification braving some serious gearbox problems, J K Tyres said in a release here Monday. 

The Formula BMW Asia now moves to South Koreas Taebaek circuit for the next two rounds on August 6 and 7 where the Indian can further catch up with the leader.

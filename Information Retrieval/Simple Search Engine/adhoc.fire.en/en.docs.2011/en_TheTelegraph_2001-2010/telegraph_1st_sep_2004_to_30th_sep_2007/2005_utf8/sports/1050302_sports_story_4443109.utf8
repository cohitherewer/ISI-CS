Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya has resorted to all possible avenues to uplift the team?s sagging morale, but nothing has worked the way he wants. After seeking help from psychologist Paromita Mitra Bhowmick, Subrata sought advice India captain Sourav Ganguly the other day. 

On Wednesday, the green-and-maroon brigade will try their best to end their losing streak in the ongoing National Football League for the ONGC Cup. Just how much the players have been benefited by these novel measures will be evident when they meet Goan outfit Salgaocar at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

?Help from the psychologist along with Sourav?s pep talk have helped the boys to think in a different way and now we have no other option but to win,? assistant coach Shyamal Banerjee said after Tuesday?s morning practice. Subrata wished to stay away form the waiting scribes and deputed Banerjee to speak on his behalf. 

Mohun Bagan?s first choice custodian Subrata Pal will be back in action after completing his three-month ban following Cristiano Junior?s death in the Federation Cup final. But they will miss Noel Wilson who is still nursing a hamstring injury. But there?s good news for the Mohun Bagan camp in the return of Mehtab Hussain, who is sure take the field on Wednesday. 

According to the assistant coach, Salgaocar are a good side and they will have to raise their standard of performance to collect three points. ?We have to play according to a plan tomorrow,? he said. Mohun Bagan are on 11 points from nine matches. 

Salgaocar, on the other hand, would definitely like to take advantage of Mohun Bagan?s lean patch and look for a win. ?Our team has got back its rhythm and will play for a win,? coach Savio Medeira said. 

According to Medeira, Mohun Bagan cannot be ignored despite not playing to their potential. ?They can come back to their own form any day and it may be against us,? he warned. The Goan outfit is also struggling in the league with 11 points from 10 matches.

 Graf set for a one-off appearance

 Graf says its been a challenge to stay in shape 

Houston: Steffi Graf is returning to the tennis court for the first time in six years, but dont call it a comeback. The 22-time Grand Slam singles champion is interrupting her retirement to play with the Houston Wranglers of the World Team Tennis (WTT) pro league. 

Its hard for me to call it a comeback, Graf said in an interview. Its too early to say if there will be more. Its hard with all the schedules. If it works out, maybe there will be another one. 

This will be Grafs only match this season as a member of the Wranglers. Houston will take on the Sacramento Capitals, led by Anna Kournikova, at Houstons Westside Tennis Club. 

Much has changed in the 36-year-old Grafs life since she retired in August 1999 as the third-ranked player in the world. 

She married Andre Agassi and the couple has two children ? a boy born in 2001 and a girl in 2003. 

Time is a big factor, Graf said. For a few years, I barely played. Its not easy with my husband still on Tour. Its been a challenge to stay in shape. 

Graf, who won 107 career singles titles, said juggling the demands of motherhood and charity work made it difficult to establish a strict training regimen. 

This year I just picked up the racket more frequently than I have in the last five years, she said. 

Graf acknowledges being very nervous about the match but also excited about her return. 

Graf said the generosity that Wranglers owners Jim and Linda McIngvale have shown to her and Agassis foundations over the years was a major factor in her decision to play again. 

Graf said she has been trying to strengthen her knees and back after suffering several injuries during her playing career. 

Shes looking forward to playing in front of a crowd in the fan-friendly format of the WTT, but she cautioned against high expectations. 

How can I be the same? she said. I live a different lifestyle in general. I think they will see that Im a little more relaxed than I used to be. It will be interesting to see how its going to work out on the court. 

The WTT league is made up of 12 teams and plays a three-week season ending on July 24. The two top teams from each of two conferences advance to the finals on September 16-17 in Sacramento. (AP)

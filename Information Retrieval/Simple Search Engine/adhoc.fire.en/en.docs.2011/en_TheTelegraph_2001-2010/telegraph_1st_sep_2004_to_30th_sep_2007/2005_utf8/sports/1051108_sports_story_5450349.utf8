 England laid low by batting malady

 - Few in Vaughans team want to play with determination

 Shaun Udal may make his debut in first Test 

There is a malady running through this England side, but neither pestilence, plague nor an outbreak of peculiar moustaches among the players is causing it. Instead, it is the batting that ails them most before Saturdays first Test in Multan. 

English players are brought up on seaming pitches like the one here at the Bagh-i-Jinnah (where they are facing Pakistan A in a three-day tour match), while Pakistan batsmen are not, though you would not have guessed it given some of the crass shot selections being played on Sunday. 

Andrew Strauss, first man out after being caught at third slip for five, said: Obviously were not overly happy with our batting performance, but theres no doubt that the pitch did assist the bowlers. Its not panic stations; we just have to keep working hard. 

In the nature of 10 am starts there were some tricky balls bowled, like the corker that skittled Ashley Giles, though most batsmen were dismissed as a result of taking the wrong option. 

On a pitch that was always likely to get easier once the ball softened, doughty survival should have been favoured over carefree strokeplay. Instead, England found themselves 74 for seven at lunch on Sunday ? a biryani mostly of their own making. 

Strauss added: Weve played in conditions similar to this in England and abroad and we should be good enough to react to those conditions. 

After the heady adrenalin buzz of the Ashes, Pakistan were always going to be the morning-after hangover, a test of willpower over style. At the moment few in Vaughans team want to play their cricket with teeth and buttocks clenched, a determination which is often what it takes in this part of the world. 

If the pitch surprised them with its capriciousness, the standard of opponents, a notch up from the last match in Rawalpindi, should not have done. 

Raw talent abounds in Pakistan and now that a sorting system has been put in place by coach Bob Woolmer, the best such as the tall pace bowler Mohammed Asif, are rising to the top far quicker than in the past. 

Asif is not express, though he has bounce and accuracy, and it proved too much for most of England batsmen, who due to their almost exclusive unavailability for county cricket these days, showed precious little gumption in keeping him out. 

Unless sickness or conditions in Multan force a radical rethink later this week, we can presume this is Englands side for the opening Test. 

In which case, Shaun Udal, at just over 36 and six months old, will become Englands fourth oldest Test debutant since the Second World War, and the oldest since another spinner, John Childs, won his first cap against the West Indies in 1988 46 days shy of his 37th birthday. 

What he did that most of his colleagues did not was to apply some risk assessment as where to best score his runs. Essentially this amounted to waiting for the shorter ball and not playing extravagant drives at balls on a decent length. 

Perhaps most damning from Englands perspective were the three batsmen caught by Shahid Yousuf at third slip ? not a position where defensive edges normally end up.

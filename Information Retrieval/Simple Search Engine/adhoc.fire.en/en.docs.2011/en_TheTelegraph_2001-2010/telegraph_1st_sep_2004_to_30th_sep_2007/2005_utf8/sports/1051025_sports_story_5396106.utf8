 Hari beats womens world champion

 P. Harikrishna

Hoogeveen: World junior champion P. Harikrishna put it across womens world champion Antoaneta Stefanova of Bulgaria in the second round of the crown group of the Essent tournament here. 

With his first victory in the event, Harikrishna made sure that he will at least emerge as the joint leader after the second round, still in progress. 

Playing the black side of a Slav defence, Harikrishna faced a relatively new idea on the 13th move but Stefanova thought she had her chances. However, Harikrishna had the last laugh after the 41st move. 

Its a nice win and that it has come with black is more satisfying, said Harikrishna. 

Meanwhile in the open section, International Master-in waiting Parimarjan Negi scored over Stephen Giddins of England when the former failed to turn back to board in the middle game and was declared lost on time by the chief arbiter. 

Giddins idiosyncrasies were again to the fore when he resigned a playable position in the round three game against American Emory Tate. 

Earlier, Harikrishna started off with a hard-fought draw with Aeroflot Open winner Emil Sutovsky in the first round. 

In the Open event, Negi missed out on a winning possibility before going down to the third seed, GM Eduardas Rozentalis of Lithuania.

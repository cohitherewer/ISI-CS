 Ponting ruled out 

Wellington: A niggling leg injury has forced Ricky Ponting out of Tuesday?s fourth ODI against New Zealand . 

The Australian captain has been ordered rest owing to a slight thigh strain, but is expected to be fit for the final match on Saturday. 

Adam Gilchrist will lead the team while Queensland allrounder James Hopes will make his international debut at the expense of Brad Hogg.. 

Meanwhile, Ponting and Stephen Fleming on Monday came to the defence of Brett Lee over allegations of dangerous bowling. New Zealand coach John Bracewell had said Lee had been guilty of bowling beamers four times this season. 

Ponting insisted the beamers were accidental.

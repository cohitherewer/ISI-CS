The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Of a promotion and a demotion...

 - Former and current vice-captains come good on same day at Eden 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Shoaib Malik appears to be the dark horse for the captaincy 

Calcutta: Pakistan?s selectors stripped Yousuf Youhana of the vice-captaincy after Australia, but the demotion hasn?t hurt the low profile but effective performer?s cricket. 

Youhana got 6 and a crucial 68 in the first Test. In the second, at the Eden, he will take to Day III (Friday) unbeaten on 101. 

?I?ve always played for the team and the change in vice-captaincy hasn?t affected my commitment,? he pointed out in an interaction with the Media. 

In a remarkable coincidence, Youhana?s successor ? Younis Khan ? also registered an unbeaten century (108). 

Khan?s innings is going to do some good, yet it?s unclear whether it will really help put him in line to succeed Inzamam-ul Haq ? assuming the selectors look for a change next season. 

As of now, Inzamam should at least be captain till the May-June tour of the West Indies. 

Significantly, Khan (strongly backed by Pakistan?s most influential Khan ? Imran) admitted he was ?under pressure? going into the second Test. 

?I was under pressure as I neither batted nor fielded well in Mohali,? he confessed, adding: ?I decided to be positive and enjoy the game here? It worked.? 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, the ?dark horse? for the captaincy is actually Shoaib Malik who, incidentally, is married to a Hyderabadi. 

To start with, however, he must be the vice-captain. 

?Apparently, but for the ICC banning him from bowling, Shoaib would have got the No. 2 job for India? He?s a thinking cricketer and an asset,? informed one of the sources. 

More than one theory has been floated for Youhana?s sacking, but the move it seems was wholly driven by ?cricket logic.?

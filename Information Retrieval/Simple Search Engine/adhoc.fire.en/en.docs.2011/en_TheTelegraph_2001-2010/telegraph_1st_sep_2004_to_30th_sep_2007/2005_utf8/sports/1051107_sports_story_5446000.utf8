 Sami fit to play

Lahore: Pakistans fast bowler Mohammed Sami has shaken off a leg injury and been cleared to play in the first Test against England in Multan starting on November 12. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer confirmed on Sunday that Sami would be available for the opener of the three Test series, dispelling fears that a groin problem might rule him out of the match. 

The 24-year-old has taken 70 Test wickets and is certain to share the new ball with fellow-paceman Shoaib Akhtar, who has returned to the Pakistan side after a 10-month absence due to fitness concerns. 

Sami is clear to play the Test, which is good for us as we will be without Abdul Razzaq, Woolmer said, referring to the experienced allrounder who is recovering from an elbow problem and has been advised to rest for at least 10 days. 

Woolmer said his participation in the remaining Tests and one-day series would be decided after the initial treatment period. 

Pakistan has named a 16-man squad for the first two Tests including leg spinners Mushtaq Ahmed, Danish Kaneria and Shahid Afridi and off-spinner Arshad Khan. 

Woolmer said Pakistans preparations for the tests were on target and that both teams could feel confident heading into the series. 

People may have made England favourites for the first Test , but as far as I am concerned both sides start with an equal chance of doing well, he said.

Chennai: India played below par to go down to Germany by a solitary goal in their fourth outing at the Champions Trophy hockey tournament at Mayor Radhakrishna Stadium here on Wednesday. 

The hosts were never in the groove as the Germans pulled off the win through a Jan Marco Montag penalty corner conversion in the 16th minute. India have thus severely dented their chances of playing for a bronze medal. 

The stand-out performer for India was goalkeeper Bharat Chhetri, whose presence of mind and brilliant reflexes saved at least five certain goals. 

However, the Germans utilised their second penalty corner to take the lead as Montags shot rushed into the goalpost bisecting Chhetri and Kanwalpreet Singh. 

In the second half, the Indians were much more organised. The forwards tried out some variations while defender William Xalxo was given a chance to bolster the defence. 

The entire Indian frontline, comprising Gagan Ajit, Probhjot Singh and Tushar Khandekar, put up a miserable display as they failed to penetrate the German defence after running down on the flanks. 

The Indian defence, on the other hand, continued to come under pressure as the Germans kept up the attack, earning three off their five penalty corners in the second half. 

After saving twice in the first half, Chhetri, who was adjudged the Man-of-the-Match, brought off his third save of the day in the 37th minute, blocking Montags shot off Germanys third penalty corner. 

Two minutes later, Germans forced another penalty corner and in a variation went for an indirect hit through captain Timo Wess, but it turned out to be a damp squib. 

The Germans had their next scoring opportunity in the 63rd minute when they earned their fifth penalty corner. But yet again Chhetri stood his ground to deny Zeller from converting. 

Meanwhile, India forced their lone penalty corner of the match in the 45th minute. But Sandeep Singhs shot was saved by the goalkeeper Ulrich Bubolz. Bubolz went on to foil Indias only other scoring chance in the dying minutes. 

The hosts, with three points from their sole win against Pakistan, now face the prospect of playing for the fourth and fifth places. Australia, with 12 points, are at the top the table followed by the Netherlands (7 points from four ties). Spain are on three points and Pakistan on one point. 

In another match, riding on a 68th minute goal by Michael McCann, Olympic champions Australia defeated the Netherlands 3-2 to book a berth on Wednesday. 

With their fourth successive win in as many matches, the Australians notched up 12 points to continue to lead the table while the Dutch has seven points from two wins and a draw and are placed second. (PTI)

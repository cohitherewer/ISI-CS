 I?m still in a daze: Akmal

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Chandigarh: As Kamran Akmal stepped out of the dressing room, he was greeted by Rameez Raja. 

?Aao bhai champion, tumne sabhi dil jeet li?, was how the former Pakistan captain embraced the new hero. 

Another legend Zaheer Abbas had also congratulated the wicketkeeper-batsman during the prize distribution ceremony. The 23-year-old was still trying to come to terms with his new-found star status. 

?I don?t know how all this happened? I?m still in a daze? It will take time to settle down,? Man-of-the-Match Akmal told The Telegraph. 

Akmal?s maiden hundred in Mohali on Saturday not only saved the visitors? face, it also helped them bask in a new-found confidence. ?I think I drew a lost game? Initially the plan was to survive till lunch but then things fell into place,? he tried to explain. 

?I waited for the bad balls and there were too many on offer. Razzaq helped me a lot? The way he guided me and urged me to play it session by session. At no point did I feel I could not carry on the good work,? the boy from Lahore said. 

Inzamam-ul Haq also praised his effort. ?Akmal showed a lot of character and determination today. It was amazing. The way Akmal and Razzaq batted should do a lot of good to the morale of the side. 

?The way the lower-order has fought it out in both the innings has been excellent. The main point in today?s effort was the mental toughness showed by both Akmal and Razzaq. They inspired the whole team,? the Pakistan captain explained. 

The Indian captain was not to be left behind. ?Akmal?s was a matured knock. I?m sure this innings is going to make him a seasoned campaigner,? said Sourav. 

He did not agree that Akmal was a tailender. ?Razzaq and Akmal cannot be termed to be part of the tail. Akmal played an accomplished innings.? 

Former India wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani, who was here to watch the final day?s action, also heaped praise on Akmal. ?He?s been there for sometime. His record speaks for himself. I?ve always said wicketkeepers have to be groomed and Akmal is an example of what this can do to a player. 

?Akmal has been with the team for sometime and has seen Moin Khan from close quarters. That experience is now coming through in his style of play,? the former chairman of selection committee said. 

Kirmani also felt that both Dinesh Karthik and Mahendra Singh Dhoni should be persisted with and frequent changes won?t help. ?Dhoni has done a good job in the few chances? He?s also performed at the domestic level. He?s been through the grind.?

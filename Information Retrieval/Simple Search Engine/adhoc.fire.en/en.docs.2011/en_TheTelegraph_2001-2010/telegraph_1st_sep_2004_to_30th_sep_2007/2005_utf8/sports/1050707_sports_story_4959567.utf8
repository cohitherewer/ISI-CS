 Trafalgar Square erupts in joy

Trafalgar Square erupted in cheers as thousands gathered there to watch proceedings on giant television screens saw Jacques Rogge open the result envelope and utter the words that seemed so unlikely only a few months ago ? that the Games of the 30th Olympiad were awarded to the city of London. 

Among the special guests at the Trafalgar Square party organised by the London 2012 bid was Dame Kelly Holmes, Britains double-Olympic champion who looked even more stunned than after her come-from-behind victory in the Athens Olympics 1,500 metres race last year. 

The victory capped a year of canny and determined campaigning by the London bid team under Sebastian Coe, the two-time Olympic champion who took over from American businesswoman Barbara Cassani in May, 2004. 

Coes team was also joined in Singapore by Tony Blair, who spent two days in Singapore pressing Londons case with IOC members. 

Londons sporting ambassadors in Singapore appeared more shocked than anyone. David Beckham, the England football captain who was born and bred in the area where the Games will be centred, broke into tears at the Raffles Plaza auditorium. Alongside him, stunned by one of the biggest upsets in Olympic history, were Coe, Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bobby Charlton. 

Sir Matthew Pinsent, the rower, compared the margin of victory to that of his own final Olympic victory. It was four votes between winning and losing ? as close as our race in Athens, he said. 

London had 30 youngsters from East End schools as part of their 100-person delegation, and Coe drew the members attention to their presence as part of the campaigns stress on youth. He said: Why are so many here taking the place of politicians and businessmen? Its because we are serious about inspiring young people. Thanks to Londons mix of 200 nations they also represent the world and unites them in London and their love of sport. 

The Prime Minister invoked the words of Nelson Mandela in a televised message as part of Londons presentation. Mr Blair, who spoke in French for a third of the four-minute speech, also said he had been greatly inspired by his visit to the Athens Games last year ? and by Nelson Mandelas endorsement of the London bid. 

Each of the five cities had been given 45 minutes for a final presentation to the 115 IOC members before the vote. Paris went first, followed by New York, Moscow, London and finally Madrid. 

The Paris presentation included a film made by Luc Besson, the Hollywood director, and a keynote speech by Chirac.

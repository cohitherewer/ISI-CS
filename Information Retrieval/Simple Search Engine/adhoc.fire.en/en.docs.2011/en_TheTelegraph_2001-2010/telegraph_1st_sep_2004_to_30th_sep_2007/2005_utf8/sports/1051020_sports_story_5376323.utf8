Defending champions Dempo, however, were sent crashing by the unfancied Hindustan Aeronautic Sports Club (HASC) from Bangalore. 

Mike Okoro, returning to East Bengal after a gap of one year, along with South Africian Sidney Nkalanga set it all for East Bengal as they harassed the rival defence. 

Jatin Bist sounded the first warning early in the 4th minute as his shot hit the cross bar. Two minutes later, Air India goalie Raju made a diving ward off a Alvito DCunha shot. 

After these close shaves, the Calcutta giant took the lead in the ninth minute after Okoro send a defence spliting pass to Nkalanga who beat Raju with a deft placement. 

East Bengal kept on probing more often and increased the lead minute before the breather through substitute Dipankar Roy who shot home from close a diagonal pass from the right by Jatin Bist. 

Okoro then shut the doors for Air India when he found the net off a pass from Sidney which was initiated by Bernard Pires from the middle. 

Air India got the consolation goal few minutes before the final whistle when Syed Rahim Nabi scored a self goal while trying to clear the ball to safety off Zaheer Abbas cross from the right. 

Earlier, HASC rode a late goal by Xavier Kumar to humble Dempo 2-1 in the inaugural match. 

Sunil drew first blood for HASC in the 20th minute. Ranty Martins put Dempo on level terms. Captain Xavier struck the winner in the dying minutes to seal Dempos fate. 

In the first half, Dempo enjoyed midfield superiority over their rivals by attacking with short passes but were restricted by the stubborn rival defense, who denied space for the Nigeria duo Ranty Martins and Babatunde Badmus to score. 

However, Dempo fell in arrears in the 20th minute due to error by defender Stanley Colaco, who delayed to clear a goal-mouth lob by Zenith, Sunil however was well positioned inside the box seeing the keeper Abhijit Mondal advancing, placed the ball past keeper to his right. 

The goal did not upset Dempo as they kept on attacking and in the next minute could have equalised but HASC goalie Gumpe Rimes put up an excellent save diving to his right to ward off a Climax Lawerence header off a cross from Johny DCruz from the right. 

Dempos persistent effort bore fruit five minutes before the interval when a move by Lawerence, who laid a pass to Martins, eluded a defender and from close placed the ball to the left of Rime to have both the teams leading 1-1 at lemon break. 

After the breather Dempo continued to dictate terms but failed to score as Climax and Ranty could not find the target. HASC then came off with a fine move from the right, which turned out to be a goal. In the injury time, Sunil from the right centered the ball to Kuttymani who took a crack at the goal, which was blocked by Mondal, the rebound came to Sunil who laid a pass to Xavier who shot in. 

Gumpe Rimi was declared man-of-the-match for his excellent save in the first half.

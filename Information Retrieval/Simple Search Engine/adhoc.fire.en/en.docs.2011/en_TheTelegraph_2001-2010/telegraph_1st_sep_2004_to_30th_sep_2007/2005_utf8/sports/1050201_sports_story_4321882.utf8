 Navratilova to play doubles in Hyderabad 

 Navratilova will be visiting India for the first time 

Hyderabad: Tennis legend Martina Navratilova will take part in the doubles event of the $140,000 Hyderabad Open WTA championship beginning here on Monday. It will be her maiden appearance on Indian soil. 

?Martina has given her confirmation to participate in the event and has rescheduled her calendar for the Hyderabad Open,? Andhra Pradesh tourism minister Dr J. Geetha Reddy announced here on Monday. 

The 48-year-old has 167 WTA singles titles and 174 WTA doubles titles to her credit. However, the Czech-born American citizen is yet to decide her partner for the event. 

The confirmation from the game?s most prolific winner came after negotiations with Mahesh Bhupathi, tennis star and managing director of Globosports, the company organising the event. 

Martina has also agreed to lower her appearance money for the event, Reddy said, adding her presence will give a major boost to the event. 

When asked if Navratilova was given a wild card, Bhupathi said, ?she fits into the doubles ranking as she is active and played the previous Wimbledon and other Grand Slam events. It?s by virtue of her ranking and merit that she finds eligibility, she does not need any wild card.? 

Bhupathi, meanwhile, added that talks are on to get a few top stars for the meet.

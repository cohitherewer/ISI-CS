 Whitewash by Lanka

Colombo: Pace bowlers Dilhara Fernando and Farveez Maharoof shared six wickets on Sunday to help Sri Lanka to a six-wicket win over Bangladesh and a 3-0 sweep of the series. 

Fernando (three for 19) and Maharoof (three for 25), led the attack in the absence of their rested senior bowlers Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas. 

Bangladesh were bowled out for 108 in 38.2 overs. Sri Lanka, chasing a revised target of 106 in 46 overs, after a rain interruption, cruised to victory with 24.4 overs to spare. Opener Avishka Gunawardene scored 52 from 61 balls. 

The visitors started brightly after being asked to bat first under gloomy skies with Javed Omar and Shariar Nafees adding 47 runs at nearly a run-a-ball, but they then suffered a collapse, losing six wickets for seven runs in the space of 26 balls.

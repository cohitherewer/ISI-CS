Montreal: Ian Crocker demolished the world record to win the 100m butterfly at the World Aquatics Championships on Saturday and ruin Michael Phelpss dream of winning six gold medals. 

Crocker stormed through two laps of the Montreal pool in 50.40 seconds to wipe 0.36 off the previous mark which he set at last years US Olympic trials at Long Beach, California, and retain the world title he won at Barcelona in 2003. 

Phelps was unable to match Crockers incredible burst of speed and had to settle for second place in 51.65 while Ukraines Andriy Serdinov was third in 52.08. 

Crockers win helped erase some of the lingering pain from his gut-wrenching loss to Phelps in last years Olympic final when he led all the way but misjudged his touch on the wall, allowing Phelps to sneak through. 

It also destroyed Phelps bid to match Ian Thorpes record haul of six gold medals at a single world championship. Phelps will still leave the meet as the most decorated athlete with at least four gold medals and a silver but his modest return of two golds and a silver from his five individual events has given him real cause for concern. 

This year, this world championships has been a big wake-up call, he said. What happened here Im going to use as motivation in the coming year to get back to my best times. 

Leisel Jones collected her third gold medal on Saturday as part of the Australian team that won the womens 4x100m medley relay while her 17-year-old compatriot Danni Miatke won her first world title. 

Miatke, who left her family in Darwin three years ago to move to Melbourne in the hope of carving out a career as a professional swimmer, upstaged Swedish world record holder Anna-Karin Kammerling to win the 50m butterfly final in 26.11. 

South African sprinter Roland Schoeman, Zimbabwean backstroker Kirsty Coventry and American long-distance swimmer Kate Ziegler all won their second gold medals of the championship. 

Schoeman hauled himself off his sick bed to power his way down the pool in 21.69 to win the 50m freestyle splash and dash with the second fastest time in history, just 0.05 outside Alexander Popovs world record. 

Duje Draganja of Croatia finished second in 21.89 while Bartosz Kizierowski of Poland was third in 21.94 but neither could keep up with Schoeman, who set a world record to win the 50m butterfly earlier this week and was second in the 100m freestyle final. 

Coventry broke her own African record to add the 200m backstroke title to her earlier win in the 100m, leading all the way to reach the finish wall in 2:08.52. American Margaret Hoelzer finished second in 2:09.94 while Japans Reiko Nakamura was third in 2:10.41. 

Ziegler, 17, also produced a bold front-running display to win the 800m freestyle in 8:25.31 following her runaway victory in the 1500m won earlier this week. 

Canadas Brittany Reimer finished second in 8:27.59 while Japans Olympic champion Ai Shibata was third in 8:27.86.

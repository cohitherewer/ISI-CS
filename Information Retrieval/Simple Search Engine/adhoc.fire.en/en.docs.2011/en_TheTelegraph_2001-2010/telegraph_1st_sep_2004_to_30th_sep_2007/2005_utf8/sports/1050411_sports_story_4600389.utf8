Port-of-Spain: South Africa captain Graeme Smith led from the front with a half-century to steer his side to 182 for three on the second day of the second Test against the West Indies on Saturday. 

The Proteas made steady progress after curtailing the Caribbean innings to 347. 

Smith was unbeaten on 90 with nightwatchman Monde Zondeki on one. He faced 196 balls and hit 10 fours in a careful innings. 

Earlier, Brian Lara smashed a brilliant 196 to anchor the West Indian innings while fast bowler Makhaya Ntini took six for 95. 

The Trinidadian fell just short of what would have been his first Test double century on his home ground when he was bowled by Andre Nel for 196. 

The former captain faced 286 balls and hit 25 fours in his magnificent knock that began with the hosts in trouble on 13 for two. The West Indies resumed on 281 for six and South Africa took the second new ball almost eight overs after it was due with the third delivery of the day?s play.

Ntini claimed his fifth wicket in the fifth over of the morning when Courtney Browne edged a ball on to his thigh pad and into the hands of Jacques Rudolph at short leg. 

Browne scored 26, and his dismissal ended a 74-run stand for the seventh wicket with Lara. The innings ended when Lara pushed forward to a delivery from Nel, missed it and looked back to see the ball had clipped the top of his off-bail. 

Nel celebrated even as the crowd fell silent. 

Smith and AB de Villiers shared an enterprising opening stand of 70 for South Africa that ended when De Villiers, who scored 33, drove a ball from fast bowler Reon King uppishly to Shivnarine Chanderpaul at short extra cover. 

South Africa were 86 for two in the fifth over before tea when mediumpacer Dwayne Bravo had Jacques Rudolph caught behind by wicketkeeper Browne for eight. 

 Smith and Jacques Kallis batted conservatively together 

 in their stand that endured until the fourth ball before 

 the close when Bravo trapped Kallis in front for 39.

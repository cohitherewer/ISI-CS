The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India blank Kazakhstan 

 - FED CUP 

 Rushmi needed just 36 minutes to wrap up her match 

New Delhi: Rushmi Chakravarthi repaid the faith reposed in her with a clinical win over Ektarinia Morozova as India blanked Kazakhstan 3-0 to register their second successive win in the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania Zone Group 1 on Thursday. 

Twenty seven-year-old Rushmi, playing instead of the upcoming but off-colour Ankita Bhambri, justified her selection with a 6-0, 6-1 defeat of Morozova in a pool A match at the R K Khanna Stadium here. 

Shikha Uberoi overcame minor hiccups in the second set before coming through 6-0, 6-4 against Mariya Kovaleva to give the Indians an unbeatable 2-0 lead. 

In the doubles, Shikha paired up with Ankita to beat Kovaleva and Morozova 6-4, 6-4 and complete the whitewash. 

The hosts will now take on China on Friday to decide the winner of the pool, which will play the top team in pool B for the lone berth in the World Group II next year. 

Ankita, coming back from an injury, had looked patchy against Singapore Wednesday, forcing non-playing captain Enrico Piperno for a rethink. 

Rushmi then rose to the occasion with her second-ever singles win in Fed Cup, and her first after the earlier win on debut in a group I tie against Syria in 1994. 

Rushmi, on a roll recently that saw her reach her maiden $ 25,000 event final in Mumbai last week, needed only 36 minutes to wrap up the match with a series of accurate serves and efficient forehands. 

The 374th-ranked Indian reeled of nine games in a row before Morozova held her serve to register her first game on the board. Rushmi then nipped any hopes her rival might have nurtured of a fightback by breaking her once more to close the issue. 

Shikha hit three doubles faults to drop serve in the sixth game of the second set against Kovaleva. The 21-year-old broke back immediately and levelled the scores 4-4. 

The Kazakh girl then played a couple of fluent backhand down the line winners. But Shikha was in no mood to spend her energy, uncorking another break in the ninth before serving out the match. 

In the doubles rubber, the Kazakistan girls showed more fighting abilities as they broke the Indians twice in the match before going down. (PTI)

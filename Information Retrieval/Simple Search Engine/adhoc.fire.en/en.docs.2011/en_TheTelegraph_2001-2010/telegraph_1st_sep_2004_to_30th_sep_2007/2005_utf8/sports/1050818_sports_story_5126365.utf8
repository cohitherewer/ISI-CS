 Kevin Curran named new Zimbabwe coach 

Bulwayo: Bowling supremo Kevin Curran was confirmed Wednesday as coach of the Zimbabwe national team. 

He replaces West Indian Phil Simmons with immediate effect after a disastrous year for the team. 

Simmons had been coach since last September when he replaced Australian Geoff Marsh. 

But he came under intense local criticism in Harare after the first Test defeat by New Zealand last week, a margin of an innings and 294 runs. Zimbabwe lost 20 wickets in a day to lose in two days. 

That criticism intensified when his team suffered another innings defeat here Wednesday, thus losing the series 0-2 to the tourists. 

Zimbabwe Cricket general manager Ozias Bvute said the decision followed some serious introspection following the first Test defeat. 

We asked everyone involved with the team to be critical of their part. We expected a sea-change in the second match, said Bvute. As custodians of cricket in Zimbabwe we have to be accountable. 

Curran, 45, played in 11 ODIs for Zimbabwe and he was at one time an overseas player for Gloucestershire. He has been in charge of the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy for the last year. 

Curran said he planned to organise practice games ahead of the tri- series, which begins in Bulawayo involving Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand next Wednesday.

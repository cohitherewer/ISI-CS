 Andy Flower slams Streak return

London: Former Zimbabwe star Andy Flower has criticised Heath Streak?s decision to return to international cricket, on the grounds that nothing has changed since he led a group of rebel players against the country?s cricket authorities. 

?That Heath Streak led them into it and is now back playing is poor form. There have not been the wholesale changes they were demanding but they want to go back ? I don?t know what the reasons are,? Flower said in a cricket magazine interview. 

?But you don?t take a big stand then, when nothing changes, go back and say: ?actually, I do want a contract.? Now there are half a dozen or so young white players out of a job.? 

The former captain said he had also advised his brother Grant ? another of the rebels ? against taking the stand that has effectively ended his international career. 

?When Grant first got in touch and told me what they were planning to do, my advice was not to do it, not to have a rebel group of white cricketers giving ultimatums to the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. I told him he would not win that battle. 

?He?d either not play any more international cricket or be in a protracted battle in court. There wouldn?t be any winners,? said Flower. 

?I find it very surprising that they can return after the relationship broke down during that year-long struggle. I don?t know what the relationship between the rebels and other players is. It has to be awkward. How do you build harmony out of a situation like that?? 

Flower, Zimbabwe?s record run-scorer, has no intention of ending his international retirement, and prefers to concentrate his efforts on playing for Essex. (PTI)

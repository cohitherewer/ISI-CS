The Telegraph - Calcutta

Terry gets my vote, ahead of Lampard

- PFA PLAYER OF THE YEAR 

Guest Column

Gary Lineker

 Terry has great touch, vision and calmness

As unpopular as he may be in some quarters, Jose Mourinho 

may yet turn out to be an ?English? hero if three of the players the Chelsea manager 

has nurtured through to world-class status this season play their part in helping 

England win the World Cup next year.

While the Premiership leaders account for half of 

the six nominations for the Professional Footballers? Association?s (PFA) Player 

of the Year award, one of the aforementioned English trio is not among them, although 

had his fellow-professionals been privy to the kind of form he is threatening 

to show right through to the end of the season he might have been.

I am talking, of course, about Joe Cole. The nominations 

for the PFA award used to have to be made in January because it was judged over 

a calendar year, unlike its Football Writers? Association (FWA) counterpart that 

was voted for over a season. It probably explains the many discrepancies in the 

outcome of the two awards over the years.

The FWA still have the benefit of a later deadline, 

but it is unlikely the decision at which they arrive will be much different from 

that of the players at the end of this week, which is that the award is a straight 

fight between the Chelsea captain John Terry and his teammate and England colleague 

Frank Lampard. 

But for injury Arjen Robben might have been in there 

disputing too. As it is the Dutchman is included ? with Wayne Rooney ? among the 

six nominations for the Young Player of the Year award. Personally, I would have 

thrown young Rooney in with the big boys; after all, he?s been taking it to them 

all season.

Claudio Ranieri, the former Chelsea manager, may have 

signed Lampard ? as well as Cole ? but there is no doubt about the progress that 

all three have made under the Portuguese this season. Mourinho has done English 

football a great service but the fact that he relies on them so heavily has nothing 

to do with appeasing his public, which only makes their achievements amid a team 

of international stars all the sweeter.

 Lampard has made himself a fixture at the international 

level

One of the great things about Terry and Lampard is 

that they are leaders and such force of character shines through at international 

level. Lampard has made himself a fixture there and Terry is certain to follow 

suit. 

An outstanding servant he has been, but Sol Campbell 

may find it hard to reclaim his England place from Terry. While the Arsenal player 

may still have the advantage of pace over Terry, I think the Chelsea man?s greater 

football ability will see him keep the job for the German finals. He is more of 

a born leader and certain, I would say, to captain his country in time. Terry 

has great touch, vision and calmness and would get my vote, marginally ahead of 

Lampard. 

As well as doing their respective jobs in defence 

and midfield, both have also weighed in with goals, particularly Lampard. In fact, 

I have never seen a midfield player who wants to score as much as he does. 

What with Steven Gerrard, of Liverpool, and Andy Johnson, 

of Crystal Palace, also among the six nominees and four of the six for the Young 

Player of the Year award English too, it augurs well for the national team. It 

also gives lie to the theory put forward some years ago when foreigners were first 

flooding into our game that it would kill the national team. I maintained then, 

as I do now, that real talent will always shine.

Thierry Henry, Arsenal?s French striker, is again 

deservedly included among the nominations for the senior award, while the foreign 

contingent is completed by Petr Cech. 

It could be a mistake to discount Liverpool against 

Chelsea in their Champions League semi-final. One only has to cast one?s mind 

back to last year when the passage of the then runaway Premiership leaders Arsenal 

through to the semi-finals seemed assured. We will see then whether Liverpool 

are a worse team with Gerrard in it, as some have foolishly suggested, or, as 

I fancy, a better one with him and Xabi Alonso.

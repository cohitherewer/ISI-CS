Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick is a firm believer in ?luck factor? and has now found an inspiration in the current English Premier League leaders Chelsea. 

Like Roman Abramovich?s star-spangled side, East Bengal?s form is imperious and currently leading the National Football League table with 17 points from seven matches. But Bhowmick, with a philosophy more pragmatic than eye-catching, is not intent on reading too much into such nascent forerunning in a long gruelling competition. 

For, like Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, his focus is firmly on the title and, however, wild and weird the comparison between the two appears to be, both believe in the rationale of settling for one point instead of gunning for a win. 

No wonder, on the eve of East Bengal?s Round VIII match against a depleted Tollygunge Agragami, Bhowmick is in cautious mode and refuses to take anything for granted. 

?The supporters must understand my aim and the problems associated with it. To succeed in a competition like the NFL, you need to be patient and prepared for ups and downs. I can?t go for a win in every match for I believe in depositing points in my bank,? Bhowmick said on Monday. 

?I like Chelsea?s strategy for this matter. How ugly they look sometimes against less-fancied teams. But the fact is that they have developed a huge (Premiership) lead at the end of the day. That?s what you need? ugly and lucky, but end up with a valuable point,? he added. 

At least three Tollygunge regulars will be out of action at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. The injured goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh is set to be replaced by Sudip Sarkar, while Dinesh Swar has been ruled out with knee injury. But it is Isiaka Awoyemi?s absence (double booking) that is most worrying for coach Biswajit Das. 

?With some of my players missing the action, a draw will be my target,? Das said, despite his team?s surprise show in the competition. Tollygunge have so far gathered 10 points from seven outings. 

It seems Suley Musah too is unlikely for the match. 

Das also hints at man-marking Bhaichung Bhutia, a ?born talent? to Bhowmick. 

The East Bengal coach, though, thinks Tollygunge will be another ?tough match? after Salgaocar. 

Juliano Martins and Douglas da Silva didn?t turn up in the morning session of the match-eve practice. Alvito D?Cunha was present only to watch the proceedings go on from the bench with a muscle strain. Bhowmick, though, didn?t say a word about the team?s composition.

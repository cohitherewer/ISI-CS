 Shiv in joint lead

 - Masters of Asia meet 

Bangkok: Shiv Kapur, who has flirted with glory on more than one occasion this season, flew on the wings of eight birdies and two bogeys to take a share of the lead on the opening day of the season-ending $ 600,000 Volvo Masters of Asia here on Thursday. 

The 23-year-old Indian, who has had an amazing second half in the 2005 season, went out in two-under 34. 

With four birdies on the last five holes and negotiating on the back nine in 32, he finished at six-under 66 at the Thai Country Club on the outskirts of Bangkok. 

Kapur shares the lead with Andrew Buckle, who arrived barely 24 hours ago from the final stage from the United States Qualifying School where he missed making the card by two shots. Buckle, also a rookie like Kapur this season, carded a flawless 66. 

Thailands Prom Meesawat overshadowed Thongchai Jaidee (70) and Thaworn Wiratchant (71), and shot a five-under 67 that gave him the sole third spot. 

Defending champion Jyoti Randhawa, with two-under, was tied 13th, while Gaurav Ghei had a par 72 and in tied 30th place. 

Harmeet Kahlon finished at one-over in tied 36th place. Jeev Milkha Singh was tied 44th with a bogey-bogey finish. 

The greens were rolling a bit different today in comparison to yesterday (Pro-Am). I took a few holes to adjust to the greens. The wind dropped and there was premium on hitting the fairway, said Kapur. (PTI)

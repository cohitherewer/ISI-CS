 Vijai to auction trophy car

Los Angeles: Vijai Singh, the world number one golfer who hails from Fiji, said he will auction an automobile to benefit Asian tsunami relief, and the US PGA Tour said they would match the proceeds as the US sports world?s aid efforts continued. 

Singh, who was born in Fiji and is of Indian descent, said Friday he would use the online auction site Ebay to sell a vehicle which was part of his prize for winning last year?s Buick Open. 

He said he would donate the proceeds to Unicef?s tsunami relief effort, and the PGA Tour, whose season got underway this week with the Mercedes championships in Hawaii ? where Singh was the halfway leader ? announced they would match the donation. 

?My wife thought it was a great idea to do that, and I didn?t really need a car at this moment,? said Singh, whose wife, Ardena, is Malaysian. ?My heart is from (Asia), so I feel for the people there.? 

Formula tsunami 

Formula One team Toyota are to open their factory in Germany to the public for the first time to raise funds for the tsunami affected. ?We were really shocked by the tsunamis,? said Toyota Motorsport director John Howett, another report adds from Barcelona. (AFP)

 I want to be world?s best: Kaneria

 I have gained more confidence now, says Kaneria 

Sydney: Danish Kaneria was inspired by Shane Warne to take up leg spin bowling and now wants to better him. 

While many young spinners have been overawed by Warne?s achievements, Kaneria says his records have become a source of inspiration. 

The 23-year-old has impressed the Australians with his performances in the three-Test series, capped off by his seven wickets for 188 runs in the final Test in Sydney on Tuesday. 

?I am still learning and playing against this side has taught me a lot,? Kaneria, Pakistan?s leading wicket-taker in the series, said. 

?I have gained more confidence in myself and I will become a better bowler. I want to make my name as the world?s greatest leg spinner, that?s my aim.? 

Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said Kaneria had been outstanding. ?He?s got a lot of wickets and he?s very effective. But more importantly, he?s got a lot of courage, he tempts guys and takes them on.? 

Kaneria said he was taught at a young age never to be scared when bowling, no matter the circumstances. ?My coach told me you should not be frightened. If you are not frightened of your own bowling being hit all over the ground, then you will be normal,? he said. 

Australians admire Kaneria?s wholehearted approach to the game even if he sometimes strays from the rule book. 

He was fined and reprimanded after swearing at Australian batsmen Michael Clarke when he dismissed him on Monday but says it is all just part of the game. 

?I?m very sorry for that,? he said. ?But you see, when the bowler is trying hard and doing his best ... me and Clarke were biting and we were saying things to each other. 

?He said something to me and hit me for six and then I got him out and I was excited. I didn?t mean it but the heat of the moment got me.?

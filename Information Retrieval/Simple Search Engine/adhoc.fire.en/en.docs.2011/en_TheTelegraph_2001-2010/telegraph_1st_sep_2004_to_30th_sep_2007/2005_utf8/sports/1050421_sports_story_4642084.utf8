 Sami to undergo surgery

 Sami is expected to be fit for the tour of West Indies 

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Sami, who missed the last two one-dayers against India owing to a heel injury, would undergo an operation soon but was expected to be fit in time for the tour of the West Indies starting in May. 

Sami, who spearheaded Pakistan attack in the absence of Shoaib Akhtar, developed a corn in his right heel that forced him to skip the last two one-dayers. 

Specialists believe hard grounds and landing areas on which he has recently played and bowled were the causes for the corn that is said to be about two inches in radius. 

?I will take the specialist?s final opinion later and will make up my mind by Thursday when I should get my heel operated. I have been told that I will recover in two weeks,? Sami, who has taken 102 one-day and 58 Test wickets, said on Wednesday. 

The Pakistan team will leave for the West Indies on May 7, during which it will play three one-dayers and two Tests. 

?I might have started developing the corn on the Australian tour but I felt real pain during the second Test (in Calcutta). I managed somehow because we didn?t have the (fast) bowling attack but by the time I reached Ahmedabad (for the fourth one-dayer), it was unbearable,? Sami said. (PTI)

 Moya, Srichaphan set up Chennai Open encore

 - Top seed clinches a thriller against Garcia-Lopez; Thai makes it four-in-a-row

 Carlos Moya during his semi-final clash with Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in Chennai on Saturday 

Chennai: The packed Nungambakkam stadium heaved a huge sigh of relief as a Guillermo Garcia-Lopez forehand lodged into the net, giving Carlos Moya a thrilling 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-2) victory. 

Just about everybody involved with the $400,000 Chennai Open got the Sunday showdown they were praying for ? Moya versus Paradorn Srichaphan. They have one last wish, to see a match as rich in quality as the one these two had produced here last year. 

None of the top two seeds had an easy day in office. While No. 2 Srichaphan had to feed on the support of over 5,000 screaming fans to outwit a stubborn Tomas Zib en route to his fourth straight final, defending champion and top seed Moya was given a real run for his money by his young countryman. 

Garcia-Lopez is 21, and his handsome looks match his awesome talent. Only last year did he make a serious move up the rankings (he is now No. 128) following a first-ever Tour semi-final appearance (in the Umag meet). 

Few in this country had heard of his name, before Moya picked him as a man with a great future at Friday?s post-match press conference. How right he was! 

Wielding a huge forehand to unsettle his celebrated opponent time and again, and staying calm on the big points, Garcia-Lopez made Moya fight for every point. The top seed had to unfurl the big serves (13 aces in all) and classy winners to pull through the decisive tie-breaker. 

Capturing the first set on a nicely angled forehand winner on the run, Moya dropped serve twice to concede the second set. In the final set, the champion was up 3-1 and 15-40 on Garcia-Lopez?s serve when the young pretender turned it around with a series of well-constructed points. 

In the tie-breaker, though, Moya?s experience saw him through comfortably. 

Earlier, Srichaphan struggled for most of the marathon first set before lifting his game considerably to dump unseeded Zib 7-6 (7-5), 6-3. 

For a man who suffered first-round losses on each of his two previous Chennai visits and who won just three Tour matches (out of 11) last year, Zib had done remarkably well to advance to his maiden career semi-final this week. And, yes, he hadn?t dropped a single set before facing Srichaphan. 

It seemed that enviable record would remain intact going by the way the 28-year-old Czech played the first set. With no big weapon as such, the solid Zib stuck to the baseline as if it was his LoC and retrieved everything Srichaphan threw, moving him from one side to the other. The Thai missed a high percentage of first serves and didn?t quite relish returning loads of heavily top-spun balls. With no rhythm on his game, Srichaphan looked decidedly vulnerable. 

His serve came under siege in game 3. Srichaphan succumbed on the third break-point as Zib came up with a well-disguised crosscourt winner. The Czech, though, surrendered the advantage in the sixth game and scores were level. 

Zib had four chances to recapture control over the match in game 9. Srichaphan wriggled out of the crisis with a couple of good serves while on the two other occasions, Zib controlled the rallies only to mess up with the final shot. 

Srichaphan conceded one more break-point ? eighth of the set ? in the 11th game. Yet again, Zib didn?t have the ammunition to capitalize. 

The tie-breaker was a comedy of errors with both players contributing to the script. It was at 5-5 that Srichaphan suddenly moved up a gear or three. Seeing Zib come up for one of his rare forays, the Thai essayed a perfect lob which dipped two feet inside the baseline. Then, at set-point, came a booming ace down the middle. 

The opening set alone took an incredible hour and15 minutes, the time Srichaphan had taken to see off Kristof Vliegen in the quarter finals. 

The match changed course from that moment. Srichaphan?s serving picked up significantly and he banged aces left, right and centre (he had 12 in the match). 

Unable to make any impact on Srichaphan?s serve, Zib got frustrated and the errors crept into his game. He sliced a backhand wide and drove another backhand long to drop serve in game 5 of the second set.

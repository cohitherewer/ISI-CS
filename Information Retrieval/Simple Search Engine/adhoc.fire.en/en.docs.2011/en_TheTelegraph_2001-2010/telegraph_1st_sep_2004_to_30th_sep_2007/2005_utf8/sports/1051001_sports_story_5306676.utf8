Calcutta: Perhaps to prepare for the upcoming Federation Cup, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick wanted to test his bench strength against Eastern Railway in their final and 14th CFL Premier League match on Friday. 

In doing so, Bhowmick may have become the target of the red-and-gold fans, but in the process he found a striker in Gouranga Dutta who netted the 74th minute winner at the Salt lake Stadium on Friday. 

East Bengal had a few hiccups in overcoming a less-fancied opponent in Eastern Railway, but there was a good sign that the reserve players actually got to know where they really stand before the all-India tournaments begin. 

Mike Okoro, who played saviour in the red-and-golds last match against George Telegraph, looked out of sorts on the day. 

Okoro, marked beautifully by the railwaymen, could not capitalise on the moves initiated by either Shylo Malsawmtluanga (on the right) and Jatin Bisth (on the left). Kulothnugan was the live wire on the field and was instrumental in creating chances for the last years champions. 

Bisth and Debabrata Roy also tried their best but all went in vain owing to the forwards failures and the valiant show put up by railway goalie Tapan Karmakar. 

Karmakar had an excellent day in the office and thwarted at least three scoring chances in the first session itself. 

After the change of sides, nothing seemed to have changed for the giants and they kept on squandering chances one after the other till Gouranga supplanted Malsawmtluanga in the 61st minute. 

Within 13 minutes, Bisth initiated a good move through the right, sailing the ball inside the six-yard box where two railway defenders were foxed by a stunning header from Gouranga, which went home in a flash. Gouranga actually came from nowhere to deceive the defenders. 

Charged up by the goal, the red-and golds put more pressure on the rival defence. For the first time in the match Okoro looked dangerous when his firm right-footer from the top box was fisted out by Karmakar in an acrobatic style. 

East Bengal ended their league campaign on 34 points.

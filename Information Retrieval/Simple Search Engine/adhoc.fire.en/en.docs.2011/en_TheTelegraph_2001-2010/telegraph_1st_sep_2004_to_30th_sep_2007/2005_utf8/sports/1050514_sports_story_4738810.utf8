Calcutta: Pinky Pramanick of Eastern Railway created a meet record in the womens 400 metre hurdles on the penultimate day of the 55th state athletic meet at the synthetic tracks of the Salt lake Stadium on Friday. 

Pinky clocked 59.6 seconds to rewrite Kumkum Mondals record of 1:00.00. 

But Fridays real surprise came in the girls under-16 pentathlon event. Antara Khatun of North 24 Parganas with 3082 points not only erased her old meet record of 2712, but also erased the national mark of 3042 points by a handsome margin. 

But this will not counted as the new national record as there is no provision for dope test in the state meet. Without dope test, no record is valid, said a Amateur Athletics Association official. 

However, nine new records were rewritten on the day and one equalled. 

Rahamatulla Mollah of South 24 Parganas equalled the old meet record of Sheikh Shamsher in the 200 metres of boys under-20 category with a timing of 22.2 seconds.

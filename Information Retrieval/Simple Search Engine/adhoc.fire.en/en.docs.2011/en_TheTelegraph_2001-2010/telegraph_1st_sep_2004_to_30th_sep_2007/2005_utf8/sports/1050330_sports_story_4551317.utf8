 Shaharyar gives Kotla thumbs up

New Delhi: New Delhi?s bid to host the final match of the India-Pakistan one day International series on Tuesday got the backing of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan who said that he was expecting a thrilling contest between the arch-rivals at the Kotla on April 17. 

?Playing condition is fine here and so is the pitch. The outfield is as good as you find anywhere in the world. I am also told that some practice matches were held here. I am hoping for a good contest,? Shaharyar told reporters after his visit to the Kotla. 

With Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf scheduled to witness the match, Shaharyar, who arrived from Bangalore in the morning, assessed the arrangements in the stadium for about half an hour. 

?One point for my visit was to see what sitting arrangements have been made for our President. I saw two to three places and am quite satisfied. The final decision would be taken by the BCCI taking into account the security aspect. 

?I hope the match to be a successful one. Our President and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would be here and this is very welcoming that both the leaders will see the match,? he said. 

The BCCI pitch and ground committee chairman Venkat Sundaram also cleared a major hurdle in New Delhi hosting the sixth ODI, saying there was ?no problem? with the pitch and ground conditions. 

?As far as the pitch and the outfield is concerned there is no problem. I also don?t see any problem,? he said. (PTI)

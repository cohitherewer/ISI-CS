 Narain makes it up with Kolles

 Montreal: Indian driver Narain Karthikeyan has cleared the air with Jordan after the Formula One team expressed dissatisfaction with his recent performances. We had some differences, we sorted them out and its okay now, he said at the Canadian Grand Prix Saturday. 

Karthikeyan said he talked things over with team boss Colin Kolles, who told reporters the previous day that he was not happy with results in the last two races. 

Basically, sometimes you have off days and in Monaco I hit the wall and it was a bad weekend, said Indias first Formula One driver. In Nuerburgring I made a mistake in qualifying, and then in the race I was in front of (Portuguese teammate Tiago) Monteiro and made a mistake there too, he added. 

Formula One is a hard world and you need to learn about every situation and I think I am doing that well. The only thing I can do is keep pushing on and try to better my teammate most of the time and then we see where we go. 

Kolles dismissed any suggestion of a rift between himself and Karthikeyan, who qualified one place ahead of Monteiro for Sundays race. 

I was not happy with the results and I am not happy if the Minardi is in front of him, its normal, he said. 

But I am not unhappy with him as a person at all. I dont have to tell him anything because he knows that I like him a lot and that there is no problem. I am always talking to him. 

Tailenders Jordan have yet to score a point in seven races but plan to introduce a much improved car at the French Grand Prix next month. 

The cars hard to drive but we are just hoping and praying that the EJ15B will be a little bit better, said Karthikeyan. Minardi are closing the gap so we have to push really hard.

 Invitation may do it again 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Two horses, Al Qamar and Formal Invitation, may fight out the issue in the 2000m Governors Gold Cup, Wednesdays main event. Both are easy winners in their last starts here but trainer Vijay Singhs Formal Invitation appears to have a slight edge over his chief rival. He may do the trick again in the hands of jockey C. Alford.

 Flintoff show keeps England dreaming

 - FIFTH TEST - Visitors take 112-run first-innings lead, despite Nel?s 6/81 

 Makhaya Ntini in Centurion on Monday 

Centurion: England?s Andrew Flintoff produced an inspired allround display against South Africa to keep the rain-affected fifth and final Test alive on Monday. 

Flintoff, playing with a long-term heel injury, scored 77 and put on 141 with Graham Thorpe (86) for the fifth wicket to give his side a 112-run first-innings lead. 

He then snapped up two early second-innings wickets on the penultimate day as South Africa closed on 59 for two, still 53 runs behind. AB de Villers and Jacques Kallis remained unbeaten on 20 and 19, respectively. 

A draw looks the most likely result but England, 2-1 up in the series, could yet spring a surprise. It would require an extraordinary final day, however, for the home team to deprive the tourists of their first series win in South Africa since 1964-65. 

Earlier South African quick Andre Nel took career-best figures of six for 81 but could not stop England making 359 in their first innings. 

Michael Vaughan?s men, tottering at 29 for three on Sunday, had resumed on 114 for four still looking vulnerable, even though more than half the first three days had been lost to rain and bad light. 

Thorpe and Flintoff, however, studiously saw off penetrative first spells by fast bowlers Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock as they looked to make the game safe. 

Nel, for all his aggression, also failed to make an impression, and it was left-arm spinner Nicky Boje and captain Graeme Smith, with his part-time off-spin, who posed the greatest threat. (Reuters)

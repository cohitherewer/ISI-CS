The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im proud of the way I played

 - Ponting betters own total in calendar year 

Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he was especially proud of his 117 on the first day of the second Test against South Africa because of the bowler-friendly conditions early on. 

Ponting came in to bat in the fourth over with the ball swinging and seaming on the moist pitch. He combined with Matthew Hayden in an 152-run second-wicket partnership. 

The century was also Pontings sixth of the calendar year and took him to 1,533 runs, thus bettering his own Aussie record (1503 in 2003). When I got out there, I was surprised by the wicket. It was quite different to what it was yesterday (Sunday), said Ponting after Andre Nel took four late wickets to restrict the hosts to 239 for eight. 

It was pretty difficult to get set on. It was a bit damp this morning and we knew it would be a bit slow. It was a special innings for me. I was proud of the way I played. 

I had a bit of luck early on, obviously. I probably should have been caught at third slip on zero... but there wasnt one there. I was dropped on a pretty easy chance not long after. 

Ponting, who averages almost 70 this year, said he was more interested in the teams results than individual accolades. 

The way I play cricket is to win games and do the best for the country and the team. If I happen to be ranked number one, great. But it doesnt mean anything to me as a player. 

Nel, whose four wickets in 25 balls ripped the heart out of Australias middle order, said the whole bowling attack had contributed to his good fortune. 

The Australians like to score quickly. If we can stick to good areas, with patience and get the ball to nip around, youve always got a chance eventually, he said. I think its working for us now and were bowling well as a unit. 

The pacer added some of the banter from the 71,190 crowd had inspired him. Its my character. The more people abuse me, the more I feed off it, he said. I enjoy it. Im expecting it, so I may as well turn it into positive energy.

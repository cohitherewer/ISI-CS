The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shikhas Operation Attack

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Shikha Uberoi, the lone Indian survivor in the singles draw, will come up against top seed Anastasia Myskina in the quarter finals. 

What would her game plan be against the world No. 12? 

Simple. Just attack, attack and attack, 

Would she be under pressure, being the only Indian remaining in the singles? No extra pressure. Only pride and honour, she says. 

Does she expect the same kind of crowd as was witnessed in the Sania Mirza matches? 

I think my matches drew a lot of people too. But anyway, people here know Sania better. She has been marketed well. 

But there is a lot of talent in India which needs to be cultivated. It would be better if the media, instead of concentrating on Sania, spread it thin. I am sure Sania feels that way too. 

Shikha and sister Neha stormed into the doubles semi-finals on Thursday, brushing aside Chia-Jung Chuang and Rika Fujiwara. 

This is the first time the two sisters have made it to the last four stage of a WTA event, and they are thrilled. 

The sisters were down 1-4 in the first set. What was the turning point of the match? We started to serve better and being aggressive. That I guess did it, said Shikha. 

Any specific plans for the semi-final? We just intend to have a great time, she concluded.

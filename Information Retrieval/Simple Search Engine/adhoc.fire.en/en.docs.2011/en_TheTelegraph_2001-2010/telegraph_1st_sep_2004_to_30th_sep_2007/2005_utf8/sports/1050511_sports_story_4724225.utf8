 Sharapova advances

Rome: Top seed Maria Sharapova began her bid to claim the world No. 1 spot with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Anabel Medina Garrigues at the Rome Masters on Tuesday. 

Her win came on a mixed day for the Russian contingent. Fifth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova slumped 2-6, 4-6 to Argentinas Paola Suarez and No. 11 Elena Likhovtseva lost 1-6, 3-6 to Israels Anna Smashnova. 

Sharapova will replace Lindsay Davenport at the top of the rankings if she triumphs in the Italian capital this week. (REUTERS)

 Woods looks like a renaissance man

 - World No.1 stalks easy prey at St Andrews

Not even the discovery that his mother was in a London hotel opposite one of last weeks bomb sites could disrupt the imperiousness of Tiger Woods here Thursday. A reporter from across the pond watched the Old Courses nemesis of five years ago seize the lead and joked: The tournaments over before Americas woken up. 

With a father grappling with prostate cancer and a mother who found herself in a city under attack, Woods was entitled to regard the swallow that flew over his ball as he was about to thump it down the first fairway as further proof that the distractions in his life are insurmountable. 

Instead he managed a smile as the bird continued its flight path, and then set about the creatures habitat with a nature-taming round of 66 ? an improvement on his opening score here in 2000, when he finished 19 under par to win by eight strokes. 

St Andrews had only just recovered its dignity, its daunting reputation as the crusty headquarters of golf, when Woods rode up the beach on the surf of his rediscovered form. The whole day wrapped itself around him. Even the chilling two-minute silence that brought this sweeping Scottish panorama to a standstill turned out to have a Woods dimension. 

Asked where his thoughts wandered off to during the act of remembrance, the worlds No. 1 replied: I was more thankful than anything else because my mom was in the building right across the street from where the bomb blew up (he was thought to be referring to the Edgware Road explosion). I was very thankful that my mom is still here. It could very easily have been pretty tragic for me personally. 

I can only imagine what everyone else who was involved ? or lost a loved one, or had loved ones hurt ? might have been going through. 

No tearful family announcement was on the cards when Kutilda Woods decided to share her news. She told Hank Haney, her sons coach, who then mentioned it to the Opens red-hot favourite. On Wednesday. Just 24 hours before the swallow made its futile attempt to reassert natures primacy, on a course that might become to Woods what Centre Court is to Roger Federer. 

Mrs Woods was vacationing in London when the maelstrom brushed her windows. I dont know why, her son mused ? a gentle tease at Londons expense. She was kind of touring Europe before she came over here. 

Which just left the mystery of why she had kept this information to herself for so long. She doesnt tell me anything. Thats kind of how our family is, he said. If youre injured or youre hurt or youre sick or anything, you dont tell anyone. You just deal with life and move on. When my dad had cancer, he didnt say anything. When I had my knee surgery I didnt say anything. We just do that. Its one of our deals of being a Woods, I guess. 

Across St Andrews, the sense is growing that Woods is undergoing a renaissance. The first evidence was his narrow victory in the Masters. In the bounce of his stride and the gleam in his eye, you see the conviction of a player who knows the comparative barren spell of 2003-04 is behind him. 

Last season, as we know, Woods won just once on the PGA Tour and lost his position as world No. 1 after 264 consecutive weeks on the throne. There was no great emotional or psychological explanation. Swing problems took the blame. Enter, stage right, Hank Haney ? guru to Woods closest golfing friend, Mark Meara. Tiger will be a better player than he ever was in 2000 once the swing changes have become genuinely ingrained, Haney has said.

 Yusif Yakubu hattrick in 3-1 Churchill win

Margao: Yusif Yakubu?s hattrick enabled Churchill Brothers to score a 3-1 win over Sporting Clube de Goa in a National Football League match for the ONGC Cup on Wednesday. 

Sporting with a large share of exchanges, took the lead in the 25th minute. Winger Anthony Levino Pereira overlapped on the right and sent a diagonal cross inside the six-yard box to Edeh Chidi, who was well-positioned headed home. 

Churchill with snap raids found the equaliser through a penalty in the 34th minute. Sujoy Dutta accepting a pass inside the box, took a goal bound shot which hit defender Vincent Pires and referee S. Sarcar pointed to the dreaded spot. 

Yakubu made no mistake, finding the target with a low drive. 

Yakubu put Churchill in the lead soon after the interval when he headed home a well-directed centre by Roque Baretto. The ball hit the post before finding the net. 

Going all out to find the equaliser, sporting was largely denied by rival goalkeeper Marc Mascarenhas who came in place of injured Vinay Singh in the first half. 

Mascarenhas made some brilliant saves to deny Dudu, Joseph Pereira and Biabano Fernandes. 

Yakubu then scored his hattrick, the third in the tournament, when he essayed a fierce shot off Ratan Singh?s pass to give Churchill their second victory. 

Churchill now moved to tenth place with 10 points from 11 matches. 

Sporting suffered their third defeat and remained on seventh place with 14 points from nine matches.

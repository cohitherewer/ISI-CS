The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Selectors prefer to keep quiet

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Perhaps, its to keep the Sourav Ganguly-Greg Chappell patch-up spirit alive. 

Whatever, the senior national selectors ? who met in New Delhi on Saturday ? didnt ask the Board to clarify exactly what was said by the coach during Tuesdays review panel meeting. 

Chappell, after all, is understood to have flayed them for leaking a distorted version of whats discussed behind closed doors. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the selectors didnt question Board secretary S.K. Nair, who convened the meeting where the Challenger squads were chosen. 

Kiran More and Co. should have, though.

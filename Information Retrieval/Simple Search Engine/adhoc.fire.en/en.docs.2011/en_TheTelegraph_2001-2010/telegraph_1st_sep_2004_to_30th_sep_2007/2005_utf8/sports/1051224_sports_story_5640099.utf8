 Indian eves take lead

Isfahan (Iran): Indian mens team had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Iran A in the second round of the 14th Asian Team Chess Championships here. 

Playing white on the top board, GM Krishnan Sasikiran failed to breach the solid defences of Maghami in a Nimzo Indian Defence game and signed peace in just 28 moves. 

On the second board, GM Abhijit Kunte could do little against Elshan Moradiabadi with his black pieces and after subsequent exchanges arising from a Sicilian Taimanov he too was forced to split the point after 48 moves. 

Surya Shekhar Ganguly failed to get himself rolling with white pieces against Mahjoob Morteza and had to settle for a draw after 22 moves after which all was left to Sandipan Chanda on the fourth board but he too did not succeed against Darban Moprteza in the 65-mover Sicilian game. 

The Indian eves, however, emerged sole leaders in the four-team womens championship being held simultaneously. After a 1.5-1.5 draw against formidable Vietnamese, the Indians beat Iran A by a 2.5-0.5 margin to reach four points in this section. 

Nisha Mohota scored a fine victory over Shadi Paridar, Mary Ann Gomes held higher rated Atousa Pourkashiyan while Swati Ghate had it easy against Ghader Pour Shayesthe. (PTI)

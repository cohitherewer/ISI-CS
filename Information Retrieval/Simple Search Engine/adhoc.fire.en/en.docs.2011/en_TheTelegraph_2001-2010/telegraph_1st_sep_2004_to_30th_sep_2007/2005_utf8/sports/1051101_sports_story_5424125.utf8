 Gibbs, Boje not to tour India

Johannesburg: Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje will not tour India with South Africa in November because they fear being detained by Indian police. 

Indian police want to question both men as part of their investigations into the Hansie Cronje match-fixing saga in 2000. 

Batsman Gibbs was fined and suspended by the South African board for agreeing to under-perform in a one-day International in India. 

Spinner Boje was named by Cronje in a telephone conversation with bookmakers which was recorded by Indian police. He has denied any wrongdoing. 

The South African Cricketers Association (SACA) said in a statement on Monday that no clarity could be obtained from Indian police as to what their intentions would be if Gibbs and Boje were to visit India. 

Neither player toured India 12 months ago for the same reasons. 

There has been a considerable amount of effort put into this, especially in the past few weeks, said Tony Irish, chief executive officer of SACA. 

Despite this, we are still not able to determine the intentions of the police and whether or not the safety and freedom of these players can be guaranteed. 

Its extremely unfortunate because its very clear to me that Nicky has never done anything wrong and the Indian police wont tell us what they think he may have done wrong. He also co-operated with all requirements given to us by the police prior to last years tour.

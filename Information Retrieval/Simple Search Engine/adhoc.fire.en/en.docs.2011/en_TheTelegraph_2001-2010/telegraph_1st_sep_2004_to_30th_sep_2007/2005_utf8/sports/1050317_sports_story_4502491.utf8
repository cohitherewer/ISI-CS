 Silver for Jung 

New Delhi: Samaresh Jung led India?s charge with a silver medal in the men?s air pistol event as India increased their medals tally to 19 in the Commonwealth shooting meet in Melbourne Wednesday. 

Jung scored 675.6 points (578+97.6) for his second place finish behind Michael Gault of England. 

Jaspal Rana won a bronze in the standard pistol competition even though bad weather affected Mansher Singh?s medal prospects in the trap event. Mansher, who had shot 72/75 to finish second on the first day ended sixth with a final score of 115/125. 

Rana?s score of 564 was enough for a podium finish. The gold and silver were won by Toohey Justin of Australia (568) and Gault (566). Ronak Pandit finished fourth. 

India have so far won 10 gold, six silver and three bronze medals in the meet.

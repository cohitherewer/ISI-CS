 London: World record holder Paula Radcliffe will run in the 25th London marathon on April 17, organisers said on Monday. Radcliffe set the world best of 2::15:25 in the 2003 London event.

 The 31-year-old Briton started as favourite in last year?s Athens Olympics, but dropped out six km from the finish and also failed to finish the 10,000m final.

 ?It doesn?t get any better than this for the 25th anniversary,? race director David Bedford said in a statement.?

 Madrid: A Spanish motorcyclist who sustained injuries after falling in the Dakar rally last week died in hospital in Spain on Monday, a source from the organisers said. Jose Manuel Perez, who fell during a stage in Mauritania, had his kidney and spleen removed in a Dakar hospital in Senegal before being transferred back to Spain. ?Finally he was transferred to Alicante ... he was taken to intensive care and there were complications. It appears to have been an infection,? the source said.

 Sports paper Marca reported the 40-year-old rider, known as quot;El Carni? was taking part in his fifth Dakar rally.

 London: The BAR Formula One team has been bought by a joint venture between engine partners Honda and majority shareholder British American Tobacco (BAT), both companies announced on Monday. BAT now own 55 per cent of BARH Limited with Japanese carmaker Honda holding the other 45 per cent.

 Accra: Hearts of Oak won the inaugural African Confederation Cup with an 8-7 victory on penalties over fellow Ghanaian club Asante Kotoko in Kumasi on Sunday. Hearts levelled the aggregate score at 2-2 with a goal in the final 10 minutes and then won the title in the shootout since African club competition rules do not allow extra time.

 Frankfurt: Europe?s refereeing chief is opposed to the use of video replays for goal-line decisions but he does see potential in a new idea to put a microchip sensor in the ball. ?I look positively at new aids if they help us along ? if, for example, we could send a signal to a referee?s wristwatch,? Volker Roth, chairman of Uefa?s referees committee, told the German Football Association website on Monday. ?But I don?t like instant video replays. Football is a fast-flowing game, which should not be chopped up or constantly interrupted.?

 Football?s lawmakers will be given a presentation of a new ball containing a microchip sensor when the International Board meets in Cardiff next month.

 London: Struggling Nottingham Forest appointed former West Bromwich Albion boss Gary Megson as their new manager on Monday. The 45-year-old replaces caretaker manager Mick Harford who will leave the City Ground, the English second division club said on its official website.

 Forest are second-last after 28 games and chairman Nigel Doughty said:?We felt we had to make a change at this particular time.?

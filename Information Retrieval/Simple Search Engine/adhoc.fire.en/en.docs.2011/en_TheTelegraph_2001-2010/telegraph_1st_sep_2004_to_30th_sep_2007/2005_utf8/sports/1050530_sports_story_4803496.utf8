 Benaud calls for ban on Bangla

London: Richie Benaud added his voice Sunday to calls for Bangladesh and Zimbabwe to be dropped from senior international cricket. 

The Australian cricket great, currently in England where he is commentating for Channel 4, made his comments after witnessing Bangladeshs innings and 261-run defeat in the first Test at Lords. 

The match, Bangladeshs first Test in England, finished before lunch on the third day here Saturday with Benaud labelling it an absolute shambles. 

Benaud, writing in a British tabloid, was adamant that the presence of Bangladesh ? whose only win in 37 Tests has come against fellow strugglers Zimbabwe ? was neither good for the game as a whole or for the teams themselves. 

After witnessing this two-and-a-bit day farce at Lords, I am convinced our games governing body ? the International Cricket Council ? must make a firm and swift decision, Benaud said. 

They must remove Bangladesh and Zimbabwe from full-time international cricket until their ability and infrastructure warrant their re-inclusion. 

Both teams need to be put on hold for the good of cricket. They are simply not good enough to be pitched against proper Test match countries 

Benaud added: What should be done is to have both countries scheduled to play a carefully programmed series of matches against A teams and minor teams from the other eight (Test) countries and they should play against one another as well. 

The ICC is due to hold its annual meetings at Lords in June.

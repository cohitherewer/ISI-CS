The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Accommodation problem in Ahmedabad

 - TEAM INDIA TO STAY ON IN NEW DELHI FOR AN EXTRA DAY; LANKANS BOOKED SEPARATELY 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: It didnt take too long for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) working committee to shift the third and final Test against Sri Lanka from Kanpur to Motera, near Ahmedabad, but that has created problems. 

Even if the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) can put its best foot forward at such short notice ? it got host-status a fortnight before the December 18 start ? Team Indias preparations for the last Test before the tour of Pakistan are certainly going to be affected. 

After all, instead of leaving for Ahmedabad on Thursday (the day after the New Delhi Test ends), Rahul Dravid and Co. will be flying out on Friday. 

The reason: Not enough rooms at Taj Residency Ummed, in Gujarats premier city, before December 16. 

In fact, while the Lankans are slated to leave New Delhi on Thursday itself ? thereby getting more time to acclimatise ? they wont be staying at the Taj, but at another hotel. 

The BCCI has a contract with the Taj group, but the hotel industry major often finds it difficult to oblige such a whimsical customer. 

Merely being high profile isnt good enough. 

Yes, were having problems with the accommodation? Things would have been fine had the official hotel been given enough time? It just hasnt been possible for the Taj to go back on commitments made some time ago, GCA joint-secretary Hitesh Patel told The Telegraph. 

He added that 25 rooms would be available from Friday. 

Apparently, coach Greg Chappell was very keen that the team depart on Thursday and had to be briefed on why that wouldnt be possible. 

The BCCI must not only review its rotation policy (after what happened in the Chennai Test), but also liaise with the hotel group having the official label before awarding matches. 

Motera, incidentally, has already hosted two ODIs this year ? versus Pakistan and against Sri Lanka. Both were won by the visitors.

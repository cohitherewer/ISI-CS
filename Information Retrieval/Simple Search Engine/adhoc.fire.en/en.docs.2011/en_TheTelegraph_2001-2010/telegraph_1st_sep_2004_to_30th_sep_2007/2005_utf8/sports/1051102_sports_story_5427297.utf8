Hamburg: With 27 of the 32 World Cup places decided, a mating dance is going on across Germany. 

Teams are searching for the best hotels and training facilities while towns and cities are trying to attract the biggest teams. 

Bruce Arenas United States were one of the first to settle on their base camp for next years World Cup, choosing the affluent city state of Hamburg in the far north of Germany. 

Brazil, Argentina and France boast better-known players and will attract more fans but Hamburg officials hope the Americans will bolster the citys bid to stage the 2016 Olympics. 

The important thing for Hamburg is to attract attention at the World Cup with a view to bidding again for the Olympics, said Guido Neumann, part of the Hamburg city public relations team working on the World Cup. 

The United States are the best team for us in that sense. They might not be the biggest team in sporting terms but they will draw a lot of attention. This is a big chance for us. 

Hamburg is already guaranteed a high profile after being confirmed as one of the 12 venue cities that will stage a total of 64 matches from June 9 to July 9. Four group matches and a quarter final will be held at Hamburgs main soccer stadium. 

Bremen, bitterly disappointed at missing out as a venue, won some consolation this month by signing up Sweden to train in the city. 

Its fantastic news, said Bremens sports minister Thomas Roewekamp. The decision means the 2006 World Cup now includes Bremen. 

Hosts Germany will stay in Berlin and the capital can expect other teams to follow but fans will become adroit at picking out far smaller towns on the map too. 

Argentina will stay at Herzogenaurach, the town famous as the birthplace of sportswear giant Adidas and rival Puma, while the Dutch will set up camp in Hinterzarten in the Black Forest. 

Many other national associations will wait until after their match schedule becomes clear at the December 9 draw in Leipzig. 

Brazil, who won the World Cup for the fifth time in South Korea and Japan in 2002, remain the biggest draw for potential hosts. 

Cologne, one of Germanys main Carnival towns, has been tipped as their most likely base and 4,000 Brazilians have already booked accommodation in the region via the tournaments specialist travel agency. 

A squad that should include many of the games most exciting talents, such as Ronaldinho, Robinho and Ronaldo, will bring hundreds of reporters and thousands of fans flocking to training sessions. That means money for local businesses but Hamburg insists economic factors were of secondary importance. 

For Hamburg, the image we can create at the World Cup is more important than the economic aspect, said Neumann.

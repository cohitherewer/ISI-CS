 India lose to Tajikistan

New Delhi: There was heartbreak for India as they were pipped 2-3 by Tajikistan in the final round robin encounter of the AFC under-17 qualifying tournament, thus losing out on an opportunity to appear at the continental championship in Singapore next September. 

A valiant second-half performance by the Indian colts, highlighted by goals from Arjun Tudu and Khangembamthoi Singh, was not enough. 

Three goals in the space of 15 minutes through Karaev Ulugbek (28, 43) and captain Shohzukhurov Samad (33) effectively sealed Indias fate.

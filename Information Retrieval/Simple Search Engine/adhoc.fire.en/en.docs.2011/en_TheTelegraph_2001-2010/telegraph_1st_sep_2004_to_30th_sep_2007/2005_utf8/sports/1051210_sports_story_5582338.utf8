 Pak wary of England comeback, says Inzy

Lahore: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said his confident team would be wary of an England comeback in the five-match ODI series which starts here on Saturday. 

Our win in the Tests has given us confidence, but I still think England is a very dangerous team and can stage a comeback in the one-dayers, said Inzamam, whose side won the Test series 2-0 last week. 

Pakistan will be boosted by the return of Younis Khan and Abdul Razzaq. 

Pakistan is also using two neutral umpires, instead of the prevalent one neutral and one home umpire, for the first time in one-day cricket.

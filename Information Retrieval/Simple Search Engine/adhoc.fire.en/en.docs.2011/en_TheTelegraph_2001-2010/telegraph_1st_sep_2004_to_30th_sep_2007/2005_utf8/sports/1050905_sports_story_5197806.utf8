 Indians highly underrated: Harikrishna

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: World junior champion P. Harikrishna feels the Indian players are hugely underrated in the international circuit and can change the conception only by participating in more tournaments. 

We have a number of talented players, but because they do not play international meet too frequently, they cannot earn enough Fide rating points, the Grandmaster, currently No. 59 in the world, said. 

For Harikrishna, who came here as a special invitee for the inauguration of the Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy, achieving 2700 Elo rating is the immediate target.

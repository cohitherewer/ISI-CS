The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?d like to be my own self: Anirudh

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: As accolades poured in and comparisons with father Krishnamachari Srikkanth ensued after his match-winning 88 from 74 balls, Anirudh declared that he would like to do things his own way. 

The 18-year-old made his Ranji Trophy debut for Tamil Nadu against Baroda this season and has played three matches in the national one-day meet. 

?I don?t want to copy anyone,? said Anirudh, who appreciates Virender Sehwag?s style. ?I like his (Sehwag) positive approach? his cool attitude to the game,? he explained. 

What has been his father?s role? ?He?s always at hand to offer help. More than technical, it?s the mental aspect he stresses on? the importance of mental toughness, the preparation that goes into a match,? Anirudh said. 

His father?s achievements do not put extra pressure on him. ?Dad will always be my idol? someone who I will always look up to. He?s been a constant source of encouragement. But it doesn?t mean inviting any pressure. I would like to be my own self.? 

Does failure in the first two games of the current series and being dropped for the third match make him hungry for success? ?No? I just took it as just any other match and played according to the situation.? 

He also praised under-19 coach Venkatesh Prasad, who has helped him sharpen his game.

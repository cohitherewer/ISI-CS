 Dey makes history

New Delhi: Indian girls put up an impressive show, winning the runners-up trophy at the Asian Junior Weightlifting Championships in Tashkent, but it was Subhan Dey who stole the show. 

Dey became the first Indian to create an Asian youth record by lifting 90kgs in snatch. This earned him the gold in the 50kg weight category. He won silver in the clean and jerk with a lift of 103 kg, behind gold-winner N. Napoom of Thailand. 

Dey missed the overall gold on bodyweight count after he tied with Napoom at 193 kg, weighing 140gm heavier than the Thai. 

Simple Kaur Bumrah won three bronze medals ? one each in snatch, clean and jerk and overall ? in the 75kg class on the final day to increase Indias tally to three silver and nine bronze. 

The 12 medals led to an aggregate of 469 points behind China who claimed the title with 494 points on Monday, Indian Weightlifting Federation said on Tuesday.

 Md. Sp. bank on Musah 

 Musah 

Margao: Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit Bhattacharya is banking on a few factors to see through Fransa Pax in their opening match on Friday. 

First, the presence of Suley Musah is a big boost for the team, feels the coach. The Ghanaian will have added responsibility of captaining the side. 

The presence of Musah, who played for East Bengal earlier, will be a great asset to the team. Our boys are well prepared and confident of putting it across to Fransa, asserted Bhattacharya. 

He further felt that his team is a pool of young talented players who want to grab the limelight in a big tournament. Apart from Musah, Patrick DSouza and Eric are the other two foreigners at their disposal. 

If Musah is a key in Bhattacharyas scheme of things, he is also taking heart from the fact that Fransa are without any foreigner. 

In another match Friday, Sporting Clube de Goa start favourites versus SBT, but taking a cue from Dempos exit, they remained cautious .

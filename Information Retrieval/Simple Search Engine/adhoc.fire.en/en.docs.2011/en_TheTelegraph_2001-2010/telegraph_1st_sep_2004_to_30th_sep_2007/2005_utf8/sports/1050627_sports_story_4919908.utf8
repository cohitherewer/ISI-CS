 Johl finishes tied 7th 

 - BRUNEI OPEN GOLF 

 Johl grabbed his first top-10 of the season 

Bandar Seri Begawan: Three birdies on the front nine in the space of five holes saw Amandeep Johl grab his first top-10 of the season as he finished tied seventh at the $300,000 Brunei Open at the empire hotel and country club. 

Johls final round of one-under 70, meant he was among the handful with a sub-par round on each of the four days. 

Australian Terry Pilkadaris carded a final round of four-under 67 to aggregate a total of 19-under 265 and a huge five-shot win over fellow-Aussie Jarrod Lyle. Pilkadaris, 31, earned $47,250 for his third career win in eight months. 

Johls 70 gave him a total of nine-under 275 and saw him tie for seventh place with Ahmad Bateman and Scott Barr. Gaurav Ghei carded a two-under 69 to come up to tied 16th, while Firoz Ali bogeyed his last two holes for a 72 and dropped from 13th to tied 20th. Still it was his best finish of the season. 

Uttam Singh Mundy after three par rounds, finally carded a sub-par round to finish at one-under 283 and tied 35th. Ashok Kumar lost his rhythm and bogeyed last two holes to drop to tied 39th, while Digvijay Singh shot a 74 and stayed at tied 68th. (PTI)

 WI to play first Twenty20 match 

London: The West Indies tour of New Zealand in February and March next year will feature their first Twenty20 international, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has said. 

As well as five one-day Internationals, the West Indies will play three Tests, one more than the originally-planned schedule to make up for the likely cancellation of Zimbabwes trip to New Zealand. 

The West Indies also play a three Test series against Australia in November. 

ITINERARY 

Feb. 16: Twenty20 International (Auckland); Feb. 18: First ODI (Wellington); Feb. 22: Second ODI (Queenstown); Feb. 25: Third ODI (Christchurch); March 1: Fourth ODI (Napier); March 4: Fifth ODI (Auckland); March 9-13: First Test (Auckland); March 17-21: Second Test (Wellington); March 25-29: Third Test (Napier).

Calcutta: Three goals in three matches since setting foot in this city is a strike-rate not many foreigners have achieved. Indeed, Mohun Bagan are riding high these days on Togolose Gley Yao Rodrigues striking prowess. 

The green-and-maroons will no doubt bank on Rodrigue to keep their all-win slate in the CFL Premier Division intact when they cross swords with Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

Though Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said, We are not thinking too much about Rodrigue, he is bound to have instructed his players to keep a close watch on the foreigner. 

Our aim would be to play at the same pace for the entire 90 minutes in the Mexican system, said Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta. He did, however, add that it will still take some more time to settle down in this new system. 

Dutta is likely to field both Rodrigue and Dipendu Biswas ? who scored the winner against Ever-Ready on Thursday ? up front. The foreigner needs a supporting hand, he remarked. 

Mohun Bagan will be without the services of playmaker Basudeb Mondal, who tore a ligament during the Ever-Ready match. But Noel Wilson will be back in action after missing a game because of an injury. Missing Basu (Mondal) is a disadvantage, but the good thing is Noel will be back, Dutta said. 

Bhattacharya, on the other hand, is keen on playing two strikers ? K.P. Zubair and Raman Vijayan ? to pressurise the Mohun Bagan defence. We are up against the wall now after losing two matches and drawing one, we have to be positive, the coach said. 

Some of my boys will have to pull up their socks and put up a spirited display? thats the only way to turn around, Bhattacharya said. 

Mohammedan Sporting won the first three games before managing a solitary point in their next three.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cultural adventure for Bayern

 - IFA SHIELD 

 Referee to star in TV audience-oriented innovation 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: For Bayern Munich, the ensuing trip to the City of Joy will be a cultural adventure. 

The legendary German club, which will be sending its reserve side to the IFA Shield, has been seeded directly to the semi-finals. The 111th edition of the tournament kicks off with an East Bengal versus Mohammedan Sporting clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

According to Herman Gerland, coach of the Bayern reserve side, the team will play to win, as always, but I do believe this (visit to Calcutta) will be a cultural adventure. 

The organisers of the tournament made an audio-visual presentation on the Bayern Munich side with interviews of Gerland and assistant coach Gerd Muller at a press conference on Tuesday. 

It will be a test for us? I would like the boys to keep their eyes and ears open to soak in the culture of a country vastly different from ours, said Gerland who was part of the Bochum side which played in India about two decades ago. 

Muller said he was looking forward to the trip. It would be nice to get away from home for a few days? I would take my tennis racket along, the feared striker of the seventies quipped. 

He has no hassles working under a person whose reputation as player is nothing compared to his. Im very happy at Bayern? my job is to build on the players strength, I dont give any orders, said Muller, who should be the main attraction. 

The IFA would be trying out an innovation, which has never before been associated with a football match anywhere in the world. The referee will be carrying a microphone which will pick up his voice and any players close to him. 

The producer of the telecast ? ESPN-STAR will be beaming the semis and final live ? will use his discretion to bring on air the referees and players interaction. 

Englishman Dave Roberts, who did duty in the East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan match last season, will be on the officials panel for the semis and final.

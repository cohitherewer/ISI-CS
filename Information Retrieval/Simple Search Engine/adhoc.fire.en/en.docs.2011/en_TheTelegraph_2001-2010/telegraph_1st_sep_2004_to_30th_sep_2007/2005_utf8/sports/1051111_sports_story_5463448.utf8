The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I needed such a knock to feel better

 - A day after tearing into Lanka, Yuvraj mingles with heart patients 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Vadodara: Twenty-four hours after pulverising the 

 Sri Lankans, Yuvraj Singh was in a different role: Wishing 

 patients, who had undergone a bypass, speedy recovery at 

 a local heart institute. 

He wasnt even remotely out of place at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground in Rajkot and, on Thursday evening, was absolutely at ease here. 

 Somebody called at the hotel 

 (Taj Residency) and conveyed that the patients wanted to 

 meet me... It was an off day for us and, so, I didnt 

 have a problem in making the trip. I must have spent around 

 25 minutes at the institute, Yuvraj told The Telegraph. 

Reflecting on his fast and furious unbeaten 79 in Rajkot, which ended a poor run in the ongoing series (besides ensuring a quick seven-wicket win in match No.6), Yuvraj said: I needed such a knock to make me feel better... I need a start and the first 20-25 runs are always important... 

Till Rajkot, his best in the series had been 18 in Jaipur. However, the Chandigarh da puttar has already cracked two ODI hundreds this season ? 110 versus the West Indies in Colombo and 120 against the hosts in Harare. 

Yuvraj, who completed five years with Team India last month, added: Its never easy when the runs dont come... I wouldnt say I was worried, but you cant be on cloud nine if 18 is your highest in a series. 

Asked whether hed made it more difficult by probably reminding himself of the need to score big each time he took guard, Yuvraj replied: Not really... At the same time, I was aware that I hadnt been getting runs. 

As in the Sourav Ganguly-John Wright era, Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell backed him publicly through this mini crisis. Given the contribution Yuvraj makes as a fielder, hes seen as a complete package. 

 Thats one-up on most.

 Collina career may get extended

Milan: Pierluigi Collina, the best known referee in the world, could have his career extended by a further year thanks to a likely Italian rule change. 

The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) are to discuss a proposal put forward by the Referees Association to change the rules on age limits for top class referees. 

If the change is accepted, Collina would still be able to take charge of Serie A and Champions League games but a Fifa spokesman said he would not be able to officiate in next years World Cup finals. 

Under current Italian rules, 45-year-old Collina would have had to retire at the end of this season. An FIGC spokeswoman said the rule change could be on the agenda at a federal council meeting on Wednesday or on July 15. 

Current regulations say that once a referee reaches 45, they must finish at the end of the season. 

The rule switch would allow them to continue until the end of the calendar year in which they turned 45 and then to complete the season underway. 

As Collina turned 45 in February he would be able to referee in Serie A and in European club competition all of next season before being forced to retire in June, 2006. 

Technically that would mean that Collina would still be an active referee in Italy when the World Cup finals kick off on June 6. 

But a Fifa spokesman, Andreas Herren, said that Collina would not be able to referee in the finals as Fifas age limit is based on the calendar year. 

Collina is currently on the international list of referees but will be too old to be included in the next list which will be drawn up in December.

 Azhar flays ICC 

Dubai: Former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin has lashed out at ICC chief Ehsan Mani for making a ?stupid remark? against his role as a television commentator. 

Azharuddin, who was banned for life by the BCCI for his alleged role in match-fixing in 2000, said the ICC could not stop him from earning his livelihood. 

?Cricket is my life. How can someone stop me from earning my livelihood? Even the Indian Board made it clear that they cannot deprive me of my livelihood,? Azharuddin told the Gulf News. ?Being the ICC president he (Mani) should not have made such a stupid remark. No constitution in the world can deprive a person from earning his livelihood,? Azhar said. (PTI)

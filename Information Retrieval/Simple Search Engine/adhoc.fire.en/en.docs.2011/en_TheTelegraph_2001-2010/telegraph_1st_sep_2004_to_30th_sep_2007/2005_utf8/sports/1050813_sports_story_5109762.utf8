 Goolam Rajah World XI manager 

London: Goolam Rajah, the South African national team manager, has been appointed to manage the World XI Test and ODI teams in Octobers Super Series in Australia. 

Rajah has held senior team management positions in South African cricket for more than 11 years. 

He has been in charge for more than 260 one-day Internationals, 102 Test matches, three World Cups and three Champions Trophy tournaments. He is the most experienced team manger in the international game, the International Cricket Council said in a release Friday. 

Later this month he will manage the Africa side in the three match ODI series against an Asian side, prior to starting work with the World XI. 

I thought I had experienced most of what the game had to offer in team management roles, but the opportunity of working with the ICC World XI teams is a great honour and a personal privilege, he said.

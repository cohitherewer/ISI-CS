 SA board ropes in Donald

Durban: South African fast-bowling great Allan Donald has been appointed by the Cricket South Africa (CSA) to join its High Performance Programme (HPP) team, which aims at preparing stars of the future. 

Donald, who claimed 330 wickets in 72 Tests, joins another former star, Gary Kirsten, who is already manager of the programme. 

[The Telegraph had reported 10 days ago that South African coach Mickey Arthur can call up Kirsten and/or Donald to help lift his teams performance.] 

Announcing Donalds appointment in Bloemfontein on Sunday, Gerald Majola, the boards CEO, said it was a major boost for cricket that two of the countrys top former stars would be in charge of preparing players for the Test arena. 

He said Donald was appointed as a specialist coach on a two-year contract. 

Allans expertise as one of the worlds best fast bowlers of modern times and his experience of playing top class cricket around the world for more than a decade, will add enormous value to our high performance programme, said Majola. 

Donald, who used to be known as the white lightning, said he was pleased with the appointment.It is a huge honour and privilege to work with Gary and the professional cricketers. 

I am optimistic that I shall be able to make a meaningful contribution to take the next crop of South African cricketers to the next level of intense competition, he said.

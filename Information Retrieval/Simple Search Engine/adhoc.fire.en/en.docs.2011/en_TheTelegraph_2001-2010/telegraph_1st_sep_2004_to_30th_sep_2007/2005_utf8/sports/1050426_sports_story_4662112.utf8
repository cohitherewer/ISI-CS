The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Woodforde to coach Mahesh-Todd

 - Doubles legend in charge of a team comprising another legend and a great

 Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge 

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi is no longer serious about his tennis, he organises more tournaments than he wins doubles matches these days ? observed a tennis veteran the other day. 

That rather rude remark is unlikely to have pierced Bhupathi?s ears, but the doubles ace will leave none with any doubt about his commitment after the world comes to know of his latest career-related decision: He and partner Todd Woodbridge have decided to hire Mark Woodforde as their coach. 

That makes it a unique threesome ? one doubles legend coaching a team made up of another legend and a great. And, to top it all, the two legends themselves formed the most successful doubles team (famously called the Woodies) of the Open era. 

Just to refresh memories, the Woodies won a record 61 titles (out of 80 finals) which included 11 Grand Slam triumphs. Six of those major victories came at Wimbledon. Woodforde, who retired at the end of 2000, won 67 career titles while Woodbridge is still going strong ? not out on an unparallelled 83. 

Our own Bhupathi is way behind the Aussie legends, but his 37 doubles titles is an Indian record all the same. 

So why does a mega-experienced team like Woodbridge-Bhupathi, with 120 crowns under their belt, need a coach? 

?People from the sidelines can see better, they can point out what?s going wrong and suggest what can be done,? Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Monday. 

?With somebody of Woodforde?s stature available, we thought it prudent to take his help. He didn?t travel for three years after retirement and then had a short stint with the Australian Fed Cup? now he?s ready for assignments,? said Bhupathi who was in Calcutta to attend the organising committee meeting of September?s WTA Sunfeast Open meet. 

The last coach to have travelled with Bhupathi was Italian pro Mose Navarra. Before that, Bhupathi worked with Enrico Piperno and the late Bob Carmichael (who had first been hired by Leander Paes). 

?A coach definitely helps? he practises with the players, provides strategic inputs. The Bryans (Bob and Mike) have one, so do (Mark) Knowles and (Daniel) Nestor, (Wayne) Black and (Kevin) Ullyett,? said Bhupathi. 

Woodforde?s maiden assignment will be the Rome Masters Series next week. ?He will be with us at all Grand Slams and Masters events,? informed Bhupathi. 

Woodforde?s ideas will be welcome for a duo which started off the year on a roaring note (winning the Sydney crown in January) but has kind of stagnated since then, slipping to No. 10 on the ATP doubles team list. Their best in four tournaments since the Sydney meet was a semi-final appearance in Dubai.

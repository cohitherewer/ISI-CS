St John?s: Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan survived dropped catches and went on to make unbeaten centuries as the West Indies reached 299 for one on the third day of the fourth and final Test against South Africa on Sunday. 

Gayle was on 184 and Sarwan 103 in a record unbeaten stand of 285 against South Africa, who had declared their first innings on 588 for six. They bettered the 284 shared by Wavell Hinds and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the first Test of the series in Georgetown. 

Gayle, who has now made seven Test centuries, might have been dismissed on 80 but South Africa captain Graeme Smith at slip failed to hold an edge off Jacques Kallis. 

Four balls earlier Boeta Dippenaar, at square leg, had put down a difficult chance offered by Sarwan on 29 off Makhaya Ntini. 

Gayle, who smashed his 50 off 34 balls, said he had been spurred on by the South Africans, who scored four centuries in one innings for the first time. 

?It was very difficult to go out there and bat after spending more than two days in the field,? Gayle said. ?But when I looked at how the South Africans batted, that motivated me.? 

Gayle batted with barely bridled aggression in the first half of his innings and hit Pollock, playing his first international match since January after being sidelined with an ankle injury, for three fours in the first over. 

The first was an edged drive through the slip cordon, the second a sublime drive through the covers and the third a wild slash that flew over the slips. 

Ntini struck with his first delivery when Hinds drove uppishly and the fast bowler hung on to a one-handed catch. 

The wicket did not interrupt Gayle?s flow of runs and he stamped his authority by driving Pollock over extra cover for six before repeating the feat against Zondeki, who left the field after bowling five overs because of pain behind his right knee. 

The tourists had resumed on 525 for four and scored briskly to add 63 runs in 16 overs before declaring. Kallis and Ashwell Prince took their record fifth-wicket stand to 267 before Kallis mistimed a pull off Daren Powell to be caught at mid-on.

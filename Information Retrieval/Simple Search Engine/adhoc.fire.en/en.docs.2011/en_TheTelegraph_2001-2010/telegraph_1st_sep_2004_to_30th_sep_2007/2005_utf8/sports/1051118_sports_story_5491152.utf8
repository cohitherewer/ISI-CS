Vilamoura (Portugal): Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa launched Indias campaign on Thursday in the World Cup Golf with a brilliant 12-under that gave them a share of the lead with Australia, with Wales and Sweden one shot behind. 

Only England with 10-under have the chance of overtaking them at the Arnold Palmer design Victoria Clube de Golfe in Villamoura in the Algarve region of Portugal here. 

Atwal and Randhawa opened with three-straight birdies and after a par on the fourth round won two more birdies and were five under six for six holes. With two more pars and one birdie, they turned in six-under. 

They spat fire on back nine, reeling off two birdies and eagle and another birdie on 10th to 13th before a par on 14th halted their amazing run. 

We hit well and putted well, said Atwal, Indias only player on the USPGA Tour. 

Jyoti was long off the tee and we putted well. There are three more days and we are playing as good as anybody. Anything can happen, he added. 

Randhawa said, we are playing well and hopefully we can carry on this form. 

The first day saw players in the better ball format which will be repeated on the third day. Second and fourth days will see alternate shot formats. The event carries a purse of $4 million and the Indians have got a direct entry for the first time. . (PTI)

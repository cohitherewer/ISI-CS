 Klitschko bids adieu to boxing

 - It was a hard decision to take... 

Frankfurt: Ukraines world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko has announced his retirement from boxing after a knee operation. 

Recently Ive spent more time battling injuries than my opponents, the 34-year old said. It was a hard decision to take but Id like to go out at the top and, with my departure, open the way for my successors. 

Klitschko was forced to pull out of his World Boxing Council (WBC) title defence against Hasim Rahman, set for November 12, after injuring his right knee while sparring in Los Angeles last Thursday. 

He had twice had to postpone fights with Rahman earlier this year because of thigh and back problems, and his latest injury left him under threat of being stripped of the title if he could not fight again within 90 days. 

After having surgery to repair damaged knee ligaments on Tuesday, that target became unrealistic, with his expected recovery time put at six months.

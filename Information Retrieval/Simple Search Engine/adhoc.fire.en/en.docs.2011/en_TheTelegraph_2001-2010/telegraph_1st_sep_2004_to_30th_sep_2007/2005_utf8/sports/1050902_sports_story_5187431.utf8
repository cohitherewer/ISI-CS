 Benaud surprised Aussies are still alive

London: Richie Benaud is astonished Australia still have a chance of retaining the Ashes after being outplayed by England in the last three Tests of an enthralling series. 

Australia held on for a draw in the third Test at Old Trafford, a result that came in between tight England victories at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. 

That left England 2-1 up ahead of next weeks fifth and final Test at The Oval, where an Australian win would see them square the series and retain the Ashes theyve held for the last 16 years. 

Former Australia captain Benaud, who led his country to three Ashes series wins in the late 1950s and early 60s before becoming a highly-respected television commentator, could not believe the series was still alive. 

The astonishing thing is that Australia are still very close to England, and if they win at The Oval they will retain the Ashes, Benaud, 74, said on Wednesday. England have outplayed Australia in three of the Test matches. 

England were by far the better side at Edgbaston and Old Trafford ? and then again at Trent Bridge, said Benaud, who as a leg-spinning allrounder was the first player to complete the Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. 

Forecasts suggest rain may play a major role at The Oval although Benaud, for one, hoped the weathermen were wrong. 

I want to see either England or Australia win the match. I dont want it to be a draw; it will be fitting if we can finish this great series with a result. 

If England avoid defeat at The Oval, Ricky Ponting will become the first Australia captain to lose an Ashes series since Allan Border in 1986-87. 

The pressure appeared to be getting to Ponting at Trent Bridge, where he lost his temper last week after he was run-out by substitute Gary Pratt. 

Benaud agreed with match referee Ranjan Madugalles decision to fine Ponting 75 percent of his match fee, but predicted the International Cricket Council (ICC) would look again at the rules covering substitute fielders. (AFP)

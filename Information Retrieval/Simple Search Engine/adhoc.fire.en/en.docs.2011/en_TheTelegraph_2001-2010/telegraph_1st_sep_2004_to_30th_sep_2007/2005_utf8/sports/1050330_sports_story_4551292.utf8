Calcutta: A splash of brilliance from Bhaichung Bhutia and Subhas Chakraborty?s return from oblivion marked East Bengal?s 2-0 victory over State Bank of Travancore (SBT) at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

The 14th round battle in the National Football League for ONGC Cup between the league leaders and the bottom-ranked strugglers was, thus, on expected lines, with East Bengal dominating the proceedings against the Keralite visitors. 

The win helped the holders displace Dempo SC from the top with 30 points while SBT remain at the bottom of the table with nine. 

Man-of-the-match Bhaichung Bhutia drew the first blood in the 20th minute and the lead was doubled by Subhas Chakraborty, who came back into action after a seven month injury lay-off, in the stoppage time. 

As the match started, the memory of the shocking 2-3 loss to Sporting Clube de Goa in the previous round ? which stopped East Bengal?s unbeaten run at the Salt Lake Stadium in the NFL for over two years ? must be hovering heavy on Subhas Bhowmick?s mind. 

But the East Bengal coach excellently managed his side from sidelines, with intelligent changes and combination. 

Helping East Bengal?s cause further, SBT?s first-choice goalie Harshlal Rahman had to be replaced by Jean Christian, after the former suffered an injury while making a diving effort to save a long ranger, when the match was just two-minute old. 

The visitors, however, tried to control the proceedings initially, but this happened because the hosts wanted to settle down before going for the jugular. 

And the result was achieved in the 20th minute. Captain Chandan Das forwarded a nice through to Bhaichung, who had three SBT defenders guarding him in front. The India captain took time and then in a brilliant spell of run, dodged past the trio before placing the ball in coolly to the left of the goalie. Breathtaking. 

The lead gave East Bengal more orientations and options in their attacks as Bhaichung-Ernest Jeremiah combination started to make their presence count. Bhaichung, however, was kept under strict marking while Jeremiah, missed quite a few chances. Even Chandan and Syed Rahim Nabi tried their heart out to put their names on the scorers? list, but in vain. 

After the breather, Bhowmick brought Shylo Malsawmtluanga in place of Alvito D?Cunha, which proved to be a good change as Malsawmtluanga?s fresh pair of legs helped the red-and-golds add sting to their attack. But the actual surprise came in the 76th minute when Subhas replaced Chandan. Returning to the field after a 10-month injury lay-off, Subhas was keen to prove a point the moment an opportunity came his way. 

Subhas was lurking inside the box, and thus keeping the SBT defenders on tenterhooks. He along with Gurpreet Singh (who came in for M. Suresh in the first half) raided the goalmouth several times. 

As East Bengal went on in an attacking mould, SBT, on the other, were able to reach the rival citadel on a few occasions, but lack of scoring ability prevented them from drawing level. 

East Bengal sealed the fate of the match in the stoppage time, when Gurpreet sailed a brilliant cross from the right and found Subhas just outside the six-yard box. Subhas made no mistake and his side volley pierced the net.

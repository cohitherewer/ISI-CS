 Thorpe hopes to edge out Pietersen

 Graham Thorpe 

London: Veteran England batsman Graham Thorpe declared himself fit and available for selection for the upcoming Ashes series which could see exciting South Africa-born rival Kevin Pietersen lose out. 

The 35-year-old Surrey star hit 73 on his return to the County side on Monday and said that his persistent back problems had eased considerably. 

Thorpe, who became only the eighth England cricketer to reach a century of caps in the second Test against Bangladesh earlier in the summer, said he believed he had given Englands selectors a bit of a headache and is hoping for good news when the first Ashes squad is named on Thursday. 

Pietersen, though, has been pushed forward by many to take Thorpes place as he is a young talent and the veteran has already announced he is to take up a coaching role with New South Wales in the winter, thus ruling himself out of the tour of India and Pakistan. 

However, Thorpe is counting on his experience winning him the nod for the first of the five Ashes Tests from the selectors, whose chairman David Graveney was in Bristol to watch him score his half-century against Gloucestershire. 

I had a bit of work done to my back over the last two or three weeks ? I had a few jabs in there ? and I feel freer than I did a month ago which is good, Thorpe said. 

Thorpe had promised to give Graveney an update on his physical well-being after four tough days in energy-sapping west country heat. 

Thorpe said he was happy to have got some runs in his comeback game. 

First knock back after being out for two or three weeks and I was happy with it. 

Its a good start, sets us up and gives the selectors a bit of a headache in a few days time to work out who theyre going to pick. 

Its as good as its (the back) felt. Whether Ive got enough cricket under my belt I dont know. But it felt good. 

Im delighted with the way Ive sailed through this game, really pleased, Ive struggled for a few games after the Tests against Bangladesh, but I was pleased with the way Ive come through this one. 

Graveney said: I spoke to Graham Monday morning and he was feeling fine. I shall talk to him again to see if there is any reaction. 

When the selectors meet, we will be given a detailed medical report on how Grahams back has responded to the series of injections, including the epidural, and we will also take into account the volume of cricket he has played recently. 

These things will be weighed up before we announce the squad on Thursday. (AFP)

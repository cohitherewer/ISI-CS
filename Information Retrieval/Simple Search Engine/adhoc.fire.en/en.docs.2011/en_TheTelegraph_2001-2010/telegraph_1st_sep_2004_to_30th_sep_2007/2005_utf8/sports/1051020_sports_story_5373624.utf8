 Wiratchant to take part

Kuala Lumpur: Thai stalwart Thaworn Wiratchant, the first player in Asian Tour history to break the $400,000 mark in single season earnings, will headline a star cast at the Hero Honda Indian Open in New Delhi. 

The 38-year-old finished 13th at the Bangkok Airways Open last weekend to win $3,216, taking his earnings to $400,975. He also remained atop the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

The Indian Open to be played next week also includes Indian ace Jyoti Randhawa, currently No. 3 on the Asian Merit list with $214,120 and Terry Pilkadaris, occupying the fifth spot with $200,641. 

Two other Australians, Scott Barr (No. 6) and Marcus Both (No. 9), are also confirmed for the tournament. 

In the updated Order of Merit, Jeev Milkha Singh, who has not played on the Asian Tour since the Singapore Open, is 15th, while Shiv Kapur has moved up to 47th and has sewn up his playing rights on the Tour for 2006. 

Kapur produced a strong showing at the Bangkok Airways Open, finishing fourth and moved up to 47th on the table. (PTI)

 Narain to test for Williams

London: Indian Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan will test for Williams in Spain this week after failing to find a race seat for next year. 

The team, yet to name a reserve and test driver, said the 28-year-old Chennai racer would join them in Jerez on Wednesday for the start of a three-day test. 

[Karthikeyans mentor Sachin Tendulkar had said in an interview to The Telegraph on Tuesday that he was hopeful the Indian driver may still have some role to play with one of the teams next year. Obviously, that is on track]. 

Karthikeyan will test for the team pending the announcement of the teams third driver, said a Williams statement. 

Narain will be in Jerez to help us with normal testing duties, added technical director Sam Michael. 

 At this stage of development of the FW27C, we have a series of systems checks and initial set-up investigations to complete. 

Karthikeyan became Indias first Formula One driver, and the first to score points, when he made his debut with Jordan this season. 

New owners Midland have now replaced Jordan on the starting grid and have opted for ell funded Dutchman Christijan Albers and Portugals Tiago Monteiro. 

Williams have Australian Mark Webber and Germanys Nico Rosberg as their 2006 line-up but even a test role at the former champions would represent a positive step for Karthikeyan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tollygunge hold Mahindra

Mumbai: Tollygunge Agragami held former Durand Cup champions Mahindra United 1-1 in their league match of ninth National Football League (NFL) at the Cooperage on Friday. 

In a match which failed to raise to the expected standard, Tollygunge, who drew first blood in the tenth minute when their striker Surajit Bose?s fine floater from the right beat the jeepmen?s custodian Sandip Nandy all ends up, managed to hold off Mahindra?s repeated attacks. 

However, Calcutta outfit?s joy was shortlived as just two minutes later Mahindra striker Rodrigo de Almeida scored the equaliser following a free kick from L. Surkumar Singh. 

It was the Mahindra who started off the first good move when their winger Flavio Rodrigues, who was totally off colour on this day, held on to the ball for too long before his cross was intercepted by Tollygunge custodian Arindam Ghosh. 

In the fifth minute Almeida?s fine try was well saved by Ghosh. In the 20th, Flavio Rodrigues missed a sitter when his kick was off target with just the rival goalkeeper to beat. 

Ten minutes later, Mahindra defender Surkumar Singh?s drive hit the cross bar and went out. In the 35th minute Flavio got a gilt-edged chance but his shot went out.

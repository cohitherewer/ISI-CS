The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rennedy set to be back 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After the morning practice on the eve of Mohun Bagan?s Round VIII NFL tie versus State Bank of Travancore (SBT), Roberto Mendes da Silva, popularly known as Beto, and Eduardo Coelho were seen playing with a stray dog in the club ground. 

With the team struggling in the premier competition, many may have prompted to write the two-time champions off as a contender to wrest back the title from current leaders East Bengal. But Subrata Bhattacharya chooses to tread a different path, reflected in that relaxed mood of the Brazilian duo. 

For the Mohun Bagan coach, it?s still a long way to go and he wants all those doubters to check history. ?In 1999, we had 22 points after the first phase (of the NFL). We can still attain those points this time also,? believed Bhattacharya. 

Mohun Bagan have 10 points from seven matches. 

A significant part of Bhattacharya?s hope for turnaround is based on the fact that Rennedy Singh is set to return in the final XI. 

While first-choice goalie Prasanto Dora will still be on the bench because of his injury, Nigerian Ajibade Babalade has recovered from the shoulder injury he suffered against JCT the other day. 

SBT, who are on seven points from as many matches, are optimistic. ?We have a policy of not playing foreigners, and it is not a disadvantage,? remarked SBT coach Mohammed Najeeb, who has been in charge of the team for the last 12 years. 

In Margao, Vasco and Churchill Brothers will go all out to register their maiden win on Wednesday, says PTI. Both teams, with two draws each, are struggling at the bottom.

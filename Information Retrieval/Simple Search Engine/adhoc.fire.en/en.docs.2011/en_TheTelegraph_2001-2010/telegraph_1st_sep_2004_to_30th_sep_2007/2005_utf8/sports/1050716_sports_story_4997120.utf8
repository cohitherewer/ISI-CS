 Sri Lanka may have split tour 

New Delhi: Sri Lankas first full-fledged cricket tour to India in eight years is likely to be split into two due to a cramped schedule. 

The Lankans may play the seven-match one-day series in the later half of October and return for three Tests in December. 

The proposal is there but it is not finalised yet. We will take a decision on the matter after discussing it with the principal office bearers of the Board, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said. 

India begin the season with a tri-series in Sri Lanka, where the West Indies will be the third team, from July 30 to August 9. 

The Indians then tour Zimbabwe from August 24 to September 24 as they compete in another tri-series against the hosts and New Zealand before playing the African nation in two Tests. 

That will be followed by the ICC Super Series from October 5 to 10, pitting world champions Australia and a Rest of the World side in three ODIs and a six-day Test. (PTI)

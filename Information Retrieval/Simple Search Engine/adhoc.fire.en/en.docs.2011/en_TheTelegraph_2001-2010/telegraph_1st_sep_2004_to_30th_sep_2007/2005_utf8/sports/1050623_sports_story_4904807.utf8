 Wadekar for transparency 

 Wadekar roots for selectors free hand in picking teams 

New Delhi: Former India captain and coach Ajit Wadekar strongly feels that the process of selecting teams should be transparent and there should not be any kind of interference from the BCCI in this regard. 

The selectors should be given a free hand in the process of selection. They should also be paid for the job they are doing. I am sure these measures will help a lot, said Wadekar, who was also the chief national selector. 

Pointing out that there was interference from the BCCI president in selection of teams in the past, Wadekar said, the president should ratify the selected team straightaway. It is a must. There has to be transparency in everything that the Board does. 

I strongly feel that naming of the captain should be left to the selection committee and there should not be any interference from any quarter, including the Board or its president, excepting in cases of discipline, said Wadekar, who led the country in 16 out of 37 Tests he had played during an eight-year career. 

Meanwhile, former India wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani has described the process of forming a committee in appointing Greg Chappell as the new Team India coach as a gimmick. 

A special committee appointing Chappell is a big gimmick. The team should also have its say in the appointment of the coach. After all, the players are going to work with him, he said.

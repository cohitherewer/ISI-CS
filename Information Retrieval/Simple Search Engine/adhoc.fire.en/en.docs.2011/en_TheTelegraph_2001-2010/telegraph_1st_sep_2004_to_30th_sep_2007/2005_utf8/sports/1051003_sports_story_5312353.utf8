The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Players must be paid well

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: It has come full circle for Syed Nayeemuddin as he was appointed senior national football coach for the third time on Sunday. 

Hours after landing one of the toughest jobs in Indian sport, the Dronacharya feels anything can be achieved with hard work and grit. 

But first, he says, players need to be paid well. 

If we expect performance worthy of international standards from our boys, they must be paid in accordance to those norms, Nayeem said, adding, something in the region of Rs 5 lakh per week (while doing India duty) would be a good beginning. 

As if to prove this wasnt a mere fancy, the new coach promised to take up the matter with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and sponsors at the next opportunity. 

On whether a longer term would have served him better, the Dronacharya said: I will call up the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi on Monday as I am yet to receive a formal notification? 

Being quite a disciplinarian, for the veteran coach star power is of no consequence. 

For me, all 30 of them are stars. Why should there be a problem? he posed.

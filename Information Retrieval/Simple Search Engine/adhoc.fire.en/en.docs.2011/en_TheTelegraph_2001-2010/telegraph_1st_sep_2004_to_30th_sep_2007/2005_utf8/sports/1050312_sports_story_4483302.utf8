The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Giant screen likely at Eden

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The second India-Pakistan Test at the Eden is likely to be seen giant-size. A giant-screen may be installed, for the first time to show on-field action for the March 16-20 Test. 

Such a screen had been on the anvil many times before, but the idea had to be scrapped because of crowd-trouble fears, the Eden crowd being known as being rather emotional. A source in the CAB said all preparations are being done for the installation. 

A renowned city hospital has been roped in for medical assistance during the five-day game. ?They (Apollo Hospitals) will be a part of our medical unit and they are expected bring all the modern amenities with them,? the source said Friday.

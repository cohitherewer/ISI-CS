The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We can fight, sans stars: Chanderpaul

 - First Test- Muralidharan back, yet Sri Lanka not complacent

Colombo: West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul has warned hosts Sri Lanka not to consider his under-strength team easy pushovers during the two-Test series starting here Wednesday. 

Sri Lanka, determined not to offend the visitors, say they expect a battle of equals in the first Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club even though form points to a one-sided contest in favour of the hosts. 

The West Indies go into the series shorn of most of their top stars, including one of the worlds leading batsmen, Brian Lara, due to a protracted sponsorship row with their cricket board. 

Chanderpaul, a veteran of 86 Tests, is the only one in the 14-man touring party to have played more than 10 Tests. Six are absolute rookies. 

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are geared for their 150th Test boosted by the return of prolific off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan after an 11-month absence due to a shoulder injury. 

We would not have been here if we did not think we could compete, said Chanderpaul, the only one in the team to have played a Test match in Sri Lanka before. This is a young bunch we have who are determined to make a name for themselves. They are very keen to get on with it. 

Dont write them off even before the series has started. Everyone needs a chance to prove themselves. 

The West Indies Australian coach Bennett King said it was an opportunity for the youngsters to stand up and deliver. 

You find diamonds in coal, said the former coach of the famed Australian Cricket Academy. It takes a little pain to get joy. West Indian cricket may be in a state of flux, but the system is in place for a brighter future. 

The West Indians got a taste of the daunting task ahead in the two-day practice match at the weekend when they were shot out for 110 and the hosts replied with 382 with Test batsmen Kumar Sangakkara (109), Thilan Samaraweera (95) and captain Maravan Atapattu (77) making merry. 

We are not complacent at all, said Atapattu. There is a Test match to be played and I am certain the West Indians are as much ready for the challenge as we are. 

Australian coach Tom Moody, looking to begin his stint with Sri Lanka on a positive note, said it was not difficult to be motivated for what could be a lame contest. Playing for your country is motivation enough, said Moody. I am very excited about the series because the players are raring to go.

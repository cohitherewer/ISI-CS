 Australia need an allrounder: Lillee

 - Symonds not good enough for Tests 

AUSTIN PETERS in MELBOURNE

 Age is catching up with McGrath, feels Lillee 

Australia wont beat England and win back the Ashes next winter unless they find a proper allrounder, according to Dennis Lillee. 

The legendary Australia fast-bowler, the scourge of England in so many Ashes series, said the selectors should drop Andrew Symonds, a player who enhanced his reputation in England last summer with a string of fine innings for Lancashire. 

An Australian daily quoted Lillee as saying that flaws in the side had to be rectified, and that Symonds was not good enough to play Test cricket. 

The iconic former fast bowler, who is associated with a pace academy in India, reckoned that Glenn McGrath would struggle to complete an Ashes series because he looked tired during the recent Test against South Africa at Perth. 

Lillee felt that playing Symonds as an allrounder, with Ricky Ponting reluctant to use his bowling, highlighted McGraths gradual deterioration as he approached 36. 

He said: If Australia want to employ an allrounder ? and they are crying out for a bowling all-rounder ? Symonds simply doesnt qualify. Australias draw with South Africa in Perth has surely shown the selectors that Ricky Ponting and his men are not yet ready to mount an Ashes campaign. 

Lillees concerns probably only underlined the growing unease among Australian supporters at the rise of Andrew Flintoff as a world-class allrounder in the England side, though McGrath recently said that Symonds was worth his place on fielding alone and coach John Buchanan felt he would perform better with less criticism.

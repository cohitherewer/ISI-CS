 Surya wins, stays in second spot

 - ABU DHABI CHESS

 Mixed day for Indians 

 Surya beat Sayed Mohamed in 39 moves 

Abu Dhabi: Grandmaster Surya Shekhar Ganguly continued to maintain his joint second spot after scoring an emphatic victory over Al Sayed Mohamed of Qatar in the third round of the Masters section of the 15th Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival here. 

Russian Grandmaster Konstantin Chernyshov defeated second seed Grandmaster Aleksej Aleksandrov of Belarus to emerge sole leader with three points from as many games. 

A pack of eight players, including top seed GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov Azerbaijan, follow the leader with 2.5 points each while another 20, including Parimarjan Negi are another half a point adrift. 

The Indians had a mixed day with Ganguly, Negi, Akshat Khamparia and M. B. Muralidharan coasting to victories while IM D. V. Prasad, Woman Grandmaster Tania Sachdev, IM-in-waiting Abhijit Gupta lost their respective games 

Surya was at his attacking best and simply outplayed Mohamed in the middle game that did look harmless for some time. 

The Sicilian Sveshnikov by Mohamed with black pieces posed some initial problems for the Indian, but his deep preparation came in handy in the end. Slow manoeuvreing in the middle game ensured the Indian sufficient play all over the board and eventually led to a devastating attack for black. 

It took Surya 39 moves to wrap the issue. 

Gupta was outplayed by GM Evgeny Gleizerov of Russia. Playing the white side of a Dutch stonewall, the Indian was in trouble in the middle game after an erroneous plan and never recovered. 

Gleizerov transposed to a favourable endgame and won a pawn to register a comprehensive victory after 59 moves. 

Negi had it easy against Ghader Pour Shayesteh of Iran who played white. The Indian first equalised easily and later capitalised on a technical mistake by Shayesteh to romp home. 

Tania was a trifle unlucky in losing to GM Igor Kursonov of Russia. A Kings Indian by transposition led to a slightly superior positon for Tania in the middle game but the Russian improved his position to equalise comfortably. 

In the minor pieces endgame, both players had little material but Tania found her king trapped on the edge of the board from a position that should have been an easy draw. The game lasted 58 moves. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ECB likely to consult players

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) director (cricket operations) John Carr and Professional Cricketers Association chief executive Richard Bevan are likely to have a round of discussion with the English players before officially objecting to a few venues for their tour of India early next year. 

They had, earlier, objected to three of the five venues for the ODIs scheduled for April next year. 

Carr and Bevan left for Faisalabad, where Engalnd will play their second Test commencing Sunday. They will discuss the matter with Michael Vaughan and Co. and then submit their report to ECB, who will then get in touch with BCCI to finalise the venues, a top BCCI source said on Friday.

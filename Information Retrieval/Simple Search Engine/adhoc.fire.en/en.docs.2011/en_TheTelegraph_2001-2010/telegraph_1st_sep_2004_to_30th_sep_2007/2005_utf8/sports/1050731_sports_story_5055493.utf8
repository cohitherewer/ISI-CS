Calcutta: Relegated from the elite division of the National Football League last season, Tollygunge Agragamis poor show continues. They came out second-best in their opening match of the CFL Premier Division, losing 1-2 to Eastern Railway at the Howrah Stadium on Saturday. 

Bapon Bera drew first blood for the railway outfit in the 21st minute. Tollygunge equalised through Bijoy Das in the 61st minute but conceded another in the 80th to return empty-handed. Binay Saha scored the winner. 

Tollygunge seemed to be in control in the second half and looked good for a point at least. But the railwaymen put pressure in the final quarter of an hour and Tollygunge faded before letting in the crucial goal.

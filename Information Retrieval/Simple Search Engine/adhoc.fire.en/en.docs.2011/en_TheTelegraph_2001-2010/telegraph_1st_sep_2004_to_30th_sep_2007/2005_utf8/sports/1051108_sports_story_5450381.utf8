The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Happy to finish: Mahato

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bimal Mahato finished 66th 

Calcutta: It wasnt quite a finish an athlete should feel proud of, but Bimal Mahato will be returning from New York with loads of experience and the determination that given another chance, he may challenge the worlds best. 

The Kharagpur-based runner became the first from the state to participate in the New York Marathon on Sunday. 

If competing with the likes of world-record holder Paul Tergat of Kenya was in itself a tough call, Mahatos task became more difficult in the face of inclement weather and a hamstring problem. 

The 36-year-old eventually finished 66th with a timing of two hours, 37 minutes and 31 seconds. 

I know its not a good performance. I pulled my left hamstring during practice and that prevented me from accelerating. 

Besides, I never had any experience of running in such a hot and humid condition, Mahato told The Telegraph from New York on Monday. 

Tergat surged to the title in 2::09:29.90 seconds, surpassing defending champion Hendrick Ramaala of South Africa (2::09:30.22) in the closest finish of the races 36-year-old history. Third place went to Meb Keflezighi of the US in 2::09:50. 

The womens race was claimed by Jelena Prokopcuka of Latvia. 

I was feeling the pain while running in the hills and had to slow down. And I was left with the option of speeding up while moving downwards. That, of course, didnt serve my cause as a whole, but Im extremely happy that I managed to finish the touch line, explained Mahato. 

Mahato was in the 29th position after 10km. Thereafter the strenuous journey began with the runners making their way up First Avenue in Manhattan and a series of similar upward trips. He had to drop back and crossed the half-way mark. 

Mahato ? who won The Telegraph Calcutta Marathon last year ? however was determined to finish the race. That was my motivation, he insisted. 

Ill be returning home with lots of experience? If Im lucky to compete here again, itll be a much better performance, he added.

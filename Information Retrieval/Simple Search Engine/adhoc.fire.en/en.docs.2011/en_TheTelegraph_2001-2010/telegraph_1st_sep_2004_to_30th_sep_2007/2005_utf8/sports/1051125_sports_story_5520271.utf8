 Inzy considered quitting

Faisalabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, who struck a century in each innings in the second Test against England, on Thursday admitted that he thought of quitting after his failure in the first innings of his comeback Test against Bangladesh. 

It was after being overlooked for nearly six months following the World Cup disaster. And when I was dismissed for 10 in the first innings, I thought this place does not belong to me, Inzamam said. The same night when I was out for 10, I discussed my plans with Saeed Anwar and he advised me to first play the second innings of the Test. (PTI)

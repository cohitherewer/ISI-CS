 Barrichello optimistic about Imola

 Barrichello is satisfied with the new Ferrari 

London: Brazilian Rubens Barrichello believes Ferrari?s new car will be reliable for the rest of the season after a troubled start for the Formula One world champions. 

?This car arrived a bit late and we just had to understand it fully,? an Italian newspaper quoted him as saying after a test session at the Mugello circuit. 

?Now we have done that, we have achieved greater reliability all round and I think that from now on we will have everything we need to finish races. 

?So there is also a lot of confidence for Imola,? he said, referring to next week?s San Marino Grand Prix at the circuit near Ferrari?s Maranello factory. 

Ferrari introduced their F2005 at the last race in Bahrain, bringing its debut forward by two races in response to Renault?s early season domination. 

Neither Schumacher nor Barrichello scored any points in that race, with the German making the worst start to a season in his career with just two points from three starts. 

Renault?s Spanish driver Fernando Alonso leads the championship with 26 points while his team will be chasing its fourth win in a row next week. 

Barrichello completed 86 laps on Thursday while seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher did 139 at Ferrari?s shorter Fiorano test track. 

A Ferrari spokesman confirmed Schumacher had suffered a hydraulic pressure problem but said it was no cause for concern and nothing different to any other testing glitch. 

?We should be really happy with the reliability,? said Barrichello. ?We have done so many laps with the same engines, we are really in good shape. 

?The car is undoubtedly quicker and more balanced. The traction and braking can still be improved a bit but there?s been a good evolution already from three weeks ago.? 

Ferrari, constructors? champions for the past six years, are in sixth place with just 10 points to Renault?s 36 but aiming to win at Imola. 

A spokesman said Ferrari had also made a step forward 

with their tyre partners Bridgestone. ?We have found something in the development 

of the tyres, nothing really major but which will improve the general situation.?

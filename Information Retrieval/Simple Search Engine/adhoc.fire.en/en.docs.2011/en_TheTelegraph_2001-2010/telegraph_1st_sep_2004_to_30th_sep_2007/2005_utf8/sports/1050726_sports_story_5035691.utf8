The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Not chasing world record, says Murali

Kandy: Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan Monday said he was not after Shane Warnes world record after demolishing the West Indies in the second Test here. 

The off-spinner grabbed eight for 46 as the tourists, set a huge victory target of 378, folded for 137 before tea on the fourth day. 

The 33-year-old now has 549 Test wickets from 93 matches, second only to Australian Warne, who took his tally to 589 from 124 games after the first Test against England at Lords. 

I think I have a long way to go before I can catch up with Warne, Muralidharan told reporters after the win helped Sri Lanka sweep the short series 2-0. 

Shane is a great bowler and he is bowling beautifully at the moment. Frankly, I do not think of the record when I go out there to bowl? Im not after it. My job is to bowl well and help Sri Lanka win. 

I have won quite a few matches for my country in the past and I hope I can continue doing that. As far as the world record is concerned, whichever of us plays longer will hold the record. It is as simple as that. 

Warne, at 35, is two years older than Muralidharan. The Sri Lankan wants to play on for another three to four years. 

I want to go on for some time, maybe three to four years. We have a lot of cricket in that period. 

Muralidharans 14th haul of 10 wickets in a match ? he claimed two for 37 in the first innings ? gave him 17 wickets in what was his first series in 11 months following a shoulder injury. I have no problem with my shoulder now, Muralidharan said. I am fit as I have ever been but it will take me time to get back to my best, he added. 

Muralidharan, whose brilliant career has been marred by accusations of chucking, says the controversy may never leave him. It is really hard to say if it will ever be over, he said. 

I know I have been cleared but people may have something new to say. They always do whenever I do well. I never know what will happen next. 

Muralidharan made up for the absence of left-arm seamer Chaminda Vaas, who has been ruled out of cricket for at least a week due to a hamstring strain. 

Vaasy is a great bowler but unfortunately he got injured, Muralidharan said. So it was my turn to fight for the team. The West Indian batsmen were a bit inexperienced so I just had to keep the ball in the right place.

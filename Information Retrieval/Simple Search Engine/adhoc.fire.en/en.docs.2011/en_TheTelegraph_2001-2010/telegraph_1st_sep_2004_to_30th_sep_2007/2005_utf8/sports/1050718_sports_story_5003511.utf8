 Harikrishna keeps lead despite loss

 - CHINA GMs MEET 

 Harikrishna went down to Motylev 

Taiyuan: World junior champion P. Harikrishna went down fighting against top seed Grandmaster Alexander Motylev of Russia in the eighth round of the second Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters meet here on Sunday. 

Despite the loss, Harikrishna maintained a full point lead over Motylev, who took his tally to 5.5 points. However, the Russian has an extra game in hand against Ni Hua of China and in case he wins it, he will catch up with the Indian. 

Bu Xiangzhi of China also garnered 5.5 points along with Motylev from eight games played so far. Wang Yue is half a point adrift of his compatriot, while Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine is fifth with 4.5 points. 

Just three rounds are left in this category 15 round robin tournament being played under Fides time control. 

After a good show in the first seven rounds, Harikrishna collapsed against a crafty Motylev who played the white side of a Berlin Defence popularised by Vladimir Kramnik. 

Motylev obtained a clear advantage by the 21st move, following which Harikrishna lost a pawn and an exchange to go down in 37 moves. 

The day produced only two other decisive games. 

Wang Yue continued with his new found form and grounded GM Tigran Petrosian of Armenia while former world junior girls champion Zhao Xue of China finally opened her account, thanks to some reckless play by GM Zhang Pengxiang. 

Yue came out well in the endgame arising out of a Tarrasch Defence against Petrosian who played black. 

Soon in the middle game Petrosian made a mistake and lost control of the black squares. Yues technique thereafter was sound as he won a couple of pawns to romp home in 49 moves. 

Xue played the black side of a Scotch Opening and capitalised on a calculation error by Pengxiang who first lost an exchange before allowing black a decisive advantage with an outside passed pawn. The game lasted 47 moves. 

The rest of the games ended in draws. Karjakin tried without much success against Luke McShane of Englandwhile Bu Xiangzhi was held by Dubai champion Wang Hao.

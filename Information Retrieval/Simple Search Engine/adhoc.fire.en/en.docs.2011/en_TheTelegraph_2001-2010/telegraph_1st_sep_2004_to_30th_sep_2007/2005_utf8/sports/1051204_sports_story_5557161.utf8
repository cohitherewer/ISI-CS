London: Arsenal slipped 14 points off the Premier League pace on Saturday when they lost 2-0 at Bolton Wanderers, while champions Chelsea were beating Middlesborough 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. 

John Terry headed his first league goal for a year after 62 minutes to take Chelsea to 40 points and keep them firmly on course to retain their title. 

Liverpool are second on 28 after beating Wigan Athletic 3-0 thanks to two goals by Peter Crouch. Manchester United have 27, with Tottenham Hotspur behind them on goal difference after a 3-2 home win over bottom club Sunderland. 

Arsenal and Bolton both have 26, first-half goals by Abdoulaye Faye and Stelios Giannakopoulos having given Bolton their eighth straight home win in all competitions. 

Middlesborough produced a spirited performance at Stamford Bridge, defending well and breaking dangerously to create more chances than the champions in the first hour. 

But Chelsea maintained their composure and got the breakthrough after 62 minutes when Terry headed home a Damien Duff corner. 

Boro continued to threaten but Chelsea were able to deal with the threat to make it eight home league wins in a row this season. Arsenal have found Reebok Stadium an inhospitable venue in recent seasons. They drew there in 2002-03, a result that just about ended their title hopes, drew again the following season and lost 1-0 last season. 

They fell behind after 20 minutes on Saturday when Faye headed Bolton into the lead and the second came after Gilberto Silva was caught in possession and Giannakopoulos, who got the winner last season, doubled the advantage after 32.Thierry Henry hit the post two minutes later but Arsenal were below their best and, with less than half the season gone, they can already give up any realistic hope of regaining the title. 

Conversely, Liverpools run of six successive wins, all without conceding a goal, has hoisted them into their highest position since December 2002. 

Peter Crouch opened the scoring after 19 minutes. His long-range shot looped high into the air via Wigan defender Leighton Baines and sneaked in under the bar after a weak flap by keeper Mike Pollitt who was later credited with an own goal. 

Crouch is claiming it but will be less concerned if he loses it having scored the second with a deft finish after a long ball from defender Steve Finnan. Midfielder Luis Garcia re-directed a Fernando Morientes header for the third 20 minutes from time. 

Tottenham had to work hard to get past Sunderland, Newcastle United drew 1-1 at home with Aston Villa and West Brom drew 0-0 at home with Fulham.

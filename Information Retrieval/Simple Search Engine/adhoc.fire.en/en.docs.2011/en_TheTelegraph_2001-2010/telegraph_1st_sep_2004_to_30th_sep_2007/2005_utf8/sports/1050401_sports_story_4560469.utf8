 ?Pele? may do the trick 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Imran Chisty?s six-week suspension, 

which begins from July 8, may not dampen trainer Daniel David?s spirit. The stable?s 

domination on Thursday was complete and it may spill over to Friday as some of 

Daniel?s runners, who have managed to conceal form in their previous outings, 

may come good.

 Senor Pele, for instance, is no pushover in the day?s feature event, the 1,400m Midnight Cowboy Cup. The ?terms? of the race heavily favour the Bangalore-migrant and with Chisty out to salvage some pride, the horse may come into money and win, too.

 The 1,200m Legal Steps Cup is, however, Vijay Singh?s for the asking. He has a brilliant sprinter in Serrafina running for the trophy against Daniel?s Noble Investment and Magical Strike. The Star Precision Cup may turn out to be a straight contest between Bharath Singh?s sparingly raced Sparkling Clear and Daniel?s Silver ?N? Gold who is yet to reveal his true form.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

Calcutta: Riding high on his heroics against East Bengal and instant celebritydom that followed, if Gley Yao Rodrigue was expected to brush aside the challenge of minnows Tollygunge Agragami, he didnt disappoint. 

The Togo World Cupper made it look ridiculously easy with a brace as a rejuvenated Mohun Bagan thrashed Tollygunge Agragami 2-0 in a CFL Premier Division match, sitting pretty with 12 points from four outings. 

However, in what may seem as warning signs for coach Amal Dutta, barring Yao, Bagan seemed short of ideas and frequently lost the plot upfront, creating chances galore without troubling the scorers. 

But who cares! The way the gallery responded every time the Togolese striker caught the ball, Bagan may have got someone to fill in the gap of Jose Ramirez Barreto. 

With his ability to turn in very little space, Rodrigue is a difficult man to mark, something Tollygunge found out pretty early. It was the 24th minute, when snatching a loose ball from the midfield, Eduardo Coelho extended an accurate lob to Rodrigue. 

Trapping it neatly, Rodrigue outpaced Tollygunge defenders and kept the ball in the far post, leaving no chance for the hapless goalie. 

The goal should have opened the floodgates, but the fact that it didnt owes as much to a sudden laxity from Bagan as to the Tollygunge defence, which hung on grimly led by Sheikh Azim, who was quite impressive. 

In fact, it was around this time (34th minute), when Tollygunge got their true chance of the day. Substitute Trijit Das attempt hit the crossbar as Subrata Pal lay on the ground, already having saved another shy at the goal. 

Apart from this, the game went on pretty much in the same pace, the substitution of Harvinder Singh for Manjeet notwithstanding. 

Dharamjit took a lot of workload, matched only by the peerless Basudeb, who reigned supreme with absolute command. Bagan defence never faced any real trouble and whatever little Tollygunge threw at them by way of attack, was incoherent to say the least. 

This is where the brilliance of Rodrigue comes in. When Bagan seemed settled for their 1-0 margin, and Tollygunge seemed resigned to their fate, as if from nowhere came the second goal. 

The seeds of Tollygunges trouble, however, lay in their botched-up attempts at suicide traps for Rodrigue, and it was only a matter of time before the Bagan striker made it count. 

Rajib Ahmed, who came in place of an unimpressive Sanjay Parte, tapped forward. The entire Tollygunge defence stood motionless thinking it to be an offside, and the Togolese striker placed it coolly past the advancing Pralay Dutta. The score was 2-0 at the 79th minute. 

Though Dharamjit through a solo effort had yet another shy ? which hit the crossbar ? towards the closing stages of the match, Bagan seemed content with their 2-0 lead. 

Coach Dutta had as much to say at the end of the match, when asked whether he was satisfied with the margin of win. 

Theres no reason to be otherwise, he shot back, adding, Though theres still a long way to go, the team spirit is quite high with back-to-back wins. 

On his new striker, Dutta seemed cautious: He needs more time to settle down? and if required, he may play in any position. Totality is what I am aiming at.

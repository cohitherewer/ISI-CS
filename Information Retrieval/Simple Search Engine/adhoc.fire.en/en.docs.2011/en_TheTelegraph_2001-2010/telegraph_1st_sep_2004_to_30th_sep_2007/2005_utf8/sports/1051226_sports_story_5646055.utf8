 Warne puts lot of pressure on Ponting

 - Smith says Aussie leg-spinner takes over captaincy at times 

 Smith feels Warne is frustrated for having missed out on Test captaincy 

Melbourne: South Africa captain Graeme Smith says Shane Warne tries to take over from Ricky Ponting when things get tough and questions some of the Australian captains tactics. 

Smith said on Sunday he thought Warne, a former Australia vice-captain, was frustrated that he never became Test skipper. 

I think more than anything else, hes probably disappointed with the fact that he has never captained in Tests, Smith said on the eve of the second Test at the MCG. 

Weve certainly noticed the pressure he puts Ricky under out in the field. Especially when things get tough, he takes over and puts them under a lot of pressure. Hes doubted his decisions a few times. Because Shane is offering so much advice, its hard to kind of sift through what is good and what is not good at times. 

We noticed it during the Ashes series also and its certainly something we picked up in the first Test (in Perth). 

Ponting was forced to defend his captaincy after losing the Ashes series 1-2. He often consulted Warne on the field regarding tactical decisions, leading to criticism that Ponting needed to be more assertive. 

Warnie is certainly a very focal guy in their team. Hes a big name, a big cricketer and a big performer for them, Smith said. 

He is a big, innovative guy. Hes got a lot of things going through his brain. But he can put his captain under a lot of pressure. Smith laughed off Warnes assertion that his own captaincy lacks imagination after South Africa made no attempt to chase down a world record target of 491 runs in four sessions in the drawn first Test. 

Warne wrote in a Brisbane newspaper: It (Perth) was pretty hard work for bowlers but there is not a lot of imagination with their captaincy. Its been a general trait of all (South Africa) captains over the years, especially Smith. Thats the way they play. 

Warne was stripped of the Test vice-captaincy in 2000 after a phone sex scandal with a British nurse. 

Smith said Steve Waugh, who retired in January 2004, was the type of captain who led from the front and told his players: do it my way. 

Ricky seems to be more of a nice team environment, with everyone contributing, Smith said. Everyone is going to do it their way. Ricky is trying too hard to find his own way of captaining. (AP)

 - It will take a good player to beat me at Open, says world No. 1

Melbourne: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday lauded Roger Federer as a standard-bearer who is lifting the sport to a new level, even as the game?s elite tuned-up for the Australian Open at the Kooyong Classic event. 

The eight-man special tournament at the former home of the Open boasts the best field in its history, with world No. 1 Federer heading an entry which includes eight-time Grand Slam winner Agassi, world No. 2 Andy Roddick and Britain?s Tim Henman. 

Agassi, a four-time Australian Open winner, praised Federer after the Swiss picked up his momentum from a record-setting 2004, beginning this season with a win in Doha. 

While avoiding a direct comparison of Federer with his own longtime rival Pete Sampras, elder statesman Agassi threw some perspective on games of the two greats. 

?Roger has been compared to Pete on many occasions,? he said of the Sampras, who won a record 14 Grand Slam titles. ?I?ve played both on days when I was convinced they were the best in the world. They both bring a phenomenal amount of weaponry to the court, they are a pleasure to watch.? 

?Playing against them, I had the best seat in the house ? both have the ability also to make me look like a spectator. 

?You have to be at your best. Roger has already taken a step towards accomplishing things that most of us just dream about.? 

Federer won his 14th title in succession Saturday as he beat Ivan Ljubicic for the Qatar Open for the 21st victory without loss dating to last season. The Swiss is a heavy favourite to retain his Australian Open title. 

?I prefer to be playing well coming in with a great season of 2004 and good start to 2005,? said Federer, who begins group play at Kooyong on Wednesday against Gaudio. 

The confident Federer predicted it would take ?a good player to beat me in Melbourne,? at the Open beginning Monday. 

?The last three years, I?ve had a good start to the season in Australia. This surface suits my game. If you can play well in Australia, it usually carries thro- ugh until Miami or so (in March).? 

Federer said that his new 10-week collaboration with Tony Roche as coach could bring more polish to his already formidable game. 

?I don?t have a plan as to when we will get started, but we will meet this Saturday,? he said of the Sydney-based legend, who will advise him on a limited basis. 

Meanwhile, former champion Jim Courier feels the field of challengers have just one, slim chance of wresting Federer?s Australian Open crown from the Swiss next week ? catch him cold. 

Only an early shock can prevent him from adding to his Grand Slam haul, he felt. 

?I think everyone has to be wondering ?How do you beat Federer??,? he said on Tuesday. 

?He?s not only beating guys, he?s crushing them, and I?m talking about guys in the top 10. He?s not even being pushed by a guy like Lleyton Hewitt, who was playing the second best tennis in the world at the end of last year. 

?I would like my chances playing against Federer more in the first couple of rounds than I would from the quarter finals on. You might be able to sneak in and get him early on, but if you catch him in the semi-finals, I think you?re pretty much done.? 

Courier added he was not at all surprised that the 34-year-old Agassi was still going strong. ?If he finishes another season in the top 10, why wouldn?t he continue?? he said.

 Di Stefano surgery on hold

Madrid: Former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stefano has had a bypass operation postponed because of fever. But doctors believe they will be able to carry out the surgery within the next few days. Medical staff at La Fe hospital in Valencia said the 79-year-old Argentine had a difficult night but his condition had stabilised and there was a good chance he would recover. 

Last night he had fever and we decided that the conditions were not the ideal ones in which to operate, head of cardiac surgery Anastasio Montero told a news conference on Monday. 

He was in a critical situation but is much better now and we are going to see how his condition remains over the next few days. His condition is not so bad, however, since we need to operate urgently with all the risks that entails, we believe it is better to wait until the conditions are more appropriate. 

It is a complex case because he is a diabetic and is 79 years old, but despite that Im optimistic and I think there is a good possibility of him making a recovery. 

He is conscious, aware of what is going on and doesnt need any artificial respiration. He is a strong man and it is clear that he has a great deal of inner belief. 

Di Stefano, Reals honorary president and record scorer, was admitted to hospital in Sagunto after suffering pains in his chest in the early hours of Saturday. He was later transferred to La Fe hospital in Valencia.

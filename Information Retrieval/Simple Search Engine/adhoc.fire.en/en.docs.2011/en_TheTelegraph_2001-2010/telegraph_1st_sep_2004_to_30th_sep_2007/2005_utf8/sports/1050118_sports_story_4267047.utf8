 Leko shocks Anand 

 Topalov is in sole lead 

Wijk Aan Zee: World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Hungarian Grandmaster Peter Leko in the second round of the Corus chess tournament here. 

Having drawn the first game against Russian Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk quite easily, Anand did not quite get in to his groove in his important encounter against Leko and lost after missing out on a tactical stroke. 

While Anand slipped down on the points table following the defeat, Grandmaster Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria shot into sole lead after defeating third seed Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Topalov took his tally to 2 points from as many games. Grandmaster Michael Adams of England also won his second round game, grounding Alexander Morozevich of Russia. Adams was placed joint second on 1.5 points along with Leko. 

With 11 rounds still remaining in this category-19, 14-player event being played under classical time control, Commonwealth champion Nigel Short of England, world?s best woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary, local stars Ivan Sokolov and Loek van Wely, Bruzon Lazaro of Cuba, Alexander Grischuk of Russia and former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine jointly shared the third spot with one point apiece. 

Anand and Kramnik appear way behind the leader at this stage with just half a point along with two other Russians, Morozevich and Peter Svidler. 

Anand who is looking for his third title on the trot here. The Indian stalwart, however, just did not get his rhythm right in the encounter against Leko. The loss was all the more demoralising as it came with white pieces. (PTI)

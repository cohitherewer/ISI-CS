 Mahindra, JCT in 1-1 draw 

Mumbai: JCT held former Durand Cup winners Mahindra United to a 1-1 draw in the ONGC Cup National Football League at the Cooperage on Monday. 

Both the goals came in the first half. JCT, who looked much fitter and faster than their hosts, drew first blood when their defender Harpreet Singh?s header off a flag-kick was bang on target when the match was 16th minute old. 

The visitors? joy, however, was short-lived as Abhishek Yadav equalised for Mahindra just two minutes later with a fine header off medio Jatin Bisht?s flag-kick. 

With Monday?s draw, Mahindra have 12 points from seven matches while JCT are on eight from as many matches. 

In fact, it was the visitors who came up with the first notable move in the 15th minute. JCT skipper Ram Paul?s free-kick, after his Mahindra counterpart S. Venkatesh had fouled on him on top of the box, beat custodian Sandip Nandy all ends up before one of their defenders managed to clear the ball in the nick of time. 

In the 30th minute, Bisht-Yadav combination almost put the hosts ahead but the former?s flag-kick, which was hit low and with lot of power, was headed over by Yadav. 

Koluthungan?s long ranger was well saved by a diving JCT custodian Mansuru Mohammed before halftime. (PTI)

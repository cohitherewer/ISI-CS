Shanghai: Russias Nikolay Davydenko joined Roger Federer in the last four of the year-ending Masters Cup on Wednesday after demoralising Argentine Gaston Gaudio. 

Davydenko triumphed 6-3, 6-4 for his second straight victory, the Russians accuracy prompting a frustrated Gaudio to break two rackets, much to the amusement of the Shanghai crowd. 

Davydenkos spot in the semis was sealed when Chiles Fernando Gonzalez beat Argentine Mariano Puerta 6-3, 4-6, 6-0. 

The result also ended Puertas interest in the troubled $4.45 million tournament. 

Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal pulled out with ankle injuries earlier this week to join tournament no-shows Andy Roddick, Marat Safin and Lleyton Hewitt on the sidelines. 

Agassi and Nadal were replaced by Gonzalez and Puerta. 

Davydenko, who beat Agassi 6-4, 6-2 on Monday, played down his chances of halting Federers march to a third straight title on a sticky indoor surface at Shanghais Qi Zhong Stadium. 

Its a big chance for me but this surface is very difficult, Davydenko, who is making his Masters Cup debut, told newsmen. 

If you dont concentrate you can get injured. 

For Federer, it doesnt matter what surface he plays on. He can play on ice. 

Gaudio slipped to 1-1 following his win over compatriot Puerta. Tormented by Davydenkos unerring groundstrokes, he spent much of the match stalking the baseline screaming at himself. 

A racket-smashing tantrum in the first set brought cheers from the Chinese fans and Gaudios temper barely improved. 

Last years French Open winner broke another racket after slumping to 1-5 in the second set. 

I think its normal in that situation, said Gaudio, who needs to beat Gonzalez in his final Gold group match to advance. 

Being 6-3, 5-1 and losing easily. Sometimes you cant control yourself... you do stupid stuff. 

Puerta was also close to exploding in his match and audibly swore at the umpire in Spanish after disagreeing with a line call that left him 0-2 down in the third set. 

Replays showed Gonzalezs ball to be good but the decision clearly rattled Puerta who suffered a complete meltdown. 

The first Chilean to appear at the season-ending championships since Marcelo Rios in 1998, Gonzalez now faces a showdown with Gaudio for a place in the last four. 

Five days ago I was on holiday and having fun. Two days I didnt think Im playing, said Gonzalez. Now I have a chance to be in the semi-finals. Its strange. Who knows? 

World No. 1 Federer became the first man to book a semi-final spot after beating Croatias Ivan Ljubicic on Tuesday. 

Only Ilie Nastase in 1971-73 and Ivan Lendl in 1985-87 have won three in a row at the season-ending championships. 

Meanwhile, Federer believes that criticism of a spate of pullouts from tournament organisers at the year-ending Masters Cup was fully justified. 

The world No. 1 refused to condemn Chinese organisers for calling into question Andre Agassis reasons for quitting the $4.45 million tournament earlier this week. 

I think criticism is allowed at this point, said Federer after making it two wins out of two in Shanghai on Tuesday. 

They signed a three-year deal. I understand the big disappointment from the government, from the tournament, from the fans. 

Agassi pulled out on Monday citing an ankle injury after hobbling to a 6-4, 6-2 defeat by Russias Nikolay Davydenko in his first match. 

The Americans withdrawal came after Spains French Open champion Rafael Nadal pulled out through injury. Andy Roddick, Marat Safin and Lleyton Hewitt were all Shanghai no-shows. 

Federer himself was on crutches just three weeks ago after hurting his ankle during practice. I came here not knowing if I could play and I went through the therapy just to really show the people how much this event really means to me, said the Wimbledon and US Open champion.

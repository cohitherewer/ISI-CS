 Akram: Pak should prepare bouncy tracks 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram advised Pakistan to prepare bouncy tracks in next months home series against India to unnerve visitors strong batting line-up. 

The advantage of pitches is with Pakistan, they have a transformed Shoaib Akhtar who can rock the Indians on hard pitches, Akram said. 

Akhtar, considered to be the worlds fastest bowler, took 17 wickets to help Pakistan beat favourite England 2-0 in a Test series early this month. With his pace and accuracy, Akhtar can target any Indian batsman, and more so Sourav Ganguly, said Akram, who took 414 Test and a world record of 502 ODI wickets. 

Former India captain Sourav was selected for the series against Pakistan after his ouster in the last Test match of Indias home series against Sri Lanka created a public furore. 

Akram said Pakistan would have to play positive cricket to avenge the home series defeat it suffered when India last toured Pakistan in 2004, their first since 1989-90. India won the Test series 2-1 and the ODI series 3-2, their first wins on Pakistani soil since they started playing against their neighbours in 1952. 

Pakistan, however, salvaged some pride by levelling a three-Test series 1-1 and beating India 4-2 in the one-day series this year. Pakistan are better organised than a year ago and can avenge their 2004 home defeat, but for that they will have to play positive, Akram said. (AFP)

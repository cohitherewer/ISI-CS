The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Woolmer under fire

Islamabad: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer on Wednesday came under fire from his predecessor, former captain Javed Miandad, and the media for his tactics on the first day of the Mohali Test as well as his ?preoccupation? with writing column in Indian newspapers. 

?A coach will train the batsmen well before the match, not when the match is on, and specially after they returned to pavilion after they got out. This is unusual and unheard off,? Miandad, who is a hosting special cricket show on Pakistan?s Geo TV said last night. 

Woolmer also came under flak from the media for writing a column in the Indian newspapers. 

?The BCCI has not permitted team coach John Wright to contribute to any newspaper ... And the Indian board obviously must have valid reasons for telling Wright to just concentrate on his job. But the Pakistan Cricket Board, in contrast, is apparently a big-hearted organisation,? a report in a daily said. 

Another daily headlined its story ?Woolmer turns coach-cum-columnist?.

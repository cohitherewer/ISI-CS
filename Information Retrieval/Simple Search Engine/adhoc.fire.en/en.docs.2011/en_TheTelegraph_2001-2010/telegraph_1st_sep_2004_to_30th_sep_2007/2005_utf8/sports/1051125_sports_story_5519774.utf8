The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im aspiring to be as accurate as McGrath, says Rudra Pratap 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Rudra Pratap Singh is just days away from his 20th birthday, but has already bagged one MoM award. Among the most promising of fast bowlers, the left-armer has even quickly earned a maiden Test call-up: Hes in the 15 for the first match against Sri Lanka. Singh spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to Fridays ODI at the Eden. 

The following are excerpts 

On his background 

I was born in Bara Banki, moved to Rae Bareli where my father (Shiv Prasad) worked in ITI? Then, to further my cricket ambitions, I went to Lucknow (Sports College and Hostel) in 1999? 

On whether he comes from a sports-inclined family 

Mere pehle to koi kuch khela hi nahin! Ive set a record. 

On whether fast bowling came naturally 

I suppose so? I cant remember being a batsman at any time when I was younger? Ive always been lifted by the josh which comes with bowling fast. 

On his idols 

Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath? The former for his ability to swing both ways at such pace; the latter for consistently landing the ball in that corridor of uncertainty? McGrath has the skill to pitch 99 out of 100 balls in one spot? Im aspiring to be as accurate as him. 

On coming through the ranks 

Ive worked hard and climbed step by step? Even for UP, I first played for the colts? 

On his coaches 

Deepak Sharma and S.P. Krishnan, both are in the Sports Hostel and College? Ive also worked with the coaches at the MRF Academy (Chennai) and the National Cricket Academy (Bangalore). 

On interacting with the peerless Dennis Lillee at MRF 

He would speak about the basics and said I shouldnt do anything with my action. He found it stress-free? Lillee Sir would also talk about mental toughness and suggest the training that needed to be done. That he narrated his experiences is what made the sessions fascinating. 

On the rather inauspicious start to his first-class career ? for Board Presidents XI versus New Zealand (in Rajkot) two years ago 

Unfortunately, I suffered an ankle injury? Earlier this month, though, I made amends by being adjudged MoM in the ODI against Lanka. 

On his excellent performance for UP and Central Zone last season 

I totalled around 70 wickets in first-class and limited overs matches. 

On what made the difference in 2004-05 

Confidence? Obviously, the previous seasons experience helped. 

On whether its frustrating to bowl in conditions which dont suit fast bowlers 

Youre right? Usually, I take the coachs help in working out the right areas? Quickly adjusting to the pace of the wicket is important and Im comfortable with less conventional fields, too. 

On whether he expected to be picked for the tri-series in Zimbabwe, earlier this season 

I wasnt sure as, being away in Brisbane (courtesy the Border-Gavaskar Scholarship), Id missed the pre-season Team India camps in Bangalore. I was, of course, confident of getting a break at some point in this season. Chance to zaroor milta. 

On his debut, versus Zimbabwe, at the Harare Sports Club 

I was taken aback when, on reaching the ground, Sourav (Ganguly) said I would bowl the first over? Gradually, I started becoming confident? After all, if the captain had so much faith, I couldnt let him or the team down? As it turned out, I got two wickets in my very second over. The umpires (Daryl Harper and Russel Tiffin) must have been impressed as they gifted me that ball. 

[Singh, incidentally, is the second UP player ? after Suresh Raina ? to make his debut this season.] 

On the recent ODI series against Lanka 

Maine theek-theek kiya? 

On having the ability to swing the ball both ways 

I can fire the inswinger with eyes shut, but need to improve on the away-going delivery. I was asked to modify my follow-through a bit (to make the outswinger effective) and that has helped. 

On pressure 

I only think of the job Ive got to do? Dont worry about anything else. 

On how he unwinds 

(Laughs) Time kahan milta hai! Matches, travelling, team meetings? Theres little for anything else? Im fond of Kishoreda and Rafisaab? Time permitting, I listen to them. 

On his interest in soccer 

Im a fan of Manchester United and Real Madrid? Where footballers go, I admire Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rio Ferdin-and. 

On his non-cricket hero 

The inspirational Lance Armstrong? Ive read his books? (After a pause) Also, to an extent, Mark Philippoussis. 

Finally, on his Calcutta connection 

I played for Howrah Union some years ago? Nobody took note then? Perhaps, I was destined to return in a somewhat bigger way.

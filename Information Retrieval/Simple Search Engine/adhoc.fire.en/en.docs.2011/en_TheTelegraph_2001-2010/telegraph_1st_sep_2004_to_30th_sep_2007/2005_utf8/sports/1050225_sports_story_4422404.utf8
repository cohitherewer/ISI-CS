 BCCI hopes Wright will stay till World Cup

 John Wright 's decision 

 is a personal thing, feels the skipper 

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary S.K. Nair said Thursday that the board will hold talks with coach John Wright about his future during the Test series against Pakistan. 

Nair said the board wanted a coach who would stay on through the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. 

?We would prefer someone who would be able to take the team forward till the World Cup,? Nair said. ?We hope to get a good person. If John agrees to be there till 2007, it will be very good.? 

The former New Zealand captain, who took over in October 2000, told reporters on Wednesday his future would depend a great deal on the outcome of the series between the traditional rivals. 

Meanwhile in Nagpur, Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly said that they would have to work hard to beat Pakistan in the upcoming series. 

?Pakistan are a good side and we will have to do very well on the field to win the upcoming series,? he told reporters after East Zone defeated Bangladesh in the Duleep Trophy match at the VCA ground here on Thursday. 

Asked about India?s prospects in the absence of Pakistan spearhead Shoaib Akhtar, Sourav said: ?The visitors have a number of good players and despite the absence of Akhtar, are still a strong side. We will have to work hard.? 

Talking about his knock (170) in the match, the captain stated: ?It?s very important for me to play domestic cricket after a long gap. 

?I batted for almost five-six hours and that?s good enough preparation for the forthcoming series. 

?International cricketers hardly get a chance to play domestic cricket and I utilised this before leading the side against Pakistan.? 

On Sachin Tendulkar?s fitness, the Team India captain added, ?He (Sachin) has already said in Hyderabad that he is fit. That means he is fit and there is no question about it. ?He is 100 per cent fit.? 

On coach John Wright, who is reportedly not keen to continue, the skipper said, ?He has a family back home and that is his personal thing.?

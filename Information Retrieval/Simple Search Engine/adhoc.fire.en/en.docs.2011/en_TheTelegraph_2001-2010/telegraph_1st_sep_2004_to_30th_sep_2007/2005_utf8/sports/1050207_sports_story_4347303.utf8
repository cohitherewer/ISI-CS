The Telegraph - Calcutta

Moyes has Merseyside masterplan

Guest column

Money from Rooney transfer was well spent

Manchester United?s win at Arsenal in midweek have 

given them a huge psychological advantage in the race for the Premiership runners-up 

spot and Liverpool?s meeting with Everton next month could prove as decisive in 

the battle for the last Champions League place. 

Given that Chelsea are so far ahead at the top, the 

contest between the two Merseyside clubs for fourth place looks more fascinating 

than the supposed one for the Premiership title. Everton, of course, have far, 

far exceeded any possible expectations when the season kicked off and a Champions 

League place would be a massive prize for them. 

For Liverpool, however, finishing fourth is their 

minimum requirement and would be seen by their fans as sneaking into Europe via 

the back door. Therein lies the heart of their problem. Liverpool have been such 

a great club and such a successful one for so long that it is hard for them to 

come to terms with the reality that, at present, they?re almost one of the also-rans. 

My mate, Alan Hansen, is not the only one who finds it hard to relate to the fact 

that things are not what they used to be at Anfield. Some supporters still seriously 

believe that Liverpool should be fighting with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester 

United for the title when, looking at their squad, that?s not a feasible proposition.

If you listen to the rumours, you might come to the 

conclusion that Everton improved their fortunes simply by getting rid of Wayne 

Rooney, who, according to urban myth, was a corrosive influence in the dressing 

room. Yet, I would not have thought that he was an unpopular boy there and in 

all my playing days, I can never remember a situation in which the majority of 

a team wanted a particular player out. 

I think that what might have happened at Goodison 

is that, in hindsight, Everton looked at the huge amount of money they got for 

Rooney and realised that they were fortunate to be able to use it to bring in 

players who, while of lesser ability, were in just the key positions they were 

weak in. 

Manager David Moyes deserves credit for identifying 

those players, for getting the team superbly organised and for forging a fabulous 

team spirit. It proves you do not necessarily need Roman Abramovich?s money to 

put together a good, competitive team. 

Both Merseyside clubs played their joker card in the 

January transfer window, Everton bringing in James Beattie from Southampton and 

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez signing Fernando Morientes. Beattie had a really 

good goalscoring record at Southampton, who are not one of the bigger clubs, and 

that says much for him. But now he is taking a step up and it is a question of 

whether he can handle it.

You certainly cannot compare him to Morientes, a proven, 

top-class striker who has played for big clubs throughout his career and who has 

a wonderful track record. He is a class act, a great player who has also had an 

international career that few can match. I can?t see him failing to get plenty 

of goals, but unless the results come with it, Benitez will find himself under 

increasing pressure, which is a bit unfair after less than six months. As I have 

said, expectations are unreasonably high at Liverpool, yet Benitez is a successful 

coach, he obviously knows what he is talking about and I don?t see the point of 

bringing someone of his stature in from Valencia and then putting him under pressure 

after a couple of bad results.

Having said that, I think he made a mistake playing 

a weakened side in the FA Cup, which lost the team momentum, because at times, 

in two and three-game spells, they have looked to be going in the right direction. 

When I spoke to Steven Gerrard the other day, he was singing Benitez? praises 

as a coach, although there is still constant speculation that Stevie could be 

at another club come next season.

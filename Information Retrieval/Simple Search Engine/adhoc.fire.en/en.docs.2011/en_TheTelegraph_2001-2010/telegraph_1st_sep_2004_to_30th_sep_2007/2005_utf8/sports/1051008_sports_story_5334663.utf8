The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 In India, the blame-game doesnt 

 touch the player

Stickwork 

Gurbux Singh

 Theres hardly anything happening 

 in Indian hockey now. The Indian Hockey Federation has stopped 

 organising all tournaments except for the Lal Bahadur Shastri 

 meet in preparation for the Champions Trophy in Chennai 

 in December. 

 I understand that coach Rajinder 

 Singh (Junior) is quite upset that only 20 players turned 

 up at the national camp. Hes also taken strong exception 

 to the fact that he has not been informed about the time 

 table and schedule of Indias commitments ahead of 

 the Champions Trophy. 

 As scheduled earlier, India were 

 supposed to play four or five Tests against Malaysia, but 

 surprisingly, the latter backed out. India are also supposed 

 to hold a four-nation meet later this month. Im yet 

 to know about the dates and participating teams in the meet. 

 This is not looking like the ideal build-up to a big event. 

 Across the border, however, a 

 new tournament promised to generate much interest. On similar 

 lines as Indias Premier Hockey League (held in Hyderabad 

 earlier this year), Pakistan now have their own Super Hockey 

 League ? in which six of our national players took part. 

 Dilip Tirkey (who played for Sindh Qalandars), goalkeeper 

 Adrian DSouza (Baloch Lions), striker Gagan Ajit Singh 

 (Capital Dynamos), drag-flicker Sandeep Singh (Shan-e-Punjab, 

 who started as favourites but ended third), midfielder Viren 

 Rasquinha (Frontier Falcons) and forward Arjun Halappa (Northern 

 Cavaliers) excelled in the meet.

 Dilip, in particular, was the 

 pick of the performers and Viren and Adrian played to their 

 reputation. Sandeep was quite successful in converting penalty 

 corners, but unfortunately, he missed the last two matches 

 owing to illness. 

 Some of our players also went 

 to play in the Dutch league. That these players performed 

 in competitions like these will hold them and the team in 

 good stead. India havent been doing well in the international 

 scenario in recent times. The upcoming Champions Trophy 

 presents a good opportunity in this context. Its up 

 to the players to show to the world where Indian hockey 

 actually stands. 

 Ill also be following the 

 results and performances of the players in the Lal Bahadur 

 Shastri meet. I firmly believe that coaching and training 

 camps cant be the real test of a team. Its only 

 match practice that puts a player to face the real challenge, 

 and therefore, allowing one to assess a teams strengths 

 and weaknesses. 

 Now lets focus on another 

 significant development that concerns not only hockey, but 

 other sports as well. Rajinder had exploded (during the 

 mini World Cup in Amstelveen) saying that some big-headed 

 seniors should quit the game. In football, the experimentation 

 of hiring a foreign coach has yielded little result and 

 another coach has had to pay for the teams poor performance. 

 And then there is the Sourav Ganguly-Greg Chappell face-off. 

 The relationship between the coach and his players is at 

 the core of such issues and the game, in effect, will suffer. 

 No team worth its salt can have 

 prima donnas. Theres no gainsaying the fact that any 

 game needs stars to carry it through successfully from one 

 generation to another. But a star should not be larger than 

 the game. He may be a Dhyanchand or a Don Bradman, but in 

 essence, hes merely a part of the institution. 

 Its somewhat different in 

 the Indian system. Here coaches are changed every one or 

 two years because they are made to be the scapegoat whenever 

 the team fails to meet expectations while the usual blame-game 

 hardly touches the players. 

 This is a malady in the system. 

 On the one hand, this leads to players starting to believe 

 that they are untouchables. On the other hand, coaches have 

 their own ideas. In trying to implement them, the men in 

 the hot seat find it difficult to bring such star 

 players to book. I wont say theres an out-and-out 

 lack of co-operation from the players end, but egos 

 of the two often lead to a pretty unsavoury situation. 

 One of Indias greatest coaches 

 was once told by a senior player that you may not 

 be there next time, but Ill still be playing. 

 That tradition of questioning a coachs credentials 

 as well as duration ? blissfully ignoring that it is the 

 players who perform in the middle and, therefore, must share 

 responsibility for a bad show ? is still on. 

 Interestingly, what Rajinder had 

 said of some big-headed players, had all the 

 ingredients of blowing into another Sourav-Chappell issue. 

 But hockey has lost its erstwhile glory in India and lacks 

 in money and exposure. So, it didnt invite any concrete 

 investigation like what we have seen in cricket. 

 Now many people are talking about 

 the utility of appointing a foreign coach. No doubt, India 

 have a different culture, behaviour and work ethics. If 

 that be the case, we shouldnt look for foreign coach 

 at all. The people who select the coach, better keep this 

 in mind. 

 Ill sign off with my own 

 experience in the hot seat. In the mid 70s, during 

 my stint as national coach of the French team, I had observed 

 from close quarters the working of European coaches. They 

 used to be respected as someone akin to the traditional 

 Indian guru. More or less, the same degree of regard is 

 accorded to the coaches there still today... be it in hockey, 

 football or other games. 

 I wish coaches in India did have 

 the same experience!

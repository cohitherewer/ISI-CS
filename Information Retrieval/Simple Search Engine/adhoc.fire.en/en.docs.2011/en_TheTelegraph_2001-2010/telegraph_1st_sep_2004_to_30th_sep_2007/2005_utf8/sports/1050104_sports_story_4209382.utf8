Calcutta: This is, you may call, the stuff 

cricketing grace and glory is made of. 

On Sunday, Sourav Ganguly and Devang Gandhi showed the way, injecting a fighting spirit into Rohan Gavaskar amp; Co., staring down the barrel. On Monday, someone called Mr. Laxmi Ratan Shukla decided to rise to the occasion, stood firm in the face of an enormous challenge and eventually guided the beleaguered Bengal to safety zone. 

So what was bordering on nothing but a miracle, turned out to be an astonishing, though, well-deserved finish for Bengal as they survived the relegation-threat by hair?s breadth. At 1.06 pm at the Eden, when Shukla played a sweep-shot to the fine-leg and collected three runs, Bengal?s waiting for the moment came to an end in an otherwise disastrous season. Because that effort from Bengal?s most prolific run-getter in the past couple of seasons took his side past Madhya Pradesh?s 392 and towards the holy grail of a first-innings lead. 

The way Shukla had taken the third run with his hands up in the sky, a late entrant in the stadium would have thought him celebrating an outright victory. Nay, that run was probably more precious than a win. It saved Bengal and with the team, may be careers of some youngsters. 

Poor Madhya Pradesh did everything to stay in the hunt, holding the sway over the hosts for the first couple of days. But cricketing god had other destiny to offer them as Amay Khurasia and company had to return with the thought of starting again, this time from the Plate division. 

Bengal finished their league outings with six points from seven matches and Madhya Pradesh were pushed to the bottom of the table with four. 

Bengal?s innings eventually folded at 397 ? managing just a five-run first-innings lead ? when the hero in Shukla fell prey to Y. Golwalkar delivery after a spectacular 81. As he charged down to the bowler for a big one, he misjudged the line of the ball and Naman Ojha gladly accepted the offering from behind the stumps. 

If there was a beginning on the final day, it did not at all bode well for the hosts. 

Devang perished in the third over of the day, having been bowled by offie Sunil Dholpure without adding anything to his overnight score of 77. 

It was now left to Shukla to keep Bengal?s hopes, however fragile they appeared to be at that time, floating. 

Utpal Chatterjee joined him in the middle and was playing a sensible innings. The veteran, who came out of retirement just to help his state?s cause for this match, stayed for 89 minutes and faced 52 deliveries. On the other hand, Shukla kept the scoreboard running. Utpal survived a couple of chances, one when he was yet to open his account and the other on four. The left-arm spinner finally ran out of his luck with a personal score of 15. Bengal were 341 for eight and in came Ranadeb Bose. The lanky bowler, in fact, played a huge role in Bengal?s cause. 

He might have scored only three runs, but Ranadeb?s priority was to defend and provide Shukla most of the opportunities to gather runs. 

Ranadeb?s three runs came off 61 balls and in 103 minutes, but it didn?t escape anybody?s notice that his partnership with Shukla produced vital 38 runs. Even only one man Shib Shankar Paul sitting in the dressing room, Shukla didn?t make any compromise on his shots and played all around the wicket. In a 273-minute stay, he caressed every corner of the park with elan and elegance. 

Shukla was calm and composed and strategic as well. He started taking the singles in the last balls of every over to keep the strike on. 

Meanwhile, Ranadeb glanced a Jitendra Likhar delivery. With 379 for nine, Paul came in. Shukla, again, showed his character, en route to scripting the amazing feat.

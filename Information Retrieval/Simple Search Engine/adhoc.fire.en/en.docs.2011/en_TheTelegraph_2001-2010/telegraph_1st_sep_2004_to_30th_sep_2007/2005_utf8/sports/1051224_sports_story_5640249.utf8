Calcutta: Defending champion Joseph Chakolas dream of retaining his title was trampled by Gaganjeet Bhullar, in the quarter finals of the Goodricke East India Amateur Golf tournament at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Friday. 

Bhullar defeated Chakola, 2 and 1 to book his berth. 

Sanjeev Mehra caused yet another upset by stopping Gagan Verma after a long battle, with a birdie on the 20th hole. Mehras giant-killing act continued from Thursday, when he had knocked out Jaskeerat Dullet in the pre-quarters. 

Completing the semi-final line-up were Simarjeet Singh, who beat Vikram Verma 2 and 1, and Himmat S. Rai, who came from behind to overcome Shaurya Singh 3 and 2. 

Bhullar went on the offensive straightaway, going one-up on the first hole, and doubled the distance over Chakola on the sixth. Chakola pulled back with a birdie on the 11th, but landed in the tank on the 13th. Chakola birdied the 15th as well, but that wasnt enough. 

Rai recovered brilliantly from a very dicey position to enter the semis. He went 1-up on the first, but then fell to a double bogey on the third, to get back to all square. Shaurya then birdied the fourth, and Rai went one down. 

After drawing level on the seventh, Rai swung from a bogey on the eighth (one-down), to birdies on the 10th, 14th and 15th. A par on the 13th gave him a place in the semi. 

In the semis, Mehra will take on Rai, while Bhullar will face Simarjeet. 

Results (quarter finals) ?? Gaganjeet Bhullar bt Joseph Chakola 2 amp; 1; Simarjeet Singh bt Vikram Verma 2 amp; 1; Sanjeev Mehra bt Gagan Verma (20th hole); Himmat S Rai bt Shaurya Singh 3 amp; 2.

 Eto begs forgiveness

Madrid: Barcelona striker Samuel Eto has begged for forgiveness over his insulting comments about his former club Real Madrid during Barcelonas title celebrations. 

The 24-year-old Cameroon international, the leading scorer in the Primera Liga, chanted Madrid, cabron, saluda al campeon (Madrid, b****, hail the champions) into the microphone during a speech at the Nou Camp on Sunday. 

Many of the 100,000 fans at the stadium to celebrate the clubs first league title in six years joined in the chorus. 

I would like to ask forgiveness for what I said, Eto told a news conference on Monday. One thing is what you think and another is what you say. I would like to ask the fans, the club and anyone else who might have felt offended to accept a thousand apologies from me. I never wanted to show any lack of respect to anyone. 

What happened was that in a moment of joy I started to sing and that was all. If it hadnt been for Real Madrid I would never have got this far, so I beg forgiveness and hope that people will understand me. 

Etos behaviour during the title festivities met widespread criticism.

 Big win for Orissa

Indore: Madhya Pradesh cruised through to the semi-finals of the Ranji Trophy Plate Division, crushing Jammu and Kashmir by 10 wickets to top Group B. 

In their second innings, the visitors collapsed to the bowling of Sanjay Pandey, who took 12 wickets for 70 in the match. 

In Cuttack, inspired bowling by Debasis Mohanty (five for 21) helped Orissa crush Himachal Pradesh by an innings and 293 runs on the last day of their Group A Plate match. Orissa secured five points from the tie, including a bonus point. 

Resuming at 38 for three, no Himachal batsman could cope with the medium pace of Mohanty or the guile of left-arm spinner Sourav Sehgal.

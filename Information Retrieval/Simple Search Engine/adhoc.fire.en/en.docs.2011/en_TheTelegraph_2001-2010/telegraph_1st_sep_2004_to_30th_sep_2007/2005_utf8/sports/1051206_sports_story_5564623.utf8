 Joydeep bags maiden gold 

Hyderabad: Joydeep Karmakar of Railways won his maiden gold with a tally of 695.3 in the 49th National Shooting Championship here on Monday. 

Karmakar entered the finals of the 50m rifle prone arena with a four-point lead over Abhinav Bindra and emerged the winner. 

I knew I was winning, but I was still tense since it was my first final, Karmakar, who will turn 27 on Wednesday, said. 

 Bindra scored 693.6 to claim silver. Surinder Singh Rathore bagged the bronze with a total of 692.6 points. 

I am satisfied with my performance. I began practising for this event only four months back and shot 102.6 in the final. It was a good score, Bindra said. 

Rifle prone is a very tough event as luck plays a major role in it. I will not be surprised if I do well in international competitions, he added. 

CISF inspector Samresh Jung won gold in the 10m air pistol. 

Sushma Singh won gold in the 25m sports pistol in both the individual and team level of the womens category.

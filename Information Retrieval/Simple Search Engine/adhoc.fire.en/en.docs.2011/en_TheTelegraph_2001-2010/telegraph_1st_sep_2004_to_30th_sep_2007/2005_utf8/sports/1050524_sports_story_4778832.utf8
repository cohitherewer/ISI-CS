Calcutta: With nothing to gain, East Bengal may find themselves trudging an unusual terrain when they host Nebitchi FC of Turkmenistan in their final group engagement of the AFC Cup meet on Wednesday. 

Only on Saturday, Subhas Bhowmicks boys lost the National League crown to Dempo SC and more than that, a loss to Vasco SC meant they would also miss out on competing the AFC Cup next season. 

[From group A of the AFC Cup, Al Faisaly of Jordon and Nebitchi have already booked their berth in the next round.] 

Add to this the fact that the domestic season is coming to a close (next months Super Cup between Dempo and Sporting Clube de Goa being the current seasons final competition) and some of the players are willing to shift base with the transfer windows set to open soon. 

All this may point ones attention to the fact that East Bengal may be seriously in dearth of motivation against the Turkmenistan visitors. But Bhowmicks team, lying last in the four-team group with one draw and one win, can be misleading too, if judged by appearance and their light practice on Monday. 

In Turkmenistan, Bhaich-ung Bhutia amp; Co. went down 2-3 and in that defeat may lie the ember of East Bengals brui-sed pride. Always great fighter, Bhowmick is sure to sign off the ordinary season on a winning note.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Former players hail Chappell appointment

 - He should be asked to look after India A as well: Dilip Vengsarkar 

 Vengsarkar 

Former Indian cricketers welcomed the appointment of Greg Chappell as Team India coach. Heres what they had to say: 

Arun Lal: Chappell is the right man to take over from where (John) Wright left. Australian cricket has a different dimension. I think his selection will bring new thought process and ideas into the game. 

Ashok Malhotra: I think it was almost a foregone conclusion as Chappell stood out in terms of experience and knowledge. 

Chandu Borde: Greg Chappell is well acclaimed by a lot of knowledgeable people and technically too hes sound. Lets hope his contribution tactically would be of immense help to the Indian cricket team. Hes highly respected and will command respect from the players too. 

Dilip Vengsarkar: He is an excellent choice. Chappell was a great player of the 1970s and 80s with a fantastic international record and tremendous international experience. Hes a man of stature and is experienced in coaching Australian domestic sides such as Queensland. I feel he should also be asked to look after the India A team in order to know the fringe players better. He may be asked to do so whenever the Indian team is free of international commitments. 

 Viswanath

Gundappa Viswanath: Its good for the team. Chappells selection should help the players. He will put in his efforts. But Chappell cant play in the middle. Consistency from the team is important. The team would benefit from his expertise and experience. 

Jawagal Srinath: He has a good stature, and is a highly respected individual. He is also very articulate. It appears that Chappell thinks for contemporary cricketers. 

Syed Kirmani: I am sure he is going to be a very purposeful and useful coach. Chappell was a professional captain during his playing days, a hard task-master and he took every match seriously. He led from the front and is vastly experienced. I am sure the team members would enjoy his coaching.

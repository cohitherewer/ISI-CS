 Border quits as selector

 Border says he has other commitments 

Sydney: Former Australian captain Allan Border on Wednesday resigned as a national cricket selector, Cricket Australia said. 

Border joined the selection panel in February 1998, and along with chairman Trevor Hohns, David Boon and Andrew Hilditch, shaped Australia?s world-beating Test and one-day teams. 

The former captain cited growing commitments away from the selection table for his decision. ?I?ve thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of being involved with Australian teams over the past few years, witnessing the success that both the Test and one-day teams have achieved,? Border said in a CA statement. 

?It?s certainly been a rewarding role, particularly when it comes to seeing a tough selection pay off, and to see a player come into the side and make the most of an opportunity presented to him. 

?Although I am still enjoying the involvement, the role of selector is a big time commitment that takes you away from home on a regular basis.?

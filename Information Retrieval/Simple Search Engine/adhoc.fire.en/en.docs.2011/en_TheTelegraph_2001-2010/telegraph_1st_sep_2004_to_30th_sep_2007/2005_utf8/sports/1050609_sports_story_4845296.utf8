The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thursday, June 09, 2005 

 London: Liverpool?s Harry Kewell libel action case against former England captain Gary Lineker began at the High Court on Wednesday, following comments about the Australia midfielder?s move to Liverpool in 2003. Both men were in court for a case in which a jury must decide whether a newspaper article written by Lineker after Kewell?s switch from Leeds United was libellous.

 The article said Kewell and his agent Bernie Mandic had ?cleverly circumvented? rules on transfer negotiations, criticising the Australian for a deal that earned Mandic a fee of ?2 million ($3.68 million). Kewell?s counsel Andrew Monson told the jury that the article met the legal tests necessary to render it defamatory.

 In addition to suing Lineker, Kewell is also suing The Sunday Telegraph publishers and their sports editor, John Ryan. All three deny the article was defamatory.

 Paris: France former coach Jacques Santini has joined Ligue 1 side AJ Auxerre, replacing Guy Roux who retired on Sunday, the club said on Tuesday.

 Santini, 53, had been jobless since quitting Tottenham Hotspur on November 5.

 The retirement of Guy Roux, 66, on the day after Auxerre clinched their fourth domestic cup left room for Santini to return to a coaching position.

 Beijing: A wealthy comedian has taken over as chairman of China?s Super League team Liaoning. Zhao Benshan, famous for his portrayals of yokels, was sworn in to great fanfare on Wednesday. ?I?m getting into football and I?m confident the fans will come back,? Zhao was quoted as saying by the website news.sina.com.cn.

 Zhao, also a provincial delegate to China?s parliament, was appointed after agreeing to lease the club land to set up a training base in exchange for a small stake.

 Lisbon: Lisbon: Jose Mourinho, who led Chelsea to their first Premier League title in 50 years, is to be honoured with Portugals highest order, a presidential spokesman said on Wednesday. 

 President Jorge Sampaio will declare Mourinho a high officer of the Order of Infante Dom Henrique in a Portugal Day ceremony on Friday in the northern city of Guimaraes.

 Auckland: Plans for British and Irish Lions fans to establish a permanent party base in Auckland for the Test series against the All Blacks have been approved by the local city council.

 The ?Barmy Army? which has grown out of the original group of dedicated followers of the England cricket team, already have a NZ $500,000 specially converted mobile trailer that is travelling to every match venue on the 11-game tour.

 The fans had hoped to set up a permanent base from Wednesday on Auckland?s waterfront. However, a newspaper reported on Wednesday that planning permission had been granted for the venue to open on June 25, the day of the first Test between the Lions and All Blacks in Christchurch.

 New Delhi: Armaan Ebrahim, who made history by becoming the first rookie to win a round in Formula BMW Asia series championship, has been concentrating on his fitness to carry forward his good work in Rounds V and VI to be held in Thailand this weekend.

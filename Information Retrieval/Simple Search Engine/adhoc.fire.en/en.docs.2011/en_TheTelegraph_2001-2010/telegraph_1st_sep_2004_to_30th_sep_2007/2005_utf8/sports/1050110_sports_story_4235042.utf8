The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Players? calibre has made my job easy: Sourav

 Having lost a league footballer to the tsunami has, 

 perhaps, nudged them into turning out in bigger numbers. 

Everyone here has, at some point in time over the last fortnight, spared at least a thought for those made to pay for no fault of theirs. 

Actually, Australian (and ICC XI) captain Ricky Ponting mirrored the sentiment of most countrymen when he said he ?felt? for those particularly affected in Galle and Chennai, two cities visited by his team in the past 11 months. 

On the field, though, it?s unlikely that Ponting?s men are going to show any generosity. Indeed, not having to contend with Sachin has given the ICC XI the edge. Shoaib Akhtar?s pull-out hasn?t helped Asia either. 

The task appears daunting, but captain Sourav Ganguly is upbeat ? publicly, at least. 

Talking exclusively at the Grand Hyatt, he remarked: ?At the end of the day, we want a good contest... Leading players from different countries isn?t a problem as all are outstanding... Their calibre has made my job easy.? 

Barring Darren Gough, nobody from the ICC XI turned up for nets at the St Kilda Club?s Junction Oval ? not even the club?s trophy-player, Warne. In fact, the West Indians and Matthew Hayden are expected early tomorrow only. 

The Indians and Sri Lankans (except Maravan Atapattu, who has pulled out for personal reasons), however, did work out for almost 90 minutes. Pakistanis Yousuf Youhana and Abdul Razzaq stayed away, claiming Bob Woolmer made them train ?very hard? in Adelaide yesterday. 

The Sri Lankan captain, by the way, wouldn?t have played even if he didn?t go the Akhtar way. 

Woolmer, also coaching Asia, was present throughout the session and had a tactical-chat with Sourav. It?s to be seen, though, whether their strategy to keep the rest of the world at bay is successful. 

 Equally, it?s to be seen if coach Steve picked up 

 enough during his ?spying? mission (at the Junction Oval) 

 to make the ICC XI game plan that much more invincible.

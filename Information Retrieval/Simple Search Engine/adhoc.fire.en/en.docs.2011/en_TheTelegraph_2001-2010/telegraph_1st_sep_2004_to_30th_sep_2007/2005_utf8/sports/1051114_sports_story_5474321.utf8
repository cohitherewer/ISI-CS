 India slam nine past Pakistan 

New Delhi: Inspired by a four-goal burst from Khangembamthoi Singh, India annihilated Pakistan 9-0 in the first match of the Asian Football Confederations under-17 qualifier here on Sunday. 

The Manipuri lad opened the scoring in the 10th minute when he evaded the rival defence to put the ball past Pakistani custodian Zaid Afridi. 

Mohammed Moazzam doubled the lead three minutes later when he shot home from close range. 

The twin strikes seemed to rattle the Pakistanis and when Afridi brought down Singh in the box to concede a penalty, he was also shown a yellow card. Malasawmdawngliana promptly put the side 3-0 up. 

On the half-hour mark, Singh got behind the rival defence to score two quick goals. 

Pakistan coach Shamim Khan took off Afridi in the goal and brought in Muhammad Irfan in his place but that did not change their fortunes as before the referee blew the half-time whistle, they conceded two more to be down 0-7. 

Singh got his fourth with a bullet shot from outside the box while Lalawmzuala also got on the scoresheet. 

Mintu Boro got the eighth in the 55th minute before Moazzam finished the scoring in the 78th minute. (PTI)

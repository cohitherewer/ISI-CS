Harare: Irfan Pathan grabbed a career-best seven-wicket haul as he ripped through the fragile Zimbabwe top-order to put India in the drivers seat on Day I of the second and final Test on Tuesday. 

The left-arm speedster produced another devastating spell of swing bowling to skittle out the hosts for a paltry 161 in just 44.2 overs, returning with dream figures of seven for 59 to steal the limelight on the opening day at the Harare Sports Club ground. 

Opener Gautam Gambhir then took centrestage with a rollicking unbeaten 95 as the visitors reached 195 for one at close, taking a lead of 34 runs with nine wickets intact. 

Rahul Dravid, giving Gambhir company, was on 49 in what turned out to be a highly satisfying day for the Indians after putting the Zimbabweans in to bat on a track which provided some assistance to the seamers. 

The hosts could not really negotiate the left-arm swing bowling of Pathan who had also tormented the Zimbabweans in the first Test in Bulawayo where he scalped nine wickets. 

Barring Charles Coventry who top scored with a 32-ball 37, none of the home team batsmen could survive for long though they did quite well to cross the 150-mark after tottering at 31 for four at one stage. 

The Zimbabwe innings lasted barely three hours as Pathan kept picking up wickets at regular intervals to capture his fifth five-wicket haul of his career. 

Ghambir is in sight of his second Test ton and so seems to be the intent of Dravid as the two have put on 120 runs for the unbroken second wicket after Virender Sehwag (44) provided his usual but brief cameo of a run-a-ball 44. 

Zimbabwe were asked to take first strike on a juicy wicket and it appeared too much for them to cope with the swing of Pathan who took three wickets inside his first six overs. 

Zimbabwe, 75 for five at lunch, lost the remaining wickets in a little over an hour on resumption as Pathan added four more scalps in his kitty to finish with best-ever figures in his nascent career. 

The hosts were destined to do all the running after losing their first four wickets for 31 runs as slips and wicketkeeper did some catching practice. 

Harbhajan Singh too helped himself to a couple of scalps which appeared a bounty given the speed with which Pathan was going through hosts line-up. 

Both Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan did not get to bowl again in the second session as wickets continued to fall rapidly. 

India started soundly and had progressed to 43 for no loss by the tea break. 

Sehwag opened out after tea and looked ominous before umpire Darryl Harper ruled him out caught behind, a decision, which can best be described as outrageous. 

Gambir though was in no mood to let go on the easy pickings and some of his drives and cuts were sumptuous to watch.

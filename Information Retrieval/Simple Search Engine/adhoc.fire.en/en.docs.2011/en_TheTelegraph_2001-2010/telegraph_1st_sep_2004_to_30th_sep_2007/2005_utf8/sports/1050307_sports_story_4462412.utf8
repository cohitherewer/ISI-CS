 Kahlon manages 5th spot

Phuket: India?s Harmeet Kahlon and Jeev Milkha Singh faded away on the final day, as New Zealand?s Richard Lee struck it big at the $500,000 Thailand Open on Sunday, winning his maiden Asian Tour title. 

Kahlon carded a final day 74 faltering on the back nine with a two-over 38 after a par 36 on front nine to finish fifth. Jeev shot a six-over 78, which included a triple and a double bogey to finish tenth. 

Jeev birdied the third but triple bogeyed the fifth and then bogeyed the 11th and 14th and ended a miserable day with a double bogey on 17th for a 78 and a total of two-under 286. 

31-year-old Lee carded a final round of two-under-par 70 on a windy and blustery day at Blue Canyon Country Club to tie overnight joint leader Barr on nine-under-par 279.

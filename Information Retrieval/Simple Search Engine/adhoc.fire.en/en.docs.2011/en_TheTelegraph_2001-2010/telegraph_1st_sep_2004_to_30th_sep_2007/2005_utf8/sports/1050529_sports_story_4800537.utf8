 Johl up to tied 5th 

Seoul: Amandeep Johl recovered from an early lapse with a card of two-under 70 to move into tied fifth position and give himself an outside chance of winning the $500,000 Maekyung Open at the Nam Seoul Country Club. 

Johls 70 took his total to three-under 213 as Koreas Choi Sang-Ho leads the field with eight-under 208. 

Johl will be hoping for a last round surge to take him to his maiden Asian Tour title. I am playing well and lets see what happens on the final day, he said. 

Shiv Kapur managed only a five-over 77 after a five-over 41 on the back nine. Kapur at 10-over 226, is tied 65th. Kapur had two birdies, five bogeys and one double bogey in his card. (PTI)

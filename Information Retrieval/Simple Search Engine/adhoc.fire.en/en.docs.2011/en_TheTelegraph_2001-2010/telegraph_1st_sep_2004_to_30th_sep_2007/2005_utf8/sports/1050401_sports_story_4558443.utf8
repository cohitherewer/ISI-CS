 Tokyo: North Korea may face disciplinary charges after a furious row with the referee sparked crowd violence at a World Cup qualifier, an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) official said on Thursday.

 AFC general secretary Peter Velappan condemned the trouble during North Korea?s 2-0 defeat by Iran in Pyongyang on Wednesday and asked Fifa to take action.

 ?We need to maintain good discipline and I?m sure Fifa will take proper action,? said Velappan.?The (match) reports are with Fifa. There should be some sort of action taken because this is an extremely serious violation. Whatever Fifa decides we will respect their decision.?

 North Korean soldiers and police were forced to step in to restore order after defender Nam Song-chol was sent off for shoving Syrian referee Mohamed Kousa after he had turned down a penalty appeal.

 Frankfurt: German sports goods firm Puma?s lawsuit against Fifa in a row over a ban on Cameroon?s controversial one-piece kit will begin next week, a German court said on Thursday.

 Puma, which supplies the African team with sportswear, has filed a lawsuit against Fifa at a German court demanding two million euros ($2.59 million) in damages.

 A spokesman for the regional court in Nuremberg-Fuerth, near Herzogenaurach where Puma has its headquarters, said the trial will start on April 6.

 Fifa banned the kit and imposed a six-point sanction on Cameroon?s 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the African Nations Cup in 2004.

 London: Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse could make a comeback from a broken leg before the end of the season, manager Rafael Benitez said on Thursday.

 The French international has been out since breaking his leg in two places during Liverpool?s Premier League match at Blackburn Rovers five months ago. Doctors then ruled him out for the rest of the season. Benitez, however, now believes he could still play a part in Liverpool?s run-in to the domestic championship and Champions League. 

 ?Cisse is now training again with the team. He is doing all the warm-ups and he?s kicking the ball again,? Benitez said. ?He?s running well and doing a lot of hard work with the physios with the ball,? he told Liverpools official website.

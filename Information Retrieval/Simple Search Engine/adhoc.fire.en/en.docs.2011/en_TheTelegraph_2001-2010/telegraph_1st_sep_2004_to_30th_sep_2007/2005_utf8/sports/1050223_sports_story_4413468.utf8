 NZ bow to Hayden

Christchurch: Matthew Hayden blasted a century as Australia steamrolled New Zealand by 106 runs in the second one-day International on Tuesday to take a 2-0 lead in their five-match series. 

Hayden ended his prolonged form-slump as the world champions racked up a formidable 314 for six after being given first use of a perfect batting strip. 

Adam Gilchrist failed with the bat but took five catches to become the first wicketkeeper to reach 300 ODI catches as New Zealand collapsed to 208 all out in the 41st over. 

The only resistance came from Daniel Vettori who made a defiant 83 of 77 balls to equal South African Lance Klusener?s record for the highest score made by a number eight in one-day history. 

?I?m rapt with the way we played,? Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. ?All the batsmen stood up and the new-ball bowling was outstanding.? 

Black Caps skipper Stephen Fleming said his team only had themselves to blame. ?It was pretty comprehensive,? he said. 

?We didn?t bowl as well as we could have on that wicket. We were hoping to keep them to 250 but they fed off our mistakes in the field and we missed quite a bit with the ball.? 

Hayden, dropped from the team earlier this month, was brutal in hitting 114 off 124 balls, including 12 boundaries and two sixes. (Reuters)

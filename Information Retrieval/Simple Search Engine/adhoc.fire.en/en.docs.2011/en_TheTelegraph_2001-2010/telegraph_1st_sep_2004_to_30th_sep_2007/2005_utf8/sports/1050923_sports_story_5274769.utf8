 Scholes warning

London: Manchester United have no chance of winning the Premier League this season if they fail to win their next two games against Blackburn Rovers and Fulham, says midfielder Paul Scholes. 

Just over a month into the new season, United are already seven points behind leaders and champions Chelsea, albeit with a game in hand. Last term, United finished 18 points adrift. (Reuters)

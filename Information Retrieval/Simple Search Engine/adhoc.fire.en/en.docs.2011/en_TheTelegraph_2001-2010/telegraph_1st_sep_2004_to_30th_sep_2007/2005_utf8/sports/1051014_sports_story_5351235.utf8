 Button set to create history

Shanghai: BARs Jenson Button makes Formula One history at the Chinese Grand Prix this weekend as the youngest driver to compete in 100 races. 

But the 25-year-old Briton also knows that no man has won the drivers crown without celebrating at least one victory before clocking up a century of starts. 

Mika Hakkinen had to wait the longest of all the champions to date, without a win for 96 races before his triumph at Jerez in the 1997 European Grand Prix opened the floodgates. The Finn then won titles with McLaren in 1998 and 1999. 

However, while Hakkinen was 29 when he finally climbed to the top step of the podium, Button can be confident that he has time on his side. 

It is very annoying that I have not won yet but it is no use talking about it, I just have to do something about it, he said. When I do get my first win, it will make it that little bit more emotional. 

I wouldnt change how my career has gone. I have made mistakes but I have learned from them. I have experienced a lot, more than most. 

Some drivers are lucky enough when they come into Formula One to get straight into a top team and win races and some people arent. 

It is debatable whether Button, who does not count this years US Grand Prix fiasco in his tally of races after he and the other Michelin-equipped drivers pulled out after the parade lap, has had a car capable of winning. 

He came close in 2004, with four second places, but Ferrari were in a class of their own with 15 victories from 18 races. 

After entering the sport as a 20-year-old with Williams, and becoming the youngest points scorer in Formula One history before moving to Benetton and then Renault, Button is in danger of being eclipsed by younger rivals.

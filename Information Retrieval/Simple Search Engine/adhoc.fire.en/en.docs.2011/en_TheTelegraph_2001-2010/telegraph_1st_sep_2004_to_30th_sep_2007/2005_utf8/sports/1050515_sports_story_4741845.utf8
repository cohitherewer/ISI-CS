 Pathans Middlesex mystery

 Pathan 

London: English County side Middlesex said on Saturday that it has signed Irfan Pathan as a replacement for South African Nantie Hayward but the Indian seamer was neither willing to confirm or deny the news. 

We are delighted to have signed a world class bowler in Irfan as his (Haywards) replacement, Middlesex head coach John Emburey was quoted as saying on the Countys official website. 

But Pathan, when contacted in Vadodara, sidestepped a query in this regard saying he has many offers. 

I have many offers. I dont want to comment on it now. I will let you know on Tuesday, said Pathan, who has 45 wickets from 13 Tests besides 47 scalps in 29 one-day Internationals. 

South African fast bowler Hayward is expected to be out of action for the next six weeks due to a groin injury.

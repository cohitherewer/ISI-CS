 Firoz, Mukesh joint 8th 

Hanoi: Firoz Ali and Mukesh Kumar were poised for top-10 finishes in the $ 200,000 Carlsberg Masters in Vietnam on Saturday. 

On yet another tough and windy day, Mukesh shot a par round of 72, while Firoz carded two-over 74. Both were tied eighth at one-over 213 after three rounds in the Asian Tour event. 

There were four Indians in sight of a top-10 finish, as Amandeep Johl and Vivek Bhandari also gave themselves a good chance at tied 11th with two-over 214. 

Bhandari, struggling to find his form of late, shot a 69, the best round of the day, equalled by Chris Rodgers, who shared lead with Asian Order of Merit leader Thai Thaworn Wiratchant and Malaysian Danny Chia. Johl carded 73. 

Wiratchant (72) is set for yet another title at six-under 210, as he was on top of leaderboard with Rodgers (69) and Chia (70). 

Only six players have sub-par totals in a tournament that has seen windy conditions. 

Gurbaaz Mann (74) at nine-over 225 was lying 37th, while Digvijay Singh (74) at 10-over 226 was tied 54th. 

Mukesh was very steady with just one birdie and no bogeys on the front nine and then had one birdie and two bogeys on the back stretch.

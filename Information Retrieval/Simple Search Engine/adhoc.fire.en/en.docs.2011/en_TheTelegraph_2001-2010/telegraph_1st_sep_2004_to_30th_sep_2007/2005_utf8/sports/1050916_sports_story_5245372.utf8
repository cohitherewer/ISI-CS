 Fletcher puts bully boys in their place

 Duncan Fletcher

Even the most implacable face in English cricket lowered his guard in a rare moment of public relaxation after the Ashes had been regained. Duncan Fletcher, the England coach whose famed attention to detail is matched only by his reluctance to part with his inner thoughts, reflected Wednesday on the past three months and looked ahead. 

When you look at the Australia team and realise how long it took to beat them, you realise the enormity of what weve done, he said. 

Without him, Englands victory parade on Tuesday would surely have not taken place. To be honest, I havent appreciated winning as much as the English fans, he said. I still believe that beating Australia is important ? from where I come from [Zimbabwe], it was the ultimate ? but I havent worked with a team whove been so focused on winning every game against Australia. Its only now that you realise that its huge for every cricketer who plays for England. 

A Twenty20 match is hardly a yardstick for a Test series, but it was after England hammered Australia by 100 runs in Southampton that Fletcher says he got the most excited all summer. 

We clinically beat them in the ICC Trophy semi-final last September, but you want a performance like that reaffirmed somehow, he said. The aggression [at the Rose Bowl] was what I liked ? we got into their faces and into their space. It was so well done. Then the win at Bristol followed and we realised we could do something this summer. 

Aggression throughout the series was the method by which Fletcher believed that England could beat Australia, reckoning correctly that the bully hates nothing more than to be bullied. At the heart of this policy was the four-man pace attack and Fletcher revealed that the question of Simon Joness replacement at The Oval was the hardest decision he had had to make. 

Graham Thorpes omission was up there, too, but we couldnt make a mistake over Jones, Fletcher said. Wed had this huge advantage in the first four Tests because he, as our fourth bowler, was our most economical. The Australians were under constant pressure as a result. Most people thought Jones wasnt good enough but if we hadnt had him, which way would the series have gone? 

According to Fletcher, the reports seem optimistic that Jones will be fit for the tour to Pakistan. The Welshman could be central to Englands chances there because, if the Pakistanis produce dry pitches to suit spin, his forte, reverse swing, will be easier to obtain. 

If they produce wickets for their spinners, it will play into our hands because of reverse swing, Fletcher said. We can sit back and say we have our bases covered. Thats what is so nice about our side ? we have reverse and traditional swing, Gilo [Ashley Giles] to do a job as spinner, and pace, which is the most important thing.

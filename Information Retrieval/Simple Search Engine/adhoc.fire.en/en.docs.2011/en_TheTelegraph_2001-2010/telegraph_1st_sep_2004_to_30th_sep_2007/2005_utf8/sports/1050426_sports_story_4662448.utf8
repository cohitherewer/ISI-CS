 Qualifier ousts John Higgins

Sheffield: Qualifier Shaun Murphy produced a shock win over 1998 champion John Higgins to ease through to the quarter finals of the snooker World Championship on Monday. 

The Englishman held a 9-7 lead overnight but despite dropping the opening frame, reeled off four on the trot to book a last eight meeting with six-times champion Steve Davis. 

Murphy said his Christian faith had helped him overcome the Scot. ?It gives me something to believe in and trust in,? he said. ?I know that, win or lose, whatever happens is in my best interests.? 

Welshman Matthew Stevens also reached the quarter finals, completing a comfortable 13-5 win over Jimmy White. Stevens needed just a frame to progress having held a 12-4 lead at the resumption of play. 

White won the opening frame of the session with a 68 break, but Stevens won the following frame with a break of 69 to seal victory. 

?I felt confident going into the match and I was really up for it,? said Stevens. ?I scored heavily and put him under a lot of pressure.? 

Stevens, who was a losing finalist in 2000, is now preparing to face seven-time champion Stephen Hendry in the last eight. ?You have to beat the best if you want to win the world championship,? he said. ?I?ve been keeping fresh by getting to bed early.? 

White, who has lost in six world finals, was frustrated with his poor form at the Crucible. 

?I?m just devastated that I never took any practice form to the match. It was most frustrating because I never got going at all.?

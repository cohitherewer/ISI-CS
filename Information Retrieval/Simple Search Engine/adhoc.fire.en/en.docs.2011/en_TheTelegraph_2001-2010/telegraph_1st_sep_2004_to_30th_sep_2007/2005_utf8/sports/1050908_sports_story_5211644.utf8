New York: Maria Sharapova, struggling with both her game and her opponent, earned her first spot in a US Open semi-final on Tuesday night with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Nadia Petrova. 

I wasnt there in the second set, the top-seeded Sharapova said. That wasnt the Maria out there fighting for every point. 

The fighting Maria reappeared in the third set, finding enough motivation and form to hold off the pesky Petrova. She will face Kim Clijsters who overcame Venus Williams. 

In the beginning it looked as if Sharapova was going to walk through Petrova just as she had walked through her first four opponents. So typical of the dominance of the top women players during the early rounds of a Slam, Sharapova lost only 12 games in four matches. 

A torn pectoral muscle, which had forced her to withdraw from the only tournament she tried to play since Wimbledon, no longer was an issue. 

Sharapova pounded her forehands deep and had Petrova on her heels in taking a 4-0 lead in the first set. But in what would become a match marked by errors rather than winners, Sharapova lost the handle on her groundstrokes and allowed Petrova to get into the match. Petrova broke her twice, evening the first set at 4-4. 

After holding serve easily for 6-5, Sharapova found the pace and depth on her strokes to break Petrova again and take the firstset. 

The second set was a mess, but Petrova managed a break to force a third set. Through two sets, Sharapova had totalled 40 errors and Petrova 39. Half the points came down to who was going to hit long, wide or into the net and there were more groans from the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd than cheers. 

The match ended much like it had begun. At 4-5 in the third, Petrova double-faulted at 40-30, then made two backhand errors. The ninth-seeded Petrova earned a measure of respect, and had reached a quarter final in a Slam for the first time, but was left wanting for answers in the biggest test of her career. 

I was 40-15, I had everything in my hands, Petrova said. I dont know where the double-fault came from, then I made two errors.

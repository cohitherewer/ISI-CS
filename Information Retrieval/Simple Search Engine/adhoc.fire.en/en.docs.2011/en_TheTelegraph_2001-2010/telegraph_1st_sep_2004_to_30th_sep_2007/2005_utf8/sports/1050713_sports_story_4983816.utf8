Courchevel (France): Lance Armstrong dismissed all doubts about his chances of winning a seventh Tour de France in succession in the first high mountain stage in the Alps between Grenoble and Courchevel on Tuesday. 

Perfectly launched by his Discovery Channel team in the last climb to the finish, the American again humbled most of the riders who were hoping to challenge him on his final Tour. 

In turns, Germans Jan Ullrich and Andreas Kloeden, Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov and Italys Ivan Basso, all seen as rivals before the start of the 10th stage, were forced to concede defeat as the American again appeared a class above the rest. 

Armstrong took second place in the 181-km ride, just behind Spains Alejandro Valverde, with Dane Michael Rasmussen, wearing the King of the Mountains polka dot jersey, finishing third. Overall, the American leads Rasmussen by 38 seconds and Basso by 2:40. 

Armstrong said: It was the first great day for Discovery Channel. They are a superb team to give the right tempo in the beginning of a climb. 

Today I had good legs and so did three other riders. I could not drop them all. 

As for the stage winner, the Texan added: With Valverde, everybody has seen the future of cycling. Hes fast, hes strong, hes intelligent. Its impressive. 

The first moment of truth of the Tour confirmed the six-time champions domination but it also revealed new talent in Valverde, his teammate Francisco Mancebo and Rasmussen. 

The three were the only riders to remain with Armstrong until the finish in the ski resort which hosted the ski jumping events at the 1992 Albertville Olympics. Valverde, seen by many as the most gifted rider of the new generation, won the stage in four hours and 50 minutes, after a last gasp sprint with Armstrong. 

Rasmussen was third nine seconds behind and Mancebo fourth in the same time after a hard days riding over two category-one climbs. 

Armstrongs team chief Johan Bruyneel said: We knew that todays stage was very important and the team worked fine. 

Lance managed the finish to perfection and it was difficult to win the stage with Valverde in the group. It was a great operation for Lance. 

Ullrich, the 1997 Tour winner, was dropped by the main bunch towards the finish and lost over two minutes on Armstrong on the day, while Vinokourov lost over five minutes.

Silverstone: Juan Pablo Montoya won the British Grand Prix for McLaren on Sunday to chalk up his first success of the Formula One season. 

While the Colombian opened his account with the Mercedes-powered team after winning last-years Brazilian season-ender with Williams, Renaults Formula One leader Fernando Alonso was also smiling. The Spaniard forged further ahead in the championship, finishing second to ease 26 points clear of McLaren rival Kimi Raikkonen. 

The Finn, whose chances of winning evaporated when he collected a 10-place penalty on the starting grid for an engine failure in Saturday practice, powered up from 12th place to third. 

With eight races remaining, Alonso has 77 points to Raikkonens 51. 

Jordans Narain Karthikeyan was the only driver who did not finish the race. The Indian was done in by an electrical failure on the 11th lap. 

McLaren team chief Ron Dennis said: (Montoya) did very well to hold his lead... Kimi, what can you say, 12th to third, lap record in the last lap. 

The race was dictated by the first few seconds. Alonso, starting on pole position for the fourth time in 11 races, had no reply as Montoya surged from third place on the grid to run side by side with the Spaniard through the first corner. 

 The fiery Colombian, determined to put a troubled first half of the season behind him, made the move stick and the remaining 59 laps came down to the pitstops. 

That was where Renaults hopes of getting both their drivers on the podium for only the second time this year came unstuck, with Alonsos Italian teammate Giancarlo Fisichella again cursed by misfortune. 

Fisichella was in third place, and heading for his first appearance on the podium since he won the Australian season-opener in March, when the Renault stalled after his second pitstop. 

Fisichella, trying to disguise yet another disappointment this season, said: It was a good day anyway (for Renault) because we knew McLaren was quicker than us here. 

The Roman ended up fourth, ahead of BARs Briton Jenson Button ? the overwhelming crowd favourite on a sunny afternoon ? and Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. 

Button was impressed by the speed of the McLarens and Renaults compared to the rest of the cars. 

A minutes silence was held before the race as a mark of respect for the London bomb victims. (Reuters)

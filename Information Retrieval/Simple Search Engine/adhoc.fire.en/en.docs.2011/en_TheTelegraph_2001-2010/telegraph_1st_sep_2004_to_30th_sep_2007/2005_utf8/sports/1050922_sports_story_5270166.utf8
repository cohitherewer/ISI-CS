 Watsons aim

Sydney: Just as English allrounder Andrew Flintoff spent the early years of his career striving to become the new Ian Botham, Australian Test rookie Shane Watson has now set his sights on becoming the new Freddie. 

Watson said on Wednesday he had been inspired by Flintoffs Man-of-the-Series performance in Englands 2-1 Ashes victory over Australia and hoped to face him in next months Super Series six-day Test in Sydney. 

Freddies performances showed what a great genuine allrounder does for the side, he told the Australian national news service AAP from Rawalpindi.

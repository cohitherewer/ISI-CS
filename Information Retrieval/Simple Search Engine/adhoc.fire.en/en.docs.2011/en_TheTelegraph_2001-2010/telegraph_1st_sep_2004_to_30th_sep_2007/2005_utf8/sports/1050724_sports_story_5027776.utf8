London: Shane Warne and Brett Lee combined spin and speed with ruthless efficiency to put Australia in sight of victory in the first Ashes Test at Lords on Saturday. 

Taking over where Glenn McGrath had left off on Thursday, the pair reduced England to 156 for five in their second innings after setting the home side an improbable 420 to win on the third day. 

Warne gave a mesmerising display of wrist spin punctuated by a series of full-throated, theatrical appeals. 

He finished the day with three for 46 from 15 overs while Lee, bounding in with undiminished enthusiasm from the Pavilion End in his first Test since January last year, captured two for 58. 

Kevin Pietersen, Englands first innings hero, played another fearless and intelligent innings, taking the attack to the Australian bowlers on the way to an unbeaten 42. He hooked Lee for a mighty six off the front foot, giving the crowd something to cheer in another dispiriting day for England supporters. 

Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss gave England a deceptively smooth start to their bid to become only the fourth team to score in more than 400 to win a Test, taking the total to 80 without loss before Lee struck. 

Strauss, on 37, lobbed a quick delivery with a horizontal bat into the covers and the athletic Lee responded with a quick sprint and dive before gleefully clinging to the ball. 

Sixteen runs later Trescothick, who had survived a raucous series of leg before shouts from an increasingly exasperated Warne, edged a ball delivered from the front of the hand straight to Matthew Hayden at slip for 44. 

Ian Bell, surrounded by a slip, gully, short leg and captain Ricky Ponting at silly mid-off, became Warnes second lbw victim for eight. 

Captain Michael Vaughan showed his increasing fallibility around the off stump when he was bowled for four by Lee, and Andrew Flintoff was caught behind off Warne for three, giving Test crickets leading wicket-taker three for 10 from 32 deliveries. 

The admirably composed Simon Katich orchestrated the first passage of play after Australia resumed at 292 for seven. 

He lost Lee for eight to the second run out of the innings when Ashley Giles struck the stumps at the bowlers end but Jason Gillespie proved an admirable replacement, watching the ball carefully on to his bat and reaching 13 before Simon Jones uprooted his leg stump. 

Katich square cut Flintoff for four to bring up the 300 and added to the England pacemans discomfort by stroking three consecutive boundaries. 

The compact left-hander glanced Flintoff for a single to bring up his seventh test half century from 81 balls with eight fours. 

McGrath played with the aplomb of an opening batsman rather than a No. 11, reaching 20 not out before Katich upper cut Steve Harmison to Simon Jones at third man and was out for 67. 

Australia, who have controlled the match since McGraths sensational five-wicket spell on Thursday, were assisted by some unacceptably sloppy England fielding. 

Geriant Jones dropped Gillespie with the score at 333 for eight off Simon Jones, flooring a straightforward chance diving one-handed to his right.

 A 90-plus knock cant make me an allrounder: Pathan

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Anil Kumble in New Delhi on Monday 

New Delhi: Irfan Pathans 143-ball 93 at the Kotla on Monday must have made his case stronger as a batsman. The left-arm quick, however, had his feet firmly on ground saying he was yet to reach the stage of being called an allrounder. 

Becoming an allrounder doesnt happen in two-three years, it takes more time. A 90-plus knock in a match cant make me an allrounder. I have my limitations and I play within those limitations, Pathan, who opened Indias second innings against Sri Lanka with Gautam Gambhir, said after the Day III action of the ongoing second Test. 

He also believed that the openers slot was not meant for him. I always have confidence in my batting. I did bat up in the order against Sri Lanka in the one-dayers (in Nagpur). But its Test cricket and opening is a professional job, Pathan maintained. 

He, however, rued missing out on the century. When you came so close to the mark, its always disappointing. 

Addressing the media, the Baroda player also pointed out that Sachin Tendulkars tips in the middle helped him focus on his innings. Sachin knows my game. In Nagpur and in the Duleep Trophy tie against South Zone (where he also opened), he helped me a lot. Today, he kept reminding me of playing my natural shots, he said. 

Kumble, the wrecker-in-chief for Sri Lanka in the first innings, attributed the success to the teams ability to motivate each other. 

 After tea (on Sunday), we formed a huddle and 

 motivated ourselves by saying that we are a good side and 

 we are capable of taking wickets. It so happened that we 

 kept constant pressure on the batsmen from both sides and 

 they caved in, Kumble revealed.

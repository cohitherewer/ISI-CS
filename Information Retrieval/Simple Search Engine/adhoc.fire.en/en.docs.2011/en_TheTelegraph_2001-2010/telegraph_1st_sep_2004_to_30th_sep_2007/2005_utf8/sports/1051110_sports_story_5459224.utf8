 Atapattu set to be retained

 - Despite poor show in ODIs?

 Maravan Atapattu 

Rajkot: Despite poor form and uninspiring leadership, the Sri Lankan selectors are understood to have informally decided on retaining Maravan Atapattu as captain for next months three-Test series in India. 

Atapattu hasnt at all been impressive, but his own form isnt the only reason why weve been routed in the ODIs... So, the selectors arent inclined to effect a change right now, a top Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) source told The Telegraph from Colombo. 

Lanka are 1-5 down, with just one match remaining, and Atapattus scores have been: 1, 4, 17, 87, 39 and 9. 

Incidentally, one of the selectors (Don Anurasiri) has been with the team throughout and SLC chief executive Duleep Mendis had come to Pune, during the fourth ODI, to lift the morale of Atapattu and Co. 

Mendis pep talk did have some effect as Lanka won the next match (Motera). On Wednesday, though, it was back to losing.

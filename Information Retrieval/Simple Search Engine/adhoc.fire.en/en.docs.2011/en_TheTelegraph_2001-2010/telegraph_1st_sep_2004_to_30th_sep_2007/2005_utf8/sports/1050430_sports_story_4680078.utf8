 Antarctic success for Bula

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bula?s dreams have finally come true 

Calcutta: Bula Chowdhury has finally made her dream come true. She has become the world?s first woman to swim oceans of the five continents, a repertoire of long distance feats that has taken her years to achieve. 

Friday, she crossed from Anchor Bay to Robben Islands near Cape Town in South Africa. Bula added another feather to her cap by conquering the 30-odd km in the cold Antarctic waters in three hours 26 minutes. 

Bula emerged the first Asian woman to swim the stretch in such a short time, according to information received here. 

Incidentally, Bula was India?s sprint queen in her early days.

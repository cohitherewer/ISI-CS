 Cricket not to debut in Doha Games 

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Cricket won?t make its debut in 2006 Doha Asian Games owing to poor response from the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), an IOA official said on Saturday. 

Speaking to reporters here, Randhir Singh, secretary general of Indian Olympic Association (IOA), said: ?Cricket has been dropped from the schedule due to lack of ?good? response from the Asian Cricket Council (ACC)?. 

The ACC only wanted to send under-19 teams, which was unacceptable to the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), he said. 

According to Randhir, who is also the OCA secretary general, the BCCI must start influencing the ACC and International Cricket Council (ICC) to ensure that only the best players are available, if cricket is to be included in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. 

?We are keen to have cricket in the Commonwealth Games and also in the subsequent Asian Games. But it will also depend on the response of the cricket?s governing bodies like the ACC and the ICC,? Randhir added. 

Other decisions taken at the OCA?s executive committee meeting in Kuwait on February 5 include the re-instatement of the four-year cycle for the Winter Asian Games. 

The OCA official also had a word of advice for ICC. The six-times Olympian felt that if cricket wanted to become popular in more than a handful of countries, then it was essential to have the game included in multi-disciplinary games like Asian and Commonwealth Games. 

Regarding India?s bid for the 2014 Asian Games, the OCA secretary general said it would be officially declared on March 1, and the name of host city would be decided at the annual general body meeting of the OCA in China later this year. 

According to Randhir, ?Though only India and Jordan have so far confirmed their interests in hosting the 2014 games, Dubai and one city each from Japan and Korea were also interested. But the official list of bidding cities will only be known on March 1.? 

He said the OCA also decided to reinstate the four-year cycle for the Winter Asian Games. ?Due to the two-year cycle, the Games used to clash with some other events and to avoid that we have reverted back to the four-year cycle,? he said, adding ?the 2009 games have therefore been shifted to 2011?.

 Aloke: We are victims of discrimination

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bengal coach Aloke Mukherjee is worried more about lack of quality practice ground than the must-win situation against Mizoram in the final cluster match to qualify for the next stage. 

Bengal were denied practice at the local Chandrasekharan Nair Stadium and asked to leave the ground because of a dog show there on Sunday. Although there was an apology from the organisers, prompting the Bengal camp to withdraw from moving the AIFF, Mukherjee said on Monday that things hardly improved. 

We have been asked to practise at a ground near the airport tomorrow and Ive just come to know that its devoid of any grass and very hard? Not at all an ideal ground for practice, Mukherjee told The Telegraph from Thiruvananthapuram after Bengals 3-0 win over Andhra on Monday. 

What really pains me is that better practice grounds are being provided to teams like Goa and Karnataka, but a different rule is being applied to us, he added.

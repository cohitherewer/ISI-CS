 3-stroke lead for Harinder

Digboi: Harinder Gupta of Chandigarh shot a commendable six-under 66 to establish a three-stroke lead after the third day of the IndianOil Xtrapremium Masters meet at the Digboi Golf Links here on Friday. 

With a 10-under 206 over three days, he had a three stroke lead over his nearest rival S.S.P. Chowrasia from Calcutta in the sixth leg of the Amby Valley PGAI Tour. 

Current No.3 on the Order of Merit list, Chowrasia was sole second with a seven-under 209, having shot a three-under 69 after leading the standings along with Harinder and Shankar Das on the second day. 

Chowrasia tried to hang on with birdies on the 3rd, 5th, 15th and 17th, but a bogey on the 7th upset his plans. 

The 16th was definitely turning out to be Harinders favourite hole, having shot birdies on all three days. (PTI)

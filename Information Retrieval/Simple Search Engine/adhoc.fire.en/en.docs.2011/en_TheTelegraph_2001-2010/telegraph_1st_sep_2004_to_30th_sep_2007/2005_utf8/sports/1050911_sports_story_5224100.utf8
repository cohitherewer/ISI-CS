 Fitness stands Kim in good stead

New York: Kim Clijsters, who has vowed to quit tennis in two years, says her retirement plans wont increase the pressure to finally claim her first Grand Slam title. 

No, not at all, said the 22-year-old Belgian, four times a bridesmaid in major championship matches. It just gives me that goal. Thats why I did it. I have that goal, and for the next two years Im going to try and give everything I can. 

She has burned up the American hard courts in the two months prior to the US Open, with three titles in four starts. 

She opened her year with unlikely triumphs from unseeded ranks at Indian Wells and Miami, signalling her return from a nearly career-threatening wrist injury in spectacular fashion. 

Here at Flushing Meadow, she has raced down balls and worn down opponents with her speed, agility and sheer determination. 

While Clijsters says she always counts on her fitness to get her through, she says its getting harder and harder to maintain. 

She was feeling it after a tough 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 quarter final win over Wimbledon champion Venus Williams. 

 After the Venus match, you should have seen the way I was walking around. Everything was hurting ? my ankles, my wrists, everything is just sore and making a lot of noise, she said. 

It certainly didnt show in her semi-final three-set triumph over top-seeded Russian Maria Sharapova, where Clijsterss scrambling defence complete with spectacular sliding splits was still in evidence. 

The 18-year-old Sharapova pointed to Clijsterss better fitness as a key factor in the match. But the Belgian said it comes at a cost. 

Yeah, Im 22, she said. But definitely my body is not 22 anymore. 

Sharapova admits that she needs to put more hours in at the gym. While her shot-making abilities were a match for the Belgians on Friday, the Russian was distinctly second-best in terms of pure athleticism and fitness. 

She will again be world No.1 at the end of the championships, switching positions again with long-time top dog Lindsay Davenport.

 Tollygunge stun Churchill

Margao: Churchill paid dearly for defensive lapses as Tollygunge defeated them 2-1 to record their first win in the second round of the ninth National Football League (NFL) on Tuesday. 

Tollygunge scored through Surjit Bose (2nd) and Dinesh Swar (47th) to pocket full poi-nts from the match, which was played at the Nehru Stadium. 

Churchill, who held the edge for the better part of the match, were reduced to 10-men when defender Venancio Gonsalves left the field with 20 minutes to go due to an injury. 

The side couldn?t bring in a replacement for Gonsalves as by then it had already effected three substitutions. The win took Tollygunge to four points from two matches while Chur-chill have one point from as many matches. 

Churchill kept the rivals under pressure in the second half but were frustrated by the rival defence until coach Shabbir Ali had to call his key player I M Vijayan, who scored a gem of a goal with a sizzling backvolley to reduce the margin. 

 Subrata theory 

Our Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Subrata Bhattacharya said after his team?s defeat to Mahindra that office matches are affecting his team. 

The Mohun Bagan coach said: ?Dulal Biswas and Basudeb Mondal are tired after playing office matches. Sunil Chhetri also got injured while turning out for his office. 

?Moreover, Ashim Biswas played for ? Railways on Monday. These are obviously affecting my side,? the coach added.

Fort Worth (Texas): Arjun Atwal was unable to turn on the final day magic as he further slipped to finish tied 39th at the $ 5.6m Bank of America Colonial golf championship which was won by Kenny Perry with a huge seven-shot margin. 

Atwal continued to be troubled by an injured knee in the fourth and final round at the par-70 Colonial Country Club, as he shot a three over 73 to slip in the final standings. 

Atwals three-over had three birdies, but he seemed to be finding the bogeys in pairs, as he dropped shots on second and third and then at seventh and eighth and again at 15th and 16th. His 73 saw him finish at three-under 277. 

The irony was that the Indian hit his drives longer than the third round, had fewer putts and found more fairways, but then he failed to find the greens in regulation. 

Atwal won $ 23,520 and has now crossed $ 660,000 in earnings. 

Perry cruised to a seven-shot victory, capturing his second title in three years at Hogans Alley with a record equalling total of 19-under-par 261. With temperatures hovering around 100 degrees Fahrenheit, Perry closed with a one-under 69 to finish well clear of compatriot Billy Mayfair, who also carded a 69. 

It was a masterful display by the Perry, who had just one bogey on his scorecard all week until a double-bogey six at the 17th in the final round prevented him from lowering the 72-hole record he set when first winning the title in 2003. 

Perrys 72 hole aggregate and his seven-stroke winning margin were the best on the PGA Tour this season. 

I didnt feel dominant but I knew my game was good, my swing was good, Perry said. When I birdied the first hole I knew I was going to have a good day. It feels great. Im 44, Im still stomping around out there. 

Perry, who clinched the Bay Hill Invitational earlier this year, joined Vijai Singh, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson as the only multiple winners on the 2005 PGA Tour and lifted his career earnings above $18 million. (Reuters)

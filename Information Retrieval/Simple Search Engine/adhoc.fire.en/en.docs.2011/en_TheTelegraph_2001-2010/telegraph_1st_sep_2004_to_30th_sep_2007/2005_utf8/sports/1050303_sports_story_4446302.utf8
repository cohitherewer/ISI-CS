New Delhi: The Chinese may be the underdogs in their Davis Cup Asia Oceania group I tie against the hosts here but the Indian thinktank is not willing to take any chances and would wait till the last moment before deciding their singles line-up. 

Even team captain Leander Paes, who has been shouldering the responsibility of the main singles player for over a decade now, is weighing his fitness options and whether he has recovered enough from the ankle injury to play on all the three days of the tie starting on Friday. 

?I have been practising singles very hard for the last few days. We will be deciding the singles line up this evening but before that I have to ask myself whether I am physically ready to play for all three days or should the other guys take some responsibility,? Paes said here. 

The Indian skipper, who is returning after a two-month lay off following an ankle injury, was also happy that he had more options to choose from as Prakash Amritraj?s game was tailor made for grass court while Harsh Mankad was on a high after winning the Satellite circuit in England last week. ?These two guys are eager to share the responsibility and that is a very good thing.? 

Both the teams would be announcing their final line up only on Thursday before the draw, to be made at the Prime Minister?s residence, but Bhupathi made it clear that Paes and he would be playing the doubles. 

Meanwhile, the Chinese suffered a minor setback as their experienced player Zhu Ben Qiang hurt his back while practising. But their non-playing captain Zhao Xie said the injury was not serious.

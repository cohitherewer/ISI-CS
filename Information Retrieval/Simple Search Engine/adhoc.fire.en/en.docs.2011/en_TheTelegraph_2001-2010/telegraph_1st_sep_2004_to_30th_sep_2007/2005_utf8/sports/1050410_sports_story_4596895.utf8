The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mahindra down Bagan 

 - National League 

- Nayeem?s team moves to fourth 

 Flavio converted a spot-kick to make it 2-0 for Mahindra 

Mumbai: Mohun Bagan?s search for redemption under new coach Amal Dutta woke up to a rude shock when they suffered 0-2 to Mahindra United on Saturday. This is the three-time champions? first loss under the veteran coach, following successive draw against Dempo and SBT. 

The verdict, however, made Mohun Bagan?s task all the more difficult in their survival as they now bagged 17 points from 16 outings. The hosts, on the other hand, moved up to fourth position, having collected 24 points. 

The Brazilian duo Rodrigo de Almeida and Flavio Rodrigues found the target in the 54th and 88th minute, respectively, after a goalless first-half. 

Rodrigo gave Syed Nayeemuddin?s team the lead taking advantage of an unmarked position and firing home a diagonal pass from his compatriot Flavio. 

Later Flavio converted the spot-kick to the left of Bagan custodian Subrata Pal, who charged the striker while going for a high ball and the referee pointed to the dreaded spot. 

Mohun Bagan, however, had their own shares of chances in an otherwise listless show at the Cooperage. 

In the 17th minute, no Bagan player was in position inside the box to turn in a goalmouth cross from Tomba Singh and then, towards the fag end the Mahindra goalkeeper effected a smart save off a sharp left-footed try by Mehtab Hussain. 

Tolly vs Churchill 

A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: In a battle of survival, Tollygunge Agragami?s job is cut out when they take on another strugglers Churchill Brothers at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Mohun Bagan?s loss on Saturday, however, may be a relief for Tollygunge. While Tollygunge have 15 points from as many matches, the Goa visitors are one point behind them. 

Tollygunge will miss Isiaka Awoymei and Suley Musah may come in defence. Debkumar Sasmal is also available. Churchill will be without Yusif Yakubu. (PTI)

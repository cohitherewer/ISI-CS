 Sania meets Safarova in final

New Delhi: Sania Mirza set up a title clash with Czech Republics Lucie Safarova in the Forest Hills Womens Classic in New York. 

In the semi-finals on Friday, the third-seeded Sania defeated 15-year-old American Alexa Glatch 6-4, 6-4 while Lucie tamed compatriot Iveta Benesova 2-6, 6-1, 6-4. 

Alexa, who entered the tournament as a wild card, had earlier upset top seed Akiko Morigami of Japan. 

Sania has not dropped a set so far this week, posting a 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 win over Israels Shahar Peer in the first round and a 6-2, 6-1 rout of Italian Roberta Vinci in the quarter finals. 

Lucie has now reached three finals in her first nine Tour main draws, including winning her very first title on clay at Estoril in May and finishing runner-up on grass at Hertogenbosch in June. This week she upset Anna Smashnova in the first round and Italys Antonella Serra Zanetti in the quarter finals.

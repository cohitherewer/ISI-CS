 Depleted WI face uphill task

 - FIRST TEST vs SA 

 Chanderpaul?s side can spring a surprise, feels Bennet King 

Georgetown: A depleted West Indies will be looking to prove their detractors wrong in the opening Test of four-match series against South Africa that begins here Thursday. 

Veteran left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul walks out on home soil at Bourda Oval leading a West Indies side that has been ravaged by the fallout from the sponsorship row between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), the West Indies Players? Association and current and previous team sponsors in recent weeks. 

Several times in his distinguished career, Chanderpaul has shown immense fighting qualities with the bat that will not be out of place now, and should not be lost on a side in which there is no Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, and to a lesser extent, Fidel Edwards. 

In the last year, all but Lara signed personal sponsorship contracts, which the WICB believes is in direct conflict with its team sponsorship agreement. 

The WICB, acting on legal advice, indicated that Lara?s contract was not in breach of the agreement, and offered the master batsman a place in the side. 

Lara offered a non-committal response in which he said he did not want to offend either the board or his teammates by agreeing to play or not to play, and in the end, the WICB chose to leave him out of the squad. 

West Indies? Australia-born coach Bennet King believes Chanderpaul?s side can overcome the mental stress that they have had to deal with over the last few weeks and offer a stiff challenge to the South Africans. 

South Africa however, firmly believe they can continue to dominate the West Indies, despite the cracks in their own arsenal. 

In the last year, the South Africans have plummeted from the No. 2 position on the Test table. 

The visitors have won 10 of the 13 Tests they have contested against the West Indies though, including a 2-1 series triumph under Shaun Pollock.

 Waqar wants long-term contract

Karachi: Waqar Younis wants a long-term contract to serve as the national team?s bowling coach. ?I met PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and conveyed to him my availability but have asked for a long-term contract,? Waqar said from Lahore. 

Waqar said he had also asked for authority. ?Authority is not in team selection. The discussion was all related to how the best can be extracted out of the young but talented bowlers and how they can be groomed and made more effective and destructive,? Waqar said. (PTI)

 Starcraft to vie for Breeders 

 New York: Paul Makin wants Starcraft to make the biggest bang at the Breeders Cup on Saturday, so the Australian owner has entered the worlds top-rated miler in the longer Classic race.

 By opting to enter Starcraft in the 1 1/4-mile Classic instead of the Mile, Makin has coughed up an additional $500,000 in supplemental fees to put the five-year-old in a dirt-surface race for the first time. If youve got a really good horse you should try to excel, said Makin, principle owner of the Australian Syndicate that paid $800,000 to put Starcraft in the last race of Saturdays richest card in thoroughbred racing at Belmont Park.

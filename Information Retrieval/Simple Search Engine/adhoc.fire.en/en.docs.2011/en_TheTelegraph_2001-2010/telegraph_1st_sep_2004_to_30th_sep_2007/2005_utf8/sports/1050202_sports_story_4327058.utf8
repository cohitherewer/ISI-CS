 Tiger won?t be that dominant again: Els

 Tiger Woods 

Sydney: South Africa?s Ernie Els says he doubts Tiger Woods will ever dominate golf like he did a few years ago despite a recent return to winning form. 

Woods captured eight Majors and held the No. 1 ranking for more than five years before losing the top spot to Fiji?s Vijai Singh last September. 

Less than two weeks ago in California, Woods picked up his first US PGA Tour event for almost a year but Els said greater competition and improved technology meant it would hard for the American to dominate like before. 

?Everybody has become better players, technology has brought everybody closer together,? world No. 3 Els told reporters in Melbourne on Tuesday ahead of this week?s Heineken Classic. 

?I think he has had a very good start obviously, but I can?t see him being that dominant again. 

?The guys out there are a lot more confident, they?ve stepped up to their games. No one is hitting it 30 or 40 yards past everybody else.? ?Since the end of last season Tiger has started playing better, he?s got more confidence, but the other guys will be right there... I don?t think he?s going to be as dominant,? Els said. 

Twelve months ago, Els shot a course record 60 on his way to winning the Classic for the third consecutive time and while he does not expect to better that round this year he said his overall game had improved. 

?I feel that mentally I have come a long way in my game,? Els said. ?There are a number of technical aspects where I can be better and I have started working on those things.? 

Els already has secured three Majors victories and said he was confident of adding to his tally in the next few seasons. 

?Last year was a very good year, but the four Majors were very disappointing,? he said. 

?Basically, I had four chances to win, but I blew the one at the US Open. (Reuters)

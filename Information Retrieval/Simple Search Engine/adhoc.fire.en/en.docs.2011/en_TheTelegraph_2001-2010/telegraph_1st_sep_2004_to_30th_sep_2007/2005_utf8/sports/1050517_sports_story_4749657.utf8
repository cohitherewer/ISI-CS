Calcutta: The 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash believes India has the potential and wishes to see a Wimbledon champion from this country in future. 

Upon arriving in the city for the third time on Monday, following a call from Bengal Tennis Association (BTA), the Australian admitted that part of his confidence in the Indian talent pool was drawn from Leander Paes show in the circuit. 

Leander is my favourite player and I love to watch him on the court. I really want to see another coming up and following in his footsteps? I want to see somebody in near future lifting a Grand Slam like Wimbledon, Cash remarked at the BTA complex. 

The former great regretted that Indian spectators didnt get to see Leanders game in full flow regularly because lack of doubles coverage on TV. He (Leander) is brilliant, but its a pity that people cant watch this fine doubles player (on television) as he has to mostly play on outside courts, Cash stated. 

About Indias latest teen sensation Sania Mirza, Cash didnt commit himself, saying: I havent seen her in action and so cant comment on her progress. 

Cash, an ardent follower of cricket, insisted that there is no dearth of talent in India and proper grooming is needed to extract the best out of them. 

Since I follow cricket, it is evident that there is plenty of talent here which needs to be guided in proper direction, Cash said. 

Reverting to the topic of world tennis, Cash felt that there are only a few serve and volley players in modern days. Look at Roger Federer and Pete Sampras? both are good serve and volley players and thats why they have managed to reign supreme at the top level for a long time, he pointed out. 

Asked whether Federer can win all the four Grand Slams this year, Cash said that the Swiss would have to take it one by one. The French Open will be the toughest for him, Cash opined. 

Utterly disagreeing with Ivan Lendls once-famous comment that grass is for the cows, Cash stressed on the importance of grass courts in adding competitive edge to the game. Grass will be there as a surface as long as tennis exists, he maintained. 

Describing doubles as an exciting form of the game, the former great said it was always a delight to watch doubles and the governing body of the game should give the doubles its proper due. It is very spectator-friendly. You get to see breathtaking touch shots which you dont usually see in singles, he said. 

Asked whether Mahesh Bhupathi and his new partner Todd Woodbridge were capable of striking it big in the doubles circuit this year, Cash said, they are experienced players. But then young guys are playing more powerful tennis. 

Cash will impart some modern techniques to the pupils during his three-day clinic at the BTA.

 Lara amp; Co. to stay out, insists WICB 

St John?s: Brian Lara and six of his teammates will remain frozen out of the squad to face South Africa and Pakistan after the latest moves to solve the long-running contract crisis failed Saturday. 

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) insisted that Lara, vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle, Fidel Edwards, Dwayne Bravo, Dwayne Smith and Ravi Rampaul will remain exiled from the 22-man squad. 

The seven players all have individual contracts with Cable and Wireless, a rival company of the board?s main backers Digicel. 

?The board will commence inspection of certain contracts pertaining to Cable and Wireless contracted players,? said a WICB statement. 

?The purpose of the inspection is to ensure the contracts don?t impose on the players any obligations which could cause them or the WICB to be in breach of the contract which has been executed between the WICB and Digicel. 

?While the examination is in process, the players who hold personal endorsement contracts with Cable and Wireless will not be considered for selection to the West Indies team.?

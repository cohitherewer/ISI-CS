 Roping in Dutta was the right move

Free Kick

P.K. Banerjee

I was among those Subrata had sought help from in a last-ditch effort to lift sagging spirits in the Mohun Bagan camp earlier this month. Well, I did try to boost him and his players on the eve of the Tollygunge Agragami match. They won that one but subsequently lost back-to-back games in Goa. The club management decided enough was enough and showed Subrata the red card.

 I did say in my last column that sacking Subrata wouldn?t solve Mohun Bagan?s problem. My theory was based on the belief that the green-and-maroons were under choking pressure at home and would perform much better in the second-phase away games of the NFL. Little did I know then that Subrata had totally lost the plot vis-?-vis his players.

 Yes, I discovered during my visit to the Mohun Bagan camp that a majority of the players had lost confidence in their coach. Player-coach relationship was at a very low ebb. That is a dangerous thing for any team and is bound to affect the players? performance.

 A modern day football team comprises men from different cultural and geographical backgrounds. It?s not easy to get those 25-30 human beings to function in the same wave-length. But that is precisely why a coach/manager is appointed. He?s paid a good sum of money to get the best out of his players.

 A vital aspect of the coach?s job is to understand the psychology of the players and handle them accordingly. For instance the Brazilians, now very much part and parcel of Indian football, are a very sentimental lot. The Barretos and Betos have to be treated differently than the boys from Manipur or Goa.

 Subrata has tasted success as coach in the past, twice guiding Mohun Bagan to the NFL crown besides giving them some other trophies. So he knows precisely how to motivate a football team. But this season, man-management skills seem to have deserted him.

 Considering the circumstances, the Mohun Bagan officials have done the right thing by replacing Subrata with Amal Dutta. He is a very senior coach who has learnt with experience what to do in a crisis like this. Realising that he doesn?t have much time in his hand, Dutta addressed the problem head-on. One of the first things he did was to find a role for Jo Paul Ancheri ? and he did quite well as the defensive screen.

 Here?s one extremely versatile player who has shown his value in different positions several times in the past. And yet, he was a mere passenger in Subrata?s scheme of th5

 ings. Yes, with age, he has become slow and is certainly not the fittest of footballers around. But isn?t it the coach?s duty to try and get somebody match-fit who could be of immense value to the side?

 Dutta has also introduced two practice sessions daily. Not only will this help in identifying the rough edges so that remedial action can be taken quickly, the move also increases coach?s interaction with the players. The more time a coach gives to his players, the better it is for both parties.

 The draw versus Dempo, one of the frontrunners for the championship, was a good start under Dutta. The threat of relegation is still hanging over Mohun Bagan but I?m quite sure the team can tide over that crisis. The new coach is taking necessary action on the physical, mental and spiritual fronts ? all of which are equally important. Unless they are hit by a catastrophe, Mohun Bagan will comfortably retain their berth in the premier division of the NFL.

Amal Dutta started off well by earning a point off Dempo

 East Bengal suffered a rare home defeat at the hands of Sporting Clube de Goa the other day. I know the red-and-golds are very serious and determined in their pursuit of a third successive NFL title. But these occasional lapses can?t be ruled out as Bhowmick?s men try to strike the right balance between the AFC Cup and NFL.

 No praise can be too high for the way Sporting have bounced back from the accident they suffered in Calcutta two months ago. They are certainly one of the most dangerous floaters in the NFL, along with Fransa. Salgaocar, Churchill and even the struggling Vasco can upset the applecart of a top team on any given day.

 So we should look forward to some exciting action as the NFL moves into its business end.

 Looking at the global scene, the Champions League produced some shock results. Real Madrid and Manchester United, two of the flag-bearers of world football, got eliminated in the first knockout round. Neither is in a position to win their national league championships either, which means that the major trophies will elude them for a third straight season.

 I?m not worried about Manchester. I know they will turn things around under the shrewd Alex Ferguson sooner than later. But the Spanish giants will have to do some serious introspection before the next season gets underway.

 Clubs like Real have to keep one eye on business while finalising their players? list. Roping in huge names ensures that players? merchandise sells like hot cakes. The lesson Real should have learnt by now is that they can?t overdo the business part at the cost of football.

 Zidane, Figo, Raul, Roberto Carlos, Beckham? they are all great players. But the fact is, some of them are past their prime and need to be replaced by young legs. That?s easier said than done, but for Real?s sake, some hard decisions have to be taken.

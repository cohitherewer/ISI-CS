 Motivator to be reunited with Murtagh 

 Epsom: Johnny Murtagh will be free to ride Motivator in the Vodafone Derby, on Saturday, after having a three-day ban reduced to two at the Jockey Club on Wednesday.

 Murtagh was found guilty of careless riding after partnering Miss Brush to win the Leisure Club Median Auction Maiden Stakes at Lingfield Park last week. The local stewards decided that he had caused interference in the early stages having cut across to the rails from his high draw and gave him the suspension, due to begin on Derby Day.

 However, Murtagh contested the ban and after a hearing of the Jockey Clubs disciplinary panel, lasting about an hour and a quarter, the punishment was reduced. A suspension of two days or less is automatically deferred if clashing with a Group One race in Britain and Murtagh is now banned on Sunday and Monday. Getting it reduced to two days is a big relief, Murtagh said. Im just glad its all over.

 Meanwhile jockey Keiren Fallon is under pressure to make a good choice. Had you asked him in April which horse he would be riding in Saturdays Vodafone Derby, hed have suggested Albert Hall. After that horse was well beaten in the Dante on May 12, he would have said Gypsy King. Ask now and he will confess Oratorios two Guineas runs have forced new considerations upon him.

 Granted, this is the man who quit Sir Michael Stoutes yard to join Aidan Brien, but Fallons choice of conveyance is among the most tense of his career. There is only one thing worse than finishing second in the Derby and thats finishing second to a horse you could have ridden.

 Ask Fallons great rival Frankie Dettori, who spoke about choosing strife with rather more immediacy than he would have preferred after a total mix-up he rode Duke Of Venice, rather than winner Fight Your Corner, in Mondays Henry II Stakes. 

 Every Derby decision Ive made Iveve got wrong; he rued. Last year, I thought Snow Ridge was Godolphins best chance but I finished seventh and Rule Of Law was second. In 1998, I rode Cape Verdi when City Honours was narrowly beaten. I could even have ridden Lammtarra in 1995 but stuck with runner-up Tamure instead.. My reasoning? Lammtarra hadnt run for a year, Tamure was unbeaten and I was working for his trainer John Gosden whereas Godolphin had only a handful of horses. I was glad he beat me by a length and not a short head. I rode a good race and almost got away with it. Lammtarra was just too good. 

 There can be nuances to a jockeys decision-making to which only his closest advisers are party. Retainers or, more loosely, allegiances to an owner, trainer or even horse can ? depending on character and situation ? simplify complicate. Its harder for Kieren because his choices come from one yard so the pressure is greater to get it right. 

 Willie Carson, four times a 

 Derby winner, said. Its easier when 

 loyalties come into it: if I had to choose between riding for John Dunlop and, say, Roger Charlton, there would be no question. I would ride for John Dunlop. 

 Walter Swinburn, successful three times, demurs: True if youre well-established, like Willie was, but go slightly below that level and a jockey is juggling four or five trainers. You dont want to upset them just as theyre starting to give you rides. What if youre getting your toe in the door at Sir Michael Stoutes and he offers you his third string at Epsom, yet a smaller-scale trainer presents you a better chance?

 Ray Cochrane, triumphant in 1988 with Kahyasi, favours the Lester Piggott school of thought. Piggott had both the talent and gall to be utterly ruthless in ensuring he was on the best horse possible. You cant think politically for races of this calibre; said Cochrane. It could be the highlight of your life. You must choose the best.

 Swinburn recalls with amusement how close he came to rejecting Shergar in 1981. All winter, Id been dreaming about riding Centurius; he said. Id heard talk of this Shergar and was starting to wonder how to get round the problem of wanting to ride Centurius when everyone else preferred Shergar. Luckily, it was solved for me: Shergar won both of his trials impressively and Centurius was beaten.

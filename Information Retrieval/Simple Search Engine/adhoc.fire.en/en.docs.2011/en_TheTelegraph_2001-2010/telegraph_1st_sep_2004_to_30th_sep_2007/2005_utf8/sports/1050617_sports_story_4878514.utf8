 Jordan rule out dropping Narain

Indianpolis: Ending speculation of a possible replacement, Jordan have ruled out that they were planning to drop Indias star driver Narain Karthikeyan for Renaults test driver Franck Montagny of France. 

Colin Kolles, Jordan manager, said at most the Frenchman could be his teams third driver in the July 3 French Grand Prix at Magny Cours, making it clear that the combination of Karthikeyan and Tiago Monteiro would not be disturbed, at least for the time being. 

If he does (drive at Magny Cours), it will be as third driver only, media reports quoted Kolles as saying Thursday. It wont be easy to have Franck with us at French GP, but if he comes along it will be as third driver. 

Kolles said that the team was happy with the performance of its drivers, particularly Monteiro. 

We are very happy with our drivers, mainly with Tiago who has done a great job in the last few races. (PTI)

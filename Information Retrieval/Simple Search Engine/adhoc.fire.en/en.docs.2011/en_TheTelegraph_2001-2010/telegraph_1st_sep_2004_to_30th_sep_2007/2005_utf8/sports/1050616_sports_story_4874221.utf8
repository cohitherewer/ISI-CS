 Sasi splits point with Almasi

Paks: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran was held to a draw by Zoltan Almasi of Hungary while 74-year-old GM Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland overpowered his much younger opponent to take sole lead after three rounds of the Marx Gyorgy Memorial Grandmasters tournament. 

Not mellowed a wee bit by the age-factor, Korchnoi demonstrated fine skills to beat GM Ferenc Berkes of Hungary to emerge sole leader with 2.5 points in this category-15 double round-robin event among six players. 

Top seed Emil Sutovsky of Israel, who drew with Hungarian GM Peter Acs, and Almasi closely follow the leader with two points apiece while Sasikiran and Acs have one each. Berkes (0.5) is at the bottom of the table with seven rounds remaining. 

It turned out to be an average day for Sasikiran who played the white side of a Nimzo Indian defence. Seeded second here, the Indian will now have to quickly score some points to have any chance of being a frontrunner in the second half of the tournament. 

Almasi is the third best Hungarian behind Peter Leko and Judit Polgar, and he lived up to his reputation by holding Sasikiran quite easily. 

Capablanca variation Sasikirans choice and he could only get a miniscule advantage typical of the opening. Almasi exchanged the pieces almost at will to arrive at a queen and minor pieces endgame wherein Sasikirans bishops were not as effective as he would have liked them to be. Another trading of piece led to a balanced endgame and the draw was agreed to in 30 moves. (PTI)

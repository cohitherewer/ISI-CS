 Inzy admits to throwing problem

Sydney: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq Thursday said his country?s bowlers have a throwing problem but he will not stop using suspected spinner Mohammed Hafeez. 

Hafeez Wednesday became the fourth Pakistan bowler, and second off-spinner, in two months cited for a suspect action when reported during the tri-series win over the West Indies at the Gabba. 

Inzamam, though, did not believe his team was being targeted by umpires and Match Referees, conceding they had a consistency problem. 

Fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Shabbir Ahmed have also been reported for suspect actions, while off-spinner Shoaib Malik has been banned from bowling by human movement experts in Perth in December. 

?This is definitely not being targeted, but definitely there is a problem there,? he said. ?I think (Hafeez?s) problem is not much, it?s very little and hopefully he will cope with that problem.? (AP)

Charlotte: Arjun Atwal could not build on a good start on the front nine, as he ended Day III with a three-over 75 to be tied 69th at the $5.6 million Wachovia Championship on Saturday. 

Spains Sergio Garcia stayed in the lead at the demanding Quail Hollow Golf Club. He played some terrific golf for a five-under 67 and extended his lead to a whopping six strokes over Fijian Vijai Singh. 

Atwal opened with a string of pars and then birdied the seventh and eighth. 

But he doubled-bogeyed the ninth and had bogeys on tenth, 12th and 18th to end the day with an aggregate seven-over 223. 

The Indians driving accuracy was down to a poor seven per cent as he hardly found a green. His putting, too, was nothing to write home about, taking 31 putts for the round. 

Garcia was in menacing form as he made eight birdies in his first 15 holes and ended with a 67 that put him six strokes clear of the field. 

Barring a few wayward tee shots into the trees, he was played superbly. 

He pulled away with three straight birdies along the back nine, and even managed to hold his own against the tough finishing holes. That brought to 12-under 204. 

Rookie D.J. Trahan, finished with a 71 to total a 6-under 210. He is tied second with Singh and Jim Furyk. 

Furyk, in his best since wrist surgery a year ago, carded a 69 and will be paired with the 25-year-old Garcia in the final round. 

Singh played in the final group with Garcia on Saturday and shot a 71. 

Tiger Woods missed many chances on the front nine and failed to make a birdie over the last 11 holes and returned a one-over 73 that left him at one-under 215 ? 11 shots behind Garcia. 

Phil Mickelson was further behind after a 73 and he has a one-over 217 aggregate.

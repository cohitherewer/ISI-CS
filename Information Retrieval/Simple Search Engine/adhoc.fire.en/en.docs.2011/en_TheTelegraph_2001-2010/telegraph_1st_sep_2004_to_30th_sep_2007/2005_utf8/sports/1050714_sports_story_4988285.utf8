 Government directive could stop tour: ICC

Wellington: A clear directive from New Zealands government could halt their national teams cricket tour to Zimbabwe next month without financial penalty, ICC president Eshan Mani has said. 

In a letter to New Zealand foreign minister Phil Goff, Mani said the ICC recognised the right of governments to use sporting sanctions as a tool of foreign policy, but rejected a call to relieve New Zealand of their obligation to tour. He said political decisions should be made by governments, not the ICC. 

Manis message was seen on Wednesday as offering New Zealand a means to stop the tour without resorting to legislation. It also appears to relieve NZC of the threat of financial penalties if the August-September tour does not proceed. 

NZC has said it has no choice under its contractual relationship with the ICC but to proceed with tours in line with the future tours programme. Any failure to do so would incur fines of up to $2 million. 

Meanwhile, the New Zealand government has asked the ICC to clarify whether a resolution constituted a clear directive or if new laws had to be passed. If the ICC is saying that it would be sufficient for the New Zealand Parliament to pass a resolution ... we would welcome that, Goff said.

Calcutta: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar feels that Sourav Ganguly will soon be back with Team India. 

Vengsarkar, who is the chairman of the Talent Research Development Wing of the BCCI, is in the city for the ongoing under-19 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He was present at the Eden on Wednesday to watch East Zone play North. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Vengsarkar said: Sourav still has a lot of cricket left in him. For the past year-and-a-half he was going through a bad phase. Now, he should concentrate on domestic cricket and score more runs, to get back that hunger. All players have bad phases in their career, but they do come out of it. I feel Sourav, too, will succeed. 

Vengsarkar also felt that it was too early to credit the resurgence of Team India to coach Greg Chappell. The whole team is performing well. We have guys like RP Singh, Sreesanth, Raina, Dhoni who are potential match winners, and they are proving themselves. He also said that the infusion of young blood is the joint effort of all the Talent Research and Development Officers (TRDO). 

Vengsarkar said that captain Rahul Dravid should be given more time to prepare with the World Cup in mind. He added that the role of the captain shouldnt be split for the different versions of the game. 

Rahul is scoring runs in both the forms of the game and he should also be given a chance to lead the team in Tests as well, remarked Vengsarkar.

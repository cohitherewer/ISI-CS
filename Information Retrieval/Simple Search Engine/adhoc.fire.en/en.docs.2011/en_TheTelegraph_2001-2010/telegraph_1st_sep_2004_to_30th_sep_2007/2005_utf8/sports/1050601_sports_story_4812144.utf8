The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Value for money, even in defeat

Andrew Baker in Paris

 When Safin is on court you get more than just sport 

It is easy to see why the Parisians are so keen on Marat Safin. He shares many of the qualities of the citizens of the French capital, being mercurial, grumpy, dramatic and occasionally prone to staying out late. Added to which he is named after Jean-Paul Marat, a hero of the French revolution. 

All of which explains why shrieks of Allez Safin echoed around the centre court at Roland Garros Monday evening, when the giant Russian took on Tommy Robredo of Spain. One cannot claim that the court was full, of course: that would be unthinkable unless a French player was involved. But a healthy number of visitors took time out from the traditional pastimes of eating, drinking, shopping and posing to actually watch a tennis match for a change. 

They were amply rewarded, for when Safin is on court you get more than just sport ? you get a one-man soap opera thrown in for free. Safin rages against the elements, the officials, the gods and most of all himself. Last year at this tournament he registered his feelings at a particularly low moment by baring his posterior at the crowd. No doubt a few spectators were here on Monday solely in hope of a repeat performance. 

There was no mooning from Safin, but no shortage of bum notes. Safin, is seeded third, while Robredo, one of the legion of Spaniards raised in a clay-floored cot, is at No 15. So the Russian might have expected to make straightforward progress into the quarter finals. 

But with Safin, nothing is ever straightforward. He has the potential to be magnificent, potential realised in his two Grand Slam victories, at the US Open in 2000 and earlier this year in Australia. 

But the tendency to self-destruct is never far away. Monday the mighty forehand was more dangerous for spectators in the upper tiers than it was for Robredo, and many of his drop-shots didnt drop. 

Cue the repertoire of anguish: the grimaces and yells, the thousand-mile stare and ? a perennial favourite ? abuse of his equipment. 

Safin has smashed more rackets than J. Edgar Hoover, and Mondays performance was right up there with his best, the Russian terminating his racket while making a sizeable hole in the advertising hoarding under his seat. 

Chair abuse, thats a new one. Robredo may not be the best clay-court player in Spain ? there are too many claimants to that title ? but he is a dashing, determined character, prepared to run down any ball. The perfect foil for Safin, in fact, and the pair made an entertaining spectacle. At first, in the fifth, the players took turns to achieve break points and then spurn them. Then, as the last traces of sunshine disappeared, they traded breaks of serve. 

Robredo had a mini-Safin moment of racket-hurling, while the original contented himself with raging at the heavens. Down 6-7, Safin had one more moment of brain fade and his Paris campaign was over for another year.

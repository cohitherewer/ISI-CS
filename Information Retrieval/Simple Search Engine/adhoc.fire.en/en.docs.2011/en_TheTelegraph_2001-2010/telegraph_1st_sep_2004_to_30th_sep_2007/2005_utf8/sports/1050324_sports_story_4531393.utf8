The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I expect the batsmen to again give our bowlers best chance?

 - Perhaps, I must simply play my natural game: Sourav Ganguly

Despite Team India doing well, captain Sourav Ganguly hasn?t been having a great time with the bat. Yet, our most successful Test captain is determined to get it right when the third and final Test (versus Pakistan) gets underway. Sourav spoke to the Media in general and, later, interacted with The Telegraph in his luxury suite at the Taj West End. 

The following are excerpts 

On whether, being 1-0 up, the team won?t mind playing it ?safe? 

Our aim is to win and our mindset is going to be the same as it was in the last few Tests. We haven?t won the series yet. 

On what should make the difference 

Our batting... Big totals enforce big pressure and I expect the batsmen to again give our bowlers the best chance of quickly taking 20 wickets. 

On being in sight of the No. 2 spot in the ICC?s Test rankings 

That?s something we?re aiming for... We know we need a 2-0 scoreline to get there... It will be an achievement for the boys who?ve been together for the past couple of years. 

On whether there?s much less tension now in Indo-Pak matches 

Tension does exist... In fact, our face-offs are always going to have an element of tension and competitiveness. I don?t see them as not being a factor at all. 

On the problem of reading a wicket 

(Grins) With experience, one can get it right six times out of ten. 

On the Chinnaswamy Stadium wicket 

Looks good, has been bound and rolled well. 

On the Pakistan quicks failing to be effective 

Right now, I wouldn?t like to talk about the opposition bowlers... Let this Test get over and, then, I may have something to say. 

On Inzamam being on the verge of his 100th Test 

It?s a great achievement... That he has over 7,000 Test runs and in excess of 10,000 in ODIs underscores just how good he is. Also, he has played over 300 ODIs... 

On John Wright?s tenure getting to its end 

He has been outstanding and I?ve personally had an excellent relationship... The team?s good wishes will always be with him, irrespective of where he goes. 

On the country?s talent pool 

Somebody special is always going to be there... Somebody highly talented will be produced... Sachin Tendulkar came on to the scene a couple of years after Sunil Gavaskar left... Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh have picked up from where the great spinners of the Sixties and Seventies left off... 

Finally, on his form 

In Calcutta itself, I said I need runs... Perhaps, I ought to be that much more determined... Perhaps, I must simply play my natural game... Perhaps, I should just take it easy. After all, haven?t I already given everything for India?

Cincinnati: Rafael Nadals 16-match unbeaten streak was brought to a halt by Czech teenager Tomas Berdych on Tuesday. The world No. 2 lost 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-7 (3-7) in the first round of the Cincinnati Masters. 

Fresh from his ninth title of the season at the Montreal Masters on Sunday, the Spaniard blew three match points in the final set before Berdych took the decisive tie-breaker after almost three hours of pulsating action. 

The two 19-year-olds fought a stunning battle, the Czech plundering huge winners from the baseline and Nadal chasing down everything as if he was playing his first, and not his 74th, match of the year. 

The French Open champion snatched the first set 7-4 in a tie-break but Berdych, currently ranked 36, hit back to take the second. 

Berdych, who beat Roger Federer in the first round of the Olympic Games last year, roared back to level the match and then looked poised for victory when he broke to lead 5-4 in the third set. 

Nadal refused to give up, and after breaking back, held three match points in the 12th game ? only for Berdych to save them all. 

A double-fault by Nadal gave Berdych three match points, and he clinched victory on the first to set up a second-round match against Russian Mikhail Youzhny. 

Earlier, Australian Open champion Marat Safin and Lleyton Hewitt returned to winning ways. 

The fourth-seeded Safin ? playing his first match since Wimbledon after undergoing treatment on his left knee ? defeated Czech qualifier Jan Hernych 7-6 (7-3), 6-4. 

Hewitt, the third seed, beat Russian Igor Andreev 6-3, 6-4, and set up a meeting with Britains Greg Rusedski. 

Safin recovered from a slow start after failing twice to break Hernychs serve. But after winning the tie-break, he ran out a comfortable winner. 

Ive been out for a month and a half and I havent really practice before this, Safin said. Its difficult to come back and play at such a high level. I was also a little nervous. My knee still hurts a bit. I am afraid to move fast. Hopefully, it will get better. 

The Russian now faces British wild card Andy Murray who ousted American Taylor Dent 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-1).

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Prakash, Anand bow out in doubles

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: The 2,000-odd fans at the SDAT Stadium shouted themselves hoarse, egging on the sons of their famous citizens ? Vijay and Anand Amritraj. Prakash and Anand did give them moments to rejoice but, in the end, flattered to deceive. The German-Swede combine of Karsten Braasch and Robert Lindstedt won 2-6, 7-5, 4-6. 

In an up-and-down first-round doubles match at the Chennai Open, the Indian wild cards did well to brush aside a first-set rout and a 2-4 second deficit with some spirited tennis. They went a break up in the decider as well, to lead 4-1, but then lost the next five games and the match. 

Prakash, Vijay?s son, was the more solid, while Anand?s son was more of a showman. The two cousins played just two matches together last year, losing both. One of them was at this very tournament. 

A couple of fine results in 2003 had raised visions of another Team Amritraj emerging as a force. Obviously, that process has been greatly delayed, not the least because they don?t play together often enough.

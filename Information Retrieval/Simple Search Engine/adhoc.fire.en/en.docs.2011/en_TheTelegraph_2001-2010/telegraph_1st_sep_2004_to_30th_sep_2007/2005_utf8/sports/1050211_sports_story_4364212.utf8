 Depleted Dutch hold England

Birmingham: England had to settle for a goalless draw with the Netherlands on Wednesday in a closely-fought but uninspiring friendly at Villa Park. The best chances all fell in the opening 45 minutes. Dutch forward Dirk Kuijt hit the post and England missed three great opportunities, two of which fell to Shaun Wright-Phillips on his first start for his country. 

Both managers looked to experiment before next month?s World Cup qualifiers, with England playing with an unconvincing 4-3-3 formation and giving a place to debutants, striker Andy Johnson and left-sided midfielder Stewart Downing. 

Germany and Argentina, old World Cup rivals and favourites for the 2006 edition, fought out a 2-2 draw in Duesseldorf on Wednesday in a friendly. 

Elsewhere, however, several of Europe?s other powers appeared to have their minds on next weekend?s club matches as they played out a series of limp friendlies, as usual blighted by mass substitutions. 

France drew their fifth successive home match when they finished 1-1 with Sweden while European championship runners-up Portugal barely broke sweat in losing 0-1 in Ireland. 

Italy did manage to raise themselves to beat Russia 2-0 while the Czech Republic won 3-0 in Slovenia. 

In Duesseldorf, where Hernan Crespo twice equalised for Argentina, with a penalty and a spectacular late chip. Germany took the lead in the 28th minute with a Torsten Frings penalty before Crespo levelled with a second spot-kick five minutes before the break. 

Germany went back in front through a Kevin Kuranyi goal at the stroke of halftime but were denied a morale-boosting win when Crespo floated in his second equaliser nine minutes from time. 

After a quiet opening half in Rome, Italy woke up after the break as goals by Alberto Gilardino and Simone Barone brought a comfortable win over Russia. (Reuters)

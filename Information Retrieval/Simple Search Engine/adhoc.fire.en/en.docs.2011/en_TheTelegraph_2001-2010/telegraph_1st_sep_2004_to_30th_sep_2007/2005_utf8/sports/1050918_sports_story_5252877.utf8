 Ponting hurt by Lillee comments

 - Its easy to make judgements from a long way away, says Australian captain 

 Ponting feels Lillee has never been of any help 

Sydney: Ricky Ponting admits he was stung by Dennis Lillees call for his dismissal as Australia cricket captain and stunned by the public backlash following the Ashes series loss to England. 

Ponting became the first Australian captain to lose an Ashes series since 1986-87, when his side went down 1-2 in the five-match series that finished earlier this week in London. 

While Englands win sparked euphoric celebrations, the performance of No.1-ranked Australia has been heavily criticised. 

Lillee, an Australian fast bowling legend, suggested 36-year-old leg-spinner Shane Warne should lead the team and Ponting should concentrate on his batting. 

Everybody is entitled to their opinion, but the thing that gets me down most is that I dont think Dennis Lillee would have one idea of what goes on around our team, Ponting told an Australian newspaper. 

Lillee hasnt been spotted. He hasnt been of any help to any of the guys when its been needed over the last few years ? its easy to make judgements from a long way away. 

Ponting returned to Australia on Wednesday, when Lillees opinions were published in Western Australia. Lillee wasnt alone among leading former internationals in criticising the team, although his comments were the most pointed. 

But Ponting remains defiant. 

 As long as Im doing everything right for my teammates and for everyone concerned with Australian cricket, I will always feel Im doing my job right, he said. For Dennis to sit back and say I should be sacked and be replaced by Warne, it hurts to a certain degree. 

Leading into the Ashes, Australia had won six consecutive series after Ponting, 30, replaced Steve Waugh as captain ? starting with a 3-0 win in Sri Lanka last year. 

Weve had an unbelievably good run over a long period but its all changed fairly dramatically over the last few weeks, Ponting said. Its a strange feeling for all of us. 

We all understand how much the Ashes means to a lot of Australians because it certainly means a lot to us. 

None of us have ever played in a series where we have lost the Ashes, obviously, and some of the guys have never even played in a losing series full stop ? the good thing is the next (Ashes) series is less than 18 months away, which is exciting. 

Ponting said the Australian line-up never performed at its best in England, starting with the limited-overs series which included a shock loss to lowly Bangladesh. 

Despite an ongoing review by Cricket Australia of the three-month tour, Ponting didnt anticipate wholesale changes when Australia regroup for the three one-day Internationals and six-day super Test against the Rest of the World XIs next month.

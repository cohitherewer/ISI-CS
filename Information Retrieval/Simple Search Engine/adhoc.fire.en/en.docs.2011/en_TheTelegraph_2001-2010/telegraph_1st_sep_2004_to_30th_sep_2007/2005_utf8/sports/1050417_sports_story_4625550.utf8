 London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has questioned Chelsea?s statement that the club?s chief executive Peter Kenyon met United defender Rio Ferdinand by chance in a London restaurant. On Tuesday, the Premier League leaders said the meeting between Ferdinand and Kenyon had been accidental and that they were not trying to sign the England centre-back.

 However, Ferguson said he doubted Chelsea?s version of events. ?That might be somebody else?s view (that it was by chance) but it is not my view,? Ferguson said: ?I?m just letting my supporters know that I?m not happy with it. We believe Rio Ferdinand (that he did not know Kenyon was there). Whatever way he was enticed to the meeting.? 

 Frankfurt: Organisers of the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany said they had exposed a fraudulent attempt from the United States to obtain two million match tickets. The addresses supplied in the applications though internet were fraudulent, organisers found.

 ?The orders were based on irregular addresses to obscure the identity of the sender,? said a statement from the organising committee. ?We contacted people by telephone who supposedly placed orders. Of those we reached, none had placed orders.?

 Mumbai: Chin-Wei Chan of Taipei won her second straight women?s ITF title after overcoming Rushmi Chakravarthy 6-4, 6-2 in 70 minutes at the MSLTA complex on Saturday. The second-seeded Chin-wei, who had triumphed in Andheri last week, committed fewer errors than the Indian whose game swung from the good to the average. While Chin-wei was richer by $2940, Rushmi earned $1666. 

 Charleston: Lindsay Davenport?s hopes of winning back-to-back claycourt titles for the first time ended on Friday when she retired injured from her Family Circle Cup quarter final against Justine Henin-Hardenne. The world No. 1 had treatment to her right hip midway through the first set and, after Henin-Hardenne levelled, she quit when trailing 0-1 in the third set. Davenport said she first felt the injury on Thursday and aggravated it in the second game of the match.

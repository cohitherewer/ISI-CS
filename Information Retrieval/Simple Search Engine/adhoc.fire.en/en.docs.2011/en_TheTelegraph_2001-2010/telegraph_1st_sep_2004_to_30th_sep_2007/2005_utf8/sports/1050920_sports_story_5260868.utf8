 Basu-Mitra camp wins

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Swapan Sadhan Basu-Anjan Mitra camp got the mandate to rule Mohun Bagan club for the next three years. 

They defeated the challengers, led by assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury, by a margin of 518 votes. The verdict will officially be announced on Tuesday. 

There was some drama in the morning as the process of counting got delayed. It happened because the polling agents of both groups, as well as some of the independent candidates, wanted a closer look at the counting. 

It eventually began at 1.30 pm, three-and-a-half-hour after the scheduled time. 

After the counting of the first 100 ballots, the Basu-Mitra camp was leading by 10 votes and as the day wore on, they increased the lead gradually. 

In all, 4289 voters out of 6500 exercised their franchise. Keeping that figure in mind, the Chowdhury-camp put up a significant fight. 

Polling took place on Sunday amid unprecedented security at and around the venue, the Town Hall. Elections were being held at the club after 15 years.

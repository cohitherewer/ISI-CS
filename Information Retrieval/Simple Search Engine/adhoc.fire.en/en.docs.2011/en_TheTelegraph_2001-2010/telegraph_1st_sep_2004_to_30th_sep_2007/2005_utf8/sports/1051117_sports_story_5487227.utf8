Multan: Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria took four wickets and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar three to spur Pakistan to a 22-run win over England on a thrilling final day of the first Test on Wednesday. 

England, chasing 198 for victory, started the day on 24 for one and were bowled out for 175 half-an-hour after lunch. Kaneria turned the tide for Pakistan after the overnight pair of Andrew Strauss (23) and Ian Bell (31) had put on 57 for the second wicket and looked like piloting England to victory. 

England lost six wickets for 53 runs before lunch, three of them to Kaneria. 

Shoaib, who took six wickets in the match, then broke an obdurate eighth wicket stand of 49 between Geraint Jones and Shaun Udal which had brought England to within 32 runs of a win. Kaneria finished with four for 64 and Shoaib three for 49. Pacer Mohammed Sami took the important wickets of Paul Collingwood and Kevin Pietersen. 

It was only the fourth defeat for England in 29 Tests since October 2003 and followed their Ashes series defeat of world champions Australia. 

England got a formidable first innings lead of 144 runs after it made 418 in reply to Pakistans 274. Pakistan were bowled out for 341 in their second innings on Tuesday and it left England needing 198 runs for victory. 

It was Pakistans first successful defence of a total under 200 since 1993 when they bowled out New Zealand for 93 in Hamilton defending 125 runs. 

The next two Tests are in Faisalabad and Lahore. 

Kaneria turned the tide for Pakistan when he dismissed overnight pair Strauss and Bell in one over. He took three wickets for 14 runs in 20 balls as England lost six wickets before lunch. 

In his third over Kaneria had Bell caught behind by Kamran Akmal and four balls later Strauss caught at slip. 

In the next over Sami trapped Paul Collingwood (3) with an indipper to leave England on 67 for four. 

Kaneria struck a killer blow five overs later when he had Andrew Flintoff caught at deep square leg by Younis Khan. 

Kevin Pietersen hit Kaneria for a six and a four and looked comfortable for the first time on tour, but he was out to a poor shot. 

The eighth-wicket pair of Jones (33) and Udal (18), playing in his first Test, revived the innings from a desperate 117 for seven with a fighting stand of 49 before they were split apart by Shoaib. 

Shoaib bowled Jones off an inside edge in his first over after lunch. 

 Hoggard penalised 

Meanwhile, Matthew Hoggard was fined 20 per cent of his match fee on Wednesday for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. 

The England fast bowler was reported for excessive appealing by umpires Simon Taufel and Billy Bowden as he celebrated the dismissal of Pakistan opening batsman Salman Butt on Tuesday. He was later adjudged guilty by match referee Roshan Mahanama. 

The ICC also fined each member of the Pakistan team 10 per cent of their match fees after the hosts fell two overs short, with Inzamam-ul Haq being fined double.

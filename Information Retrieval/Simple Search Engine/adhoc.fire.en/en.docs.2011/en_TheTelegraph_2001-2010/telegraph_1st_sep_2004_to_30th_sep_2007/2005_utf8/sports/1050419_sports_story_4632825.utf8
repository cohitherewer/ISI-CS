 Organisers planning Grand Slam format

London: Organisers of the five big city marathons are planning to launch a Grand Slam format with a special bonus for any athlete who wins the London, New York City, Boston, Chicago and Berlin races. 

?I can confirm there have been discussions but there?s nothing in place yet,? London race director Dave Bedford said. ?I would prefer not to comment any further at the moment.? 

Sources close to another of the big marathons said the five race directors had met at St Etienne in France last month during the world cross country championships to discuss closer co-operation. They said a Grand Slam proposal was likely to be announced during the world athletics championships in Helsinki this August. 

New York race director Mary Wittenberg said all the race directors were in constant contact. 

?We see the opportunity to take the sport to a new level,? she said. ?And we all want the title of the world?s best marathon. ?We have the opportunity to look beyond ourselves. We look at other sports, we look at soccer, we look at NASCAR. We see the benefit some of the major sports organisations have derived from being much more than single events.?

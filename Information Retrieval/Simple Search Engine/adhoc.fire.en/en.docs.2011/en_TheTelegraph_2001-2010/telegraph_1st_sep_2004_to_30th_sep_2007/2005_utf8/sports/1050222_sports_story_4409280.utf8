 Wilson set to play after 12 years

 Wilson will replace Styris 

Christchurch: Former rugby All Black Jeff Wilson will return to international cricket for the first time in 12 years on Tuesday when he takes the field against Australia. 

Wilson gets his chance in the second of five one-day Internationals against the world?s top side after New Zealand allrounder Scott Styris was ruled out with a knee injury. 

Styris has suffered in recent weeks with bruising to the bone on his left knee, and after soreness at training on Monday he was advised to rest. 

Wilson will be picking up where he left off after playing four one-day Internationals against Australia in 1993 before embarking on a glittering decade-long All Black rugby career. 

He is being rewarded for a promising return for New Zealand against a World XI side last month in a series to raise funds for tsunami relief. The games did not have full international status. 

?It will be a big one for him but I?ve got no doubt he can step up,? captain Stephen Fleming said. (AFP)

Calcutta: Powered by Ranty Martins? hattrick, Dempo Sports Club shocked defending champions East Bengal 3-2 in their ninth round tie of the National Football League for the ONGC Cup at the Nehru Stadium in Goa on Thursday. 

According to information reaching here, Bhaichung Bhutia and Juliano Martins scored for the red-and-gold brigade. It was Nigerian Martins, who put the home side into lead in the 10th minute. 

Few minutes latter, Dempo had a penalty appeal turned down when defender Syed Rahim Nabi seemed to have pulled down R.C. Prakash inside the danger zone. 

Sensing trouble, East Bengal coach Subhash Bhowmick replaced Madhab Das for Sasthi Duley and the move worked as East Bengal put the rival defence under pressure and capitalised on a defensive error by Raju Singh, who instead of clearing the ball off a long pass from Alvito D?Cunha back passed to keeper Satish Kumar, which Bhutia intercepted and scored to restore parity in the 25th minute. 

The hosts shot into the lead once again when Martins netted his second two minutes after the breather. The Goan outfit bolstered their lead in the 75th minute and the margin was reduced by East Bengal?s Brazilian recruit Juliano, one minute from time. 

After Dempo having snatched the lead for the second time, East Bengal pressed hard for the equaliser and coach Subhas Bhowmick effected the final substitution supplanting Ernest Jeremiah in place of Sashthi Duley in the 69 th minute. 

Earlier, East Bengal brought Sashthi and Juliano in in place of Madhab Das and Shylo Malsawmtluanga, respectively. 

East Bengal remain on 21 points after 10 outings while Dempo are one less after nine.

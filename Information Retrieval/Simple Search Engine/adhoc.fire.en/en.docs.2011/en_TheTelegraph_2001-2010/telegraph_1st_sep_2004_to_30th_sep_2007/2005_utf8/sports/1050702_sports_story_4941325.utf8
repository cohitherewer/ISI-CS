 Inter, Vieri part ways

Milan: Italy striker Christian Vieri is a free agent and could move to England after his contract with Inter Milan was surprisingly cancelled on Friday. 

Inter said on their official website: Inter and Christian Vieri have decided to rescind the players contract by mutual consent with the club, due to expire on June 30, 2006. 

According to an Italian daily, English club Tottenham Hotspur was the most likely destination for the burly forward, adding that he is keen to play in the Premier League. 

While Inter gave no reason for the decision, Italian media reported that Vieri was unhappy at his increasingly marginal role under coach Roberto Mancini. 

Vieri was one of the best paid players in Italy, earning a reported 12 million euros a year including sponsorship and marketing deals. 

Negotiations between the player and the club progressed smoothly, and the documents related to the issue were registered at the Lega Calcio (Football League) offices this morning, said Inters statement. 

FC Internazionale thanks Christian Vieri for his contribution to the history of the club over the past six years. 

Christian Vieri thanks Inter and its fans for the professional respect and affection which characterised the relationship, the statement said. 

Vieri joined Inter from Lazio in 1999 for a then world record fee of $50m, having played for Spanish club Atletico Madrid and Juventus. 

Inter were the strikers ninth club in a much-travelled career which began with Torino. 

Last season he found himself frequently out of the side with coach Roberto Mancini preferring Brazilian Adriano and Nigerian Obafemi Martins in attack. (Reuters)

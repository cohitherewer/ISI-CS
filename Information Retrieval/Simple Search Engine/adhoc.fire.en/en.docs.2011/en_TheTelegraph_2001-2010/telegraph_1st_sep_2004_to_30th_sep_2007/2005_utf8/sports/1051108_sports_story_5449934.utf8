 New York: Amelie Mauresmo of France won her third consecutive Advanta Championship by beating Russian Elena Dementieva 7-5, 2-6, 7-5 in the final in Philadelphia on Sunday.

 Mauresmo joins Steffi Graf as the other three-time winner of the event, which moves to Madrid next year. Graf was champion in 1992, 1995 and 1998.

 The third-seeded Mauresmo, the world?s fourth-ranked player, won for the third time this season on the eve of the WTA Tour Championships, which start on Tuesday in Los Angeles.

 ?It?s a great effort to win this three times in a row,? Mauresmo said as the tournament ended a 21-year run in Villanova.

 Atlanta: American Heath Slocum clinched his second PGA Tour title with a two-shot victory at the Southern Farm Classic in Madison, Mississippi, on Sunday. His maiden PGA Tour victory came at last year?s Tucson Classic.

 Slocum, 31, birdied five of the first eight holes on his way to a six-under-par 66 and a 72-hole total of 21-under 267. Tied for the lead at 20 under with Loren Roberts with two holes to play, Slocum holed a nine-foot birdie putt at the par-four 17th to take control.

 Roberts returned a 68 to share second place at 19 under with Sweden?s Carl Pettersson (67). Overnight leader Joey Snyder III finished a shot back in fourth after returning a 70. 

 London: Britain?s Olympic curlers are using state-of-the art technology to give themselves an edge as they prepare to defend the country?s only Winter Games gold medal since 1984. The secret weapon is... a broom.

 Loaded with sensors and a memory card, the ?sweep ergometer? allows curlers to measure how well they are performing one of the game?s crucial tasks: sweeping the ice in front of the stone to help guide it perfectly to the target.

 Beijing: China grabbed more than half the gold medals on offer at the East Asian Games in Macau but the most gratifying of those 127 victories came on Sunday when the men?s team beat North Korea 1-0 in the soccer final.

 ?It is the first time that China has won a men?s soccer title at an international multi-sports event,? state-run Xinhua news agency said of the victory in the event billed as a dress rehearsal for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

 China had already lost to North Korea in the group stages, but set up a gold-medal rematch after edging Japan 2-1 in the semi-finals.

 Rio de Janeiro: Tevez scored a superb hattrick as Brazilian championship leaders Corinthians hammered last year?s champions Santos 7-1 on Sunday to take a step closer to the title.

 Corinthians stayed six points ahead of Internacional, who beat Ponte Preta 2-1 with headed goals from defenders Vinicius and Edigle, and Fluminense, who beat Figueirense 2-0.

 Moscow: Brazilian coach Ivo Wortman has been sacked by Dynamo Moscow following a string of poor results, the Russian premier league side said on Monday. On Sunday Dynamo suffered their third consecutive defeat, going down 1-2 to city rivals CSKA Moscow, who clinched their second title in three years with a game to spare.

 Difficult to describe my feelings

When the umpires made that final decision last night (Monday), my feelings were difficult to describe. 

Winning the Ashes was an amazing moment, and I wish I could take it all in, the whole intense excitement. I know one shouldnt say: Life will never get better than this. But you wonder how it can. 

It was a strange sort of ending, which only cricket could throw up. We had known for some time that the game was effectively over, and the ideal situation would have been to be out there on the pitch, all together, when the umpires finally called it a day. 

But Im not bothered about that now. When you win the Ashes, you will take it any which way. It was a special moment for us as we stood on our balcony overlooking the ground, the crowd cheering and the champagne on ice. Maybe those watching didnt feel the tension as intensely yesterday as we did. Sure, the game didnt reach a hairline finish in the same way that the last three Tests did. 

But let me tell you, for a long time there the game was incredibly close. The Ashes were there, ready for the taking. And the Australians nearly went and snatched them. 

We knew it would be hard work on Day V at The Oval. 

Spinners are always a menace towards the end of games here, and we are playing against the worlds best. Shane Warne made clinching this game 10 times tougher than it would normally be. 

They got off to a great start, and when Michael Vaughan went I knew we would be in a real dogfight. But Kevin Pietersens innings was out of this world. What a time to deliver. 

Kevin played so positively, which is probably the best way of doing it. 

After lunch, he went off like a maniac ? that was a turning point even, and you could feel it change the momentum of the game. Suddenly we were up to about 180 ahead, and every run then was like another little nail in the coffin. 

The minimum lead we wanted to get was 210, but I reckon 240 was the kind of score we could have defended, on a fifth-day wicket and with time pressure on our side. When we had about 25 overs left, we just started celebrating. For Ashley Giles, that was a great moment to get your highest score. His batting has been absolutely crucial in the last two games. 

The memory of our lap of honour is one to treasure. It was so good I could have gone around three times. The crowd were brilliant, as they have been all summer. 

Now Im going to take a couple of weeks off, just trying to take it in. This series has been so great Im already looking forward to watching it all over again.

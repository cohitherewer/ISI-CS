 Syces cause another postponement 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The Poonawalla Mysore Derby has been postponed yet again, but for a different reason this time, according to Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) sources. The Derby was originally scheduled for October 23 but the unprecedented rain in Mysore had forced the Mysore Race Club (MRC) stewards to postpone it to Friday. 

 MRC was all set to stage the biggest event of the season even without the three Derby contenders who were stabled in Bangalore but were not allowed to leave the station by the striking syces there. But a wild cat strike by their Mysore counterparts, expressing solidarity with the aggrieved Bangalore brethren, changed it all.

 The Derby has been postponed again to November 3 but the clouds of uncertainty have not been cleared, said the source. However, the Karnataka Trainers Association (KTA) will be having a meeting with the BTC syces union on Saturday to sort out the issue.

 The main grievance of the Bangalore syces have been a quick settlement of their pending bonus payments. Allegations of rude behaviour by some senior professionals with the stable hands is the other issue which will be discussed in the meeting, the source added.

 Interestingly, the Bangalore winter season begins from November 5 and another postponement at this stage may jeopardise all schedules. For all you know, the Mysore Derby may finally be held in Bangalore, said another source in Bangalore.

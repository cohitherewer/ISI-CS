 Armstrong trial

Rome: Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong will go on trial for defamation next year after losing a preliminary hearing against Italian rider Filippo Simeoni on Wednesday. 

Italian judge Nicola Insiti decided Armstrong should go on trial in Simeonis home town of Latina on March 7 after he called Simeoni a liar in an interview in 2003.

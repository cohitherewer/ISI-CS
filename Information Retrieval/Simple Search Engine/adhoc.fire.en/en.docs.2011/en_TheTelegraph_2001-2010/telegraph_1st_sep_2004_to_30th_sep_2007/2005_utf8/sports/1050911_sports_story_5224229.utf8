The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Man United held by City 

 London: Champions Chelsea notched up their 

 fifth Premier League victory of the season with a routine 

 2-0 win over bottom club Sunderland on Saturday. 

 Manchester United were held to a 1-1 draw by local 

 rivals City at Old Trafford, Charlton Athletic recorded 

 their fourth successive win, 1-0 at Birmingham City, and 

 England striker Michael Owen had a quiet Newcastle United 

 debut as his side drew 1-1 with Fulham. 

Chelsea were frustrated by Sunderland in a dull first half at Stamford Bridge but broke the deadlock after 54 minutes when Cameroon midfielder Geremi took advantage of a poor throw by Sunderland keeper Mike Pollitt to score. 

The champions dominated the rest of the match and doubled their advantage when striker Didier Drogba rose at the far post to head home a terrific cross by fellow substitute Damien Duff. 

I am very happy to win this match and I am very happy to have such strength on the bench, said Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. 

 It was Sunderlands fifth defeat of the season and 20th Premier League loss in a row. 

United dominated the Manchester derby and went ahead on the stroke of halftime when Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy lashed home the rebound after his initial shot was well saved by City keeper David James. City defended well and snatched a draw to maintain their unbeaten start to the season when midfielder Joey Barton stabbed the ball home from close range 14 minutes from time. 

City striker Andrew Cole almost grabbed an unlikely victory against his former club when his stoppage-time shot was brilliantly tipped over the crossbar by United keeper Edwin van Der Sar. 

The performance was good and we controlled the match, United manager Alex Ferguson said after his side dropped their first points of the season.

 Negi wins with white 

 - CORUS MEET 

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherland): Viswanathan Anand was struggling to get a half point against Hungarian GM Peter Leko in the third round of the Corus chess tournament on Sunday. 

Having drawn the first game against Russian GM Alexander Grischuk quite easily, Anand did not quite get in to his groove in his important encounter against Leko and was an exchange down without any material compensation at the time of going to the press. 

Meanwhile, in the group C there was some good news for Indian followers as youngster Parimarjan Negi defeated WGM Tea-Bosboom Lanchava of The Netherlands in a fine attacking game. 

Playing white Negi faced the Pirs defence and won a piece displaying his excellent imagination. 

In other matches, GM Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria did another smart act by defeating third seed Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Topalov took his tally to two points from as many games and now leads solely in the event. 

Playing black, Topalov looked in the same demolition mood that he had acquired in the last fide world championship in Tripoli in Libya. There the Bulgarian was in awesome form and had scored 9.5/10 before being ousted by the eventual winner Rustam Kasimdzhznov of Uzbekistan in the tiebreak games. 

It was a Sicilian Nazdorf and expectedly an English attack by Kramnik who played white. 

Of late Kramnik has been trying to establish himself in attack too but it was more of a damper to such initiations.

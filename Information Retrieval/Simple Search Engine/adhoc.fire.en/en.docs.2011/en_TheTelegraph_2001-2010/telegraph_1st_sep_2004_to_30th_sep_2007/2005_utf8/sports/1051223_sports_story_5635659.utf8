 Jayasuriya in squad for NZ, Australia

Colombo: Sri Lankan selectors brought back veteran Sanath Jayasuriya for two limited-overs series in New Zealand and Australia starting later this month. The 36-year-old left-hander had been dropped from the just-concluded Test series against India after a poor run in the one-dayers which India won 6-1. 

But Indias 2-0 victory in the Test series on Thursday forced the selectors to bring back their most experienced player. 

Jayasuriya will undergo a fitness test before the teams departure for New Zealand next week. 

Sanath has been putting up some big scores consistently in the domestic competition and we are happy with his form, chairman of selectors Lalith Kaluperuma said.

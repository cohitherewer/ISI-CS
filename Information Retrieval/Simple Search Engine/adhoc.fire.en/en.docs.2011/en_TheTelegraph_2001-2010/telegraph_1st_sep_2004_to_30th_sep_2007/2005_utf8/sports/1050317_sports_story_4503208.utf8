 Sergeant Slipper wins thriller 

STAR RACER

 Calcutta: A series of close finishes kept the mid-week crowd on its toes and the main event in the afternoon?s card, the Goodfellas Cup, was no exception.The 1,200m sprint witnessed a fiery battle for supremacy between Maseyk kin, Malcom and Melvyn, riding the topweighted Ever Lasting Love and the lightly handicapped Sergeant Slipper, respectively. However, Melvyn ended up in the winning bracket, though failing to stop Sergeant Slipper from drifting out under pressure. Malcom, who was seen making a desperate effort, belted the horse excessively. He was suspended for two race days for the offence ? his third.

 The Navy Cup, over an identical trip, was, however, no contest for trainer Vijay Singh?s Serrafina, who was brought back to the sprint after her unsuccessful effort in a mile race. Jockey C. Alford, who guided the four-year-old filly, also assisted Vijay saddle Awesome Star to victory in the 1,100m Apar Shakti Plate. The Brave Hunter-Take A Powder three-year-old, however, faced a strong challenge from Daniel David?s Pay Check who was taken to a start-to-finish mission by jockey N. Akhtar. The Ajaad-Hazard?s Way son was beaten about 20m from home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport

 Friday, January 07, 2005 

 Hong Kong: Former world No. 1 Serena Williams said Thursday she felt ready to regain her former glory ahead of her first appearance of 2005 at an exhibition event here. The injury-troubled American star failed to win a Grand Slam event last season for the first time in two years, a rapid decline after dominating the women?s game in 2002 and 2003. 

 Her patchy form and stated fondness to pursue careers in acting and fashion design even led to speculation about whether the 23-year-old still had the hunger to be the best.

 But Williams, who will play doubles in the Hong Kong Challenge tournament, has no doubts she can return. ?Oh yeah, definitely for sure,? Williams said when asked if she could return to the top. ?I have no issues. Definitely, I don?t think there would be any problems,? added Williams.

 Durban: A British cricket fan has been arrested for scribbling racial and anti-Jew profanities at the Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town where England and South Africa are playing the third match of their five-Test series. Police said the 30-year-old, identified as Matthew Willow, was a British supporter following the England team around the country.

 ?The man was seen drawing the racial and anti-Zionist slogans on the seats at the stadium,? a police spokesperson in Cape Town Thursday. ?He has already been charged and has been released on bail of r 1,000. We understand that he is due to leave the country sometime next week.? 

 Frankfurt: Midfielder Hanno Balitsch is to leave Bayer Leverkusen to join Bundesliga rivals FSV Mainz for an undisclosed fee. Leverkusen sporting director Michael Reschke said Balitsch, 24, who has made one full international appearance for Germany, would sign a contract running until 2008. ?We respect Hanno?s decision to go and wish him the best for his stay at Mainz,? Reschke said. Leverkusen take on Liverpool in the first knockout round of the Champions League.

 Mainz have also re-signed 28-year-old German striker Michael Thurk, who helped them to promotion last season before moving on to Energie Cottbus. 

 Ouagadougou: Bernard Simondi has been named as the coach of Burkina Faso just days after Ivica Todorov was sacked, the football federation said on Thursday. The 51-year-old Frenchman has been asked to revive Burkina Faso?s World Cup qualifying campaign after three losses in their five group matches in 2004.

 Burkina Faso are fifth in their African Zone Group 2 standings and resume their campaign on March with a home match against the Cape Verde Islands. Simondi has previous experience in Africa as coach of Guinea during the 2002 World Cup qualifiers as well as working in Benin and Tunisia.

 Frankfurt: Borussia Dortmund?s main investor has accused players of complacency and demanded further pay cuts from management to help overhaul the struggling club, the Bild newspaper reported on Thursday. 

 Germany?s only listed soccer club is struggling 

 with record debt and threatened with demotion to the second 

 league, languishing in 14th place in the 18-team Bundesliga 

 since the end of the first half of the season.

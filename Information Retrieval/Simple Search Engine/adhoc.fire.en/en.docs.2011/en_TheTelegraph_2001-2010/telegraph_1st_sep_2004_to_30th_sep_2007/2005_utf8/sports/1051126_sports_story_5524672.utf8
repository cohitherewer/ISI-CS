 Strasbourg, Boro through

London: Racing Strasbourg, bottom of Ligue 1 and without a league win this season, secured their place in the last 32 of the Uefa Cup on Thursday with a 1-1 draw at AS Roma. Middlesbrough and Olympique Marseille joined them in reaching the knockout stage. 

Boro drew 0-0 at last seasons semi-finalists AZ Alkmaar. Marseille overcame Heerenveen 1-0 with a last-minute penalty. 

Strasbourgs Uefa Cup progress has contrasted starkly with their desperate domestic form, the French club without a win in 15 league games. A point against Roma took them to seven points in Group E and they were full value for the draw in the Italian capital after defender Habib Bellaid had scored with a fine drive on 52 minutes. 

Italy striker Antonio Cassano equalised 17 minutes from time after firing in Shabani Nondas pass. 

Marseille made sure of reaching the knockout stage with a late penalty from Nigerian defender Taye Taiwo. The beaten 2004 finalists top Group F with six points from two matches and will qualify, whatever the outcome of their remaining two games. 

Holders CSKA Moscow maintained their interest with their first victory in the group, Brazilian Vagner Love scoring two goals in a 2-1 win. (Reuters)

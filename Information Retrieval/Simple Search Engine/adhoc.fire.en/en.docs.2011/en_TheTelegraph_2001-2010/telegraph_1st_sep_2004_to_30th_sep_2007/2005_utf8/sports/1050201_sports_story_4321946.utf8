 La Fantasie may be hard to toss 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: There is no looking beyond La Fantasie in the 1,200m Kabuki Cup, the main event in Tuesday?s race card.

Drawn poorly in a big field, the Predappio-La Rucherie 

filly had placed close to Noble Investment. With the draw in her favour this time, 

the Daniel David trainee is expected to give a winning ride to jockey Imran Chisty 

who may also be seen at advantage on Dream Sovereign and Amazing Career. The 1,400m 

INS Hooghly may see Harivnder singh Bath?s Allenby winning the trophy. The Excalibur?s 

Lake-Olympic Way son is well in at the weights.

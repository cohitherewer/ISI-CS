Calcutta: Five top ranking Indian paddlers ? S. Sharath Kamal, Soumyadeep Roy, Subhajit Saha, Poulami Ghatak and Mouma Das ? will meet Union sports minister Sunil Dutt on Thursday, seeking more government assistance towards the development of the game in the country. 

To make our presence felt in the international arena, we need more foreign exposure. We will make an appeal to the sports minister in this regard, Soumyadeep Roy, Indias No. 2 paddler, told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The likes of Soumyadeep, Sharath, Subhajit will be heading for pro-tours in Chile (Chile Open), Brazil (Brazil Open) and the US (US Open) during the months of June and July. 

My world ranking is above 200 and I want to improve on my ranking this year by playing more international meets, Soumyadeep said. On meeting Dutt, Soumyadeep said they will ask for more modern facilities of training before the major international tournaments. 

The newly-recruited French coach Hubert Hustache, who is holding a camp at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) eastern Centre, informed that TTFI had consulted him before deciding on the names of the paddlers who will interact with the minister and put forward their appeal. 

Hustache, who earlier wanted the camp to be held in Bangalore, seemed quite happy with the facilities here. It doesnt matter where the camp is held, he said. 

I am focusing on the Commonwealth table tennis meet to be held in Melbourne early next year. That is my first priority, Sharath said. 

Sharath, ranked 186th in the world, will also be looking to improve his ranking by playing more professional tournaments. I would like to break into the top 100, he said.

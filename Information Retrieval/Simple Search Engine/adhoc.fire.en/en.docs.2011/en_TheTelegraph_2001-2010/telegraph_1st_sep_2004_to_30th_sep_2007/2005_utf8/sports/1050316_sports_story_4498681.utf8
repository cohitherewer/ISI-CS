The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Another loss for Bagan

 - NFL TIE vs FRANSA 

 Beto?s goal came too late 

Margao: Mohun Bagan started their campaign in the second phase on a disastrous note when they went down to Fransa 1-2 in the 12th round match of the National Football League for ONGC Cup at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday. 

Fransa, who beat the green-maroons in the first phase by an identical margin in Calcutta, netted through Man-of-the-Match Peter Rodrigues (15th minute) and Benjamin Ansah (66th). 

After missing a couple of sitters, former champions Mohun Bagan reduced the margin in the 81st minute when Brazilian Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? headed home a cross from Rennedy Singh. 

The green-maroons, who had a bumpy ride in the first phase, were looking to start their second phase on a winning note, but failed to impress as they lacked the killer instinct up front. 

With their midfield failing to combine well, it was only in the latter part of the match that they showed urgency in their attack. 

The win moves Fransa at par with Mahindra United with 18 points from 12 matches, but they are placed fourth on account of inferior goal difference. 

Mohun Bagan, who suffered their fifth defeat from 12 matches, remained in seventh place with 15 points. (PTI)

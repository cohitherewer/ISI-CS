Frankfurt: Mexico and Brazil each scraped by with draws on the final day of group play in the Confederations Cup football tournament (reported briefly in Thursdays Late City edition). 

Mexicos goalless draw with Greece Wednesday clinched them the top place in group B, setting up a Sunday semi-final vs Latin American rivals Argentina.. 

Brazil hung on for 2-2 against Asian champions Japan, putting the five-time World Cup champions into Saturdays semi-final vs group A winners Germany. This will be a rematch of the 2002 World Cup final, won 2-0 by Brazil. 

Oguro Masashis 88th-minute goal allowed Japan to draw. 

Robinho gave Brazil A lead after ten minutes, and Shunsuke Nakamura equalised in the 27th. Five minutes later, Ronaldinho put Brazil up 2-1. 

Greece, the European champions, lost two of three games and failed to score. 

The Mexico-Greece game promised to be overshadowed when Fifa said it would have a statement after the match about Mexico defenders Salvador Carmona and Aaron Galindo. 

The two were dismissed from the team without explanation on Tuesday by Mexico coach Ricardo Lavolpe. He would only say they had broken team rules. 

Mexicos scoreless draw was lacklustre. Mexico looked little like the team that beat Brazil 1-0 Sunday. 

Greek FA president Vassilios Gagatsis said before the Mexico match he wanted Rehhagel to remain as coach for at least another four years. 

But Japan convinced the doubters with the draw against Brazil. Barely three minutes into the game, Akira Kaji beat keeper Marcos, only for the goal to be dismissed for offside. TV replays suggested the call was incorrect. 

From a Brazilian breakaway in the 10th minute, Ronaldinho carried the ball 50 m before sliding it to Robinho who fired left-footed under keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi. 

Nakamura produced a stunning equaliser in the 27th with a 25 m shot. But Brazil regained the lead five minutes later when Ronaldinho took a pass from Robinho and scored from 10 m. 

Japan made it 2-2 with two minutes to go when a free kick from Nakamura hit the post and, although Marcos partly blocked the rebound from Oguro, the ball went in. 

Japan almost snatched the winner moments later, but Marcos saved a shot by Oguro.

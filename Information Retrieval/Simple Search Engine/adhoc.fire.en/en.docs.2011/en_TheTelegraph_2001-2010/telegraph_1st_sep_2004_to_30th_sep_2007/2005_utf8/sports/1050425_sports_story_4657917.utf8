 Rana for bowling coach

Islamabad: Pakistan?s leading wicket-taker in the ODIs during the recently concluded series in India, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, has said there was a need for a bowling coach with the senior team. ?It would definitely help. At the moment Bob Woolmer has lot of work on his hands, so it would be ideal for him and us bowlers if there was another guy for guidance,? Rana said. 

Inzamam-ul Haq wanted the board to appoint Waqar Younis as bowling coach before the India tour but the proposal fell through. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Saturday, January 01, 2005 

 Vijay is the one to follow 

 STAR RACER

 Vijay Singh

Calcutta: The Scene 

 shifts from a gala bash in the RCTC?s paddocks, on the last 

 day of the year 2004, to the the racetrack on the New Year?s 

 Day. There will be action aplenty for the usual big crowd 

 in the eight event race-card. 

 Fields on the day do bear a scary look but casuals need not worry about it. Most runners from the leading stables are merely there seeking weight reductions. Further, their trainers dare not go against the system and spend January 9 Derby day on the sidelines.

 Trainers, Singh brothers ? Vijay and Bharath ? and Daniel David are going to be the leading players on the day. If Vijay?s Approved, Aleksei and Absolute Luxury look promising winners in their respective events, Bharath?s Evangeline is expected to take some beating in the main attraction of the afternoon ? the Pailan Group Calcutta Sprinters? Trophy. Daniel, too, has some good runners but his best chance appears to be Noble Investment in the 1,200m Pat Quinn Memorial Trophy. Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

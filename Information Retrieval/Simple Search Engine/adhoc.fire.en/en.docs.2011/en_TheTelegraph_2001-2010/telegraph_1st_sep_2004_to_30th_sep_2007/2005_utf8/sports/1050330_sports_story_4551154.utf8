The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Thaworn hits the million mark

 Thaworn is the 6th Asian to cross seven figures 

Kuala Lumpur: Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand, the master of the unorthodox swing, has become the sixth million-dollar man on the Asian Tour after registering a magnificent five-stroke victory in the Indonesia Open. 

With the victory on Sunday, Wiratchant pocketed a cheque of $166,660 putting himself in second place on the Order of Merit with $234,531, around $3,000 behind compatriot Thongchai Jaidee. It also pushed him to third place on the career money list with $1.06 million. 

Among the Indian?s, Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh are in the top-five Order of Merit earnings. Earning $164,282, Randhawa is in the third position, while Jeev is fifth with earnings amounting to $89,591. 

His success came in the same week that the Asian Tour was ratified as a full member of the International Federation of PGA Tours. 

He accumulated a four-day total of 25-under-par 255, which was the lowest aggregate (not in relation to par) on the Asian and European Tours. 

While the winning mark will not be considered official due to the preferred lie ruling which was in operation at the weekend, it did not take the gloss away from Wiratchant?s triumph. 

?My dream has become a reality. I have worked hard to win one of these co-sanctioned events and I?m glad to have achieved this,? he said. 

Growing up next to the Army Golf Course in Bangkok and a two-minute walk from Thai legend Boonchu Ruangkit?s home, Wiratchant got hooked on the game after he started to caddie to earn a few extra baht. 

His amateur career produced wins in Singapore and Thailand, as well as regional team competitions, before he joined the pro ranks in 1987. 

 Randhawa is third on the Order of Merit

He has often said that he did not see the need to 

remodel his swing. ?It has worked well for me during my amateur days and it works 

well now. I don?t think I need to change.? 

Victory in Jakarta came with a two-year exemption in Europe until the end of 2007 and Wiratchant said he would pick the events he thinks will suit his game. 

?I will have to prepare myself for Europe and play 

on courses that I think I?ll be comfortable on,? he said, adding that his immediate 

priority now is to help Asia regain the Visa Dynasty Cup at Mission Hills in China. 

Wiratchant featured in the victorious team two years ago in the Ryder Cup-style showdown but his celebration was somewhat muted as he lost all his three matches. 

?The last time we played, I did not contribute a single point. This time around, I?m feeling good about my game,? said Wiratchant, who lists Mission Hills as his favourite golf course in Asia.

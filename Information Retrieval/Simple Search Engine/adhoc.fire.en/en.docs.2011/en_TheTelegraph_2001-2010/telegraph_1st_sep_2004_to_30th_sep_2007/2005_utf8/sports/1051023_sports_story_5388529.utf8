 Fitness doubts over Sanath

 Jayasuriya 

Mumbai: Sri Lanka allrounder Sanath Jayasuriya retired with a painful right arm while batting in a warm-up game on Saturday raising concerns over his fitness two days before the start of the one-day series in Nagpur. 

The 36-year-old lefthander had collided with the team physiotherapist while playing waterpolo earlier this week, hurting the shoulder he had dislocated while fielding in August. 

Jayasuriya, playing in his first game since the accident, had made a breezy 34 when he was forced to retire in pain. 

Sanath felt a slight pain down his right shoulder. We didnt want to take any chances, said team manager Mike Tissera, adding: He should be okay. 

Jayasuriya was seen applying an ice pack to the shoulder in the dressing room. On Friday, he had looked uncomfortable playing leg-side shots while batting in the nets. 

Captain Maravan Atapattu is hopeful his teams most capped player can play at least as a batsman in the seven-match series even if he is unable to bowl his useful left-arm spinners. The Lankans started on a losing note when they went down by three wickets with one ball to spare against MCA Presidents XI. 

The Lankans, who rested key bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan and used 12 batsmen, mustered 267 for 9 in 50 overs after being put in by MCA captain Nilesh Kulkarni. 

MCA XI reached the target after needing nine off the last over bowled by pacer Dilhara Fernando. They reduced it to two off the last ball and took a single off what turned out to be a no-ball from Fernando and won with three wickets to spare, reaching 268 for 7. 

Later Upul Chandana made a useful 37, but what finally helped the visitors post a challenging total was the big-hitting prowess of Fervez Maharoof who slammed 4 fours and as many sixes in his 45-ball 64. 

The Mumbai outfit lost an early wicket, that of Praful Waghela. However, Vinayak Mane (75 off 110 balls, 7x4) and lefthander Nishit Shetty, who stroked 57 (70 balls, 8x4), put the home team on the right track with a stand of 112 runs in 134 balls.

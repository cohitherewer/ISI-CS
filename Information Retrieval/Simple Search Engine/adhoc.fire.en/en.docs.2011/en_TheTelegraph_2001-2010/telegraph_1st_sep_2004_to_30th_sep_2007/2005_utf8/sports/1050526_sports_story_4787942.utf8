 Moody appointed Lanka coach

Colombo: Sri Lankan cricket authorities on Wednesday appointed former Australian allrounder Tom Moody as its national team coach. 

Moody, who is presently director of cricket for English county side Worcestershire, arrived in Sri Lanka on Wednesday and immediately began contract discussions with cricket officials. 

The formal announcement of the appointment will be made at a news conference on Thursday, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) spokesman Ray Illangakoon said. 

Details of Moodys contract were not immediately available, but cricket sources suggested the term would likely be until the 2007 World Cup. 

Moody and former Australian captain Greg Chappell topped the list of candidates to coach Sri Lanka until Chappell was recruited by India last week. 

Playing in eight Test matches in an international career that started in 1989, Moody scored 456 runs at an average of 32.5 per innings. He played 72 limited-overs Internationals and scored 1,211 runs and took 52 wickets with his mediumpace bowling. 

For several weeks Sri Lankas crisis-ridden cricket worked to appoint a successor to former Australian opener John Dyson, whose contract as national coach expired after the New Zealand tour last month, in time to prepare for the home Test series against the West Indies in July.

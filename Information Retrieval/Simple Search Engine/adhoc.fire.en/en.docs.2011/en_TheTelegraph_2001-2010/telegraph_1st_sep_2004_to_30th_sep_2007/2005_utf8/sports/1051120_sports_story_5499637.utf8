 ICC, Fica reach agreement

Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) and Federation of International Cricketers Associations (Fica) on Saturday reached an agreement on resolving the outstanding dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the West Indies Players Association (Wipa), the ICC said. 

In October, the WICB and WIPA, who have been long running a contractual dispute, invited the ICC and Fica to examine the issues. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said that both parties had made concessions. 

The agreement reached between the ICC and Fica provides the WICB with certainty in exploiting its commercial rights and deals with the issues raised by the players, Speed said in a statement issued by the ICC here.

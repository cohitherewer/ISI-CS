The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I havent lobbied for Chappell: Sourav 

 - Selection committee member says senior pros not yet approached for their opinion on next coach 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

New Delhi: Not wanting to get caught in the crossfire over the next Team India coach, regular captain Sourav Ganguly has clarified he hasnt endorsed anybodys candidature. 

Neither has the Board sought my views till now (Monday afternoon), nor have I spoken about my so-called preference. Reports that I have lobbied for Greg Chappell and opposed the other three are incorrect, he told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Calcutta on the eve of his (and the familys) four-week trip to Europe, Sourav added: Ill be happy with the selection made by the Boards six-member committee... That panel has senior administrators and three former captains. Theyre bound to get it right... 

Chappell apart, the other contenders are Mohinder Amarnath, Desmond Haynes and Tom Moody. While Sourav insists he is neutral, its hardly a secret that he has an excellent equation with Chappell. 

Of course, an endorsement of the former Australian captains candidature doesnt necessarily follow. 

Meanwhile, one of the three administrators on the selection committee has informed that the views of the Team India senior pros hadnt been sought as yet. 

I cant say whether thats going to be done on May 19, when the four candidates are interviewed. But, till now, the Board hasnt approached anybody for his opinion, he pointed out, requesting anonymity. 

Unless theres a dramatic development, which hurts either Chappell or Moody, one of them will be John Wrights successor.

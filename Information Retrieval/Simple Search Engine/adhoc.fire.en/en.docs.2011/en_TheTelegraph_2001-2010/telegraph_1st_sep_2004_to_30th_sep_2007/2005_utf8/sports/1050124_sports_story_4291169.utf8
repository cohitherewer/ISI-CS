 ?Habib? may strike in Mysore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Sandhu

 Mysore: Al Habib, who was unlucky to go down to Comedy Of Errors in his last start, may have his turn tomorrow when this ward of G. Sandhu with Arun Rao in the saddle take on 11 rivals for the 1,200m Coimbatore Plate here on Monday.

 Al Habib?s main rivals look to be Baaja Bajaav and Ankole who placed behind in the same race. But on his sheer consistency, the Habib will take some beating.

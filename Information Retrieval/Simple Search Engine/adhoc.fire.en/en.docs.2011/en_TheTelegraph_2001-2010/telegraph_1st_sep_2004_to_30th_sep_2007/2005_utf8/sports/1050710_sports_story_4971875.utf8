 Harendra rues mispasses

Rotterdam: Coach Harendra Singh blamed mispasses on the left side for Indias dramatic 2-3 loss to Australia in the semi-final of the Rabobank Junior World Cup hockey tournament here. 

He said the mispasses on the Indian left side led to Australian turn overs and eventually into goals. We were in control of the match at half-time with a 2-0 lead. But after the crossover, we committed far too many mistakes, especially on the left side. Our left-back, left-half and left linkman gave away the balls and the Australians punished us, Harendra said. 

Harendra did not mince words in castigating the umpiring by Malaysias Amarjit Singh and Scotlands Andy Mair as he felt that decisions by these officials also contributed to Indias defeat to some extent. 

There was no consistency in their application of advantage rule inside the circle, especially in the second-half, he said. (PTI)

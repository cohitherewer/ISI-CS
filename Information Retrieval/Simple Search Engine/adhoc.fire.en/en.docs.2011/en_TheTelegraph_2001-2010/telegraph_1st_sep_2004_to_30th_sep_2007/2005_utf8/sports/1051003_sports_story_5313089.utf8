 Clijsters tops

 - Luxembourg open 

Luxembourg: US Open champion Kim Clijsters won her eighth title of the year after overpowering Germanys Anna-Lena Groenefeld 6-2, 6-4 in the final of the $585,000 Luxembourg Open on Sunday. 

The victory equalled Clijsters previous best title-haul for a year, in 2003 when she reached No. 1 in the world. 

It has been a great year for the Belgian who won her first Grand Slam at Flushing Meadow last month after four defeats in finals stretching back to 2001. 

She could even regain the world No. 1 spot next week in Filderstadt for the first time in nearly two years. 

This was the first tournament that I ever won (in 1999) and thats why its so nice to be back here for my first tournament after my US Open win, said the champion. 

Clijsters did not drop a set all tournament and was only really tested in her quarter-final victory against Italys Francesca Schiavone. 

It was the Belgians fifth win in Luxembourg and 29th title overall and maintained her perfect record in finals this year.

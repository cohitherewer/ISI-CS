 Weerakoon, Kapugedara new faces 

Colombo: Sri Lanka have dropped Sanath Jayasuriya from the 15-man squad for next months three-Test series in India. Sri Lankas selectors also changed the vice-captaincy, replacing Mahela Jayawardene with Chaminda Vaas. Maravan Atapattu remained in the hot seat. 

[That Atapattu would be retained as captain, despite his poor form and the teams lacklustre performance, was reported by The Telegraph on Thursday.] 

Batsman Russel Arnold, leg-spinner Upul Chandana, seamer Nuwan Zoysa and allrounder Dilhara Lokuhettige were the other players not picked for the Tests. 

Spinner Sajeeva Weerakoon and middle-order batsman Chamara Kapugedara are the new faces in the team. 

Sri Lanka return home after the final one-dayer in Vadodara on Saturday and travel back to India for a three-day practice match in Bangalore on November 26 before the first Test starting on December 2 in Chennai.

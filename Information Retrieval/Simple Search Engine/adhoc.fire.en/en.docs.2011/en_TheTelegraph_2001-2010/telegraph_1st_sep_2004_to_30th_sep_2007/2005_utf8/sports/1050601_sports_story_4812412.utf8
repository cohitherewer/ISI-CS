 Afridi apologises, row settled

 - Younis was contemplating stepping down from vice-captaincy, says report 

Karachi: Making a mockery of discipline, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) let off three players accused of indiscipline during the first Test against the West Indies in Barbados with reprimand, warning and promise to take stiffer action in future. 

According to a local newspaper, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan reacted promptly three days after the alleged incident took place in the dressing room and warned the players that such incidents and behaviour would be dealt swiftly in future. 

Skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, stand-in captain in Barbados Test Younis Khan and allrounder Shahid Afridi had a heated argument and had even exchanged blows after the first days play against the West Indies. 

The incident, which happened after Afridi was told to open the innings by Younis, was also confirmed by team manager Saleem Altaf who is also PCBs Director (Cricket Operations). 

Local daily quoted Abbas Zaidi, Director (Board Operations), as saying that the three players had a meeting with Shaharyar Khan over the incident. 

He (Shaharyar) was obviously not happy with what had happened but now things have been worked out with Afridi apologising to Younis for his behaviour and Inzamam making it clear he had no problems with Younis at all, Zaidi was quoted as saying. 

Inzamam, in his meeting with the chairman, had regretted the incident and put it down to some misunderstanding and assured that he had no problems with Younis. Similarly, Afridi has also apologised to Younis and the chairman then also spoke to all the other players to clear the air, Zaidi said. 

With the second Test round the corner this is not the time to decide about what action should be taken. And as it is the matter is now resolved and there is no ill feeling remaining in the team. 

The players have realised their mistakes and apparently its not going to be repeated again, he said. 

As Zaidi tried to portray the picture that all was well between Younis and Inzamam, the newspaper, said Inzamam criticised the attitude of Younis who is tipped as the future captain. 

The chairman had been told by Inzamam that while Afridi was at fault, Younis, recently, had also been behaving badly and was trying to impose his decisions against the advice of the coach and captain, the daily said. 

Inzamam told Shaharyar that he had told Younis that while he was the vice-captain and stand-in skipper but he (Inzamam) was the permanent captain and it was his team so he should be consulted while taking decisions, it quoted a source as saying. 

The daily, in a separate story, said Younis was contemplating stepping down from vice-captaincy because he neither wants to get embroiled in team politics nor does he want to make enemies because people are insecure with him being vice-captain. 

The PCB chairman was expected to handle the matter more seriously particularly after he took a few controversial decisions during his reign that were aimed at rooting out the trademark indiscipline in Pakistan cricket. 

Last year Rashid Latif was banned for six months which was later reduced after he conceded a domestic first-class match because of a dangerous pitch. 

Last month, the PCB handed a one-Test ban to Shoaib Malik after he deliberately threw away a Twenty-20 Cup match and scratched the two competing teams to allow Lahore, the third team in the group, to qualify for the second round. 

Interestingly, there were examples in Pakistan cricket when players have been sent packing from tours on grounds of indiscipline. 

Leg-spinner Abdul Qadir was sent back by manager Intikhab Alam from Australia in 1989-90 and batsman Yousuf Youhana was flown out of Kenya by manager Yawar Saeed in 2002.

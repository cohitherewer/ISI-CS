The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Question mark over Sachin?s availability 

 - Fund-raiser No.2 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Melbourne: It?s an understatement that Asia missed Sachin Tendulkar in Monday?s fund-raising ODI against the ICC XI. Worse, there?s even a question mark over his availability for the second match. 

Till the other day, February 15 was the preferred date for fund-raiser No. 2. But, now, it could be advanced by a couple of days. It?s not official, but the match is expected to be hosted by Calcutta. 

?Right now, it?s too early to say anything definitely... It?s only closer to the date that I can make a categoric comment... Let?s leave it at that,? Sachin told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon. 

With the troublesome left elbow preventing him from making the XI at the MCG, Asia got beaten to pulp by the Ricky Ponting-led ICC XI. 

Sachin has to be off cricket till the month-end and, then, must start a two-week rehab programme. It?s still unclear whether nets could be resumed simultaneously. 

Meanwhile, the six Indians in the Asia squad ? captain Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan and, of course, Sachin ? leave for Sydney en route to Mumbai early on Wednesday.

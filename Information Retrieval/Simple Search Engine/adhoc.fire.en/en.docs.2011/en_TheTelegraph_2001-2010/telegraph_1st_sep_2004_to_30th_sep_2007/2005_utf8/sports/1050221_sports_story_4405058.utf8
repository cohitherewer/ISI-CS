 2-hr nets for Sachin 

Hyderabad: Sachin Tendulkar arrived here on Sunday to take part in the Duleep Trophy match from Tuesday. 

The West Zone captain, coming back after taking a break to rest his elbow, had a two-hour nets session and batted for nearly 60 minutes in three spells. 

The star-studded match between West and South, led by Rahul Dravid, will be held at the Visakha Stadium. It will serve as a testing ground for the new venue for hosting internationals in the days to come. (PTI)

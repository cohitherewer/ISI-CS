 Blaze may come good 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Ganapathy

 Bangalore: The two horses who look the best in the field of nine vying for the 1,600m Kanteerava Cup, on Saturday, are Auberge and Spectacular Blaze. Going by their recent track trials, both look in good form but the latter, a S.Ganapathy-ward, is fancied to lift the trophy as Auberge will be traversing the slated trip for the first time. B. Prakash partners the Placerville-Rich Relation colt.

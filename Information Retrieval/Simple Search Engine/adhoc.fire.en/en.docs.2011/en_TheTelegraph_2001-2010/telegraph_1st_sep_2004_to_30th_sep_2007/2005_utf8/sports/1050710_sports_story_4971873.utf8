The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We will have the London blast victims 

 in mind

Overdrive 

Narain Karthikeyan

 The mood for Sundays race 

 in Silverstone will be very sombre, due to the multiple 

 bombings in London on Thursday. Even though we are a couple 

 of hundred kilometres away from the capital, the general 

 mood all around the UK is sad and depressing. 

 Our cars will run with the front 

 nose painted black as a sign of mourning for those killed 

 in the blasts. This is our teams home race as Jordan 

 is based right next to Silverstone. A minutes silence 

 will also be observed before the start of the race.

 My last outing ? in France ? was 

 a disappointing end to what was a really great weekend. 

 I had good pace throughout practice and qualifying. I also 

 had a great start and I managed to overtake the Red Bull 

 car in the opening lap. But, soon after, our car developed 

 a gearbox problem and we lost our third and fifth gear. 

 This obviously hampered my racing 

 and I had to be content with just nursing the car back home. 

 It is very important to finish the race as it not only gives 

 you more track experience but a better chance of qualifying 

 for the next race.

 With just a weeks break 

 between the two races, we did not get a chance for any track 

 testing. Fridays practice was helpful and I managed 

 to complete close to about forty laps. We had a better set-up 

 for the car in the morning session as compared to the afternoon, 

 in which I was a bit slower. We will be returning to our 

 morning set-up for qualifying. 

 Our new car is now really showing 

 promise. It is about a second faster than our present car 

 and even the reliability issues seems to have been taken 

 care of. I just cannot wait till the Hockeinheim circuit 

 in two weeks time when we get to use that car.

 The Silverstone circuit is great 

 and I have been here before on several occasions. There 

 are a lot of fast corners in this circuit. The Beckets corner 

 is a flat out seventh gear series of corners where we are 

 in speed of around 300 km/h and feeling immense amount of 

 positive Gs.

 We havent made any changes 

 in the car or the tyres for this race. It will basically 

 be the same package as we have had so far. 

 The Mclaren-Mercedes is the most 

 superior team at Silverstone and I expect them to have considerable 

 advantage in this race. On the other hand everyone predicts 

 the Renaults and the Ferraris to struggle here.

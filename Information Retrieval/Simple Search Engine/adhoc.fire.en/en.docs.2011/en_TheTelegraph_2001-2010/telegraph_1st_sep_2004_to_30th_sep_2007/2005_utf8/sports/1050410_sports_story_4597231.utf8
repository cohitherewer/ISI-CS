The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I need a change?The boys also need it: Wright 

 - Whatmore could emerge frontrunner for Team India job 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 After next Sunday, Wright is going to head for Christchurch 

Jamshedpur: First off the coach and last back 

on it. That has been John Wright?s routine for the past four-and-half years as 

the Team India coach. 

Next Sunday, though, will mark the last time he boards 

the bus. The limelight-shunning former New Zealand captain has, after all, decided 

not to seek an extension. 

?Look, I need a change... The boys also need it. And, 

from experience, I can tell you that change is almost always for the better,? 

Wright told The Telegraph. 

Unusually, he actually became a bit emotional during our brief interaction at the team hotel here. 

Insisting the ?only? reason for leaving was ?concern? over his two kids ? Wright is a divorcee ? he said: ?I?ve already been away from some of the most important years of my children... I?ve done a lot of travelling... Now, I need to be at home...? 

So, once this Pakistan-series gets over, Wright is going to head for Christchurch. 

Apparently, Wright hasn?t decided on his next career move. However, given his impressive CV, getting a job of his choice shouldn?t be a problem. He may even return to coaching a County. 

Saturday?s let-down at the Keenan has added to the defeats? column, but Wright?s record stays smart: 68 wins and 53 losses in ODIs; 21-15 in Tests. 

Greg Chappell, Dav Whatmore, Dean Jones and Tom Moody are being spoken of as the possible successor. Well, Whatmore ? who has worked with Sri Lanka and is currently with Bangladesh ? could emerge the frontrunner. 

The next coach?s appointment will be till the 2007 

World Cup.

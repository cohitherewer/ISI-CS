 NZ set to maintain on-field focus

Harare: New Zealand are determined not to be distracted by the controversy surrounding their tour to Zimbabwe, captain Stephen Fleming said on Saturday. 

The opening Test of a two-match series starts in Harare on Sunday while debate still rages in New Zealand over whether the tourists should be in the troubled southern African country. 

Last month, the New Zealand government passed a resolution calling on the ICC and New Zealand Cricket to cancel the trip due to concerns over human rights abuses under President Robert Mugabe. I guess the party line is that were here to play cricket, Fleming said. 

The guys have taken in a lot of info and were very aware of the situation, but the biggest mistake we could make would be to focus too much on whats happening outside the cricket. 

Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu said the controversy, which has sparked a campaign in New Zealand in favour of legislation banning tours to countries with poor human rights records, had not affected his team. It hasnt had any impact on the side at all, said Taibu. We cant control politics, so why should we go sticking our nose in there?

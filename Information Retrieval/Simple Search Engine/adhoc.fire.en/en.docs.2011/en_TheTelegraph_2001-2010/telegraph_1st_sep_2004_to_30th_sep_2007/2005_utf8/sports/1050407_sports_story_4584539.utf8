 Jeev in line to make the cut

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Kuala Lumpur: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a one-under 71 to be within striking range of making the British Open cut in an otherwise frustrating first round for the Indian contingent at the Asian qualifying at the Saujana Golf and Country Club on Wednesday. 

Former Asian No. 1 Jyoti Randhawa, who finished second in February?s Carlsberg Malaysian Open, stumbled to a 74 after three-putting on four greens. Amandeep Johl signed for a 73 ? as did Rahil Gangjee ? but was kicking himself as he was three-under-par through 12 holes during the two-day qualifiers. 

?I just gave away shots coming in. The way I was hitting the ball, I could have posted a low round. Trying to qualify for the British Open seems like a tough thing for me,? said Johl, who has been trying to make the cut every year since 1997. 

Jeev Milkha had lost in a play-off for a spot last year. 

Meanwhile, Asian stalwarts Mardan Mamat of Singapore, Canadian Rick Gibson and Danny Chia of Malaysia were are well positioned to claim the three spots available for the British Open, with Chia poised to become the first from his country to qualify for the world?s oldest major. 

Mamat and Manila-based Gibson jumped on route 66 with matching first rounds to set the early pace with local favourite Chia in close pursuit after an impressive 67. 

With his yoga master from India on site, Mamat said a pep talk before his round helped him start well.

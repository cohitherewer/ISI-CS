 Sachin slips to No. 13

London: Sachin Tendulkar has slipped from the top-10 to an unfamiliar 13th place in the ICC?s ODI batting rankings. Stand-in captain Rahul Dravid, though, has moved up seven places to No. 6. 

In team rankings, India remained at the eighth spot ? ahead of Zimbabwe, Kenya and Bangladesh ? but lost one point after the 2-4 series loss to Pakistan. Their current rating of 97 is their lowest since the ICC table was introduced in 2002. 

Australia continued to lead the table followed by Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Pakistan, who reached their highest rating (110) since December 2003. 

Naved-ul Hasan, who took 15 wickets to be adjudged Man of the Series, has jumped 30 places to 12th. (PTI)

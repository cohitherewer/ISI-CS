 London: France and Arsenal striker Thierry Henry launched a ?stand up, speak up? campaign across Europe on Thursday in a bid to stamp out racism in soccer. Fans can buy wristbands of interlocked black and white straps to support the campaign which is backed by television adertisements featuring World Player of the Year Ronaldinho of Barcelona, Inter Milan?s Adriano and Chelsea?s Claude Makelele.

 Henry, sitting alongside England defender Rio Ferdinand, said the campaign had been sparked by Spanish coach Luis Aragones referring to Henry as ?that black shit? in an attempt to motivate Jose Antonio Reyes who plays with Henry at Arsenal.

 ?Everyone was asking me ?what are you going to do?? and I said to myself I would try to bring everyone behind me to fight racism,? he told a news conference.?It?s something we need to get rid of. The game is suffering, we all suffer because we are all human beings.? 

 Madrid: Real Madrid striker Ronaldo will miss this weekend?s match against Numancia as he is returning home to Brazil due to a family illness, the Primera Liga club said on Friday. The 28-year-old was given permission to fly to Brazil on Friday morning and is not expected to return to Madrid until next week.

 Real are due to play basement side Numancia on Sunday, though the game is under threat because of a frozen pitch.

 London: Manchester City?s Nicolas Anelka is poised to sign for Turkey?s Fenerbahce after the clubs agreed a fee for the French striker on Thursday.

 ?Manchester City and Fenerbahce have agreed a fee for the transfer of Nicolas Anelka,? City said on their website. ?The club will make no further comment until the transfer is complete.?

 Anelka, who joined City in July 2002 from Paris St Germain for ? 10 million, has been sidelined since January 1 with a back and groin problem.

 The temperamental 25-year-old is discussing personal terms with Fenerbahce, who lead the Turkish first division by four points. 

 Madrid: Uruguayan forward Richard Nunez signed a one and a half-year deal with Atletico Madrid after successfully passing a medical. The 28-year-old, who has been capped for his country, was released from his contract with Swiss side Grasshoppers.

 Atletico coach Cesar Ferrando said he was delighted with his new recruit.

 ?He?s got pace, a good shot and is very good at taking free kicks,? he told a news conference. ?All the reports I have about him are very good. He can play on the left and just behind the front man and scores quite a lot of goals.?

 Hartford: Joe-Max Moore, who won 100 caps for the United States, announced his retirement from soccer on Thursday after undergoing a knee operation last week.

 The 33-year-old striker had reconstructive surgery on his right knee last Friday after being injured in pre-season training with the New England Revolution Major League Soccer team.

 ?It?s a pretty sad time for me right now,? Moore said in a phone interview from his home in Miami. ?The last two or three years have been pretty miserable (because of injuries). The doctors told me the only way to fix the knee was to do a complete reconstruction. At that point, considering my age and how long it was going to take to recover, I decided it was pretty smart for me to just retire.?

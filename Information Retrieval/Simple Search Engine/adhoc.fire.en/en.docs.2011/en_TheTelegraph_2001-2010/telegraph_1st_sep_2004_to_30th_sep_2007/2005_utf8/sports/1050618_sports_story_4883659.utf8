 Win eludes Sasikiran again

Paks: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikirans hunt for the elusive victory continued as he again split point in the fifth round of the Marx Gyorgy Memorial Grandmasters tournament here. This time, he was held by former world junior champion Peter Acs of Hungary. 

After his fourth draw in five games, Sasikiran has a meagre two points in his kitty. After another all-draw day in the double round-robin meet featuring six players, the Indian stayed in fourth spot. 

With five rounds remaining, 74-year-old Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland hung on to his slender half-point lead after an eventful draw with Hungarian GM Zoltan Almasi. While Korchnoi has 4 points, Almasi is in second spot with 3.5. 

Top seed Emil Sutovsky, who drew with Hungarian Ferenc Berkes, is next in line on 2.5 followed by Sasikiran. Sharing the last two spots are Berkes and Acs, both with 1.5. 

The last round before the only rest day in the event did not lift too many spirits and Sasikiran was no exception. The Indian normally is a feared opponent, especially with white, but the draw with Acs was already the third one for him with that colour. 

Playing against Kings Indian, Sasikiran employed the classical variation and obtained a better position with thematic manoeuvres. 

However, Acs also showcased his in-depth knowledge of the structure and timely exchanges helped in steering the game to level position. The pieces got exchanged at regular intervals in the middlegame and a queen and minor piece endgame surfaced after the dust subsided. The players signed peace on move 42. 

Playing black against Almasi, Korchnoi obtained a comfortable position in the Italian game almost nonchalantly and slowly worked on his counter play in the centre while Almasi tried to break his kingside.

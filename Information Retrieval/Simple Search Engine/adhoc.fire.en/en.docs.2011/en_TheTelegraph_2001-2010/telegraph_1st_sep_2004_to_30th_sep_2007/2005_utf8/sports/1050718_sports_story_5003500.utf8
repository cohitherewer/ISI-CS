 Pak players wont sport liquor logos

Islamabad: Pakistan cricket authorities have told the International Cricket Council (ICC) that their players will not wear or display logos of a whisky brand sponsor in the Super Series matches in October. 

Alcohol consumption is banned for Muslims in the Islamic state of Pakistan. 

Five Pakistani players (Inzamam-ul Haq, Shoaib Akhtar, Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi and Abdul Razzaq) have been chosen for the provisional ICC World XI Test and one-day squads that will play against world champions Australia. 

We have informed the ICC that our players will in no manner promote the logos or other promotional material if they are picked in the final World XI squads, a PCB official said on Sunday on condition of anonymity. 

Meanwhile, the PCB will consult Australian specialists regarding the bowling action of fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed, adds another report from Karachi. PCB director of cricket operations, Saleem Altaf, on Sunday said he had written to Prof. Bruce Elliott and Daryl Foster in Perth and sought their views and opinion on the issue by Monday. 

If required, Shabbir will be immediately flown to Perth, so that he can again undergo biomechanical tests, Altaf added.

Calcutta: Despite a near-fruitless day on the field at the Eden, Team India captain Sourav Ganguly wasn?t disappointed with his bowlers? efforts on Day II of the second Test versus Pakistan. 

?I?m not at all disappointed? the first session of Friday?s play will be crucial,? he told The Telegraph at the team hotel on Thurs- day evening after coming out of a meeting with his players. 

On Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh?s inability to break through, the skipper said: ?The ball turned slowly because it was only the second day? There will be more turn on the last two days,? he said at the team hotel. 

Sourav was full of praise for the two Pakistani batsmen ? Younis Khan and Yousuf Youhana ? who were involved in an unbeaten 203-run stand for the third wicket. 

?Both Younis and Youhana (unbeaten on 108 and 101, respectively) batted brilliantly right from the first balls they faced,? Sourav said.

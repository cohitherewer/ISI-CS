Calcutta: Mohun Bagan maintained their all-win record in the CFL Premier Division, Eastern Railway being the latest casualty at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. But the moment of getting closer to regaining the crown was overshadowed in the way Gley Yao Rodrigue played the role of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the match. 

The Togolese scored both goals in Mohun Bagans 2-1 victory and then, showed the other side of his split personality ? foolishly receiving the marching orders, the first by any of his team in the competition. 

He invited the first booking from the referee Tapan Haldar by refusing to leave the field for nursing an injury. Then in the second half, he unnecessarily elbowed Eastern Railways Subhankar Maity in an aerial tussle, who suffered a cut above his left eye. The referee again was spot-on in deciding to promptly send Rodrigue back to the dressing room. 

In between such crazy acts surfaced the brilliance that has made the Togolese so endeared to his club and the fans. His both goals are copybook finishes, executed from the same position and involving the same teammate, Tomba Singh, for a floater to negotiate with. He, thus, emerged the leading scorer in the Premier Division, one ahead of Syed Rahim Nabis six. 

Mohun Bagan have so far maintained a clean slate, having bagged 30 points from 10 matches. Eastern Railway are on 12 from 11 outings. 

The first goal came in the 22nd minute, Tombas free-kick from the right found Rodrigue in the perfect place (just inside the top-box) to head home. Eastern Railway goalkeeper Tapan Karmakar inexplicably came out of his line to challenge him, further helping Rodrigues cause. 

Eight minutes gone and Eastern Railway were on level terms. Taking full advantage of a complacent defence, Farid Ali Mollah was allowed to enter unchallenged into the left corner of the box and took a powerful left-footer. Subrata Pal managed to palm it away stretching to his left. Binoy Saha, lurking nearby, reacted quicker than Mohun Bagan central defender Dulal Biswas to push the ball in. 

It was again left to the flash of Rodrigue to help Mohun Bagan paper over the crisis. Two minutes into the first-half injury times, Tomba again found space and time to send in a floater from the right and Rodrigue easily beat Dipendu Panja in the air to come up with another neatly-directed header. 

Apart from Rodrigues pyrotechnics ? including his double booking ? Mohun Bagan appeared to be living in an inertia, reluctant to spread their usual game down both flanks. Their defence looked porous, attack lacked ideas and midfield monotonous. 

Most of their moves aimed at exploring the left wing, but at times when left-back Subhashish Roy Chowdhury ventured to go up, there was none to play the ball with him. Noel Wilson, the channel of distributing the balls in the Mohun Bagan midfield, was partly to be blamed for this. 

Eastern Railway did put up a pressure, but there was not enough teeth in their attacks. 

However more worryingly, there was also a tendency, especially from the Mohun Bagan backline, to take the situation for granted, when the current leaders had to survive the last 15 minutes with 10 men. 

This may be an aberration, but Mohun Bagan still need to win two more matches before reclaiming the crown and theres still the proverbial gap between the cup and the lip.

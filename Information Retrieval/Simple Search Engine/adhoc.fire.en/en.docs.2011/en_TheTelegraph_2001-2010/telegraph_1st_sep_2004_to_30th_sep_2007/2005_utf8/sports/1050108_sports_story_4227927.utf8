 Horner new Red Bull boss

London: Red Bull Racing named Christian Horner as the new boss of their Formula One team on Friday after dismissing Tony Purnell and David Pitchforth. 

The Austrian-owned team said in a statement that 31-year-old Horner, head of the championship-winning Arden F3000 junior team, had been appointed sporting director with immediate effect. 

?Horner will jointly manage Red Bull Racing together with a new technical director, whose appointment will be announced within the next week,? the team said. 

No reasons were given for the changes, which followed earlier assurances by Red Bull that the existing Jaguar team management would be retained.

Bangalore: Greg Chappell met all 36 Team India 

probables for the first time, Wednesday morning, and straightaway conveyed his 

commitment to excellence agenda. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, among other 

things, the Team India coach emphasised proper focussing and the need 

to be innovative. 

In other words, taking the initiative and not waiting to be driven by circumstances. 

Later, in the evening (after the probables session with a Master Thinker, Chappell went over to regular captain Sourav Gangulys hotel room for a 20-minute one-on-one. 

Over the years, both have developed a rapport. 

Sourav declined to go into details, pleading much of the talk was of a personal nature, but did say Chappell would closely watch him during Thursday afternoons nets. 

I understand Greg has arranged video footage of some of my innings on the 2003-04 tour of Australia and will make a comparison, he informed. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, did well on that trip. 

Incidentally, hes scheduled to leave for Calcutta (en route to London) soon after nets ? actually, after an exam conducted by Chappell. 

Sourav, who is turning out for Glamorgan, had to make 

this rushed journey as the coach wanted him around for the first two days of the 

final camp.

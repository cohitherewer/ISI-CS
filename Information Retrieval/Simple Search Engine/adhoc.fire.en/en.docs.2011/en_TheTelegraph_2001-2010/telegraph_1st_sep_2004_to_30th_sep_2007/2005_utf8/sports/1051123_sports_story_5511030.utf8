Paris: Premiership giants Chelsea and Liverpool will be eyeing a spot in the Champions League knockout round on Wednesday as Inter Milan, PSV Eindhoven, Glasgow Rangers and Schalke 04 also target qualification. 

The Merseysiders lead group G with ten points after four games and a draw would be enough to seal the title-holders place with a game to spare against third-placed Real Betis at Anfield. 

Betis, however, defeated Chelsea last month and if they can repeat that feat, Liverpool would find themselves having to avoid defeat at Chelsea next month to be sure of progressing. 

Liverpool are hoping Luis Garcia, who scored in the 2-0 win over Betis in Seville in September, and fellow Spaniard Xabi Alonso will both be fit. 

Garcia suffered a hip injury in Saturdays premiership win over Portsmouth and Alonso was also substituted, because of a knee problem. 

Chelsea lie second, three points behind Liverpool, and want to get back to winning ways at Anderlecht, who have lost their last eleven games in the competition. 

Chelsea have not won away from home in Europe in over a year and their last defeat to Real Betis sparked suggestions that Jose Mourinhos side were heading for a slump. 

Victory for Chelsea will almost certainly assure them of a place in the knockout phase although Liverpool remain favourites to finish top of the group. A win over Artmedia Bratislava would see group H leaders Inter Milan advance at the San Siro. The Italians have nine points from their four matches played, four more than the Slovakian champions and Glasgow Rangers. 

Rangers could, however, become the first Scottish club to qualify from the group stages. If the Scottish champions beat 2004 winners FC Porto, while Inter Milan defeat Artmedia Bratislava, they will qualify alongside the Italians.Porto, whose only points came from a 2-0 home win over group leaders Inter Milan, were heartened by a morale-boosting 5-1 league win over Academica on Saturday. 

Coach Co Adriaanse said his side would be helped by the absence of Rangers striker Dado Prso, who is out with a hamstring injury. 

Dutch giants PSV top group E on seven points and know victory over Schalke in Gelsenkirchen will see them qualify, and even a draw could be enough if AC Milan defeat Fenerbahce of Turkey in the other group game. 

PSV, last years semi-finalist, have yet to score away from home in Europe this season but a 4-4 draw with RKC Waalwijk at the weekend showed their prowess in front of goal. 

The Dutch have won just one of their last 16 European ties in Germany but manager Guus Hiddink has fond memories having led Eindhoven to 1988 European Cup glory with a 6-5 penalty shootout win over Benfica in Stuttgart. 

Schalke are level with Milan on five points in one of the tightest groups, with Fenerbahce one point behind. 

The German league and Cup runners-up have never reached the knockout phase of this competition, although this is only their second appearance, but victory over Eindhoven would give them a great chance of making history. 

Group F sees a battle between already-qualified Real Madrid and Lyon at the Santiago Bernabeu with the Spaniards gunning to end their opponents unbeaten record and avenge their 0-3 defeat in France earlier in the campaign.

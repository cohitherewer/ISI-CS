 Lee readies for bouncer battle

 - First Ashes Test- Resurgent England face awesome Australians

 Brett Lee warms up at Lords on Tuesday 

Determined not to be beaten for pace in Thursdays first Test, the Australians will this week unveil a new look to their seam attack. 

In an effort to match Englands superior fast-bowling arsenal, Brett Lee, the 100mph speedster, has been assigned the task of matching Steve Harmison bouncer for bouncer. And as he warned his opponents Monday, Lee is ready to give as good as he gets. 

Ive always been a person who has bowled a few short balls and copped a few, he said. 

Its all part of cricket. Ever since the Twenty20 game, England have employed the tactic of bouncing our tail, trying to get us on the back foot and get us out cheaply. But we have some plans against their tail too. 

It has been 18 months since Lee last played Test cricket, but on Friday Leicestershire felt the fury of a fast bowler scorned. Bowling a fusillade of bouncers, Lee dismissed the top three batsmen, and forced the No. 4, John Sadler, to retire hurt with a painful blow on the collarbone. 

I tried to get through some short-pitched bowling at Leicester, which was really just a way of warming up, Lee said. 

Playing one-day matches over the last couple of months, Ive only been allowed one bouncer an over, so I havent had a chance to bowl a lot of short-pitched balls. This was a chance to bowl some different deliveries and work on the ways you bowl in Test match cricket. 

Though Australia were embarrassed by Leicestershires second-innings resistance, their main obstacle ? the Western Australia batsman Chris Rogers ? later said that Lees bowling was quite scary at times. Brett Lee is special, Rogers, who scored 209, added. 

He bowled seriously quick in his first spell, probably as quick as anything I have faced. And this on a pitch with all the pace and bounce of a blancmange. 

Thursdays match could throw up some ferocious cricket as Englands four-pronged pace attack aim to outgun the Australian line-up, which is likely to consist of Lee, Glenn McGrath and the out-of-form Jason Gillespie. 

This souped-up trio represents a change of tack from the tourists, who have previously preferred Michael Kasprowiczs economical outswingers to Lees more robust style, which usually produces bursts of runs and wickets in equal measure. 

Under Ricky Pontings captaincy, Australia have placed great store by strangling teams with miserly bowling and tight ground fielding. But with Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones all capable of pushing the speed gun over 90 mph, omitting Lee is no longer an option. The pace advantage would have too much symbolic value. 

The concern for the Aussies lies with their support seamers. Gillespie and Kasprowicz came here as sure-fire Test bowlers. Along with Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, they had played a combined total of 331 Tests and taken 1,432 wickets, earning the soubriquet the four horsemen from one writer. 

Yet in the early stages of this tour, Gillespie and Kasprowicz were in danger of becoming the two donkeys, conceding around 10 runs an over in the Twenty20 international and around seven in Australias defeat in Bristol. 

Things have looked up a little since then, with both men producing improved performances in Australias NatWest Challenge revival. 

But they went wicketless again Monday, prompting coach John Buchanan to concede: I would have liked them both to bowl better lengths and lines. 

Gillespie will probably win selection on the basis of his Test record, which stands comparison with any bowler in the England side. However, he admitted Monday: I havent had the greatest one-day series or the greatest tour so far. You always feel under pressure when theres a Test match coming up and you want to be part of it. But whoever gets the berth is going to do a job, and the others will be supportive because thats the beauty of this Australian team. 

Despite Australias creaky build-up, Gillespies regular opening partner McGrath is still tipping his team to win 5-0. Typically, he is more optimistic about the group known within the team as the FBC (or Fast Bowling Cartel). 

Ive had a few chats with Dizzy [Gillespie] and he says the ball is coming out well and the body feels good. It just comes down to the two-month break we had before coming over here. I know from experience that it sometimes takes a while to get everything up to speed. Now were ready for the Tests, and everything is coming together.

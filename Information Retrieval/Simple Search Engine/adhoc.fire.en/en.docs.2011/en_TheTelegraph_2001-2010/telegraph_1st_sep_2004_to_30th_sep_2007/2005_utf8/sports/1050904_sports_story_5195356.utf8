Santoro, 32 and ranked No. 76, delighted the evening session Arthur Ashe Court crowd and drew smiles from the Swiss top seed by playing shots from between his legs, behind his back and even with eyes averted.

Venus, on the other hand, yelled at the Arthur Ashe Court crowd after beating Hantuchova: Are you guys ready for the Williams sisters? Well see you on Sunday. 

Sharapova, who had dropped only three games in the first two rounds, beat German Julia Schruff 6-2, 6-4 (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition) to reach the fourth round.

Unseeded Thai Paradorn Srichaphan, ranked 51, upset Davydenko 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. He will next play Italian Davide Sanguinetti, who ousted 31st-seed Moya 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. 

British teenager Andy Murray ran out of steam in his second successive five-setter, beaten 0-6 in the fifth by Frances Arnaud Clement.

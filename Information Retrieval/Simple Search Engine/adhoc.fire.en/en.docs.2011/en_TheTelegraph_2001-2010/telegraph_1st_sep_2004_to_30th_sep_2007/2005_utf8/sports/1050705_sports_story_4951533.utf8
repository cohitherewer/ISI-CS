 England add Prior to squad

London: Sussex wicketkeeper-batsman Matt Prior has been added to Englands squad for the three-match one-day series against world champions Australia starting at Headingley, Leeds on Thursday. 

The 23-year-old Prior, who made his one-day International debut against Zimbabwe last year, comes in for Worcestershire seam bowler Kabir Ali and could be used as a substitute in the series under new playing regulations. 

England and Australia have agreed to play under revamped International Cricket Council rules. Fielding restrictions have been extended from 15 overs to 20 overs, in blocks of three, and teams can use a substitute at any stage of a match. 

We were delighted with the teams strong performances during the NatWest Series and have made only one change to the squad for the NatWest Challenge, England chairman of selectors David Graveney said on Monday. 

England, inspired by the batting of Geraint Jones and Paul Collingwood, came back from the brink of defeat to tie their triangular series one-day final against Australia on Saturday. 

Matt Prior has been chosen as an impact player who is in good form and his inclusion will give (coach) Duncan (Fletcher) and (captain) Michael (Vaughan) more options for their choice as substitute, added Graveney. Matt has been chosen purely as a specialist batsman, although he will obviously provide cover for Geraint Jones in the event of injury. 

Prior said: I am absolutely delighted to get another opportunity with England. I had a little taste of international cricket and I feel I know what to expect, although obviously its going to be very different against a team like Australia. 

THE SQUAD: Michael Vaughan (captain), Andrew Strauss, Marcus Trescothick, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Ashley Giles, Darren Gough, Stephen Harmison, Geraint Jones, Simon Jones, Jon Lewis, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Vikram Solanki, Chris Tremlett.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Vasco hold edge vs Tolly

Margao: Having beaten them in the away match, Vasco holds psychological advantage over Tollygunge Agragami when they meet Wednesday at Nehru Stadium in the 13th round of the National Football League. 

Vasco, languishing at the bottom with nine points from 12 matches have been plagued by inept finishing and are struggling to escape relegation. 

But their win against Mohun Bagan, Tollygunge and draw against Mahindra in their last three matches have given them some hope of surviving in the NFL. 

Although Vasco holds the psychological advantage after beating Tollygunge in Calcutta it will remain to be seen if they are able to carry the advantage as they are yet to win a match at home. 

On the other hand, Tollygunge with 14 points from 12 matches, need to shed their defensive approach and play more positive game if they are to achieve full points. 

Tollygunge?s fortune will largely depend on Suley Musah, who has been holding the fort together in the defence and lending helping hand during attacks.

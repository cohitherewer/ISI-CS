Kochi: India bounced back from the numbing Bangalore Test loss to thrash Pakistan by 87 runs in the first one-day International Saturday, recording their first ODI win against their arch-rivals at home since their famous World Cup victory in 1996. 

The Indians put up a commanding allround performance with Virender Sehwag and Rahul blasting centuries to propel them to a challenging 281 for eight before Sachin Tendulkar picked up his second five-wicket haul to skittle out the visitors for 194 with nearly five overs to spare. 

It was not a convincing batting display with captain Sourav Ganguly?s first ball dismissal being a black spot in the bright glow and the failure of the middle order resulting in a scoreline significantly less than the hosts would have settled for on a benign pitch. 

But Sachin?s star turn with the ball, five for 50, combined with the Pakistani batsmen?s reluctance to apply themselves gave the hosts a facile victory at the packed Jawarharlal Nehru Stadium. 

Incidentally, Sachin had grabbed his first five-for also at the same venue, a match winning five for 32 against the Australians in 1998. 

The victory also helped India narrow their win-loss record against Pakistan at home to 5-11 and buck the sequence of four consecutive ODI defeats. 

Earlier, India seemed to run out of gas as they suffered a middle-order collapse immediately after the record third-wicket stand between Sehwag and Dravid. 

Sehwag cracked a typically aggressive 108 from 95 balls while vice-captain Dravid made a steady 104 but the hosts lost their way after the former?s departure towards the closing stages. 

?The conditions were tough and scoring in such conditions always gives immense satisfaction,? said Sehwag. 

?Rahul and I were first aiming to get to 30 overs and then 35?? 

The duo put on 201 runs from 199 balls, which bettered the previous best between the two teams ? 161 runs put up by Dravid and Mohammed Azharuddin in Toronto in 1996.The fall of quick wickets on either side of the partnership undermined captain Sourav Ganguly?s decision to bat first. Off-spinner Arshad Khan finished with four for 33 to slice through the tail while Rana Naved-ul Hasan (two for 38) did the early damage, removing Sachin (4) and Sourav (0) off successive balls. 

India were 205 for two at one stage before they lost six wickets for 64 runs . 

The extreme heat and humidity, a sudden shift from the cooler climes of Bangalore, had debilitating effect on players from both the teams. 

Shahid Afridi and Rana, suffered cramps while India?s scoring rate was affected as Dravid seemed drained from his effort. The vice-captain did not take the field during the Pakistan innings. 

The ?wall? might have expected the young guns to take charge as he approached his century, but he was let down by Yuvraj Singh (16), Mohammed Kaif (7) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (3), who all perished to innocuous shots. 

Dravid found the task of providing the late thrust too much to handle, and was run out to a direct hit. 

India thus lacked that big kick in the last lap and simply crawled towards the final post. 

The Indians, however, were cruising at jet speed despite the twin dismissals of Sachin and Sourav in the second over. 

Sachin was caught at mid on as he top edged Rana while attempting a big heave off the bowler. The right-arm pacer then got a bonus when Sourav shuffled across and lost his leg stump the very next delivery. 

Sehwag and Dravid did more than a recovery job as they gradually increased the tempo before launching into the rival bowling. (AGENCIES)

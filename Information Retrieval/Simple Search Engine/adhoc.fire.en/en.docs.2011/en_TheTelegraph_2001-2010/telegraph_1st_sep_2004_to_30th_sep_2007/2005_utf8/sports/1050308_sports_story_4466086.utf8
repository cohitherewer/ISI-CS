Madrid: Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia clinched the 13th pole vault world record of her career, and promised to go for more this year. 

The Olympic champion cleared 4.90m with ease on at the European indoors championships in Madrid?s Sports Palace. It was a centimetre more than the record she set in Lievin, France, last month. 

?I?m so happy that I broke the record and I hope it won?t be the last this year,? Isinbayeva said. ?I dedicate this to the public of Madrid.? 

She cleared the 4.70, 4.80 and 4.90 jumps in her first attempts, and it looked like she could have tried to break the 5-metre barrier. 

?I?ll try to do it ? the 5m jump ? this summer, this is my dream,? she said. She has claimed to have cleared the 5-metre mark in training. 

The Russian has set four indoor world records this season. She also set the outdoor record of 4.91 metres at the Olympics and then raised it to 4.92 metres in September. 

Isinbayeva said her goal was to surpass Ukrainian pole vault great Serge Bubka, who holds the men?s world records for outdoor (6.14) and indoor (6.15). 

?I would like to be like Bubka,? she said. ?I would like to have 36 championships (Bubka has 35). That is my motivation, and also I would like to get a big win during the summer season, so far my big wins have been in winter.? 

Isinbayeva has drawn comparisons to Bubka with her tendency to break the world record by the smallest of margins.?I am always fighting with myself, I am my principal competitor,? she said. 

She said she hoped to take part in six meets this summer, including the world championships in Helsinki in August. 

?I think it?ll be six starts this summer season, no more,? said the Volgograd-born athlete who set her first record in Gateshead, England, in July 2003 with a 4.82 outdoor jump.

 Kariappa succumbs to injury

OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Kavan Kariappa died on Tuesday evening after a ten-day battle for survival. He was among the top ten jockeys in the country. 

The end of the 24-year-old came at 5.30 in the evening after his mother consented to the panel of doctors to take the jockey off the ventilator. He had fallen off his horse Millionaire at the Hyderabad races on January 23. 

Kariappa?s death is another instance of the high-risk sport claiming one more life. 

Karl Umrigar (18), who died 25 years ago, was the darling of the ?Mahalaxmi? race crowd. Umrigar was unseated from Vasudha in a four-horse field and death followed within a few hours. 

More recently, in last September, fate delivered a cruel blow to young Yogender Singh when he fell of Dilnawaz at the Pune races. He breathed his last within a couple of hours. 

In the last four years, jockeys Anant Kumar and S.S. Bhatti also died on the race track before they could blossom in their career. 

?Kariappa was life and soul of any party?, said jockey Rutherford Alford from Hyderabad. ?He had bought a guitar from Calcutta on January 22 after booting home two winners. He also promised a recital at the wedding reception of jockey Ravinder Singh in the next couple of days. But that was not to be?, added Rutherford. 

Ravinder himself survived a nasty fall last year. He was in coma for 21 days.

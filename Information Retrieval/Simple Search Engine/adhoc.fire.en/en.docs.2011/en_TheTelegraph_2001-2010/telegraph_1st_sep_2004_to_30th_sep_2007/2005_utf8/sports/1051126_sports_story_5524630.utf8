 England accept Test venues only

Lahore: After days of sulking, England have agreed to play at the venues suggested by the BCCI for the three Test matches early next year. 

However, England would not accept the centres recommended for the two practice games ahead of the series, a top ECB offical said. 

We have decided to play the Tests on centres recommended by BCCI, but the venues for the two practice matches are not acceptable to us and the team. We would press the BCCI to change them, the official said on the condition of anonymity. 

The BCCI has slotted the two practice matches in Jamshedpur (February 25-27) and in Agartala (March 2-4), while the Tests have been scheduled in Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Mumbai. 

The venues have been discussed in detail with the players association and with the players and we have unanimously decided that Jamshedpur and Agartala are not acceptable, he said. 

We want the BCCI to move the warm-up games from those centres and slot them in cities where there are better hotels, the official said in Faisalabad. (PTI)

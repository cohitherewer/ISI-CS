 Free tickets for Tests vs England

Karachi: Concerned over low turnouts at Tests, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to distribute upto one-third of tickets free during the upcoming three-match series against England. 

Fans can collect the tickets on a first-come-first-served basis a day before the start of the three Tests ? in Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore. 

In recent years, the crowds have not been flocking to Tests, said PCB communications manager Ateeq Abdul. So we thought if dignitaries could be given free passes, why cant we do the same for supporters? We have decided to distribute a quarter to one-third of tickets for each Test free of cost at designated enclosures in each of the three cities, he informed. 

He added the fans should not expect the same generosity during the five-match ODI series versus England. 

Meanwhile, an embarrassed PCB has ordered an inquiry into the recent outburst by former Test player Mohammad Ilyas against coach Bob Woolmer over the exclusion of Imran Farhat from the national team. 

Ilyas abused Woolmer for ignoring Farhat ? an opener who happens to be the former players son-in-law ? on the sidelines of a Twenty20 charity match in Lahore on Sunday. 

The former cricketer ?? part of the commentators panel ?? made a series of allegations and said Woolmer was here only to destroy Pakistan cricket. It needed PCB officials intervention to bring the ugly incident to an end. 

PCB director (Board Operations) Abbas Zaidi later confirmed that an inquiry had been ordered into the matter. (PTI)

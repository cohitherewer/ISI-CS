 We can reach final: Rajinder

New Delhi: Notwithstanding the absence of several key players, Indian hockey coach Rajinder Singh on Wednesday said the team has the potential to reach the final of the Rabobank tournament in Holland involving eight top sides of the world. 

He said the team has improved remarkably in different areas during the three-week camp which ended in Chandigarh on Wednesday. 

Reaching the final is a realistic target for us. The team has the skill and fitness to do that. Its just a matter of the team clicking, Rajinder said hours before the teams departure for Amstelveen. 

The federation gave us a pool of 26 players and we have picked the best possible squad for the tournament.

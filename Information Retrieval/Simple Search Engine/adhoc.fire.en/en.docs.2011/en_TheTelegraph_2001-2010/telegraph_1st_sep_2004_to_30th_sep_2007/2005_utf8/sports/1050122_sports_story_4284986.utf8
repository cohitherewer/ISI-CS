The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sachin is Sania?s role model

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The freshness-oozing Sania Mirza was exactly three when Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut, a shade over 15 years ago. As the Hyderabadi grew older, though, she began looking upon the maestro as a role model. 

That, at the very least, should induce a smile from Sachin who (owing to a troublesome left elbow) is going through a difficult phase. 

?Among tennis players, I?ve been a huge admirer of Steffi Graf? Outside the sport, however, Sachin has been my role model,? Sania told The Telegraph soon after her plucky display against the awesome Serena Williams on Friday. 

[Incidentally, Sachin is himself a Graf fan.] 

Speaking on her cell while returning to the hotel from Melbourne?s Flinders Park, she added: ?I continue to admire Sachin?s commitment and his calm manner? In fact, I try and stay as cool as he does? Not show much emotion? The calmness apart, he?s such a champion on the world stage? An absolute genius.? 

Sania, by the way, has met Sachin only once: ?It was in Hyderabad? Given the pressure of time, we chatted briefly? Yet, I remember that interaction. After all, it was time spent with my role model.? 

Concerned over Sachin?s nearly month-long lay-off, Sania hoped his recovery will be ?fast.? She herself needs to quickly recover from a sore ankle which is almost surely going to keep her away from the Thailand Open (beginning January 31). 

?I?ll be back on Sunday and look to being fully fit for the WTA event on home turf (from February 7),? she informed. 

Postscript: Most teenaged girls have a crush either on Yuvraj Singh or Irfan Pathan, but Sania is a Zaheer Khan fan. ?Don?t you think he?s an outstanding quick?? she asked laughing, adding: ?I do follow cricket in a big way?? We believe her.

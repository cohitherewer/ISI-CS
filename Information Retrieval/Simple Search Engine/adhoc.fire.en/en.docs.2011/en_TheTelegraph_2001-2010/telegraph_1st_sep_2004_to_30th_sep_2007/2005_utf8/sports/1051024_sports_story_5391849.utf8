 Mysore Derby postponed 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Owing to heavy rain, rendering the track unsuitable for racing, the stewards of the Mysore Race Club decided to postpone the Derby-day races scheduled for Sunday to Friday, according to an RCTC notification. The card already advertised for Sunday will hold good on the day and the inter-venue betting will be conducted by RCTC.

 In view of the above change, RCTC will not conduct the Delhi inter-venue betting on Friday, originally notified earlier.

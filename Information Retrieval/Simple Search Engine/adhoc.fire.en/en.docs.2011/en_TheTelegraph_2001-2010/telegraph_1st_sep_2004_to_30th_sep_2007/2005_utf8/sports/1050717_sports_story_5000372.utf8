Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA) hopes to involve Steve Waugh in the development of the game next season. 

 Steve has been very busy since he quit playing. He has just completed his term as Australian of the Year which kept him very busy? He is also directly involved with a number of charities, including Udayan. 

Former captains Allan Border and Mark Taylor are on our board. We hope to have Steve too, so that he can play an active role in the game, Bob Merriman, chairman Cricket Australia, told The Telegraph on Saturday. Merriman was in the city to attend a function. 

Besides being a selector, Border has served as under-19 coach and also filled in for Geoff Marsh in the senior team. 

Merriman is looking forward to the Ashes series and will fly to London from here to watch the first Test beginning at Lords on Thursday. 

Merriman is confident that Australia have the players to slip into the shoes of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne once they retire. 

People have to retire sometime or the other. There have been a host of experienced players who have quit over the last eight years. 

Trevor Hohns and his colleagues on the selection panel have taken it all in their stride. The selection committee is always looking to scout and groom talent. The selectors are conscious of their obligation to maintain the progression and succession parameters, Merriman explained. 

Cricket Australia had involved consultants McKinsey and Co. to evolve a strategic plan for running the board and their recommendations have been implemented from April, informed Merriman. 

He is happy that Australian coaches are in demand across the globe. 

Its a recognition of our peoples skills. Its nice to see that Australian players are putting so much back into the game. Greg Chappell did a lot of work in Australia and now he is in charge of the Indian side. After all, you can have only one national coach. 

The Indians are scheduled to tour Australia in 2007. As per the new agreement, the two teams will play four Tests every four years. Similarly, the five-match ODI series will be held every two years. 

Merriman said efforts are on to fit this schedule into ICCs six-year programme. The matter is likely to be discussed at a meeting in Dubai in mid-August.

 It?ll be tough to beat India: Inoyatov

New Delhi: Uzbekistan Davis Cupper Murad Inoyatov feels it would be difficult to beat hosts India in the Asia-Oceania zone group I second-round tie on grasscourts in Jaipur next weekend. 

?We are practising hard. We don?t play much on grass so we came here early to get used to it,? Inoyatov said. ?It is difficult to win against them. We have better chance in singles,? the 21-year-old said. 

Inoyatov and teammate Denis Istomin arrived here on Monday to acclimatise to the conditions and practise on grass. Akmal Sharipov and Farrukh Dustov, the other players, are expected to reach here on Saturday before the team leaves for Jaipur in the evening. 

On the Indian team, Inoyatov said: ?I know (Prakash) Amritraj and (Harsh) Mankad. I played Mankad in Mumbai in 2003 when I lost in three sets. ?The senior members like Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi are the boss in their game,? Inoyatov said. (PTI)

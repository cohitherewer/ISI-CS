 The new love in Beckhams life

 - England captain reveals he is an Andy Murray fan

 Murray is one of Beckhams best young sportsmen 

There are probably not that many facets of David Beckhams life that have gone unnoticed and unreported over the last few years, but the England football captain disclosed on Friday that he has a love for tennis and has been enjoying the emergence of Britains teenage player, the exciting Andy Murray. 

Do I know who Andy Murray is? Of course I know who Murray is. Everyone in Britain knows who he is. Its good to have new people coming through in tennis. Weve obviously got Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski already but its great for our country that weve got a talented young player like Murray coming through. I think Murray is great, the Real Madrid midfielder said. 

Beckham said that he has been following Murrays career with interest, and has become an enthusiastic supporter of the 18-year-old Scot. I have been watching what Murray has been doing, either in the newspapers or by seeing him on television. Its going to be exciting watching him develop as a player. I think hes one of Britains best young sportsmen. He looks like a good kid and an exciting and talented player, and Im sure that he will do well in the future in tennis, said Beckham, a spectator at this weeks Madrid Masters. 

As was evident here in Madrid, when he caused a dangerous crush just by attempting to leave his seat at the Pabellon de Cristal, Beckham knows a thing or two about having to deal with fame and attention. But he has no doubts that Murray will be able to handle the pressures of already being a top tennis player at the age of 18. 

Im sure that Murray will be able to cope with all the fame. From watching him, I dont think that will be a problem in his career, Beckham said. When I was watching coverage of Wimbledon in the summer, I saw his mother talking on the television and she was impressive. It is obvious that Murray has strong parents behind him, and thats what you need when you start out as a sportsman. 

When Murray was told what Beckham had said about him, it apparently made him giggle. Murray likes Beckham. I think its great that David Beckham loves tennis and has said that he is supporting me. Im flattered that one of the greatest sporting icons has been following what Im doing and watching some of my matches on television, Murray said. 

Though Murray is usually very patriotic when it comes to Scottish sport, he said that he will now be cheering for Beckhams England at the World Cup in Germany next summer. Ill be supporting him and his England teammates at the World Cup, but I wish that Scotland had qualified as well. And I wont be telling any of my Scottish friends that I will be supporting the England football team, Murray said. 

Murrays mother and manager, Judy, was taken by surprise by the Beckham endorsement. It is incredibly flattering what David said about Andy and I. Andy likes it that, just as tennis players take an interest in football, footballers are now following tennis too. Its good for tennis image that Beckham likes it. Judy said. 

Football plays a big part in Murrays life. Rarely does he play a match without at least once juggling a tennis ball with his feet, he was a guest on a cult football show last month, and has watched Chelsea this season. Murray also supports Barcelona FC, the local team in the city where he has based his training, but Beckham was not to know that. 

Beckham had never previously spoken about his love of tennis, but he has always enjoyed watching the sport. Its a sport that I love to watch whenever I can. I think tennis is a great sport. Its a quick and athletic sport and thats what I like about it, he said. 

Beckham said that he is planning a future visit to the Wimbledon Championships, hopefully to admire Murrays shot-making and hyper-confidence from close quarters. Next summer will not be possible as there is a World Cup to play. 

Wimbledon looks like a fantastic tournament, Beckham said. Its disappointing that I have never been. But I would love to go and watch Wimbledon sometime. That was where Murray did well this summer ? he got to the third round ? and maybe Ill get a chance to see him there in the future. 

As well as Murray, Beckham also admires Rafael Nadal, Spains world No 2. Despite the language barrier, the two have become friendly. 

So Beckhams influence is creeping into tennis. Beckham would surely like to speak privately with Murray. And with Amir Khan, the 18-year-old boxer, on Friday offering Murray ringside seats for his fight next month, there are clearly a growing number of leading British sportsmen who would like an audience with the teenage tennis player. 

But the attention from Beckham is unlikely to turn Murrays head. Murray is not about to become a style icon, a fashionista like Englands celebrity captain and Real Madrid galactico. Murray said that he does not like flash cars and big houses. And he only owns the one suit. And that was only because someone gave me the suit, Murray said. I have no intention of buying another one.

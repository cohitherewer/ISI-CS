Atlanta: American Bart Bryant stayed on course for a third PGA Tour title by firing a four-under-par 66 in the Tour Championship third round on Saturday. 

The 42-year-old journeyman, making his first appearance at the season-ending event, finished on 14-under 196 at the East Lake Golf Club, three strokes ahead of defending champion Retief Goosen who returned a 69. 

South African Goosen, who shared the overnight lead with Bryant, got his day off to a flying start with birdies at the first two holes and another at the sixth but could not match Bryant over the tough closing stretch. 

World No.1 Tiger Woods closed to within four of the lead with another gritty display, a 67 leaving him at 10-under 200 and in sight of his seventh title of the season. 

Woods is also on the brink of becoming golfs first $11 million man.

 PCB formally expresses reservations

New Delhi: Pakistan on Saturday formally expressed their ?inability? to play in Ahmedabad, one of the venues proposed to host a cricket Test when Pakistan tour arch-rivals India next month. 

In a letter to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the Pakistan Cricket Board said it had reservations over playing in Ahmedabad, highly-placed sources said. 

It is understood that they have asked for Chennai as an alternative venue. 

?The matter has been taken up with home minister Shivraj Patil and minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal,? sources said. 

Sources said BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla met Patil and discussed the matter with him. 

The BCCI is expected to decide on the venues by February 16. 

BCCI confirmation 

BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra on Saturday confirmed that the PCB had informed the Indian board about its reservations on playing a Test in Ahmedabad. 

?They have told us about their problems in playing there; they have also sent us a letter. I will put forward the letter in the BCCI working committee meeting to be held on the 17th,? Mahendra said.

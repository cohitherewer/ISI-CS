 Reds ask for right to defend title 

Istanbul: Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry has called on Uefa to let his team defend the Champions League title. He was backed by Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti who said Liverpool should be allowed into the competition next season after their astonishing win. 

Under competition rules a maximum of four clubs from each country can take part in the competition, and Liverpool missed out on a berth for next season by finishing fifth in England. However, one of the great ironies of the situation is that by winning the cup for the fifth time they can keep the trophy in perpetuity ? but not defend it. 

Uefas executive committee meet in Manchester on June 16 and will discuss the issue. At the moment Liverpool will only be able to take part in the Uefa Cup next season. (Reuters)

Perth: Man-of-the-Match Abdul Razzaq was 63 not out and took four for 53 to lead Pakistan to a three-wicket win over Australia in a tri-series match Sunday at the WACA ground. 

Yousuf Youhana was top scorer for Pakistan with 72 as the winners moved ahead of the West Indies and into second place in the tri-series standings. The winner of the Pakistan-West Indies match Tuesday in Perth will meet Australia in the best-of-three finals, starting next Friday in Melbourne. 

Australia reached 265 all out from their 50 overs but Razzaq, Youhana and a late burst from Shahid Afridi ? 30 off 13 balls ? steered Pakistan to 268 for seven with 16 balls to spare. 

Earlier, Michael Clarke made a defiant half-century for Australia. 

Hot weather and a hard, fast pitch at the WACA ground favoured batsmen, and Australia captain Ricky Ponting set out to take advantage of those conditions when he won the toss and elected to bat first. 

Australia scored slowly and lost wickets regularly against an accurate Pakistan attack, leaving the tourists an attainable target and a run-rate for victory of 5.3 per over. 

Australia were only 139 for four after 30 overs and 196 for seven after 40, but Clarke generated some impetus in the latter part of the innings, reaching 75 from 75 balls. 

With his guidance, particularly his 54-run eighth-wicket partnership with Brett Lee (22), Australia overcame early difficulties to post a reasonable score. 

Clarke came to the crease when Australia were 111 for three in the 22nd over and survived the remainder of the innings, taking part in seven partnerships which added 150 runs. He was unbeaten when Australia?s last wicket fell to the final ball of the innings. 

Earlier, Adam Gilchrist made a strong return to the Australian team after an extended absence through injury, scoring 47 from 46 balls with seven boundaries. 

Gilchrist did most of the early scoring as Australia reached 48 for one after 10 overs. Hayden failed again, making only six from 16 balls, while Ponting made 29 and Damien Martyn 24. 

Martyn was out when Australia were 111 and Ponting in the following over to leave the home side 113 for four, nearing the midpoint of their innings. 

Clarke put on 51 for the fifth wicket with Andrew Symonds, but Symonds and Simon Katich were dismissed in the space of five balls, leaving Australia 167 for six in the 35th over. 

Clarke continued to steady the innings then lifted the run-rate, putting on 68 runs in the last 10 overs, 37 in the last five.

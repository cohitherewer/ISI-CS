 Hari is 

sole leader 

Taiyuan (China): Continuing his winning ways, world junior champion P. Harikrishna outplayed Woman Grandmaster Zhao Xue of China in the second round to emerge the sole leader in the second Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters chess tournament here. 

With nine rounds still remaining in the category-15 round robin meet, Harikrishna is the only player with an absolute score. Grandmasters Luke McShane of England and Tigran Petrosian of Armenia are close on the heels of the Indian with 1.5 points each. 

Chinas GM Zhang Zhong, GM Wang Yue, GM Bu Xiangzhi and Wang Hao are next in line on one point each while top seed GM Alexander Motylev of Russia and GM Ni Hua of China ? both of who arrived late ? are another half point adrift with 0.5, with an extra game between them slated to be played on the rest day. 

Against Xue, Harikrishnas endgame prowess was on display as he played the final part of the game with conviction, leading to an easy win. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hearts won and matches lost

MADHUMITA GANGULY

 Sania

Calcutta: After seven eventful days, the curtain came down on the Sunfeast Open on Sunday. It is now time to count the gains and losses, time to weigh the pros and cons. 

The meet started with a lot of expectations. It had two of the worlds top 20 in its line-up ? world No. 12 Anastasia Myskina and No. 16 Elena Likhovtseva. Not to mention the crowds darling, Sania Mirza. 

The Netaji Indoor Stadium got an image makeover. The Greenset courts, the standard surface for indoor meets in Europe were in place and the meet with a total prize money of $ 170,000 (the minimum necessary for a tier III event) was ready to take the city by storm. 

 Crowd favourite 

The crowd, of course, only wanted Sania. And even the mention of her name evoked, as they say, a mania. The security cordon surrounding her would put that of any VVIP in the shade. Whether she was at the practice courts, or making brief stop-overs at city schools distributing tickets to winners of the Sunfeast Open Design the Trophy contest. Whether she was at the Indoor stalls signing autographs or inaugurating a Tata Indicom showroom, the blanket was in place. 

Sania took the meet into a different orbit. The stands were full the day she took on qualifier Junri Namigata of Japan in the first round ? and cruised 6-2, 6-2. 

The crowds thronged the day Sania clashed with Melinda Czink in the second round. Expectations reached a fever pitch. But alas, anticlimax. Indias darling went down 6-0, 4-6, 4-6 to the Hungarian (It just wasnt meant to be this year, said Sania after the loss). With her departure, the crowds thinned. The stands were deserted and there were no takers for tickets ? except by the real lovers of the game. 

Thank god for the fact that Sania continued till the semi-finals of the doubles. And thank god for the performance of the Uberoi sisters, Shikha and Neha. 

 Water hazard 

A meet of this dimension is bound to have some hiccups. A major snafu being water dripping from the air-conditioning ducts. It happens at all indoor tournaments, even at the best of them all, the Paris indoors, was how Mahesh Bhupathi, supremo of Globosport (the event owners and managers) dismissed the issue. And so, on and off during matches, boys would be running up to the courts to wipe dry the droplets of water on the courts. 

 Best-dressed 

The trophy for the best-dressed female during the meet goes to WTA supervisor Guilia Orlandi, who appeared for the prize distribution ceremony dressed in a sari and looking much in control of the situation. The second prize would go to chair umpire Mariana Alves of Portugal, who officiated in the final sporting a salwar-kameez. 

 Cats whiskers 

Was, of course, Myskina, who cruised to the singles crown and then teamed up with Likhovtseva to snatch the doubles title too. 

 Last word 

Minor issues apart, for an inaugural meet, it has been a commendable beginning, with the hope that organisers will be able to carry on from here in future.

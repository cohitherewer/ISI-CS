Ahmedabad: The pressure of having to prove a point or two did not affect Yuvraj Singh or deter him from playing his natural game. 

Whenever I go out to bat, I dont think about the past or future. I always try and perform to the best of my abilities, Yuvraj said on Tuesday. 

I also dont worry about whether I have cemented my place in the side or not. Its all about taking the team to a position from where we can win, and I am glad I was able to do that today (Tuesday). 

The idea was to stay positive? I have been in good touch, had two good one-day series and I wanted to carry on that form. You have to see the situation and play accordingly. I went out thinking positively, thinking of playing my natural game, he explained. 

The Punjab batsman was in no mood to compare this innings with previous knocks. I made a century in Lahore last year when the team was 120 for seven. That was satisfying. The last Test in Delhi was also good, I had an important partnership with Sourav. 

Here, we were 192 runs ahead. I have not played too many Tests, so I cant compare and rate knocks. But I am happy with whatever I have done so far. I am looking forward to doing better. 

Harbhajan Singh, the days other hero, also praised his statemates innings. 

It was a very good knock from him and a much-needed one from the teams point of view. The way he handled Murali and the other spinners was brilliant. The innings has put us in a fantastic position from which we can now look to win the game. 

The off-spinner did not wish to pick any of his seven wickets for special mention. I was very happy with all the wickets I took... all were special. 

Its not easy to take Test wickets, so every wicket is very satisfying. More than the wickets, I am happy with the way I am bowling. I am looking forward to having a bowl in the second innings too. 

Does he have a special plan for the second innings? The plan is just to bowl well and win the game, he quipped. 

It was important for us to start well, but we lost wickets early in the first innings. It was tough without Rahul (Dravid) in the side too, but we did well to get to nearly 400. We then bowled well and took our catches, and we need to do that again in the second innings. Hopefully, we can do that.

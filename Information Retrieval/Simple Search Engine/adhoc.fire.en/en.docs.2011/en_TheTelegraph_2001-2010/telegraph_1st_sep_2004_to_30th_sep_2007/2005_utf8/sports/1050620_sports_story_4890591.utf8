 IN THE CITY

 Calcutta: Mohammad Essa?s fine show in the just-concluded Pakistan versus India soccer series may have impressed the East Bengal officials, but the city club is yet to approach the striker from across the border.

 Essa, instrumental in Pakistan sharing the three-match series 1-1, was adjudged player of the series. An agency report quoted him as saying that East Bengal had invited him to play for the red-and-golds. 

 East Bengal, however, denied making him any offer. ?He has definitely impressed us, but we haven?t yet invited him to play for us,? a senior club official said. He added that the club would focus on foreign recruits once the inter-state transfers got over. 

 The official insisted the club is ?in a pretty good position? to clinch a deal with Mike Okoro. ?We?re hopeful of roping in him,? he said.

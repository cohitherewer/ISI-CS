 Sahaj Grover keeps golden hopes alive

Belfort: Sahaj Grover kept alive his dream of clinching the under-10 boys crown by defeating Malaysian Chiam eng Yeap in the 10th and penultimate round of the World Youth Chess championship. 

With just a round to go, Grover remained in joint lead with Russian Ivan Bukashvin, both with 8.5 points out of a possible 10. The duo is followed by Chinese Xu Xiaoyong (8), who plays Bukashvin in the final round. 

Grover, who is assured of the second spot, meets Jekhongir Vakhidov of Uzbekistan. To seal the gold, the Indian will have to win in case Xu gets the better of Bukashvin. 

WGM D. Harika came back into medal-reckoning in the under-16 girls section after crashing through the defence of Nazerke Rysbayeva. 

Harika (7.5), who meets leader Anna Muzychuk of Slovenia next, will have to win. 

Sahaj was simply outstanding in notching up full points over Yeap in 53 moves.

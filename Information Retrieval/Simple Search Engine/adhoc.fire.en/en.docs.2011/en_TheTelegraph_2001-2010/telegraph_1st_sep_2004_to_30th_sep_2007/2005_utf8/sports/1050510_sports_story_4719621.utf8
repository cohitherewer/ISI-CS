Madrid: Barcelona are within touching distance of their first league title in six years after a storming 2-0 victory over last seasons champions Valencia at the Mestalla on Sunday. 

A stunning 20-metre drive from Ronaldinho and a cool finish from leading scorer Samuel Eto two minutes later secured the win that puts Barcelona six points clear of Real Madrid at the top of the table with just three games left to play. 

A victory at struggling Levante next week would guarantee the Catalans a 17th league championship since they also have the advantage of a better record in head-to-head clashes with Real. 

Barcelona lead the standings on 81 points while Real, who crushed Racing Santander 5-0 on Saturday but look to be heading for a second successive season without a major trophy, have 75. 

Sevilla stay a distant third on 58 points despite their 0-1 defeat at city rivals Real Betis on Saturday while Villarreal are level on points in fourth after a 2-0 win at Malaga. 

Espanyol moved up to fifth on 56 points and condemned opponents Numancia to relegation with a 3-0 win at Montjuic. 

The result left the Sorians, who have only ever spent three seasons in the top flight, anchored to the bottom with 24 points, 11 adrift of safety. 

They are now eight points behind Levante, who occupy the last place above the drop zone with nine points to play for. 

Valencia, who needed to beat Barcelona to join the race for the Champions League places, looked as though they might prove to be awkward opponents for the league leaders in the opening minutes. 

Argentine playmaker Pablo Aimar created early problems for the visitors defence with his twisting runs from midfield and Brazilian defender Fabio Aurelio shaved the post with a curling free kick. 

But Barcelona saw off their opponents with two devastating strikes from Ronaldinho and Eto in the space of two minutes. 

World Player of the Year Ronaldinho grabbed the first when he sent a 20-metre rocket-shot fizzing into the top corner after fellow Brazilian Juliano Belletti had clipped the ball across the area from the right. 

Barcelona remained firmly in control in the second half and went close to scoring a third during a goalmouth scramble, but neither Giovanni van Bronckhorst nor Giuly could finish off after Ronaldinho had skipped his way into the area. 

Their task was made even easier 10 minutes later when Valencia defender Carlos Marchena was sent off for a wayward challenge on midfielder Deco. 

Olympique Lyon snatched their fourth Ligue 1 title in a row with a 2-1 win over AC Ajaccio on Sunday to cap a campaign they dominated from the start, adds a report from Paris. 

Lyon joined former giants St Etienne and Olympique Marseille as the only clubs to be crowned four times in succession. 

Its only the third time in the history of the French first division that a club has won the title so early. Reims and Nantes achieved the same feat in 1960 and 1966 respectively. (Reuters)

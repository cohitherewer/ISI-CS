 Safin?s crisis 

Barcelona: World No. 3 Marat Safin has admitted facing a crisis of confidence after being dumped out of the Barcelona Open by Argentine Jose Acasuso on Wednesday. 

The Russian, who started the year by winning the Australian Open, has lost form in recent months, losing to Juan Carlos Ferrero in Monte Carlo last week and suffering a surprise 6-4, 6-4 defeat in his first match in Barcelona. 

?I?ve had a poor two months after Australia and it?s very frustrating to be in this position,? said the 25-year-old. ?I?ve gradually lost all my confidence and that is why I lost today. My opponents know that Im struggling and they obviously take advantage. 

?I?m feeling a combination of frustration and pressure. I want to come back as fast as possible especially with the tournaments in Rome and Hamburg coming up, but there?s no strategy to solve the problem. It?s just a question of running hard, fighting and waiting for my opportunity.?

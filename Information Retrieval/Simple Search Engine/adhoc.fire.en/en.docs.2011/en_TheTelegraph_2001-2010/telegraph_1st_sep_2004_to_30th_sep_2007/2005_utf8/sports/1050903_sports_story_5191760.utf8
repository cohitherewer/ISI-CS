The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Forwards flop-show in Amstelveen

 Stickwork

 Gurbux Singh

 Im quite sure Sohail Abbas will 

 make himself available for Champions Trophy

 The most striking feature of Indias 

 dismal show at the eight-nation mini World Cup was the forwardlines 

 flop-show. It was pathetic to see Gagan Ajit Singh, Deepak 

 Thakur and Prabhjot Singh struggling to get their bearings 

 right in Amstelveen. The team lost all its round-robin league 

 games, scoring just two goals in three matches. The experienced 

 trio could neither score field goals nor probe the rival 

 defence lines consistently enough to force too many penalty 

 corners.

 That was unfortunate because they 

 looked to be in decent form in the preparatory camp and 

 trial matches. Gagan Ajit, in particular, had shown signs 

 of regaining prime form prior to the teams departure. 

 But once business time came around in Holland, they just 

 lost their game.

 Young right-out Rajpal Singh was 

 the sole redeeming figure in the forwardline. He was very 

 impressive till he got injured in the Pakistan game. In 

 my book, he was Indias find of the tournament.

 Though we lost by slender margins 

 to Spain, Germany and Pakistan, I wasnt satisfied 

 with the way our defence line functioned. But for some outstanding 

 saves by reserve goalkeeper Bharat Chetri, we could have 

 lost to England and finished last.

 In the half-line, Viren Rasquinha 

 and Arjun Halappa managed to do some justice to their reputation, 

 but Ignace Tirkey was below par.

 The way we started against Spain 

 should have sent alarm bells ringing. We were hopelessly 

 outplayed for most of the opening session and though we 

 did manage to contain them thereafter, there was nothing 

 in Indias game to suggest that they were one of the 

 serious contenders. In the end, we were lucky to concede 

 a solitary goal.

 Germany were the only team to 

 enter the tournament with a relatively young side. Forget 

 victory, we couldnt even salvage a point from this 

 game. One win or two draws would have ensured a fifth or 

 sixth place for India. I honestly didnt expect us 

 to play the final in such a high-quality field, but neither 

 did I imagine we would have to fight for the wooden spoon.

 Pakistan beat us pretty convincingly. 

 In fact, I was astonished to see the Pakistan team improve 

 so dramatically within a month and a half of the Azlan Shah 

 Cup where they cut a sorry figure. Their forwardline in 

 Amstelveen was too good. The forwards knew they had to deliver 

 as Pakistan were playing their first major tournament without 

 penalty corner wizard Sohail Abbas. And didnt they 

 deliver! The way they mastered Olympic champions Australia 

 in the final was a tribute to their spirit and skill.

 The mini World Cup triumph will 

 serve as a big boost to the Pakistanis for the forthcoming 

 Champions Trophy in Chennai. Im quite sure former 

 captains Sohail and Wasim Ahmed would both make themselves 

 available for Decembers Champions Trophy. Both had 

 said at the time of quitting that they wanted to clear the 

 path for youngsters but should the country need their services, 

 they would return to the team.

 Actually, Sohail and Wasim were 

 being very clever. They wanted to make money playing in 

 the European league, and thus couldnt have been available 

 for national duty for all tournaments. So they retired, 

 keeping open the option of playing the bigger tournaments 

 like Champions Trophy, Asian Games, World Cup and Olympics. 

 Its an arrangement which suits both parties perfectly.

 Coming back to the Indian forwards, 

 I dont want to be too harsh in judging their future. 

 Just because they had two poor tournaments doesnt 

 mean they should be written off. Its not easy to recover 

 from a slump, as our cricket captain Sourav Ganguly is discovering. 

 But, as the saying goes, form is just one good match away.

 In Indian sport, there is a tendency 

 for senior players to rest on laurels and take their places 

 for granted. The likes of Gagan Ajit, Deepak and Prabhjot 

 have not been pushed by the fringe players hard enough to 

 instil a sense of fear in their minds. In our time, there 

 would be five-six players of almost the same calibre fighting 

 for each position. 

 Ill give you two examples. 

 In the late 50s and early 60s, there were Udham Singh, Manuel, 

 Susinathan, Hardayal Singh, Pyara Singh and Sarpal Singh 

 all battling to earn the left out berth. And for the full-back 

 position, the fight was between Prithipal Singh, Jhamanlal 

 Sharma, Balkishen Singh, Gurjit Singh, Shantaram, Murthy, 

 Dharam Singh and myself! Mind you, all of them played in 

 the Olympics.

 Quality can emerge only from quantity. 

 Unfortunately, there is not enough strength on the bench 

 right now. Thats the most worrying thing in Indian 

 hockey.

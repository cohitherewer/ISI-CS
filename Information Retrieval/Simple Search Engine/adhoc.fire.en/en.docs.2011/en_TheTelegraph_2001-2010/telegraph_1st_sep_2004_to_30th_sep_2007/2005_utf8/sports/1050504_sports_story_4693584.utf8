The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Very tough draw, says Leander

 - WORLD GROUP PLAY-OFF

 India to face Sweden at home 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Leander feels the toughest assignment would have been playing Chile in Chile 

Calcutta: Indian prayers for a home tie have been answered alright, but they have drawn Davis Cup giants Sweden for the September 23-25 World Group play-off round. 

?It?s a very tough draw? Playing Sweden anywhere is tough, be it home or away,? was captain Leander Paes? first reaction on being contacted by The Telegraph. 

?We?ve always had a difficult time playing them, even at home, as they have accomplished grasscourt players like Jonas Bjorkman,? Paes said from Frankfurt where he was on transit en route to Rome. 

Of the four times India and Sweden have faced off in Davis Cup, the Scandinavian nation has triumphed 5-0 thrice ? 1987 final in Gothenburg, 1996 World Group quarter final in Calcutta and 2000 World Group play-off in Bastad ? and 4-1 in the 1995 World Group quarter final in Bangalore. 

But, as Paes admitted, the draw could have been tougher. ?Nothing would have been worse than playing Chile in Chile. We have got a home time and have to put our best foot forward.? 

Considering the Swedes? degree of comfort on grass, any chance of opting for a hardcourt surface? ?We have time on our hands? I?ll think it over in the next few days and talk to my players before making a decision,? Paes said. 

Reuters adds from London: World No. 1 Roger Federer is expected to return to Davis Cup action for Switzerland after his country was drawn to play Britain in another World Group play-off tie. 

Federer skipped Switzerland?s defeat by The Netherlands in March but is likely to feature in the home tie against a British side that will have to make do without leading player Tim Henman, who has retired from Davis Cup duty. 

Federer said he would keep his options open for later matches in the men?s team competition as long as they fit in with his schedule and a home tie against the British after all four Grand Slam tournaments have been completed is likely to suit him. 

Britain, who squeezed past Israel 3-2 in a European-African zonal tie in March, will be underdogs for the trip to Switzerland. 

Tuesday?s draw at the ITF headquarters in London also paired the United States away to Belgium. A glittering US team, featuring Andy Roddick and Andre Agassi, were shocked 2-3 by Croatia in California in March and will be desperate to make amends with victory over the Belgians. 

Failure to beat the Belgians would leave the US playing outside the elite 16-nation World Group for the first time since 1988. 

Champions Spain, who beat the US to win the 2004 title in Seville, were stunned by Slovakia in Bratislava in the first round and must overcome Italy and a partisan home crowd to stay in the World Group. 

Germany are away to the Czech Republic while Pakistan ? in a World Group play-off for the first time ? have to visit claycourt specialists Chile. 

Austria host Ecuador and Canada host Belarus to complete the play-offs.

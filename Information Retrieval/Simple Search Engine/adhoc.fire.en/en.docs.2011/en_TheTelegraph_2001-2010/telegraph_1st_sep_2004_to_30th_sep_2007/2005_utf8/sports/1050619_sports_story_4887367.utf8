 WILLIAM TELL

 Ganapathy

 Bangalore: The finish of the 1,600m Colts Trial Stakes the second classic of the season is the main attraction here on Sunday. Arturo, Yes Es Yes Ses, Flashing Star, Holding Court and Aleksei are all in with a chance as they look well prepared for the event. However, Flashing Star from the-ward of S. Ganapathy with B. Prakash in the saddle is tipped to lift the trophy.

Calcutta: A depleted Mohun Bagan will bank on Nigerian recruit Ajibade Babalade for a turnaround in their fortunes in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup when they on JCT on Wednesday at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

The green-and-maroon brigade, who have lost three of their NFL outings so far, will be looking forward to Babalade ? who will make his debut ? to do something magical to reverse their losing streak. Mohun Bagan have seven points from six games. 

Coach Subrata Bhattacharya didn?t utter a single word after the team?s practice on Tuesday. Bhattacharya?s deputy Shyamal Banerjee, however, spoke. ?It is true that our confidence is at the bottom, but you never know when the players will hit back, so obviously we are positive against JCT,? Banerjee said. 

According to Banerjee, goalie Prashanta Dora might have to it on the bench because of an injury. ?We are at definitely at disadvantage because of Dora?s absence but nothing can be done? We will have to do with the players available,? Banerjee said. 

On the other hand, JCT also struggling with seven points from six matches. They will miss the services of Sukhjinder Singh, who was injured in the match versus East Bengal on Thursday. 

Coach Sukhwinder Singh admitted that Mohun Bagan have few good players, especially in the midfield. ?But we will have to try and snatch points from them to be in better position,? Sukhwinder said.

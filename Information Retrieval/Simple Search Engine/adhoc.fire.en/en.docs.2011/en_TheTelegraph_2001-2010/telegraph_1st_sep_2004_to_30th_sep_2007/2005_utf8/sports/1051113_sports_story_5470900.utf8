 Beckham landmark can act as platform for greatness

 - England captain owes himself a good tournament more than anything else 

 ALAN SMITH 

 The friendly versus Argentina in Geneva is David Beckhams 50th match in the hot seat 

David Beckham was messing about on his computer the other night, downloading some songs on the internet, when he thought he would find out, just as a matter of interest, exactly where he stood in relation to previous England captains; how his own total compared with some of the greats before what is, for him, a highly prestigious landmark. 

Facing Argentina in the Stade de Geneve, Beckham captains his country for the 50th time almost five years to the day since Peter Taylor, in caretaker charge, handed over the armband for the first time. Quite a record, that. One to be immensely proud of. As he found out by tapping on his keyboard, only three players in history stand ahead in the queue. 

I saw that Bryan Robson was on 65, Bobby Moore was on 90 and so was Billy Wright, Beckham said Friday. I was wondering whether I could catch them. I saw Bryan Robsons [total] and thought yeah, thats possible, then I saw the other two and thought Well see! 

The flashbulbs exploded as those famous features broke out into a grin. Whatever else, the 30-year-old is a realist who knows that, despite Sven-Goran Erikssons unwavering support, another 40 caps, never mind as captain, could be pushing things slightly. 

As it is, the cry goes out to install the lion-hearted John Terry as captain in place of a man forever fighting the accusation that he isnt a natural leader. A proud patriotism, however, was there for all to see as Beckham went back to the day when Taylor, for a friendly in Italy, bestowed the ultimate honour. 

I was always hoping it wouldnt be just for the one game, he said. It was a case of keeping hold of it and proving I could be a captain, be a leader. People were doubting that I was the right person at the time and still are now. 

The consensus is that Beckham owes his country a good tournament after disappointments spanning France 98 (sent off against Argentina), the next World Cup in Japan (he rushed back too early from breaking a metatarsal) and finally, and most damning of all, Euro 2004 when he clearly wasnt match-fit. 

Yet talk of national debts is missing the point. Beckham owes himself a good tournament more than anything else. No top-class footballer, especially one who has enjoyed so much success at club level, wants to look back on a career, otherwise sensational, marred by underachievement on the biggest stage of all. 

The World Cup finals have always been the barometer. If you can turn it on there, your football credentials get immortalised in stone. Failure, on the other hand, casts a long shadow. Significantly perhaps, there arent many characters around who care so deeply about fame, about their lasting place in the firmament. It might just be enough to induce a last push. 

Something else, too, that falls on the plus side. There used to be a time when the nation wrung its hands if Beckham wasnt fit, fretting over how the team would get by. Not any more. 

Time has moved on. Wayne Rooney is the man now regarded as indispensable. At a push, you could also argue that, in terms of importance, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have overtaken their teammate. In reality, that might not be such a bad thing if it allows the playmaker to perform under slightly less pressure. 

With less of a defensive workload, he can get involved profitably inside and also up the right flank. In a similar system at Real Madrid, he manages this successfully most weeks. Why not for England on the road to Germany? 

As Beckham said, it has been an incredible journey, peppered with adrenaline-fuelled highs and gut-wrenching lows. Saturday marks the start of his last shot at glory. Attacked the right way, his 50th match as captain could set a trend for next summer.

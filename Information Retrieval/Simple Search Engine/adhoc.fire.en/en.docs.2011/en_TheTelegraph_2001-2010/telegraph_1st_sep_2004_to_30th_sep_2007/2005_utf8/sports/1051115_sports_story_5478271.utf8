 Agassi, Nadals turn to withdraw

 - ATP MASTERS CUP

Shanghai: Former world No. 1 Andre Agassi pulled out of the season-ending Masters Cup with injury on Monday, just hours after world No. 2 Rafael Nadal quit the $4.45 million event. 

American Agassi withdrew from the Shanghai finale after losing his opening group match to Russias Nikolay Davydenko 6-4 6-2, citing an injury to his left ankle. 

Earlier in the day, French Open champion Nadal, who had yet to play a match, pulled out with ligament damage in his left foot. 

Agassi badly sprained his ankle playing racquetball four weeks ago and was never in contention against Davydenko. 

The withdrawals of Agassi and Nadal are a huge blow for organisers of the lucrative event after Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt and Marat Safin all pulled out ahead of the tournament with injuries. 

Theres no chance for me to be able to play again, said Agassi, who had not played a match since losing to Roger Federer in the US Open final two months ago. 

Its very dangerous and risky for my future to be ready for anything in the next four or five weeks. Its still very painful and Im scared to hurt it worse. 

Agassi added: It was a third-degree sprain. All three ligaments were torn. My ankle was swollen and I couldnt walk for 12 days. I tried to rehabilitate quickly but I came here with a very low expectation of being healthy. 

Agassi will be replaced in the Gold Group by Chiles Fernando Gonzalez. 

Australian Open champion Safin gave up his place in the eight-man field last month as he continued to struggle with a knee injury. 

The Russian was soon joined on the sidelines by world No. 3 Roddick who was suffering lower back spasms. 

Twice-champion Hewitt cited personal reasons for his withdrawal ?his wife, television actress Bec Cartwright, is expecting the couples baby in Sydney within the next two weeks ? but he has also been recovering from a groin strain and toe surgery. 

World No. 1 Federer did make it to China but has only recently recovered from an ankle injury. 

Nadals place was taken by Argentinas Mariano Puerta, this years French Open runner-up. 

Puertas stay proved short as he was defeated by Argentinas Gaston Gaudio 6-3, 7-5 in their opening match on Monday. 

Puerta never seriously tested his compatriot. 

Nineteen-year-old Nadal hurt his ankle in winning the Madrid Masters final against Croatias Ivan Ljubicic in October. 

I had a lot of inflammation in the foot and its not improving, the Spaniard said.Last night I went to hospital for tests and at seven this morning more tests. 

The final decision is my decision but the doctor recommended I dont play. Its my first Masters so Im very disappointed.Nadal, who had been scheduled to play Argentinas Gaston Gaudio later on Monday, had sat out the final two weeks of the season because of knee tendinitis. 

Gaudio was unapologetic about the situation after his win over French Open runner-up Puerta. 

I think thats tennis, shrugged the 2004 Roland Garros winner. Sometimes you are unlucky. You get injured and theres nothing you can do about it. 

My coach told me as soon as I finished the match that Agassi pulled out. I really dont think about it. I have to think about the next match. 

Davydenko expressed surprise at Agassis withdrawal despite the Americans obvious distress. 

Today was surprising because Agassi was starting to play well, said the world number seven. But after the first set he got some problem and didnt want to play anymore. 

He just tried to play fast and lose the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bad shots, poor bowling cost India

Straight Talk

 Dilshan (right) is in the Aravinda mould

I suspect India have too many issues to ponder after Wednesdays match against Sri Lanka. They started off well and then lost the plot in batting. The same happened when they bowled. Sri Lanka were just a whistle away from being blown away. Such lordliness from a team trying to take fresh roots would hardly be funny to new coach Greg Chappell. 

It is stating the obvious that a lot of good starts were not built upon. India were 20-30 runs short in the end. Sourav Ganguly would have little complaints though he got out at the wrong time for India. Virender Sehwag did not make use of the chances but deserves sympathy because the wicket was too slow. 

It has not been a good bunch of one-day strips in Dambulla. Tillekeratne Dilshan is a part-time bowler in the Aravinda de Silva mould. He is the kind of bowler who relies on batsmen to make mistakes. And mistakes Indians sure did make. They played bad shots and a great platform was lost. 

Dilshan was the last man you expected to cause such damage. Given the pitches in the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean would be similar to what we have in Sri Lanka, Dilshan could inspire hope for the captain. 

The other star for Sri Lanka was Mahela Jayawardene. He is the kind of player who always relishes the Indian bowling. There were concerns about his form and about the manner in which he got out in the first two games, missing straight deliveries while attempting to drive. 

But Wednesday was his day as he was able to flick deliveries to fine-leg from the off and middle stump from the word go. The only regret for Mahela must be the run-out of Maravan Atapattu. This is the third time running when the two have been involved in harakiris and Atapattu has been at the receiving end. 

It seemed to have had a decisive impact on the game when Sri Lanka were six down with less than 100 on the board in next to no time. But Mahela himself in the end retrieved the situation. Running between the wickets is a matter of trust and understanding. A little nod of head and gesture from eyes is all you need. It becomes an even serious matter of concern when two senior players get involved in more than one run-out. 

India struggled once the fast bowlers were through with their spells and it has been a feature for them throughout the tournament. Three matches is a long time for an alternative or a change in plan to emerge. The opposition waits for weaker bowlers to come on and as Indian batsmen have not made big totals in the first place, the weaker links in bowling are being exploited to the full. 

India played an extra batsman once again. It is all the more disappointing that batsmen have still not been able to justify the trust in them. 

V.V.S. Laxman made a forgettable return to one-day cricket. His face was a giveaway as it showed him extremely uptight. Laxman is a slow starter in one-day cricket and there is no emergency in his batting, something which was badly required after the openers had given a solid start. He got a berth in the squad in the absence of some regular players and if he cannot make use of this divine intervention, he can as well bid goodbye to the next World Cup. 

Irfan Pathan offers hope to India as an allrounder in the making. He made some clean, whistling hits. He has good batting technique and if a fast bowler can contribute 30-40 runs in dominating style, it could be extremely useful to the batting team. 

I wont fault Rahul Dravid for Indias embarrassing loss as it was the batsmen and bowlers who were guilty. Dravid himself did not make any contribution but the leg-before verdict was debatable. 

First his batsmen wasted a good start and then bowlers drifted too much down the legside. It was strange to see even Harbhajan Singh not being able to control his spin, resulting in a number of wides and fours down the leg-side. He and the fifth bowler duo of Ganguly-Sehwag let the pressure off, which was so splendidly built by the fast bowlers. 

I am afraid it is increasingly looking the old familiar tale for the Indians in Sri Lanka.

 Kenya crisis

Nairobi: Kenyan sports minister Ochilo Ayacko has said Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) officials sacked last week for mismanagement may soon face corruption charges. 

Ayako said investigations had been launched into allegations that the officials may have been involved in fraud and other financial irregularities. 

Last week Ayacko fired the KCA board and named an interim committee to run the sport until fresh elections in April. (AFP)

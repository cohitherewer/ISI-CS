Kingstown (St Vincent): Fast bowler Abdul Razzaq claimed four for 29 to help Pakistan floor West Indies by 59 runs in the first one-day International at Arnos Vale on Wednesday. 

West Indies, coming off a 0-5 series sweep at the hands of South Africa, slumped to its seventh successive defeat. Since it won the champions trophy ? second only to the World Cup ? last September, West Indies has lost 10 of 11 one-dayers. 

Sent in, Pakistan was limited to 192 off 44.3 overs, but West Indies was bowled for 133 in 45.2 overs. 

 Rana Naved-ul Hassan chipped in with two early wickets to put the skids under the home team, while leg-spinner Shahid Afridi (2/28) and Shabbir Ahmed (2/19) also backed up Razzaqs Man-of-the-Match performance. 

Naved broke through in the fifth over when Xavier Marshall (three) top-edged a hook to wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal. 

Chris Gayle spanked five fours in 22 off 21 deliveries, including three in one over from Rao Iftikhar. But Naved made another decisive strike with a short ball that Gayle miscued into the leg-side. Akmal made good ground to the leg side to grasp a fine running catch. 

The middle order struggled against disciplined Pakistan bowling on a helpful pitch, and wickets continued to fall at regular intervals to dent the home teams chances. 

Ramnaresh Sarwan (nine) edged to first slip off Ahmed at 43 for three. 

Afridis introduction brought a wicket from his first ball, ending Runako Mortons laboured innings of 13 off 48 balls with a third catch to Kamran. 

The pursuit continued to fall apart with three wickets tumbling for three runs midway through the innings. Wavell Hinds (11) dragged on from Razzaq, soon followed in the pavilion by captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul (13) and Courtney Browne (0). 

Chanderpaul edged Razzaq to the wicketkeeper, while Browne chipped a return catch to Afridi to leave the innings in ruin at 77 for seven in the 28th over. 

Dwayne Bravo top-scored with 27 and added 39 for the eighth wicket with Ian Bradshaw (17). 

But the visitors wrapped up a comfortable victory once Razzaq pouched a return catch off Bradshaw to end the partnership. 

Razzaq added the wicket of Daren Powell (6) with a clever slower ball, and Shabbir sealed the win as bravo holed out to long-on. 

Earlier, Pakistan opener Salman Butt top-scored with 43, and his teams innings was given a rousing start by Afridi, who hit three boundaries in 24 off 21 balls. But his bizarre run out injected life into the West Indian effort. 

Afridi would have made a second run but in stretching for his crease, he lost his bat and wicketkeeper Browne broke the stumps from Corey Collymores return. 

Browne also accounted for Shoaib Malik (13), who edged Bradshaw at 55 for two in the 13th over. 

Yousuf Youhana and butt shared 40 for the third wicket before the second of three run outs in the innings started a slide. 

Butt fell seven runs short of a half-century when he slashed Bravos medium pace to backward point. 

Youhana struck a composed 30 off 46 deliveries before he was undone by some swift work by Browne as the batsman strayed out of his crease after steering the ball into the ground. 

The innings fell away after that with Gayle delivering two telling blows with the wickets of captain Inzamam-ul Haq (23) and deputy Younis Khan (nine) in the same over. 

Inzamam misjudged a sweep and was bowled behind his back while Younis chipped a return catch that Gayle dived full length to his right to pouch. 

The lower order could not rally and only Razzaq with 22 off 31 balls passed double figures. Off-spinner Gayle led the bowling with three for 48 off 10 overs. Bradshaw ended with two for 27 off eight overs.

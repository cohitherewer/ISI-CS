 Pele predicts a repeat final 

Berlin: Pele predicts the 2006 World Cup final will be a repeat of four years ago when Brazil defeated Germany 2-0 in Japan. 

Germany host the next World Cup and Brazils three-time World Cup winner believes the two nations will be in the final again on July 9, next year. 

Brazil and Germany will face one another in the final, said Pele, who was in Brazils winning teams in 1958, 1962 and 1970. 

Germany always seem to have a good team for the World Cup and with home support they will reach the final again. 

Germany and Brazil are currently taking part in the Confederations Cup, running from Wednesday to June 29, in a dress rehearsal for the main event a year later.

 Trescothick, Flintoff will be prized wickets, says Rana

Rawalpindi: Pakistan seamer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan has picked out Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Flintoff as the most prized wickets in the Test series against England. 

Trescothick has matured into a fine player. His wicket and that of Flintoff will be prized ones in Pakistan, Rana said on Wednesday. 

Trescothick struck form in Englands first tour game against a Pakistan Cricket Board Patrons XI with two unbeaten innings of 124 and 38. 

Rana has been overshadowed by the more flamboyant pace bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami since making his debut in 2003, but after a successful season with English County Sussex ? where he took 54 wickets ? he is ready to take centrestage. 

I have gained a lot of confidence with Sussex. My control over the old ball and reverse swing is also very good now. I can take the pressure of spearheading the attack now, the 27-year-old said. 

In Pakistan the pitches are low bounced and slow and the ball gets old quickly. Any bowler who has control over reverse swing will be successful. 

I got a chance to bowl on dry wickets in England in August and September and the ball did a lot of reverse swing. This will help me a lot in the coming series, he said. 

A successful one-day player with 55 wickets in 31 matches, Rana has yet to cement his place in the Test side. He has played just five Tests and taken eight wickets at an average of 76.62. 

He has been included in Pakistans 16-man squad for the first two Tests against England. The first Test in Multan starts on November 12.

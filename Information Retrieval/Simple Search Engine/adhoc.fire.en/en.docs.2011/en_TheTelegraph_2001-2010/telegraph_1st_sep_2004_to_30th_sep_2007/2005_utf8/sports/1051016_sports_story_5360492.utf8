 Dubai: Indian tennis great Vijay Amritraj will join former stars like Bjorn Borg, Henri Leconte, Guy Forget and Michael Stich at the Legends Rock Dubai Seniors Tournament here next month.

 Amritraj, who was the top tennis player in Asia for 14 straight years during the late seventies and eighties, will be seen in action at the November 8-10 tournament to be played at the Madinat Arena.

 ?This seniors event that I am participating in will continue to generate interest in tennis in the gulf,? said Amritraj who is also the United Nations Messenger of Peace.

 Madrid: World No. 2 Rafael Nadal is determined to end his poor record at the Madrid Masters by winning next week?s tournament. The 19-year-old Nadal has won only one match on the two previous occasions he has taken part in the event but is top seed this year in the absence of injured world No. 1 Roger Federer.

 ?I want to cap the season with a good performance here in Madrid and improve on my results in previous years,? said the Spaniard, who lost in the first round in 2003 and in the second round last year.

 ?I want to get even with this tournament. I?ve never found my form here and that?s why I?ve prepared more carefully this time. I?d love to win the event. The centre court is beautiful and the atmosphere is always great.? Nadal has won 10 titles this season, one fewer than Federer, but the absence of the Swiss as well as Lleyton Hewitt, Andre Agassi and last year?s winner Marat Safin could open the door for the young Mallorcan.

 New Delhi: Hyderabad has been awarded the 2007 Asian Youth Weightlifting Championships. ?The Asian Weightlifting Federation decided during its recent meeting in Dubai that India will host the 2007 edition of the championships,? Indian Weightlifting Federation general secretary Balbir Singh Bhatia said on Saturday.

 ?When we suggested that we will host the event at Hyderabad, they were immediately ready to give the championships to us as they had good memories of their stay there during the Afro-Asian Games,? he said.

 Phillip Island (Australia): American Nicky Hayden recorded the fastest-ever lap at Phillip Island on Saturday to take pole position for Sunday?s Australian MotoGP, relegating world champion Valentino Rossi to second spot. Hayden clocked 1:29.337 on his 29th of 30 laps as the top five riders all dipped under 90 seconds at the 4.448 km track.

 Rome: A long-running dispute over money has ended with the Italian football league splitting by mutual consent, allowing Serie A and Serie B to pursue their own financial interests. ?This is a consensual separation that will be for the good of all,? Football league president Adriano Galliani said.

 The league has looked after the joint interests of Serie A and Serie B since 1946. But the two divisions have been at odds since 1999 when the government passed a law allowing clubs to negotiate their own television deals.

 Dakar: Senegal have announced their intention to bid for the 2010 African Nations Cup finals, the year the World Cup comes to Africa for the first time.

 Senegal join a growing list of potential candidates ahead of the deadline for entries at the end of the month.

 I am an off-spinner. Should I flight the ball when a batsman is on the rampage?

 (Tapan Dhar, 15, Calcutta-14)

 No harm in giving it a go. Its important to try and vary your pace.

 I always get out after scoring a quick 20 or 30. Please suggest a remedy.

 (Shreyas Grover, 14, Calcutta-34)

 There is obviously a lapse in concentration. Keep talking to yourself not to get carried away, especially when you reach the 20s.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Very often a sudden lapse in concentration leads to my dismissal after getting past 50. How can I correct this?

 (Sandip Ghosh, 25, Guwahati)

 Avoid looking at the scoreboard. Concentrate on the present which means one ball at a time.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I have a big backlift and that leads to problems when tackling short-pitched deliveries. Please help.

 (Jishnu Upadhyay, 19, Chandannagar)

 More than the backlift it is important to watch the ball closely without taking your eyes off it.

 I am a right-arm medium-pacer. Whenever I try a yorker, I end up bowling a full toss. Please help.

 (Ramesh Karmakar, 19, Calcutta-17)

 Its a ball that demands a lot of practice. Try and target the base of the stumps and see how it goes.

 I am a right-handed opener. A couple of months back I got hit on the face by a bouncer. I needed stitches. Now I think I am short on confidence when at the crease. Please help.

 (Tarun Sengupta, 18, Calcutta-10)

 Dont be a coward and run away from the problem. It will only become a bigger problem. Instead, get back to the nets and ensure you dont take your eyes off the ball and use the depth of the crease when playing back.

 I am a left-handed batsman. I am comfortable against off-spinners but often get out to a leg-spinner. Why does this happen?

 (Harshvardhan Bukalsaria, 16, Dibrugarh)

 Work on your footwork. Get as close to the pitch of the ball as possible.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing leg-spinners?

 (Biswajit Roy, 17, Calcutta-84)

 I dont think so as you are giving the bowler a good view of the stumps.

 I am a medium-pacer and would like to know the ideal length for pitching a bouncer?

 (Samit Tandon, 19, Calcutta-41)

 The ideal length is when you can make him fend it off his face.

 I am an off-spinner and would like to know the ideal length for bowling an off-break?

 (Subir Roy, 13, Guwahati)

 The ideal length is when you keep the ball up and make the batsman grope forward and reach out for the ball.

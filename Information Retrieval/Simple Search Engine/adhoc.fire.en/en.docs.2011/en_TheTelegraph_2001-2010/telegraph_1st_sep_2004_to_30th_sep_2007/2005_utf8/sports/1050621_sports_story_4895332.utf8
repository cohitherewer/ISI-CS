 India cancel trip, Pak face ban

Islamabad: Pakistan could face a ban for denying visas to Indian boxers, the Pakistan Boxing Federation (PBF) chairman Anwar Chowdhry said. 

As per rules of the Amateur International Boxing Association (AIBA), all host countries are bound to arrange for visas of the participating teams in an international championship, but despite our repeated requests visas were refused to Indian and Taipei boxers, Chowdhry was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 

A 14-member Indian contingent was scheduled to take part in the inaugural Asian junior championship which began in Karachi on Monday. 

The Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) was due to send its team on Saturday, but waited two more days before cancelling the trip. 

Our team cannot leave for Karachi as the Pakistan embassy has not issued us visas. They said Pakistans interior ministry did not allow them to issue visas to the boxers, an IABF official said in Delhi. 

Chowdhry, who also heads the AIBA, said the PBF could be banned from participating in international events for failing to fulfil its obligation towards visiting teams. 

If the AIBA bans Pakistan for some years we wont be able to participate in the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and other events, he said.

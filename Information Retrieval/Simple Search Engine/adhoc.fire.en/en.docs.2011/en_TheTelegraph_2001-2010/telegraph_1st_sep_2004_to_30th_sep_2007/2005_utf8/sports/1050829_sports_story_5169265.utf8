 PCB asks BCCI to clear dues

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has written to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), asking it to speed up the process of disbursing an outstanding amount of $3.7 million from the earnings of the 1996 World Cup. 

A senior PCB official confirmed that the board was still awaiting a reply from BCCI on the issue, which has dragged on for the last nine years owing to heavy taxing by the Indian government on earnings from sporting events. 

However, we are confident that we will have our final share soon since the government recently gave a tax exemption to the BCCI for next years ICC Champions Trophy, which will be hosted by India, the official was quoted as saying in a local daily here on Sunday. 

Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka jointly hosted the 1996 World Cup with an organising committee known as Pilcom, which managed all the financial matters. 

The PCB official said that since Pilcom was based in India, it was responsible for distributing the profits to the organising countries. 

We did receive initial payments from the tournament earnings but the final clearance was held up due to the tax problems with the Indian government.

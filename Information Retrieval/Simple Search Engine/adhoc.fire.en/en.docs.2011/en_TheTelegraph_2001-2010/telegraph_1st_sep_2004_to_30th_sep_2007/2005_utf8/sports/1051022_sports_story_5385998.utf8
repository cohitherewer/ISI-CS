 Chopra at tied 15th

Lake Buena Vista (US): Daniel Chopra shot a six-under 66 on the opening day of the Funai Classic to be in the tied 15th place. 

Chopra, whose 12th place finish at the Michelin Championships last week ensured that he would have a full PGA Tour card for 2006, had just one bogey and seven birdies. Chopra played the first day at the shorter 6957-yard par-72 Palm Course, and will next play at the longer 7,516-yard par-72 Magnolia Course. (PTI)

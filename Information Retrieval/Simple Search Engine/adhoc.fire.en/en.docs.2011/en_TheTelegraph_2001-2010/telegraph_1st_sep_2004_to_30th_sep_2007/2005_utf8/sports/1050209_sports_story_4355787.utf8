Paris: European champions Greece look to salvage their World Cup hopes at home to Denmark on Wednesday in a match which many feel said they must win. 

The high of victory at Euro 2004 was followed by the low of losing their opening World Cup qualifying match 1-2 at little Albania and now they lie fifth in group II with five points from four matches. 

Greece trained under the watchful eyes of coach Otto Rehhagel in freezing weather at Athens? Karaisiaki Stadium, where a sellout crowd of 33,000 is expected for the match. 

The only problem for Rehhagel was Bordeaux defender Michalis Kapsis who has a back injury and was feeling ill with the flu. 

Bolton midfielder Stylianos Giannakopoulos said he was dreaming of helping Greece to their second World Cup finals ? the other was 1994 ? but said no slip-ups could be tolerated now. 

?As the situation is now, a draw is not good enough,? he said. ?We all know how important the match is but we are European champions and we must win.? 

Denmark, second in the group table, had the setback of losing midfielder Thomas Rasmussen because of illness. They were already without calf-victim Thomas Helveg and out-of-form Claus Jensen. 

Meanwhile, group II leaders Ukraine travel to Tirana for their fixture against Albania. Striker David Villa and midfielders Antonio Guayre and Ivan de la Pena could earn their debut appearances for Spain in their group VII match against San Marino in Almeria, southern Spain. 

Spain are in third spot with five points from three matches in group VII, behind pool leaders Serbia and Montenegro. 

?Keeper Mickael Landreau has been called up into the France squad in the absence of Fabien Barthez for a friendly at home to Sweden. 

Lyon?s Gregory Coupet will play between the posts in the Stade de Drance fixture with Landreau in the squad as back-up. 

Coupet, though, will not have to face the potent strike-threat of Juventus? Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as he injured his back in the 0-1 defeat by Palermo on Saturday.

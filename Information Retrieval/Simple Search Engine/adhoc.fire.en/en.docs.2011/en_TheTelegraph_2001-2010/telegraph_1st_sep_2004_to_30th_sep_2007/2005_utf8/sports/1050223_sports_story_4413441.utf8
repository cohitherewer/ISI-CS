Hair will officiate with Steve Bucknor in the second Test in Calcutta (March 16-20) where the West Indian would reach a landmark by becoming the first umpire to stand in 100 Tests. 

Simon Taufel and Billy Bowden will be the umpires in the third and final Test, the ICC said in a release adding that Chris Broad would be the match referee for the series. 

Bowden will be the umpire in the first three one-day Internationals between the two sides, while Koertzen will take this role in the final three limited-overs matches.

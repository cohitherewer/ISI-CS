 Ponting condemns incident

Perth: Australian captain Ricky Ponting has condemned spectators who made racist taunts to South African players during the first Test match in Perth. 

South Africas management has officially complained about the abuse to International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Chris Broad and John Rhodes, the head of the ICCs regional anti-corruption and security unit. 

On Wednesday before the Australian team flew to Melbourne for the second Test, Ponting while speaking to the reporters said that he was disappointed to hear some spectators had made racist remarks and the Australian players had not been aware it was happening. 

Theres no room in sport for racism, Ponting said. 

The players are all very aware of that, the crowd needs to be aware of that and enjoy the game for what it is.

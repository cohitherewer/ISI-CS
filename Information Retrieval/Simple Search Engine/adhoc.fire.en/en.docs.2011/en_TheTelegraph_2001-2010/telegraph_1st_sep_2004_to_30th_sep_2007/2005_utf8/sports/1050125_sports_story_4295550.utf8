 Noel Wilson likely to man Bagan defence

Calcutta: The ninth National Football League (NFL) is into its third round only and three-time champions Mohun Bagan are already in troubled waters. With a solitary point to show for from two matches, Subrata Bhattacharya?s men go into Tuesday?s clash versus Sporting Club de Goa knowing that anything less than a maximum return will push them to a corner from which dreaming of the title will be a luxury. 

Sporting, on the contrary, have four points in their kitty from the opening two encounters. Last season, they were the only Goan outfit to win matches in Calcutta. 

It?s not that Mohun Bagan have been playing abysmal football of late. In fact, they have only themselves to blame for not winning both home games (versus East Bengal and Mahindra United). The midfield has been functioning smoothly, led by Dharamjit Singh, but the green-and-maroons have been let down by the lack of striking ability. 

The defence also faltered at the crunch, conceding a highly avoidable penalty two minutes from time against Mahindra. 

As if the existing problems were not enough, Subrata has to contend with serious injury/card absentees. Mehrajuddin Wadao, a regular at the heart of defence, will miss the game at Salt Lake Stadium because of a double booking. And Tomba Singh, a key member of the flourishing midfield, has been ruled out by a knee injury which he sustained in the Mahindra match. 

Those are two huge setbacks for the Mohun Bagan coach. He could have breathed a little easy had the club been able to register defender Ajibade Babalade, the latest Nigerian import. But no headway has been made on that front yet. 

Subrata is likely to field Noel Wilson as Mehrajuddin?s replacement, but that will leave the midfield without two important players. 

?It?s a must-win game for us and we have to do it with the players we have,? said Subrata after the morning workout on a chilly Monday. 

The one encouraging news on the Mohun Bagan front is that striker Sunil Chhetri is fit to start. With Subrata not being a big fan of Brazilian Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?, Chhetri may well be chosen as Biswas? strike partner. Jerry Zirsanga, who was the second striker in the previous game, will function in a more accustomed role as a medio. 

The Mohun Bagan coach has the highest regard for his opponents. In fact, Subrata considers Sporting as the best Goan outfit, having seen them knock out East Bengal in the Federation Cup earlier this season. 

?They run very hard and play good possession football. Also, their foreigners are the best in the NFL so far,? Subrata remarked. All three of their foreign recruits are Nigerians ? strikers Dudu Omagbemi, Chidi Edeh and medio Adebayo Adewusi. 

Edeh, who donned Mohammedan Sporting colours last season, will need attention as he has scored in both matches so far. Dudu, a Sporting regular, is no bunny either. 

The foreigners apart, the Goans? strength is that they have a young outfit with as many as 24 local boys in a roster of 29. The only other non-Goans are Rajesh Meetei and K. Jeetesh. 

Having finished eighth last year, a top-five slot is what they are aiming for this time. The conquest of Mohun Bagan, to whom they bowed in the Federation Cup semis, would put them on the right track.

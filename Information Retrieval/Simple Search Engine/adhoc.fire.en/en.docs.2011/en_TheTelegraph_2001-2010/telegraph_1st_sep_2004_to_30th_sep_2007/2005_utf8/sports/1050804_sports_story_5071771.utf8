 It will be tough for Radcliffe in Helsinki

Helsinki: One of the more emotive memories from the Athens Olympics was the failure of British runner Paula Radcliffe to complete either the marathon or 10,000m. 

But since flopping in both events last year Radcliffe has since rebounded to win both the New York and London marathons and goes into the World Championships in Helsinki as favourite for the longer race. 

She is also entered for the 10,000m. Completing the two races would be nothing short of much-needed redemption for the runner firstly lauded and then widely spurned by a demanding British public and media in Athens. 

In the Greek capital, Radcliffe crashed out of the marathon at the 36-km mark, staggering to a halt before trying to start running again. 

Eventually the 31-year-old Briton sat on the side of a road, holding her head in her hands, choking back tears, unable to explain her disastrous showing. 

Radcliffe had previously finished fifth in the 5,000m at the 1996 Atlanta Games and was fourth in the 10,000m in Sydney, while she finished second in the 10,000m in the 1999 worlds. 

Fellow Briton Liz McColgan, the 1991 world 10,000m champion, fears Radcliffe will miss out in the shorter race and then pay the price for her efforts when the marathon comes around in Helsinki. 

Radcliffes schedule sees her attempting to win gold in the womens 10,000m next Saturday night, before entering the marathon eight days later in the Finnish capital. 

It is anticipated that Radcliffe will face stiff opposition from four Ethiopian athletes, including pre-race favourite Tirunesh Dibaba and defending champion Berhane Adere, in the 10,000m. 

The standard is so high and the Ethiopians are so good on the track that I think she would be stupid to do both, said McColgan. 

She must concentrate on her strongest event ? the marathon ? and go and get that medal. 

Radcliffes British teammate Jo Pavey nevertheless is backing Radcliffes double bid. 

Paulas obviously such a fantastic athlete and so experienced shell know whats best for her, said Pavey. 

Dont worry about her. She is so experienced shell be well prepared. Well wait and see ? but I think it will be exciting to see her doing both races.

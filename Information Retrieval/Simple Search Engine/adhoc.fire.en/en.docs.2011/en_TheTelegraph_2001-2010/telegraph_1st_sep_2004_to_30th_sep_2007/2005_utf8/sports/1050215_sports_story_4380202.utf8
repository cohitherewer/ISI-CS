 PCB looks at Waqar option

 Both Inzamam and Woolmer are keen on Waqar 

Karachi: Former captain Waqar Younis is being considered as Pakistan?s fast bowling coach for this month?s tour of India. 

?Yes, he is under consideration but no negotiations have started. In the next few days, we intend to write to him to seek his availability,? PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

Waqar, who is currently in Australia, took 373 Test and 416 one-day wickets during his illustrious career. 

Shaharyar, who was manager of the 2003 World Cup team captained by Waqar, however, made it clear that the PCB wanted to ensure there was no conflict of interest. 

?We all know Waqar Younis has recently been doing television assignments. We want to know if he is free during the Indian series so that we can utilise his services,? he said. 

Nevertheless, sources in PCB confirmed Waqar has verbally conveyed his availability for the assignment. 

?He was offered the job in Australia where he was doing television commentary during Pakistan?s tour. Even during spare time, he was assisting the fast bowlers,? sources said. 

?Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is extremely keen to have Waqar Younis as bowling coach and the idea is being supported by coach Bob Woolmer,? they said, adding too many extras being conceded by the bowlers had made it imperative to have a specialist on board. 

Pakistan bowled 15 wides and 59 no balls in four innings of three Tests against Australia while a staggering 45 no balls and 69 wides were recorded in the eight one-day games. Against India last year, Pakistan bowled 14 wides and 22 no balls in the Test series and 35 no balls and 73 wide balls in the five one-dayers. 

?Yes, the extras are definitely a matter of grave concern but it is also being felt that the talent is there but no one is around to groom or polish that talent. Fast bowling is not about sprinting in and throwing that ball at full force. It?s a science now and you need scientists like Waqar Younis or Wasim Akram to pass on the knowledge to the next generation,? sources said. 

Wasim Akram was also approached for the job but he expressed his inability because of his media commitments, they said.

 4 venues added to list

Bridgetown: Stadiums in Barbados, Jamaica, St Vincent and Trinidad were added to the list of venues that will host warm-up matches for the 2007 cricket World Cup. 

One of the venues is a new, 15,000-seat stadium to be built in Trinidad, which will be named in honour of Brian Lara, said venue development director Don Lockerbie. 

Lara, a native Trinidadian, holds the record for the highest score in Test cricket (400 not out) and first-class cricket (501 not out). 

The three Ws Oval, outside Bridgetown, Barbados; The Trelawney Stadium, under construction in western Jamaica; and Arnos Vale playing field in St Vincent complete the list. 

The three Ws Oval underwent a $500,000 (euro 396,000) upgrade, and further development is being planned for the World Cup. (AP)

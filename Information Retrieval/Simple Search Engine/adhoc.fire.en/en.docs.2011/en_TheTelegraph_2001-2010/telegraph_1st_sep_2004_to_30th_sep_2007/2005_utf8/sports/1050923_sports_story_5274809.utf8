 Win was expected

 - We used opportunities well: Sourav 

 Zaheer Khan in Harare on Thursday 

Harare: Captain Sourav Ganguly on Thursday said that some outstanding bowling performances, combined with good cricket on the field, helped India clinch the two-Test series against Zimbabwe here. 

We played well. We had expected some resistance in the second innings, but we used the opportunities that came across our way, Sourav said after India stamped a 10-wicket victory against Zimbabwe in the second and final Test. 

It was Indias first series win outside the sub-continent since 1986, when Kapils Devils clinched a 2-0 victory in England. 

India won the first Test in Bulawayo in an innings and 90 runs. 

Sourav agreed that the result was expected. 

Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu said that his team had come back well in the second innings to reach 223 after being bowled out for 161 in the first innings. 

I am happy the way our players came back well as their bowling was really excellent, he said. 

Taibu also praised his fast bowler Heath Streak for his career-best six wicket haul in the first innings. 

We were able to take wickets in the first innings even though the wicket was sticky, with the help of Streak, he said. 

Irfan Pathan, who was adjudged the Man-of-the-Match as well as the Man-of-the-Series, said the track was different from the one in Bulawayo. 

It was a different track, a good wicket though. I knew that the wicket and the atmosphere were going to help me, he said. 

Pathan, who finished with 21 wickets in the series, insisted that he was also working hard on his batting. 

I am trying to be helpful to the team at the seventh position. It will come if I keep working hard, the pacer, who scored a decent 32, said.

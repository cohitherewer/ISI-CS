The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 None in Australia team is a certainty

Australia have put themselves in a good position at the end of the first day of the Super Test. Yet, the World XI wont be too disappointed with their comeback. Having got most of the Aussie batsmen out, they now have the tail to dismiss and with the second new ball due, they can hope to get the remaining wickets quickly. Mind you, we have seen in the recent Ashes series that both Shane Warne and Brett Lee can be stubborn customers who play totally unorthodox shots. 

Theres also the matter of Adam Gilchrist who continued his good form with the bat against the World team and is closing in on a century. So even as the World team give themselves every chance of dismissing the Aussies early, the hosts themselves will be looking for a total closer to 500. 

Steve Harmison has been bowling brilliantly at the nets and he gave the first breakthrough, getting through an expansive drive by Justin Langer, but the Australian captain Ricky Ponting batted quite superbly to stave off the early threat of Harmison with a partnership with Matthew Hayden. That had Graeme Smith turning to his spinners sooner than he would have liked. 

The reception Ponting got from the crowd was a heart-warming one and those from the subcontinent, where emotions rule, were surprised by the warmth and spontaneity of the reception. Remember, Ponting is the captain who lost the Ashes after a long time, so its not an everyday occurrence as the Aussies hate to lose and especially to the Poms. Yet here, he was being applauded all the way to the crease. Maybe theres a lesson in it for us in India, who now believe in everything Australian, so why not treat our players the same way as the Aussies do theirs, with respect even if they have lost a big series? 

Even when he was out to a soft dismissal trying to steer a ball to the thirdman boundary and only giving catching practice to Kallis at second slip, there were no boos as he trudged upset to the pavilion. 

Australias new number four Michael Clarke did not really look settled and became the first to be dismissed via the third umpire mode when the appeal was referred to the TV umpire. 

Katich was definitely unlucky as he found Murali coming in his way, albeit accidentally. Watson, another of the new kids on the block, looked sure and if he comes good, Australia may well have a new tactic of playing Gilchrist at six and having the allrounder Watson at seven, thus giving them five regular bowlers. 

What a difference a series loss makes! Its good that nobody in this side considers himself a certainty. 

 One feels for Brad Hodge as he found himself being twelfth man again. 

The pitch seems full of runs though with the odd ball bouncing and turning, both Warne and MacGill must be fancying their chances.

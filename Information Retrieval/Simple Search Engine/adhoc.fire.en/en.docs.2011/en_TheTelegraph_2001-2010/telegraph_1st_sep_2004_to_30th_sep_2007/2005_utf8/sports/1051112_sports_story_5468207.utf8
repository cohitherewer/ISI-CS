The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are ready to face Brazil, says Owen 

 Ronaldinho is received upon his arrival at Abu Dhabi airport on Friday. Brazil will play a friendly with the UAE in Abu Dhabi on Saturday 

London: Striker Michael Owen says England would have nothing to fear from Brazil if they had to face the holders at next years World Cup. 

Brazil, who beat England 2-1 in the 2002 quarter finals, are even bigger favourites for 2006 since the emergence of forwards Adriano and Robinho in a side that already has the likes of Ronaldo and Ronaldinho up front. 

I certainly dont see them as unbeatable, Owen, who scored Englands goal against Brazil in 2002, told reporters during preparations for Saturdays friendly against Argentina. Ive no fear of playing any top teams. 

Theyve got some cracking players and if you asked the world who were going to win it, theyd come top. But if we played against them we wouldnt fear them at all. Wed respect them and theyve got some of the best attacking players in the world. But weve got some of the best centre-halves in defence in the world. 

And if we can nullify their attacking players, Id always fancy us scoring a goal against them.

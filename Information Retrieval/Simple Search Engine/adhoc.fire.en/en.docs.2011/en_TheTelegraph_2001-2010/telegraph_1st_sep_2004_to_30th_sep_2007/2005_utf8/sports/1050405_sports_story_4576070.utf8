 Younis backing for Sourav

 - ?It?s just a matter of time before he gets back to form?

Visakhapatnam: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is ploughing a lonely furrow in a world he?s not used to live. 

Far from the sound of bat meeting the ball at the nets and fans crying in joy at the Port Sports complex Stadium on Monday morning, Sourav decided to go through the paces on his own. 

A little away from practising teammates, he was playing with a football, then did a bit of jogging before joining nets. 

Most of the players had, by then, preferred coolness under the umbrella in the hot and humid conditions here. 

The desperation to beat the demon within and get back into form was written all over his body. Soon after practice got over, Sourav got backing from vice-captains of both teams. 

Younis Khan, who himself faced similar problem in his career, felt that patience should be the key for Sourav. 

 ?Every player goes through such trauma... when you are desperate to do something, yet you meet with failure. 

?He?s such a great batsman and it?s just a matter of time before he gets back to form,? Younis said. 

Rahul Dravid, on the other hand, observed that the team as a whole had to lift the captain?s spirits. 

Denying that Sourav?s lack of form is putting the team under pressure, Dravid said: ?There are times when different people are in form and different people are out of form. The challenge for the team at this time is to carry the people and make sure the team gets the right result. 

?Each one has a role to play in this team and we all believe Sourav will get back among runs sooner than later. quot; 

Incidentally, this is not the first time Sourav has got the backing from his deputy. And it?s sure to inspire Sourav on Tuesday.

 IN THE CITY

 East Bengal?s British physical trainer Peter McKnight will be leaving the Maidan as he has opted out of a fresh offer by the red-and-golds and will go back to London instead.

 ?I did get a fresh offer from the club last week, but I am more interested in taking up a job in London. I have a few offers there too?, the physio clarified on Monday, adding ?I did enjoy my stint here though? Let?s see if I can come back later?. 

 The British trainer was supposed to have a six-week association with the club.

Rajkot: If anybody from Saurashtras premier city wishes to enjoy the Rahul Dravid glance, the connoisseur will have to head for the luxurious Imperial Palace hotel, whose coffee shop has named an oriental sandwich after that stroke, and not the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground. 

Thats because the Team India captain has chosen to take a break in match No. 6 of the Videocon Cup and Virender Sehwag is to lead for the first time at home. In fact, The Telegraph had to remind him hed already captained once ? versus Bangladesh, in Dhaka, soon after the 2003 World Cup. 

A temporary change at the top notwithstanding, coach Greg Chappell insisted the basic approach wouldnt change. 

Having lost the series (and slipped two places, to fourth, in the ICC rankings), the Sri Lankans are largely playing to restore some pride. And, of course, to at least end the tour on a high so that next months three-Test series doesnt see them start too far behind psychologically. 

However, even though Dravid isnt going to play, the lethal three are returning ? Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan. All got a break in Motera, a move which definitely helped Lanka open account. 

Set to make his first appearance in the seven-ODI series is Mohammed Kaif, who has had to sit out owing to a hamstring injury sustained during last months Challenger Trophy. Not being part of the action is tough for regulars and, so, hes mighty pleased at being back. 

Kaif acknowledged that fresh ideas and youngsters had made a difference. Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu (whose bizarre captaincy in the Pune match is still talked about) feels the quality of fielding has also played a part. 

The Indians have been far superior. 

Atapattu, incidentally, hasnt come to grips with the power play. The super sub and power plays have added to a captains headache. Even without them, one had so much to think about... Now... I suppose we havent adapted our game to the relatively new demands, he moaned. 

Surprisingly for a one-dayer ? that, too, at a centre which has only hosted eight such matches ? tickets remained unsold till late on Tuesday, not many hours before the first ball is bowled. That the series has been decided is a factor, as also the lack of big performers in the Lankan ranks. 

The Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) and the local administration, by the way, have taken measures to ensure theres no repeat of 2002. The last ODI, then (featuring India and the West Indies), was decided on the D/L Method following the hurling of missiles. 

Chasing 301, India were 200 for one when the West Indies decided enough was enough and Match Referee Mike Procter got into the act. 

 This time, youll find more security and an absolute ban on carrying anything inside barring cellphones and binoculars. Then, as a precaution, weve put nets in front of some stands, informed the energetic SCA secretary Niranjan Shah. 

Significantly, the commandos have been assigned from Gandhinagar. 

The wicket, as pointed out by Atapattu and Chappell, looks a belter. That cant be great news for somebody like Chaminda Vaas, who made his debut here in early 1994. Im confident I still have it in me to change the course of a match, he remarked. 

The Lankans are going to need Vaas best and much more if the scoreline is to look less discouraging. Theyre particularly hoping that veteran Sanath Jayasuriya ? who has been sorted out ? does come good both here and in Vadodara. 

Sanath can, at any moment, win us a game... He has the capability to do so single-handedly, Atapattu declared. Well, it costs nothing to pray and hope.

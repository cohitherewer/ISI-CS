 Bookies back Aussies 

Sydney: Local bookmakers here believe the Australians are strong favourites against England in this year?s Ashes series. 

While England have been given their best chance in years to win back the game?s time-honoured contest, bookmakers here do not see anything to change their view that it will be Ricky Ponting?s side who will take the honours once again this northern summer. 

Most of them have Australia at 2-1 on ? you have to bet two dollars to get one back ? to win the five-match Test series and wrap up a record ninth consecutive Ashes victory. 

England are rated around 3-1 against to end a losing streak dating back to 1989. 

?Betting against Australia is a very risky business,? Australia?s Centrebet spokesman Gerard Daffy said on Monday. 

?I think England are at their right price now. They keep wheeling out all these names that are going to rescue them and win the Ashes back but they?re blokes that have been playing for a long time anyway. 

?They?re obviously going to be competitive to some degree.? (AFP)

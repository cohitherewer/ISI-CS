 Railways set to bag trophy

 - Powar takes 7/116 for Rest 

 Chappell watches the Irani trophy match on Monday 

New Delhi: Ramesh Powars dogged bowling effort went in vain as the Rest of India made a meek surrender in the second innings and left Railways on the brink of victory in the Irani Trophy match on Monday. 

Off-spinner Powar claimed seven for 116, his second career-best performance in first-class cricket, to keep Rest in the hunt but the visitors disastrous batting in the second knock undid his good work. 

After Railways managed to put up 311, the last two wickets eking out 54 runs, for a handy lead of 88 in the first innings, the Rest capitulated to be all out for 137 at the Karnail Singh Stadium. 

Left-arm spinner Murali Kartik, who missed out on his maiden first-class hundred in the morning, picked three for 28 while offie Kulamani Parida grabbed three for 52, for a match haul of seven for 113. 

The Ranji Trophy champions now need to score only 50 runs to claim the coveted trophy their for second time in two seasons, having won it in 2003-04 at the same venue. 

With national coach Greg Chappell and national selection committee chairman Kiran More watching from the stands, the youngsters had all the reasons to put up their best display but they ended up marring their own reputation. 

Earlier, Kartik fell short of his maiden hundred by four runs when he holed out Powar to Ranadeb Bose at mid-off.

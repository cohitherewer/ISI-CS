The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Every city but 1 supported us

 - A step forward but a long way to go: Dravid 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Irfan Pathan who scalped three victims 

Mumbai: Rahul Dravid again sought an opportunity to hurl words of discontent to the Calcuttans, after Team India levelled the five-match one-day series against South Africa with a five-wicket win at the Wankhede on Monday. 

This young team has got support from every city in India, except one, he said at the post-match press conference. 

But the Indian captain didnt like to share his views with the media whether Mondays win was a befitting reply to the Calcuttans after their gesture at the Eden three days ago. 

Setting aide the setback in Calcutta, Dravid pointed out that that in the in the last two series, Indian cricket has taken a step forward. We have taken some step forward but there is a long way to go. We will try and keep improving, he said. 

It also says a lot about our fitness, playing 11 matches in a short time and winning eight of them. Not to mention the travelling. It (the win) is a tribute to the boys, he said. 

Answering a query, Dravid mentioned that they played badly at the Eden and the behaviour of the crowd was part and parcel of the competitive cricket. 

Dravid also heaped rich encomiums on Harbhajan Singh saying, he has bowled exceptionally well both against Sri Lanka and South Africans. 

Yuvraj Singh ? who shared the Ford car with Gaeme Smith on being adjudged joint men of the series ? also received praise from the captain. Both of them are exceptional fielders and one should take lesson from them to improve? though we have excelled in the department of fielding in last two series, Dravid remarked. 

Dravid was also surprised that dew, which had been a major factor in the previous three games, did not play a role on Monday. 

Toss was important but it did not make that much of a difference because there was no dew at all, he said. 

For Dravid, its back to the beginning when Team India will take on Sri Lanka in the three-match Test series starting in Chennai on Friday. 

South Africa captain Smith skipped the media conference, which was attended by Jacques Kallis instead. Kallis felt that South Africa needed another 20 runs more on the board to put up good fight against the hosts. 

Asked whether he was upset on missing his 14th ODI century, Kallis replied in the negative. My hundred was not important, it was the team which came first, Kallis said. 

Last but not the least, MoS Yuvraj looked very happy bagging the award. I enjoyed playing and taking the pressure, but I always tried to hit the ball straight, which ultimately paid dividends, he signed off.

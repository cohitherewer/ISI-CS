 Bhutia sure of crowd support

Karachi: Three-time winners India arrived here on Tuesday to participate in the eight-nation SAFF Cup football championship that kicks off on Wednesday. 

Led by Bhaichung Bhutia, the Indians will take on Nepal on the second day of the competition on Thursday. 

Bhutia said his team had prepared hard for the tournament and he was confident of crowd support during the competition. 

Even against Pakistan, I am confident the crowd will back us and I am saying this because during the Indian cricket teams tour to Pakistan last year, the spectators were appreciative of good play, the East Bengal striker said. 

Bhutia refused to predict a winner saying, we have done everything right and now its for us to deliver. But every team here has come with an aim to win the trophy. 

Pakistan will have an edge for two reasons. First, because they are the local favourites and secondly because they beat us earlier this year. Nevertheless, it is not going to be easy for them and they will have to play out of their skins. (PTI)

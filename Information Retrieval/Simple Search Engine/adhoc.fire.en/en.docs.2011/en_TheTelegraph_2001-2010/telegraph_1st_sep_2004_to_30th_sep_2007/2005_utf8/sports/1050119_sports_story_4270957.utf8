 Exclusive Affair canters home 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Exclusive Affair returned to winning 

ways, cantering home with the 2,200m Pearson Surita Memorial Cup at the RCTC on 

Tuesday. C. Alford partnered the Vijay Singh-trainee who had placed fourth in 

the Derby nine days ago. 

 The trainer-jockey combination, however, did not click in the juvenile race after Alford failed to inspire favourite, Aptitude, to jump out with the field in the 1,100m Irma La Douce Plate. 

 Daniel David?s Star Stature won the race but the trainer lost the services of his main jockey, apprentice Gajender Singh. In that race, Gajender was unseated from his ride Sailing Home who was making her debut. The filly veered in sharply soon after the start and also crashed into the rails, dislodging Gajender who was injured.

 Narains woes continue

Monza: Narain Karthikeyan continued struggling while teammate Tiago Monteiro enjoyed a problem-free drive in the new Jordan-Toyota EJB15 in the practice sessions ahead of the Italian Grand Prix on Friday. 

Karthikeyan suffered a puncture in the first practice, managing to finish 15th, but was relegated to 21st in the second practice. 

Monteiro, who got the chance to drive the new car ahead of 28-year-old Indian, was 12th and 20th, respectively in the two sessions. 

Ferraris Michael Schumacher crashed into a tyre wall while title contenders McLaren made a quick start to their preparations. 

Test driver Pedro de la Rosa was fastest by more than a second and a half in first practice. McLaren filled three of the top four places in an afternoon session topped by Toyotas test driver Ricardo Zonta. 

De la Rosas morning time of one minute 20.201 seconds was the days, well inside the race lap record set by Ferraris Brazilian Rubens Barrichello last year. Zonta lapped later in 1:20.531.

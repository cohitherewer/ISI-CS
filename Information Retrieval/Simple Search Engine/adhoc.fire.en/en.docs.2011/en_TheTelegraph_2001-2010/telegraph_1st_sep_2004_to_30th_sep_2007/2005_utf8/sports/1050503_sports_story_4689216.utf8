 Warne may quit after home Ashes 

 Warne wants to spend more time with his family 

 Sydney: Shane Warne could retire after the 2006-2007 Ashes series in Australia to spend more time with his family, his brother and manager Jason said. ?The Ashes in 2006-07 could be Shane?s last series,? Jason Warne said in an interview to a Sydney paper. ?He?s mentioned that during talks we?ve had about when he might retire. He?s still really enjoying Test cricket but that is a date he?s talked about. If he didn?t have kids, he might play forever, but he misses them a lot these days.? 

Jason said his brother was also toying with the idea of making a comeback in ODIs to play the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. 

 Warne will go into next month?s Ashes series in England 

 with a world-record 583 Test wickets. Retirement in 2006-2007 

 would enable Warne to play his last two Tests at his favourite 

 MCG and SCG venues.

 Faisalabad champions 

 Lahore: Faisalabad Wolves held their nerves 

 to defeat Karachi Dolphins by two wickets and win Pakistan?s 

 inaugural Twenty20 Cup at the packed Gaddafi Stadium. Faisalabad, 

 chasing 159 for victory, limped home with a ball and two 

 wickets to spare after Karachi put down half a dozen catches. 

 Marion wins 100m 

 London: American sprinter Marion Jones won her first 100m race of the season on the Caribbean island of Martinique on Saturday. Winner of five Olympic medals at the 2000 Olympics but none in Athens last year, she clocked 11.28 seconds in her first competitive outing over the distance for 11 months. Jones, who has been linked to the BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative) doping scandal, failed to shine in two longer races earlier this season. 

 Jones? boyfriend, world record-holder Tim Montgomery, 

 also competed over 100m in Martinique but could manage only 

 fourth place.

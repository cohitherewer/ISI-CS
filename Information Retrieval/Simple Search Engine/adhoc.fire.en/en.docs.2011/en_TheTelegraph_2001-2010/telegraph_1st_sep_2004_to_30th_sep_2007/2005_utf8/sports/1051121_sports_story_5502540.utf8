 Same India XI in Chennai

Chennai: Team India captain Rahul Dravid said the same XI, that brought off a superb victory over South Africa in Bangalore, will be retained for the third ODI against the visitors here on Tuesday. 

Dravid, who arrived here along with Harbhajan Singh on Sunday evening from Bangalore, said that the same combination that helped India draw level 1-1 (in the five match series) will play but any changes in the batting order will be decided on the day of the match. 

The teams morale is high and we will try and do our best to take the lead in Chennai, he said. 

South Africa, on the other hand, would look to score at least 300 provided they batted first on Tuesday as anything less than that might not be enough for a win against India. 

South African coach Micky Arthur also said toss would be a crucial factor in the third match. Toss will be crucial due to the dew factor. We will bat first, if we win the toss. A total of around 300 will be the goal to achieve a win here on Tuesday, the coach said. 

On the team composition and strategy, he said the team will be decided after seeing the conditions on Tuesday morning. (PTI)

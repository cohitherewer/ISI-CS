 Kochi waiting to become Test venue

Kochi: Now that the first Indo-Pak ODI has been successfully held here, the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) wants this to be a Test venue as well. For this, though, they want the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on a long lease from its present owners, the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA). 

KCA secretary S. Haridas said it would not be possible to get approval from the BCCI for holding Test matches if the stadium was given for two or three months. He needs the stadium on long lease. ?If the project works, then we will have to lay ?pucca? wicket and improve facilities at the media centre, dressing rooms and pavilion,? he said. (PTI)

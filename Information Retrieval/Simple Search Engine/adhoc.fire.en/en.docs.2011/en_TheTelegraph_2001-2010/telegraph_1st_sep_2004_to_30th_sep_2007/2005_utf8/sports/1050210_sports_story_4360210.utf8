 Salgaocar allege breach of trust 

Margao: Brazilian striker Marcos Pereira, who is currently playing on loan for Churchill Brothers, had allegedly resorted to unfair methods to swap clubs during this season and underwent selection trials in Vietnam, Salgaocar Sports Club secretary Henry Britto said. 

?Marcos quit Salgaocar jand left Goa saying that he wants to return to Brazil. But instead he appeared for trials in a Vietnam club, despite the fact that Marcos had a contractual commitment with Salgaocar till April 30, 2006,? Britto claimed in a release here on Wednesday.

 England deserve to win: Marsh 

Dubai: England have been playing much more positive cricket and thoroughly deserve to win the Ashes series, according to former Australia wicketkeeper Rodney Marsh. 

They should have been 3-1 up going into the final Test but the pressure of winning the Ashes after a long time is causing them grief, Marsh said after being appointed director of coaching at the first International Cricket Council Global Academy on Wednesday. 

England won the second Test by only two runs but I thought they should have won a lot easier than they did, Marsh said. 

They had the Australians on the ropes the whole Test match at Old Trafford but dropped some catches which did not help matters. 

I think its all due to the pressure of winning the Ashes, Marsh said. They know they have been struggling over the line, but now they are more positive in their approach and have been playing some positive cricket and learning the mind games well as well.

Calcutta: The shock defeat of Dempo Sports Club to their Goan rivals Fransa Pax have given holders East Bengal an early lead in the ninth National Football League for ONGC Cup. 

A win in their seventh round encounter against Salgaocar Sports Club on Saturday will further boost their tally, which is currently at 14 points. 

Salgaocar, meanwhile, have seven points from six matches and are lying in seventh position. 

However, despite the difference, the match will not be any cakewalk, feels Bhaichung Bhutia. ?We will have to work hard to win,? was all he said. As for coach Subhas Bhowmick, he has a problem of plenty. With the players all fit (except defender Dipak Mondal) and in fine form, it?s hard to select the final XI. 

Brazilian striker Juliano Martins? inclusion has definitely bolstered the side?s attack and getting a goal for the red-and-golds on debut against JCT in the last encounter is bound to have a positive effect. 

He is expected to partner Bhaichung upfront in an almost unchanged team from that which played the last match. 

The coach feels that Saturday?s match will be a tough one as the Goan side is very organised. 

Salgaocar coach Savio Madeira, on the other hand, will be content with a point. ?We have a rather new team. East Bengal are a very good side and we will look to give them a fight,? he acknowledged. 

?The National League now is a two-way race (between East Bengal and Dempo) but we will try to stay in contention.?

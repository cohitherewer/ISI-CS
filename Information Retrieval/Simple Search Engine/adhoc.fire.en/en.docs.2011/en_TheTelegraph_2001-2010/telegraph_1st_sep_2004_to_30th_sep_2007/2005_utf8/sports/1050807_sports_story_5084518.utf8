 8 players share lead

 Negi returns to winning ways 

New Delhi: A last moment slip-up by Grandmaster R.B. Ramesh forced him to share the point with K. Rathnakaran of Kerala in the fifth round of National B Chess Tournament here on Saturday. 

Top seed Ramesh played a Closed Sicilian opening with black pieces and got the advantage of being a pawn up in the endgame. However under time pressure, he made seven moves in two minutes. In haste, he blundered and sacrificed his pawn eventually to draw the game in 46 moves. 

IM T.S Ravi lost to Vikas Sharma of Punjab and Bengals WGM Nisha Mohota suffered her second defeat in the tournament. Parimarjan Negi also bounced back to his winning ways as he defeated Manthan Chowkshi. 

Third seed IM B.S. Sivanandan also suffered defeat. On a day when draw was the order on the top boards, IM Sivanandan was the only player to suffer defeat, going down to Diwakar Prasad who jumped into the lead, being shared by seven others. 

Of the top 10, nine boards saw players settle for draw, leaving eight players in joint lead on 4.5 points apiece. 

Besides Diwakar, the others in lead are R.K. Kamble, IMs P Konguvel, R.R. Laxman, Deep Sengupta, Dronavalli Harika and Valay Parikh. 

The leaders were followed by a pack of 31 in second position on four points. Top 14 players will qualify for the National A Championship. 

On the other board, IM Laxman signed the peace pact with Harika in a Sicilian Rosalimo opening in 56 moves after he tried hard to capitalise on his better position with white, but in vain. 

IM T.S. Ravi suffered his second loss to lower ranked Vikas Sharma. Ravi and Sharma maintained equal positions till the middle game after the latter employed Nimzo Indian opening with white. 

But Ravi, who had lost on time in the first round, again came under time pressure and committed the mistake of sacrificing a pawn in the 38th move in the endgame which was anyway in favour of white. The game finished in 49 moves. 

N Sanjay of Bangalore, playing Slav Defence with white, signed a quick pact with Arghyadip Das in 19 moves.

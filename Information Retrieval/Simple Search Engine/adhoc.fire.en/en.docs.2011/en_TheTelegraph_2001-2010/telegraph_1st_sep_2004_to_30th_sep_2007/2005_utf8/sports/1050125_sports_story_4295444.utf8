 Bichel steers World XI home

 - 2nd charity one-dayer 

 World XI?s Andy Bichel celebrates the dismissal of Brendon McCullum in Wellington on Monday 

Wellington: Australian Andy Bichel captured three wickets and hit an unbeaten 37 to help a World XI beat New Zealand by three wickets in their second tsunami fund-raising match on Monday. 

The Black Caps, who won Saturday?s opening match by nine wickets, made 256 for nine from their 50 overs with opener Nathan Astle blazing 109 and allrounder Craig McMillan chipping in with 33. 

Former Australian Test opener Matthew Elliott gave the World XI a flying start to their reply with 57. Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara kept the innings ticking along with 51 before Bichel steered them home. 

Astle?s century will not count on his record because the charity matches did not have official status. The Kiwi opener said he was not worried. 

?It?s always nice to get hundreds for New Zealand. It was a big game out there even though we didn?t do as well as we wanted to,? he said. 

?We played pretty well, got off to a good start and managed to pin them back to a reasonable total,? Bichel said. 

The three-match series was organised to raise funds for victims of the Asian tsunamai and to fill a scheduling hole after Sri Lanka?s tour of New Zealand was postponed. 

Organisers said they hoped to raise NZ$1 million. The series decider will be played in Hamilton on Wednesday. 

BRIEF SCORES: New Zealand 256/9 in 50 ovs (N. Astle 109, C. McMillan 33). World XI 257/7 in 47.5 (M. Elliott 57, K. Sangakkara 51, A. Bichel 37 n.o.). World XI won by 3 wkts.

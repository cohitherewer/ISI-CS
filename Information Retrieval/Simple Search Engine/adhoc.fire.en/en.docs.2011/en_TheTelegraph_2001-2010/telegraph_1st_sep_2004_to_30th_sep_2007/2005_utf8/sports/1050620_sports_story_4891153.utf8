 Goosen showing his signature fortitude

 - US OPEN - Gore, Browne in close pursuit 

CHRIS DUFRESNE

Pinehurst: The 105th US Open has become a numbers game, almost all of them black. There were nine players under par after the first round, five after the second, and now there is one. 

Retief Goosen, two-time winner of this event, left Pinehurst No. 2 on Saturday as the 54-hole leader (briefly reported in Sundays Late City Edition) and is the lone player under par entering Sundays final round. 

Goosen shot one-under 69 on Saturday and is at three-under 207 overall, exhibiting what is becoming his signature fortitude on fast US Open tracks ? closing with three birdies on his last five holes after stumbling to even par with a double bogey on the par-four 13th. 

Joining Goosen in the final group, at even-par 210, is another G man, Jason Gore. 

Contrary to what seemed basic, betting mans logic, Gore did not shrivel under the pressure and go belly and/or bogey up. 

Rather, the former Pepperdine star and junior circuit journeyman shot two-over 72 and is three shots behind Goosen, tied with Olin Browne. Gore closed with a birdie putt at 18, then followed his ball toward the hole and, a la Tiger Woods, punctuated the drop-in with a finger wag. 

Michael Campbell and Mark Hensby are four shots behind Goosen at 211. TigerWoods had an exasperating day, his 72 framed with heaves and sighs and a lot of missed putts (he needed 36 to complete his round). 

Incredibly, perhaps, Woods is at 213 and only six shots off the lead despite ranking 83rd ? dead last ? in putting. 

Im one good round away from winning this championship; thats the way you have to approach it, he said. 

Other third-round surprises included: 

Peter Jacobsen, 51, making a hole in one on the ninth hole and shooting one-under 69, leaving him at 214 and seven shots behind Goosen. 

Phil Mickelson shooting himself out of contention with a triple-bogey on the par-five fourth, the easiest hole, statistically, on the course. Mickelson made 16 pars and one birdie in a round of 72 and is tied for 35th at eight-over 218. 

Sergio Garcia, in the mix at even-par through 36 holes, shooting five-over 75. 

Vijai Singh, the worlds second-ranked player, following two rounds of 70 with a four-over 74. 

The biggest surprise, of course, continues to be Gore, a sectional qualifier with a substantial midsection. 

Get this: When Goosen made his double at No. 13, Gore held the outright lead at a US Open ? an almost preposterous thought for the 31-year-old unknown who lives in Valencia, California. 

Gores lead lasted six minutes, however, as he doubled the par-four 14th. At that moment, there were no golfers left under par, which warranted a figurative cap tip to a course that has progressively, and predictably, gotten tougher as the week has worn on. 

Goosens three-under 207 is the highest 54-hole total at a US Open since Payne Stewart was one-under 209 at Pinehurst in 1999. 

On a day when showers never came, meaning the course never softened, the black numbers on the scoreboard ate up the reds, leaving a Sunday of endless challenges and possibilities. 

Its amazing, for instance, to think Jason Gore is three shots ahead of Woods. 

Jason is a great guy, Woods said. We go back to junior golf in our little peewee leagues in southern California.

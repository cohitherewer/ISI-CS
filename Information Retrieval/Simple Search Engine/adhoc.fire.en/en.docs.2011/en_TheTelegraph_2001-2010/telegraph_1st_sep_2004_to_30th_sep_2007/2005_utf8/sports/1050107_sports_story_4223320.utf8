London: Struggling Southampton battled out a 3-3 draw at home to Fulham in a Premier League clash on Wednesday. 

The result leaves Southampton, now winless in their last nine games, 19th in the 20-strong league and prime relegation candidates. Fulham rose a place to 15th. 

Former England midfielder Jamie Redknapp made his debut for Southampton after signing on Tuesday from Tottenham for the club now managed by his father Harry. 

Redknapp helped set up the first Southampton goal and was unlucky not to be awarded a free-kick when fouled near the halfway line on 50 minutes. 

Instead, play was waved on and Tomasz Radzinski struck to put Fulham 3-2 up. 

But the Saints salvaged a point, and their fourth consecutive home draw, 19 minutes from time when under-pressure Liam Rosenior sliced an own goal. 

 On Thursday Parma and Juventus fans were involved in violent 

 clashes in Milan after a 1-1 draw. With most of the crowd 

 having left the stadium, a group of Parma fans entered the 

 field through an open gate and began taunting visiting Juve 

 fans who broke out of their sector and began to fight. Police 

 were heavily outnumbered and struggled to restore order. 

 There was no immediate report of injuries or arrests.

 Fulham had gone ahead in the 20th 

 minute when Papa Bouba Diop rose to meet a corner, but Southampton 

 hit back swiftly with well-taken goals from striker Kevin 

 Phillips on 21 and 29 minutes. 

Fulham made it 2-2 just before halftime as Steed Malbranque took advantage of poor Southampton defending from a corner. 

In Spain, Real Madrid coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo?s decision to treat his first seven minutes in charge as seriously as possible paid dividends in Wednesday?s 2-1 defeat of Real Sociedad. 

The two sides were forced to return to complete the league match after a bomb threat caused their December 12 game to be abandoned at 1-1, with only minutes to play. 

?I made all the preparations I could in order to achieve the win I had dreamt of,? said Luxemburgo, who was brought in for Mariano Garcia Remon last week. 

?I knew we could win because football is capable of springing the greatest of surprises.? Real came out with all guns blazing against Sociedad, who appeared to be suffering from stage fright. 

Brazil international Ronaldo supplied the individual magic that led to Real?s goal by gathering a long ball from Guti and performing a couple of step-overs before being felled by a desperate Mikel Labaka in the area. 

Zinedine Zidane provided the finishing touch with a perfectly-executed penalty, restoring Real?s self-belief at a stroke. ?Winning a game in just six minutes is something that could only happen at Real Madrid,? said fullback Roberto Carlos. ?It was the sort of game you want to record on video and show to your children to say ?that?s how you play football?. 

 ?For Real Madrid nothing is impossible and we can 

 still win everything this season.? The result pushed Real 

 up to third in the table, level on points with Valencia 

 and 10 behind Barcelona. (Reuters)

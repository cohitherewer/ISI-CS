Indianapolis: Indias Narain Karthikeyan concentrated on finding a consistent chassis balance on his car in the two free practice sessions at the US Grand Prix here Friday. 

The 28-year-old, who finished 19th in the first practice session, bettered his timings in the second but was still pushed to 22nd spot behind the teams test driver Robert Doornbos, who finished 18th. 

The two drivers along with Tiago Montiero of Portugal, who finished 23rd in the second qualifying, also made the usual Bridgestone tyre evaluation and comparison. The team collected a useful amount of data, and looks forward to making further progress. 

Mclarens Juan Pablo Montaya and Kimi Raikkonen took the top two spots in both practice sessions with Ferraris Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher following. 

Karthikeyan was satisfied with his last nights performance and said the emphasis would now be on improving the traction of the car before the qualifying. 

The track is quite straightforward and not too hard to learn. What is really crucial here is to position the car well for the fast corners. The emphasis is on traction so we will try to improve the car. 

Otherwise, I am relatively satisfied with these two practice sessions and I am looking forward to the qualifying. 

Jordan sporting director Adrian Burgess said now the team would have to take a careful decision about the choice of the tyres for the race and get more from the car over the weekend. 

All three drivers got used to a new track here at Indianapolis without too much trouble. Besides, we are happy with the fuel load we have been carrying, Burgess said. 

Now we have to sit down and make a careful decision about our tyre choice for the weekend and analyse the useful information we have been collecting to get more from the car and the rest of the package for the qualifying and for Sunday. (Agencies)

 Will do my best with what I have

 Karthikeyan is confident of doing well on his favourite circuit 

Monza: Though Narain Karthikeyan will not be driving the new Jordan EJ15B at this weekends Italian Grand Prix, the Indian is confident of doing well with his regular car on his favourite circuit. 

It is a pity I lost the toss and cannot drive the new car at Monza, but I will do my best with what I have. I like Monza a lot and I hope to do well, Karthikeyan said. 

Team Jordan go to the Italian GP after a three-day test at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza with all four drivers ? Karthikeyan, Tiago Monteiro, Nicolas Kiesa and Nicky Pastorelli. Monteiro will have the privilege of driving the new car that will make its debut on Sunday. 

About the teams testing with the new car, the 28-year-old Karthikeyan said the team drove almost 1400km with the EJ15B on one of the oldest and fastest Formula One tracks. 

The test with the EJ15B at Monza last week went reasonably well. I think we have closed the gap with the bigger teams and this is very encouraging. However, I cannot quantify it much more until we all sit together and discuss it, he said. 

Jordan sporting director Adrian Burgess said that the drivers had already acclimatised to the high-speed tracks here and would be concentrating on fine-tuning their cars in the practise sessions. 

We had a good test last week, adding more mileage to the EJ15B. The cooling problems we experienced before have now been fixed. For the race, we will be running with low down force settings, which require different techniques, set-ups and aero package, Karthikeyan said. 

The fact that the drivers have all been driving here a week before the race means that on the weekend we can concentrate on fine-tuning the car rather than the drivers spending time acclimatising, he said. 

Monteiro, Karthikeyans Portugal teammate, said it would be a challenge to drive the new car on the tricky track. (PTI)

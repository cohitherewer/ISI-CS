 Focus on Sachin in Hyderabad

Hyderabad: The spotlight will be on Sachin Tendulkar when West Zone take on Rahul Dravid led-South Zone in a Duleep Trophy league match starting here on Tuesday. 

With the series against Pakistan barely a few days away, the match provides a perfect opportunity for the Team India players to test themselves in a match situation. 

The match has been generating considerable interest as it will mark the return of Tendulkar, Irfan Pathan and Ajit Agarkar to action after the trio missed their zone?s first match. 

?This is a major opportunity for the youngsters and a big practice match for us ahead of the big series. This is a first class match and we can?t take it easy. Youngsters have to make the best use of the match,? Tendulkar, who would be leading his side, said. 

South look good enough to challenge West with depth in batting and boasting of good and experienced bowlers as they boast of having V.V.S. Laxman, Anil Kumble and Lakshmipathy Balaji, apart from Dravid. 

The West wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel will also be eager to impress the selectors for a comeback to the national squad. 

The match would be keenly watched by Team India coach John Wright and physio John Gloster, who would assess players? performance and fitness.

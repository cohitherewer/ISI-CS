 Kemp included in Test squad 

Durban: Justin Kemps explosive batting in one-day Internationals has earned him a place in South Africas Test squad for next months tour of Australia. 

Kemp has also been granted a contract by the cricket authorities in the country for his outstanding performances recently. 

The 28-year-old allrounder played the last of his three Tests against the West Indies in Jamaica in April 2001. His international career stalled after he admitted to smoking cannabis on that tour. 

Kemp forced his way back into the limelight last season when he scored 80 off 50 balls in East London to help South Africa clinch the one-day series against England. 

He was also in impressive form during South Africas successful one-day series against New Zealand. Kemp scored 73 runs off 64 balls in one match against the Black Caps, and 30 off 19 balls in another. 

Uncapped fast bowler Garnett Kruger, 28, won a place at the expense of Monde Zondeki. 

THE SQUAD 

Graeme Smith (captain), Nicky Boje, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Justin Kemp, Garnett Kruger, Charl Langeveldt, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Ashwell Prince, Jacques Rudolph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Shers triumph

Hyderabad: Sher-e-Jalandhar edged past Maratha Warriors 3-0 via tie-breaker in a Tier I match of the Premier Hockey League (PHL) on Saturday. 

After both teams failed to score in the regulation time and the extra time, Prabhdep Singh, Didar Singh and Gagan Ajit Singh found the net in the penalty shootout while Raza Ali, Vijay Alfanso and Kashif Jawed bungled at the hour of reckoning for Maratha Warriors. As the match went to the extra time, the teams fielded nine players in the first half of the extra time and seven in the second half as per the rule of the tournament. 

Earlier in Tier II matches, Chandigarh Dynamos continued their winning streak with a 2-0 win over Lucknow Nawabs while Delhi Dazzlers beat Bengal Tigers 3-1 for their fourth win in the competition. (PTI)

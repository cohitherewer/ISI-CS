The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan draw, stay in relegation fear

 - NFL Dempo edge past Fransa 

 Prakash scored Dempo?s 2nd goal 

Ludhiana: Former champions Mohun Bagan failed to get themselves out of the relegation zone, held goalless by JCT Mills in the 20th round of the ninth National Football League for the ONGC Cup here Saturday. 

The draw took the Calcutta outfit?s tally to 19 points, placed 10th in the 12-team league. Four teams will be relegated. JCT took their tally to 27 points and are placed sixth in the standings. 

Meanwhile, in Margao, Dempo survived a scare in the dying minutes, to edge past Fransa Pax 2-1 and keep themselves in contention for the title. Dempo took the lead in the 20th minute when Clifford Miranda uncorked a fierce carpet drive that found the far post. 

R. C. Prakash, Ranty Martins and Miranda combined well upfront as they harried the rival defence and Fransa ?keeper Kalyan Chowbey had to make saves off Prakash?s attempt twice at goalmouth and once from Riston Rodrigues. Prakash managed to increase the lead in the dying minutes of the first half when he tapped home a low cross from Martins. 

Fransa pulled one back in the dying minutes when substitute Biju Kumar scored off a cross by Benjamin Ansa. With the win Dempo moved to second spot behind Sporting Clube de Goa with 41 points from 19 matches, while Fransa remained in fifth place with 29 points from 20 matches. 

Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers Saturday threatened to go to the court if the AIFF remains firm on its decision to relegate the last four teams of the NFL. ?The decision to demote last four teams was contrary to the AFC decision to have more than 12 teams in the NFL. If AIFF remains firm we will go to the court irrespective of our relegation or not,? Churchill Brothers patron Churchill Alemao said. (PTI)

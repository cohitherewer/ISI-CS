 Punjab Police to appeal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Punjab Police will appeal to the IHF against the bans imposed on Gagan Ajit Singh (three months) and Daljit Singh Dhillon (six months), but not the two-year suspension on Kanwalpreet Singh. Gagan Ajit and Dhillon were punished for assaulting Indian Oil?s Vikramjit Singh during the national championship in Hyderabad recently, while Kanwalpreet was pulled up for hitting Deepak Thakur in a Delhi meet earlier. 

A Punjab Police official explained: ?We won?t fight the ban on Kanwalpreet as we feel his suspension is justified. We?ll be sending the (appeal) letter to the IHF after returning from this meet.?

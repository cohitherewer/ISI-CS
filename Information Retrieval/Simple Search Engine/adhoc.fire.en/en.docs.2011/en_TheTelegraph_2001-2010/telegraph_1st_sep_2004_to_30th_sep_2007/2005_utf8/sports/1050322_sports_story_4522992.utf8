Mumbai: Pankaj Dharmani played the sheet anchor role to perfection and guided Punjab to a three-wicket victory over holders Mumbai to reach the Ranji Trophy elite division final on Monday. 

Dharmani, who top scored in the visitors? meagre first innings tally of 126 with a stubborn 32, was once again the hero as he held the lower order together to remain unconquered with a superb 86 off 237 balls. 

It was the Punjab wicketkeeper who hit the winning runs in the first over after lunch on the fourth and penultimate day of the semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium.

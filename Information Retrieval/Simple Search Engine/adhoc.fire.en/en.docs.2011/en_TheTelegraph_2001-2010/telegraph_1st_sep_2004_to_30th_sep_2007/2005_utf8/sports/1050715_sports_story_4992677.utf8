 Suspension slapped on Shabbir

 21-day ICC wait period has expired for Shabbir 

Islamabad: Pakistan pace bowler Shabbir Ahmed has been suspended from bowling because of problems with his action, Pakistan cricket authorities said on Thursday. 

The 29-year olds bowling action was reported for the third time since 1999 during the first Test in the West Indies in May. 

The tests carried out on Shabbirs bowling action in England show that flexion of his bowling arm is above the International Cricket Council (ICC) tolerance level of 15 degrees, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director of operations Saleem Altaf said. 

Since the 21-day period allowed by the ICC to analyse his action and correct it and send them a report for clearance has passed, he cant bowl now, he added. 

Shabbir cannot bowl again until the ICCs bowling action review committee clears his corrected action, Altaf said, adding the Pakistan board would soon start work on it. 

We are consulting biomechanic specialists and other experts now and will decide on a future course of action after taking advice from them, Altaf stated. 

Ahmed was sent to England shortly after the West Indies tour to undergo tests under an ICC-appointed biomechanic expert. 

Pakistans fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and all-rounder Shoaib Malik have also been reported for suspect actions in recent times. 

We are very concerned with this trend of our bowlers being reported for suspect actions. It is disturbing and we have to look at our domestic cricket for remedial measures. 

Shabbir has taken 46 Test and 33 ODI wickets.

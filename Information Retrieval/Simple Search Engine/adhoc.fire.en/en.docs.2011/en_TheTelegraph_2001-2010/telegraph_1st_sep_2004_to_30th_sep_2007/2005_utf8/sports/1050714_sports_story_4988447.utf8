 Silver Storm wins in Mysore 

 TITAN BOY

 Jockey A.Velu had a virtual armchair ride on the J.S. Pillay-trained horse Silver Storm in the upper division of the Indraprastha Cup at the Mysore races held on Wednesday. 

 The lower division of the trophy, on the other hand, produced a sizzler between the B. Salvi-favourite Zaran and a less fancied Super Chieftan. However, jockey K.P. Appus superior handling proved decisive at the all-important end with Zaran just about managing to deliver the goods.

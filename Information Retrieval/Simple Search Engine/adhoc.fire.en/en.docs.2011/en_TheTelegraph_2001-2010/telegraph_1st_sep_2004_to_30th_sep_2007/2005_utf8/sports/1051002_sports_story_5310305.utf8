 Anjum brace in Indian win

New Delhi: Saba Anjums brace helped a rusty Indian side edge past a fighting Malaysia 2-1 in the opening match of the Indira Gandhi Gold Cup hockey tournament for women on Saturday. 

It was a game of lost opportunities for India as they converted only one of eight penalty corners and also wasted a penalty stroke. The hosts were also disorganised in their attack and many a scoring opportunity went abegging as they fumbled in front of the goalmouth. 

Malaysia, showed some good defensive technique to thwart Indian the penalty corners. India showed much promise at the start and made some fine moves in the first 15 minutes of the match. 

Anjum scored her first goal in the sixth minute as the Malaysian defence fumbled. She trapped the ball right in front of the net to send it past the goalkeeper. 

The Malaysians went on the offensive after India wasted a penalty corner. But captain Helen Mary made a brilliant save coming forward and disturbing the rhythm of the Malaysian forwards. 

After Malaysian captain Norfaraha Hashim levelled the score through a penalty corner in the 22nd minute, Anjum put the team ahead again in the 24th, converting Indias fourth penalty corner.

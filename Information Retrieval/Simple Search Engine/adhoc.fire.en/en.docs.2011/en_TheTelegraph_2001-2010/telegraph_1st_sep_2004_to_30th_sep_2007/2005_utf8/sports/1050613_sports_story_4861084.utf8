Quetta: Pakistan held India 1-1 in the first of the three-match soccer series at Quettas Ayub Stadium on Sunday. The hosts also wasted a penalty. 

After a dull and aimless first half, in which neither side managed any degree of ball-possession, India broke the ice in the 65th minute when striker Sunil Chhetri put the visitors in front. Strangely, Chhetri was replaced soon after. 

Pakistan who, until India found the target, appeared keen to play for a goalless draw, increased the momentum in search of the equaliser. That came 12 minutes before the final whistle when Mohammad Essas booming 40-yard free-kick lodged in the back of the netting. 

The second match of this historic series will be played in Peshawar on June 16. The series concludes on June 18 in Lahore. 

India captain Shanmugam Venkatesh was left to rue missed opportunities. We missed a couple of scoring opportunities, but I am overall satisfied with the way we played. 

The full house of 20,000 had to wait for 30 minutes before India created the first scoring opportunity. Nevertheless, after a scramble in the penalty area, Chhetris feeble shot didnt test Pakistan goalkeeper Mohammad Jaffar. Two minutes later Venkateshs long-range shot sailed over the bar. (PTI)

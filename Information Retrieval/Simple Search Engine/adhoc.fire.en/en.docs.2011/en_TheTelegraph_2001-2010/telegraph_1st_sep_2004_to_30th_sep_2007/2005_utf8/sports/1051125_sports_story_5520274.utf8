 Mumbai post 551

New Delhi: Mumbai banked on the good work from Wasim Jaffer and Amol Muzumdar to pile a mammoth 551 in their first innings against Delhi on the Day II of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A tie at the Kotla on Wednesday. 

Delhi made a cautious start and both the openers Aakash Chopra (16 . .) and Varun Kumar (12 . .) were at the crease with the team total reading 40 for no loss when play was stopped due to bad light. 

Meanwhile, in another group A match in New Delhi, Shreyas Khanolkars gritty half century kept defending champions Railways on track against Karnataka. 

Middle order batsman Khanolkar made a sedate 81 from 205 balls to lift his side to 323 on the second day at the Karnail Singh Stadium. Khanolkar shared a 106-run stand with G. Shankar Rao who made a relatively quick 40 with four fours and a six. 

In reply, Karnataka were 134 for three at stumps.

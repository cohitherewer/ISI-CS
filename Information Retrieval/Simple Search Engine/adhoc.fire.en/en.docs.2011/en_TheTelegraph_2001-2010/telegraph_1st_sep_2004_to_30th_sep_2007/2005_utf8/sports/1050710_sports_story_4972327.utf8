 Star seeks revenge 

The pros speak... 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: There are three 

 fillies in the 11-horse line-up for the 2,000m Kingfisher 

 Derby Bangalore, the blue riband of the season here on Sunday, 

 but the contest is expected to be confined among the masculine 

 power. 

 The domination of colts and gelding in this brand of Classic is, however, a known fact. Therefore, the Derby may again see a straight contest between the 1,600m Colts Trial Stakes winner Holding Court and Flashing Star who lost the shorter Classic by a whisker.

 The two horses run in contrasting styles. If Holding Court relishes early advantage, Flashing Star boasts of a strong finishing prowess when the race takes a serious turn. Although Holding Courts trainer S. Padmanabhan is confident that the Royal Kingdom-Confiture colt will be equally at ease when ridden off the pace, the rival schooler, S. Ganapathy, is banking heavily upon his wards bloodlines ? Razeen out of Altitude ? which suggests stamina is Flashing Stars forte. Ganapathy also hinted that his other trainee, Amazing Striker, is no pushover. The Steinbeck-Santorini Star colt was a good third in the Colts and was the fastest moving horse in the last furlong of the race. The Derby trip is likely to favour him most.

 All three horses are maintaining good form but the one to beat will be B. Prakashs ride Flashing Star who is out to avenge Colts defeat.

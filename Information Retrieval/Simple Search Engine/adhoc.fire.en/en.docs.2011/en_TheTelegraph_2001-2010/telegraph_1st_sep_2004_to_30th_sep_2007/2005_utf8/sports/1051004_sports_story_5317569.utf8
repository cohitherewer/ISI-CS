Calcutta: Senior national football team coach Syed Nayeemuddin is a man in hurry. 

A day after being appointed, the Dronacharya of Indian football plans to select a pool of 35 hopefuls as part of his SAFF Cup preparations. 

I will discuss the issue with All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. I want to start the conditioning camp as soon as possible, Nayeemuddin said at the Calcutta South Club on Monday. 

The Indian coach is also not averse to use the services of I. M. Vijayan, whom he described as a classy player. 

Of course I may call Vijayan. To me, age is not a factor, fitness is. 

Asked where he would like to train his boys, Nayeemuddin said, I want to conduct it in Darjeeling, but the final word rests with AIFF. 

I would like to invite former greats such as P.K. Banerjee, Chuni Goswami or Peter Thangaraj to inspire the boys? Even if they can emulate some of their work ethics, Indian team has a bright future. 

Nayeemuddin, incidentally, has been appointed till the 2006 Asian Games in Doha (and not Goa, as was erroneously reported in these columns on Monday). 

On how he would tackle the situation if clubs refuse to release players for the camp, Nayeem said, I would make a personal request. 

The coach also felt that a long-term contract, a minimum of two to three years, would have been more helpful. 

The Dronacharya has plans of taking his squad for an exposure trip to South Korea sometime after the SAFF Cup.

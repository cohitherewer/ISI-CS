 Jeev finishes joint 23rd

Hainan Island: Jeev Milkha Singh managed his fourth straight under-par score, but that was good enough only for tied 23rd in an incredibly low-scoring $1 m TCL Classic at the Yalong Bay Golf Club on Sunday. 

Jeev carded a two-under 70 and totalled 12-under 276. He was the best Indian finisher as Amandeep Johl wilted on the final day with a two-over par 74 and a total of 11-under 277 and finished tied 29th. 

Harmeet Kahlon tied for 65th with a final round of 73 and a total of four-under 284. 

Paul Casey (66) claimed his fourth title on the European Tour when he beat Paul McGinley (63) at the second hole of a sudden-death play-off. Both ended the 72 holes on 22-under 266 in the event co-sanctioned by Asian and European Tours. 

In the play-off on the 18th, both parred first time, and then the second time, Casey holed a 25-footer for a fine win. 

Thomas Bjorn overcame a quadruple bogey to card a 66 and tie for third with Chawalit Plaphol of Thailand and Korea?s Wook-soon Kang at 21-under 267. Colin Montgomerie was sixth. 

Jeev had three birdies on the front nine, but on the back despite two easy par fives, he went one over with a bogey at the 11th and the rest were pars. For the tied 23rd he made 7,612 euros. 

Johl just did not get into the rhythm Sunday. He bogeyed the second but then birdied the seventh and 10th, before dropping two shots on the 11th and another on the 17th for a card of 74, his worst for the week. His tied 29th earned him 5,737 euros.

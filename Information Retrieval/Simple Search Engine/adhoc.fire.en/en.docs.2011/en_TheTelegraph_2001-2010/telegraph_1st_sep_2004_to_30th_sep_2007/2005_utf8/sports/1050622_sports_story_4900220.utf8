 Rio de Janeiro: The former fianc?e of Real Madrid?s striker Ronaldo hit back at accusations that she had reaped millions following her split with the Brazilian.

 Former model Daniella Cicarelli , who separated from Ronaldo earlier this month, denied reports that she had received a 4-million-euro ($4.8m) pay-off, an estimated 63,000 euro a day for their time together, because of a pre-nuptial arrangement agreed with the footballer. ?Our story wasn?t about money. No one marries and signs a pre-nuptial agreement under which she receives 4 million euro after three months.?

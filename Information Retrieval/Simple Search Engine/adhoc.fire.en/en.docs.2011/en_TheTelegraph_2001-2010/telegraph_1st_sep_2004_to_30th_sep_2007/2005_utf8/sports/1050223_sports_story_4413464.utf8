Nagpur: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly and Laxmi Ratan Shukla tore Bangaldesh bowling apart, scoring centuries as East Zone made a powerful start on the first day of the Duleep Trophy match against Bangladesh here on Tuesday. 

Shukla raced to 123 in 143 balls, including five sixes, and along with Sourav, cashed in on the solid start given by the top order. 

Sourav was more sedate, scoring 110 off 169 balls with 14 fours and one six, as he remained unbeaten with Sanjib Sanyal at the other side. At the end of the day?s play, East Zone are 356 for five. 

Despite losing former India opener Shib Sundar Das (4) early, East Zone never looked under threat as opener Arindam Das and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni laid a solid foundation. Das, who was more cautious, faced 104 balls for his 43. But Dhoni was in his elements as he struck 51 from 71 deliveries with the help of eight fours and a six. 

Both Das and Dhoni fell to Abdur Razzaq. The left-arm spinner was the most effective Bangladesh bowler with three for 98. Two wickets forced East on the backfoot at 126 for four. It was then that Shukla and Sourav wrested the initiative from the visitors. 

Bangladesh used eight bowlers to break the partnership but it was too little too late.

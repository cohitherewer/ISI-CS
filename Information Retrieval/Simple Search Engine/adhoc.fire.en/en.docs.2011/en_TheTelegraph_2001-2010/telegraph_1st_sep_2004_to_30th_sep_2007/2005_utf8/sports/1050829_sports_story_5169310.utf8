Calcutta: It all boiled down to Amal Duttas strategy and a couple of mistakes from the Mohammedan Sporting defence as Mohun Bagan notched up their sixth consecutive win in the CFL Premier Division at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

Dharamjit Singh in the 74th minute and statemate Manjit Singh at the stroke of 90th minute scored for the winners. 

Dutta decided to keep Dipendu Biswas ? who struck the winner versus Ever-Ready in the previous match ? in the starting line-up as a support to the new Togolese recruit Gley Yao Rodrigue. Accordingly, the black-and-white coach Biswajit Bhattacharya also made his defender Madhab Das to keep the foreigner under his watchful eyes. 

Das did well to pose all sorts of problems to the foreigner, but ultimately the others who were left with free spaces did the needful. 

Mohun Bagans task became all the more easier when it came to deal with the inexperienced backline of Mohammedan Sporting, especially towards the end. 

Both teams banked on counter-attacks till the lemon break and Mohammedan Sporting , sans foreigners, made Duttas men to sweat a lot to get past the last line of defence. Raman Vijayan and Jiten Rai thronged the Mohun Bagan goal several times, but lack of finishing was to be blamed for the blank scoresheet in the first session. 

Perhaps the worry of dropping first point had forced the green-and-maroon brigade to go all out after the breather. By that time, Mohammedan Sporting forwards ? especially exhausted Vijayan ? was in no position to keep their pace going. As a result, the pressure started building on the Mohammedan Sporting defence. 

It was in the 74th minute Mohammedan Sporting stopper-back Bijay Baspore made a costly mistake, leading to the first goal. Tomba Singh, who was a mere spectator till then, crossed one from right for Dharamjit, who flicked the ball towards the first post. Baspore failed to intercept the ball and it went in as the goalie Gopal Das was in charge of the far post. 

After the first goal, Mohun Bagan took charge of the proceedings and threatened the opponents goal several times. 

Now it seemed necessary for Bhattacharya to replace Vijayan and bring in someone with fresh pair of legs to pose problem for Eduardo Coelho and Co. K.P. Zubair (who came in for Malsawma in the 79th minute), missed a sitter in the 82nd minute. 

When everyone was waiting for the referee Dhanapati Roy to blow the long whiste, Mohun Bagan extended the lead. All of a sudden Rodrigue got a ball in the middle and delivered it for advancing Manjit bisecting the two defenders. Manjiit made no mistake in slotting the ball home through the far post. 

The match, however, should be marked for poor supervision by the referee, who stopped the action unnecessarily by blowing the whistle on many occasions, whereas the advantage play could have easily been a sounder option.

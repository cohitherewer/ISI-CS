 Bhupathi-Damm crashes out

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi followed compatriot Leander Paes out of the Rogers Cup ATP Tennis tournament, losing in the doubles quarter final in Montreal last night. 

Bhupathi and his Czech Republic partner Martin Damm, seeded seventh, lost in straight sets 3-6, 6-7 (7-9), against the Zimbabwean pair of Kevin Ullyett and Wayne Black in the match of the $2.2-million event. 

Bhupathi and Damm played some ordinary tennis in the first set but upped their game in the next to stretch their rivals. 

But their effort was not enough as they lost the match in 110 minutes, according to information received here on Sunday.

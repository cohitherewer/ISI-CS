Calcutta: Orissa emerged as deserving toppers from East Zone of the national one-day meet with a comfortable 39-run win over Bengal in their final engagement at the Eden on Tuesday. 

Despite the defeat, Bengal managed a main round berth. 

Electing to bat, Orissa amassed 267 for five in 50 overs. In reply, Bengal reached 192 for six when bad light stopped play with five overs to go. According to the Duckworth-Lewis rule, Bengal needed to post 232 to get past Debashish Mohanty amp; Co. 

Orissa, thus, finished with 17 points and Bengal, who just about managed to avoid conceding a bonus point (Bengal had to get past 185-run target in 45 overs), settled for 12. 

Jharkhand beat Assam in the day?s other match to end with 10. Assam returned with a single point while Tripura haven?t won a single match. 

All through their innings, Bengal never looked intent on throwing down the gauntlet against Orissa bowlers. 

The home team, having lost three wickets inside the first 15 overs, surprisingly shrunk themselves in a sort of negative mould, focussing too much on not conceding the bonus point, as if it was only pride at stake for them. For that to happen, they needed to put up 214 in 50 overs and their gameplans also seemed to be revolving around that target. 

The scenes of coach Karsan Ghavri with captain Devang Gandhi and other CAB officials scurrying with rule books and holding periodical discussions with the Match Referee Ram Babu Gupta, were nothing but an apology of their intentions to stay in the match. 

Even Devang admitted later that their focus was not to concede the bonus once Deep Dasgupta was dismissed. Bengal were 156 for six in 34.1 overs at that time. 

?All credit to Orissa. They kept the pressure on us and deservingly won it,? the Bengal captain said after the match. 

Ghavri, however, was more forthright in criticising his team?s performance. ?It?s okay in East Zone. But if we continue to perform like this in the main round, we?ll be butchered,? he warned, adding a fortnight-long camp was on his mind before leaving for the main round. 

Both Rohan Gavaskar and Shukla perished, toying with unnecessary risks. The former Bengal captain committed himself to a quick single when the ball had already reached Shiv Sundar Das? hands at mid-off. 

Laxmi, on the other hand, tried to sweep a ball, pitched well outside the off-stump, out of over-ambition and was duly caught at square-leg. 

Only Gandhi played a lone fighting hand. He was unlucky in having been played on to Prabhanjan Mallick?s gentle off-cutter. His 65 came off 62 balls and contained 11 fours. 

Earlier, Orissa survived a brilliant Ranadeb Bose?s opening spell and beautifully paced their innings towards the end. P. Jaychandra (81 not out, 60 balls, 5x4, 3x6) and Niranjan Behera (75) put up 73 runs in the fifth wicket. 

 Behera perished in the 43rd over, with the total being 195. From there on, Jaychandra simply took the game away from Bengal with a fine attacking display. 

Two of his effortless overboundaries, one each off Ranadeb and Sanjib Sanyal, were a real treat to watch.

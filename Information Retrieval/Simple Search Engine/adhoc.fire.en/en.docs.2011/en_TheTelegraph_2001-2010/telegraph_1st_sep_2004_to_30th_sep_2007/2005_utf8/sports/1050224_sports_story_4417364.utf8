The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tolly, JCT draw

Ludhiana: Tollygunge Agragami let go a one goal advantage as JCT Mills managed to claw back and earn a point in the National League match here on Wednesday. 

Medio Saumik Dey put Tollygunge ahead three minutes before half time but the hosts regrouped and restored parity through Sukhwinder Singh in the 84th minute at the Guru Nanak Stadium. 

JCT now have 12 points from 10 matches while Tollygunge are on 11 after nine encounters. 

Tollygunge took the lead after Suley Musah combined with Dey to invade the rival territory. Dey then took a prompt that went into the net. 

JCT, however, cancelled the lead when Tollygunge custodian Arindam Ghose partly parried a stinging attempt from captain Ram Pal. The rebound reached Sukhwinder, who made no mistake with his header. (PTI)

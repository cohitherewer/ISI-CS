 Why discriminate against Karachi?

 - No city is safe from terrorists: Miandad 

Islamabad: This weeks bomb blasts in London show that nowhere is safe and England should reconsider their decision not to play in Karachi, former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad said on Saturday. 

England have refused to play a Test in the volatile southern port city of Karachi on their tour of Pakistan later this year citing security concerns for their players. 

The blasts in London prove that no city is safe today from terrorist activities but life has to go on, as it is going on in London. So why discriminate against Karachi? Miandad asked. 

More than 50 people were killed in four blasts on Londons transport network on Thursday. 

Miandad said Englands decision to not play a Test in Karachi yet go ahead with their one-day matches against Australia in London showed double standards. 

They can play in London despite the loss of lives in that city. Yet they are not willing to play a Test in Karachi in spite of security assurances by our (Pakistan Cricket) Board and government, he said. 

They have security concerns for their players in Karachi but they are willing to play in London despite the terrorist bombings, Miandad said.

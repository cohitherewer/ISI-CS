Madrid: New signing Robinho sparked Real Madrid to a 2-1 victory at Cadiz with an electrifying debut in his sides opening league game of the season on Sunday. 

The 21-year-old Brazilian, who arrived in Madrid on Friday, came on at 1-1 midway through the second half and helped fashion a wonderful winner for Raul with dazzling skill on the edge of the area. 

Last seasons runners-up Real had taken the lead when Ronaldo squeezed a low shot inside the post in the fifth minute, but Cadiz got a deserved equaliser midway through the second half with a Matias Pavoni volley. 

Real, who looked short of ideas until Robinho came on, grabbed victory five minutes from time when Raul poked home into the empty net after the former Santos player and Ronaldo had combined brilliantly to carve open the Cadiz defence. 

Champions Barcelona failed to get their title defence off to a winning start on Saturday when they were held to a 0-0 draw at promoted Alaves after an inspired performance by their former goalkeeper Roberto Bonano. 

Unlike Cadiz, Celta Vigo celebrated their return to the Primera Liga with a 2-0 win at home to Malaga on Sunday. 

Argentine midfielder Gustavo Lopez sent a left-foot rocket into the roof of the net after a quickly taken free-kick in the 10th minute. 

Former Malaga striker Fernando Baiano added the second two minutes into the second half when he finished off a sharp counter-attack with a shot from a tight angle. 

There was an upset in Pamplona where Osasuna snatched a 2-1 win over Champions League side Villarreal thanks to a double from Argentine striker Bernardo Romeo while Bernd Schusters Getafe claimed a 2-0 win at Espanyol. 

Athletic Bilbao lead the fledgling table thanks to their comprehensive 3-0 win at home to Basque rivals Real Sociedad on Saturday. 

It was Cadiz who created more danger for the rest of the half, midfielder Enrique catching Real keeper Casillas off guard with a venomous free-kick and a well-struck half-volley, and striker Oli going close with a glancing header. 

The Andalucians finally got their reward when Argentine striker Pavoni hooked a volley past Casillas after Oli had sent a header into the area following a corner in the 63rd minute. Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo responded by sending on Robinho in place of defensive midfielder Thomas Gravesen. 

The Brazilian announced his arrival with a neat flick over an opponents head with his very first touch of the ball and proceeded to revolutionise the Real attack with his pace and dazzling close control before playing a vital part in his sides winner. 

Controlling a lofted pass from David Beckham with his head, he swivelled across the edge of the area, left the ball to Ronaldo who burst into the box and unselfishly slipped a pass to Raul to poke home into the empty net. 

Meanwhile in Serie A, Robinhos Brazilian teammate Adriano hit an opening day hat-trick to help Inter Milan beat Treviso 3-0 and champions Juventus also made a winning start with a David Trezeguet header earning a 1-0 win over Chievo Verona on Sunday. 

 AC Milan held 

The biggest surprise was AC Milan being held to a 1-1 draw at promoted Ascoli, and there was a confident 3-0 win at Reggina for AS Roma. 

Portuguese winger Luis Figo, signed from Real Madrid during the close season, was the centre of attention at the San Siro as he made his full debut for Inter but it was the more familiar face of Adriano that provided the joy for the home fans hoping to end their 16-year title wait. (Reuters)

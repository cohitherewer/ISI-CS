 Decision on Vaughan in Multan

Lahore: Injured England captain Michael Vaughan will travel with his team on Wednesday to Multan where the first Test against Pakistan is scheduled from Saturday. 

It has been decided he will be going to Multan where his knee injury will be reassessed, a spokesman for the team said on Tuesday. 

There will be no further updates on his condition until we reach Multan, he added. 

Vaughan twisted his right knee while taking a third run on Monday in the three-day tour match against a Pakistan A side and results of a scan have been sent to medical specialists in London. 

Earlier on Tuesday the England team management said it planned to make a decision within 48 hours on whether to replace him. 

We are still not sure about Vaughan, coach Duncan Fletcher said after England lost the tour match by six wickets. 

We have sent his reports by e-mail to medical experts in England and, hopefully, we should get a firm answer by tonight on his condition. 

Two obvious replacements, batsmen Ovais Shah and Robert Key, have been ruled out by injury. 

Key has had a shoulder operation and Shah has a knee injury which didnt look too serious at first but a closer look has shown it is a far more serious, said Fletcher. 

Meanwhile, Fletcher refused to show any sign of concern over Englands form for the first Test against Pakistan after they lost the three-day tour match on Tuesday. 

It is not a big deal, we are a side starting out on a difficult tour, he said. It has happened before to us and I am confident the players will lift themselves for the Tests. 

Fletcher pointed out that earlier this year England lost to an A team in South Africa before going on to win the Test series in comfortable fashion. 

What happened here is somewhat similar to what happened in South Africa, he said. But we went out and played very good cricket. 

We have the quality players who can do it again and they realise how important Test cricket is and they will play the cricket they are capable of. 

England have struggled with their batting in the first tour matches in Pakistan. 

Although they won the opening three-dayer in Rawalpindi, they produced disappointing totals of 256 for nine and 112. In the second match, they were bowled out for 126 and 256. (Reuters)

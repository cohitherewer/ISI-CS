 Alonso gives Spain a miss

 - Heartbreak for home fans 

Kevin Eason

Spain was hailing its new national hero on Monday. Unfortunately, he has no intentions of going home to see the people who have elevated him to the status of a sporting god. At least, not yet. 

Fernando Alonso left a curious void at the heart of sporting Spain on Monday when he decided that his next port of call after winning the Formula One World Championship at the Brazilian Grand Prix would be Oxford, his adopted home, and not Oviedo in Asturia, his birthplace. 

There will be no open-top bus rides and no royal receptions, although one of the first calls to his mobile phone after the race on Sunday was from King Juan Carlos ? one of 300 calls that blitzed the airwaves over South America as well-wishers tried to contact the new champion. But they were precisely the calls that Alonso seemed reluctant to take. 

He has spoken several times about how he had to leave Spain to find his way into F1 by travelling to Britain as an 18-year-old, and clearly some bitterness and caution remain in his mind. When asked about holding a celebration in Spain, Alonso replied enigmatically: I would like to thank all my fans and everyone in Spain, but I am not returning to Spain just now because there are too many political interests that want to get involved. 

Alonso is a one-man sporting phenomenon at home, a sort of Andrew Flintoff, David Beckham and Tim Henman wrapped into one package. He has transformed F1 from a cult following to one that rivals football; the TV audience who witnessed his coronation was thought to be more than ten million ? double the figures even for matches involving Real Madrid and Barcelona.

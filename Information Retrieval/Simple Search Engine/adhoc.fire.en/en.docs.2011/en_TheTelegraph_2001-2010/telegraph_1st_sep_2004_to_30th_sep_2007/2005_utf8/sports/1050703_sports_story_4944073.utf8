 Lillee, Krebs interact with bowlers

 - Experts converge on NCA 

 Dennis Lillee 

Bangalore: Australian pace guru Dennis Lillee and acclaimed sports psychologist Charles Krebs Saturday interacted with Indias top pace bowlers at a pre-season camp as part of efforts by new coach Greg Chappell to fine-tune their skills. 

Lillee, director of the Chennai-based MRF Pace Foundation, and Krebs spent time with the speedsters in action this afternoon at the National Cricket Academy and assessed their performance, in the presence of Chappell. 

Chappell, who assumed charge last month, said the issues pointed out by Lillee and the Foundations chief coach T. A. Sekar, who accompanied him, would be followed-up. 

Former India speedster Jawagal Srinath, who is associated with the Foundation, was also seen giving a few tips to the bowlers. 

Lillee, who was here only for a day, recorded bowlers action will the watch video tapes and reinforce his points to them, Chappell said. The new coach left no one in doubt that he was keen to take everybody along to make India a champion side. 

I am hoping that today is the starting day for increasing the relationship between Team India, MRF Pace Foundation, NCA... getting everyone to work together for the thing we all want ? a strong Indian team. 

After a nearly two-hour interaction in the middle, Lillee told reporters that in particular, it was important that the bowlers actions were good, and also the efforts were to make sure that chances of injury were reduced. 

The 56-year-old former Australian captain said: Krebs will give a check-up ? physical and mental ? and hopefully able to put them in the right direction, mentally and physically. 

Lillee said he also advised the bowlers as to where and how to bowl and make the batsmen to do certain things. 

Its also about the thought process, an area in which Chappell is very good, Lillee said. Greg captained me for many years; obviously I learnt a lot from him. They (the players) should be asking him a lot about that. 

Asked about his views on whether India needed a full-time bowling coach, Lillee said it depends on what Chappell would like in place. Australia havent got a specialised bowling coach, for example, yet England have, he said.

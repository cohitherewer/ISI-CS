 Leander, Mahesh, Vivek win

London: The Indians enjoyed another good day at Wimbledon. Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic reached the last 16 of mens doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi and Mary Pierce moved into the mixed doubles quarters and Vivek Shokeen won his first-round clash in boys singles. 

Paes and Zimonjic notched up a four-set win over Americans Rick Leach and Travis Parrott. The fifth-seeded Indo-Serbian pair dropped the opening set before going through 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). 

Paes, who braved a shoulder injury to play here, and his partner next face Karol Beck (Slovakia) and Jaroslav Levinsky (Czech Republic). Beck and Martin Damm knockedout 10th seeds Martin Damm and Mariano Hood 7-6 (7-3), 6-7 (2-7), 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. 

Shokeen showed great fighting spirit by overcoming Swiss Robin Roshardts stiff challenge. The Indian conceded the first set before breezing through the next two to win 3-6, 6-0, 6-3. Shokeen will next come up against 17th seed Thiemo de Bakker of The Netherlands. 

Bhupathi and Pierce upset the second-seeded Zimbabwean brother-sister combination of Wayne and Cara Black 6-3, 6-4. It completed a memorable day for Pierce who had earlier advanced to the singles quarter finals for the first time in nine years at Wimbledon.

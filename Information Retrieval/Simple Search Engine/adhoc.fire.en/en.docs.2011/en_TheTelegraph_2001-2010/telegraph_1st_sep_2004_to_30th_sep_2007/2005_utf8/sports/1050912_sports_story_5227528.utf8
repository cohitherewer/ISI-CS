 Jyoti finishes tied 14th

Singapore: Jyoti Randhawas grit and experience carried him through a tough fourth and final round and saw him finish at tied 14th at the $2 million Singapore Open at the Serapong Golf Course on Sunday. 

On a day when just six players managed par or under, Randhawa grinded out a three-over 74 to finish tied with Australian Terry Pilkadaris. 

The next best Indian was Ashok Kumar at tied 28th. Arjun Singh (81), the best Indian for the first three days, wilted under hot and humid conditions to drop from tied 11th after the third round to a tied 41st. 

Adam Scott, the world No. 7, who finished his third round this morning with three birdies in last four holes, kept that momentum to card a 65 and win the tournament at 13-under 265, seven shots ahead of Lee Westwood (278). 

Just five players finished under par over four days, and another two at par, as the high roughs and tough conditions at the Serapong course took their toll. (AFP)

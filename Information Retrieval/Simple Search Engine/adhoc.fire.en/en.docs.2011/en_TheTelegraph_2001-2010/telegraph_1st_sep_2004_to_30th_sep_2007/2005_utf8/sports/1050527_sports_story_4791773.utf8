 Liverpool prove masters of improbable

PAUL HAYWARD IN ISTANBUL

The Phoenix should be Liverpools new emblem. After conceding the fastest goal in the history of European Cup finals, the club who dominated football on the continent in the late 1970s and early 1980s rose and took flight with victory after one of the most spectacular comebacks ever to grace this competition. 

The line Rafa Benitezs men walked here Wednesday night was between humiliation and resurrection. Three second-half goals inside five minutes are sufficient for us to conclude that the Anfield tradition has been saved from the grave. Its one thing to plot and scuff your way to a final before being subjugated by a superior opponent. But Liverpools refusal to yield to the Milan of Paolo Maldini, Andrei Shevchenko and Kaka came from the heart. It will be the base on which Benitez builds a new Liverpool next season. A Liverpool who surely ought to be capable of roughing up Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United. 

Like the FA Cup final, this was a game of brutal tension. The surest evidence that reality had invaded the pitch seemed to come when some Liverpool supporters began weeping through the half-time interval. Those crimson tears were washing away the ink on a new page in the clubs illustrious history. Those who shed them have learned a lesson for life: never despair. 

Milan were already 3-0 up by the time Benitezs men found sanctuary in the dressing room, so maybe the pessimism was understandable. It was time, though, to remember that the Premierships fifth best team had already knocked out the champions of Italy and England en route to this final. They are masters of the improbable. 

When Liverpool crept past Chelsea to reach their first European Cup final for 20 years, Anfield regulars imagined an exotic destination bathed in hot Turkish sun. Instead, they encountered thick cloud and biting wind at a white elephant of a ground that sits in a lunar landscape, surrounded by impoverished neighbourhoods. Nothing on this crazy, tumultuous night followed a script. 

Cunning, defensive solidity and the odd lightning raid had taken them past Chelsea and Juventus. Now, though, a tactical dilemma confronted Benitez. Excessive caution might prove fatal against a Milan team who can beat most opponents at chess. PSV Eindhovens audacious attempt to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit in their semi-final had almost come off. 

Was this the magic formula for Liverpool to win their fifth European Cup? Benitez thought so, if the surprising inclusion of Harry Kewell at the expense of Dietmar Hamann was any guide. That bold attacking policy was undone inside 20 minutes when Kewell, the antithesis of the Aussie hard man, began limping theatrically and was booed off the pitch by Liverpools followers. As Vladimir Smicer took his place, Kaka began ripping through the Liverpool midfield with the ball at his feet and Shevchenko and Crespo pulled left and right to stretch the Anfield clubs previously impervious defence. 

While Kaka tormented Xabi Alonso, who was over-run in the midfield anchor position, Shevchenko went to work on the left-back, Djimi Traore, who found out why this Ukrainian marksman is arguably the worlds best centre-forward. 

By half-time, Kaka slicing through the middle to supply the two Milan strikers was proving a lethal formula. As the tears rolled, there was the temptation to look away in sympathy and embarrassment. The post-mortems would say that Liverpool had no business being in a Champions League final when they have travelled for 15 years without winning their domestic league. No business, when theyre not even the leading team in Liverpool. It was going to be hindsight time. Told-you-all-along time. 

Except that Liverpool summoned from way down inside the spirit that has stopped Anfield sliding into the Mersey these past 15 years. This sudden, defiant urge may have stemmed from the fear of humiliation. They were like a bloodied prize-fighter who fears the indignity of being taken apart in front of his family and friends. 

Emotion was only part of it. The tactical key to Liverpools revival was the arrival of Hamann, that wily, gritty German, who plugged the gaps around Alonso and provided fresh composure and confidence. 

With six minutes left, the Liverpool fans were chanting ole, ole as their heroes stroked the ball around. Baros gave way to Djibril Cisse as Youll Never Walk Alone rang round the ground. The Daily Telegraph

 Uefa wants four on roster

Nyon: Clubs taking part in the Champions League and Uefa Cup will have to include at least four homegrown players in their 25-man squads from the start of the 2006-7 season. 

The quota will increase to six players the following season, rising to a maximum of eight homegrown players by 2008-9 following a decision at a one-day conference of the presidents and general secretaries of Uefa?s 51 national members. 

The ruling could be expanded to include domestic competitions at Uefa?s annual congress in Tallinn in April, Lars-Christer Olsson, Uefa?s chief executive, told reporters. 

Uefa defines homegrown players as those who, aged between 15 and 21, were developed at the club or by other clubs from the same national association. 

The nationality of a homegrown player will be irrelevant in a bid to circumvent any opposition by the European Union on the grounds of freedom of trade. 

?Compared to 1995-6 when the Bosman ruling on freedom of movement was introduced, there are now 30 percent less players coming from one country now playing for their clubs in that country in the top division,? Olsson said. 

?The trend is very clear and European football has realised that it must be addressed and reversed.?

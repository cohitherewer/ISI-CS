The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhupathi backing for Sourav

SANJIB GUHA

Calcutta: Nine-time Grand Slam winner Mahesh Bhupathi on Friday stood by Team India captain Sourav Ganguly after the latter admitted that he had been asked to step down on the eve of the India-Zimbabwe Test in Bulawayo. 

I still feel that he is the best captain and as a batsman he showed his class and form yesterday, Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Sourav, whose 11th Test century (144) was against Australia in Brisbane in 2003, completed 5000 Test runs on Thursday en route to his 101 in Bulawayo. His 12th ton came after a gap of 13 Tests . 

Bhupathi, a long-time friend of Souravs, felt people only remember a players failures and not achievements. You have to remember that Sourav has been performing consistently over the past nine years and more brilliant displays are surely in the offing. 

Some may try to belittle him saying he got a century against Zimbabwe, but if he had got a duck yesterday, the same people would have cursed him for not getting runs even against a weak opposition, Bhupathi said. 

The Wimbledon and US Open mixed doubles champion said: Sourav shouldnt listen to what others say, instead he should concentrate and continue the good work he has been doing for the country so far, he said.

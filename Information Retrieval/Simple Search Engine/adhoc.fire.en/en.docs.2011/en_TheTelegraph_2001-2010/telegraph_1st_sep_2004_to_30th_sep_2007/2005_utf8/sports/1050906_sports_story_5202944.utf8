 No threat of strike: ZCU

Harare: The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) and the Zimbabwe Professional Cricketers Association (ZPCA) said on Monday there was no threat of a players strike disrupting the Test series against India starting from September 13. 

Ozias Bvute, managing director of ZCU, said: Zimbabwe cricket is not in crisis and there was never a threat of any strike. We are in the process of negotiating new contracts with the players, which started a week ago. 

Mluleki Nkala, ZPCA chairman, said: The players have never been thinking of a strike. We know what is at stake and it wouldnt be good for international cricket. 

Rumours of another strike began when ZCU announced it had withdrawn the contract offers to Stuart Carlisle, Barney Rogers and Neil Ferreira.

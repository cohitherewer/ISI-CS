 Pietersen, Bell hit centuries

 - SECOND TEST vs PAKISTAN 

 Ian Bell on way to his century on Tuesday 

Faisalabad: Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell scored hundreds as England fought back to reach 391 for seven wickets on the third day of the second Test against Pakistan on Tuesday. 

England were 71 runs behind Pakistans imposing total of 462 after Pietersen (100) and Bell (115) put on 154 runs for the fourth wicket to rescue the team from a shaky 113 for three. 

Ashley Giles was unbeaten on 23 and Shaun Udal had made six when play ended 12 overs early due to bad light. 

Pietersen, who had managed just 40 runs in six innings before the Test, came good just when England needed him, rekindling the form that brought him a total of 473 runs in the Ashes series against Australia. 

He took the attack to the Pakistani bowlers with a brilliant 100 runs from 137 balls with six fours and three sixes for his second Test century. 

The pair went through the extended first session without any problems as England reached 217 for three at lunch but then fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar took two quick wickets with the second new ball to raise Pakistan hopes.

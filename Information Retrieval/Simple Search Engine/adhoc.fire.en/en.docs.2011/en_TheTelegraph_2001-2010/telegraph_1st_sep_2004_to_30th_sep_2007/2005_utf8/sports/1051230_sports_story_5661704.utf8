 Cicinho passes Real medical

Madrid: Brazil defender Cicinho, Real Madrids new signing, passed a medical after arriving in the Spanish capital on Wednesday, the clubs website said. 

Real Madrid signed Cicinho on a five-year deal from world club champions Sao Paulo in an effort to strengthen the squad after a disappointing run of results. 

Spanish media reported that the defender, part of the Brazil side that crushed Argentina 4-1 to win the Confederations Cup in June, had signed for a fee of around 4 million euros ($4.75 million). 

We saw six months ago that his medical condition is very good and today there was no change in that, Real Madrid doctor Alfonso del Corral said. 

He is fast and has never suffered a significant injury, del Corral told the website. 

Cicinho faces strong competition to get into Reals starting line-up. I have come to give my best. Its the coach who decides who plays, I have to do my work on the field, he said. 

Real now have a surfeit of right-sided defenders with Spanish internationals Michel Salgado and Sergio Ramos and Uruguays Carlos Diogo all competing for a slot in the back four. 

Cicinho is the fifth Brazilian international in the squad, joining Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Julio Baptista and Robinho. 

Cicinho played in the Sao Paulo team that beat Liverpool 1-0 to win Fifas World Club Championship this month. 

Real Madrid ended their year in miserable fashion when they were jeered off the pitch after a 1-2 defeat by Racing Santander at the Bernabeu a week ago, their fourth home loss of the season. 

The defeat dropped Real to fifth place in the Primera Liga, 11 points adrift of leaders Barcelona. The nine-time European champions have, however, booked their place in the last 16 of the Champions League where they will face Arsenal. 

On December 4, Vanderlei Luxemburgo was sacked as coach less than a year after taking the helm.

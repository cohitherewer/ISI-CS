 Englands chance to be No.1

London: England have some chance of toppling Australia as the top ranked Test cricket team when they take on the arch-rivals in the forthcoming Ashes Series at home this summer. 

If England repeat their last seasons 100 per cent home record in Tests, they will finish the summer at the top of the ICC Test championship table. 

It means clean sweeps of the two Tests against Bangladesh and five versus Australia that will see them move ahead of their opponents from down under for the first time. 

With the official rankings set to undergo their annual update on August 1, the mathematics involved is complex but if England beat Bangladesh 2-0 and then Australia 5-0 they will definitely go top of the official table, the ICC said in a release here Tuesday. 

Even if the margin of victory against Bangladesh is only 1-0, a 5-0 win over Australia will be just good enough for the Test championship mace to change hands at the end of the Ashes. 

If England beat Bangladesh 2-0 and Australia 4-0, they will draw level with Australia on points but will remain second when the ratings are recalculated to three decimal places, the release added. 

The team, currently second in the official table, must beat Bangladesh 2-0 in the two Test match series starting on Thursday to improve its rating by one.

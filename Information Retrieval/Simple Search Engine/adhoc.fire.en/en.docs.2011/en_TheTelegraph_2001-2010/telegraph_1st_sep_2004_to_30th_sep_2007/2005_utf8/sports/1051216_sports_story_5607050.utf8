 Ashes squeezed into 45 days

Perth: The 2006-07 Ashes series between Australia and England will be sandwiched into a 45-day window to avoid clashing with the major one-day tournaments scheduled around the same period, it was announced on Thursday. 

The eagerly-awaited itinerary, released by Cricket Australia (CA) after months of fine-tuning, confirmed leaked reports that the five Tests will be squeezed into six and a half weeks from late November 2006 to early January 2007. 

The first Test starts in Brisbane (November 23-27) followed by Adelaide (December 1-5), Perth (December 14-18) and the traditional Boxing Day Test in Melbourne (December 26-30) and New Year Test in Sydney (January 2-6). 

CA chief executive James Sutherland said the dates had been announced six months ahead of schedule because of the interest generated from Englands enthralling 2-1 series victory this year. 

Meanwhile, Australia fans will get a rare chance to see crickets most famous trophy on their own soil. Australian and English cricket officials have reached an agreement allowing the tiny urn to tour Australia during the 2006-2007 series. 

It will be only the second time the vessel has left Englands shores even though Australia have won more series over the past 129 years. 

The urn has only once before been displayed in Australia, in 1988 to celebrate the bicentenary of European settlement. (REUTERS)

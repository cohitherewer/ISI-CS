Stockholm: Olympic champion Justin Gatlin overcame a slow start to win the mens 100m in 10.15 seconds at the IAAF Super Grand Prix meeting on Tuesday. 

The American, running competitively for the last time before the World Athletics Championships in Helsinki which begins on August 6, edged out Jamaicans Dwight Thomas (10.19) and Michael Frater (10.30). 

I just wanted to go out there and make a great race, Gatlin told reporters. Its funny, sometimes you feel like you run fast but you are running slow and sometimes you feel slow but you run fast, added Gatlin, whose personal best is 9.85 seconds. 

Olympic champion and world record holder Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia dominated the pole vault event, setting a stadium record of 4.79m. 

Polands Anna Rogowska (4.65) and Monika Pyrek (4.65) were second and third, respectively. 

Isinbayeva attempted to set her 18th world record when she tried to clear 5.01 but narrowly missed out. Four days ago at Crystal Palace in London, the Russian became the first woman in history to clear five metres. 

Both Isinbayeva and Kenyas Isaac Songok ? who also set a stadium by clocking 7:35.84 in the 3,000m ? received a one-carat diamond each. 

Songok led a Kenyan sweep, Benjamin Limo (7:36.79) and Augustine Choge (7:37.24) coming in second and third, respectively. (REUTERS)

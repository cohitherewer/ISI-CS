 2 defeats for Indians

New Delhi: Asia Cup winners India suffered their second straight defeat when they were stunned by Ireland 1-2 in the six-nation KT Cup womens hockey tournament in Seongnam, Korea Monday. 

This was Indias second defeat in the competition, following a 0-3 drubbing at the hands of Korea, who again won Monday to maintain their position atop the points table, according to information received here. 

Ireland took the lead after 11 minutes through Jenny Burke by converting a penalty corner. They then doubled the lead in the 22nd minute when Burke scored her second goal, according to information received here. 

Though the Indians tried to stage a comeback after changing ends, Ireland absorbed a lot of pressure midway the second half. 

India finally reduced the margin making full use of their seventh penalty corner attempt. 

With Indians going all out for the equaliser, the Irish goal came under repeated attacks but held on to the slender lead helped by a superb performance by their goalkeeper. Angela Platt made two important saves late in the match to keep Ireland ahead. 

India, who had a fine start to their campaign with a 7-2 win over Malaysia, were held 1-1 by England in their second match before losing their next two games to tally four points from as many outings. 

Korea lead the table with 12 points, followed by England (8), China (5). India and Ireland shared the fourth place while Malaysia were yet to open the account. 

Sunday, India crashed to their first defeat, versus the Koreans. The home teams goals were all scored from set pieces, with a pair of first half penalty corners conversion by Ko Woon Oh and Seon Ok Lee, complemented by a penalty stroke goal in the 54th minute through Eun Sil Kim.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tiger, Vijai have it easy

Carlsbad: Title holder Tiger Woods and world No. 1 Vijai Singh cruised to first-round victories at the WGC-Accenture Match Play championship on Thursday, while 2000 winner Darren Clarke made an early exit. 

After rain delayed the start of the $7.5 million event by 24 hours, play finally began at the La Costa Resort and Spa under more typical southern Californian sunshine. 

Woods, bidding for a third consecutive crown here and a return to the top of the world rankings, eased past Zimbabwe?s Nick Price four and three to extend his unbeaten run in the tournament to 13 matches and take his overall record to a sparkling 21-3. 

Price, a three-time Major winner, represented a potentially tricky test, but the world No. 2 went one up at the opening hole and never trailed.

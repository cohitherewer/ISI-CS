Paris: Mary Pierce says she and her father, once banned from WTA Tour events for abusive behaviour, have reconciled and spent time together both on and off the court. 

The relationship with my dad is great, said Pierce. 

Jim Pierce was banned from WTA Tour events from 1993-98. He punched a spectator at the 1993 French Open and was accused of having an abusive relationship with Mary, his ex-wife, Yannick, and his son, David. 

Mary, who won the 2000 French Open, divides her training time between Nick Bollettieris Tennis Academy in Florida and Paris. Her father lives in Florida, and when shes there he watches her practice. 

My dad has been coming out on the courts, she said . Hell come to practice like every day. He just loves it, and he loves tennis. 

Meanwhile, Australian media reports from Sydney on Thursday said that Lleyton Hewitt would marry his soap opera star fianc?e Bec Cartwright on July 21.

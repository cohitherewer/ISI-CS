 Harikrishna draws with Timman

Pamplona (Spain): Former World Junior Champion P. Harikrishna started his campaign with a draw against Jan Timman of The Netherlands in the first round of the Ciudad De Pamplona International Chess tournament here. 

Harikrishna, who arrived hours before the commencement of the first round game here, had to be content with half a point in this eight-player category-16 round-robin event, that will be played over seven rounds in an all-Grandmasters field. 

Ivan Cheparinov of Bulgaria turned out to be the lone winner of the opening day after he outwitted Oscar de la Vira Aguado of Andorra. 

After round I, Cheparinov is the sole leader on one point while Harikrishna, Zviad, Timman, Ponomariov, Fressinet and Tiviakov are on half a point each. Aguado is yet to open his account. 

Though he was definitely tired after a long journey, it did not show in Harikrishnas attitude while playing against Timman. (PTI)

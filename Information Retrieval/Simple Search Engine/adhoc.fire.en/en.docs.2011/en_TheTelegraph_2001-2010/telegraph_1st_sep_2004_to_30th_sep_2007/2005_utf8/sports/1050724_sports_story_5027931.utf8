London: World record holder Asafa Powell pulled up injured in the 100 metres and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva became the first woman to clear five metres at a surprise-filled London Grand Prix meeting on Friday (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Watched by the greatest pole vaulter of them all, Ukrainian Sergei Bubka, Isinbayeva sailed over five metres to improve on her world record of 4.96 set on her previous attempt. It was the 23-year-old Russians fourth world record of the month and the 17th of her career. She sank to her knees in disbelief after clearing the height on her first attempt. 

It was my dream to be the first woman over five metres, said Isinbayeva. I cant explain my feelings. I dont know how much higher I can go, maybe 5.05 or higher. 

Isinbayevas efforts earned her $50,000 and an undisclosed five-figure sum from the meetings sponsors. 

The 100m was billed as a showdown between the worlds two fastest men, Powell and Olympic champion Justin Gatlin. Powell powered out of the blocks but then fell to the ground after appearing to aggravate a groin injury. 

American Gatlin, running in the next lane, won the race in 9.89 seconds, his fastest time this season. Leonard Scott of the US was second in 9.94 and world champion Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis finished third. 

Asafa will have a scan tonight and based on that will receive treatment tomorrow, said the Jamaican sprinters agent Paul Doyle. The injury appears to be a slight strain high on Asafas groin. Perhaps a slightly different injury from the groin problem troubling him earlier this week. 

Powell and Gatlin had been due to clash in Rome earlier this month but the Jamaican pulled out with a groin injury. Gatlin was given the verdict over Powell in their only previous meeting this year, in Eugene, Oregon, even though both were timed at a wind-assisted 9.84 seconds. The 22-year-old Powell ran a world record 9.77 in the Athens Olympic stadium 10 days later on June 14. 

American teenager Allyson Felix ended Olympic champion Veronica Campbells five-year unbeaten run over 200m. Felix, who finished second to the Jamaican in last years Athens final and has not lost since, clocked 22.16 for the third fastest time in the world this year. (Reuters)

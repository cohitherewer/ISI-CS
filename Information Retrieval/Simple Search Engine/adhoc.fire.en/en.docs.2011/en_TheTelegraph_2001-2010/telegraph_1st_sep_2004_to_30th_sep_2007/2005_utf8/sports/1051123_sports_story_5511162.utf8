 Jhulan floors England eves

New Delhi: A brilliant new ball spell by Jhulan Goswami saw Indian eves reduce England to 103 for seven in their first innings on the second day of the one-off Test at the Jamia Millia University ground here on Tuesday. 

Jhulan grabbed four for 16 to help the hosts comeback into the match after they failed to consolidate their strong position and were all out for 289, an addition of 45 runs to their overnight total, in the morning. 

England could have been in a lot worse position after being 61 for six at one stage but Arran Brindle lifted them with a timely knock of 37 from 139 balls. The visitors were still 186 runs in arrears and needed 37 more to avoid follow on. 

The two unbeaten batswomen ? Birch (14) and Beth Morgan (1) ? were at the crease at close. 

Earlier, off-spinner Laura Harper claimed her first five-wicket haul as Indian women, resuming at 244 for five, lost their remaining wickets in just 28.5 overs. 

The Indians might have fancied a target of 350 but the quick wickets of Rumeli Dhar (39) and Amita Sharma (4) in the space of 10 runs undid the good work of Tuesday. 

Jhulan contributed a vital 24 even as her teammates showed little inclination to stay at the crease. 

BRIEF SCORES 

India (overnight 244/5) 298 (Jhulan Goswami 24; Laura Harper 5/66). England 103/7 (Arran Brindle 37; Jhulan Goswami 4/16, Rumeli Dhar 2/14). Match to continue.

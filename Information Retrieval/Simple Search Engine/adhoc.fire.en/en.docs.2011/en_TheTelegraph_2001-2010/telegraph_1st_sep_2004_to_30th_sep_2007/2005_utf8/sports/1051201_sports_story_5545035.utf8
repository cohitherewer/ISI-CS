 Ivanisevic poised for Davis Cup swansong

 McEnroe feels Ivanisevic will be competitive if picked 

Paris: Eighteen months after donning his beloved Croatian football shirt and waving goodbye to the Wimbledon Centre Court, Goran Ivanisevic is poised to write a final chapter in his colourful tennis odyssey. 

The 34-year-old, who captured a memorable Wimbledon title in 2001, has won a surprise recall to the Croatian squad in an effort to help his infant nation win a first-ever Davis Cup when they meet Slovakia in the final this weekend. 

Ivanisevic last played Davis Cup in 2003 and is only expected to feature in Bratislava in a dead rubber should the destiny of the title be decided before Sundays final day. 

Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic will carry the teams hopes but tennis legend John McEnroe is one of many who believe that Ivanisevic could have a crucial role to play. 

I think he would be competitive if he was picked, said McEnroe. 

Hes not going to play on the first day ? they wouldnt pick him for the singles, but I would love to see him play in the doubles. The situation does favour him. 

Hes playing indoors on a medium-paced court, so its going to be perfect for him. 

He might not have played much doubles recently but the way he plays, he could go out there and I think he could actually win for them. I could see Goran playing well against anyone he plays against. 

Im hopeful that he will play because it will make it much more interesting. 

Ivanisevic first played Davis Cup in 1988 as a raw teenager for Yugoslavia. 

He made his debut for Croatia in 1993, has a 48-15 singles record in the tournament. In doubles, he and Ljubicic have not lost the six rubbers they have contested. 

However, he knows that captain Nikki Pilic will be unlikely to break up the partnership of Ljubicic and Ancic who teamed to beat world No. 1 pair Mike and Bob Bryan when Croatia defeated the United States in the first round of this years competition. (AFP)

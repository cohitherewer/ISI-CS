 Roy Keane blasts teammates 

 IAN WINROW AND ROB STEWART 

Roy Keanes no-nonsense verdict on Manchester Uniteds humiliating defeat at Middlesbrough forced club officials and MUTV into an embarrassing climbdown on Monday. 

The United captain was due to appear as a guest on the Play the Pundit programme on MUTV, the clubs official television station, and analyse Saturdays 4-1 reverse at the Riverside Stadium. But the pre-recorded programme was pulled from its scheduled slot Monday night after Keane, currently out injured, offered a brutally honest view of his teammates failings in a game that seriously undermined Uniteds hopes of challenging Chelsea for the Premiership title. 

 The Irishman is believed to have pulled no punches in singling out individual players for criticism and raised questions about the attitude of some members of Sir Alex Fergusons squad. The station felt obliged to confer with United officials, including chief executive David Gill, before deciding to re-schedule the show for Tuesday. The controversy comes just weeks after Keane stunned Ferguson by announcing that he expected to quit the club during a live phone-in on the station. 

Meanwhile, Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing said on Monday that he would not jeopardise his future for the sake of challenging for an Englands World Cup place by trying to make a hasty recovery from knee surgery. 

Steve McClaren, Boros manager and also an England coach, is bracing himself for the news that the 21-year-old will be unavailable until February. Downing is determined to avoid rushing back following the second of two knee operations. The manager has told me I am still in Svens thoughts, he said. But Ive just got to regain my full fitness, aim to force my way back into the Middlesbrough team and then hopefully more international recognition will follow. 

After the operation I wanted to come back as quickly as possible but Gareth Southgate was one of the first team-mates to tell me how important it was not to rush back.

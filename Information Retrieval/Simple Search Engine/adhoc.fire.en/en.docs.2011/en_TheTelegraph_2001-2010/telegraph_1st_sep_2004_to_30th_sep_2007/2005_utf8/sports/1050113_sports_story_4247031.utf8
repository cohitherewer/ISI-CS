The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tewari named deputy

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal allrounder Manoj Tewari was named vice-captain of the India under-19 squad that will take on England in the first two ?Tests? later this month. ?I came to know only in the afternoon. I am quite confident that I will able to do justice to the faith shown on me by the selectors,? Tewari said on Tuesday. 

Tewari feels that his 68 against Tamil Nadu in the national one-dayers for Bengal was the turning point in his career. ?That was the innings which caught everyone?s eye,? he quipped. Tewari, who bats right-handed and is also quite effective with his leg-breaks, hogged limelight in the Cooch Behar Trophy. In the two matches he played in the national under-19 meet, he scored 93 and 143 against Mumbai in the quarters and followed it up with a four-wicket haul in the semi-final against Punjab. 

Hyderabad?s Ambati Rayudu stays captain of the national side. Former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad has been named coach.

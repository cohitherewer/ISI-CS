 Padmanabhan 

 Bangalore: Randsberg, who was recently third behind Democraticus over 1600m, which is a trifle short for the liking of the Padmanabhan trainee, may win the 2000m Stewards Trophy, Saturdays main event, here. Moreover, the benefit of that run has stripped the Alnasr Alwasheek-Mystic Memory colt lot fitter and he may be hard to down in the hands of jockey Suraj Narredu.

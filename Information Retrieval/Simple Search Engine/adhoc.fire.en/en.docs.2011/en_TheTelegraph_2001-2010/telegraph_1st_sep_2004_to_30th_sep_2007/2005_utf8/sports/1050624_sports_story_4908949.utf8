 How Federers serenity kills

 - The world No. 1 plays in a trance of quiet perfection 

SIMON BARNES 

There are all kinds of ways of imposing your personality on someone, as many as there are personalities. You dont have to roar at people, shout and swear at them, insult them and jump all over them. True, Venus Williams used to do it that way, treating her opponents as if she had discovered them on the sole of her shoe. 

Roger Federer does it another way. He imposes his serenity on people. And they hate it. You can see them thinking: Please Roger. Please hate me, please snarl at me, please get seriously angry with me. Because this serenity is killing me. Its far worse than rage. Its like the Monty Python ultimate torture of the comfy chair. 

Federer plays in a trance of quiet perfection and when the camera cuts to him, or when the opponent steals a glance, you cant tell if he has won the point or lost it. No fist-pumping histrionics, no sky-shattering despair, not even a Tim-Henman-little-skip. He just walks back considering the infinite possibilities of life. 

It must be like playing tennis against Lao Tzu. Tennis is a duel and it is about personalities. Therefore, by definition, your personality is your weapon. John McEnroe used rage, Jimmy Connors used mad defiance, Pete Sampras used deadly control. But Federer uses serenity as the ultimate tennis weapon, though no doubt every time he uses it he has to pay royalties to Bjorn Borg. 

Borg won 41 grass-court matches in a row, all of them at Wimbledon. Federer has now won 31, although not all at these championships, after dispatching Ivo Minar, of the Czech Republic, 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 Wednesday. 

If Borg were not serene, he might be worrying about that record. Federer is easing himself into the tournament in the manner of a champion. He imposed his serenity on Minar and you could see the way it operated against an inexperienced player. Minar had managed to hold serve on four occasions, but when he was serving to stay in the first set, the serenity got to him. 

One of Federers great talents is to force his opponents to make unforced errors. This is not really a contradiction. Against a player such as Federer ? well, hang on, there arent any. Against Federer, then, you are forced to play outside the areas of your comfort. You must hit that little bit too hard, try that little bit too often to hit the corners or to find that improbable angle. And so the percentages of the game are all against you; the errors must come, and come they do. 

Federer is well aware of this. He has not had much practice of playing against the world No. 1, because it is usually him, but he said that, when you do so, you always feel that if you give him a chance hell take it. Or eventually hes going to lift his game. Once in front, hes not going to give it away. 

That was reading Minar like a book. Mind you, serenity is not a permanent state with Federer. He was, believe it or not, a racket-chucking brat as a boy. He then passed into a state that was too serene for his own good, the fires too deeply buried, but now he seems to have found a balance of fury and calm. And in fact, he had a bit of rant, in his mild way, in the second set, a couple of roars when he failed to take a chance to open Minar up. He even shaped to throw a racket. He lost his temper good and proper two months ago in Miami, when he was two sets and 1-4 down to Rafael Nadal in the final of the Nasdaq-100 Open. 

Plan A, serenity, hadnt worked. So he went to plan B: a real solid racket-throw plus accompanying self-directed rant. It worked. He won. And after Wednesdays brief moment of disgust, he forced Minar into more unforced errors for the second set. Then he dropped a gear, put his foot on the gas and roared into the distance, with an outbreak of tennis of such supreme and sublime perfection that everyone except Minar ? perhaps everyone including Minar ? left No. 1 Court purring. 

There was a moment, my choice for shot of the day, when Federer picked up a ball and returned it to the ball girl at the other end of court. Every other tennis player on the planet does this with a big, shoulder-swinging, flat forehand. Federer sent a fizzing, karate-chopped slice that hung in the air with a curious contempt for gravity. It is always a joy to watch Federer play, even when he is only within easy commuting distance of his best. 

Truly, Federer is the Venice of tennis: il serenissimo. THE TIMES, LONDON

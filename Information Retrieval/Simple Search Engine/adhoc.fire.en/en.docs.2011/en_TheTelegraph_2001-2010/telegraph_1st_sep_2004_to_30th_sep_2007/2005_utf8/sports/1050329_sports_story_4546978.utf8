The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Bengal face SBT today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The red-and-golds were hard in training at the East Bengal ground on Monday. There was an air of earnestness in the team, especially so after their 2-3 home defeat against Sporting Clube de Goa on Saturday. 

However, as usual, coach Subhas Bhowmick is not willing to attach too much importance to the last match?s outcome. ?It was a bad day in office. But East Bengal is still No. 1. We have conceded less goals than all other teams. I?ve nothing to worry about,? Bhowmick said after the practice session on the match-eve. 

As far as their Tuesday?s opponent is concerned, East Bengal shouldn?t worry much about State Bank of Travancore (SBT), who are at present at the bottom of the National Football League for ONGC Cup with nine points from 13 matches. In comparison, East Bengal, despite their defeat, are on 27 points from 13. They are one point behind Dempo, who, however, have played a game more.

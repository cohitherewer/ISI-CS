 England eves need 312 

New Delhi: Indian eves set a huge 311-run target for England after a late rally by the visitors helped them avoid the follow-on on the penultimate day of the one-off Test at the Jamia Millia University grounds here on Wednesday. 

Beth Morgan and Jane Smith scored a crucial 90-run partnership for the ninth wicket in the morning session before the visitors were all out for 154 in 97.4 overs, still trailing by 135 runs. 

India consolidated their lead to 310 when captain Mithali Raj declared their second innings at 175 for four in 61 overs with just 10 overs remaining for the day. 

Charlotte Edwards was batting on two and Laura Newton was on one when play was stopped due to bad light. 

Coach Sudha Shah said the team was confident of a win on Thursday as it was a huge total to chase and the England women would be on the defensive. It is a big total. Our plan was to set a target of 300 plus. We could have scored more runs but our openers took some time to settle down, she said.

 Calcutta: Trainer Harvinder Singh Bath had a dream run on the New Year?s Day. January 1 and the Derby days are two fixtures in the RCTC calendar when every trainer, jockey and owner desires to lead in a winner. Bath struck three ? all priced winners, including Star Magic who won a thriller in the Pailan Group sponsored 1,200m Calcutta Sprinters? Trophy, the chief attraction on the day. 

 The other professional to do well, in the eight-event card, was jockey C. Alford. Apart from helping Bath?s Allenby win the Baba Nauratan Cup, the champion jockey booted home two hot-favourites ? Approved and Absolute Luxury for trainer Vijay Singh -- besides winning on a well-backed Santerelle for the western India schooler Imtiaz Sait. Imtiaz had air-dashed from Mumbai especially to saddle the 2-1 favourite. 

 Less fancied Mayavi had opened Bath?s account in the Baba Trophy with a start-to-finish easy victory.

 Star Magic?s was a belaboured victory in the Sprinters? Trophy despite the fact that he was well clear of the opposition in the final 250 metres. More importantly, his main rival, the 6-4 favourite Evangeline, was having to negotiate a crowded passage in the final furlong after taking a slow start. S. Shanker guided the winner to a long neck victory. Brighter Future was third.

 Another favourite to let down was the debutant Aleksei in the Pailan Gropu Indian Produce Stakes. However, it was more because of the inapt handling of his jockey Alford who failed to settled the half-money favourite during the initial stages of the race. Daniel David?s Retained Asset won a back-to-back race despite his weight disadvantage.

 Another one who made two in-a-row was Daniel?s Noble Investment. A very facile winner in his previous start, the six-year-old had a comfortable measure of his young stablemate La Fantasie who, however, was victim of a bad draw in a big field of 14 runners.

 Failed in classics, Approved claimed the 2,200m Pailan Group Calcutta Gold Vase the way he liked. Settled behind Mythical Star and El Cid till the halfway mark, the Excalibur?s Lake-Our Fantasy son shot into a four-length lead and went on increasing it with every stride.The even-money favourite Absolute Luxury made a winning debut at the age of four in the 1,400m Dharmapal Premchand Trophy over 1,400 metres.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 One who comes closest to him (Bradman) is Sachin: Gilchrist

 - ?I?m certainly not putting myself on a par with him (Sir Don)? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Gilchrist says his ?feet are on the ground? 

 Melbourne: Rodney Marsh 

 may have equated Adam Gilchrist?s destructive-capability 

 with Sir Don Bradman?s, but the Australian vice-captain 

 isn?t even thinking of comparing himself with cricket?s 

 No. 1 icon. 

 ?Some former players have been 

 generous but, really, one has to be careful when bringing 

 Sir Don into the picture... The words have to be chosen 

 with restraint and I?m certainly not putting myself on a 

 par with him,? Gilchrist told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

Speaking at the Grand Hyatt, he added: ?I didn?t see Sir Don bat but, from the footage and everything I?ve heard, the one who comes closest to him is Sachin Tendulkar... I can?t think of anybody else... Moreover, Sir Don himself maintained Sachin?s style reminded him of his own cricket...? 

Gilchrist continued: ?Be it Sachin?s technique, range of shots or temperament, he is fantastic... He can destruct... Has the ability to build an innings... In my time, I haven?t seen anybody better.? 

Many will agree, yet it?s also a fact that given Gilchrist?s proficiency behind the stumps too, many are convinced he has to be acknowledged as an allrounder. 

Talking about his form (he smashed 113 off 120 balls in the just-ended SCG Test versus Pakistan), Gilchrist said: ?Yeah, it has been good... And, when the runs come, praise too comes thick and fast. However, my feet are on the ground as it?s not my nature to get carried away...? 

Asked how much better could he get, Gilchrist smiled: ?I hope I do... Today, though, I can?t tell you by how much... I assume everybody looks to improve and I?m no different.? 

 That?s more bad news for the rest of the world. Gilchrist, 

 after all, is already more than a handful.

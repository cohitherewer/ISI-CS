 Decision on Shoaib next week: PCB

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has said that a decision on Shoaib Akhtar travelling to India for the six-match One-Day International series would be taken next week after receiving a final report from trainer. 

?Our trainer Grant Compton is keeping us updated on a daily basis on the progress being made by Shoaib in recovering from his hamstring injury,? PCB official Subhan Ahmed said. 

?The trainer has been asked to now give a final report on Shoaib?s injury next week and if he says that he is fit to play, he will be considered for the one-day series in India. But if Compton doesn?t give clearance, then Shoaib will be out of contention,? he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. 

When told that Shoaib had himself told the media that his injury was taking time to heal and he would not be available for the Indian tour, the Ahmed maintained that the PCB would go by the its trainer?s report. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has also sent a message to the PCB chairman asking for the complete details on Shoaib?s fitness. 

?I?ve sent an e-mail to Shaharyar (Khan) for a full report on Shoaib. Until now we are not sure what his fitness position is or how much progress he has made from his injury,? Woolmer said.

 Alonso fulfils his destiny

 - A model of consistency with a streak of steel

In the end, Fernando Alonso became Formula One world champion on Sunday with a stroll and not a dash. He was outpaced and outgunned by the twin McLaren Mercedes of Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikkonen in the Brazilian Grand Prix, but Alonso was in no rush. He just did what he has done all season and ground down the opposition with his ruthless efficiency at the wheel. 

He finished third behind Montoya, who won his third Grand Prix of the year, and Raikkonen and that was all he needed to become Spains first Formula One world champion and the sports youngest at 24 years and 58 days (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

Alonso is already talked of as Michael Schumachers natural successor and his ability to withstand the pressure of expectation on Sunday underlined his claim to the seven-time world champions crown. 

Raikkonen needed victory to keep the championship alive but he also needed Alonso to fail ? the one thing that appears not to be in the Spaniards repertoire. He is a model of consistency shot through with a streak of steel and did exactly what he came to Interlagos to do, refusing to be buffeted by a pair of McLarens that are clearly the fastest cars in Formula One ? and by a distance, with Alonso 20 seconds behind at the finish. That has been the case for some time now but clearly nobody has told Alonso that on the way to his championship. 

But the calm and collected manner of his victories was finally dispensed with as he stood on top the podium, officially the fastest driver in the world. He leapt with joy and hugged his teammates as the culmination of more than seven months racing on five continents sunk in. Even a downpour as he collected his trophy could not mar the celebrations. 

 Alonso had no qualms or nerves at the start, flying away from pole position into an immediate lead. If Raikkonen and McLaren Mercedes had believed that the heir to the throne would treat this race with caution, they were wrong as Alonso showed his intent. 

Montoya had been fast throughout the weekend and his superb qualifying performance, starting alongside Alonso, was turned into a strong race as he dived down the inside of the Spaniards Renault to grab a lead he would willingly relinquish later if Raikkonen needed the victory. 

That left Alonso as the meat in a McLaren sandwich as Raikkonen pulled himself into third place. The sight of a McLaren ahead and one appearing menacingly in the wing mirrors might have put off lesser drivers but the calm, almost stoical, approach of Alonso does not allow distractions. 

Pat Symonds, his engineering director, had been asked to sum up Alonsos qualities and came up with this: He has all the same characteristics of a champion. We forget just how young he is because he is so mature, well beyond his age. It is like we are dealing with a guy who has a destiny. He knows that destiny and is totally comfortable with it. 

Although Raikkonen managed to squeeze into second, Alonso sat patiently in third place ? good enough to win the crown and fulfil the destiny that his Renault team seemed to sense was his.

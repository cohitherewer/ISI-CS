 Advani, Mehta crash out

New Delhi: Pankaj Advani and Aditya Mehta crumbled under pressure in the knockout stage of the IBSF world under-21 snooker meet in Manama, Bahrain. 

Advani, who sailed through the league phase with a cent per cent record, went down 3-5 to Michael Lupton of Australia in the last-32 stage, according to information received here. 

Lupton had been beaten by 3-4 Mehta in the league stage. 

The unheralded Mehta went down 4-5 to Robert Stephen of Scotland in the knockout stage. Mehta had a creditable performance in the league stage, losing just one of his seven matches. 

Among the seniors, former world billiards champion Geet Sethi advanced to the knockout stage and will play Cheung Sing of Hong Kong for a place in the quarters.

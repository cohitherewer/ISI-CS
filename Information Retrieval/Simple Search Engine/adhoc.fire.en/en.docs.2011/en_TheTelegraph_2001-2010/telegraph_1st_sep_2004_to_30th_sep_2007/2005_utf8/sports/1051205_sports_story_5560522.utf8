The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Monday, December 05, 2005 

 Hong Kong: Malaysia?s Nicol David became the first Asian woman to win the World Open squash title on Sunday, while Egypt?s Amr Shabana reclaimed the men?s title he first won in 2003. Nicol, 22, overcame top-seeded Australian Rachael Grinham 8-10, 9-2, 9-6, 9-7 to grab her fourth major accolade of 2005.

 Already this year, Nicol was the first home winner of the Malaysian Open, the first Asian woman to take the British Open title, and on Saturday night she learnt she was to become the first Asian world No. 1.

 There was a minor controversy in the men?s final in which Shabana became the first two-time winner since the legendary Pakistani Jansher Khan more than a decade ago. Shabana overcame David Palmer, the 2002 champion 11-6, 11-7, 11-9 but ink from the logo on his racket darkened the ball and made it harder to see. 

 This prompted the Australian to repeat complaints made by England?s Peter Nicol who lost to Shabana in a semi-final.

 Melbourne: Goalkeeper Lisanne De Roever saved Australian Nicole Arrold?s sudden-death penalty to ensure The Netherlands retained their Champions Trophy women?s hockey title in Canberra on Sunday.

 De Roever?s save gave the champions a 5-4 victory on penalties after the match had been scoreless after regulation and sudden-death extra time.

 Australia?s Angie Skirving and The Netherlands? Janneke Schopmann both missed penalty strokes in the shootout to send it into sudden death with the score at 4-4 after five shots each.

 Maartje Paumen converted the first sudden-death penalty then watched as De Roever saved Arrold?s shot and gave The Netherlands their fourth Champions Trophy.

 Melbourne: Australias Robert Allenby won his second successive tournament on home soil with a one-shot victory in the Australian PGA at Coolum in Queensland on Sunday.

 Allenby, who battled a tendon injury in his right hand to win the Australian Open at Moonah Links last week, pipped compatriot Matthew Goggin for the title when he made birdie on the 18th hole to shoot a five-under par 67 and finish on 270.

 Goggin finished on 17-under-par 271. Nathan Green Rod Pampling and Nick OHern finished tied for third on 275, while US Open champion Michael Campbell of New Zealand made a two-over par 74 to finish alone in 13th on 281. 

 Persistent rain and electrical storms severely hampered play on Thursday and Friday, with players having to complete their third round early on Sunday before the final round could begin.

 Pune: African athlethes continued their dominance for the second consecutive year at the 20th Hutch Pune International Marathon on Sunday, with Josephat Ndeti of Kenya bagging the first place in a time of 2::19:35. Second and third positions were bagged by Gemech Kebede (Ethiopia) and Ambrose Makau (Kenya), who clocked 2::20:38 and 2::22:26, respectively. 

 The women?s race was won by Nailya Yulamanov of Russia in 1::00:15 Joyce Kandia (Kenya) and Teringo Gelachew (ethiopia) were second and third in 1::17:05 and 1::20:19, respectively. 

 Jayabhay Dattatraya (2::26:57) and Gurnule Madhuri (1::00.22) were the winners amongst the Indian runners. 

 Stockholm: Changing genes to increase athletic performance, so-called gene doping, will inevitably happen so work has to start now to find tests for such changes, the WADA said on Saturday.

 The agency, in charge of the fight against doping in sport, has called a meeting of about 40 scientists in Sweden?s capital to look at gene therapy and the detection of gene doping.

 ?You would have to be blind not to see that the next generation of doping will be genetic,? WADA chief Dick Pound told a news conference ahead of the conference, the second of its kind on the issue after a WADA meeting in 2002. He said he did not believe gene doping was happening yet, although no one could be sure.

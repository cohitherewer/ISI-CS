 NFL start may be delayed

New Delhi: The start of the 10th National Football League could be delayed with certain clubs raising concerns about the cramped schedule for the first round of matches. 

Some of the clubs that will compete in the premier division have suggested that there should be a longer gap in between matches to prevent players from fatigue and injuries and to allow them adequate time for travelling to venues which are far flung. 

Mahindra United and Mohun Bagan are among teams that have raised concerns about the frequency of matches and asked for them to be spaced out, a top source in the AIFF said. 

There is some mismatch in the dates that the clubs want to be sorted out, he said, adding there was no problem with the availability of venues for the first round of matches. 

The final decision is expected to be taken at an AIFF office-bearers meeting Thursday. The start of the league could be postponed till January 10 instead of the earlier date of January 7. 

We have asked for a bigger gap between matches as we are scheduled to play two matches in three days and three matches in seven, Mahindra United manager Henry Menezes said. (PTI)

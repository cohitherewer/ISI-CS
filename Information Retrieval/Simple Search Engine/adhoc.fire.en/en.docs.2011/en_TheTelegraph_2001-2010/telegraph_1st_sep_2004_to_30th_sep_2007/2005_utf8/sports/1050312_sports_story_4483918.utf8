 Abbas denies coming out of retirement

 Sohail Abbas, however, may come back, if required in 2006 World Cup 

Karachi: Former penalty corner specialist of Pakistan Sohail Abbas on Friday denied Pakistan Hockey Federation?s (PHF) claim that he had come out of his international retirement. 

?I dont think that is true. I am a retired player and I haven?t informed the PHF that I have come out of it,? Abbas said. 

Earlier, the chairman of Pakistan hockey selections panel, Chaudhry Akhtar Rasool told a news conference that Abbas and Wasim Ahmed had reversed their last December?s decisions. 

?I don?t know why they announced that but I have not reversed my decision. If the PHF says I have given it in writing, then what can I say? I have not said anything verbally, what to talk of giving in writing,? Abbas said. 

However, the world record holder for highest number of goals left open one door for his comeback. ?I have always insisted that if the team or the country requires me, I will be available for major tournament. And I maintain that.? 

?The major can be 2006 World Cup,? he replied when asked what he meant by it. 

On his experience of playing Premier Hockey League in India for Hyderabad Sultans, Abbas said ?it was absolutely fascinating. The hospitality, love, appreciation, recognition and praise I received is something I will cherish for the rest of my life.? 

?Not for a second did it feel to me that I was not playing in Pakistan. It was awesome.?

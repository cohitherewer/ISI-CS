 Alonso stands on cusp of history

 - Brazilian grand prix 

London: Third place is all 24-year-old Spaniard Fernando Alonso needs in Brazil this weekend to take his place in history as Formula Ones youngest champion. Even then, the six points may be superfluous. Should McLarens Kimi Raikkonen be forced to retire at Interlagos, the drivers championship will be over. 

The Renault racer leads his Finnish rival by 25 points, with just two grands prix and a maximum 20 points remaining after Sunday. 

Alonso, whose calm under pressure has been impressive all season, has vowed to go for victory rather than taking a strategic approach in a race that has thrown up a few surprises over the years. 

Two years ago he brought proceedings to a premature close after crashing heavily, yet despite being taken to hospital still ended up being awarded third place. I am quite close now to the championship, but I approach this race like any other, said the Spaniard, winner of six of the 16 races so far. 

We have been quick in Brazil in recent years, and now our car is even stronger in every area. So I am looking forward to the race. 

As always, I go there trying to do the maximum. Whats the point of going to a race and only aiming for a podium? You cant do that, you have to want to be the best, to attack. So thats what I am going to Brazil to do, he added. (Reuters)

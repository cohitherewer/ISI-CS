 Ahmed said the welcome funds will be used to build up a good team for the NFL and improve ground and gallery conditions so that the team can play at least the local league matches at home. He also announced that all players and coaches will be insured (for life) for Rs 1.5 lakh each and medical insurances made for Rs 50,000 each. Unveiling the new team jersey, Ahmed revealed that Dhaka Md. Sporting have sent those for the Calcutta team.

 Bhaichung Bhutia?s contract with East Bengal for the ensuing season will be ready on Tuesday. After days of uncertainty, the striker has verbally agreed to don the red-and-gold jerseys from October 1 to May 2006.

Bhaichung, who will be offered more or less the same amount of money as last year, left for Delhi on Monday to get his Malaysian visa done.

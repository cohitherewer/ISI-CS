 Raleigh (North Carolina): US sprinter Mickey Grimes has been suspended for two years after testing positive for the anabolic steroid norandrosterone, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said on Friday.

 Grimes, 28, a former Pan American Games 100m champion, accepted the ban after a May 25, 2004 out-of-competition sample tested positive, USADA said in a news release.

 It was the second doping violation for Grimes, a training partner of former world record holder Maurice Greene.

 Grimes lost his 2003 Pan American Games title after testing positive for the stimulant ephedrine. He received a public warning.

 Sao Paulo: Kenya?s Robert Cheruiyot strode to victory in the annual 15km Sao Silvestre road race for the second time in three years on Friday amid unprecedented security.

 Cheruiyot broke away as the runners passed the Municipal Theatre, 2.5 km from the finish, and then made light of the punishing 1,500m Brigadeiro hill to finish 23 seconds ahead of Ethiopia-born Australian Sisay Bezabeh.

 An estimated 13,000 runners took part in the race which has been run through the streets of Latin America?s largest city every New Year?s Eve since 1925.

 London: Is beach volleyball better in Central Park or beside the Eiffel Tower? Are Olympic venues more scenic alongside the Moscow river or the Thames? Would the world?s best athletes rather eat bagels on the upper west side or tapas in Madrid?

 Those and other questions might be addressed if the first TV debate in Olympic bid history comes off, featuring senior figures from the five cities vying for the 2012 Summer Games. The debate would be broadcast by BBC World.

 The date, site and guests for the proposed debate have not yet been decided, BBC world spokesman Kevin Young said on Friday. The format most likely would involve each bid leader presenting his case, with a panel later asking questions.

 ?It?s obviously a good thing for all of the cities,? New York 2012 spokesman Michael Moran said in a telephonic interview.

 Tokyo: Ten-man Tokyo Verdy beat holders Jubilo Iwata 2-1 in a grudge final to lift the Emperor?s Cup for the second time on Saturday.

 Strikers Kazunori Iio and Kazuki Hiramoto were on target for once-mighty Verdy, whose midfielder Yoshiyuki Kobayashi was shown a red card for his second bookable offence just before halftime.

 Norihiro Nishi pulled one back in the 78th minute but Verdy held out despite late Jubilo pressure.

 While no longer the force they were in the mid-1990s, Verdy dominated in chilly Tokyo, Iio breaking the deadlock in the 36th minute, tapping in after Hiramoto?s header hit the post. Hiramoto added a second in the 54th minute with a fine solo effort. Nishi pounced after confusion in the Verdy defence to give Jubilo a lifeline.

 Barcelona: Debutant Robby Gordon became the first US driver to win a Dakar Rally stage in a car on Friday?. The Volkwagen driver completed the 6 km special stage around the beach of Castelldefels in 4:20 seconds.

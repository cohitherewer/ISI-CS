Napier: Fledgling Test cricketer Hamish Marshall added a second Test century to his blossoming credentials as New Zealand built a solid base in the first Test against Sri Lanka here Monday. 

Marshall, who began the day with an impressive average of 54 from five Tests, was unbeaten on 133 when bad light brought an early end to play with New Zealand on 267 for three. Nathan Astle was 37 not out, adding an unbroken 80 with Marshall in 17 overs for the fourth wicket. 

After a pedestrian first session when New Zealand reached 61 for one off 29 overs, they added 114 off 30 overs in the middle two hours and 82 in the final session before play was called off with six scheduled overs remaining. 

Hamish and his identical twin James laid a sound base for the New Zealand innings, coming together after the early dismissal of Craig Cumming and putting on 107 in 140 minutes before James was caught for 52 off the bowling of leg-spinner Upul Chandana. 

It was James? highest score in just his third Test innings.

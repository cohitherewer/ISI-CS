 Injuries plague Bengal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Injuries to some key players continue to haunt Bengal as the 29-time champions reached Kochi on Thursday evening. 

Bengal will start their campaign in the Santosh Trophy quarter final league stage on Sunday when they face Maharashtra. But there are little signs of recovery for Subhas Chakraborty, Madhab Das and Noel Wilson. 

Subhas has got a groin injury? its unlikely that he will be fit to play against Maharashtra, goalkeeper coach Biswajit Das informed from Kochi on Thursday. 

Chief coach Aloke Mukherjee also expressed concerns over the right-halfs injury. 

The team is yet to get into a groove. Weve called a practice session on Friday morning and the organisers have promised us a good practice ground, Das maintained.

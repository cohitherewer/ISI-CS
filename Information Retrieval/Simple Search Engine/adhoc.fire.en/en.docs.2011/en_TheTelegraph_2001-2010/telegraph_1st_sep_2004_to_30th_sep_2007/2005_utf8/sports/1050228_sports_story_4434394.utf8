 Chinese are very resilient: Paes

 Leander Paes 

New Delhi: India will start clear favourites in their Davis Cup tie against China given their players? strength on grass, captain Leander Paes said on Sunday. 

?We are definitely favourites to win on grass. Prakash Amritraj?s game is tailormade for grass, my record speaks for itself and even Harsh (Mankad) has a game which can be very useful on grass. So we are really the favourites,? Paes said after the team?s training session here. 

Paes was joined by Amritraj and reserve player Karan Rastogi on Sunday while Mankad, who has arrived in the capital but opted to take a day off, and Mahesh Bhupathi are expected to begin training from Monday. 

The Indian captain, however, was quick to point out that they would need to be at their best despite the surface advantage against the resilient Chinese. ?The Chinese are very resilient. They are very quick and never give up. So we will need to be at our best on the weekend.? 

Coach Nandan Bal was also of the view that India will have an upper hand over the Chinese given the fact that the matches would be played on grass. ?Most Chinese are baseline players and none of them really play the serve and volley game.? (PTI)

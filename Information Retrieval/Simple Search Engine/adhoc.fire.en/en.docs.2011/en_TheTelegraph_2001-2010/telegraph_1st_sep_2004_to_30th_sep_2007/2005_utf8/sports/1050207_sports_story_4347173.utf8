 ?I haven?t changed my action? 

 Balaji 

Mumbai: Lakshmipathi Balaji, who is on a comeback trail after a three-month lay-off due to an abdomen injury, Sunday said he has not changed his bowling action but only made a small adjustment on the advice of Australian great Dennis Lillee. 

Dismissing reports that he has changed his action, Balaji said: ?I have not changed my action, but have only cut down on my final jump (before delivering the ball) under advice from Lillee.? 

?I am fully fit and feeling much better. I am free from the pain induced by ostieis pubis (pelvic bone inflammation) for the last month or so and have started bowling in the nets three weeks ago,? the Tamil Nadu fast bowler said. 

?Lillee, who personally suffered from the same problem, told me how he got over the problem and helped me overcome the injury,? said Balaji, who will be playing his first match after the recovery for India Senior against India A in the N. K. P. Salve Challenger series commencing Monday. 

?I was disappointed to miss the home series against Australia and South Africa. But injuries are part and parcel of any sportsman?s career. I know i have to work hard on my fitness. 

?It is a huge challenge for me to get back into the Indian team. 

?Every match is a big challenge and I am determined to give 100 per cent effort,? he said.

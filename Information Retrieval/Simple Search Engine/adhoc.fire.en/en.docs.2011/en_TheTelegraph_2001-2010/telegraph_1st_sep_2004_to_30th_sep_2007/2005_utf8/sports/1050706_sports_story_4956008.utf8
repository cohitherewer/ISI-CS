The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Venue satisfies WTA supervisor

 Mahesh Bhupathi in the city on Tuesday

Calcutta: WTA Tour supervisor Giulia Orlandi seemed satisfied with the Netaji Indoor Stadium, the venue of the Sunfeast Open from September 19-23. 

Renovation work is on in full swing to get the venue ready for the biggest womens tennis event in the city. I hope the work will be completed within two months, Orlandi said after inspecting the indoor stadium on Tuesday afternoon. 

They have put up a new roof which seems to be of top quality? even the seating arrangements look great even though a part of it is not complete, said Orlandi, adding that there will be another inspection after a month. 

Well have two courts inside the stadium and three practice courts outside (at the Khudiram Anushilan Kendra) will be enough, Orlandi stated. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, whose management company is organising the meet with the state government, is still not in a position to name the top players who will be taking part in the $170,000 prize-money meet. 

Talks are on, I hope to finalise the list after next weeks Fed Cup semis, Bhupathi said. 

According to a source, Russians Anastasia Myskina (the 2004 French Open champion) and the talented Nadia Petrova, as well as 2005 French Open runner-up and Bhupathis Wimbledon-winning partner Mary Pierce may be in the field. 

Russia clash with the US and France meet Spain in the semis. 

The final is just a week before the Calcutta meet, hence a clearer picture will emerge only after the semi-final results are known.

 PCB shouldnt have bowed to ECB: Miandad

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad has criticised his countrys cricket authorities for allowing England to play just one match in Karachi. 

It would have been better to scrap the tour, Miandad said on Saturday. The (Pakistan Cricket) Board has not done any service to the country by bowing to the pressure of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The board has to take a stand or the image of Pakistan and Karachi will continue to suffer as touring sides dictate where they want to play. 

England rejected proposals to play a Test or two one-dayers in the volatile port city because of security concerns but have agreed to play a one-dayer in Karachi on December 15. 

Miandad said Pakistan should have told the ECB to play more matches in Karachi or face a boycott by Pakistan of their scheduled tour to England next year. 

He added the attacks in London on July 7 had shown no country or city was safe. 

Every cricket playing nation has a duty to give the message: We are not going to be deterred, said Miandad. 

When our government is assuring them of the best security arrangements, there is no justification for their concerns about Karachi.

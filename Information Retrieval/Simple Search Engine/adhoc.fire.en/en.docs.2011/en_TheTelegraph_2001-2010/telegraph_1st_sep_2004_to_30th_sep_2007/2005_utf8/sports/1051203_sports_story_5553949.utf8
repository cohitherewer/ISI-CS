 Pak captain suspended

Chennai: Pakistan hockey team received a jolt ahead of the Champions Trophy here later this month as captain Mohammed Saqlain was slapped a three match suspension and fined 1,000-euros for dangerous conduct on the field during a match against Australia earlier this year. 

Saqlain was involved in an incident at a Hamburg meet with Australias Craig Victory, who suffered a broken jaw and other facial injuries. 

At the hearing held at the FIH office in Lausanne last Sunday, Saqlain was found guilt of deliberately raising his stick at the Hamburg Masters Championship in August. He was found guilty of dangerous conduct. (PTI)

London: Venus Williams beat fellow American Lindsay Davenport 4-6, 7-6, 9-7 to win the Wimbledon womens singles title for the third time Saturday. 

Venus outlasted the top seed and world number one in the longest womens final in the tournaments history to win her first Grand Slam title since the US Open of 2001 and a fifth in all. 

The 25-year-old, who also won Wimbledon in 2000 and 2001 before losing the next two finals to her sister Serena, has suffered from poor form over the last two years and was seeded 14th in the draw, making her the lowest seed to win the title in Wimbledon history. 

Davenport, the Wimbledon champion in 1999, also lost when the two players met in the 2000 final and has now failed to win a Grand Slam since her Australian Open triumph earlier that same year. 

Venus, who was playing in her fifth final in six years at the All-England Club, started nervously under sullen skies on Centre Court. 

Davenport took advantage of two double-faults by Venus to break her for 2-1 when the elder Williams sister blazed a backhand long and consolidated to lead 4-2 before breaking again. 

Venus slipped to 15-40 and the world number one slapped away a forehand volley to lead 5-2. Davenport immediately lost serve to love, however, and a suddenly dominant Venus held to love to reduce the arrears to 5-4. 

The younger player could not sustain her revival, however, and Davenport made no mistake in her next service game, taking the set with a heavy serve which Venus could only net. It was the first set Venus, who upset defending champion Maria Sharapova in the semi-finals, had lost in her run to the final. 

Davenport, 29, saved a break point at 1-2 in the second set and a shaky-looking Venus saved two in the next game. 

The rallies became longer, however, as Venus started to find her range down both flanks. 

At 4-4 Davenport was incensed when a serve from her opponent that appeared to be well wide was called in. She vent her frustration at the umpire but to no avail and Venus held to love. 

Davenport was momentarily rattled and had to save a set point after double-faulting in the next game before holding for 5-5. 

Venus suddenly trailed 0-40, saved one break point but slipped in the backcourt to go 6-5 down, leaving Davenport to serve for the match. 

The older American faltered, however, losing serve to love as Venus went for broke and she continued in the same vein to go 5-1 up in the tie-break before taking it 7-4 with a clubbing forehand. 

Despite the setback Davenport started the third set looking the more confident and Venus cracked at 2-3 under siege from Davenports heavy groundstrokes, spraying a forehand out to lose serve. 

Davenport, though, was suffering pain in her lower back and lost her next serve from leading 40-15 before calling the trainer for treatment. She then left the court for further attention. 

When she returned, Davenport was moving gingerly but bravely held to go 5-4 up, leaving Venus to serve to stay in the match. She promptly double-faulted to gift Davenport a match point but saved it with a crunching backhand winner before holding serve. 

Despite her evident suffering, Davenport kept holding serve until 7-7 when Venus finally broke her compatriots resolve. 

Serving for the match at last, Venus took victory on her second match point when Davenport netted a forehand to end her run of five Grand Slam final defeats in two hours 45 minutes.

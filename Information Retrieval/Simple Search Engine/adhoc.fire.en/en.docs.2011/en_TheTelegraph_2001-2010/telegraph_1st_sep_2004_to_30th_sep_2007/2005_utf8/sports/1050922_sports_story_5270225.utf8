 NZ school team to play in city

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: A visiting team of New Zealand schoolchildren will take on their counterparts in the city in friendly rugby matches on Thursday. Calcutta Police are behind the initiative, which will eventually see their team to be trained under the New Zealander Willy Harakata. 

Informing this on Wednesday, Zulfikar Hassan, joint commissioner (AP), said on Wednesday that a combined team of the city schools would take on the visiting New Zealand students in three matches at Alipore Bodyguard Lines. 

These are purely exhibition ties, aimed at generating interest in rugby among the students, Hassan said. The city commissioner Prasun Mukherjee played a leading role in making the matches possible. 

Harakata will come to train the Calcutta Police team after Durga Puja.

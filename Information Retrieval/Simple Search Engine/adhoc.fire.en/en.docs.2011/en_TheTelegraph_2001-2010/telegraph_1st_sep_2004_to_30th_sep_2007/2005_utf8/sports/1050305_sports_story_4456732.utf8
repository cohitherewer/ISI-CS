 Draw points to Great Strides? chance in star sprint 

TITAN BOY

Focus shifts to Chennai this weekend when racing in 

all zonal turf clubs comes to a standstill. It?s Madras Race Club?s (MRC) turn 

to host the annual horseracing festival and all regional champions, almost over 

all significant trips, are invited by the MRC to test their potential in racing 

baron MAM Ramaswamy?s back yard.

 Indian horseracing has come a long way. Although stallions and broodmares are still imported to upgrade the local stock, there is no denying that Indian breed has also been making news beyond the country?s border. The days of super stars are, therefore, over, and each big race manages to produce a new winner. It?s a good news for followers of the sport, and also for the breeding industry.

 On Saturday, speed will be the essence. The 1,200m race has a history of producing shock results and it may not come as a surprise if The Hindu Sprinters? Cup keeps the tradition. At least six of the 15 in the line up are in a with a chance despite their poor draw ? an amazing thing.

 Nevertheless, a cursory glance at the field suggests that Great Strides will be the horse to beat and the likes of Antarctic Zones, Hawke Bays, River Gods, Blue Horizons and Star Qualities are his main challengers. The Ramaswamy-owned five-year-old not only has both form and speed by his side, he is also drawn three, and it may make the task of Greensmith-First One Home son that much easier. B. Prakash partners the Dallas Todywalla-trainee.

 Again, in Chennai, one cannot help but look out for MAM?s runners when spotting winners. Draw does not play any role over the gruelling trips but the condition of the outer course would matter in the 3,000m Poonawalla Stud Farms Stayers? Cup. MAM?s Star Of Windsor is, however, no mean a galloper. The Steinbeck-Wondering Star five-year-old is blessed with plenty of stamina. The S. Ganapathy-ward, who will also be partnered by Prakash, may have a comfortable measure of Road Runner and Baffert.

 Shining Gem is the one who may be hard to toss in the Capricorn-Chanhill Stud Farm Trophy, the weekend opener. The speedy three-year-old filly by Don?t Forget Me out of Quality Exchange is a half-sister to Star Qualities who runs with a great chance in the Sprinters? Cup. Mark Gallagher will guide the fortune of the Ganapathy-trainee. Ganapathy?s Amazing Striker, also a very promising youngster, may not disappoint in the 1,400m Ghatala Cup.

 A wide Open field

 - I love it when it gets tough: Sharapova

New York: Maria Sharapova was all over New York the past few days, unveiling her new perfume, showing off the diamond-encrusted watch she designed, making TV show appearances and modelling her latest tennis dress. 

Serena Williams, meanwhile, made a TV appearance, too, and gave a sneak peek of her new lip gloss, which wont even be available until next spring. 

All that, and the US Open hasnt yet started. 

Obviously theyre more sexy, lets say, they show more skin, all these sorts of things, and they talk more about that than actually their forehand and backhand. Weve been asked much more about, whats your preparation? Hows your backhand doing? said Roger Federer, who, for the record, does have his own cosmetics line. 

I get one question about fashion basically, Federer said on Saturday. Thats how it goes with us. But I think thats how it should be, to be honest. 

Make no mistake, though, the women have the groundstrokes to go with their glitz. 

While Federer is the odds-on favourite on the mens side ? hes 64-3 this year and has won 22 straight finals ? the womens tournament is wide open ? Sharapova, Serena Williams, Venus, winner of Wimbledon last month, Lindsay Davenport, Kim Clijsters, Amelie Mauresmo, Justine Henin-Hardenne, defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. Any of them may win it, and theres a handful of others who could make things interesting. 

That makes it tougher, but thats what its all about, said Sharapova, who will play one of the featured night matches when the tournament begins on Monday. Thats why were here, for the competition. Thats why Im here. I love it when it gets tough. 

Sharapova will lose her No. 1 ranking to Davenport on Monday after only a week at the top spot. Davenport had been No. 1 since last October, and she will reclaim it after beating Mauresmo in New Haven on Saturday. 

But Sharapova will still be the top seed at the Open because the draw was done on Wednesday. 

Sharapova was a surprise winner at Wimbledon in 2004. She says she was still on a high when she came to New York. She promptly lost in the third round. Since then, though, shes won six titles in the last 12 months. Shes 43-7 this year, and has reached the semi-finals or better in eight of her last 11 WTA Tour events. 

Sharapova hasnt played in almost three weeks because of a strained chest muscle. She has been doing physical therapy and strengthening exercises. 

Serena said shes feeling better than she has in months. The two-time Open winner missed the French with a left ankle injury, and hasnt done much since. This is definitely as good as Ive felt in a while. Im hitting better than I have in two years, said Serena. Im obviously not moving as I normally do, but Im almost there. Hopefully Ill pick up steam later on in the second week. (AP)

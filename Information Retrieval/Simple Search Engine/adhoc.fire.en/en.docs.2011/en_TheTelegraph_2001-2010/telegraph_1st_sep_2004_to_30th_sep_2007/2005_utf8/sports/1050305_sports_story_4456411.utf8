 Randhawa in, Atwal out

 Randhawa 

Dubai: Jyoti Randhawa recovered from his first-round blues to bring in a fine card of four-under 68 that catapulted him into the top 25, while Arjun Atwal struggled once again and tumbled out of the $2.2 million Dubai Desert Classic at the Emirates Golf Club. 

After two rounds, Randhawa is now four-under for the tournament, he had a par round on first day, while Atwal finished with rounds of 73 and 74 for a total of three-over and made his third exit in as many appearances here. 

Miguel Angel Jimenez, who knocked in a round of 65, took a two-shot lead to be at 12-under for 36 holes. 

Following him was overnight leader Ernie Els, who once again played error-free golf for a round of 68 with four birdies and no bogeys. Els, who had a 66 on first day. 

Randhawa came out smiling after five birdies and one bogey, and said: ?I was pretty satisfied and I played solid. A few putts got away, but I putted much better and was good off the tee. I was a little unhappy with my par round, but at four-under after two rounds, I am okay. 

Atwal, two-time winner on the European Tour, said: ?Somehow this golf course just does not work for me. All these doglegs seem to get me. My game was just not getting on. I did not hit well and also had a tough time on the greens. Maybe, I should stick to the United States.?Randhawa has had a good season on the European Tour with his second place finish at Malaysian Open and he had another finish in the 30s at the Singapore Masters. 

A finish inside top-20 will seal his European card for 2006. (PTI)

 Sahaj, Srinath emerge best 

Belfort: Sahaj Grover created history by clinching the under-10 title of the World Youth Chess championships that concluded here. 

N. Srinath got a bit lucky on the final day and also won the gold medal in the under-12 section after losing his last-round game against So Wesley. 

His nearest contender Sjugirov Sanan had to settle for a draw in his final against Ray Robson, giving the Indian his first gold medal in a world championship. 

Sahaj drew his 11th and final game with Jakhongir Vakhidov of Uzbekistan and moved to nine points along with Ivan Bushkavin of Russia and was declared the winner, thanks to his much superior tie-break score. 

Along with the gold and glory, Sahaj also became the youngest ever Indian to win any world championship, breaking the 1996 record set by current world junior champion P. Harikrishna. 

WGM D. Harika, however, proved to be the biggest disappointment. In the under-16 girls section, she finished fifth. IM Parimarjan Negi also failed, finishing ninth overall in the boys under-12 boys. (PTI)

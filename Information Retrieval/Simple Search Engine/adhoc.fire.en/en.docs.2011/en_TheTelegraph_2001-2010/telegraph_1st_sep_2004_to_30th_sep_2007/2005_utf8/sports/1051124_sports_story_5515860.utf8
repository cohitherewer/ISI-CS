Faisalabad: England snapped up three late wickets to leave Pakistan on a shaky 183 for six at stumps on the fourth day of the second Test on Wednesday, an overall lead of 199 runs. 

Andrew Flintoff removed Mohammad Yousuf (20) and Shahid Afridi (0) off successive balls before Steve Harmison dismissed Kamran Akmal (9). 

Captain Inzamam-ul-Haq was batting on 41 when play ended 16 overs early due to bad light. 

Flintoffs spell of two for 15 from seven overs after tea has given England an outside chance of an upset win. 

Pakistan lead the three-match series after winning the first Test in Multan by 22 runs. 

The allrounder said he had to convince captain Michael Vaughan to let him continue bowling. 

I asked for one more over as the ball was reverse-swinging a bit more and I was running in nicely, Flintoff said. 

It is hard work out there and I dont want to make any predictions, he added when asked about Englands chances of levelling the series. 

Flintoff forced Yousuf to play on to his stumps. He then silenced the roaring capacity crowd with a fantastic ball that pitched in sharply to send Afridis off-stump cartwheeling. 

A wicket like him is good for you, Flintoff said. He is the sort of player who can take the game away from you very quickly. It was crucial to get him out quickly. 

Afridi had provided much of the entertainment in the first innings with a blistering 92 off 85 balls and after his first-ball dismissal on Wednesday, the majority of the crowd left the stadium. 

Harmison then had Akmal caught-behind in the final over of the day as Pakistan lost their last five wickets for 79 runs.

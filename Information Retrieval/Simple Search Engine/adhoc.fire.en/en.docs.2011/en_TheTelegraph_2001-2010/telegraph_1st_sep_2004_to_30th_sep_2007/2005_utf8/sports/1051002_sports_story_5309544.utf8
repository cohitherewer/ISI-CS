 Follow new norms or pay up, says ECB

 - Each County has to field at least 9 England-qualified players 

Martin Searby

Counties failing to field enough England-qualified players next season stand to lose thousands of pounds in revenue, and the penalties are set to increase sharply the following year. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board is to withhold cash from the annual hand-out unless Counties use at least nine of their XI as England-qualified players. In effect they will be fined ?85 for each non-qualified player above the permitted two per one-day game and ?340 per County Championship match. 

The penalties look light but in the following season, 2007, there will be a sharp rise, with limited over games costing ?275 per player and ?1,100 in the premier competition. 

As an illustration of the costs of the non-qualified players, Hampshire, runners-up in the championship, played as many as six in three of their Championship games and would have faced losing ?15,300 from their hand-out in addition to ?6,120 in the one-dayers. 

In 2007, the same scenario would cost them ?49,500 in the Championship and ?19,800 in the limited over games. While a total revenue loss of ?21,420 in 2006 and ?69,300 in 2007 may not damage a County like Hampshire, lesser clubs would be in trouble. 

Northamptonshire, for example, would have forfeited ?16,150 ? ?3,910 in one-day games, ?12,240 in Championship ? for 2006, but that would leap to ?52,250 in 2007. 

Derbyshire, another small County favouring non-England players, would also be in trouble. 

Tom Sears, the chief executive, said: We will be looking to play nine English qualified players next season because we simply could not afford the drop in income that not doing so would mean. 

The penalties dont look too damaging for next year, but counties who havent put their houses in order could feel them bite the year after. The big clubs may not be too badly affected, but the smaller ones will feel the pinch. 

John Carr, the ECBs director of operations, said: We prefer to look at it as a reward for clubs providing valuable video footage of as many potential England players as possible rather than a penalty for those who dont, and we are satisfied that all parts of our performance related payments conform to current European law.

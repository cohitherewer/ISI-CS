 All hail Alonso, new king of track

 - A little frustrating not to have won more times than Kimi 

 KEVIN GARSIDE IN SHANGHAI

Queen provided the soundtrack to Fernando Alonsos season. The world champion gave an emotional rendition of We are the Champions on the Renault team radio as he took the chequered flag, his seventh victory of the year, equalling Kimi Rakkonens haul and securing the double of constructors as well as drivers title for the French manufacturer. 

The travelling Asturians, that swelling band of Alonso fanatics from northern Spain, were also in splendid voice as they welcomed their hero into the paddock. How they got there was a question that at other times would have exercised Formula Ones crack security cordon. Maybe, like Michael Schumacher, who crashed on the way to the grid and later spun out of the race, the officials were having a bad day. 

Raikkonen, who took a straightforward second place, caught the mood of celebration, offering his congratulations to a worthy champion. That, too, was a happy departure at McLaren, where team principal Ron Dennis has been, in the opinion of many, not generous enough in his praise of Alonso. 

Alonsos electric displays in Japan and here utterly fried Denniss argument that Raikkonen is the better man. In absolute terms it would not be fair to elevate Alonso above Raikkonen, either. But this has been the Spaniards year. He described this win as his easiest. He led from start to finish, despite the introduction of the safety car, which in the first instance cut at a stroke his lead of 20 seconds built over 18 blistering laps. 

In the event Alonsos misfortune was offset by that of the luckless Juan Pablo Montoya. The Colombian ran over an upturned drain cover, damaging his front left tyre, suspension and floor to prompt the appearance of the safety car for six laps. Montoya bolted into the pits to change the tyre but retired a lap later, taking the steam out of the fight for the constructors title. 

We only used full power on the engine in the first part. The race was actually very easy, Alonso said. We showed today that the car had the potential to win more races this season. In that respect its a little frustrating not to have won more times than Kimi. 

Renault ended the season as they started it, the better team. By claiming the front row in qualifying, Renault struck a mighty blow to McLaren morale. 

And as the race proceeded, Giancarlo Fisichella gave a masterclass in holding up the opposition while Alonso disappeared. 

Team principal Flavio Briatore said: To come here this weekend and dominate the race shows we have done the job right this year. We have shown speed and reliability. This is a dream team. 

That was how Michael Schumacher and his colleagues at Ferrari used to be described. Not yesterday. Schumachers comic lapse as he journeyed to the grid at the start of the race summed up the Scuderias year. 

The seven-time world champion drifted off line like a novice into the path of the advancing Minardi of Christijan Albers, who is a novice. The Dutchman mounted Schumachers Ferrari from the left, shredding the rear tyre and leaving the front hanging by a thread. 

The incident earned an official reprimand for Schumacher, not that he needed a rap across the knuckles to top his day. Resuming in the spare Ferrari, Schumacher spun into the gravel at turn eight while in 10th place, warming his brakes behind the safety car. No wonder he kept his helmet on as he walked back to the pits. 

After Schumacher, Jenson Button was arguably the seasons biggest loser. He ended the final race of his dismal year in eighth place, unable to make any impression after losing ground during the first round of pit stops. Button left the circuit looking forward not back, promising no end of industry in the winter to turn things around. 

Its been a long, hard season for all of us, he said. We didnt make the step up we expected here. My thoughts are already turning to 2006. I think we have a lot to look forward to next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sri Lankans arrive on October 25

 - AGM in Calcutta on Sept. 22, 23 

New Delhi: India will host Sri Lanka for seven one-dayers from October 25 to November 12 and play a five-game series against visiting South Africa from November 15 to 29, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said after its working committee meeting. Sri Lanka return to play three Tests from December 1 to 22. 

India tour Pakistan from January 2 to February 11 for a Test and one-day series and would stay back to play in the Asia Cup, to be played from February 14 to 28. 

England will play three Tests and seven one-dayers during their tour of India early next year. England, who last played Tests in India in 2001, are scheduled to play the Tests between March 6 and 30 and the one-dayers from April 1 to 23. 

The other matters discussed and decisions taken at the meeting were: 

 The Boards revenue might have taken a hit due to the legal wrangle over telecast rights last year, but the players have stood to gain through their 26 per cent share of the gross earnings. The draft annual report and audited accounts for the year 2004-05, approved by the working committee, saw Indias cricketers receive nearly Rs 52 crore as their share of income. Of this, Rs 26 crore went to the international players, Rs 21 crore to the senior domestic cricketers while the junior cricketers stand to get Rs 5 crore. 

 A decision was reached to form an elite panel of referees to supervise the senior domestic tourneys. Another committee would be set up by the president to find a permanent media manager for the national team. 

 The AGM will be held on September 22 and 23 in Calcutta. 

 Amitabh Choudhary, the Jharkhand State Cricket Association president, will be the manager of the Indian team on their upcoming tour of Zimbabwe. This will be his first assignment with Team India. In late 2003, he went as the Under-19 manager to Pakistan. 

 There will be elite and plate divisions in the under-17 national championship for the Vijay Merchant Trophy. 

 A decision on the issue of merging Womens Cricket Association with the BCCI, was once again deferred. 

 A sensitive issue that was smoothly dealt with was that of the Goa Cricket Associations return to mainstream. The GCA was suspended and its share of money frozen in 2001 following the controversy over poor conduct and irregularities during a one-day International against Australia. (Agencies)

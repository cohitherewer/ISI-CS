 Jeev tied 19th 

Kochi (Japan): A second successive round of one-under 71 saw Jeev Milkha Singh lying tied 19th at the halfway stage in 140 million yen Casio World Open at the Kochi Kuroshio Country Club. 

The field was led by four players with Toshimitsu Izawa, T. Suzuki, T. Teshima and M. Osani, all placed at six-under after two rounds. 

Jeev began well with birdies on the 10th and 13th, but a bogey on 16th set him back. However, a birdie on the par-five 18th saw him make the turn at two-under. On the front nine, jeev bogeyed second and ninth, but birdied the fourth for a total of 71. 

Michelle Wie, making her first appearance in Japan, failed to make the cut by one stroke after carding a second round of 75 to go with a 73. 

The 16-year-old Hawaiian bogeyed her last two holes in a second-round to finish at four-over-par 148. 

The bogeys I made were pretty stupid, said a tearful Wie. I wish I couldve prevented that but obviously it was not meant to be. (Agencies)

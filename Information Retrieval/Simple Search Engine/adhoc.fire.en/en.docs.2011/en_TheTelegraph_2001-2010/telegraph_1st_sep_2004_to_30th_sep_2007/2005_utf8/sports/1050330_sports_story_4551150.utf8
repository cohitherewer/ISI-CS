The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dhoni set to open with Shikhar Dhawan

 - Pak vs INDIA A 

- Third seamer?s role likely for Ranadeb teams

 Ranadeb Bose 

Hyderabad: After pulling off a spectacular win in Bangalore to level the Test series, a rejuvenated Pakistan would shift their focus to the shorter version when they take on India A in a one-day warm-up match at the newly built Visakha Stadium here on Wednesday. 

The Pakistanis, scheduled to play a six-match one-day series starting in Kochi on Saturday, would be keen to use the opportunity to test some of their one-day specialists, who are yet to get a chance to play on the tour so far. 

[A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu and Sanjib Sanyal are likely to be left out of the final XI. According to a source, Rudra Pratap Singh and Amit Bhandari will share the new ball, while Bengal mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose is set to be the third seamer. Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Shikhar Dhawan will open the innings.] 

In focus would be Shoaib Malik, an allrounder who has been a cause of worry for the Indians in the one-dayers of late. 

Malik, who is already in news for his marriage to city girl Aiyesha, would be keen to test his batting form ahead of the one-day series. 

Yousuf Youhana will also be the player to watch out 

for while crowd favourite Shahid Afridi has always been the centre of attraction 

in this city. (PTI)

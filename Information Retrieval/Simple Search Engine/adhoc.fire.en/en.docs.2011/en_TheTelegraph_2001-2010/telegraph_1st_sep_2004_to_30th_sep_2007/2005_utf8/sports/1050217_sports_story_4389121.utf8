The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A disgrace, says ex-Gunner Merson

 CHRISTOPHER DAVIES 

 Wenger says he doesn?t look at players? passports while picking the team 

Paul Merson, the former Highbury favourite, led the criticism of his former club Tuesday after Arsenal named an entire squad of overseas players for their Premiership match against Crystal Palace on Monday night. 

For the first time in English football, there was not a single home player among the 16. Arsenal?s starting XI consisted of five Frenchmen, a German, a Cameroonian, an Ivorian, a Spaniard, a Brazilian and a Dutchman. On the bench were two Spaniards, a Frenchman, a Swiss and a Dutchman. 

?I didn?t know about that until I was told about it,? said Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, after his side?s 5-1 win. ?I don?t look at the passport of people, I look at their quality and their attitude.? 

However, Merson, the Walsall player-manager, called it ?a disgrace? that there was not a British player among the 16. He said: ?I?m 36 years old and if I was being purely selfish, I would say that Arsenal?s line-up didn?t bother me one bit. But that?s being selfish and short-sighted because for an 18 or 19-year-old dreaming of playing in the big time and maybe representing his country, Arsenal?s non-British 16 was terrifying. 

?Before our game at Bristol City this month someone brought a photo into the hotel of my old Arsenal side from the late Eighties and there wasn?t a foreign player in sight. Monday?s squad shows how much the game has changed in the last 15 years but I can?t help but feel it?s not to the benefit of English football. 

?This is all deeply worrying for our football. We?re cutting our own throats by opening up the Premiership to so many foreign players who then use the experience to their nations? advantage when we come across them in major championships.? 

Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers? Association, pointed the finger at David Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman, and at the Football Association rather than Wenger for the growing number of foreign players in the Premiership. 

He said: ?I can?t be critical of Arsene Wenger because his job is to create a winning team at Arsenal. It?s just disappointing for me as an Englishman that they only have Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell in there normally. 

?It?s a pattern that?s developing and the FA have to decide what their priorities are. Are our stars of the future getting the opportunities they need? 

?What worries me even more though is the attitude of David Dein. Here?s a man, a prominent member of the FA?s international committee, openly lobbying against Uefa?s quota of home player proposals. I find that absolutely astounding. The one thing the FA has got to do is protect the future interests of the game in England.?

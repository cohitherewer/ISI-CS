The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?m not a cheat, says Kuznetsova

Melbourne: US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, one of three players at the centre of tennis doping allegations, says she is not a drugs cheat and is upset that Belgian authorities inadvertently pointed the finger at her. 

The Women?s Tennis Association (WTA), the governing body for professional players, is also furious at the reports. 

?These are unsubstantiated rumours and it would be irresponsible to comment any further,? WTA chief executive Larry Scott said in a statement. 

?I?m not worried. I am definitely not using nothing to push myself up in the game... I?m pretty sure about this,? she said. ?I?m pretty sure that everybody?s pretty clean... because the anti-doping programme, it doesn?t allow us to take nothing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak keen to carry winning momentum

Mumbai: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan said Sunday night that the visitors will go all out for a win in the fourth match in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. A win there will enable Pakistan to square the series 2-2, and Younis said that was their target. 

?I am happy with the Jamshedpur win, and I hope we stay with the winning momentum,? Younis told reporters during the team?s stop here en route to Ahmedabad. 

All-rounder Shahid Afridi also said that the players were very positive and want to win all remaining matches of the series. ?It is a tough and important series for both the teams,? he added. 

Earlier, both the Indian and Pakistani cricket teams on their arrival from Ranchi (having been flown in from Jamshedpur, under the changed travel plans) were taken straight to a hotel in suburban Bandra under tight security for overnight stay. 

Their flight landed two hours late, and the players did not speak to the media at the airport. 

They leave for Ahmedabad Monday on a morning flight.

 Lankans pitch in for orphans

Colombo: Sri Lankan left-arm seamer Ruchira Perera and former captain Hashan Tillekeratne joined other cricket officials Sunday on a visit to distribute scholarships to children orphaned by the tsunami. 

Perera and Tillekeratne, chief of a Sri Lanka Cricket-sponsored charity programme to help victims of the December 26 tsunami, distributed scholarship kits to 225 children at a ceremony, spokesman Ray Illangakoon said. 

The scholarship packages include monthly cash allowances for education until the child reaches 18 years of age, medical insurance, school uniforms and equipment.

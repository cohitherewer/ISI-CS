 Fazal a true legend, says Miandad

Karachi: Thousands of mourners turned up showing their love and respect to former Pakistan cricket captain and legendary fast bowler Fazal Mahmood, who was buried in Lahore on Tuesday. 

Fazal died on Monday after suffering a cardiac arrest in his Ayesha Textile Mill office at the age of 78. 

The cricketer, who remained Pakistans leading wicket-taker with 139 scalps which stood for 25 years before Imran Khan broke it, was largely remembered for his 12 for 99 against England in the 1954 Test at The Oval. 

Fazals teammates, former Test stalwarts, politicians, people from the media and officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board attended the burial. 

President General Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz condoled his death, remembering the great fast bowler as someone who conquered the hearts of not only the Pakistanis but all cricket lovers with his performances, attitude and discipline. 

As a mark of respect, the Pakistan cricket team will wear black arm-bands during the second Test against the West Indies starting on Friday. 

Former Test stalwarts recounted Fazal as an inspiration and role model for generations to come. 

Hanif Mohammad described Fazal as the greatest bowler of his era. Fazal was foremost in putting Pakistan cricket on track soon after the independence. The fact we got Test status in such a short time was because of Fazal who won us matches on his own. 

Hanif said Fazal was a kind-hearted person who always cared for others. I can never forget those early days when as a youngster I always sought Fazals help. And never once he refused. 

Former captain Imran said: We learnt a lot from him. And his role in Pakistans victory against England at The Oval has proved an inspiration for all the upcoming players. He was instrumental in helping Pakistan emerge from a colonial mindset and made us realise as a nation that the British can be defeated in cricket as well. 

Javed Miandad termed Fazal as one of the greatest cricketers of all times, who did not get the kind of limelight he richly deserved. 

Fazal was a true legend of cricket. But unfortunately he did not get the recognition he deserved. Just imagine what would have happened if Fazal was not there to help out in the formative years of Pakistan cricket. Sadly as a nation, we seldom utilised his services. 

Fazal received numerous civil awards, including the highest Pride of Performance award. He was appointed as PCB chairmans advisor on fast bowler by Tauqir Zia in 2000 ? a post he held till the time of his death. (PTI)

 Title for Advani

Mumbai: Former world amateur snooker champion Pankaj Advani edged out Devendra Joshi 1283-1279, the reigning Asian billiards champion, by a mere four points to clinch the 71st senior national billiards championship on Saturday. 

Advani thus, repeated his three-title winning feat in the Jammu nationals two years ago where he clinched both the junior crowns as well as the senior snooker championship. The winner took home Rs 20,000 in prize money, while Joshi got Rs 16,000. 

Advani now has the senior snooker event, beginning on Sunday, to complete an unprecedented clean sweep of all four titles at stake in the tournament. (PTI)

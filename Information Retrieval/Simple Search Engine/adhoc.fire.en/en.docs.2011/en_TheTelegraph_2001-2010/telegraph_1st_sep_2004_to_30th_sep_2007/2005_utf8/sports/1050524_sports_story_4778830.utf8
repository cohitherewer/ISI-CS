 Foreign coach enthuses Indians

Ludhiana: Top athletes in the national coaching camp including K. M. Binu and Sunita Rani, two of Indias medal prospects in the international arena, can really look forward to some world-class training from a Belarussian coach who arrived in March. 

Nikolai K. Snesarev, one of the three foreigners in charge, has won the highest honour awarded to a coach in the erstwhile USSR and Belarus. The doctor has already become an instant hit with the athletes in the senior and junior camps. 

Snesarev has an impressive resume for the job with special proficiency in middle-distance, long-distance, mara-thon, steeplechase, 20 and 50 km walking, therapeutic massage plus adequate knowledge of sports medicine. (PTI)

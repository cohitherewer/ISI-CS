 Top-5 should play outside US, says Goosen

 Retief Goosen feels playing on other tours will boost the game worldwide 

Toronto: Twice US Open champion Retief Goosen challenged Tiger Woods and the worlds other top golfers on Tuesday to do more for the sport and play more events outside the United States. 

Goosen and his globetrotting South African compatriot Ernie Els will help make up one of the strongest fields of the season as they return to the US PGA Tour this week for the first time since the Masters for the Byron Nelson Championship in Irving, Texas. 

It marks just the third time this year that the worlds top five players ? Woods (No. 1), Vijay Singh (No. 2), Els (No. 3), Mickelson (No. 4) ? will tee off at the same event and Goosen (No. 5) thinks it would be good for the sport if golfs best also went head-to-head occasionally outside the PGA Tour. 

Well, me and Ernie sort of say that we need to support a little bit some of the tournaments outside America, Goosen told reporters. 

In a way we would like to see these other three guys maybe come over to Europe and make up a great field over there. All five of the top five players playing in a tournament somewhere in Europe or even in China would really boost the game of golf all the way around the world. 

But the chances of that happening, I suppose, are just about nothing. To have all five of us playing here this week adds something to the tournament. 

For several decades, the best players from South Africa, Australia and Canada have competed regularly in the United States where more and more top European players are now featuring.

 Gibbs, Boje dropped for last two ODIs

Durban: Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje have lost their places for South Africas final two one-day games against New Zealand after deciding not to tour India. 

Gibbs and Boje withdrew from the tour party playing five one-day Internationals in India next month because of fears they would be detained by Delhi police investigating match-fixing. 

South Africa are due to play five ODIs in India between November 16 and 28. 

Andrew Hall and Albie Morkel have replaced Gibbs and Boje in the squad to play New Zealand in one-dayers in Durban and Centurion on Friday and Sunday, respectively. 

South Africa have an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. 

Its rather unfortunate, but we needed to face reality, make the tough decisions and look ahead at our tour of India, selection convenor Haroon Lorgat said on Tuesday. Ideally we need to slot in our replacements now, redefine roles in the absence of the two established players, and ready ourselves for India. 

Batsman Gibbs was banned for six months and fined for agreeing to underperform in a ODI in Nagpur in March, 2000. 

Hansie Cronje, the former South African captain who was banned for life for his involvement in cricket corruption, relayed the offer to Gibbs. He has denied any wrongdoing. 

Spinner Bojes name was mentioned in telephone conversations between Cronje and figures in gambling underworld, although no evidence implicating Boje has yet been discovered. 

The Indian police had asked to interview Gibbs and Boje during South Africas tour. 

The South African Cricketers Association (SACA) said in a statement on Monday that no clarity could be obtained from Indian police as to what their intentions would be if Gibbs and Boje were to visit India. 

Neither player toured India 12 months ago for the same reasons.

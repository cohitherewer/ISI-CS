 Mendis back at SLC

 - Former captain and coachs resignation not accepted 

 Duleep Mendis 

Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket chief executive Duleep Mendis resumed work Thursday, a week after submitting his resignation amid a bitter row for control of the countrys richest sports body, officials said. 

?Mendis is back at work now,? an official said. ?His resignation was not accepted by the elected office bearers.? 

Mendis, a former Sri Lanka captain, coach and manager, resigned last week after being called in for questioning by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). It was alleged that he had refused to hand over documents to sports ministry officials following the governments takeover of the administration. 

However, the governments decision to send police armed with automatic weapons into the SLC headquarters on Tuesday afternoon to hand over control to their interim committee prompted him to re-think. 

?Duleep handed over a letter to us on Wednesday morning saying that he wanted to now continue and he resumed normal duties from the morning,? interim board secretary Tryphon Mirando said. 

The fierce five-week power struggle between the sports minister Jeewan Kumaratunga and elected cricket officials looks to be finally resolving itself. Kumaratungas decision to suspend the registration of SLC after allegations of financial mismanagement prompted the boards executive committee, headed by Thilanga Sumathipala, to launch a legal fight. 

The courtroom battle is set to continue next week as Sumathipalas committee tries to overturn the sports ministers decision to make amendments to the law to increase his power over national sports associations. 

But a Court of Appeal has thus far sided with the minister, ruling on Wednesday that the interim committee should retain control of the boards headquarters for the time being. 

The ICC has also backed the new administration, advising all member countries to recognise the interim committee, headed by businessman Jayantha Dharmadasa, as the official body. 

After five weeks of confusion the new board is now turning its attention to the appointment of a new national coach with former Australian all rounder Tom Moody emerging as the frontrunner. 

The other priorities are the finalisation of national player contracts, which expired at the end of February, and the setting up of an empowered Cricket Committee.

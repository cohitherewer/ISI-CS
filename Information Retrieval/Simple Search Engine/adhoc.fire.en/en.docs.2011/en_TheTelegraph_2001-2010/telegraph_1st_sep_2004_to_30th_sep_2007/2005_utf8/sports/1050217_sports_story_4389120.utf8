Barcelona: World Player of the Year Ronaldinho turned on the style as his World XI beat Andriy Shevchenko?s European XI 6-3 on Tuesday in a tsunami relief benefit match expected to raise 8 million euros ($10.38 million). 

The ever-smiling Brazilian gave a virtuoso display of his dazzling skills in front of a 40,000-crowd at the Nou Camp, while teammate Samuel Eto?o celebrated his second African Player of the Year award with an exuberant first-half double. 

The two Barcelona players led a glittering array of some of the biggest names in the game who had come together to raise funds for the victims of the tsunami that hit the coasts of southern Asia last December. Among the luminaries on parade were the world?s most expensive player Zinedine Zidane and the sport?s highest earner David Beckham. 

Evergreen AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini, Brazilian forward Kaka, Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and Japan?s Hidetoshi Nakata were amongst the other big names who took the field for a match broadcast in 150 countries across the world. 

However, Chelsea players Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba decided against making an early visit to the Nou Camp with a little more than a week to go before their club?s Champions League clash with Barcelona. 

Real Madrid striker Ronaldo was another high-profile absentee after throwing a lavish Valentine?s Day party for his fianc?e Daniella Cicarelli at a secluded castle near Paris. 

Players from the two sides linked hands in the centre circle for a minute?s silence in memory of the 240,000 people who died in the disaster that struck on December 26 last year. 

Cameroon striker Eto?o, opting to play in the match instead of collecting his award in Durban, opened the scoring for Ronaldinho?s side with a sharp turn and shot from the edge of the area in the 13th minute. 

Ronaldinho weighed in with a cheeky second before Juventus striker Alessandro Del Piero hit back for Shevchenko?s side, only for Eto?o to swagger his way past Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas for his second on the stroke of halftime. 

Shevchenko?s side, coached by Arsene Wenger and Italy boss Marcello Lippi, upped the pace after the break with 38-year-old Gianfranco Zola scoring his side?s second with a delightful chip. 

However, Henri Camara restored the World team?s lead with two sharply taken goals midway through the second half before providing a neat assist for South Korean Cha Du-ri to clinch victory. (Reuters)

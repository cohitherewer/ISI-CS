 Warne admits fault in failed marriage

 Reasons for separation private, says Warne 

Sydney: Australian cricketer Shane Warne has publicly admitted he is to blame for the failure of his marriage. Warne and his wife Simone said last month their nearly ten-year-old marriage was over. The announcement followed the latest in a long line of lurid media reports detailing Warnes infidelities. 

I do take responsibility for Simone and my separation, Warne wrote in Mondays edition of a Sydney tabloid. And despite the media stories of his extramarital affairs, Warne wrote that the reasons for the separation will remain private. 

Warne, 35, holds the record for most wickets in Test cricket, with 583 wickets in 123 matches. Hes well clear of second-place Muttiah Muralidharan of Sri Lanka, who has 532 wickets. 

He is about to join Australias Test team as it gears up for the eagerly anticipated ashes series vs England. 

Warne wrote that despite his split with Simone, who last week returned to Australia with the couples three children, I am very lucky that Simone and I remain such close and good friends. 

Warnes article appeared to be an attempt to staunch the flow of media reports about his private life ahead of the Ashes and to protect his wife and children. To the media, I know I am a target but please dont make it any tougher on my family than it is already, he wrote. 

Looking forward to the Ashes, Warne wrote that England skipper Michael Vaughans leadership was key to the teams success. 

I think that Michael Vaughan gives them that touch of class and calmness that has been lacking, he wrote. (AP)

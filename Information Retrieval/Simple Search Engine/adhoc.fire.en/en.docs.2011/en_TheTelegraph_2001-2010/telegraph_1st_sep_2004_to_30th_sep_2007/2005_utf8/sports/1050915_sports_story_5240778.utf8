 Murali ends it with 6/18

 Murali on Wednesday 

Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan took six for 18 as Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh by an innings and 96 runs on the third day of the first Test after the visitors crashed to their lowest Test score. 

Bangladesh, who resumed Wednesday on 36 for three, still trailing by 146 runs, lost wickets early and were bowled out for 86 in 27.4 overs. 

Muralidharan followed his double-strike late on Day II with the wickets of Tushar Imran (3), Aftab Ahmed (8) and Mohammad Rafique (4) in quick succession. 

Muralidharan then wrapped up the match when Enamul Haque (Jr) was stumped, becoming the fourth batsmen to be deceived by Muralidharans doosra, a delivery that spins in the opposite direct to his stock off-break. 

Muralidharans five-wicket haul was his 47th in Test cricket ? an extension of his own world record ? and he finished with match figures of nine for 60 from 24.2 overs.

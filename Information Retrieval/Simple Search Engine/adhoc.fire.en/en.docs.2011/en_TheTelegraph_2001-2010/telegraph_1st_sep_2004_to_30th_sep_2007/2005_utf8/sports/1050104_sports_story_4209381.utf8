Sydney: Ricky Ponting scored his first century as Test captain to put Australia in control of the final Test against Pakistan on Monday. 

Ponting ended his 12-month drought with a majestic 155 not out to steer Australia past Pakistan?s first innings total of 304 and reach 340 for four at the end of the second day. 

The skipper shared a 174-run partnership with Damien Martyn, who added a brisk 67 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Adam Gilchrist was unbeaten on 17. ?We?re in a pretty good position in the game... we?ve had a very good day,? Ponting told a news conference. 

?We?ve got to capitalise on that Tuesday. If we get another 100 runs it would very hard for Pakistan to get back in to the game.? Pakistan, already 2-0 down and facing the possibility of a series whitewash, dismissed Australian openers Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden early, but had little else to celebrate. 

The tourists had resumed their first innings on 292-9 and added 12 more runs before Kamran Akmal was neatly caught by Shane Warne at first slip off Glenn McGrath for 47, giving the lanky paceman his fourth wicket of the match. 

Pakistan made some early inroads when Naved-ul Hasan bowled Justin Langer for 13 with a vicious inswinger. Then leg-spinner Danish Kaneria shattered Matthew Hayden?s stumps on 26. 

However, Ponting and Martyn immediately put Australia back in control, batting through the entire middle session with Ponting reaching his hundred shortly before tea. 

Ponting?s form with the bat had slipped since he took over the Test captaincy from Steve Waugh a year ago and he was becoming increasingly anxious to add to his tally of 20 Test centuries. The 30-year-old had a career average of nearly 56 when Waugh departed, but had averaged less than 42 in his nine Tests as skipper. 

He came close with 92 against Sri Lanka in March and was agonisingly short with his 98 against Pakistan in Perth last month. But Monday he made no mistake. 

?Not scoring one for the whole calendar year was a bit disappointing. But I didn?t really feel any pressure to get my first one as skipper,? Ponting said. 

Ponting hardly played a false stroke and he brought up the milestone in the most emphatic fashion in a little over three hours, driving Naved to the boundary after 143 balls. 

Meanwhile, Kaneria landed in trouble for swearing at Clarke while he was returning to the pavilion. 

He was charged under the ICC?s Code of Conduct and issued a severe reprimand by Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle and fined his match fee of about $9,000. (Reuters)

 Massa to race for Ferrari

Milan: Brazilian Felipe Massa will race for Ferrari next season in place of his compatriot Rubens Barrichello, the Formula One team said on Tuesday. Barrichello has raced for the Italian team alongside Michael Schumacher since 2000 and won nine grands prix. 

Barrichello will leave the Scuderia at the end of the 2005 season, the conclusion of a fruitful and fortunate collaboration that began in 2000 and so far has brought the achievement of five constructors world championship titles, a statement said. (Reuters)

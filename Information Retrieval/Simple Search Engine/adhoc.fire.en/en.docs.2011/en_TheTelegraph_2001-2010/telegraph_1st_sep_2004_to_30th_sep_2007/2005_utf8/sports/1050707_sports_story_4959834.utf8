The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Masadur targets 12 channels

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Masadur Rahman Baidya is out to create waves in the world of long-distance swimming: He has a target of conquering as many as 12 channels. 

Its my dream, said the swimmer on the sidelines of the ongoing junior national meet at Subhas Sarobar pool on Wednesday. 

Masadur created a splutter when had conquered physical handicaps on way to crossing the English Channel in 1997. Four years later, he swam the Straits of Gibraltar. 

He was supposed to set off swimming the third channel ? Catalina Channel of California ? this August, but had to back out from that plan owing to lack of sponsors. 

The Catalina Channel authorities invited me for swimming and I was supposed to do so on August 14. But for that I need a little over Rs 7 lakh. Unfortunately, I couldnt find any sponsor and had to postpone my trip, lamented Masadur. 

Im now looking for sponsors. May be I hope Ill get financial assistance from NRIs. And if everything falls in place, Ill give it a try in September, he maintained, with determination writ large on his face. 

When asked if his target was influenced by Bula Chowdhurys seven-channel conquering feat, he replied in the negative. 

Mihir Sen (the first Indian swimmer to cross the English Channel) is my inspiration, Masadur insisted, with a smile.

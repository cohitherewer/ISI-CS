 Mushtaq, Saqlain apply

Karachi: Pakistan spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Saqlain Mushtaq, playing for different County sides in England, have applied for British citizenship. 

Mushtaq is having an outstanding season for Sussex, while Saqlain has also impressed while playing for Surrey. 

However, the duo still harbours hope of making it to the Pakistan squad and hence, would desist from appearing for their Counties as locals. 

Despite applying for the citizenship, they have opted not to try to appear for their counties as local players, which they can do in their current status, as apparently they still harbour hopes of making one final comeback for the Pakistan team, the daily quoted sources as saying. 

Mohammed Akram has already got British citizenship and plays for Sussex. (PTI)

New Delhi: Fortyeight hours after playing the fifth point of the second set tie-break, Thomas Johansson and Rohan Bopanna were back on court to resume the second rubber of the Davis Cup World Group play-off tie at the R.K. Khanna Stadium. 

The heavy rains on Friday night and Saturday morning had made the bounce even more unpredictable, but to the delight of a big crowd (about 3000 people had turned up), it had no effect on Bopannas free-swinging, hard-serving style. After an hour and five minutes of action, though, Sweden had gone 2-0 up. 

But the very scoreline ? 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4) in favour of Johansson ? reflects the kind of fight Bopanna put up. Despite a potentially scary ankle injury midway through the third set. 

With the dark clouds having cleared up by 1 pm and the sun ruling the sky, there was enough light to get the doubles underway. Here lay Indias best chance, with our two doubles giants (Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi) up against the Swedish giant (Jonas Bjorkman) and a lightweight (Simon Aspelin). 

A set and a half could be gone through before dusk descended on the capital. Paes and Bhupathi struggled with their serves before the captain ultimately succumbed to concede the first set 3-6. The Indians had just earned their first break of the match to be up 3-1 when referee Wayne McKewen halted proceedings at 6 pm. 

The tie, then, goes into the fourth day with India still needing a miracle to master the Swedes. Even if Paes and Bhupathi manage to make it 1-2, winning both reverse singles is as tall an order as wishing for a permanent truce between Sourav Ganguly and Greg Chappell at this point of time. 

Back to the man who won a thousand hearts with his bold tennis. Ranked in the 300s, Bopanna was broken by the world No. 14 just once in the match. And yet the 25-year-old Indian lost in straight sets mainly because he a) played three poor tie-breaks and b) didnt take his chances (two set points on Friday and two break-points on Sunday). 

This is the same player who came close to beating then French Open runner-up Martin Verkerk in a Davis Cup tie in The Netherlands two years ago. 

Few tennis followers had forgotten that, but for Bopanna to come out of a long injury lay-off, come into the team under controversial circumstances replacing the highest-ranked Indian (Harsh Mankad) and play the kind of aggressive tennis that he did is indeed praiseworthy. 

He fired 24 aces, serving some of them at 220 kmph and more. Even Paes ackonowledged he hadnt seen any Indian send down such bombs. He had a set-point each in the 10th and 12th games. 

Johansson handled the first crisis well by getting a high, kicking first serve into Bopannas body. The second chance went abegging as Bopanna put a forehand nervously past the tram line after having Johansson on the run.

Calcutta: Just four days are left for the WTA Sunfeast Open to begin and the players have already started arriving in the city. 

The Uberoi sisters, Shikha and Neha, hit town in the early hours of Wednesday and made an appearance at the venue in the afternoon. 

My performance this year has not been unsatisfactory, but neither has it been up to my expectations, said Shikha at a press conference at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

I am looking forward to this event where I will face some higher-ranked players? it will be a good challenge, continued Shikha, the elder of the two siblings currently ranked 151. 

Asked about the newly-laid surface at the Netaji Indoor, Shikha said: I have never played indoors, on this kind of surface. I prefer playing on hardcourts outdoors, because I have grown up playing on such surfaces. 

Nehas preference is the same. We practise together? we also played a lot of doubles matches together. However, due to the differences in our rankings nowadays we dont get to play the same tournaments, said Neha, currently ranked 248 in the world. They might give doubles a shot here, she added. 

Both sisters are, naturally, proud of Sania and happy for India. Both have, however, been much-inspired by the Williams sisters. 

Venus and Serena Williams are quite amazing. They play power tennis and their athleticism is something we really admire, said Neha. Added Shikha: They have started a trend, but we try to emulate them up to a point, not beyond. 

It took Shikha some time to get clearance from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) to play for India. Neha, who still plays for the US, expects to get her clearance soon. 

The sisters are coached by their father, Mahesh, who also travels with them. A professional travelling coach is not on their agenda at this moment. 

The sisters, for the time being, will be based in Mumbai and will concentrate more on the Asian circuit.

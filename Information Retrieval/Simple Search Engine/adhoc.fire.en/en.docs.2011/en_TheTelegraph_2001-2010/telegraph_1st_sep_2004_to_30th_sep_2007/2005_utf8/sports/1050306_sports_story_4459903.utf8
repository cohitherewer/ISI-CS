New Delhi: The Indian Davis Cup team, so sharply focussed on immediate targets through the week, on Saturday allowed itself to look at the future after sealing entry into the Asia-Oceania group I second round with a 3-0 lead over China here. 

As the players took an Indian flag around the R.K. Khanna Stadium on a victory lap, it was obvious they were tickled by the thought that they are but a step away from the World Group play-off. 

That has been a realistic target for the team in the past few years. India will play the winner of the tie between Indonesia and Uzbekistan from April 29. 

In the morning on Day II, Prakash Amritraj had ambushed Wang Yu Jr with an attacking display when their rain-interrupted second singles contest resumed at 6-3, 2-3. The tactics worked in India?s favour as Amritraj unleashed a rich repertoire of strokes to keep the Chinese guessing as he secured his maiden Davis Cup victory. 

The Indian team realised overnight that the left-hander could mount a threat if he found his rhythm and entrusted its youngest member with the task of hustling Wang into submission. 

The tall lad came out firing on all cylinders, drawing level with the Chinese and then breaking serve even as many were still settling down on a sunny, hot morning. 

Amritraj shed the inhibitions that had crept into his game late on Friday evening when the left-hander was well warmed up and started using his strengths to great effect. The chip-and-charge game that Leander Paes had all but patented was in evidence even if India?s greatest Davis Cup player was only in the captain?s chair. 

There were not a few who got nostalgic when Paes walked on court to play the doubles. 

They kept discussing how India?s best pair could have won more Grand Slam and ATP Tour titles had they sustained their partnership but the men in question did not let such emotions affect their countenance as they added another victory in Cup play. 

For Bhupathi and Paes, it was just another day in office. They quickly realised that the court did not play as true as they would have liked and the uneven bounce would hamper their natural game. 

Such a realisation allowed them to play well below themselves and yet stay ahead of the enthusiastic Chinese pair. 

The Indians, anticipating and coordinating well, were unable to make capital of the three break-points in the fifth game when Zhu Ben-Qiang was serving. 

The shoe was soon on the other foot and Bhupathi had to produce some good serves to hold serve. 

The home pair had one more chance to go a break up in the seventh game but that was to no avail. 

Bhupathi and Paes saved three break-points in the tie-breaker before converting their third set-point to take the first set. 

They broke Zhu in the eighth game of the second set to raise visions of an early finish only to slacken their effort. Paes was broken in the eighth game of the third set but the Indians raised their game just that bit to be able to romp home winners quickly enough. 

But spare the pair?s predicament ? and commitment ? a thought. For a combination that is used to rubbing shoulders with the best at the highest level in the Davis Cup, Grand Slams and on the ATP Tour events, it has had to take on journeymen who had little to lose. 

?Yes, these kind of combinations are so many levels below what we have been used to. And sometimes ? we have faced this situation a number of times now ? it becomes hard to keep the focus, especially in the later stages of a match. 

?We have to consciously guard against letting this loss of focus become a habit,? Paes told The Telegraph. 

Bhupathi did not take long to echo that. He said had it not been for the fact that it was the Davis Cup, he may not have been spending time away from the ATP circuit. 

?It means a lot to be playing for your country. There is nearly a week of camaraderie and fun. I am motivated to play for India and to be at my best on Saturday,? he said. 

Indeed, it is such motivation from players from both ends of the experience spectrum that has seen India take the 3-0 lead after two days.

 Togo shake up African hierarchy

 - Surprise debutants raring to go in world cup 2006 

Lome: Togos sudden elevation to the ranks of World Cup finalists has been one of the biggest upsets in African soccer history, precipitating a major shake-up in the traditional power ranks of the continents football. 

The tiny west African country, who had previously qualified for only a handful of African Nations Cup tournaments and never won a major trophy, shocked the established order by finishing top of African group I ahead of Senegal and Zambia. 

Senegal were World Cup quarter finalists in 2002 while Zambia were expected to mount a major challenge under the tutelage of their coach Kalusha Bwalya. 

Instead it was one of Bwalyas playing contemporaries, the former Nigerian captain Stephen Keshi, who moulded a group of unheralded footballers into World Cup finalists. 

Togo lost only one game in their group qualifiers at the start of their campaign and then saw off their more fancied opponents, albeit in a swirl of controversy. 

Togos 2-1 away win over Mali in Bamako in March set off rioting throughout the city, including the sacking of several shops and cars, while the 4-1 home win over Zambia in early June was overshadowed by several shocking decisions in Togos favour by the Moroccan referee. 

Togo made use of their opportunity, however, and then produced the all-important result to ensure their progress, an away draw in Senegal in mid-June that set them up to win the group. 

Keshi, who captained his country at the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States, has been given much credit for his ability to inspire a group of players without previous international success. 

On the field, 10 goals from Emmanuel Adebayor proved a catalyst for qualification. 

The lanky Adebayor, who plays for Monaco in Frances Ligue 1, finished as the top goal scorer in the African qualifying campaign. 

Togo, ranked 56th in Novembers Fifa rankings with only fellow finalists Angola (62nd) behind them among the teams who have qualified for the finals, certainly will not win the World Cup next year but they may well make it difficult for some others who do fancy their chances. 

Meanwhile, Tunisia will be the only one of Africas five representatives in Germany who have any previous World Cup finals experience but the north Africans are still seeking to get past the first round in the competition. 

Tunisia will be making a fourth World Cup finals appearance following their debut in 1978 and their more recent appearances in 1998 and 2002, and have set themselves the task of reaching the knockout stages in Germany next June. 

The steady hand of coach Roger Lemerre has elevated Tunisias profile, first in taking the 2004 African Nations Cup title on home soil and then emerging top of their World Cup qualifying group.

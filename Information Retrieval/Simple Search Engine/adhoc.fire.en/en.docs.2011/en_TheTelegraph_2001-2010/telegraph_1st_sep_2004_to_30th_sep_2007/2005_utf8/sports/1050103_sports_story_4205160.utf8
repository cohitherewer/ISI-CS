Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly?s brilliant 121 helped Bengal stay in the hunt on the third day of the Ranji Trophy Elite group tie against Madhya Pradesh at the Eden. The Team India captain was ably assisted by Devang Gandhi?s unbeaten 77. 

Bengal, struggling at close on the second day, were desperately seeking Sourav?s help with the threat of relegation looming large. Sourav showed strong determination in thwarting the challenge of the Madhya Pradesh bowlers. 

Sourav and Devang shared a 167-run partnership for the sixth wicket. The hosts still have to get 99 for the first innings lead with four wickets in hand. 

At close, Bengal were 294 for six. Laxmi Ratan Shukla, unbeaten on 9, was giving Devang company. The only spot of bother was losing Sourav?s wicket towards the end of the day. 

Play called off 43 minutes before scheduled close because of bad light. 

Bengal received a jolt in the 12th over of the day, when Sourashish Lahiri was dismissed on 10 with the team total reading 106 for five. Sourashish had earlier been dropped by Naman Ojha off Sanjay Pandey. 

Devang joined buddy Sourav in the middle and it was Bengal?s turn to dictate the terms. Everyone at the ground was praying for a big partnership between two of Bengal?s best batsmen. Sourav took charge and let his partner settle down after more than a month?s lay-off. Devang had played his last match against Gujarat in Siliguri in late November. 

Though a lot remains to be done, Bengal will look up to Devang on the last morning to give them the much-desired first innings lead and the certificate to stay in the Elite Group. 

The way both the seasoned campaigners batted on this flat wicket, it was clear that a bowler had to wait for the batsmen to commit a mistake. It was also a lesson for the other Bengal ?stars? on how to build an innings. 

Sourav batted for 321 minutes and faced 213 balls. He completed his fifth Ranji Trophy century in 277 minutes with the help of 14 boundaries. Though most of his fours came from his trade-mark off-side shots, there were also a few sweetly timed on-drives. Specially, in the 54th over his back-to-back square drives off Sunil Dholpure were cherished by the some 1000-odd spectators present. 

Sourav survived the only scare of the match when a loud caught-behind appeal was turned down by umpire S. Ravindra. It was in the 63rd over, when his attempted cut off Jitendra Likhar went through to Ojha?s gloves. It seemed a pretty close call. Sourav then was on 62 and the team total at 174 for five. 

Madhya Pradesh captain Amay Khurasia threw his cap on the ground in frustration and also exchanged a few words with the umpire. He was cautioned on the ground. 

After that incident, it was a perfect cake-walk for the two and both complemented each other very well. Devang was also at his best. He hit two consecutive boundaries off Pandey in the 80th over. Sourav and Devang?s aggressive style also delayed the visitors taking the new ball. Finally the new ball was taken in the 88th over and it clicked for them. 

Pandey, introduced into the attack, did the needful for Madhya Pradesh. A straight Pandey delivery knocked Sourav?s stumps after a faint inside edge, when he tried to play it across the line. 

Now it is to be seen how Devang and Shukla complement Sourav?s fantastic effort on the final day.

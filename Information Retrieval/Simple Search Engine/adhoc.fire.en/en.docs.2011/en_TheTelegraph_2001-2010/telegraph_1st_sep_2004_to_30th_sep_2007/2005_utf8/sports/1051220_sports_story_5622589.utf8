 ICC bans Shabbir for one year

London: Pakistan paceman Shabbir Ahmed has become the first bowler to be banned for one year because of an illegal action, the International Cricket Council said on Monday. 

Shabbir was reported for the second time during the first Test against England last month and an independent assessment by the University of Western Australia has confirmed he bowls with an illegal action. 

He was first reported and suspended earlier this year but returned to international cricket following remedial work on his action and a full bio-mechanical analysis that demonstrated that he had made the necessary adjustments to his bowling style, the ICC said in a statement. 

Having been reported and assessed as bowling illegally for a second time within two years of the first period of suspension, Shabbir has received a mandatory one-year ban. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said Shabbirs ban was regrettable but appropriate. 

It is clear that Mr Ahmed has the capacity to bowl with a legal action but it would seem that on occasion he has the tendency to revert to old habits, he said in the ICC statement. 

Having had the opportunity to remedy this flaw but not being able to do so consistently, a suspension for 12 months provides him with the opportunity to permanently address the concerns that have been identified. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan allrounder Shoaib Malik, who was also reported for suspect action along with Shabbir, has been cleared, a senior PCB official said on Monday. (Agencies)

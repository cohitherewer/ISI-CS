 Anand settles for a draw with Leko

 - WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP

 Topalov opens up 1.5-point advantage 

 Anand failed to drive home the advantage 

San Luis (Argentina): Viswanathan Anand settled for a draw with the Hungarian GM Peter Leko after an interesting duel in the World Chess Championship on Monday. The Indian Grandmaster thus remained on three points to share the second spot with Russian Peter Svidler. 

Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria increased his lead by a commanding 1.5 points when he defeated Svidler with black pieces in the fifth round. 

Topalov, rejuvenated after the rest day, played an enterprising game to outwit Svidler in 44 moves from the black side of a sharp Sicilian Defence. 

Topalov now has an impressive 4.5 points from 5 games, pulling well clear of Anand and Svidler. 

In what was an otherwise uneventful round, Topalovs win proved to be the only decisive result. 

The shortest encounter of Round V was the one between English GM Michael Adams and reigning champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov. It took them just 29 moves to split the point. 

Lekos strategy of following Garri Kasparov paid dividends in a sharp Sicilian Pelikan against Anand. Leko adopted the system preferred by Kasparov himself against Anand in Linares earlier this year. Anand deviated from known theory on the 18th move with a pawn thrust on the queenside, thus creating a passer. 

The whole game centred around his strategic goal of promoting the pawn to the queen square, and Anand indeed looked like enjoying an advantage at this point. 

However, Leko once again showed his proven defensive skills to patiently thwart Anands ambitions on the queenside. Sensing the importance of winning this game, Anand sacrificed a pawn on the 28th move, thus ensuring that the b-passer continued its march unhindered. 

Leko, though, cleverly sacrificed the exchange and patiently defended the ensuing ending to draw the game after 60 moves. 

In a clash between two of the worlds most creative players, GM Judit Polgar of Hungary reached what looked like a promising position but couldnt breach the defences of the unpredictable Alexander Morozevich (Russia), the game ending in a draw after 41 moves. 

Kasimdzhanov has a tally of 2.5, Hungarians Polgar and Leko have 2 each. Adams and Morozevich are the tailenders with 1.5 apiece. 

All eyes were on Topalov who is in tremendous form in this tournament, as he faced Svidler. With white pieces, Svidler chose the sharp English Attack and went for a variation which was adopted by Kasimdzhanov to beat Anand in the previous round. 

Svidler chose to play the knight directly to the e3 square 14th move, unlike Kasimdzhanov who preferred exchanging the central pawns first. Topalov deviated from known theory and unleashed a powerful novelty, which included sacrificing a knight followed by a bishop on the 15th and 16th moves. 

Svidler kept his cool to accept the knight but declined the bishop and moved his king to the centre, which was obviously going to be attacked by black pieces. 

With the experts were predicting an early draw after a forced sequence of moves, Svidler inexplicably decided to offer his rook and a couple of pawns for Topalovs two minor pieces, which turned the table in favour of black. 

After that, it was Topalov all the way, as he liquidated the game into an ending where his superiority was never in doubt, finally romping home in 44 moves. 

Adams decided to play a strategic game against the Uzbek Kasimdzhanov by chosing a simple variation of the Sicilian Najdorf. The battle developed in lines of controlling the crucial d5 sqaure, and Adams was going to press hard with his slowly developing advantage when Kasimdzhanov came with the counter strike of opening the kingside on the 24th move. 

Sensing that the situation was getting out of control, Adams decided to keep it simple by repeating moves and settled for an uneventful draw in 29 moves. 

Morozevich once again showed the freshness of his opening choices by chosing the Philidor defence with black. Polgar inexplicably declined to win a pawn on the 19th move and preferred to continue her plan of opening up the centre. 

Morozevichs position looked passive and he decided to further weaken the centre in the middlegame to seek counterplay. After a complicated fight, the peace treaty was signed on move 41, in a position which curiously still offered chances for Polgar to press her advantage. (PTI)

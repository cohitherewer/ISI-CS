The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?d never thought I would come this far: Inzamam

 - Pakistan captain prescribes aggression in third (his 100th) Test? ?Koi choice nahi hai?

Bangalore: Inzamam-ul Haq is only hours away from becoming the fourth Pakistani to earn at least 100 Test caps. And, given the huge moment it will be, the family is here in strength: Father Pir Intezam-ul, elder brother Etram-ul, wife Kashifa and the two children ? Ibtesham and Amima. Obviously, Inzy ? who had a somewhat lengthy Media conference and, then, spoke separately to The Telegraph (at the Chinnaswamy Stadium itself) on Wednesday ? is thrilled. 

The following are excerpts 

On taking to the final Test being 0-1 down 

For us, it?s a must win match... Koi choice nahi hai... We?ll be positive and we?re going to be aggressive. 

On the wicket 

Seems to be the best of the series... Irrespective of how it behaves, we cannot but put our best foot forward... Do-or-die ho gaya hai... 

On what needs to be done 

Capitalising on openings... When up against a good team, it?s difficult making a comeback if the opportunities haven?t been taken advantage of. There?s no second life. 

On whether, nowadays, people back home sportingly accept a defeat at the hands of India 

By playing much more regularly, thoda sa sakoon to milta hai. Criticism, however, will be there. 

On a lensman clicking him and Shahid Afridi (at Tuesday?s nets) when it appeared both were having a go at each other 

Surely, this can?t be interpreted as disunity... There could have been a friendly argument, or Afridi wasn?t able to understand what I wanted to convey. Our team spirit is just fine. 

On whether his job could be on the line if his 100th Test ends in another defeat 

(Smiles) The job is always on the line, har series mein kaha jata hai... The 100th Test, though, only comes once... 

On the journey from 1991-92 till now 

I?d never thought I would come this far... Main Allah ka shukra guzaar hoon... I?m also grateful to my family, which has supported me through the good and bad times. 

On who is he going to think of on getting up on Thursday 

My mother, Ameer Begum... She was a diabetic and died a few years before my Pakistan debut... (Adds emotionally) Tomorrow, I will miss her the most. 

On whether he has thought of dedicating his achievement to somebody 

Mere Walid Saheb... Like any father, he?s proud of what I?ve done. 

On his most satisfying innings 

The 329 versus New Zealand (2001-02) and, in ODIs, the unbeaten 90 against the West Indies (1992-93)... 

On the one high and the lowest point in his career 

The 1992 World Cup, where I did well and we won... Then, the 2003 World Cup, where I managed a mere 18 runs in six matches and we got thrashed. I can?t forget either... Kaise bhool sakta hoon? 

On what he has learnt most in the past 14-15 years 

That, to succeed, temperament is as important as skill... The more calm a player, the better his chances of coming out of the most difficult situation. 

On whether he needs to bat higher in both Tests and ODIs 

Main jaha khelta hoon, wahin comfortable hoon. 

Finally, his message for youngsters nurturing big dreams 

Work hard and respect elders.

 IN THE CITY

 Arun Malhotra, Kulothungan, R.C. Prakash and Amandeep Singh signed in favour East Bengal on Friday. Earlier, they had sought inter-state transfers. The club will conduct a medical test on Saturday for all the players. Arch-rivals Mohun Bagan are also scheduled to conduct their medical test on the same day. 

 The club has requisitioned the fresh faces from the last National Football League where the likes of Prakash had made life difficult for the Calcutta giants. East Bengal have been the big gainers so far in the transfers market, with the least gain having accrued to Tollygunge Agragami who have dropped out of the elite league.

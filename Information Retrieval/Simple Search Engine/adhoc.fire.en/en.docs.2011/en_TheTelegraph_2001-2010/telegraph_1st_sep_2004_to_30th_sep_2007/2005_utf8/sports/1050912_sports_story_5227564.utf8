 Dravid should replace Sourav 

 Akram feels Pakistan may struggle against England 

Dubai: Wasim Akram feels a change is needed at the helm of Indian cricket. I think the time has come for a change in the Indian captaincy. I backed Sourav (Ganguly) before their tour of Zimbabwe but he looked pretty ordinary out there. He should be replaced by Rahul Dravid. 

I am talking about this purely on a cricketing point, nothing personal. 

Akram rated England as very dangerous side and said Pakistan might struggle against them in the upcoming home series. 

England have been playing good cricket these days and they will be coming to Pakistan high on confidence after a big Ashes series, the former Pakistan captain said on Sunday. 

Pakistan, I feel, still would start as firm favourites with three quality spinners, two of them ? Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik being top-class allrounders ? and pacer Shoaib Akhtar coming back into the side, something which will tilt the scale in their favour. 

But they will have to work very hard to challenge England. Pakistan, under coach Bob Woolmer, is a different side. They are much more mentally strong and that matters, said Akram, who was in Dubai for a private visit. 

Akram rejected the notion that England, whose tour begins on October 26, might be exhausted after the nerve-racking Ashes series against Australia. I dont think it will be the case. 

They will have a rest before coming to Pakistan and also players these days are very professional and have a high-level of fitness. 

Paying tribute to Englands four-man pace attack, Akram said they all knew how to reverse swing the ball at good speed. I dont think their pacers will struggle in Pakistan since the weather will be cold and nice. 

In winters we have only 83 overs in Punjab and so that will matter. England will cope well with conditions there, and Pakistan will have to play out of their skins to do well. 

The current Ashes series has shown that England are getting very close to finishing the matches. They are getting the extra edge in general. 

Akram said that if Pakistan beat England, then India, who are due to play in Pakistan in January, would have a tough time. But it will all depend how the England series shapes up.

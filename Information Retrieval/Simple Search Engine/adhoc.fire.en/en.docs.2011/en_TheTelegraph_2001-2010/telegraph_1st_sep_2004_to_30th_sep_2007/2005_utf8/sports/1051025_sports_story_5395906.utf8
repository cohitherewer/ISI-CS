 Vasco to go all out against Salgaocar 

Margao: Spurred by their performance against Mohun Bagan, Vasco SC will go all out against Salgaocar to book a berth in the semi-finals of the Alchemist Federation Cup, at Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday. 

Both the teams have played each other twice and have won one each. Vascos inspiring performance against Mohun Bagan has raised their morale. Their pacy game along the flank with a sound defence may rattle the Salgaocar defence. 

Salgaocars fortune will rest on their midfield who will have to create more opening for the strikers to score. 

Vasco coach Matthew DCosta, who is confident after his teams victory over the 11-time champions on Saturday, said his teams morale is now high. 

But we are not going to rest on it (the victory over Bagan) as every match is new. I know that there will be crowd pressure on us to perform. We will try to finish the match within 90 minutes, he added. 

Salgaocar coach Shabbir Ali said: It will be a close contest as both teams know each other well. But I am confident we will win. (PTI)

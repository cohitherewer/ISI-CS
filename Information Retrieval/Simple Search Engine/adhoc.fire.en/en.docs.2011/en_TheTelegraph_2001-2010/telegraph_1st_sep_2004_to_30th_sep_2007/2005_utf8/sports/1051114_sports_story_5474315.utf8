London: Spain, Switzerland and the Czech Republic all moved a step closer to the World Cup with victories on Saturday while Australia kept their hopes alive despite losing in the first leg of the final playoffs. 

Trinidad and Tobago were held at home by Bahrain in the only drawn match. So apart from Spain, who crushed 10-man Slovakia 5-1 in Madrid, the ties are all finely balanced ahead of Wednesdays second legs in the battle for places in Germany next year. 

Luis Garcia scored a hattrick in Spains emphatic win with goals after 10, 18 and 74 minutes, while Fernando Torres scored from a 65th minute penalty. Garcias Liverpool teammate Fernando Morientes added the fifth 11 minutes from time. 

Slovakian defender Marian Had was sent off after 64 minutes for protesting the penalty award and will miss the second leg when Spain look certain to qualify for their eighth successive finals since they last missed out in West Germany in 1974. 

Switzerland scored a well-deserved but unexpected 2-0 win over Turkey in Berne, but now face a torrid second leg in Istanbul. 

Australia, meanwhile, although beaten 1-0 by Uruguay in Montevideo were vastly improved from their 0-3 loss there in a playoff in 2001 and did enough to suggest they could overturn the tie in Sydney next Wednesday. 

The Czech Republic also scored a 1-0 win over Norway in Oslo to move a step closer the finals, although that tie is still far from over. 

Trinidad amp; Tobago were held to a 1-1 draw despite being the more dangerous team ahead of the second leg in Manama. 

Twenty-seven nations, including hosts Germany and champions Brazil have already qualified for the finals and the complete line-up will be finalised on Wednesday ahead of the draw for the finals which will be held in Leipzig on December 9. 

The Swiss secured their surprise win over the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists with goals from Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos and Lazio midfielder Valon Behrami. 

Senderos headed in from a Ludovic Magnin free-kick four minutes before half-time while Behrami grabbed the second four minutes from full time after coming on as a substitute in the 86th minute. 

Switzerlands win was only their second in the last eight meetings between the two sides and also brought an end to Turkeys unbeaten run away from home during this World Cup qualifying campaign. 

Uruguay, who won the World Cup twice in 1930 and 1950 but have failed to qualify for two of the last three finals, were made to fight all the way by Australia in a gritty battle for supremacy at home, but only had Dario Rodriguezs 37th-minute goal to show for their efforts at the end. 

Australia beat Uruguay 1-0 at home in the first leg four years ago before losing 0-3 in Uruguay, and will be hoping to reverse history when they meet again next week. 

There was only one goal in it in Oslo too where the Czechs beat Norway, thanks to a superbly executed first-half header from Vladimir Smicer. 

In Trinidad, Christopher Birchall struck a stunning 25m half-volley to equalise with 12 minutes left after Salman Husein had given Bahrain the lead in the 72nd with a powerful header.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand heading for third-place finish

 - LINARES MEET 

- Kasparov needs draw vs Topalov to bag title 

Anand?s game against Kasparov lasted just 

about half an hour 

Linares: Viswanathan Anand drew with world?s top-rated Garri Kasparov of Russia in the 13th and penultimate round of the Linares Super Grandmasters tournament here (as briefly reported in Thursday?s Late City edition). 

Kasparov assured himself of at least a shared first place in the 22nd edition of the tournament after the draw with the Indian ace as he took his tally to an unassailable 8 points out of a possible 11 in the seven-player double round-robin event. 

However, Anand slipped to third spot after the draw as Bulgarian Veselin Topalov stamped his authority over local star Francisco Pons Vallejo in an almost one-sided affair to move to 7 points. 

As things stand now, with just one round come to come in this euro 297000 prize money tournament, Kasparov is almost assured of the title provided he does not lose to Topalov in the final round game. 

Anand on 6.5 points is certain for a third place finish come what may in his game against Briton Michael Adams in the final round, while Corus champion Peter Leko of Hungary is almost certain to finish fourth after his game with Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov ended in a draw. 

Adams in all likelihood is likely to finish fifth while Vallejo will try to finish ahead of Kasimdzhanov. 

Anand?s game against Kasparov lasted just about half an hour as the game was still in the stage of infancy when the point was shared. 

Reason for that was apparently simple as Kasparov was happy and content with a draw with a 1.5 point lead to back him in the last two rounds. 

?We were both tired coming in to this game and with this draw Kasparov probably wins the tournament. As for me, in Petroff you really don?t try to win a game. 

?Also, I had a pretty nerve-wrecking game yesterday and I was rather cautious,? Anand said in the post match conference. 

The day provided just one decisive game, and that came from Topalov. The Bulgarian succeeded thanks to Vallejo?s insipid play in the opening as well as the middle game. Vallejo fell under tremendous time pressure and blundered away his chances to go down rather tamely. 

The other game of the day also had little for the spectators, as Kasimdzhanov was happy to get a half point with his white pieces. Employing the Rossolimo Attack, the Uzbek got nothing and following copybook play by Leko the draw was a just result in only 24 moves.

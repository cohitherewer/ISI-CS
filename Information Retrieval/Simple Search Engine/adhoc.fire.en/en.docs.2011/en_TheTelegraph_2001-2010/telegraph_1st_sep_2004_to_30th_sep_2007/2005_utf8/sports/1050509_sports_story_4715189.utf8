 Agassi slams Coria after loss

Rome: Andre Agassi slammed Guillermo Coria for his ?unacceptable behaviour? after losing to the Argentinian in the semi-finals of the Rome Masters. 

Ninth seed Coria beat the eight-time Grand Slam champion 7-5, 7-6 (7-0) in a fractious semi-final on Saturday (as reported in Sundays City edition) to set up a meeting in the final with Rafael Nadal, to whom he lost in the Monte Carlo final last month. 

Teen sensation Nadal, going for his fifth singles title this year, battled back from a set down to beat Spanish compatriot David Ferrer 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. 

Agassi was upset that Coria insisted one of his borderline returns in the first set was definitely out, even before the ball had touched the floor. 

?He shook his finger before the ball bounced and then he circles it (the mark) as if it was obviously out and starts walking back,? said the sixth seed, a winner here in 2002. 

?I understand making a mistake, but I dont understand suggesting that when its that close, its clearly out. 

?It was an unreasonable response and one I didnt appreciate at all. If youre not sure, thats what the umpire is there for. 

?Its better to be not sure ? thats okay, we can live with that ? but to act like its sure when its obviously close is unacceptable behaviour.? 

Coria, who held two match points in last years French Open final only to lose to Gaston Gaudio, admitted his nerves were jangling when Agassi stormed 5-2 ahead in the second set. 

?I was worried, but then I started to play like I did in the first set,? said the 23-year-old Coria. ?I knew that if I just kept my serve I could break him.? 

Fifth seed Nadal admitted Fridays three-setter against Radek Stepanek had taken a lot out of him after being pushed all the way by Ferrer. 

?I felt a little bit tired, mentally and physically, but Ive played a lot of matches this year? he said. 

?David played better than me in the first two sets, but i finished the match playing at my highest level. 

?I fought for every ball and the important thing was that I came good at the end.? 

Nadal insisted he never doubted himself, even when Ferrer saved two match points to break his serve and level at 5-5 in the deciding set. ?I had some problems, but then he had some problems, too,? he said. 

Ranked a career-best seventh in the world, Nadal is the first left-hander to reach the Rome final since Marcelo Rios in 1998.

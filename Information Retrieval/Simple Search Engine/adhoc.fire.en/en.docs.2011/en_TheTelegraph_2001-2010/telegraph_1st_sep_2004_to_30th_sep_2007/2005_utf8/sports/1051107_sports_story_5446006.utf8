 7-wkt win for West Zone

Aurangabad: Opener Dheeraj Jadhav struck an unbeaten half-century to guide West Zone to a seven-wicket victory over holders Central Zone and book a berth in the final of the Duleep Trophy tournament on Sunday. 

Requiring to score 137 to win on a crumbling, under-prepared pitch on which 30 wickets fell on the first two days of the four-day clash, hosts West reached the target well inside three days with Jadhav unbeaten on 57 in just over three hours stay. 

West, starting the Day III at 2 without loss, were 81 for three when Maharashtras Jadhav, in the company of seasoned Baroda batsman Jacob Martin (36 not out), steered his team home to 140 for three with an unfinished 59-run stand for the fourth wicket. 

BRIEF SCORES 

Central Zone 206 amp; 150. West Zone 220 amp; 140/3 (Dheeraj Jadhav 57; Abbas Ali 2/24). West Zone won by 7 wkts.

 Lara shows solidarity, out of squad

 Lara?s reply did not satisfy WICB 

London: Captain Brian Lara has been left out of the West Indies squad for the first Test against South Africa after failing to reach agreement with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) over personal endorsement contracts of six other players and him. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul will lead the team in Lara?s absence, the WICB said in a statement on Sunday. 

Lara and six other players were initially not invited to play in the home series against South Africa and Pakistan due to the dispute which centres on a potential clash between West Indies? main sponsor Digicel, and the players? personal deals with Cable amp; Wireless. 

On Friday, the WICB did invite Lara alone to make himself available for the first Test and he said he would respond within 24 hours. 

According to the WICB?s legal counsel Lara was eligible because his contract with Cable amp; Wireless was done with the board?s consent. However, the six others? contracts were signed without the board?s consent. 

But Lara?s reply did not satisfy the WICB. ?Brian Lara gave a non-committal response to the Board?s invitation to make himself available for the match, in which he neither accepted nor rejected the invitation,? the WICB said. 

?In his response, Lara put a proposition to the board that could not have been entertained because it would require players to be selected on the team who were ineligible due to the nature of their endorsement contracts. 

?In the circumstances the board has decided that Lara not be included in the team for the first Test.? 

Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Dwayne Smith, Fidel Edwards and Ravi Rampaul were not included in a squad of 22 invited earlier to make themselves available for the series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Biggest ever win for NZ

 - Zimbabwe lose 20 wkts in a day 

 Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori celebrate on Monday 

Harare: Daniel Vettori took his 200th wicket as New Zealand celebrated a record victory over Zimbabwe on Day II of the first Test on Monday. 

Zimbabwe, out for 59 in the first innings, followed on 393 runs behind, and were then dismissed for 99 to hand New Zealand victory by an innings and 249 runs. It was New Zealands biggest win, surpassing the innings and 185 runs success against Pakistan in Hamilton in 2000-01. 

New Zealand declared their first innings closed on their overnight score of 452 for nine, and dismissed Zimbabwe just after lunch. 

It was Zimbabwes second lowest total, beating by five runs the 54 they were bowled out for by South Africa in Cape Town in March. 

The home side was dismissed for a second time with eight overs remaining in the days play. 

Left-arm spinner Vettori, who took four for 28, became the third New Zealander after Richard Hadlee and Chris Cairns to reach 200 Test wickets. 

Earlier, James Franklin and Chris Martin continued to do the damage, and Zimbabwe, who followed on 393 runs behind, were 37 for two at tea.

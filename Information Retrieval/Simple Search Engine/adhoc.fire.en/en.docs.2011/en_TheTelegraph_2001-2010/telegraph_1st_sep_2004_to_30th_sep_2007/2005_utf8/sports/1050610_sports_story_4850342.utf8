 Sourav hit eight boundaries and a six during his knock 

London: Sourav Ganguly was back among runs as Glamorgan reached 175 for three in reply to Kents mammoth 568 on the second day of the Division One County Championship match at the Sophia Gardens.

At Lords, Surrey were 157 for two against Middlesex. R. Clinton was batting on 73. Irfan Pathan failed to take a wicket during his 12-over spell.

The Indian allrounders 93-ball knock, that included 11 boundaries, and his 98-run partnership with wicketkeeper-batsman Ben Scott (64 not out) guided Middlesex to an imposing total of 437. 

Pathan was castled by Harbhajan Singh, who took two wickets. 

Harbhajans was a marathon bowling spell, as he bowled 35 overs in the innings taking two wickets ? the other being highest scorer Jamie Dalrymple (77) ? giving away 87 runs.

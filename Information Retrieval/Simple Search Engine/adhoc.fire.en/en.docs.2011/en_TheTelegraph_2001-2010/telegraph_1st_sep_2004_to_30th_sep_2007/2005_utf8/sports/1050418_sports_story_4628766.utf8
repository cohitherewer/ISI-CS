Cardiff: Holders Manchester United will play Arsenal in the FA Cup final next month after crushing Newcastle United 4-1 in a largely one-sided semi-final at the Millennium Stadium on Sunday. 

Two goals from Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, his first since injury in November, and efforts from Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo sealed an emphatic victory for United. 

Shola Ameobi scored for Newcastle who looked tired and off the pace following their 1-4 defeat to Sporting that saw them eliminated in the Uefa Cup quarter-finals on Thursday. 

Manchester United effectively had the match won by halftime as goals from Van Nistelrooy after 19 minutes and a 44th minute header from Scholes put them into a commanding lead. 

Second-half strikes from Van Nistelrooy after 58 minutes and Cristiano Ronaldo (76th) sealed United?s place in the final for the 17th time, equalling Arsenal?s record set on Saturday when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-0 in the first semi-final. 

Newcastle?s hopes were briefly revived when Ameobi scored from an acute angle to pull the deficit back to 3-1 after 59 minutes but United were never seriously troubled again and finished as comfortable winners. 

United, who have won the Cup a record 11 times, have never lifted the trophy in successive years, a feat last achieved by Arsenal in 2002 and 2003. United will have a chance to match that achievement by beating the champions in the May 21 final. 

Alex Ferguson?s side will take heart from the fact that they have beaten Arsenal three times already this season ? twice in the Premier League and once in the League Cup. 

Sunday?s match was in stark contrast to Saturday?s encounter at the Millennium Stadium, which is also the venue for the final, when Blackburn?s physically rugged approach ruined the game as a spectacle. 

Although outplayed, Newcastle at least tried to go for goals rather than smother United but the holders were too clever, too fast, always in control and thoroughly deserved to win an eighth successive FA Cup semi-final under Ferguson since 1986. (Reuters)

 Tania amongst leaders, Negi holds 6th seed

 Negi 

Istanbul: WGM Tania Sachdev emerged amongst the 10-leaders with a finely crafted victory over Atousa Pourkashiyan of Iran in the second round of the World Junior Chess Championship here. 

On a mixed day for Indians, Parimarjan Negi impressed once again in the boys section by holding sixth seed GM Wang Yue of China to a creditable draw. 

Eleven players in the boys category and 10 girls emerged as joint leaders and making a strong point was former champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan who disposed the challenge of Levon Babujian of Armenia in the boys section. 

Among the Indian boys in the fray, IM S. Poobesh Anand drew with GM-in-waiting Erwin Lami of The Netherlands. 

Also coming out good were national junior champion G. N. Gopal and Akshath Khamparia who both opened their accounts with commendable victories over Faut Uzun of Turkey and South African De Bruyn Leon. 

However, the highest rated Indian here, Deep Sengupta, who had made his maiden GM norm in the same event last year, failed to use his white pieces to any effect and was beaten by GM Evgeny Tomashevsky of Russia. Also ending on the losing side was G. Rohit who was outdone by Bosnian Borki Predojevic. 

Among the girls, Eesha Karavade suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Ciobanu Camelia of Romania but the countrys best bet, D. Harika came out good to register her first victory against Evgenia Meshcheriakova of Russia.

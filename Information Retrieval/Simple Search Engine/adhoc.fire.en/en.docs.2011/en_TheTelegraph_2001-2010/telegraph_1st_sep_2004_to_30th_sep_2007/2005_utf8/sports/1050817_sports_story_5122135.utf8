Amstelveen: India were dumped out of the medal race by world champions Germany who scored a clinical 2-1 win in a crucial league match of the eight-nation Rabobank Trophy hockey tournament here on Tuesday. 

This second successive defeat for India, who lost their opener to Spain 0-1, means they would now play for the classification matches for the 5-8 places. India are slated to play their last league game against arch-rivals Pakistan on Thursday. 

An early strike by Mitthias Witthaus helped Germany take the lead in the fourth minute. Witthaus shot past Devesh Chauhan after receiving a crosspass from captain Tibor Weissborn. 

In the second half, India put up a spirited show, albeit only in short bursts. They began with thrusts from Rajpal Singh on the right flank but he could not find the desired support from the inside strikers. 

India had two chances to draw level in the second half but failed to sound the board. First, Viren Rasquinhas fine deflection off Bimal Lakras free hit was stopped by Christian Schulte, and shortly after Arjun Halappa failed to latch on to a Deepak Thakurs pass. 

However, Kanwalpreet Singh gave India the equaliser in the 41st minute after their first penalty corner was awarded when Gagan Ajit was obstructed by Benjamin Wess. 

But Indias happiness was shortlived as the Germans pressed on to earn a penalty corner seven minutes later. A dragflick from Florian Keller was palmed away by Chauhan to the waiting Meinert who banged home to give the Germans their winner. 

Coach Rajinder Singh (Jr) rotated his bench strength but the sturdy German defence gave no inroads. Germany had their gameplan well worked out as the key Indian strikers, Gagan Ajit, Prabhjot Singh and Deepak Thakur were well shadowed. 

Australia rout Korea 

Olympic champions Australia demolished South Korea 7-1 in another match. 

The free-flowing Aussies, who led 4-0 at half-time, scored through Grant Schubert (5th and 70th), Michael McCann (18th and 25th), Travis Brooks (22nd), Liam de Young (50th) and Rob Hammond (68th). Hong Eun-seong got the consolation for the Asian Games winners in the 64th minute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sri Lanka visit off indefinitely

Mumbai: Sri Lanka?s proposed visit to India 

for a five-match limited-overs series was Sunday postponed indefinitely. The series, 

which was to be held from April 22 to May 4, was cancelled as the BCCI did not 

receive a confirmation from its Sri Lankan counterpart. 

[That the visit was uncertain because of the problem 

between SLC and the government was reported by The Telegraph on Friday.] 

?In view of the inability of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to confirm the itinerary and the recent developments in the Sri Lankan cricket administration, the committee felt that the matches should be postponed to a mutually convenient date,? BCCI joint secretary Goutam Dasgupta said here after a meeting of the tours, programmes and fixtures committee. 

The meeting was chaired by BCCI vice-president Kamal 

Morarka. Secretary S K Nair did not attend the meeting owing to illness. 

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka take on New Zealand in the first Test in Napier on Monday. 

The two-Test series was originally due to be played 

in January but was postponed because of the Asian tsunami.

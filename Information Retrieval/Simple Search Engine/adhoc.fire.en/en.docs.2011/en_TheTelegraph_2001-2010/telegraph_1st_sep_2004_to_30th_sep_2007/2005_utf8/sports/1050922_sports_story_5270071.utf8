The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhupathi upset to be in wrong channel 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi was hopping mad. Not for anything concerned with this weekends Davis Cup tie versus Sweden, but because the cable TV service at the team hotel in the capital doesnt have the channel telecasting the Sunfeast Open live from Calcutta. 

Im pretty upset, man, Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. 

It was he who was instrumental in bringing the WTA Tour to India, first to Hyderabad, and now, Calcutta. Davis Cup duty had forced him to leave his pet event and fly off to Delhi. But to be denied even the chance to watch the matches on TV was the last thing he wanted. 

He couldnt even hop over to a friends place to watch Sania Mirzas second-round match, as the team had to attend a function in the evening. 

We all had to be there as it was an AITA-organised function to felicitate Anil Khannas election as the ATF president, said Bhupathi.

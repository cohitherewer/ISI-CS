 Jyoti arrives without clubs

Shenzhen: Jyoti Randhawa will start his campaign at the $1.3 million Volvo China Open on Thursday with a new set of clubs as his equipment is yet to arrive from Portugal. 

The Indian star, who is currently third on the Asian Order of Merit, was lucky to have equipment manufacturers give him a new set, but these are different models. 

However, Randhawa tried to push aside the disappointment and was already practising with his new set. 

Maybe the set will arrive before I tee off. But it could either be stuck in Lisbon, London or Shanghai that was the route that we took. Ive got a new set of irons and woods from my equipment sponsors but they are different models, said Randhawa. 

Also in the field are Shiv Kapur, invited by the sponsors, Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon, Gaurav Ghei and Rahil Gangjee.Other top names include Ryder Cup stars Paul Casey and Thomas Levet, Nick Dougherty and Asias finest which includes current Order of Merit leader Thaworn Wiratchant, last seasons No. 1 Thongchai Jaidee, and Chinese home heroes Liang Wen-Chong and 2003 Volvo China Open champion Zhang Lian-Wei.

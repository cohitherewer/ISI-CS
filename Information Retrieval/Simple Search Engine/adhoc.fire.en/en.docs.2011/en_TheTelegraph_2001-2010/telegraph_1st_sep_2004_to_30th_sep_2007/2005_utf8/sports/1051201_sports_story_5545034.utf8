 Pawar calls on Dalmiya

A STAFF REPORTER

 Dalmiya and Pawar 

Calcutta: Keeping his promise of seeking help from Jagmohan Dalmiya, newly-elected BCCI president Sharad Pawar visited his Alipore Road residence at around 11.30 am on Wednesday. While Pawar termed the hour-long discussion as constructive, Dalmiya said he was always available with advice and ideas if his views were sought. 

There are various issues, both at home and abroad, which involve litigation. If not properly handled, this could prove to be a liability to the Board, Pawar said. 

Nobody except Dalmiya knows each and every issue. So? It is my duty to request his co-operation and use his experience in the interest of the Board as well as Indian cricket, he added. 

Pawar and his entourage left the city in the afternoon. 

Dalmiya said at the CAB in the evening: Pawar wanted to be enlightened on issues involving the BCCI and the ICC. I have promised to extend all possible help. 

The ICC Champions Trophy, to be held in India next year, and the possibility of the subcontinent hosting the 2011 World Cup featured in Pawar-Dalmiyas talks. 

The former president, who will attend the working committee meeting in Mumbai on Sunday, came down heavily on Pawar and Co. for dismissing Greg Chappells middle-finger gesture as insignificant. 

How can they dismiss it? Chappell should have apologised. He should have been aware of his responsibilities. Even the sports ministry has sought an explanation, Dalmiya remarked. 

He said the CAB was ready if the Board sought an explanation regarding crowd behaviour during the recent fourth ODI against South Africa. Ive seen a lot more violent barracking before? Suddenly things are being blown out of proportion. Have they forgotten the crowd behaviour at the Kotla after India lost the one-dayer against Pakistan in April?

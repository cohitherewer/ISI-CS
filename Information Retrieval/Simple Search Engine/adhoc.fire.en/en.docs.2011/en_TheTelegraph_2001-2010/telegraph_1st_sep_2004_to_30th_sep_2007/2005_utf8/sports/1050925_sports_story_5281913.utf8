 Chandhok crashes out during practice

London: Asian drivers struggled to make an impact as the new A1 Grand Prix got off to a chaotic start at Brands Hatch on Friday. 

The new championship, which is billed as the World Cup of motorsport, pits nation against nation on the track, with a key feature being the arrival of countries so far unused to the sport. 

But that grand design backfired as rookie drivers found the going tough. 

In the first practice session, Indias Karun Chandhok caused the most spectacular accident when he turned in on ex-Formula One driver Jos Verstappen. The two cars made contact, pitching Chandhok into the air, badly damaging his car. 

Chandhok had already allowed another F1 refugee, Alex Yoong of Malaysia, to pass him, but failed to notice the bright orange Netherlands car of Verstappen, causing the pile-up. Chinas drivers have struggled to match their more experienced rivals in testing and again were caught out in practice. 

Their nominated driver Qinghua Ma spun at the fast paddock hill bend and brought out the red flags once again. 

Collisions are rare in practice, with drivers concentrating on finding the perfect set-up for their cars, but the A1 GP debut bucked that trend. 

The problems continued in the second session, with Japans Ryo Fukuda and Czech driver Jan Charouz both spinning off in quick succession. 

Chandhok had little chance to set a decent time, having only completed two laps but Chinese Ma clocked 13 and was still over nine seconds off the pace. (AFP)

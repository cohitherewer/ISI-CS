Hyderabad: Indian tennis sensation Sania Mirza rallied from a set down to reach the singles semi-finals of the $140,000 WTA Hyderabad Open on Thursday. 

Continuing her dream run before the home crowd, Sania fought back from a first set deficit to beat Tziport Obziler of Israel 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in a pulsating quarter final duel at the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh tennis complex. 

However, the meet lost Martina Navratilova in the doubles after her partner Anna-Lena Groenefeld pulled out of their second round match after aggravating a thigh injury. 

Navratilova and Groenefeld were leading 3-2 in the first set against Akgul Amanmuradova and Tatiana Panova when the German girl pulled out, handing the Uzbek-Russian pair a place in the semi-finals. 

Later Sania and Sikha Uberoi exited from the doubles when they lost to the chinese pair of Zi Yan and Jie Zheng 5-7, 1-6. 

The 18-year-old Sania, fresh from a historic run at the Australian Open, will now take on Maria Kirilenko of Russia who stunned top seed Li Na of China 6-4, 6-3 earlier in the day. 

The other semi-final will be between Anna-Lena Groenefeld of Germany and Alyona Bondarenko of Ukraine. 

 Sania applauds a shot 

 by her quarter final opponent Tziport Obziler in Hyderabad 

 on Thursday. 

Groenefeld beat Tian Tian Sun of China 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 while Bondarenko beat Marie-Eve Pelletier of Canada 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. 

Obziler, the world number 115, started on a confident note, breaking Sania to go 4-3 up in the seventh game. 

But it was a different ball game in the second set as Sania rallied brilliantly to gain the upperhand. She then raced to a 5-2 lead in no time before wrapping it up 6-3. 

The 18-year old, who became the first Indian woman to reach a Grand Slam third round at the Australian Open, raised her game several notches to take an early 3-0 lead in the decider and looked like running away with the match. 

But Obziler had different ideas. She hung on and patiently worked her way up. She broke Sania in the fourth game and again in the sixth to level the scores. 

Sania, realising that it was a do or die battle, played her heart out to reach to the brink of victory only to let slip the advantage. 

She was leading 5-3 before allowing her opponent to come back into the match. What followed was a tense tie-breaker which had the crowd at the edge of their seats. 

It was 5-5 in the tie-breaker, but it was Sania who held her nerve to emerge victorious. 

?Yes, she put good pressure on me,? Sania admitted after the match. 

Kirilenko, coached by former WTA Tour player Elena Brioukhovets, broke Li in the ninth game to go 5-4 in the opener and there was no stopping the Russian thereafter. 

In the second set, the girl from Moscow took a commanding 5-1 lead, rattling the Chinese who had won as many as five ITF titles at home last year. 

Li, who tried hard to stage a comeback, did succeed briefly and made it 3-5 before Kirilenko shut her out of the match.

 Zidane scores on comeback 

 Zidane is ecstatic after scoring on Wednesday 

Montpellier: Zinedine Zidane marked his international comeback with a goal in Frances 3-0 win over Ivory Coast in a friendly on Wednesday. 

The Real Madrid playmaker, returning to the France team with Juventus defender Lilian Thuram and Chelsea midfielder Claude Makelele, treated the fans to some tricks but failed to make a real impact until his goal shortly after the hour. 

Before and after, defender William Gallas and striker Thierry Henry celebrated their 28th birthdays with goals in the 28th and 67th minutes. 

In Split, Croatia held Brazil 1-1 in a friendly dominated by the world champions. 

The home sides early hard work paid off in the 32nd minute when CSKA Moscow forward Ivica Olic hit the post and Niko Kranjcar slotted in the rebound. 

Brazil hit back 10 minutes later when Ricardinho sent an 18-metre free-kick into the top right-hand corner of the net.

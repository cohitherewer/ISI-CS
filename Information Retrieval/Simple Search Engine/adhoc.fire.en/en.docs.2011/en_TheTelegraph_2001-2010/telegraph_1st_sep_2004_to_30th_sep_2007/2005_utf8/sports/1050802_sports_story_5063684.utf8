 Alonso keeps in high spirits

 - Raikkonen victory fails to dampen leadership race 

 Alonso 

Budapest: Renaults Fernando Alonso kept his head up after McLaren rival Kimi Raikkonen bit a sizeable chunk out of his Formula One lead in Hungary. 

Despite Renaults failure to score points in a race dominated by the Finn, now 26 points behind the Spaniard with six races remaining, Alonso knows he is still the clear championship favourite. 

July, a key month with four races in close succession, had been good to him. 

We started this month with a 22 points lead and we end it with 26 and four races less (to do), said Alonso, who has won six of the 13 Grands Prix so far but finished 11th on Sunday. The balance is very good. 

Here it was our turn to suffer... Now its time to rest, to prepare the final sprint, and weve got a good advantage. 

Hungary was Raikkonens fourth win of the season and the Finn has 61 points to the Spaniards 87. The Finn is up for the fight, vowing to turn the screw on a man who left Budapest empty-handed after his 24th birthday but remains on course to become Formula Ones youngest champion. 

However, Raikkonens triumph could not mask the fact that the Mercedes-powered team had missed yet another gilt-edged opportunity. 

With Renault struggling, and Alonso hobbled by a poor tyre choice and a first corner tangle with Ralf Schumacher, McLaren should have finished one-two. (Reuters)

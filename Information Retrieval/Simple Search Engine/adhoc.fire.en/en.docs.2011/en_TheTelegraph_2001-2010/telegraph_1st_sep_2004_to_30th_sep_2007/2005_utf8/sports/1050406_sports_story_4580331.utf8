The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Want to keep momentum going: Dhoni

 - Good to see a wicketkeeper contributing with the bat: Sourav 

NILESH BHATTACHARYA 

Visakhapatnam: When Mahendra Singh Dhoni came out in the middle at No. 3 following the dismissal of Sachin Tendulkar, very few had an inkling about how he would shape up in this new role. 

The hero in India?s 58-run triumph over Pakistan at the ACA Stadium here was awe-inspiring and effectively blocked all possible escape routes for Inzamam-ul Haq amp; Co. to make a comeback. 

?May be I was lucky that I was able to justify the team?s faith on me,? Dhoni, who scored 148, told The Telegraph after the match on Tuesday. Describing the knock as his ?best?, Dhoni revealed that initially it was ?a big innings and not the century? that was on his mind. 

Dhoni accompanied teammates to have a close look at the strip during nets in the morning. Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid returned to the pavilion with the observation that it would crumble towards the end. Promptly, Dhoni was asked to be on his toes. 

As it turned out, Sourav won the toss again and Dhoni was pressed into service. ?When we saw the pitch in the morning, we got scared that it wouldn?t last 50 overs and might crumble towards the end. So Dhoni was promoted as a pinch-hitter, hoping to get some quick runs on the board. But we were proved wrong as the pitch turned out to be excellent for batting,? the Team India captain admitted in the post-match press conference. 

Sourav?s gesture at Dhoni after Sachin?s dismissal could have taken the Pakistan camp by surprise, but the 23-year-old Jharkhand player said he was ?mentally prepared? for the job. ?It became easier once Rahul came into the middle.,? confessed Dhoni. 

The wicketkeeper, who idolises Adam Gilchrist, pointed out that last year?s India A tour of Zimbabwe-Kenya played a huge part in building his self-belief. ?I just want to keep the momentum going,? he said. 

He could draw inspiration from Sourav?s backing as well. ?Rahul kept for us for quite a long time. And it?s good to see a wicketkeeper contributing with the bat. It?s a relief for the entire team,? the Team India captain added. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was all praise. ?It was an outstanding innings. But don?t forget that our bowlers offered him too much width,? he remarked.

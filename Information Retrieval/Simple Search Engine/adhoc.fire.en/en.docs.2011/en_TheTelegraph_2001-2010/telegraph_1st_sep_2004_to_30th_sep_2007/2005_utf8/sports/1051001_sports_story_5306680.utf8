 Sanskara upstages Rasalas 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Dispelling all doubts about her staying prowess, the Bharath Singh-trained prized filly, Sanskara upstaged the strongly-fancied Rasalas in the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes, the star event in Fridays race card. Suraj Narredu gave a well-judged ride to the Dont Forget Me-Shiseido filly ? a 5-1 shot.

 It was a fairly paced race with Daniel Davids Retained Asset doing all the donkey-work for her better-fancied stablemate, Rasalas, till the 800m marker. But Suraj took the matter in his hands from that point. He pushed Sanskara into a two-length lead as jockey B.Prakash, on the favourite, also improved places to be right behind the leader.

 A close finish looked much on the cards when Rasalas came abreast of the leader in the final 200 metres. But the Nanoli Stud Million winner was soon back in command to set the matter straight, prompting Suraj to punch the air. Ardennes, placed a poor third.

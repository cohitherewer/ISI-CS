Toronto: US Masters champion Phil Mickelson claimed consecutive PGA Tour titles for the first time in his career with a four-stroke victory at the $5.3 million Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California on Sunday. 

The world No. 4, seven shots clear at the start of the day, held off a strong challenge from fellow left-hander Mike Weir as a one-over-par 73 earned him his 25th Tour win in difficult conditions. 

Mickelson, who also triumphed at last week?s Phoenix Open, mixed two birdies with three bogeys on the Pebble Beach Golf Links course to finish on 19-under 269, one stroke shy of the tournament record for 72 holes set by fellow-American Mark O?Meara in 1997. 

?It?s been fun, it sure feels great to start this way,? said 1998 Pebble Beach winner Mickelson. ?I?ve been playing well the last couple of weeks and I?m excited to get the year started with a couple of wins.? 

Canadian Weir, the 2003 US Masters champion, had to settle for second place on 15-under after firing a 67, the best round of a cool and blustery day on the picturesque Monterey Peninsula. 

Britain?s Greg Owen, playing in his first PGA Tour event of the season, was a further two shots back in third place after closing with a 72. South Africa?s Tim Clark (71) built on his brilliant early season form to finish in a tie for fourth with Paul Goydos (71) on 12-under 276. 

India?s Arjun Atwal brought in a par-72 card on the final day to finish the tournament with an aggregate seven-under 281. He ended tied 16th with nine others, including the likes of Spain?s Jose Maria Olazabal, South Korea?s KJ Choi and Sweden?s Daniel Chopra. 

Early in the round, Mickelson stretched his advantage to nine shots. But after back-to-back bogeys on the ninth and 10th, concern was written on the 34-year-old?s face in the knowledge that Weir was then five back. Mickelson, however, steadied himself with a birdie and seven consecutive pars to become the first wire-to-wire winner in the 68-year history of the event. (Reuters)

 Mani backs ban on Sourav 

 Mani feels Sourav got a middle-level ban 

Dubai: International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani has defended the six-match ODI ban on Team India captain Sourav Ganguly and urged the national boards to respect the verdicts of the match officials. 

Once we set up a process, we must respect the integrity of that process. If we try to change it each time because someone does not like the decision, then it will be meaningless, Mani was quoted as saying by a Dubai newspaper on Thursday. 

Mani said the ban on Sourav was in accordance with the regulations approved by the member countries and as such, the punishment was neither mild nor harsh. 

As per the rules, one can be banned for a minimum of four matches or a maximum of eight matches. Ganguly got a middle-level ban, he said. 

The Team India captain was banned for six ODIs following his teams slow over rate twice during the home series against Pakistan. 

Asked if the punishment was a bit too harsh he said: This decision was taken by the Match Referee and hence I cannot comment on it. 

Mani, who was here for the ground breaking ceremony of the new ICC headquarters, said: We wanted all our units to be working under one roof. The ICC will be a more efficient and effective organisation when all our units starts operating from Dubai. 

Meanwhile, president of the West Indies Cricket Board Teddy Griffith said the preparations for the 2007 World Cup was going on in full swing.

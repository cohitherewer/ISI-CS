 Shoaib must not rush back: Imran

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan Monday advised speedster Shoaib Akhtar, who missed the tour of India owing to a hamstring injury, not to rush his comeback to international cricket. 

?Any bowler in the world requires match fitness after such a long lay-off. But when it comes to Shoaib Akhtar, he needs more fitness because he bowls at such pace that until everything is correct and in rhythm, he wouldn?t be destructive,? Imran said. 

?I know for myself that express fast bowlers need more time than mediumpacers. When I say fitness, I mean match fitness. His match fitness has to be top class. I would advise him not to rush his return,? the former Pakistan captain said. 

Meanwhile, a Pakistani paper Monday quoted PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan as saying that the final decision on Shoaib Akhtar joining the team would be taken this week. 

?Shoaib has resumed bowling in the nets according to Grant Compton (trainer) whom I spoke to on Monday after the Test match. 

?He says if Shoaib doesn?t feel any strain in his hamstring after three or four days of regular bowling in the nets then he can be available for the one-day series starting from April 2,? Shaharyar said. 

?I would say at this stage that he has 50 per cent chance of joining the team for the one-dayers,? he added.

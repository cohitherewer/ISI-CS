 Moscow: CSKA beat Dynamo 2-1 in a heated Moscow derby on Sunday to clinch the Russian premier league title with a game to spare. CSKA defender Alexei Berezutsky opened the scoring from close range in the 55th minute and Brazilian playmaker Daniel Carvalho added the second when he beat Dynamos Portuguese keeper Nuno with a neat lob 18 minutes later.

 D efender Denis Kolodin pulled one back for Dynamo in the seventh minute of added time but it was too little too late to prevent the army side from celebrating a deserved victory.

 The win gave UEFA Cup holders CSKA an insurmountable four-point lead over last year?s champions Lokomotiv and their Moscow rivals Spartak with just one round of matches remaining.

 Las Vegas: A knee injury to Ukrainian Vitali Klitschko has forced the postponement of his anticipated World Boxing Council heavyweight title showdown against Hasim Rahman on November 12, promoter Bob Arum said.

 The announcement on Saturday came a week before the fight was scheduled to take place at the Thomas and Mack Center.

 Ukraine?s Klitschko injured the knee in training on Thursday. He thought he might be able to fight with a brace on his knee, but found that it hindered his movement too much.

 A statement from Arum?s Top Rank Promotions said the entire card would be cancelled and a new date for Klitschko-Rahman announced soon.

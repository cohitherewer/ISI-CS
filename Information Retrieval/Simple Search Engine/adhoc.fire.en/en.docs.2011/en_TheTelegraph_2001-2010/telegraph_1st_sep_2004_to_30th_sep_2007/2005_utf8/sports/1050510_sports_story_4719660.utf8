The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I have it in me to take India to next level

 - Its because of my self-belief that (Greg) Chappell doesnt overawe me, says Tom Moody 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Greg Chappell is a huge name, but 

 its not insignificant that one-time allrounder Tom 

 Moody has also cleared the first hurdle in seeking 

 to wear the Team India coachs hat. 

The youngest among four shortlisted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Moody (39) is confident of making a winning presentation during his interview. 

As of now, Chappell, Moody, Mohinder Amarnath and Sandeep Patil will be interviewed by the specially constituted six-member committee before the month is out. 

The committee includes former captains Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri. 

?John Wright did a terrific job for four-and-half years and Indias ready for the next level? I have it in me to help take the team there... I have it in me to make an impact? Obviously, Im not short on confidence,? Moody told The Telegraph. 

Contacted on Monday afternoon, Moody (Worcestershires director of cricket) added: ?Its because of my self-belief that Chappell doesnt overawe me? Of course, I respect him as also the other two on the shortlist? Its thrilling to be in their company.? 

Asked just how confident he was of getting past the CVs scrutiny stage, Moody replied: ?I was hopeful? But, then, certain things in life are beyond your control ? one being how an application is going to be received? Im happy mine got accepted.? 

Is his age a plus or a spoiler? 

Moody laughed: ?Yes, I dont have decades of experience, but I dont think age is a factor? Its all about the ability to communicate and being conversant with what needs to be done? I sent my CV as I believe I can make the most of an excellent opportunity.? 

A member of two World Cup-winning Australian squads (1987 and 1999), Moody has been at Worcestershire since 2001. 

His contract runs till September, but Moody informed theres a clause which allows him to pitch for an international assignment even before the ongoing season ends. 

Listing what a coach needed to do at the highest level, Moody said: ?Preparation is the key? He has to help individuals and the team reach potential? The challenge is utilising talent in the most productive manner?? 

Describing Team India as ?exciting,? Moody observed the ?emergence of gifted youngsters? had caught his eye the most. 

Moody, by the way, confirmed having been approached by the Sri Lankans, who are scouting for John Dysons successor. 

Perfectly understandably, he offered a straight bat (?no comments?) when asked what would he do if both India and Lanka offered contracts. 

Significantly, sources in England are convinced Moody (?a very fine coach and man manager?) will be a frontrunner ? assuming hes available ? to succeed Duncan Fletcher if he decides not to stay till 2007. 

The former Zimbabwe captains contract with the ECB gets renewed annually. Unusual, but Fletcher has himself opted for such an arrangement. 

Apparently, nothing is being read into Moody not getting the directorship of Englands Loughborough-located National Academy. 

 Rodney Marshs successor there is going to be 

 Sussex coach Peter Moores.

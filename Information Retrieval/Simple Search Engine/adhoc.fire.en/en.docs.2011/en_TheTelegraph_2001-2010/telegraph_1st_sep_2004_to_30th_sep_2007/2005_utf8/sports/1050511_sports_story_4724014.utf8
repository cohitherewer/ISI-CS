The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East Bengal to play for pride 

 - AFC CUP TIE versus MUKTIJODDHA 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Subhas Bhowmick nurtures no hopes 

Calcutta: East Bengal will have only pride at stake when they take on Muktijoddha Sansad in the AFC Cup in Dhaka on Wednesday. 

East Bengal, having lost to Al Faisaly and Nebitchi FC away and drawn a couple of other matches, have the slimmest of chances of going through to the next round. 

Coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, is not looking at any miracle and has accepted the reality. ?Weve no chance now. Were out of the tournament and well be playing for the sake of participation? thats it,? he said, when contacted in Dhaka on Tuesday evening. 

With the National Football League crown also almost out of their hands, is a lack of motivation creeping in the red-and-gold camp? Bhowmick shot back, insisting his team will take to the field with professional attitude. 

?Like professionals, tomorrow our objective will be to win the match. But I will also see to it that we dont lose it. A draw in an away match is good for me,? he maintained. 

With Bhaichung Bhutia in hospital and Alvito DCunha also injured, East Bengal coach will certainly find it difficult to reinforce his upfront. Marcos Secco and Selwyn Fernandes also miss the tie due to double booking. 

East Bengal will host Turkmenistans Nebitchi at the Salt Lake Stadium on May 25. 

Bhowmick, his assistant Bikash Panji and defender Debjit Ghosh joined the squad at the Bangabandhu Stadium on Tuesday morning. They had a practice in the evening. ?Everybody in the squad is in good shape,? informed Bhowmick. 

The match starts at 5.30 pm (Bangaldesh time). 

Meanwhile, in another match, Dempo SC will meet Al-Ahed Club of Lebanon at the Nehru Stadium in Margao on Wednesday. Dempo have lost all three group B matches and they are treating it as a preparation for the crucial NFL tie against East Bengal slated for May 16, says an agency report from Goa. 

According to Dempo coach Armando Colaco, key players like R.C. Prakash, Riston Rodrigues, Nacimento Silveira, Melvin Rodriuges and Valariano Rebello would be rested keeping in mind the match versus East Bengal.

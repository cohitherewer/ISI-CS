Kanpur: India and Pakistan cricket teams arrived here Wednesday night to play in the fifth one-day International match on Friday. 

The teams, which arrived here by road from Lucknow, checked into a city hotel amidst tight security arrangements. 

A big crowd of fans thronged the shopping complex near the hotel located in the centre of the city to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars. 

The six match series is now level at 2-2 after Pakistan staged a superb comeback winning the last two matches in Jamshedpur and Ahmedabad. (PTI)

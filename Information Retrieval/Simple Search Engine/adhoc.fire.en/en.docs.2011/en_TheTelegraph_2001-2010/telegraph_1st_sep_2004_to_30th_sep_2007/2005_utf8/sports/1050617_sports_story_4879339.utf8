 Cash slap on organisers face 

 Pat Cash 

London: Former champion Pat Cash strongly criticised Wimbledon organisers on Wednesday after his fellow Australian Lleyton Hewitt was seeded third in mens singles. 

Hewitt, the 2002 Wimbledon champion, is second in the world rankings but organisers handed the No. 2 seeding to world No. 4 Andy Roddick on Wednesday because of the Americans better recent form on grass. 

I think its a real slap in the face, Cash, who won Wimbledon in 1987, said. I dont think its fair that they should be changing it around. 

As second seed, Roddick, who lost in last years final to Roger Federer, cannot meet the Swiss top seed until the final of this years tournament. Third seed Hewitt could face Federer in the semi-finals. 

Lleyton Hewitt is the number two player in the world, Cash said.He should have stayed number two. He is a Wimbledon champion. He is the (2005) Australian Open finalist. 

I dont like them tinkering with the seeds. The guys work the whole year to get rankings to win the Grand Slams. 

It has certainly given Roddick a boost that I dont think he deserves over Hewitt. The rankings are there for a reason. They are fair. 

Unlike the other Grand Slam events, Wimbledon has traditionally varied its seedings from the official rankings in order to reflect players strengths on grass.

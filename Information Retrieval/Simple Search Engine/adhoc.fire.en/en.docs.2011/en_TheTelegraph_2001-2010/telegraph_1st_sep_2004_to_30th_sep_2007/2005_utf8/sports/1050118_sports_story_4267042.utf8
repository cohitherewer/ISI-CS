Dhaka: Bangladesh were set a daunting victory target in the second and final Test after Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu scored a fine maiden Test century. 

Chasing a mammoth 374 to complete a 2-0 sweep, Bangladesh laboured to 98 without loss at stumps on Monday. The hosts need 276 to win on the final day. Nafis Iqbal is unbeaten on 55 and Javed Omar on 36. Their unbeaten stand is Bangladesh?s best in 36 Tests. 

Omar was dropped on five by Hamilton Masakadza off Christopher Mpofu in the third over when the score was seven. Bangladesh?s previous record partnership of 91 was also against Zimbabwe, in the first Test in Chittagong. 

Iqbal played 161 balls and hit seven fours, while Javed Omar faced 187 with two boundaries. Zimbabwe skipper Tatenda Taibu used eight bowlers who failed to make the breakthrough in 57 overs. 

Earlier, the tourists were bowled out for 286 in their second innings just after lunch, with Taibu smashing 19 fours and two sixes in his 153. 

Enamul Haq Junior was Bangladesh?s best bowler, taking Zimbabwe?s last four wickets to finish with figures of five for 105. He thus finished with a tally of 12 in the match. 

The 18-year-old left-arm spinner became the first Bangladesh player to take 10 or more wickets in a match when he trapped Graeme Cremer leg-before for nought.

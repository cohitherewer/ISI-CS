 Murali fit to resume bowling

Colombo: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan has been given the all-clear to resume bowling and start the second stage of his rehabilitation from shoulder injury. 

Muralidharan will travel to England on Monday to start pre-season training with Lancashire and hopes to regain full fitness by end of April and possibly play a one-day match against Glamorgan on April 17. 

?The shoulder is feeling great and although it feels stiff in the morning it is now completely pain free when I bowl,? Muralidharan said. 

Sri Lanka Cricket?s (SLC) Melbourne-based surgeon Dr. David Young declared himself satisfied with the shoulder after a consultation earlier this week. (Reuters)

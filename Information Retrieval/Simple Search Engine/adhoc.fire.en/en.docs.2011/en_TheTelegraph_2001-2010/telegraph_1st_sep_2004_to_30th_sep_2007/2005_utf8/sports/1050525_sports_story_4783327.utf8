 Agassi record wont be broken: Moya

Paris: Andre Agassi is setting a new record of 58 Grand Slams played at the French Open this year and its a mark that most agree will never be broken. 

Former French Open champion Carlos Moya believes such a landmark is safe with modern day tennis young guns Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova facing short, sharp careers as the gruelling demands of the tour take their toll. 

The 35-year-old Agassi however had an early exit, losing 5-7, 6-4, 7-6, 1-6, 0-6 to Jarkko Nieminen in the first round. 

Agassi has been on the Tour since 1986, but Moya, a comparatively youthful 28, is convinced that record will never be broken. 

When we talk about Andre, we are talking about a great champion, said Moya, the champion here in 1998. 

Hes amazing, hes one of the favourites. I admire him and I think hes great for tennis. 

But besides Andre, you dont see too many players over 30 now. Thats a sign. Its really hard to be playing at such a high level every week. 

Agassi, bidding to become the oldest mens French Open champion, has now gone past the 57 Grand Slam mark shared by himself, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, Michael Chang and Wayne Ferreira. 

Agassis achievements, which have included eight career Grand Slam titles, were also praised by womens top seed Lindsay Davenport. 

Andres on a level of his own. Its insane what hes been able to accomplish at his age, she said. (AFP)

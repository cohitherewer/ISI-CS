The Telegraph - Calcutta

Calcutta: The second Tsunami fund-raiser match ? between an ICC XI and an Asia XI ? will be held, as expected, on February 13 at the Eden. It will be a day-nighter. This was confirmed here on Thursday by Jagmohan Dalmiya, ACC president and constitutionally still the BCCI president. 

A slogan has been prepared for this match: ?Cricket for Humanity.? 

Having overcome the sticky part of the short-life trust ? that is scheduled to take in the funds, pre-distribution ? the decision on the venue and basic logistics were cleared at the ACC level in consultation with the Union finance ministry. 

Dalmiya had been following this up, and ?the thing was cleared when I met finance minister P. Chidambaram on Tuesday,? he said. ?The trust was obviously necessary because it wasn?t possible for the Indian government to provide tax exemption to a foreign body (in this case the ACC). 

?The revenue department of the Union government is now busy working out the nuts and bolts of the trust and the ACC legal cell is also involved,? he said. 

The idea is to raise funds for those affected by the tsunami tragedy. The distribution of the funds has yet to be finalised, but ?maybe after the (charitable) trust is dissolved money might directly be sent to the respective affected countries,? Dalmiya said. 

It isn?t sure if ticket sales will be big. It was learnt that the tickets aren?t likely to be highly priced. It was also learnt that even members will have to pay to watch. How much, will be decided later. 

The first match raised a massive $11 million-plus, hence the target for this match remains sky-high. All these details, including a possible target figure, will be brainstormed later, but what possibly has to be kept in mind is that people might just be desensitised enough to care a little less, perhaps. 

Hence, it was learnt, the possible lower than expected price of tickets.

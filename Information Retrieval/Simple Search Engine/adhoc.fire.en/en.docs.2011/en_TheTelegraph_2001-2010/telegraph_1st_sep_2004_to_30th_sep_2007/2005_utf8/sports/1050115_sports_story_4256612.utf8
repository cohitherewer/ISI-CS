 London: The earliest known footage of Manchester United ? filmed in 1902 when they were little more than a cash-strapped local works side ? will be broadcast on British television later this month.

 The scratchy, black-and-white footage is from a match against Burnley at their Turf Moor ground on December 6, 1902.

 It was made to be shown to workers at the Burnley Mechanics Institute that evening but the screening was cancelled because Burnley were defeated 0-2. The film was then lost for nearly a century before being discovered in a barrel in the basement of a shop in Lancashire.

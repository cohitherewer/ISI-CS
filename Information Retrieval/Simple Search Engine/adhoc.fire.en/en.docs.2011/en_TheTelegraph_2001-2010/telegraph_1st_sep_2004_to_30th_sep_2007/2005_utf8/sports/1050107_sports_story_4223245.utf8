Chennai: Sport can, at times, be very cruel. One moment it takes you tantalisingly close to glory, and before long, hauls you down to earth with a big thud. It was one such miserable day for Chinese Taipei youngster Yen-Hsun Lu at the SDAT Stadium Thursday. 

A first-ever ATP quarter-final berth beckoned both sixth-seeded Lu and Kristof Vliegen, but it was the unseeded Belgian who tasted success by turning the match on its head. 

Seemingly down and out for the count at 1-6, 2-5,Vliegen won five games on the trot to level set scores. In the decider, the Belgian again trailed 2-5 and faced two match-points in the eighth game before managing to squeeze out a 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (10-8) verdict. 

The drama in that match featuring two relatively little-known players was higher in intensity than the one witnessed on centre court. Here, too, a seeded player bowed to a lower-ranked opponent, with Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu packing off No. 5 seed Kenneth Carlsen 6-3, 7-5. But at least here, the bottomline matched the trend of the match. 

Those two upsets on Day 4 meant six of the eight seeds have gone out before the quarter-final stage. In Chennai, at least, it?s been more of a rule than an exception in the nine years the city has been hosting this meet. 

The big two, of course, are very much alive and on course for a rematch of that memorable 2004 final. Carlos Moya is already in the quarters, Paradorn Srichaphan joined him with on Thursday evening. 

The second-seeded Thai strolled past French qualifier Nicolas Devilder 6-3, 6-2. Srichpahan will next face Vliegen. 

Lu, the great Chinese hope who promises to join Srichaphan as flag-bearers of Asian tennis, did everything against Vliegen but win. He raced through the opening set in 23 minutes, not letting Vliegen hold serve even once. Then, as he moved closer to shutting the Belgian out, developed cold feet. Not once, but thrice. 

Hitting the ball flat and deep off both flanks and getting a high percentage of first serves in, the 21-year-old Lu had Vliegen crying out for divine intervention. His prayer was answered, in the form of fragile nerves. 

The world No. 86, whose biggest victory last year was against world No. 4 Guillermo Coria, played his normally well-tuned tennis till he came within a game of closing out the match. 

Suddenly, Lu?s game fell to pieces. He missed the lines which he was hitting so regularly, netted simple overheads and went for lobs which is one shot he is yet to master. 

Vliegen, who grew up playing in the same club as Kim Clijsters, was quick to spot his opponent?s weakness. The 22-year-old, ranked No. 114, slowed things down and made Lu wait in between points. In the end, all he had to do was keep the ball in play and let Lu make the mistakes. 

Lu was at the receiving end of at least half-a-dozen line calls. The general level of calling was quite appalling, but the Belgian suffered less than the Chinese. Even a couple of overrules from the chair umpire went against Lu. But the fact remains that he would have still won had he not choked on the big points. 

Mathieu had worked his way up to the top-40 in the world in 2002 before a series of injuries cut him in full flight. Last year, it was at this very tournament that he injured his wrist and was out of tennis for six months. 

Enjoying an injury-free period, Mathieu showed why he was considered a future champion two years ago. Even on a day when his serve was below-par, the Geneva resident managed to hold off the left-handed Carlsen with some scintillating play from the baseline. 

Taking the first set on a single break, Mathieu found himself 2-4 down in the second. That was when the Frenchman showed his class, pounding fierce two-fisted backhand returns consistently to break back immediately. Mathieu broke again in the 11th game to close out the match in an hour and 40 minutes. 

Next up for Mathieu is Moya, who he beat in five sets in the Davis Cup semi-final last September. 

 Indian challenge 

Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic remained on track for a Sunday showdown with Mahesh Bhupathi and Jonas Bjorkman. The second-seeded Indo-Serbian pair overcame Karsten Braasch and Robert Lindstedt 6-2, 7-6 (9-7) in the quarter finals to finish off the nights proceedings. They will now face Yen-Hsun Lu and Rainer Schuettler, who ousted Ashley Fisher and Tripp Phillips 6-2, 1-6, 6-4. 

In the other semi-final, top seeds Bhupathi and Bjorkman will take on Kevin Kim and Jiri Vanek. 

 QUARTER FINAL LINE-UP 

Carlos Moya (Esp, 1) vs Paul-Henri Mathieu (Fra), Michal Tabara (Cze) vs Guillermo Garcia-Lopez (Esp), Tomas Zib (Cze) vs Justin Gimelstob (US), Kristof Vliegen (Bel) vs Paradorn Srichaphan (Tha, 2).

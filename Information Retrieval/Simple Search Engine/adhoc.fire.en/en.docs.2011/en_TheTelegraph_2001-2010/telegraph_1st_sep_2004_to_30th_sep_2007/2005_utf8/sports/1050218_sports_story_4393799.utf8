The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Central cruise to 6-wkt win

 - Duleep Trophy

 East let Kaif?s men off hook after early inroads 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni claimed eight victims in the match 

Gwalior: Suresh Raina and Abbas Ali held their nerve on a tricky track to guide Central Zone to a six-wicket win over East Zone in the Duleep Trophy league match here on Thursday. 

Left-handers Raina and Ali shared a 55-run stand for the fourth wicket and helped Central overcome minor hiccups to reach the target of 137 with more than a day and half to spare at the Roop Singh Stadium. 

Raina cracked a valuable 31 while Ali remained unbeaten on 47 as the two guided Central home from a precarious 37 for three. 

Raina?s plucky 84-minute knock contained four boundaries and came off 56 balls while Ali faced 51 balls and struck eight boundaries during his 103-minute stay at the crease. 

Naman Ojha, the other not out batsman (19), got the winning runs ? an uppish drive to the extra-cover fence off Ranadeb Bose in the sixth over after lunch on Day 3. 

Resuming at seven for one, Central negotiated the first hour through some dour batting by skipper Mohammed Kaif (17) and Sanjay Bangar (9). 

Bangar was the more cautious partner in the 28-run stand (off 105 balls in 81 minutes), his runs coming off 74 balls and 123 minutes. 

Given the fact that 31 wickets tumbled on the first two days, their approach was understandable. 

Their association was broken when a sharp in-cutter from Sanjib Sanyal trapped Kaif plumb in front. 

Bangar then fended at a Bose delivery and Mahendra Singh Dhoni took a tumbling catch in front of first slip. This was the wicketkeeper?s eighth victim of the match. 

But East failed to apply pressure and let Central off the hook with some wayward bowling. Sanyal, in particular, was guilty of pitching too short. But both Raina and Ali tackled him adequately and were in complete control of their shots. 

Kaif said the teams deserved a better wicket. 

?It wasn?t a great wicket to be honest, for a first-class match before an international series... But you can?t help it, just have to take whatever comes your way,? the Central skipper said. (PTI)

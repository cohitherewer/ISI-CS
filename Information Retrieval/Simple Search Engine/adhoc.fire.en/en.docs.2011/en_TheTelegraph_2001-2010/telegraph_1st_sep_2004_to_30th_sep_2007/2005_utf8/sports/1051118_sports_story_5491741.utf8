 Nehra pitches in for seniors

 Nehra feels nobody is permanent 

New Delhi: Left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra said coach Greg Chappell was right to give the youngsters an opportunity to prove themselves but senior players who have been left out of the team should be given a chance to comeback if they consistently prove their fitness and form. 

Nehra said he did not see any ulterior motive on anyones part in Baroda pacer Zaheer Khan or any other senior player being kept out of the Indian team. 

Chappell wants good players to come in and be given an opportunity. Nobody is permanent in the team. Senior bowlers like Zaheer, if they do well, should be picked. If not now, later, Nehra said. 

The left-arm speedster said he was targeting the Pakistan series early next year for his comeback into the Indian team after a niggle that has put him out of action for the past two months. Nehra said he began training six weeks ago and has been running and sprinting but was yet to touch the ball. 

It is never easy to get back into the national team. And it is not just me. If someone like Sourav Ganguly can be left out after scoring runs (in domestic cricket)... Everyone has been performing, so it is going to be tough, he said.

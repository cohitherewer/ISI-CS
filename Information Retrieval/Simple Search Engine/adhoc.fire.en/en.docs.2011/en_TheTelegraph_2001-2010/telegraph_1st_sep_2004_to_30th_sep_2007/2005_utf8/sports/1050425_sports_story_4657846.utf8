The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Scott claims title off cliff-hanger

Beijing: Australia?s Adam Scott completed a wire-to-wire victory at the Johnnie Walker Classic Sunday despite a scare in the final round. 

The world number 10 had led from the start of the $ 2.3 million tournament but he almost suffered a collapse Sunday and allowed South Africa?s Retief Goosen to close to within one shot. 

Scott?s nerves held, however, and he produced a gritty even-par 72 to finish on an 18-under total of 270, giving him his ninth career title. 

?Today was tough in the wind but I did what I needed to do and I?m proud of myself for that,? said Scott. 

US Open champion Goosen settled for second place on 15-under after a closing 70 while three men tied for third a further two strokes back. 

Scott set a course record with a 63 in the first round and his halfway total of 15-under 129 matched the tournament best for the first 36 holes. 

His problems began when he double-bogeyed the 18th while completing his third-round 69 on Sunday morning, reducing his advantage from seven shots to five. 

The majority of players were finishing their third rounds early on Sunday after heavy winds forced the abandonment of play in Thursday?s first round at Beijing?s Pine Valley. 

Scott showed signs of wilting under pressure from Goosen in the final round as he dropped shots on the ninth and tenth holes. 

But the 24-year-old responded with birdies at the 12th and 13th holes to halt the South African?s run. 

World number five Goosen won the tournament in Perth two years ago but failed to make enough putts to profit from Scott?s wobble. Scott?s victory was worth $ 388,000 and took his career prize money to more than $7 million. 

South Africa?s Richard Sterne, former champion Michael Campbell of New Zealand and Swede Henrik Stenson tied for third on 13-under 275. World number three Ernie Els of South Africa finished joint sixth with Britains Colin Montgomerie and Australian Brett Rumford a further shot behind.

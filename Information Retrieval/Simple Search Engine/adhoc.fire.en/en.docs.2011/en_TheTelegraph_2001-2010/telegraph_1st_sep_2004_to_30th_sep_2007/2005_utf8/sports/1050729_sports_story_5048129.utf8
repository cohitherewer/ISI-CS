 Vaas remains in doubt

Dambulla: Worries over the fitness of Chaminda Vaas took another turn Thursday with manager Michael Tissera and even physiotherapist C. J. Clarke indicating before a practice match Thursday that Vaas would not be in the squad for the tri-series opener versus India. 

However, Vaas, adds another report, was stubborn in insisting he would be available for the opener. 

Tissera said the inclusion of Vaas looks unlikely as he was still struggling with a hamstring strain he sustained in the second Test against the West Indies in Kandy recently. 

Vaas is a key personnel in the Sri Lankan bowling attack and his absence will be a great blow to the hosts. 

He showed he had lost nothing of his guile and clever change of pace as he made the West Indians hop and struggle against his variety. His stock wicket-taking ball is the one which he brings in without discernible change in the pace. 

If Vaas pulls out, Indians will have to contend with Nuwan Zoysa, another left-armer who is as stingy as they come, or speedster Dilhara Fernando, who also has a slight thigh strain but is expected to be fit. 

Zoysa gets good back up from the likes of Lasith Malinga and Fervez Mahroof, not to mention Dilhara Fernando who looks leaner and fitter in his return to the Sri Lankan team.Chaminda is having treatment and progressing but he is not going to play in the first game, Clarke said. 

Fernando, who took nine wickets in five games in a recent A team series against West Indies, has just returned to the squad after a year recovering from a stress fracture of the back and poor form. 

Clarke is hopeful Vaas will play at some stage during the series. (Agencies)

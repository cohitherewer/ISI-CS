 Rafaga has edge in 1000

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Eight fillies will face the starter for the 1600m Karnataka Racehorse Owners Association Mysore 1000 Guineas here on Friday. The four horses, most likely to be involved where it matters, are Bratz, Caprese, Scintilating Skill and Rafaga. However, Bratz appears to be suspect over the trip, while Scintilating Skills trip to Hyderabad might have taken its toll. Caprese,on the other hand, is in good form. But Padmanabhans unbeaten filly, Rafaga, seems to have edge over the three. Y. Srinath partners the Placerville-Razalin daughter.

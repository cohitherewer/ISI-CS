 Boards gag-act

Mumbai: Alarmed at the airing of views in the media by Harbhajan Singh, the BCCI has asked all the players contracted to it as well as those who were on the recent tour to Zimbabwe to keep mum. The Board cautioned them any behaviour to the contrary would amount to breach of contract. 

A media release issued by secretary S K Nair from Thirvananthapuram said that the Board has appealed to all cricketers under its contract as well as those who were selected for the tour of Zimbabwe and the support staff of the team to exercise restraint. 

Your kind attention is invited to the relevant provision of the letter of selection that was issued to you prior to the tour to Zimbabwe in August 2005, or the contract entered between you and the Board. You are aware that the Board has constituted a committee to review the performance of the Indian team and the role of all concerned. The committee is scheduled to meet on September 27, 2005 in Mumbai.

London: Chelseas season suffered its first serious blemish on Wednesday when London rivals Charlton Athletic knocked them out of the League Cup 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. 

Skipper John Terry headed the holders in front after 41 minutes only for Darren Bent to equalise before the break with his ninth goal of the season. 

Jose Mourinhos runaway Premier League leaders could find no way through during extra time and Charlton, who are second in the league, punished them with five perfect penalties to reach the fourth round. Goalkeeper Stephan Andersen was the hero for Charlton, saving defender Robert Huths penalty. 

A virtual Manchester United reserve side eased past fourth division Barnet 4-1 to join Charlton in the next round, while there were also wins for Newcastle United, Middlesbrough, Birmingham City and Bolton Wanderers. 

Meanwhile, an out-of-sorts Real Madrid missed their chance to claim the leadership of the Primera Liga when they slumped to a 1-3 defeat at Deportivo Coruna on Wednesday. 

The Galicians preserved their 14-year unbeaten home record against Real in the league thanks to a superb strike from Canadian midfielder Julian de Guzman and a fine double from central defender Juanma. 

With Real suffering their second defeat in a row, Osasuna were at top of the standings after snatching a 3-2 win at home to Athletic Bilbao. Barcelona moved to within two points of the leaders after a Ronaldinho penalty and a classy finish from substitute Henrik Larsson earned them a 2-0 win at home. Real are now in fifth spot.

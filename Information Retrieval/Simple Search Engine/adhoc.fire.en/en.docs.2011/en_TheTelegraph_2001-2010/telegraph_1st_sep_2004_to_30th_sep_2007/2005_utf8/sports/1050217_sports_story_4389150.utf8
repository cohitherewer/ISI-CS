 Churchill ride Yakubu double 

Margao: Yusif Yakubu?s brace guided Churchill Brothers to their first win when they came from behind to beat Vasco SC 2-1 in their Round VIII NFL match on Wednesday. 

Brazilian Sydney Rodrigues gave Vasco the lead in the ninth minute off a penalty after Osumanu Husseini bought down Aseem inside the box. Churchill retaliated and equalised through Yakubu, also off a penalty in the 24th minute. Sushant Mathew tripped Marcos Parreira inside the box and Yakubu made no mistake from the spot-kick. 

In the 34th minute Churchill ?keeper Marc Mascarenhas fouled Anthony Pereira and duly received the marching orders. Man of the Match Yakubu completed the Churchill win , slotting home following a Marcos through. (PTI)

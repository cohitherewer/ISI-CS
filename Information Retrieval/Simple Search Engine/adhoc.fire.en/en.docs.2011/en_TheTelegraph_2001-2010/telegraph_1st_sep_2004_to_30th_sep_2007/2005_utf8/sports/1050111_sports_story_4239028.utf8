The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Warne available 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Melbourne: Shane Warne didn?t intend to come out of one-day retirement on home turf, Monday, but circumstances ensured that. Now, he is also available for the second tsunami fund-raiser. 

After that, though, it will again be back to Test cricket only. 

However, The Telegraph learns Warne could be persuaded to have a ?serious re-think? about not playing ODIs. 

Incidentally, his theatrics at the MCG should fetch $10,000 for one of the tsunami funds from comedian Andrew Denton.

 Durrani sees no place for Sourav

 Salim Durrani 

Jaipur: It is next to impossible for Sourav Ganguly to sneak into Team India which is on a cruise mode in the ongoing series against Sri Lanka, feels Salim Durrani. 

The dashing allrounder of yesteryears believes even a Don Bradman would have not been included in a side which has been winning, let alone Sourav. 

It is criminal to tamper with a winning combination. The selectors have done the right thing by retaining the same squad that has done almost nothing wrong in the series so far, Durrani said on Saturday. 

I am a great fan of Sourav, let there be no doubt about this. But where and how will the selectors pick him? Even Don Bradman would not have been included in this kind of scenario when the team is winning, Durrani said. 

Durrani, however, did not write off Souravs chances of making a comeback. He has played well for the country, and if this same team goes into a slump, he can force his way back. 

The 69-year-old said Sachin Tendulkars return from an injury-enforced break could not have been more spectacular. 

He is a natural talent. Only a cricketer of his calibre can come back and play the way he has in the two matches, he said. 

Meanwhile, security arrangements have been tightened in and around the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in view of the third ODI to be played here on Monday. 

For the first time, mega video screens are being installed at the west and east end of the stadium near the scoreboard for added visibility.

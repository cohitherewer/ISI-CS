The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Weve probably played the underdogs role a bit too much

 - New Zealand vice-captain Daniel Vettori speaks on leadership and more 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Sydney: New Zealands youngest Test and ODI cricketer, Daniel Vettori, has graduated to becoming vice-captain. A member of the World XI in the ongoing Super Series, the 26-year-old left-arm spinner spoke to The Telegraph at the Four Seasons Hotel the other evening. 

The following are excerpts: 

On being groomed for the captaincy 

Am not too sure whether Im being groomed for the captaincy... The grooming is to be a leader... In time to come, perhaps, to fill the vacuum when Stephen (Fleming) leaves... Usually, captains last a couple of years, but he has been there for much longer... Stephen has himself taken a couple of us under his wings. 

On Fleming taking on the mentors role 

Stephen talks about situations and ideas are exchanged... He tells us how he reacted to certain situations and encourages us to ask questions. The leadership group is central to the teams performance... It could comprise three-four players, or even include the whole team. 

On having successfully captained New Zealand in all three ODIs versus Bangladesh, almost a year ago 

It was nice to get a feel of actual situations... I was nervous to begin with ? after all, nobody wants to lose to Bangladesh... Once the first ODI was over, I found it easier and looked at my own game as well. 

On whether he learnt anything from that short stint 

That its important to have your own game in order and not only keep worrying about others ... Concern about teammates can take a lot out of a captain. 

On the captaincy lessons learnt from Fleming 

That it pays to be calm, to remain unemotional... Stephen is remarkable because the shifts in momentum dont affect him... Indeed, a captain cant be up and down all the time ? rather, he has to be cool. Ive also learnt that the leadership must be strong. 

On leadership 

Well, its easier to lead if youre yourself a performer... If you lead by performance, then the others follow. A leader has to have character and relating to individuals off the field is an important part of the brief. 

On whether underbowling/overbowling himself could be a worry when he does get the New Zealand captaincy 

(Laughs) Wont be overbowling as I wouldnt want to be selfish! Actually, a captain needs a strong group of leaders around him to help make tough decisions. 

On having made a career out of spin bowling in a country where theres nothing on offer for the slower bowlers 

I began as a mediumpacer in school, but injuries made me try my hand at left-arm spin. I didnt have a role model, but it came rather easy... A career in spin bowling isnt a well-trodden path in New Zealand, but Im happy. 

On whether he looked up to any spinner outside New Zealand 

Shane Warne, in the early Nineties... I continue to study the way he dominates a game and the manner in which he changes its direction. Its terrific seeing a spinner being the focal point of a face-off. 

On interacting with Warne 

He spent some time with me during my very first series against Australia... He spoke about the art of spin bowling, the rights and wrongs... It was a warm gesture towards a youngster... (After a pause) Shane, in fact, is to be thanked for reviving the art of spin bowling. Till he came along, cricket was overrun by quicks. 

On the role of spinners in ODIs 

Potentially, the role is big, but Im not comfortable with the experimental power play rule as it covers 20 overs. It wont encourage the development of spin bowling. 

On the batsman he respects most 

Rahul Dravid... Hes not the most destructive, but is so quick on his feet and judges the length beautifully. He attaches a heavy price to his wicket. 

On former off-spinner John Bracewell being the New Zealand coach 

(Laughs again) Ive been obliterating his name from the record books! John has infused fresh energy into the team and I find his presence helpful. Hes always willing to talk... Its because of him, perhaps, that my form has seen an upswing in the past 18 months or so. 

On spinners maturing with age 

I hope I havent reached the stage where Ive matured totally... 

On tours to the subcontinent 

Somehow, the majority of the wickets Ive played on have been flat. Then, the best players of spin are in that region. 

On his most satisfying performance 

The six wickets I got in the first innings of the Perth Test four years ago. If anything, the wicket in Perth helps quicks. 

On whether he has a target in his sights 

Im close to 2,000 Tests runs and am already past 200 wickets. Once the double is achieved, Ill be looking at 300 Test wickets and 3,000 runs. That wont be bad, is it? Statistics, I assume, suggest Im an allrounder. 

On New Zealand being the perennial underdogs 

Has helped us, yes, but also affected us in some ways. For example, we havent put the expectations on ourselves... Because were considered underdogs, weve probably played that role a bit too much. 

On New Zealands priority 

We definitely need a settled opening pair... 

Finally, on just how he celebrated his first call-up (soon after school), in 1996-97 

With a couple of beers in the company of my provincial coach. I was nervous, excited...

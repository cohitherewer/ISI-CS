The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Essential to keep competing when odds seem against you

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE- Greg Chappell on mental toughness 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: It has become fashionable to talk about mental toughness, but rarely does anybody dwell at length. Perhaps, doing so isnt easy. Well, new Team India coach Greg Chappell ? surely, he doesnt need an elaborate introduction ? spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about it over lunch at the Taj West End on Saturday. 

The following are excerpts 

 On mental toughness 

 Its not simple to define, but essentially 

 its the ability to keep competing when the odds seem 

 to be against you. It can be likened to the second 

 wind when running... Just when it appears youre 

 out of breath, you get the energy back in the next few steps. 

 Eventually, you run a lot further than you thought you could. 

 (After a pause) When you think theres no more 

 to give, you actually give more. The mentally tough manage 

 that. 

 On having been mentally tough 

 (Laughs) I became tough in our backyard, 

 during the make-believe Ashes Tests... While 

 battling it out with my elder brother, Ian... Of course, 

 he would always be Australia! I would be Australia only 

 when playing with younger brother Trevor... I learnt being 

 competitive very early in life. 

 On whether its possible to teach mental 

 toughness 

 Some toughness is inherent, while the rest 

 is influenced by the environment... Youve got to learn 

 in the first 100 hours of whatever youve chosen to 

 do. If you dont, you may never learn. ...I do accept 

 some, inherently, have more skills to be tough. At the same 

 time, nothing stops anybody from learning. In my book, making 

 mistakes is the best way to learn. I recall either not understanding 

 or choosing to ignore some of the things my father cautioned 

 me about. Later, through experience, I realised what the 

 old man meant. 

 On the environment factor 

 The more fun in the environment, the more 

 hands-on the environment, the more fruitful the learning... 

 Research (on mental toughness) has shown that even a challenging 

 environment produces the best results. A misnomer about 

 coaching, particularly, is that everything can be taught. 

 Fact is nothing gets done unless individuals have the desire 

 to learn. 

 On being convinced that playing for India has 

 to be motivation enough 

 Absolutely. If somebody needs to be motivated 

 beyond that, I dont think anybody will be able to 

 help. At least I certainly wont be able to. 

 On wanting to involve Dr Charles Krebs on the 

 support staff 

 It wouldnt be proper to comment till 

 Ive had a discussion with the BCCI... Dr Krebs may 

 not be a sports psychologist in the conventional sense, 

 but hes the best I know. 

 On the mental toughness level of the Indian 

 players 

 Oh, so many are tough... Look at Sachin 

 Tendulkar... Its difficult believing he has been playing 

 from the age of 16... He wouldnt be the champion he 

 is ? and has been throughout his career ? if he wasnt 

 mentally tough. 

 On how he handled the odd lows in his career 

 (Laughs again) As badly as anybody 

 else... Fortunately, my character and temperament is such 

 I couldnt sulk for too long. ... Perhaps, half-an-hour 

 at the most as sulking wasnt an enriching experience! 

 Moreover, when everybody has problems, who would want to 

 listen to your woes? I played in a real tough era where, 

 once you made it to the big league, you had to fend for 

 yourself... I dont recall anybody guiding me in the 

 Australian dressing room... Follow us, mate 

 is all that was said... Well, that initiation made me self-reliant... 

 One of the problems with todays cricket is that we 

 give too much to the players and, so, they expect too much. 

 Bottomline is theyve got to help themselves. 

 Finally, on the mentally toughest contemporary 

 Dennis Lillee, without a doubt... We were 

 teammates in the Australian dressing room, but not when 

 Sheffield Shield games were played... Dennis was in a different 

 league... If Ive got to name one from overseas, its 

 Andy Roberts. If looks could kill, he must have killed me 

 many times over... He made me feel so unwelcome. Mate, I 

 cant forget him.

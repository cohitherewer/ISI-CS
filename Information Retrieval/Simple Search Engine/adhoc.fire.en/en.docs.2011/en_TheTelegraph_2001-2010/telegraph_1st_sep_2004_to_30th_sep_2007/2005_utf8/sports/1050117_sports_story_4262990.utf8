The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Barua opens settlement window

A STAFF REPORTER

 Dibyendu Barua 

Calcutta: Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, president of the newly formed Chess Players? Association of India (CPAI) has sent in a reply to AICF secretary P.T. Ummer Koya?s notice for an answer to the issue of a press conference that Barua and WGM Nisha Mohota held on December 20 on pay cuts. 

The letter, Barua told The Telegraph Sunday, takes the issue off a confrontational path. ?Firstly, the AICF letter was sent to me, and not to me as the CPAI president. However, I made it clear that we don?t want posts in the national body. That isn?t our aim? 

The letter has three basic points. ?Firstly, I said that the press conference was not convened by me. It was called by the CPAI and I addressed the media as a representative of the CPAI. Hence all letter should be addressed to the respective office holder of the organisation. The AICF letter should have been addressed to P. Harikrishna, the secretary of the CPAI. 

?I have also pointed out that at the press meet other GMs like Abhijit Kunte, R.B. Ramesh, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda were also present. 

?And I have made it clear that while our organisation has been formed by the top players of the country, we are not interested in any confrontation with the AICF, nor are we on any path to form any parallel organisation. We are interested in only the interests of the players, that?s all,? said Barua. 

The CPAI was talking about the ten per cent pay cut that the AICF had imposed on tourney earnings from June 2004. That cut was lifted on December 31, mainly due to the players? objection. ?And while we thank the AICF for this withdrawal of the cut, we also want that part of the money, which we had lost (amounting to a total of Rs 3-5 lakh) back.? said Barua. 

Nisha Mohota has sent in a separate reply, detailing the technicalities of her position. She had incurred the AICF?s wrath for speaking out.

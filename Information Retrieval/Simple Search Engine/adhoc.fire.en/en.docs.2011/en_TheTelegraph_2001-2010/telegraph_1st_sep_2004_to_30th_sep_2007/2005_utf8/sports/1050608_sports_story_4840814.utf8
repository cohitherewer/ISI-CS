 Nadal aims to oust Federer

 Nadal 

Berlin: French Open champion Rafael Nadal believes he can dislodge Roger Federer from the world No. 1 spot. 

Nadal, 19, beat the Swiss in four sets in the semi-finals at Roland Garros last week and the two players could meet at the same stage of the $800,000 pre-Wimbledon grasscourt meet in Halle this week. 

The Spaniard moved up to third in the world rankings following his Roland Garros win on Sunday. 

Hes one of the best players in history, but I know that the state of No. 1 is really possible for me now, Nadal said on Tuesday in Halle. 

Nadal said it was a big challenge switching from clay to grass but that he enjoyed playing on the surface and was looking forward to Wimbledon which starts on June 20. 

Wimbledon champion Federer is aiming for a third straight win at the All England Club. 

For me grass is a good surface, its not my best, but I want to improve, Nadal told reporters.

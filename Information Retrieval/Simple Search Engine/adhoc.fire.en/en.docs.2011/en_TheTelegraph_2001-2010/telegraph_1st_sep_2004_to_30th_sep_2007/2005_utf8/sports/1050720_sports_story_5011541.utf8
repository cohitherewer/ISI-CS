Bangalore: Coach Greg Chappell on Tuesday said India were geared up to play in the triangular series in Sri Lanka from July 30 after the conditioning camp concluded here. 

The 56-year-old former Australian captain said he was happy with the selection of the Indian squad, which he described as a good one, adding, the probables had worked hard in the camp as well as in the preceding conclave that focused on fitness. 

The selectors have done a very good job, he said. 

We are ready to go and play some cricket now, Greg said after the probables participated in a practice match at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, marking the conclusion of the camp. We have got a squad which is fully fit; thats always a good thing, he said, adding, Ashish Nehra was the last man to be declared fully fit. All in all, we are in a fortunate position. 

To another question, Chappell said the fact that the coaches of India, Sri Lanka (Tom Moody) and the West Indies (Bennett King), the three teams featuring in the tri-series, were all Australians is something coincidental. 

 When asked if India would go into matches with four or five specialist bowlers, Rahul Dravid, captain for the tri-series, said: The kind of squad we have gives us flexibility to be able to play different kinds of combinations. 

Meanwhile, Suresh Raina celebrated his national call-up with a 92 as India A reached 293 in their 50 overs in the practice tie. But that was not enough as Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck a 89-ball unbeaten 123 (12x4, 3x6) and Jai Prakash Yadav made 86 not out to help India Senior to a five-wicket win. 

In Ghaziabad, people celebrated Sureshs call-up. God has blessed our son, said father T. C. Raina as a crowd gathered at his house in Muradnagar.

 China to meet Indonesia in final

Beijing: Badminton powerhouse China are the strong favourites to lift the prestigious Sudirman Cup for the fifth time on Sunday when they meet Indonesia in the final of the World Mixed team championships. 

The host nation booked their spot in the final with a convincing 3-0 win over South Korea at Beijings Capital Gymnasium following Indonesias 3-0 sweep of Denmark in the other semi-final. 

It was sweet revenge for China after their loss to the Koreans in the 2003 Sudirman Cup final in Eindhoven. 

Indonesia won the inaugural edition of the biennial tournament in 1989, but China took home the trophy in 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001. Few would bet against them adding 2005 to the list given the way they have played so far this week. 

Zhang Jun and Gao Ling, mixed doubles gold medallists at the Athens Olympics, opened Chinas account with a 15-11, 11-15, 15-8 win over Lee Jae-Jin and Lee Hyo-Jung. 

Lin Dan then registered a 15-9, 15-11 win over Jang Young-Soo. Zhang Ning cemented Chinas place in the final with an 11-2, 11-1 demolition of Lee Yun-Hwa to spark the celebrations. 

Earlier, Indonesia got off to the perfect start in the mixed doubles with Nova Widianto and Lilyana Natsir handing down a 15-4, 15-7 thrashing of Jens Eriksen and Kamilla Juhl. Taufik Hidayat then outfought Peter Gade 15-10, 15-3. 

Camilla Sorenson tried to spark a Danish rally, taking her first game against Fransisca Hari 11-3. But Hari was able to turn things around with a 2-1 victory.

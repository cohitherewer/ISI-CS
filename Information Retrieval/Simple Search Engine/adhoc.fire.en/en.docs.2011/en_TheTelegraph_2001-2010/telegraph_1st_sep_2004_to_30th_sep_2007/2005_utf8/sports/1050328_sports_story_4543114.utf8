 Chisty could have done better 

 STAR RACER

Had slipped saddles not failed Daniel David?s Exotic Strides and Primaticcio, there was a chance that the champion trainer and his jockey Imran Chisty could have walked away with more than two winners last Tuesday. Rasalas and La Fantasie had helped them lift the important races in the seven-event card ? the 1,600m Grand Annual Handicap and the 1,200m Madras Race Club Cup. However, what left most wondering as to how the trainer could be so callous on his chance horses, and also that how could stewards pass it off with a paltry fine of Rs 500 in each case of slipped saddle.

 Rasalas? victory was a welcome return to form. The Strom Trooper-Ruddles son had disappointed after his promising debut run. However, the three-year-old is still maturing. Otherwise, he would not have shifted out badly on course of his narrow victory. La Fantasie?s, on the other hand, was a clean win, and from the start. 

 Chisty also falte-red on Daniel?s another favourite Steinlen, in the Eastern Command Cup, by allowing a tidy lead to the winner, Sea Legend, even after the field passed the half-way mark of the 1,400m trip. Stienlen was, therefore, left to do much in the stretch run. Lacking an initial speed, the joint-favourite Alarico was equally at disadvantage. The Bharath Singh-trainee did cover some ground from the rear in the final stretch but Md Islam kept the winner, an Errol Bhungard-ward, going for half-a-length victory while a long neck separated the joint-favourites.

 Heavy wagering on Eglevsky pushed the odds of Vijay?s favourite, Maricopa, up in the 1,400m Lt. Gen. Jameel Mahmood Memorial Trophy. The latter, however, turned out to be a non-starter after she injured herself at the start. The withdrawal of the favourite did not make the task of Farley Rodrigues? ward easier. It was a virtual last-stride victory for him after Bharath Singh?s Azinger decided to take a commanding three-length lead 300m from home.

 Slipped saddle apart, Exotic Strides was also knocked out of his stride soon after the start to lose a favourable position in the 1,100m Avaglow Handicap. It made the favourite Terrific Dancer?s task that much easier and the Javed Khan-trainee led within a 100m of the start to win unchallenged. Earlier, the trainer had saddled Gul to victory against an opposition which had been letting down quite often.

 Legendry Lover has been growing young ever since the nine-year-old gelding changed stables ? from Daniel?s to T.N. Jaiswal?s. True, he was enjoying a 9-kg pull at the weights but he simply outclassed Primaticcio in the 1,600m Fey Legend Handicap. It may not have made a difference had Primaticcio?s saddle not slipped.

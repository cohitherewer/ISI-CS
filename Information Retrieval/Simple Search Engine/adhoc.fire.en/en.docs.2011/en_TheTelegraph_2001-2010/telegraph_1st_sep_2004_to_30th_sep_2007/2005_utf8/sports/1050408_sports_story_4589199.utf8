 Anuja bags crown

 Anuja Thakur 

New Delhi: National champion Anuja Thakur added yet another feather to her cap when she clinched the WLBSA Ladies World Billiards championship crown at the Cambridge Snooker Centre in England. 

The 22-year-old Anuja defeated Lynette Horsburgh of Scotland 243-136 in the summit clash to clinch the title and pocket a prize money of ?300 along with 15 ranking points, according to information received here. 

Anuja, who has won the last three national championships, had defeated Emma Bonney of Portsmouth in the semi-finals. 

The other two Indians in the fray ? Anuja?s sister Meenal and Chitra Magimairaj ? bowed out in the quarter finals. 

While Meenal went down to Bonney, Chitra lost to Anuja in the last eight stage. 

The competition is organised by the England Amateur Billiards Association annually but it could not be held last year due to lack of sponsorship.

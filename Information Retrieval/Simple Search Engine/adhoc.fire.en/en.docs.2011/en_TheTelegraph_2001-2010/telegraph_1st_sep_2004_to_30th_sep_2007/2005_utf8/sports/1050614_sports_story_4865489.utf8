 Indian squad leaves

Hyderabad: After a strenous 45-day camp here at the floodlit Gachibowli Stadium, the Indian hockey team Monday expressed confidence of defending their title in the Junior World Cup hockey championship beginning in Rotterdam on June 29. 

We are confident of retaining the title. We have senior players in our side who played for the national team as well, skipper Adrian DSouza said in an informal chat with reporters before flying off. 

En route to Rotterdam, the team will touch down in Spain where they will play four practice matches before going into the World Cup.

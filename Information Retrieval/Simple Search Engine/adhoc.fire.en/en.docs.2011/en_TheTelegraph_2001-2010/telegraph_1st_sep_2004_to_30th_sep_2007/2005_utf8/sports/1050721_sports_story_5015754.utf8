Calcutta: Former Team India physio Andrew Leipus is keen on improving the general fitness of youngsters who aspire to don the India cap in future. 

The current National Cricket Academy (NCA) consultant had an one-hour discussion with former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Wednesday. 

It was learnt that he placed his proposal for conducting a Level I physioth- erapists course to educate the local physios. 

Nothing has been finalised yet, but I am planning to help the Indian physios who can ultimately make the domestic players fit enough to compete in the top level, Leipus told The Telegraph shortly before leaving the city on Wednesday. 

Leipus, who had a successful stint with Team India, has no plans of get- ting associated with the team again in future. 

I want to complete the Masters in the Mascular Skeleton and Sports Physiotherapy degree from the University of South Australia, and then come to India, the physio stated. 

On his Calcutta visit, the Adelaide-based physio refused to divulge anything more. I have come here with an intention to carry on with the good work left over by me, he said. 

Leipus will be free by January 2006, after which he wants to share his expertise with the local physios to raise the fitness standard in the domestic level. 

Leipus is yet to receive any offer after quitting his Team India job. 

I dont want to get engaged in anything apart from completing my degree, otherwise I wouldnt have left the best job in the world, he remarked. 

According to him, the current physio John Gloster and trainer Gregory King are doing a fine job and success is bound to come if the teamwork remains good. 

BCCI has been very cooperative during my tenure and there is no reason that they wont cooperate with the new support staff, he rounded off.

Bangalore: Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik, who has played eight Tests, is nursing an ambition to become a regular one-day member of Team India as well. 

Well, the other stumper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, with nine ODIs under his belt, is dreaming the other way round. 

Will they realise their goal ? 

Everybody wants to play at every level? I want to play the one-dayers, says Karthik, the 20-year-old from Tamil Nadu who had also featured in two limited-overs matches. 

But with Dhoni bursting on to the one-day scene, Karthik veered into the background. 

A scintillating 123-ball 148 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam marked the arrival of the 23-year-old exciting strokeplayer from Jharkhand. 

Its just that I need to keep performing well in one-dayers, both behind the wickets and score runs, to get into the Test squad, says Dhoni. 

Karthik recently returned from the Brisbane-based Australian Cricket Academy, where he underwent a three-week training stint. 

I am working on areas in wicket-keeping and batting to get to that level (one-day), Karthik said. He also worked on how to get down the leg side during wicket-keeping, while keeping oneself low. 

Karthik said he was aiming to score heavily in domestic matches to catch the attention of selectors to become a regular in Indias one-day squad. 

With big dreams in their eyes, Karthik and Dhoni are now attending the ongoing training camp for probables. 

The conditioning camp is in full swing. The focus is mainly on increasing the physical fitness level of the players and minimising the chances of injury. 

Supervised by new Team India coach Greg Chappell, trainer Gregory King and physio John Gloster, the camp is aimed at preparing the cricketers for the rigours of international cricket ahead of a hectic season. 

This camp runs till July 12, a day after which the final phase of the camp focusing on cricketing skills gets underway.

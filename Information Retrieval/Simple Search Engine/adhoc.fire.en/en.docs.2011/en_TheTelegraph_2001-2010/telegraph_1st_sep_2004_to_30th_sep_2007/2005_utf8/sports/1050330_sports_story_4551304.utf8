 Faltering France in tricky Israel trip

London: Faltering France visit buoyant Israel on Wednesday in a World Cup qualifier that could have enormous ramifications for the two nations at opposite ends of the European pecking order. 

The eagerly-awaited Tel Aviv clash is one of 21 European qualifying games on Wednesday, with Serbia and Montenegro versus Spain, Slovakia versus Portugal and Greece versus Albania among the other highlights. 

France, the 1998 world and 2000 European champions, have looked in a sorry state during their group IV campaign, which began with an inauspicious goalless home draw with the Israelis last September. 

Two more goalless Paris draws against Ireland and Switzerland and 2-0 away wins over the Faroe Islands and Cyprus have left France on nine points from five games, along with Israel and Ireland. Switzerland are also still in the hunt on six with a game in hand and will expect to beat Cyprus in Zurich on Wednesday. 

France have yet to concede a goal but, having scored just four, it is hardly a record to be proud of for a team blessed with such talented players. 

With difficult away matches in Ireland and Switzerland still to come, the team sitting behind only Brazil in the Fifa world rankings are by no means guaranteed a place in the 2006 finals. 

France dominated against the Swiss on Saturday but were let down by woeful finishing, particularly by David Trezeguet, who missed a sitter late on. 

France coach Raymond Domenech is not panicking yet but with the group so tight, Trezeguet says there is no room for error. ?Even with so many games remaining, the first top team to lose is dead,? he said. 

European champions Greece were brought down to earth with a thump after their success in Portugal last year when they lost their first World Cup qualifier in Albania. 

They have the chance for revenge against their neighbours and old foes in Athens, where they will hope to make it four wins in a row in group II. 

Greece are second on 11 points, three behind Ukraine, who host Denmark (nine). 

The top two meet in group III as Slovakia and Portugal, both on 13 points from five games, clash in Bratislava. Elsewhere, most of the favourites will expect to bang in the goals against lesser lights. 

Group VI leaders England, 4-0 winners over Northern Ireland on Saturday, host an Azerbaijan side thumped 0-8 by Poland, with the Poles taking their turn against Northern Ireland. 

There are four games in the South American qualifying competition on Wednesday, including leaders Argentina at home to Colombia and second-placed Brazil crossing the border to Uruguay. 

Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, meanwhile, reiterated his support for Ronaldo on Monday and said he had not considered dropping the out-of-form striker. 

?Other teams don?t have anyone like Ronaldo and are green with envy of Brazil,? Parreira told Brazilian media in Montevideo. ?We have him, yet we?ve been putting him down for some time.? 

Ronaldo has hit a bad patch with Real Madrid in the last two months and is reported to have clashed with coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo. (Reuters)

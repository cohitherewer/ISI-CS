The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Atapattu likely to stay captain

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: Despite Sri Lankas poor showing in both the one-dayers and Test series here, Maravan Atapattu is likely to be retained captain for their tour of New Zealand and Australia. 

We return home and then leave for New Zealand on the 27th and there is very little time in between. Moreover, options are also very limited. So Atapattu should stay captain, a source told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

This is a young team and we are going through a transition phase. So constant chopping and changing wont help. You need to instil confidence among the players, he added. 

The selection committee, headed by Lalit Kaluperuma and consisting Don Anurasiri, S. Asghar Ally and K.M. Nelson, will meet within a couple of days to pick the squad for the twin tours. The one-dayers in New Zealand will be followed by the tri-series in Australia. South Africa will be the third team. 

It is also learnt that Sanath Jayasuriya is set to be included in the squad. He has recovered fully from the shoulder injury. He is playing domestic cricket regularly and is scoring runs, the source said. 

There may be a couple of fresh faces included. The selectors have realised that success wont be achieved in a hurry and are regularly being updated by coach Tom Moody.

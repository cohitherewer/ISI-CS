The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav set to be let off with heavy fine

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Despite the Indians being three overs short (after all the allowances), Match Referee Chris Broad is likely to let Sourav Ganguly off with a heavy fine and an informal warning. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, Broad indicated as much during the hearing ? for a Level 2 breach ? conducted at his hotel, a couple of hours after the third ODI here. 

The Indians were actually five overs short, but Broad made an allowance for two on account of nine dismissals and the many unofficial drinks breaks. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, has been held guilty for a slow over-rate more than once. In fact, his ?face-off? with Clive Lloyd last November is now part of folklore.

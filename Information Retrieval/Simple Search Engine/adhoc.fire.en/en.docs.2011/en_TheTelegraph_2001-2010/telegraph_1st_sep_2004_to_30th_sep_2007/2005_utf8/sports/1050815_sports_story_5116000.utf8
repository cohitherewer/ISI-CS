Manchester: Simon Jones completed a six-wicket haul and Andrew Strauss cudgelled a century as England pressed for victory in the third Test against Australia on Sunday. 

The world champions, set what would be a world-record 423 to win, survived a tricky 10 overs to end the fourth day on 24 without loss at Old Trafford. 

Michael Vaughan was forced to turn to left-arm spinner Ashley Giles and bowl his own occasional off spin as the light began to fail in the final overs. 

England, looking to go 2-1 up in the five-match series after winning last week at Edgbaston, had begun the day by wrapping up Austalias first innings for 302 to secure a lead of 142. 

They then rattled up 280 for six in their second visit, scoring at almost five runs an over, with Strauss (106) and Ian Bell (65) putting on 127 for the third wicket, before the declaration. 

Glenn McGrath took five wickets but was lashed for 115 runs off 20.5 overs. Australia, meanwhile, were heckled for much of the final session as they resorted to go-slow tactics to dampen the scoring. 

England ? or rather Jones ? took just over an hour to wrap up Australias first innings in the morning. The Welsh fast bowler ended it with Test-best figures of six for 53. 

The touring side, chasing Englands first innings of 444, had resumed on 264 for seven, with Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie firmly entrenched. 

The pair extended their partnership to 86 before Jones got to work. His last three wickets came in the space of 29 balls at the cost of one scoring shot ? an unlikely six from Gillespie. 

Warne got to 90, having hit a six and 11 fours during a three-hour stay, before he pulled Jones straight to deep square leg. 

The next highest contribution on the Australian scorecard came from extras (38), followed by Matthew Haydens 34. 

Jones made it two wickets without conceding a run in 16 balls as Brett Lee thrust forward and edged to first slip, Trescothick taking a sharp catch moving to his right. 

Gillespie, after almost two hours of studied defence, picked up Jones off a length and hoisted him for six over square leg but was trapped lbw soon after. He made 26. 

England, batting again and short of time after most of the third day was lost to rain, went for their shots from the off. 

Trescothick found the middle of the bat on his way past 5,000 Test runs, while Strauss, less certain, found the edge. 

One of them, off Lee, flew between Warne and Ricky Ponting at first and second slip, leaving the pair staring at each other. Strauss also took a blow to the helmet from Lee just as he had done in the first innings, this time needing treatment for a cut ear. 

But it was Trescothick who lost his wicket and was soon followed by Michael Vaughan.

 Shiv, Digvijay finish tied 3rd

Beijing: Indians Shiv Kapur and Digvijay Singh tied for third place at the $200,000 Crowne Plaza Open after a creditable performance in the final round of the Asian Tour event. 

A three-under on the back nine by Shiv (69) fell just short of the pace. He tied with Digvijay (70) who had at least a share of the lead on the first three days. 

The Indians tied for third place with Australian Alistair Presnell who racked up a five-under 31 to jump up to 281. 

Coming to the 18th tee, after Thailands Prayad Marksaeng and Marcus Both had finished at eight-under. 

Both had birdied 18th and was one of only three players to do so on the tough par-four closing hole. 

But Shiv and Digvijay could managed only pars and ended one shot of the winning score. Shivwill keep his Asian Tour card for 2006. (PTI)

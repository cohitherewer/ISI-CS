 Hick?s 127th takes him to No. 10

 Hick 

London: Former England batsman Graeme Hick scored his 127th first-class hundred to move above W.G. Grace into 10th place on the all-time list of century makers. 

The Zimbabwe-born right-hander hit 176 off 231 balls on Thursday as his side Worcestershire made 306 in the first innings of their County championship match against Lancashire at New Road. 

Hick, who smashed eight sixes and 20 fours to register his 97th ton for Worcestershire, insisted value to the team was far more important to him than individual records. 

?Records are not something I?m really concerned about,? said Hick. 

?All I?m concerned about is doing my job properly for Worcestershire. But scoring centuries still gives me great pleasure, may be even more so at this stage of my career because I don?t know how many more I?ve got in me.? 

Hick, who will turn 39 next month, is one century behind his former England captain Graham Gooch and two behind Len Hutton. 

Englishman Jack Hobbs is the all-time leader with 197 centuries.

 Winning start for Mahesh-Martin

 Bhupathi and Damm beat Germans 

Stuttgart: Mahesh Bhupathi won his first match with new partner Martin Damm at the Mercedes Cup here on Thursday. The top-seeded Indo-Czech pair saw off German wild cards Florian Mayer and Lars Burgsmuller 1-6, 6-1, 7-6 (10-8) to enter the second round of the euro 614,750 meet. 

Bhupathi and Damm will next face another local pair Andreas Beck and Sebastian Rieschick, who defeated Czechs Tomas Berdych and Jaroslav Levinsky 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4). 

In singles action, Rafael Nadal continued his untroubled progress beating Tomas Zib 6-2, 6-1 to reach the semi-finals without breaking any sweat. The French Open champion will face unseeded Finn Jarkko Nieminen, who beat Andreas Seppi of Italy 6-2, 6-3. 

The Spaniards 32nd successive win on claycourts took just 70 minutes. Only Bjorn Borg, Thomas Muster, Guillermo Coria and Mats Wilander have had such a streak. Austrian Muster holds the record with 40 straight victories. 

Nadal has been untouchable on the Stuttgart clay this week and the result looked a foregone conclusion from the very first game, when Zib, the unseeded Czech, missed a simple volley to hand his opponent three break-points. 

Nadal took the first of them with a belting forehand and broke again for a 4-1 lead on way to clinching the set in 38 minutes. The 19-year-old grabbed his first break in the second set in game three, going down on one knee to whip a backhand winner across court on break-point.

 Sourav not averse to playing county

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is not averse to playing county cricket again. At this point, though, there has been no firm offer regarding that. 

?If an offer comes by I will certainly give it a thought,? Sourav observed here Thursday evening. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, played a season for Lancashire in the summer of 2000.

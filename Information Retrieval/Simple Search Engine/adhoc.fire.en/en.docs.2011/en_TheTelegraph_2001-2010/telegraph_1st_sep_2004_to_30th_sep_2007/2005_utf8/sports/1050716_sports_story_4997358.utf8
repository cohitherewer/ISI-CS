 IN THE CITY

 East Bengal on Friday slapped a showcause notice on I.M. Vijayan, asking him to explain his absence from practice. Coach Subhas Bhowmick is learnt to have taken strong exception to Vijayan?s decision to not inform the club about his arrival. 

 Bhowmick was also peeved at Alvito D?Cunha?s late arrival in the pre-season campaign and only a permission from the club officials allowed the Goan to take to practice under the British physical trainer Peter McKnight. 

 Meanwhile, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting players reached Port Blair and had light practice. The two teams will play a tsunami fund-raiser there. 

 In another development, six East Bengal players will leave for the national camp in Bangalore on Saturday.

 St Thomas defeated Chetla Boys 61-37 in an inter-school basketball meet at WBBA court on Friday. In another match, St Mary?s accounted for M.C. Kejriwal 38-16. 

 College Square Swimming Club emerged champions in the all-Bengal waterpolo meet on Friday. They beat Taldi Swimming Club 2-0 in the final.

 McGrath checks NZ charge 

 - FIRST TEST 

 McGrath in Christchurch on Friday 

Christchurch: Glenn McGrath grabbed six quick wickets as Australia fought back to leave the first Test with New Zealand evenly poised after the second day in Christchurch on Friday. 

The lanky paceman mopped up the tail to finish with figures of six for 115 from 42 overs as the Black Caps were bowled out for 433 in their first innings. 

Australia, in reply, were 141 for three at stumps, trailing by 292 runs. Captain Ricky Ponting was unbeaten on 41 with nightwatchman Jason Gillespie yet to score. 

New Zealand resumed at 265 for three with Hamish Marshall on 103 and Nathan Astle 29 and seemed set for a score in excess of 500 before McGrath ran through the lower-order, taking six for 40 from his last 10 overs. 

Marshall and Astle took their fourth-wicket stand to 131 in the morning session before Shane Warne triggered the collapse by bowling Marshall around his pads for 146.

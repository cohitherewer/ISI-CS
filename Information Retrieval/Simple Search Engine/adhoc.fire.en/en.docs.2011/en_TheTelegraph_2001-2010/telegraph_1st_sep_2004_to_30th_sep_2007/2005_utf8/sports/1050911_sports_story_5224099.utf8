 Sania can break into top ten: Bhupathi

Mumbai: US Open mixed doubles champion Mahesh Bhupathi wants Sania Mirza to improve her serves and mobility, besides seeking to see her attack the net more even as he predicted that the Indian sensation will break into the top ten in the world. 

She (Sania) has surprised all of us. We all expected her to break into the top 100, but she has exceeded all the expectations. I expect her to peak in three years, Bhupathi said here on Saturday, on his return after clinching the US Open mixed doubles crown with Slovak partner Daniela Huntuchova. 

She has to stay healthy and she will surprise all of us even more. She has the ability to break into the top ten, Bhupathi said. 

Asked what she needed to improve on, Bhupathi said, her serves and mobility. I also would like to see her attack the net more. She has to work on her fitness too. 

About his triumph in the US Open mixed doubles with Daniela Hantuchova, Bhupathi said: We were down a match point in our first-round match and were lucky to come out of that (hole). Later on we played well though we had a tough draw. And towards the end we played quality tennis. 

Bhupathi came out in support of Harsh Mankad who has criticised his omission from the Davis Cup team which will take on to take on Sweden in the play-off tie in Delhi from September 23-25. 

 Mankad has been chosen as the reserve behind Leander Paes (captain), Bhupathi, Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna. I think Harsh has good reason to make a noise. He has had a good year and his ranking is also high.

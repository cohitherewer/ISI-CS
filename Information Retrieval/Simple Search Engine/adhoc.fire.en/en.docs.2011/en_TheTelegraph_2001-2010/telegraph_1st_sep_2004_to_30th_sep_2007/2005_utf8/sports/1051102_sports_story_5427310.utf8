 Rusedski desperate to be British No. 1

 - 32-yr-old within striking distance of toppling Henman 

 NEIL HARMAN 

 Rusedski has a one-point agenda 

In the ten and a half years in which he has worn the Union Jack with varying degrees of snugness, Greg Rusedski never used his naturalised colours as a means of camouflage. He has taken whatever has come his way ? praise or poison ? with an unflinching belief in what he is and what he stands for. 

Thus, as Rusedski is within striking distance of finishing the year as British No. 1 at 32, only the totally hard-hearted would not feel a pang of pleasure for him. At the dark end of 2003, he was No. 118 in the ATP rankings, knowing that he was about to confront a doping charge that could have finished him for good. 

Cleared of that stain, he hauled himself to No. 49 at the start of this year and is No. 38 at present ? six places and a handful of ranking points adrift of Tim Henman. 

A 6-3, 6-4 victory over Andreas Seppi, the Italian qualifier, in the first round of the Paris Masters on Monday left Rusedski knowing that should he defeat Nikolay Davydenko, the Russian No. 3 seed, he will leapfrog Henman into a position of domestic dominance he has not savoured since the autumn of 1999. 

He couldnt do that as he lost 2-6, 2-5 to the Russian on Tuesday. But that wont deter Rusedski from having a crack, even if that means competing in a lower level ebent. 

Comfortable association with fellow players on the Tour has been hard to come by for Rusedski, although his popularity would have increased eight-fold in case of a victory over Davydenko, arguably the least marketable commodity in the mix for a place in the Masters Cup in Shanghai later this month. 

Rusedski has one thing on his mind, to knock Henman from his perch, but for Guillermo Coria, Ivan Ljubicic, Fernando Gonzalez and few else besides, the kudos is potentially enormous. 

They all needed Davydenko to lose, and their chances of a lucrative ten days in China would have been enhanced straightaway. 

Theres much at stake for me, being British No. 1 at the end of the year, it would be a big deal. 

Such a big deal that Rusedski is prepared to go down a notch to Ukraine for a Challenger event next week to make sure he accumulates enough points to overhaul Henman. 

Who says it is not true that Rusedski grinds his teeth and sticks pins into an effigy of Henman every time the label of British No. 2 is attached to him? 

He tries not to make too much of the fact that Henmans innate Englishness and, now, the advent of Andy Murrays forthright Scottishness are in marked contrast to an accent that remains stubbornly trans-Atlantic. 

When he played ? and won ? the Newport grasscourt event the week after Wimbledon in July, he noted that of the seven British writers who made the trip, six departed once Murray was knocked out. 

But Tim and I have been waiting for this for a decade, Rusedski said. Now we finally see someone who is the real deal, whos proven himself already in Grand Slam tournaments, is consistently winning matches against very good players and is only going to get better. He has a great mindset and is so well suited for the way tennis is played nowadays. Thank God he has come around at this time for British tennis, his timing couldnt be better and there is always a story with him. 

There have been relatively few dull moments with Rusedski in the picture. It is hard to believe it is seven years since he won this prestigious title (Pete Sampras had never looked so upset to lose a match in his life), and three since he played here. 

Now, after such trial and torment, he is so overjoyed at the prospect of imminent fatherhood. Lucy, his wife, is here, looking absolutely in the pink. 

Considering this event is shorn of so many stars ? Gael Monfils, the 19-year-old Frenchman, was the latest to withdraw ? it was a testament to the sports lure that there were so few empty seats inside the Palais Omnisports. 

Normally, Stanislas Wawrinka, a Swiss lucky loser in Henmans spot, and Florent Serra, a French wild card, would not be front and centre in a Masters Series but their exploits were cheered to the echo.

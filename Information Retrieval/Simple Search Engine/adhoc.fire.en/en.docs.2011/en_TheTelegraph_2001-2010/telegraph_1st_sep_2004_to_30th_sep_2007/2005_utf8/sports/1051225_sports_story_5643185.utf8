 Sourav the right choice, says Pawar 

Mumbai/Calcutta: Throwing his weight behind Sourav Ganguly, BCCI chief Sharad Pawar said the former captain deserved a place in the squad and that reports questioning his conduct were not true. 

It looks like that he is definitely a proper person who should be included (in the squad), Pawar said minutes after the Test squad for the tour of Pakistan was named here. 

What was appearing in the papers that he was not co-operating and his relationship with his colleagues was not good, I myself went to his senior colleagues, there is not a single complaint against him. 

Meanwhile, former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya welcomed Souravs inclusion into the Test squad for the tour of Pakistan while stating that undue pressure should not be put on the left-hander. 

In the first place, Sourav should not have been dropped from the Ahmedabad Test despite playing reasonably well in Delhi. It is good that better sense has prevailed and selectors realised their mistake and have corrected it, Dalmiya said. He also said CAB was delighted that Sourav was back in the Indian team.

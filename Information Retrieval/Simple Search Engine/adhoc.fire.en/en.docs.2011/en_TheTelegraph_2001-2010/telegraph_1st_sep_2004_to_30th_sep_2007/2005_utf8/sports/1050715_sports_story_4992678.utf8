 No guarantees for Boje, Gibbs: BCCI

 - MATCH-FIXING ISSUE 

New Delhi: The BCCI Thursday made it clear that it was not in a position to provide guarantees to South African cricketers Nicky Boje and Herschelle Gibbs that they would not be interrogated over match-fixing allegations if they tour the country later this year. 

The BCCI also said that it had not received any official communication from the United Cricket Board of South African (UCBSA) board on this issue. 

We have not received any communication from the UCBSA in this connection. They are going through diplomatic channels and the BCCI cannot do much at this stage, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said over phone from Thiruvananthapuram. 

It is a matter that has to be dealt with by the home ministry and the police authorities, he said. 

Boje, who had skipped his teams tour of India last year, has said that he would travel to India only if he got an undertaking that he would not be prosecuted. 

 The spinners reaction came after reports that the UCBSA had asked the South African high commission in New Delhi to obtain assurance from the Indian police that Boje and Herschelle Gibbs would not be arrested or questioned about the match-fixing scandal. 

Boje and Gibbs are alleged to have been involved with the late Hansie Cronje in match-fixing with Indian book-makers during South Africas tour in 2000. 

UCBSA chief executive officer Gerald Majola said if they do not receive the undertaking, the players themselves would have to decide whether they want to travel to India in November for the five-match one-day International series.

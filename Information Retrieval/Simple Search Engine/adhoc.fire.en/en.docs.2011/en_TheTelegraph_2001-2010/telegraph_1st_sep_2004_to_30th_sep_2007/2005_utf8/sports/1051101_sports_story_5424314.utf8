 Substitutes not to be an issue, says Woolmer

Islamabad: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said on Monday the regular use of substitutes would not be an issue during the home series against England. 

Englands use of substitute fielders caused a row in the recent Ashes series, but Woolmer said the rules were plain and simple and he does not want the issue blown out of proportion. 

Australia captain Ricky Pointing described Englands repeated use of replacements as a disgrace and prompted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to say it would debate the law governing use of substitute fielders. 

Ponting was fined 75 percent of his match fees for his outburst after Englands three-wicket win in the third Ashes Test at Edgbaston where Ponting was run out attempting a sharp single by substitute Gary Pratt. 

He accused England coach Duncan Fletcher of manipulating the ICC regulations and violating the spirit of the game, but Woolmer disagreed. 

I disagree with him, said Woolmer. I think England were within their right to depute fielders, he said. I think it is natural that during a match, because of the heat and sweat, players want to come out for a change of shirts or for the call of nature. It is not a big issue with us.

 There?s no rift, says Sharapova

Melbourne: Maria Sharapova Saturday played down talk of a rift between her and Russia?s other tennis ?Tsarinas? ahead of next week?s Australian Open. The 17-year-old starlet stunned the tennis world last year when she won Wimbledon, one of a remarkable three Grand Slam crowns won by Russian players over the course of the season. 

But the year finished on a slightly sour note for Sharapova, with French Open champion Anastasia Myskina threatening to pull out of Russia?s Fed Cup team if the US-based teenager was drafted into the squad this year. 

?I don?t want to be on the same team with people who don?t show respect to me as a person,? said Myskina. ?If she joins our team next season, you won?t see me there.? 

US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova also had a dig, drawing attention to the fact that Sharapova has lived half her life in the United States since being whisked away to Florida at age seven. (AFP)

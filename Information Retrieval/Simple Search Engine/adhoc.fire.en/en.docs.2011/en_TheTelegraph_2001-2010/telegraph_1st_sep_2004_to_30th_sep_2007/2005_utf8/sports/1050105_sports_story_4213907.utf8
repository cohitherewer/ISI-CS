New sponsor for Sunday?s Derby 

STAR RACER 

Calcutta: The Calcutta Derby Stakes, billed 

for January 9, will be sponsored by the Eveready Industries, according to the 

Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) sources. The turf club was left to fend for the 

mega-event last winter after UB Group completed it?s contractual obligations. 

It had sponsored the Derby for three years between 2001 and 2003. ITC had sponsored 

the event for nearly a decade and half before UB Group had stepped in.

 Eveready will contribute Rs 6 lakh as an added money for the Sunday?s Derby. This year?s Derby winner?s purse could be expected to be about Rs 15 lakh.

 Atwal brings in a 4-under on Day II

 Arjun Atwal hit a four-birdie round 

Memphis: Arjun Atwal continued his fine run, as he rolled in a card of four-under 66 to move into tied 14th place and set himself up for a possible top-10 finish over the weekend in the Fedex St Jude Classic golf tournament Friday. 

Atwal, who had a modest opening round of one-over 71, cracked a bogey-free 66 with three birdies in first six holes and just one thereafter. His is now three-under 137 at the par-70 Tournament Players Course at Southwind. 

Justin Leonard shot a five-under 65 in second round and extended his lead to five strokes after the second round. 

Atwal made good use of the firm fairways and got an average of more than 300 yards off the tee. He had 25 putts as against 28 in the first round. Opening on the first, he birdied the first two holes for a great start. 

He added another on the sixth and turned in three-under, raising vision of going even lower. The birdies dried up but Atwal made no mistakes and no bogeys but added one more birdie on the 16th to finish at four-under.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Martina dying to play in India: Paes 

 - ?It can be as early as next month or at the end of the year? 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Martina Navratilova is special, says Leander Paes 

Chennai: It was a year-and-a-half ago that Leander Paes sounded out Martina Navratilova on playing some exhibition matches in India. She agreed straightaway. An end-of-the-season date ? sometime in December 2003 ? was tentatively set for the proposed set of matches in two or three cities. 

That didn?t materialise, not because the American legend changed her mind but simply for the fact that her favourite mixed doubles partner had still not recovered fully from the brain lesion which kept him out of the game for nearly six months. 

In fact, the phenomenal 47-year-old is still very keen on visiting this country. ?Martina is dying to come and play in India,? Paes told The Telegraph. ?She would have already played here had it not been for my illness. Now, we have to work out a fresh date.? 

Why not sometime in the near future as fund-raiser for the tsunami victims? ?I have thought about it but am not sure whether it will be feasible to organise it in February,? Paes said. 

?I?ll have a talk with Martina at the Australian Open and try to work out a suitable date. It can be as early as next month or at the end of the year,? Paes said. Sahara has promised support to the proposed programme, but some other sponsors also need to be roped in. 

?Arantxa (Sanchez-Vicario) is also willing to come to India. If I can get the two of them to play, it?ll be great for fans in India,? said Paes. 

It?s no secret that Paes shares a special camaraderie with Navratilova. Who can forget the American?s gesture of skipping the 2003 US Open mixed doubles as her favourite partner was in an Orlando hospital at that time? 

?She is a special lady, I have learnt so much from her,? said Paes, oozing admiration and respect for the grand old lady of tennis. Their combined skills have fetched them two Grand Slam titles (Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2003). 

There could be more, as the two set out to regain the Australian Open crown next fortnight. Just to jog memories, Paes and Navratilova lost in the final last year. 

Navratilova had announced that 2004 would be her last year in competitive tennis only to be coaxed out of retirement by her nagging Indian friend. But it?s improbable that the record-holder will continue playing beyond 2005. 

So if Paes really wants to make the living legend play in his country, he better tie up the loose ends fast. Otherwise, he will be left rueing a missed opportunity.

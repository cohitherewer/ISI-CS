 Korea rout Malaysia

Kuala Lumpur: South Korea shrugged off an initial challenge from Malaysia to record a 4-0 victory in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament at Bukit Jalil Stadium on Monday. 

Malaysia matched the fancied South Koreans in a well contested but barren first half only to cave in tamely after the break. 

The goal scorers were Jong Hyun-jang from penalty corners (43rd and 47th minutes), Eun Seong-hong (53rd minute) and Jong Ho-seo (68th minute). 

Malaysian captain Kuhan Shanmuganathan was rock solid in the deep, ably supported by veterans Nor Azlan Bakar and Chua Boon Huat, who successfully blanked numerous sorties from their rivals. 

In another match, scoring once in each half, New Zealand beat South Africa 2-0 in clinical fashion. 

Striker Philips Burrows put the Kiwis ahead in the tenth minute when he shot home a fierce reverse from the edge of the circle, while skipper Ryan Archibald flicked a penalty corner in the 49th minute to give the side its first win of the tournament. (PTI)

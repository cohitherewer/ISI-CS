 Storm may win in Mysore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Silver Storm and Agnivarsh look the best of the eight in the line to fight it out for the upper division of the split trophy event, the 1,400m Indraprastha Cup here on Wednesday. Going by their last clash, it is the J.S.Pillay-ward Silver Storm, with apprentice A.Velu in the saddle, who appears to have the edge over his main rival.

 The lower division of the trophy may see the Vivek-ridden Anchor from Mujeeb-Ur Rahmans yard coming good. Anchor has been knocking at the door.

 Team India momentum keeps Lanka uneasy

 - Sachin hours away from 350th cap 

 Yuvraj excited over 1st ODI at home 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chandigarh: Despite being ranked No. 2 in ODIs, neither Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu nor coach Tom Moody exuded confidence in the lead-up to the second ODI, in neighbouring Mohali, on Friday. 

That cant be good news for backers of a team which got annihilated by 152 runs in Tuesdays Videocon Cup opener, in Nagpur. The series features seven ODIs, but such a thrashing can impact heavily on the matches that remain. 

While Atapattu unconvincingly spoke of putting the best XI out on the park, Moody accepted that arresting the momentum gained by Team India wouldnt be easy. Clearly, the Lankans havent recovered from the ambush-in-daylight at the VCA Stadium. 

Worse, Atapattu didnt even know that his deputy ? Mahela Jayawardene ? would be skipping the fourth ODI (Pune) on account of his wedding back in Colombo. No, he wont miss any match, the captain said at a Media conference, before correcting himself after an embarrassing prompt from manager Michael Tissera. 

This lack of communication has to work in Indias favour. 

Atapattu, incidentally, indicated a change is likely. However, he didnt go into specifics. 

The Indians, of course, are expected to keep faith in the same XI ? unless Murali Kartik, the super sub in Nagpur, makes the starting line-up and his place is taken by Yalaka Venugopal Rao. 

A nice start always makes it easier and one must enjoy the good days as the tough ones will also be there, pointed out the Indian captain, Rahul Dravid. Hes not taking anything for granted. 

Given that the match is a day-nighter, dew is bound to be a factor and has to influence strategy. Its generally held that bowling second is a bigger nuisance than seeing a wet outfield cut down boundaries. 

The toss, therefore, assumes more significance than it otherwise would have. 

Much of the attention, by the way, is going to be on Sachin Tendulkar who is hours away from his 350th one-day cap. Only Wasim Akram has played more, but Inzamam-ul Haq and Sanath Jayasuriya arent far behind. 

With four wins in five ODIs, Mohali has to be considered a lucky venue for India. And, one Yuvraj Singh will be hoping he gets lucky: Hes a Chandigarh da puttar and thousands are expected to root for him. 

Its going to be my first ODI in my home state (Punjab) and Im excited... Yet, Im also worried about arranging complimentaries and tickets for family and friends, Yuvraj, who received special attention from coach Greg Chappell at Thursdays nets, told The Telegraph. 

Being a local icon has its drawbacks.

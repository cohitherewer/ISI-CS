Hong Kong: World champions Brazil will use Wednesday?s friendly vs Hong Kong as serious preparation for next month?s World Cup qualifier against Peru, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has promised. 

Although Real Madrid striker Ronaldo will be missing from Brazil?s first match of 2005, Parreira will be able to pick from a strong squad for the game taking place on the first day of the Chinese New Year. 

Real Madrid refused Ronaldo permission to travel for the game which Adriano of Inter Milan will also miss because of injury.However, Ronaldo?s club-mate Roberto Carlos is in the squad for the match at the 40,000-seater Hong Kong Stadium which will celebrate the 90th-year anniversaries of the Brazilian Football Confederation and the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA). 

 Ronaldo, who has played 99 times for Brazil, will marry MTV hostess Daniella Cicarelli at a lavish reception in a 17th century chateau in Paris on Valentine?s Day, and his absence is regretted in Hong Kong. ?It is disappointing that Ronaldo cannot play here,? said HKFA general secretary Martin Lam. 

Apart from Carlos, Brazil will be at full strength and will include 2004 World Footballer of the Year Ronaldinho, Cafu, and rising star Robinho, who currently plays for Brazilian club Santos. (Reuters)

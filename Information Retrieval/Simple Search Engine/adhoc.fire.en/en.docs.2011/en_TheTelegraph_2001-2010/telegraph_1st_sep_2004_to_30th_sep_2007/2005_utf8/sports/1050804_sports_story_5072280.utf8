 Vaughan cleared 

Birmingham: England were handed a timely boost on the eve of the second Ashes Test on Wednesday when captain Michael Vaughan passed himself fit to play at Edgbaston. 

Vaughan, who had an X-ray after being struck on the elbow in the nets by seamer Chris Tremlett on Tuesday, told a news conference: I feared the worst. If it had been a break it would not just have been just one Test, it would have been a lot more. 

A lot of emotions run through your mind. Its a great feeling when you get the X-rays back and theres no break. 

England, 0-1 down in the five-match series against the world champions, released allrounder Paul Collingwood from their squad on the eve of the second Ashes Test, 48 hours after calling him up. 

Australia, in contrast, seem certain to retain the winning formula that earned them a 239-run victory at Lords, even though Michael Kasprowicz pressed Jason Gillespie hard for the third seamers slot with five wickets against Worcestershire. 

Left-arm spinner Ashley Giles was widely criticised in the media for his anonymous showing in the series opener. 

Giles survived because of Englands belief in continuity of selections as well as the improving weather which has helped dry out the Edgbaston track, even though it remains damp under the surface. 

Giles state of mind ? he hit back emotionally this week at his critics, even suggesting that some former England players wanted the team to lose ? has been as big a talking point since Lords as his bowling. 

Some commentators have wondered how he will cope with Australian sledging if he cannot cope with his own press but few have championed an alternative spinner to replace him.

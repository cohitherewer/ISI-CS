 Bhutia to skip Pak tour

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The AIFF picked up 33 probables for the Pakistan tour without Bhaichung Bhutia. Bhaichung, suffering from a stomach bug, has asked for rest. 

Meanwhile, former great Ahmed Khan will accompany as a delegate the India contingent in Pakistan. 

The AIFF, meanwhile, has decided to show cause Tollygunge Agragami and Churchill patrons, charging them with anti-federation comments. 

Tollygunge secretary Mantoo Ghosh had earlier stated that his club could explore the possibility of playing a ?got up match? with Mohun Bagan in a bid to help the latter save from relegation. Churchill Alemao, on the other hand, threatened to go to the court if the AIFF remains firm on its decision to relegate the last four teams of the NFL.

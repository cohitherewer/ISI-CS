 Sydney: Mark Philippoussis has been ruled out of Australia?s Davis Cup quarter final against Argentina this month because of an ankle injury, with Peter Luczak called into the team to replace him.

 World No. 2 Lleyton Hewitt and Davis Cup veteran Wayne Arthurs is likely to shoulder most of the burden after the loss of Philippoussis and the retirement of record-breaking doubles player Todd Woodbridge.

 The 28-year-old Philippoussis had not recovered from the ankle tendon injury he suffered during Wimbledon, Australia?s Davis Cup captain John Fitzgerald said on Tuesday. 

 Paris: Richard Gasquet will spearhead France in their Davis Cup quarter-final against Russia later this month in Moscow.

 The 19-year-old overtook Sebastien Grosjean as the French No. 1 after winning his first ATP title in Nottingham last month before reaching the fourth round of Wimbledon.

 ?He is undisputable in the team,? said captain Guy Forget. ?He has all it takes to become a great Davis Cup player.?

 The world No. 17 has been picked alongside Arnaud Clement, doubles specialist Michael Llodra and Paul-Henri Mathieu.

 With exhausted Grosjean out of the team, Gael Monfils has been named as a replacement. 

 Budapest: Hungary?s parliament has approved the country?s joint bid with Croatia to host the 2012 European soccer championship finals.

 The decision was reached late on Monday.

 Also bidding to stage the 2012 tournament are Greece, Italy, Russia and Turkey and Poland-Ukraine jointly. It is Hungary?s third attempt to stage the tournament after a joint bid with Austria for Euro 2004 and a single bid for Euro 2008. Austria and Switzerland are staging Euro 2008 jointly. Uefa will make a decision on Euro 2012 in December 2006.

 Rome: Italy striker Christian Vieri has joined AC Milan from city rivals Inter Milan, the Champions League finalists said on Tuesday.

 The 31-year-old, released by Inter last week, signed a contract until June 2007, the club said on its website.

 At Inter, Vieri was one of the best-paid players in Italy, earning a reported 12 million euros ($14.25 million) a year including sponsorship and marketing deals. Milan?s statement did not reveal how much he would earn at his new club.

 Milan is Vieri?s 10th club in a much-travelled career which began with Torino. His latest move came as a surprise in Italy, where Milan had been considered among his less likely destinations. The 2004 Italian champions appeared to be looking elsewhere. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid midfielder Santiago Solari is poised to sign a three-year deal with Inter Milan, a Spanish sports daily said on Tuesday.

 The Argentine will move for a nominal fee as a clause in his contract allowed him freedom to leave if he did not complete a set number of games with Real.

 Paris: Zinedine Zidane has denied he is considering a return to international soccer to help France qualify for the 2006 World Cup. ?I said I was stopping playing for France. You know very well that when I have made a decision, the decision has been made. I?ll stick to my decision,? the Real Madrid playmaker said on Saturday.

 On Friday, a paper reported that Zidane might be considering a comeback to rescue the former world champions whose qualifying campaign for the 2006 finals in Germany has not gone smoothly. On Saturday, however, the paper published a new telephone interview. ?I heard on television that it was possible I would come back. It?s not right,? Zidane said. 

 Moscow: St Petersburg politician Vitaly Mutko was overwhelmingly voted president of the Russian Football Union (RFU) on Saturday after two of his main rivals dropped out. Mutko, 46, succeeds Vyacheslav Koloskov, who resigned in January after more than 25 years in the job, forced out by government officials unhappy at the way he was running Russia?s most popular sport. 

 London: Olympic chiefs have applauded the decision to reject appeals by Hungarian athletes Adrian Annus and Robert Fazekas to have their gold medals reinstated. The pair were stripped of their medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics for refusing to give urine samples. The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday threw out their appeals.

 ?The IOC welcomes this decision which is a clear backing to President (Jacques) Rogge?s zero tolerance policy in the fight against doping,? IOC communications chief Giselle Davies said. 

 Brisbane: London have enlisted Australian Olympic champions Cathy Freeman and Grant Hackett to act as international ambassadors for their bid to host the 2012 Games.

 The chairman of the London bid, Sebastian Coe, said he hoped the high profile pair would help London;s chances of securing the Olympics when the International Olympic Committee makes its decision in July.

 The appointment follows New York?s decision to use Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe as one of their ambassadors while former Wallabies World Cup winning captain John Eales has joined the French bid.

 ?Cathy?s on board because apart from the fact she?s a very good friend of mine, she believes London is the best place for a games to be hosted,? Coe told a news conference on Saturday. 

 Brisbane: Spanish Olympic officials insist the racism row that has tarnished the country?s sporting image should not effect Madrid?s chances of staging the 2012 Olympics.

 Spanish soccer has been engulfed by a series of racist scandals but Spanish IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr said the incidents should not reflect on the whole country.

 ?Spain is not a racist country,? Samaranch told a news conference on Saturday .

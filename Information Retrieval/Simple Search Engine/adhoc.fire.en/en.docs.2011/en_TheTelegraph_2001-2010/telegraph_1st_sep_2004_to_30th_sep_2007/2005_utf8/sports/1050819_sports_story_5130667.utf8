 Its like trying to solve a puzzle: Langer

 - ENGLISH REVERSE SWING 

 - A great challenge for senior players 

 Langer says there is a lot of discussion among Aussies on reverse swing 

London: Australia believe the key to keeping the Ashes is to solve the mystery of Englands reverse swing. 

The ability of pacemen Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones to swing the ball has troubled the tourists no end, with the problem coming to a head in the nail-biting third Test at Old Trafford on Monday. 

Opening batsman Justin Langer has admitted that coach John Buchanan and skipper Ricky Ponting, who made a match-saving, seven-hour 156 in Manchester, have formed a brainstrust to find an answer. 

We are talking a lot about it and there is some really healthy discussion going on amongst the batsmen, said Langer. 

For the senior players it is a great challenge, people say that too often and it is a well-used cliche, but this really is. It is like trying to solve a puzzle. 

When a ball reverse-swings, rather than be instinctive and go for your shots, you have to tighten up a little bit more and wait until the ball is further down the wicket before making your decision because you are not sure which way it is going to swing. 

The rare art of gaining vicious aerial movement with a roughed-up ball was perfected by Pakistan pair Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis in the early 1990s. Others have followed suit, but it is unusual for a bowler to arc deliveries both into and away from batsmen. 

Langer, who was enthralled watching opening partner Matthew Hayden attempt to combat Flintoff in Manchester, added: We have not cracked it yet, but that is the exciting thing about cricket? if we said we had, it would be a pretty boring game. 

We have been facing reverse swing for more than 10 years, mainly on the subcontinent, but the difference here is they are getting the ball to move the other way. 

Flintoff has quickly become Englands dangerman with the ball despite just one five-wicket haul in 50 Test appearances while Jones productivity has also increased sharply ? they have 16 and 13 wickets in the series, respectively. 

Without the ball reverse-swinging, you do not feel Jones is supremely quick, he doesnt swing the ball abnormally but when he starts reversing it, he is in the ball game, said Langer. 

You have got to knuckle down and your scoring options are really limited.

 We need a lot of luck: Klinsmann

Rio de Janeiro: Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann says next years World Cup hosts will need plenty of good fortune to win the trophy and named Brazil and Argentina as title favourites. 

I think it will be possible for Germany to win the World Cup but we need luck, a lot of luck, Klinsmann said on Thursday during a flying visit to Brazil. 

The South Americans are very strong and I see Brazil and Argentina as the favourites, he told newsmen as he took part in a two-day coaching seminar organised by his Brazil counterpart Carlos Alberto Parreira. 

I have a lot to learn from Parreira, who is a coach who leaves nothing to chance. 

Were not yet where Brazil and Argentina are but were working hard and we still have a little bit of time left, added Klinsmann. 

Germany drew 2-2 with Argentina at the Confederations Cup in June before losing 3-4 to Brazil in the semis. 

Ukraine have a very good team and I think that maybe they, Mexico and the United States could spring a surprise, said Klinsmann, naming his dark horses for the World Cup. 

We have a big responsibility as its important for the atmosphere of the tournament that the hosts stay in as long as possible. 

We have a very, very young team but our players are learning and getting better. 

They need more time to develop and I think that in four or five years well have a really strong team. 

Klinsmann blamed the death of street football in Germany and the Bosman ruling for his countrys failure to keep churning out top players. 

Today all the youth football is played in organised tournaments, we dont have kids playing in the streets any more. But its in street football where the real talent appears, he said.

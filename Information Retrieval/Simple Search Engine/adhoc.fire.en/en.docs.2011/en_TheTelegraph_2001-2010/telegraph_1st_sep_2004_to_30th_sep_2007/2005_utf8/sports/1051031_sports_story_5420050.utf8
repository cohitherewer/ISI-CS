Islamabad: Memories of their thrilling win in Karachi five years ago will spur England on when their tour of Pakistan starts in earnest on Monday. 

England play a three-day match against a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) patrons XI and coach Duncan Fletcher said: I am sure we will take inspiration from the Karachi win. 

We want to win every Test from the start of this tour and set the mark, he told a news conference. 

Fletcher was coach of the England side captained by Nasser Hussain that won the final Test in Karachi in December 2000 to take the series 1-0. 

Moreover, he guided England to their first Ashes series win over Australia in 18 years this summer, another source of inspiration for his squad. 

Coming here after winning the Ashes is a big advantage, he said. 

To be honest, we cant get the Ashes win out of the teams scheme and at the end of the day it should give us confidence and the self-belief that we can beat Pakistan. 

But Fletcher warned his players against overconfidence and being complacent. 

This is a difficult tour for us, and beating Pakistan at home is never easy. They have always been a talented bunch of players, he added. 

The PCB XI includes several Test players, but the hosts have allowed England to use the practice game to try out all their 14-players. 

England play the first Test in Multan from November 12. 

However, Fletcher played down the spin threat from Pakistan. 

I am very confident that our batsmen can handle the spinners. Based on the fact that they played Shane Warne better in the Ashes and we saw some of the worlds best players struggle against spin in the World XI match. 

Our batters have experience against a quality spinner like Warne and they can handle it pretty well. 

Fletcher said his team was getting mixed messages about the pitches for the Tests but he expected them to take some turn. 

It seems they want spin wickets as well but either way we are covered to handle spin and pace. And if the wickets are dry then the reverse swing comes into play. We have covered our bases well which we didnt have before.

 Supreme Court throws away BCCI petition 

OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The new rule by former election commissioner T. S. Krishnamurty, who has been appointed observer to the BCCI elections, that the cricket bodys president would have only the casting vote in the case of a tie triggered a legal battle. 

However, the Supreme Court on Friday threw out a petition by the board challenging it. 

Krishnamurty has ruled that the BCCI president would only have the casting vote in case of a tie in the two-day meeting scheduled in Calcutta from Tuesday. The Ranbir Singh Mahendra-led body opposed the ruling. 

But the apex bench, comprising Justices B. P. Singh and Raja Varadarajulu Raveendran, said the election should first take place and only then can it be challenged for any wrongdoing. Let the election take place.... You can then challenge the election.... 

If we find anything wrong, we will set it aside.... but then the election should first be conducted as scheduled, the division bench observed while declining to interfere with the election process at this stage. 

Counsel for BCCI, Radha Rangaswamy, made an urgent mention of the petition in the apex court contending that time was short and Krishnamurty has overstepped his jurisdiction. 

The apex bench told the Jharkhand, UP, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh cricket clubs to make applications before Krishnamurty about their voting rights. 

The Jharkhand Cricket Association had contended that it was debarred from participating in the elections and that its Bihar counterpart was allowed. After the division of the state into two, Jharkhand and Bihar, both the clubs should be allowed to vote. Similarly Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) and National Cricket Club (NCC) of Calcutta are kept away from the election. 

UP and HP associations were told that only those units recognised by the director of sports of the respective states would be allowed to take part in the elections. 

All these appeals will now have to be heard by Krishnamurty on Saturday. Sunday is the date for filing of nomination.

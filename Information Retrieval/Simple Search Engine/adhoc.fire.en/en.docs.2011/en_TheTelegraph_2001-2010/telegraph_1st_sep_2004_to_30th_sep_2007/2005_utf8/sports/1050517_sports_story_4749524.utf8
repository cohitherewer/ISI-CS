The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Friday ties may be deferred

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The final-round matches of the National Football League, scheduled for Friday, may be pushed back by a day. 

With state police refusing permission to Fridays scheduled game between East Bengal and Vasco at Salt Lake Stadium, the IFA is planning to move the game to Siliguri which will need an extra day to arrange. 

Since the championship issue hasnt been settled yet, all the three contenders ? Sporting Clube de Goa (vs Mahindra United), Dempo (vs Tollygunge Agragami) and East Bengal ? have to play simultaneously to rule out any chance of foul-play. 

The match between SBT, who have already relegated, and Fransa ? slated to be held in Kozhikode on Friday ? may also be pushed back.

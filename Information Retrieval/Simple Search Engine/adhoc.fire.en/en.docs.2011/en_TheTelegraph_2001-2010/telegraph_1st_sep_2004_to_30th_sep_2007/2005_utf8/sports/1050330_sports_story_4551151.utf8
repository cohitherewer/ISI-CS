The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hameed decision gets undone

 - Bari accuses Woolmer of interference 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Yasir Hameed 

Calcutta: Poor Yasir Hameed. Hours after being informed he would stay back as the 17th player for the six ODIs, he learnt he would actually have to go home. 

?Decisions can be undone? When we were reminded that more than 16 players can?t be on tour for a one-day series, the captain (Inzamam-ul Haq) personally spoke to Yasir and said he shouldn?t get discouraged,? Pakistan manager Saleem Altaf told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Hyderabad, late on Tuesday, he added: ?The captain, in fact, explained that a tour of the West Indies was coming up and opportunities would definitely be there.? 

Altaf had, a day earlier, revealed that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had okayed Inzamam?s ?request? on Hameed. 

Hameed and two others ? Taufeeq Umar and Mohammed Khalil ? are expected to leave for home on Wednesday. 

PTI adds from Karachi: Meanwhile, chief selector Wasim Bari has accused coach Bob Woolmer of ?forcing his will? on the selection committee. 

?Woolmer?s interference in selection committee matters made our job really difficult and we, the selection committee members, are not finding it easy to perform our duties,? Bari was quoted as saying in a local daily.

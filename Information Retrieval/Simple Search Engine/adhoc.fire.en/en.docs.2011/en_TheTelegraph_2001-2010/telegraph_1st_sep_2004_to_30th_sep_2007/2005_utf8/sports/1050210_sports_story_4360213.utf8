Hong Kong: Brazil began their year in sublime form as they crushed Hong Kong 7-1 in a friendly on Wednesday. 

The world champions put on a breath-taking display to thrill a festive crowd celebrating the first day of the Chinese New Year at the Hong Kong Stadium. 

Brazil hardly missed top striker Ronaldo, not released by Real Madrid for this warm-up game for next month?s World Cup qualifier against Peru, against a side ranked 134th in the world. 

Ricardo Oliveira scored twice and Lucio, Robinho, Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos, with a stunnning 25-metre shot, were also on target. 

Substitute Alex converted a late penalty to complete the rout and leave Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira a happy man. 

?I?m very happy with the commitment shown by the players. Even though we are five-time world champions and our technical and skill levels were much higher than Hong Kong, you still have to go out and show commitment. And we did this today,? Parreira said. 

Brazil led 3-0 at halftime and despite the early substitutions of skipper Cafu, Ronaldinho, the 2004 World Footballer of the Year, and Roberto Carlos, they kept up the pressure until the end. 

?We were training while we were playing,? Parreira said. ?It is very difficult to get the players together and this was a big opportunity for us to train and play as a team.? 

Hong Kong?s consolation goal came four minutes from time when substitute Lee Sze-ming slotted home following a goal-mouth scramble. (Reuters)

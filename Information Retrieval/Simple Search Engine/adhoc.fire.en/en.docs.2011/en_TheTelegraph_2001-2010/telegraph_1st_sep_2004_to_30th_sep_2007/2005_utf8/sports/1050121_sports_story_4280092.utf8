 Lausanne: Fina has announced that it has withdrawn this summer?s world championships from Montreal because of a financing problem. Fina also said that it would organise a short bid procedure and announce no later than February 15 which city will be the new venue for the championships.

 ?The Fina bureau regrets having to make this decision, but it was necessary to secure the holding of the championships in 2005,? Fina said in a statement on Wednesday.

 The Montreal organisers had signalled they were having difficulties with a euro 7.5 million cash shortfall for the July 17-31 championships. 

 Srinagar: Canada is expected to become the first-ever foreign team to participate in the country?s national ice hockey championship which begins on Monday at Leh in frontier region of Ladakh.

 As many as seven local teams from Leh and Kargil will also feature in the third edition of the championship, besides several national teams, official sources said on Thursday after deputy commissioner Satish Nehru convened a meeting at Leh to review the arrangements for the championship. 

 Bangkok: The Thailand Open, the country?s most prestigious golf tournament, has been moved from the mainland to Phuket to aid the resort island?s recovery following the tsunami tragedy, the Asian Tour said on Friday.

 Tour chief Louis Martin said the tour was also looking at initiatives to raise funds for tsunami victims during the March 3-6 tournament.

 Turin: Adrian Mutu?s transfer to Juventus was put on hold as the Serie A team awaited official word from the English FA and settlement of league rules on non-EU players.

 Mutu, who was to be presented by Juventus on Wednesday, is reportedly entangled in a contractual dispute with former club Chelsea, who fired him after he tested positive for cocaine.

 Juventus had announced the signing of the Romania forward last week. He was offered a five-year contract, but he will not be eligible to play until May 18 because of his seven-month doping suspension.

 Amsterdam: US central defender Corey Gibbs has joined Feyenoord on a four-and-a-half-year contract from Dallas Burn, the Rotterdam-based club said on Thursday. The 25-year-old was on trial with the first division team during a winter break training camp in Spain where he managed to convince coach Ruud Gullit to sign him.

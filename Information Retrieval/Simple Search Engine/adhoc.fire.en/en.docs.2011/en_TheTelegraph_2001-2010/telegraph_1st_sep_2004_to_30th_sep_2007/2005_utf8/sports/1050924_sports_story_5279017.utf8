 Swiss take 2-0 lead over Britain

Geneva: Switzerlands Davis Cup team took a commanding two-point lead over Britain thanks to opening day wins for Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka on Friday. 

Looking to preserve Switzerlands place in the elite World Group, Federer fired them in front with a thunderous 6-0, 6-0, 6-2 victory over hapless world number 262 Alan Mackin. 

The world number one then looked on as Wawrinka doubled the Swiss lead with a more tightly contested 6-3, 7-6, 6-4 win over Scottish teenager Andy Murray. 

I have never managed two 6-0 sets (back-to-back) before, said Federer. 

I knew I was a big favourite of course but it wasnt so easy going into the match because I couldnt remember the last time I played someone ranked so low. 

It would have been a big disaster for me if I had lost so there was a lot on the line but now Im just happy to have lots of energy left for the rest of the tie. 

Meanwhile, in Torre Del Greco, Spains world No. 2 Rafael Nadal beat Italys Daniele Bracciali in straight sets to bring them level at 1-1 in their Davis Cup World Group playoff on Friday. 

Nadal swept aside Bracciali 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 to ensure the Spaniards go into Saturdays doubles on equal terms after Juan Carlos Ferrero suffered a surprise defeat to Andreas Seppi 7-5, 6-3, 0-6, 3-6, 2-6. 

In Split, Nikolay Davydenko gave Russia a perfect start to their Davis Cup semi-final against Croatia on Friday, beating local favourite Mario Ancic 7-5, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in the opening singles. 

Ancic, enjoying raucous support from a partisan crowd inside the Gripe Sports Hall in the historic port city, never got to grips with an inspired world number seven, succumbing in three hours 30 minutes. 

Slovakia also got off to a flying start in Bratislava, Karol Beck giving the hosts a 1-0 lead, thanks to a 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 win over Argentinas Guillermo Coria in the opening singles on Friday.

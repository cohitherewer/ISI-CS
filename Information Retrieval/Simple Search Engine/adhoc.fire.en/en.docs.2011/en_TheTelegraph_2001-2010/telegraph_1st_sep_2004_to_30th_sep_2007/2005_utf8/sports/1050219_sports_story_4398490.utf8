 Sachin to lead West vs South

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar will lead West Zone against South in the Duleep Trophy league tie in Hyderabad from Tuesday in his comeback match following an injury lay-off, national selection committee chairman Kiran More said on Friday. 

?Sachin is not only playing, but will also be leading the side,? said More, who is also the chief selector of West Zone. 

More, who spoke to the batting maestro on Friday to get the latter?s confirmation, said ?he feels fine?. 

Tendulkar has not played since turning out for India in the last one-day International against Bangladesh in Dhaka on December 27, but has started practising over the last few days at the MIG Cricket Club ground in Bandra, close to his residence. 

Tendulkar came on Friday to the MIG Club to give a pep talk to the visiting English county cricketers, who played a match against a local squad. 

?He came to the ground at the request of visiting team?s coach Graham Gooch (former England captain) to give a pep talk to the squad members,? sources close to the batsman said, adding that ?he is very keen to play against Pakistan.? 

There was further good news for India in the run-up to the high-voltage series against Pakistan with Irfan Pathan, who also had been recovering from a side strain picked up during the Bangladesh tour, being cleared to play in Duleep Trophy.

 Milan: Luis Figo has agreed to join Inter Milan, ending a five-year spell at Real Madrid, news reports said on Thursday.

 Figo is expected to go to Milan and undergo medical examinations with Inter before the signing was officially announced, Italian newspapers reported.

 However, Inter said it still had ?nothing to report?.

 Figo, whose contract with Madrid was to expire in June 2006, wanted a two-year contract comparable to the $7.4 million deal he reportedly had at the Spanish club. Reports indicated that Inter had signed him to a $8.62 million deal over two seasons and that the move did not include a transfer fee.

 London: Everton have agreed to sign Manchester United?s England defender Phil Neville, the Merseyside club said on Thursday. The 28-year-old full back, who has 52 international caps, underwent a medical in Liverpool later on Thursday. No initial details of a fee were available.

 Neville, who can also play in midfield, has spent his entire 10-year playing career at United after coming through the trainee ranks alongside brother Gary and signed a new five-year contract in 2004.

 However, he struggled to command a regular starting position last season and with next year?s World Cup on the horizon he opted to move. 

 Bhubaneswar: Young Indian hockey player William Xalxo has been chosen for this year?s prestigious Ekalabya Award for excellence in sports.The award will be presented to Xalxo at a function to be held here on Saturday, according to an Indian Metals Public Charitable Trust (Impact) release on Thursday. Monalisa Mohanty (rowing) and Subhadra Pradhan (hockey) will also be presented with citations, the release said. 

 London: Former Formula One world champions Emerson Fittipaldi, Alain Prost and Alan Jones head a field of over 45-year-old drivers in the inaugural Grand Prix of a new Masters series launched on Thursday.

 Up to 16 identical cars capable of speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour (321.9 kph) are expected to take part at the former Grand Prix venue of Kyalami on November 13.

 A spokesman for the organisers said they were in discussion with 1992 Formula One world champion Nigel Mansell about his involvement.

 Gleneagles: Briton Colin Montgomerie retired from the Johnnie Walker Championship on Thursday after playing only 12 holes, suffering a hand injury. He jarred his fingers while playing from the fairway of the 18th, his ninth, and four holes later was forced to pull out. His challenge for the year?s final major, the US PGA Championship, in New Jersey, is now in doubt.

 Sydney: Injured Australian cyclists Alexis Rhodes and Louise Yaxley have been moved out of a German hospital?s intensive care unit and have joined their less seriously injured teammates, Cycling Australia (CA) said.

 The pair, along with three teammates, were injured when an 18-year-old driver lost control of her car, crossed to the other side of the road and ploughed into the six-member Australian women?s team while they were training in Germany on July 18. One rider, Amy Gillett, was killed instantly.

 The fifth injured cyclist, Kate Nichols, returned to Australia last weekend.

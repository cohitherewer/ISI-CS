 Sandeep hattrick gives India great start

 - JR WORLD CUP Aussies, Koreans win big 

Rotterdam: A hattrick by penalty corner specialist Sandeep Singh was the highlight of Indias 4-1 win against Egypt in their opening pool D league match of the Rabobank junior World Cup hockey tournament here on Wednesday. 

Sandeep came up with solid conversions in the fifth, 26th and 56th minutes while V. Raja found the boards from a goalmouth melee in the 60th. 

Egypt marked their presence with a 56th-minute strike by Mahmoud Elbadry from a penalty corner. 

Indias first-half performance was definitely lackadaisical. They enjoyed a distinctly better second half during which they displayed cohesion and understanding to repeatedly trouble Egypt. But then, the forwards fumbled in front of the goal and the missed chances pegged the scoreline. 

To an extent, the Indians appeared over-confident and it led to an Egyptian counter-attack that resulted in a penalty corner goal. 

Pakistan rode two penalty corner goals by Imran Muhammad to beat Belgium 3-1 in a pool B league encounter. 

Surprised by a third-minute goal by Mike Dewever, Pakistan struggled to make an impression until Imran converted the first of his two penalty corners with a drag-flick in the 28th. 

On resumption, Belgium continued to frustrate the Pakistanis with close marking, but Imran came good with yet another drag-flick in the 64th and Arif Muhammad made it 3-1 four minutes from the close. 

Meanwhile in other matches on Wednesday, Australia thumped Chile 12-0 and Korea hammered Mexico 11-0. 

Australia, playing Chile for the first time, did not take any chances and were on target from the start. Leading 7-0 at half time, the Aussies struck at regular intervals through Colin Hennessey (4), Thomas Cleghorn (2), Glenn Turner (2), Jonathan Charlesworth, Iain Davidson, Desmond Abbot and Kiel Brown. 

The Aussie team is without their key forward, Stephen Boyce who is recovering from a knee surgery. 

Korea took time to settle down, but once they got in, the Mexicans were mere spectators to the destruction. 

Leading 3-0 at the break, the Koreans stepped up the pace and put on display their speed and co-ordination that brooked no response from Mexico. (AGENCIES)

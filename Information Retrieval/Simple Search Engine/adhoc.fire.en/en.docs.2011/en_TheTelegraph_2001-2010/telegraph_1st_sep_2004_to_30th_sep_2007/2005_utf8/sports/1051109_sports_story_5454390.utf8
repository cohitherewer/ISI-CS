 Nyon: Anderlecht striker Nenad Jestrovic was banned for three matches by Uefa on Monday following his sending-off in a Champions League match against Liverpool last week. European soccer?s ruling body decided that Jestrovic had racially insulted Liverpool midfielder Mohamed Sissoko during a heated argument in the 75th minute of the game.

 Jestrovic said he would not appeal against the decision. ?I accept the decision but unfortunately I was on a losing ticket because the referee?s report said one thing and I said another,? he said. ?I am not a racist but unfortunately I dont matter and the referee does.? 

 Moscow: Russia coach Yuri Syomin has quit after his team failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. Syomin, 58, announced his resignation on Tuesday after meeting Russian soccer chief Vitaly Mutko.

 ?I?m more of a club coach,? said Syomin. Before the national team job he had spent 16 years coaching Lokomotiv Moscow, winning two Russian league titles.

 Russian media reported he had been offered a long-term contract by Dynamo Moscow who fired their Brazilian coach Ivo Wortman on Monday following a string of poor results. 

 London: Uefa have shortlisted Italy and joint bids from Croatia/Hungary and Poland/Ukraine to host the European Championship in 2012, rejecting rival bids from Greece and Turkey on Tuesday.

 Uefa, who ended the first phase of bidding at an executive committee meeting in Malta, will make a final decision on the hosts of the 16-team tournament in December 2006.

 The 2008 championship is being jointly staged by Austria and Switzerland. 

 Madrid: Four-time Tour of Spain winner Roberto Heras has blamed a laboratory mix-up as the reason for his suspected positive test for the banned blood-boosting substance erythropoietin (EPO).

 The 31-year-old, a former teammate of seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, has been suspended after giving a positive test during this year?s race.

 ?They told me the news at the end of October. The only thing I can think of is that it is a laboratory error,? Heras, who is classed as one of the best climbers in the world, told radio station Onda Cero on Tuesday.

 ?My lawyers and the team are working on the case as we speak and there will be a B test on November 21.?

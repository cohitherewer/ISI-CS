 Noah move fails, what next?

 - No end to Mauresmos Roland Garros plight

Paris: Adding the inspirational force of former champion Yannick Noah to the camp and cause wasnt enough for Amelie Mauresmo this year at the French Open. 

Whats next? Channeling the spirit of Suzanne Lenglen? Or conducting an exorcism on Court Philippe Chatrier, the scene of so many of Mauresmos past disappointments? 

The Frenchwomans latest setback came on Saturday in the third round against Ana Ivanovic of Serbia and Montenegro. The fast-rising 17-year-old defeated the third-seeded Mauresmo 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 (as reported in Sundays Late City edition) in two hours and eight minutes. 

There is a temptation to compare Mauresmos problems at Roland Garros with Tim Henmans difficulties at Wimbledon, but that would be unfair to Henman. The Briton, at least, has reached the semi-finals four times at Wimbledon, whereas Mauresmo has reached the French Open quarter finals twice. 

Of course, I wanted to go further in the tournament, she said. What can I say? Its a big disappointment of course. In the past I had some bad matches. But I dont think that was the case Saturday. 

Mauresmo, who double-faulted 10 times, obviously had not seen footage of the final game. She committed two unforced errors, netted a forehand under pressure and double-faulted on Ivanovics first match-point, hitting a weak second serve into the net. 

The eighth game of the last set featured some unexpected drama. Ivanovic suddenly requested a visit from the trainer, delaying the match by a few minutes. 

I had problems with breathing. I felt really dizzy, she said. I felt really weak, so I thought I had to call my trainer straightaway to see if everything is okay. 

Ivanovic is already six feet tall. She fits in quite nicely with all the other tall players on the Tour: Maria Sharapova, Elena Bovina, Nadia Petrova. 

A lot of these Russian girls, and a lot of the girls in general, are getting a lot bigger than they used to be, said American Marissa Irvin, who lost in the third round Saturday. Five years ago when I started playing on the Tour, I think I was probably average height, a little under five-seven. Im by no means tall, but Im also not short in real life. 

On the Tour, in the locker room, Im looking shorter and shorter every day.

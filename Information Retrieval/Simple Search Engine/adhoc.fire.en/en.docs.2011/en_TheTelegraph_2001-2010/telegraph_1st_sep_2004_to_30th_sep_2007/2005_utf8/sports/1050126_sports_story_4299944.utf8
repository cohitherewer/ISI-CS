 March return for Murali

 Murali has been included in the 24-man pool 

Colombo: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan will return to Test cricket in March for the series against New Zealand after an extended layoff with a shoulder injury, the cricket board said Tuesday. 

Muralidharan has been sidelined since August when he withdrew before the second Test of the two-match series against South Africa in Sri Lanka. He later underwent surgery in Australia. 

Sri Lanka Cricket said Tuesday that it has included the off-spinner in a 24-man pool for the tour of New Zealand in March, which was rescheduled after the December 26 tsunami. 

THE pool 

Maravan Atapattu (captain), Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralidharan, Kumar Sangakkara, Ian Daniel, Saman Jayantha, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Thilan Samaraweera, Jehan Mubarak, Chaminda Vaas, Prasanna Jayawardene, Dilhara Fernando, Nuwan Zoysa, Lasith Malinga, Farveez Mahroof, Nuwan Kulasekara, Upul Chandana, Kaushal Lokuarachchi, Rangana Herath, Thilina Kandamby, Nandika Ranjith, Chanaka Welagedara and Russel Arnold.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand slips to joint 2nd

 Veselin Topalov is in sole lead 

Wijk Aan Zee: Back in contention with three consecutive wins, Viswanathan Anand opted to quickly split points with BrainGames champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the eighth round of the Corus chess tournament here (reported briefly in Monday?s Late city edition). 

After a relatively indifferent start to his campaign, Anand cruised to victories over Ruslan Ponomoriov, Alexander Morozevich and Lazaro Bruzon to join the leaders but chose to play it safe against Kramnik ahead of Monday?s second rest day of this category-19 event being played under classical time control. 

With five rounds remaining, Anand is in joint second place along with Hungarian Peter Leko and Brit Michael Adams with five points from the possible eight while Bulgarian Veselin Topalov shot in to sole lead with a finely crafted victory over Bruzon of Cuba. He has 5.5 points. 

Russians Alexander Grischuk and Kramnik are next in line on 4.5 points while Bruzon, Ponomariov of Ukraine and Commonwealth champion Nigel Short of England are on a 50 per cent score with 4 points each in their kitty. 

Anand went for a safety first approach against the Sicilian Sveshnikov that had already given him jitters in the second round of the tournament against Leko. 

Having lost against Leko in the same opening, Anand was simply cautious and that was probably the reason why the Indian ace could not establish any real advantage. 

The Sveshnkov is famous these days thanks to Kramnik?s exploit with the opening a few year?s back and he did not disappoint in getting an easy equality after the dust subsided in the middle game. 

The only twist in the game was when the Russian sacrificed a piece and then regained it almost immediately with a checkmate threat. The players arrived at a level queen and rooks endgame where the peace was signed after 27 moves at Kramnik?s behest. 

Topalov got a sweet victory against Bruzon who could not quite handle the intricacies of a King?s Indian attack with his white pieces. (PTI)

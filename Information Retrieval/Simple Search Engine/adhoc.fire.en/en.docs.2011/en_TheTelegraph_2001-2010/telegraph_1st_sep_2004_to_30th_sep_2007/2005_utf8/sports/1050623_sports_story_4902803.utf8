The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Warning from Greene

Carson (California): Before Maurice Greene eased into his German sports car and sped away from a Be A Champion motivational programme at a Californian school on Tuesday, he issued a stern warning to potential rivals. 

The 30-year-old former Olympic and world 100 m champion said he planned to set a scorching time in the first round of the 100 m at the US trials starting Thursday. 

Im going to send a message, said Greene. I ran a personal best in practice recently, and I have not done that in some time. 

Greenes first goal is to make the US team for the Helsinki world championships and then take on Jamaicas new world record holder Asafa Powell. 

Powells time of 9.77 seconds in Athens this month relegated Greene to third place in the all-time list. I think it is a good thing that the world record gets broken, Greene said. 

It means our sport is moving on, progressing. But I am not out of the sport and I know I have not run as fast as I can, so I am looking forward to it. 

For those who believe Greenes fastest days are behind him, the 2000 Sydney Olympic champion offered this advice: Ive always said, The more someone talks, the worse they are going to get it.

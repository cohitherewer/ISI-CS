The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Paes, Bhupathi eye a tie for Martina

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Martina is a quality human being, says Paes 

Hyderabad: For all the hype created over Martina Navratilova?s maiden visit to India, the Hyderabad public got to see her on court for just over an hour this week at the $140,000 WTA event. 

She and Anna-Lena Groenfeld, the top seeds, breezed through their opener and then came catastrophe. Five games into their second-round match on Thursday evening, Martina?s German partner hurt her knee badly enough to retire. The legend, who had conceded just one doubles match previously in an illustrious career, was left with no choice but to pack her bags and fly home rather prematurely. 

Denied a shot at another title by her partner?s injury and prevented from exploring the city freely thanks to choking security, the 48-year-old American?s Indian ?appetite? has hardly been satiated. Come September, will Calcutta be her next destination? 

The Telegraph has learnt that she is very much open to the idea of playing the $170,000 Sunfeast Open at the Netaji Indoor Stadium from September 19-25. Provided, she is still playing competitive tennis at that time. 

Going back on her word to quit at the end of last year, Martina has decided to play all four Grand Slams in 2005. But right now, she is not 100 per cent about whether she?ll continue after the US Open. The year?s final major tennis event ends on September 11 and the Calcutta WTA meet kicks off after a week. 

The monetary factor has got to be considered as well. Big names don?t come cheap for these Tier III and IV tournaments. Martina charged Globosport ?which runs both the WTA meets in India ? a much lower appearance fee than she normally does. Still, as a reliable source revealed, the amount was big enough to lure a handful of top-20 players. 

Mahesh Bhupathi has gone on record as saying that he is determined to bring three top-20 singles players for the inaugural meet in Calcutta. If he does succeed in luring three big enough names to the Tier III tournament, Martina may have to be ?sacrificed?. Otherwise, Bhupathi knows he can again fall back on the golden oldie to embellish the field. 

Even if Martina misses the September date, the City of Joy can still hope to catch the living legend live. Her favourite mixed doubles partner Leander Paes, who was the first to convince Martina to visit India for some exhibition matches over a year ago, is determined to finally convert words into action. 

Asked whether he was disappointed to see once-partner and close friend Bhupathi steal his thunder vis-?-vis the Martina visit, Paes was remarkably cool. ?Life?s a lot bigger than these small things? You know, Martina asked me the same question and I gave an identical answer,? Paes said from Mumbai. 

?True friendship is all about communicating each other?s needs and act accordingly. Martina did that? She is a quality human being, one of the best I have come across. I have absolutely no grudges against her,? Paes remarked. 

He didn?t miss out expressing his wish. ?It was good to see Martina playing the WTA meet? She has only played in Hyderabad. I want to make her play in Calcutta and some other cities,? he announced. 

Well, Bhupathi has won Round One. It remains to be seen whether Paes can get even on the Martina front.

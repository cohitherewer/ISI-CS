 Sharapova will be tougher than Serena

Serve amp; Volly

 Sania Mirza

Dhonis fireworks against New Zealand had barely ended when Sania took over and lit up Indian hearts with her best-ever Grand Slam performance to reach the fourth round of the US Open. More than anything, Sanias performance was packed with courage to go for winners when the chips were down. 

Bartoli, a 20-year-old experienced Frenchwoman who has been on the circuit for quite a few years, is a tough nut to crack. Playing double-handed on both flanks, she is an awkward customer as she hits an early rising ball. 

Bartoli stood a few feet inside the baseline to receive the serve, hustling and putting pressure on Sania. But Sanias suspect serve stood up well to this test. Though the match was riddled with Sanias errors, it was balanced in more than equal measure by the stunning winners she produced at crucial times. 

Sharapova will be a very tough call. I saw her first two matches, she hardly made any error. The Russian will surely attack Sanias serve and put a lot of pressure on her. It would be interesting to see how Sania handles her opponents serve. 

The only player of Sharapovas stature Ive seen Sania face is Serena at the Australian Open. She did quite well in that match, but I feel Sharapova will be tougher that Serena. 

Fridays match brought out some of Sanias weaknesses, although it was positive play worthy of someone aspiring for greatness. Firmly entrenched as she is now in the world rankings, moving higher will require even more hard work to overcome shortcomings. 

Though Sania belted a 120mph ace during the match, there is a glitch in her service action which must be set right. 

Swing, more than muscle power, should be the source of speed, else very soon your muscles will need rest and repair. Sania moved much better than before and hit a few stunning shots on the run off both flanks. 

She must learn that all shots cannot be despatched for winners. When out of position, one has to learn to defend and keep the ball in play. This will help Sania attain a much higher consistency level. 

A better serve, specially the second delivery, will elicit a weaker return and enable Sania to unleash her lethal forehand to greater effect. This has a very demoralising effect on the opponent. Most of the top players cover two-thirds of the court with their forehands. 

Sania must learn to use her forehand much more by running around her backhand. Such a measure is unsettling and puts a lot of pressure on your opponents. 

It would be nice if Sania could invest in a top level coach, preferably one who has produced or been associated with a top-10 player, or alternatively a former top-10 player. 

Since they have been to the summit, they can tell you how to avoid the pitfalls en route. Without proper guidance, even all-consuming passion and sacrifice are not enough.

 I wonder why I always play so well: Federer

New York: A hugely contented Roger Federer retained his US Open title on Sunday and then said he continued to amaze himself by his ability to find his best tennis when he needed it most. 

I still cant believe how well I have been playing in the last couple of years, said Federer, after his 6-3, 2-6, 7-6, 6-1 victory over 35-year-old crowd favourite Andre Agassi. 

I amazed myself that I can back it up one after another. I wonder why I always play so well, especially on the big occasions. 

By the age of 24, the Swiss world No. 1 captured his sixth Grand Slam title to move alongside Hall of Famers Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker. 

For me it was something very special because, tying your idols, isnt that great? he said. I think its every little boys dream. I made it come true today in a memorable final for me, and I have still got something left I think in my career. Hopefully I can beat those records. That will be even better. 

The Swiss is the first man to win his first six Grand Slam finals. 

Federer said playing Agassi at Flushing Meadow had made the final even more special. He is maybe one of the only living legends in tennis we still have, Federer said. 

To play him in this situation, him being towards the end of his career, me being on the top of my game, and getting the chance to play him on such an occasion, that was really special. Im amazed I could hang throughout the last few years with him. 

Agassi said Federer was the best of all. 

Federer, though, was more modest. The best player of this generation, yes, he said. But nowhere close to ever, because, just look at the records that some guys have and Im a little kooky. (Reuters)

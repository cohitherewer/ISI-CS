 Asia lose to Annikas team

Singapore: Annika Sorenstam ended another great season in style by captaining the International Team to a 16-8 victory over Asia in the inaugural Lexus Cup on Sunday. 

Leading 8-4 going into the final day and needing just four and a half points from the singles, American Erica Blasberg had the honour of putting the contest beyond doubt with a 3 and 2 win over Japans Riko Higashio in the ninth match. 

By then, Sorenstam, Paula Creamer, Natalie Gulbis and Karen Stupples had already done the business for their team at Tanah Merah Country Club in Singapore. 

Sorenstam led by example in the top match against Asian Team captain Grace Park. The world No. 1 lost the first hole but hit back with five birdies and not a single dropped shot in the 17 holes needed for a 2 and 1 victory. 

Its fantastic to have led the side to a first win, said Sorenstam, who claimed two and a half out of the three points. 

I think it is a great new meet that will continue to grow.

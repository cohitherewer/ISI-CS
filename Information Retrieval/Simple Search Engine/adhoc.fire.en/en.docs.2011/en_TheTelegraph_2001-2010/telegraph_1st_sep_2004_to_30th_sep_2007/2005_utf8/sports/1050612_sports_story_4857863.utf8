The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Be arrogant like the Aussies, says Gough

 - England fast bowlers tips on how to win the Ashes 

 Gough believes attitude is the key 

Southampton: Darren Gough has told his England teammates they must have the same arrogance as Australia if they are to win their first Ashes series in nearly 20 years later this season. 

Gough is still a member of Englands ODI squad. 

The 35-year-old pacer is in line for another crack at Australia when England take on Ricky Pontings team in Mondays Twenty20 game at Hampshires Rose Bowl ground. 

As long as our players have the same mentality as theirs and are as confident, and sometimes as arrogant, theres no reason why England cant do well in all forms of the game, said Gough. 

Even if you are getting smacked around, you still have got to have that belief. It only takes three balls. I had none for 60 when I took my hattrick (in the 1999 Sydney Ashes Test). 

England administrators have been accused of helping Australia by devising a schedule which delays the start of the Test series until July 21, with all the one-day Internationals ? including the tri-series also featuring Bangladesh ? taking place beforehand. 

But Gough, the first England bowler to take 200 ODI wickets, said: It makes me laugh when I hear people talk about England giving Australia practice here, practice there. Its nothing like it. Test match cricket is totally different. Youve got three slips, short-leg. 

England are second behind Australia in the Test rankings and for many of their current players, facing the men in baggy green caps is still a relatively new experience ? something Gough believes can work to their advantage. 

A lot of these guys have done well against other teams and now theyve got the chance to do well against the best team in the world. 

If they can win this series, they are made for life. They can be absolute heroes to us all, said Gough, who took 229 wickets at 28.39 apiece in 58 Tests. 

The players now are not too scarred. In the last few years of my (Test) career we had a lot of players who were doubting their ability before we went in there.

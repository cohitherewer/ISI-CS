 Woolmer questions Shoaib ?commitment?

 - Injured Pakistan fast bowler may miss tsunami fund-raiser at the MCG on Monday 

 Bob Woolmer 

Sydney: Pakistani paceman Shoaib Akhtar is in doubt for Monday?s all-star cricket fund-raiser for tsunami relief at the MCG after injuring his right leg and failing to bowl on the last day of the third Test against Australia. 

Shoaib?s commitment in the Test was disappointing, said Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer after Wednesday?s nine-wicket loss to Australia. 

The fast bowler?s availability for the charity match in Melbourne would depend on medical scans of his sore hamstring, he added. ?He?s complaining of a hamstring injury at the moment and he is having a scan tomorrow. We?ll see how fit he is after that,? Woolmer said. ?Certainly in this Test, he was a shadow of himself. 

?I have to say he was tired. I suppose, in a way, everyone was disappointed with his commitment.? 

Woolmer said the paceman couldn?t deliver because he?d exhausted himself by bowling too much off a long run up in the first two Tests. Woolmer said Shoaib bowled well when he took five-wicket hauls in an innings and troubled the Australian batsmen in each of the first two Test matches. 

Shoaib bowled 15 overs in short spells as Australia amassed 568 in its first innings in the third Test and didn?t take the new ball in the second innings, when Pakistan were defending 61-run lead. 

?I?ve said many times, that if you?re going to run that distance and try and bowl quick in this country, you?ve got to be triathlete fit,? Woolmer said. ?Either he shortens his run-up or he gets triathlete fit if he?s going to produce the performances he did four or five years ago.? 

Vision of Woolmer and Shoaib having an animated exchange before the Pakistanis went back into the field for the last session ? without their leading bowler ? was broadcast on Australian TV. 

Woolmer said he spoke one-on-one frequently with Shoaib, but didn?t want to delve into the topics of their conversations. (AP)

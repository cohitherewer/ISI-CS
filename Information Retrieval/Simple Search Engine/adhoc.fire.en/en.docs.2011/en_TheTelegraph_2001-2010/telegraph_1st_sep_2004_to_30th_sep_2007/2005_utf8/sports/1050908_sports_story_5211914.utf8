 Team Jordan to test new driver next week

 Move may put Narains future in jeopardy 

Silverstone: In their effort to identify the driver line-up for the 2006 season, Team Jordan on Wednesday announced it was roping in Bar Hondas Anthony Davidson as a test driver, fuelling speculation over the future of Indias Narain Karthikeyan with the team. 

Davidson, who currently fills up the third driver spot for Bar Honda, will test the Jordan Grand Prix (EJ15) car at the Silverstone circuit on September 13. 

As part of Midlands process of identifying its driver line-up in the 2006 Formula One World Championship, we are pleased to announce that British driver Anthony Davidson will test a Jordan Grand Prix car at Silverstone on September 13, Colin Kolles, managing director of Jordan Grand Prix, said. 

Analysts say that if Jordan are to dump one of their current drivers, it is more likely to be Karthikeyan than Tiago Montiero, thanks to his having completed just 11 of the 15 races this season compared to Montieros all 15 and languishing on position 17 in the Drivers Championship, three positions behind his teammate from Portugal. 

Were looking forward to working with Anthony during the test and to continuing discussions regarding a longer-term role into Midlands entry into the 2006 Formula One World Championship, Kolles said adding that Davidson definitely deserves an opportunity to race in Formula One. 

Im really looking forward to testing with the Jordan team next week and the EJ15 will certainly be an exciting new challenge, Davidson said. 

This test shows how serious I am about finding a race drive for next year and I would like to thank Bar Honda for allowing me to stand down from the teams Barcelona test and take up this opportunity, he added.

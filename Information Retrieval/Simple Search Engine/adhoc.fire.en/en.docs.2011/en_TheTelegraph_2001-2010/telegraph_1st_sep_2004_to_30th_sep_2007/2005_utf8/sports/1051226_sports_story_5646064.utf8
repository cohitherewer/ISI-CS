 Not spats, the game is all about silverware

 - Mourinho-Wenger melodrama will put even village pantomime to shame 

HENRY WINTER

 Jose Mourinho 

The ludicrous melodrama of Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger falling out over Christmas cards makes the village-hall pantomime look like a tragedy at Stratford. 

It was just as well they did not receive a card from Rafael Benitez. Liverpools stunning yuletide greeting features the European Cup underneath a sprig of mistletoe and draped in ribbons declaring the final 2005, Istanbul, enough to make Mourinho or Wenger choke on their turkey. 

Liverpools enduring obsession with the trophy they have won five times provides a timely reminder to everyone what football must always be about: a love affair with silverware. 

Its neither about money nor managerial spats that belong in the playground. Its about Steven Gerrard lifting the European Cup, planting a kiss on its elegant form, and even sharing his bed with it. 

Its about England players talking with genuine belief about next summers pursuit of the World Cup. A few are thrilled more by the ringing of the tills, or the effect on women caused by that ultimate bling, a World Cup winners medal, but the rest are driven by schoolboy dreams. 

As modest players never capable of realising the reverie of youth, Mourinho and Wenger seek fulfilment through management. However awkwardly or aggressively they articulate their ambition, the managers of Chelsea and Arsenal share a passion for trophies. 

The edge to Wenger, an otherwise civilised man, may soften when he finally grasps the European Cup. His Arsenal have delighted domestically, lifting Doubles and pulse-rates, but European glory has eluded them. What Wenger would give to be able to write a Christmas card which includes the greeting Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from the European Champions, as Liverpools does. 

Mourinho, who knows what it feels to be crowned champions of Europe, is a different animal to Wenger, far more calculating in his outbursts. The way for the authorities to handle Chelseas inspirational mentor is to avoid feeding his hunger for conspiracy theories. Invite him to assist with FA coaching courses. Seek his advice. Smother him with appreciation. Mourinho cannot play the worlds against us card if Planet Football expresses its admiration. 

Frustratingly, Mourinhos public image is now that of a rebel without a case, of a manager who picks unnecessary fights. Away from the cameras and notebooks, the Portuguese makes charming, intelligent company spiced with a healthy sense of humour. 

Encountered during a quiet moment at the Bridge recently, he talked at length about all manner of football issues and made sane points on most of them.

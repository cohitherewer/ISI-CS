 Zoysa back in squad

Colombo: Fast bowler Nuwan Zoysa has been recalled to Sri Lankas one-day squad for their seven-match tour of India starting later this month. Zoysa was omitted from the Sri Lanka squad that won a home series against Bangladesh in September but got his recall after proving his form and fitness with the A team. 

The 27-year-olds recall is at the expense of opener Avishka Gunawardene as the selectors adjusted the balance of the 15-man squad with the inclusion of another bowling option. 

Maravan Atapattu, named world ODI captain of the year at the annual ICC Awards this week, was re-appointed captain. 

Sri Lanka leave for India on October 20 for a split tour that includes seven ODIs between Oct. 25 and Nov. 12 followed by a three-match test series in December. 

Squad: Maravan Atapattu (captain), Mahela Jayawardene (vice-captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara (wicketkeeper), Tillekeratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Thilan Samaraweera, Chaminda Vaas, Upul Chandana, Farveez Maharoof, Russel Arnold, Dilhara Fernando, Muttiah Muralidharan, Dilhara Lokuhettige, Nuwan Zoysa.

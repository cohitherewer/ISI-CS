 Warne triggers SA collapse

 - Sixth 5-wkt haul for Brett Lee 

Perth: Shane Warne broke Dennis Lillees world record for the most wickets in a calendar year to trigger a South African batting collapse on Day II of the first Test on Saturday. 

Warne captured the wickets of AB de Villiers, Ashwell Prince and Mark Boucher to take his tally this year to 87 and restrict the Proteas to 296 in reply to Australias 258. 

Australia were 38 for one in their second innings at close, level with South Africa. 

Justin Langer was unbeaten on 15 with nightwatchman Brett Lee yet to score after Matthew Hayden threw his wicket away in the last over of the day. 

Hayden had raced to 20 before he skied an attempted pull shot off Charl Langeveldt that ended up in the gloves of wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 

Boucher also blazed 62 with the bat and shared a vital seventh wicket partnership of 77 with Shaun Pollock to ensure the South Africans led on the first innings after a middle order batting collapse. 

Warne bowled de Villiers for 68 to match Lillees record of 85 wickets in 1981, then trapped Prince leg before for 28 to set his own benchmark. 

Lee was also in devastating form, using his express pace to mop up the tail and finish with figures of five for 93, while Glenn McGrath and left-arm pacer Nathan Bracken collected one each.

 Kaneria looks forward to duel with Lara

Islamabad: Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria said Pakistan must take inspiration from their performance during the India tour to succeed in the upcoming series against the West Indies. 

Asking his teammates to be on guard against an unpredictable home side, Kaneria also said he was keenly awaiting a confrontation with Brian Lara. 

?We cant afford to take the West Indies lightly with Brian Lara in their line-up. They might have lost to South Africa, but with someone like Lara around, we have to be on guard since he has got that uncanny ability to change the complexion of the match,? Kaneria said. 

?But at the same time, we must remain focussed in our endeavour as we showed during the series in India where we were the underdogs.? 

Kaneria, the only bowler in the current squad with more than 100 Test wickets, said he was keen for Laras prized scalp in the two-match Test series that gets under way in Bridgetown from May 26. 

?I have never bowled to Lara in a Test match. Although now in the twilight of his career, he is still a magnificent player even at this stage,? Kaneria was quoted as saying in a local daily. 

Kaneria, who has 121 wickets to his credit in 26 Tests since his debut against England in Faisalabad in 2000-01, said he was extremely benefited from the series against India. 

?The experience of playing in India was electrifying and to do well against the Indians in their own conditions was very satisfying.? 

Kaneria was modest when told that he upstaged Shane Warne and Anil Kumble in Pakistans last two series in Australia and India, respectively. 

The leg-spinner took 15 wickets in Australia and 19 in India as against 14 scalps by Warne and 17 by Kumble in these two series. 

?I rate both Warne and Kumble very high in the list of leg-spinners. Compared to me, they are true legends. But I was naturally happy of the fact that I took more wickets than them,? he said. 

Kaneria picked Rahul Dravid, Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn as the best batsmen of spin bowling in the world. 

?Without any doubt they are the best batsmen I ever bowled to. All of them are master players of leg-spin.? 

Getting the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly stumped in the Bangalore Test was another highlight. 

?Ganguly was dropped by Younis Khan off my bowling shortly before I managed to deceive him with a leg-break that left him stranded.? (PTI)

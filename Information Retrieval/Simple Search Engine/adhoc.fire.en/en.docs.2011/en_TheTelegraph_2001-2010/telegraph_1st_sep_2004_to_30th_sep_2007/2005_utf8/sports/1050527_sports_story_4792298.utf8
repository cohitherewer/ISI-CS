 The collar episode

Chennai: Swashbuckling opener Virender Sehwag Thursday threw his weight behind Sourav Ganguly, saying the Team India captain will bounce back from his poor form and return from the English county stint as a stronger batsman. 

History and statistics say that such things happen to every batsman. Ganguly must be experiencing the same in recent times but I am sure that he will get back to his purple patch sooner than later, Sehwag said. 

It is good for everybody to play in county cricket. If you are not in form, it is a great opportunity to play in county cricket where you get to play lot of matches in one month, he added. 

On the episode (thus far kept under wraps) of former coach John Wright grabbing him up by his collar, Sehwag said he had no problem with the New Zealanders action. He was upset with me because I played a stupid shot, he said. It does not matter whether it was brotherly action or not but he was definitely angry with me and did what he thought at that time. Later we discussed it and we do not have any problem with that. We talked to each other and carried on after that. I do not have any problem. 

Sehwag brushed aside his own indifferent form in the one-dayers last season. Success comes and goes. I have not performed as well in one-day games. I am focussed on achieving my goal in the coming season. (PTI)

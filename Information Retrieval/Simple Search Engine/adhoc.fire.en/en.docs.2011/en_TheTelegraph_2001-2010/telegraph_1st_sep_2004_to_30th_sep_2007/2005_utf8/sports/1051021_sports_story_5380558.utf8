 King pins hopes on Brian Lara

Melbourne: A youthful but full-strength West Indies side arrived in Australia on Thursday to begin their three-Test tour against a team that appears to have recovered from the disappointment of losing the Ashes. 

The West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul can take heart from the fact that he will lead a full-strength side. 

While Brian Lara has returned to the squad, his failure against Australia while playing for the World XI must be of concern. 

He also totalled a measly five runs in the three one-dayers with scores of 0, 5 and 0, but coach Bennett King expects the 36-year-old to fire against Australia. 

Hopefully hes saving them (runs) all up for us against Australia, King told reporters after landing in Brisbane on Thursday. 

Hes one innings away from being the class player again that we all know that he is. 

King is confident his side can begin the long task of rebuilding the reputation of a team that was once the finest in world cricket. 

I think its more experience were probably lacking, King said. 

Eleven of the players are 25 and under. Theres only two that are over 30 and theyre our most experienced players. 

(But) the players to a man, theyre really dedicated and they work hard and Ive been really happy with the progressions that have been made to date. (REUTERS)

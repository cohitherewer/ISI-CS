The Telegraph - Calcutta

 April match may not come off

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: It?s not confirmed, but it?s highly unlikely that the second (officially-sanctioned) tsunami fund-raiser, between an International Cricket Council (ICC) XI and Asia, is going to be held at the Eden in April. 

It was earlier scheduled for February 13. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), which met in Dubai on Sunday-Monday, felt that the possibility of ?interference? from Nor?westers was high and a risk ought not to be taken with such a high-profile match. 

In any case, few have forgotten the 1996 World Cup opening ceremony fiasco at the Eden. The elements, it may be recalled, took centrestage then. 

Moreover, there could be a complication with the dates: Pakistan?s tour of India will end around April 10, Sri Lanka are going to be in New Zealand and (after another demanding season) the Australians will be readying for the blockbuster Ashes in England? 

Fund-raiser No.1, held at the MCG on January 10, raised over $ 11 million. It also saw the Sourav Ganguly-led Asia routed by the Ricky Ponting-captained ICC XI. 

While the fund-raisers are, in effect, a joint venture between the ICC and the ACC, the second match is the latter?s baby. 

Eventually (and quite predictably) the match came to the Eden after the Indian government suggested it be organised by a trust (ACC Tsunami Relief Trust) to ensure complete tax exemption. 

Actually, for much the same reason (the Nor?wester-factor), the match can?t be allotted to Dhaka. Then, it?s going to be very hot across the established centres in Pakistan. 

As a result, the match may well be shifted to Colombo ? possibly, even after April. Of course, this has just been talked about. 

Apparently, ACC president Jagmohan Dalmiya will ?brief? the ICC about the difficulties brought about by the unexpected postponement. 

Nobody is going on record, but many are convinced the Federation of International Cricketers? Association (Fica) had a ?significant hand? in that. 

Fica has always been cold-shouldered by Dalmiya and, among the Test nations in Asia, only the Sri Lankans have been favourably disposed towards it. 

That, perhaps, explains why Indians were ignored for the three fund-raising (unofficial, though) matches in New Zealand after the MCG sell-out. 

The World XI, one learns, was picked by Fica.

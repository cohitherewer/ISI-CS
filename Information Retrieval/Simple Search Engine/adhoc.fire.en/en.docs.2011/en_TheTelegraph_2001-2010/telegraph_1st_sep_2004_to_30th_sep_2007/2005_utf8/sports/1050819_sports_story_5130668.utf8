 SAI: Neelam skipped dope test

New Delhi: Discus thrower Neelam Jaswant Singh, who has been provisionally banned by the IAAF for testing positive at the World Championships, had skipped a test at the dope control centre here before she left for the meet. 

A top Sports Authority of India official said: We had intimated her to appear for a test, but she didnt turn up and left for the World Championships. 

In Helsinki, she tested positive for banned stimulant pemoline on August 7. She also became the first athlete to fail a drugs test at the meet. 

After her B sample also came back positive, the IAAF asked for an explanation before provisionally suspending her. 

Meanwhile, the Athletic Federation of India (AFI) has formed a panel to look into the doping charges against Neelam. 

AFI secretary general Lalit Bhanot, said that nothing would be made public before Neelam asks for a hearing. 

The federation has informed Neelam in writing about the panel but she has not contacted us in this regard, Bhanot said. 

The regulations forbid us to comment as the procedure requires complete secrecy. 

The panel, formed under the guidelines of the IAAF, will take at least two months to come up with its findings and will also suggest ways to prevent future such incidents .

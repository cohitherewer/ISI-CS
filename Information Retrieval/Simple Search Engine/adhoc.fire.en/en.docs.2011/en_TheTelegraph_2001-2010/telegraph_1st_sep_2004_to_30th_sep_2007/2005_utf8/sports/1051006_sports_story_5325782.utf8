 Bindra slams BCCI

Mohali: Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) president I.S. Bindra on Wednesday charged the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with not marketing the sport aggressively at the domestic level and being only interested in making big bucks. 

Bindra said his state association has shown that if there is will an event like the forthcoming Challenger Trophy too can become a hot event like one-day Internationals. He said the BCCI ignored promoting cricket at domestic level, which had a lot of potential. 

Bindra said unlike the PCA, which he claimed was being run in a thoroughly professional manner, the BCCI was being managed unprofessionally. 

Referring to the N.K.P.Salve Challenger Trophy limited overs series to be played in Mohali from October 10-13 between India Senior, India A and India B teams, the former BCCI chief said: We promise it will be as big an event as an ODI between India and Pakistan. 

We are very close to making as much money as PCA makes during an ODI when it is played here. Kingfisher Airlines are the title sponsors of the tournament, he concluded.

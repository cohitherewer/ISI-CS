 Mistake leaves Abhinn Shyam out

New Delhi: In reply to a glaring goof-up, the government announced that former national badminton champion Abhinn Shyam Gupta had been left out of the list of Arjuna awardees for the year 2004 but mistakenly. 

Abhinn Shyam was named on Wednesday as one of recipients of the award in a release issued by the Press Information Bureau which admitted that the shuttlers name had been omitted inadvertently. 

Abhinn Shyams name figured in the original list but it got omitted mistakenly while the press release was being prepared, sources in the PIB said. The list of awardees released to the media yesterday may be considered accordingly and the total number of awardees now stand at 15. 

However, what was surprising was that the PIB circulated the corrigendum late in the evening, almost a day after it had officially announced the names of the awardees. 

Former Davis Cup captain and a member of the Arjuna award selection panel Jaidip Mukerjea also confirmed Abhinn Shyam had been selected. 

His name was there... but I dont know why it did not figure in the PIB release yesterday, he said. (PTI)

 Fransa goalie, Musah suspended

Margao: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday suspended Fransa Pax goalkeeper Mark Mascarenhas and Mohammedan Sportings Suley Musah following a fracas during their match on Friday. 

The AIFF disciplinary committee, which met here, also imposed a fine of Rs 5000 on Mascarenhas for deliberately assaulting a player while Musah was served a show-cause notice. No timeframe has been set for the suspension. 

The committee also decided against giving further appointment to referee A. Arjunan for the remainder of the tournament. 

The incident occurred when Musah intentionally pushed Fransa Pax medio Peter Rodrigues during the match, triggering a commotion. Amid the chaos that followed, Mascarenhas was pushed by Zubair and in turn he retaliated with a blow. (Agencies)

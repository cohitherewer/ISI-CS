The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan up against ?desperate? Churchill 

Margao: If a police security is something unusual Mohun Bagan players are trying to cope up with in Goa, their challengers Churchill Brothers in Saturday?s National Football League will certainly be a dangerous proposition to deal with. 

Since the death of Cristiano Junior during the Dempo-Mohun Bagan final in the Federation Cup, the tension may have subsided quite a bit, but Subrata Bhattacharya?s side, which arrived here on Thursday, must be knowing that the Bangalore incident is still very much in the home crowd?s memory. 

With the policemen accompanying the green-and-maroon players in hotel and stadium, Bhattacharya admitted he had to tread the Goa-leg cautiously and judiciously. 

?We are prepared for it (the challenge) and will try to collect the maximum points from the two matches we play here, before going back to Calcutta,? he said. 

Churchill are yet to hit form in the competition, having lost to the other Calcutta teams East Bengal and Tollygunge Agragami. After the disappointment, they are now keen to return to a winning streak and coach Shabbir Ali hinted they would target the Bagan match for that. 

?It is another big game and my boys know the seriousness of it. We are desperate for a good start after two disappointing defeats. Our boys have learnt their mistakes and vowed to collect full points tomorrow,? Ali said on the match-eve.

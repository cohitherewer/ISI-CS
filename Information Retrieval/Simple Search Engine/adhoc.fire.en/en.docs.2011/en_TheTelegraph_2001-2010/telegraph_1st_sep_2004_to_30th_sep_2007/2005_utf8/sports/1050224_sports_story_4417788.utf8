Pune: Defending champion Devendra Joshi and Geet Sethi stormed into the quarter finals after registering their fourth wins from as many matches in the Asian billiards championship here Wednesday. 

Joshi overcame a shaky start to prevail over Myanmar?s Khin Mg Oo 3-1, while Sethi, who struck an unfinished break of 101 in the fourth game, beat S. Thawat of Thailand by the same margin. 

Pankaj Advani and Kyaw Oo of Myanmar from group B and Aung Sang Oo of Myanmar and C. Praput of Thailand from group C also sealed their places in the quarter finals. 

In the day?s best match, former IBSF world champion Praput rallied to a pulsating 3-2 win over Aung San Oo of Myanmar. The Thai romped to a 2-0 lead in quick time which included an unfinished break of 100 in the second game.

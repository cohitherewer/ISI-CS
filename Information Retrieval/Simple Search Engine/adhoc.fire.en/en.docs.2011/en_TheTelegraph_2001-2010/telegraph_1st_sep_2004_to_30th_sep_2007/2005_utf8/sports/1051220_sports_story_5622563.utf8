 Nayeem praise for Bhaichung

 - Indians back home after SAFF Cup conquest 

New Delhi: Keeping his differences with Bhaichung Bhutia aside, national football coach Syed Nayeemuddin on Monday showered praise on the Indian captain for playing a stellar role in the teams triumph in the SAFF Cup in Karachi last week. 

Bhaichung was a star performer for the side and was an inspiration for the whole squad, Nayeem, whose third stint with the national side began with the SAFF Cup success, told on his return to India. 

He was playing after a long injury-lay-off, which made him a bit over-anxious at times, but he worked hard to ensure that we returned home with the trophy, he said. 

When Bhaichung was asked about his relations with the coach, he avoided a direct answer. 

The victory was achieved with the hard work of the whole team under the guidance of the management and the coaching staff. It was a total team effort, the ace goal poacher said. 

Nayeem said the secret of the title triumph was the single-minded determination of the players who put in the hard work. 

We did not get enough time for preparation as the players were busy with their club assignments. Despite the limited time and resources, they prevailed over the other sides who had prepared for the SAFF Cup for a much longer duration under foreign coaches, the coach said. 

He said the Indian team needed to keep working hard to get to the next level in Asian football. Non-stop hard work is required for India to get to the level of South Korea and perhaps, make it to the World Cup finals some day. 

For that to happen, more money needs to come into the game, Nayeem said. Players need to be assured about their financial security so that they can concentrate fully on football, the coach, known as a strict disciplinarian, said. 

 Money is also needed for adopting to various modern training methods which are necessary for success in modern football, he added.

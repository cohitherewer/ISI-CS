 Easy victory for Rasalas 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Rasalas won the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes, the second Classic of the season, held on Wednesday. It was a handsome victory for three-year-old who went to the start as a 20-100 hot-favourite in a field of three runners.

 The Storm Trooper-Ruddles son ? a hard-puller ? was kept in an iron-grip by the visiting jockey B. Prakash while his stablemate, Imperial Dynasty, tried to cut a smart-pace after a slow jump-out.

 Prakash loosened up the hold on the favourite nearing the home-stretch and the race appeared to be over for all practical purposes. The final verdict he recorded over the second favourite, Raging Tide, was a yawning distance. 

 The afternoon, otherwise, belonged to jockey C.Alford who notched up a priced quadruple of wins. A double for trainer Vijay Singh apart, he also helped Javed Khan and Harvinder Singh Bath to lead in a winner apiece. Alfords winners were Knowledgeable, Alarico, Serrafina and River Rafter.

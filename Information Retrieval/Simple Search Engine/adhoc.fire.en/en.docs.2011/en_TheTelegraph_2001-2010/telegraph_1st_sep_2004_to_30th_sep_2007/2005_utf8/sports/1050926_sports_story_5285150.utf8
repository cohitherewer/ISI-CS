The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I played better than others: Myskina

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Sunfeast Open singles final was a cakewalk for Anastasia Myskina, as she defeated Karolina Sprem 6-2, 6-2. 

The win earned her 120 ranking points and is likely to catapult her into the top ten. 

It would really be nice if I can make it back into the top ten. I wish that happens, said Myskina at the press conference after the match. 

This being her first Tour title after Moscow last year, Myskina is extremely satisfied. 

Was the match as easy as the scoreline suggests? Not really, says Myskina. 

In the beginning of the second set, I got a bit nervous. Twice I lost serve. But then I broke her back and that decided the match. 

All the girls tried hard. I cant single anyone out. Its just that I played better. 

Later, Myskina, along with Elena Likhovtseva lifted the doubles crown, defeating Shikha and Neha Uberoi 6-1, 6-0. 

I enjoyed it both times, said Myskina. 

We were confident and it was very easy, added Likhovtseva. Fliderstadt and Moscow are the next halts for both players. 

Tennis apart, Myskina and Likovtseva had a great time shopping and sightseeing. And what did they shop for: Kurtas, tops, shoes, scarves and souvenirs, chorus both. 

How was Shikha and Nehas experience? Myskina and Likhovtseva played too well. We were absolutely baffled, said Shikha. 

The final proved that we still have a lot to learn, added Neha. Was this Shikhas best performanec to date? She definitely thinks so, but she is looking forward to doing even better.

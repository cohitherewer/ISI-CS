New York: Serena Williams overwhelmed Taiwanese teenager Chan Yung-Jan 6-1, 6-3 in the US Open first round on Monday. 

The 1999 and 2002 champions preparations have been hampered by problems with her left ankle and knee and she looked tentative on Arthur Ashe Court against her 16-year-old opponent. 

Williams, seeded eighth, appeared more troubled in the first set by the $40,000-worth of diamond earrings she was wearing than her injuries, disposing of them midway through it. 

The American trailed 1-3 after losing her serve with a double fault in the second set before reeling off the next five games and capping victory with a delicate backhand drop shot. 

I was playing really flat and lazy so I said, Ok Serena lets pick it up and play. I feel awesome. I feel I have no pressure, the Australian Open champion said. 

Serena, who could face older sister Venus in the fourth round, will next play Colombias Catalina Castano. 

Another early winner was Czech 16-year-old Nicole Vaidisova, seeded 26. She overcame compatriot Kveta Peschke 6-3, 6-1. 

Meanwhile in mens section, ninth seed Gaston Gaudio of Argentina suffered a shock first-round defeat, losing 6-7 (9-11), 2-6, 4-6 to American wild card Brian Baker, the world No. 195. 

The former French Open champion was well below his best and Baker took full advantage to record his first victory at a Grand Slam event and only the fourth win of his career. 

Once the 20-year-old Baker had taken the first set tie-break 11-9, Gaudio, who has won five titles this year, offered little resistance and the American eased to victory in two hours, 29 minutes. 

Baker will next play Belgian Xavier Malisse who defeated Czech Jan Hernych. 

Safin withdraws 

Fifth seed Marat Safin has withdrawn from the US Open because the knee injury which sidelined the Russian for seven weeks earlier this year is still troubling him. 

Safin, 25, admitted two weeks ago that he had returned to the tour against doctors advice to try to prepare for the US Open, one of his favourite events. 

Although Marat wanted more than anything to play and has tried whatever he could to be ready, as a professional tennis player he has had to admit his body is saying it is too soon, said a statement on Safins personal website.

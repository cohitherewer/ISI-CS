 Buchanan excited

Sydney: Australia will not want to surrender its unbeaten run in Test and one-day cricket against the Rest of the World XI in the Super Series later this year, coach John Buchanan said Monday. 

Buchanan said he was excited by the quality of players announced Monday to take on the Australian one-day and Test sides. 

The ICC World XI will take on world champions Australia in three one-dayers (October 5, 7 and 9) in Melbourne and a six-day Test in Sydney (October 14 to 19) which have been accorded official status. 

?Many of the players selected have great records against Australia and I am very excited about the prospect of having them all in the one team,? Buchanan said in a Cricket Australia statement. 

?It will be interesting to see how the players from very diverse backgrounds meld into a team, but on paper the names are impressive. 

?Australia are certainly going to have to play at their best but I am confident that the calibre of our guys is such that they will relish the opportunity to display their abilities against the best the world has to offer.?

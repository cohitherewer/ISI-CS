The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ive been picked to serve the team, not hit sixes: Dhoni

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Test rookies Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Rudra Pratap Singh unwind 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Today, 24-year-old Mahendra Singh Dhoni needs no introduction. Indeed, the first India cricketer from Jharkhand is being cheered in the same breath as Sachin Tendulkar ? its an achievement for somebody who hasnt yet made his Test debut. Dhoni, who will be making his Eden debut (in the India colours) on Friday, spoke to The Telegraph for around half an hour at the Taj Bengal on Thursday. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Almost a year into international cricket, do you wake up feeling different? 

A Well, yes? Im reminded of the expectations? That certainly is one change. 

So, you start the day under pressure? 

Thats a reality Ive accepted. What I try and do is to not add to the pressure. The more one thinks of it, the more its going to be. 

What have you learnt most in this period? 

Just what it takes to deliver at the highest level? The need to adapt (to different positions in the batting order)? Of course, theres lots left to learn. 

Last November, where did you expect to be 12 months later? 

I was only looking for a break and looking to make the most of the 2004-05 season? I didnt expect to perform the way I have. 

What has helped you deliver the way you have? 

Confidence? Also, that Im a good listener and keep interacting with the seniors on how to handle pressure. At this level, how a cricketer handles himself off the field is as important as his on-field performance. 

Is there one senior who has been guiding you? 

Nobody in particular? Im not choosy about who I listen to. As Ive said, Im a good listener? I assume its a nice quality to have. 

It must have helped that you started off against Bangladesh? 

I agree? I would have been under more pressure had my debut been versus Australia or Pakistan? They would have made me feel very unwelcome? Really turned it on. 

What hit you as the biggest difference between domestic and international cricket? 

Pressure? Besides that, the crowd factor? From playing in front of a few hundreds, one plays in front of thousands? Its a big test for newcomers. 

How many marks do you give yourself on ten? 

(Smiles) Between seven and eight? 

I suppose you favour a change in the conventional description of allrounders? 

Absolutely? Wicketkeepers, after all, are doing two jobs ? quite like batsmen who bowl or bowlers who can bat with a degree of proficiency. 

Seven months on, how do you look back on that 148 in Vizag (against Pakistan)? 

It may remain the most crucial innings of my career? I was still fairly inexperienced then? 

And the recent unbeaten 183 in Jaipur, versus Sri Lanka? 

Frankly, I didnt expect to play another Vizag-like innings in the same year? (After a pause) Because we were chasing almost 300 in Jaipur, I rate that knock higher. 

Unlike others, you dont dedicate a big performance to somebody? 

Dont know why, but thats the way I am. 

Youve not just changed the way Team India approaches ODIs, but have added to crickets entertainment value. Surely, the game is tough? 

Its serious business and one plays to win? Cricket seems easy when the going is easy. It becomes the toughest thing on earth when the going isnt good. A cricketer should be judged on how he handles himself when the ball rolls the other way. Thats when the character emerges. 

Will your batting be modified for Test cricket? 

Ive got to go by the situation? I can adapt and Im going to be guided by what the team wants. Ill continue to be positive, though, but fans must be reasonable and not expect a flurry of sixes. Ive been picked to serve the team, not hit sixes. 

Youre already being projected as somebody to watch out for in the 2007 World Cup. Whats your take? 

Right now, that tournament is far away? Im going to take each series as it comes? Focus on small goals? You could say it will be a brick-by-brick approach leading up to the World Cup. 

Is it tough keeping to Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh? 

Because of the bounce they get off the wicket, yes. 

Adam Gilchrist is your role model. But who got you hooked to cricket? 

Sachin. 

Did you speak to him on your first day with Team India (in Chittagong)? 

No? I kept looking at him? Observed every move? I spoke to him on the second day, at a dinner the team was invited to? Hearing him talk is itself an experience. 

How much has life changed in the past 11 months? 

Totally? The change took place after the Vizag innings? People started recognising me? It has changed even more after Jaipur? Now, people are even keeping track of whether Im heading for the saloon! 

Has Mahendra the person changed? 

I havent, but I cant allow everyone to have a piece of me? I cant, however, forget those whove known me from the time I was young? 

Whats it like being a superstar in Ranchi? 

(Laughs) I havent gone home after Jaipur and, so, I dont know how big a star Ive become? After Vizag itself, it had become difficult to move about at will. 

Youve bought a (600 cc) Yamaha bike youd set your eyes on. Is there something else at the top of your wish-list? 

Taking a ride in a fighter aircraft? Im keen on being airborne in a Sukhoi-30? Our (Media) manager is in the Air Force and he has promised to do the needful. In fact, he has promised a ride in a Mirage 2000 as well. 

Given the hectic schedule, are you able to keep a track of your favourite soccer team ? Manchester United? 

Were having day-night matches and, then, theres so much travelling? No. 

[Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry are Dhonis favourites. Wayne Rooney, too.] 

How do you relax on the eve of a match? 

By not thinking too much about whats coming up. Playing computer games on my laptop helps? The more calm I am, the better Im going to perform. 

Lastly, who will you be thankful to most when you make your Test debut at the Chepauk? 

God.

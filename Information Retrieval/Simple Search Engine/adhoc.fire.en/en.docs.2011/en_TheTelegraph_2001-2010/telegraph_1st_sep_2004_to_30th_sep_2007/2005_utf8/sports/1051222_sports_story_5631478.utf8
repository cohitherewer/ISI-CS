 Sharan packs off Kannan

New Delhi: Divij Sharan shocked sixth seed Vijay Kannan with a 6-4, 6-2 victory in the mens singles second round of the State Bank of Saurashtra National Grass Court Tennis Championships here on Wednesday. 

Sharan needed an hour and two minutes to oust the wily Tamil Nadu player and moved into the quarter finals of the Rs 8.36 lakh prize money event at the DSOI courts here. Vivek shokeen went down 3-6, 5-7 fighting against second seed Karan Rastogi. 

The local lad struggled to cope with the awkward bounce of the courts but found his rhythm late in the match before bowing out. (PTI)

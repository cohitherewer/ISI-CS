 Aizawl: T. Zoramthanga, the only Indian to win a medal in World Cup boxing championships, died this morning at Lunglei Civil Hospital due to hypertension, hospital sources said.

 Zoramthanga, 41, became the toast of the nation when he won the bronze medal at the Mumbai World Cup in 1990. Beginning his career in 1985, the Mizo won a gold medal at the Mizoram-Myanmar Border Champhai meet in the same year. 

 For the next seven years, he went on to win laurels in several national and international championships.

 London: Ellen MacArthur will be awarded a damehood, the female equivalent of a knighthood, for breaking the solo round-the-world sailing record, the British government said.

 ?Yannick Noah will help her to overcome her mental block in big matches, so she can one day win a Grand Slam,? a statement said on her web site. ?Roland Garros will be the first big objective of this new duo.? 

 Paris: Former player Laurent Fournier has replace sacked Vahid Halilhodzic as manager of Paris St Germain, the Ligue 1 club?s president Francis Graille said on Wednesday.

 Wellington: The 88th New Zealand Open will go ahead as planned on Thursday despite three greens being vandalised on the eve of the meet.

 have repaired the damage and it won?t have any effect on 

 the tournament,? Wall said.

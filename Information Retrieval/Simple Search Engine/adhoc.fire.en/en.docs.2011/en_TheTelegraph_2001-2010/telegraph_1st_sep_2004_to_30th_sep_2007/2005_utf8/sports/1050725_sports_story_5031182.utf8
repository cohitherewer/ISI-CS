 Vajpai: Capturing CAB not the aim

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Dinesh Vajpai Sunday insisted that his fight is issue based and not to capture the CAB. Match-fixing in local cricket will be one of the issues, according to him, who is contesting for the CAB presidents post against Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Addressing a press conference, Vajpai said: Cricket is no more a gentlemens game. Match-fixing in Indian cricket is a dark chapter in our life. However, when asked if he was hinting that some of the BCCI officials were also involved, the former Commissioner of Police and Director General of state police, didnt wish to commit himself. 

But he maintained that its difficult to prove whether a match has been fixed. But when one of the ruling party nominees admitted to it, it points to a different meaning. 

Vajpai was, it was learnt, refereeing to Saradindu Pal ? the ruling factions nominee for one of the two joint secretarys posts ? who reportedly has admitted to his role in match-fixing in local cricket. 

Dalmiya has rubbished the allegation, but Vajpai insisted match-fixing will be one of the issues on our agenda and well try to cash in on that. 

When asked why there was no full panel of contestants from their end in the elections, Vajpai said: Were not going to capture the CAB. Thats not our aim. Our focus is on certain issues. We also feel that everybody in the CAB is not bad, but a few are? and our protest and fight is against them. 

About Dalmiyas counter to his letter, Vajpai said: I still feel a batsman cant play the role of an umpire as well. As the CAB president, Dalmiya cant preside over the elections. Were just calling for a level-playing field.

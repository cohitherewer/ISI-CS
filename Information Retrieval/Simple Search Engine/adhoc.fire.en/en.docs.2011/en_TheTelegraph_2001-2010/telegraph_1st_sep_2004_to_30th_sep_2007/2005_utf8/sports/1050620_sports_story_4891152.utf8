 Sania: Im under no pressure

New Delhi: Sania Mirza says she is not pinning too much hope on her performance at the Wimbledon, where she would be playing for the first time at the senior level. 

Its my first Wimbledon and there are hopefully many more to come. I just want to go out there and give my best and give whatever I have. 

Its my third Grand Slam of the year and obviously there is no pressure on me to win so I just want to go out there and give my best in the first match, she told a TV channel. 

Sania said she was quite satisfied with her performance in the run up to the Grand Slam. 

Its pretty good, I had a good match the other day (in the tier-II meet in Eastbourne), just bad luck that I had five match points and just couldnt convert any one of them. 

But I am just coming back after an injury so Im feeling good. I like the grass and Im playing alright, hopefully things will work out at Wimbledon. 

Sania, ranked 72 in the world, is drawn to play Akiko Morigami of Japan in the first round of the event. I have been going there (Wimbledon) for the past four years. Ive been playing juniors, having won the junior doubles in 2003. (PTI)

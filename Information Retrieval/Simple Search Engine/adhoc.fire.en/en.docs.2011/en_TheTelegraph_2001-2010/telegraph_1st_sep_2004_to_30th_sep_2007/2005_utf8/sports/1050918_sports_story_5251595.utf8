 Harikrishna one-down in semi-final

Lausanne: World junior champion P. Harikrishna was outdone by top seed Grandmaster Andrei Volokitin of Ukraine in the first match of the two-game semi-final at Lausanne Young Masters International chess meet here on Saturday. 

With one down, Harikrishna faces a tall task of winning the return match in order to force a tiebreak. 

GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan was convincingly beaten by US champion Hikaru Nakamura in the other semi-final of the day.

 Season begins from Thursday 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Acceptances for the opening day of the season, on Thursday, were out after substantial delay, signifying that the RCTC may have struggled framing the six-event race card. 

 Monsoon season was originally scheduled to start last Friday but the shortage of rain had prompted the authorities to cancel the fixture, following trainers reluctance to enter their wards. Trainers had slowed down preparations of their runners in view of the track becoming hard in the absence of rain.

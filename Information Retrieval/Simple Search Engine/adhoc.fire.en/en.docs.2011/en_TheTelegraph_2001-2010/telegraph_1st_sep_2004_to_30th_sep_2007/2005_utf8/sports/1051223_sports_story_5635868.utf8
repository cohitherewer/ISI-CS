The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Azad back in familiar role

 - RS Krishnia set to be Team Indias security coordinator 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yashovardhan Azad 

Calcutta: The Union government has given Yashovardhan Azad a familiar role: To assess security arrangements by Pakistan for the forthcoming tour by Team India. The IGP, it may be recalled, headed the recce party before the last trip (2003-04) as also ahead of last Decembers tour of Bangladesh. 

Azad will be at the helm of a joint delegation of the government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). While Rajeev Sinha, a director in the ministry of home affairs and Ranbir Singh Krishnia (additional commissioner of police, New Delhi) are the other government nominees, the BCCI is to be represented by Prof. Ratnakar Shetty and G.S. Walia. 

Prof. Shetty is the executive secretary in-charge; Walia is the communications director-designate for the January 6-February 20 trip. The former, in fact, was part of the recce exercise in 2003-04 as well. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Krishnia is going to be Team Indias security coordinator during the tour. Its possible that somebody from the Indian High Commission, in Islamabad, could also travel with Rahul Dravid and Co. across the length and breadth of Pakistan. 

Unlike on the last trip, when India (then captained by Sourav Ganguly) only played a one-dayer in Karachi, that volatile port city is to stage one of the three Tests as also one of the five ODIs. Clearly, its bound to receive special attention. 

The Azad-led recce party leaves on Saturday and is to return on Wednesday. The tours formal clearance by the Union government is on hold till the security assessment is complete.

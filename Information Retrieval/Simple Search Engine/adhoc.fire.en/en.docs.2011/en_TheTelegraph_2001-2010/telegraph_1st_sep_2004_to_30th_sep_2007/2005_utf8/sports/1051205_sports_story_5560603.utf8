The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 In India you are judged only by ODI showing, laments Srinath

 - Former quick wonders why Zaheer is out of the side 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Srinath feels young pacers have a long way to go 

Chennai: The current crop of fast bowlers may have achieved success during the recently concluded one-day series versus Sri Lanka and South Africa, but Jawagal Srinath believes they still have a long way to go. 

The most successful and experienced among Indian pacers after Kapil Dev also isnt supportive of Team Indias decision to keep Zaheer Khan out of the side. 

A bowler is only complete once he achieves success in both the one-dayers and Test matches. You cannot evaluate anyone by his one-day performance. Unfortunately in India, you are judged only by your showing in the one-dayers, Srinath, who is here as part of the TV commentary team, told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

Irfan (Pathan) has been good and has improved steadily. He needs to keep working hard. Zaheer (Khan) is supposed to be the best, but he is out of the side. Ajit (Agarkar) has been bowling well. 

But two-three wickets in a one-day game is not a true reflection of your capabilities. In a one-dayer, you can bowl only in two spells. But the real challenge is when you have to bowl in three-four long spells in Tests. Your accuracy, your ability to maintain the same pace, your variation? all get exposed. 

In one-day games, the batsmen are more susceptible to mistakes because they go for their shots. In Test matches, you need to work hard on a batsmans weakness. A bowlers ability vis-?-vis a batsman gets exposed, the former India star explained. 

Srinath feels the fact that the Indians have picked up the nuances of reverse swing have worked to their advantage. The reverse swing bit came late to us. It was never the Indians forte unlike natural swing. Now everyone understands its advantages and has been quick to get used to the art. Bowlers have a good idea and its been of great help. In subcontinent conditions, you have to have a fair knowledge of reverse swing. 

Srinath feels things have changed somewhat since he started playing. It bodes well for Indian cricket that you have so many pacers to choose from. There are more options available to the team, more competition among the boys. 

How does he view Shoaib Akhtars terrific comeback in the series versus England? Shoaibs a matchwinner? Theres no doubt about that. The fact, however, remains that he has been inconsistent. Hes had injuries and other problems. But with his raw action hes bound to get injured. But hes definitely proved himself after being ignored for months. The Indians better watch out! 

Srinath agrees Chaminda Vaas remains highly underrated. This happens when you come from a team like Sri Lanka. He is the only fast bowler to have played for Sri Lanka for so long. And bowling along with Muttiah Muralidharan also has its disadvantages. 

The Bangalorean is effusive about Australian crickets infrastructure and Glenn McGraths ever-expanding career owes a lot to it. In Australian cricket, your longevity is proportionate to your success. The more successful you are, the longer you stay in the team. McGraths natural action, along with the support bowlers efforts, has added to his survival. 

 Shane Warne complementing his efforts, the batsmen making his task easier with flurry of runs have also been of great help. McGrath will stay for long? 

It was not the same with Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose. Both had injury free actions and that added to their lease of life, remarked Srinath. As for Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, they were just champion bowlers. 

Only if Srinath enjoyed such luxuries?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I want to be a mathematician: Ankush

A CORRESPONDENT

 Ankush Khandelwal

Calcutta: Unlike most players of his age, Ankush Khandelwal, the U-14 British Chess Champion, is clear about his future. He wants to pursue a career in mathematics. 

Chess for me is a passion, but I would like to be a mathematician when I grow up said the chess prodigy on the sidelines of The Telegraph schools Chess Championship. 

He nearly missed the tournament after arriving a round late and had to be content with a bye in the first round. 

For a late starter, Ankush has done remarkably well ever since he learnt the game in 2000 at the age of nine. 

He was taught the moves by a friend. We didnt have a board at home, neither did both us know anything about the game, said mother Indira, an occupational therapist and father Dr Puran Khandelwal who is an anaesthetist. 

Ankush has helped his Nottingham School for Boys team win the inter-school title in 2005. He is also a member of his school team in hockey and bridge. 

His first success came in 2001, when he came second in the county tournament as a 10-year old. 

In 2002, he was selected to represent England in the European Youth Union Chess Championship in the U-12 category. 

Thereafter I got my Fide rating in 2003, after which I took the game more seriously said Ankush. Though rated 1934, Ankush plays at the level of 2200. 

He is devoid of professional coaching, despite the fact that England is one of the top chess nations in the world. 

By virtue of his performance in the U-14 British Championship, Ankush has qualified for British Major next year.

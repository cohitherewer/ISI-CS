 Violence mars meet

New Delhi: Violent scenes marred Nehru Cup here on Friday with players of two leading teams resorting to stickwork of a different kind on the sidelines of the premier domestic hockey tournament at the Shivaji Stadium. 

The unsavoury incident, involving players of Namdhari XI and Indian Oil, resulted in international Deepak Thakur sustaining injuries on his hand, which needed treatment in a hospital. 

The stick-fight broke out when Namdhari XI players, after losing their semi-final match to Indian Airlines, went into the warm-up area, where Indian Oil players were preparing for their semi-final clash against Punjab and Sind Bank. 

It is believed the fight centred around Deedar Singh who has recently switched over to Indian Oil from Namdhari. 

The situation threatened to turn more violent but was controlled by police, which landed on the spot immediately. 

Thakur, who tried to pacify the agitated players, got injured in the process. (PTI)

 Marion?s season debut tomorrow

 Jones is slated to run the 400m

Walnut (US): Former Olympic champion Marion Jones is ready to run her first race since failing to win a medal in Athens last August. 

Jones, who won three gold and two bronze medals at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, is slated to run the 400m at the Mt San Antonio college relays on Sunday. 

She traditionally has used the meet at the community college near Los Angeles as her season-opener. While Jones is a sprinter and long-jumper, she occasionally runs the 400 for training purposes. 

The International Olympic Committee has been looking into allegations that Jones used performance-enhancing drugs. She has never tested positive and has consistently denied using any such drugs. 

She has filed a $25 million defamation suit against Victor Conte, alleging the head of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative tarnished her reputation when he claimed she used drugs before and after the 2000 Olympics. 

Conte is one of four men charged with participation in an alleged steroid-distribution ring. (AP)

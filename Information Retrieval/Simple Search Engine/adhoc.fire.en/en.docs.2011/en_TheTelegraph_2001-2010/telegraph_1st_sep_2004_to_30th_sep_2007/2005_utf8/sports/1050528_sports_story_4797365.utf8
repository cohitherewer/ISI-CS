Calcutta: After having produced a brilliant performance to secure a berth in the premier division of the tenth National Football League (NFL), Mohammedan Sporting players and coach Biswajit Bhattacharya got a heros welcome on Friday. 

As soon as they appeared at the club tent for the felicitation ceremony arranged by the club officials, they were mobbed by hundreds of fans, who had eagerly waiting for the players arrival for long. 

All the eminent guests on the dais ? which included Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, Mahindra United coach Syed Nayemuddin, former footballer Prasun Banerjee among others ? pledged for unity among the states clubs for survival. We ? East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting ? have to stand united to fight against Goan outfits, was the common refrain. 

Mohammedan Sporting secretary Sultan Ahmed, in the midst of all this, made the most important announcement offering coach Biswajit a three-year contract. He himself gave away a sum of Rs 2.5 lakh to the players and coach. He also informed that former city mayor Prasanta Chatterjee has given Rs 10 lakh for renovation of the stands at the club ground. 

I am happy with the way the club officials and players helped and supported me during our campaign, Biswajit said. 

Biswajit, who had earlier coached Calcutta Port Trust in the local Super Division, will take tips from the seasoned coaches going into the tenth edition of the NFL. 

Dutta asked Biswajit not to get carried away by the success, but aim at keeping the good run going. Playing in the Super Division and then performing at the national level against top teams will completely be a different ball game. For that the players need proper training to keep the good run going, Dutta said. 

Bhowmick, Nayeem and Prasun Banerjee felt that Mohammedan Sportings comeback in the top tier of the NFL will ensure Bengals domination in the Indian football.

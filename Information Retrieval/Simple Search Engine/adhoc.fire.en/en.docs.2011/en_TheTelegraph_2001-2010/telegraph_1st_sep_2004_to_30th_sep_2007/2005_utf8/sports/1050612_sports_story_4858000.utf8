I dont know whom Im going to replace, but I do know Im playing at Lords, Sourav told The Telegraph on Saturday evening, shortly after reaching London from Cardiff. 

That Sourav had been approached by the MCC (to be Ramnaresh Sarwans replacement, owing to uncertainty over his travel plans) was reported in these columns on Saturday.

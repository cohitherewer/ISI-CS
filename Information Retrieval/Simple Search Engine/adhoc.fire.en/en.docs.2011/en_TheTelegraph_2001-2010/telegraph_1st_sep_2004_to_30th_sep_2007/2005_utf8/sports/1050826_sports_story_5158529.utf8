 Flintoff excited about playing with Sachin

London: Flamboyant England allrounder Andrew Flintoff says he is excited about playing for World XI and the chance of batting with greats like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara in the Super Series against Australia. 

Im really chuffed about the World XI. It gives me the chance to share a dressing room with some of the best players in the world. I could even get a chance to bat with Sachin Tendulkar, though Ill probably be wetting myself in case I run him out, Flintoff said in an interview to the Daily Telegraph. 

Flintoff recalled his growing up days when he idolised Tendulkar. 

I remember when Tendulkar scored his first fifty in England. I was 14 and coming back from buying a new bat with dad. Now Im in a team with people like him and Lara. I just dont see myself as one of them, its like Im the mascot or something. 

Talking of his enormous influence on the ashes, Flintoff said, I feel I do have an influence in the dressing room. Its an environment I feel comfortable in, though at Lords I was probably a bit tense. 

Because Id not played against Australia before, I placed too much emphasis on that first match. Since then, Ive decided to relax and treat it as another game of cricket and it has gone well with both bat and ball in the same match. Although thats rare, its what allrounders strive for. Hopefully, Ill keep it going for another few weeks yet.

 Dungarpur?s views

New Delhi: Former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur on Monday said there must be ?political pressure? on Pakistan Cricket Board for not wanting to play in Ahmedabad and India should consider its request for a change in venue. 

?If they are uncomfortable about playing in Ahmedabad, there must be some political pressure. 

?I don?t know why such a hue and cry is being made over the matter. There is no dearth of grounds in India and the match can be played anywhere,? he said. 

He said India had reservations over playing in Peshawar and Karachi during last year?s tour of Pakistan, but the PCB did not make an issue out of it. 

?We cited security problems and asked for a change in peshawar as a Test match venue and they accepted our proposal without any hesitation. So now when they are requesting a change, we should take it into consideration. After all we all know what happened in Ahmedabad,? he said. (PTI)

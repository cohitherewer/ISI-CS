 Ex-BCCI secretary drops a bombshell

 Vadodara: Former BCCI secretary 

 Jaywant Lele finds himself at the centre of yet another 

 controversy, this time regarding the visit of underworld 

 don Dawood Ibrahim to the Indian players dressing 

 room during a one-day match in Sharjah in 1987. 

Lele, who was quoted by Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna on Sunday as saying that Dawood had visited the dressing room and had offered a Toyota car to each player if they won the match, said on Tuesday that the international criminal was introduced to them then as an industrialist. 

After the Mumbai blasts in 1993, I and other members of the team came to know about his real identity, Lele said, adding that nobody had received any money from him. 

The former secretary, who famously predicted in 1999 that Sachin Tendulkars India would lost 0-3 to Australia Down Under, also rejected the charge that some members of the Indian team were involved into match-fixing. 

He, however, did not rule out betting on individuals performance. 

 Lele further said that he was opposed to the decision 

 of imposing life ban on former captain Mohammed Azharuddin 

 and Ajay Jadeja, saying no charges of fixing were 

 proved against both the players.

 Flintoff, Pietersen hold the key:Younis

 - ENGLAND IN PAKISTAN 

 Younis feels the English duo plays spin well 

Karachi: Pakistan must concentrate on controlling Englands Ashes heroes Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen in the forthcoming series, vice-captain Younis Khan said on Saturday. 

We cant let them get away. Because they are match-winners and play the spinners well, they will hold the key to the series in Pakistan and India, he said. 

They are a destructive pair and can turn a match around with their positive approach. They made the difference in the Ashes series. 

Pietersen, in his debut Test series, was Englands top-scorer with 473 runs in five Tests while Flintoff dominated with bat and ball, scoring 402 runs and taking 24 wickets. 

England will tour Pakistan from October 26 to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals. They will tour India later in the season. Younis, who has scored four hundreds in Pakistans last eight Tests, said Pakistan faced a tough series against England. 

They have just beaten Australia and any side which has done even reasonably well against Australia in recent times has gone on to perform in their next series, he said. India beat us last year after doing well in Australia and we had a good time in India after our tour to Australia. Englands confidence will be sky-high and they will fancy their chances of double success in the sub-continent. 

Meanwhile, Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney has stressed on the importance of picking the right characters to supplement the team, adds a report from London. 

People have said the success of your touring party comes largely down to the quality of your back-up players and there is some logic to that, said Graveney. 

You can have problems with illnesses just on the morning of the game. So the choice of back-up players are people who are comfortable, if you can say that, playing at a short moments notice. 

All 12 who represented England in the Ashes are set to be named in the touring party on Monday alongside four other players, whose roles on the trip may be minimal. 

That quartet will be made up of an understudy to wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, a second spinner, at least one fast bowler and possibly an additional top-order batsman. 

There are plenty of players vying for a spot ? a 17th name could be announced to stand by should Simon Jones need surgery on his ankle injury ? and temperament is viewed at the same level as ability by the current management. 

One of the biggest points of debate is who will be sent as reserve gloveman with Nottinghamshires Chris Read and Essex man James Foster ? both of whom have Test experience ? facing the challenge of sussex batsman-cum-wicketkeeper Matt Prior. 

Ironically, while Read is viewed as the best in the country behind the stumps, his 2005 first-class batting average is also far superior to his rivals. 

Read, 27, originally lost his place due to coach Duncan Fletchers preference for a batsman who could keep, rather than a keeper who could bat. 

The fitness of Jones ? which will not be known for at least a week ? has complicated the issue as to whether the squad opts for spin or pace. 

Gareth Batty has been spinner Ashley Giles deputy in recent times but he has endured a barren summer for Worcestershire while Gary Keedy, Monty Panesar, Graeme Swann and Alex Loudon may also enter the spin equation. 

Simon Jones fitness report is relevant to that decision, Graveney added. 

The current situation is that he is resting for a fortnight and well have a closer idea what the implications are then.

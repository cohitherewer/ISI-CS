 Dravid, Sehwag move up 

Dubai: Spin wizard Shane Warne returned to the top of the Test bowling rankings for the first time in 10 years, riding on his five-wicket haul in the first Test against the West Indies in Brisbane. 

Among batsmen, the Indian duo of Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag gained a spot each to reach number three and four, respectively, in the latest ICC rankings. 

Jacques Kallis stayed atop the batting charts, ahead of Australian skipper Ricky Ponting who scored a century in each innings at Brisbane. 

Irfan Pathan was the highest ranked Indian bowler at number 10. 

Apart from Warne overtaking McGrath on the top of the charts, there was no other change in the bowling rankings, with Muttiah Muralidharan, Andrew Flintoff and Shaun Pollock rounding off the top five. 

Meanwhile, four defeats in a row to India cost Sri Lanka heavily as they slid to number four in the latest one-day International rankings. 

India remained at the seventh place. Nevertheless, Indian batsmen moved up the individual rankings. 

Dravid climbed 17 places to move to the seventh spot in the batting list. Sachin Tendulkar was not far behind, moving back into the top ten at number nine. Among the bowlers, Harbhajan Singh climbed 10 places to 11th. 

Meanwhile, South Africas 4-0 series win over New Zealand lifted them to second place in the ICC ODI rankings, within 16 points of leaders Australia. (PTI)

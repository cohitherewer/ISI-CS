The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav cautiously optimistic

 Sourav defended three-pacer composition

Chandigarh: Sourav Ganguly is cautiously optimistic. He is not committing himself by saying that India will win on the final day, but the glint of hope has brought that feeling of satisfaction back on his face. 

?Let?s see how it goes? We have a good chance, but can?t say anything now? Let?s see how the first hour goes tomorrow,? Sourav told The Telegraph, on the dressing room balcony after stumps on the fourth day. 

The Team India captain was all praise for Danish Kaneria who took six wickets in the first innings. ?He seems a natural leg-spinner? Gets more nip off the pitch. I think he is bowling better than Shane Warne at this moment on Indian pitches? He is young, has age on his side and should mature.? 

Sourav felt that the pitch has dried out and that it is now helping the spinners. ?I would have still gone in with three pacers since you couldn?t have bowled with two spinners on the opening day. The ball was then really moving and it was good for the fast bowlers. Now the bounce has settled down,? he explained. 

The Inzamam-ul-Haq dismissal on Friday did raise quite a flutter in Mohali. Doubts are being raised about the leg-before decision against the Pakistan captain on 86 since he was well stretched forward. The Indian camp, however, has no such reservations. 

?He was definitely out? The ball beat the bat and then stuck on the pad? No question about it,? said a senior player. 

The Pakistanis are not satisfied with the Taufeeq Umar decision either. They felt the ball had come off the pads but here, too, the Indians are convinced there was a thick inside edge on to the pads before Lakshmipathy Balaji took the caught and bowled chance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tragedy strikes Lloyd family 

 - Icons son Jason may be called for trials by Warwicks 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Chennai: The iconic Clive Lloyd, International Cricket Council (ICC)-appointed Match Referee for the three-Test series against Sri Lanka, couldnt arrive before Friday (scheduled first day of Test No. 1) morning owing to a bereavement in the family. 

Lloyds only daughter Samantha lost her first child ? born prematurely in a London hospital ? the other day and the former West Indies captain couldnt leave till shed recovered somewhat. 

The past few days have been particularly traumatic for Samantha and her husband (Andy Denyer, who works for Paramount)... They got married in June and we were all excited about her being in the family way... God willed something else, Lloyd told The Telegraph emotionally. 

Rain from late Thursday night meant even the toss was ruled out. However, had the elements not interfered, that ritual would have been supervised by on-field umpires Daryl Harper (who chaired the pre-series meeting of captains and officials) and Mark Benson. Lloyd, after all, couldnt have reached the Chepauk before 9.00 am. 

He arrived from London via Dubai. 

Incidentally, Lloyds son Jason has grown as tall as 610 and is doing well as a right-arm speedster. He can bat decently, too, Lloyd (a left-hander, by the way) pointed out with some pride. 

Lloyd informed that the 24-year-old is likely to be called for trials by a couple of Counties ? Warwickshire being one of them. Now 61, he himself served Lancashire, for many years, with distinction. 

Im hopeful Jason will make it to one of the Counties, Lloyd said.

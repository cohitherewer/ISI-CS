 Ponting bat still on sticky wicket

London: The ICC said it was yet to clear Ricky Ponting?s newly designed cricket bat though temporary permission was given to the Australian skipper to use it. 

Dismissing reports that the bat has been given clearance, the ICC said Ponting could use the bat pending the advice of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the ICC cricket committee, chaired by Sunil Gavaskar. 

The ICC, in a release, said the matter would be raised at its cricket committee meeting on May 16 and 17 in Dubai. 

The MCC is concerned that Ponting?s bat has been strengthened by a thin strip of carbon graphite. In a letter to the manufacturer of the bat, the ICC had advised: ?As you are aware, MCC has been considering the issue of whether your reinforced bats comply with laws 6.1 and 6.2. 

?The ICC has determined that, pending the completion of this review, it will allow the bats to be used in international cricket,? ICC said in the release. 

Gillespie?s views 

Meanwhile, Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie feels all the fuss about Ponting?s bat was because the Ashes series was round the corner, adds a report from Jaipur. 

?The fact is that he is making a lot of runs on all surfaces and these talks about the bat have come due to his success and also because the Ashes is on cards,? Gillespie said. (PTI)

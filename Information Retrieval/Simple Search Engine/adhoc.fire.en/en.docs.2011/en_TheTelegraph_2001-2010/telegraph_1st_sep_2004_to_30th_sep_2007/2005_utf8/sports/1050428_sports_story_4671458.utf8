The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We have to be on toes: Paes

 - DAVIS CUP - Bhupathi feels Uzbeks can be tough customers 

Jaipur: India may be stronger on paper but may face tough opposition from Uzbekistan in the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group I second-round tie, according to doubles ace Mahesh Bhupathi. 

?We may appear better on paper but the youngsters from Uzbekistan can be tough customers,? Bhupathi said before the team?s practice session on Wednesday. 

Bhupathi, who made his Cup debut at the Jai Club grasscourts here 11 years ago, will be playing the doubles rubber with Leander Paes. 

The captain agreed with Bhupathi?s assessment of the rivals. ?These people are tough characters. They come from such a part of the world that hard work is way of life for them. We have to be on our toes to beat them,? said Paes, who won back-to-back doubles titles (Monte Carlo and Barcelona) with Nenad Zimonjic the last two weeks. 

?They are tough and keeping in view the hot conditions, we have to conserve our energy. They are strong and can sap our energy if they get into a groove,? Paes added. 

Paes expressed surprise that their captain Vadim Kutsenko, who has played several tournaments in India including Jaipur, was not playing singles. 

?I thought he was too good a player,? Paes said. ?I have never played against Uzbeks but the rest of our team members have. They have had some mixed results but we have to start afresh.? 

Paes was happy with his form and fitness. ?I was unfortunate to have twisted my ankle in Australia in January but have recovered fully and got back my rhythm. 

?The recent tournaments were like a physical test and my ankle and body stood well to it. Enough match practice has given me the confidence back as well.? 

Paes felt unseasonal rains in the past few days may have made the courts softer which could result in low bounce. ?It will be to our advantage,? said Paes. ?These courts have always been to my advantage.? 

The Uzbeks, on the other hand, are confident of giving India a run for their money, especially in the singles matches.

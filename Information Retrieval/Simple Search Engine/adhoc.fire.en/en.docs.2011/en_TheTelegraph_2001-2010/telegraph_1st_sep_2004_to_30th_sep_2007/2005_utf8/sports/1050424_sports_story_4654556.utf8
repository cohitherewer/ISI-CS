Bridgetown: South Africa continued to plunder the inept West Indies bowling and reached 335 for two at lunch on the third day of the third Test here on Saturday. 

At lunch, opener AB de Villiers was undefeated on 155 and Jacques Kallis was batting on nought. 

The Proteas now have a lead of 39 over the Windies? first innings total of 296. 

Just before the interval, the hosts made a breakthrough when Boeta Dippenaar was run out for 71, falling to substitute fielder Dwayne Smith?s direct hit at the bowler?s end from short fine leg. 

Dippenaar hit half a dozen fours and one six from 158 balls, and added 143 for the second wicket with De Villiers. 

Dippenaar and De Villiers, who took 40 minutes and 22 balls to get off the mark, were unflappable and batted through for all but the last three minutes of the morning session. 

West Indies bowler Dwayne Bravo left the field holding a towel to his face after being struck by a ball driven into the covers by Dippenaar. 

Bravo, who fielded in sunglasses, sustained a minor cut above his left eyebrow but did not need stitches. 

South Africa lead the four-test series 1-0, after winning the second Test by eight wickets. 

The first Test at Georgetown was drawn, and the fourth and final Test at St John?s, begins April 29.

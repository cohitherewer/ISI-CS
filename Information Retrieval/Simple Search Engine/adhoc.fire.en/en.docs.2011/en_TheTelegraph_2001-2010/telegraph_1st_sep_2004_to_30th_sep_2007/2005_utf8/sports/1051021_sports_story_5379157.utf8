 London: Colombian rider Maria-Luisa Calle has regained the bronze medal she lost at last year?s Athens Olympics after testing positive for a banned stimulant. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Thursday overturned the International Olympic Committee?s decision to strip her of the Women?s Points Race medal because she had not ingested the substance.

 ?The presence of heptaminol in Calle?s urine sample was not due to her having ingested that substance but was the result of the ingestion of neo-saldina containing isometheptene, which transforms into heptaminol during laboratory tests,? CAS said. 

 Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt?s attempt to show fans his softer side in a documentary has ended up with the world?s No.4 player facing legal action in Australia brought by his former best friend. Hewitt has included footage of himself and Australian rules football player Andrew McLeod visiting aboriginal sacred sites together last year in a DVD entitled ?Lleyton Hewitt: The Other Side?.

 But lawyers for McLeod told the federal court in Melbourne on Thursday that Hewitt had not sought his permission or that of traditional landowners in the Kakadu region before including culturally sensitive footage. 

 New York: Michael Jordan admitted being ?stupid? in his gambling, but claimed he never jeopardised his livelihood or his family, during an interview to be televised in CBS on Sunday.

 ?Yeah, I?ve gotten myself into (gambling) situations where I would not walk away and I?ve pushed the envelope. It?s very embarrassing... One of the things you totally regret. So you look at yourself in the mirror and say, ?I was stupid,?? he explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Easy for Orissa

Calcutta: Shiv Sundar Das survived the umpire?s finger once but still failed to record his second consecutive hundred in the East Zone national one-day meet as Orissa cantered to a eight-wicket victory against Assam on Monday. 

The four points put Orissa on top of the pool with 13 from three games. They are now assured of making the main round. Bengal have 12 from as many matches and the two sides meet Tuesday. 

Das was declared leg before on 85 off Sukhwinder Singh, but umpire N.R.S. Prabhu soon recalled him as the former India opener made his displeasure known. ?I realised my decision was wrong as it was a case of bat-and-pad,? said Prabhu later. 

Das, however, could hardly capitalise on it and was dismissed for 91 (90 balls, 15x4). Put into bat, Assam were reduced to 105 for six in the 29th over but still managed to reach 218, thanks largely to a 85-run stand between Sukhwinder and Subhadeep Ghosh. Sukhwinder hit 49 off 65 balls (5x4, 1x6), but it was Ghosh?s strokeful innings which helped Assam recover. The last ten overs yielded 80 runs. 

Ghosh?s unbeaten 59 off 79 balls included two boundaries and two sixes. There were some superbly timed strokes on both sides of the wicket. 

Orissa also had a horrendous start with B.B.C.C. Mahapatra being dismissed in the second ball of the innings. But Das and Subit Biswal ensured there were no further hiccups with a 144-run partnership for the second wicket. Biswal was unbeaten on 90 (138 balls, 7x4, 1x6). 

Das was troubled by the left-arm spin of Sukhwinder, but otherwise looked in fine nick. But it was Biswal?s knock that was the most impressive. A member of the state under-22 side, Biswal ? who was included because Rashmi Ranjan Parida failed to recover from a twisted ankle ? showed lots of promise during his stay at the wicket. 

 Jharkhand win 

Unbeaten knocks from Rajeev Kumar (45) and Sumeet Panda (39) helped Jharkhand beat Tripura by six wickets at the Jadavpur University campus ground at Salt Lake. Jharkhand now have six points from three matches and will meet Assam Tuesday. 

Electing to bat after the match was reduced to 47 overs-a-side because of a fog-induced delayed start, Tripura rode R. Prasanna?s 43 to 192 for eight. Jharkhand medium-pacer S.S. Rao utilised the conditions well to return the most successful bowler with four wickets. In reply, Jharkhand reached the target in 41 overs. M. Vardhan scored 60.

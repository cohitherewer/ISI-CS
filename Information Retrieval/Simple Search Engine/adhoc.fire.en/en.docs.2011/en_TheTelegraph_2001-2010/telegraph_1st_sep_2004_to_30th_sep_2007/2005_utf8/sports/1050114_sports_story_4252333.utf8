 Agassi doubtful after injuring hip

Melbourne: Andre Agassi?s Australian Open plans are in doubt after he pulled out of his Kooyong Classic match against Andy Roddick Thursday with a hip injury. ?It?s a mighty big spectrum of possibilities right now,? Agassi said after he retired with Roddick leading 6-5 in the first set at the exhibition tournament. 

Agassi said he felt tightness in the muscle at the front of his right hip and would have an MRI scan to determine the damage. 

The four-time Australian Open champion said the outcome of those scans and how he felt over the next four days would determine whether he takes take his place at Melbourne Park. 

?The good news is that it didn?t just tear, it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself, which is hopefully more of the issue,? said Agassi. 

?That wasn?t comfortable out there today at all, what I was feeling. I have to wait and see what I?m dealing with ? it?s a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesn?t feel right and is getting worse. 

?It?s very disappointing and I?ll have to do my best to deal with it. Time will shortly tell if (the Australian Open) is a possibility or not. I was not counting on this being the end of the day for me. Maybe in a few days I?ll have a much better sense of what my hopes will be.? 

Meanwhile, Mark Philippoussis officially withdrew from the Open with an adductor muscle injury, organisers said. The one-time Wimbledon and US Open finalist suffered the injury playing for Australia in the Hopman Cup in Perth earlier this month.

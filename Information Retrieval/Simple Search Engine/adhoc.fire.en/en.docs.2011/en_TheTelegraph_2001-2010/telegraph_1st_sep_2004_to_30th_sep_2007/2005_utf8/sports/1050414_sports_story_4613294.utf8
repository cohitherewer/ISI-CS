Wellington: Lou Vincent blasted a double-century to put New Zealand in complete control of the second and final Test against Sri Lanka in Wellington on Wednesday. 

Vincent smashed 224, the seventh highest score by a New Zealander in Tests and more than double his previous best, to help the Black Caps amass a daunting total of 522 for nine declared. 

That left New Zealand with a first innings lead of 311 after they had skittled the tourists for just 211 on the opening day. 

Sri Lanka wiped 10 runs off the deficit before bad light ended play early at the Basin Reserve, but suffered a major setback when they lost opener Sanath Jayasuriya late on the third day. 

Jayasuriya departed for two in the third over of the innings when Chris Martin found the edge and Vincent took a sharp catch at third slip. 

Captain Maravan Atapattu survived seven tricky overs to reach the close unbeaten on five with nightwatchman Farveez Mahroof on one, leaving the tourists facing an uphill task to save the match. 

Vincent batted nearly nine hours and faced 348 balls in a marathon innings that featured 25 boundaries and four sixes. 

He started the day on 79 and crawled to 93 at lunch after rain washed out most of the morning session. When play resumed after the interval, he carefully brought up his third Test hundred off 223 balls then suddenly accelerated, blasting 101 between lunch and tea. 

He had a lucky escape on 193 when he was dropped in the deep by Jayasuriya but kept his cool to smack Upul Chandana to the boundary rope to raise his double-century off 339 deliveries, raising his bat in triumph. 

Vincent became the 10th New Zealander to score a Test double-hundred before notching another 24 to climb to seventh place on the all-time list before he was run out. 

Vincent scored a century on debut against Australia in December 2001 but passed triple figures just once more, against India in 2003, and was dropped for over a year before fighting his way back this summer. 

?The hundred against Australia was more emotional but I guess this will stick in the mind,? he said. ?This was meaningful for me because it?s 14 months since my last hundred for New Zealand ... I was really focused to get 100.? 

Vincent also shared in a series of vital partnerships that kept the New Zealand total ticking along including a 141-run stand with his skipper Stephen Fleming, who missed his hundred by 12 runs. 

The Black Caps had resumed on 253 for four and Fleming signalled their intentions early when he pulled Mahroof over mid-wicket for six in the first over, with the ball trickling down a drain and needing replacing. 

Fleming survived a confident caught-behind appeal on 69, but his luck ran out on 88 when he skied Chaminda Vaas to Shantha Kalavitigoda, ending a 211-minute, 176-ball innings that included 11 fours and a six. 

Vaas dismissed Brendon McCullum for a golden duck for his sixth wicket of the innings but any hopes of a Lankan comeback were immediately snuffed out by Vincent, who featured in three successive record partnerships. 

He shared a 48-run stand with James Franklin for the seventh wicket, a 98-run partnership with Kyle Mills for the eighth, then a 59-run stand with Paul Wiseman for the ninth wicket before being dismissed himself. (REUTERS)

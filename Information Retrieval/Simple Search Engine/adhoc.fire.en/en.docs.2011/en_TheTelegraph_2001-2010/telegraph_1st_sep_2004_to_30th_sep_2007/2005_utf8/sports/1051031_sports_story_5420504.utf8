 Elmont: Saint Liam, with 

 Jerry Bailey aboard, went out with a bang on Saturday, winning 

 the $4 million Breeders Cup Classic at Belmont with 

 a sizzling stretch run in what may well be the last race 

 of his career.

 This is his last race and 

 hes going to stud, declared owner William Warren.I 

 imagine his stud fee just went up a few thousand after todays 

 performance. But when it was suggested that some might 

 promote Afleet Alex, who won the Preakness and Belmont Stakes 

 this year after finishing third in the Kentucky Derby, as 

 Horse of the Year, Saint Liams camp said they would 

 not fear a match race. If he wants to run against 

 us in 45 days, were ready, said trainer Richard 

 Dutrow. Warren said he would consider a brief delay to the 

 stud farm if Afleet Alex, sidelined this summer by a minor 

 leg injury, wanted a showdown race. Afleet Alex is 

 a three-year-old. Were a five-year-old. We have the 

 maturity. I think we would win.

 Saturdays victory was worth 

 $2.43 million and boosted Saint Liams 2005 earnings 

 to $3.65 million. The five-year-old bay, the 2-1 favorite, 

 won for the fourth time this year and pressed his case for 

 Horse of the Year honors.

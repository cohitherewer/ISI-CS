 French soccer stars appeal for peace

Fort de France: Top French soccer players, reacting to riots in major cities, have urged authorities to address the problems of disaffected youths growing up in the suburbs. 

I grew up in the suburbs and I feel very close to these youths, said defender Lilian Thuram, the most capped player in Frances squad, which is in Martinique to play a friendly match against Costa Rica. 

The situation makes me sick. Nobody is asking the right questions. Nobody is trying to look at the real problems, the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship winner added. 

The protests, blamed on racism and unemployment in rundown suburbs, have spread from Paris poor suburbs to French towns across the country 

Several French internationals grew up in Paris suburbs, among them Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, who told reporters he did not wish to speak about the riots. 

Zinedine Zidane, the son of Algerian immigrants who grew up in a tough Marseille district, missed the trip to Martinique because of a groin injury. 

They are trying to convince the public that these people are nothing but rioters... which is not the truth, Thuram said.

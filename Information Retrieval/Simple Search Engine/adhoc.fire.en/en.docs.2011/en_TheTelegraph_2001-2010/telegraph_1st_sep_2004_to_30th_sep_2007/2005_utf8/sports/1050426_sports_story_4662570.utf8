 Milan face PSV

London: Chelsea continue their treble search in an all-English duel with Liverpool on Wednesday while AC Milan?s bid for a rare double faces a stern test from PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday in the Champions League semi-finals. 

A place in the May 25 Istanbul final beckons if Chelsea and Milan can exploit home advantage and take a commanding lead from their first-leg games at Stamford Bridge and San Siro. 

Jose Mourinho is at the helm of a team which has swept all before them. Chelsea?s first trophy of the season came when Mourinho?s men came from behind to beat Liverpool 3-2 in the Lague Cup final. 

Their second trophy, the Premier League, should be sealed any day now. Champions League success will be the icing on the cake.

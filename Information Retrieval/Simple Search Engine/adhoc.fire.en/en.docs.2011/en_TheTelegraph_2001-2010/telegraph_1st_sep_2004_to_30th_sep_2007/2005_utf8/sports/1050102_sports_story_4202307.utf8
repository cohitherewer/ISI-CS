Mumbai: Skipper Ajay Jadeja helped Delhi weather a middle order collapse and guided them to 394 in the first innings with a well-crafted innings of 93 on the second day of their Ranji Trophy Elite group A tie against holders Mumbai on Saturday. 

The former India batsman rescued the visitors after they lost three quick wickets to the second new ball in the morning, having resumed at the overnight score of 166 for three. 

Jadeja, with Sarandeep Singh, pulled Delhi out of a tight spot after they were reduced to 225 for 6. The Delhi captain, who was unlucky to miss a well deserved hundred after batting for close to three and a half hours and hitting 12 fours and two sixes, put on 84 runs with Sarandeep (30) for the seventh wicket. 

Jadeja got out when he chased a wide ball and edged medium pacer Usman Malvi, Mumbai?s most successful bowler. Ashish Nehra used the long handle to good effect to strike some mighty blows in making an unbeaten 41 off 87 balls with 6 fours and a six. 

Mumbai made 32 for no loss in 12 overs when stumps were drawn. 

Meanwhile, in Vadodara, Zaheer Khan and Yusuf Khan shared eight wickets to skittle out Uttar Pradesh for 124 and give Baroda a crucial first innings lead of 62 runs on Day II. 

At close, the hosts had widened the margin to 137, making 75 for three in the second innings. Zaheer grabbed three for 33 while spinner Yusuf, brother of Irfan Pathan, ripped out the heart of the UP first innings with a haul of five for 31 in only 17 overs. UP Captain Mohammed Kaif disappointed the big crowd by making only 11 before becoming left arm spinner Rajesh Pawar?s only victim. 

Meanwhile, in Hyderabad, the hosts skittled Assam out for 158 to gain a first innings lead of 182 runs and forced a follow-on on the visitors, who were struggling at nine for two at close on Day II. Assam ran into trouble with Hyderabad speedster Vishnuvardhan and spinner Indrasekhar Reddy wrecking the guest batting line-up at the meagre score.

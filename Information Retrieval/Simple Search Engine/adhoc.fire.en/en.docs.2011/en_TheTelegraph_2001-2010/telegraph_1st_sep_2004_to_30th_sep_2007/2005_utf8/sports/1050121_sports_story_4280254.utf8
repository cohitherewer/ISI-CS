 Aussies seek 3rd victory on trot

 Hayden returns to boost side 

Brisbane: Australia, seeking a third straight win and a place in the tri-series finals, will turn to their big hitters when they meet the West Indies on Friday. 

The West Indies face a daunting task in securing their first win as the Australians welcome back the powerful opening combination of Matthew Hayden ? who was rested for the first two matches ? and Adam Gilchrist, who missed one match with a knee injury. 

They are also contemplating pushing out-of-form but renowned one-day slogger Andrew Symonds up the order. 

The Australians have a wealth of talent to call on, with Michael Clarke ? the fill-in opener for Hayden in the last two matches ? dropping back to the middle-order after impressive knocks of 66 and 97. 

The boost in strike power won?t just be limited to the batting, with Jason Gillespie shrugging off a calf strain and cleared to play. 

Selectors must also decide whether to use allrounder Shane Watson in place of the in-form spinner Brad Hogg in a four-pronged pace attack. 

For the West Indies, winless after matches against Australia and Pakistan, the situation is bleak. 

Allrounder Chris Gayle further aggravated shoulder tendonitis during their six-wicket loss to Pakistan Wednesday and may not bowl again on tour. 

Without him, captain Brian Lara was forced to rely more upon part-timers Marlon Samuels, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Wavell Hinds who went for a total of 128 from 17 overs. 

Lara admitted his side was struggling to find the right balance without Gayle. 

Symonds enters the day-nighter desperate for runs after scoring four ducks in his last five innings for Australia, dating back to September. 

He has been in electrifying domestic one-day form during that time but is still no certainty to play ahead of Simon Katich and Darren Lehmann. 

Captain Ricky Ponting said Symonds was often on ?a hiding to nothing? while trying to score quick runs late in the innings.

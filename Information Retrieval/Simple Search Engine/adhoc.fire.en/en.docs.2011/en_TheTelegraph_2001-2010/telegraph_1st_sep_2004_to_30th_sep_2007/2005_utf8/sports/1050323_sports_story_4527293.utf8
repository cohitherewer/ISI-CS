 Competing with Russel motivating: Rathore 

 Rathore is looking at the Dubai World Cup finals 

Jaipur: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore Tuesday said competing with his coach Mark Russel in the recent Commonwealth shooting championships was ?challenging as well as motivating? but did not agree that the Australian had anything extra up his sleeves. 

?It was challenging as well as motivating. Competing with your coach also sets a benchmark for you,? said Rathore, who pipped Russel during the team competition but was beaten in individual event of double trap. 

When asked if Russel had some thing extra up his sleeve, Rathore said, ?no, there is nothing like that, he too is a good shooter and I cannot always win.? 

The Olympic silver medallist shooter also said that he had retained Russel as his coach with many major events including World Cups coming up as also he was targeting the Olympic gold. 

?See, every tournament is important. I have to win and muster good scores too because the winners of four different World Cups and the top 12 qualify for the finals to be held in Dubai in November. 

?I don?t want to miss even minor things and that is why that I have continued with Russel. I have also hired an Australian sports psychologist Peter Terry.

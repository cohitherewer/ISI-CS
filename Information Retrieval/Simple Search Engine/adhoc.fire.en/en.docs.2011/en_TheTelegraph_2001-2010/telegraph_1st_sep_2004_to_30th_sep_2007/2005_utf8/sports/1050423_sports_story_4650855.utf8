 MCA elections

Mumbai: Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president Sharad Pawar Friday declared valid the nomination of former India captain Nari Contractor for the post of vice-president of the association. 

Pawar flew down from Delhi to decide on the issue after Contractor, whose nomination had been deemed invalid by the election officer during the scrutiny Thursday as it had been seconded by a defaulter, lodged an appeal against the decision. 

?Pawar has declared that nomination of Contractor is valid as the MCA constitution is silent whether a proposer or seconder could be defaulter or not. It only says that a defaulter cannot vote or stand for election,? MCA joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty said. 

Pawar specially flew down to decide on the issue because both the incumbent vice-presidents, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Sawant, are also in the fray. 

The MCA elections will be held on Wednesday.

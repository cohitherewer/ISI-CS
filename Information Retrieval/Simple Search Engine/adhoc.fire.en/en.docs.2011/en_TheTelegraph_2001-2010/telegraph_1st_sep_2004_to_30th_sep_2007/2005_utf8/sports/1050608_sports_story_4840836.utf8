 Challenge now is to be good hosts

Frankfurt: Germany has proved it can stage the worlds biggest soccer tournament. Now it needs to show that it can also host a party for more than a million foreign visitors. 

With a year to go before the World Cup kicks off in Munich on June 9 2006, the big challenge left for organisers is to make the tournament a festival for fans from around the globe. 

The serious business of organising the month-long, 64-game event has been a breeze for Germany. 

The 12 stadiums are in place, a 4.5-billion-euro ($5.52-billion) programme of investment in transport is running on time and a security blueprint has already been agreed. 

In contrast, the public relations work has been a disaster ever since Germany was awarded the finals in July 2000 after a controversial vote. 

The countrys football authorities have been dogged by scandal, including a corruption case involving one of the showpiece venues and the Robert Hoyzer match-fixing affair. 

The World Cup mascot, a life-sized puppet lion, is widely derided in Germany, while recent outbreaks of hooliganism have raised fears that the tournament will be ruined by violence. 

Franz Beckenbauer, chairman of the local organising committee, gave a call to attention in February after referee Hoyzer had confessed to fixing league and cup matches in return for money. 

The last six months have been a disgrace, Beckenbauer said. Weve been virtually incapable of action. 

That looked a harsh assessment, given that work has continued smoothly throughout the Hoyzer scandal. 

The Allianz Arena in Munich, the venue for the tournaments opening match, was completed from scratch in just two-and-a-half years and won countrywide applause when it staged its first big match at the end of last month, a clash between Bayern Munich and the German national team. 

The remodelled Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which will host the final, was re-inaugurated last year and its recent handling of the German Cup final with a 74,000 full house was faultless. 

The rest of the venues are either finished or close to it and five of them will be road-tested during the Confederations Cup from June 15 to 29. 

Barring any major organisational problems thrown up at that rehearsal tournament, the progress already made means Germany can spend the 12-month build-up to the tournament improving its image rather than fretting over logistics.

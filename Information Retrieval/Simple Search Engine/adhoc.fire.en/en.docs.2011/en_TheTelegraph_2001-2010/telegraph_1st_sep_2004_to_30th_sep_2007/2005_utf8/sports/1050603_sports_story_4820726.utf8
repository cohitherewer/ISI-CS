Paris: The most complete player in tennis and the sports hottest newcomer come face to face on Friday when Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal slug it out for a place in the French Open final. 

What would have been a dream title match comes one round too soon and the winner will be overwhelming favourite to claim his first Roland Garros trophy. 

Twelfth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia meets unseeded Argentine Mariano Puerta in the other semi-final. 

The Russian, who turned 24 on Thursday, advanced to the semi-finals of a grand slam tournament for the first time by overcoming Tommy Robredo and made sure of entering the top 10 when the new rankings are released on Monday. 

First time in the semi-finals of a Grand Slam, first time in the top 10 ? this is my birthday present, he said. 

Puerta, on the other hand, also made it to the maiden semi-final stage of a Grand Slam, edging past Guillermo Coria on Thursday. 

Meanwhile, victory on Sunday would make Federer the sixth player in history to win all four Grand Slams, an astonishing achievement for a 23-year-old who won his first major title at Wimbledon in 2003. That would be definitely a dream come true, Federer said. 

Nadal, who turns 19 on Friday, is bidding to become the first man to win the French Open on debut since Swedens Mats Wilander in 1982. 

The burly Spaniard has destroyed everything standing in his way to the last four and has already won five titles this year. 

The left-hander with the devastating forehand has been described by John McEnroe as the most exciting newcomer since Boris Becker triumphed at Wimbledon for the first time 20 years ago. Not only can Nadal fire astonishing winners from all corners of the court but he also seems strong enough physically and mentally to wear down any opposition. 

Federer, however, is a different proposition from anyone else on the mens tour. The Swiss top seed has not dropped a set nor lost his cool in the tournament. He is the perfect combination of elegance and power. He is master of every shot in the book and can do damage on any surface. Strangely, he has struggled here, a quarter-final appearance in 2001 being his best result until this year. 

The pair are tied 1-1 but have never met on clay. In the Miami final this year on hardcourt, Nadal won the first two sets before Federer fought back to win 6-1 in the fifth. Its going to be really interesting to see, he said. For me its a big moment. Its one of those chances to walk away with the title here. 

Nadal, who is on a 22-match winning streak on clay, is happy to be considered the underdog. 

He is the favourite, no?, said the young Spaniard, whose English is not as impressive as his on-court fist-pumping. He has the pressure. He is the number one.

 Schnyder too hot for Ivanovic

 - American may skip final due to injury 

 Patty Schnyder celebrates her win over Ana Ivanovic in the Linz Open semi-final on Saturday 

Linz: Patty Schnyder defeated Ana Ivanovic 7-5, 6-2 in the semi-finals of the Linz Open but could miss Sundays title match against Nadia Petrova after injuring her left wrist in a fit of temper. 

The left-handed Swiss, who advanced to her second final in as many weeks, said she would visit a local hospital to get the injury examined. 

Schnyder picked up the injury when she slammed her racket to the ground after dropping serve for a second time. 

Its pretty stupid, and very unlucky how it happened, Schnyder said after getting her wrist and hand bandaged. 

If she is fit, Schnyder will play third seed Petrova after the Russian beat unseeded Czech Kveta Peschke 6-3, 6-4. 

Petrova, who is still searching for her first WTA crown after finishing runner-up four times, will be aiming to break title jinx at the site of her first final in 2003. 

Schnyders victory means she is virtually certain to take part in the WTA Championships, to be held in Los Angeles from November 8, although five players are still chasing the three remaining spots. As well as Schnyder, Justine Henin-Hardenne, Venus Williams, Elena Dementieva and Petrova all have a chance to qualify. 

Williams, however, has played just one match since the US Open, and has withdrawn from the final run-up event in Philadelphia next week.

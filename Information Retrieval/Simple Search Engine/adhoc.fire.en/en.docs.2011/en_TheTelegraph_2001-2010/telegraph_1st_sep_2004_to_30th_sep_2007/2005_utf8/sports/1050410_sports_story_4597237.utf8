 NZ want umpires in ?light? pants

Wellington: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming wants the umpires to swap their black trousers for light-coloured pants when the second Test against Sri Lanka starts at the Basin Reserve on Monday. 

Fleming?s unusual request followed complaints by his batsmen in the first Test that they could not properly see some balls from Lankan paceman Lasith Malinga, who bowls with an unorthodox round-arm action. 

The batsmen said that because his deliveries are released in front of the umpires, they find it hard to pick them against the backdrop of dark trousers. 

?I?m not sure what the rules are but we?ve asked if they can change,? Fleming said. ?There?s a period there when he?s delivering when it gets lost in the trousers. When it?s fine we don?t have so much trouble, but when it?s overcast and dreary, the game changes.? 

Malinga captured nine wickets in the drawn first Test in Napier, including five in the second innings, when the Kiwis were dismissed for 238. 

Sri Lanka?s Australia-born coach John Dyson says Malinga?s unusual action makes him difficult to play and could turn him into a potential matchwinner. ?He was chosen because he does bowl quickly, he?s a little bit unorthodox and guys have trouble picking him up,? Dyson said.

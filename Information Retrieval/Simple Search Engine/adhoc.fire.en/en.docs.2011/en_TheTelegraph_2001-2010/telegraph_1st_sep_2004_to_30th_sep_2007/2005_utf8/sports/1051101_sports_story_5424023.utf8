 Bhutia calls for collective responsibility 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bengal captain Bhaichung Bhutia has called for collective responsibility to bring back the Santosh Trophy in the state. 

We are a very good team, but unless theres a collective responsibility chances of winning get reduced, Bhaichung warned on Monday, a day before the squad leaves for Kerala. 

Describing captain the side as great honour, the India striker said that winning is our target. But we wont pressurise ourselves in achieving it. Im thinking match by match. 

Syed Rahim Nabi didnt turn up in the final practice session owing to mild temperature, but coach Aloke Mukherjee informed he would go with the squad. 

Meanwhile, State Bank of India is sponsoring Bengal in the tournament.

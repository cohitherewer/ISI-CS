Margao: Dudu Omagbemi struck for Sporting Clube de Goa against Salgaocar, taking his team to the provisionally top position of the National Football League for the ONGC Cup on Wednesday. 

Dudu, who is the highest scorer in the league so far, scored the only goal of the match when he headed home a well-directed Adebayo Adewusi cross from the left, three minutes before the interval. The strike took Dudu?s tally to 15 goals in the competition. 

The win took Sporting to the top spot with 38 points from 18 matches, two points ahead of East Bengal, while Salgaocar remained in seventh place with 22 points from 18 matches. East Bengal, however, have played one match less.

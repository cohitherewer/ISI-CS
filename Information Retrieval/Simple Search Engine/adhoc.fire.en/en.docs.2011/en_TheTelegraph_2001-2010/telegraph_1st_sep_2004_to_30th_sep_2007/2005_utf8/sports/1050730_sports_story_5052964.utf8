OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Support from seniors makes a big difference, feels Dhoni 

Dambulla: It was under Sourav Ganguly that Mahendra Singh Dhoni earned his maiden Team India cap ? in Bangladesh, last December. As important, he continued to be backed by his then captain. 

On Friday, it was Rahul Dravids turn to praise the dashing Dhoni: He has an excellent work ethic and has done well in whatever the role assigned... He gives us options... 

Reacting to praise from the new captain, Dhoni told The Telegraph: Support from the seniors makes a big difference... Besides taking away some pressure, regular backing has helped me quickly settle in the team... 

Dhoni suffered a minor groin injury during practice match No. 1, in Colombo the other day, but is perfectly fine and didnt aggravate it by turning out in the second match as well.

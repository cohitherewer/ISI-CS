La Paz: Brazil defied high altitude and rough play from Bolivia to earn a 1-1 draw in their World Cup qualifier on Sunday. World champions Brazil, who have already qualified for next years finals in Germany, have 31 points from 17 games, are placed second after Argentina in the group. 

Bolivia, with no chance of qualifying, stayed bottom of the 10-nation South American group with 14 points. 

Juninho Pernambucano put Brazil ahead with a trademark free kick before substitute Jose Castillo replied for Bolivia after 50 minutes of a match played at 3,600-metres above sea level. 

The hosts were allowed to get away with several nasty challenges in the second half thanks to lenient refereeing by Uruguayan Jorge Larrionda. 

Bolivia peppered the Brazil goal with long-range shots while the visitors tried to slow the game down. Brazil went ahead in the 25th minute when Juninhos dipping 30-metre shot hit the underside of the bar and bounced into the net off goalkeeper Carlos Arias. 

Roque Junior nearly added a second when he headed wide following a corner. At the other end Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar made two outstanding saves in less than a minute, blocking a header from Miguel Hoyos and parrying a powerful Julio Baldivieso drive. 

Joaquin Botero wasted another chance when he broke down the right and fired across the face of the goal. 

Bolivia equalised five minutes after the break when Daner Pachis long ball forward was headed down by Botero into the path of Castillo, who rifled home from 12-metre. 

Bolivia then appeared to be given a licence to kick by referee Larrionda. Midfielder Gonzalo Galindo was allowed to stay on the field when he blatantly kicked Cicinho from behind after the ball had gone. 

Carmelo Angulo scythed down Renato, then Galindo pushed over Robinho, shouted at the referee and still escaped a booking. 

Earlier, Sergio Jauregui was also let off for a cynical tackle from behind on Robinho. Brazil finished the game on the attack and were let down by unusually poor shooting. 

In another match played in Buenos Aires, Argentina scored twice in the final ten minutes for a hard-earned 2-0 win over a stubborn Peru in their World Cup qualifier on Sunday. 

Eigthteen-year-old Lionel Messi, given his first start by coach Jose Pekerman, set up the opener when he won a penalty, converted by Juan Roman Riquelme, before defender Luis Guadelupe put through his own goal in injury time. Already-qualified Argentina remained top of the 10-nation South American World Cup qualifying group with 34 points from 17 games and increased their lead over Brazil to three points. 

Argentina are away to Uruguay in their final game on Wednesday, while Brazil, who have also qualified and drew 1-1 away to Bolivia earlier in the day, host Venezuela. 

Regarded as one of the most gifted Argentine players to play for the national side in years, Messi had made only two brief appearances before Sunday. 

He was sent off after less than two minutes of his debut in a friendly against Hungary in August and was given another nine minutes in last months 1-0 qualifying defeat by Paraguay. 

Messi gave the Peru defence a torrid time with his speed but also found the going tough as he was repeatedly fouled by the visitors. 

Captain Juan Pablo Sorin had Argentinas two best first-half efforts, both close range headers which were brilliantly saved by Leao Butron. 

Argentina continued to struggle after halftime and Peru nearly grabbed a shock lead on the hour when Paolo Guerrero outpaced his marker but shot over the goal.

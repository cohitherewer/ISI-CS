 Princess may do the trick 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It is going to be a very close contest between Sanskara and Supreme Princess in Saturdays Ladies Derby, the 2,400m Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks ? a terms races for 3-year-old fillies.

 Sanskara, an easy winner of the Monsoon Derby, had everything going right for her until the last week. However, her withdrawal from a mock race, last Saturday, when she became unruly and sustained a superficial injury, has raised Supreme Princess hopes.

 The Princess, on the other hand, is right on the charted course. In her preparatory run, the Razeen-Eminence daughter simply thrashed Bountiful Pleasure ? a Class I horse. She is on the up and the Daniel David-trainee may do the trick in the hands of visiting jockey B.Prakash.

 In fact, the jockey-trainer combination is expected to rule the afternoons eight-event card.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

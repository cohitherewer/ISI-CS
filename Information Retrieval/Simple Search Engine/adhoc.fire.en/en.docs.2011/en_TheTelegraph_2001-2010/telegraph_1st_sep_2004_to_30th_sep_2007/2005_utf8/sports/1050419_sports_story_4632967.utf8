 English football gets a great fillip 

Free Kick 

P.K. Banerjee

 Who would have foreseen two English clubs setting up a semi-final showdown in the Champions League at the start of the season? And when those clubs happen to be neither Manchester United nor Arsenal ? who have between them won the last nine Premier League championships ? you know something special has happened.

 In just over a week?s time, Chelsea and Liverpool will be battling each other for a shot at the coveted European Cup and that is as exciting a prospect as anything English soccer has experienced in several years.

 For Chelsea, this is just an extension of their brilliant Premier League form. Driven by the cash-rich Roman Abramovich, guided by a shrewd coach (Jose Mourinho) and powered by a set of young and energetic players, Chelsea have been exceptionally consistent this season. One loss in 32 league games speaks volumes of their cutting edge. Having fought off the challenge of Sir Alex Ferguson?s Manchester United and Arsene Wenger?s Arsenal, Chelsea are on the verge of not only ending the Big Two?s ?monopoly? but also bagging their maiden Premiership title in half a century.

 In the Champions League, Chelsea have had to overcome two continental giants en route to the last four. They first tossed out Barcelona and then caught Bayern Munich napping. Significantly, Chelsea scored heavily in the double-leg clashes (5-4 versus Barcelona and 6-5 versus Bayern). They did lose both away matches, but that doesn?t take away from Chelsea?s impressive strike rate, which is an obvious reflection of their effective midfield-forward combination.

 Milan Baros could prove 

 to be Liverpools trump card versus Chelsea in 

 the Champions League semi-final

 I consider Chelsea?s Bayern conquest 

 as their biggest achievement. Having lost 2-4 away, the 

 German side needed a two-goal victory in the second leg 

 to at least force extra-time. It wasn?t beyond Bayern. With 

 German blood flowing through several veins, many expected 

 Bayern to rise to the occasion at home and silence the giantkillers.

 Bayern did give it their best shot, but Chelsea were too determined and dogged to squander their first-leg advantage. An early Chelsea goal, thanks to a Lucio deflection which gave Oliver Kahn no chance, hurt Bayern?s aspirations.

 As the desperate Germans pressed for goals, it made for some exciting end-to-end soccer. The action resembled a game of basketball, where there is no scope of holding on to the ball and slowing the pace. Once you thwart an opposition raid, you have to attack.

 Ballack missed two goals from about 10 yards but Chelsea, in general, defended admirably, at times with 10 men in their half. John Terry was outstanding, so were Joe Cole and Frank Lampard. I also liked their African striker Didier Drogba who was a sharp weapon in Chelsea?s counter-attacks. He has got the height, the energy as well as a nose for goals. His header, which helped Chelsea regain the lead, showed his class.

 Bayern displayed typical German spirit by knocking in two late goals but time ran out on them. 

 The real surprise package were Liverpool. The most successful English Club with a record 18 league titles, 6 FA Cup crowns and 4 Champions League triumphs, Liverpool have been subdued in the last decade and a half. They haven?t won the league since 1990 while the last time they featured in European Cup semis was 20 years ago.

 Juventus, quite a heavyweight in the last decade and more, had the names to match the team?s reputation: Buffon, Thuram, Cannavaro, Nedved, Zambrotta, Ibrahimovic, Del Piero? Playing the second leg at home, Juventus needed a solitary goal to get even with Liverpool. But Liverpool, spearheaded by the cool Sami Hyypia, didn?t allow the star-studded Juventus midfield and forwardline to gell.

 The English team, justifiably focussing on defence, had just one man up front ? Milan Baros. Even on a day when Liverpool were busy trying to avoid conceding a goal, this long-haired Czech striker stood out. He has an uncanny ability to move into scoring positions and even though he failed to find the Juventus net, Chelsea will have to watch out for Baros. He?s dangerous inside rival territory and could well prove to be Liverpool?s trump card in the semi-final.

 Whatever happens in that showdown, one thing which can be said with a degree of surety is that these two teams have given English football a great fillip. Manchester and Arsenal had kicked off the resurgence a few years ago, now the process seems to be heading towards its logical climax.

 Beckham still has some good football left in him and a clutch of quality home-grown players like Lampard, Gerrard, Rooney, Cole have emerged to bolster Eriksson?s roster. I believe that if the national coach gets enough time to prepare, England can be in a position to have a serious crack at next year?s World Cup.

 Rudolph staves off Australia

Perth: A defiant century from Jacques Rudolph ensured South Africa salvaged a draw in the opening Test against Australia at the WACA on Tuesday. 

Set a near-impossible 491 to win, South Africa successfully batted through the final day to finish on 287 for five after resuming on 85 for two and losing two early wickets on Tuesday. 

Rudolph, who was called into the XI as a late replacement for the injured Jacques Kallis, survived more than seven hours to finish unbeaten on 102, frustrating the Australian bowlers with his sturdy defence and unwavering patience. 

The Australians looked to be on course to win the match when they reduced the visitors to 138 for four before lunch but managed only one more wicket. 

Rudolph and Justin Kemp held fort for nearly three-and-a-half hours, putting on 112 for the fifth wicket until Shane Warne dismissed Kemp for 55 after tea, leaving Mark Boucher (13 not out) to play out the last hour with Rudolph. 

Rudolph, who started the day on 18 and was exhausted by the end of it, batted 431 minutes and faced 283 balls. He scored his fifth century just five overs before the close when he drove Warne through the covers for his 13th and final boundary. 

South Africa made a terrible start to the day when Brett Lee dismissed Herschelle Gibbs and Warne removed Ashwell Prince leg-before before lunch. 

The second Test starts in Melbourne next Monday with the final match in Sydney from January 2. 

Australia have named Phil Jaques in place of the injured Justin Langer for the Boxing Day Test.

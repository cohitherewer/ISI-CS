 PCB raps Akram

Islamabad: A day after ICC rebuked Wasim Akram, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said it was surprised at the outbursts of the former captain and would have a word with him when he returns from India. 

He may have just made off the cuff remarks like it generally happens. But when he returns from India the board will have a word with him because he is a big name and such statements attributed to him are not good for his image or that of Pakistan cricket, a senior PCB official said. 

He said Akram was generally a very responsible person and spoke sensibly on television as a commentator and host. 

It is only when he returns home that we will talk to him and find out what has happened and why he made these remarks, he was quoted as saying in a local daily. 

Akram had recently said ICC is nothing but a forum for white cricketers while also slamming its president Ehsan Mani. 

In a rebuttal to Akram on Sunday, Mani said the Pakistani pacemans remarks were ill-informed and offensive.

 Imran, Akram flay selectors

 Imran feels Shoaib should have been included 

Karachi: Former Pakistan greats Imran Khan and Wasim Akram blamed selectors for the first Test defeat against the West Indies. 

It was over-confidence in dropping Shoaib Akhtar. The West Indies were rated as the third-from-bottom team and against them we lacked a wicket-taking bowler, Imran Khan said on Tuesday. 

Pakistan dropped Shoaib from the 17-man squad on fitness grounds, and added that the fast bowler needs to improve his attitude. 

Its a fundamental rule in cricket that you never underestimate your opponent. Pakistan did underestimate the West Indies, there was complacency. 

Pakistan, who swept the ODI series versus the West Indies 3-0, were handed a massive 276-run defeat in Bridgetown. 

Pakistan have not won a series in the West Indies in their previous five tours. 

Pakistan committed one of the most bizarre mistakes in dropping Shoaib. Mohammed Sami got injured, so where were the bowlers to get the opposition out twice? asked Imran. 

Akram agreed that Pakistan needed a wicket-taking bowler on flat West Indies pitches and criticised the selectors for dropping Shoaib. 

One-day cricket is different. Pakistan had bowlers who bowled 10 overs and took wickets but in Tests you need to get 20 wickets and there were none to bowl the opponents out twice, said Akram. 

Best for Edwards 

Meanwhile, Tino Best replaced the injured Fidel Edwards in the only change to the West Indies squad of 13 for the second and final Test beginning on Friday.

Sao Paulo: Argentine soccer great Diego Maradona was detained at Rio de Janeiro airport on Thursday after he tried to force his way onto a flight that he was late for, police and a Brazilian airline said. 

Police held Maradona, 45, for several hours in the morning before releasing him. He boarded a flight to Buenos Aires on Thursday afternoon. 

Maradona, plagued by health problems since he retired in 1997, had played a benefit game organised by ex-Brazilian star and current Japan coach Zico in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday. 

He arrived late at Tom Jobim International Airport for a flight back to Argentina and began arguing with the staff of Brazilian airline TAM, police said. 

TAM said the boarding gate was closed when Maradona and four companions arrived. They damaged a door in the passageway to the plane and forced open a second door before police arrived, the airline said in a statement. 

In Buenos Aires, the Argentine star denied he turned violent but admitted he shouted insults at a security guard who he said pointed a gun at his face. 

I didnt destroy anything. If we had broken something, we wouldnt be here, Maradona said during a press conference, adding the guard apparently thought we had guns.

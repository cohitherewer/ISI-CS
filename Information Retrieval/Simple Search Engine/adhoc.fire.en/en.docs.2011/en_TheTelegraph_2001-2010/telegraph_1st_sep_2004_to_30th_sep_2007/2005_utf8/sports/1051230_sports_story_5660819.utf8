 NFL schedule not finalised yet

New Delhi: The 10th edition of the National Football League (NFL) is on the anvil, but the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is no closer to finalising the schedule for the ten-team championship. 

The league was originally scheduled to start on January 7, but was likely to be postponed for a few days due to concerns expressed by the participating teams or certain other logistical problems.

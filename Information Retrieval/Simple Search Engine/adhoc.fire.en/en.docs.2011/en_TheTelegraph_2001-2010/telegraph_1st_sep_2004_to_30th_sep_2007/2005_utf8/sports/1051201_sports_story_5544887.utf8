Chennai: Indian team members are looking forward to Sachin Tendulkars record 35th century in the first Test against Sri Lanka starting here on Friday, stylish middle-order batsman V. V. S. Laxman said on Wednesday. 

The mood in the dressing room is excellent. Each one of us are looking forward to the Test series and Sachin reaching his milestone will be a great feeling for all of us, Laxman said. 

Meanwhile, Muttiah Muralidharan, when asked whether it was going to be a Sachin-Murali clash, the world class bowler said Not only Sachin ... India is a strong side having in its ranks players like Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Sourav Ganguly and Laxman. We will have to strive hard to get their wickets. 

On playing against Muralidharan, Laxman said It is highly challenging to play Murali in one-dayers. I have never played him in Test matches. I have practised certain ways to tackle him. Hopefully, everything will click. 

On his own fitness levels, Laxman, who made his highest score of 281 in Calcutta in 2001 to lead India to a stunning win against Australia, said, I am looking forward to playing match winning knocks. 

Preparations have been quite good. Luckily, I had a good tour of Zimbabwe and then had played in the Challenger Trophy and a match in Duleep Trophy. Unfortunately, I did not get to play more matches. I have been training with the Hyderabad Ranji team, he said. 

 He said he had started the season on a good note and there was going to be lot of opportunities for him in Tests. 

Important tours are coming up. After our tour to Pakistan, England is coming to India and we will tour the West Indies, he said adding I am looking forward to start off well against the Sri Lankans. 

On his future, Laxman said: I am looking at it match by match. I have always given one hundred per cent ... Each time I was given the chance. 

About the weather threatening to play spoilsport once again, he said We are professional cricketers and we need to perform whatever the condition or circumstance. 

On the wicket for the match, he said The wicket looks good. As the match progresses, it will definitely turn. 

Meanwhile, Muralidharan predicted that the three Test series between Sri Lanka and India was going to be one-on-one and added that his side will strive hard for success. 

I have never played here before but the bowlers, especially the spinners on either side, will have an advantage in the outcome of the match, Muralidharan said after the teams net practice for over two-and-a-half-hours. It is a big challenge for me and I have to prove myself against a formidable side like India.

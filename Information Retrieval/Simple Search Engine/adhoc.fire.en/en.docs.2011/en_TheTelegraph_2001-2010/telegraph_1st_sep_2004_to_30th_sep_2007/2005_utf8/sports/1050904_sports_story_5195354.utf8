The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It will be tough for Sania

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Davis Cuppers Akhtar Ali and Jaidip Mukerjea both feel it would be very tough for Sania Mirza to scalp Maria Sharapova. 

Following are excerpts from what they told The Telegraph on Sundays fourth-round match at the US Open: 

JAIDIP MUKERJEA: Yes, Sania has beaten two top-10 players, she doesnt get overawed playing higher-ranked opponents. But Id still say she faces a very difficult match against the top seed. Maria moves her opponents around a lot, Sania has to be prepared. Also, Sania has to serve well, otherwise Sharapova will take advantage of her weak second serves. 

To have an outside chance of pulling it off, Sania will have to grab the chances that come her way. The good thing is, shes improving with every match. 

AKHTAR ALI: This will be Sanias toughest match of the season, make no mistake. She will be up against someone who hits the ball harder than her and is very consistent too. Sharapova can hit accurately on both flanks, she has more experience and is in great form. 

Sania is still learning, she has to play more percentage tennis. She has taken unbelievable strides in the past one year, but I think it will be very tough for her to overcome Sharapova.

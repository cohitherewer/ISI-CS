 India hope to turn a new leaf

 Karachi: Just as winds of change are sweeping through Indian cricket, the national football team launches a new era on Thursday, under Syed Nayeemuddins tutelage. 

This is the countrys only football Dronacharyas second stint as India coach. With the one and only P.K. Banerjee as the manager of the squad, who is expected to provide valuable technical inputs to the coach, there is a buzz of optimism around Bhaichung Bhutias team. 

This, despite the fact that Indias last two foreign trips have been disastrous. They lost to Fiji, as well as to Pakistan ? opposition they should have been devouring with relish. 

Nepal are Indias first opponents in the round-robin stage. They have a couple of names who will ring a bell in Indian fans minds ? Hari Khadka and Rakesh Sreshtha. And, of course, Nepal have a foreign coach in Toshiko Shiozawa. 

As Bhutia said on Wednesday, India have as good a chance as any other team to win the title. But the captain also did point out that this was not the best Indian team as there are several players out with injury problems. 

We havent been able to practise too much together, but we are all keen to do well, Bhutia added. And thats important. (Agencies)

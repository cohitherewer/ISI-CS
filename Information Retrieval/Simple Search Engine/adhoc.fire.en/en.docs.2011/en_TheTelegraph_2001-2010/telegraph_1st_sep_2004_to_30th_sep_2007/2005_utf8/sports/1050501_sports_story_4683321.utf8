The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I believe special things in life have their own timing?

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE - Sachin talks about Bangalore, his wait and more... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 With 72 hundreds in Tests and ODIs, there?s little that Sachin Tendulkar needs to prove. The maestro, now in his 33rd year, recently spoke to The Telegraph for well over an hour. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q What?s your reaction 

 to Wisden?s observation that your approach has become colder? 

 That, perhaps, you?re now more mechanical and less passionate? A Has my body language 

 changed? It hasn?t? My passion, too, hasn?t? No matter who 

 says what, I?m sure the passion is visible on the field. 

 Okay? To move on, would you 

 have been relieved had the 35th Test hundred materialised 

 in the series versus Pakistan? Would you, then, have enjoyed 

 the off-season more? Now, you?ve got to wait till at least 

 the August-September tour of Zimbabwe? 

 I?m still going to enjoy the break? 

 Cricket isn?t about records and life won?t be different 

 (in the next three months) because I didn?t get that hundred. 

 But that 35th hundred has 

 become a national obsession? 

 Look, one wishes to score big 

 in every innings? Of course, I can?t predict what I?ll get? 

 A batsman either believes he has struck a four or played 

 the perfect defensive shot? Nobody looks at the other side 

 of the coin, that one can also get out. Cricket isn?t a 

 game of certainties. 

 Aren?t you thrilled at being 

 just one hundred away from a huge record? 

 Well, 35 is a special number? 

 However, I haven?t thought about getting there too deeply... 

 I tend to believe special things in life have their own 

 timing? Moreover, there?s more to cricket and my life than 

 a 35th Test hundred? I didn?t begin my career with a target. 

 Today, then, why must I talk in terms of one? Bottomline 

 is, I need to do the right thing at the right time. 

 Are you, at least, happy that 

 the 10,000 barrier has been crossed? 

 (Smiles) That achievement 

 puts in perspective my 15-plus years of international cricket? 

 Believe me, I wasn?t myself that conscious when I was near 

 the 10,000 mark, but people around me always kept reminding. 

 Speaking of hundreds, is Jacques 

 Kallis emerging a big threat to you and Brian Lara? 

 He?s a great batsman? Very well-balanced both when 

 attacking and defending? Is mentally tough and, overall, 

 has a terrific temperament. 

 [Kallis began the Antigua Test with 21 hundreds. Lara?s 

 tally is 28.] 

 What makes a complete batsman? 

 The ability to analyse situations? 

 Decent technique? The ability to control the game by making 

 the bowler bowl to his strengths? A good defence... 

 Who, in your opinion, have 

 come closest to being perfect? 

 Viv Richards for his ability to 

 murder any attack and Sunil Gavaskar for his ability to 

 control the game even with defensive play. 

 Incidentally, how is your 

 left elbow? 

 I?ve learnt to deal with the pain? 

 I?ve had a tricky (tennis elbow) injury? The pain lingers 

 and one has to bear it? At times, I?m in pain; on other 

 occasions, I?m not. Somebody with a back stiffness problem 

 could feel the same way. 

 Are you continuing with a 

 rehab programme? 

 I?m particular with exercises? 

 Then, the icing is also regular, both after nets and at 

 the end of each day that I bat. 

 What was your first thought 

 when the pain became excruciating in Amstelveen? 

 Thought it was a spasm and I would 

 be fine in a few days? Actually, I missed over two months 

 of international cricket. 

 How would you draw up your 

 own balance sheet for the 2004-05 season? 

 The tennis elbow made it tough? 

 One does plan for a season, but things don?t always work 

 out the way you desire? 

 The ODIs were a disappointment, 

 but how would you assess Team India?s Test performance? 

 We did okay against Australia 

 and played well in Calcutta to win the series versus South 

 Africa? Then, we weren?t stretched by Bangladesh? As for 

 the series against Pakistan, we did well initially, but 

 ought to have ended better? 

 Is that last afternoon in 

 Bangalore going to haunt for long? Do you regret getting 

 into a shell? 

 It?s easy for people to talk? 

 The close-in fielders, though, would have moved away only 

 if we had a chance of winning? And, with four wickets (Gautam 

 Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav Ganguly) 

 falling in the second session, where was that chance? Where 

 was that support for me to play positively? In any case, 

 (Virender) Sehwag had got out in the opening session itself? 

 Those who were free with criticism should understand nothing 

 would have been achieved (at that stage) by trying to be 

 positive? It was a fifth day wicket with dual bounce and 

 the ball often didn?t spin the way it threatened to? My 

 objective was to kill time, without giving the opposition 

 any chance to break through? There are times when, playing 

 positively, you play a shot which is just 80 per cent safe? 

 I didn?t want to give Pakistan even a 20 per cent chance 

 on any shot from my bat. After all, a draw would have given 

 us the series... If you recall, I?d started differently, 

 hitting (Mohammed) Sami for a four on probably the second 

 ball. But, then, wickets began to fall and I had to adjust. 

 Indeed, playing a few shots wouldn?t have changed Pakistan?s 

 game plan. 

 What was Team India?s game 

 plan that morning? 

 To have enough wickets in hand 

 by the end of the third hour, a situation which would have 

 helped us control the Test? Given that Sehwag left early, 

 our best chance of winning was to have been only one-down 

 when the fourth hour began. 

 You must have been crushed 

 on being the second out (after Dinesh Karthik) in the final 

 session? 

 I?d been playing for the team? 

 I?d been telling myself I had to be patient? That I had 

 to take it ball by ball? I was upset. 

 Looking back on the season 

 just ended, who made the biggest difference in Tests ? Sehwag 

 or Anil Kumble? 

 The batting of Sehwag and Rahul as also the efforts 

 of Kumble and Harbhajan Singh... Then, (Irfan) Pathan had 

 been outstanding in Bangladesh? 

 [Sehwag scored 1,128 runs, while Dravid totalled 841; 

 Kumble bagged 64 wickets, with Harbhajan getting 48. Pathan 

 had 18 wickets in the two Tests in Bangladesh.] 

 What makes Sehwag tick? 

 The free flow and swing of his 

 bat? Also, his thought process is very good. It may appear 

 he goes bang-bang-bang, but that?s not so. Sehwag plans, 

 doesn?t close his eyes and swing... He?s aware of the areas 

 he needs to target. 

 Sehwag hardly relies on footwork? 

 But his hand-eye coordination 

 is superb, isn?t it? 

 The 2004-05 season, however, 

 didn?t begin well for Sehwag? Did the ODI failures make 

 him more determined when the first Test series (versus Australia) 

 got underway? 

 People should make an allowance 

 for failure? Keep room for that? In fact, whatever the field, 

 there?s no individual anywhere who hasn?t failed at some 

 point? Surely, failure isn?t a crime and somebody who fails 

 will pull through only with the support of those around 

 him. Sehwag, I?m sure, is going to acknowledge that the 

 team backed him. 

 Sourav got crucified for a 

 poor run. Your thoughts? 

 He tried to score, but couldn?t? 

 He wanted to contribute and feel good, but couldn?t? Clearly, 

 the criticism didn?t help... That Sourav?s form became such 

 a big issue just didn?t help him ? As I?ve said, you?ve 

 got to make an allowance for failure. 

 Did you feel sorry for Sourav? 

 The issue isn?t of feeling sorry 

 or otherwise? It?s about giving confidence to a player who 

 hits a rough patch. I did speak to Sourav. 

 How is failure best handled? 

 It?s important to listen to your 

 own voice... It?s important to look at ending a poor run 

 as a challenge. 

 Has Kumble ever bowled better 

 than in the last 17-18 months? 

 Barring a few matches, he has 

 always been at his best? One gets to hear a lot about Anil 

 not spinning the ball and not doing this or that? Well, 

 now that he has 461 Test wickets, people must keep their 

 mouths shut. If they still are intent on criticising him, 

 they ought to first have a closer look at themselves. 

 No disrespect to Kumble, but 

 there are times when you look the best leg-spinner around? 

 (Laughs) I don?t have to 

 do Anil?s job and, so, enjoy myself? I like playing on the 

 batsman?s mind? My advantage, perhaps, is that I?m not a 

 predictable bowler. 

 Are you, then, the latest 

 man with the ?Golden Arm?? 

 I?ll have to bowl more regularly 

 to qualify for that! 

 Does the batsman in you work 

 even when you bowl? 

 Yes? I do think how the batsman 

 could respond. 

 What are the challenges for 

 Team India? 

 To keep improving? Keep getting 

 better in every aspect? 

 Given the way Mahendra Singh 

 Dhoni exploded in Vizag, he could be an asset both in the 

 immediate future and the 2007 World Cup? 

 I agree that 148 was a career-changing 

 innings, but Dhoni should be allowed to be himself and not 

 burdened with over-expectations. Let?s give him the confidence 

 to be consistent, not weigh him down. 

 The final question: Does John 

 Wright?s success as our coach suggest only a foreigner is 

 best suited for the job? 

 (After a pause) I think 

 it?s the individual who matters.

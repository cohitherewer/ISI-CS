 India trounce Holland 4-1

 Sandeep Singh converted two penalty corners 

Rotterdam: Dictating the pace and exchanges, defending champions India hammered Holland 4-1 to top pool D with an unbeaten record in the Rabobank Junior World Cup hockey meet here Saturday. 

It was a comprehensive victory for the Indians who were rarely troubled by the jittery Dutch. In fact, the Indians did as they pleased with Sandeep Singh converting two penalty corners (12th, 60th) and Tushar Khandekar chipping in with a brace (15th, 62nd). The lone Dutch goal came in the 38th when Sjcerd Steller converted a penalty corner against the run of play. 

India and Holland have already qualified for the second round that begins Sunday. India finished ahead of the Dutch, with three wins. 

Sunday, in the first second round match, India take on Spain. Indias pool also has England, Spain, Korea, Holland and Egypt. Pool F has Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia and Pakistan. 

India face Korea in their second game Tuesday and England Wednesday. 

Barring a brief spell early in the second-half when the Indians slackened a bit to allow the Dutch into the game, there was hardly a moment when the hosts looked good enough for a fight. 

Crossing over with a 2-0 advantage, the Indians slipped, conceding a penalty corner goal before tightening up and then stepping up the pace at the fag end of the game when they scored two more. 

In between, the Dutch goalkeeper Jaap Stockmann came up with a couple of fine saves to deny the Indians. Indian forwards were also guilty of missing some sitters. 

However, Sandeep Singh converted his second penalty corner of the match and almost immediately Khandekar capped a Hari Prasad-Nithin Kumar move to round off a good match for himself. 

Earlier, Germany, Malaysia and Belgium qualified for the second round in contrasting styles. 

Germany defeated Malaysia 7-5 in a rousing encounter for their second win, while Belgium edged past Chile 2-0 for their first win in the preliminary league, Henry Cavenaile (fifth) and Jerome Truyens (39th) being the scorers. 

The Malaysians, despite the defeat, advanced, thanks to Argentina handing out a third loss to South Africa (1-0). 

Later, Australia recorded their third win by overcoming Pakistan 3-2. (PTI)

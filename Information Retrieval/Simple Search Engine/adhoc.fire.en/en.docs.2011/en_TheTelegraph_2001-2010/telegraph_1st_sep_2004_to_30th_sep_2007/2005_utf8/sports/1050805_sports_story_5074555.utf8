 Davids brings hope to Spurs 

Gary Jacob

There is no doubt that Tottenham Hotspur ask a lot of their supporters. They have had to put up with countless years of mid-table mediocrity, but Edgar Davids has induced an image of rosy times ahead. Combative and dogged, the Holland midfielder is the type of player whom Tottenham supporters have been craving to return them to a time of style and substance and European football. 

Davids signed a two-year contract on Wednesday after completing a free transfer from Inter Milan, two years after he turned down a move to White Hart Lane. His experience and tenacity ? he has 73 caps for Holland and has played in four European Cup finals ? will bring leadership qualities to the club that have been lacking for the past couple of years. 

I hope that I can bring some good energy to the team, because they are very talented, Davids said. I hope that I can bring victories and that we are successful. My motivation is still to win and to learn about the game. No one should doubt that Davids, 32, possesses the skill and drive to meet the challenge, but his past career is littered with lack of discipline on the pitch and a divisive nature in the dressing-room.

 Serrafina gets her act right 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Serrafina took a level start and returned to winning ways. The Vijay Singh-trainee claimed the 1,200m Hyderabad Race Club Cup, on Saturday, in a facile manner from Noble Flash who had capitalised on the slow start of the four races in-a-row winner last month.

 Jockey C.Alford, who partnered the Razeen-Passed So Fast four-year-old to victory, also guided Regal Romance and Averroes to the winners enclosure to help the trainer with a treble. 

 Apprentice Melvyn Maseyk, too, had a profitable afternoon. He guided trainers Daniel Davids favourite Poetic Moment, and Errol Bhungards long-shot, Arabie, to easy wins in their respective events. The apprentice is learnt to be taking riding lessons from the former champion jockey, Nicky Bird, and looks much improved since his heavily curtailed four-month suspension which was supposed to have ended in March next year. However, Melvyn needs to work hard, and also learn to exercise greater control over rides.

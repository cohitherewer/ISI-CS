 Bagan under pressure vs Fransa today

- Return of Rennedy, Tomba to boost Calcutta team 

 A do-or-die match for Bhattacharya 

Margao: Former champions Mohun Bagan will be under pressure when they take on local outfit Fransa Pax in their first match of the second phase of the ninth National Football League for the ONGC Cup Tuesday at Nehru Stadium here. 

Placed seventh at the end of the first phase with 15 points from 11 matches, Bagan are in a tight spot and need to win the match Tuesday to start the second phase on a positive note. 

Mehtab Hussein, issued a one match suspension for double booking, will not play against Fransa. Defender Manitombi Singh and keeper Subrata Pal will also miss out since both are nursing injuries. 

But the return of defender Rennedy Singh and game-maker Tomba Singh will be a plus for Bagan. 

Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said the two away matches against Fransa and Salgaocar will be crucial for the team ?if we have to make upward progress. Any slip-up will put us in danger of relegation. 

?Fransa are a good side who have beaten us at home and I know it will be tough for us to beat them in their own backyard. But my boys have come well prepared and I have full faith in them that they will not let me down,? Bhattacharya said. 

Fransa also have 15 points from 11 matches but are placed above Bagan on better goal difference. 

Fransa will miss their defender Sanjeev Maria through double booking and Santa Singh through injury. However, the return of defender Cresson Antao will boost their defence. 

Fransa, who beat Bagan 2-1 in their away match, will look to carry on the advantage and will pin their hopes on foreign recruits Luis Aniweta, Joseph Ogor and Benjamin Ansah. 

?It will be a tough match which will be fought closely. Our team has given good account against them and we are looking to carry the same advantage Tuesday as we will go all out to collect full points,? Fransa coach Norbert Gonasalves said.

 Intikhab: Watch out for Shoaib

 - TOUR OF PAKISTAN 

 Indian selectors have taken a step back by picking Sourav, says Waqar 

 Intikhab Alam 

Vadodara: Rejuvenated pacer Shoaib Akhtar will create problems for India on their tour to Pakistan next month, former Pakistan captain and coach Intikhab Alam said here Wednesday. 

In the city as coach of Punjab, Intikhab said it would be difficult for Indian batsmen to play against reborn Shoaib who has improved his technique and performed well against England. 

India will have to watch him. Pakistan beat England, who had defeated Australia to reclaim the Ashes, and this has given confidence to the Pakistani team, Intikhab said. 

This Pakistani team is not the one that lost early last year. It is a more mature, experienced and united bunch of cricketers. 

He said the timing of the itinerary will have a bearing on Indias fortunes. 

It will be foggy and difficult to complete the quota of 90 overs in a day. In such circumstances, the first Test should have been played in Karachi, he opined. 

The weather conditions are different in January and February. Last time, India visited Pakistan in the month of March and April, and this will make a lot of difference. 

The outcome of the series will also depend on how many runs the opening pair put up, Intikhab said, adding that India were yet to find a settled pair. 

If the opening pair puts up good total then India will not find it difficult to score runs as they have a very good middle-order which Pakistan does not have, he said. 

Pakistan are better prepared to take on India this time and Inzmam-ul Haq is also in good form. The win against England has boosted the morale and confidence of the captain, he said. 

Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis believes Indian selectors have made a mistake by picking Sourav Ganguly, adds reports from Karachi. 

I think the Indian selectors have taken a step back by picking Sourav because he is certainly not in form. I saw him batting in the New Delhi Test (against Sri Lanka) and he was clearly struggling to put bat to the ball Waqar said. 

I dont think you can select any player who is in such bad form in his career. Somehow, he does not look capable of scoring runs, Waqar, who played 87 Tests and 262 one-day Internationals for Pakistan, said. 

Sourav was picked in the Pakistan-bound 16-man squad after being ignored for the third Test in Ahmedabad against Sri Lanka, despite scoring 39 and 40 in the second Test in Delhi. 

Waqar said the Indian selectors were short sighted and had proved that they cannot think like the Australians. 

The Australian selectors threw in three to four youngsters against South Africa instead of relying on big names. Teams are not built just on talent but how that talent is used and nurtured. 

The Indian team needs fresh legs and when you have a player as athletic, fit and confident like Mohammed Kaif, you need to throw him in the deep pan so that he can learn how to handle pressure, Waqar said. 

I am sure Pakistan must be very happy to find Sourav in the Indian team because there would be more pressure on the left-hander than what it was when he made his debut, Waqar, who took 373 Test and 416 ODI wickets, said.

 Atwal makes cut

 - TEXAS GOLF 

 Arjun Atwal 

San Antonio: Arjun Atwal fired an even par round to ensure yet another cut this week at the $3.5 million Valero Texas Open at the Lacantera Golf Club. 

Atwal, tied 23rd, had three bogeys and three birdies, the last of which came on the 18th hole to finish at par 70, to be four-under for 36 holes, giving himself a decent chance of touching a million dollar mark here. 

Atwal, with $955,666 in earnings, needs just under $45,000 for that feat, and that can be achieved if he finishes around 20th. 

The Indian began with bogeys on second and fifth, but made up one on eight. On the back nine, he birdied 14th, but bogeyed 15th before picking up a shot on 18th. 

A couple of good rounds on the last two days could see Atwal come up with yet another good finish in a season that has been very good so far. 

Atwal has now made 17 cuts in 18 starts this year, the lone exception being the PGA Championships, his only appearance in a major this year. He has had four finishes in top-10, including a tied second in Bell South Classic. 

Daniel Chopra missed the cut with a second round of par 70, as the cut came at one-under 139. He was two off the cut line. 

Dean Wilson, who had his career-best finish of third here last year, carded an 8-under 62 to take the lead. He is now 12-under 128 after two rounds, one stroke in front of Jeff Maggert and John Senden. 

Wilson is nine strokes in front of David Duval who made his first 36-hole cut of the season.

 Teams agree on 1-session format

Monaco: Formula One teams reached unanimous agreement here on Friday to change qualifying to a single session and hope to introduce the new system in time for next weekends European Grand Prix. 

The team chiefs met here to discuss a way to alter the current system, which sees the grid decided by aggregate times from two laps on Saturday and Sunday and has been unpopular with teams and the media. 

The new system will see just one session run on Saturday afternoon, the traditional slot for qualifying, and the running order will be decided on the results of the previous race with the winner running last in the session. 

The proposal has been put to the Formula One Commission and the World Council in a fax vote and the FIA said the results should be through in time to change for the next race at the Nurburgring.

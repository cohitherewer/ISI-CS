 Convulsions take Becks son to hospital

 Eriksson has allowed Beckham to be with son 

David Beckham, the England football captain, missed training on Tuesday for the World Cup qualifying match on Saturday after one of his sons was taken to the hospital for suffering convulsions for the second time in a week. 

The father of three, who was due in Manchester to join his teammates before the match against Austria, was allowed to stay in Madrid for an extra day while Romeo, three, underwent tests. 

Romeo, Beckhams second son, was taken to Madrids La Paz hospital on Saturday night. 

He was pictured in a tabloid newspaper outside the emergency ward, being cradled by his father and with his mother, Victoria. 

He was reportedly released, after tests, to rest at home. It is understood he was admitted again on Tuesday morning after a recurrence of the convulsions, although a hospital spokesman denied he was currently being treated there. 

In July Romeo was taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, close to the family home in Hertfordshire, by his mother after suffering a convulsion. 

Mrs Beckham, 31, was at home without her husband. Romeo, who was said to be running a fever, was kept in hospital for several hours for observation before being released. 

Beckham was given permission to stay in Spain on Tuesday by England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, while his teammates trained at Carrington, Manchester Uniteds training ground. 

Eriksson said: He will be back on Wednesday afternoon, so he will be on the training pitch on Thursday morning.

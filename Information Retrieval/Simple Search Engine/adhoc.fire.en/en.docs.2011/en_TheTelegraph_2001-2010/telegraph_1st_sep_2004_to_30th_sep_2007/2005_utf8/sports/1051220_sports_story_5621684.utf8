 Mukesh, Ghei in fray

New Delhi: Top professionals, including Mukesh Kumar, Ashok Kumar and Gaurav Ghei would be seen in action in the richest event of the golf season in India ? the Rs 25 lakh Vipul Indian Masters ? starting at the Classic Golf Resort in Gurgaon on Tuesday. 

Other players of repute taking part in the December 20-24 event are S. S. P. Chowrasia, Gurbaaz Mann, Firoz Ali, Amandeep Johl, Digvijay Singh and Sri Lankan Anura Rohana. The organisers are also expecting a player each from Fiji and Germany. 

The winner of the tournament, to be played on a modified stableford format, will receive Rs 3,95,500 while the runner-up will earn Rs 2,71,750, it was stated at a pre-event press conference here on Monday. 

Under the modified format, scores will be determined by a point system wherein a double-eagle or albatross will fetch eight points, an eagle five points, a birdie two points, a par no point, a bogey minus one and a double bogey or worse minus three points. 

The golfer with the highest points aggregate over 72 holes will triumph. (PTI)

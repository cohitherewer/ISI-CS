The Telegraph - Calcutta

 England post 267/8

Port Elizabeth: England?s Vikram Solanki top-scored with 66 but fast bowlers Andre Nel and Makhaya Ntini struck back for South Africa with three wickets each in the third one-day International on Friday. England, who won the toss in Port Elizabeth, made a competitive 267 for eight as all their batsmen made good starts. 

South Africa, 0-1 down after the second match of the seven-game series was tied, fought back to take five wickets for 60 in the last 11 overs. 

Solanki, playing in his first match of the series after replacing captain Michael Vaughan (upset stomach), scored his runs off 87 balls and hit four fours. Nel performed with his trademark aggression to take three for 49 while Ntini finished with three for 58.

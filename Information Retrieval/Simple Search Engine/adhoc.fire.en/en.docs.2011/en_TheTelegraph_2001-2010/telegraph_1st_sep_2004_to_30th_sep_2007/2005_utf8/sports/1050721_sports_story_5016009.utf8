 Johnson may lose his last medal

 The CAS ruling will be known on Thursday 

Raleigh (North Carolina): Michael Johnson could lose the last of his five Olympic gold medals five years after the Sydney Games when a court in Switzerland rules on a doping scandal on Thursday. 

The Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) will announce whether Johnson and his American teammates should forfeit their 4x400 metres golds because of a doping violation by squad member Jerome Young in 1999. 

Athletics world ruling body, the IAAF, has recommended to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the American squad be stripped of their medals. 

The recommendation came after CAS ruled in 2004 that Young should not have been allowed to run in Sydney because of the 1999 positive test for nandrolone that was overturned by a US appeals panel after a secret hearing. 

The US Olympic Committee (USOC) disagreed that the entire team should be penalised and appealed to CAS, whose decisions are binding, to order the IOC and IAAF to to desist in their efforts to change the results. 

If CAS upholds the USOC request, the medals stay with Johnson and teammates, three of whom have been hit with doping bans in recent years. 

If CAS disagrees, IAAF officials are expected formally to annul the Sydney result and ask the IOC to vote to redistribute the medals. Nigeria would then claim gold, Jamaica silver and the Bahamas bronze. 

If CAS turns down the American appeal, the IOC is likely to leave any formal decision to reallocate the medals to its executive board, which next meets in October in Lausanne. 

Johnson, now an agent who represents Olympic 400 metres gold medallist Jeremy Wariner among others, has said little publicly about the affair. 

When the IAAF made its 2004 recommendation to strip the medals, the 200 and 400 metres world record holder said there is nothing for me to do until the final decision is made. 

The 4x400 metres relay provided a fitting end to Johnsons astonishing Olympic career.

Shanghai: The sun finally shone on the HSBC Champions tournament, but for the Indians the third day was one of struggle as both Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa slipped down the leaderboard at the Sheshan Golf and Country Club here on Saturday. 

At the end of the third day, which is traditionally the movers day, Atwal was placed tied 21st, while Randhawa was further down at tied 45th after shooting one-over 73 and 75, respectively. 

Yet, there was one man out there ? Tiger Woods ? who virtually willed himself to play the kind of golf that is a dream for most others to come within a shot of the lead. 

Atwal ran into an error-filled stretch of three bogeys on the back nine from 11th to 13th, and then closed with another one. Two birdies on 14th and 15th averted a complete disaster as he finished with five-under 211 after three rounds. 

Randhawa, overnight 33rd, had just two birdies, but three bogeys on the front nine and another two on the back nine meant he ended up with a one-over 217. 

But up ahead, when the dust finally settled down, Woods was just one shot shy of the sole leader David Howell, who, barring the bogey on the testing eighth hole, had five birdies for a 68 that kept him at 16-under 200. 

Nick Hern was the one of the only two among the top 10 to have an error-free round of 67 that gave him a share of the second place with Woods. 

Keeping the Asian flag flying was Thaworn Wiratchant (69), who exploded on the final three holes with three birdies that brought him to 12-under 204 in sole fourth. 

Atwal, who has been playing well in patches, admitted he was miserable on the course on Saturday. 

It was a struggle. I played awful. To top it up, I hit it into the water on 18 for bogey. On the 18th, I had been down the slope in the last two days and I messed it up, but today I decided to go for it., said Atwal. 

I didnt play well at all. I was not very sharp on the golf course. If youre playing every week coming into the tournament, you can do it. But Ive been a bit rusty, said Atwal, who is playing only his second event in the last seven weeks. (PTI)

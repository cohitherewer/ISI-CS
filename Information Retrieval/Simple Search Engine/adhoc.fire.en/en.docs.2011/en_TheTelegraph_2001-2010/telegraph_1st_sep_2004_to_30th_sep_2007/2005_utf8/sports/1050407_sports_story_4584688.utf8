 Hari wins, up to joint fifth

Dos Hermanas: World junior champion P. Harikrishna outplayed Spain?s Miguel Illescas Cordoba in the fifth round to move up two places to joint fifth in the category-16 Dos Hermanas international chess tournament. 

After his loss to lowest ranked Ruben Felgaer of Argentina in the previous round, this turned out to be a fine comeback by Harikrishna with still four rounds to go. 

The lead position changed hands as Azerbaijani sensation Teimour Radjabov showed his mettle against world?s youngest-ever Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine. Radjabov took his tally to 3.5 points out of five games and was followed by Karjakin, Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia and Felgaer in the 10-player biennial round-robin event. 

Harikrishna was next in line alongwith defending champion Alexander Rustemov and Oleg Korneev of Russia on 2.5 points apiece, while top seed and pre-tournament favourite Alexey Dreev was pushed down to seventh spot after he lost to Azmaiparshvili. Playing the white side of a Slav defence, Harikrishna outplayed Cordoba in the middle game with some deft manoeuvres. 

The Spaniard lost an exchange for some counter play and Harikrishna knocked down his extra pawns in quick time to reach a double rook versus rook and minor piece endgame. The game lasted 44 moves. (PTI)

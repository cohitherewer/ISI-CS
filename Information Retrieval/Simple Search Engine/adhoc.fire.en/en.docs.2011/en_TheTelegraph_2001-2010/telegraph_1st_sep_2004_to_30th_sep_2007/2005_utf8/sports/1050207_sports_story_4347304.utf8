Madrid: Real Madrid notched their sixth win in a row on Saturday with a 4-0 victory over Espanyol that narrowed Barcelona?s lead at the top to four points. An unstoppable drive from Zinedine Zidane, two trademark opportunist strikes from skipper Raul and a debut goal from midfielder Thomas Gravesen sealed an emphatic victory. 

The race for the title has been effectively reduced to a two-horse affair after champions Valencia could manage only a 3-3 draw at struggling Real Sociedad, a result that left them nine points adrift of Real in third place. Espanyol are three points further back in fourth. 

At the Bernabeu, Real took the lead thanks to brilliant skill from Zidane. The Frenchman, in poor form of late, plucked the ball out of the air with his toe on the edge of the area, left Argentine defender Hugo Ibarra sprawling on the grass with a double step-over and then blasted into the roof of the net. 

It was not all Real and ?keeper Iker Casillas had to make two fine reflex saves to deny midfielder Ito midway through the half before Raul stretched his side?s lead with a typical strike. 

The Real Madrid skipper poked in on the rebound after Kameni had turned a venomous drive from the lively Figo on to the post on the half hour. 

Real eased up after the break, although Raul made it 3-0 when he stole in front of the Espanyol defence to divert a Santiago Solari pass into the net in the 75th minute. Former Everton midfielder Gravesen wrapped up a comprehensive victory five minutes from time when, after coming on as substitute, he guided a shot past Kameni from the edge of the area. 

In Italy, Serie A leaders Juventus suffered their second consecutive defeat when they lost 0-1 at Palermo on Saturday. The result left Juventus on 50 points from 23 matches, five ahead of champions AC Milan. Juventus dominated possession but were undone by a poor finishing and aggressive defending by the home side. 

Gunners win 

Defending champions Arsenal produced an impressive 3-1 victory at Aston Villa after Manchester United cut Chelsea?s Premier League lead to eight points with a 2-0 defeat of Birmingham City on Saturday. Arsenal, who are currently third, reminded critics as to why they romped to last season?s title without losing a game as they ripped Villa to shreds in a one-sided first half. (Reuters)

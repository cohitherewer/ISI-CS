 Harbhajan forces Gloucester to follow on

London: A fine spell of bowling by Harbhajan Singh helped Surrey to a commanding position against Gloucestershire on the penultimate day of the four-day Division I County Championship match in Bristol on Sunday. 

Harbhajan, who had made 84 in Surreys first innings score of 603, scalped four wickets for 51 runs as his side bowled out Gloucestershire for 288 and enforced the follow on. 

The Indian bowler took the wickets of J. A. Pearson, a P. R. Gidman, C. G. Taylor and J. Averis. Surrey took a first innings lead of 315 runs on the third day of the four-day match. Gloucestershire were 156 for three in their second essay with Craig Spearman scoring 47. Harbhajans 10 overs yielded 24 runs without a wicket. 

Elsewhere, Sourav Ganguly made 22 in Glamorgans second innings as his side slumped to a 10-wicket loss against Nottinghamshire. 

Sourav failed to add anything to his overnight score with his side being folded out for 214 in its second innings and Nottinghamshire notching up the required 57 runs for the big win at Trent Bridge. 

The Team India captain had made 47 runs in the first innings before claiming three wickets against the Stephen Fleming-led side.

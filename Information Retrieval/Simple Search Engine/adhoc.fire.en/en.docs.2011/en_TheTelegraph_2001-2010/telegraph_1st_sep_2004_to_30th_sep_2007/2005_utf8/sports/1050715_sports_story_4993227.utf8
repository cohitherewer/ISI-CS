 RCTC gets into action from Day I 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The opening day of the monsoon season, on Thursday, was serious business at the RCTC as the stewards and stipes got into action from the word go. They handed a 25-day calendar suspension to jockey Phillip Alford for his half-hearted riding of Daniel Davids Ocean Spirit in the curtain raiser, the 1,200m Alcalde Cup, which was eventually lifted by the hot favourite Royal Valour ? an Errol Bhungard-ward.

 In the following race, the Cherry Plate, the observant stewards also reprimanded apprentice Gajender Singh severely for not making sufficient effort on his ride, Pay Check ? a Daniel-trainee. However, the stewards missed out on the heroics of jockey Md Amil who manoeuvred El Cids victory in the feature event, the Zipper Cup.

 Partnering Tarak Jaiswals Common Spirit, a speedster, Amil took almost the entire field wide ? six-horses ? leaving El Cid and his jockey, apprentice Vinay Jaiswal, to avail of a yawning gap along the rails. Daniels favourite, Magical Strike was the chief sufferer. The saddle of the 6-4 favourite also slipped during the race.

 Amil, however, guided another of Taraks less fancied runners, Shes A Star, to a facile win in the Arezzo Handicap. 

 Visiting jockey G. Ross, who claimed successive events right after the start, proved a big let down on the rest of his favourites.

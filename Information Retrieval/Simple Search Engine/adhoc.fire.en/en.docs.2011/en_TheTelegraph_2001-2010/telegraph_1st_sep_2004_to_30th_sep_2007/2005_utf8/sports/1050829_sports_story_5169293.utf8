 Federer the clear favourite

New York: Theyve changed the colour of the courts at the US Open for this years tournament starting on Monday. But, if form prevails, Roger Federer will once again be crowned mens champion. 

Not since the heyday of Pete Sampras has there been such a hot favourite going into the final Grand Slam of the season, and the Swiss star only reaffirmed his credentials with a straight sets win over Andy Roddick in the final of the Cincinnati Masters last Sunday. 

There had been a tiny question mark over Federers preparations for New York prior to that event, as he had not played since his straight sets win over Roddick in the Wimbledon final in early July. That self-imposed pause was to recharge the batteries and recover from a painful foot ailment that had dogged him since the beginning of the year. 

He started edgily at Cincinnati, but quickly got back to his stride, and by the time he crushed Roddick in the final, he once again looked a class above anyone else. 

He goes into his sixth US Open campaign with an 18-match winning streak. He has not lost since early June. He has also won the last 22 finals he has played in, an all-time record, and has been world No. 1 for 81 weeks. 

Roddick not only lost again to Federer in Cincinnati, but his hopes this year were dented as he limped away with an injury in his right foot. He was undergoing treatment and hoped to be fully fit on time. 

But fully fit or not, such is the hold that Federer has over him ? he leads their head-to-heads 10-1, including the last six in a row ? Roddicks best chance would come if someone else removed his nemesis from his path. 

Injuries are also complicating the chances of two other players cited at the start of the year as the likeliest threats to the Swiss players crown. 

Last years beaten finalist Lleyton Hewitt has been beset by a succession of injuries that have sidelined him for much of the year, while Marat Safin has been struggling with a niggling knee injury since before the French Open in May. 

There are doubts too over evergreen Andre Agassi who has made the US Open the focal point of the season. Agassi withdrew from Cincinnati in an apparent bid to pace himself and protect the injury he has been carrying to the sciatic nerve in his back. 

That leaves Spains Rafael Nadal, as the fittest and potentially most dangerous rival for Federer. The 19-year-old has won nine titles this year, the same as Federer, and he has been seeded second, which means he cannot face the reigning champion before the final. 

Nadal lost in the first round in Cincinnati but that allowed him to return to his home-base and ready himself for Flushing Meadow where he has been eliminated in the second round in his only two campaigns till date. 

He was the last player to defeat Federer in a four-set semi-final of the French Open in early June. After flunking at Wimbledon, this will be his best chance to show that he can prevail on a surface other than clay.

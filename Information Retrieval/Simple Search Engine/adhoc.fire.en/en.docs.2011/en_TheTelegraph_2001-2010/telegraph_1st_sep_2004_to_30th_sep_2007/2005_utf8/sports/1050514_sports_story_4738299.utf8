 Toyota may face sanctions

London: High-flying Toyota may face sanctions from Formula Ones governing body after it emerged on Friday that the team has competed for years without the correct paperwork. 

The matter is under investigation, said an FIA spokesman. He would not speculate on what action might be taken. 

A report suggested a worst-case scenario of the team being stripped of their points for the first four races of the season, including their first podium finishes. 

However, Toyota motorsport president John Howett hoped that would not be the case for what he described as a simple administrative error that had now been corrected. 

If they apply a sanction, we have to accept it, he said. The FIA has the right to apply sanctions but I hope it will be commensurate with the size of the error. We have tried to be completely transparent. This has been blown out of proportion to what we see as an unintentional and fairly minor error relating to the paperwork. 

Teams must have a competition licence issued by their national authority before they can get a superlicence, which is issued by the FIA. Howett said Toyota had always had a super licence but had failed to renew their competition licence since 2000. 

Toyota made their GP debut in 2002 after deferring their entry for a year. 

The matter came to light only when Toyota sought to appeal against a 25-second penalty for a pitstop offence that pushed German driver Ralf Schumacher out of the points at the San Marino GP.

 Hurst wants England vs Germany final

Leipzig: Geoff Hurst, who scored a hattrick for England in the 1966 World Cup final, wants to see another final showdown with the Germans 40 years on. 

My only wish for the World Cup is that England reach the final and they play Germany, Hurst said on Thursday, the day before the draw for the 2006 finals. 

Hurst is the only player to have scored a hattrick in a World Cup final. His three goals in their 4-2 win over West Germany at Wembley on July 30, 1966 gave England their sole World Cup triumph. 

The former striker believes England can expect at least a place in the semi-finals next year. 

England have only reached the semi-finals once since 1966 ? losing to West Germany on penalties in 1990. 

In the same period, the Germans have reached the World Cup final five times, winning in 1974 and 1990 and losing in 1982, 1986 and 2002. 

Hurst believes England now have a chance to improve on their poor record. 

I think we are one of four of five teams who are capable of winning it, said Hurst. Id be very disappointed if we didnt get at least to the semi-finals. 

Youve got a fantastic player in Wayne Rooney and a scorer in Michael Owen whos second to none, he said.

 Murali to miss Lara challenge

Colombo: Sri Lankan spin ace Muttiah Muralidharan on Tuesday confessed he will miss the challenge of bowling to West Indies batting great Brian Lara as he returns to Test cricket after almost a year off with injury. 

The West Indies are in the island nation to play two Tests and a triangular one-day series also featuring India, without key batsmen Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle owing to a contracts row. 

Bowling to Brian is always a big challenge, said Muralidharan, 33, set to play his first Test after an 11-month layoff due to shoulder injury. 

But unfortunately, he is not in this squad as they (the West Indies) have some internal problems. 

Lara was the lone batsman to tame Muralidharan in his own backyard when the West Indies toured Sri Lanka in 2001, aggregating an astonishing 688 runs in three Tests. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Young Chawla called for nets

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: Promising Uttar Pradesh leggie Piyush Chawla, who will turn 17 on Christmas eve, has been asked by the senior national selectors to report in Rajkot and bowl at nets both there and in Vadodara, venues for the last two ODIs against Sri Lanka. 

Given the mood to try out youngsters, this call-up cant be treated as insignificant. 

Chawla, who recently made his first-class debut in the Duleep Trophy, had just about landed in New Delhi (from Aurangabad) late on Sunday when he received a call from Central Zone selector Gopal Sharma. 

The Moradabad-based teenager, who reached Mumbai (en route to Rajkot) on Monday, told The Telegraph: It feels nice and Im looking forward to bowling at some of the stalwarts of the present times... 

Chawla idolises Anil Kumble and is fascinated by Shane Warne. In the not too distant future, many could perhaps look up to him.

 Bogota: Diego Maradona will decide within the next few days whether to undergo surgery in Colombia to reduce his weight, his doctor said.

 Maradona, who was treated for cocaine addiction in Cuba in January, initially denied rumours that he had travelled to Cartagena on the Caribbean coast to explore a weight-loss operation, saying he simply wanted to rest. But his doctor, Francisco Holguin, told local radio on Thursday that experts have been performing medical tests on Maradona at Cartagena?s clinic, and deemed the portly 44-year-old fit for the operating table.

 ?For any patient, deciding whether to go ahead with this type of operation is difficult,? Holguin said, adding that a decision was expected in the next two days. 

 London: The 2006 FA Cup final, the first match scheduled for the new Wembley Stadium, will be played on Saturday May 13, the Football Association said on Thursday.

 The final will be the last game of the English domestic season barring the lower league playoffs, providing a boost for England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who had asked for ample preparation time for the 2006 World Cup should his side qualify.

 The England team will now have a four-week break between the FA Cup final and the start of the tournament in Germany. 

 London: Manchester City?s England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips faces surgery on a knee injury that will sideline him for up to two months.

 Wright-Phillips, one of the most exciting talents in English football, tore the cartilage in his right knee in a 3-2 comeback win over Premier League rivals Norwich City on Monday, the club said on its website.

 His injury will also be a blow to England, ruling him out of their World Cup qualifiers against Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan at the end of the month.

 City manager Kevin Keegan said: ?Of course it is a blow to lose Shaun. The medical opinion is that it is a six to eight week rehab process.?

 Sao Paulo: Former Argentina captain and coach Daniel Passarella has taken charge of free-spending Brazilian club Corinthians.

 ?I?m accepting a big responsibility. There will be a lot of pressure but that doesn?t scare me,? said Passarella, who has won league titles as a coach with River Plate in Argentina and Monterrey in Mexico.

 He replaces Tite who resigned after Corinthians, whose new British-based investors MSI are spending heavily on their squad, lost the local derby against Sao Paulo 1-0 on Sunday. 

 They also lost 3-0 to Brazilian champions Santos three weeks ago.

 ?I know Brazil is one of the hardest countries in which to be a trainer,? Passarella told a news conference. Corinthians are fifth in the Paulista championship standings. 

 Berlin: The German Football Association (DFB) ordered a regional league game be replayed on Thursday as it believes a referee implicated in Germany?s match-fixing scandal sought to influence the result.

 Hertha Berlin Amateurs beat Arminia Bielefeld amateurs 2-1 in August 2004, under the control of Dominik Marks, a referee since provisionally suspended by the DFB over match-fixing allegations.

 Germany has been rocked by revelations from referee Robert Hoyzer, who has admitted fixing games for money and has implicated several others.

 Akram: Im not coach material

 - Pathan seeks advice 

 Akram 

Islamabad: Wasim Akram, who had drawn criticism for helping seamer Irfan Pathan during a tour of Australia last year, has said in no unclear terms that if given a chance he would coach the Pakistan team in future but not the Indians. 

Ill coach Pakistan but not India, the legendary left-arm seamer said at a function in Karachi. 

Akram said that when he had helped out Pathan with some bowling tips he had been surprised at the reaction from some quarters over this development. After the reaction I saw I know that the day I coach India people will kill me. 

Akram, however, soon added that he did not envisage to see himself as a cricket coach in near future. 

I dont see myself being a coach since to be honest Im not an organised person. And to make a good coach you need to be as organised as say like Bob Woolmer, Dav Whatmore and John Wright, he was quoted as saying in a local daily. 

Akram said he was hugely impressed with Pathan after the Indian sought his advice ahead of making his County debut in England. 

Pathan, making his county debut for Middlesex, called up Akram recently asking for tips on how to bowl in English conditions and also discussed about his poor form, the left-arm bowling legend said. 

No one like say (Mohammed) Sami or Shoaib (Akhtar) have ever called me up for some advice but Irfan called up as he is going to play for Middlesex and wanted some tips on how to bowl on English pitches, Akram said. 

Akram also made it clear that he had no regrets leaving cricket when he did. 

I left cricket at the right time and Im happy and content with my life now because when people say they miss me, its a great feeling for me. 

On Shoaib, Akram advised him to work on being more acceptable in the team by the other players. 

He is a match winner but he needs to work on being popular with the other players. He is not a bad person ? I know that, but he needs to make himself acceptable in the team, he said. (PTI)

We must get out of the bad phase fast

Overdrive

There are times in Formula 1 when there is only a 

single-week gap between two races and this is one such instance. I had a poor 

performance in Monaco last weekend, which saw me retire early. Actually, for that 

race, the problems started as early as the practice session on Thursday when I 

hit the barrier.

The Monaco circuit is very unforgiving and even a 

slightest mistake can put you out of the race. Due to that mistake, I lost a lot 

of time and had to play catch-up all weekend. Also, on the opening lap, I had 

a coming together with Ralf Schumacher and that didnt help the cause much.

The tyres and the car were a real handful at the Monaco 

circuit and it made driving very tough. I was facing a lot of problems with the 

car and we had to eventually call it a day very early in the race.

The Nuerburgring circuit is another one where I have 

never raced before. However, one good thing about this track is that it is pretty 

straightforward and easy to get a hang of. 

At the practice session on Friday, I hit a cone and 

damaged my car slightly, which saw me do only seven laps whereas some of the other 

drivers managed 30.

We are going through a bad phase and need to get out 

of it as fast as possible. We have made some changes in the car and hopefully 

it might change our fortunes.

The qualifying process has changed and now we will 

only have one round on Saturday, which will determine the grid position. It will 

be harder, because we will now be qualifying with the race level fuel which makes 

the car about 90 kg heavier, that is, about 20 per cent of the car weight. Since 

the Formula 1 cars are very light, a change in fuel load changes the entire handling 

of the car.

The BAR Hondas will make their return and though they 

missed the last couple of races, they have been practising and we can expect them 

to deliver strong performance. The real battle will, of course, be between the 

McLarens and the Renaults. They are again looking strong for the race.

We will be launching our new car before the French 

Grand Prix and with that car we can hopefully expect to challenge the Saubers 

and Red Bull Racing team. For the time being though, we are hoping to give a strong 

performance at Neurburgring and are aiming to complete the race. TCM

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Turning point of my career

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: This tournament is going to be the turning point of my career, said Smriti Mehra Guffin who created history by winning the first ever womens professional tournament in the country ?? the Hero Honda Skins ?? at the par-72 DLF Country and Golf Club in Gurgaon on Saturday. 

According to information received here the Calcutta girl, now based in the US, clinched her first professional title in India with a tally of seven skins and a purse of $7,650. 

 She turned pro in 1995 and this was the fifth title of her career. Smriti won the Vermont Classic in the US in 1996, which was her first title. 

This kind of tournament may change the scenario of womens golf in the country. Playing with some top players like Hilary Lunke (the 2003 US Open Champion) and Heather Daly Donofrio (President Tour Player of the USLPGA) was a great experience. The level of competition is high and the best comes out of you, said a jubilant Smriti. 

Donofrio finished second to take home $4,700.

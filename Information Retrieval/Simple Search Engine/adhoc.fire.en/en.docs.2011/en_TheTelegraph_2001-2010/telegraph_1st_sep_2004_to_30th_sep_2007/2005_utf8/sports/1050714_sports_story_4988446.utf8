Mourinho turns on the heat

- Arsenal have received preferential treatment in league fixtures: Chelsea coach

A new season approaches, same old Jose Mourinho. In 

his first press conference of the 2005-06 campaign on Tuesday, the outspoken Chelsea 

manager again raged against the perceived injustices in the world. Not a ball 

has been kicked, but Mourinho had clearly been simmering over the summer break.

The Football Association has sharply criticised Mourinho 

for his comments about Arsenal and their vice-chairman David Dein. At a 

time when the football authorities are striving to improve behaviour, some of 

the views expressed by Mourinho are unnecessary, unhelpful, bad for the image 

of the game and inaccurate, the FA said in a statement on Wednesday.

Arsenal, Chelseas London rivals, Arsene Wenger, 

their manager, and David Dein, their vice-chairman, were his chief targets. The 

attack on Dein was particularly acerbic, Mourinho saying that one man should not 

simultaneously hold the positions of vice-chairman at a club and the FA.

It had been going swimmingly. Chelsea had unveiled 

their new centenary home kit and Asier Del Horno, the ?8 million recruit from 

Athletic Bilbao, spoke encouragingly about his new club.

But then Mourinho, questioned about Chelseas 

image off the pitch, launched into a tirade about devils and angels 

that ranked alongside the seagulls and trawlers rant of Eric Cantona.

Mourinho is enraged by the tapping-up 

scandal involving Ashley Cole, the Arsenal defender, that was resolved last month. 

Chelsea accepted their punishment, but the appeals of Mourinho and Cole against 

their fines are to be heard by the FA Premier League this month.

Mourinho sailed close to the wind ? and possibly to 

an FA charge of bringing the game into disrepute ? when he said that Arsenal were 

hardly innocents abroad.

He cited reports last week that, during a visit to 

Brazil a fortnight ago, Wenger had spoken to Julio Baptista, the Brazil and Seville 

forward.

Seville officials had considered a complaint to FIFA, 

the sports world governing body, but have yet to carry out their threat.

Asked if he was worried about the moral perception 

of Chelsea, Mourinho said: No. What concerns me is the way you approach 

similar situations in a very different way. Because some are treated as devils 

and some are treated as angels. And I dont think that we are so ugly to 

be treated like devils and I dont think Mr Wenger and Mr David Dein are 

so beautiful to be treated like angels.

You know, I went to Brazil on holiday, I didnt 

go to Brazil to chase players and speak with them behind the clubs.

But when I read the papers, its completely different. 

The devils and the angels.

Warming to his theme, Mourinho suggested that Arsenal 

may have received preferential treatment in the allocation of fixtures in the 

Premier League.

The first five of Arsenals six matches, immediately 

after they have played in a group game of the Champions League, are at Highbury.

In contrast, Chelsea have five away games and against 

distinctly tougher opponents.

Is Mourinho the only one who can look at the 

fixtures and find something very strange? he said. You dont find anything 

strange in that?

Mourinho suggested that Dein should stand down from 

his position with the FA.

A person who works in the club shouldnt 

work in the FA, Mourinho said. The FA is the FA, clubs are clubs.

Mourinho declined to confirm that Chelsea are in the 

closing stages of buying Shaun Wright-Phillips, the Manchester City winger, for 

about ?20 million and Michael Essien, the Lyons midfield player, for about ?17 

million.

 RCTC finances in a shambles 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The RCTCs finances are in a shambles but the club officials feel the situation is not that alarming. The recent quitting of its chief financial officer (CFO), Debashis Chakraborty, has, however, left racing circles speculating that all is not well with the club.

 The club has incurred a loss of nearly Rs 1 crore in its last financial year, and it may need to shell out the same amount towards the settlement of provident fund dues of the syces. The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (RPFC) has already served a notice in this regard. To top it all, the state government is asking for a 2 per cent interest on its unpaid commission which is to the tune of Rs 7.5 crore.

 Chakraborty was not available for comment, but an RCTC official contested that the CFO has left the RCTC for greener pastures. The official also disputed claims that the club has incurred some losses. Accounts are yet to audited. I dont understand how can one determine profit and losses. Yes, more stake money was paid out because of the increased number of race events last season, said Boman Parakh, secretary, RCTC. 

 Parakh, however, failed to explain why the RCTC had stopped renting out its Russell Street lawns for parties. The club had been earning nearly Rs 50 lakh annually in this way. The practice, it was learnt, was done away with on an RCTC stewards objection because he could not park his car when some party was on.With regard to the provident fund dues, Parakh said that it is the principle employers of syces ? trainers in this case ? who were responsible for fulfilling this obligation. However, a reputed labour law expert says there is no escape for the RCTC. They are the principle employers in this case.

 Trainer dead: Francis Anthony Rodrigues (Sr), a jockey-turned trainer, died of a massive cerebral haemorrhage on Friday. He was 72 and was the first product of the RCTCs apprentice jockey school in the year 1948.

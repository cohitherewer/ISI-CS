 New Delhi: Weightlifter Pratima Kumari has decided to challenge the decision of International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) to uphold her ban. ?We have sent a letter of intent (LoI) to the IWF challenging the decision of their hearing panel,? Pratima?s lawyer Sushil Salwan said on Friday.

 Salwan said the weightlifter was not satisfied with the decision of the IWF and would take recourse to the provision of filing an appeal against the ban within next 21 days. ?We will be filing an appeal by Tuesday,? he said. The IWF had rejected Pratima?s appeal early this week and Salwan had accused the IWF of acting on pre-meditated line.

 St Petersburg: Russia?s Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the Mondial Australian women?s hardcourt tournament with a strained right shoulder. Sharapova, 18, suffered the injury in the second half of the season and failed to add to her 2004 Wimbledon title.

 ?I am very disappointed to have to withdraw because my right shoulder is not yet ready to allow me to compete at the tour level,? the world number four said. ?The number one priority for me at this time is getting 100 per cent healthy to compete again,? she added.

 Bristol: Roy Jones Junior and Bernard Hopkins agreed to a March 11 fight, representatives of both fighters said. The fight would be a rematch of a 1993 bout, which Jones won by unanimous decision.

 ?I think it?s very exciting. Bernard is very happy about it and so is Roy. It?s fantastic,? Hopkins? promoter said. The 12-round light heavyweight fight was still without a venue.

 ?We have a deal,? Jones? adviser Brad Jacobs said on Friday. ?I have Richard?s word that Hopkins is in. And Roy told me, ?let?s go.? Everybody reviewed what was on the table and were able to agree to it.?

 Hopkins (46-4-1, 32 KOs), who turns 41 in January, made a middleweight-record 20 title defences before losing by decision twice to Jermain Taylor this year. Jones (49-4, 38 KOs), who turns 37 on January 16, is a former middleweight, super middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight champion.

 Yaounde: Barcelona striker Samuel Eto?o will stand down from club commitments in order to play for Cameroon at next month?s African Nations Cup, state radio quoted him as saying on Friday.

 The 24-year-old has been in prolific form for his club, scoring 17 goals in as many games to help the champions top the Primera Liga table, and is shortlisted for what would be a record-breaking third African Footballer of the Year award.

 ?It has never been a question for me not to go to Egypt (for the African Nations Cup),? Cameroonian state radio reported Eto?o as saying in Garoua during a Christmas trip to his home country.

 ?We players of the national team are carrying the hearts of Cameroonians in our blood. It is our duty to make them happy... I am proud to defend the colours of my country whenever I am called upon and in all playing grounds around the world.?

 Budapest: Lajos Baroti, who coached Hungary in four World Cups, has died at the age of 91.

 ?He was the best coach in our history,? Hungarian football association president Imre Bozoky said on Friday. ?He has most appearances as national coach (117) but that is not what made him special. His love of the game unbelievable.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Match still 50-50, says Younis

Calcutta: Younis Khan believes his unbeaten 108 is ?special?. 

?The team needed it? Moreover, it?s a Test against India and at the Eden. It has to be special,? said Younis after the second day?s play. 

?Everyone in the team backed me, and a day before the Test here, Inzamam openly favoured my inclusion. I appreciate everything the team did for me, and in return, I wanted to make sure that I did not let them down. That I have managed to repay the faith they showed in me is the most important achievement today,? the vice-captain explained. 

But he did not wish to say that the visitors were on top. ?It?s a little too early to make any comment. We have had only two days? play and everything will depend on how things go tomorrow. If we can bat till tea, we will definitely be well placed. At the moment it is 50-50,? Younis said. 

Did he make any technical changes after the twin failures in Mohali. ?A little bit, nothing too much. A lot of people have said in the past that I bat slowly, but I have always batted positively? In this innings, I wanted to spend time in the middle, and in the end that helped.? 

Yousuf Youhana was also all praise for his teammate. ?Younis was under pressure to perform? It?s an important innings for him.? 

Youhana doesn?t want to term his innings special. ?This century is not something special. I try to be normal even if I score a zero. 

?Our target was to stay at the wicket. Runs would then come automatically??

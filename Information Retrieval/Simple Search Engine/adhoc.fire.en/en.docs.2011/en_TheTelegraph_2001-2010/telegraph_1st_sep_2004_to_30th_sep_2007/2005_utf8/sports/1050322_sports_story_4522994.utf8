 Rain plays spoilsport

Chandigarh: The fourth day of the Ranji Trophy plate division semi-final between Haryana and Jharkhand was washed Monday out due to heavy rains. 

Haryana, who made 453 in the first innings before bowling out the rivals for 308, were 26 for no loss in their second essay at stumps on Sunday. 

With just a day remaining, the match seemed like heading for a draw and in that case, Haryana, who took a 145-run first innings lead, would book a berth in the March 30 to April 3 final. 

For Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni blasted a century but couldn?t prevent his side from conceding the all-important first innings lead. 

Brief scores 

Haryana 453 and 26 for no loss (Chetan Sharma 18 n.o.). Jharkhand 308.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Team to arrive in batches

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Thirteen Indian cricketers, plus the wives of V.V.S. Laxman and Virender Sehwag, left Harare for home via Johannesburg on Friday morning. 

The only remaining player ? Irfan Pathan ? is going to Australia. 

Ajit Agarkar, it may be recalled, came back home earlier this week. 

The support staff (including coach Greg Chappell) and manager Amitabh Choudhary will leave for home on Saturday. The whole team couldnt leave together due to the unavailability of tickets, owing to a change in travel plans.

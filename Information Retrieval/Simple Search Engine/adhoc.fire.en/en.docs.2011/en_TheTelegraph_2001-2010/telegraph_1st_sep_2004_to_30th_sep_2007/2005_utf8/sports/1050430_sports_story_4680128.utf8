 EPGA diplomas for Indian coaches

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: All seven Indian National Golf Academy (a concept just about taking shape) coaches have just returned from Italy, armed with pretty impressive diplomas that will allow them to coach domestic coaches. 

The basic idea of the seven ? Indrajit Bhalotia of Calcutta, Romit Bose, Nonita Lall, Ajay Gupta, Karan Bindra (all Delhi), Jessie Grewal (Chandigarh) and Vijay Dibecha (Bangalore) ? getting this specialised European PGA course (held at the Arzaga Golf Club near Verona in March) was to be able to spread the techniques to more areas in the country, especially at junior levels. 

?The place is the headquarters of the European Professional Golf Union?s training centres, and the course was conducted by Donata Di Ponziano, director of the EPGA?s technical committee,? said Bhalotia here Friday. 

Initially, though, the Sports Authority of India had cleared only Bhalotia, Gupta and Lall. Then IGU council member Dilip Thomas stepped in to fund the rest. Hence the Union has now a full complement of foreign-trained coaches. 

What did they learn? ?Communication with our wards, in the main, apart from golf technique, fitness, turf management, sports psychology and equipment management,? said Bhalotia. 

?But the biggest thing we learnt was that our coaches are in no way inferior to theirs. They even use ancient software to analyse a swing, say, than at the ProTouch academy I run out of the RCGC.?

 Boycott threat by Manipur 

Imphal: All Manipur Football Association (AMFA) on Saturday warned to boycott forthcoming national tournaments as the AIFF did not accept its protest against a controversial decision during the Santosh Trophy quarter final match between Manipur and Goa on Thursday. 

The decision to boycott the forthcoming under-19 and under-14 tournaments was taken during an executive committee meeting of the AMFA here on Friday, an AMFA spokesman said on Saturday. 

He said the referee Saji Kouriyan had allowed Goa to immediately restart the game while Manipur scored a goal through Tomba and some of his teammates were still in the Goa half. Climax Laurence equalised for Goa from that move. 

The spokesman said: As per Rule VIII of the laws of the game, no match could be restarted while players of one side were still in the half of their opponents and, in this case, Kouriyan allowed Goa to restart the game while four Manipur players were still in Goas half.

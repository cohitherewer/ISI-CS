 Taibu to play in Bangladesh 

London: Former Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu has said he is heading to Bangladesh to resume his cricketing career. 

The 22-year-old, who resigned the national captaincy last week in protest against the alleged maladministration of Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) chairman Peter Chingoka and managing director Ozias Bvute, is due to leave Zimbabwe on Sunday, to play club cricket in Dhaka. 

However, the wicketkeeper also told a website that he would return to international cricket provided certain changes were made. 

It would not take long if the right people are put in place, because some players who left are willing to come back if Bvute and Chingoka leave. I would be glad to come back and play. 

Taibu has called for the removal of Bvute and Chingoka because they are trying to bring in people like Themba Mliswa (the man who allegedly made threats against Taibu) and Tavengwa Mukuhlani (another of their supporters) onto the board, and we all understand that they are wrong for Zimbabwe Cricket.

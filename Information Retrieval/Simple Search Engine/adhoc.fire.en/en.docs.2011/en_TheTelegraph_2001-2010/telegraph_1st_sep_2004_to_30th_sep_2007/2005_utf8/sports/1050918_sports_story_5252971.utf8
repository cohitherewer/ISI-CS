The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pressure will be on Shikha, feels Fuda

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: She might have been the doubles partner of Neha Uberoi in last years Wimbledon juniors, but at the Netaji Indoor Stadium she will face the senior sister Shikha in the singles first round of the WTA Sunfeast Open on Monday. 

Ryoko Fuda of Japan, currently ranked 185, is not worried about facing a competitor who is 34 steps ahead of her. 

While speaking to The Telegraph on Saturday, Fuda said: I will just go there and play my best. I need to take it game by game. At the moment I am not bothered about whom I am facing. The 19-year-old turned professional in December 2003 and she has played pretty well to move to 185 and it will take a lot from her if she wants to make it big in this meet. 

On how she is feeling about her first match, she said: There is pressure but I think it is more on Shikha as she has to perform to the expectations of the home crowd.

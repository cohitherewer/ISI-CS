 India held goalless 

New Delhi: Indias hopes of making it to the semi-finals of Junior World Cup Hockey for women in Santiago, Chile, suffered a major setback when they were held to a goalless draw by Argentina. 

The Indians dominated the pool F encounter played on Sunday but poor finishing cost them dear, according to information received here. 

They would now have to win their next two matches against Scotland and Korea and hope for other results to go their way if they have to make it to the last four of the competition. 

India have four points from their three matches so far, winning one and drawing two. 

The Indian girls made repeated forays against the Argentines who seemed tired after their outing against Korea whom they beat 1-0. 

But the forwards failed to find the net, resulting in the points being shared. 

The draw took the South American team to the top of the group F with seven points, one clear of Korea and Germany. India, who had the chance of reducing the gap, are currently fifth in group standings.

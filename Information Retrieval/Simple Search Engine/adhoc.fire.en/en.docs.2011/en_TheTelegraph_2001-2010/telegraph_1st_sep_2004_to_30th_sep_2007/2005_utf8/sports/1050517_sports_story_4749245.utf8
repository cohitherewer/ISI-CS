 Lanka await India decision

Colombo: Sri Lanka have delayed naming their new cricket coach until prospective candidates have been considered by India, the chairman of the government-appointed administration team said on Monday. 

We are trying to finalise the appointment, but it wont be possible before the Indians finish their interviews this week, Jayantha Dharmadasa, chairman of the committee running Sri Lanka Cricket, said. 

We must realise that Indian cricket board is the richest in the world and coaching the Indian team is a prestigious job. 

Since they (BCCI) kept things on a hold, our candidates wanted some time as well. 

Dharmadasa had earlier set a May 13 deadline for naming a new coach. 

Sri Lanka hope to fly in Australians Greg Chappell, Tom Moody and Dean Jones to Colombo to hold their own discussions. 

Moody, 39, is regarded as the overwhelming favourite for the Sri Lankan job after being recommended by pace spearhead Chaminda Vaas.

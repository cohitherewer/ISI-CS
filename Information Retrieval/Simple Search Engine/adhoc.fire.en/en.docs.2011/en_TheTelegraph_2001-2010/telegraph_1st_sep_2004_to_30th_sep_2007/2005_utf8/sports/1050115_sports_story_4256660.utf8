 Meeting reconvenedon Jan. 27 

 - BCCI agm in Calcutta 

Chennai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reconvened its incomplete annual general meeting on January 27 in Calcutta. 

BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said the meeting was being held as per direction of the Supreme Court so that the tenure of the last Board, headed by Jagmohan Dalmiya, could come to an end and the new Board takes over. 

?Notice to the affiliated members of the Board on the January 27 meeting and venue would be sent today,? Nair said here on Friday. 

In its order on Monday, the Supreme Court had directed the BCCI to expeditiously convene the incomplete AGM for the purpose of taking over of the new Board headed by Ranbir Singh Mahendra. 

?The AGM should conclude its proceedings even if it cannot transact business on the agenda pertaining to nomination of Dalmiya as the patron-in-chief and his nomination as the representative of BCCI to ICC,? the court?s common order had said. 

Asked whether any other meeting of any standing committee, like the working committee, would be held prior to the January 27 meeting, Nair said, ?first we must have this meeting concluded as per court directive?. 

Meanwhile, BCCI sources said all the minutes as per the approved agenda were discussed on September 30 itself and all standing committees, including those of tours and fixtures, had also been set up after elections on September 29. However, none of the members had been inducted into any committee so far, they said. 

?Considering this, the January 27 meeting should go through without any hitch, but it is not known as yet whether Mr Dalmiya?s nomination as patron-in-chief could be discussed or approved due to certain legalities involved,? the sources said.

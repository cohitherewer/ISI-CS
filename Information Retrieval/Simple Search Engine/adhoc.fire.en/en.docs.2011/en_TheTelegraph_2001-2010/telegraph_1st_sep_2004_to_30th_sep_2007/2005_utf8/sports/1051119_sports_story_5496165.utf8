 Firoz Ali in eighth spot

Hanoi: Firoz Ali, whose sole Asian Tour triumph came as far back as 1998, shot a four-under 66 that brought him into the top-10 of the $ 200,000 Carlsberg Masters. 

Firoz is now lying eighth with a total of one-under as Thaworn Wiratchant, the Asian Order of Merit leader, moved into joint lead with Frankie Minoza of the Philippines at the midway stage of the tournament. 

There were three Indians in top-10 and five of them made the cut. Firoz was all set for one of the best cards of the day as he was six-under when he came to the 18th tee.

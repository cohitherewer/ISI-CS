 Eswarah may start as strong favourite 

 Epsom: The clash between an unbeaten favourite, a comfortable 1,000 Guineas winner and two impressive trial victors promises to provide a Vodafone Oaks to savour at Epsom on Friday. 

 Eswarah, who did not run as a two-year-old, shot to the head of the ante-post market after two comfortable wins at Newbury in the past two months. The bare form of her latest two-length defeat of Favourita leaves her with plenty to find, but she could do no more than win in style and Michael Jarvis, her trainer, is confident that she can emulate her dam, Midway Lady, who landed this classic in 1986. 

 Of the early-season races, the 1,000 Guineas provides much the best pointer to the Oaks with six of the past ten Epsom winners having contested the Newmarket classic. Only one of those, Kazzia in 2002, has completed the double, so it pays to delve into the breeding of the beaten runners to see who is most likely to improve for the half-mile longer trip. 

 Possible runners from this years renewal at Newmarket are Virginia Waters, the winner, Pictavia (seventh), Fen Shui (tenth) and Joint Aspiration (thirteenth). 

 Virginia Waters has since disappointed when a one-paced eighth to Saoire in the Irish equivalent, but the easier ground and relative test of speed in a slowly-run race at the Curragh were against her and she is better judged on her Newmarket success. On breeding, she is likely to appreciate the stiffer test at Epsom and it is easy to understand the decision of her connections to pay ?20,000 to supplement her to the Oaks entries last week. Kieren Fallon will partner the filly.

 Aidan Brien, who trains Virginia Waters, has another Oaks possible in the shape of Silk And Scarlet, who looked the right type for Epsom when a staying-on fourth behind Divine Proportions in the French Guineas. A daughter of Sadlers Wells, she cannot be discounted now that her stamina is more fully tested. 

 The Brien team is completed by Mona Lisa. A good fourth in the group one Fillies Mile at Ascot last September, she was then sent to America for the Breeders Cup Juvenile Fillies but failed to handle the dirt surface and finished a well-beaten eleventh. She has something to prove after two poor efforts this term.

 Fallon for Gypsy King in Derby 

 Epsom: Kieren Fallon will ride Dee Stakes winner Gypsy King in Saturdays Vodafone Derby with Mick Kinane taking the mount on stablemate Oratorio.

 Fallons mount has been the subject of great speculation during the last few days but he has finally decided to partner the Sadlers Wells colt, who remains a 4-1 chance with Ladbrokes.

 Aidan Brien will also saddle Almighty (Pat Smullen) and Grand Central (Jimmy Fortune) after a total of 14 were declared for the premier classic. Ante-post favourite Motivator fromMichael Bells yard remains leader in the market as a 5-2 shot for the 12-furlong showpiece.

 Derby odds (Ladbrokes): 5-2 Motivator, 4-1 Gypsy King, 5-1 Dubawi, 6-1 Oratorio, 10-1 The Geezer, 12-1 Grand Central, Walk In The Park, 14-1 Fracas, 25-1 and over the rest. THE TIMES, LONDON

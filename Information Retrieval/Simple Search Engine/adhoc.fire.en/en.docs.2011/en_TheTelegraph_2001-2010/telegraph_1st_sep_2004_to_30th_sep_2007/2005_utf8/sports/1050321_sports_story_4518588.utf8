The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dutta hopeful of turnaround

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Newly-appointed Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta, who took over from out-of-favour Subrata Bhattacharya, had a team meeting with the players instead of a full-fledged practice session on Sunday. 

Speaking to the reporters, Dutta said his objective was to save the green-and-maroon side from relegation. 

Dutta seemed hopeful about a turnaround in the NFL. ?I have to observe them for two-three days and only then will I be able to say something about the condition,? he said.

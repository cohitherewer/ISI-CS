 Railways, Haryana share honours

New Delhi: Railways won their 20th national title, but this time jointly with Haryana, in a dramatic final match of the national womens hockey championship that was marred by poor umpiring decisions and walk-out by players here Monday. 

The cup was awarded to both the teams after the tournament organisers found light insufficient to carry on the match after the regulation time ended 1-1. 

Earlier, Sarita Lakras 56th minute strike saw Jharkhand clinching the bronze with a 1-0 win over Mumbai. 

Though the two best teams in the national circuit were pitted against each other in the summit clash, the match never rose to great heights while it was marred by frayed tempers and walk-out by Haryana players in protest against some umpiring decisions. 

Umpire Anupama drew the ire of the Haryana team when she sent off two players Harpreet and Sarvjeet in a space of two minutes ? 45th and 46th ? for foul play. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 United are uncertain, confused and sloppy

 - Chelsea stand to capitalise on the fall at Old Trafford 

Martin Samuel

 Fergusons empire is about to crumble 

Great empires do not fall. They crumble. Brick by brick, stone by stone, until there is nothing left but dust and rubble. This process takes time. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire is widely accepted to have begun with the death of Constantine the Great in AD 337 and continued, in degrees, until AD 476, when Odoacer the Scirian, the Germanic mercenary, deposed Romulus Augustus. 

Football can be like that. For 139 years, read three or four seasons. For Attila, read Roman Abramovich. That is all. Sometimes the decline goes unnoticed until its too late. 

Sir Alex Ferguson did not build this kingdom on mighty efforts in isolation. He conquered all, with a ruthlessness that was Roman in its ambition and conceit. Yet United have not done that in four years, not since Arsenal landed the title at Old Trafford in 2001-02. It is said that they are in transition, but to what end? Just as Fergusons empire took time to build, it will be painfully slow to fall. 

In the period in which United have been stumbling downhill, the club contrived to win the league. Yet for them, the 2002-03 season may be remembered as the equivalent of Liverpools final flourish in 1990. 

The same year that United last won the league, Ferguson also hit David Beckham on the head with a boot after losing to Arsenal in the FA Cup and the club was removed from the European Cup by the first good team they played in the knockout stage, as has been the case in every season since the treble was won in 1999. The beginning of the end? No, merely fresh reverses along the way. 

Just as Real Madrid exposed Uniteds shortcomings against the best in Europe, which have consistently taken a vast psychological toll on the club in six seasons, so the personality clash with Beckham was the first sign that the newly empowered modern footballer and the patriarchal manager, as represented by Ferguson, were no longer travelling the same path. 

Look at Ferguson on the touch-line against Middlesbrough on Saturday. Has ever a strong man appeared so helpless? He has stood by his players, yet are they standing by him? It was left to his stricken captain, Roy Keane, publicly to read the Riot Act in an assessment so devastatingly inflammatory it was removed from the schedules of Uniteds television channel by panicking club officials. Keane has been outspoken before, often with Fergusons blessing, yet this was judged a carpeting too far. Maybe the manager is too aware that it is not only at the top of the Premiership where the balance of power is changing. 

In the banned interview, Keane is believed to have singled out some of Uniteds younger players for criticism, as well as Rio Ferdinand, who may yet develop a full-blown case of wasted talent syndrome in time for next summers World Cup finals. More than five years ago, Ferguson was complaining that certain aspects of Beckhams life were beyond his control. Now that he has Ferdinand getting cosy with Peter Kenyon, the Chelsea chief executive, and Wayne Rooney making regular sorties, it is unlikely he feels happier. 

Jose Mourinhos preferred 4-3-3 at Chelsea trips off the tongue as easily as the classic 4-4-2 of Uniteds past. Yet in aping his greatest rivals, Ferguson ensures only that his players remain second best. Mourinho has specifically constructed a group to play that way and there is no team better suited to it. So Uniteds best 4-3-3 will not be as good as Chelseas. See the problem? The failure is in-built. 

When Liverpool collapsed in the 1990s, United dominated, with Arsenal playing second fiddle after brief interludes featuring Leeds United and Blackburn Rovers. Chelsea now stand to capitalise on Uniteds fall, with Arsenal again reduced to a supporting role. Other patterns are familiar: Liverpool were overtaken by wealthier rivals, as United have been, and key players grew old together, as is happening at United. 

Liverpool could clearly not adequately replicate the talents of Ian Rush, Graeme Souness, Dalglish, Steve Nicol, Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, just as Ferguson is labouring to find the heirs to Keane, Beckham, Peter Schmeichel and, in time, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. 

Increasingly rudderless as answers grew harder to find, Liverpool introduced Ronny Rosenthal and Jimmy Carter and the days grew darker. United have made similar mistakes with Eric Djemba-Djemba and Kleberson in midfield and a succession of goalkeepers each more calamitous than the last. Cristiano Ronaldo and Rooney may represent a rosier future, but Ferguson is missing the glue that has always held his teams together. 

United have become uncertain, confused and sloppy, traits that Ferguson would not have recognised or tolerated in his prime. More worrying is the thought that their decline is inconspicuous, unexamined and unheeded. 

As Odoacer advanced on Ravenna, the seat of the Western Roman Empire, legend has it that a soldier approached Emperor Romulus Augustus. Dont worry, boss, he said. Were just in transition.

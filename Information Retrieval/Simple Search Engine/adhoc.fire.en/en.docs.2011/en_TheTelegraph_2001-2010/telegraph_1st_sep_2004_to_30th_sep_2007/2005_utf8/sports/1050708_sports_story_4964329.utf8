The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tiger perfected the course

London: Tiger Woods arrived at St Andrews in July 2000 for the British Open confirmed as the finest golfer of his era. He ended the tournament lauded as the greatest ever. 

The Americans epic victory after four balmy days on the east coast of Scotland earned him a career grand slam of all four of golfs professional majors, making him one of only five men to achieve the feat. 

Compatriot Mark Calcavecchia, an Open winner from 1989, summed up Woods achievement: If Jack (Nicklaus) was in his prime today, I dont think he could keep up with Tiger...he is the chosen one. 

Woods did not just get on top of the Old Course: he surveyed it, stalked it, worked out his plan of action and then completely pulverised it. 

He has raised the bar to a level that only he can jump, gushed Tom Watson, a five-time Open champion and himself one of the sports all-time greats. 

Someone is going to have to use flubber in the bottom of their shoes to be able to jump over that bar. He is something supernatural. 

The facts speak for themselves. Woods strung together rounds of 67-66-67-69 for a record 19-under-par total of 269 at St Andrews, eclipsing Nick Faldos mark of 270 set 10 years earlier. 

In 1990, the Briton had won with five strokes to spare but Woods performance almost made that look like a close call as he romped home by eight. 

Woods was to go on to triumph at the next major, that years US PGA Championship, and again in the 2001 US Masters to hold all four professional majors at the same time ? the first man to achieve the feat. 

Further majors followed with the Masters again in 2002 and the US Open the same year and he collected a green jacket from Augusta for a fourth time last April. That took his tally of golfs blue riband titles to nine. 

All of them have been won with trademark panache, guts and skill but none quite compares with those four summer days at St Andrews when Woods briefly touched absolute perfection.

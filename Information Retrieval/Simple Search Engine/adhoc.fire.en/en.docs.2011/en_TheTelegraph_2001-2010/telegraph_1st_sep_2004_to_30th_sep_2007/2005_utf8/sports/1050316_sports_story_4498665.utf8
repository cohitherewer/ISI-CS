Dubai: India?s first Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan has agreed to be part of a programme to promote the Bahrain Grand Prix which would be held at Bahrain International Circuit in April. 

Bahrain media reports said Karthikeyan?s one-day visit on Monday was expected to be action-packed with the BIC inviting over 2,000 children from Indian schools to meet ?the fastest Indian in the world?. 

Karthikeyan, who made his debut for Jordan in Melbourne earlier this month and finished 15th, said he was excited about his Bahrain trip a fortnight ahead of the race in the kingdom. 

?I am thrilled to be coming to Bahrain and meeting a large number of people from India who have made Bahrain their home,? said Karthikeyan. 

?We aim to bring Narain closer to the Indian community,? the Bahrain International Circuit general manager Martin Whitaker was quoted as saying in a loca daily. 

Karthikeyan had the best result among the four debutant drivers at the Australian GP and is expecting to improve further at the Malaysian Grand Prix Sunday and the following race in Bahrain April 3.

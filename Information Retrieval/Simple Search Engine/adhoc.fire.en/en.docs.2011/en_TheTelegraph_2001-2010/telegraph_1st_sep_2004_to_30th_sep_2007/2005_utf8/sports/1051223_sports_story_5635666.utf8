 Pak series will be a big test

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: The Sri Lankans have been conquered and its Mission Pakistan now for Greg Chappell. 

The Pakistan series will be a big test for us, the coach said on Thursday. Each series has new challenges and this will be no different. New ideas, new roles for players? We need to perform well. 

Unless we play top teams, we wont get better. We need to keep developing as a unit. Both India and Pakistan are emerging sides and both have played good cricket in their last series. Whoever performs on a given day will prevail, remarked the former Australian captain. 

Will Sourav Ganguly be included in the squad? The names of a number of players will come up for discussion? Well obviously be looking at the balance of the side. Theres nothing I can say. Its the selectors decision? Youll have to wait and see what happens? 

Chappell will take a few days break from cricket because of Christmas and New Year. He and wife Judith, though, are not going to Australia and will spend the vacation in Bangalore only. 

I will just keep away from cricket for a while? Think about the Pakistan tour only in the New Year, he said.

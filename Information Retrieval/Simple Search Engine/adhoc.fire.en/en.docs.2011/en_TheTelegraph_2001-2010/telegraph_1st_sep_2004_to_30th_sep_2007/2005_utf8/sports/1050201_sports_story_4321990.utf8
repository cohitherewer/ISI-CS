 Bagan, Dempo in Fed Cup re-run

 - NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE - ALL THREE CALCUTTA TEAMS IN FIFTH-ROUND ACTION 

TODAY

Margao: Memories of December 5 Federation Cup final will be revived when Dempo lock horns with Mohun Bagan in a highly volatile contest in the ninth National Football League for the ONGC Cup on Tuesday. 

Dempo won the final 2-0 but lost their Brazilian striker Cristiano Junior in the process, who died on the field. 

?We miss the service of a goal poacher, someone like Cristiano Junior who was our trump-card. His absence was clearly felt in our last match against Tollygunge Agragami where we missed several goal scoring opportunities. We are finding it hard to find his replacement,? Dempo coach Armando Colaco said. 

?As a mark of respect to Junior, the players will wear black armbands throughout the National League,? he added. 

Colaco said Dempo will face Mohun Bagan in the fifth round on Tuesday in the spirit of the game. 

?We will treat them like any other team and play in the spirit of the game. Our boys have done well at home winning all their three matches and will continue to maintain the momentum to be in contention for the title,? Colaco added. 

Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said: ?Our aim is to collect as many points from our Goa leg and now that we have won against Churchill, we will hope for the same against Dempo.? 

The AIFF has deputed special observer Nasir Ali to monitor security during Mohun Bagan?s matches. GFA has also made special security arrangement at the stadium.

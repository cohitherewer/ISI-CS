 Lawyer Beloff to hear appeal

London/Calcutta: The chairman of the ICC?s Code of Conduct Commission, Michael Beloff, was Thursday appointed to hear the appeal by Team India captain Sourav Ganguly against his six-ODI ban. 

Announcing Beloff?s name, the ICC said in a release that he will ?hear and determine the appeal within the next seven days unless the parties agree otherwise.? 

The process for conducting the hearing is at the discretion of Beloff, the ICC added. 

Sourav was banned for his team?s slow over-rate in the Ahemdabad one-dayer against Pakistan. 

Beloff is a prominent English lawyer with a wealth of experience in sports law, having represented both athletes and governing bodies in legal cases relating to sporting issues, the ICC said. He has been a member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) from 1996. 

He was on the CAS ad hoc panel for dispute resolution during the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, Sydney in 2000 and Athens 2004. 

Meanwhile talking to newsmen in Calcutta, Sourav said he was hopeful that his appeal would be successful. As was done last November, former Bengal chief minister S.S. Ray will be representing him.

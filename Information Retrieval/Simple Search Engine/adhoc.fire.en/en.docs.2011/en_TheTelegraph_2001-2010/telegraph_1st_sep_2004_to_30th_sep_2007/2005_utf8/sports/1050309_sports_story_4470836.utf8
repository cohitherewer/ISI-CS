 Warne slams NZ coach?s excuses

 The excuses are absolutely ridiculous, says Warne 

Christchurch: Shane Warne wasted little time in launching a verbal offensive ahead of Australia?s Test series in New Zealand, labelling their coach John Bracewell as an embarrassment to his players. 

During Australia?s recent 5-0 sweep in the one-day International series, Bracewell accused the Australians of manipulating umpires and said fast bowler Brett Lee deliberately bowled full toss ?beam balls? at his batsmen to unsettle them. 

?I?ve heard some excuses in my time, but some of those he?s been coming up with, that?s the best I?ve ever heard,? Warne said. 

?That was absolutely ridiculous. 

?I?m not sure how the New Zealand players are getting along with John Bracewell but I wouldn?t be listening to him. I?d be listening to (captain) Stephen Fleming.? 

Australian opener Matthew Hayden, who missed the end of the one-day series with an injured shoulder, practised with the squad on Tuesday and has a chance of playing in the opening Test match at Jade Stadium.

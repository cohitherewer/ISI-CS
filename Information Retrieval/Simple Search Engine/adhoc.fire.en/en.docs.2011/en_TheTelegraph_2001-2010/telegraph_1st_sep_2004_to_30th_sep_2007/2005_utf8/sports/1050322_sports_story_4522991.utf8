Bangalore: India and Pakistan cricketers took a break Monday, ahead of the final Test starting Thursday. 

The cricketers, who arrived from Calcutta last night, confined themselves to their hotel rooms in the city, a day after India scored a thumping 195-run victory over the arch-rivals in the second Test to go one-up in the three-match series. 

Coach John Wright visited M. Chinnaswamy Stadium and inspected the pitch. Among the players, wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik was the only one to turn up at the venue in the morning to get a feel of it. 

?I am happy with my performance in Calcutta (where he scored 93 in the second innings). I feel it has come at the right time. It has given me great confidence.? 

Pakistan held a team meeting in the evening where the ?shortcomings? in the second match and strategy for the final Test were discussed. 

Meanwhile, initial response to sale of ticket sales was lukewarm but the demand is expected to increase. Hundreds of Pakistani fans are also expected to witness the match. 

Bangaloreans also expect the ?home boys? Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid to do well in the final Test. 

Kumble has said that he wants to be even more devastating at his home ground. ?Hopefully, I will do better than what I did (in the second Test),? he said here. 

?It always feels good to win. It?s a good feeling to go one-up in the series,? Kumble said. 

Kumble, who now has tally of 460 wickets in 94 Tests said he did not feel any added pressure going into the final Test. 

?There will always be pressure while playing for India. The Bangalore Test will be no different,? he said. (PTI)

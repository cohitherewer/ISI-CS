The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thanks to Pathan, India open up 297-run lead

 - 2nd TEST - Kumble bags 6; Dravid joins 8000 club

 Rahul Dravid in New Delhi on Monday 

New Delhi: The stage was set for another day of riveting drama. Irfan Pathan came to the arena with the supposed role of a side character. His stint with the bat was meant to be brief but brisk, to catch the opponents off guard from the word go. 

Instead, he swung his bat to a new direction, stayed at the crease for more than three hours and produced a 143-ball 93, which turned out to be as surprising as his entry as an opener. It was another sure step towards the exciting youngsters development into a genuine allrounder, but the very move was daring and defiant of Test match tradition. 

The fact that he missed out on his maiden international century must have been a huge disappointment for him, but Team India can bask in that glory, aware that they are in a position to go for the jugular against Sri Lanka. 

The hosts ended Day III of the second Test at 237 for five for a handsome lead of 297, after Anil Kumble had bowled Maravan Atapattu amp; Co. out 60 short of the Indian total. 

Barring a miracle at the Kotla, Rahul Dravids boys are assured of taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match battle for the Videocon Cup. For the record, the highest target successfully chased at this ground is 276 (for five) by the West Indies in 1987-88. 

If Test cricket is all about fluctuating fortunes, it has also seen many unorthodox moves and methods from time to time. But in sending somebody at the top from the lower order was a clear message that Team India, under Greg Chappell, are going to be flexible in white clothes as well. 

If Dravids decision to open in the first innings was the captains own way of leading from the front, Pathans promotion ? and success ? in the second essay was something Test cricket has rarely witnessed. 

Atapattu tried his best to negate it ? by handing over the new ball to Muttiah Muralidharan. But once in the middle, Pathan quickly made it clear that it was not going to be a mere side-show. He nipped the Lankan captains plans in the bud, sending the legendary off-spinner twice into the gallery. Then came a scintillating cover-drive off Chaminda Vaas as further confirmation that he had other ideas in mind than just giving his team the intended brisk start. 

Gautam Gambhir, on the other hand, failed to learn from his mistake, again shuffling across the line of a Vaas delivery. V.V.S. Laxman then became the left-arm pacers 300th Test victim while Sachin Tendulkar faced the reality bite. The record century-maker appeared to be in a positive frame of mind but failed to negotiate a Malinga Bandara ball that pitched on line but kept low. 

Pathans role assumed importance as he showed tremendous maturity in building and repairing the innings, with his captain, after the hosts had slipped to 86 for three. Their fourth-wicket stand of 92 was an attempt to block all possible escape routes for Sri Lanka. 

Back-to-back boundaries brought Pathan into the zone of the nervous 90s. But in the hurry to reach the magical three-figure mark, the left-hander perished. He chased Dilhara Fernandos full-length delivery wide off the stump, and offered Kumar Sangakkara an easy catch. 

Dravids exit could also be attributed to restlessness. A classic cover-drive off Fernando brought him 50 as well as the 8000-run mark. But in the next over, he pushed Muralidharan towards mid-on and went for a single. Mahela Jayawardenes direct throw found him well short of the crease. His frustration was reflected in the way he threw his bat down, even as the square-leg umpire sought the confirmation of television. 

Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh, who turned 25 on Monday, extended the lead to 297 with an unbroken 47-run stand. 

Every new day, this Test has produced a new hero. The former captain (batting on 22) has looked in good nick during his 54-ball stay so far. It remains to be seen whether the bright start can be translated into a more meaningful answer to his doubters on Tuesday. 

Souravs inspiration could easily be Kumble, who took off from where he had left the previous afternoon ? bundling the visitors for 230 well inside the first hour of play. His figures of 21.3-5-54-6 was a strong statement that experience still has value in the world of experiments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand in sole lead

 - MONACO MEET

 Anand won both matches vs Shirov 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand began with convincing victories over Latvian-born Spaniard Alexei Shirov in the first round of 14th Amber blindfold and rapid chess meet here on Sunday. 

Anand emerged as the sole leader in combined standings as no one else could boast of two victories, while the second spot was shared by Francisco Pons Vallejo of Spain and Russians Alexander Morozevich and Peter Svidler, who have 1.5 points apiece. 

As briefly reported in Sunday?s Late City edition, the first round of one of the events produced as many as five decisive games out of a possible six in the blindfold section. 

In the rapid games, only Anand and Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk could secure the full point at the Monte Carlo Grand Hotel. 

Even as Anand won two absorbing games against Shirov, Svidler stole the Day I honours with a crushing victory over Peter Leko of Hungary. After losing the blindfold, Leko got a draw in the rapid to open his account. 

Russian Vladimir Kramnik also had a easy outing over Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk, but the latter struck back with vengeance in the rapid game to level scores. 

Also winning in his opening game was Morozevich, who had it easy against Dutchman Loek van Wely in just 32 moves. 

The other decisive games of the blindfold was between Vallejo and Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, in which the former proved superior in a keenly-contested battle. 

Playing the white side of a Petroff defence in the blindfold against Shirov, Anand was in his element in securing a slightly better position in the ensuing middle game and routine technique helped by Shirov?s rather lacklustre play, settled the issue. 

Soon after the game entered a queen and minor piece endgame, Shirov missed a technical finesse that resulted in Anand getting a decisive advantage with a passed pawn on the queen side and the game lasted just 35 moves. 

In the rapid game, Shirov proved no match and crumbled against some finely-crafted manoeuvres. 

It was a Caro Kann defence by Anand in which the advance variation yielded nothing to Shirov. 

Falling in a tactical sequence of moves, Shirov first lost a pawn and later a piece in trying to work out his counter play. The game lasted just 32 moves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Powar spins out South

 - DULEEP TROPHY 

 Ramesh Powar took 7/44 

Hyderabad: Ramesh Powar spun a magic web, claiming seven wickets for 44 runs to dismiss South Zone for 187 on the opening day of the four-day Duleep Trophy meet at the Visakha Stadium here on Tuesday. 

In reply, West Zone were 71 for three at stumps with opener Dheeraj Jadhav (30 not out) at the crease. 

After the pace trio of Zaheer Khan, Ajit Agarkar and Irfan Pathan proved their fitness ahead of the crucial series against Pakistan with inspired spells to claim the first three wickets, off-spinner Powar opened the floodgates by dismissing Rahul Dravid (1) before claiming the remaining wickets for an impressive figure of 22.5-6-44-7. 

Electing to bat, South Zone were looking for a big score on the placid track but their formidable batting line-up was guilty of some reckless shot selection as they were skittled out 24 minutes into the extended tea session. 

West Zone started tentatively with openers Jadhav and Satyajit Parab playing cautiously, but South Zone got the breakthrough when Anil Kumble was introduced into the attack by skipper Dravid. The leg-spinner struck in his very first over to dismiss Parab for 13 and ended the day with 2 for 14. 

Wasim Jaffer, who joined Jadhav, stepped up the pace, hitting 13 runs off Balaji?s one over with three hits to the fence. 

Pathan and Agarkar opened the bowling attack for the West and although they did not find much help from the pitch, they stuck to a good line and length troubling South Zone openers Robin Uthappa (5) and Roland Barrington (8) from the very first over. 

Pathan trapped Robin off a slower one and then Zaheer Khan sent back Barrington to have South reeling at 25 for two. Local hero Laxman started confidently, hitting three fours but that was all he could do in his brief stay at the wicket as he miscued a hook off Agarkar, the ball landing in the safe hands of Pathan at square leg. 

Zaheer and Pathan did prove that they were fully fit and their body language suggested that they were enjoying the game. 

Sachin Tendulkar, who returned to action after missing the first match of the tournament owing to fitness problems, also looked at ease.

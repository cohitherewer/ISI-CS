The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sporting ride second-half surge to semis

London: Sporting Lisbon conjured a great escape from the brink of elimination against Newcastle United to reach the Uefa Cup semi-finals on Thursday. 

The Portuguese side, which will stage the final at its Alvalade Stadium on May 18, looked to be heading out after Kieron Dyer?s 20th-minute goal put Newcastle United ahead on the night and 2-0 ahead on aggregate. 

Sporting, though, hit back through striker Marius Nicolae?s header before half-time and turned the tie around after the interval with goals by Sa Pinto (71st minute), Beto (77th) and Fabio Rochemback in stoppage time to seal a 4-2 aggregate win. 

?In the second half, we were strong. We believed we could win the tie,? a relieved Sporting coach Jose Peseiro said. ?It was a fair win against a good Newscastle team.? 

Newcastle coach Graham Souness, a former coach at Lisbon rivals Benfica, said: ?Luck was against us. We missed some good opportunities to win the game.? 

Sporting will meet AZ Alkmaar in the last four after the Dutch side rekindled memories of its run to the 1981 final by overcoming Villarreal in a stormy encounter at the Alkmaarderhout Stadium. 

CSKA Moscow, 4-0 up from the first leg, cruised into their first European semi-final despite losing the return 0-2 to AJ Auxerre. The Russian side will play twice former winners Parma after the Serie A side secured its passage against Austria Vienna on the away-goals rule. 

AZ maintained their unbeaten home record in European competition, a 1-1 draw enough to dump out last season?s semi-finalists Villarreal. (Reuters)

 Court boost to Minardi hopes

Melbourne: A Supreme Court injunction kept alive Minardi?s hopes of competing in the Australian Grand Prix, as the Formula One season started under a cloud of controversy on Friday. 

Race stewards, who act for the governing international automobile federation (FIA), had earlier rejected the team?s bid to compete with 2004 cars that do not conform to new aerodynamics regulations. 

?We are in. We?ll be running all day Saturday and then we?ll have to wait and see what happens,? Stoddart, whose struggling team are regular GP tail-enders, said. 

The Australian, who hails from Melbourne, said the Victoria court had scheduled a second hearing to decide whether or not Minardi can race on Sunday. 

First qualifying starts Saturday, after two periods of practice, with the decisive second session now held on Sunday hours before the race. 

Minardi drivers Christijan Albers of The Netherlands and Austrian Patrick Friesacher, both rookies, took no part in Friday?s practice as Stoddart sought a resolution that would have allowed them to compete. 

In a piece of theatre played out before the main grandstand, Stoddart waited for the stewards? verdict with a champagne bottle ready to be sprayed in jubilation. It remained corked. 

?It is the view of the stewards that it is inappropriate and unacceptable to alter the technical regulations with which all other competitors comply in order to suit the individual needs and requirements of one competitor,? the FIA said in a statement. 

?It is the decision of the stewards that for Minardi... to participate further in the 2005 Australian GP, their cars must comply with all requirements of the 2005 FIA Formula One sporting and technical regulations.? 

Stoddart had said before the injunction was granted that he believed Minardi had ?an absolutely watertight case?. (REUTERS)

 We need a Sania to lead the way

 Wilander feels Sania hits the ball a lot harder than he used to 

New Delhi: Former world No. 1 Mats Wilander feels that even a country like Sweden needs a talent like Sania Mirza who can be idolised. 

We need a Sania to lead the way, Wilander, who held three major titles at the same time in 1988, said about the teen sensation here on Saturday. 

Interestingly, Wilanders comments came when discussing the topic of Swedish tennis and promising women talent in that Nordic country. 

According to the former world No. 1 the teen sensation would do well to aim at becoming a better tennis player instead of looking to win tournaments in the short term. 

Wilander said Sania needed to have a long term vision to realise her dream of becoming the world No. 1 or winning a Grand Slam. 

From now on it has to be a long term vision. It should be a matter of how much better she (Sania) can be in five years, said Wilander, in city as captain of the visiting Sweden team to take on India in the Davis Cup World Group play-off next week. 

The focus should be on becoming a better tennis player. It should not be on winning tournaments and rankings. It is the process that matters. 

Who knows, she can then be the top-two or the No. 1, or even win a Grand Slam, said Wilander, winner of eight Grand Slam titles and the youngest to win a singles crown at the age of 17 and nine months at Roland Garros in 1982. 

Praising Sanias techniques, Wilander said: She definitely hits the ball a lot harder than I used to, or even than most guys on the mens circuit. 

She has got unbelievable ground strokes, she is a fighter and not afraid to go for her shots. 

The 41-year-old said Sania has to quickly make the transition from being a ball-basher to a mature tennis player. 

She has to learn the difference between what is to win and to not lose. There is a huge difference between beating the big players and losing to bad players. 

She is trying to win all the points. Someone like Federer lets the opponents lose a lot of those points. 

It has got nothing to do with her weakness. She is going for the winners all the time. 

At 18, it is ok. It would be a lot easy if you make your opponents give away the points. 

But it is going to take time. Someone like (Marat) Safin took five years to learn it, and so did (Roger) Federer. (PTI)

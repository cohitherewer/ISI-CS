 Circus on monsoon track 

 STAR RACER

 The complete dominance of the two heavyweight owners, last Thursday, left small owners ruing. While the big guns could afford to test their wards on monsoon track, the lesser owners couldnt risk their horses on it. It was because big owners had a back-up string while small ones had none. This was another reason that the total horse-strength on the day failed to exceed 29 despite a dozen of them hailed from the MAM Ramaswamy-stables.

 The main season is already three weeks old but the winter race track is far from ready. Surprisingly, RCTC had handed over the charge of track-preparations to rookies and their inexperience has resulted in dark brown patches and bald turf all over the course even after a fortnight of the start. Race track with a green velvet top had always been the order on Day I of the winter season.

 The mid-October rains may have caused a slight setback towards the preparations of the track but its no excuse. A massive re-construction work within racecourse premises, and during the same period was, perhaps, on a priority list. Small owners would, therefore, be lucky if the track is pressed into the service before the 1,000 Guineas on November 27.

 The normal winter crowd, too, is staying away from races. An ex-RCTC steward wondered as to where the horses have vanished. He called it a circus in the name of horse racing. My friends in RCTC say they stand and clap every half-an-hour while hot-favourites of the popular colours flex their muscles, he remarked.

 The afternoon, nevertheless, had little to offer in terms of competition, particularly in the first-half of the six-event card. Knowledgeable had no rival worth its name in the three-horse contest and the Vijay Singh-trained filly posted a six-length-plus victory over Imperial Dynasty.

 The job of Errol Bhungards Aguilas, in the 1,400m Topspin Handicap, was made easier by Alcinias rider, apprentice M. Mark, who took a late jump-out and trailed the field on the joint-favourite with the winner. Daniels Remarquable surprised the joint-favourite, Alarico, by nearly a distance verdict in the Robin Hood Cup over 1,400 metres. The result may be hard to digest and only the time will tell about the winners true merit.

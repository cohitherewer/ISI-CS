 Questions prop up on the Williams future

 - At 23 and 25, Serena and Venus are sufficiently young and gifted

 Serena and Venus Williams are sorting out their priorities 

When the shock of Serena Williams third-round loss at Wimbledon settled in Sunday, American tennis was left to confront some uneasy questions. Chief among them: Will Serena and her elder sister Venus ? together or individually ? dominate the womens game as they did from July 2001 to July 2003, when they won seven of nine Grand Slam titles between them? 

If not, do the sisters run the risk of being remembered less for re-writing the sports history and more as a cautionary tale about relying too much on talent and too little on hard work? 

And how could their failure to reclaim their place atop the game affect the popularity of tennis in the United States, which has been on the decline for years, save for spikes when the Williams sisters take charge? 

At 23 and 25, Serena and Venus are sufficiently young and gifted to script whatever sort of future they want in tennis. But their showing so far at Wimbledon, which took its annual day of rest on the mid-point Sunday, has been far from promising. 

I had it in my head those two could really dominate and change the course of tennis and rewrite tennis in a big way, NBC commentator and former touring pro Mary Carillo said on the eve of the tournament. Its so much up to them and how much they feel committed to being great. 

Serena was ushered out of Wimbledon in straight sets Saturday by 85th-ranked Jill Craybas, who in nearly a decade as a pro had never advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam. It was Serenas earliest Wimbledon exit since 1998, when she made her tournament debut at age 16. 

Though Venus plays on to the fourth round, in which shell face Craybas on Monday, she hasnt looked sharp. Saturday she was tested by 20th seeded Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. 

Venus played terrible today, in my opinion, said Richard Williams, the girls father. 

Said Serena: I think maybe shes feeling her way through. 

Since winning the Australian Open in January (her seventh Grand Slam title), Serena played only 11 matches before Wimbledon ? and none of them on grass. She withdrew from events because of ailments and injury, including a gastrointestinal illness, sore right shoulder and left ankle sprain, which she characterised last week as a hairline fracture. She also bowed out of events by saying she didnt want to compete if she didnt feel she could win. 

Venus also arrived at Wimbledon without much match-toughening. Her only title this year, in Istanbul, came against a draw of relative unknowns. A 15-year-old bounced her from the French Open, in the third round. 

Still, top-ranked Lindsay Davenport argues its far too early to conclude they wont get themselves back to the top. 

They have the games, and they have to ability to do that, said Davenport, 28. (The problem) has been consistency and being able to play tournaments healthy. I think they have been plagued by quite a bit these last 18 months. Injuries, and the injuries led to some confidence problems. 

Serena insisted her loss to Craybas had nothing to do with her ankle. I had a lot of rust, she said. Serenas serve deserted her. She was broken in her first five service games. And she finished with 34 unforced errors and 29 winners. 

I shouldnt have lost this match, Serena said tearfully. I hate to waste time, and I worked pretty hard the last week or so. But I guess you got to work more than a week, you know. 

As the Williams sisters sort out their priorities, former touring pro Leslie Allen, who is also African-American, feels their impact on tennis will remain strong. 

What they did is they brought a whole new audience to tennis, Allen said. People who didnt traditionally look at tennis began to watch it. And they werent necessarily people of colour. Their reach was so broad, so universal because they were the atypical tennis player. 

But there arent many American girls currently among the elite junior ranks. 

There are no young (American) women coming up, and thats a big concern, Carillo said. Were seeing not just Russians, but Serbo-Croatians and Bulgarians, apart from (the traditionally strong) South Americans on the womens side... Theyre going after it in a way that doesnt seem to be happening in this country. 

John McEnroe thinks its time the games power brokers ? including the US Tennis Association, major broadcasters, and players organisations ? start promoting players more aggressively. And McEnroe argues its time players became more fan? and media-friendly by taking a cue from NASCAR, of all things. 

They seem to think that all they have to do is stick the players out on court, McEnroe said. But theres a lot more options (for sports fans); theres a lot more channels. I happen to be a Nascar fan. These guys lay their life on the line, but a half-hour before the race, theyre out there signing autographs and speaking to the media. Thats an incredible thing. And for starters, the players need to do more of it.

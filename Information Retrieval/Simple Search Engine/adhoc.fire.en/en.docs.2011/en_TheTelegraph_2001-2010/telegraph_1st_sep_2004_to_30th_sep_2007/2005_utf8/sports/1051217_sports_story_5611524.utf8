 John Buchanan blames poor shot selection

Perth: Coach John Buchanan blamed Australias ill-discipline for their batting collapse on the opening day of the first Test against South Africa on Friday. 

Buchanan said Australias batsmen paid the price for poor shot selection after they slumped to 258 all out, having appeared to be cruising along at 111 for one. 

It was a game of two parts today. Up until lunch, South Africa were lacking in discipline with their line and length and we took advantage and exploited that, Buchanan told reporters. 

But come the second part of the day it was vice-versa, they tied their discipline up and we probably didnt. We made some wrong decisions on shots. 

Three of the Australians, Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer and Mike Hussey, threw their wickets away trying to pull Makhaya Ntini. Andrew Symonds chopped the ball on to his stumps and four others were needlessly caught behind. 

Buchanan conceded some players had found it hard adjusting to Test cricket after completing a one-day series in New Zealand but said that was not a valid excuse. 

The transition is not always easy but thats what we have to do. I thought our preparation was very good and there are no excuses about the way we prepared for this game, he said. 

Buchanan said Australia had also bowled poorly at the South Africans in the half hour before close, allowing the visitors to reach 38 for no loss. 

It would be nice if we could live up to everybodys expectations every time we bat and every time we bowl but the reality is that it is international sport, its very competitive and were just not super-human, he said. 

Im disappointed that we won the toss and batted and were all out for 258 but... I expect to see us come out tomorrow, and Im sure South Africa will expect us to come out tomorrow, and play a lot more like the way we do. 

Ntini, who captured five for 64 off 19 overs to trigger the collapse, said the visitors were thrilled by their performance. 

It has been a good day for South Africa. From a bowling point of view, it was an amazing day, he said. (Reuters)

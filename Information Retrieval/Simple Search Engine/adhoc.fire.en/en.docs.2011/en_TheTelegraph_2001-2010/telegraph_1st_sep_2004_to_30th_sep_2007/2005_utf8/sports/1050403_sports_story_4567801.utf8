Miami: Roger Federer?s dominance of eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi continued as the Swiss world number one posted a straight sets victory over the US veteran to reach the final of the Key Biscayne ATP Masters Series. 

Federer, seeking his first title in Miami, defeated six-time champion Agassi 6-4, 6-3 to advance to Sunday?s final against Spain?s Rafael Nadal, who beat compatriot David Ferrer 6-4, 6-3. 

It was just the second time in 10 semi-final appearances at Key Biscayne that Agassi has failed to reach the final. And it was his seventh straight loss to Federer. 

Agassi had chances to break Federer in just one game during the one hour 25 minute match, at 3-3 in the second set, but he couldn?t convert any of the five opportunities. 

?Three of them he hit unreturnable serves,? Agassi said. ?One of them I had a look at a backhand up the line that I took ? would have beat him by eight feet ? but I just hit it long.? 

That backhand was Agassi?s first break chance, at 0-40. On the next two, Federer came up with two of his eight aces, but he gave Agassi another chance with a double fault. Agassi netted a backhand on that one, ruefully tapping his head with his racquet after what he later described as a poor shot selection. 

?It was probably the worst shot I could have played,? Agassi said. ?You know, you get one or two chances to make the right decisions and execute, and I didn?t make the right decision on that shot for sure.? 

Agassi gave himself one last chance with a forehand service return winner, but again Federer came up with a service winner to escape the threat. He quickly turned the tables on Agassi, breaking for a 5-3 lead and serving out the match. 

Federer had claimed the first set with a break in the final game, when Agassi?s attempt to end a long rally with a forehand crosscourt failed. 

Federer said Agassi had little other choice. 

?It was a long, long rally,? said Federer, who was anticipating the shot. 

?Going up the line at the end of a point is always risky. If he would have hit it up the line, he would have had to hit it extremely hard to make a winner out of it. So I was kind of waiting there. 

?It was good to go on that long rally, and to win it in the end was really good and set the tone for the second set.? 

Federer now boasts a win-loss record of 31-1 in 2005, and is 47-1 since the beginning of last year?s US Open. 

His 2005 record is marred only by a semi-final loss to eventual champion Marat Safin in the semi-finals of the Australian Open, and in Miami he is bidding to claim a second straight Masters Series title after a triumph in Indian Wells, California, earlier this month. 

?There?s a number of departments of his game that are arguably better than anybody,? Agassi said of Federer. 

?That?s an incredible thing to say when you realise that most players count on one thing to be special. And if they have one thing that?s special, it makes them hard to deal with. He has a few things.? 

The hard-hitting Nadal will have his work cut out against Federer, who has won the last 17 finals he has contested. But Nadal does own a winning record against Federer, having beaten him in straight sets in the round of 32 at this event last year. 

?Last year against Federer, I played one of my best matches in my career,? said Nadal. 

?I played unbelievable, and I really hope I play the same,? he said, but acknowledged he might need a little help from Federer himself if he is to win a title that would be his first on hard court and his first in the prestigious masters series. 

?I hope Federer doesn?t play one of his best matches. If he doesn?t play very, very well, and I play one of my best matches I have a little bit of a chance,? he said.

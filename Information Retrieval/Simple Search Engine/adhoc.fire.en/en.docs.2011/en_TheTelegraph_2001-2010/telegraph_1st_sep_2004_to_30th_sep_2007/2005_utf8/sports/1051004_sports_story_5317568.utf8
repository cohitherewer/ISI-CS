 Ever-Ready lose

Gangtok: Defending champions Ever-Ready Association went down 1-3 to Tata Football Academy (TFA) at the Governors Gold Cup football tournament in Paljor Stadium on Monday. After this win, TFA made the semi-finals. The winners led 2-1 at the breather. 

Bimal Pariyar drew first blood for the Jamshedpur outfit in the 14th minute dodging past a host of defenders to hit the target. Eugene Gray equalised in the 19th minute putting in a header from Muzaffar Rehman from the right flank. Nauba Singh, however, successfully converted a spot-kick, minutes before the breather to put the winners back in the lead. (PTI)

Jaipur: The Sri Lankans, perhaps, couldnt have hoped for a better venue if theyre serious about regaining some ground lost over the first two ODIs. With tales of conquering adversity abounding in these parts, nobody has to dig deep for inspiration. 

And, the Lankans do need to win match No. 3 of the Videocon Cup, at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Monday, if the seven-ODI series is to keep the janata at the edge of their seats. 

So lopsided were the first two matches that the worth of the ICC rankings has been called into question. 

The Lankans ? who havent played here before ? began the series at No. 2, with Team India down five positions. 

While the Nagpur and Mohali performances have been uplifting, coming as they did after the image-denting spat between Sourav Ganguly and Greg Chappell as also the sorry spectacle seen at the Boards adjourned AGM, Bishan Singh Bedi had a word of caution. 

The Lankans have played very poor cricket. So, lets not get carried away, the former India captain told The Telegraph. 

Not that the Indians are taking the Lankans lightly. As captain Rahul Dravid explained: To do so would be at our peril... Weve suffered a lot at their hands. The Lankans, in fact, beat us all three times in the July-August tri-series at home. 

Coach Chappell, too, talked in much the same vein: Weve got to be vigilant. 

The Lankans just havent come to terms with arguably the finest batsman of this generation ? Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, no cracker this Diwali is going to explode the way he has in the first two matches (93 and 70 not out). 

All of Jaipur is hoping for a hattrick. The locals havent hosted a ODI for over six years and havent watched Sachin live for as many as nine. Owing to a back problem, he didnt play the last match, which saw Pakistan win by a massive 143 runs. 

Sachins at the top of his form, which is why our bowlers have struggled. However, thats not to say they have become bad, remarked Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu. 

The Lankan batting, of course, has been bad: Managing 198 in chasing 350 and, then, crashing to the lowest score in Mohali ? 122. 

Except Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan), all of us are due to perform... Hopefully, tomorrow.... We need to back ourselves and have self-belief, Atapattu added as deputy Mahela Jayawardene spoke of the need to perform as a group. 

After Mohali, coach Tom Moody promised a fight. His own reputation is on the line. 

Incidentally, while the Lankans seemed a bit concerned about the cracks on the wicket, Dravid felt it would be good for batting. Assuming he wins the toss, yet again, a target is bound to be set. 

Chappell, who defended the experiments in the first two ODIs, pointed out that options will continue to be looked at. Playing at home makes a difference, but weve been approaching the matches with strategies, he reminded. 

The challenge, as Dravid put it, is to be consistent. 

 TEAMS

Umpires: Billy Bowden, K. Hariharan. TV: A.V. Jayaprakash. 

Match Referee: Alan Hurst. 

Match starts: 9 am. 

 Corrective measures 

The Lalit Modi-headed Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) took immediate corrective measures when Match Referee Alan Hurst expressed misgivings over the positioning of the off-the-field officials box ? the entire ground wasnt visible ? and wanted a clarification over the official scorer. 

It helped Modi that former Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra, an ally who oversees a fantastic job in Mohali, was around. 

The RCA, meanwhile, is going to insist on being awarded a Test next year. We cant be deprived of our status and, if needed, we will take the Board to court, insisted Modi, who informed hed personally invited bete noire Jagmohan Dalmiya for Mondays ODI. 

 Its no surprise that the former ICC and BCCI 

 president isnt coming.

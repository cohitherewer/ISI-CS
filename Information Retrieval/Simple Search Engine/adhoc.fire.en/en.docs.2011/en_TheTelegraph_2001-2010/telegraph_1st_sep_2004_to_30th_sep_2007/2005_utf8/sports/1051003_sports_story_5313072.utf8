 Indian team beats Pak outfit

New Delhi: Indian Light Blues edged past Youngsters Hockey Club of Pakistan 4-3 in the 16th Lal Bahadur Shashtri Hockey tournament here on Sunday. 

India Under-18 rallied to beat Telekom Malaysia 2-1 in another match. 

Tushar Khandkar drew first blood for the Blues in the ninth minute through a spectacular deflection. 

The Indian side struck two more blows in 26th and 28th minutes. Skipper Jugraj Singh exhibited a spark of his old magic by converting a penalty corner through drag-flick. 

The Pakistan team, comprising Olympians Tariq Aziz, Muhammad Shabbir and Mudassar Ali Khan, failed to score due to the solid defence of William Xalxo and Jugraj. 

Youngsters club looked more attacking after the change of ends and their skipper Mudassar delivered the goods by striking at the open goal of Blues in the 48th minute. Shabbir of the Pak outfit was declared the Man-of-the-Match. 

Earlier in the day, India Under-18 came from behind to defeat Telekom Malaysia.

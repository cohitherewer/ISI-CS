 Pole for Alonso, Kimi 5th

Sao Paulo: Renaults Fernando Alonso took another huge step towards becoming Formula Ones youngest champion by seizing pole position for what could be a title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix. 

The 24-year-old Spaniard, who can secure the crown on Sunday with two races to spare if he finishes third or better, could only smile as McLarens Kimi Raikkonen made an error under pressure at the first corner and qualified fifth. 

With Kimis mistake, the pole was much easier for me, grinned Alonso after his fifth pole of the season. 

Raikkonen, 25 points behind Alonso, is the only man with a chance of keeping the Spaniards hands off the championship but his hopes look slim now. Alonso will line up alongside McLarens Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya. 

Raikkonen was last to run in qualifying after winning the Belgian GP two weeks ago but a puff of smoke from a locked wheel under braking on his timed run betrayed the Finns error. (REUTERS)

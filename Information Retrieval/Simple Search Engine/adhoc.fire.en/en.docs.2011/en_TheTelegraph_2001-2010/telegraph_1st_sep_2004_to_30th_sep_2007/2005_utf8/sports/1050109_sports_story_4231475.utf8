 Brazilian Marcos quits Salgaocar

 Marcos 

Margao: Salgaocar Sports Club have received a jolt just days ahead of the National Football League (NFL) championship, with the departure of their Brazilian recruit Marcos Pereira for his home town. 

The Brazilian striker requested the club to relieve him as he was ?not in the best frame of mind,? coach Savio Madeira said. 

?The sudden departure of Marcos has put the club in a tight spot, but we have talented players including two Nigerian recruits Bello Razaq and Felix Iberewu to fill the void,? the coach said. 

Fransa Football Club, who would make their maiden appearance in the NFL, have signed Nigerian striker Joseph Ugor from Cabral Sports Club in order to strengthen its strike force. 

Similarly Vasco have signed up Brazilian Sidney Rodriques.

 Atwal finishes tied 9th

 This is Atwals third top-10 finish this season 

Endicott: Arjun Atwal clamed his third top-10 finish of the season, but still went back disappointed at being unable to make a charge for the title at the $ 3 million BC Open. 

In a low-scoring tournament, Atwal started the day at 18-under in tied second position, but then added only a two-under 70 to finish at 20-under 268 and in the tied ninth place. 

He ended four shots away from the title, for which he was very much in contention till the bogey on the 13th hole. 

Jason Bohn, who at 19 had won a million dollar hole-in-one shoot-out, made a clutch putt on the final hole to keep the lead with which came the title and a cheque of $ 540,000. 

Bohn edged his playing partner Ryan Palmer (67), J. P. Hayes (66), John Rollins and Brendan Jones (68) by a shot. 

Atwal, who was among the leaders in birdie count, had three on the front nine, till which point he was very much in contention. He birdied the second, fifth and seventh to turn in three-under. On the back nine, he managed just one on the 14th, but worse, he bogeyed twice. 

Atwal seemed to recover from the bogey on the 13th, when he birdied the 14th. But he missed a short six-foot putt for birdie on the 15th and then could not sink a 14-footer for birdie on par-4 17th. 

Before that on the 16th, which he had birdied in his previous three rounds, he went into the rough and managed only a par. On the 18th, he missed a short four-foot par and ended with a bogey. 

As it happened in the second round, he made just one birdie from four par-fives and on a good scoring course like this one, he could ill-afford that on a final day. 

This was the seasons third top-10 finish for Atwal, after his tied second place in Bell South Classic and tied fifth in Zurich Classic of New Orleans. 

He now goes into the next week for the US Bank championships in Milwaukee.

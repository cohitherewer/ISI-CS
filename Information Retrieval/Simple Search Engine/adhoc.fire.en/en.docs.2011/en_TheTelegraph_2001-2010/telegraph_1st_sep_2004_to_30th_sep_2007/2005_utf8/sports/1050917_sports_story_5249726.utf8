Bulawayo: Irfan Pathan and Harbhajan Singh shared the spoils as India took just about two hours to wrap up the first Test with an emphatic innings and 90-run victory over Zimbabwe here Friday. 

The visitors, who needed to capture just four wickets on the penultimate day, bundled out the hosts for 185 in their second innings barely five minutes before the lunch break to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. 

It was Zimbabwes fifth successive innings defeat after losing last months Test series against New Zealand 0-2 and big losses in South Africa in March. 

Resuming at a precarious 67 for six after conceding a mammoth 275-run first innings lead, the Zimbabwean lower-order batsmen put up a much better display than the established batsmen and took the score beyond the 150-mark. 

Harbhajan, who claimed his 200th Test scalp Thursday, did the bulk of the damage on a wearing track at the Queens Club Ground as he snared up three more wickets to guide India to victory with a full day and two sessions to spare. 

The off-spinner returned figures of 15.5-1-59-4 while Man-of-the-Match Pathan finished with four for 53, after his spell with the new ball had reduced Zimbabwe to 18 for five on the third evening. 

 The two teams will now travel to Harare for the second Test which begins on Tuesday. 

The diminutive Zimbabwean captain Tatenda Taibu stood bravely amid the ruins with a defiant 52, his second half-century of the match. 

Apart from Taibu, the last wicket pair of Gavin Ewing (34) and Blessing Mahwire (13 not out) frustrated the Indians to some extent as they added 47 runs before Harbhajan eventually brought an end to the partnership. 

Captain Sourav Ganguly began the day with a two-pronged pace attack with Pathan and Zaheer bowling in tandem but the duo could not separate the two overnight batsmen.

 Debut win for Apprentice 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Apprentice Amandeep Singh became an instant hero when he guided Daniel Davids less fancied ward, Anokato, to victory in Wednesdays feature event, the Predator Cup. The young boy was making his debut, and old timers failed to recall another apprentice achieving such a feat in recent years. However, trainer Vijay Singh confirmed that apprentice Abdul Razzak had done so on his runner Track Minstrel in 1996.

 For safety reasons, RCTCs official quarters resented Amandeep being thrown into a crowded 11-horse field. But the apprentice was determined to prove them wrong. He sat calmly behind the leader, Silver N Gold ? a stablemate ? till top of the turn, and hardly got rattled when the fancied runner, Alaskan, came alongside.

 Shooting into a slender lead 250m from home, the whipless apprentice remained engaged to his task and guided the seven-year-old to a length victory.

 It was an eventful afternoon for Daniel who also witnessed stables strong fancy, Artistic Blue, going down to Terrific Dancer in the Woolver Valley Handicap. Artistic Blues jockey, Graham Ross, however, secured the verdict in the stewards room. Vijay, too, opened his seasons account with a double through Raging Tide and Mischevious Notes.

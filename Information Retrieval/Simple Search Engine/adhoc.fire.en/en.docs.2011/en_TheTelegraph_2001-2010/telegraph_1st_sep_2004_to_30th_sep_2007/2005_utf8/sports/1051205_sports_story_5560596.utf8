 Hrbaty levels it for Slovakia

Bratislava: Dominik Hrbaty kept Slovakias Davis Cup hopes alive on Sunday with a thrilling 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Croatias Ivan Ljubicic to level the final at 2-2. 

The Slovakian No. 1 produced an epic comeback after losing the first set, clinching victory after three hours and 20 minutes of drama inside a frenzied Sibamac Arena. 

Hrbaty looked to be sliding to defeat when he dropped the first set before hitting back to deny Ljubicic a 12th straight Davis Cup victory and prevent him matching John McEnroes 1982 record. 

Trailing 1-2 in the best-of-five tie after losing Saturdays doubles, Slovakias hopes rested squarely on the shoulders of 27-year-old Hrbaty. 

Ljubicic pummelled seven aces and a succession of searing winners to claim the opener in 34 minutes. 

Hrbaty has consistently raised his game while on national duty this season, however, and he launched an impressive counter-attack in the second set. 

The world No. 19 broke Ljubicics mighty serve in the second game when he pinned his opponent on the baseline with a deep return, then consolidated to forge ahead. 

Ljubicic looked rattled and heavy-legged and a revitalised Hrbaty levelled the match when Ljubicic sliced a backhand into net. 

Hrbaty led 3-0 in the third set but sloppily handed one break of serve back and was in danger of throwing away his advantage at 30-40 when he served at 4-3. 

The 27-year-old held his nerve to win a gruelling baseline exchange when Ljubicic fired a backhand wide and two games later served a love game to move 2-1 ahead in sets. 

Ljubicic found some energy to keep his nose in front in a fourth set dominated by serve, then pounced for a decisive break as Hrbaty went 0-40 down while serving at 3-4. He closed out the set in ruthless fashion. 

Hrbaty had the advantage of serxving first in the decider and stayed rock solid to force Ljubicic to serve to stay in the match at 4-5. 

With the noise in the hall deafening, Ljubicic saved one match point with a backhand winner and another with a big first serve.

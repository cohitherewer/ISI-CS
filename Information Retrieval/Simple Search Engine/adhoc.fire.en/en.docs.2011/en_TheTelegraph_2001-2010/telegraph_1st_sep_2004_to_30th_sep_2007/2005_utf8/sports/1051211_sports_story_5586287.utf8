The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Somebody with Sachins crease-presence had to go far

 - Fifty Test hundreds a possibility, feels former england captain Graham 

 Gooch 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Graham Gooch 

 was the England captain when Sachin Tendulkar authored the 

 first of his 35 Test hundreds, back in August 1990 at Old 

 Trafford. Reached for a comment on his cellphone, Gooch 

 (20 hundreds in 118 Tests) gladly took a walk down memory 

 lane for the benefit of The Telegraphs readers. 

The following are excerpts 

On his first impressions of Sachin 

 That while everybody was talking of him as a batsman 

 with great potential, he was also a very fine fielder. I 

 think he took an excellent catch to send back Allan Lamb 

 in the first Test (Lords)? 

On Sachins first Test hundred 

 He was so young (17)? I found him very composed, with 

 the right balance and a nice range of shots. His unbeaten 

 119 helped India save that Test. (After a pause) 

 I remember quickly marking him down as someone to look out 

 for. Obviously, hed gained a lot by making his debut 

 in Pakistan? It became easier to handle pressure. 

On what stood out in that hundred 

 (Laughs) It was too long ago? Off-hand, I cant 

 recall anything in particular, except that Sachin wasnt 

 found wanting in confidence. Youve got to remember 

 we had a pretty good attack ? Devon Malcolm, Angus Fraser, 

 Chris Lewis ? but the 17-year-old didnt flinch. 

On whether hed visualised just how far Sachin would go 

 You cant predict? However, as Ive said, 

 I quickly marked him down? Somebody with Sachins crease-presence 

 had to go far? He played the ball late and seemed to possess 

 a sixth sense which only some have. It makes a difference. 

On his Sachin-specific thoughts in the intervening years 

 My own belief is that the period between 25-35 years 

 is the best for batsmen? He has had fitness worries, but 

 has emerged strong. 

On the future 

 Depends on Sachins drive? Is going to depend 

 on his fitness, too? If all goes well, he could be around 

 for another four-five years. 

On whether 50 Test hundreds is a possibility 

 If Sachin remains motivated, thats definitely 

 on? If he plays for five years and averages three hundreds 

 each year, 50 will be reached. Simple mathematics? 

On Sachin having to contend with even more pressure 

 Well, that may dent his ambitions? Its not easy 

 being the No.1? In any case, the expectations in India are 

 huge? Unbelievable, really? 

On Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin 

 I wouldnt have liked to bowl if both were in 

 the XI? Gavaskar never missed out on a bad ball; Sachin 

 has a wider range of shots? The game, though, has moved 

 on from the time Gavaskar quit (in late 1987)? 

Finally, on whether he would actually pay to watch Sachin 

 I would, not just for Sachin, but some others --- 

 like Brian Lara.

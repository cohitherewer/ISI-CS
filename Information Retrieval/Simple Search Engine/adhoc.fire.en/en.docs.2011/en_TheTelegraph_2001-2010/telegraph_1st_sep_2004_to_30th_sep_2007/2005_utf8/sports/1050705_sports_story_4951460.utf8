Well use his (foreign coachs) technical expertise, his role will strictly be to assist chief national coach S. Pradeep Kumar, Nanavati explained, adding that Kumar will be in charge of the national team till the Asian Games. 

In case the foreign coach plan fails to materialise, the SFI has a backup.

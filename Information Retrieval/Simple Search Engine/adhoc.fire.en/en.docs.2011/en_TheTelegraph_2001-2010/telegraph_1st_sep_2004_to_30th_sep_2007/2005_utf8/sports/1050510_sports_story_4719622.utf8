OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Striker Lalampuias brace saw Tata Football Academy (TFA) beat Lajong Sports Club (Meghalaya) 2-0 in a second division National Football League (NFL) match at the Keenan Stadium, Monday. 

In another game, played at the JRD Tata Sports Complex, Punjab Police got the better of Ever-Ready 2-1, helped by a brace from Jaspal Singh. 

Desperate to win to stay afloat, the young TFA team took to the field with renewed zeal. Lalampuias brilliance did the rest. 

The nimble-footed forward wasted little time in chipping in a cross from the centre straight into the Lajong goalpost in the 13th minute. 

The second half saw TFA attacking a bit more. Lalampuia netted his second in the 93rd minute when he sent in a grounder from the left.

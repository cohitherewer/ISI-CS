Kuala Lumpur: India wont just be hosting crickets Champions Trophy in 2006, but edition No. 2 of the Afro-Asia Cup (featuring the two continents) as well. In fact, the latter will precede what is sold as the mini World Cup. 

Yes, it has been decided that the tournament is going to be staged in India. At the moment, were looking at dates in the third-fourth week of September, Afro-Asia Cricket Cooperation convenor Syed Ashraful Haq told The Telegraph. 

Speaking at the plush Asian Cricket Council (of which hes the chief executive) HQ here, Haq added: Ideally, we will be looking at two venues for the three ODIs... If theres a problem because of the Champions Trophy, then we may have all the games at one centre. 

The Champions Trophy is slated to be held between late-October and early-November. 

The (drawn, thanks to one abandonment) inaugural edition of the Afro-Asia Cup was hosted by South Africa two months ago and the Afro-Asia body expects profits in excess of $2 million. Its a handsome figure. 

As per the arrangement, 70 per cent of the profits go to the host region with the other continent getting 20 of the remaining 30 per cent. A charity of the host regions choice is the only other beneficiary. 

The annual Afro-Asia Cup is to alternate between the continents, home to six of the 10 Test-playing nations. 

Meanwhile, the dates of the 2006 Asia Cup (in Pakistan) have been altered slightly. Instead of starting on February 14 and ending on February 27/28, the tournament is to begin on February 16 and conclude on February 28/March 1. 

The adjustment became necessary because of Sri Lankas commitments in Australia, explained Haq. 

Runners-up in the last edition (2004), India are clubbed with Pakistan and Oman in group B. The other group comprises champions Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the UAE.

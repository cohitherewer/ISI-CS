 Sachins absence a big challenge, feels Sehwag

 Virender Sehwag at a press conference at the NCA in Bangalore on Wednesday 

Bangalore: Explosive opener Virender Sehwag says the absence of Sachin Tendulkar would have a bearing on Team Indias performance in the tri-series in Sri Lanka but expressed confidence that the young guns would rise to the big challenge. 

Sachin is a senior player. If he is not playing, it will definitely be a factor. But we have youngsters also? its a big challenge for us without Sachin and Sourav (Ganguly) who may not also be there, Sehwag told newsmen on Wednesday. 

Tendulkar underwent a surgery recently and will miss the July 30 to August 9 tri-series which also features hosts Sri Lanka and the West Indies. Sourav will miss the meet unless Justice Albie Sachs overturns the six-ODI ban. 

Sehwag said during his brief interaction with new coach Greg Chappell, the 56-year-old former Australian captain stressed on the importance of skill and fitness if one had to play a long innings. 

On the teams expectations from Chappell, Sehwag said it primarily relates to planning, strategy and also an attitude of treating all members of the team alike irrespective of their seniority. Sehwag, attending the physical fitness and conditioning camp at the National Cricket Academy, said he is focusing on fitness and losing some weight. 

He is also studying videos, made by analyst S. Ramakrishnan, highlighting a players negative and positive points. It will help, said Sehwag, explaining that it gives ideas on areas of improvement. 

Asked on the importance of having a regular opening partner in Tests, Sehwag said it was important for the team to have a reliable opening pair to get good starts consistently. We are hoping to have a settled pair this season. (PTI)

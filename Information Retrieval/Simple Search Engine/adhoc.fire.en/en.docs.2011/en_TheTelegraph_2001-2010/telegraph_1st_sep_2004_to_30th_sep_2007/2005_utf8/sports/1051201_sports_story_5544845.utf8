Calcutta: If you meet Gerd Muller, you have every possibility of mistaking him as a common man. There are no traits that usually surround a superstar. No expression of braggadocio or self-centredness on his face. 

The Der Bomber, who still holds the record of scoring most number of goals (14) in the World Cup finals, loves to live in his own world. This is his uniqueness ? being ordinary and down-to-earth despite extraordinary deeds in a 14-year top-flight football career. 

This is Muller for you, who scored Germanys winning goal in the 1974 World Cup final against Johan Cruyffs Holland, but doesnt nurture any wish to coach the nation. Hes happy to be associated with Bayern Munichs junior team as assistant coach. 

Muller feels Germanys standards have suffered because the countrys pool of talent at the top is not as big as it used to be earlier. 

World football is changing. Smaller nations like Mexico and Japan have moved up the ladder and are challenging traditional superpowers like Italy, England, Germany and Brazil. Nowadays, competition is getting more tougher, the 60-year-old said during an interaction with the media on Wednesday. 

This is the reason why he is not pinning too much hope on the hosts in next years World Cup. Brazil is my favourite and to some extent, Argentina. But I would be happy if Germany make it to the semi-finals, Muller pointed out. 

Contrary to popular belief, European Footballer of the Year in 1970, thinks scoring goal has become easier than before. Had I played now, I would have scored more goals. In the past, there was emphasis on man-marking and defenders used to stick with the forwards. But because of the flat back-four system nowadays, strikers find it easier to penetrate. We now have more focus on the system than the players, he observed. 

According to Muller ? who scored 365 goals for Bayern Munich ? Ronaldinho is one who has impressed him most in recent times. Ronaldo is also good. If he can preserve energy and fitness, he can beat my record, he added. 

Ronaldo has scored 12 goals in three World Cup finals and is three goals away from surpassing the German. 

According to him, standard of the game in India is surprisingly good. 

I watched Mohammedan Sporting (play against Mohun Bagan on Tuesday) and I am surprised that the standard of the game is very good. Teams have the stamina to play 90 minutes. We wont be short on motivation for this tournament because we always play with the same fighting spirit. We need to be cautious when we take on Mohammedan Sporting. 

Muller, however, feels that the Salt Lake Stadium pitch isnt ideal for the game. It is slanting a bit. But at the same time, it will be an experience to play before 1.25 lakh spectators, he said. He was, however, all praise for the Howrah Municipality Stadium, where his side practised earlier in the day. 

The ground is very good. Now it is winter in Germany, and the condition of this ground is better than that of the training grounds back home in Munich now, he said.

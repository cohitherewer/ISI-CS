 Monalisa, Mantu in

New Delhi: In an effort to bring about more transparency, the Table Tennis Federation of India has appointed two women players ? former national champion Mantu Ghosh and Monalisa Mehta ? in its executive body. 

TTFI secretary M.C. Chouhan said their representation would help the federation understand the problems of the players in a better way. 

Mantu and Monalisa were appointed as joint secretaries at a recently-held executive committee meeting of the TTFI.

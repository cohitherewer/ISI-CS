 Beckham will lead in Germany: Eriksson 

 - Real midfielders red card overturned following appeal 

 The overturn allows Beckham to take part in Real Madrid Primera Liga encounter at Deportivo Coruna on Wednesday 

London: David Beckham will captain England at next years World Cup despite his second sending-off in a month, coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said. 

The sending-off decision was, however, overturned late on Tuesday following an appeal by his club Real Madrid. 

I dont have any problem with Beckham as captain, Eriksson told a Manchester newspaper on Tuesday. He is going to be the captain in Germany. 

I have not spoken to him about the dismissal, Eriksson said. I dont know what happened but you do get sent off in football. These things happen in football, they always happen. It will always be like that in football. 

Meanwhile, in a late development, Beckhams red card near the end of Real Madrids 2-1 defeat by Valencia on Sunday was overturned by the Spanish football federation (RFEF) on Tuesday. 

The decision enables the England captain to take part in Reals league match at Deportivo Coruna on Wednesday. 

The Spanish club said that the Federations Competitions Committee had brought forward its weekly meeting in order to deal with a number of matters including their appeal, and had informed the club that Beckham was now free to play. 

Beckham was sent off three minutes from time in Sundays 1-2 defeat at the Bernabeu by referee Arturo Dauden Ibanez after receiving a booking for dissent and then a straight red card for applauding the decision in a sarcastic manner. 

But Real appealed against the red card saying that video evidence and photographs showed that Beckhams clapping was neither scornful nor sarcastic. 

The Competitions Committee decided that Beckhams clapping formed part of his initial protest and therefore the player should only have been punished with the initial booking and not an additional red card. 

The clapping took place when the players back was turned to the referee and when he was returning to his position on the pitch, said the Committee. 

Although the action is worthy of reproach it was not done in direct confrontation and is seen as part of his original protest. 

Neither the incidents themselves nor the referees report suggest that there was an intention to insult or slight the referee. 

Real said the Committee had imposed a fine of 60.1 euros on the club for the incident in accordance with Federation rules. 

Reals Danish midfielder Thomas Gravesen was given also given a straight red card in the Valencia match for a reckless challenge on winger Vicente, but the club did not appeal against that decision. 

Earlier this month Beckham became the first England player to be sent off twice when he was dismissed in a World Cup qualifier against Austria. 

Real have been highly critical of refereeing decisions that have gone against them this season and came close to asking for last months 0-1 defeat against Espanyol to be annulled because of what they said was a refereeing error but they withdrew their threat at the last minute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 This ones special... very special, says Sachin

 - I looked up at the sky, thanked my father for what I have achieved. I missed him... I still miss him 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: From Dhakas unbeaten 159 (he ultimately went on to make 248) on December 11 last year to this Saturday afternoon at the Kotla, the wait took exactly a year to get over. Sachin Tendulkar is now on top of the world ? having surpassed Sunil Gavaskars 34th Test century. Hes batting exactly on 100 and only sky is the limit for the diminutive maestro. 

An out and out professional, the legend choked in emotion as he reflected on the trials and tribulations in his 16-year-old career during the interaction with the media after the match. 

The following are excerpts 

 On the fact that the long wait finally comes to 

 an end? 

 Yeah, its a huge satisfaction. 

On his feeling after reaching the landmark 

I got emotional, honestly speaking. I lifted my bat in joy... Its a relief... I looked up at the sky, thanked my father for what I have achieved. I missed him... I still miss him. 

On whom he wished to dedicate this record 

To my father. Then my brother (Ajit), uncle and aunt, my coach (Ramakant Archrekar), those who always gave me support... Its a whole lot, you know. 

On the difference between your first Test century and this one 

The first one (in Manchester) will remain always memorable. We were trying to save the match and eventually succeeded. But this one is a bit emotional because I was waiting for it to happen. Its special, very special. 

On whether he is feeling on top of the world after surpassing Sunil Gavaskars record 

Heroes are always heroes and Sunil Gavaskar will always remain my hero. You can break a record and set something for others, but you cant eclipse a hero. 

On whether he got a call from his hero 

No, not yet. Because we have to maintain a protocol? You cant receive any call in the dressing room. May be Ill get it soon. 

On whether he has any message for Gavaskar 

Im extremely thankful for whatever support he has given me over the years. I always like senior players cheering and sharing their experience with us. I had met him on so many occasions and sought his advice. Ill always remain grateful to him. 

On the dressing rooms reaction to his feat 

As I was leaving the field, I lifted the bat again just to thank my teammates. Everybody came out to congratulate me. Coach (Greg Chappell) also wished me. I really found it hard to talk to them... Its something which I cant put in words. 

Before I went into the middle, all that we were discussing about was not to think too much about it... Just to go in the middle and enjoy the game. 

On whether he was nervous on 99 

No. I was relaxed and wanted to play my natural game. When Dilhara (Fernando) didnt deliver a ball (in the penultimate over of Day I), I just smiled at him. It was about taking things easy. And talking about pressure, Ive always kept it out of my mind. Once you go out in the middle, forget about x, y and z, and concentrate on what you require to do. 

On whether he had good support from Sourav at the other end 

Its always important to have a good partnership. Weve had a good partnership so far and hope to continue doing the job for the team. 

On his defensive mould in the beginning 

It wasnt like that. Actually, the ball got softer and it was not coming on to the bat as fast as I wanted it to come. But when it was changed, I was able to time the harder ball properly. 

On whether century No. 35 has come a little late for him 

See, between my last century (against Bangladesh in Dhaka in December last) and this one, I played only four Test matches. Had it been a wait for, say, 20-22 Tests, I would have thought so. But I believe such landmarks come along the way... You cant predict a perfect timing. 

On what has been your best century so far 

Different centuries have different values and meanings and they come in different perspectives. But from a batsmans perspective, I reckon my 114 in Perth (in 1992) as the one I still enjoy. 

On the changes in him since his first century 

Physically, Ive grown up... Mentally too. I was 17 years old at that time and now Im 32. I can say that I have 16 years experience behind me and now I can think more maturely than the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif. 

On whether he rues missing out on any 300 so far 

Yes, you may say that. As I said, these things happen as you go along. But why you need to limit yourself within 300... If I score that, you would then ask me what about 400 and so on. Whenever I go out to bat, my sole aim is to score as many runs as possible. 

On his tennis elbow 

Physically, it may have been a break for me, but it totally upset me mentally. Cricket is my life and I couldnt play the game. It was important for me to get over those four-and-a-half month period, with support from my family and well-wishers. The injury took a long time to heal, frustrating my plans of returning to full-time action. 

On the ingredients required to become a Sachin Tendulkar 

Dedication and cent per cent commitment to the game. Ive learnt my game from my family. Had my brother Ajit not taken me to my coach (Archrekar), I wouldnt perhaps become a Sachin Tendulkar. When I started, I was inexperienced. Now, I think, Ive become a good student of the game. 

On his definition of perfect happiness 

I dont know. Its a tough question to answer. Im happy with what Ive achieved. But at the back of your mind, I think, when you meet and spend time with some cancer patients, you feel something special.

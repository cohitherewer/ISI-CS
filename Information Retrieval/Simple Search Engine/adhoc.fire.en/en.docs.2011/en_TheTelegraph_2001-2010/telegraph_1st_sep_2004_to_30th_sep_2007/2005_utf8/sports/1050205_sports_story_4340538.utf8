The Telegraph - Calcutta

 When Eden erupted after Tendulkar?s run out

 - Shaharyar book recounts controversial 1999 Indo-Pak Test 

 Sachin Tendulkar, accompanied by Jagmohan Dalmiya and policemen, goes around the Eden requesting fans to calm down during the 1999 Test 

Islamabad: With 100,000 fans agitated over Sachin Tendulkar?s controversial run out in the Calcutta Test against Pakistan in 1999, a concerned Sunil Gavaskar went to the visitors? dressing room to plead that the Indian maestro be called back by skipper Wasim Akram who would become ?a hero in india for the rest of his life.? 

But Tendulkar was not called back and trouble erupted at the Eden Gardens, forcing play to be called off. The match had to be completed the next day, in front of an empty stadium. 

The story of Gavaskar?s pleadings for the sake of Indo-Pak harmony is disclosed by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Shaharyar Khan in a just-released book focussing on the tour of India in 1999. He was the manager of the team then. 

?I remember Sunil Gavaskar coming over and pleading that for the sake of harmony, skipper Akram should call Tendulkar back. He (Akram) would become a hero in India for the rest of his life,? Shaharyar writes in ?Cricket ? a bridge of peace.? 

Besides Gavaskar, his ?British cricketing friend? Mark Williams sent a note saying Tendulkar should be called back in the interest of bilateral relations while ?neutral cricket professionals? like Ian Chappell and Michael Holding felt the decision should be left to Match Referee Cammie Smith. 

Tendulkar, who had started off well against Shoaib Akhtar, played a wristy stroke towards the mid-wicket boundary. He completed two runs and scrambled to the crease for the third but stumbled after colliding with Shoaib when a throw from the deep hit the stumps. 

Tendulkar was given out by the third umpire, a decision which irked the Eden Gardens audience. 

Reflecting on this incident later in the book, Shaharyar wonders whether crowd trouble had anything to do with betting. 

He says probably some people had ?bet heavily? on an Indian victory as they allowed ?play to continue smoothly till after Tendulkar?s run out incident because 57 runs with four wickets in hand was a gettable target. They only erupted with missiles and bottles when the last pair was in and victory virtually out of sight. 

?Better a no-result than betting loss over a defeat? Why did the notoriously volatile Calcutta crowd so meekly file out of the stadium at police instance? Was it because of its anger at the run out or the loss of a bet which could have been salvaged with an abandoned tie,? Shaharyar wonders.

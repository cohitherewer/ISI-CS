 Hingis hopes to add to Slam tally

Zurich: Former world number one Martina Hingis hopes to add to her tally of five Grand Slam singles titles following her surprise decision to return to the professional game. 

Hingis says she is ready to challenge the worlds best players, despite a three-year absence caused by a string of foot, heel and ankle problems. 

When youve been number one for four years, thats all you want, to compete with the best and possibly win grand slams, the 25-year-old said in an interview on Saturday. 

Thats natural and the most normal thing for me. 

The Swiss, who announced her surprise comeback last week, said she had no specific targets for next year and has not yet finalised exactly where and when she will make her competitive return. 

Her manager Mario Widmer had earlier told reporters Hingis would in all probability compete at one of the Australian tournaments in January before her expected appearance at the Australian Open later that month. 

I dont want to talk about goals because Im a very realistic person and dont want to live in a dream world, Hingis said. 

I would love to be world number one again, but I can only see if thats possible once I start competing again. 

Despite three years on the sidelines, Hingis will need little introduction to her biggest rivals once the new season starts. 

Reassuringly perhaps for Hingis, the next generation of womens tennis players are yet to make much of an impact in the sports upper reaches. Of the current top 10, only Russias Maria Sharapova is yet to face the Swiss.

Seoul: A nervy South Korea managed to get the better of a dogged Uzbekistan 2-1, and in Saitama, Japan overcame Bahrain to get their World Cup qualifying campaigns back on track. 

Japan were lucky to snatch full points in their 1-0 victory thanks to a Mohammed Ahmed own goal on Wednesday. 

In Seoul, second-half goals from Lee Young-pyo and Lee Dong-gook looked to have put Korea in control, but a late strike from Alexander Geynrikh had the 62,000 crowd praying for the final whistle. 

Korea struggled to make headway early on, clearly short of confidence following their 0-2 loss to Saudi Arabia on Friday. 

But after a drab first half, the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists moved up a gear and grabbed the opener in the 54th minute through an Lee Young-pyo effort. 

The second arrived seven minutes later through a stunning volley by Lee Dong-gook from the corner of the box. 

In Saitama, Japan needed maximum points after last Friday?s 2-1 setback in Iran, but they struggled to break down Bahrain?s stubborn resistance until Ahmed?s clumsy error in the 72nd minute. 

Japan coach Zico was under intense pressure to get a result after a fortuitous 2-1 victory at home to North Korea last month and last week?s defeat in Tehran. 

His side dominated possession in Saitama but never seriously threatened until a Takayuki Suzuki effort in the 57th minute, that forced a smart save from goalkeeper Ali Hasan. 

Japan eventually broke through when Ahmed panicked under pressure from a Shunsuke Nakamura free kick and sliced the ball into his own net. 

Meanwhile in Pyonyang, Iran beat North Korea 2-0 on Wednesday in a match that ended in violent scenes to take the outright lead in their World Cup qualifying group. 

The match officials were unable to leave the pitch for 20 minutes after the game, as furious North Korea fans hurled bottles, rocks and chairs in frustration. 

North Korean soldiers and police were forced to step in to restore order at Kim Il-Sung Stadium, after defender Nam Song-chol was sent off for shoving Syrian referee Mohamed Kousa. 

The violence spilled over outside the stadium where thousands of angry North Korea supporters prevented Iran?s players from boarding the team bus. Riot police finally pushed back the crowd far enough for Iran?s squad to depart two hours after the end of the game. 

A deflected free kick from Mehdi Mahdavikia in the 33rd minute and a Javad Nekounam goal 10 minutes from time gave Iran seven points from three games in the final round of Asian 2006 qualifiers. Tempers flared towards the end of the Group B match as Nam was dismissed for pushing Kousa after he had denied the defender a penalty. 

The game was held up for five minutes following Nam?s dismissal as bottles rained down onto the stadium?s running track. 

As trouble re-ignited at the final whistle, security forces were mobilised and stadium announcements warned the crowd of 60,000 to be calm.The result left North Korea?s hopes of qualifying for their second World Cup in tatters after their third consecutive defeat.

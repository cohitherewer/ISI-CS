 Dippenaar out of India tour

Durban: Boeta Dippenaar is out of South Africas tour to India because of a wrist injury, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Friday. 

He saw a hand specialist this (Friday) morning, and a decision was taken for him to undergo an operation on Monday in Cape Town, CSA said in a statement. 

The right-handed batsman will be out for four weeks, which rules him out of the five one-day Internationals South Africa will play in India next month. Uncapped Andrew Puttick will replace Dippenaar against New Zealand in the second one-day International in Cape Town on Friday. 

Utility player AB de Villiers will also sit out Fridays match with a calf strain sustained in training on Wednesday. (Reuters)

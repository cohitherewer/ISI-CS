Calcutta: Mohun Bagan have resorted to all possible efforts to turn the tide in their favour. But till date have failed to do so. 

And as a final attempt, four former green-and-maroon soldiers ? Compton Dutta, Pradip Chowdhury, Manas Bhattacharjee and Bidesh Bose visited the club ground Thursday with an aim to boost up the footballers. 

On the eve of their ninth round match against Vasco Sports Club in the National Football League, Mohun Bagan will be hoping that the pep talk has it?s effect. 

The three-time NFL champions are likely to miss the services of Noel Wilson (owing to injury) and Mehtab Hussain (office commitment). And on the list of doubtfuls are Jo Paul Ancheri and Tomba Singh. 

But Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya is worried with the way fans have reacted so far. ?Supporters are doing no good to the team, on the contrary they are putting more pressure on the side,? Bhattacharya said after Thursday?s practice session. 

He hinted that Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? and Ashim Biswas will form the frontline Friday, but it seemed that the coach is yet to decide on the replacement for in-form Wilson. The green-and-maroon outfits, who are on 11 points after eight matches, are really finding it hard to come back to the winning ways. All their efforts in the last few matches have failed to yield result. Goals conceded towards the end are a major worry for the team. Their Nigerian recruit, Ajibade Babalade, who was expected to lend solidity to the defence will be out of action for few more matches as he is suffering from jaundice. 

On the other hand, Vasco are in deep trouble after collecting only a couple of points after the first eight rounds. But coach Derrick Perreira didn?t sound much worried. ?My team has been playing well, but we have not been able to find the target,? he said, adding that he will be more than happy to collect one point from the match. 

Vasco will be without the services of their two foreigners ? goalkeeper Rogerio Ramos and Brazilian striker Favio. Both are on the injury list. Sydney is the only foreigner who is expected to take the field against Mohun Bagan.

 Pakistan optimistic, even sans captain Inzamam-ul Haq

 - First Test - Anything can happen in cricket, says Chanderpaul 

 Younis Khan 

Bridgetown: Pakistan go into the first of two Tests against the West Indies on Thursday with high hopes of winning a Test series in the Caribbean for the first time. 

The reason for Pakistans optimism stems from the undeniable fact that an international home season that started with much promise for the West Indies, in the form of a gutsy performance by an under-strength side against South Africa, has become engulfed in the gloom of defeat and despair. 

It culminated in Pakistan completing a clean sweep in the just-concluded three-match ODI series that has given them a huge psychological advantage over the hosts. 

Pakistan, however, will be weakened by the absence of regular captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who got a one-Test ban for excessive appealing and showing dissent during the final Test of the India tour in Bangalore. 

Allrounder Shoaib Malik will also not be considered for selection as the PCB has banned him for a Test after he threw a domestic Twenty20 game just before the West Indies tour. 

Younis Khan, on his second tour of the Caribbean, is looking forward to leading Pakistan in Inzamams absence. 

It is a coincidence that I also led the team in the last ODI prior to the Test which has given me a little bit of confidence as captain, Younis said. 

My aim is to remain friendly with all members of the team, and bring the best out of them in the Test. I will not hesitate to take advice from anyone in the middle. 

Pakistan, under Moin Khan, came close to clinching their maiden Test series in the Caribbean on their last tour five years ago. 

We have beaten West Indies 3-0 in the ODI series and it has given us confidence and the psychological advantage over the home team, said Younis. 

West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul still believes his side can put the disappointments behind, and be competitive in the Test series. 

The guys are mentally tough, he said. We have to take the positives out of the last couple of games. 

We have to try and focus on what is ahead and not the past. We have to focus on the two Test matches because this is cricket and anything can happen. 

Chanderpaul added that he was banking on the experience of his players to pull them through the two Tests, despite a long season, and the string of defeats. 

Hopefully, we can get it right, and get our minds back on Test cricket, and we can go out, and do the job, he said. 

It just boils down to if you can apply yourself. There are simple basic things that we need to do, and do it better than the opposition. We need to apply ourselves, and stay out there and bat as long as we can. 

Kensington Oval, hosting its final international fixture before undergoing major renovation to host matches in the 2007 World Cup, has not been a happy hunting ground for the West Indies in recent times. 

The home team has lost its last four Tests here, including the third match of the recent series against South Africa a month ago.

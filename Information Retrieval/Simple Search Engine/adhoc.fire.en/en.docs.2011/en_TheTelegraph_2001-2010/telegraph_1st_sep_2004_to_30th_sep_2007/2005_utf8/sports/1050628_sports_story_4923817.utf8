 Im playing better and better: Maria

London: Like a cat stalking her prey, Maria Sharapova lay in wait for Nathalie Dechys moment of distraction at Wimbledon on Monday before pouncing to win in two sets. 

Prowling round the baseline in their fourth-round match, the defending champion played well within herself until the seventh game of the first set when Dechy lost concentration, then her serve, to a whipping backhand return down the line. 

After that Dechy went the way of Sharapovas three previous victims, mauled on the Wimbledon turf for the loss of a total of 17 games and no sets. 

Im playing better and better, said the 18-year-old. Once you are in the second week, mentally and physically you have to be much tougher. Im really excited... I love being out there. I love competing especially here. 

Third seed Amelie Mauresmo, who overcame a torrid start to beat Elena Likhovtseva, said: The beginning of the match was a little bit tough for me, I couldnt find my rhythm. 

Maybe the two days off were a little bit too much. The second set was much better, I was more aggressive, finding my game, my rhythm, getting in, reading the ball pretty well. (Reuters)

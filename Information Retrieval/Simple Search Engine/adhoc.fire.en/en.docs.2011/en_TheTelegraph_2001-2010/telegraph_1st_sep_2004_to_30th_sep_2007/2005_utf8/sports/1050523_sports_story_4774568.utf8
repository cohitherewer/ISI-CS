 Randhawa finishes joint 35th

 Jyoti Randhawa 

Okayama: Jyoti Randhawa found birdies hard to come by and ended with a two-under 70 on the final day to finish tied 35th in the Munsingwear Open 2005, KSB Cup at the par-72 Tojigaoka Marine Hills Golf Club here. 

Randhawa carded five-under for the day after the first seven holes, including an eagle on par-5 second hole, and then three straight birdies from fifth to seventh, but then the birdies dried up. He completed the week at an aggregate of four-under 284. 

He bogeyed the 11, 13th and the closing hole 18th to finish disappointingly. His four rounds were 71, 70, 73 and 70 and he improved from his overnight place of tied 46th. 

This was only the second start for Randhawa this season in Japan and he missed the cut last week at the Japan PGA championships.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Best player trophy may be named after Foe

 Fifa dedicated the Argentina-Mexico semi-final to Foe 

Frankfurt: Fifa is considering a permanent memorial to honour Marc-Vivien Foe, the Cameroon international who collapsed on the pitch and died during the last Confederations Cup competition in France two years ago. 

Fifa president Sepp Blatter, speaking two years and a day after the death of the 28-year-old whose clubs included Olympique Lyon, West Ham United and Manchester City, told a news conference that Fifas Ethics Committee would be considering the matter on Tuesday. 

Blatter said it was possible Fifa would name a trophy after him to be awarded to the outstanding player in the Confederations Cup. 

There was a suggestion to name the Confederations Cup competition after him, but in the end the African confederation thought it was better for the competition to have a neutral name. 

Now one of the things the Ethics Committee will discuss is a trophy for the best player of the tournament named after him. 

It is right that we should never forget what happened and maintain the memory of this player. 

Many people linked to football die all the time but his death was a very emotional one. We have already established a foundation of one million Swiss francs ($789,900) to provide for his family and for the education of his three young children. 

Foe, with no-one around him, suddenly fell to the ground in the 72nd minute of Cameroons semi-final with Colombia in Lyon on June 26, 2003 and never regained consciousness. A heart problem was later diagnosed as the probable cause of death. 

Fifa dedicated Sundays semi-final between Argentina and Mexico in Hanover to his memory and are also putting in place plans to prevent a repetition of the tragedy. 

All 32 teams at next years World Cup finals will be required to present evidence that their players hearts are in good condition in an effort to prevent further cases of sudden cardiac arrest in footballers. 

The aim is to identify problems in advance, using special sports-cardiological diagnostics, said Fifa medical co-ordinator Professor Toni Graf-Baumann of Germany.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pathan was the main culprit

Guest Column

 It was no secret that spinners 

 would matter in the match, perhaps in the series. India 

 perceive South Africa to be vulnerable in this area and 

 would now be further emboldened. But there is also the danger 

 that they may overplay the card.

 South Africa is not as bad against 

 slow bowlers, though different conditions tend to complicate 

 the matters of footwork. Pitches in the two countries bear 

 little resemblance in pace or bounce. We would see if the 

 remaining week of the series is enough to come to terms 

 with these conditions.

 Ironically, on Saturday, spinners 

 didnt precipitate the crisis. It was Irfan Pathan. 

 South Africa would like to hold him up as the culprit. I 

 am very impressed how quickly he assesses the conditions 

 and opponents. There is a sense of plan in his methods.

 In one-dayers, it is very difficult 

 to come back if you lose early wickets. India made a good 

 start and built on the advantage as the innings wore on. 

 South Africa could not have risked too much and it made 

 the spinners job easy. I wonder if it would still 

 have been the same if South Africa were 50 for no loss.

 There is no mistaking the merits 

 of Graeme Smiths men. The side has many matchwinners 

 with depth in batting and bowling. Justin Kemps name 

 is quick to recall though Jacques Kallis could as effortlessly 

 shift gears and is an excellent finisher of a game.

 It still would have served this 

 team greatly had Jonty Rhodes been around. Besides his other 

 values, he was an exciting player of spin. Somebody needs 

 to put up his hand and cast himself in Jontys mould.

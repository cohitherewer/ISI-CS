The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tough ask for Paes-Zimonjic

 - Atp masters cup 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi conquered many a peak during their years of togetherness. The year-ending doubles championship, however, eluded them. The Indians, who once ruled the world of doubles, played three finals (1997, 1999 and 2000) in the World Doubles Championship and came out second-best in all three. 

With the 2005 season-ending meet, called the Masters Cup, set to kick off in Shanghai on Sunday, Paes has earned another crack at the title, this time with Serbian Nenad Zimonjic, while Bhupathi is cooling heels back home. 

Paes and Zimonjic, who qualified for the eight-team field as the fifth-best pair, open their campaign on Sunday with a tough match against Mark Knowles (Bahamas) and Daniel Nestor (Canada). Knowles and Nestor are one of the most experienced and long-lasting pairs and have won both their clashes with Paes and Zimonjic so far. 

American top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan, and Aussies Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley are the other teams in the Red Group. While Paes and Zimonjic have won one and lost two against the Bryan brothers, they are tied at 1-1 with Arthurs and Hanley. 

The Gold group comprises second seeds Jonas Bjorkman (Sweden) and Max Mirnyi (Belarus), third seeds Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett (Zimbabwe), Frenchmen Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro, and Wimbledon champions Stephen Huss and Wesley Moodie. 

The round-robin matches, to be held simultaneously with the singles competition, will be gone through over the first six days. The semi-finals, featuring the top two from each group, have been scheduled for Saturday. The finals will come off next Sunday. 

Paes and Zimonjic have had a moderately successful year, winning two titles on clay (Monte Carlo and Barcelona) in the first half of the year and making two finals (Stockholm and Madrid) in the indoor hardcourt season recently. But in a tournament featuring the very best in business, it will take Paes and Zimonjic a very special effort to make a deep impact.

 French blisters haunt Safin 

 - ROLAND GARROS DIARY

Marat Safin stares at his hands a lot, praying he wont spot another blister. 

Little is more troublesome to a power-hitting player than pain from gripping the racket, something Safin knows well after getting blisters on both hands at last years French Open. Just the thought of it is alarming. 

Im scared, actually, Safin said after his four-set first-round win over Raemon Sluiter. I have no idea where they came from. I am praying they will not come back again. 

During pauses in the match, the two-time Grand Slam winner stared intensely at the palm of his racket hand. But no blisters this time around ? not yet, at least. 

For now, Safin, the third seed, has other concerns. 

My knee hurts a little bit sometimes ? if I spend a lot of time on the court, said Safin, who has a tendency to stretch into lengthy five-setters. 

One of those came last year ? and, with it, the blisters. In the third round of the 2004 French Open, Safin played through the pain to beat Potito Starace in five sets. He exited in the next round, playing with thick tape wrapped around both hands. 

This year, Safin has earned the distinction of being one of only two men to have beaten top-ranked Roger Federer. That was on Safins way to the Australian Open trophy. Since then, the Russian has failed to move past a quarter final in any tournament. But hes not worried. 

 I cant complain. Ive been playing 

 quite decent tennis, said Safin, who has said that 

 Roland Garros is more important to him than any other tournament. 

 Hopefully, I will survive into the second week.

 No sympathy for Andre 

 Andre Agassi may have limped out of the French Open, but fellow-American Andy Roddick was not about to shed any tears. Its a little tough to feel sorry for someone whos won every tournament in the world, Roddick said as he broke into fits of laughter. 

Agassi was left hobbling on court Tuesday after his 35-year-old body let him down Tuesday during a five-set loss to Finnish qualifier Jarkko Nieminen. 

As a friend, Im disappointed for him, Roddick said after becoming one of only three American men to reach the second round. You know, hes had his time here. Obviously, I dont know if this is his favourite surface any more. But its too bad. 

Agassi sealed his place in tennis history when he became the fifth man to win all four Grand Slam titles after his success at Roland Garros in 1999. He also became the player with the maximum Grand Slam appearances, this one being his 58th which took him past Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, Michael Chang and Wayne Ferreira. 

We all know what hes done on the court, said Roddick, who was four when Agassi first gained attention on the world stage. For me hes been more of a mentor. I think where Ive learned the most from him is off the court, whether it be dealing with you (the media), on a personal level, you know, kind of how to handle your responsibilities, and even more than that. Ive kind of learned by watching him. 

 Hes been nothing but good to me.

 Justines new outlook 

 Justine Henin-Hardenne says an illness that sidelined her for much of last year has changed her game ? but not her spirits. 

Im never going to be the same, said the former world No. 1 and 2003 French Open champion. I dont want to compare myself (to how) I was before my illness or before a lot of chronic fatigue. 

Henin-Hardenne has put behind her a seven-month absence to win three claycourt titles this spring. She extended her winning streak to 18 matches by beating Conchita Martinez in three sets on Tuesday. 

Henin-hardenne was dominant at first but shaky at the finish. She double-faulted nine times, and in the final set nearly blew a 5-1 lead before closing out her first Grand Slam match since the US Open last summer. 

Henin-Hardenne, who has won a trophy at every Slam but Wimbledon, suffered a blood virus that sidelined her most of last year. She started playing again in December. A knee injury forced her to pull out of the Australian Open, ending her hopes of defending her title. 

 Illness and absence have given 

 the Belgian a new perspective on matches that would have 

 rattled her before. Im not going to cry... That 

 I could have done it in two sets, Henin-Hardenne said. 

 Im much cooler than I used to be.

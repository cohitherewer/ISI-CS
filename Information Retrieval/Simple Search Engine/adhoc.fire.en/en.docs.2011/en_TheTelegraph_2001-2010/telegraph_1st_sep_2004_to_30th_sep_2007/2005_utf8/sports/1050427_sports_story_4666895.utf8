 Sourav will be back as captain: Yuvraj

New Delhi: Yuvraj Singh is confident Indian captain Sourav Ganguly will make a strong comeback after serving the six-match ODI ban. 

?I am sure Sourav will come back stronger after serving the ban and lead the team,? Yuvraj said on the sidelines of a function organised by the Delhi Diabetes Research Centre here on Monday. 

Sourav was slapped a six-match ban by Match Referee Chris Broad after the team failed to complete the quota of overs in the stipulated time in the fourth ODI against Pakistan earlier this month. He will miss the first four ODIs of the tri-series in Sri Lanka in July. 

Asked whether Sourav?s absence was felt in the last two ODIs against Pakistan, Yuvraj said: ?Yes it did affect the team. After all, it?s Sourav?s team.? 

The flamboyant left-hander said he was interested in playing for some county side in England but added that didn?t have any offers as of now. (PTI)

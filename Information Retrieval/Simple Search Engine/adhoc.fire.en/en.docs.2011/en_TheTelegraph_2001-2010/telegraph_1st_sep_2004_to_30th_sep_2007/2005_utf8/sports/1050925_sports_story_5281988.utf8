London: Chelseas Frank Lampard fired the champions to a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa but there was a shock for Manchester United as they went down 1-2 at home to Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. 

Chelseas seventh league win in as many games gave them a double-digit lead over their main title rivals after United were stunned by two goals from Norwegian forward Morten Gamst Pedersen and Arsenal drew 0-0 at West Ham. 

Charlton Athletics charmed start to the season continued as they stayed second with a 2-1 victory at West Bromwich Albion, while England striker Michael Owen was Newcastle Uniteds matchwinner as they beat Manchester City 1-0. Everton were booed off after losing 1-0 at home to promoted Wigan Athletic, their eighth defeat in nine games this season in all competitions. 

Earlier in the day, France striker Djibril Cisse rescued a point for Liverpool with a late penalty in a 2-2 draw at Birmingham City. 

Substitute Cisse scored from the spot on 85 minutes after Neil Kilkenny had been sent off for handling Jamie Carraghers header on the goalline after the ball had bounced down off the crossbar. 

After a dull opening 45 minutes at St Andrews, all four goals came in an explosive 17-minute spell. Liverpool went ahead on 68 minutes through Luis Garcias fine finish ? the Merseysiders first league goal from open play this season ? but two defensive blunders quickly handed Birmingham the initiative. 

Defender Stephen Warnock diverted Julian Grays cross past his own goalkeeper Pepe Reina for the equaliser after 72 minutes and the Spanish stopper was then at fault as Steve Bruces side scored again three minutes later. 

Reina dropped Emile Heskeys header and after Kilkennys header had been blocked substitute Walter Pandiani stabbed home. 

Meanwhile, in Germany, Hamburg SV brought Bayern Munichs 15-match winning run to an end on Saturday, as goals from Rafael van der Vaart and Piotr Trochowski earned them a 2-0 home victory against the champions. 

Bayern stay top of the table with 18 points from seven games, with Hamburg just a point behind them in second spot. Third-placed Werder Bremen also closed on the leaders, winning 2-1 at home to Bayer Leverkusen. (Reuters)

 ICC rejects Pak plea

Karachi: The International Cricket Council has rejected Pakistans proposal of two neutral umpires in ODIs, a PCB official said. 

ICCs cricket committee felt that if two third-country umpires were introduced in ODIs, it would deny the grooming of local umpires. In addition, cost element was also one of the factors, Saleem Altaf, PCBs director operations, who attended the ICC executive meeting, said from London. 

Meanwhile, the ICC will experiment by providing umpires with radios to communicate with each other but wont allow the public and broadcasters to hear their conversation. 

The new technology will be tried out at Octobers Johnnie Walker Super Series in Australia, according to chief executive Malcolm Speed. 

Ehsan Mani has accepted a 12-month extension and will continue as ICC president. 

In another move, Slovenia, Mali, Jersey and Guernsey have been granted ICC associate membership. (Agencies)

 Zimbabwe A aim to gain experience 

Mumbai: The Duleep Trophy clash with North Zone provides the visiting Zimbabwe A team with an ideal opportunity to get much-needed experience of playing in India without the pressures of international competition. 

Basically its an exposure trip for us. We are expecting to do well in the tournament as our batting seems to be clicking, the visitors coach Kevin Curran said on Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Hemang Badani would lead South against Central in their second Duleep Trophy match in Surat from Thursday. 

South skipper V.V.S. Laxman will skip the meet due to family problems whereas absence of Anil Kumble and Venugopal Rao will disappoint the spectators here. (PTI)

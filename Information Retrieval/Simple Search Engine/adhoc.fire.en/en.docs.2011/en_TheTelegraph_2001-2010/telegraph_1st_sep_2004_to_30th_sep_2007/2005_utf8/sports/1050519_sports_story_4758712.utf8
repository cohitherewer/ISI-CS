 Injury may keep Clijsters away

 - Hewitt hopes to play despite fracturing rib 

 Clijsters is struggling with her right knee 

Brussels: Belgiums Kim Clijsters may miss the French Open as she struggles to recover from ligament damage to her right knee. 

Clijsters, a two-time runner-up at Roland Garros, will travel to Paris this week for intensive training sessions to test the injury she sustained at the German Open earlier this month. The two-week Major opens Monday. 

As soon as I will feel any pain during training, I will stop, the Belgian said on her website on Wednesday. 

If everything goes according to plan, I will start the tournament, but I will not take any risk in a match. 

The former top-ranked player strained knee ligaments in Berlin while chasing down a ball against Patty Schnyder. 

She was forced to rest for eight days and resumed training on Tuesday with her knee heavily strapped. 

I still cannot move freely about the court, she said. 

Clijsters, ranked 17th, already made one comeback from injury this year. 

After reaching the top ranking in 2003, she sat out most of 2004 after surgery on her left wrist and pulled out of Januarys Australian Open. 

Clijsters returned after a 10-month layoff at the Indian Wells tournament in March at 133 in the rankings, and beat top-ranked Lindsay Davenport in the Final. The next week, she won the Nasdaq-100 open in Miami. 

Clijsters reached the French Open final in 2001, losing in three sets to Jennifer Capriati. Two years later, she lost to fellow-Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne. 

Decision time 

Meanwhile, Australian world No. 2 Lleyton Hewitt remains hopeful he will play at the Open, despite fracturing a rib in a fall this month, adds a report from Sydney. 

Hewitt sustained the injury at his Sydney home two weeks ago, forcing him to delay his comeback at the World Team Cup in Germany. 

Hewitts manager Rob Aivatoglou said a final decision would have to be taken by Friday to allow the player to get to Paris on time. 

Hewitt, whose fianc?e Bec Cartwright is expecting their child later this year, has not played since injuring his toe after losing to Roger Federer in the final at Indian Wells in March but definitely plans to compete at Wimbledon. 

Australias top-ranked female tennis player, Alicia Molik, has returned to training after being forced to pull out of the French Open. 

Molik was sidelined for five weeks with a middle-ear infection but has begun her preparations for Wimbledon where she could be a genuine contender. 

I would have loved to have played in Paris and I would have loved to have been playing in the last month-and-a-half, Molik said. When Im ready to play, Ill be ready to play at 100 per cent. (AGENCIES)

 Rejuvenated Pierce ready for Russians

 - Happy to be reunited with team 

 Mary Pierce 

Paris: A revitalised Mary Pierce is eager to return to her favourite venue for the Fed Cup final at Roland Garros this weekend after making a full recovery from a thigh injury sustained during the US Open. 

Pierce, 30, who lost in the final to Belgiums Kim Clijsters, showed no ill effects during training with the France team on Wednesday. 

I was happy to be reunited with the team, she said. I played with no strap around my thigh, which means the three days of rest Ive just had have done me a lot of good. Above all, I was delighted to be back on that centre court. I love it. 

To help overcome the stress from her American fortnight and the subsequent jet lag, Pierce has undergone a new relaxation technique by exposing herself to a special lamp. I like it, she said. It works, I feel fine. 

Pierce has many fond memories of Roland Garros. She won the final in 2000 and was also a finalist in 1994 and again this year. Since we won the semi-final, Ive been thinking about that final at Roland Garros, said Pierce, who is the only player to be part of both Frances Fed Cup triumphs in 1997 and 2003. 

Ive played so many matches here and I have so many great memories.

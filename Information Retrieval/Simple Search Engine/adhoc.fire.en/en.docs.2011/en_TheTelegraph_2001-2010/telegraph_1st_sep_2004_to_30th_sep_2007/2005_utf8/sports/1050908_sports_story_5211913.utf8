Calcutta: Heptathletes Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singha Roy, gold and silver medallists at the just-concluded Asian Track and Field meet, arrived to a rousing reception at Howrah Station on Wednesday. For a while , the fanfare also resulted in pandemonium. 

Soma amassed 5377 points to strike gold while Sushmita garnered 5309 for her silver winning effort. 

Their chaotic arrival was similar to what everyone expects when most sought-after Indian sportpersons arrive here. But the striking difference lies elsewhere ? while sportspersons of other disciplines fly in, even after losing, Soma and Sushmita took the train (Poorva Express), not even the Rajdhani, from New Delhi after making the country proud a few days back in Incheon City. 

Though I won the gold there, my target is to score above 6000, Soma told The Telegraph, while coming out from coach AS I. I cannot recall the last time two Bengal athletes grabbed the gold and silver in an Asian meet, and this gives me immense pleasure, Soma said. 

Though focusing on the Commonwealth Games in March, the Doha Asian Games is always at the back of both the athletes minds. It is the Asian Games where I want to do something, Sushmita remarked, admitting the fact that she never expected a medal here too. 

According to Soma, she has silenced her critics by the performance and feels that there is still a lot fire left in her. I know performance is everything, and I am capable of doing better, she stated. 

Sushmita, on the other hand, was much subdued and spoke mainly how Somas success helped her in grabbing the medal. Im very happy that Somadi has clinched the gold, Sushmita said. But she admitted that she has to work hard on javelin for overall improvement. 

But both of them wish to spend the long lay-off till March, by working on the events in which they have fared not so well. 

The duo was given a warm welcome by the federation officials, South Eastern Railway staff, officials from other disciplines, and obviously the over-enthusiasts, who didnt have any idea about who arrived. Is it Sushmita Sen! one of them yelled, after hearing the name of Sushmita.

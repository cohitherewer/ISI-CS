 Souravs work permit to be ready in time

London: Decks will be cleared for Team India captain Sourav Ganguly to play for Glamorgan in a championship match in Swansea vs Sussex on June 1 with his county confirming that arrangements for Souravs work permit was on and all will be ready well before time. 

It is going to be ok. We will be getting the work permit for Ganguly next week, a spokeswoman for the club said here. 

It may be recalled that last year, paceman Zaheer Khan had to render his service to Surrey for free since, having originally come to England for training, could get the work permit only at the last minute. 

Sourav has been signed up for a two-month period. 

The BCCI on Friday gave its formal clearance for Sourav to play in the county.

 China beat Indonesia to crown

Beijing: China trounced Indonesia 3-0 to lift the prestigious Sudirman Cup for the fifth time in nine editions of the world mixed team badminton meet here on Sunday. 

Zhang Jun and Gao Ling opened Chinas account with a 12-15, 15-5, 15-8, win over Nova Widianto and Lilyana Natsir in the opening mixed doubles rubber. The second rubber, the mens singles, produced the match of the tournament, with Chinas world No.1 Lin Dan taking on Taufil Hidayat, the Athens Olympics gold medallist. 

The 21-year-old Lin shot off to a 4-0 lead but after that they matched each other shot for shot. 

Lin, however, held his nerve to clinch the first game 17-15, and then outthought his opponent to take the second game 15-9 and give China their second point. 

Zhang Ning, the womens world No.2, cemented Chinas fifth Sudirman Cup victory with an 11-1, 11-7 demolition of Fransisca Hari.

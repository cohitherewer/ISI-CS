 Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh 

Kuala Lumpur: Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh continue to be the only Indian golfers in top-10 of the Asian Tour Order of Merit at the end of 14 events in 2005. 

Thaworn Wiratchant has in the meantime displaced fellow Thai player, Thongchai Jaidee from the top of the Order of Merit. The in-form Thai star is enjoying a rich vein of form this season and claimed the top spot on Sunday, by finishing second in the Maekyung Open. Thaworn now leads the merit list with $326,229, already a career high. 

Jyoti has played six events for $184,120, while Jeev has played nine and earned $116,478. Jyotis best finish has been second at the Carlsberg Malaysian Open besides tied 11th in Qatar and tied 16th at BMW Asian Open. 

Jeev has three top-10s with tied second at Asia Japan Okinawa Open, tied 10th at Thai Airway Thailand Open, and tied-tenth at BMW Asian Open. 

Two other Indians figure in the top 60. Harmeet Kahlon is 46th, while Amandeep Johl just squeezed into the top-60 with his tied 15th place at Maekyung Open. Shiv Kapur is 64th. The top 60 players retain full playing rights for the following season. 

With 14 more events left in the season, a few other Indians have a chance of getting into the top-60. (PTI)

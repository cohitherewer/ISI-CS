The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rana starts bowling at nets in two days

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Pakistan medium-pacer Rana Naved-ul Hasan is hoping to start bowling within a couple of days after injuring his right shoulder during the Mohali Test. 

According to him, the possibility of making himself available for the third Test in Bangalore will depend on how he feels about bowling at nets. 

?The pain is still there? so my fitness programme now centres around going to the gym and swimming. I hope to start bowling in two days? Let?s see how it works,? Rana said on Friday. 

Incidentally, the MRI report has taken the Pakistani bowler by surprise since it revealed that the injury was an old one. 

?It?s pretty surprising. I don?t know how and when it occurred. I?m keeping my fingers crossed for the next Test,? he maintained. 

Rana picked the injury while fielding in the Mohali Test and was replaced by Mohammed Khalil in the ongoing Eden Test. 

He took one for 133 in the first innings and went wicketless in the second of the first Test, which ended in a draw. 

Ghavri opinion 

Former India medium-pacer and current Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri, meanwhile, has been watching the Pakistani bowling line-up, especially their seamers. 

His feelings semed an echo of so many opinions, that the visitors lacked strength in the fast-bowling department. ?Except for (Mohammed) Sami, rest of the seamers have so far been ordinary,: Ghavri said on Friday.

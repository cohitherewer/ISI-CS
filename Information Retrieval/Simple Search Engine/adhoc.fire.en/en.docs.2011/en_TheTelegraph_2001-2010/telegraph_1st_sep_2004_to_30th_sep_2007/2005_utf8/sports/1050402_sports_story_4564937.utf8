Miami: Former world number one Kim Clijsters crushed top seed Amelie Mauresmo 6-1, 6-0 on Thursday to reach the final of the Nasdaq-100 Open, where she will meet Maria Sharapova who earlier beat Venus Williams 6-4, 6-3. 

Men?s number one seed Roger Federer maintained his unbeaten record with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Tim Henman to set up a semi-final meeting with Andre Agassi, who demolished his fellow American Taylor Dent 7-5, 6-0. 

Unseeded Clijsters whipped past Mauresmo in just 62 minutes to extend her winning streak to 13 matches and stay on course for back-to-back titles following her victory at Indian Wells 13 days ago. 

Clijsters has lost just one match since returning to the tour in February after missing most of the 2004 season with a wrist injury. 

?Things have clicked into place really quickly,? said Clijsters. ?In Indian Wells it was like a dream and now it?s even more amazing. I?m enjoying myself and everything is in place at the moment.? 

Looking sprightly and fleet-footed, Clijsters signalled her intent by breaking Mauresmo?s serve early in the first set and from then on was never troubled by the Frenchwoman. ?She just played unbelievable tennis,? said Mauresmo. ?She?s in huge confidence, so everything that she goes for is in.? 

Swiss Federer eased past Briton Henman to book his place in the last four with his 30th win of the year and his 20th consecutive victory since losing to Marat Safin at the Australian Open in January. 

?I had a bad record against Tim, but now I look at the draw and I?m really not scared of anybody,? said the world number one. 

Agassi, who has won the title in Miami six times, took just 70 minutes to deal with Dent. After Agassi took the first set with a late break of serve, Dent?s body and spirit both proved vulnerable in the second. 

At 0-4 down Dent received treatment on an ankle injury and thereafter put up little resistance. 

?This has been a place I?ve always loved playing,? said Agassi, who is married to Steffi Graf. ?It?s the only tournament that I?ve won more times than my wife so that?s a pretty big accomplishment in my house.? 

Federer said he was looking forward to taking on Agassi for the chance to play in the final against David Ferrer or Rafael Nadal, who meet in the other, all-Spanish, semi-final. 

?He?s one of the last legends in tennis and you want to be able to play him as much as you can,? said Federer, who has won six of their nine career meetings. 

Wimbledon champion Sharapova will have to be at her best to beat Clijsters in Saturday?s final but on Thursday was just happy to enjoy the moment. 

?I?m in the final and I feel fantastic,? said the 17-year-old.

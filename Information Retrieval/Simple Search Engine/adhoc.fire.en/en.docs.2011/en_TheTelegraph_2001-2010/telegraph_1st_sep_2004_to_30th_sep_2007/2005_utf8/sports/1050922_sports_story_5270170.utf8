Colombo: Dilhara Fernando led a pack of sharp Sri Lankan pacers to push minnows Bangladesh closer to defeat in the second and final Test here on Wednesday. 

Trailing by 266 runs, Bangladesh were struggling at 131 for four in their second innings at stumps on the second day. Mohammed Ashraful was batting on 21 with night-watchman Shahadat Hossain. 

Sri Lankas fast bowlers claimed 10 of the 14 Bangladeshi wickets that fell on the day with Fernando exposing the tourists batting limitations with seven wickets. 

Fernando bagged five for 60 in the first innings and two for 25 in the second to finish the day with seven for 85, his best figures in 18 Tests. It was the first time he had bagged five wickets in an innings. 

Lasith Malinga took two first-innings wickets with his slinging action, while left-arm seamer Chaminda Vaas chipped in with one in the second. 

Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan took three for 47 as Bangladesh were shot out for 191 in their first innings in reply to the hosts 457 for nine declared. He claimed one more in the second when well-set Shahriar Nafees (51) was caught by Thilan Samaraweera at first slip. 

Sri Lankan bowlers were smartly backed by wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara, who had a hand in the five dismissals in the first innings. 

Sri Lanka earlier added eight runs to their overnight total of 449 for seven before declaring.

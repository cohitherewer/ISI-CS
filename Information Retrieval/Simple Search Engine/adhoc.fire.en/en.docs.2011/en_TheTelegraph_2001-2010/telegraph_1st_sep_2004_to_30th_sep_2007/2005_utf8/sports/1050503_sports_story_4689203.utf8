 Indians go down tamely

New Delhi: Indian women could do no better than their men counterparts as they went down in the first round of the singles events of the 48th world table tennis championships in Shanghai, China Monday. 

Nandita Saha, unlucky to be drawn against third seed Chinese Niu Jianfeng in the opening round, was a no match to her higher ranked opponent as she lost 4-11, 2-11, 8-11, 2-11, according to information received here. Another Indian in the fray, Visakha Vijay, repeated Saha?s performance to go down 5-11, 7-11, 4-11, 6-11 to Tatyana Kostromia of Belarus. 

Top two players ? national champion Poulami Ghatak and Mouma Das ? have opted out of the championships. 

In mixed doubles, Achanta Sharath Kamal and Mamta Prabhu reached the second round after they got a walkover from Bode Abiodum and Atisi Owoh of Nigeria. Up against Singapore?s Xiao Li Cai and Jia Wei Li they lost the battle in five games 1-4 (9-11, 11-13, 2-11, 11-7, 6-11). 

The other three Indian entries also bowed out without posing much challenge to their opponents. (PTI)

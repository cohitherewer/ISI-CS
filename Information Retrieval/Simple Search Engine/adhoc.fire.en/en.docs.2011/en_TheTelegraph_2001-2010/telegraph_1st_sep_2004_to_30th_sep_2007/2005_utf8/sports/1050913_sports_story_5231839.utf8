 England regain Ashes, at last

London: Kevin Pietersen defied his close friend Shane Warne to score an outrageous maiden Test century and seal Englands first Ashes triumph for almost two decades on Monday. 

Pietersen broke Australian hearts as he brushed off three dropped catches to score 158 and ensure a draw on the last day of the weather-affected fifth and final Test at The Oval. That gave the home team a 2-1 series win. 

Six runs ahead after the first innings and resuming their second on 34 for one, England recovered from a top-order collapse to bat almost the entire day before being dismissed for 335. 

The world champion Australians were left to face less than an over from Steve Harmison, getting to four without loss before accepting an offer of bad light and their historic defeat. 

The South Africa-born Pietersen was eighth man out, bowled by Glenn McGrath, but by then he had saved the game. 

He hit seven sixes and 15 fours, faced 187 balls and batted for four and three-quarter hours, helping to put on 60 for the sixth wicket with Paul Collingwood and 109 for the seventh with Ashley Giles who made 59. 

Warne produced another brilliant performance to take six wickets for 124 to go with his six in the first innings, but did not get enough support. 

England last won the Ashes in 1986-87. Australias winning streak began in the summer of 1989 and since then they had a record eight series win in a row. 

When Man-of-the-Match Pietersen was finally dismissed, Warne ran over to him to shake his hand as he headed for the pavilion in the evening shadows. 

Michael Vaughans side had looked to be tottering towards defeat at lunch as the collective genius of Warne and McGrath reduced them to 127 for five. 

It was McGrath, however, who made the breakthrough. Vaughan, on 45, edged and Adam Gilchrist dived full-length for a fine one-handed catch. One ball later it was 67 for two, Bell completing a pair. 

Next over Pietersen suffered another heart stopping moment. Yet to score, he feathered a chance which brushed Gilchrists fingertips and evaded Matthew Hayden at slip. 

On 15, the 25-year-old batsman then edged the bristling Lee to Warne. 

Trescothick had less luck. A magical Warne ball jagged back out of the rough and trapped him leg before for 33, making it 109 for four. Soon Andrew Flintoff, the heart of the English team and later named Man of the Series, was driving lamely back to Warne.

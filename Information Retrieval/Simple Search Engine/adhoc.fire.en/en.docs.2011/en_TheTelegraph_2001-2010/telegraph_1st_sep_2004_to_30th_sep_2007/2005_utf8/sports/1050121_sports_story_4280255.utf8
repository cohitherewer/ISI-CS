 PCB to okay venues after inspection

Islamabad: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday said it would give its green signal to the proposed venues for the forthcoming tour of India only if its expert team submits a positive report. 

?I am aware of the announcement by the Indian board but these are only proposed venues. In any case, a team of two officials, called the Venue Assessment Team (VAT), will visit India and we will take a decision only after they submit their assessment report,? PCB spokesperson Abbas Zaidi said over the phone on Thursday. 

Zaidi said the VAT members, Sohail Khan and former Pakistan quick Zakir Khan, would leave for India on January 24 and complete the inspection in five days. 

Sohail Khan was the security liaison officer for the Indian team on their tour of Pakistan in 2004 and Zakir Khan is the general manager-operations of the PCB. 

Pakistan cricket team is tentatively scheduled to arrive in India on February 25 to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals. Asked if the PCB would send a separate team to assess security measures, Zaidi said, ?I think security is the prerogative of the host government.?

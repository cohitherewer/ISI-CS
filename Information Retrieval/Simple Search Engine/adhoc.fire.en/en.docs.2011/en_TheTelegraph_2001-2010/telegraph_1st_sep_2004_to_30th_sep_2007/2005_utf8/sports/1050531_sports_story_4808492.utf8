 Tommy Robredo packs off ill-tempered Safin

Paris: Former world number one Justine Henin-Hardenne soaked up the full force of Svetlana Kuznetsovas armoury to stay in the hunt for a second French Open crown as both 2004 mens finalists were beaten on Monday. 

The lightweight Belgian survived two match-points to see off US Open champion Kuznetsova 7-6, 4-6, 7-5 and set up a quarter final match against Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova. 

An ill-tempered Marat Safin was knocked out by Tommy Robredo in a late fourth-round match on Monday. The Spaniard won 7-5, 1-6, 6-1, 4-6, 8-6. 

Its a kind of miracle, Henin, the 2003 champion, said. I managed to stay in the match even though I was not able to play my best tennis. 

While the fancied 10th seed survived, two Argentine favourites for the mens title were knocked out ? holder Gaston Gaudio and the man he beat for the 2004 title, Guillermo Coria. 

Fifth seed Gaudio, who had not dropped a set on his way to the last 16, was beaten 6-2, 4-6, 6-7, 7-5, 4-6 by Spains David Ferrer and eighth seed Coria was outhit by Russias Nikolay Davydenko 6-2, 3-6, 6-7, 2-6. 

For a place in the semi-finals, Ferrer will, however, run into compatriot Rafael Nadal who silenced a partisan crowd with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 win over French number one Sebastien Grosjean. 

The 18-year-old, who has collected five titles this year, extended his winning streak on clay to 21 matches. Each player had won a set and Nadal was leading 3-0 in the third when rain interrupted the contest on Sunday. 

The gifted left-hander is trying to become the first man to win Roland Garros on debut since Swede Mats Wilander in 1982. 

The crowd had halted play for nine minutes early in the second set of Nadals match on Sunday, booing and jeering over a controversial line call and getting louder every time the Spaniard tried to resume playing. 

The fans behaved on Monday and witnessed more great tennis from the Spanish prodigy who won the first three games to wrap up the third set. 

The fourth set featured thrilling rallies and was tight until Grosjean dropped serve by netting a backhand in the eighth game. 

Nadal served for the match and Grosjean bowed out by hitting a backhand wide on the second match point. 

The 17-year-old Serb Ana Ivanovic proved a quick learner when she followed up her stunning victory over third seed Amelie Mauresmo with a win over Francesco Schiavone to reach the quarter-finals. 

There was no comedown after the best win of her career as she ousted the Italian 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 to leave just Nadia Petrova standing in the way of a place in the semis. 

Sharapova paid a fleeting visit to Roland Garros on day eight of the claycourt Grand Slam, needing just three games to polish off Spains Nuria Llagostera Vives 6-2, 6-3 in their rain-interrupted match held over from Sunday. 

I guess it was good just to have a good nights sleep, said the 18-year-old who is not afraid of Henin-Hardenne. I think Im getting better and better. Ive said this before, if people underestimate me on clay then theyll be surprised, she grinned. 

If the conditions are going to be heavier, a lot of the points are going to be long. I feel fit enough to be able to do that. Its just a matter of mentally going out there and doing it. 

Mens ninth seed Guillermo Canas can have no such concerns. The Argentine qualified for the quarter finals without playing when his opponent, German Nicolas Kiefer, pulled out with a sore neck. 

Kiefer, the 28th seed, was hampered by the injury in the fourth round when he took four sets to move past Russias Igor Andreev. Canas will play Mariano Puerta or Jose Acasuso in an all-Argentine quarter final. 

Jeevan loses in 3 sets

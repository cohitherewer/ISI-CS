 London: The only tree inside the boundary of a first-class cricket ground has been blown down by high winds after 158 years as a wooden fielder. The lime tree at Kent?s ground in Canterbury, south-east England, deprived generations of players of a six.

 ?It was a very, very effective fielder,? said club curator David Robertson on Tuesday. ?We feel shock and sadness really, it was one of the great traditions of Kent cricket.?

 Shots blocked by the tree were counted as a four and only three batsmen cleared the 90-foot tree to score a six ? Middlesexs Jim Smith in 1939, and West Indians Learie Constantine in 1928 and Carl Hooper in 1992.

 The club might replace the tree, blown down early on Saturday, and is considering turning its remains into souvenirs.

 Dakar: Italian motorcyclist Fabrizio Meoni died of a heart attack on Tuesday after crashing during stage 11 of the Dakar rally, a day after a Spanish biker died from his race injuries. Meoni, who was married with two children, won the rally in 2001 and 2002 and had said this race would be his last. He was second in the motorcycle standings after the 10th stage.

 Race director Etienne Lavigne said the 47-year-old, known by Italians as ?The African?, was tended by paramedics for 45 minutes at the scene of the crash, a third of the way through the 685-km stage between Atar in Mauritania and Mali?s Kiffa. However, they were unable to revive him. 

 On Monday Jose Manuel Perez, who fell during a stage in Mauritania last week, died in a Spanish hospital.

 Mumbai: The Indian winners of the full marathon for men and half marathon for women at this year?s Standard Chartered Mumbai International marathon on January 16 would win free trips to Switzerland to participate in the Lausanne marathon later this year.

 The Indian champions? trip would be sponsored by Switcher, the leading Swiss brand in leisurewear and the official apparel sponsor for the Mumbai marathon, a media release said.

 Last year, the Swiss firm sponsored free T-shirts for over 10,000 runners at the Mumbai marathon, the release added. 

 Silver Spring (Maryland): Lance Armstrong won?t decide until April whether he?ll try for a seventh consecutive victory in the Tour de France. Armstrong?s Discovery Channel pro cycling team announced its rider line-up and 2005 schedule on Monday, but noticeably absent was a firm itinerary for the team?s leader.

 Armstrong said he would ride at least one more Tour de France ? a commitment he made when his team changed sponsors from the US Postal Service ? but he would first ride in some of the spring European classic races before making up his mind when to fulfil the obligation.

 Frankfurt: VfB Stuttgart?s Swiss international striker Marco Streller has been sidelined after suffering intense pain in the left leg he broke last year. Streller, who fractured his leg at a pre-Euro 2004 training camp, scored within a couple of minutes of coming on as a substitute in a practice match against Reutlingen on Saturday but his joy was short-lived. The 23-year-old?s leg was so painful that he was forced to fly to Switzerland on Sunday to see the surgeon who performed the original operation and he will not even be able to train with his team mates during their camp in Spain this week.

 ?The leg just needs a bit more time to heal properly,? Streller told the club?s website after arriving in Marbella. ?At the moment two bones are rubbing against each other and that is why I am in pain.

 Marseille: Nigeria?s under-21 international defender Taye Taiwo has signed a three-year contract with Olympique Marseille for an undisclosed fee. In a statement on the French Ligue 1 club?s website Marseille manager Pape Diouf said the move was ?an investment for the future?.

 Left back Taiwo could be used to replace former French international Bixente Lizarazu, who returned to Bayern Munich after an unsuccessful first half of the season at Marseille.

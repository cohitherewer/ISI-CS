 ?Coulthard may be surprise package?

 David Coulthard 

London: David Coulthard and Red Bull Racing Formula One team could turn out to be the season?s surprise package, according to Frank Williams. 

The season starts in Australia on March 6 and Williams, who gave the 33-year-old Scot his Grand Prix debut in 1994, suggested the former Jaguar team could be more competitive than many suspected. 

?The Red Bull car looks very good I?m told,? he said. ?The car is quick, they?re not to be laughed at. I just think they?re going to bite a few a***s.? 

Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz runs the Red Bull energy drink empire with former racer Helmut Marko as his director of motorsport. 

They bought Jaguar from Ford last November and signed Coulthard. 

Coulthard has 13 Grand Prix wins under his belt, more than any other active driver other than Ferrari?s seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. 

?David?s not in the same league as Michael, he never was, but he can do them the world of good. He?s the right man in the right place,? said Williams. 

Coulthard himself has played down his chances however, saying that he had no illusions. 

?To expect them to win a Grand Prix is a pipe dream at this moment in time,? he said. (Reuters)

 Lara back in squad

Castries (St Lucia): West Indies have recalled leading batsman Brian Lara to revive their fortunes in the two-Test series against Pakistan starting on Thursday at Kensington Oval in Barbados. 

Lara was rested for the three one-day Internationals against Pakistan, who completed a 3-0 series sweep with a 22-run victory in the final match in St Lucia on Sunday. 

Left-arm seamer Ian Bradshaw has been included in the Test squad for the first time, following his consistent performances in the one-day series, while batsman Devon Smith and fast-medium bowlers Reon King and Corey Collymore also return. 

There has to be a renewed approach and the return of Brian Lara adds another element to the team, convenor of selectors Joey Carew said in a statement. He is rested and will doubtlessly return invigorated. 

As the senior player in the team and the leading personality in world cricket, he will also inject a deeper sense of professionalism. We look forward to a successful series. 

West Indies, who were beaten 2-0 at home by South Africa in their most recent Test series, have won just one Test in their last 18 matches ?against lowly Bangladesh.

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian international Felipe has been suspended for six months after video footage showed the Fluminense winger punching an opposing player, a Brazilian TV channel reported. Brazil?s Superior Sports Tribunal imposed the ban on Tuesday.

 The player?s lawyers said he would appeal and may be able to play for Fluminense until a second hearing, slated for March 17. 

 Fluminense directors have said they are likely to rescind the player?s one-year contract if the ban is confirmed.

 Felipe said he had been provoked in the Copa Brasil clash against Campinense last week and claimed Campinense midfielder Marcos Mendes made comments about Felipe?s pregnant wife and cast aspersions on the child?s paternity. 

 Bogota: It took a lot of work and patience to persuade Diego Maradona to undergo gastric bypass surgery to help him loose weight, but the operation offers the former World Cup hero a chance to start a new life, his doctor has said.

 ?I made him see that it was very important for his health and behavior to lose weight,? Angelica Maria Quintero said. ?The decision (to have surgery) was difficult, it required a lot of effort.?

 Maradona, who became unrecognizably obese in recent years, successfully underwent a procedure sometimes called a stomach staple on Saturday, and is expected to leave the hospital in the coming days. 

 Zurich: World soccer?s governing body Fifa is planning to create a group of anti-racism ambassadors to tackle discrimination in the game.

 Headed by France and Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, the group will consist of leading players and coaches from the past and present. ?I think it?s a really sad story that we are still having to fight against racism,? Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Tuesday after a two-day meeting of the organisation?s executive committee. ?But I believe that this is something that we will eventually deal with.?

 Blatter, wearing a black wristband in support of racial equality, said Henry had already indicated his support, adding the player was ?proud? to accept the role.

 New Delhi: Sahara India Pariwar announced a three-year tie-up with the national women?s cricket team on Wednesday, a move likely to give a boost to the side ahead of the World Cup starting in South Africa later this month.

 ?We believe that our association with the women?s cricket team will be instrumental in enhancing the popularity of the sport in India,? director, Sahara India, U. K. Bose said in a release.

 Though the company had sponsored the womens team for a one-off series in the past, its for the first time that it has come forward for a three-year association.

 The tie-up has been welcomed by both the captain and coach of the team. 

 Jaipur: Jaipur boy Amanjyot Singh will play in the 26th Asia-Pacific junior golf championship to be held at Ora country club at Jeju-do, Korea from May 31 to June 3.

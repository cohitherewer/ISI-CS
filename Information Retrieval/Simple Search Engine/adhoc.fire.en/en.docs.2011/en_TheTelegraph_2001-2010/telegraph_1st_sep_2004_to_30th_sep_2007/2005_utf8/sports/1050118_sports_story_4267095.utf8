 Dakar: The teenage goalkeeper of Benins Under-20 soccer team has died after being beaten up by unidenitified attackers a day after the West African nation lost its first match in the African Youth Championships.

 Yessoufou Samiou, 18, known to fans as Campos, died of his injuries after he was attacked on Sunday in Cotonou, where the championships are being held. 

 Lisbon: Manchester United?s Portuguese teen striker Cristiano Ronaldo has offered to bring a seven-year-old Indonesian boy, who survived alone for three weeks after the tsunami, to England to watch the Red Devils in action.

 ?When things are more calm, it will be my pleasure to invite him to spend a few days with me, either at my house or at a hotel, so that he can attend a match,? he said. Ronaldo also vowed to give the child a team jersey and said he would dedicate his next goal to the boy.

 Frankfurt: World Cup organisers are warning fans to steer clear of internet scams when the first batch of tickets for the 2006 tournament go on sale next month.

 Tickets, which start to go on sale on February 1, will be printed with the purchaser?s name and be non-transferable, organisers said.

 ?All we can do is urgently warn fans off freeloaders, the majority operating on the internet,? organising committee vice-president Horst R Schmidt said in a statement on Monday. ?Anyone who falls for these offers runs the risk of losing a lot of money and failing to gain admission to the stadiums.?

 New Delhi: India?s marathon man Ashis Roy has been invited to take part in the Lahore marathon where he is being projected as the star attraction. The 72-year-old Indian runner, who has been included in the Limca Book of Records 2004, will be running his 64th marathon, which is the highest by anyone in South Asia. The organisers in Pakistan are attracting crowds to the marathon, to be held on January 30, with the tag line, ?Come, see Indian marathon man?. ?I run for sheer love of the game. It gives me immense pleasure to run in marathons,? said Roy. ?I run full 42 km and not in patches as others do in India during the city marathons,? he said.

 Havana: Cricket has found a new base in the unlikely form of baseball-mad Cuba, according to press reports here. 

 The Tribuna de la Habana said that the sport was growing in popularity with over 500 players in Havana and others taking it up out in the provinces. 

 The paper said that young Cubans used to playing baseball in the streets had little difficulty in switching to cricket as the two sports were closely related.

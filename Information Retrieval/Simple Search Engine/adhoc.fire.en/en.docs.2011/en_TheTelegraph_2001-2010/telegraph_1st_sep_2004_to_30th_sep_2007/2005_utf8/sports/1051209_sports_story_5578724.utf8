The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Friday, December 09, 2005 

 London: Players led by England captain David Beckham make up almost a quarter of the top 100 on Britain?s soccer rich list although Chelsea?s owner Roman Abramovich sits on top of the pile.

 Real Madrid midfielder Beckham is estimated to be worth ?75 million ($130 million) and ranks only 32nd on the list, which includes owners, board members and shareholders.

 A British soccer magazine estimated that Russian billionaire Abramovich is worth ?10 billion and he is followed by Joe Lewis, who has a stake in Tottenham Hotspur and Rangers, with two billion.

 Arsenal?s Dutch forward Dennis Bergkamp trails Beckham with ?37 million and is at No. 48.

 Leipzig: Argentina coach Jose Pekerman will be the only national team coach to miss Friday?s World Cup draw, due to an injury to his hand and a family bereavement, Fifa said on Wednesday.

 Diego Maradona, the inspiration behind Argentina?s World Cup win in Mexico in 1986, will also be missing in Leipzig after failing to respond to Fifa?s invitation to participate in the draw with other former soccer greats. Coaches from the other 31 teams taking part have confirmed their attendance in Leipzig, Fifa said.

 Among the people confirmed as taking part in the draw are Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann, team captain Michael Ballack and organising committee president Franz Beckenbauer.

 Berlin: Former Bundesliga player Steffen Karl was convicted of fraud and received a nine-month suspended sentence on Thursday for his part in Germany?s recent match-fixing scandal. A Berlin court found Karl, who played in the 1993 Uefa Cup final for Borussia Dortmund, guilty of accepting money from the fraud?s Croatian ringleader to throw lower league matches.

 Karl had initially denied the charges, but abruptly changed his story on Thursday morning, his lawyer providing the court with a statement in which he admitted accepting 18,000 euros ($21,090) from Croat Ante Sapina. Sapina and his chief accomplice, referee Robert Hoyzer, each received jail terms of over two years last month for their part in the scandal.

 Montevideo: Modest provincial club Rocha won their first Uruguayan title and celebrated by leading a cow around the field during their lap of honour. 

 Rocha, who are reported to have a monthly wage bill of $15,000 and some of whose players cycle to training, are the first team from outside Montevideo to win the title since the championship started in 1932.

 Rocha opened up an unassailable four-point lead over Nacional with one match to play by beating Rampla Juniors 2-1 on Wednesday.

 Sydney: Three more Australian weightlifters considered medal contenders for next year?s Commonwealth Games have tested positive to taking a banned amphetamine, newspapers reported on Thursday.

 The papers said the two men and a woman tested positive to benzylpiperazine (BPZ) while competing at the Australian Championships in October. The names of the trio were not given.

 Rome: The Olympic flame for the 2006 Turin Winter Games set off on a two-month long journey across Italy on Thursday with torchbearers carrying it past Rome?s most famous monuments to the Vatican for the Pope?s blessing.

 Italy?s President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi lit the torch and handed it to marathon champion Stefano Baldini, the first of 10,000 torchbearers who will take it on an 11,000km trek to 140 cities.

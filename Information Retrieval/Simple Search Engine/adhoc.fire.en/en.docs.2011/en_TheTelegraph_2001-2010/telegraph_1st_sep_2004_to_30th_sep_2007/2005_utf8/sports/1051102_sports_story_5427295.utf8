 Vassell brace helps City ride past Villa

London: Manchester City climbed to fourth place in the Premier League after two goals by striker Darius Vassell helped them to a 3-1 home victory over his former club Aston Villa on Monday. 

Vassell tapped in his first after a misunderstanding between Villa defender Jlloyd Samuel and stand-in goalkeeper Stuart Taylor left him with an empty net with only four minutes gone. 

His second followed deft work by fellow striker Andy Cole, who flicked the ball over his markers head and touched the ball towards Vassell who volleyed neatly into the corner of the net in the 26th minute. 

Villas Liam Ridgewell pulled one back from close range after 65 minutes but Cole confirmed Citys win with their third goal seven minutes from time when his shot looped in off Villas Mark Delaney. 

The win lifted City above local rivals Manchester United and Arsenal and into fourth place on 20 points, the same tally as third-placed Tottenham Hotspur and fifth-placed Bolton Wanderers.

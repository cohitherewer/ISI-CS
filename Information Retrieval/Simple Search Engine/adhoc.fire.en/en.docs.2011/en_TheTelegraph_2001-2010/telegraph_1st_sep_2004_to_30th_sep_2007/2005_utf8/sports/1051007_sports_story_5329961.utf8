 Sania Mirza sails into quarters

 - JAPAN OPEN 

New Delhi: Indias Sania Mirza entered the quarter finals of the $1,70,000 Japan Open with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Japans Aiko Nakamura on Thursday. 

Sania, seeded eighth, set up a clash with top seed Russias Vera Zvonareva, who beat Shahar Peer of France 6-3, 7-5 to make it to the last eight, according to information received here. 

Continuing her fine form in the tournament, Sania thwarted the home challenge with a straight-set win after the match had to be postponed on Wednesday due to rain. 

I thought I played a good match. I had a solid start to the match in the first set. In the second set, Aiko picked up her game, but I think I played well when it mattered on the important points, she said after the match. 

Second seed Czech Nicole Vaidisova of the easily beat Japans Rika Fujiwara 6-4, 6-2 and No. 3 Tatiana Golovin thrashed another Japanese player, Saori Obata, 6-1, 6-4. 

Fourth-seeded Russian Maria Kirilenko, who won her first WTA title in Beijing last month, eased past Slovakian Henrieta Nagyova 6-4, 6-2 to reach the last eight. 

In the mens draw, top seed Mariano Puerta, the subject of doping allegations, slumped to a 6-2, 6-7, 7-5 defeat by Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. 

The Argentine world No. 10, who denied a report in a French newspaper that he tested positive for a banned substance during his run to this years French Open final, appeared distracted against the 81st-ranked Baghdatis. 

Puertas exit was another blow to organisers after Australian Open champion Marat Safin, Briton Tim Henman and Argentines Gaston Gaudio and David Nalbandian pulled out through injury. 

US Open semi-finalist Robby Ginepri cruised into the quarter finals with a solid 6-4, 6-4 victory over Luxembourgs Gilles Muller. 

The third seed will play Bjorn Phau in the last eight after the German thrashed 10th seed Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark 6-1, 6-2. 

Second seed Radek Stepanek beat fellow-Czech Jiri Vanek 7-5, 6-4 in a second round match, and Taylor Dent, seeded fourth, overpowered Russias Dmitry Tursunov 6-3, 7-6. 

Finlands Jarkko Nieminen, the seventh seed, pulverised former Australian Open runner-up Rainer Schuettler of Germany 6-1, 6-1. 

Baghdatis will next play Croatias fifth-seeded Mario Ancic who beat Frenchman Cyril Saulnier 6-2 6-1.

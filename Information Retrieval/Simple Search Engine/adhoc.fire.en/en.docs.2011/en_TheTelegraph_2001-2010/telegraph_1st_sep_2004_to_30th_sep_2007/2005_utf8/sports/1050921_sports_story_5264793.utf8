 Couldnt ask for a better student, says Sanias coach

A STAFF REPORTER

 Farrington

Calcutta: John Farrington is a man much in the news in India now, courtesy being the travelling coach of Sania Mirza. 

In the city as his ward attempts to claim the Sunfeast Open crown, Farrington interacted with the media on Tuesday. Being asked whether he was working on Sanias serve, Farrington said he was working on all aspects of her game, serves included. It is a continuous process of making changes and adjustments. 

Would he want her to temper her aggressive style? I dont want her to lose her aggression, said Farrington, Playing to win makes a big difference. 

The Bahaman said he felt Sania should go to the net more often. I think she should attack the net more. This would give her an advantage as she would go towards the net and send deep returns which would put her opponents on the defensive. 

Sania as a student? She absorbs a lot, is very attentive and receptive. I couldnt ask for a better student, concludes Farrington.

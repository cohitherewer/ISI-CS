 Federers objection 

Paris:Roger Federer has voiced his objection to the replay system that could be introduced at this years US Open. 

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) hopes to use the system which will allow chair umpires to inspect disputed line calls instantly during the course of a match on a computer screen. 

I have a very strong opinion about it. Im absolutely against it, the US Open mens champion said. 

US Open tournament director Jim Curley has been attending the French Open to glean the opinion of the players after last years quarter final match between Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati was overshadowed by several officiating mistakes. 

But Federer was adamant things should stay the way they are. I told him (Curley) about the difficulties? about how much money they will blow out by doing that because I think its going to cost too much money, he said. (Reuters)

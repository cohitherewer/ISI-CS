 Karthikeyan hoping for a better outing 

 Karthikeyan expects heat and humidity to make race tougher in Malaysia 

Kuala Lumpur: India?s first Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan wants to improve on his start for a better finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix, the second leg of the championship on march 20. 

?For starters, I hope to improve on my starting where the problem has been identified and would be rectified,? said Karthikeyan, who has flown in early here to acclimatise himself with the hot and humid weather of Malaysia. 

?I hope for a better outing here, where I expect the race to be tougher. It has been hot and humid. I expect it to be even worse at the tracks,? he said. 

After finishing 15th in the season opener in Melbourne last Sunday, the Jordan driver said he was looking forward to racing at the Sepang circuit. 

?I have not been to the tracks yet, but have been working out at the gym in the hotel I am staying in for four hours a day,? he was as quoted as saying by a local daily. 

When told that temperatures might rise to 41, the 28-year-old, who had earlier raced here in the 1996 Formula Asia championship at the Batu Tiga circuit in Shah Alam, which he won overall, said he was not expecting it to be so hot. 

?I was expecting it to be about 34 degrees but if it is going to 41 degrees it is really going to be taxing.? 

Karthikeyan admitted that it is going to be difficult for him to be among the top finishers because of his lack of experience, but that is not going to stop him from trying his best to improve on his finish in Melbourne. 

?Monteiro and I will work hard together as a team to do our best. We are both in our first season. We will push ourselves and the car hard?. 

On a lighter note, Narain?s wife Pavarna said she was his lucky charm. 

?I must be because after marrying me, he is made his F1 debut,? said the 25-year-old. ?I enjoyed myself thoroughly watching Narain race in Melbourne and am very proud of his achievement in his debut outing. ?

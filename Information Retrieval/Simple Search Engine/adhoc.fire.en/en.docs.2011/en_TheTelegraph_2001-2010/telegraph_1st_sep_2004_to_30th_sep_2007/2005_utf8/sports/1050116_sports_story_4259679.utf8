 Hondo rocks Bangladesh

 It was a bowlers? 

 day in Dhaka on Saturday. While Enam-ul Haq claimed 

 7/95, Douglas Hondo matched him with 6/45 

Dhaka: Zimbabwean pacer Douglas Hondo sliced through the Bangladesh batting with a career-best six for 45 on the second day of the second and final Test here Saturday. 

The 25-year-old gave a superb exhibition of seam bowling on a slow track to reduce Bangladesh to 169 for eight at stumps in reply to Zimbabwe?s first-innings total of 298. Lower-order batsman Mohammed Rafique top-scored for Bangladesh with an aggressive 56 with the help of one six and seven fours. 

Zimbabwe, hoping to square the series after their 226-run defeat in the opening match, were indebted to skipper Tatenda Taibu and Hondo for gaining the upper hand despite a seven-wicket haul by Bangladeshi left-arm spinner Enam-ul Haq. 

Haq, 18, finished with seven for 95 to become the youngest bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings but Zimbabwe still managed to post a respectable total, thanks to Taibu who slammed a fighting 85 not out. Hondo then troubled the Bangladeshi batsmen with his probing line and length to complete his first haul of five or more wickets in a Test innings. 

Bangladesh got off to a good start as Javed Omar (34) and Nafis Iqbal (28) put on 58 for the opening wicket, but squandered the advantage after Hondo was pressed into the attack as a first-change bowler. 

The hosts lost the first six wickets in the space of 49 runs in a dramatic collapse, with Hondo claiming all the victims. 

The morning session belonged to Haq, who also became the first Bangladeshi bowler to bag seven wickets in a Test innings. Haq, who turned 18 in early December, surpassed former Pakistan pacer Waqar Younis, who was nearing his 19th birthday when he bagged his first seven-wicket haul against New Zealand in Lahore in 1990. 

Zimbabwe were all out shortly before lunch after resuming at 244 for six, with Taibu completing his sixth Test half-century. (AFP)

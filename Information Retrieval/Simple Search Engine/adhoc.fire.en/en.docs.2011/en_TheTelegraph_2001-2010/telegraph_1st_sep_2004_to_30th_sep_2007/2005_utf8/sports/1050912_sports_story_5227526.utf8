New Delhi: Indias ace long jumper Anju Bobby George said that winning the silver medal at the World Athletics final in Monaco was the biggest achievement of her career till date. 

This has been the biggest achievement of my career as the competition here was the toughest, Anju said on arrival from Monaco late last night (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

This is the first medal I have won in a major competition after the world Athletics Championships in 2003 so it is a special feeling. 

Only the top eight athletes in the discipline qualify for this elite event so I had to complete with the worlds best. 

Anju won the silver medal in the womens long jump by leaping 6.75 metres to come second behind Russian Tatyana Kotova, who jumped 6.83 metres. 

Asked about her three fouls during the competition, Anju said that she was going all out during the event which may have caused her to make the mistakes. 

But these fouls jumps did not put any pressure on me because I knew that I was jumping well, she said. 

Talking about her less than impressive performance earlier in the year, when she failed to earn medals at various events, she said that she was facing various physical problems during that time. 

She was suffering from allergy and knee pain due to which she could not train before competition, her husband and coach Bobby George said. 

Asked about her future plans, she said she was concentrating on various prestigious events coming up next year. 

There are the Commonwealth Games, the World Cup, the World Indoor Championships and the Asian Games next year, for which I may even go abroad for training. 

Anju also expressed hope that she will be able to cross seven metres mark in the near future. 

With very little left to achieve at the Asian level where she has already established herself as the marquee athlete, Anju is now eyeing glory at the biggest stage. 

We have the World Indoor Championships in Moscow in March followed by the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne for which I would have to be at my best, she said on Sunday, a day after her arrival. 

We also have the World Cup in Athens and the World Championships in Stockholm apart from the Asian Games in Doha, so it is going to be a pretty hectic season, said Anju, fresh from her silver medal winning effort at the world athletics final in Monaco. 

Long jumper plans to start training in Bangalore after a rest of two or three weeks and then leave for Melbourne in January for acclimatisation before the Commonwealth Games. She is also scheduled to undergo a short training stint in California before the major events start rolling. 

On the contribution of American great Mike Powell to Anjus success, husband and coach Bobby shot back nobody can create a champion in the short time that he spent with us. 

Powell was with us for two months in California and 14 days in Europe and that is too little a time to transform a jumper, he said.

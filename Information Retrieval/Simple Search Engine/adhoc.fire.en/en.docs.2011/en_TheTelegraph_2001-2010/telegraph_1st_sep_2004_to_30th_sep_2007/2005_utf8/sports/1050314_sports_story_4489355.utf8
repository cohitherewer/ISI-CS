 Rathore?s focus on 3 key titles

New Delhi: Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore has set his sight on three coveted titles this year to keep his place among the world?s best in double trap shooting. 

?I have chosen to focus my strengths on key competitions this year like the Commonwealth Shooting Federation championships on right now, the world shotgun championships at Lonato, Italy in May and the World Cup shooting final in Dubai in November,? Rathore said from Melbourne. 

His shot at first of the three crowns will come Thursday when he competes in the double trap individual competition. Sunday he won India the team gold combining with Ronjan Sondhi beating the Australian team led by his coach Mark Russell. 

?I came to Australia much earlier so that I get ample time to train, get used to conditions here and be around to watch Narain (Karthikeyan) race as well. I am quite at home now and am eagerly awaiting my event on March 17,? he said. 

The ace marksman said: ?I will be shooting with my old gun with which I am very comfortable and will use the new gun later.? 

Rathore said he was putting himself through some rigorous training to hit the mark. ?I am following a very rigorous schedule to give my best and have a great team to guide me. I am doing a 12-day training sessions with my coach Mark Russell, former world champion and Olympic gold medallist, and am working to be in peak condition with my fitness trainer Chris Hynes. 

?To enhance my mental and psychological concentration for the season ahead, I am working with Peter Terry, a sports psychologist.?

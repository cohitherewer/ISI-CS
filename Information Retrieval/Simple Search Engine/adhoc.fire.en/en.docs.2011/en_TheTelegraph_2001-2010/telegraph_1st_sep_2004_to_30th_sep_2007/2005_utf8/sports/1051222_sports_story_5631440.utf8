 Frank Lampard accuses Gunners of play-acting

 - Relation remains strained between Arsenal and Chelsea 

Matt Hughes

 Lampard feels that Michael Essien was being picked on 

After Colegate and Cardgate, Arsenal and Chelsea became embroiled in another unseemly row on Tuesday night as Frank Lampard accused Arsene Wengers team of play-acting during Sundays Premiership match at Highbury. The bad blood between the clubs continues to boil. 

After Michael Essiens contribution to the battle of Dietmar Hamanns wounded knee, the latest controversy concerns the Ghana midfield players forearm. Jose Mourinho insisted after the match that Arsenal had targeted Essien and Lampard went farther, claiming that Lauren had feigned injury after being caught by Essien in an attempt to get him sent off. Sporting a fat lip suffered during the bruising encounter, Lampard reopened old wounds. 

If you look at what really happened, people were making a meal of it and I feel that Michael was treated a bit badly, he said. If you take Sunday as an example, it does look as though opponents might be starting to pick on him. I watched the tape and Michael wasnt looking in the direction of the player and didnt make any contact with his face, which was the impression Lauren gave. It was unfortunate that the players surrounding him attempted to make a bigger deal of it than it was. 

Lauren will not be happy at having his good name sullied, but Lampard is more concerned with rehabilitating Essiens reputation. 

Michael is a fantastic player and its a shame that this sort of thing happened, Lampard said. 

 People shouldnt try to cause problems. I know him as a person and he hasnt got a malicious character at all. Hes tough in the tackle, but thats all. Hes a very good lad. 

Essien has caused a stir since his ?24.4 million move from Lyons last summer, winning praise for his commanding performances in central midfield but has faced condemnation for horrific challenges on Hamann and Tal Ben Haim, the Bolton Wanderers defender. The man nicknamed The Bison is usually as quiet as a mouse, but he spoke out to defend himself for the first time on Tuesday, insisting that he is not a dirty player. 

During my career so far I have never gone out with the intention of hurting anyone in a tackle, Essien said. Nothing I have ever done has been deliberate and I am not a dirty player. I will always compete fairly, but never with malice. 

The midfield, especially in English football, is a physical and competitive place, and like others before me, such as Patrick Vieira, I need time to adapt to English football. I have paid for a mistake on Hamann with a suspension. That is sufficient punishment for someone like me, who only ever wants to play football. 

Having said that Essien should have been sent off during Sundays match, Wenger is unlikely to be convinced, and is seething about the 2-0 defeat. 

Such is the sense of injustice within the club that they contacted Keith Hackett on Tuesday to check if the offside directives had changed, but Wenger will not take much solace from the referee controllers view that Robin van Persies first-half goal should have stood. 

When you examine the video many times, you can see (Thierry) Henry is not active, Hackett, the head of the Professional Game Match Officials Board said. 

 Arsenal wanted to know if I had instructed officials to change their style of refereeing, but for the offside decision I was able to confirm this was not a correct decision by the assistant referee. 

Wenger will also not have taken kindly to receiving a lecture from Richard Caborn, the Sports Minister, who urged the Frenchman and Mourinho to grow up. 

What happens in the ground on a Saturday happens in the playground on a Monday, Caborn said. People in football are role models and have got to act accordingly and not bring the game into disrepute. 

It is a powerful game and in that sense we must take our responsibility seriously. I would say grow up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Six-yr-old Dishan set to make history

A CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: A number of records will tumble when The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship gets underway at Gorky Sadan from Wednesday. 

To begin with, as many as 35 Fide-rated players will be seen in action in this premier school chess tournament, the only Fide-rating meet in the country. 

The 18th edition is being presented by Linc with Bata being the co-sponsor. 

With the participation of British U-14 champion, Ankush Khandelwal, three countries, India, Bangladesh and England, would be represented in the tournament. 

When six-year old Dishan Barua sits across the board on Wednesday, it would be the first time a mother and son have taken part in this championship. In 1988, Saheli Dhar Barua had participated in the first edition as a 14-year old. 

With a number of top players bunched evenly at the top, the championship is wide open. 

Top seed, Kh. Sanjoy Singh of Manipur, who arrived in the city on Tuesday, said, I will give my best but the tournament is evenly poised. He was placed 10th last year. 

Second seed Debaditta Sinha Biswas of Salt Lake Point School, along with Soumya Thakurta of St James, Bitan Banerjee of Baruipur HS and Suman Basu of Madhyamgram HS are the local stars to watch out for. 

The winners purse will carry a handsome Rs 15000. 

Khandelwal of Nottingham School for Boys, who will be arriving in the city late on Wednesday, will play from the second round with a bye in the first. 

Padmini Rout of Orissa, who won the gold medal in the recently-concluded U-12 Asian Youth Championship, is the highest rated female participant.

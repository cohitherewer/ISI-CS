 FA charge on Chelsea 

London: Premier League champions Chelsea were charged by the Football Association on Thursday with misconduct for allegedly breaching rules governing independent private drug testing by the club on some players last year. 

It is alleged that Chelsea FC has breached Regulation 1(e) of The FAs Doping Control Regulations, which states that interference with a drugs test or the Doping Control Programme will be regarded as amounting to a breach of the Doping Control Regulations, the FA said on its official website. 

The tests were carried out on July 12 2004. The west London club has until September 23 to respond. 

The FA rules on doping offences state: The independent private testing/screening of players by clubs, club officials or any other person subject to FA rules is prohibited. 

Such testing/screening will be regarded as conduct that would interfere with the FAs doping control programme... 

Chelsea have taken a hard line against drugs in the past and sacked Adrian Mutu in October last year and Mark Bosnich in January 2003 after they tested positive. (Reuters)

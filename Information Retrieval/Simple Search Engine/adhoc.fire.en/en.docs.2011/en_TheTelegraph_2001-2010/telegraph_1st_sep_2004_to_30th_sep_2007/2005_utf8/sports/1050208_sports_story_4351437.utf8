Mumbai: A powerful century from Yuvraj Singh 

helped India Senior recover from a disastrous start and post 280 for nine against 

India A in the opening match of the N.K.P. Salve Challenger Trophy here Monday. 

Yuvraj?s blazing knock, filled with glorious pulls and sweeps en route to a 91-ball 100, lifted India Senior from early trouble following a triple strike by Zaheer Khan. 

Electing to bat, India Senior were reduced to 52 for three by the 11th over with Zaheer picking three for 22 in his six-over spell. 

Yuvraj shared century and half-century stands for successive wickets to pull the team out of trouble. 

The Punjab lefthander, dropped off a skier when on 12 by Dheeraj Jadhav off medium pacer R P Singh, put on 116 in only 18.5 overs with Y Venugopal Rao for the fourth wicket. Rao made 55 off 81 balls with eight fours. 

After the fall of the Andhra Pradesh righthander, Yuvraj stitched a partnership of 50 for the next wicket with another lefthander Suresh Raina (26). 

Meanwhile, the match commenced half-an-hour late because of the delayed arrival of the players? and umpires? clothing from Bangalore. It reflects poorly on the functioning of the Board since the scheduling of the tournament was known well in advance. (PTI)

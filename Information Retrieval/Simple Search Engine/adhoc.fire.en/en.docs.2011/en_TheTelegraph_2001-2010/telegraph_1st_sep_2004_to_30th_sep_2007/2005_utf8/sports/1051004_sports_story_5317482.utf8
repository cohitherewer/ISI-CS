Melbourne: West Indian batting maestro Brian Lara senses that a wounded Australia are vulnerable and ripe for another beating in the Super Series ODIs here against the World XI. 

Lara said Australia, hurting after losing the Ashes to England last month, looked ready for the taking and urged his World XI teammates to put the pressure on Ricky Pontings team. 

Lara, sixth in the list of leading ODI run-getters with an aggregate of 9,354 at 41.95, forms a potent batting line-up in the World XI along with Indians Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Englishmen Andrew Flintoff, Kevin Pietersen and South African Jacques Kallis. 

Asked at Mondays official launch of the Super Series here if Australia were looking vulnerable, Lara said: Most definitely. Its just after England and I think at present they are wounded after the Ashes. We can apply the pressure from the rest of the world, because thats who we represent. 

Australian skipper Ricky Ponting quipped that the only scar he had from the Ashes series was on his right cheek after ducking into a short-pitched delivery in the first Test at Lords. But he said his team had moved on from the agony of relinquishing the Ashes. 

I think weve all had some time to sit back and think about the Ashes series, Ponting said at the press conference. 

Obviously, it was a disappointing one for us. England played very well, theres no doubt about that, but thats over and done now and forgotten about as far as I am concerned and I am sure as the rest of our players are concerned, Ponting said. 

Its another great challenge that lies ahead of us over the next couple of weeks and thats all weve been focusing on and hopefully weve learned from our mistakes that we made during the Ashes. 

If we dont learn from them then were pretty stupid. But weve done that, weve forgotten about the Ashes, weve moved on and were looking forward to this challenge. 

Ponting confirmed that Simon Katich will open the batting with Adam Gilchrist in the ODI series after the axeing of regular opener Matthew Hayden. 

World XI skipper Shaun Pollock played down talk that his team of all-stars will struggle to mould into a unit capable of downing Australia on their home turf. 

A lot of people say that our hardest challenge will be to gel as a team, as a unit, the South African allrounder said. 

We havent played together before and some of us have played in the same side, but I dont see that as much of a problem. 

As professional cricketers we all take our jobs very seriously, we are used to being in different roles and once those roles are identified I dont think well see any problems with guys having to do that. 

Englands big-hitting Kevin Pietersen said he was excited playing in a team of world cricket luminaries. 

Im just very happy to be here... If this had been suggested to me six months ago, I would have laughed. This year has been incredible, Pietersen said. 

Its the enjoyment factor, coming out here to enjoy ourselves and to pick the brains of the absolute geniuses that are around in the dressing room, so Im just thrilled to be a part of it. 

The first of three one-dayers at Docklands Stadium takes place here on Wednesday. The ODI series will be followed by a six-day Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground from October 14.

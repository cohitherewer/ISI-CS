The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Problem goes beyond Big 2 equation

 - Board needs a plan to ensure 2007 World Cup campaign isnt derailed in Chappells very second assignment 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chappell and Sourav

Calcutta: The Greg Chappell-Sourav Ganguly face-off isnt the only problem on the Boards plate. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, an even bigger worry should be that quite a few players havent adjusted to the coachs commitment to excellence mantra. 

Not that they themselves arent aiming high. Its just that the difference between John Wright and Chappells work ethic ? one isnt suggesting the New Zealander was lax ? is appreciable and quite a few want more breathing space. 

Perhaps, its not insignificant that Chappell has indicated reputations and past performances dont exactly mean much. 

Fair enough, but a distinct change in the work culture cant happen overnight. Quite like Chappell insisting he doesnt have a magic wand and that Team India will improve over time. 

His stature notwithstanding, Chappell must realise that if he wants the world to be patient, his own approach (in driving the players) should be reasonable. 

Also, he has to work within the system and not take liberties (like asking the captain to step down). 

One of the factors which went against Chappell, when he first applied in 2000, is that the Board feared his high profile could lead to a clash with the established players. 

The Board (with different officials at the helm) didnt worry on that count when Chappell applied afresh earlier this year. 

Former captain Srinivas Venkatraghavan was the only selector who featured in both panels which interviewed Chappell. 

Incidentally, the problems have arisen without Chappell having worked with our biggest star ? Sachin Tendulkar! 

The Board officials are, at the moment, more concerned about how the AGM (in the city, on Thursday-Friday) is going to unfold. Not that anything dramatic is really expected. 

However, they need a plan to ensure that the 2007 World Cup campaign, which kick-started with Chappells appointment four months ago, isnt derailed in his very second assignment. 

Its a clich?, but much is at stake. It goes beyond the Chappell-Sourav equation. 

Footnote: Contrary to reports in one of the newer TV channels, vice-captain Rahul Dravid didnt travel with Chappell to Harare on Saturday. Instead, from Bulawayo, he went with most teammates (including Sourav, who initially wasnt going) to Victoria Falls. Mohammed Kaif and Irfan Pathan also went there, while Anil Kumble actually stayed back as hed planned a photo shoot. So much for the channels conspiracy theory involving the quartet.

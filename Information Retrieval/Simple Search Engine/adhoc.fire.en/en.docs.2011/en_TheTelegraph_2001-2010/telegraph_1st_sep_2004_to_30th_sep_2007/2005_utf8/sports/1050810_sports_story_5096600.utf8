 Hyderabad: Sania Mirza?s build up for the US Open Grand Slam suffered a setback with the tennis star pulling out of this week?s $1.3 million Rogers Cup WTA event in Toronto due to an injury.

 Sania, who has shot into top-50 in WTA rankings owing to her fine performances in Cincinnati Open, Bank of West Classic in Standford and Acura Classic, is suffering from a stomach pull.

 ?She has a minor pull in the stomach and we decided that she needs to take some rest before the US Open,? Sania?s father Imran Mirza said on Tuesday.

 The Rogers Cup is from August 13 to 21 while the US Open is set to begin on August 29.

 ?There?s nothing to worry. It?s a minor ailment 

 and she will be well. What she needs is rest to increase 

 her fitness level,? Mirza said. (PTI)

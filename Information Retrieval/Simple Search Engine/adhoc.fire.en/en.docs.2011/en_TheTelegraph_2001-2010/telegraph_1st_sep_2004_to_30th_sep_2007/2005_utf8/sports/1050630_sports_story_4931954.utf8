 Alka in lead with Supriya

Sangli: Top seed Soumya Swaminathan of Maharashtra suffered a shock defeat in only 29 moves to Jharkhands Alka Das which enabled the latter to surge into the lead with Bengals Supriya Majhi in the 32nd national womens B chess tournament here Wednesday. 

At the end of the ninth round, Alka and Supriya, who defeated Andhra Pradeshs I. Ramya Krishna in 57 moves, have logged seven points each to share the lead in the tournament being organised by Nutan Buddhibal Mandal. 

Following the lead duo in third place half a point behind were Pune-based Soumya Swaminathan and H. Soumya (Tamil Nadu), who outsmarted Bengals Swati Mohota in 77 moves. 

On top board, overnight sole leader Soumya Swaminathan started with a kings pawn opening against Alka who replied with Sicilian Defence (Sveshnikov Variation). 

Soumya played a debatable 14th move and committed a blunder two moves later to lose a piece. 

She, thus, lost control of the proceedings. Alka finished her challenge 13 moves later to gain the pole position.

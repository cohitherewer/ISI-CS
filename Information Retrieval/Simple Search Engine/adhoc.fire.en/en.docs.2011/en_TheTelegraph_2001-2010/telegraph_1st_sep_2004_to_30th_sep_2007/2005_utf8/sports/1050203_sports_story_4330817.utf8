The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India set for big total again

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: India rode a brilliant unbeaten 162 by opener Cheteshwar Pujara to pile 283 for two against England on the opening day of the third and final under-19 ?Test? against England at Keenan Stadium on Wednesday. 

The right-handed Pujara, along with fellow opener Parvez Aziz, posted an opening wicket partnership of 135 runs (267 balls) after India won the toss and elected to bat. 

Seventeen-year-old Pujara, a student of standard XII, played his role to perfection to stitch his runs with an array of drives in the front and delectable cuts square of the wicket to score his career-best innings in international match. The innocuous English bowling attack failed to make any impression on a tailor-made batting track. 

Pujara and Aziz started slowly but opened up at the later stages of their innings to frustrate the visitors. The former reached his 50 off 98 balls and the coveted century in 193 balls. Aziz, who seemed set for a long innings, lost his concentration when he fell to Joseph Denly for 58 (10x4). 

No. 3, Azar Bilakia did not stay long, falling leg before to new ball bowler David Griffiths for 22. At stumps, Bengal allrounder Manoj Tewari was giving company to Pujara with a well-made 26. 

India made eight changes from the squad, which played the second ?Test? in Calcutta.

 BCCI defends schedule 

New Delhi: With the proposed itinerary for Englands tour of India later this year having drawn flak from the British administrators as well as the media, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) defended the schedule on Friday while keeping the doors open for a possible review. 

The BCCI said the venues were decided as per its rotational policy and nothing more should be made out of it. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has written to us about the fixtures and we will look into it, board secretary S. K. Nair said over phone. 

The schedule has been drawn up as per our rotational policy and only the working committee can review it in case it is needed, he said, amidst reports in the British press that the BCCI had agreed to reconsider the itinerary.

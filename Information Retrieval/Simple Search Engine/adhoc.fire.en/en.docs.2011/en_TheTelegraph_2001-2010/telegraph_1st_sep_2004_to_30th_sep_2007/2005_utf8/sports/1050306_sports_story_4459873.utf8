 ?Chance of win virtually over?

 - Freak storm dents Schumacher?s hopes 

Melbourne: Michael Schumacher has virtually given up hope of winning Sunday?s Australian Grand Prix after a freak storm ruined his chances of qualifying near the front of the grid. 

The world champion finished 18th in Saturday?s first qualifying session after he was caught in a torrential downpour the moment he drove his Ferrari onto the Albert Park circuit. 

Schumacher?s time of one minute 57.931 seconds was almost 25 seconds behind Italian Giancarlo Fisichello, who managed to set the fastest flying lap just moments before the weather turned foul. 

The only drivers to finish behind the German were Japan?s Takuma Sato and Brazilian Felipe Massa, both of whom failed to complete their laps. 

?All I can say about today is that we were unlucky. The weather has so often played in my favour that I can accept it was not the case this time,? Schumacher said. 

?I had seen the rain clouds approaching and I hoped they would stay away a bit longer but it didn?t happen and we only just had enough time to fit the normal rain tyres when extreme wets would have been a better choice.? 

 Although there is a second qualifying session on Sunday morning, Schumacher said he was too far behind to bridge the gap, regardless of the weather. 

The seven-time world champion also conceded that his chances of winning the opening race of the season were virtually over and the best he was hoping for was to finish in the points. 

?Obviously this result will impact greatly on the race. At the same time we will try and bring home some points or even something better,? he said. 

?I don?t think a podium is out of the question but it will be very difficult. Who knows what the weather will bring tomorrow..? 

Schumacher?s Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello 

was also caught in the rain, though the conditions were slightly better, and he 

finished 12th, just behind the McLaren pairing of Kimi Raikkonen and Juan Pablo

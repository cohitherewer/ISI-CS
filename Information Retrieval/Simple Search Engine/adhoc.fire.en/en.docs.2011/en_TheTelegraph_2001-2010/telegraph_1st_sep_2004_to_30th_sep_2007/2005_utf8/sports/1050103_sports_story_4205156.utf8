 King: No problems working with Lara

Melbourne: New West Indies cricket coach Bennett King says there are no problems in his working relationship with team captain Brian Lara. 

The West Indies arrived here Sunday to prepare for their triangular one-day series with Australia and Pakistan throughout January-February. 

King, the former head coach of the Cricket Australia Centre of Excellence, said he would have to do things differently with Lara, the side?s batting superstar, because of his standing in the game. 

King admitted 35-year-old Lara would follow his own training regime because of his age and experience, but said any talk that the left-hander was difficult to manage was way off the mark. 

?At the moment I don?t know where it (talk) comes from and I was conscious of going in with an open book and having heard all the rumours and all the innuendo and making my own opinion,? King told a media conference shortly after the 14-man squad?s arrival here. 

?But from my point of view, he smiles at me every day and I smile at him every day, so it goes all right.? 

King said there was no problem unifying a side containing players from all over the Caribbean. But he added he would take a different approach to coaching Lara ? a veteran of 112 Tests and 244 one-day Internationals ? because of his age, experience and place in the team. 

?We?ve got to be mindful of his longevity in the game and how we manage him so we get the best out of Brian for as long as he wants to play,? King said. (AFP)

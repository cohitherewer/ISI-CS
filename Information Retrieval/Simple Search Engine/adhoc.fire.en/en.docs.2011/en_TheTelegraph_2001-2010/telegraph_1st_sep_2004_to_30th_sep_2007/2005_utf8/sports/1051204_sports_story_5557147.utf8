The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Club likely to name new coach today

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Subash Bhowmicks arrest by the CBI officials on Friday, have left East Bengal with no other choice but to look for an alternative. Although the club officials are yet to announce anything concrete to this effect, but it has been learnt that a few former internationals have already been sounded out as Bhowmicks successor in the hot seat. 

The search for a new coach has also been accentuated by the fact that the team is leaving for the Durand Cup later this week and playing in the competition without a coach is not the idea the officials are too keen to explore. 

The officials are going to meet in an emergency working committee meeting on Sunday, where the club is expected to announce a new man in the hot seat. 

We will discuss the coachs matter in our Sundays meeting. Then we can only decide on the issue, said the clubs general secretary Kalyan Majumdar. However, Majumdar declined to disclose any of the probables for the post of the coach. 

The name of Manoranjan Bhattacharya is doing the round. Biswajit Bhattacharya, who relinquished the Mohammedan Sportings post soon after guiding his team to a 3-2 win over East Bengal in the ongoing IFA Shield, and T. Chattuni, who helped Mohun Bagan claim the NFL in 1999, are also learnt to be on the clubs list of choices. 

Former Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya isnt figuring too strongly since most officials are against appointing him. 

When asked whether, East Bengal would stand by the tainted coach ?? as the club did during the troubled times of Dipankar Roy and Sasthi Duley ? Majumdar said: Our coach (Bhowmick) is not a handicap. So there is no question of supporting him. He is a mature and an influential man. Dipankar and Sasthi in a written application asked us for help, so we stood by them.

Karachi: Pakistan, inspired by a second successive century from Kamran Akmal, crushed England by 165 runs in the third one-day International in Karachi on Thursday. 

England, chasing a massive victory target of 354, were bowled out for 188 in 42 overs on the way to a record-equalling defeat which left them 2-1 down in the series. They also lost to West Indies by 165 runs in 1992-93. 

Pakistans victory charge was started by wicketkeeper Akmal who followed up his 102 in the second match at Lahore with a sparkling 109. 

The openers third ODI century came from 111 balls and including 12 fours, powered Pakistan to a mammoth 353 for six before a sellout crowd despite stringent security measures. 

England are the first non-Asian team to play at the venue for five years due to security concerns. 

England never recovered after Shoaib Akhtar ran out Matt Prior for two and in the next over seamer Rana Naved had Marcus Trescothick and Vikram Solanki caught in the slips for 32 and a duck. 

Mohammad Sami reduced England to 79 for four by trapping Andrew Strauss lbw. 

Andrew Flintoff struck three fours in one over from supersub Yasir Arafat and seven in his 36 from 41 balls but following his departure, bowled by Arafat, England crumbled quickly as spinners Shoaib Malik and Shahid Afridi shared five wickets. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq praised his teams professional performance. 

I am very happy for Akmal, he got the opportunity to open and he grabbed it with both hands, Inzamam said. 

Meanwhile, England captain Marcus Trescothick said that his team had been outclassed. We are disappointed at losing this way especially after the way we played in the first game, he said. They gave us a bit of a hiding. 

Trescothick made an honest assessment. 

We have not improved as much in one-day style cricket as we have done in Tests. We need to address this because we are not far off from major tournaments, he told reporters after England went 2-1 down in the five-match series. 

Trescothick said he was not sure why England were not performing consistently in limited-overs cricket. 

I dont know why it is like this. Perhaps it is our mental side of the game or about our reading off situations. But we have to make sure we have to get over it, he said. 

The next World Cup is in the West Indies in early 2007, shortly after Englands Ashes tour of Australia.

 Setback for Marion

San Francisco: A federal judge ruled against sprinter Marion Jones on Tuesday and said her libel lawsuit against the head of the BALCO lab would have to wait until the end of his steroid distribution trial. 

Jones filed a $25 million lawsuit in December, saying Victor Conte, who has been indicted on criminal charges of distributing steroids to top international athletes, falsely accused her of doping. 

Conte, whose BALCO firm is at the centre of a global sports steroid scandal, made the accusations in a TV interview and an article he wrote in which he admitted to distributing steroids. 

With the BALCO trial not scheduled until September 6, Conte asked Judge Susan Illston to delay a hearing scheduled for Friday into the Jones libel suit. The court agreed to put off the hearing for up to six months. 

Jones? lawyers argued a delay in her case would hurt her cause. ?The harm she alleges relates to endorsement and sponsorship opportunities, as well as eligibility at certain track and field events,? Illston wrote.

 Federer confident

Shanghai: Roger Federer, who has won the last two Masters Cups, is confident he has recovered fully from the ankle injury he sustained in mid-October. 

I am a very positive person and I knew that if something went wrong (in the recovery process) I would miss Shanghai, said the world No.1 at Saturdays opening ceremony for this years Masters Cup. 

I had to make sure I was very careful with my ankle. But now I see no risk whatsoever, added Swiss Federer, who begins his campaign against eighth-seeded Argentine David Nalbandian on Sunday.

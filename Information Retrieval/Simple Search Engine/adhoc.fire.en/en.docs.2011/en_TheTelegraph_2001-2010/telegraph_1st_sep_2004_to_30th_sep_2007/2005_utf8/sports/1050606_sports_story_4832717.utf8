Kuala Lumpur: Olympic and three-time champions Australia came from behind to beat South Korea 4-3 on a golden goal and lift the Azlan Shah Cup here Sunday. 

The fast paced and exciting encounter had all the ingredients of a pot boiler and was indeed an extension of the 3-3 draw the two sides played in the preliminary round earlier. 

With both the teams locked at the same score after the final hooter, it was Craig Victory who found the net for the defending champions 11 minutes into extra time to seal the fate of the tie. 

Pakistan took the third position after beating New Zealand 4-2 in the play-off. 

Michael McCann scored a brace and Luke Doerner found the net once for the champions while Nam Yong Lee, Jong Ho Seo and Jong Hyun Jang found the target for Korea. 

The nippy and nimble footed Koreans exhibited an entertaining and exhilarating display as they ran circles in their rivals defence to lead 2-1 at the break. 

They outsmarted their opponents with their speed and skill, settling down with impeccable trappings and ball control. Their short passes and ball rotation perplexed Australia initially. 

Australia, however, drew first blood when forward Michael Mccann found the mark beating Korean custodian Dong Sik Ko in the 9th minute. 

Not to be deflated, the Koreans came back in waves with their strikers and wingers using the open space left by the Aussies. 

Byung Hoon Kim, Kyung Seok Kim and Hyo Sik You were well set up by skipper and central midfielder Hyung Bae Han as Korea found their way into the circle only to be foiled either by goalkeeper Stephen Mowlam or defenders Aaron Hopkins and Robert Hammond. 

The equaliser for Korea came in the 29th minute when Nam Yong Lee struck a rebound after Jong Hyun Jangs dragflick was padded by Mowlam. 

The very next minute the Busan Asian Games champions took the lead when Jong Ho Seo encashed on an Aussie defensive lapse, beating Mowlam low on his left. 

They went further ahead three minutes after change over as Jong Hyun Jang dragflicked home to the delight of the Korean supporters. 

Though rattled, the Australians redefined their strategy to bounce back into the match netting two goals in the 55th and 62nd minutes to level the score at 3-3. 

Earlier, India prevailed over hosts Malaysia 2-1 with a 76th minute golden goal to finish fifth. The matchwinner was scored by Prabhjot Singh after the two teams were locked 1-1 at the break and full time. 

Malaysia took the lead in the third minute when striker Hairul Nizam Ab Rani, set up by skipper Kuhan, beat Indian goalkeeper Devesh Chauhan. 

India controlled the opening sessions play as their forwards propelled onslaughts from both flanks. Rajpal Singh and Prabhjot had the nip and stickwork. 

The scores could have been level in the 10th minute but Prabhjot inside the circle missed an excellent Ignace Tirkey cross. Shortly after, Arjun Halappa pushed wide a Deepak Thakur pass. 

India, however, got the equaliser from their first penalty corner in the 20th minute when Aiyappas forceful dragflick made it 1-1. (PTI)

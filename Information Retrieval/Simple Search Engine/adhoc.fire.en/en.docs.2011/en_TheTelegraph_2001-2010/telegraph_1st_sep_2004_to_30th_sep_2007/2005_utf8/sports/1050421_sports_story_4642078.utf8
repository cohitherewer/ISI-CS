 ?Sachin wicket most satisfying?

 Rana feels Sachin is a master technician 

Karachi: He dismissed the explosive opener Virender Sehwag four times in the just-concluded one-day series against India, but it was the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar that gave Pakistani seamer Rana Naved-ul Hasan the maximum satisfaction. 

Naved, who was Pakistan?s strike bowler on the tour after Shoaib Akhtar failed to make the side due to injury, said the dismissal of Tendulkar in the first one-dayer was the ?high point? of his short career. 

?Although I dismissed Sehwag four times, I immensely enjoyed my first wicket of the series,? he said referring to Tendulkar?s dismissal in the second over of the match for four. 

?To get rid of Tendulkar cheaply in that first encounter in Kochi was the high point for me. I always felt that Sehwag would give us a chance because he?s on the attack from the word go. But Sachin is a master technician in comparison,? he said. 

Naved won the Man-of-the-Series award after Pakistan clinched the series 4-2, but the 27-year-old cricketer from Sheikhupura said he never thought of playing the role of the main strike bowler. 

?I really never dreamt about playing the role of the main strike bowler. But I always had one thing in mind and that was to give my best whatever the conditions,? he was quoted as saying by a local daily Wednesday. (PTI)

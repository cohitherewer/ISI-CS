The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A league of wise gentlemen 

Guest Column 

Gary Lineker

 When Bill Shankly famously remarked 

 that the championship is not a sprint but a marathon, he 

 was obviously not referring to The Championship, which had 

 not been invented in his day. But that verdict is apt, nonetheless 

 since the race to get into the Premiership is as long and 

 gruelling as the Grand National, with even steeper fences 

 to negotiate.

 The most optimistic sides as the 

 season kicks off will be the three relegated from last seasons 

 Premiership: Crystal Palace, Southampton and Norwich. But, 

 not to put to fine a point on it, you are basically stuffed 

 when you go down unless you are in a strong position financially 

 that will allow you to invest properly and to hang on to 

 your best players. They, of course, are the only ones other 

 clubs are interested in and most relegated sides lose four 

 or five players by the time the season kicks off. 

 That has already happened to Southampton 

 and Crystal Palace who, having lost Wayne Routledge, will 

 be desperate to hang on to Andy Johnson. He is absolute 

 crucial to them this season because he is a striker who 

 proved he could score 20 goals in the Premiership and if 

 Palace can keep him fit and motivated, you can see them 

 being in the hunt. Manager Iain Dowie has sensibly asked 

 Johnson to give the club until the January transfer window 

 because if they are not well placed by then, they might 

 want to cash in on him. 

 Andy Johnson is crucial 

 to Crystal Palaces fate in the Premier League

 The Championship is a tough league 

 to get out of but really there is not a lot of quality, 

 so that it only takes that little edge, which a player like 

 Johnson gives you, to rise above the norm and to rise quite 

 comfortably above it. Without that quality, most clubs rely 

 on togetherness and spirit, organisation and a lot of commitment. 

 A good start builds momentum and 

 confidence and, for some reason, the sides that manage to 

 run up seven or eight wins from their first ten games tend 

 to be still in the promotion dogfight at the end. 

 Wigan and Ipswich stayed in the 

 top two or three all last season and I felt desperately 

 sorry for Ipswich when they again failed in the play-offs, 

 consigned there by a great run by Sunderland, who had only 

 a modest start. 

 Every team that finishes third 

 complains about the play-offs, but everybody knows the rules 

 at the start of the season and they are big, money-spinning 

 games that raise the leagues profile. There is also 

 no reason to believe that Ipswich will not be fighting for 

 promotion again this time. If I had to take two against 

 the rest, it would be Ipswich and Wolves. Both have experienced 

 managers in Joe Royle and Glenn Hoddle respectively. 

 Just as Palace would be hampered, 

 almost castrated, by the loss of Johnson, Southampton face 

 a tall order (pun intentional) to get back up after being 

 forced to sell Peter Crouch to Liverpool.

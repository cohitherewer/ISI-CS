The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Keane fiasco makes stage debut

Dublin: It humiliated a nation and turned besotted fans against Ireland?s fiercest and most revered soccer player. Now, thanks to a stage musical, the Irish are finally coming to terms with a fiasco that led to their 2002 World Cup failure. 

Dreams of World Cup success in the Far East sank before a ball had been kicked three years ago when Manchester United gladiator Roy Keane left the squad after a well-publicised spat with coach Mick McCarthy on the eve of the tournament. 

Reviving those memories as Ireland edges towards another World Cup is a risky business, but the men behind the absurd I, Keano ? which retells the debacle as a Roman farce ? believe it is time to exorcise the demons. 

?It was a huge thing in Ireland and I think to do something as ridiculous as this points out it really was just sport. No one died... yet!? co-writer Arthur Mathews said. 

?Looking back, it is quite weird that people took it so seriously. I mean, even I took it seriously,? the co-author of television comedy Father Ted said. 

Ireland?s relationship with Keane has veered from love to hate and back again but Dublin audiences have warmed to his stern character (Keano) in a play which depicts the Irish as Roman warriors preparing for battle under General Macartacus. 

On Valentine?s night, couples gave up candlelit dinners to squeeze into the city?s Olympia theatre and cheer the hero some had initially blamed for destroying Ireland?s World Cup chances. 

In I, Keano, Macartacus is a stubborn general unable to control his players? love of the ?Beerus Tentus? where journalists seduce the squad. 

The general is finally killed with a knife in the back from his superiors when they return home after a heartbreaking second round penalty defeat to Iberia (Spain).

 Atwal in quest for a million 

San Antonio: Arjun Atwal returns to the course this week at the $3.5 million Valero Texas Open at the Le Cantera Golf Club with the aim of crossing the coveted million dollar mark in annual earnings. 

The Indian needs just under $45,000 to cross the milestone that can be achieved if he finishes around 20th. 

He has $955,666 on the tour currently and has missed just one cut this entire season in 16 starts. He is lying 67th on the current money list. 

Atwal, who missed last weeks 84 Lumber Classic, will be paired with Duffy Waldorf and Jeff Hart in the first two rounds on three par-70 course. 

Daniel Chopra will be playing with Japans Hidemichi Tan Aka and Tom Gillis in the tournament that clashes with the Presidents Cup. 

Bart Bryant is the defending champion, where Chopra tied for 37th and Atwal tied for 49th last year. 

Chopra, struggling this year, has made $616,953 from 29 starts of which he has missed the cut in 14. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Nabi, Sashthi at centre of drama 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Syed Rahim Nabi and Sashthi Duley were at the centre of a drama at the East Bengal ground on Saturday morning. 

The two skipped practice without informing Subhas Bhowmick, and word was out that they were planning to bunk Sunday?s match to don office colours. 

The all-India inter-state electricity board meet is beginning on Monday in Siliguri and Midnapore, and the two were asked by their employers (CESC and WBSEB) to travel with the team. 

The coach was furious. ?I haven?t been told anything officially, but if they (Nabi and Duley) are actually absent tomorrow, I will ask the club management to fine them at least Rs 20,000 each. They won?t play another match till I am the coach,? Bhowmick announced. 

Worried club officials wasted little time and contacted both players and their bosses. 

By late afternoon, the crisis was resolved with the understanding that the duo would be ?released? by the club after the match so that they can board an evening train.

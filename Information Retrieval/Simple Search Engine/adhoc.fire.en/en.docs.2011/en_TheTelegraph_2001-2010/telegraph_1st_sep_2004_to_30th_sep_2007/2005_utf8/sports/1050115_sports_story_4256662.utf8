The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dates announced

New Delhi: Pakistan will open their first full tour of India for six years with a Test starting on March 4, according to the match schedule released on Friday. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India announced dates for the series comprising three Tests and five one-dayers but said the venues would be decided next week. 

Pakistan have not played a Test series in India since 1999 because of political tension between the two neighbours but India embarked on their first Test tour of Pakistan for over 14 years last March and April as relations improved. 

The tourists will arrive in India on February 25.

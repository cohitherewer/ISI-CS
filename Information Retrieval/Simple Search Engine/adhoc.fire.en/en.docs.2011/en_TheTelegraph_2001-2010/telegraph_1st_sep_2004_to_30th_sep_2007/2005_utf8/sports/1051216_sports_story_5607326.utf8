 Montgomery calls it a day

Salvo (North Carolina): Former world 100m record holder Tim Montgomery has announced his retirement from athletics, one day after receiving a two-year doping ban from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 

Im done. I have retired, Montgomery said over telephone from his residence in Hampton, Virginia on Wednesday. 

Montgomery and fellow American sprinter Chryste Gaines were each banned for two years after CAS accepted evidence the pair had taken the designer steroid THG (tetrahydrogestrinone), the product at centre of the BALCO doping scandal. 

The 30-year-old Montgomery, however, vehemently denies ever knowingly taking a banned substance. 

The Lausanne-based CAS said it had accepted evidence that both athletes told double world sprint champion Kelli White they had been taking THG. Montgomery denied telling White in 2001 that he had used the steroid. 

Montgomery set the world record of 9.79 seconds in September 2002. Jamaican Asafa Powell has since set a faster mark of 9.77 in June this year. As part of his ban, Montgomerys time was removed from the record books and the IAAF has asked him to return all the prize and appearance money he had received since then. 

Montgomery, however, insists he will not return the prize money being demanded by the IAAF. (Reuters)

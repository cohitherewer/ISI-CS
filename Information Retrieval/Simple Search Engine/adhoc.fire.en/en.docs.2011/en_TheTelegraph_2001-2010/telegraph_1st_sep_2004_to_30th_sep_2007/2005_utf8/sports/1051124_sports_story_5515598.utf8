Calcutta: After the seniors failed to impress in the just concluded Santosh Trophy, the Bengal junior (under-21) side achieved a glorious feat, overcoming the challenge of the much fancied AC Milan under-18 side 2-1 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. 

Rajiv Ahmed and Lalkamal Bhowmick scored for the winners in the 44 th and 53 rd minutes, respectively, while Orlando Emanuelle reduced the margin after converting a penalty. 

Former Brazilian footballer Leonardo, who started the proceedings, showed flashes of brilliance during his 39-minute stay in the park. It was he who was instrumental when Milan got their first chance of the day. Leonardo essayed a ball to Orlando Emanuelle inside the box, whose left-footed side volley hit the upright. 

But the European club side conceded the first goal in the 44th minute, quite against the run of play. Ratan Das, advancing from the right, cut inside, unleashing a square pass to Ayan Chowdhury. Ayan failed to intercept, but teammate and Mohun Bagan player Rajiv Ahmed volleyed it home past the diving goalie Offredi Daniel. 

Bengal bolstered the lead 10 minutes into the second session when midfielder Lalkamal Bhowmicks swerving free-kick went inside, keeping the Milan custodian guessing. 

However the Milan juniors pulled one back in the 64th minute, converting a spot kick. Advancing Daros Enrico was tripped from behind by Subhasish Roy Chowdhury ? surely a red-card offence ? and the visitors were awarded the penalty. Orlando placed the ball nicely to the right of the goalie to reduce the margin. 

Bengal goalie and Orlando appeared to be the two best players of the 90-minute affair, though Leonardos vote went Ayans way.

Melbourne: Women?s world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport has renewed calls for the Australian Open to be moved to a later date in the calendar to protect the world?s top players. 

Davenport, who reached the last eight at Melbourne Park for the eighth time on Sunday with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Croatian Karolina Sprem, said the January start date left players short of form going into the season-opening Grand Slam event. 

?For me it?s a shame that this Grand Slam is so early in the year,? the 28-year-old said. 

?I don?t think it allows the best tennis to come out of some of the players.? 

The Australian Open has considered moving to March, but the governing bodies concerned have all been unable to agree on an acceptable date. 

?I think ideally (it should be) February, March, late February,? Davenport said. 

?Obviously there are other factors to consider such as the Australian summer and fans and all of that.? 

?We?re used to it. It hasn?t been any different my whole career. But I just think that the players aren?t going to be as sharp as maybe they are in the latter three slams.? 

Campaigners against a move to March have suggested that crowds at Melbourne Park would be reduced by moving the tournament away from its traditional summer holiday date. 

With the AFL season hitting full steam and the Australian Grand Prix also scheduled for March, organisers are also worried the status of the tournament could be reduced. 

Until the event moved from the grasscourts at Kooyong to the hardcourts at Melbourne Park in 1988, it was considered the least prestigious of the four Grand Slam tournaments, with many of the world?s top players choosing to stay away. 

The Women?s Tennis Association last year announced a slight change to the calendar, giving players an extra two weeks off at the end of each year, but Davenport said that will not change the problem.

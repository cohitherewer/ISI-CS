 Steven Gerrard set to walk out 

Henry Winter

 Gerrard may move to Real Madrid or Chelsea 

Steven Gerrards patience with Liverpool finally snapped Sunday over their sluggishness in offering him a contract improvement, and the inspirational captain who cradled the European Cup in his arms 40 days ago now appears destined for Chelsea or Real Madrid. Training-ground spats, negotiating-room stand-offs and civil war now engulf Anfield. 

The Kop will be in uproar at the suggestion that the dithering of chief executive Rick Parry and perceived ambivalence of manager Rafa Benitez has sent their mightiest warrior hurtling out of Anfield into the eager embrace of Champions League rivals. Big clubs cannot lose such big players. 

Gerrard, who had a serious disagreement with Benitez at training on Saturday afternoon, is a proud individual who does not like being messed around and he is known to be angry over the stance of Parry and Benitez. Having struggled to get Parry to agree a date for contract discussions, Gerrard decided Sunday he had had enough, that even if Liverpool came to him saying they would meet immediately to sort out a new deal he would tell them: No chance. 

It will take a huge concerted effort on Liverpools part, assuming the desire exists, to make Gerrard stay. He has withdrawn from all dialogue with Parry. Gerrards camp insists these are not scare tactics, that their intentions are real: the England international has one foot outside Anfield. 

Jose Mourinho, the Chelsea coach who nearly signed Gerrard last summer, will be delighted by the weekends developments. A central midfield featuring the England pairing of Gerrard and Frank Lampard, anchored by Claude Makelele, could help to bring the champions joy in Europe. 

Liverpool, who harbour dreams of reclaiming the English title, would be loathe to sell to Premiership opponents and Gerrard initially indicated he would find it difficult to play against his home-town club in the league. 

Yet the Merseysider is now so aggrieved at Anfields handling of his contract situation that he is minded to decide where he is heading, and staying within England would appeal more to someone of Gerrards character. 

Chelsea have the money, the ambition and the known interest. So do Real Madrid. 

The kings of the Castellana are invariably linked with the hottest footballing properties and Gerrards falling-out with Liverpool will be closely monitored by the Bernabeu hierarchy. 

More trophy-winning gladiator than shirt-selling galactico, Gerrard is just the type of leader and motivator that Reals midfield craves. Upstaged in style and substance by Barcelona, Madrid are desperate to reimpose themselves on Spain and Europe and they know that Gerrard could be the catalyst.

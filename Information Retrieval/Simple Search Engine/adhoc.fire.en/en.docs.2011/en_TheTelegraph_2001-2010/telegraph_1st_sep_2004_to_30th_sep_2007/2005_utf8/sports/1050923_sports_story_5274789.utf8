Colombo: Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh by an innings 69 runs to complete a 2-0 series win on the third day of the second Test on Thursday. 

Sri Lanka won the first Test by an innings and 96 runs and Bangladesh have now lost their last four Test matches before lunch on the third morning. 

Bangladesh resumed on 131 for four ? still trailing by 135 runs ? and were bowled out for 197 in 60.4 overs. 

Left-arm swing bowler Chaminda Vaas made the early breakthroughs in a skilful opening burst, swinging the ball both ways to finish with three for 36 from 13 overs. 

Mohammad Ashraful (26) edged an outswinger low to Thilan Samaraweera at first slip and nightwatchman Shahadat Hossain was bowled after offering no stroke to an inswinger. The Sri Lankan spinners wrapped up victory with left-armer Rangana Herath claiming three for 52 and off spinner Muttiah Muralidharan finishing with two for 28. 

The only partnership of substance was between Aftab Ahmed and Khaled Mashud.

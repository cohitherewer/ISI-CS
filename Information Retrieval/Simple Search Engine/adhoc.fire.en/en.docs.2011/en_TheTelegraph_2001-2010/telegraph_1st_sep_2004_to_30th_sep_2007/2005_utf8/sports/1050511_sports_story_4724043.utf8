Hamburg: Andre Agassi was knocked out in the first round of the Hamburg Masters on Tuesday. The American went down 2-6, 6-7 by unseeded Spaniard Feliciano Lopez on Tuesday. 

Argentine ninth seed David Nalbandian was also eliminated in the first round, losing 7-6 7-5 to promising Swede Robin Soderling but his compatriots Gaston Gaudio and the indefatigable Guillermo Coria both won easily. 

Lopez, ranked 26 in the world, outplayed 35-year-old eighth seed Agassi for most of their match in cold conditions on the slow clay of the Rothenbaum centre court. 

Agassi looked sluggish in the first set and tossed away a 4-2 lead in the second before Lopez sealed victory on his fourth match point, taking the tiebreak 7-5 with a forehand volley. 

?They were tough, tough conditions out there,? a dejected Agassi said. ?Its too hard for me to move in those conditions. I wasnt penetrating and I wasnt reacting very well. It was a difficult day.? 

The former world No.1 has been in good form this season but his defeat meant he joined US compatriot Andy Roddick as one of several early seeded casualties at the pre-French Open event. 

Second seed Roddick lost in three sets to Chiles Nicolas Massu on Monday and he too said the cold conditions had been a big factor. French Open champion Gaudio, seeded four, brushed aside Spains David Sanchez 6-2, 6-2, making light of the unpredictable weather on court one in an impressive display less than two weeks before the claycourt grand slam in Paris. 

Coria, the 10th seed, thrashed American Vince Spadea 6-0, 6-2, showing no sign of tiredness after his five-hour defeat by Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal in the Rome Masters final on Sunday. 

Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty beat Tommy Haas 6-4, 7-5. 

Czech Tomas Berdych, 19, beat Spains David Ferrer 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 to set up a second-round rematch with top seed and world No.1 Roger Federer, whom he beat in a major surprise at last years Athens Olympics. 

Federer is in the same quarter of the draw as French Open runner-up Coria, who lost to the Swiss in last years Hamburg final. 

The tournament suffered a setback on Day 1 when Rome Masters champion Rafael Nadal pulled out with a blistered left hand suffered last week. It ended the 18-year-olds 17-match winning streak which had given him three successive titles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am not going back

London: Graham Thorpe insists there will be no going back, under any circumstances from his decision to retire from Tests. 

Although Pietersen top-scored with 57 in Englands meagre first innings total of 155, many fans were left lamenting Thorpes absence and hoping he would change his mind. 

But Thorpe wrote in a British newspaper on Saturday that: At the start of the season I had set my sights on being out there. Having the injections to get my back right a couple of weeks ago demonstrated my commitment and desire to keep giving England the option to pick me if they wanted. 

But I respect the decision the selectors have made to go in another direction. To make the situation crystal clear, my decision is irrevocable. There is no going back, under any circumstances. 

He added that Englands chairman of selectors, David Graveney, had helped him make his decision. 

In the end, it was as much what Graveney didnt say as what he did that settled it for me, Thorpe said. 

He didnt say, youre next in line, so please continue to make yourself available. 

And he didnt say, its all over, but, as a player, you get vibes about what the selectors are thinking. 

To be honest, I myself thought that going back after omitting me would be a backward step. Far better to remove the uncertainty, Thorpe explained. 

Meanwhile, England chairman of selectors David Graveney denied that Thorpe retired early because he had been told he was no longer wanted. 

When I told him that he wasnt in the team (for the first Test), which was one of the most difficult phone calls I have had to make, I suggested that, if at all possible, we would keep the door open for him until the end of the summer, Graveney said.

 HC notice to IHF top brass

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the minister of sports and youth affairs, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), its president K.P.S. Gill and secretary K. Jyothikumaran, on a petition filed by IHF?s senior vice-president Narendra Batra, seeking the quashing of the election of Gill and Jothikumaran. 

Justice Gita Mittal asked the respondents to file their reply to Batra?s petition, alleging financial irregularities and failure of the two officials (Gill and Jyothikumaran) to comply with the sports ministry?s directive not to remain in office for more than two terms or a maximum of eight years. 

The court asked all the parties to file a three-page written synopsis by May 16, the next date of hearing. (PTI)

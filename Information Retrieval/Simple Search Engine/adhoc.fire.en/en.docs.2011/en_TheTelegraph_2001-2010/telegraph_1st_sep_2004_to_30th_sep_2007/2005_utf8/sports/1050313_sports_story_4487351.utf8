 Indian colts come up vs Pak in final

Karachi: India set themselves an opportunity to avenge their defeat in the league match when they routed South Africa 3-0 to storm into Sunday?s final against Pakistan in the four-nation junior hockey tournament here Saturday. 

All three Indian goals came in the first half through Vikram Kanth (6), Birendar Lakra (25) and Ajitesh Roy (32). 

In the tournament-opener, India had suffered a 0-3 defeat to Pakistan, who in the first semi-final scored a thumping 7-0 victory over Japan. 

Tariq Aziz (45 and 65), Imran Warsi (17), Yasir Islam (24), Khalid Mahmood (26), Arif Mohammad (57) and Akhtar Mohammad (67) scored for the winners who enjoyed a commanding 3-0 lead at lemon break. 

However, Pakistan?s penalty corner conversion left much to be desired. The green shirts could convert only one of the five short corners. Japan were poorer with their short corner drills when they wasted all the six opportunities. 

India also should have won by a more comprehensive margin but their forwards relied mostly on personal heroics and individual gamesmanship while in goal-scoring positions. 

India were no less than pathetic with their penalty corner conversions as they missed all the nine goals scoring opportunities. 

Indian coach Harender Singh, however, defended his team?s inability to convert penalty corners saying the services of Sandeep Singh were being badly missed. 

?We are badly missing Sandeep, but frankly speaking when we arrived here, we relied only eight per cent on penalty corners while 92 per cent on field goals,? the Indian coach said. 

Asked to comment on Sunday?s final he said: ?I think there will be more pressure on Pakistan because they are the home team and therefore, have the favourites? tag against their names. Besides, I think they have a weak defence that moves slowly. Now its upto us how we can capitalise on this weakness.? 

South Africa will meet Japan for the third place match that will be followed by the final.

 Glad we both finished: Narain

Barcelona: Narain Karthikeyan had a tough day in office as he fought a punishing track and his own teammate Tiago Monteiro, finishing 13th last at the Spanish GP here on Sunday. 

The Jordan Toyota ej15 car continued to remain off pace through the weekend as Karthikeyan had to push hard and swallow hard when overtaken by Monteiro at the Circuit De Catalunya. 

Monteiro too had problems as he had an engine failure after qualifying but did very well to overcome the setback of starting last on the starting grid. 

?I made a reasonable start and the first few laps were OK. I was pushing hard as Tiago was catching,? Karthikeyan said. 

?Then I made a mistake in running a bit too wide in a chicane, went in the dirt and Tiago overtook me. I am glad we both finished the race and that the team has been able to gather some useful data.? 

Finlands Kimi Raikkonen drove a perfect race from start to finish to clinch the first win for himself and McLaren Mercedes this season. 

Raikkonens victory broke the winning spree of local hero Fernando Alonso and team Renault who had clinched all the four GPs this season. 

Karthikeyan had a clean lap and qualified 13th. As for the race, both drivers were satisfied to finish Sundays 66-lap GP in 12th and 13th positions, giving them more valuable race experience and mileage. 

?Today was my best GP so far this season,? Monteiro said. 

Karthikeyans car seemed to be lacking speed owing to a possible unexpected small problem with the engine ? possibly similar to those of Monteiros car. 

?It was really a tough race for both our drivers. We are glad to have finished again, as we were quite a long way off the pace,? Jordans sporting director Trevor Carlin said. 

?We were a bit disappointed about that but we knew from the start that this was going to be one of the hardest circuits for us.? 

?I am glad we finished the race when two world champions did not,? said Karthikeyan. ?Monaco is ahead of us. I am looking forward to this sixth which is a street race,? he said of the next race on May 22 in Monte Carlo. 

?I am very keen on street races. Even if Monaco is going to be a serious challenge for the car, I am looking forward to it and Ill get there with enthusiasm. No other circuit is like Monaco. Its unusual format poses unique challenges to the drivers. I have no experience in Monaco. 

?However, I have raced in Macau. Monaco seems similar. It is a very tight street track with only short straights with no space to go off the line. 

Meanwhile, it didnt go according to the script for Ferrari as their seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher retired with his title hopes looking ever more distant. The Germans third retirement in five races this season came as a result of a tyre nightmare. 

?I dont know what happened,? said Schumacher. ?I may have picked up some debris, although I didnt see anything. For something to happen to that front left-hand tyre is unusual. ?We didnt have any problems with tyre-wear. I would have been competitive right to the end.? 

As has been the case in previous races this season, Schumacher got much quicker as the race wore on, calling into question the performance of the Bridgestone tyres. 

?It would be ideal to have the same pace at the beginning as at the end, but thats something youve got to work at,? he said.

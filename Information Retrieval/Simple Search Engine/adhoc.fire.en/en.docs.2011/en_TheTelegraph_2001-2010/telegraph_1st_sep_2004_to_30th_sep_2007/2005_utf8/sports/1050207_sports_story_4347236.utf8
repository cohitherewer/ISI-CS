 Pak can never be consistent: Akram

Islamabad: Legendary pacer Wasim Akram feels Pakistan will always remain inconsistent and unpredictable despite the fact that they might play good cricket and win big matches at times. 

?Inconsistency and unpredictability will continue to be part of the Pakistan team. They can play good cricket but cannot win all the games. Even during my playing days we were never consistent,? the former Pakistani skipper said on Sunday, just days ahead of the India tour. 

?Our domestic structure is not strong enough, financial problems are being faced by cricketers and they are being inducted into the senior team at a very early stage,? he said, while citing reasons for the team?s at-times indifferent show during an interview to Daily Times. 

A lot has been said about his advice to Indian left-armers Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan. However, the Pakistan legend dismissed them as tips from a senior player to juniors. But, he rued that no bowler from his country approached him for suggestion. 

?It is lamentable that no Pakistan bowler has ever contacted me for tips or advice. I cannot ask them to come to me. They should approach on their own and I would certainly help them.? 

On Shoaib Akhtar, Akram said he has great respect for the speedster. ?Instead of giving statements, Shoaib should concentrate on his game.? 

Meanwhile, former Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz said Inzamam should be sacked right away as he was ?neither physically fit nor mentally sharp? to lead the team. ?If PCB wants to run the team in an effective way, it should work on appointing a new captain for the India series,? he said.

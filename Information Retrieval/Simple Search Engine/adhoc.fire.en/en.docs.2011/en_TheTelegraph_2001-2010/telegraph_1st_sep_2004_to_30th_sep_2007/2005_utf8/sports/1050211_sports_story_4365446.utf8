 Big-bonus carrot for Germany 

Berlin: The German Football Federation have promised Jurgen Klinsmann?s wards a 250,000 euro bonus if they can win the 2006 World Cup on home soil, according to a report in a German magazine. 

Germany?s stars will receive 50,000 euros each for reaching the quarter, 100,000 for the semi-finals and 50,000 euros for a final appearance. ?We have agreed on the conditions,? explained Germany defender Christian Worns. 

A victory in the final in Berlin on July 9, 2006 will see them net the jackpot of 250,000 euros, more than double of what was on offer in the 2002 World Cup. A 92,000 euro purse was the reward for winning the World Cup in Japan and South Korea with Germany picking up 71,500 euros after falling to a 0-2 defeat by Brazil in the final. (AFP)

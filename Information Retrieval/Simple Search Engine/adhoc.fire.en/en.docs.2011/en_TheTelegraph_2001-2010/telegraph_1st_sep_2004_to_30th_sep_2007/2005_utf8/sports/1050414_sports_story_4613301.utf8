Port-of-Spain: Makhaya Ntini, MoM in South Africa?s second Test win on Tuesday, revealed he had foreseen his success. 

The strike bowler took a career-best seven for 37 in the second innings to complete a South African record match-haul of 13 for 132. 

?On the first day, before I left my hotel room, I said: ?This is going to be my Test?,? Ntini said. ?Everybody who bowls for South Africa will want to do better than that now.? 

Ntini had not been despondent after South Africa struggled to draw the first Test. ?It?s all about dedication, I knew things could turn around,? he said.

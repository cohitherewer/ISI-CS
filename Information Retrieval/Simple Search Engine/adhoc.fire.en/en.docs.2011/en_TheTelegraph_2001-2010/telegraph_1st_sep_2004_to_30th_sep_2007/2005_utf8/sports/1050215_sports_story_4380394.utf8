The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Now, Pak squad to be named Saturday 

 - Chief selector Bari clueless about Shoaib fitness 

 Bari feels Shoaib should have appeared before PCB?s medical commission 

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has delayed by a day the announcement of the 16-member squad for the tour of India in a bid to allow foreign trainers to examine the fitness of players including paceman Shoaib Akhtar. The squad was earlier scheduled to be named on Friday. 

?The foreign trainers ? Daryl Lifson and Murray Stevenson ? will be available in Lahore on February 19. After taking the fitness tests of the probables, the trainers will report to the selectors who will then decide on the players,? PCB?s director (cricket operation) Saleem Altaf said from Lahore. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan?s chief selector Wasim Bari has said he would be completely clueless on Shoaib?s fitness level when he considers players for selection for the India series, following the paceman?s refusal to play in the Patron?s Trophy. 

?I have informed the PCB to provide me proper medical reports about the four unfit pacemen ? Shoaib, Mohammed Sami, Mohammed Khalil and Shabbir Ahmed,? Bari was quoted as saying in a local daily on Monday. 

?The PCB has formed a medical commission comprising local experts and Shoaib should have appeared before it,? he added. 

Bari also said the PCB needed to provide him the reports of both coach and manager of the team, which toured Australia before the Saturday meeting. 

When asked if the report of inquiry committee probing Shoaib was also necessary, Bari said though it was not his department, a copy should be sent to the selection committee for more information about the player. 

Shoaib was instructed by the PCB to play the second round match of the ongoing Patron?s Trophy to prove his fitness for selection to the India-bound squad. But Shoaib refused to play saying he was not fit as yet. 

Bari said it would have been better if Shoaib had played. 

?Yes, he rang me up saying he was not fit, but I told him that I want a fit and fighting Shoaib for the India tour and it would have been better if he had played for the tournament,? Bari said.

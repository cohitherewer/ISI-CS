The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Stage set for top-draw battle

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former city Commissioner of Police and state DGP Dinesh Chandra Vajpai filed his nomination papers for the CAB presidents post Tuesday. Vajpai will fight against the incumbent, Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Dalmiya also filed his papers during the day. The clash for the top post is set for July 27. The winner will have to get at least 61, of the 121 affiliates votes. 

Vajpai sent his papers through associate Samar Pal. Pal is contesting for one of the two joint secretarys post. His poll record at the CAB, though, is anything but impressive. 

The Dalmiya group has already nominated Kumartuli representative Saradindu Pal and former treasurer and Mouri Sporting representative Amitava Banerjee for the two posts. 

Vajpai, who is representing West Bengal Police, however, isnt sure he will be able to win. 

It will be tough, but many units have approached me, Vajpai said. 

The ruling CAB faction feels Vajpai will lose by a good margin.

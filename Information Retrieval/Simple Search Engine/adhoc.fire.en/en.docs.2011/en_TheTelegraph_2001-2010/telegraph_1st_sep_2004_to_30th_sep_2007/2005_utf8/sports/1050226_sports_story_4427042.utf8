Dubai: Third seed Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge rallied from a set down to beat Rainer Schuettler of Germany and Mikhail Youzhny of Russia and book a berth in the semi-finals of the Dubai Open tennis championship here. 

The Indo-Australian pair got the better of Schuettler and Youzhny 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 to set up a showdown with unseeded Czech pair of Martin Damm and Radek Stepanek for a place in the summit clash. 

Damm and Stepanek upset top seed Mark Knowles of Baharain and Daniel Nestor of Canada 6-4, 6-4 in the other quarter final. 

?It was definitely tough to beat them as both are strong singles players,? Bhupathi said after the match late on Thursday. 

Bhupathi said they were under pressure as he missed several volleys, which cost them the first set. After losing the first, Woodbridge and Bhupathi regrouped well and took the next two sets and the match. 

Coming together for the first time on a long-term basis from the start of this season, Bhupathi and Woodbridge have already won a title in Sydney. 

?We can only get better as we go on,? the Australian noted. ?I think this is a perfect partnership. And tonight we showed how we can find the way to get ourselves out of trouble in the middle,? he added. 

Federer through 

Top seed Roger Federer had to fight off two match points before squeezing past Juan Carlos Ferrero 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 to reach the quarter finals of the Dubai Open on Thursday. 

The defending champion and world No. 1 took two hours and 15 minutes to earn his victory, saving match points at 6-4 in the tie-break before claiming it 8-6. 

In other games, third seed Tim Henman struggled against Russia?s Igor Andreev early on but after edging the first set in a tie-break the Briton was able to dominate the second, breaking for 2-0 and 5-1 on the way to claiming a 7-6, 6-1 victory. 

Seventh seeded Russian Mikhail Youzhny beat Germany?s Rainer Schuettler 7-5, 6-4, but eighth seed Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia had a much tougher task in disposing of Spain?s Fernando Verdasco 6-7, 6-4, 7-6.

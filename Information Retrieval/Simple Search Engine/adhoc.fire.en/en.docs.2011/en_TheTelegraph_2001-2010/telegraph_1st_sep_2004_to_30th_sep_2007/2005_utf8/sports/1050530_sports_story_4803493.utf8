 Shoaib in image make-over 

 Shoaib has hired an expert to project himself positively 

Islamabad: After facing frequent criticism over his attitude, Pakistan crickets bad boy Shoaib Akhtar is making some serious effort for an image make-over. 

The fast bowler has hired a professional media and public affairs manager who will highlight him in a positive manner. 

Shoaib has realised that he definitely needs to boost his image among the public in a more positive manner and also convince the people he is committed to Pakistan cricket and wants to help the team do well, sources close to the fast bowler said. 

The Rawalpindi Express, who has been sidelined for the West Indies series in spite of proving his fitness in domestic competitions, is said to have appointed Sohail Kiani as his manager, who is now guiding him on all public and media-related issues. 

Kiani, who had years of experience working in the field, was also keen to project Shoaibs true image and personality to the people, the sources were quoted as saying in a local newspaper. 

He is also helping the bowler get endorsement and commercial contracts in Pakistan and abroad, they added. 

The speedster, who also missed the entire India series in March-April, is planing to leave for England in a weeks time to play some practice games for Worcestershire County Club, where his proper playing contract starts from July 1. 

He will remain busy in June playing in the practice games and by taking part in exhibition games at Lords, Houston in the United States and Jeddah, the newspaper reported. (PTI)

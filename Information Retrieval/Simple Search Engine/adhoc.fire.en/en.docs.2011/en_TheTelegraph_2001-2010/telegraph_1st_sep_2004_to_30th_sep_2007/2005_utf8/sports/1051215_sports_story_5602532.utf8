A STAFF REPORTER

 Sanjeev Mehra, who led after Round I, is now in second spot 

Calcutta: Joseph Chakola played some good golf on Day II of the Royal Challenge RCGC Cup to return a card of four-under 68 which gave him sole lead at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. Chakolas tally at the halfway stage of the tournament is three-under 141. 

Overnight leader Sanjeev Mehra slipped to second after managing a one-over 73. He is three strokes behind Chakola. In third place is Karan Singh, who shot a level par 72 for an overall tally of 145. 

Chakola started with a bang on the front nine, firing his first birdie on the sixth. He had even better returns on the return journey as he got birdies on the 12th, 15th and 17th to emerge on top. 

The RCGC is a lucky course for me? I am satisfied with my performance. If I can play well tomorrow (Thursday), I stand a good chance of winning, said Chakola. 

Scores: 141 Joseph Chakola (73, 68); 144 Sanjeev Mehra (71, 73); 145 Karan Singh (73, 72); 147 Jaskeerat Dullet (75, 72), Ranjit Singh (74, 73); 149 Ganjeet Bhullar (77, 72), Manav Das (73, 76); 150 Ajay Singh (74, 76), Chirag Kumar (74, 76), Simarjeet Singh (75, 75).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im surprised Vaughan isnt leading the World XI: Woolmer

 - England will start favourites in Pakistan, says the home coach 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Bob Woolmer

Calcutta: Once enough champagne has been downed, Englands focus is going to shift to the tour of Pakistan ? featuring three Tests and five ODIs ? which begins late next month. Home team coach Bob Woolmer (a member of the 1977 England side which won the Ashes 3-0 under Mike Brearley), though, is already into overdrive ? he has even recorded the number of catches (six) put down by Kevin Pietersen! Currently in Rawalpindi, Woolmer spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour over the telephone on Wednesday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

On whether the Ashes result changes his planning for the series against England 

Not at all? More than anything else, I plan for my team? The opposition comes into the picture, yes, but I focus on my players. 

On who will start as favourites 

England? Theyve been terrific over the past 18 months or so in the longer version and are on a roll. Unfortunately, my boys havent consistently played good Test cricket. The very best weve done, in my tenure, is winning in Bangalore six months ago. 

On whether he expected England to win back the Ashes after 16 years 

No? However, I felt proud when England did win (on Monday)? Australia came out strongly in the last Test, but let go opportunities to draw level. First, when England were allowed to recover from 131 for four on the first day and, then, when Ricky Ponting and the rest didnt get to 600 despite being 264 for one. All credit to England, though. 

On whether England have beaten the strongest side ever 

Certainly one of the greatest? Perhaps, the West Indies under Clive Lloyd in the early Eighties were stronger. 

On what made the difference for England 

Sheer doggedness, just hanging in there? Attention to detail, planning? The players skills as well. (After a pause) The high level of fitness, too, played a big part. For example, it was as late as the last Test that an injury kept a key bowler ? Simon Jones ? out of the XI? Not long ago, England had flair and ability, but often struggled with fitness. 

On the turning point 

Englands three-wicket win at Trent Bridge (fourth Test)? The result suggests the match was close, but England actually won comfortably. 

On what cost Australia dear 

Over-confidence? They talked of a 5-0 scoreline and stuff like that? My view is that you first deliver and, then, talk. (Again, after a pause) Glenn McGraths fitness also impacted heavily. 

On coach Duncan Fletchers contribution 

Enormous? He took charge after the 1999 World Cup when English cricket was at rock-bottom? He forged an excellent partnership with (Nasser) Hussain ? under whom Englands Renaissance began ? and, in recent years, Michael Vaughan. Do remember a coach is only as good as his captain? Fletcher, I think, was instrumental in getting the ECB to award central contracts and that helped create the right environment? Fletchers known to be a good man-manager and enjoys the confidence of his employers. Even when the results werent satisfactory, the ECB stood by him. Thats important. 

On whether the England versus Pakistan clash is going to be fought at two levels ? the countries and between him and Fletcher 

(Laughs) I hope the Media doesnt project it as a face-off between the coaches? That, after all, will be unfair on the players. No matter what a coach does, the players execute plans and the credit has to go to them. Were the backroom boys! 

On where he would rank Fletcher among contemporary coaches 

Forget rating somebody in my own business, I dont like putting numbers on anybody? Fletcher, however, is at the top with the Bobby Simpsons? For me, Simpson is the father of cricket coaching. 

On Vaughans captaincy 

I dont need to emphasise hes among the very best? His field placements and bowling changes are impressive? Hes particular about everything and looks a leader. Obviously, he has the respect of his team. Im surprised he isnt leading the World XI in next months Super Series. I would have picked him as captain and, then, selected the other 12. 

On Andrew Flintoff, Englands Man of the Series 

Hes taken time to establish himself? Early on, its possible Flintoff himself didnt realise just how good he was? Moreover, today, hes much fitter? As with everything else in life, theres a time for special moments? Flintoffs coincided perfectly with Englands ambitions. 

Finally, on the Australians worry over lining up replacements for McGrath and Shane Warne 

(Laughs again) Well, nobody is ever going to be good enough to slip into their shoes. Some simply cant be replaced.

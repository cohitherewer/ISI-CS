Osaka: Chinas world record holder Liu Xiang improved the seasons best time with Americans Justin Gatlin and Allyson Felix winning their sprints at the Japan Grand Prix on Saturday. 

Liu clocked 13.12 for an easy victory in the mens 110m hurdles in his first international event. 

Olympic champion Gatlin failed to beat Maurice Greenes best mark of the season at 10.03, but his time of 10.15 was enough to win the mens 100m, beating fellow-American Brian Lewis and Obadele Thompson of Barbados. 

Felix, a teenage prodigy who won the 100m and 200m silver medals in the Athens Olympics, timed 11.30 to lead an American 1-2 finish with Angela Daigle, beating Japans Tomoko Ishida into third in the womens 100m. 

For Gatlin, winner of the 100m gold, the 4x100m relay silver and the 200m bronze medals in Athens, it was his first individual race this season after winning the 4x100m relay at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia last week. ?Overall, it was a good race and a good opener. Hopefully, I can continue like this,? said Gatlin. 

Chinas Zhang Wenxiu defeated Athens Olympic champion Olga Kuzenkova of Russia to win the womens hammer throw, narrowly missing a new Asian record in the process. 

The 19-year-old Chinese marked 72.34 metres in her second throw, only eight centimetres short of her own Asian record set last year. Kuzenkova finished second with a result of 69.77. 

?Im very satisfied with my record today, because this is my first competition of the season. Its only eight centimetres shorter than my personal best,? said Zhang, who also defeated Kuzenkova in Yokohama in September.

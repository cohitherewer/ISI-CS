The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The good luck arrival...

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Colombo: Its not unusual for Sourav Ganguly to misplace his hotel room key. It was no different on Thursday evening, after a run on the beach, a pool session and around an hour of looking back and ahead with teammates. 

While the former Team India captain waited for the housekeeping staff to get the spare key, current vice-captain Virender Sehwag waited for wife Arti to open his room. 

Oh, good luck has arrived... Tumhare liye achcha ho ga, Sourav remarked, directing his comment at Sehwag, who has had an awful tri-series. 

Incidentally, Dona was also to have come here for the tournaments closing stage, but plans got altered after Souravs omission from the Asia squad. 

Now, Ill be at home till our Zimbabwe tour later this month... Dona would have come had I been required for the three (Asia versus Africa) ODIs in South Africa soon after this tri-series, Sourav told The Telegraph.

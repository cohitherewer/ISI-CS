 Anzello may win Leger 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Anzello, the runaway winner of the 

falsely run 2,800m race ? the Queen?s Cup ? may find his task a daunting one against 

Calorific in the Calcutta St Leger, over an identical trip, on Saturday.

 Neither the ?terms? of the race nor the real potential of the runners count in such two-horse races. It, therefore, may turn out to be another farce as the pace in the race may pick up only in the last 1,000m or so. Nevertheless, Anzello may have to sweat it out to beat his rival. Incidentally, both Both horses hail from trainer Vijay Singh?s stable. 

The focus during the afternoon, is going to be on 

trainer Bharath Singh?s Sanskara, the star contender in the 1,400m Acorn Stakes. 

The Don?t Forget Me-Shiseido filly had displayed amazing turn of foot in the ?Million? 

and may repeat the performance in the trusted hands of C. Rajendra.

 Premiership footballer accused of rape

London: English football, where soccer and scandals go side by side, has been hit by another controversy with a Premiership footballer being accused of rape at a West End nightclub here. 

The player is being investigated by police in the wake of charges made by two women that they were raped at the hotel after being picked up by the player. 

Detectives from Operation Sapphire, which investigates all sexual assaults in the capital, are in the process of interviewing the women about the allegations, which centre around a highly paid young player who is an international. 

The allegations are the latest in a series of claims of rape and gangrape that have been made against Premiership stars in the last two years. 

Although none of the allegations have been substantiated, the flurry of claims, many of which are played out in the pages of tabloids, focuses attention on the behaviour of young, highly paid footballers both on and off the pitch. 

In the latest case, the women told police they met the player and one of his friends, neither of whom have been named, at a West End Nightclub on Saturday night. 

They claimed the four later went back to a ?1,000 a night suite in a five star hotel where both men took turns to rape them. 

The footballer had played in a Premiership game that day and was understood to be staying overnight at the hotel. 

Detectives have taken statements from the women and are assessing details of their allegations. 

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: We can confirm police are investigating allegations of serious sexual assault at a location in central London in the early hours of Sunday. 

Scenes of crimes officers sealed off the penthouse apartment at the hotel on Wednesday and police also visited the nightclub. 

The focus on allegations about Premiership stars has raised questions about their behaviour and that of young women who may pursue them and then make claims of sexual assault through papers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Courier, Noah elected to Hall of Fame

Newport: Major champions Jim Courier, Yannick Noah and Jana Novotna were elected to the international tennis Hall of Fame, along with tour administrator Butch Buchholz. 

The 2005 class was announced on Wednesday by Hall president Tony Trabert. 

Courier, 34, won the French Open in 1991-92 and the Australian Open in 1992-93, spent a total of 58 weeks ranked No. 1, and helped the United States win the Davis Cup in 1992 and 1995. 

Wearing a white ball cap, courier pounded the ball from the baseline like a baseball slugger, using skills carried over from the sport that was his first love. He joined Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang in dominating a decade of the men?s game, and was the first of that group to win two Grand Slam tournaments and the first to be ranked No. 1.

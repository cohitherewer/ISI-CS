 Love-all for Lleyton-Bec

 - Australian Open runner-up announces marriage with actor-girlfriend

Sydney: Australian Open runner-up Lleyton Hewitt is to marry actor Bec Cartwright after a whirlwind romance, the couple said in a joint statement on Monday. 

Hewitt proposed after losing Sunday?s final in Melbourne to Russian Marat Safin, thereby missing his chance to become the first Australian in nearly three decades to win the singles title. 

?Lleyton and Bec met five years ago at a Starlight Foundation charity tennis day and rekindled their relationship late last year,? the statement said. ?The couple were instantly committed to each other. 

?Bec proudly revealed the ring presented to her by Lleyton... to overjoyed family and friends at the post-tennis final celebrations.? 

Hewitt, 23, had been due to marry Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters next month, but she called the wedding off three months ago following a four-year relationship. 

Cartwright was also involved in a long-term relationship before splitting with actor Beau Brady late last year. 

The 21-year-old features in ?Home and Away?, an Australian TV soap opera. She was a regular fixture in the Hewitt family supporters box during the Australian Open. 

Hewitt publicly thanked her for supporting him after his loss to Safin but there was no indication of his pending proposal. According to local media reports, Cartwright had no advance warning but Hewitt was prepared with a ?big diamond?. 

Hewitt had dedicated his life to winning the Australian Open since his parents Cherilyn and Glynn first drove him from their home in Adelaide to watch the championship as a small child. 

He won the US Open in 2001 and Wimbledon a year later but had never made it past the fourth round in Australia in eight previous attempts. 

He sailed into this year?s final on a wave of patriotism fuelled by his never-say-die attitude and survived two epic matches on his way to the final only to run out of gas.

 Peles son arrested 

Sao Paulo: Edson do Nascimento, son of Brazilian football legend Pele, was arrested here on suspicion of being a member of a drug trafficking and kidnapping gang, police said. 

The 35-year-old Edinho, as Peles son is known, was detained with 17 other people. The gang is alleged to have links with other criminal gangs operating in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. 

Police said they believe the gang was involved in the kidnapping of the mother of Brazilian footballer Robinho last year. The woman, Marina Souza, was freed in late December after a $200,000 ransom had been paid for her release. 

Some 70 police officers participated in the arrests in Sao Paulo, which also netted weapons and 11 vehicles, according to media reports. Edinho is a former footballer with the Santos club, where Pele also played. 

Pele, one of the greatest footballers of all time who won the World Cup three times with Brazil, went on to become a government minister in his home country. (AFP)

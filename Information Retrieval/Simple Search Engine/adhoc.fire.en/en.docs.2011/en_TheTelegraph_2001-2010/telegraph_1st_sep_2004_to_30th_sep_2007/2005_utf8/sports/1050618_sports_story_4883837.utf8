 Easy draw for Paes in doubles

London: Leander Paes and Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic drew easy first-round opponents in mens doubles at Wimbledon. The fifth seeds, drawn in the lower half with No. 2 seeds Bob and Mike Bryan, will face Lucas Arnold (Argentina) and Danielle Bracciali (Italy). 

Mahesh Bhupathi and Todd Woodbridge have a slightly tougher opening assignment when the sixth seeds take on Americans Graydon Oliver and Jared Palmer. 

Sania Mirza, partnering Russian Anna Chakvetadze, will take on Alina Jidkova of Russia and Tatiana Perebiynis of Ukraine in the opening round tie. 

Sania, who played alongside world No. 43 Anna in the French Open and reached the second round, will be hoping for a better show at the All England Club where she won the junior doubles title in 2003. 

In womens singles, world No. 72 Sania will take on Japans Akiko Morigami in the first round. 

In singles action, Argentine world No. 8 Guillermo Canas has pulled out. Canas, a claycourt specialist who reached the quarter-finals of the French Open earlier this month, had been seeded seventh for the grasscourt Grand Slam. Dutchman Sjeng Schalken also pulled out. Officials were unable to confirm the reasons for either mans withdrawal.

 Real fans blamed for creating tense atmosphere 

Madrid: Brazilian trio Ronaldo, Julio Baptista and Roberto Carlos have blamed Real Madrid fans for creating a tense atmosphere that has made it difficult for the team to play well in home matches. 

Real have been jeered and whistled by their own fans in recent games at the Bernabeu and their reaction to the sides narrow 1-0 victory over neighbours Getafe two weeks ago was instrumental in the dismissal of coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo. 

We wont win anything if the team and the fans go out there in an atmosphere of tension, Baptista told newsmen after his sides 1-1 draw with Osasuna on Sunday. 

The whistling has to end because if not we wont get anywhere. 

Fellow-striker Ronaldo complained after the draw against Getafe that playing at the Bernabeu was like playing away from home. 

Defender Roberto Carlos said the impatience of the fans was making the players nervous when they stepped on to the pitch. We were never able to relax when we had the ball at our feet because the fans wanted us to play so quickly, but we have got to be more patient, he told the clubs website. 

The Brazilian left-back appeared to be one of the players most affected by the atmosphere during Sundays match. 

He injured Osasunas Valdo with a tough two-footed tackle in the 15th minute and sarcastically clapped his former teammate off the pitch when he had to go off. (Reuters)

 Sourav: I wont miss any attention 

 - Captaincy is not an issue? Im just looking forward to playing 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Former captain Sourav Ganguly spoke briefly to The Telegraph soon after his arrival in Dambulla, very early on Monday, and then had a chat with the touring Mediamen in the afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

On a new role 

Ive been an ordinary player before... I wont miss any attention as Ive had quite a bit of it for over five years... Im not going to mind it. 

On the Team India captaincy 

Ive been captain for five-and-half years... Its not an issue and Im not worried. Whats to happen will happen... Im just looking forward to playing. 

On interacting with Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell 

I called up Rahul in his room... We spoke briefly, but our conversation wasnt cricket-specific... I met Greg at lunch... Now that Im here, opportunities to talk about the game are bound to be there. 

On whether hes expecting to open 

As Ive said, Im going to abide by what the team management decides... The teams interest comes first. 

On whether he would have handled the bowlers differently had he been captain in the opener (against Sri Lanka) 

It wont be proper for me to comment... In any case, things seem easier from afar. 

On fielding only one specialist spinner, Harbhajan Singh 

The team management got the combination right. 

On Dravid, too, acknowledging that omitting Anil Kumble was a most difficult decision 

Cant be otherwise... I would feel the same way. 

On newcomers Suresh Raina and Yalaka Venugopal Rao 

I just watched the first match... Raina was superb in the field and Venugopal batted well. However, its much too early to form an opinion. Lets give them time. 

On the Rangiri International Stadium wicket 

The boys have told me its dual paced... For runs, one has to grind. 

On being a mere 55 away from 10,000 ODI runs 

Thats something to look forward to... More than that, an Indian win in the (August 9/10) tri-series final... 

On two months with Glamorgan 

I got some runs... More important, County cricket helped me stay in touch with the game. 

On Sanath Jayasuriya 

His fitness will have a bearing on Sri Lankas performance... Obviously, hes a great.

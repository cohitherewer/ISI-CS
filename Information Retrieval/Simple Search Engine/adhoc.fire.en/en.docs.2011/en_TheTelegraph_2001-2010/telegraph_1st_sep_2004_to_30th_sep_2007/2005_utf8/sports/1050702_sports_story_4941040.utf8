The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lara, Sarwan, Gayle omitted

London: West Indies have named a squad shorn of several leading players for their July tour of Sri Lanka as a result of the contract dispute dogging the sport in the islands. 

Leading batsmen Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle were omitted from the 14-man squad named on Friday, although captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul will travel for the two Tests and a one day tri-series also involving India. 

Eight of the squad are currently in Sri Lanka. 

After discussions between the West Indies Cricket (WICB) Board and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) broke down on the issue of the sponsorship guarantee fees, the WICB named a squad from those who had agreed to sign the contracts offered. 

We did everything in our power but unfortunately the WIPA found almost all suggested meeting dates inconvenient, said Roger Braithwaite, CEO of the WICB.

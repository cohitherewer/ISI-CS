The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Beckham all praise for Mourinho

 - England captain says he knows what Frisk has gone through 

 Beckham declines to comment on his leaving Real 

Berlin: Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham, who has faced death threats in the past, told a German weekly that he understood what Swedish referee Anders Frisk had gone through. 

Frisk, regarded as one of soccer?s top referees, retired after he was repeatedly threatened by Chelsea fans following the Premier League club?s February 23 Champions League first leg loss to Barcelona. 

?That is terrible. I can understand him,? Beckham said. ?I?ve been threatened with death a number of times. That happens again and again in professional football.? 

Beckham angered English fans after getting ejected in a 1998 World Cup loss to Argentina. A year later, police foiled an attempt to kidnap his wife Victoria and son Brooklyn. In 2000, someone also cut the brake lines in his Ferrari. 

?These threats have changed my life and that of my family,? the England captain said. ?It?s not fun, but I can live with it. It?s the price we have to pay.? 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been blamed by some for inciting the club?s fans against Frisk. 

The Portuguese coach disputed a red card given to Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, which reduced his team to 10 men for most of the second half at the Nou Camp. 

Beckham, however, praised the controversial manager for the way he deflected criticism of his players onto himself, something that he said has been absent at Real Madrid. 

?Mourinho is a very good manager and a great personality. He takes care of his players, protects them and consciously turns the criticism onto himself,? Beckham said. 

?In Madrid, the whole criticism is directed at the players at the moment. Mourinho treats players the way they should be treated.? 

Madrid, despite boasting some of the sport?s biggest superstars, was knocked out of the Champions League by Juventus. The Spanish league title hopes too seem distant as the club trails runaway leader Barcelona by 11 points. 

Beckham had no comment on reports that some of Real Madrid?s stars may be forced to leave the club, with the names often floated including Raul Gonzalez, Luis Figo and himself. 

?My contract still runs two years ? there?s been rumours since I joined Madrid,? he said.

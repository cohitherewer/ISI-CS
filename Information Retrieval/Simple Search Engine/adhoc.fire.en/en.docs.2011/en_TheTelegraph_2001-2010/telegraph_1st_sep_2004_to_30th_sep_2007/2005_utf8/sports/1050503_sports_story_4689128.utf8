The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tough task for EB now

 - NFL - Title race intriguingly poised 

 Sangram 

Margao: Defending champions East Bengal survived several anxious moments before managing to hold Salgaocar goalless in a National Football League for the ONGC Cup match at Nehru Stadium on Sunday. 

The result left the title-race intriguingly poised. Sporting Clube de Goa are on top with 42 points from 20 matches. Dempo have 41 points from 19 matches, while East Bengal ? seeking a hattrick of titles ? have 40 from an identical number of games. 

East Bengal can clinch the title if they win their remaining three games. Sporting, with two matches to play, have to win both and then hope that East Bengal slip in at least one. 

Salgaocar, in seventh position (24 points from 20 matches), had the better of exchanges and put East Bengal under tremendous pressure. The Goan outfit could have taken the lead in the third minute itself, but Jerose Oliveira chested the ball straight into ?keeper Sangram Mukherjee?s hands off a Bello Rasaq pass. 

Fabio Passo, who worked hard in the middle, was twice guilty, failing to utilise passes from Felix Ibrebru. East Bengal had a wonderful opportunity midway in the first half. Ernest Jeremiah, who was put through inside the box, managed a weak shot straight to custodian Juje Siddi. 

In the second half, Ibrebru ? who was adjudged Man of the Match ? fired a smart shot which was kept out by Sangram. The goalkeeper again came to East Bengal?s rescue midway through the second session as he dived to his right to deny Ibrebru. (PTI)

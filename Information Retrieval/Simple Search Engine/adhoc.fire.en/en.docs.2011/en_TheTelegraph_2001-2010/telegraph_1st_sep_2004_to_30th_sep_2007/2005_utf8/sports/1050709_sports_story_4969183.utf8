The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jaidip, Akhtar peeved at foreign hand

 - Stalwarts of state disappointed with BTA

Calcutta: The Bengal Tennis Associations (BTA) move to hire Michael Mooney ? a professional coach from New Zealand ? for training kids has not gone down well with the former greats of the state, who feel disappointed at being ignored in serving the state body. 

Former Davis Cuppers Jaidip Mukerjea and Akhtar Ali insist that the BTA needs to involve those who are loaded with experience and can boast of producing champions. 

Mooney ? a qualified ITF coach who runs a full-fledged academy in Christchurch ? has been currently holding a five-day camp to train kids at the BTAs development programme, which began on Tuesday. 

While Mukerjea appears extremely hurt and wonders if the short stint of not-so-famous foreign coaches will bring about any drastic improvement for the trainees, Ali maintains experience has no substitute. 

Getting the service of Pat Cash is perfectly all right, but hiring somebody from a country which has no rich tradition of the game and who is not quite a familiar face as well, is really baffling to me, Mukerjea said. 

I also dont think that a short duration of such appointment (of foreign coach) will lead to any good in the long term, the former non-playing Davis Cup captain added. 

Ali, on the other hand, thinks his vast experience and understanding of the game may be coming in the way of his association with the state body. 

Maybe the BTA doesnt want to be associated with somebody who knows too much about the game. May be Im too outspoken and thats why Im being ignored, he told The Telegraph. 

BTA secretary Hiranmoy Chatterjee, however, rubbishes such allegations as he says the duos credentials dont fit in his scheme of things. 

The BTA is looking at those people (as coach) who have strong legs, who can spend six-to-eight hours on the court along with the pupils. 

Were not looking at doctors, who prescribe medicines from outside the field of action, he remarked. 

But doesnt experience have a greater say? Cant someone from the state devote more time to the kids? Chatterjee disagrees. 

Experience is associated with experts while in my book, a coachs job is to train the players by staying on the court, by playing with them. 

And weve not reached a stage where we need experts. If such a situation arises in future, may be well think of hiring experts, but not now, Chatterjee pointed out. 

Therein lies people like Alis grudge. 

Agreeing that one of the best things to happen for the BTA in recent times is its tennis centre, the former Davis Cup player and coach didnt hide his surprise at the fact that while his service is being sought from everywhere in the world, his very own state has turned a blind eye to him. 

Chatterjee, though, has an answer to it: Our promotional and development programme has a separate meaning? it doesnt require a teacher who teaches physics, chemistry and so on. We need a young face of such programme and for that a physically fit teacher is our top priority.

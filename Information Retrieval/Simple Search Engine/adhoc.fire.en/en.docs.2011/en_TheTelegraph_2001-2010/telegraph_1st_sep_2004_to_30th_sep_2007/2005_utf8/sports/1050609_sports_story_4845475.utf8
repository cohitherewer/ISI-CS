 Nadal slips on grass

Halle: Newly-crowned French Open champion Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the Halle Open to Germanys Alexander Waske as the Spanish teenager made an unhappy transition from clay to grass on Wednesday. 

Nadal, who arrived in Germany Monday evening, lost to the local favourite 6-4, 5-7, 3-6. It was the Spaniards first defeat in 26 matches. 

If Nadal had reached the semi-finals of the Wimbledon warm-up event, he could have faced world No. 1 Roger Federer, who he beat in the last four of the French Open a week ago. 

In another Wimbledon build-up meet, Andy Roddick began his quest for a hattrick of Stella Artois titles by outclassing Australian wild card Mark Philippoussis 6-2, 6-4 in London. 

The match was expected to be a fierce battle between the two men who have finished runner-up to Federer at Wimbledon over the past two years. But Roddick, whose only two defeats on the fast surface since 2003 have been by Federer, proved to be in a different league. (Reuters)

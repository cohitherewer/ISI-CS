 Defeat for Kothari 

Pune: Double Asian Games gold medallist Ashok Shandilya got back on winning track as he registered a comfortable victory over compatriot Saurav Kothari in a group C tie of the Asian Billiards Championship here on Tuesday. 

Shandilya, who suffered a surprising loss on Monday, beat Kothari 3-1. He won the opening frame which included a break of 47 in 102-up but lost the second. However, Shandilya regrouped himself in the third and fourth frames, the last one boasting of an unfinished break of 85. 

Defending champion Devendra Joshi had a smooth sailing in a group A. 

In group B, B. Bhaskar thrashed Sri Lankan W.A.J. Weerasinghe 3-0 while Myanmar?s Aung San, who in a major upset on Monday defeated Shandilya, beat Lim Jia Sheng of Singapore 3-0. 

Defending champion Joshi and seven-time world champion Geet Sethi recorded easy wins to enhance their propspects for a berth in the quarter finals. Both pounded Sirisoma in identical fashion, 3-0 to move a step closer to the last 16 stage. 

Sethi overcame a surprisingly scrappy display in the opening frame before he settled down in the second, uncorking an unfinished 71 break, and sealed the win with a break of 82 in the third. 

National champion Pankaj Advani beat Singapore?s Ang Boon Tommy 3-0 for his third win to maintain a clean record in group B. (PTI)

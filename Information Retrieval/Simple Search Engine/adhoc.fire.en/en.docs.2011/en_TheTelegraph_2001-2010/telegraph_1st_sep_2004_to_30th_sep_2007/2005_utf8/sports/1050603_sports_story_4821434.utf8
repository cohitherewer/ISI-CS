 Gajanans new mark; Sunitas 1500m crown 

New Delhi: Gajanan Upadhaya of Uttar Pradesh ensured that for the second consecutive day the focus in the Federation Cup athletics championship remained on pole vault as he won the mens title creating a new meet record. 

If it was the UP girl Chetna Solanki who caught the eye with a new national record in womens pole vault on Wednesday, it was Upadhaya on Thursday night who cleared 5 metres in his very first attempt to eclipse the meet record of 4.90, which stood in the name of Geesh Kumar of Kerala. 

Among other notable performances were Asian Games gold medallist Sunita Rani winning the womens 1500m title and Ghamanda Ram completing a double adding the mens 1500m crown to the 800m title which he won on Thursday. 

Sunita, who warmed up for the season by winning the 10,000m event at a circuit meet in Patiala last month, clocked 4 minutes and 20.63 seconds to take the top honours. Sinimol Paulose of Jharkhand timed 4:27.26 to take the silver while the bronze medal went to Keralas .P. Jaisha who clocked 4:28.29. (PTI)

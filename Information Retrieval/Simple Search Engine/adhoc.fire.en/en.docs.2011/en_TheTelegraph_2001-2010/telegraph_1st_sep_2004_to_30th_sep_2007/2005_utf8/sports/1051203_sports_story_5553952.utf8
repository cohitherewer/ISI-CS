 CSKA in trouble after 0-1 defeat

London: Uefa Cup holders CSKA Moscow face the prospect of failing to reach the knockout stage after losing 0-1 at Dinamo Bucharest on Thursday. 

The Russian champions, who have completed their group F fixtures and have only four points from four games, must rely on results going their way in the final round of matches next week to qualify for the last-32. 

CSKA need Dinamo to lose at group leaders Olympique Marseille and hope Dutch side Heerenveen do not beat Levski Sofia to extend their European interest into next year. 

Midfielder Vlad Munteanu netted a 72nd-minute winner for Dinamo, reacting first after a shot from Iannis Zicu had struck the crossbar. 

Levski Sofia joined Marseille in qualifying from group F after the Bulgarian side overcame the former European champions 1-0 thanks to a superb Hristo Jovov goal, the striker beating two defenders before curling a sweet shot into the corner early in the second half. 

Rapid Bucharest, Shakhtar Donetsk, VfB Stuttgart, Zenit St Petersburg and Sevilla also went through to the last-32 on Thursday, joining Middlesbrough, Marseille, Racing Strasbourg, AZ Alkmaar, Litex Lovech, Lokomotiv Moscow and Steaua Bucharest who had already qualified. 

The top three teams from each of the eight groups qualify for the knockout phase and will be joined by the eight third-place finishers from the Champions League group stage. 

Unbeaten Rapid Bucharest made it three wins from three in group G, midfielder Marius Maldarasanu firing home a 20-metre free kick ? his fourth goal of the competition ? in first-half injury time to sink PAOK Salonika 1-0.

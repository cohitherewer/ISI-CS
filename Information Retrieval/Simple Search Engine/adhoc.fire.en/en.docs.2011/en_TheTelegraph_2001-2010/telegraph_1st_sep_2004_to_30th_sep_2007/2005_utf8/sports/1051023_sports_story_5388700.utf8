 Vasco stun Bagan

 - Federation Cup 

 - Salgaocar beat Punjab Police to make quarters 

 Mohun Bagans Tomba Singh missed the crucial second kick in the sudden death 

 Margao: The 27th Federation Cup is turning 

 out to be a tournament of upsets. After Dempo, its 

 Mohun Bagans turn on Saturday. 

 Vasco Sports Club played their hearts out to stun 

 11-time champions and last years finalists Mohun Bagan 

 via sudden death 6-5 and book a place in the quarter finals 

 against Salgaocar at the Nehru Stadium. 

This is a big setback for the most successful team in the tournament, since they came to Goa riding on their success in the CFL Premier Division and back-to-back wins over East Bengal back home. 

Mohun Bagan lost to Dempo in last years title-round, which was, however, remembered for the tragic death of Cristiano Junior during the match. 

Vasco have been already eliminated in the first round, having gone down to HASC in the tournament-opener. 

After both Mohun Bagan and Vasco failed to break the deadlock in the regulation and extra time, the tie-breaker was employed. 

This also did not yield a result as both the teams ended 4-4. In the sudden death, Vascos Anthony Fernandes and Rovan Pereira found the net while for Mohun Bagan, Tomba Singh failed to score as his kick hit the bar after his captain Mehtab Hussain scored. 

In the tie-breaker, Desmond Fernandes, Caitan Costa, Anthony Pereira and Milagrio Medeira scored for Vasco while Cedric Pexeitos kick was saved by Mohun Bagan keeper Subrata Pal. 

For the losers, Gley Yao Rodrique, Noel Wilson, Eduardo Coelho and Dharamjit Singh found the net while Mehrajuddin Wadao shot out. 

The Vasco-Salgaocar match will take place on Tuesday. 

Earlier in the day, Salgaocar scored an easy 3-1 win over Punjab Police. Salgaocar scored through Fabio Passos, substitute Samson Singh and Francis Andrade while Punjab Police, who never looked threatening, pulled one back through Harnek Singh. 

Fabio, who spearheaded Salgaocars attack, gave them the lead in the 8th minute when he headed home off a flag-kick. 

Punjab Police found the equaliser in the 25th minute when Singhs free-kick from the right beat keeper Sangram Mukherjee to his right. Both teams finished the first-half at 1-1. The change of ends saw Salgaocar completely dominating the show and increase the lead in the 62nd minute. 

Fabio also contributed to the other two goals. He dogged past two defenders and took a shot, the ball deflected towards the keeper and Fabio headed to unmark Samson who slotted the ball into the empty net. 

 Fabio again was in the centre of action as he initiated 

 the move on the right and relayed the ball to Andrade. The 

 latter essayed a left-footer that curled and beat keeper 

 Sunil Kumar to find the far post. (Agencies)

 Inzy to keep faith in pacers

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Sunday said he would keep a close eye on the upcoming Ashes series to gauge Englands form ahead of their tour here. 

Inzamam said Pakistans strength lay in their speed bowling and that he would not pack the team with spinners, which was blamed for Pakistans first home defeat to England in 39 years in 2000. 

Fast bowlers have been our strength and if they are fully fit I will go with the fast bowlers, he said. (AFP)

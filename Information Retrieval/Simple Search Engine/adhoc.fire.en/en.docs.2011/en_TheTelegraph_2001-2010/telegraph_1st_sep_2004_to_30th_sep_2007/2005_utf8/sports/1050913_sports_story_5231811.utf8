 Spa-Francorchamps: Italian Jarno Trulli has accused his Toyota team of costing him a podium finish in Sunday?s Belgian Grand Prix.

 Trulli crashed out at Spa after a collision with Jordan?s Tiago Monteiro nine laps from the end.

 He had been running with the leaders until the first pitstop, after the safety car was deployed on lap 11, when he changed his tyres from intermediates to slicks despite the dampness of the track.

 ?The teams decision to put on slicks at the first stop was a colossal absurdity,? Trulli was quoted as saying on Monday. ?The team robbed me of a podium because the car was going really well on this track. I would have been on the podium, taking into account Montoya?s retirement.?

 Bangalore: Ace Indian golfer Jyoti Randhawa, after finishing 14th at the Singapore Open on Sunday, will be flying straight to Bangalore to take part in the Rs 12 lakh Hero Honda Open South commencing here on Tuesday at the Karnataka Golf Association.

 The strong field includes Mukesh Kumar, who is fresh from victory in the season-opener at Chennai, Vijay Kumar, defending champion Ashok Kumar, Digvijay Singh, S. S. P. Chowrasia, Rafique Ali, Sanjay Kumar, Harinder Gupta and Firoz Ali.

 Bucharest: Romania?s anti-discrimination watchdog wants the national soccer federation (FRF) to take action against increasing displays of racism at matches.

 Romanian champions Steaua Bucharest were given a stadium ban by Uefa last Friday after fans whistled and booed black players in Irish club Shelbourne?s side during a Champions League match.

 ?The image of Romanian soccer is in deep crisis and Steaua pays now for the FRF?s lack of reaction (to racist behaviour) over the past several years,? Csaba Asztalos, president of the country?s Anti-Discrimination Council (CNCD), said on Monday.

 Marrakech: East Timor and the island nation of Comoros were accepted as full members of Fifa on Monday, taking the number of national associations who comprise world football?s governing body to 207.

 East Timor, whose FA was founded in 2001 and affiliated to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 2002, was voted in by delegates at the Fifa Congress with 198 in favour and one against.

 Comoros was also voted in as new Fifa members as part of the African confederation with 198 votes for and three against.

 Sofia: Bulgarian police said on Monday they had arrested 77 soccer fans following violence at a derby match between CSKA Sofia and Levski that left six police officers injured. Supporters and police clashed during and after Sunday?s match in which champions CSKA held league leaders Levski to a 1-1 draw.

 One of the police officers suffered concussion and remains in hospital, while the others were treated for their injuries and released, a hospital official told state news agency BTA.

 Cairo: South Korea stunned favourites Japan to take the mens team title as the world judo championships drew to a close on Monday.

 France denied the South Koreans a double with victory in the women?s event.

 Japan?s world under-90kg champion Hiroshi Izumi lost his bout as Korea took an unassailable 3-1 lead through Jong Bu-Kyong, Kim Min-gu and Hwang Hee-tae.

 Georgia defeated France for the first men?s bronze medal. Brazil won the other medal after Egypt was forced to withdraw two players due to injury. 

 Beijing: In a bid to make the doubles version of the game more exciting, ATP announced sweeping changes in the scoring format which will be tested for the first time at this week?s China Open.

 According to the new format, the tie-breaks will be played at 5-5 instead of 6-6. At deuce, there will be a ?sudden death? point to end the game and the receiving team can choose which partner takes the return.

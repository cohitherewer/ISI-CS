 JCT test for Mahindra

 Sandip Nandy has performed well under Mahindra bar 

Mumbai: Mahindra United will take on JCT, Phagwara in their eighth round match in the ninth National Football League encounter for the ONGC Cup at the Cooperage on Monday. 

Mahindra United, who have 11 points from seven games, will have to be cautious while defending against the JCT forward line consisting of Harvinder Singh, Alexander Jebba and Bimal Bilva. 

Mansuru Mohammed has been quite impressive under the bar for the visitors while their defence consists of Jagjit Randhawa, Harpreet Singh and Julius Akpele. 

Their midfield too is quite flexible with Taranjit Singh, Baldeep Singh, Sukhwinder Singh and Ram Pal manning it. 

On the bench, they have Karanjit Singh, Daljit Singh, K.V. Dhanesh, Shivraj Singh, Jaswinder Singh, Manjit Singh and Hardeep Gill. 

The hosts will depend on goalkeeper Sandip Nandy to come up with another fine performance under the bar. Their defence consists of Surkumar Singh, Covan Lawrence and M.S. Manju. 

In the midfield, they have Peter Siddique, K. Koluthungan, skipper S. Venkatesh and Jatin Bisht while their forward line consists of Debabrata Roy, Rodrigo de Almeida and Flavio Rodrigues. 

Sunder Rajan, Jinto Jose, Hekmat Singh, Khalid Siddique, Khalid Jamil, Steven Dias and Abhishek Yadav bring up the bench strength. 

Meanwhile in Kozhikode, owning moral responsibility for the continuing dismal show by Goan outfit Churchill Brothers and expressing displeasure over the team set-up, its coach Shabbir Ali has resigned from the post.

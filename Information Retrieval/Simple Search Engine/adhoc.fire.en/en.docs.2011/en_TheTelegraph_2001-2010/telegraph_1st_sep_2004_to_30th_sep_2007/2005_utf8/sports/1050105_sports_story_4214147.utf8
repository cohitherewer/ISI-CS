 Rastogi a good talent: Bjorkman

Chennai: Paradorn Srichaphan was a tired man when he came to the press conference at 11 pm. He had just won a match, which Christophe Rochus could well have won in straight sets. 

?I did well to hang in there? even when I was down I just didn?t give it away,? Srichaphan said. ?I was playing a competitive match after nearly two months, so I am happy to have got a win.? 

Carlos Moya, too, looked in trouble against Julian Knowle. The left-handed Austrian led 3-1 and looked like giving the Spaniard a run for his money. That was not to be as the champion took the wake-up call seriously and pressed the accelerator button just enough to regain control of proceedings. 

?A win is a win, even if the scoreline showed it was tight. Except for one or two games, I played well?Those things happen, it?s normal,? said a visibly-satisfied Moya. 

Jonas Bjorkman, another of the high seeds to have cleared his first-round hurdle on Tuesday, admitted he was a little nervous at the start of his match against Indian teenager Karan Rastogi. 

?I wasn?t surprised the way he (Rastogi) started. Most talented young guys like him come out relaxed and play well. I changed my game a bit and played solid in the second set,? Bjorkman said after his 6-4, 6-0 victory. 

Bjorkman felt Rastogi definitely has good talent. ?His two-handed backhand is very good, he plays it almost like a Swede. At 18, he?s surely better than what I was at that age.? 

Bjorkman said Rastogi is lucky as he has Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi to guide him. 

?If he is willing to learn and take their advice, he can surely develop into a very good player.?

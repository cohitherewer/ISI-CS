The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Monday, October 24, 2005 

 Berlin: Former Germany captain Lothar Matthaeus has been invited by Fifa to draw the World Cup final groups in Leipzig on December 9, he told a German newspaper at the weekend. ?It?s a great honour for me,? Matthaeus, who had a record 150 caps, said. 

 Matthaeus, 44, is Hungary?s coach. He was bypassed for the Germany job in 2004 that later went to Juergen Klinsmann, a former Germany teammate and rival.

 ?We proposed Lothar to Fifa,? said Germany?s 2006 organising committee vice-president Wolfgang Niersbach. 

 London: England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson, cyclist Lance Armstrong and TV chef Jamie Oliver have been named among 10 ?Men of the Decade? by a news magazine.

 Each one listed represents a different area of expertise, including sport, music and design.

 The list was compiled by a panel of experts of a men?s health magazine to celebrate its 10th anniversary.

 Others on the list are philosopher Homer Simpson, activist Bob Geldof, writer Ian McEwan and musician Damon Albarn. Designer Sir Paul Smith, iPod creator Jonathan Ive and scientist Craig Venter complete the list. 

 London: Captain Thierry Henry has apologised to Arsenal?s supporters for the extraordinary penalty miss during the 1-0 home win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday.

 ?I just want to apologise to all the Arsenal fans because it wasn?t the right thing to do,? Henry told BBC TV. ?Next time I will take all the penalties.?

 Robert Pires, who had already converted one spot kick, fluffed his attempt to touch a second into the path of fellow-Frenchman Henry, prompting chaotic scenes that ended with referee Mike Riley awarding City a free kick. In the aftermath, it was unclear whether Riley believed Pires had touched the ball twice or that the ball had not travelled through its circumference as required.

 Hong Kong: India won the Hong Kong International Sixes tournament defeating the West Indies by four wickets in the final on Sunday.

 India reached the victory target of 72 runs for loss of two wickets with the help of former India player Robin Singh, who hit 34 off 15 balls. Hrishikesh Kanitkar made the last four runs required for victory.

 England, champions of the past two years, defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets in the play-off for third place. 

 Istanbul: Italian Honda rider Marco Melandri won his first MotoGP victory at the new Istanbul Park circuit on Sunday, with a convincing defeat of 2005 world champion Valentino Rossi.

 The 23-year-old led off for the first of 22 laps and was headed for only two laps by his teammate Sete Gibernau until the Spaniard ran off the track briefly.

 Rossi moved into second place after eight laps, about one second behind Melandri, but could not match his younger compatriot?s pace and Melandri gradually stretched away to win by 1.513 seconds. 

 Paris: World champion Sebastien Loeb, driving a Citroen, completed a clean sweep of stages to clinch his first victory in Corsica on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sasi notches up third victory

 Surya outwitted Alexandra Kosteniuk 

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran raised visions of a decent finish after a disastrous start after Ashot Anastasian of Armenia in the seventh round of the Aeroflot Open tournament here on Monday. 

After managing just half a point from his first three matches, the Indian No. 2 has made a remarkable comeback garnering 3.5 points in the last four rounds. 

A top-three finish looks extremely difficult for the Indians as Russian Andrei Kharlov, continuing his career-best performance, put it across compatriot Vladimir Malakhov and raced to 6 points from seven rounds. 

With just two rounds to go, Kharlov regained sole lead and is now followed by Emil Sutovsky of Israel and Sergey Volkov of Russia (both on 5.5). 

A pack of five players, including second seed Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, is on 5 while a bunch of 13 is next in line with 4.5 each. 

Sasikiran (4) is currently in the joint 22nd spot and meets Chinese Bu Xiangzhi in the penultimate round. 

National champion and Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly finally recorded his first victory defeating former world women?s championship finalist Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia. 

Surya moved to 3.5 and can still figure in the prize-list provided he does well in the next two games. 

There seems little hope for GM Sandipan Chanda after he once again split the point, this time with Russian Dmitry Jakovenko. With a tally of just 2.5 following five draws and two losses, Sandipan will be happy if he does not go win-less in the strongest Open tournament of the world. 

In the ?A2? section, GM Tejas Bakre conceded his second straight loss.He was beaten by Russia?s Oleg Aleshin who had white. 

IM S. Kidambi was quite impressive in his victory over Guliev Logman of Azerbaijan. So were young guns Parimarjan Negi and Tania Sachdev, who cruised past Ernesto Romero Fernandez of Spain and Weida Zhang of China, respectively. 

Eesha Karavade, the other Indian in the fray, could not hold her position together in tense moments and went down to Olav Sepp of Estonia. 

The lead in this section is currently shared by Arsen Yegiazarian of Armenia, Sergey Zagerbelny of Uzbekistan, Russians Vladimir Potkin and Denis Khismatullin (5.5 each). 

In the B group, IM Dinesh Kumar Sharma drew his eighth round game with Sofya Zigangirova of Kazakhstan to move to 5 points. 

Sasikiran was simply the much better player against Anastasian who played the black side of a Nimzo Indian defence. Returning to his old love ? Leningrad Variation ? Sasikiran ensured a bloody battle first and then simply outplayed Anastanisan in the middle game with fine strategic manoeuvres leading to wild complexities. 

The indian sacrificed an exchange on the 26th move and slowly tightened the noose to romp home in another 10 moves. 

Kharlov, who is running away with the first prize, won in 37 moves with white against Malakhov. A couple of draws will be enough for him to seal the crown. (PTI)

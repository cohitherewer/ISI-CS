 Mahindra hold Dempo

Margao: Dempo wasted a number of opportunities in the second half to drop points as they settled for a goalless draw against Mahindra United in the 17th round of the National Football League on Thursday. 

Despite the draw at the Nehru Stadium, Dempo consolidated their position at the top of the table with 35 points from 17 matches while Mahindra remained on fifth place with 25 points. 

Confined to midfield in the first half, Dempo had the first clear chance to score when Melvin Rodrigues sent a long pass to Clifford Miranda from left. However, the latter released the ball to an unmarked Isfaq Ahmed inside the box, whose shot went wide off target. 

Mahindra, who enjoyed the edge in the midfield with the ball possession in the first half, lacked thrust to trouble the rival defence. 

They had the best chance in the 32nd minute but Flavio Rodrigues, on receiving pass from Steve Dias, shot over.

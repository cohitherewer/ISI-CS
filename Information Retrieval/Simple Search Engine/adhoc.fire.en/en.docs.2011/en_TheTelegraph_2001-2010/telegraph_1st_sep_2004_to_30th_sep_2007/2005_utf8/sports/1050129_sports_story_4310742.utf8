 Hamilton ?loses? 4th ODI

Wellington: The fourth one-day International between New Zealand and Australia, scheduled in Hamilton on March 2, will be transferred to another venue because of concern over the quality of the pitch. 

An alternative venue, however, has not yet been decided, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said on Friday. 

Hamilton?s Westpac Park hosted a limited overs tsunami fund-raiser between New Zealand XI and a World XI on Wednesday which lasted only 36 overs and saw 16 wickets fall for 164 runs. 

New Zealand scored 83 for six in reply to the World XI?s 81 in the 50-overs-a-side match. 

Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who captained the World XI, said the recently laid Hamilton pitch was not of international standard. 

?I think the authorities will probably move the (Australian) game knowing the way the pitch played,? Warne had said after that game. ?I think the pitch was substandard.? 

The Hamilton ODI is likely to be shifted to Auckland, Wellington or Christchurch, which are already due to host matches in the series. (AP)

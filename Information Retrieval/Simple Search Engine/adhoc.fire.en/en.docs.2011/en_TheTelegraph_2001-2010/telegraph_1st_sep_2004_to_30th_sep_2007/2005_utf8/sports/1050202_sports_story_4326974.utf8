 Surgery puts Murali out

Colombo:Muttiah Muralidharan will be sidelined from cricket for another two months following a second operation on his right shoulder in five months. Surgeon David Young operated on Muralidharan in Melbourne, said on Tuesday. 

?There has been a tear in his muscle. This (operation) is to basically treat him for that. This will keep him out of cricket for eight weeks,? Muralidharan?s manager Kushil Gunasekera said. 

Young had also operated on the bowler in August to treat a lesion that had caused a build-up of fluid around the nerves in his right shoulder. That surgery kept Muralidharan out of cricket until last month when he played in an Asian XI against a World XI in a tsunami fund-raiser. He then played in three unofficial charity ties for the World XI against New Zealand. (AFP)

 Inzamam has his way

Islamabad: Inzamam-ul Haq may give the impression of being soft in his approach but the Pakistan captain stuck to his guns recently and refused to appear in a commercial until the Pakistan Cricket Board agreed to compensate him amply. 

Inzamam was asked by the PCB to appear in a commercial for Pepsi, the official sponsor of the Pakistan team which has a 15-year contract with the Board. 

But the batsman refused to toe the line, stating that he was contracted to the Board and not the multinational cola giants. 

The commercial in question also featured PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, according to a report in a daily. 

Inzamams contention was simple that he was a contracted player of the Board and if they wanted him to appear in a new advertising campaign, they should pay him for his services and time, a PCB source was quoted as saying by the daily newspaper. 

Eventually after going through the contract and failing to convince him, the Board then agreed to pay him half a million rupees from its own coffers to appear in the advertising campaign, the source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pollock pulls out, Nel doubtful 

Johannesburg: South Africa allrounder Shaun Pollock has withdrawn from Friday?s opening one-day International against Zimbabwe with an ankle injury. 

Pace bowler Andre Nel, who also played in the 4-1 series win over England, is doubtful because of a hamstring injury. 

However, captain Graeme Smith confirmed he would play on Friday despite a persistent ankle injury. 

?The ankle?s pretty sore at the moment and I need to have cortisone injections. We?re struggling to work out exactly what the problem is, but it?s pretty much certain that I?ll play in all three matches in the series,? he said.

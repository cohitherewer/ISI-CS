 Ronaldo left out of squad

Rio de Janeiro: For a player who has become used to having things entirely his own way, Ronaldo has been given a very rude awakening by the decision to leave him out of the World Cup qualifier against Argentina. 

The message from the Brazil hierarchy appears to be that he is no longer untouchable. Ronaldo asked to be excused from the Confederations Cup in the second half of June because, he felt, he needed a rest. But the Real Madrid striker got more than he bargained for. 

The Brazilian Football Confederation, which insisted it wanted a full-strength squad at the competition, also left him out of the World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Argentina. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Australian Open richer by $150000

 - Rod Laver arena to be upgraded, night session added 

 Mark Philippoussis may get a wildcard 

Melbourne: Tennis Australia on Tuesday announced an increase in the prize money at next years Australian Open that will see the mens and womens champions each receive $905,000. 

The total prize pool at the January 16-29 tournament will be $14.5 million for the first Grand Slam of 2006 at Melbourne Park, an increase of about $150,000 from this year. 

Tournament officials also announced a $4.5 million refurbishment to the main Rod Laver arena that will see the upgrading of all 15,000 seats and the construction of a new entrance to the stadium. 

In January, the mens final between Lleyton Hewitt and Marat Safin ? won by Safin ? drew the highest television ratings in Australia since the 2000 Sydney Olympics ? 4.87 million viewers. 

The mens final will again be held on Sunday night, January 29 next year. Officials will also add a night session to the middle Sunday ? January 22 ? for the first time. 

The 2005 tournament attracted a record 5,43,873 spectators ? an increase of 20,000 on 2004 ? including 60,669 on the first Saturday. 

Serena Williams, the defending womens champion, defeated fellow American Lindsay Davenport in a three-set final this year. 

Mark Philippoussis, meanwhile, is almost certain to gain a wildcard to next years Australian Open despite a slump in form, officials said on Tuesday. Melbourne-raised Philippoussis has dropped to a world ranking of 203 after a year in which he has only won seven matches. 

But Australian Open chief executive Paul McNamee said there was a compelling case to include him in the first Grand Slam of the year. 

Hes done a lot for this tournament, McNamee said at the launch of the 2006 Australian Open. 

We havent sat down and discussed it yet but honestly he brings a pretty strong case from a marketing perspective. 

Mark is big at night and hes a bona fide star ? theres no doubt about that. Hes got a long history and people are very interested in what hes doing on and off the court. 

As it stands, Mark would be a walk-up start for a wildcard, he added.

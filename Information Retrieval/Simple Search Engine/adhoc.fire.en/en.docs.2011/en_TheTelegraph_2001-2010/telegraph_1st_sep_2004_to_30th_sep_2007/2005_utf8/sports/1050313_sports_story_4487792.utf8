The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Akmal, Razzaq script a miracle act

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Anil Kumble celebrates after dismissing Mohammed Sami for his 450th Test wicket on Saturday 

Chandigarh: When Danish Kaneria had suggested Friday evening that Pakistan were aiming for a lead around 200, some of the mediamen tried to scoff at his remark. With only 53 ahead, Pakistan were then almost staring at defeat and being written off. 

Despite enjoying the upperhand for most of the first four days, India surrendered the advantage through some unimaginative bowling and the dour approach of Abdul Razzaq and Kamran Akmal. The seventh wicket pair not only stitched together a record 184 runs but also helped the visitors regain the psychological advantage for the rest of the series. 

The first match of the TVS Series was destined to be a draw once Pakistan saw through the first hour after lunch on the final day. Inzamam-ul Haq?s declaration, leaving India to get 292 in 25 overs, must have also piled on the embarrassment. The underdogs had suddenly begun to call the shots. 

The smiles were back on the face of Bob Woolmer. Someone held out a placard, ?India?s wounded tigers?, in the stands. It remains to be seen how they go for the kill at Eden Gardens. 

In the end, whereas the favourites were in awe of what hit them, the underdogs had the air of men who had been waiting for this moment with the impatience of children at the back of a queue for ice cream. 

How much hard Sourav may try to repair the damage by saying ?Calcutta will be a new game?, the truth remains that India have failed to deliver the knockout punch when it mattered and the Pakistanis are a rejuvenated lot. 

A relaxed Woolmer had this to say: ?In 1971 during their tour of England, Pakistan played Kent. Just try and look through that scoreboard?? In those soft-spoken words could lie his answer to the detractors who have been clamouring for his head. 

This tour has already promised to throw up future stars for Pakistan, youngsters who have the fire in their belly to make it big ? Asim Kamal, Danish Kaneria, Akmal? the list may grow before the series ends. 

The storyline could have been different had VVS Laxman managed to get his fingers to that outside edge of Akmal or a desperate Sourav clung on to that ballooning hit from Razzaq. That was not to be and Pakistan survived. 

That in no way should take away the credit from Man-of-the-Match Akmal and Razzaq. They batted with conviction and showed the resolve, which their top-order lacked. As Akmal took the attack to the opposition, his senior partner was content playing second fiddle. 

Akmal has always proved a handful in the lower-order and has even opened the batting in the one-dayers. The 23-year-old showed amazing determination during his innings of 109 from 154 balls. 

His maiden hundred, which included 16 fours, was a performance that could herald a new dawn for the visitors on this tour. In the process, he became the second Pakistan wicketkeeper after Imtiaz Ahmed to get a century in India. 

Razzaq allowed Akmal to flourish. His patient 71, which came off 260 balls, was spent in mostly guiding the youngster. Razzaq, though, did not wish to take much credit. ?He was marvellous? We were just determined to play it session by session,? Razzaq said. 

The Indians struggled on a pitch that was bereft of bounce and movement. Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan appeared directionless and unwilling to bend their back a bit more. The new ball was wasted and from then it hardly seemed like India would pull it through. 

Only Lakshmipathy Balaji got some reverse swing but little bounce. The Tamil Nadu pacer finished with nine wickets in his comeback match. 

Anil Kumble bowled long spells but often strayed down the leg side in his attempt to utilise the footmarks. An amazing reflex action caught and bowled to dismiss Mohammed Sami helped him get to his 450th wicket. Only Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralidharan, Courtney Walsh and Glenn McGrath remain ahead. Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir never went for the improbable after Pakistan had recorded their best of 496 for nine. 

 As Sourav remarked later, three of the last four Tests 

 in Mohali have ended in draws and it?s time for the Punjab 

 Cricket Association to do some rethinking.

 the 450 CLUB

 Kumbles eight in Mohali 

 got him to 450 Test wickets.

 The following have got 450 and more Test wickets:

 Shane Warne 568 (121 matches)

 Muttiah Muralidharan 532 (91)

 Courtney Walsh 519 (132)

 Glenn McGrath 487 (107)

 Anil Kumble 450 (93)

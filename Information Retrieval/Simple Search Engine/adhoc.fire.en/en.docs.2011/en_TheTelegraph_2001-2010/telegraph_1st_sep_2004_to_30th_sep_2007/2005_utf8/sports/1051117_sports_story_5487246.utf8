The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Masters Cup sans the stars

 NEIL HARMAN IN SHANGHAI 

 One hopes Roddick 

 doesnt go the Rafter way 

 A wager was struck between two 

 writers on Tuesday, in which the one who has travelled the 

 circuit for 40 years invested in his belief that, at the 

 present degenerative rate, Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick 

 will not be competing at the top of the game in five years. 

 If his forecast bears fruit, then the sport will have torn 

 itself apart from inside.

 The apparently effortless brilliance 

 of Roger Federer aside, who at the top of tennis in its 

 present form of violence ? to use Andre Agassis description 

 ? more vividly represents the dynamism and electricity that 

 the sport is so desperate to sell to the worlds youth 

 than these titans of Spain and the US?

 And yet the sport is happy to 

 flog them on a diet of disparate objectives, self-interest 

 and a schedule that has borne no relation to common sense 

 for years.

 For the third event in succession 

 for which he was scheduled, Nadal, 19, has had to bail out 

 ? he travelled to one to say sorry, would have done so at 

 the second had they not turned him down and was here, at 

 the third, ready to play before further injuries surfaced.

 Everyone accepts that the four 

 Grand Slam tournaments are the cr?me de la cr?me, the prizes 

 coveted above all else.

 The Davis Cup and Fed Cup, bedrocks 

 of the International Tennis Federation and its remit of 

 spreading tennis the length and breadth of the globe, are, 

 though, in need of a remodelling that more accurately reflects 

 their unique stature.

 Who in their right mind should 

 put up with a schedule that starts the year with a Grand 

 Slam in Australia, sends players scuttling to either Europe 

 or the US, has three Masters Series mens tournaments 

 within five weeks on clay with the French Open in close 

 pursuit, before giving everyone only two weeks on grass 

 before Wimbledon, the prince of championships?

 Then it is five weeks on bone-jarring 

 American hard courts in unbearable humidity before the US 

 Open rears its head with its malfunctioning, TV-dominated 

 scheduling.

 It is only four years ago that 

 Pat Rafter of Australia, whose game was based on flowing 

 athleticism, gave up the unequal struggle at the age of 

 28 and settled for more golf and time with his young family.

 We can but hope that such a situation 

 is distant for Nadal and Roddick, though I recall walking 

 through Heathrow customs on the way home from the Great 

 Britain Davis Cup tie in Switzerland in September, straight 

 into Roddick, who was stopping over having played for more 

 than four hours in a final rubber against Olivier Rochus 

 of Belgium, a match that drew hardly a note anywhere else 

 in the world.

 He said he had never felt so mentally 

 and physically exhausted and who really cared?

 We are attending a Masters Cup 

 with very few masters and what more alarming wake-up call 

 does tennis want than that?

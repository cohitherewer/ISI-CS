 No change in ICC stand

Dubai: Maintaining its apolitical stand on Zimbabwe, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has said tours to the African country would continue to take place as per the future tours programme unless a legislation was passed by the visiting country against it. 

Responding to British foreign secretary Jack Straws letter, which called upon ICC to review its stand vis-?-vis Zimbabwe, ICC president Ehsan Mani outlined the ICCs position and explained the rationale behind this. 

Our members accept and respect that where a national government prevents its national cricket team from fulfilling a touring commitment, which will usually be done through legislation, Mani said in a statement.

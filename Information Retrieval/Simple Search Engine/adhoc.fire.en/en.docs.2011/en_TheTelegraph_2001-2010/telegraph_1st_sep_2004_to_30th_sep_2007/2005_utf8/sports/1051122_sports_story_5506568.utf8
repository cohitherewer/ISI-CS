 England on backfoot

 - 23rd hundred puts Inzy level with Miandad 

 Inzamam-ul Haq after his century on Monday 

Faisalabad: Inzamam-ul Haq scored a record-equalling 23rd century as Pakistan made 462 before reducing England to 113 for three at close of play on the second day of the second Test on Monday. Ian Bell (36) and Kevin Pietersen (4) were at the crease when bad light forced play to be called off early. 

The England innings was suspended for nine minutes when a gas cylinder exploded in front of a packed stand. A policeman standing on the edge of the ground suffered minor injuries. 

England were made to struggle early on when Rana Naved forced Andrew Strauss (12) to play on to his stumps. 

The pace bowler struck again in his next over, uprooting captain Michael Vaughans middle stump with a yorker length ball that dipped in late to leave England on 39 for two. 

Mohammed Sami struck just before close when Marcus Trescothick was caught behind for 48. 

Earlier, Inzamam and Shahid Afridi (92) were in imperious form as Pakistan resumed on 300 for four, putting on 145 for the fifth wicket. 

The 35-year-old captain made 109, including 13 fours, to equal Javed Miandad for most Test hundreds by a Pakistani. 

Pakistan, who were 446 for eight at lunch, lost Kamran Akmal first ball after lunch. He made 41 from 78 balls. Next over Shoaib Akhtar, after remaining scoreless for 25 balls opened his account with a straight six and than clouted another to the mid-wicket boundary before holing out to long-on.

 Nepal U-19 to play 2 ties in Jharkhand

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Nepal will play two practice matches in Jharkhand before travelling to Sri Lanka for the Under-19 World Cup from February 5 to 19. 

I recently met the Nepal association president who had come to Ranchi for some family engagements, JSCA president Amitabh Choudhary said over phone. He was inquiring whether some practice games could be organised for the under-19 Nepal team. I agreed. 

Dates and opponents will be decided later, but the matches will be held in Ranchi and Jamshedpur.

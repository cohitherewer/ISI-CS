New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa has tipped a home challenger to win the Hero Honda Indian Open Golf Championship and named compatriot Arjun Atwal as his personal favourite for the title at the $ 300,000 Asian Tour event starting here on Thursday. 

I am sure this time its going to be an Indian. I think Atwal starts as the favourite, he is in good form. There are lots of people to pick from, but my favourite is Atwal, Randhawa said at the Delhi Golf Club. 

The last time an Indian won the prestigious event, which has been part of the Asian Tour since 1999, was in 2002 when Vijay Kumar etched his name on the trophy. 

Since 1964, the inaugural year of the Open, only six Indians have laid their hands on the trophy. 

Ali Sher was the first to do so in 1991 and he repeated the act two years later before Firoz Ali, Atwal and Randhawa made it an Indian hattrick from 1998-2000. 

On his own chances, Randhawa said: It is going to be a tough challenge. 

It is a state of the mind. Sometimes the best players go on to win the tournament, sometimes you play well and still lose. So it doesnt matter who you are playing with. 

Playing golf every week throughout the season is a challenge in itself, said the former champion. 

It has been an eventful year for Indian golf, with Atwal finishing in the top-10 four times on the USPGA Tour, Randhawa ranking third on the Asian Tour money list and Shiv Kapur securing next years card with a 47th-place finish in his rookie season. 

Randhawa also made it to the World Golf Championship in San Francisco earlier this month. 

Tiger Woods emerged winner, but for Randhawa, teeing off in elite company was in itself a great experience. 

To play alongside the likes of John Daly felt great. I was particularly amazed by the crowd management there, said the Arjuna Awardee. 

There would have been at least 10,000 people and the noise they make, it was nerve-wracking. I really enjoyed it, hopefully one day an Indian wins it. 

Randhawa would be part of the Indian team to take part in the World Cup finals to be held in Algarve (Portugal) from November 17 to 20. 

This is the first time an Indian team has earned the right to play in the finals. 

The direct entry was unexpected but well deserved. And once he became eligible, Randhawa had not hesitation in choosing Atwal as his partner. 

You want the best golfers playing the event. There is no point in having a World Cup with amateurs. It is best to go by world rankings, said Randhawa. 

Son of an army officer, Randhawas passion includes guns and bikes. 

I shoot to relax, said the 33-year-old. No wonder Olympic silver-medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore is a close friend of Randhawas.

 I am not a perfect fielder: Kaif

 Kaif feels Chappell is a very relaxed man 

Bangalore: Middle-order batsman Mohammed Kaif, an exceptional fielder best known for his acrobatic skills, says he is not a perfect fielder and there are areas to improve upon. 

I am happy with the way I have been fielding for my country in saving a few runs and in catching. But this is not a game where one cant be a perfect fielder, batsman or player. There are always areas to improve, the 24-year-old Uttar Pradesh player said. 

Kaif, who has played seven Tests and 87 ODIs, said he was not exerting undue pressure on himself in his bid to become a regular member of the Test side. 

I am just focusing to my game, he said. When I get an opportunity, I want do well and score runs... Rather than thinking of getting selected and playing for the final eleven... So, when an opportunity comes, I want to grab it and do well. 

One of the high points of his career is the magnificent, unbeaten 87 in the 2002 Natwest Series final in England as India successfully chased 326 for victory. 

Kaif said Sachin Tendulkar, would be missed in the coming tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

He (Sachin) will be definitely missed; thats understandable. The kind of record (that he has) says it all, he said but expressed happiness that the batting maestro is sharing his wealth of experience with youngsters. 

On his brief interaction with new coach Greg Chappell, Kaif said the 56-year-old former Australian captain came across as a very positive, nice, relaxed and thoughtful man. 

Chappell stressed on the mental toughness. I am looking forward to chatting up with him on my batting.

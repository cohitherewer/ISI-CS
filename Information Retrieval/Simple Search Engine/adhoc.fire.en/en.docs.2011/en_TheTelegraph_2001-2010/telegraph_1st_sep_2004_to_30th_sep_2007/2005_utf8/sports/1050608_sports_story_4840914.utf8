 Golden hopes dashed by Sheldon Silver 

New York: A man named Silver has likely ended any hope that Olympians will compete for gold in New York in 2012. 

Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno, two of three members of the New York State Public Authorities Control Board, abstained in a vote on Monday to approve $300 million in funding for a proposed $2.2 billion Olympic Stadium. 

New York governor George Pataki cast his vote in favour of the project, but unanimous approval was needed for the stadium financing, so assembly speaker Silver and Senate majority leader Brunos inaction crushed the Olympic dream. 

This plan is at best premature, Silver said. 

The International Olympic Committee gathers July 6 in Singapore to choose a 2012 Games host among finalists Paris, London, Moscow, Madrid and New York. 

A spokesman for the bid group said the Big Apple bid would not be withdrawn before the IOC vote, as New York mayor Michael Bloomberg had threatened. 

Rejection of the stadium will seriously damage our chances at winning the 2012 Games, Bloomberg said. 

Without a main stadium and even a backup plan for an alternate site, New Yorks Olympic dream is looks to be dead on arrival in Singapore ? even if Pataki refuses to surrender and officials follow through with a wounded bid effort. 

We will talk to the mayor and Olympic officials to see where we go from here, Pataki said. Im not going to speculate what the next step will be. Its just very disappointing. 

The vote came ten hours after the IOC issued a generally favourable evaluation of New Yorks chances to win the 2012 Games as part of a report on all the candidates. 

NYC2012 executive director Jay Kriegel called silvers timing inexplicable and terribly damaging. The vote was delayed three times before coming on Monday. 

For weeks, the speaker has said New York couldnt win the Olympics so he didnt need to approve the stadium, Kriegel said. 

In an extraordinary irony, just when the IOC made clear New York has an exceptional bid and can win, the speaker announced his opposition. 

Bruno showed some willingness to support the project if the IOC assured New York the Olympics. But Silver said he would not back the stadium project even if New York was awarded the 2012 Games by the IOC. 

Silver was concerned the shops and offices that would be part of the project would hinder redevelopment efforts at the nearby site of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks, an area Silver represents. 

Am I supposed to turn my back on Lower Manhattan as it struggles to recover? silver said. 

Pataki and Bloomberg spent the weekend trying to rally support from Silver for the stadium, lynchpin of a planned $7.5 billion renovation project above Manhattans west-side rail yards. 

The 2012 Summer Games are being used as a shield to hide another goal ? to shift the financial and business capital of the world out of Lower Manhattan and over to the west side, Silver said. (AFP)

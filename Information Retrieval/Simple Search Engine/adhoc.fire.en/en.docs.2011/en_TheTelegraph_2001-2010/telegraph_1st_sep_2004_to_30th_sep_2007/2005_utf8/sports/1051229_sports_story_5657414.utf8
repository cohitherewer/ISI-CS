 Wild card for Prakash 

Chennai: Davis Cupper Prakash Amritraj was on Wednesday given a singles main draw wild card at the Chennai Open to be played here from Monday to January 8. 

It is third time in a row that Amritraj has been given the wild card for the $ 385,000 prize money event, according to a release from the organisers. 

This is an exciting time for me. I am looking forward to playing in the Chennai Open and would like to thank the organisers of the tournament for giving me an opportunity to start the season by playing in my fathers hometown against some of the top performers on the Tour, Amritraj said. 

Amritraj, who reached the pre-quarters in 2004, lost in the first round last year. 

The tournament has already suffered a big blow with the withdrawal of French Open champion Rafael Nadal

 Shabbir may join squad for last 2 ODIs

Karachi: Shabbir Ahmed may join the Pakistan squad for the last two ODIs in India. 

A national selector confirmed that the selection committee had been impressed with the fitness of Shabbir who had been bothered by knee injuries. 

During the last week, he played three domestic matches and ?showed considerable improvement,? the selector said. ?We have not got any request from the team management for Shabbir so far. But considering the upcoming tour of the West Indies (in June), we are thinking of flying Shabbir (to India) so that he gets some international cricket,? he added. 

According to arrangement between the two boards, a one-day squad cannot comprise more than 16 players. Pakistan already have a squad of 16. 

The decision on which player would return home to accommodate Shabbir will be taken in consultation with the team management and after analysing the trend of the ODI series. (PTI)

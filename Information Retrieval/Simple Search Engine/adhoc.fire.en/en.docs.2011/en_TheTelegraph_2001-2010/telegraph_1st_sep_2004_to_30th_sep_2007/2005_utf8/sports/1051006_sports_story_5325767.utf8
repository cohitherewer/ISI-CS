 Puerta denies testing positive 

London/Tokyo: Argentinas Mariano Puerta denied a report on Wednesday that he had taken a banned drug and tested positive at this years French Open where he reached the singles final. 

Im really angry, Ive started investigations with my lawyers. This is a very delicate subject, theres no truth in it, said Puerta, who faces a life ban if guilty after failing a doping test two years ago. 

Its news to me, Puerta said over telephone from Tokyo. In my opinion, its strange because nobody from the ATP or ITF has called me. 

Puerta, ranked 10th in the world and top seed at the Japan Open, had just won his second round match in the tournament in Tokyo 6-3, 6-4 against Eric Taino of the US. He is pushing for a place in the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai. 

He said it came like a bombshell when informed of Wednesdays report in a French sports newspaper. Traces of a stimulant called etilefrine were found in a urine sample from Puerta taken after his French Open final defeat by Spains Rafael Nadal, the paper said. 

Its crazy, added Puerta, who was suspended for nine months after testing positive for the banned substance clenbuterol in 2003. 

The French Open organisers were unavailable for immediate comment.

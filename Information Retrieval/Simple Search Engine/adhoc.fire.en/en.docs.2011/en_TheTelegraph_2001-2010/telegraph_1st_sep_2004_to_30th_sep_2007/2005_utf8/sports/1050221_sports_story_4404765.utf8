The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak arrival now on February 28

 - Calcutta Test confirmed from March 16 

 Thiruvananthapuram: The Pakistan team will arrive on February 28 for a 50-day tour of India comprising three Tests and six-one-dayers, it was announced here on Sunday. 

The announcement, made by the BCCI secretary S.K. Nair, means the start of the tour has been delayed by four days as an earlier programme had slated the arrival of the Pakistan side for February 24. 

According to the itinerary, Mohali will host the first Test (March 8-12), Calcutta the second (March 16-20) and Bangalore the third and final Test (March 24-28). 

The first one-dayer will be played April 2 in Kochi while the last in New Delhi on April 17. 

[The itinerary tallies with what The Telegraph had reported on Sunday, except one minor change ? that the Bangalore Test begins on March 24, and not March 25.] 

Nair said the itinerary was finalised after the Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed the tour programme, put forward by the BCCI. ?The Pakistan Cricket Board has confirmed the tour programme as suggested by us,? he said. 

The visitors, touring the country for a full series after a gap of six years, would begin their tour with a three-day warm up match against the Board President?s XI at Dharamsala on March 3. 

Nair confirmed that Ahmedabad would host the fourth one-day International. The Gujarat city was in the centre of controversy after Pakistan refused to play there, leading to a delay in finalising of the itinerary. 

But with Pakistan giving the nod to play an additional sixth one-day International in Ahmedabad on Friday, decks were cleared for the final tour programme to be put in place. 

Nair expressed hope that the series would further strengthen the ties between the two countries. ?This is an event eagerly awaited by cricket lovers in both the countries. We are sure that the series is going to be quite exciting for the cricket loving public. (PTI)

 Seeding will boost our chances: Eriksson

HENRY WINTER

 Eriksson 

Englands World Cup prospects, as well as their self-belief, have been bolstered when they were seeded second only to Brazil for next summers tournament. 

I have always been very confident we can win the World Cup, said a delighted Sven-Goran Eriksson, Englands head coach, after Fifa named England among the World Cup seeds, ensuring they will avoid Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Mexico, Italy, Spain and France in the group stages. 

This is a big boost, but when the tournament starts we must show on the pitch why we have been seeded, Eriksson said. 

There are many very good sides that are going to Germany but I dont think that too many will want to face England. 

England would do well to be pitted against Switzerland, Togo and Dwight Yorkes Trinidad and Tobago when the draw is made in Leipzig on Friday, but after such a boost to their confidence, they would probably take in their stride the worst-case scenario of being in a group with The Netherlands, Australia and South Korea. 

Qualification for the knock-out stages, eased by Tuesdays news, should also secure England a seeding at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, assuming that they qualify and their world ranking does not slip markedly. 

England were also informed on Tuesday that the winners next summer will receive ?12 million from Fifa, out of which the Football Association (FA) have promised to pay David Beckham and his colleagues ?5 million, with Eriksson himself on a reported ?1 million bonus. 

Every team are guaranteed ?3 million from their group-stage games, while Fifa will give each of the 32 nations ?500,000 for preparations, plus business-class tickets and ?220 per day, per person for accommodation. 

Most of Englands interest at Fridays draw will focus on the second European team in their group. As well as Marco van Bastens dangerous Dutch side, they could face opponents as tough as the Czech Republic or Portugal. 

Andriy Shevchenkos Ukraine, Croatia, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland are also possible foes for England. Whoever it is, there will be Premiership sub-plots all over the pitch. Its the World Cup so you know you have to meet some very good teams, Eriksson said. 

Lurking in the pot with the fired-up Australians and Togo are Ghana, Angola, Ivory Coast, Tunisia, Equador, and Paraguay. As well as the nimble Koreans and Trinidad and Tobago, the fourth pot includes Iran, Japan, the US, Saudi Arabia, and Costa Rica. The groups top two qualify for the knock-out phase. 

England were expected to be seeded, but their presence at No.2 was surprising. The criteria used by Fifa for establishing their eight seeds clearly favoured England as it counted current world rankings plus performances in the past two World Cups.

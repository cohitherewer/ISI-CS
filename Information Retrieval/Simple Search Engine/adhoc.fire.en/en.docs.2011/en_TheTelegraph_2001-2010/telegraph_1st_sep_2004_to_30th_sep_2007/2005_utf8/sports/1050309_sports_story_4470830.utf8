 We should have played 2 spinners: Pataudi

Mohali: Former Indian skipper Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi was critical of team management?s choice to play three medium-pacers in the first cricket Test against Pakistan at the PCA Stadium on Tuesday. 

?I don?t think it is a green wicket. Even though India is in a good position they should have opted for two spinners,? remarked Pataudi making a rare appearance in a cricket stadium after a long time. 

India chose to go with the pace trio of Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan and Lakshmipathy Balaji in the game with Anil Kumble playing as the lone spinner. Put into bat, Pakistan were all out for 312 on the first day of the match. 

?Tiger? as Pataudi is known, felt India would have had to pay dearly if this choice of bowlers was made against a better opposition. 

?Against top opponents, India would have repented the choice. The wicket is already keeping low. 

?Ideally, India should have gone with five bowlers in the game. But I don?t think Sourav likes to opt for five specialist bowlers in the line-up. The wicket, if anything, should help the spinners from the third day onwards,? said Pataudi. 

India made a rare history in choosing three seamers and a lone spinner in their bowling line-up. There have been occasions when India have played just one spinner but it has been because of injury. 

Pataudi still felt India should be able to prevail over Pakistan as it is a better Test team and has wealth of experience. ?India is presently stronger than Pakistan in Tests and it is because it is more experienced. Pakistan has good youngsters but they lack the experience.?He also welcomed the return of Sachin Tendulkar into the Test fold and had no doubt the experienced middle order batsman had recovered from the tennis elbow injury.

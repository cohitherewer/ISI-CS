Madrid: Villarreal remained on course for their first ever Champions League place after a hattrick from Diego Forlan earned them a 3-3 draw in an action-packed game against new champions Barcelona on Sunday. 

The result kept Manuel Pellegrinis side in third place in the table, a point ahead of Real Betis, who won 3-2 at home to Real Zaragoza on Saturday, and two clear of Sevilla who were held to a 0-0 draw at Getafe. 

With Barcelona fans in party mood after their team wrapped up their first league title in six seasons last week, the two sides responded with by providing top-quality entertainment at the Nou Camp. 

Former Manchester United striker Forlan put Villarreal ahead in the 17th minute when he curled a superbly struck shot beyond reserve keeper Albert Jorquera and into the top corner. 

Barcelona had a chance to level seven minutes later when Samuel Eto was brought down in the area by Villarreal defender Quique Alvarez, but the Cameroon strikers spot kick hit the underside of the bar and bounced back into play. 

Forlan made no mistake, however, when he was given the penalty-taking duties after Jose Mari had been fouled in the area by centre-back Oleguer Presas just before the half hour. 

The Catalans roared back with two goals in four minutes, Ronaldinho heading in from six metres and Ludovic Giuly hooking in from point-blank range after his overhead kick had been blocked by former Barcelona keeper Pepe Reina. 

Giuly then put the home side in front three minutes into the second half when he cracked in an acutely angled volley, but it only sparked a fierce response from the visitors who proceeded to flood forward into attack. 

Forlan completed his hattrick and took his tally for the season to 23 ?one less than the Primera Ligas leading scorer Eto ? when he lobbed the ball over Jorquera and into the net after a ricochet had fallen to him on the edge of the area. 

The biggest cheers of the night, though, came when Brazilian defender Edmilson, Spain midfielder Gabri and Swedish striker Henrik Larsson came on as substitutes for Barcelona after recovering from serious knee injuries that had kept them out for most of the season. 

At the other end of the table, Real Mallorca gave themselves renewed hope of survival when they climbed out of the relegation zone for the first time in eight months thanks to a 3-0 win at Deportivo Coruna on Sunday. 

Japan striker Yoshito Okubo was in inspirational form for the islanders, setting up first-half goals for Franciso Javier Farinos and Juan Arango with superb crosses from the right and added one of his own midway through the second. 

Hector Cupers side moved a point clear of Levante, who dropped into the relegation zone for the first time this season and with just one game left after drawing 0-0 at home to city rivals Valencia. 

The battle to avoid joining relegated Numancia and Albacete in the second division will now go down to the wire with Mallorca hosting Real Betis and Levante travelling to Villarreal in the final games of the season. 

A goal from Antonio Cassano secured Romas top-flight survival on Sunday after their 1-0 win over Atalanta sent the Bergamo club down to Serie B, add reports from Milan. 

Juventus, crowned champions on Friday after their sole rivals AC Milan were held to a 3-3 draw at home to Palermo, had little to play for and were held to a 2-2 draw at Livorno. 

After Pavel Nedved had put Juventus ahead in the 10th minute, goals from Igor Protti and Cristiano Lucarelli gave Livorno the advantage before David Trezeguets 66th minute goal earned Juventus a point. 

The travelling 2,500 Juventus fans celebrated throughout the match but the main party for the scudetto was expected to take place in Turin where fans were waiting for the team to return by air. 

With the title race wrapped up in advance of the penultimate Sunday of action the focus turned to the battle for Serie A survival and European qualification. 

Romas first win since Bruno Conti took charge in mid-March put an end to fears of the capital club slipping into Serie B for the first time in 53 years. 

A cool finish from Cassano five minutes into the second half proved to be decisive against Atalanta and resulted in scenes of celebrations from the Roma players. 

Roma have secured a Uefa Cup spot via their qualification for the Italian Cup final where they will face Inter Milan ? already assured of a place in the Champions League thanks to their third place finish in Serie A. 

Fiorentina, next to bottom, remained in trouble after a controversial 1-1 draw at Lazio. 

Enzo Maresca headed Fiorentina in front in the second minute but Sebastiano Siviglias header from a corner in the 18th minute brought Lazio level. 

Fiorentina were left fuming on the half hour when Fabrizio Miccoli blasted a shot against the bar and Martin Jorgensens follow up was handled on the line by Luciano Zauri. 

Referee Roberto Rosetti waved play on but Fiorentina captain Angelo Di Livio said there was no doubt about the handball. 

Fiorentina, who are at home to fellow strugglers Brescia on the final day, have 39 points and need to win their last match and hope results go their way. 

Siena, held to a goalless draw at fellow strugglers Parma, currently occupy the third of the three relegation slots on 40 points. 

Parma are one of three teams on 41 points along with Brescia, who had an impressive 2-1 over Messina, and free-falling Bologna who suffered a 1-0 defeat in their relegation six pointer with Chievo. 

In the race for European places, Udinese drew 1-1 at Cagliari to take a grip on fourth place after Brazilian Adriano gave Inter a 1-0 win over Sampdoria.Fourth place brings a spot in the Champions League qualifying round.

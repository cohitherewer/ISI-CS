 Daniel, Chisty likely to rule today 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Last week?s eight winners have brought trainer Daniel David closer to his fellow professional Vijay Singh at the championship table. They are separated by nine points now. Although it?s going be an arduous task, Daniel still seems keen enough to give it a try to catch up with the leader during the back-to-back fixtures beginning Wednesday. 

 Interestingly, jockey Imran Chisty has been declared to ride the horses meant for end-season gambles. They stand exposed now. The likes of Tycoon Girls, Mr Darcys and Russian Valours, who have been on handicap reducing missions during the season, stand good chances of winning their respective events in the day?s seven event.

 However, Vijay is not likely to 

 take things lying down. He also has two useful runners in 

 Spectacular Star and Aptitude to upset Daniel?s plans. With 

 three meetings to go, the race for the championship may, 

 therefore, go to the wire.

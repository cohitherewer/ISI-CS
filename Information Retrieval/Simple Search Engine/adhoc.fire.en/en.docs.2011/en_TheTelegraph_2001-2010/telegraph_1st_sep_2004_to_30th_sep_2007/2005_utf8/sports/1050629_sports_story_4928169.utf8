 Ljubljana: Former Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey will miss what would have been a record eighth world championships in Helsinki this August because of injury.

 Ottey, 45, who now competes for Slovenia, is to undergo surgery this week to repair a minor ligament tear in her upper left thigh.

 She sustained the injury during the 200 metres semi-finals at last year?s Athens Olympics.

 Ottey?s 14 medals are the most won by any athlete at the world championships. 

 Singapore: Singapore authorities will undertake one of the biggest security operations in the nation?s history for next week?s Olympics meeting with more than 2,000 personnel to be deployed, police said on Tuesday.

 About 3,500 foreigners are expected to attend the International Olympic Committee?s 117th session, the focus of which will be the vote on July 6 to determine which city will host the 2012 Games.

 A host of world leaders, sporting greats and celebrities are preparing to descend on Singapore to support the five cities ? Paris, London, New York, Madrid and Moscow ? in the running for the 2012 hosting rights. 

 Hong Kong: The searing Hong Kong heat could prove fatal to horses competing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics if the equestrian events are moved to the city, a former Hong Kong Equestrian Federation official has said.

 Games organisers are keen to shift the equestrian events to the southern Chinese territory because they cannot guarantee a disease-free area for horses in Beijing. However, Hong Kong?s hot and humid weather in August could be lethal for the horses, especially during the cross-country section of the three-day event competition, Tang Pui Tat was quoted as saying on Tuesday.

 Buenos Aires: Losing French Open finalist Mariano Puerta will lead Argentina?s Davis Cup quarter-final challenge against Australia next month while Guillermo Canas has opted to skip the tie while he awaits a doping investigation.

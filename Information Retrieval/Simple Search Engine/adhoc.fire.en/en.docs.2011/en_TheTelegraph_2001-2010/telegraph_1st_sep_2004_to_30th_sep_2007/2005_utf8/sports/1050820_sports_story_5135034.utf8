 Rashid Latif plays mediator

Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif reportedly convinced Inzamam-ul Haq to bury differences with Shoaib Akhtar. Inzamam agreed on Rashids insistence to have a one-to-one with Shoaib during the Afro-Asia Cup matches in South Africa. 

Rashid managed to convince Inzamam, when both were in Jeddah last month, to thrash out a proper working relationship with Shoaib. 

Rashid had a long discussion with Inzamam in which, after hearing out the complaints the Pakistan captain had against his fast bowler, he told him that if both worked together it would be beneficial for the team, a source was quoted as saying in a daily. 

Rashid then flew back to England and spoke to Shoaib and also told him to create a better working relationship with his captain which would be in his own interest and that of the team. 

Shoaib had a lot of complaints. But Rashid told him that he should not forget that until he played regularly and performed, he would never be able to enjoy the status of senior player nor earn the respect of the people. 

Shoaib then promised to have a candid discussion with Inzamam in South Africa to sort out the misunderstandings. (PTI)

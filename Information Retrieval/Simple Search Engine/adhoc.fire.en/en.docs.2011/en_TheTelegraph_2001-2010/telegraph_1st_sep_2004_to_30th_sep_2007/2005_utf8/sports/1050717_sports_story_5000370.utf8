Calcutta: Zimbabwe Cricket Union chief Peter Chingoka feels that no government should interfere in another countrys internal (read: cricketing) affairs. 

The New Zealand governments effort at scuttling the Zimbabwe tour, Chingoka feels, is mixing politics with sport. 

Chingoka said the New Zealand government should listen to what the International Cricket Council (ICC) says. 

If the ICC doesnt have any problem, what business has the New Zealand government in the matter? Chingoka asked. 

Speaking to The Telegraph at a city hotel on Saturday, Chingoka (he is in the city for a function) informed that the matter was discussed at an ICC meeting in Ireland on June 24-25. All members of ICC were there at the meeting and all were unanimous that cricket comes first. 

Looking back at the worst phase of the African nation when it was passing through a turmoil after several players walked out, the present chairman of the African Cricket Association (ACA) said that they have got over the worst phase and were now settling down. 

Eight players have returned to the fold, but I still say that they will have to earn places through performance, he stated firmly. 

Chingoka said neither has he changed his stance on Heath Streaks captaincy issue. 

According to the ACA supremo, Zimbabwe are trying hard to come back to the peak. 

We will have to perform well against New Zealand, and after that against India (from August 29, when they have their tri-series meeting in Harare) to make our stance clear, he remarked. 

He also praised the young generation, which received good exposure after the seniors walked out. Many of them are talented and they will be able to establish themselves in a short span of time.

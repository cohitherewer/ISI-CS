 India need a captaincy policy quickly: Rameez

 - Former Pak skipper not in favour of series-by-series appointments 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Dambulla: In Rameez Rajas opinion, the Indian Board and selectors should clarify their stand on captaincy and not make series-by-series appointments. 

Irrespective of the result in the tri-series, I would like Rahul Dravid to get a longer run... But, whether thats done or not, everybodys interest will be served if the policy is quickly announced, the former Pakistan captain told The Telegraph. 

Rameez, who is here as a TV commentator for the tournament which got underway on Saturday, added: A policy is needed because Sourav Ganguly is soon making a return and it doesnt help if theres uncertainty and the dressing room includes former captains... 

I know our cricket suffered when there were former captains (in the dressing room) and nobody quite knew what would happen in the next series... Im not saying India are going to have the same problem, but clarity on a touchy issue has advantages... 

With Sachin Tendulkar not around, Sourav will be the only regular former captain in the dressing room. 

Asked why he didnt want Sourav back as captain, Rameez replied: Sourav was sans fire when I saw him in the Tests and ODIs on our tour of India not many months ago... That he wasnt getting runs affected his captaincy... The freshness just wasnt there.... Sourav has captained for five years and theres a use-by date... 

There comes a time when change is needed... Even somebody of Imran Khans stature became rather bland towards the end ? we did win the (1992) World Cup, but many of us had begun to feel he was being repetitive... The stage of saying the same thing over and over again must not be reached. 

Rameezs view ? and, its sensible ? is that the 2007 World Cup should influence the policy on captaincy.

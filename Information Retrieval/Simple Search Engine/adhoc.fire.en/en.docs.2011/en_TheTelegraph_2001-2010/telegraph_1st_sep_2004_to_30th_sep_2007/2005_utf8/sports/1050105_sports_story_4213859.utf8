 Murali concerned about corruption

Trincomalee: Muttiah Muralidharan, an ambassador for the United Nation?s World Food Programme, has warned the government and donor community to guard against corruption and political favouritism as aid is distributed to victims of the tsunami disaster. 

Muralidharan, who has been closely involved in the relief operation, personally securing vehicles to send WFP food to disaster victims, is worried that much-needed aid could be siphoned off for personal gain by corrupt administrators if precautions are not taken. 

?I?m very concerned about corruption,? Muralidharan said. ?The food aid won?t last for long and it?s vital that what we have been given is used responsibly and fairly.? 

The 32-year-old off-spinner, who is a national icon, is also concerned about political favouritism after visiting three emergency camps in the east coast district of Trincomalee with fellow cricketers Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. 

The trio left Colombo on Sunday night leading a 10-truck convoy of food aid carrying 100 tonnes of sugar, rice and lentils. On Monday they oversaw the aid?s distribution and talked with the victims of the tragedy. 

More than 30,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka by last week?s tsunami, triggered by a huge underwater quake hundreds of miles away, off the Indonesian island of Sumatra. 

?I have come here as an WFP ambassador to try and understand what is happening on the ground,? said Muralidharan. ?Like me, all the cricketers in this country are totally committed to helping our people during this sad time.? 

?My concern at the moment, apart from possible corruption, is that distrust between different ethnic and religious communities is hampering distribution of the aid, which is now in the stores,? he said. ?It is absolutely essential that everyone in Sri Lanka now unites over this crisis ? if we can?t reunite now, what hope is there of ever rebuilding this country?? 

The cricketers, accompanied by Sri Lanka Cricket?s Melbourne-based surgeon Dr David Young, is helping to organise medical supplies for hospitals.

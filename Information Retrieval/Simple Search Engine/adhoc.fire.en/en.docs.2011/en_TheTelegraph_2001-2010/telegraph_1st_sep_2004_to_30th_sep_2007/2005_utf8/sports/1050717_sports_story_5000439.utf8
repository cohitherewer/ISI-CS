St Andrews: Tiger Woods smooth march towards his second British Open title was halted by two bogeys early in the third round Saturday. 

The world number one, four clear of the field overnight, dropped shots at the second and sixth holes as South African Retief Goosen fired a fluent 66 to move to within two strokes of Woods, along with Briton Colin Montgomerie. 

Woods, seeking his tenth major title, missed a six-foot putt on the second green to register his first bogey in 22 holes. 

After making his customary birdie at the fifth, a wayward drive on the sixth hole dropped the American back to 10 under. 

Although he also birdied the seventh, Woods was struggling in favourable conditions to reproduce the form that brought him serene opening rounds of 66 and 67 and another drive into the bushes almost cost him a shot at the ninth. 

Goosen, twice US Open champion, conjured up eight birdies including three in-a-row from the 14th hole to move to nine under, level with Woods playing partner Montgomerie, who started with four pars before picking up birdies at the fifth and ninth holes to delight the home crowds. 

I didnt feel I was out of the tournament when I teed off, I just knew I had to shoot a low round today, the 36-year-old told a news conference. I hit a few good iron shots coming in and it was a nice way to finish. Hopefully I wont be too far behind going into tomorrow. 

Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain moved quietly to eight under, one ahead of his compatriot Sergio Garcia, who sank a mammoth putt to eagle the ninth hole. 

South African Tim Clark, last weeks Scottish Open champion, was also at seven under along with American Scott Verplank, South African Trevor Immelman and US Open champion Michael Campbell of New Zealand who claimed seven birdies in a round of 68. 

World number two Vijai Singh suffered two early bogeys but three successive birdies from the fifth put him back in contention at seven under before a bogey at the eighth. 

I struggled with my putting yesterday but today I read the greens a lot better and hit a few good iron shots into the greens, said Goosen, popularly known as The Goose. 

After making a six at the fifth hole, I felt I was out of the tournament but I managed to regroup and birdied three of the next four holes. 

South Africas Ernie Els and American Phil Mickelson, ranked third and fourth in the world, slipped out of contention following disappointing rounds of 75 and 72, respectively. 

Many of the early starters took advantage of the benign conditions, Briton Darren Clarke, American Kenny Perry and Dutchman Maarten Lafeber shooting 67s and Denmarks Soren Hansen a 66 to finish on six under, level with 1985 Open champion Sandy Lyle who rolled back the years with a 69.

 Bryan twins romp to title

 New York: American twins Bob and Mike Bryan ended a run of three consecutive Grand Slam final defeats at the US Open on Friday as they beat top seeds Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Belarussian Max Mirnyi 6-1, 6-4. 

The second seeds cruised to their second Grand Slam title in just under an hour, gaining revenge over Bjorkman and Mirnyi for their defeat in the final of the French Open in June. We didnt want to go down as one of the only teams to lose all four slams, said Mike Bryan. 

The Bryan brothers won their first Grand Slam title at the French Open in 2003, but had lost all five of their subsequent Grand Slam finals until Fridays win. 

To do it at the US Open, its worth giving up five in a row, Bob Bryan said. 

Meanwhile, Andre Agassi is tired of all the retirement talk and wants to simply let his racquet do the talking as he takes aim at becoming the oldest US Open champion in 35 years. 

 quot;Its all going to come to an end at one time or another. Until that point, I want to be committed to this and see it through, quot; said Agassi, who moved a step closer to his goal with a five-set comeback win over fellow-American James Blake in the quarters.

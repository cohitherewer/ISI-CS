 Indians concede psychological point

 - FIRST TEST 

 Vaas, Muralidharan bowl out Dravid amp; Co. for 167; Jayawardene shines with sparkling 71 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Sourav in Chennai on Tuesday

Chennai: There are many in the Indian team who believe that the hosts best chances lie in preparing hard and bouncy wickets rather than offering turners to Muttiah Muralidharan and Co. 

The reason behind such an idea is to nullify the risk of the wily off-spinner running through the batting line-up in helpful conditions, and in the process, preparing for tougher battles ahead. 

That such thinking hold little credence was clear at the Chepauk on Tuesday as Warnakulasuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Vaas tore the Indian batsmen into shreds with a fine display of disciplined bowling. And all this on a slow and low wicket that had very little for fast bowlers! 

As the Indians flustered under a vicious web spun by Murali, Man-of-the-Match Vaas reaped the harvest with the new and old ball, relying on reverse swing and accuracy rather than express speed to trouble the batsmen. The Sri Lankan pacer now has 298 wickets and his figures for the day were 11-10-5-2. 

The Indians may not agree ? I dont think its a moral victory for Sri Lanka, declared coach Greg Chappell ? but the visitors have ended up gaining the psychological edge in the drawn game. 

Restricting the hosts to 167 was no mean task after the one-day debacle. The batting flourished, too, and the Indians were left struggling. 

I am pleased with the limited cricket here, said Tom Moody. The Sri Lankan captain also agreed. 

With the pitch lacking pace and carry, Kumar Sangakkara enjoyed the luxury of standing up to Vaas. Had a couple of catches not been dropped of his bowling, including one of Sachin Tendulkar, the hosts could have folded up for less than their lowest total against the islanders. 

It should be remembered that the Indians batted like charlatans and their over-cautious approach was also responsible for their demise. They even failed to hit the half-volleys. That there was no demon on the wicket was visible in the cool manner the Sri Lankans handled things. 

Nothing can, however, take away the credit from Muralidharan. Some of his deliveries did spin, kick and fairly dance through the air and off the pitch. One turned across the face of Sourav Gangulys bat as he stood clueless. 

Sachin Tendulkars 22 disappointed the handsome gathering and didnt deserve the world record 35th hundred here, considering the manner in which he batted. 

The confidence was missing and so was the touch. The Master Blaster had to wait for 76 balls to get his first boundary and the only positive shot during his 126-ball innings was a paddle sweep of Muralidharan. 

Sourav was all nerves as he faced the first ball from Murali. A horrible mix-up ended in VVS Laxman getting run out. But once he cover drove Dilhara Fernando to the fence, he seemed to be back in his elements. Then, as he drove away from his body, Tillekeratne Dilshan dived at point to bring off a spectacular low catch. The 31 minute, 26 ball innings yielded five. 

Mahendra Singh Dhonis debut was dramatic. He survived after being caught off a no-ball early and then stepped out to Murali to show glimpses of his one-day magic. His 30 was the second highest among Indians after Virender Sehwags 32. The wicketkeeper was the last man out as the innings folded up 16 minutes after lunch. 

Irfan Pathan showed promise as he removed Avishka Gunawardene in the first over. 

Mahela Jayawardene was outstanding. He struck the right balance between defence and attack and it paid dividends. He departed to a debatable decision after scoring 71 off 80 balls (15x4,1x6). 

Anil Kumble showed once again that there was no substitute for precision. His three wickets were a reward for his ability to utilise the conditions to perfection. He was the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal Indian show. The Lankans will enjoy the psychological edge going into the Delhi Test.

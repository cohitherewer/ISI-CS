Calcutta: India under-19 boys clinched the ?Test? series against their English counterparts after they beat the visitors by an innings and 106 runs in the second match at the Eden on Sunday. By virtue of this win, the hosts took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. The next match will commence in Jamshedpur on Wednesday. 

England folded up for 157, adding only 17 runs to their overnight tally of 140 for six. The English batsmen survived only 50 minutes and 13.4 overs this morning. England, needing 123 more runs to avoid an innings defeat, lost their remaining four wickets for just 17 runs. 

Tewari celebrated his promotion to captaincy in the one-day series getting rid of Adam Harrison (8). Tewari also ran out Mark Lawson (3). , when he set off for the run after guiding the ball to cover. Tewari threw down the wicket at the non-striker?s end in a flash. 

Chawla followed up his four-wicket haul in the first innings with an equally impressive show in the second innings. The leggie returned a match haul of eight for 80. ?This is my first ?Test? and the Man of the Match award means a lot,? he said.

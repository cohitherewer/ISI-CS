 Smith still unhappy

Cape Town: South Africa captain Graeme Smith has again spoken out against the super sub rule in ODIs. 

Speaking before Fridays second one-dayer against New Zealand, Smith said the subject was discussed at an international captains meeting in Sydney before the ICC Super Test. 

There wasnt much support for it, to be honest, Smith said. There was a feeling that cricket is an 11-man game and should be played that way. 

The way it works at the moment is unfair and favours the side winning the toss far too much. (Reuters)

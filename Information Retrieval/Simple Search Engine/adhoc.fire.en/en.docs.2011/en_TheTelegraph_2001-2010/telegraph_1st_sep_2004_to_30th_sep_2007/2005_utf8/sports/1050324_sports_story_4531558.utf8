 Ferrari tries to get new car ready

Scarperia (Italy): Soundly beaten in the first two races, Ferrari scrambled to get its new car ready for next month?s Bahrain Grand Prix. 

Michael Schumacher?s shot at a sixth straight Formula One title could slip away quickly. Schumacher was seventh in Sunday?s Malaysian GP, more than a minute behind Renault?s winner Fernando Alonso. 

Teammate Rubens Barrichello failed to finish, retiring on the 50th lap after a piece of rubber lodged in his car?s rear wing. 

That left Ferrari with 10 points from two races ? 16 behind Renault ? running a modified version of its 2004 car. 

In testing Tuesday, Barrichello completed 95 laps in the new F-2005 model. On the 96th lap around the Mugello circuit, the Brazilian ?heard something that didn?t sound right in the motor? and decided to call it a day. 

?The first sensation is what matters,? Barrichello said. ?And I?m very pleased by how I felt at the wheel of the F-2005.? Schumacher, the seven-time series champion, was expected to test later. (AP)

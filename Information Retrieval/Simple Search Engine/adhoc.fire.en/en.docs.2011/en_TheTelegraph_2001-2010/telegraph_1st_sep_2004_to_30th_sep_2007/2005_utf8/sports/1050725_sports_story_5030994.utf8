 Vaas likely to miss opener vs India

 - TRI-SERIES 

 Two new faces in Sri Lanka squad 

 Vaas is suffering from a hamstring strain 

Kandy: Uncapped players Upul Tharanga and Dilhara Lokuhettige were named in a 15-man Sri Lanka squad for the tri-series against India and the West Indies. 

Left-handed opening batsman Tharanga, 20, was chosen over Avishka Gunawardene after performing consistently well for the A team over the past year. 

Fast-bowling allrounder Lokuhettige, 25, has played 59 matches, scoring 1761 runs at 21.47 and taking 137 wickets at 27.25. He was selected ahead of allrounder Gayan Wijekoon, who is playing in the Test series. 

Pace bowler Dilhara Fernando was recalled after battling back from injury and poor form to impress during the recent A series against the West Indies. 

Meanwhile, fast bowler Chaminda Vaas is likely to miss the start of the tri-series, the teams physiotherapist said on Sunday. 

Vaas struggled when batting in the second Test against the West Indies on Sunday and had to call for a runner before being bowled for 19. 

Chaminda picked up a grade one hamstring strain the other day and at the moment he is looking at being out for seven to 10 days, physiotherapist CJ Clarke said after the third days play. 

At this stage he looks unlikely for the first game against India in the tri-series. 

Vaas, who completed figures of six for 22 in West Indies first innings, will not bowl again in the match. 

The series begins in Dambulla on Saturday with the hosts taking on India under lights. The final is on August 9. 

THE XV 

Maravan Atapattu (captain), Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Upul Tharanga, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Russel Arnold, Chaminda Vaas, Upul Chandana, Muttiah Muralidharan, Nuwan Zoysa, Dilhara Lokuhettige, Dilhara Fernando, Farveez Maharoof, Lasith Malinga.

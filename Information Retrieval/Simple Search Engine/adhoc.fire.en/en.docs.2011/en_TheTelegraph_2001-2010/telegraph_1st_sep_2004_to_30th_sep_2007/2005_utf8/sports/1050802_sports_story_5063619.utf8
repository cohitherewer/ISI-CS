 ICC should scrap bans on captains: Inzamam

 Inzzmam is glad to see Souravs ban reduced 

Karachi: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq has stressed that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should scrap suspensions on captains since it put a question mark on their future. 

He said this while welcoming the reduction of Sourav Gangulys ban from six to four matches. I am glad that the ICC reduced Souravs ban and hopefully he will soon regain his lost place. But frankly speaking, I am not a big supporter of match bans because it can put the careers of some captains on the line, Inzamam said from Lahore. 

Sourav was slapped with a six-match ban for slow over-rate in the Ahmedabad one-dayer against Pakistan. But Justice Albie Sachs, an independent arbitrator, ruled last week that Souravs original punishment for slow over-rates was too severe. 

Sourav Ganguly is a perfect example of the ICC ban. You see, a six-match ban practically means you are out of two series, and when the ban is finished, you are left struggling to reclaim your place, the Pakistan skipper said. 

It would have been tragic if a player of Souravs stature would have seen his career come to a dead-end because of this six-match ban, he said. 

Instead of bans, he suggested the ICC impose fines on captains for slow over-rate. 

I dont like to see match bans being enforced on captains. Instead, I would prefer hefty fines on them if they fail to perform their duties, he said. What I dont understand is, if a team is found guilty of slow over-rate, why has only the captain to pay the price. I mean, the entire team is responsible. But the players get small punishments, while the captain is reduced to the sidelines, Inzamam, who has been the worst sufferer due to slow over-rates, said. 

He said after Souravs ban was reduced, he regretted his decision not to appeal against a one-Test ban imposed on him at the time of the Bangalore Test. 

I understand that I was charged under a different code, nevertheless, I should have appealed the ban. I am sure the ICC would have taken into account the match situation and, if luck had favoured me, my ban might also have been reduced. 

Due to the ban, Inzamam missed the first Test against the West Indies in Barbados that the home side won. Pakistan managed to draw level in Jamaica but were robbed of an opportunity to win a Test series. If we had played with full strength, we probably would have won the Barbados Test too. And I think my decision to not to appeal against the ban also played a role.

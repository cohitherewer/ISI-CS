 ACC plans ODI for quake victims

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) plans to organise a one-day International in aid of the earthquake victims of India and Pakistan. 

ACC president Jagmohan Dalmiya said in a press release that the details ? contesting teams, the venue and date ? would be decided shortly. 

 It is the sacred duty of cricket to come forward and lend its hand to the earthquake victims and this is where the ACC would step in, said Dalmiya. 

The date of the match would be decided shortly after looking into the tour arrangements of the Test-playing countries. 

We will also be approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) to give official status to the match once the details are finalised, concluded Dalmiya.

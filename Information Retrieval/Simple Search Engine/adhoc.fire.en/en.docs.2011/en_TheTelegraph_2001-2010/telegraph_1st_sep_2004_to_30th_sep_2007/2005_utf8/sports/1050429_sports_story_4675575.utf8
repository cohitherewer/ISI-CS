The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Jeev two shots adrift of leaders

 - ASIAN OPEN GOLF

 Els shoots 5-under 

Shanghai: World number three Ernie Els fired a smooth five-under-par 67 in sweltering heat to share the first round lead at the $ 1.5 million Asian Open Thursday. India?s best shot was by Jeev Milkha Singh, a three under, two shots adrift of the leading pack. 

Frenchman Jean Van de Velde, who is attempting his latest comeback from serious knee injuries, was one of six other players tied with Els in Shanghai. 

Van de Velde?s countryman Raphael Jacquelin, New Zealand?s Eddie Lee, Australian Larry Austin and British pair Peter Lawrie and Simon Wakefield were also five under. 

The seven-way tie equals the European Tour record for the number of players sharing the lead after a first round. 

Jeev fired a three-under par 69 first round to be in joint eighth place on the par 72 course. Jyoti Randhawa managed a two under opening round, but was down at joint 12th with a host of others. 

Amandeep Johl managed a poor two over round, with Rahil Gangjee and Gaurav Ghei hitting three over par rounds. Harmeet Kahlon had the worst day among the Indians in fray, going wildly off target at seven over. 

Els has already won in Dubai and Qatar this year and he finished tied for sixth at last weeks Johnnie Walker Classic in Beijing. 

The South African began with back-to-back birdies and had five in total on the front nine as temperatures reached almost 40 degrees in Shanghai. 

His only bogey came at the par-four seventh but Els got up and down from a greenside bunker at the 13th for his only birdie of the back nine. 

?The heat took its toll at the end,? said Els. ?It was quite muggy and I had a few more chances on the back nine.? 

Els is still working on minor changes to his game after finishing a career-worst 47th at the US Masters earlier this month but the 35-year-old feels his tinkering is close to bearing fruit. ?I would say I?m a 7 or 8 out of 10 right now,? said the three-times major winner. 

Van de Velde is best remembered for squandering a three-stroke lead on the final hole to lose the 1999 British Open. 

The former Ryder Cup player has twice had reconstructive surgery on his knees and is making his fourth comeback attempt in the past year. 

?It was my best round for a while because I didn?t throw any destructive shots in,? said Van de Velde. ?I?m taking each day as it comes. I am concentrating on just trying to play not trying to put pressure on myself. I say that, tomorrow I might be choking like a dog.? 

Denmark?s Soren Hansen, South African Richard Sterne, Jeev and Spaniard Carlos Rodiles were two shots back in the event jointly sanctioned by the European and Asian tours. 

Spain?s Miguel Angel Jimenez began his title defence with a 70, along with Britain?s Luke Donald, China?s Zhang Lian-wei and Australia?s Peter ?Malley, who aced the par-three eighth. 

Britain?s Colin Montgomerie had a one-over 73 while six-times major winner Nick Faldo was at even par.

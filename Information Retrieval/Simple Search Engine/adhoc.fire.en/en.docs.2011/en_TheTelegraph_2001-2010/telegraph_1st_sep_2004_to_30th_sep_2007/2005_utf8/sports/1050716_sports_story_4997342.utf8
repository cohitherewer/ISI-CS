Sydney: Australia led Argentina 1-0 when play was suspended because of bad weather after the opening day of their Davis Cup World Group quarter final on Friday descended into a bitter war of words. 

Lleyton Hewitt gave the Australians the perfect start when he won a feisty clash with Guillermo Coria 7-6, 6-1, 1-6, 6-2 but David Nalbandian was looking to square the tie with a 6-3, 7-6, 5-7 lead over Wayne Arthurs. 

Their match was interrupted for more than a hour after the second set when it began to rain and although play later resumed under lights, the players called a halt after the third set because of the moisture on the temporary grass court at Sydneys Olympic Tennis Centre. 

In Moscow, Nikolay Davydenko levelled Russias quarter final against France 1-1 by overpowering Paul-Henri Mathieu 7-5, 6-2, 7-5 in the second singles match on Friday. 

After a tight opening set which lasted over an hour, the Russian world No. 7 took complete control, breaking Mathieu twice to take a two-set lead on the clay court at Moscows Olympic Stadium. 

Davydenko then broke his opponent twice more in the third to build a 5-2 lead before the Frenchman staged a late rally. 

Mathieu saved two match points in the eighth game and three more in the 10th to level the score at 5-5 before the Russian finally sealed victory on his sixth opportunity two games later in just under three hours. 

Earlier, teenager Richard Gasquet overcame debut nerves to put France 1-0 up, by thrashing Igor Andreev 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 in the first singles. 

Gasquet broke the Russian in the 10th game to take the first set and raced to a 3-0 lead in the second before comfortably holding his serve to go two sets up. Gasquet took a medical time-out in the third game of the third set when doctors worked on his right wrist and was later troubled by leg cramps but still managed to clinch the match, winning the tiebreaker 7-1. 

Relations between Australia and Argentina were strained before the tie began following clashes at this years Australian Open and deteriorated further after Fridays opening singles matches. 

Hewitts match with Coria threatened to boil over after the pair traded insults and accused each other of bad sportsmanship. 

Coria, who became increasingly frustrated by Hewitts tempestuous behaviour, accused the Australian of swearing at him while Hewitt responded by calling the Argentinian a sore loser. 

I admire his game but I dont like the way he is, Coria told a news conference. He can be the best player in the world, he can win every tournament but he can not behave the way he does, abusing the captain, abusing the other players. 

Hewitt denied swearing at his opponent and accused the South Americans of unsportsmanlike behaviour. 

To be perfectly honest, I think hes arrogant and he lost the match today and hes looking for other excuses, Hewitt said. Not once did I have words with him and to tell you the truth I think hes a sore loser. 

Coria complained about the state of the court, saying it was not up to standard, while Hewitt took a swipe at Nalbandian and the Argentine captain, Alberto Mancini. 

Their captain, who has been mouthing off all week about sportsmanship, was talking to the referee every second point on my service games, Hewitt said. 

The outbursts overshadowed the match where Hewitt had needed all his combative skills to subdue Coria, recovering from a slow start then surviving a determined comeback. 

Hewitt dropped his second service game, but recovered to win the first set tiebreak after Coria failed to serve out the set when he made three unforced errors and served a double fault. 

Hewitt broke Coria twice in the second set to grab a two-set lead but the Argentine fought back to win the third. 

The opening exchanges of the fourth set were dominated by the increasing bitterness between the players but it was the Australian who regained his composure first to seal victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kasparov again the big Linares draw 

 Anand hasn?t won this title after 1998 

Linares: Having won his last title here seven years back, world No. 2 Viswanathan Anand will look to set the record straight when the Linares super GMs tournament gets underway on Wednesday. 

The prestigious event features the world?s top guns, with the No. 1 seed being none other than Russian legend Garri Kasparov. 

The tournament will be played on a double round-robin format among seven players under classical time control and the winner will take home euro 100,000 (approx rs 57 lakh) from a total prize pool of euro 297,000. 

Besides Anand and Kasparov, the organisers have also roped in world No. 3 Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria. 

Former champion Peter Leko of Hungary, who recently won the Corus tournament in Holland ahead of Anand, is also in the fray. Leko is currently ranked fifth in the world. 

No. 4 Vladimir Kramnik was also invited but he withdrew. The organisers then roped in Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan. 

Briton Michael Adams is sixth player and field is completed by best Spanish hope Francisco Vallejo Pons, who is now a regular in this event. 

Since winning the crown in 1998, Anand?s best showing here has been a third-place finish in 1999 besides tied third places on three other occasions. Last year, Anand gave Linares a miss. 

Kasparov has not been playing much of late but continues to be in news for different reasons. The world?s top-rated player for many years recently stormed out from the planned reunification treaty and his serial books ?My great predecessors? have been making waves across the globe. 

THE FIELD 

Garri Kasparov (Russia, world No. 1, Elo 2804); Viswanathan Anand (Ind, No. 2, Elo 2786); Veselin Topalov (Bul, No. 3, Elo 2757); Peter Leko (Hun, No. 5, Elo 2749); Michael Adams (GBR, No. 6, Elo 2741); Francisco Vallejo Pons (Esp, No. 18, Elo 2686); Rustam Kasimdzhanov (Uzb, No. 25, Elo 2786).

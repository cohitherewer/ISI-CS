Hyderabad: Putting to rest all speculation about his injury, batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar on Monday said he was fully fit and looking forward to a good season in the forthcoming series against Pakistan. 

?I?m fully fit and preparing for the big series ahead,? Sachin told reporters before going to nets at the Visakha Stadium, which will host the Duleep Trophy match between West Zone and South Zone from Tuesday. 

On the Indo-Pak series, the Master Blaster said, ?any sport at the highest level has its own pressure? 

?It?s nice to be under pressure, it keeps you on your toes. You just get used to it, that?s how you perform,? Sachin said. 

But he disagreed that the recent performance of Pakistan against Australia and the Indian show across the border are indicators to the forthcoming series. 

?Every series is a new one and we have to play the game according to our strength,? he said. 

Tendulkar evaded a direct reply when asked if he was in favour of shuffling the batting order. ?It?s for Sourav and others to decide who will play in which slot,? he said. 

On his condition, Sachin said, ?whatever my doctors and physio told me to do, I have done and I think I?m well and looking at a good season ahead.? 

The batting genius was wearing an elbow strap during the nets Sunday and said he has been advised to wear it in practice sessions as a precaution. 

?Last week, I had a session with my physio John Gloster who is the best in the field and I am doing what I am being asked. He has a vast experience and is extremely good,? Sachin said. 

?I?m gearing up for the big day and will eventually do what specialists say is right for me as I have no knowledge about the science,? the ace batsman said adding, ?I have to wait and see how it works.? 

Sachin said he would follow his physio?s instructions in preparing for the Duleep Trophy match. 

On whether he was fully confident of his fitness and the physiotherapy he had undergone, Sachin said, ?I think I?m fit, that?s the reason why I?m here to play. If something happens in the course of practice or a match... Well, we can?t say.? (PTI)

 Poor fields in Thursday card 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Only 38 horses have accepted to contest the six events framed for the season opener on Thursday. RCTC officials blame it on the week-long rain, affecting preparations of horses. But trainers rubbished the claim. Where are the horses? After a tiring monsoon season, most horses need some rest, said a trainer.

 Monsoon contingent has been further reduced after about 45 of MAM Ramaswamy-owned horses were replaced by 20 new from the South. Some of Deepak Khaitans horses have already returned, after fulfiling their outstation engagements, but they will not be pushed into the fray in a hurry. Therefore, the winter season is going to be an extension of the monsoon racing, though the RCTC bigwigs feel the forthcoming season is going to be the most exciting one.

 In Thursdays main event, the 1,200m Rising Star Cup, there are seven horses in the running, including an in-form Noble Flash.

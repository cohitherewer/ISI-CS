 Lehmann dumped

 Lehmann 

Sydney: The international future of Darren Lehmann is in jeopardy after he was dumped on Thursday from Australia?s one-day team to tour New Zealand later this month. 

The 35-year-old batsman, who hit the winning runs in the 1999 World Cup final, has been badly out of form and his omission from the squad could signal the end of his Australian career. 

Western Australia?s Mike Hussey was chosen as Lehmann?s replacement in the 14-man squad while uncapped Queensland allrounder James Hopes was promoted to take over from the injured Shane Watson. 

Opening batsman Matthew Hayden, dropped for the recent triangular one-day series finals with Pakistan, was also included. 

?Darren has been a wonderful player for Australia over a long period of time,? chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said in a statement. ?However, as a selection panel, we have to start looking to the future. At 35, age is not on Darren?s side and it is fair to say that his performances of late were becoming a concern.? (REUTERS)

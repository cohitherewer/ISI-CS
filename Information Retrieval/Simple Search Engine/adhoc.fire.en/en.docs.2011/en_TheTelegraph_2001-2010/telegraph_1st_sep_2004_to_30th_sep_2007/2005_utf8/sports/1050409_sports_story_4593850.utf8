The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav has to beat the ?enemy? within

 - Team India captain turns to book with ?plenty of positive thoughts? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly at the Keenan on Friday, even as groundsmen put the final touches in place 

Jamshedpur: Owing to a mix-up, one got off the wrong floor at the Team India hotel (The Regent) on Friday afternoon. And, waiting for the lift was somebody ?nursed? by Sourav Ganguly in the not too distant past. 

?Maine to kaha hai, lekin aap bhi kaptan ko kaho... Bas apna normal game hi khele,? the player remarked, thoughtfully, suggesting Sourav could give more weightage to something put forward by a fellow-Calcuttan. 

Fact is the captain himself knows he must play in the manner that has taken him to the doorstep of 10,000 runs in one-day cricket. 

Sourav began the ongoing series versus Pakistan 64 short, but managed just nine in the first two ODIs. 

He would have been in a better frame of mind had (a) he scored big in the preceding Tests and (b) had some former cricketers, administrators and Mediapersons desisted from going for his jugular. 

Today, Sourav has to first beat the ?enemy? within: Clear the mind and, then, clear the field. 

Towards that end, he has taken to Robin Sharma?s The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari ? marketed as a ?fable about following your dreams and reaching your destiny...? 

Incidentally, that bestseller was Yuvraj Singh?s companion during the Test series ? he made the XIV all three times, but never the starting line-up. 

?I got the book last night and finished off 60-odd pages in a jiffy... It?s interesting and has plenty of positive thoughts,? Sourav, not exactly known to be a keen reader, told The Telegraph. 

More than anything else, being positive is an absolute priority. 

The Tatas?-driven Steel City, of course, is somewhat of a second home and the support alone should lift Sourav. Even the hoarding announcing the Jamshedpur Food Festival highlighted its inauguration by ?our captain.? 

Somehow, the captain missed it, but smiled when informed of that sentimental touch. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, played a captain?s knock (an unbeaten 105) in India?s only win at the Keenan ? against South Africa, a shade over five years ago. 

That was in his first series as full-fledged captain. It?s time for another leading from-the-front statement in the biggest home engagement for quite some time. 

Footnote: The Amitabh Choudhary-headed Jharkhand State Cricket Association and the local administration must also put their best foot forward. After all, the last ODI here (versus the West Indies in November 2002) saw much tamasha and a brief ?abandonment? as well...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We wont do anything different: Kallis

 - A first for Dravid in hometown; Langeveldt faces fitness test 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: It may still be a full house on Saturday, but the build-up to ODI No. 2 between India and South Africa has been sans the frenzy seen across the country during the just-ended series against Sri Lanka. 

Such a low-key build-up could work to Indias advantage as Rahul Dravid seeks to make it 1-1 in the five-match Pepsi Cup. It will, of course, be an emotional moment when he goes for the toss with Graeme Smith ? never before has this citys favourite son of the present times led India in his hometown. 

Dravid, however, isnt allowing sentiments to overwhelm him. In fact, when The Telegraph asked whether he remembered either the outcome or his own score on his first appearance at the Chinnaswamy, he said: I know I was 14, but thats it... I dont recall the scores, but I probably played for Bangalore United Cricket Club... 

Given that Dravid is familiar with every blade of grass is also an advantage. Yet, that bit cant be overplayed because the South Africans are known to make a scientific assessment of each venue. 

They didnt have anything to fall back on, before the first ODI (at the new stadium in Hyderabad), but emerged convincing winners. 

Vice-captain Jacques Kallis, who stood in for Smith at the pre-match Media conference, emphasised they would continue with the game plan adopted in Hyderabad. After the five-wicket victory, theres really no need to change anything. 

Another win (the 21st) is going to place South Africa on a par with world record-holders Australia, but Kallis declared they wouldnt try and over-reach by doing anything different from the last 20 ODIs. 

He added: Our roles are clearly defined and everyone knows whats expected of each of them... The new coach (Mickey Arthur) has brought about honesty within the team and the team spirit has lifted. Technically, too, hes clued-in. 

Hyderabad notwithstanding, the South Africans wont be taking anything lightly. As Kallis put it: The Indians have batters and bowlers who can take the match away at any stage... Today, the series looks finely balanced. The momentum, though, is with us and the pressure on India. 

Talking of pressure, South Africas numero uno star remarked he had been subjected to it from the start of his career, a decade ago. Different people have different ways of handling it... I take each game and each ball as it comes... Im comfortable with that. 

The Indians, according to Dravid, are thinking of a few things and a few ideas and that different areas are being looked at. As for coach Greg Chappell (who has made Bangalore his second home), every team provides a challenge and he reminded that his wards had what it takes to beat South Africa. 

Chappell admitted that the team knew more about the visitors after Hyderabad. Now, weve got a better idea of how they intend tackling our bowlers and what they intend throwing at our batsmen... 

Given the quality of the South African pace attack, which reduced us to 35 for five in the opening ODI, its possible that Dravid will himself bat at No. 3. He didnt confirm, but accepted it was one option. 

While Kallis felt the wicket (incidentally, sans the moisture seen in Hyderabad) would aid spin, Dravid didnt reveal much: Lets say its a good wicket... Whatever else, Im going to keep close to my chest. 

The Indians will be tempted to have both specialist spinners ? Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik ? on call. All XV are available for selection. 

The South Africans, however, have a problem: Charl Langeveldt pulled his left hamstring in Hyderabad and has to undergo a fitness test at 11.30 am ? three hours before the match gets underway. Its likely that Smith will have to change the victorious XI. 

Dew is bound to come into play and, on Friday, the South African bowlers practised with wet balls. A nice idea to get a feel, but the actual conditions may be worse. Whoever adapts with the least adjustment could be best placed to call ? or play ? the shots. 

SA security officer 

The South Africans, meanwhile, are travelling with a security officer from back home. The gentleman, Bob Nicolls, has apparently done some work for tycoon-MP Vijay Mallya in the past and, so, got chosen for this assignment. Hes employed by a private firm.

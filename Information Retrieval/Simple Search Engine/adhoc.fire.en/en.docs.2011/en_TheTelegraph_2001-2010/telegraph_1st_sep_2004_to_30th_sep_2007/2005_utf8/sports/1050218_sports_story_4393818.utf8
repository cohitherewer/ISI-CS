 Kim sets up Venus date

 - ANTWERP OPEN 

 Belgian made to toil by Petrova in Round II 

 Venus Williams of the US hits a forehand to Frenchwoman Virginie Razzano during their second round match at the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp on Wednesday. Williams won 6-3, 6-0 

Brussels: Former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters continued her comeback from a debilitating wrist injury with a 7-5, 6-7, 6-1 victory over Russia?s Nadia Petrova in the second round of the Antwerp Open on Wednesday. 

Clijsters will meet another former world No.1 Venus Williams, seeking her third title in Antwerp, in the quarter finals after the American swept past France?s Virginie Razzano 6-3, 6-0. 

Belgian Clijsters, sidelined since last October, easily overcame Jelena Kostanic in the first round but was made to work harder for the victory against the fifth-seeded Russian on Wednesday. 

Both played excellent tennis in the first set with some outstanding ground strokes and held serve until the 12th game of the set when Clijsters won on her third break point. 

Petrova reacted well in the second set, breaking Clijsters early to lead 3-1 in the second set before the Belgian was able rally and tie the score at 4-4. The set went into a tie-break and while Petrova looked tired she managed to win the break 7-3. 

In the final set, Clijsters broke Petrova three times, including the final game, to easily run out a 6-1 winner. 

The victory by Clijsters, who reached last year?s Australian Open final before suffering wrist injuries and having to undergo surgery on her left wrist, set up an intriguing quarter final clash with Williams. 

Third-seed Williams, who will win a gold and diamond-encrusted racket should she add to her 2002 and 2003 victories at the tournament, was barely troubled against Razzano. 

?My tennis was very good today,? said the American. ?But it is no surprise to me because I feel very healthy and have been working well lately.?

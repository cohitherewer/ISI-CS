The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hewitt pushes rules to the limit: Canas

 - AUSTRALIAN OPEN DIARY 

 Lleyton Hewitt blows 

 a kiss to the crowd after beating Rafael Nadal in Melbourne 

 on Monday 

Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt plays within the rules but at times pushes it to the limit, says Argentina?s Guillermo Canas. 

Canas was speaking after compatriot Juan Ignacio Chela was fined $2,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct for spitting during his third-round centre-court loss Saturday to Hewitt. 

Hewitt?s fist pumps, yells of ?come on? and pointing toward his head and heart on key points have become a part of his on-court demeanour, sometimes appearing to upset his opponents. 

?It?s sometimes tough to play against him, especially here in Australia, he have more tension,? said Canas. ?He plays within the rules but sometimes pushing the rules to the limit.? 

 Golden moments 

 Lindsay Davenport has won 45 WTA Tour singles titles, 

 including three Grand Slams, and 35 in doubles. That?s a 

 lot of trophies, most of which are in ?kind of a side hallway? 

 at Davenport?s California house. 

But the trophies take a back seat to the gold medal she won at the Atlanta Olympics, beating four top 10 players along the way. ?I get more questions to see the gold medal more than anything else,? Davenport said after her fourth-round win over Karolina Sprem. 

 Roddick up, for now 

 Andy Roddick, James Blake and 

 Mardy Fish are doing their best to contribute money to a 

 local casino during the Australian Open. ?James was (up), 

 but him and Mardy didn?t do so well the other night,? Roddick 

 said of the trio?s appearance at the blackjack tables. ?But 

 that?s not saying a whole lot because I?m not up a whole 

 lot, just enough to keep my playing. I?ve been trying to 

 donate money to the casino, but it hasn?t worked yet.? (Agencies)

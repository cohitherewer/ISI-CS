 Atwal ends tied 58th

 Atwal has now made the cut in each of 10 starts 

Silvis (US): Arjun Atwal had a disastrous start to his final round with three bogeys in first four holes, but did well to regain composure to end the day at one-over in the $4 million John Deere Classic here. 

His final round of one-over 72, his only over-par round of the week, saw him end at five-under 279 and in the tied 58th place. 

Atwal had three bogeys in first four holes, but then birdies on fifth and ninth helped him back. Another birdie on tenth brought him to par, but he gave that away on the next hole before parring the rest of the holes. 

Atwal has now made cuts in each of his 10 starts and has two top-10 finishes and one more at 16th place. His total earnings now stand at $ 695,421. He will play the BC Open next week. 

Meanwhile, rookie Sean Hair landed his first career PGA Tour win with a sensational six-under-par 65 on final day to hold off J. L. Lewis and Hank Kuehne to win the title. 

Hair, who turned 23 Monday and was making only his 18th career start finished with a 16-under 268. 

Hair, who earns a place into the British Open with this win, is however, not sure whether he will make a trip across the Atlantic. 

A tense Hair ran into some trouble at the end as he stood at 16-under after his birdie on 17. On the 18th, he nearly put the ball in the water. Just saved, he chipped from the hazard line and then made par. 

Kuehne and Lewis two holes behind him were at 15 under after 17 holes. They needed a birdie on 18 to go to a playoff. Lewis put his second shot in the water and Kuehne missed a 24-footer putt for birdie. 

Kuehne (68) and Robert Damron (67) finished one stroke behind Hair at 269. Lewis (72), defending champion Mark Hensby (64) and Wes Short (66) were at 270.

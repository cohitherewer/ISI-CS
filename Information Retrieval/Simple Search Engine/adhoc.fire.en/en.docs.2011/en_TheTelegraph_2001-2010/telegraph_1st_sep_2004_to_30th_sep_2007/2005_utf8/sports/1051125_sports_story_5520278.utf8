Calcutta: Team India captain Rahul Dravid felt that his boys were in great spirits. We are enjoying each others company, enjoying the whole tour. It has been a long road, but we all know a couple of games are still there and we need to win them. 

Team spirit is something that needs to be worked on, to be conscious of. And it requires the right people who are moving in the same direction? thats when you have great team spirit. Of course, winning also helps. 

We have gained a lot in the last three-four weeks. It has given us ideas about what exactly we need... And the kind of people we need, he said on Thursday, the eve of the fourth ODI against South Africa. 

Dravid also felt toss could be a deciding factor in Fridays match because of the dew. 

Yes, we know the team batting first has won here on most of the occasions. But then Pakistan won batting second. Dew will be a factor. We will consider all aspects before deciding whether to bat or bowl. 

The Indians do not have a good record here and Dravid said the below par showing in the last few ODIs would not put any pressure on his side. Each match is different and each day is different. We have learnt a few lessons from the last couple of matches. I am not worried over what happened in the last few games. On the positive side, we also won the Test against Pakistan. 

The extended net session left the Indians satisfied. We could not have nets properly in Chennai because of the rains. So the boys wanted to spend a long time at the nets here. 

 Dravid, however, did not believe that the washout of the Chennai match would affect the momentum of his team. I dont believe in momentum. Whoever plays better cricket will win. We need a bit of luck, and have to play good cricket. 

The washout in Chennai has given Calcuttans the opportunity to watch Sachins record 357th match. And Dravid was all praise for him: It is a special occasion not only for Sachin, but for all of us in the team. It has been a privilege sharing the dressing room with him. He is a legend? 

Its been a fantastic feat because he has not only managed to play top-flight cricket for so long, but also gained huge success. We will all be behind him, said Team India captain. 

Offie Harbhajan Singh also came in for special praise. He has been the unsung hero for us in this whole campaign. He has bowled brilliantly in every single game and he has been taking wickets.

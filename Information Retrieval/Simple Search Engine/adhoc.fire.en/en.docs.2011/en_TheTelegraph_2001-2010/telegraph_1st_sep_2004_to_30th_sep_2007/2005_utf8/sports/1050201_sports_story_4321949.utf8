 Border medal for Clarke

 Clarke 

Sydney: Australia?s new cricketing sensation Michael Clarke received the Allan Border medal on Monday as the country?s best player over the past year. 

Clarke won the award at a gala dinner in Melbourne ahead of batsman Damien Martyn and wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist in a poll conducted among teammates, umpires and media. 

Martyn was named Test Player of the Year and Andrew Symonds the best one-day player, ahead of Clarke and Michael Kasprowicz. 

Discarded international bowler Andy Bichel was named as the leading player from the domestic interstate competition, while former Test wicketkeeper Rod Marsh and the late Clem Hill were inducted into the Australian cricket Hall of Fame. 

Glenn McGrath (2000), Steve Waugh (2001), Matthew Hayden (2002), Gilchrist (2003) and Ricky Ponting (2004) are previous winners of Australian cricket?s most prestigious award. 

At 23, Clarke became the youngest player to win it. He made his one-day International debut against England two years ago and his maiden Test appearance less than four months ago.

 Sporting hold edge vs Fransa

 Dudu Omagbemi 

Margao: A keen tussle is on the cards as Super Cup champions Sporting Clube de Goa take on Fransa in the quarter finals of the Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium here on Monday. 

Sporting, who beat SBT, hold the edge over their rivals in their sharp attack in the form of Dudu Omagbemi and Edeh Chidi. 

With Bibiano Fernandes playing the role of the midfield general along with Joseph Pereira, Nicolau Borges and Nicholas Rodrigues, Fransa defence will have a tough time keeping them at bay. 

Fransa gave a decent performance in the match against Mohammedan Sporting which they won narrowly, but paid a price when their reliable keeper Mark Mascarenhas got the red card for retaliating against Mohammedan player Zubair with a fist blow. Rajat Guha will take his place. 

Surojit Roy, Peter Carvalho and Peter Rodrigues combined well and would once again shore up the attack and blunt the rivals free flowing passes in the middle. 

Sporting president Peter Vaz said his team had not lost against Fransa in the last three years. Our boys played well in the last match, except for Dudu who has not found his form, he added. 

Fransa coach Norbert Gonsalves said it would be a close contest as both teams knew each other. 

Our boys have given good account of themselves in the last match and I feel confident that they will continue to play to their potential and win, he said.

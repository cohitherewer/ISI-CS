 Mahindra aim for a quick kill 

 - FEDERATION CUP 

Margao: Mahindra United need to guard against complacency when they meet a spirited Churchill Brothers in the semi-finals of the Alchemist Federation Cup at Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday. 

Churchill coach Peter Rodrigues said he was happy with his team performance in the last two matches but he also warned his boys not to be complacent. 

There are, however, some injury scares for the Goan outfit. Striker Fredy Mascarenhas, Jagdish Pappaih and Abba Muritala are all doubtful starters because of injuries. 

There is no such injury worry in the Mahindra camp, though. Their coach Derrick Perreira said: All my boys are fit. Churchill are a good side who look motivated after their morale-boosting win against East Bengal. 

And theres no price for guessing that Jose Ramirez Barreto is certainly going to feature in a big way in Perreiras plan. 

All the talks about the Brazilian losing his old touch were put to rest when he inspired the Mumbai side ? including scoring a couple of goals ? to a comfortable 4-2 win over HASC in the quarter final. Mahindra won the tournament last time in 2003.

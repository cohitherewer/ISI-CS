 Sania drawn in Sharapovas quarter

New York: World No. 1 Roger Federer will begin the defence of his US Open crown next week against Ivo Minar of the Czech Republic. 

Womens world No. 1 and top seed Maria Sharapova of Russia faces a tough first-round match against Greek Eleni Daniilidou, while second seed Lindsay Davenport of the US faces Li Na of China. 

Indian hope Sania Mirza, who is in Sharapovas quarter of the draw, will open against world No. 56 Mashona Washington (US). If she wins that one, No. 50 Sania could face 21st seed Dinara Safina. 

Federer, who has won nine titles this year, will be content with his draw although he could meet former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero, the Spanish number 20 seed, in Round IV. 

Russian sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko is drawn to be Federers quarter-final opponent while Australian third seed Lleyton Hewitt, the man Federer beat to win the title at Flushing Meadow last year, is his likely semi-final opponent. 

Andy Roddick and Andre Agassi, the top two American players, were drawn in the opposite half to Federer and could meet in the last four. 

Indian trio up 

At the US Open qualifiers, Shikha Uberoi defeated Yulia Beygelzimer of Ukraine 0-6, 7-5, 6-3 to advance to the next round of womens singles. 

Harsh Mankad cleared the first hurdle beating Tim Snyczek of the US 6-3, 6-2 and Prakash Amritraj beat Nicolas Mahut of France 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. (Agencies)

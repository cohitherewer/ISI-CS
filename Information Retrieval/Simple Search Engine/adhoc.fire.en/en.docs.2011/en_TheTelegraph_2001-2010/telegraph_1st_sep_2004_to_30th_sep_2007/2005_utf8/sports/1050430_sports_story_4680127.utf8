The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harinder causes upset

New Delhi: Rookie Harinder Gupta caused the biggest upset of the day when he stymied top seed Mukesh Kumar?s hopes to qualify for the semi-finals of the SRF all-India matchplay golf championship at the par-72 Delhi Golf Club. 

While the Calcutta gang entertained the crowd with a mixture of tight and easy games, U. S. Mundy showed the exit to citymate Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia winning 1-up. The other Calcuttans? encounter was rather a one-sided affair where Rafiq Ali had an easy win over Nabin Mondal at 5 and 3. 

?I played very well today. My putting was never like this before. The birdie on the 10th brought back my confidence,? said Harinder.

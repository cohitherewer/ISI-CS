Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick rates Sporting Clube de Goa?s attack as the best among the National Football League (NFL) outfits so far. 

?They have tremendous variety in their attack, and so this team can surely be rated the best creative attacking side in this premier competition,? Bhowmick said at the club tent after East Bengal?s one-and-half-hour practice session on Thursday. 

The red-and-gold brigade, who are heading the NFL table with 27 points, will naturally look forward to collect full points from their 13th round tie against the Goan outfit at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

The city giants, it seems, are all set to maintain their winning run, devoid as they are of injury-related or card problems. 

East Bengal are expected field their full-strength side. 

The Goan side, meanwhile, will also try their heart out to snatch points from the league leaders and the defending champions. 

They are on 20 points from 12 matches, and are placed fourth after East Bengal, Dempo SC and Fransa. 

The East Bengal coach had a special mention for Edeh Chidi. ?He is a superb player?? Dudu Omagbemi is the other one to watch out for, he said. 

Though the team was hit by a bus accident in the city and six players were ruled out for the whole tournament, the Goan outfit still managed to rebuild their side after getting permission from the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to register new players in place of injured ones. 

The red-and-golds, on the other hand, are not at all worried about the rain or humidity. 

Subhas Bhowmick?s side, however, are a bit apprehensive about tiredness after having played so many matches in the last few days. 

?Nowadays we don?t have any advantage playing on the slushy grounds,? Bhowmick felt. 

With the red-and-gold?s coach having the proverbial problem of plenty, he is still unsure about the combination of his forward line, who are going to kick off proceedings on Saturday. 

In all probability, it will be a Bhaichung Bhutia-Ernest Jeremiah combination. 

Club sources said the name of Brazilian Juliano Martins won?t figure on the playing list and a decision regarding the Brazilian may be taken on Monday.

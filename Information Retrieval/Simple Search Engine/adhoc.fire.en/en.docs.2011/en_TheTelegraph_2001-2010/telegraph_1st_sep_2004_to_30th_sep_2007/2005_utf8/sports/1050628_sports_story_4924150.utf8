 Davenport conquers Clijsters

 - Venus avenges sisters loss 

London: Top seed Lindsay Davenport outgunned Kim Clijsters at Wimbledon on Monday, winning a ferocious Centre Court battle 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3 to reach the quarter finals. 

Desperate to claim a second title before retiring, the 29-year-old American needed to be at her powerful best to stop the Belgian 15th seed in an hour and 50 minutes. 

 Davenport raced through the opening set in 29 minutes with three breaks of serve. Clijsters hung on grimly in the second set, survived a match-point at 4-5 and then produced some inspired tennis to take it into a decider. 

However, she paid the price for a lapse in concentration at 1-1 in the third, gifting Davenport a break with two wild errors. Davenport broke again to lead 5-2. Clijsters clawed one game back but a double-fault at 3-5 handed Davenport victory and a meeting with Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova who ousted Bulgarian Magdalena Maleeva 6-4, 6-3. 

Three other Russians ? defending champion Maria Sharapova, Nadia Petrova and Anastasia Myskina ? along with a couple of Frenchwomen (Amelie Mauresmo and Mary Pierce) and a second American (Venus Williams) completed the quarter-final line-up. 

Sharapova enjoyed a sun-soaked stroll into the quarters. French pair Mauresmo and the revitalised Pierce also coasted through to the last eight. Second seed Sharapova prevented Nathalie Dechy joining her French compatriots with a 6-4, 6-2 victory on Court One, her fourth consecutive straight-set win. Third seed Mauresmo overcame a wobbly start to beat Russian Elena Likhovtseva 6-4, 6-0. 

Pierce brushed aside Italian Flavia Pennetta 6-3, 6-1 to reach her first Wimbledon quarter final since 1996. 

Twice former winner Venus Williams avenged sister Serenas shock third-round loss to fellow-American Jill Craybas by thrashing the 30-year-old 6-0, 6-2. Myskina edged out fellow-Russian Elena Dementieva 1-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 and Nadia Petrova battled past Kveta Peschke 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (9-7), 6-3. 

In mens action, second seed Andy Roddick overwhelmed Argentine Guillermo Coria 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4. Feliciano Lopez became the first Spaniard in 33 years to reach the mens quarters when he knocked out last years semi-finalist Mario Ancic, the 10th seed, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the last eight of a Grand Slam for the first time. 

The left-hander will face Australian third seed Lleyton Hewitt. Hewitt, the 2002 champion, needed to fire on all cylinders to outgun the big-serving Taylor Dent 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 6-3. 

Hewitt, who advanced to his third Wimbledon quarter final, received a warning for verbal abuse in the sixth game of the second set when he twice questioned a line call and then squandered a 5-3 lead in the third set tie-break. 

Richard Gasquet, the 19-year-old Frenchman, proved no match for 2002 runner-up David Nalbandian of Argentina. Gasquet has enjoyed his best run at a Grand Slam so far but he was swept aside 4-6, 6-7, 0-6 by 18th seed Nalbandian.

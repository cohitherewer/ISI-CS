 Raikkonen keeps Alonso waiting

Spa-Francorchamps: McLarens Kimi Raikkonen won the Belgian Grand Prix for the second year in a row on Sunday to keep Renaults Fernando Alonso waiting for the Formula One title. 

Spaniard Alonso, who needed to beat the Finn by four points to become the sports youngest champion at the age of 24, crossed the line second after McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya crashed three laps from the end. 

Alonso now heads for Brazil in two weeks time with every hope of being crowned there. He has a comfortable 25 point lead and three races remaining. 

The Spaniard has 111 points to Raikkonens 86 and a third place will be enough at Interlagos even if the Finn wins again. Both have won six times this year. 

Until Montoya crashed, McLaren were heading for their first one-two finish in five years as well as the overall lead in the constructors championship. 

It was the second time in three races that Montoya had lost second place, and given Alonso points on a plate, while heading for a one-two. 

Renault are six points clear of McLaren in the constructors championship, the French team also failing to get both cars to the finish when Italian Giancarlo Fisichella crashed out on the 11th of 44 laps. 

McLaren have now won four races in a row, however. 

 With expected heavy rain holding off but the track still damp and treacherous, Montoya led from pole position and stayed ahead until the final pitstops when, as expected, Raikkonen took over in front. 

The Colombian had said before the start that he would help his teammate, while McLaren had made their intentions quite clear. 

Briton Jenson Button was third for BAR, ahead of Australian Mark Webber in a Williams and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari. 

Canadian Jacques Villeneuve was sixth in a Sauber, with Toyotas Ralf Schumacher seventh after running close to Montoya in second place before a disastrous attempt to switch to dry tyres backfired. 

Portugals Tiago Monteiro took the final point for Jordan, while teammate Narain Karthikeyan of India finished 11th. 

Ferraris seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, already out of contention after failing to score in the two previous races, completed a dismal hattrick with another retirement after 14 laps. 

The German, who struggled early on with dry tyres on a slippery surface, was rammed in the rear by BARs Takuma Sato after the safety car went in and was clearly furious with the erratic Japanese. 

Weve often experienced Hara-Kiri reactions from him in the past and that was another one today, Schumacher fumed. Weve talked to him about it in the past. I dont know what sort of therapy might help him. 

Sato said the conditions were very tricky: I locked up the brakes and didnt have the stopping distance.

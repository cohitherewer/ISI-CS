 Acid test for us: Bhowmick 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick feels East Bengal have been thrown into an ?acid test? following the 0-1 loss to Fransa FC on Tuesday. 

?We are in trouble now and we?ve to get out of this. This is an acid test for us. It remains to be seen whether we can survive this or not,? Bhowmick said after the match. 

Describing the loss as ?a big jolt?, which forced East Bengal to concede the one-point lead to Dempo SC, Bhowmick lamented that the team was tired and failed to produce any wing play. 

Fransa coach Norbert Gonsalves, meanwhile, hoped that their victory would open the competition and inspire the fellow Goan teams in their title-bid. ?I hope our victory will help teams like Dempo and Sporting come out on top,? he said.

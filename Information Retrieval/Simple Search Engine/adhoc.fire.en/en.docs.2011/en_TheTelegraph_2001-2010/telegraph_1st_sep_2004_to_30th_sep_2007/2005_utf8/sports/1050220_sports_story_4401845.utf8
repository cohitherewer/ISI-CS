 Doha: Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova has recovered from the illness that forced her to pull out of the Paris Open and is fit for the WTA event in Qatar that starts on Monday.

 ?I was sick, down with the ?flu and an upper respiratory illness. That?s why I pulled out of the Paris Open, but now I have recovered,? the Russian world No. 4 said on her arrival in Doha on Saturday.

 Sharapova?s main challenge in the Qatar Open is likely to come from France?s world No. 2 Amelie Mauresmo, and fellow-Russian Anastasia Myskina, champion in Doha for the last two years.

 Toronto: Vijai Singh, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Retief Goosen are the top four seeds for the World Golf Championships (WGC) match play event in Carlsbad, California, next week, tournament organisers said on Friday. The elite 64-man field will be divided into four brackets and seeded one to 16 with the top-ranked golfer facing off against the lowest-rated player in a straight knockout format.

 As the current world No. 1, Fiji?s Singh will face Japan?s Shingo Katayama in his opening match. Defending champion Woods, who could reclaim top spot at this week?s Nissan Open, will play Zimbabwe?s Nick Price, while Mickelson will take on fellow- American Loren Roberts. South Africa?s Goosen is scheduled to play Australia?s Stephen Leaney.

 Sogwipo: Brazilian striker Nadson scored twice as South Korea?s Suwon Bluewings beat Japan?s Yokohama F-Marinos 3-1 to win the East Asian Champions Cup on Saturday. Nadson?s six goals earned him player of the tournament honours as K-League champions Suwon finished unbeaten with seven points.

 Nadson put Suwon in front in the 16th minute on the South Korean resort island of Cheju. New signing Hideo Oshima levelled for Yokohama with a clinical finish four minutes later. But Kim Dong-hyeon took advantage of sloppy Yokohama defending to scramble Suwon?s second six minutes into the second half.

 Nadson latched on to a clever pass from South Korea international Kim Nam-il to seal victory in the 85th minute.

 Jaipur: The condition of polo player Shivraj Singh, who suffered serious head injuries after falling from his horse during a match on Friday, was stable but he continued to be in a coma, doctors attending to him said.

 The swelling on his brain had reduced after treatment, the doctors said, adding that they would wait for another 48 hours for it to recede further before deciding if any operation was required. 

 Tashkent: A court in Uzbekistan on Friday sentenced a taekwondo world champion to six years in jail after finding him guilty of religious extremism, his lawyer said.

 A district court in capital Tashkent found Elmurod Nurakhunov, 27, and two other defendants guilty of belonging to the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect of Islam, said defence lawyer Khurshid Azimov. 

 All three men denied the charges. Nurakhunov won the world title in 1999.

 Sydney: World junior cycling champion Thomas Geraint was recovering in hospital on Saturday after having his spleen removed following a freak training accident.

 Pakistan pacers cherish stint

Chennai: Pakistan bowlers said they were thrilled to have learnt new methods in pace bowling under the watchful eyes of Dennis Lillee at the MRF Pace Foundation here. 

We learnt a few new things on bowling action, technical methods of delivery of the ball and how to generate more pace. We are now able to bowl more faster, run in quicker and improve our landing techniques, they said. 

Mohammed Khalil and his three compatriots ? Mohammed Asif, Riaz Afridi (who have both played for Pakistan) and Mohammed Irshad ? were all enthusiastic about their experience at the foundation. 

An elated Khalil said, you must see my new action, with more pace in my bowling. I should be in the team to play against England. I am a completely changed man now. 

Khalil said it was definitely an advantage to have a stint under Lillee, among others. 

Khalil said: I have improved on my endurance. Lillee advised me to concentrate on my bowling action. (PTI)

 Warne spins a new yarn

 Warne wants to have a chat or two with Beckham 

London: Spin wizard Shane Warne, who admits to chasing so many women that his marriage finally buckled, says he would turn down a beautiful woman to be able to bowl England out in the second Test at Edgbaston. 

Ill take cricket every time. Id give up sex to bowl a few more of those balls this summer. Thats for sure, the 35-year-old said, referring to the leg-break that bamboozled Mike Gatting in the 1993 Old Trafford Ashes Test. 

Warnes life has never been the same since and his 589 Test wickets make him unquestionably the greatest spin bowler of all time. Worse still, he says he has done it all on a diet of pizzas and milkshakes. 

My diet is still pizzas, chips, toasted cheese sandwiches and milkshakes, he told a magazine. 

I have the occasional six week burst where I stick to fruit and cereal. It bloody kills me but I guess you have to do it. 

Warne admits he has made many mistakes but never looks back. Ive made some poor choices when Ive had too many but Ive made some when Ive been sober, he says. 

The problem is theres still a big kid inside me who likes to have fun. Maybe I need to grow up... And maybe I dont. 

I may have done a few things differently. But when you are thrust into the limelight at 22, like I was, it can be hard to deal with it in a mature, sensible way, he said. 

You cant describe what that ball to Gatting did. It changed my life forever, on and off the pitch. I started being judged on every move I made. 

But he knocks the women he has dated who have spilled the beans to the newspapers. 

Its poor form for cricketers or celebrities or movie stars that there are so many women out there selling their stories for cash. Its just another form of prostitution. What happens between two people, whoever they are, should stay between them. 

And he recognises a soulmate in England soccer captain David Beckham who has been caught by the tabloids more than once. 

Weve been through a few similar things that Id love to chat to him about over a beer or two, he says. 

But the Australian is in no doubt about his place in crickets Hall of Fame. 

No matter how many more wickets I take, I was voted one of the five best cricketers ever in the Wisden poll by my peers. And they can never take that away from me. 

Meanwhile, in New Delhi, former Pakistan superstar Wasim Akram has said that Warne should relax a bit. Everybody has some fun but to some extent. I would say he is paying the price... he was commenting on Channel Nines decision to snap its contract with Warne over his private life. (Agencies)

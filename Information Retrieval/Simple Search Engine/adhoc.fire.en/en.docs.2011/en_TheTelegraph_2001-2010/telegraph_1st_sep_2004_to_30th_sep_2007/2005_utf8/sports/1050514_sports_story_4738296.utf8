 Langeveldt fined

London: South Africa fast bowler Charl Langeveldt, who took a hattrick in the final over to seal a one-run win over the West Indies in their third one-dayer on Wednesday, has been fined for excessive appealing. 

Langeveldt, who will lose a fifth of his match fee after the ruling by International Cricket Council Match Referee Jeff Crowe, failed to turn around to check the umpires decision after trapping Corey Collymore leg before to settle the game. 

Crowe said in a statement that Langeveldt, albeit emotional in the dramatic moment, had begun celebrating before checking that Collymore had been given out, adding that the bowler pleaded guilty to breaching the rules. (Reuters)

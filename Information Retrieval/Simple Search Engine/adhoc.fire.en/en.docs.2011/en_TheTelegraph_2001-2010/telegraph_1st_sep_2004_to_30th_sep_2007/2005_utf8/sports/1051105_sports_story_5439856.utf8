The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chappell factor behind resurgence

 - Sourav should keep scoring to keep juniors on toes, says Wadekar 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Ajit Wadekar 

Mumbai: Ajit Wadekar feels improved fitness has been the secret of Indias successful run in the one-day series against Sri Lanka. This, coupled with the discipline imposed by Greg Chappell, has worked wonders for the team. 

The guys are extremely fit and it has meant a lot. The Indians have simply outclassed the Lankans in terms of fitness. This has reflected upon the overall performance, leaving the visitors stunned, Wadekar told The Telegraph on Friday. 

I suppose this has been the fittest of the Indian teams in recent memory. Just look at the way the boys are chasing and throwing themselves at everything on the field? Its tremendous. I cant remember any Indian side consistently make the opposition work hard for every run, the former India captain and coach added. 

Wadekar admitted being surprised at this sudden resurgence. The four games in the series have been fabulous for India. It looks a good balanced side and the players are brimming with confidence. 

Everything seems to be clicking. All the hard work put in by Greg is paying dividends. All the players are in good nick. Ajit (Agarkar) picked up five wickets yesterday and he has been bowling well. Juniors like Suresh Raina, Yalaka Venugopal Rao and S. Sreesanth have delivered. Mahendra Singh Dhoni has shown maturity beyond his years, Wadekar explained. 

Sachin Tendulkars presence, too, has worked wonders. With so many juniors in the side, Sachins presence was always going to be important. He is a great inspiration for the youngsters and a source of motivation. Playing alongside a living legend is obviously going to have an effect on the newcomers. His guidance has been of immense help, and being the senior most, he has also contributed to the teams morale, he remarked. 

Despite the 4-0 scoreline in the seven-match series, Wadekar feels there is still room for the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Zaheer Khan. They can still make a comeback. Once failure creeps in, the need to have seniors in the side will arise. 

I still believe Sourav is one of the best one-day players in the world. He will definitely be back. He only has to keep getting the runs and not lose hope. This way he will also keep the juniors on their toes. 

Wadekar wants to credit the coach for the turnaround in Indias fortunes. He has imposed a lot of discipline and accountability. He goes about his task in a very scientific manner. The support staff has also contributed immensely. 

The youngsters temperament has also left him startled. Youngsters possessing talent is nothing rare. But this bunch of guys have shown extraordinary temperament. Dhoni has been amazing. He can handle any situation with a cool head. Hes just brilliant, Wadekar said. 

The bowling, though short on experience, has managed to come clean because of the excellent fielding. The fielders have managed to generate confidence in the bowlers. Great catches have been taken, and it has reflected in the overall showing, he added. 

How does he assess Dravid? Hes improved a lot. All his decisions are clicking. His batting form has been steady. A captains contribution always helps.

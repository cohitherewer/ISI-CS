 Ronaldo denies link with drug trafficker

Rio de Janeiro: Ronaldo reported to police here and denied any link to a suspected drug trafficker who cited the Brazil and Real Madrid star in a conversation secretly taped by the police. 

Ronaldo, who will play for Brazil on Sunday in a World Cup qualifier against Chile, was mentioned in a taped conversation by Amon Lemos, the brother of Ronaldos former girlfriend Livia Lemos. In the tape, Lemos refers to a party in which Ronaldo allegedly consumed drugs. 

Ronaldo did not speak to reporters on Monday, but earlier denied he used drugs or had close contact with Lemos. 

People use your name for their own purposes, trying to get some advantage, he said in a TV interview. 

Ronaldo arrived on Monday from Spain and voluntarily reported to the police drug repression unit in Niteroi, Rios sister city across Guanabara Bay. 

Police inspector Luiz Marcelo Xavier, the head of the drug unit, said Ronaldo was not facing charges and had voluntarily spoken to police as a witness. 

Amon was trying to improve his standing with the gang and used his contact with the player for his own benefit, Xavier said in a televised interview. (AP)

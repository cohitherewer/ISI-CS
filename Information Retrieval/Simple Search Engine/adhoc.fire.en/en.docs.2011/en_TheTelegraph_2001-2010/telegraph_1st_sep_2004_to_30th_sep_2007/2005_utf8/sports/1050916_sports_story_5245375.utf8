 Shah thriving on Azhar tips 

 Owais Shah is County rsquo;s leading run-getter this season

London: Owais Shah, leading run scorer in the English County Championship this season, has brought himself into contention for the England squad that will tour his native Pakistan this winter ? and it is all down to some tips from former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin. 

As a precociously-talented teenager, the Karachi-born Shah was regarded as one of the brightest prospects in English cricket, notably captaining the under-19 side to a World Cup win in 1998. 

But a poor run of form after he broke into Englands senior one-day side resulted in him being cast into the international wilderness two and a half years ago. 

Now 27, Shah has just enjoyed his finest season for Middlesex, hammering a total of 1,656 runs at an average of 69, and is once more knocking on Englands door. 

A real turning point came two years ago when I met Mohammed Azharuddin in India, Shah revealed. He changed some things about my game, just little things, such as getting more side-on with my stance. 

Since then Ive been much more consistent. Ive always scored hundreds, even big ones, but now Ive got the consistency Ive always wanted. 

Shahs 15 previous England appearances brought him only 283 runs at an average of 21.76. 

When it comes to playing for England again I feel that Ive done everything I possibly could to put my name in the hat, he told a daily. 

Middlesex coach John Emburey argued that the much more mature Shah would be a significant asset for England in Pakistan.

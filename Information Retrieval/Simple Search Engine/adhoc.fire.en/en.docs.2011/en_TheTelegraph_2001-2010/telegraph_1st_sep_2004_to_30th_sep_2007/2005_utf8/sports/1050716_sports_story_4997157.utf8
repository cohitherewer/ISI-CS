 Atwal cards 7-under on Day I

 Arjun Atwal is just two shots off the lead

Endicott (New York): Arjun Atwal shot four birdies on either side of the turn on Thursday to finish Day I of the $3 million BC Open with a seven-under 65 and lie in tied-seventh place. 

Atwal had a bogey start on the first at the En-Joie Golf Course but after that did not make a single mistake. 

Rookie Matt Hendrix, in only his fourth start on the PGA Tour, started with a double bogey, but then set the course ablaze with a nine-under 63 that had two eagles on the front nine. 

He was tied for the top place with Glen Day, who also had a nine-under 63. 

Mike Springer, Jason Bohn, Ben Crane and Brenden Pappas were a stroke behind in tied third, while Atwal, Mathias Gronberg, Omar Uresti, Mark Wilson and Chris Smith were tied for seventh, another shot back. 

Atwal started with a bogey on the par-4, but after steadying himself with two pars, he went on a birdie spree with three in a row on the fourth, fifth and sixth. 

Then he added another on eighth to be three-under at the turn. On the back nine, he again birdied the 12th, 13th, 16th and 18th to finish at seven-under 65 for the day. 

Atwal drove well average 316 yards and maintained 86 per accuracy in terms of finding the fairways. He missed just three greens in regulation and needed 25 putts for the round. 

With some of the big names of PGA Tour away at the British Open, this is a great chance for Atwal to run up a good finish and even make a bid for a win, as he lies just two off the lead.

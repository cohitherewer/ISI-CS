 Dravid, Chappell inspect track

New Delhi: The Indian team management on Wednesday closely inspected the Ferozeshah Kotla track, the venue for the second Test against Sri Lanka beginning here on Saturday. 

Indian captain Rahul Dravid, accompanied by coach Greg Chappell, studied the strip and also had a chat with the curator. 

The pitch is fine, Chappell said after spending some time in the middle. 

Asked whether he felt it was good enough to last full five days, Chappell said, I cant comment on that. 

Dravid also refused to say much but did give his thumbs up to the track. Its good, very good, he said. 

Curator Prabir Mukherjee said the track would provide even bounce and the ball would come on nicely to enable the batsmen play their strokes.

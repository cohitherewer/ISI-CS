Calcutta: The National Football League for the ONGC Cup enters its final lap on Wednesday with two big teams involved in a dog-fight to avoid demotion. 

Three-time champions Mohun Bagan and Goan heavyweights Churchill Brothers, having lived through a nightmarish campaign, find themselves on the edge of the cliff. Tied on 22 points, Mohun Bagan have a slight edge in the sense that they have a far better goal difference (15-18 as against 22-32). Simply put, a draw will be enough for Amal Duttas team to escape embarrassment. 

The green-and-maroon fans may have died a hundred deaths already, but the veteran coach is devoid of any tension. At least he is not showing any. 

Relegation is not a worry, it never was from the day I took charge. We are ready for the Churchill test, announced Dutta after Tuesdays morning workout at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

A solitary point would do for Mohun Bagan, but the coach said his team wasnt going to play for a draw. But neither will he focus on all-out attack. 

Well have to play balanced football? all-out attack is hardly prudent in this age. You have to be calculative, said Dutta. Reading between the lines, Mohun Bagan would first be defending their own citadel before looking to raid the enemys. 

For a team which has scored 15 goals in 21 games, the prime weakness is not difficult to spot. Yes, we do have problems in the scoring department, so Ive prepared the team in such a way that midfielders can also take up scoring positions, said Dutta. 

Churchill, on the other hand, have a twin strike-force which can test any defence on a good day. Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu and Brazilian Marcos Parreira have together scored 21 out of Churchills 22 goals. 

Quite typically of his aggressive attitude, Dutta refused to be intimidated by the threat posed by the two foreigners. I wont have anyone man-marking their strikers. You cant afford to have one man assigned to just one rival player. 

The humid conditions, Dutta felt, could trouble Churchill. Like Dempo struggled against East Bengal the other day, Churchill may have a problem with the hunidity. 

One good omen for the struggling ex-champions was the presence of both camps of the faction-ridden administration. 

While secretary Anjan Mitra egged on players to give their best and win on Wednesday, his rival Balaram Chowdhury, the assistant secretary, promised a bonus of Rs 20,000 for every goal scored. 

Churchill have some injury problems, with defenders Roque Baretto, Subhasish Roy Chowdhury and Mir Farooq Haidar all ruled out. Even then, the Goan outfit is determined to pick up three points. 

We will go for a win and I have to score. If I cant score tomorrow, all my 12 previous goals will be meaningless, Yakubu said.

 CAB panel for Paul issue

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The working committee of the CAB has decided to form a three-member panel to take a decision on Aryan Club representative Samar Paul, who made derogatory comments against the association during its AGM in July. 

Discussed at the working committee meeting on Friday, the members were unanimous that Paul shouldnt be let off after he replied to a CAB show-cause, admitting he had made the comments. 

The three-member committee will have the final say. If he is found guilty, he may face suspension for more than a year, a CAB official told The Telegraph on Friday. 

In another decision taken, AN Ghosh Trophy matches will be three-day affairs instead of two. 

The senior and junior selection committees were also formed. The senior committee consists of Pranab Roy, Robin Mukherjee, Jiban Ghosh and Arup Bhattacharya, while the junior comprises Sujan Mukherjee, Arindam Sarkar, Gour Ghosh and Sagarmoy Sen Sharma.

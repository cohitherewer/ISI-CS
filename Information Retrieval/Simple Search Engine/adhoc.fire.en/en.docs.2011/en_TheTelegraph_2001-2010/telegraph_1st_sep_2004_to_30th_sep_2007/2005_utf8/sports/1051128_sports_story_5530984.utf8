 The soul of George Best is still alive

 - Physical courage wasnt half of his bravery... It was courage of his convictions 

Clive Tyldesley

The name of George Best will finally grace the stage that was made for him. The beneficiaries of his inheritance will stand silently in remembrance of a player none of them can remember. But the Premiership casts show of respect should be just that. 

Best was the first superstar of a league in which everybody now thinks he is a superstar. He bequeathed the keys to hundreds of sleek sports cars and mock Tudor mansions to mere mortals. Best was the advance party to the discovery of paradise, the player who transported footballers faces from cigarette cards to bedroom walls and billboards. The original version. 

[Pele and Maradona, ofcourse, have already hailed Best as the best footballer ever]. 

If you were to offer the modern player a transfusion of any one of Bests many talents, there is just a chance that one or two may say his ability to pull the birds. A sad reflection made even sadder by the suspicion that George might actually have taken it as a compliment. Some may already have started to tire of extravagant tributes to a man whose professional conduct fell well below the clean-living standards of most of the top performers of today. So before drooling old fogies like myself lose all our credibility, let me suggest a more fitting legacy from Best to the rest. Courage. 

Courage during Bests playing days involved running at Tommy Smith or Ron Harris without first making provisions for your family. Referees were of the opinion that it was a mans game. And the man they had in mind was a burly bouncer of a centre-half with a licence to tackle from behind and clean his studs on passing wingers. Best put his skin and bones on the line every time he trespassed on to their muddy territory to torment them like a teasing matador. He was rarely injured. If his name was missing from the team-sheet it was because he had been suspended, not upended. Unless he was in Marbella, of course. 

But physical courage wasnt the half of Bests bravery. It was the courage of his convictions that released his powers of skill and athleticism. Im sure Sir Bobby Charltons balding pate is a product of the hairs he tore out watching George disappear into a million cul-de-sacs of selfish indulgence. Equally, Charltons presence alongside Denis Law at the Cromwell Hospital was a tribute to the number of times Best confounded opponents and teammates alike by making the inconceivable look part of the plan. He was impossible. Impossible to daunt or deter. 

This is no time to be making direct comparisons with Wayne Rooney. Manchester United have had far too many new George Bests. But the same fires of self-belief were burning inside Rooney during a lukewarm United display against Villareal on Tuesday.. 

Last Sunday I watched an 18-year- old called Mark Noble take charge on his full Premiership debut. The West Ham midfield player needed a little time to bed in to the match at Tottenham, but once he realised that Edgar Davids was just another opponent, Noble started to demand the ball and dictate the flow of the game. 

Noble and Rooney will observe the minutes silence at Upton Park, then pay their respects by being fearlessly disrespectful of vastly more experienced opponents. 

The spirit of Smith and Harris lingers on to test their bottle. But the precocious soul of Best is still alive inside the pick of todays young players if they can just be brave enough to bare it. Let them think about that when silence descends before kick-off.

 Jeev in tied 15th place

 Jyoti Randhawa has slipped to tied 39th 

Hong Kong: Jeev Milkha Singh shot a flawless four-under 66 that set him up for a good finish at the $1.2 million Hong Kong Open golf meet, but Jyoti Randhawa plummeted down the leaderboard to lie in tied 39th place. 

Jeev, who has been having trouble with his driving, found his touch in time in the third round and his three-day tally of six-under placed him in tied 15th. 

Randhawa, 11th overnight, brought in a two-over round that saw him plummet from four-under to just two-under on aggregate. 

Gaurav Ghei came in with a three-under 67 that push- ed him up from 47th to tied 32nd. 

Shiv Kapur had a two-under 68 that saw him finish at the same score as Ghei. 

Amandeep Johl continued to struggle with the putter as the ball repeatedly lipped out to keep him at one-over 71 and at two-over for tournament in 62nd place. 

Thailand-based Scotsman Simon Yates shot a nine-under 61 and from overnight 20th zoomed to the top of the leaderboard. 

I couldnt miss a shot today, said Yates, whose bogey-free 61 put him at 11-under for the tournament. Yates birdied his last four holes and came through his back nine in a sensational six-under after a 31 in first half. 

2004 runner-up James Kingstons six-under 64 saw him climb to tied second, two shots behind Yates. 

Kingston has Colin Montgomerie, the 2005 European Order of Merit winner, for company. Montgomerie overcame bogeys on ninth and then two more on the 15th and 16th on his way to a four-under 66. 

 Also tied in second is the 30-year-old Swede Martin Erlandsson.

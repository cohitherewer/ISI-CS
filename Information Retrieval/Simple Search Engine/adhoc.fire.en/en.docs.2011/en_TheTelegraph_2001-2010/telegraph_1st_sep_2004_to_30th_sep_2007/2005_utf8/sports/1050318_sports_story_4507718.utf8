 Silver medal for Rathore

New Delhi: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore lost to his coach Australian Mark Russel and settled for the silver in double trap event as India won five medals including a gold by Pemba Tamang in the Commonwealth shooting championships in Melbourne on Thursday. 

With today?s haul, India?s medal tally went up to 11 gold, eight silver and five bronze. 

Tamang tallied 760.6 points (565+195.6) to leave behind Canada?s Melody Igorov 750.6 (559+191.6) and compatriot Vijay Kumar (748.3 (564+184.5) in the men?s rapid fire pistol. 

Russel, who missed the Athens Olympics, scored 134 in the preliminary round and 39 in the final to emerge as runaway winner with a total of 173. Rathore claimed the silver but only after winning a tie-shoot against another Australian Casselle Nathan. 

Rathore (130) was ahead of Nathan (127) after the preliminary round but the Aussie caught up with a score of 41 in the title round to draw level with the Indian, who recorded 38 in the final. 

But Rathore prevailed in the nerve-wracking tie-shoot winning 10-9, the National Rifle Association of India said in a press release. 

The day?s other silver for India was won by Meena Kumari in women?s sports rifle three position with a tally of 661.5 points. England?s Spicer R (669.3) and Sultana S of Bangladesh (656.2) got the gold and bronze, respectively.

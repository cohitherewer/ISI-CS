Melbourne: This wasn?t a game of two halves, but rather, a game of two selves. The injured impostor portraying Serena Williams was slow-moving, slow-serving and almost couldn?t keep a ball in play during the first set of the Australian Open final. Sets 2 and 3 featured the tenacious Serena, the one who dominated the sport a couple of years ago. 

Confusion reigned at Rod Laver Arena. And ultimately, so did the second Serena. The seventh-seeded Williams won her second Australian Open singles title, and her first Grand Slam championship in 18 months, defeating No. 1 Lindsay Davenport of Laguna Beach 2-6, 6-3, 6-0, in one hour and 29 minutes at Melbourne Park. 

In the first set, Williams left the court for several minutes, requiring treatment for what she said was an injured back. It was the seventh Grand Slam singles title for Williams and the first since she had knee surgery in August 2003, which forced her to miss the Australian Open last year. The last Slam she won was Wimbledon in 2003 in front of family and friends, including her older half-sister, Yetunde, who was killed in a shooting in Los Angeles a few months later. 

Two games in the second set stood out as turning points in the match. Williams saved six break points in the fifth game to stay in contention. Davenport?s downfall began in the eighth game, serving at 3-4, when she took a 40-0 lead and, with plenty of time, hit a routine cross-court back hand wide. 

Williams pulled to deuce and ended up getting the break when Davenport double faulted. ?I felt like I was playing well and in control,? said Davenport, who had seven aces and eight double faults. 

Still, she had faced more difficult predicaments in Melbourne. Williams saved three match points in her semi-final against Maria Sharapova of Russia, and finally won it, 8-6, in the third set. Two years ago, she saved two match points in her semi-final and went on to win the title. 

Today, she had to leave the court while trailing, 1-4, in the first set for treatment of her injury. Williams said she felt the pain when she went to reach for a backhand. Off the court, the trainers manipulated herand put Williams back together again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal wary of Dias

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Steven Dias is going to feature on top of coach Aloke Mukherjees men-to-be-watched-for list ahead of Bengals first match against Maharashtra in the Santosh Trophy quarter final league on Sunday. 

Dias played a stellar role in Maharshtras 5-3 win over Services at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Friday. Kerala scraped past Uttar Pradesh 1-0 ? thanks to Abdul Hakkims 71st minute goal ? in the days earlier match. 

Mukherjee led his wards to a practice session in the morning, and then to the stadium, to gauge the opponents strengths and weaknesses. 

Steven is the key man for Maharashtra and we cant allow him to move around freely on Sunday, Mukherjee said from Kochi after watching the match. We know that Abhishek (Yadav) is a tall guy and can make good use of crosses from the flanks, sent in by Dias, Mukherjee pointed out. But our strikers have to keep the Maharshtra defence under constant pressure, he added. 

Bengal will have a first taste of the ground when they go there for another round of practice on Saturday morning. But Mukherjee doesnt see any chance of right-back Subhas Chakraborty recovering for the match. Hes doubtful against Services as well, he said. 

The coach, however, is not sure whether Madhab Das and Noel Wilson, suffering from hamstring injuries, will be fit for Sundays match. 

People say Ive come here with a star-studded squad. I know it alone how fallacious this is in reality. I could not get Bhaichung Bhutia. Mehtab Hussain is supposed to join us on Sunday but I dont know if its possible at all, he said.

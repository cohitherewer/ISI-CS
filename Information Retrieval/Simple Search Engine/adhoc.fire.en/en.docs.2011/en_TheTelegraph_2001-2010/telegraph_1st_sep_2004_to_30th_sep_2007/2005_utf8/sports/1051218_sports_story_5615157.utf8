The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Disquiet may dilute Indias focus

 Straight Talk 

 Arjuna Ranatunga

 Sangakkara would have to bat through

 The one thing that has struck 

 me about the Sri Lankans is the rather paperweight line-up 

 in the lower half of their batting. The Indians know it, 

 as I suspect Lankans too, that if the top three of the visitors 

 are taken care of, Anil Kumble and company can run riot. 

 The middle order has been fluffy 

 and the likes of Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralidharan and 

 Dilhara Fernando can only throw their bats in hope. Who 

 would then score the runs?

 It is an issue, which would not 

 go away in a hurry. It perhaps was the reason why Atapattu 

 came down the order in Chennai. In the next Test, it was 

 return to convention and the lower half could not cope up 

 with the quality of the Indian bowling.

 Sri Lanka would have to scatter 

 their resources to have an experienced hand at the lower 

 half. Or one of the top men would have to bat through. There 

 is just no other alternative.

 Kumar Sangakkara is the obvious 

 choice since Atapattu has had two impressive 50s at the 

 top of the order. Mahela Jayawardene too promised stability 

 before his rush of blood hurt the team critically in Kotla. 

 Sangakkara can shepherd the rather inexperienced middle 

 order and its an option which the visitors could consider 

 in Ahmedabad.

 Conversely, the Sri Lankans could 

 show trust in the Samaraweeras and Dilshans to come good. 

 Sometimes it is best to throw a rookie in the deep end of 

 the pool to learn the ropes. However, realism rather than 

 hope should guide plans when it is Kumble who is waiting 

 for his next delivery at the top of his run up.

 For despite Muralidharans 

 class show in Kotla, I suspect the Indians are not spending 

 sleepless nights at the prospect of facing the off-spinner.

 There is too much depth and variety 

 in Indian line-up to worry overtly about Murali or Vaas. 

 Its a line up which is perfectly capable of two quality 

 partnerships to take shape any time. Often, as we have seen, 

 only a couple of good stands are proving enough to rock 

 the Lankan boat.

 The Lankans not only have to worry 

 about the outcome of the final Test, they also want to depart 

 with the feeling that a few of their critical areas are 

 now under repair.

 It is good to know that you still 

 have seniors pulling their weight in teams cause but 

 its not an indication of teams health. 

 The team is in shape only if the 

 younger lots are ready to take over the mantle. Sadly, this 

 present Lankan team does not inspire such a belief.

 The Lankans, though, would be 

 looking for signs of disquiet in the Indian dressing room. 

 When so much is brewing around the omission of a man in 

 the country, with all kind of important voices coming from 

 the highest seat of Indian democracy, dressing room is not 

 a strong enough citadel for people inside not to feel under 

 siege.

 It could dilute the teams 

 focus. It is a strange situation to be in for a team which 

 is entering the fray as victors from the previous Test.

 Unlike the visitors, Indians have 

 the advantage of attending to their weaker areas in time. 

 It is an advantage which a host team always has. So promptly 

 comes in Wasim Jaffer to see if the situation of asking 

 Pathans to open the innings can be avoided.

 India, all through in the one-dayers 

 and now in Tests, have appeared to be a team on the move. 

 The hosts have more or less appeared in control but there 

 are always sideways glances at their fast bowling options. 

 Both Pathan and Ajit Agarkar did what they could in Kotla 

 but still the team can do with some firepower in the pace 

 department.

 Indians are unlikely to go in 

 the Test with five bowlers but knowing the state of Ahmedabad 

 pitch, its an option worth considering. Like Jaffer, 

 it could perk up a V.R.V. Singh or an R.P. Singh.

 Or may be the Indians feel a Kumble 

 is all they need against the Lankans! (PTI)

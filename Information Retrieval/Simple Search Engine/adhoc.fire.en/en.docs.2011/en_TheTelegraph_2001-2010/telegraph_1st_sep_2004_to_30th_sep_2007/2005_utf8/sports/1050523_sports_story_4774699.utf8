 Mauresmo grapples with home jinx

Paris: Amelie Mauresmo has tried to play down the Yannick Noah effect as she sets her sights on breaking her Roland Garros jinx at the French Open which starts Monday. 

Mauresmo, who briefly rose to world No.1 late last year, has been touted as a potential winner here. But she has failed to deliver at Roland Garros since, let down by a fragile temperament that has buckled under the weight of expectations. 

Thus Noah, the hugely-popular winner of the 1983 mens singles title, has been brought in to sit down with Mauresmo and basically get her head straight. 

The dreadlocked Noah is seen as a master motivator, but Mauresmo insists that there is no quick fix to her shortcomings here. There is no magic wand, said Mauresmo, who is seeded three. 

The Mauresmo enigma is just one of many imponderables in what is gearing up to be one of the most open womens tournaments for years at Roland Garros. 

The Belgian pair Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters, both of whom have clawed their way back from debilitating injuries, cannot be ruled out. Venus Williams comes into the French Open buoyed by winning the inaugural Istanbul Cup Saturday. 

World No.1 Lindsay Davenport will head to Paris with no great ambitions. 

That leaves the Russian Armada who were the shock troopers of last years tournament when Anastasia Myskina defeated Elena Dementieva in a one-sided final. 

Myskina looks unlikely to repeat the dose this year and Dementieva is also carrying an injury, while Maria Sharapova admits she is still learning how to play on a surface which is not suited to her battering ram style of play. 

Best bet among them could be Svetlana Kuznetsova.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Azad agrees with Wright 

New Delhi: Former national selector Kirti Azad came out in support of outgoing Indian coach John Wright saying it was high time that the selection process was made more professional and the selectors accountable. 

[Wright, it may be recalled, had told The Telegraph hours before ending his India innings: ?I appreciate they (the selectors) come under pressure, but only the best team must be picked... I can?t say the Australian or the model followed by England is ideal, but the Board should close the zone-wise selectors? chapter. It may have been useful, but isn?t so now.?] 

?I totally agree that the selection process should be made more professional and even the selectors be made more accountable,? Azad said. 

Azad supported the view that the zonal system of appointing selectors should be done away with and only a three-member panel should be formed. 

?You can give them a fixed tenure and have a system of reviewing their performance every six months,? he added. 

Former Indian spinner Maninder Singh also came down heavily on the zonal system of appointing selectors and said having a paid panel was the only solution. 

?I have heard a few selectors boasting of how many players from their zone have played for the country during their tenure. This is not the right way of selecting a team. We should have a paid selection committee and should be held responsible for the team?s performance.? 

The two former cricketers were also critical of the role of the Indian Cricket Players? Association. (PTI)

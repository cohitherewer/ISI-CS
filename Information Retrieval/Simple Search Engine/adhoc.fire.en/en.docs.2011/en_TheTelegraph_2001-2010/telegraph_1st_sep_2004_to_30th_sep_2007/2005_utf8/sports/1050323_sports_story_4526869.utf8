 Prasad bids adieu to cricket

Bangalore: Seamer Venkatesh Prasad announced his retirement from cricket on Tuesday, ending a career during which he played 33 Tests and 161 one-dayers for the country. 

Prasad, who formed a formidable bowling partnership with his statemate Jawagal Srinath in the late 90s, took 96 wickets in Test matches. In one-dayers, he finished four short of the 200-mark. 

The lanky seamer from Bangalore last played for India in October 2001 against Kenya in the Standard Bank tri-series in South Africa. The 35-year-old Prasad announced his retirement at a press conference in the presence of Indian stalwarts Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble. 

Prasad made his one-day debut against New Zealand in 1994 and played his first Test against England two years later. His best bowling in ODIs, five for 27, came against Pakistan while his best effort in Test cricket was six for 33. 

A Level III coach, Prasad said he wanted to pursue his career in coaching. He is currently a coach at the National Cricket Academy here.

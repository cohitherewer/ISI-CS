Ponte Vedra Beach (Florida): American Fred Funk overcame difficult, windy conditions to become the oldest winner of the prestigious Players? Championship with a one-shot victory on Monday. 

The 48-year-old, four strokes off the pace going into the rain-delayed final round, fired a one-under 71 to clinch his seventh career PGA Tour title. 

Funk mixed five birdies with four bogeys on a windy day to finish at nine-under 279, one ahead of Tom Lehman (68), Scott Verplank (70) and Luke Donald (76). 

?I?m speechless right now, I didn?t fathom this happening,? Funk said after holing a five-foot putt for par at the final hole to win golf?s unofficial fifth major. ?I can?t believe I won this thing, it?s the biggest win by far that I?ve ever had.? 

Briton Donald, co-leader overnight with American Joe Durant at 11 under, held his nerve after double-bogeying the par-four 14th to stay ahead. But he bogeyed the opening hole in the final round and an outward nine of 40 effectively ended his bid for a second PGA Tour title. 

Australia?s Adam Scott returned successive 73s to end up in a tie for eighth at five-under 283. 

None of golf?s so-called ?Big Four? flourished on the fifth day, world No. 1 Vijai Singh producing the best finish with a final-round 72 and a share of 12th at four-under 284. That was good enough, though, for the Fijian to retain his status as the game?s leading player by finishing ahead of Tiger Woods. 

South Africa?s Ernie Els carded a 69, his best round of the week, for a 72-hole total of three-under 285 while US Masters champion Phil Mickelson battled to a 75 for a share of 40th at two over. 

Woods finished a further three strokes back after returning a second successive 75.

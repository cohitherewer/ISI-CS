 Stevens up 

Sheffield: Matthew Stevens brushed aside qualifier Andy Hicks to book his place in the second round of the world billiards championship at the Crucible Theatre on Sunday. 

Welshman Stevens, ranked sixth in the world, trailed briefly when Hicks compiled a break of 105 in the fifth frame to take a 3-2 lead. 

However, Hicks failed to take his chances and Stevens sealed a comfortable 10-5 win.

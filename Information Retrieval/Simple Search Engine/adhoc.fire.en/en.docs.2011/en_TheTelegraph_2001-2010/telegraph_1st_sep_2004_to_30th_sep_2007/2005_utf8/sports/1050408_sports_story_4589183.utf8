 Live Delhi ?off course? in RCTC from today 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Delhi Race Club (DRC) begins its business in RCTC with the live telecast of it?s programmes and, of course, inter-venue betting. There may not be much enthusiasm among the RCTC punters but the Delhi-based senior trainers are prepared to bet that it will catch on. ?Our racing is certainly better than your?s (RCTC?s). Just wait and watch,? said one of the leading trainer from Delhi when contacted over the phone.

 The DRC has a mile racecourse with two tracks ? the race grass and the inner sand strip for workouts. Both tracks are, however, very fast and the local professionals advised against going overboard unless track timings are between -10 (sand) or -12 (grass) range. For a starter, a leading Delhi trackman suggested three good bets in the six event card ? Cozy Boy, Evidence Of You and King Of Mohra.

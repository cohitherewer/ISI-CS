 Randhawa best

Bangalore: A two-over final round did not stop Jyoti Randhawa, who steamrolled his way to victory in the Hero Honda Open South at the Karnataka Golf Association here on Friday. 

Playing in his first event on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour since the 2003 Kashmir Open, Randhawa won with a massive six shot margin, pocketing a Rs 1,89,840. The ace golfer finished five-under par 283 for a satisfying finish even by his standard. 

Mukesh Kumar, the 2005 Amby Valley champion golfer of the year and current order of merit leader, failed to make the final day charge, finishing with a dismal two-over 74. 

However, he finished second, complimenting his last week victory at the Hyundai TNGF Open in Chennai. Kumar continues to lead the Amby Valley PGAI Tours order of merit for 2005-06 with total earning of Rs 2,88,640 in two events. 

Digvijay Singh finished third, while C. Muniyappa was tied fourth along with Pakistans Matloob Rana.

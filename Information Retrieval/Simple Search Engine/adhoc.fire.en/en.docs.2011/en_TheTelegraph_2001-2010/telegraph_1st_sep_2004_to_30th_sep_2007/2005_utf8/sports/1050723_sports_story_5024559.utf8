 Sydney: PSV Eindhoven coach Guus Hiddink was named Australia?s coach on Friday and immediately warned that his past success would not guarantee qualification for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany. He will remain in charge of his Dutch club while he prepares the Socceroos for their final qualifiers against the Solomon Islands in September. The winner of that play-off will face the fifth-placed South American team for a berth in Germany.

 ?Coming here now, with my past, it is not a guarantee for success,? Hiddink said at a news conference in Sydney. ?The only thing I can contribute, with all my efforts, is some knowledge and experience. In the end the players have to do it.?

 London: Uefa have received five bids to host the European soccer championship in 2012, European soccer?s governing body announced in a statement on Friday. They comprise joint bids from Croatia-Hungary and Poland-Ukraine and single bids from Greece, Italy and Turkey.

 The five candidatures will be reduced to a short-list of three on November 7 and the decision on who will host the event will be taken in December 2006.

 Sydney: London?s successful 2012 Olympic bid chairman Sebastian Coe has been employed as a paid consultant by Melbourne?s 2006 Commonwealth Games organisers to try to attract athletes to the event next March. ?He travels around to all these countries talking to the athletes,? 2006 Games chairman Ron Walker said on Friday. ?In order to help our ticket sales we?ve got to produce the superstars and that?s exactly what Seb is doing.?

 Durban: South African cricket star Jacques Kallis will mark his benefit year in 2005 with the launch of a scholarship foundation, which will create opportunities for talented young cricketers in South Africa.

 Kallis announced the formation of the Jacques Kallis Scholarship Foundation earlier this week. A percentage of the proceeds from Kallis? benefit events will be allocated towards the foundation.

 ?Cricket has given me so many great opportunities and it has always been one of my ambitions to put something back into the game,? he said.

 London: Briton Dan Wheldon says two Formula One teams have expressed an interest in him since he won the Indy 500 in May. ?I was approached by two teams, one pretty strong,? a Detroit newspaper on Thursday quoted him as telling reporters. ?We?re still in talks about next season.? The Grand Prix team most likely to be interested in him would be BAR, who will have a vacancy if Briton Jenson Button leaves for Williams.

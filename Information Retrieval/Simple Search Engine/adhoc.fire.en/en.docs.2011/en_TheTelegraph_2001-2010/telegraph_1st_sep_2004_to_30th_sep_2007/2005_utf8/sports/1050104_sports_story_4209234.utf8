The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rohan quits as captain

 - Devang likely to succeed 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Rohan Gavaskar 

Calcutta: Rohan Gavaskar, criticised from all corners for Bengal?s dismal show in the Ranji Trophy this season, has resigned from captaincy after the team barely managed to keep its berth in the Elite group after collecting two crucial points against Madhya Pradesh at the Eden on Monday. 

?I have submitted my resignation as Bengal need some fresh ideas from a new leader,? Gavaskar said. 

Now question doing the rounds in CAB is who will replace Rohan? The fight is mainly between two Bengal players who were successful in the match against Madhya Pradesh ? Devang Gandhi and Laxmi Ratan Shukla. 

?It?s a toss up between them, but as of now Devang has the edge,? a CAB official said. ?Devang has previously led the side which now needs an experienced captain to guide the youngsters. So, Devang seems to be the likely choice,? he added. 

But the circumstances under which Rohan resigned from captaincy came as a surprise to CAB officials and players alike. ?I was surprised when Rohan submitted his resignation,? admitted a team member. Rohan maintained he will play for Bengal in the one-dayers, provided he gets fit. ?I am leaving for Mumbai Monday evening and will be back before the one-dayers,? he said. 

Rohan, when asked about the junior players? performance, said there are many talented players, but that they need more experience. However, Gavaskar junior didn?t agree that the team needed Sourav Ganguly, Utpal Chatterjee and Devang Gandhi?s help to bail them out. 

?Sourav and Devang are part of the squad, though Sourav doesn?t get chance to play often. Only Utpal was included to bolster the bowling,? he remarked. 

Rohan, who has scored more than 450 runs this season, 

said he now wants to concentrate more on batting and serve Bengal better in the 

future. He also praised Laxmi Ratan Shukla for his brilliant 81 on the final day.

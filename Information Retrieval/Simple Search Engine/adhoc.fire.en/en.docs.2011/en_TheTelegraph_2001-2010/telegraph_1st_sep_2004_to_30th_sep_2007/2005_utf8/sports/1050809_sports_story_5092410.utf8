The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Flintoff showed the steel of a champion

Guest Column 

Geoff Boycott

 After England were beaten so badly 

 at Lords, I called for them to show a bit of character 

 in this match. Not ability, character. And how they produced 

 it to snatch this game at the death. They almost lost it 

 ? but who the hell cares? The score is 1-1, and the crucial 

 point is that England now know they can beat Australia.

 Who needs one-day cricket when 

 these teams are scoring five runs an over? This Test was 

 fast, frenetic, exciting, emotional, thrilling, wonderful 

 entertainment. And at the top of the bill was Freddie Flintoff.

 He is an automatic choice for 

 the world XI at the moment, along with Steve Harmison ? 

 and both would walk into the Australian team.

 Flintoff likes to think of himself 

 as a batting allrounder who bowls. I dont know how 

 to pigeonhole him, except that his bowling and his batting 

 are both matchwinning.

 His stand of 51 with Simon Jones 

 was the decisive part of the game for England. Without that 

 they would have lost the match. Then, when they looked in 

 trouble on Saturday, Flintoff was the one who ripped Justin 

 Langer and Ricky Ponting out in one over.

 If England had lost the Test, 

 the effect would have been demoralising. Only one team have 

 come back from 0-2 down in the Ashes to win the next three 

 games. That was in Australia in 1936, in Don Bradmans 

 first series as captain, when Gubby Allens England 

 won the first two games. As good as this England team is, 

 we dont have a Bradman to work miracles for us.

 It was vitally important for English 

 cricket to keep the series alive, and to keep cricket at 

 the forefront of peoples minds. The Premiership starts 

 next week, but at least England have now given themselves 

 a chance to stay in the headlines.

 Australia are vulnerable without 

 Glenn McGrath and if England bat well at Old Trafford, they 

 can exploit that again.

 The Aussie seamers were ineffective 

 in this match, apart from that one spell when Brett Lee 

 took three wickets on Saturday morning. Jason Gillespie 

 looks a shadow of himself and Michael Kasprowicz is straight 

 up and down.

 Even Lee had only that one spell; 

 for the rest of the time he gives you a lot of runs. He 

 doesnt have the control of the great fast bowlers. 

 If that is the best Australia have got without McGrath, 

 England have nothing to fear from this seam attack.

 There was only thing I was puzzled 

 about Sunday morning. When England got stuck, and couldnt 

 seem to buy a wicket, why didnt Flintoff go around 

 the wicket to Kasprowicz? He was moving to the off-side, 

 both to get out of the way of the short stuff and to help 

 everything around to leg. If Flintoff had come around and 

 Kasprowicz had still gone to the off-side, he would have 

 had a clear shot at all three stumps and maybe could have 

 bowled him around his legs.

 But give full credit to the Aussie 

 tailenders. They were carefree at first, batting with nothing 

 to lose. Shane Warne and Lee played some really good shots 

 and, from Englands point of view, runs were coming 

 too easily.

 Warne had an outstanding match, 

 taking 10 wickets and making a fine contribution with the 

 bat. As for Lee, for a tailender that has to be one of the 

 best innings Ive ever seen. He was made to duck and 

 weave, and took some blows on the hands and body. Which 

 is as it should be: if you dish it out, you have to be able 

 to take some in return.

 I take my hat off to his character, 

 courage and ability. He nearly won the match for Australia. 

 And of all the wonderful things to come out of this match, 

 the nicest was that as soon as had England had won, Flintoff 

 went straight over to Lee to congratulate him on his efforts.

 Flintoff had been trying to knock 

 his head off all morning, remember. But before jumping up 

 and down in euphoria, he made sure he saluted a brave opponent.

 That was a great piece of sportsmanship. 

 Cricket should be played hard, but when its all finished, 

 it is great to see that kind of spirit from the players.

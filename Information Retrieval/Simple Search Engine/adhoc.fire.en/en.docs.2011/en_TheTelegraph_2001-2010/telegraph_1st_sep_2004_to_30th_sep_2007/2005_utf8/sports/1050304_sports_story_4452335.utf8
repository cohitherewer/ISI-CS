The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India are 

favourites, says Sunny

New Delhi: Sunil Gavaskar feels India start favourites in the series vs Pakistan, because the hosts have a more balanced side. 

?The Indian team is strong and has home advantage. We have a good bowling attack and we certainly have a well balanced team,? Gavaskar told reporters on the sidelines of a promotional function here Thursday. ?I don?t know much about the Pakistan team except for a couple of players,? he said. 

However, Gavaskar dismissed claims that none on either side will be under pressure during the series. ?I think however much we try to play it down, the pressure will be incredible. The pressure of expectation is unbelievable. 

?India versus Pakistan series is always extraordinary and it is hard to describe. You may fail against any team, but certainly not against Pakistan,? Gavaskar said. 

The former India captain said India must display the same level of performance that they showed in Pakistan to emerge winners in the series. 

?They played wonderfully well in Pakistan last year. But the level dropped a little in October against Australia. The players, however, again picked themselves up against South Africa. 

?The lessons learn against Australia must be put into use against Pakistan.? 

On Sachin Tendulkar returning to action, Gavaskar said the Little Master would not be rusty despite the break. ?He is such a class player. He has got a lot of experience. So getting into the groove would not be a problem for him,? he said. 

On the composition of the side for the first Test, starting in Mohali from March 8, Gavaskar said India should play three seamers. (PTI)

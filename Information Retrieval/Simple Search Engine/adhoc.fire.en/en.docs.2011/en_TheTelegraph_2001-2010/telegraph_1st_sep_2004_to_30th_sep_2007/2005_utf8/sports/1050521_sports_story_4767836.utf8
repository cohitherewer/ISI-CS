 Smith denies role in Arthur appointment

 Smith says new coach is a disciplined man 

Durban: Graeme Smith, known for his run-ins with Ray Jennings, said on Friday he had no input in the appointment of Mickey Arthur as South Africas new coach. 

Jennings and I didnt see eye-to-eye on certain things, and we had the odd run-in now and then, but thats a natural part of the captain-coach relationship. Its good to have those challenges, Smith said. 

But I didnt have anything to do with the appointment of Mickey Arthur, he said in a radio interview after it was announced that Arthurs appointment had received the support of all players. 

The team had just returned from a very successful tour of the West Indies under Jennings, who had expressed the desire to retain the job but was replaced by the little-known Arthur on Thursday. 

The youngest South African skipper said with the new coach, the team would have a definite plan to move forward. 

The team is comfortable with the process that has been followed to pick the new coach. Now we have a definite plan going forward. 

Smith said he had not known Arthur for long but was impressed with the approach of the 37-year-old during the short while he had been involved with the new man. 

Hes definitely not a soft touch. I was impressed with his work ethic. Hes a disciplined man. His man-management is a key component of his make-up as a coach, Smith said. 

Arthur would have three months to prepare for a major tour.

 India stay in third spot

London: India aggregated their highest points tally to remain in the third position of the ICCs Test championship with Australia recording a new high following the annual update. 

Australia, England and India all improved their ratings with the World Champions securing the highest Test rating since a new system of calculation was introduced in June 2003. 

Their rating of 133 is one point higher than it was before the update and it can improve up to 138 if they beat England 5-0 in the ongoing Ashes. 

Series played before August 1, 2002 no longer count towards the Test rankings, the ICC said in a release here. 

England lost to Australia and India and drew with New Zealand during this period so the loss of these series from the calculation has helped England improve their rating by three points to 114. 

If they were to lose to Australia by the same 4-1 margin as in 2001 in the current series their rating would fall back to 111. India lost three away series ? to Sri Lanka, South Africa and the West Indies ? between August 1, 2001 and July 31, 2002, therefore benefiting by four points as a result of the update. 

Their rating of 111 is their highest since the new system came into force. 

The ratings of the sides ranked fourth to seventh remain very tightly grouped. New Zealand are the main beneficiary from the update, climbing from seventh to fifth, while South Africa move up from sixth to fourth. 

RATINGS ? Australia (133), England (114), India (111), South Africa (100), New Zealand (99), Sri Lanka (98), Pakistan (95), West Indies (74), Zimbabwe (30), Bangladesh (6). (PTI)

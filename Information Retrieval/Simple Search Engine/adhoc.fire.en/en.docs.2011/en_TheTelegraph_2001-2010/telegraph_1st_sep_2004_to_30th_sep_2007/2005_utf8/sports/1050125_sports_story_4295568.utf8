 London: Former undisputed world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis has denied a newspaper report that he is making a comeback. The Sunday Mirror said the 39-year-old Briton was planning to fight World Boxing Council champion Vitali Klitschko of Ukraine this year.

 ?I want to reiterate what I said when I retired in February 2004 that I was fortunate to leave the sport on my own terms and that I will be one of the few heavyweight champions in history to retire on top and stay retired,? Lewis said in a statement.

 Lewis has not fought since his bout with Klitschko in June 2003 was stopped after six rounds because of severe cuts to the Ukrainian, who had been dominating the fight to that stage.

 Mumbai: Defending champion Alok Kumar of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) cruised to his second win with a convincing 3-0 verdict over Imran Khan of Uttar Pradesh in a group-A senior snooker round robin tie in the national billiards and snooker championship at the Goregaon Sports Club on Monday. Disappointed by his premature exit in the senior billiards pre-quarter finals, Alok came up with an impressive performance to crush a hapless Khan 95-16, 79-15, 81-6.

 New Delhi: World junior champion Grandmaster P. Harikrishna simultaneously took on 10 woman players in an online chess series to raise funds for the tsunami victims. The youngster beat six, drew with two and lost two games in the series to end up with a score of 7/10 to raise $ 1155 for an NGO.

 Harikrishna took on players in South America, Europe and Asia on the internet chess club and the Indian?s first defeat was against WGM Anna Ushenina of Ukraine. Harikrishna?s only other loss came against compatriot IWM Y. Pratibha but he proved clearly superior against the rest.

 Gelsenkirchen (Germany): Michael Ballack, Roy Makaay, Tomas Rosicky and Lucio are just a quartet of top stars on show when Germany take on a Bundesliga XI in Tuesday?s tsunami benefit match at the Arena Auf Schalke.

 The German football federation (DFB) hopes to raise up to four million euros for the victims of the tsunami disaster. A lump payment of 1.5 million euros will be allocated for the rebuilding of hospitals in the devastated Banda Aceh area of Indonesia.

 London: Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy should return from injury for next month?s Champions League match against AC Milan, manager Alex Ferguson said on Monday. ?He?s doing very well. I spoke to him and he?s coming along great, quot; Ferguson told the club?s website.

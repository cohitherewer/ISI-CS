Sydney: New Zealand led Sri Lanka by 127 runs with eight second-innings wickets in hand at close of play on the fourth day of the opening Test in Napier on Thursday. 

The Black Caps were 64 for two when bad light stopped play to end early after bowling Sri Lanka out for 498 at tea for a first-innings lead of 63. Opener James Marshall, playing in his second Test, followed up his first innings half-century with an unbeaten 33. 

Lasith Malinga dismissed Craig Cumming for 16, then trapped Hamish Marshall leg before for six in the penultimate over of the day. 

With only one day remaining and the pitch offering little assistance to the bowlers, a draw is most likely. 

The Sri Lanka first innings fell away quickly after lunch on Thursday but not before they were able to post their highest total against New Zealand, beating the previous record by a run. (Reuters)

 Seedings to be decided today

Leipzig: Fifas World Cup Organising Committee will decide on Tuesday the seedings for the 32 finalists involved in next years tournament in Germany. 

The only thing known for certain is that the hosts will be seeded in slot A1 in the match schedule and will play the opening match in Munich on June 9, Dortmund on June 14 and Berlin on June 20. 

Seven other countries will also be placed in the top pool and kept apart in the draw for the first round which takes place in Leipzigs Neue Messe exhibition centre. 

Fridays draw will be broadcast live to around 150 countries in the world with an estimated record audience of around 320 million people expected to tune in. 

Fifa have not confirmed how the seedings will be decided, but hinted that the method used in 2002 will be used again. 

That involved taking the performances from the two previous World Cup finals, combined with an average position based on the Fifa world rankings from the past three years to establish a coefficient for each team. 

On that basis, Brazil, Italy, France, Argentina, Spain, Mexico and England could all join Germany in the top group of seeds, with the Netherlands, the United States, Czech Republic, Croatia, South Korea, Japan, Sweden and Paraguay in the second group. 

Ecuador, Switzerland, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Poland, Iran, Costa Rica and Portugal are contenders for Pool Three, while Ukraine, Serbia amp; Montenegro, Ivory Coast, Australia, Ghana, Trinidad amp; Tobago, Togo and Angola ? the lowest ranked side in the competition with a Fifa ranking of 62nd in the world ? making up Pool Four. 

Lobbying for position has already started with the likes of US coach Bruce Arena and Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who won the World Cup with his native Brazil in 2002, saying their teams deserve to be among the top seeds.

Madrid: A second successive defeat for Real Madrid allowed Barcelona to extend their lead at the top of the Primera Liga to eight points despite being held to a 1-1 draw at basement side Numancia on Saturday. 

Real spurned their chance to take advantage of Barcelona?s slip-up in their match when they succumbed to a whirlwind start by a dominant Deportivo Coruna who went on to ease their way to a comfortable 2-0 win at the Riazor. 

The results mean that Barcelona lead the table with 58 points from 25 games, Real follow on 50, while third-placed Real Betis have 41 with a game in hand. 

Barcelona?s city rivals Espanyol moved up to fourth, level on points with Betis, after first-half strikes from Maxi Rodriguez and Raul Tamudo helped them to a 2-1 win at home to relegation-threatened Albacete. 

Barcelona never really warmed to the task in the freezing conditions at Los Pajaritos and were unable to settle into their usual slick passing game on the icy pitch. 

It was their modest opponents who adjusted better to the treacherous surface and created the first chance of the game when Juanlu lashed a shot past the post in the third minute. 

Juanlu issued a warning Barcelona when he fired a low free kick past the post in the 42nd minute and two minutes later he put his side ahead when he smashed home with his close-range overhead kick after the defence failed to clear a long throw into the area. 

Their lead was wiped out two minutes after the break when Mexico defender Rafael Marquez fired past Juanma on the turn after coming short to collect a corner. 

Incidentally, referee Jose Losantos Omar called a brief halt to the match to warn a small group of Deportivo fans to stop racially abusing Brazilian fullback Roberto Carlos. 

Deportivo twice went close to taking the lead in the first two minutes, Victor flashing a deflected drive past the post and Juan Carlos Valeron having a shot cleared off the line from the resulting corner. 

They proceeded to swamp Real in midfield and it came as little surprise when they took the lead after a slickly worked attacking move in the eighth minute. Forward Albert Luque got in front of Raul Bravo and Walter Samuel to fire a header past keeper Iker Casillas after Sergio had whipped in a cross from the right. 

Real barely had time to draw breath before they found themselves two goals down, this time centre-back Francisco Pavon looped a header over Casillas and into his own net after Victor had dinked in a cross from the right. 

In Italy, Sampdoria climbed to third in Serie A with a 1-0 victory over relegation-threatened Brescia on Saturday. The win, courtesy of a second-half goal by defender Max Tonetto, gave Sampdoria 44 points from 26 matches, taking them above Udinese, who drew 2-2 with Fiorentina, and Inter Milan. 

In Germany, Sebastian Deisler scored the only goal from long distance as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich struggled to beat SC Freiburg 1-0 on Saturday.

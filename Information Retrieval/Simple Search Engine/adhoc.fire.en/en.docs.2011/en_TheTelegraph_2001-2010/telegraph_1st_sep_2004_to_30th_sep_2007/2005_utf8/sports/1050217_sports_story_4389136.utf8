Calcutta: The buck never stops in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup. Mohun Bagan wasted a plethora of chances in the first half, showed too much respect to State Bank of Travancore?s (SBT) mediocre outfit and scored once in the second half (Mehtab Hussein) before conceding the equaliser (Asif Saheer). 

But all that Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya did after the match was boldly claim a penalty which ?was denied? to them. 

This is a pretty oblique theory that the coach has maintained. According to him, some unseen force in the League hierarchy has seen to it that all referees come in with an anti-Mohun Bagan bias. The reason remains a mystery ? the coach remains unsure ? but he actually believes that is the case. 

Lending credence to Bhattacharya?s argument was the fact that referee Deepak Singh Bist of Delhi awarded an indirect free-kick inside the box. Bhattacharya?s argument was an infringement on Ashim Biswas overlooked. The referee?s decision was because of a delay situation which has a different rule to follow. 

All this could not have been necessary had the home team been able to convert the many chances that came their way. Neither would anybody have questioned the somewhat weird substitutions that the coach effected. 

Like pulling out Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? in the 37th minute and inserting Sunil Chhetri instead. That led to a lot of bad blood, with Beto storming out. 

The misses had started in the 12th minute, when Beto was at the goalmouth, one-on-one with goalkeeper Harshlal Rahman. Beto had ladled it into the ?keeper?s hands. 

But consider this eight-minute foul-up. 

The 26th minute: Rennedy Singh (back, and reasonably in touch) moved into the box from the left and centred to the goalmouth. Goalkeeper dived but missed and Ashim Biswas proved too slow and failed to reach. 

The 29th minute: Mehtab sent one to the goalmouth. Should have been easy for Ashim, who yet again failed to make the right move. Ashim was definitely looking unfit. 

The 30th minute: Dulal Biswas collected off Mehtab to lob to the goalmouth. Beto heads goalwards but ?keeper Rahman (who richly deserved his Man of the Match award) punched the ball back. Rennedy was at hand to collect, but shot over from close. 

The 33rd minute: A free-kick off the box saw Rennedy?s rising shot dip at the far post, but Rahman fisted it out brilliantly. 

 Mehtab Hussein (

Meanwhile, Beto was pulled out. Chhetri, too, joined the bandwagon, missing two close ones in the 41st minute. That was three minutes before Ashim effected a gentle grounder at goal when he should have used some power. For a goalkeeper of Rahman?s calibre it was easy deflection. 

The 61st-minute goal was an anti-climax. Rennedy?s flag kick reached the goalmouth where Ashim, as usual, failed to collect. Off a defender?s foot, the ball retracted to the top of the box from where Mehtab took an almost tentative grounder. The defenders missed it, and the ?keeper was unsighted. The ball moved in. 

Then came foul-up inside the box. The penalty was an unlikely scenario, though. 

In the 82nd minute Saheer came into the box from the right and headed goalwards. Bivash charged out from under the bar and Eduardo Coelho positioned himself at the near post. Saheer?s shot may not have reached the target, but Eduardo, in his haste, saw the ball take his legs before rolling in. 

The goal, though, was officially accredited to Saheer. 

Two quick late tries ? by SBT?s Abdul Hakkim and Saheer ? were stopped by the woodwork, while a Chhetri header went just over. 

In the end, having dominated all through, Mohun Bagan were left hanging precariously at 11 points from eight ties. SBT are on nine from same number of matches.

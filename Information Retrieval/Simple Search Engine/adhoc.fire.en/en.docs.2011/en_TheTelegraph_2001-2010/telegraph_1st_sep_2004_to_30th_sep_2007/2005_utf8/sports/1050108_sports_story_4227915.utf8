 Obligado fancied 

 WILLIAM TELL

Bangalore: The three horses 

 ? Obligado, Brown Sugar and Spectacular Quest? are most 

 likely to fight it out for 2,000m Chief Minister?s Trophy, 

 which is a terms affair for four-year-olds and over, and 

 the main attraction in the eight-event race card here on 

 Saturday. 

 However, Obligado is selected to win the trophy. His consistency during the summer season and recent workouts are the two notable factors favouring him. Mallesh Narredu partners the six-year-old, by Indictment out of Ensenada, from trainer Darius Byramji?s yard.

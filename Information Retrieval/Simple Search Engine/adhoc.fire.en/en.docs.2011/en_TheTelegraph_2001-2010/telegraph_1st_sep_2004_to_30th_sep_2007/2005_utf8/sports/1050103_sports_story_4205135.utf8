London: Chelsea have the look of champions after Saturday?s victory over Liverpool, coach Jose Mourinho says, but his depleted squad face another test of their title credentials when they complete their holiday programme at home to Middlesbrough Tuesday. 

Seeking to win England?s top division for the first time since 1955, Chelsea hold a five-point lead over champions Arsenal going into the second half of the Premier League season. 

Manchester United are breathing down the necks of the top two, Alex Ferguson?s in-form side having won eight of their last nine games to sit nine points adrift of the leaders. 

A late deflected goal from substitute Joe Cole handed Chelsea a lucky victory at Anfield Saturday and the significance of the win was not lost on Mourinho or his players. ?You have to chase the luck but normally the luck is around champions at the right moment, in the right place,? said Mourinho. 

?When you score a goal in the last 10 minutes of a game where the draw is the fair result then I think it is the symbol of something.? 

Playing four games in a nine-day period has taken its toll on a Chelsea squad ravaged by illness. 

Arsenal, after their dip in form in November, have bounced back with five wins from their last six. 

Arsene Wenger?s side host Manchester City at Highbury on Tuesday and the Frenchman is only concerned that the champions keep winning. 

?We are getting better and better with every game. And we are making the title race more interesting for the public,? Wenger said after Arsenal?s 3-1 win (briefly reported in the Late City edition of these columns Sunday) at Charlton Saturday. 

?I am not worried about Chelsea?s results ? if they are still five points ahead with six games to go then I will look at their results.? 

United, like Chelsea and Arsenal, have won three out of three games over the holiday period to give the Premier League standings a familiar feel at the start of the year. 

Free-scoring Tottenham Hotspur, like United in a rich vein of form, are the visitors to Old Trafford on Tuesday. 

United, still without the suspended Wayne Rooney who is serving the second of a three-match ban, have fitness worries over Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo who hobbled off late in the 2-0 win at Middlesbrough on New Year?s Day. 

Freddie Ljungberg scored twice and Robin van Persie added the other in Arsenal?s 3-1 defeat of Charlton. Manchester United beat Middlesbrough 2-0 in the late match with goals from Darren Fletcher and Ryan Giggs. 

The Red Devils were also given a boost when Everton, who started the day below United on goal difference, were hammered 2-5 by Tottenham Hotspurs. 

At the valley, Ljungberg?s two goals were sandwiched by an impressive free-kick from Charlton?s Talal el Karkouri. (Agencies)

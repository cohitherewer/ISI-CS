 Sporting in title-round

 - DURAND CUP 

 Goan outfit overwhelms Assam Rifles 

 Dudu brace helped Sporting seal the match 

New Delhi: The superior physique and experience of Sporting Clube de Goa players proved decisive as the Federation Cup runners-up overwhelmed Assam Rifles 3-0 to book a place in the final of the Durand Cup football tournament here on Wednesday. 

The impressive Bebiano Fernandes gave Sporting the lead in the 33rd minute while two late goals from skipper Dudu Omagbemi settled the issue. 

Assam Rifles suffered a major blow only 15 minutes into the match when their main striker T. Akum Ao, who had scored both the goals in the victory over Mahindra United, pulled a hamstring. His absence was crucial as the team, comprising largely of youngsters from northeastern states, lacked teeth in attack and failed to put the opposition defence under pressure. 

Sporting started on the offensive as Chidi Edeh shot wide in the first minute itself. The match was largely played in Assam Rifles territory and had it not been for their custodian Sinam L. Singh, who made several good saves, the margin of defeat could have been bigger. 

Assam Rifles Ajit K. Singh also got hit by a strong corner taken by Rajesh Meetei and had to be substituted. 

Bulu Jigdung took the first shot on goal for them when his strike from outside the box sailed just wide seconds after the restart. 

As Assam Rifles got more desperate for an equaliser, they committed more players forward which resulted in gaps in their defence. Edeh took advantage as he passed to Dudu who dodged the onrushing custodian before slotting it in the empty net with a minute left. 

That goal deflated Assam Rifles and in the very next minute Dudu latched on to a similar ball from Edeh before beating Singh to complete the tally. 

However, Assam Rifles coach Gautam Sarkar was not too disappointed with their performance. 

They played to the best of their ability and should hold their heads high, he said, adding the loss of Akum Ao was the crucial setback as he was the teams main player. 

Sportings Nigerian coach Clifford Chukuwama said he was happy with the result but his side had not given its best in Wednesdays match. 

The second semi-final on Thursday pits JCT Mills, Phagwara against Army XI and Parveen Kumar, who had scored four times in two matches for the Millmen, and midfielder Rennedy Singh would be the players to watch out for.

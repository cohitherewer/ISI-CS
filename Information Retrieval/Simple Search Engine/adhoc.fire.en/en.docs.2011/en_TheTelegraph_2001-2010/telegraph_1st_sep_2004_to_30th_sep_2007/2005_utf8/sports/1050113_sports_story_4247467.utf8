The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kallis major block for English fortunes

 Kallis has shifted England?s billing from favourites to underdogs 

Johannesburg: Most sportsmen are judged on what they are but Jacques Kallis is one of a rare breed condemned for what they are not. 

It seems remarkable that the South African, currently ranked on form as the world?s premier batsman, could be criticised of anything but such is the burden of the super-talented. 

Kallis?s supposed crime has always been that he has the talent of a Barry Richards or Ian Botham but the wooden temperament of a small-town bank clerk, fussing over copper coins rather than dealing in large-denomination notes. 

Tell that to England. 

Michael Vaughan?s side came into the five-match series against South Africa as big favourites after an unbeaten campaign in 2004 but, after winning the first Test, they now find themselves as underdogs. Kallis has been the main reason for the shift. He has scored 448 runs in the first three Tests, at an average of 74.67. He began with a seventh-ball duck, missing a Steve Harmison full toss, but then made 162 in the second Test, followed by 149 in the third. 

England?s fans goaded him with chants of ?Boring, boring!? when he inexplicably struggled to accelerate the run rate shortly before South Africa?s second-innings declaration at Cape Town but Kallis had the last laugh after a 196-run win. 

?As long as I keep boring them I?ll be happy,? Kallis responded. ?It?s just a matter of summing up the match situation and playing according to that. ?Sometimes there is a time when you can try and take the game away from the opposition and times when you have to grind it out.? (Reuters)

 Protest a basic right of fans, not United captain 

 - Keane has no business attacking teammates in public 

CLIVE TYLDESLEY

 Roy Keane is in the eye of a storm 

Roy Keane is probably the best captain in Manchester Uniteds history, but I dont see how he can ever lead the team out again. Not this team. Not the players he named and shamed in his infamous interview. Not the men that he would get rid of in January if he had his way. 

Football is a flagrantly forgiving business, but the present United squad has even fewer characters than Keane is making out if some of them dont have the balls to tell him where to go the next time he walks into the dressing room. 

Keane may be 100 per cent correct in his assessment of Uniteds problems, but he has no place making such a premeditated attack on his own teammates. Not in public. He has done it before in a passionate attempt to motivate them from within those dressing room walls, but this was a misguided attempt to undermine them from without. 

Keane Plays The Pundit was the name of the lost MUTV programme. As a pundit, his views were not actually all that controversial. Everybody can see that the team is short of requirements. As a captain, his stated views are outrageous. The sound of Keanes name being chanted by the 5,000 supporters who faithfully followed their troubled team to Paris on Wednesday should have hurt the defeated players more than any amount of media or managerial criticism. 

The fans are in a state of rebellion. They would not be happy even if United were top of the league. The Glazer take-over has changed the relationship between the club and their hardcore support. Issues such as Rio Ferdinands loyalty and Carlos Queirozs tactics have fanned the flames. 

Enter Roy Keane speaking their language. Exit the tape of him doing so. Conspiracy. But a little reality check here. This is the same Keane that used an MUTV interview to raise the subject of his own contract a month ago. This is the midfield pivot for whom Sir Alex Ferguson adapted the shape of the team in an attempt to help protect his ageing legs. The irony is that the dreaded 4-3-3 is partly a concession to the captain. 

Of course, United are missing his drive on the field at present. The Red Devils are decidedly short of devil without Keane, but they will be without him for another month. Ferguson is decidedly short of options too. 

The same team that lost to Lille must gather up what fragments of confidence they can find, take on Chelsea and survive in the Champions League. Maybe, just maybe, Keane thought after watching the weekend hammering at Middlesbrough, Ill see if I can provoke a reaction from the lads. 

There was even a suggestion that Ferguson asked him to. Not so. This was an interview the manager knew nothing about, an interview Keane had three days to prepare for or dodge altogether. What we know of it was full of put-downs, not pick-me-ups. He kicked the dog while it was down. His own dog. 

You can argue all you like that the content needed saying, but the context was all wrong. Try tearing a strip off all your workmates behind their backs today and see how they treat you on Monday. 

It has been another week of the usual suspects reverting to type. Half-term is over and the children are back at school. Unwelcome returns to the headlines for Jermaine Pennant and Laurent Robert. Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger are at it again too; taking the risk of causing distractions to club business by pursuing their own personal agendas. 

Just how personal Keanes agenda has become is what is up for debate here, not the fact that Alan Smith and Darren Fletcher are not as good as he is. Surely, neither of them needs telling that. What they do need is help because they are just about all that United have got. And however scandalous it may appear to fans, that is the situation going into Sundays match with the Premiership leaders.

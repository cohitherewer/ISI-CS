 Harbhajan: This is for families of quake victims 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Ahmedabad: Harbhajan Singh wants to dedicate his performance in the final Test against Sri Lanka to the families of the victims of the devastating October 9 earthquake in India and Pakistan. The off-spinner, who finished with 10 for 141 in the match, was declared Man of the Match. 

This performance is for families of earthquake victims... The devastation and plight of the people had left me shocked and bewildered. I can understand the pain they had to go through, Harbhajan told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

The Punjab cricketer may also visit a few of the earthquake-hit areas during the teams tour to Pakistan next month. 

Mission Lanka accomplished, Harbhajan has his sights set on Pakistan now. Having missed out on the last tour there because of injury, he is fully focused this time. The target will obviously be to win both the Test and one-day series. There is not much difference between the wickets here and in Pakistan? 

The home team will always enjoy some advantage. But the last series was very good for us. Hopefully we can play as well as we did during this series. We need to keep our winning habit going, said Harbhajan. 

Does he have a new weapon for the Pakistani batsmen? No, no? Whatever I am doing now is enough? Just need to stick to the basics and perform. 

Basking in the glory of his performance in the final Test, he said: Whenever spinners do well, everyone says its because of the wicket. No one wants to give credit to the bowler. I think I bowled really well here... It will remain special as I was playing my 50th Test. 

Bowling in tandem with Kumble always has its advantages. Its a great pleasure bowling with Kumble. He keeps the pressure going at the other end and that makes my job easier. Hes already played 100 Tests and it speaks of his greatness? I always try to emulate his consistency and dedication. 

For Harbhajan, all the good performances are aimed at keeping his family in Jalandhar happy. 

My greatest happiness is when I see my family members in good spirits. My performance always makes my mother and sisters happy and I draw inspiration from that. 

Meanwhile, Man of the Series Kumble said his performance in his 100th Test was satisfying and special.

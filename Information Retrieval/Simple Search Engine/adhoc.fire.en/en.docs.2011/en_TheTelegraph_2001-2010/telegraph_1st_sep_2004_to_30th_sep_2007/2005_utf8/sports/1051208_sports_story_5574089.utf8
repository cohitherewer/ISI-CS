 Ponomariov in quarters 

Khanty-Mansiysk (Russia): Former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine cruised past Grandmaster Loek Van Wely of the Netherlands for the second day in succession and moved to the quarter finals of the World Chess Cup here. 

Apart from Ponomariov, Russian GMS Alexander Grischuk and Sergei Rublevsky also made it to the next stage after drawing their respective return games with Gata Kamsky of United States and Konstantin Sakaev of Russia, respectively. 

Ponomariov ruled against Van Wely. The Ukrainian, needing just a draw to proceed to the next round, came up with the Alapin variation against the Sicilian Defence as white and Van Wely was out in 30 moves. 

Grischuk advanced to the next round when Kamsky failed to breach his solid defence in a Ruy Lopez game. Playing black, Grischuk won the white queen in the middlegame but had to sacrifice as many as three pieces for that. The peace was signed after 71 moves. 

Rublevsky had little difficulty in securing the half point against compatriot Sakaev. The game lasted just 17 moves.

 Kallis fit, Kemp ruled out

 - SECOND TEST- Debutant Phil Jaques to open with Matthew Hayden 

 Kallis inclusion will bolster South Africa 

Sydney: South Africa allrounder Justin Kemp has been ruled out of the second Test against Australia after failing a fitness test on Christmas Day. 

The second Test starts at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday. 

Kemp, who has been struggling with a shoulder injury for the past few days, was forced to withdraw after missing Sundays training session. 

South Africa manager Mickey Arthur said Kemp would be replaced by Jacques Kallis, who was cleared to resume playing after missing the drawn first Test with a shoulder injury. 

I guess it made our selection job a little bit easier, but unfortunately he (Kemp) is not available for selection, Arthur said on Sunday. 

Kemp scored 55 in a match-saving century partnership with Jacques Rudolph on the final day at the WACA in Perth. 

Arthur said the Proteas would wait until they inspected the pitch on Monday before finalising their line-up but were considering adding a spinner after playing four pacemen in the series-opener. 

It (the pitch) looks a little bit browner than it did yesterday (Saturday). I think it has dried out quite nicely, he said. 

I do like going into a Test with a spinner. I think it gives you greater options but conditions must allow for that. 

Graeme Smith sounded a not of caution. Australia have always been a scary and daunting task for South African teams, the South Africa skipper said. 

The public are very hard on South African touring teams... I think in the past South Africa have probably had a big fear of failure, whereas I think we have come to terms with that. 

If anything, they (Australia) have been under more pressure than us going into this test match. 

Kallis return and Kemps injury may mean a reprieve for Ashwell Prince in the middle order. 

Australia will be using their third opening combination of the season with attacking New South Wales batsman Phil Jaques set for his Test debut after Justin Langer was ruled out with a hamstring injury. 

Langer missed the first two Tests against West Indies with a broken rib, giving Mike Hussey a Test debut as makeshift opener. 

Hussey dropped down the order when Langer returned and will stay there with the selectors opting for a specialist opener in Jaques to partner Matthew Hayden. 

Boxing Day in Melbourne, the Boxing Day Test, its a massive day to everyone in Australia and I just cant wait to be involved in it, Jacques said. 

Brad Hodge, fresh from his maiden double century in Perth, is also making his first appearance on home ground and said he was looking forward to the experience. 

I probably imagine I will be as nervous in this game as I was making my Test debut a few weeks ago, said Hodge. 

I think the adrenalin will certainly be running playing on the MCG as a Victorian in a Boxing Day game. 

Everythings familiar to me, its just a short trip from my house to the MCG and its just going to be a marvellous experience to walk out and feel the buzz.

 Raikkonen hopes fade as Montoya triumphs

 - Italian GP

 Alonso closer to title; Narain last 

 Juan Pablo Montoya 

Monza: McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya won the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday while Renaults Fernando Alonso took a giant step towards becoming Formula Ones youngest champion. 

Indias Narain Karthikeyan endured a tough race to finish 20th, while Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro of Portugal finished 17th. 

Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher failed to score a point for the second race in a row and was mathematically ruled out of title contention for the first time since 1999, ending Formula Ones longest reign. 

The German, a sad 10th in front of a far smaller crowd than usual at Ferraris home circuit, has been champion since 2000. Alonso, 24, finished a close runner-up to stretch his championship lead over Colombian Montoyas unlucky teammate Kimi Raikkonen, now his sole rival and fourth on Sunday, to 27 points with four races remaining. 

Renaults Italian Giancarlo Fisichella took third place and his team remained eight points clear of McLaren in the constructors standings. 

Raikkonen could again only curse his misfortune. 

 After winning the last two races, the Finn knew he had a mountain to climb when an engine failure on Saturday cost him pole position and 10 places on the starting grid. 

Starting 11th, he clawed his way up to second place behind Montoya before pitting and dropping back to fifth. 

With enough fuel on board not to have to make another stop, he was sitting comfortably until having to pit again three laps later for a new rear left tyre. The Finn rejoined in 12th place, his efforts wasted. 

Karthikeyans prospects of a better finish were affected when he came in contact with Christijan Albers on the lap 34 and went off track due to puncture in his left rear tyre and had to pit twice for car examination. 

 quot;I made a good start but unfortunately Albers stupidly hit me in the rear at the first corner, which punctured my left rear tyre. It is really a pity as he has already done this to Tiago in the past. This is a long lap here so it took me a long time to come back to the pits to change tyre. Because I damaged my tyres in my accident yesterday, I had to use a very old set and therefore I knew this was the end of my race, quot; the 28-year-old said. 

The Indian said he was satisfied that he still managed to reach the chequered flag. quot;However, I am still happy that I managed to finish the race and I hope we will have a better result at Spa with the new car. quot; 

Monteiro drove strongly in his new EJ15B but said the car was difficult to drive at the high-speed circuit. quot;We finished another race which is good for the reliability of the new car but I am really disappointed as this was a really tough race right from the start. I lost some part of my bodywork so the balance of the car was affected and then the tyres got worse and worse. (Agencies)

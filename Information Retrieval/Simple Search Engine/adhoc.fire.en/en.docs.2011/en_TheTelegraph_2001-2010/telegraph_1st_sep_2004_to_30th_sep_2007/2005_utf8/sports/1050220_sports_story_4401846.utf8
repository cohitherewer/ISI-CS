 Victory for Sasikiran, Surya earns fine draw

 Surya split the point with Evgeniy 

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran finally managed to score a much awaited victory over GM Tomasz Markowski of Poland in the fourth round of the Aeroflot International Open chess meet. Also doing well was national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly of Calcutta, holding to draw a higher rated player. 

Grandmaster Andrei Kharlov of Russia created the biggest upset of the event defeating second seed and hot favourite Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine. 

The Russian thus shot in to sole lead with 4 points in the A-1 section that carries a winner?s purse of $ 30,000. 

Former champion Viktor Bologan of Moldova, Alexander Areshchenko of Ukraine and Israeli Emil Sutovsky are close on the heels of the leader with 3.5 points each while a pack of 11 players are on 3 points. 

Among the Indians GM Surya moved to 2 points along with city-mate Sandipan Chanda while Sasikiran edged himself up to 1.5 after his finely crafted victory with white. 

Day four of one of the strongest open tournaments of the world proved a better one for the Indian contingent as most gave an improved performance. 

Surya again held a higher rated opponent ? Evgeniy Najer of Russia ? to a draw while Sandipan split the point with Alexei Fedorov of Belarus in the A-1 section. 

In the A-2 section, GM Tejas Bakre was held to a draw by Ruslan Yandarbiev of Russia while young gun Parimarjan Negi held Oleg Chebotarev. 

First time winners in this group were S. Kidambi and Eesha Karvade, who both scored emphatic victories over Kirill Kuderinov of Kazakhstan and Ekaterina Korbut of Russia, respectively. 

The lone Indian loser of the day was Tania Sachdev who succumbed to Evgeny Romanov of Russia. 

In group B Dinesh Kumar Sharma drew with Hrant Melkumyan of Armenia. Surya came close to winning against Najer, but the Russian hung in there with some precise defence. It was the open variation of the Ruy Lopez wherein Surya got a tangible advantage in the middle game. 

After launching an attack on the king, Surya faced stiff resistance as Najer exchanged pieces at regular intervals to arrive at a pawn less rook and pawns ending. However, as it turned out in the end, Surya could not convert his extra material to a full point and signed peace in 57 moves. Kharlov punished Ivanchuk for his over-ambitious play. Right from the start, even though he played black, Ivanchuk went for uncompromising play and even managed to get an advantage as Kharlov played passively. 

However, in his bid to improve the middle game position further, Ivanchuk had to pay heavy price for his fractured pawn structure. After the dust settled, Kharlov emerged a pawn up in a double rook ending and in no time turned the tables on Ivanchuk. The game lasted 59 moves. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chawla may get call-up in Tests too

 - Series vs LANKA 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Rajkot: The very impressive teenaged leggie, UPs Piyush Chawla, will probably be an add-on to Team India during the three Tests against Sri Lanka next month. 

Chawla and others with similar promise are going to get opportunities to share the dressing room... They will quickly get to know and appreciate whats being put in place, besides getting prepared for international cricket, coach Greg Chappell pointed out on Tuesday. 

As reported by The Telegraph, Chawla was asked by the selectors to join Team India here as a nets bowler. Hes going to travel to Vadodara, venue of the seventh and final ODI, as well.

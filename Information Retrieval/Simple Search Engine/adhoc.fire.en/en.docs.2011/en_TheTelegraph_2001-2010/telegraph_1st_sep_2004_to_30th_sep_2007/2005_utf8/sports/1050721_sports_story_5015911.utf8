 Good day for Indians

Belfort (France): Almost all the top Indian players were off to a flier in the first round of the world youth chess meet that began here Wednesday. 

Top seed Woman GM Dronavali Harika opened her account in the under-16 section beating Mihaela Iurascu. 

International Master Parimarjan Negi, in the under-12 boys, also began with a quick win over Justin Chow. 

Also coming out with flying colours was Sahaj Grover in the under-10 category, where he accounted for Mukhit Ismailov with black pieces. Sahaj got a slightly better middle game and won quickly. (PTI)

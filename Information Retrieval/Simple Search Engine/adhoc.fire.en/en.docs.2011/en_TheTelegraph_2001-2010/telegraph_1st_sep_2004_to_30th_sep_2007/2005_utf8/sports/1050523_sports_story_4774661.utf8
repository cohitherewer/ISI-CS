 Reeve admits to cocaine addiction

 Dermot Reeve 

London: Former England international cricketer Dermot Reeve says he is addicted to cocaine so much that he does not remember what he said while commentating during a Test match last year. 

The 42-year-old allrounder, who played three Tests and 29 one-day Internationals for England, said he commentated on a Test match between England and New Zealand for Channel 4 while under the influence of the drug. 

I have no recollection of seeing the ball on Saturday and Sunday. I had to watch the video of the match to hear what I said, he told a daily newspaper. 

Reeve said on Sunday he had taken a combination of alcohol and cocaine after the second day at Lords followed by two sleeping tablets. 

I woke up late and didnt arrive at the ground till midday on the Saturday. I was meant to be at the ground for 10 am, he said. 

My bosses took me to one side at the end of Sunday. They knew I was having problems and suggested I took Monday off. It was a reality check and it was also very frightening. 

He also revealed that in the 1990s, when he played for England and Warwickshire, he smoked marijuana in the close season. 

Reeve, who quit Channel 4 on Friday after five years as a member of their commentary team, said that his marriage to second wife Fiona was in tatters, forcing him to turn to drugs. 

I turned to cocaine as a bit of escapism. It was a quick fix to solve problems as opposed to dealing with them. 

Reeve, awarded an OBE in 1996 for services to cricket, believes that he is not the only cricketer to use marijuana. If every cricketer I knew at the time I played was banned from playing, you would not have seen very good teams out there, he said. 

I am talking about the teams in the 90s, when I played for England and Warwickshire. I occasionally smoked marijuana at that time out of season, but it was never a problem. 

Reeve said he wanted to come out of the habit and if necessary would not mind seeking professional help. 

I want to be clean and healthy and fit for my kids and have normal highs that arent due to cocaine. If I need professional help, I will seek it.

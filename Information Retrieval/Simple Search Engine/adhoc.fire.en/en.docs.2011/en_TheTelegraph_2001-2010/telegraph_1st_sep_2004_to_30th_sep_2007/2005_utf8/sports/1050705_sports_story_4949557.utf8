The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tuesday, July 05, 2005 

 London: A libel action brought by Australian international Harry Kewell against former England striker Gary Lineker and The Sunday Telegraph has been settled out of court for undisclosed terms.

 A high court jury was discharged last month when it failed to reach a verdict on the action taken by Kewell after comments in a newspaper article written by Lineker over the Australian?s move to Liverpool in 2003.

 Kewell?s solicitor Chris Farnell said on Monday that an out-of-court settlement had been reached. He said the two sides would not be seeking a retrial. 

 Buenos Aires: Rioting fans forced the Almagro-Boca Juniors match to be postponed on Sunday, the last day of the Clausura, while Estudiantes and Rosario Central played out a controversial 1-1 draw which qualified both teams for the Libertadores Cup.

 Almagro, already relegated, were leading Boca 3-2 in the 65th minute when their supporters began climbing the fences around the field and threatened a pitch invasion. When Boca supporters did the same, the referee called off the match.

 Three weeks ago, Boca?s Libertadores Cup quarter final second leg tie at home to Guadalajara was also abandoned by a crowd riot. 

 Raleigh (North Carolina): A Mexican super lightweight has become the fifth boxer in 11 years to die as a result of a fight in Nevada, a Las Vegas newspaper reported.

 ?It?s just a tragedy and something you never want to have to deal with,? Nevada Athletic Commission executive director Marc Ratner said.

 ?We?re all devastated and shocked by this. I?m satisfied that we followed every one of our procedures to give him the best care we could, but to have this still happen, it really hurts.?

 Bangalore: A Rahul Dravid XI will take on a Virender Sehwag XI in an all-stars benefit game for the former India Test cricketer David Johnson here on July 17.

 Moscow: Australian Open champion Marat Safin will lead Russia in this month?s Davis Cup quarter final tie against France despite a knee injury.

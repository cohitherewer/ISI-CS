The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Selectors to have say overseas too 

 - Kiran More likely to be in Lahore for the first Test; Others to go by rotation 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Mumbai: With the Sharad Pawar regime deciding to follow the model practised by quite a few countries (including Australia), the senior national selectors are (by rotation) going to accompany Team India on all tours beginning with the trip to Pakistan. 

More important, the selector at a particular venue will be part of the tour management and, therefore, have a say in the composition of the XI (or XII, during ODIs). The then selectors visited Pakistan as a one-off on the last trip (2003-04), but had no say in selection. 

It hasnt been announced, but The Telegraph learns chief selector Kiran More is going to Lahore for the first Test. Ranjib Biswal, a former MP and managing editor of an Oriya daily, will probably be in Faisalabad (second Test) with Bhupinder Singh (Sr) going to Karachi for the third and final Test. 

The five ODIs, as of now, are to be split between the remaining selectors ? V.B. Chandrasekhar and Sanjay Jagdale. 

In a first, the team will also have a desi masseur on call ? Ramesh Mane, who figured in stand-in captain Virender Sehwags speech after Indias handsome win in the Motera Test. 

Meanwhile, except for the pruning of the central contracts list from 17 to 15, the Board of Control for Cricket in India hasnt unleashed any surprise. As was first tipped in these columns quite some time ago, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has straightaway made it to Grade B. 

The other debutant, Gautam Gambhir, has (rightly) been placed in Grade C. 

Irfan Pathan has been promoted to Grade A, with Zaheer getting a demotion ? hes now in Grade C. The ones to lose out entirely are Ashish Nehra, Parthiv Patel, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Akash Chopra. 

Ironically, Parthivs fate was sealed some hours before the selectors recalled him (as the second wicketkeeper) for the tour of Pakistan. 

Following a suggestion by the senior pros during their recent interaction with Pawar, any non-contracted player who features in five Tests or 15 ODIs during the period others are covered, is automatically going to be absorbed in Grade C. 

The retainership will, then, be paid on a pro-rata basis.

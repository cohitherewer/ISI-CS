 Were still number one: Ponting

London: Ricky Ponting refused to be panicked despite leading his side to their first Ashes defeat since 1986-87. 

Ponting has been under fire from his home press, ever since winning the toss at Edgbaston and disastrously putting England into bat in the second Test where the hosts won by two runs to level the series 1-1. 

But Ponting is adamant that Englands first win ? 2-1 in the series ? for nearly two decades will not take the shine off the brilliance of his side that has ruled world cricket since they beat the West Indies in 1995. We are the No.1 side in the world and they are No.2 (England) but there has been some unbelievable cricket, said Ponting. 

If they keep playing like that, they are a very good side. I am not too worried about this series ? we have just been outplayed. In our dressing room, the guys are saying we lost it and in Englands theyll be saying they won it. 

Asked about his decision-making and leadership, the Australian captain replied: We havent got a crystal ball. No, I dont feel obliged to reconsider my position. I know the pressure had already started about my captaincy. Im not going to keep everybody happy but if the players are happy, thats what Im about as captain. 

Warne future 

Shane Warne, who shone in the 1-2 series loss, is not prepared to make any rash decisions on his future. The champion leg-spinner, who turned 36 Tuesday, took 12 wickets in the drawn fifth Test. 

He had already said that The Oval match would be his last Test in England. But, in the aftermath of the Ashes defeat, he was reluctant to talk about his overall future. 

With international cricket youve got to take the whole package, Warne said. Its the living out of a suitcase, its the living in hotels, its the touring, its the time away from your family, your children. 

Youve got to look at the whole package and then weigh up whats the most important thing to you. My kids are the most important, I havent seen them for a lengthy period of time and I really am missing them. 

Meanwhile, England coach Duncan Fletcher was granted British citizenship after a wait of 14 years.

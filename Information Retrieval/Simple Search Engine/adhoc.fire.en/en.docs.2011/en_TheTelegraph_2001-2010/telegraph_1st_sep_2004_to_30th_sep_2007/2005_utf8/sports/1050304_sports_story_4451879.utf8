 New Delhi: The All India Tennis Association (AITA) will adopt 12 tsunami- affected boys in the age group of 10-11 and will train them at its National Tennis Academy, Gurgaon, it was announced here on Thursday.

 ?AITA will look after the boarding, lodging, education and tennis coaching of these children at the NTA for a period of 7-8 years,? AITA general secretary Anil Khanna announced. ?The project is expected to cost Rs 2 crore.?

 He also announced a new partnership between AITA and the Army whereby they will adopt another 12 children under the army welfare scheme and train them. 

 Sydney: Australian tennis player Mark Philippoussis is engaged to his American model girlfriend of five months, a newspaper reported on Thursday. A spokesman for his management company, however, says they don?t know anything about it.

 A Sydney newspaper said Philippoussis proposed to Alexis Barbara, an 18-year-old New York-based model and part-time actress, while the two were in the US. The engagement comes five months after he broke up with Australian singer-actress Delta Goodrem, whom he had been dating for nine months.

 A spokesman for Philippoussis? agent, Brian Cooney of International Management Group in Melbourne, said they were not aware of any engagement plans ? ?at least we weren?t told anything about it.? 

 Bucharest: A Romanian ice hockey player who punched a referee during a local league playoff at the weekend has been banned for life, the Romanian Ice Hockey Federation (FRH) said on Thursday.

 Dinamo Bucharest?s Bogdan Dima contested the referee?s decisions before punching him several times in the final minutes of his team?s championship third-place match against Progym Gheorghieni who won 9-5. 

 ?The FRH banned Dima, who relapsed in his brutal behaviour, for life,? FRH general secretary Eduard Pana said. 

 London: A secret independent poll, commissioned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has dented New York?s hopes of staging the 2012 Games.

 Leaked results from the private poll of local support for the five cities in the race to stage the Olympics show just 59 percent of New Yorkers backing their city?s bid.

 In its candidature file presented to the IOC last year, New York put public support at 73 percent compared to the much lower figure now returned by the IOC?s independent research.

 ?That figure (59 percent) is well short of what the IOC would be looking for in terms of support for the bid,? an Olympic source familiar with the process said on Wednesday. ?It will not be viewed very positively by the IOC.? 

 London: Southampton midfielder David Prutton was banned for 10 matches after admitting two charges of improper conduct following his red card in a match against Arsenal last weekend. 

 London: Almost 40,000 players around the world will vote for their ultimate fantasy football team with the winners honoured at soccer?s Oscars.

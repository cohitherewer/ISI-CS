Calcutta: The opening and final phases of each half are the most critical periods of a football match. The exponents (including coaches) of modern football are always busy exploring various ideas and way-outs to cash in on such periods in the best possible way. This is the time when an opponent is least prepared to face a challenge and therefore, most vulnerable, according to them. 

If one looks back as close as the past season, Fabio Capello of Juventus and Jose Mourinho of Chelsea successfully employed the same tactics in tiding over a crisis, especially against a small team, whose focus centres predominantly around playing for a draw through a defence-packed display. 

East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick is a great admirer of Mourinho and no wonder, a follower of the Portugueses school of thought. 

While hosting Calcutta Port Trust in the CFL Premier Division on Tuesday, Bhowmick faced the same problem. An initial flurry of attacks failed to break the deadlock. The home teams domination continued thereon ? vindicated by the simple fact that their goalkeeper Nasim Akhtar had thwarted a move from the opposite end only once in the entire match and on another occasion, Gurpreet Singh, who was fast emerging as a pillar of confidence in the backline, nipped a Hussain Mustafi move in the bud. 

But what was worrying for Bhowmick was that Port Trust, having once survived the opening quarter, managed to build a wall around their area with as many as 10 men. 

East Bengal tried everything. Even Covan Lawrence, in the 25th minute, loped up, only to face a challenge from Tapan Das and fell awkwardly causing breathing problems. Play was held up for three minutes and he had to leave the field for immediate treatment. When he came back midway into the second-half, the scoreline was reading the same. 

However, the small teams, so to say, tend to start living in a make-belief world of satisfaction once the match enters into the final quarter. Its as if the agenda (of frustrating and blocking the opponents) is achieved. This is when the Capellos and Mourinhos love to play their masterstrokes. So did Bhowmick on Tuesday. He brought in Tushar Rakshit as the replacement of a slow, off-colour R.C. Prakash. East Bengal midfield now got variety, giving Jatin Bist ? inarguably the best in the match ? switch flanks freely and sometimes so ferociously that the Port Trust defence had no clue about his whereabouts. 

In the 79th minute came a Jatin corner from the left. Arun Malhotra, who went up to reinforce the attack, back-headed and the ball flew to Saumik Dey. The left-back came up with a brilliant left-footed side-volley that gave the otherwise faithful Sandip Guha no chance. 

Within the floodgates got opened, the Port trusts resistance seemed to fall apart. Within five minutes East Bengal went 2-0 up. Captain Dipankar Roy moved up down the left with a jinking run and delivered a timely pass to Jatin. Srimanta handled the ball while clearing the East Bengals lob, resulting in a penalty kick. Dipankar converted in style. 

Two more minutes gone and Dipankar, having collected a nice through from Debjit Ghosh, found himself in the clear. Rabi Karmakar awfully tripped him but the referee waved play-on. 

East Bengal had no time to protest as they had already tasted the blood and wanted more. The final minute of the match clearly belonged to Syed Rahim Nabi, or his selfless attitude, to say the least. When he received a Jatin through, he foxed the goalkeeper with a quick turn. But in a praiseworthy sense of camaraderie, he pushed it for an upcoming Sasthi Duley to finish. 

Poor Port Trust were living in the silence of the dead by then.

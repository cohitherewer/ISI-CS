 Van Nistelrooy lifts Manchester United

Alex Ferguson had hoped Manchester United would make a point about their determination and ambition on Tuesday night, following criticism of their recent travails, and gloriously they made three. Just when United appeared heading for a disappointing draw, Ruud van Nistelrooy poached the winner (2-1) with six minutes remaining. 

Van Nistelrooys scoring record in Europe is remarkable, 38 goals in 43 appearances for United, and few can have been more welcome. Whatever the Dutchman may think of a tactical system that leaves him as a lone striker, he showed his finishers touch when it counted. He also struck the bar with a marvellous first-half effort. 

Unlike against Blackburn on Saturday, no cries of 4-4-2 emerged from the terraces and the United fans appeared keen to voice their support for Ferguson. A chant of Stand up if you love Fergie soon had most of the ground on their feet. 

So despite some poor passing that threatened to cost them dear, United eventually made light of the absence of so many regulars. Their appetite questioned recently, Uniteds work ethic was terrific. Ryan Giggs was always lively on his 100th European display. 

United had needed to negotiate some nervy moments before Giggs 39th-minute strike eased some fevered brows, although the tension increased when Simao brilliantly equalised to make for a frantic final half-hour of this compelling game. 

In the early stages, it had been the piston-like movement of Benficas forwards, Nuno Gomes and the outstanding Fabrizio Miccoli, that had alarmed Uniteds centre-halves, Rio Ferdinand and John Shea. Miccoli, seizing on an Shea slip, fired wide before Edwin van der Sar pulled off a marvellous save to deny Ricardo Rocha. 

Lacking the sergeant-major presences of the injured Roy Keane and Gary Neville, United appeared badly short of real leaders. Gradually, though, Alan Smith began to impose himself on central midfield, allowing Paul Scholes to stay further forward in Fergusons 4-2-3-1 system. 

Snapping into one 15th-minute challenge, Smith transferred the ball wide to Phil Bardsley, one of six home-grown players gracing the red ranks. Bardsley, employed at right-back with Shea covering for the injured Mikael Silvestre in the middle, looked far from in awe of such a grand European occasion. 

Controlling Smiths pass, the Salford-born Bardsley lifted the ball towards the edge of the area. It was flighted slightly behind Van Nistelrooy, but good players can turn average passes into richly promising ones. Taming the ball and turning in one movement, Van Nistelrooy then volleyed it goalwards, only to be thwarted by the bar. 

Hope began to feel its way into Uniteds veins. Ronaldo was clearly in the mood, relishing the chance to run at representatives of the team he supported as a child. Full of speed and step-overs, the Portugal international relished taking the game to Benfica.And so it proved in the 39th minute, Ronaldo embarking on a dribble that utterly bemused Benfica. Having exhausted all legal means to dispossess Ronaldo, Ronald Koemans players resorted to the dark arts. Pressurised excessively by Ricardo Rocha, Ronaldo was eventually sent flying by the Brazilian left-back, Leo. 

The distance appeared slightly too far for Giggs, stretching away almost 30 yards from Jose Moreiras goal. But as Koeman once infamously proved to England, technically gifted individuals can inject real life into a dead ball. Giggs struck the ball cleanly enough, sending it curling towards the wall where it caught Simao and diverted past Moreira. 

Relief rolled in waves around the Theatre of Dreams. Ferguson was out of his seat, saluting the goal as Giggs was mobbed by his ecstatic colleagues. The feeling of joy, that all was well in Fergusons kingdom was tempered just before the hour mark. 

The wound was largely self-inflicted, Smith making an unnecessary and late challenge on Miccoli. Deservedly cautioned, Smith immediately retreated to help form a wall. Such a human blockade was swiftly made embarrassingly redundant. Simaos free-kick, curled over the wall and away from the stranded Van der Sar, was magnificent. 

Back came United, Ronaldo leading the charge and drawing an exceptional save from Moreira. 

As in the first half, another set-piece elicited sweet relief for United six minutes from time. Giggs outswinging corner from the right was met firmly by the head of Ferdinand, the ball deflecting into Van Nistelrooys path. The master-poacher made no mistake from close range.

 Ponting, Katich fined 

 Ponting

Nottingham: Australia captain Ricky Ponting was fined 75 per cent of his match fee on Sunday for bringing the game into disrepute following his second-innings dismissal during the fourth Ashes Test. 

His teammate Simon Katich was also fined half his fee for showing serious dissent. Australias players earn around 12,500 Australian dollars per game. 

Ponting, who was run out by a specialist substitute fielder on Saturday, approached umpire Aleem Dar, fired angry words at Englands fielders and shouted up at the home sides balcony. 

Pontings anger stemmed from his belief that England have regularly brought on substitutes to give their bowlers a break from play when they should only be used in case of injury. 

The Australia captain, however, probably chose the wrong time to make his protest. Gary Pratt, who ran him out, was on the field for England fast bowler Simon Jones, who missed most of Australias second innings with an injured right ankle. 

Katich was censured for showing dissent to umpire Dar over his dismissal by fast bowler Steve Harmison on Sunday. 

Katich, Australias last specialist batsman, was given out leg before for 59 after a fine back-to-the-wall innings. Television replays suggested the ball had pitched outside leg stump and would have cleared the stumps.

 Insurance cover for Lankans

 Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) has insured the entire Sri Lankan team for Rs 10 lakh per player for the fifth ODI to be played at Motera on Sunday. 

This has been done to cover the players from any risk arising out of any untoward incident during the match, GCA president Narhari Amin said on Thursday, adding that the Mumbai-based New India Assurance Co. Ltd was taking care of the insurance cover for the visiting team. 

The GCA has insured the match for Rs 50 lakh in case the ODI does not take place for any reason. A Rs 3 crore insurance cover has been taken for any incident or damage that may occur at the stadium during the match.

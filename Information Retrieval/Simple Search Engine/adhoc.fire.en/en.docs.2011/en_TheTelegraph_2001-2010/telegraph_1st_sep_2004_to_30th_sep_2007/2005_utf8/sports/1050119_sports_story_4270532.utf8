 Ever-Ready letter to AIFF

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ever-Ready club will be sending a letter to the AIFF seeking clarification on their participation in the National Football League second division. 

According to the AIFF?s new circular, which was handed over to Ever-Ready officials on Tuesday, eight teams have been given direct entry to the second division while the other four teams will be selected from a tournament involving state league champions. 

However, last year?s AIFF rules clearly stated that the teams placed between third and sixth (both inclusive) in the qualifying event should get direct entry. 

While teams like Air India, Punjab Police and Hindustan Club ? who failed to reach the main qualifying round last season ? received direct entries Ever-Ready, who came fourth in the main round of qualifiers, were denied the chance. Moreover, TFA, who did not even participate in the second division, have been given a direct berth.

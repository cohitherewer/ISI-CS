 Narain: I hope to show cars full potential 

Silverstone: At the half-way stage of his first Formula One season, Indias Narain Karthikeyan promises to be competitive and seek more points in the British Grand Prix here on Sunday. 

We are expecting to be competitive at Silverstone having tested there a few weeks ago and got some good indications of which tyres to choose, Karthikeyan said going into the 11th GP, which also means home for his team. 

The 28-year-old Jordan driver, who tested here a few weeks ago, said controlled speed would be the key on the unpredictable track here and right choice of tyres would be important. 

Silverstone is a very different track from the others we race on. It is quite high-speed, but most of that speed is in corners rather than on straights. It is kind of a lottery with both high and very low speed sections. 

A good lap time, however, comes from the high speed part of the track and the stability of the tyres at Silverstone will be important for car handling. The track surface is quite abrasive which means we may see high tyre, said the Indian. 

I know the track well and I hope I can show the full potential of the car here. Obviously with the team, we need to be lucky at the present time to score points with this car.

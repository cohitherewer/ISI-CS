 Mahesh-Mary in semis; Paes out

London: Leander Paes campaign in Wimbledon 2005 ended on Wednesday. 

The Indian doubles ace, playing with Serbian Nenad Zimonjic, bowed out in three tough sets to Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett. 

The fifth-seeded Zimbabwean duo won 7-5, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (8-6) to book a berth in the last four. 

Paes had entered Wimbledon with a not-too-strong right shoulder, having hurt it badly in a fall during the French Open mixed doubles final early this month. 

Mahesh Bhupathi moved two within two wins of another mixed doubles crown. 

Playing with Frenchwoman Mary Pierce, the Bangalorean resumed their unfinished match at 1-0 in the first set to seal a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) win over Martin Garcia (Argentina) and Mara Santangelo (Italy). 

Indias Vivek Shokeen and Abdullah Maqdas of Kuwait advanced to the second round of the boys doubles. They defeated Christoph Hodl of Austria and Jochen Schottler of Germany 4-6, 6-3, 9-7 in their first round match on Wednesday.

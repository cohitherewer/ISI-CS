The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal crash out

 - Santosh Trophy 

 Aloke rues missed chances 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Syed Rahim Nabi missed a sitter in the first session 

Calcutta: Twenty nine-time champions Bengals campaign in the Santosh Trophy came to a disappointing end, when they went down 0-2 to Maharshtra in the quarter final league in Kochi on Tuesday. 

Aloke Mukherjees side tore apart Maharashtra in the first-half with a scintillating attacking display, but the forwards missed one chance after another. Maharashtra regrouped themselves after the change of side and Reuben DSouza (58th minute) and Paresh Shivalkar (65) struck in quick succession and it was a blow too heavy and hot for Mehtab Hussain amp; Co. 

Maharashtra, who beat Services 5-3 in their first match, thus, finished the quarter final stage with an all-win record and made it to the semi-finals from the group. 

Bengal will take on Services in an inconsequential match on Wednesday. 

Im not offering any excuse. We couldnt score and therefore lost the match. Its really disheartening, but what can you say if so many chances went a-begging? coach Mukherjee told The Telegraph from Kochi after the match. 

We took Maharashtra by the scruff of the neck in the first-half. We were close to scoring on so many occasions? I really dont know how (Syed Rahim) Nabi missed such a sitter and how Saumik Dey headed straight at the goalkeeper from close. It was just one of those days when nothing went to click for you, he added. 

Bengal made their intentions clear when they began on an attacking mode. Mehtabs inclusion in the team was a big boost for Dipendu Biswas and Nabi as the Mohun Bagan captain and East Bengals Sasthi Duley scorched the wings, taking Maharshtra rearguard by surprise. 

Had Maharashtra goalkeeper Israt Kamal not been unstoppable, Bengal could easily taken at least 2-0 lead in the first 45 minutes itself. 

In the 43rd minute, Nabi, having met with a left-wing cross, dodged past the goalkeeper, but his touch was awkward and didnt find the target. 

On the cusp of half-time, Saumiks header from inside the box went straight to Israts hands. A Dipendu shot also hit the post. 

Left with the solitary option of winning, Bengal went for the jugular after the break as well. Then came the first shock for Bengal in the 58th minute, when DSouza ? who substituted an off-colour Abhishek Yadav ? took a thunderous shot that gave goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar no chance. Seven minutes later, a typical Steven Dias cross found Shivalkar nodding in. 

After the first goal, we still believed we had a chance. But Shivalkars goal shattered us completely, Mukherjee admitted. 

It was a losing battle Bengal were waging thereafter even if Dipendus shot forced a smothering save from Israt. 

We really wanted to win this match. but luck didnt favour us, Dipendu remarked, adding that rescheduling of the match twice because of rains also affected the teams mental preparation. 

We came here with lots of hopes and confidence. Sasthi, myself and others had a chance to prove a point or two. I dont know whether I had been able to please (Mohun Bagan coach) Amal Sir with this performance. Had we reached at least the semi-finals, things could have been different, perhaps, Dipendu said, disappointingly.

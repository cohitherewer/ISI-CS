The Telegraph - Calcutta

 PCA slams Clive Lloyd

 Clive Lloyd 

London: Match Referee Clive Lloyd?s comments that England captain Michael Vaughan ought to have been banned for the fifth Test against South Africa may get him into trouble. 

Lloyd fined Vaughan ? who led his side to a 2-1 victory in the series ? ?5,500 for publicly criticising the umpires during the fourth Test, but thought about banning him altogether for what he termed a ?dismissive and rude? attitude during the disciplinary hearing. 

?I would have given him a lesser fine were it not for that, but I stopped short of banning him,? Lloyd told the Cape Argus. 

?I could have banned him for the fifth Test, but imagine what that would have done if the England captain couldn?t lead his team in a match to win the series and accept the trophy.? 

However, the Professional Cricketers? Association (PCA) issued a statement criticising Lloyd?s decision to go public with details from the hearing. 

It said: ?putting details into the media is inappropriate and unacceptable... And should lead to an immediate review of Clive Lloyd?s position and future as Match Referee.?

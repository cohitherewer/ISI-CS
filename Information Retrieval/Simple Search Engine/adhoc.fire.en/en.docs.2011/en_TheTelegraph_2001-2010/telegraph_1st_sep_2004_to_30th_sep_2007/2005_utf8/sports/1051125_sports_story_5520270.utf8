 England hang on for draw

 - 2nd TEST 

 Inzy smashes 24th century 

 Shoaib Akhtar gets a hug in Faisalabad on Thursday 

Faisalabad: England hung on for a draw on an exciting final day of the second Test on Thursday after a superb exhibition of fast bowling from Shoaib Akhtar and Rana Naved put Pakistan in with a chance of victory. 

Pakistan were boosted early in the day by Inzamam-ul-Haqs 24th Test hundred which effectively ended Englands chance of a victory. The draw keeps Englands hopes of levelling the series alive at 1-0 down with one Test to remain. 

England were set an improbable target of 285 to win and after collapsing to 20 for four under a barrage of short balls from Shoaib and some cunning bowling from Naved, dug in to reach 164 for six when bad light ended play. 

Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell all fell for ducks and captain Michael Vaughan for nine as Shoaib, who finished with three for 61, and Naved (three for 30) took two wickets apiece. 

But up stepped Ashes heroes Andrew Flintoff (56) and Kevin Pietersen (42) to rescue England from their horrible start. 

Flintoff, who had put on 80 with Pietersen, then added 38 with Jones before falling with an hour remaining in the day when he swung at a short ball from Shoaib which hit his gloves and went straight to substitute Hasan Raza at point. 

Plucky Geraint Jones (30 not out) and an obdurate Ashley Giles (13) shared a seventh wicket stand of 26 runs to see out the day, which ended 16 overs early in fading light.

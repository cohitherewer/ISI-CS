 IFAs elite clinic from today

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In a move to reach young talents belonging to affluent class, Indian Football Association (IFA) has come up with a specialised clinic for the citys elite students. 

The clinic, being held in collaboration with Oh! Calcutta, gets underway at Bidhannagar Municipality Ground from Thursday, with P.K. Banerjee as the Technical Director and former internationals Prasanta Banerjee and Debashish Mukherjee as coaches. 

Announcing this, PK described it as a model scheme and an opportunity to attract middle and upper-middle classes to the game. 

If we cant groom young talents, we have no future ? with this lament I quit coaching the national side. But the IFA has presented us with a golden opportunity, the legend said. The coaching clinic will run for three weeks with 90 students. 

After the clinic, well monitor every aspect of the students development, including periodical medical check-ups. We then hope to bring them to the mainstream competition, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said.

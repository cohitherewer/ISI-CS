 Romanian suffers Juniors fate 

Bucharest: In an incident similar to the Cristiano 

Junior tragedy, a Romanian footballer died of an apparent heart attack after collapsing 

during a third-division match, an official said on Saturday. 

Alin Paicu, 32, collapsed during his team Minerul 

Matasaris home match against Hexe Jebel Timisoara in Romania and died in 

the car which was taking him to hospital in the city of Tirgu Jiu. 

Paicu headed a ball from a corner and fell down in the 17th minute, said the visiting teams doctor Nicolae Mititelu, who attended to the player. He seemed to suffer a heart attack but there was no special ambulance at the field to treat and resuscitate the player. 

Brazilian striker Junior, playing for Dempo SC against 

Mohun Bagan in the Federation Cup final in Bangalore five months ago, collapsed 

after scoring his second goal. He never regained consciousness. Investigations 

revealed that Junior suffered a cardiac arrest on the field. (Agencies)

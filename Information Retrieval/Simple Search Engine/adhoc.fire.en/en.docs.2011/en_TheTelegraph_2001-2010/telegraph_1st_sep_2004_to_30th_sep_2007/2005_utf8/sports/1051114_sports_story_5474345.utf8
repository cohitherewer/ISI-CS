 England in command

 - FIRST TEST vs PAKISTAN 

 Andrew Flintoff (4/68) in Multan on Sunday 

Multan: Marcus Trescothick stroked a fabulous hundred to put England in command on 253 for three against Pakistan on second day of the first Test on Sunday. 

The England captain, in the absence of injured Michael Vaughan, scored an unbeaten 135 and shared a 180-run stand with Ian Bell (71) for the second wicket. 

England had earlier wrapped up Pakistans first innings for 274 after the hosts had resumed on 244 for six. 

Trescothick faced 209 balls and hit 16 fours and a six. Nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard was yet to open his account after the umpires ended play early for bad light nine overs short. 

England lost two wickets in the final session, Bell falling to Shoaib Malik and Paul Collingwood caught off Shabbir Ahmed for 10 in the days penultimate over. 

Trescothick swept off-spinner Malik to fine leg for four in the 56th over of Englands reply to reach his 13th Test hundred. 

It was the Somerset players second hundred of the tour after he scored an undefeated 124 against a patrons eleven in Rawalpindi. 

Pakistan were dismissed cheaply on the second morning with captain Inzamam-ul-Haq failing to anchor the innings, falling for 53 off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff. 

Hoggard and Steve Harmison, together with Flintoff, performed a clinical clean-up operation to take the last four wickets for 30 runs in 11.2 overs.

 Indian men win, but slip to 2nd spot

 - Eves retain top position 

 Sandipan defeated Darban Morteza 

Isfahan (Iran): The Indian mens team slipped to second spot despite beating Iran A by a 3-1 margin in the seventh round of the Asian Team Chess Championship here on Monday. 

National champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda registered their victories while Krishnan Sasikiran and S. Kidambi drew effortlessly to come out with an overall good result. 

Other joint leader Vietnam emerged as the sole leader after blanking Afghanistan 4-0 for the second successive time in the double round-robin event played between six teams. 

The victory helped Vietnam surge to 22 points wherein the Indian men remained on their toes with 21 points in their kitty. 

Iran A, however, maintained their place at third spot on 17 points where they are now followed by their B team on 11.5 points. 

Turkmenistan is next in line on 10 points. 

In the womens section being played simultaneously, the Indian eves kept themselves ahead with another fighting draw with Vietnam. 

Again, the efforts of youngest Indian team member Mary Ann Gomes were noteworthy in this section as she won an engrossing game against Luong Minh Hue on the second board. 

On other boards for India, woman GM Nisha Mohota drew with Nguyen Thi Thanh on the top table while on the third board Swati Ghate lost to Hoang Thi Bao Tram. 

With just two rounds to come in the four-team womens event, nothing changed as the other encounter between Iran A and Iran B also ended in a 1.5-1.5 deadlock. 

The Indian eves remained on top having 6.5 points where they are followed by Vietnam and Iran B having 6 points each. Iran A is at the bottom of the tables 5.5 points. 

While a medal is on the cards for both Indian teams, but it would be ironical if the top seeded Indian men do not win the gold especially when defending champion China is not there. 

While a victory by a 3-1 margin is surely expected to rope in the gold for the Indians, even getting 2.5 points in that match is expected to end the lead gap. 

In the match against Iran A it was a business like approach by Sasikiran and co. 

On the top board, Sasikiran drew with Ghaem Maghami Ehsan without much ado with black pieces and it was a similar story for S. Kidambi on the third board against Mahjoob Morteza. 

The Indians have rested their hopes on the white pieces of Surya Sekhar and Sandipan and they both scored valuable victories over Elshan Moradiabadi and Darban Morteza respectively.

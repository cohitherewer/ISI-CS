 Bangladesh sniff maiden victory

 Chigumbura celebrates one of his five wickets on Sunday 

Chittagong: Tapash Baisya and Enamul Haque shared three wickets to strengthen Bangladesh?s chances of posting their maiden Test victory on the penultimate day of the first Test against Zimbabwe on Sunday. 

Chasing a stiff 381-run target, Zimbabwe were struggling at 46 for three at stumps. They now have to face a minimum of 90 overs on the final day to save the match. 

Bangladesh, seeking their first win since gaining Test status in 2000, tightened the screws on a depleted Zimbabwean side when fast bowler Baisya removed opener Barney Rogers and Vusimuzi Sibanda for nought in his opening two overs. 

Left-handed Rogers was caught low at second slip by substitute Manjural Rana, while Sibanda was trapped leg-before. Opener Stuart Matsikenyeri, who made 20 in a 40-run stand for the third wicket with Hamilton Masakadza, was bowled attempting a big heave against left-arm spinner Haque. 

Masakadza (26 not out) and Brendan Taylor denied the hosts further success. 

Bangladesh earlier declared their second innings at 204 for nine for an overall lead of 380 runs, with skipper Habibul Bashar following his first-innings 94 with a solid 55 in the second. The hosts went for quick runs before the declaration in a bid to set a stiff target for the visitors, losing wickets at regular intervals in the process. Opener Rajin Saleh (26), Khaled Mashud (23) and Mohammed Ashraful (22) all failed to make the most of good starts. 

Fast bowler Elton Chigumbura, 18, finished with five for 54 for his maiden five-wicket haul in three matches, while Douglas Hondo took three for 61. Zimbabwe were all out for 312 in the first innings in reply to Bangladesh?s 488, with Mohammed Rafique taking five for 65 for his fifth five wicket haul in 17 matches. (AFP)

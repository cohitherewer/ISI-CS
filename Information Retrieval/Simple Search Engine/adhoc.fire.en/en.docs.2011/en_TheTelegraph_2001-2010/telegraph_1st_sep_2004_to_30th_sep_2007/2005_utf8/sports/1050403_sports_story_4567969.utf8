Local hope Grandmaster Miguel Illescas Cordoba started off in style, defeating Cuban GM Lenier Dominguez in a fine endgame display. World?s youngest GM Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine was the other winner on the first day, scoring a marathon 84-moves victory over Ruben Felgaer of Argentina. 

The other two games of the day were drawn with Azerbaijani sensation Teimour Radjabov signing peace with Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia and winner of 2003 edition Russian Alexander Rustemov holding top seed and hot favourite compatriot Alexey Dreev.

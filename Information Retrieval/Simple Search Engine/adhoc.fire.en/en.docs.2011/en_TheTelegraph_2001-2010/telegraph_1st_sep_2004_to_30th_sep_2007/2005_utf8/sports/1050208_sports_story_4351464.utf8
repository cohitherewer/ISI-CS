 Moldovan retires 

Bucharest: Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan announced his retirement from soccer on Monday after his club Servette went bankrupt last week. 

The 32-year-old said he had rejected an offer from Romanian first-division club Poli AEK Timisoara to play for one more year but might return to his country as a coach or club leader. 

 ?I?m tired now and I want to spend more time with my family,? Moldovan said.

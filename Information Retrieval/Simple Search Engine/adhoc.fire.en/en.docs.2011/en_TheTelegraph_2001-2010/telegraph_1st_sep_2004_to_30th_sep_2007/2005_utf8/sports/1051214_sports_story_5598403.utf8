Calcutta: Sanjeev Mehra shot one-under 71 to lead the field on the first day of the Royal Challenge RCGC Cup, played at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Tuesday. 

Mehra is closely followed by Joseph Chakola, Karan Singh, Chirag Kumar and Manav Das all who carded one-over 73. Karan is a rookie in the amateur circuit, while Das won the Royal Challenge Southern India Amateur meet. 

Mehra began with a bang, with a birdie on the first hole but relinquished the advantage with a double on the third, where his second shot landed in the water tank. However, he recovered well to drain a 30-foot eagle putt on the very next hole, followed by a birdie on the sixth. He again three footed for a bogey on the eighth. 

Mehra showed great consistency on the return leg, with ten consecutive pars from the ninth to the 18th hole. 

Scores ?? 71 Sanjeev Mehra; 73 Manav Das, Karan Singh, Joseph Chakola, Chirag Kumar; 74 Ajay Singh, Gaurav Ghosh, Ranjit Singh; 75 Simarjet Singh, Tarun Gogale.

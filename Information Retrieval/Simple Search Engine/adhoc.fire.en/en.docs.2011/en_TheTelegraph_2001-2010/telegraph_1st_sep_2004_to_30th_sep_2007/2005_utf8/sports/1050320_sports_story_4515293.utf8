 A coach must never think he?s the fountain of all knowledge: Woolmer

Born in Kanpur, raised in England and settled in South Africa... Bob Woolmer is truly a citizen of the world. He is also acknowledged as the most innovative coach. He made headlines when he wore that hat for South Africa and, for the past nine months, has been with Pakistan. The 56-year-old Woolmer, who has a Calcutta connection as well, recently spoke to The Telegraph. 

The following are excerpts: 

On the ?keys?, so to say, of coaching 

Most important, a coach must never think he?s the fountain of all knowledge... Indeed, he may even have to learn from the least experienced player. Then, it?s important to love and enjoy the job. After that, you should look to doing it better. Patience, of course, is a necessity. 

On whether coaches also ?grow? 

They have to and they?ve got to learn to treat people differently. I grew up under autocratic coaches who cracked the whip all the time... They were stick-oriented, pushing and pushing... My approach is different ? I coach the way I would have liked to be coached. Essentially, every person has a different learning style and, so, the coach?s method has to be tailored. Personally, I?ve gained from coaching courses. (After a pause) Every brain looks the same, but is actually totally different. The way the human mind works is fascinating. 

On the dos and don?ts for coaches 

(Laughs) Don?t think there?s a simple answer... Do talk to the players and find out how they have been coached, do try to know their understanding of the game... Do start your interaction by saying ?tell me about yourself?... Do learn about the players? lives... Don?t force any information, don?t tell him about how you played... Don?t assume anything. (Pauses again) It?s better to have an in-depth knowledge of technique, but being able to properly communicate is a top requirement. 

On the ideal approach for a coach 

To not have a closed way of thinking... The mind, after all, is like a parachute... If you don?t open it, then it?s not going to work. Bobby Simpson once suggested no more than a two per cent change can be made on the physical side. However, mentally, the difference may be as high as 30-40 per cent. 

On the one aid which, nowadays, is helping coaches the most 

The digital video camera... Using it together with the laptop has brought about an extraordinary change. 

On having pioneered the use of laptops 

Well, the laptop helped ?short-circuit? everything I wanted to see and know... It helped energise the team, helped energise me... Today, though, there could be many coaches who are more adept at using the laptop. 

On whether the criticism over his appointment, from sections of the Media in Pakistan and some former cricketers, upset him 

It?s easier to criticise than be nice... I can?t, however, afford to get riled... I?m trying my best... You know, it took Thomas Edison 2,000 experiments to invent the bulb and, when someone asked how it felt having failed so many times, he replied he hadn?t because, in the end, he succeeded... It was the process which made the difference. 

On whether a coach can ever keep everybody happy 

He can?t please the entire team, nor must he try doing so... That isn?t his job ? his job is to bring about improvements. 

On whether the profile of a coach matters 

Look, the profile is largely determined by the Media... You?re interviewing me, but if I didn?t do the interviews, I wouldn?t have a profile... 

On whether a coach should himself have been an international or the John Buchanan ?model? is just fine 

When Simpson took over in the mid-Eighties, Australia needed somebody high-profile... That wasn?t a requirement when Buchanan succeeded Geoff Marsh in 1999... It?s up to the individuals in the dressing room to work out the best arrangement ? the coach?s background may not be a factor. 

On whether cricket coaches can learn from other sport 

Why not? I?ve myself done a hockey coach?s course in South Africa and one in soccer in the UK... Even for a coach, there are many areas to learn... (Pauses again) Incidentally, England and Warwickshire?s Dermot Reeve was quite an influence, specifically on employing the reverse sweep. I embraced his vision... I learnt from the John Snows as well... In fact, I regard him as the finest bowling coach. 

On whether it?s easier for somebody from overseas to coach 

Perhaps, for he doesn?t come with political baggage... Coaches from outside are often more successful than home-bred ones. 

On whether a coach gets to unwind 

(Laughs again) It?s a 24x7 job, but I do try and take a break... It helps if one is able to keep a level perspective. Then, too much unwinding isn?t needed. It?s a tough ask, but one must not get very emotional ? not all the time, that is. One has to keep a balance or else a heart attack won?t be far away... At times, the coach should take one step back from being passionately involved. 

Finally, on his biggest challenge as Pakistan?s coach 

Getting to ?evolve? a team with the right personnel and getting it to grow... Good teams evolve over a period... Australia, India... Really, coaches have to focus on getting a team to grow. The bottomline, though, is performance and I recall a Brian Lara quote: ?To be selected, you?ve got to put selection beyond the selectors by performance...? He couldn?t have been more succinct.

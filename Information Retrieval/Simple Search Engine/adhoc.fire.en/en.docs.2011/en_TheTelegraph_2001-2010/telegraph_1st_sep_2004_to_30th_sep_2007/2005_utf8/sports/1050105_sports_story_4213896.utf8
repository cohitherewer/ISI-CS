The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lack of depth our biggest worry: Leander Paes

 - ?2004 has given me the energy to carry on for three or four more years? 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Chennai: Leander Paes is into his 15th year on the professional tennis circuit. And what a journey it has been for Indian tennis? icon No. 1! 

The year just gone by saw him bounce back from a potentially life-threatening ailment with sheer willpower. It was also a year when he was at the receiving end of the Page 3 press following his break-up with Mahima Chaudhury. He won this battle, too, showing the dignity of a public figure who is the role model for many. 

He let his racket do the talking and came out of the nasty period with his reputation and image intact. The Telegraph caught up with India?s Davis Cup captain to quiz him on a wide range of topics. 

The following are excerpts 

Q How do you look back at 2004? 

A It was a hugely important year for me because I 

was coming back from a long lay-off. It was important to get the hunger, the passion 

back. In my very first tournament (Australian Open), Martina and I reached the 

final. That went a long way in instilling confidence and self-belief. I immediately 

knew that I had it in me to play tennis at the same level as before the brain 

lesion problem. As the year progressed, I got stronger and stronger. I am satisfied 

with my 2004 results? It has rejuvenated me and given me the energy to carry on 

for three or four more years. It wasn?t that good on the personal front? I didn?t 

speak about it last year, I don?t wish to do it now? That?s not how I function. 

I have trust in those who know me well. 

You got some really nasty press but still kept 

mum? 

Well, I have learnt to take the so-called entertainment 

press or the Page 3 columns with a pinch of salt. I find most of what is being 

written amusing. 

What are your expectations in 2005? 

I am looking forward to an exciting year. I have two 

very good partners, one a legend and the other a talented man with young blood 

in his veins. I can?t wait to get out on court with Martina (Navratilova) again 

at the Australian Open. We have a very good chance of winning a third Grand Slam 

together. As far as Zimo (Zimonjic) is concerned, we gelled really well in the 

only tournament we played (Delray Beach) and won it? I hope that same magic continues 

to work. 

How difficult is it to change partners every 

one or two years? 

Well, the main task is to find a happy medium between 

the two persons so that they gell on and off court. Both I and Zimo (Nenad Zimonjic) 

are good doubles players, now it?s up to us to combine the sum of our skills for 

the team?s benefit. Communication has always been one of my strengths, so that 

should help. It will be a gradual building process, the partnership will evolve 

with every practice session we have, every match we play. It normally takes about 

six months for a pair to establish itself. 

There is a lot of talk about Karan Rastogi. 

As the Davis Cup captain, are you excited at the emergence of this new kid? 

I saw him play and win the ABN Amro Challenge in Mumbai 

last month. He surely is our best young talent right now. But he has a lot of 

work to do. For example, he has to develop a weapon. In modern tennis, just keeping 

the ball in play is not good enough to win you matches, you need at least one 

big shot with which to create winners. What I liked most in his game is his fighting 

quality. 

What about Prakash Amritraj? Is he getting 

weighed down by expectations? 

I feel Prakash has improved a hell of a lot since 

I saw him here three years ago. He is a flamboyant kind of player who moves well 

and has all the shots. Most importantly, he has got the right work ethic. I have 

faith in Prakash? I believe he can take over from us and carry the mantle in the 

years to come. 

But are you satisfied with our bench strength? 

The lack of depth is definitely our biggest worry. 

Karan is coming up, there is Prakash, then we have an enigma called Harsh Mankad. 

Just when you write him off, he comes roaring back with a fabulous performance. 

These three apart, there are some good players but what we need is international 

class. From the time of Ramanathan Krishnan, we?ve always had at least one highly-ranked 

player. Now, our top player (Prakash) is ranked 220. At 31, have to keep pushing 

myself for one more extra effort in every Davis Cup tie. But I do wish that at 

this stage of my career, I could just play the doubles rubber. 

You no longer play singles on the Tour but 

still accepted a wild card here. Don?t you think someone like Harsh should have 

got it? 

I agree a wild card should first go to the younger 

players. I wouldn?t have taken it had Prakash and Karan not got one. As for Harsh, 

his form has been up and down? He wasn?t that much in the picture before last 

week. Now that he?s had a wonderful run in the qualifiers, he?s strongly back 

in contention for the Davis Cup. Makes my task a bit more difficult, but I?ll 

take it. 

You?re more of a Mumbaikar these days. Have 

you bid Calcutta goodbye? 

See, I am a Goan who grew up in Calcutta. I live more 

in Mumbai these days because of its location. It?s convenient to fly in and out 

of Mumbai to the different playing destinations. But that doesn?t mean I don?t 

like Calcutta. Calcutta will always occupy a special place in my heart. That?s 

still home for me, along with Mumbai and Orlando.

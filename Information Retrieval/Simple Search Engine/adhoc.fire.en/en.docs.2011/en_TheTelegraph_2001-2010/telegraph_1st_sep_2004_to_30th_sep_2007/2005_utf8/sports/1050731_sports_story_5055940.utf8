The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Merchants Cup from Tuesday

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Golf returns to Calcutta with the rain. Forty leading corporate houses will take part in the Royal Challenge The Telegraph Merchants Cup, and 30 for The Telegraph Challenge Cup, in meets to be held over the Royal Calcutta Golf Club course from Tuesday to Friday. 

As usual the glitter will be provided by names like Asian Games gold medallist Lakshman Singh and former national champion Alan Singh. They will be among the 288 participants. 

Top golfing corporate houses include the likes of Williamson Magor, Tata Tea, ITC, Tata Steel, Tinplate, B.M. Birla Hearth Research Centre, Carritt Moran, J Thomas, RPG-PCBL, CESC and Goodricke. 

Lakshman and Aditya Khaitan will represent Williamson Magor, while Alan leads Tata Steel. 

The Telegraph Challenge Cup will see participation from companies like Amarawati Tea, Aquarious Marketing, Andrew Yule, Citibank, J Reynold amp; Co. and others. 

It invites you to take life to the next level by challenging whatever is holding you back, is how A. K. M. A. Shamsuddin, president Shaw Wallace of UB Group, sees the brand and the meet, also supported by Power 107.8FM. 

The Merchants Cup is open to those companies that have at least four executive golfers based in the eastern region, though The Challenge Cup has no such limitations. That meet is for companies unable to field a full team. 

A fun element, as Lakshman Singh pointed out, has been introduced this year, with the fourth member being a fun member, so to say, while only the playing threes scores will be taken into account. That is a very fair Double Peoria format.

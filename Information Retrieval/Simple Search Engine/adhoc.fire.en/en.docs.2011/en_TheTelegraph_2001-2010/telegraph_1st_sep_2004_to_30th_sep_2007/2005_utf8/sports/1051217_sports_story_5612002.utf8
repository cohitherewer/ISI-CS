Calcutta: Joseph Chakola staved off a stiff challenge from Jaskeerat Dullet and Karan Singh to lift the Royal Challenge RCGC Cup at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club here on Friday with a card of one-under 71 and a four-round aggregate of one-under 287. 

Dullet was one stroke astray at par 288, with a fourth round card of one-under 71, while Singh carded a three-over 75 to finish with an aggregate of three-over 291. 

The contest was close right till the end, with the three players fighting it up to the 18th hole. Chakola found the centre of the fairway while Dullet strayed right, into the rough. Singh went the other way and was caught near a tree. 

From here, neither Dullet nor Singh could recover, while Chakola snared a par to claim the top honours.

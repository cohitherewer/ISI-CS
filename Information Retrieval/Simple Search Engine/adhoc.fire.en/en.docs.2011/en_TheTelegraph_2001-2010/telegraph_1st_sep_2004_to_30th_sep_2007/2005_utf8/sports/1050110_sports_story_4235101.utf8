The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Prakash has talent to crack world?s top-50?

 - Federer will play in Chennai soon? Maybe in a year or two: Vijay 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Prakash has a remarkable work ethic, feels dad Vijay Amritraj 

Chennai: Suave, charming, articulate. If those don?t suffice in describing Vijay Amritraj, you could jolly well add some more prefixes ? UN ambassador for peace, successful businessman, popular TV commentator and coach of a tennis-playing son. 

He is to tennis what Sunil Gavaskar is to cricket. Only, he is a bigger international figure than the cricketing legend. 

The NRI conference wouldn?t have been complete without the Los Angeles-based Amritraj addressing the delegates. And so, despite being tied up with the mega tennis event in his hometown, Amritraj excused himself for a day-and-a-half to make the Mumbai trip. 

As chairman of south Asia?s only ATP meet ? rechristened as the Chennai Open ? the responsibilities have been far greater this time. From convincing chief minister J. Jayalalitha to help the event stay in this tennis-adoring city for at least five more years to getting top players, Amritraj has done everything within his powers to make the first edition of this new-look meet a success. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on the sidelines on semi-finals day, Amritraj was delighted to see the fans thronging the Nungambakkam Stadium. ?We?ve made some changes to give the venue a different look. It?s great to see the crowds back,? said a proud Amritraj. 

Of course, the first four days saw a lot of empty seats. ?See, that?s been the trend since the first three-four years. The terrible tsunami tragedy may have contributed to the low attendance on the first four days this year,? argued Amritraj. 

The presence of a couple of more stars like Carlos Moya and Paradorn Srichaphan would surely help in drawing more people to the Chennai Open. ?I agree, but it?s not an easy job to get the stars to play here. Those who have played here once want to come back because they like the facilities and the hospitality. Moya and Srichaphan are good examples. The difficult part is to convince first-timers,? Amritraj remarked. 

Explaining his logic, Amritraj said: ?We all have to remember that Chennai has to compete with Doha and Adelaide in the first week of the year. The financial factor draws players to Doha (a $100,000 meet), while some others including most Australians prefer to warm up for the Australian Open in the tournaments Down Under.? 

Amritraj did approach the one and only Roger Federer for the Chennai Open. ?He couldn?t make it this time but I?m sure Roger will play in Chennai soon. Maybe in the next year or two. Apart from being a great champion, he?s a lovely guy who doesn?t consider money to be the only criterion,? Amritraj quipped. That should be music to Indian tennis lovers? ears. 

Initially reluctant to talk about his Davis Cupper son Prakash, Amritraj senior opened out as the conversation warmed up. Was he happy Prakash had chosen tennis as his career, given the uncertainties this profession entails? 

?Firstly, it was his choice, I didn?t try to influence his decision in any way. Having been involved with the game closely for over 30 years, I just told him what to expect,? Amritraj said. 

The sport, he added, had taught him a lot. ?Besides the medical and engineering professions, nothing else teaches you more in life than tennis. It helps you mature as a human being. I am already seeing the changes in Prakash. He is quickly learning how to deal with life. So I?m happy,? the two-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist said. 

Two qualities of Prakash impress his dad the most. ?He has more passion for the game than any other kid in the country. Also, Prakash has a remarkable work ethic,? observed Amritraj. 

From the day Prakash picked up a racket, all his tennis lessons have been from his accomplished father. No wonder the 22-year-old wanted the former Davis Cup captain to be his full-time travelling coach. The dad refused. 

?I have taught him the basics, everyone says he is technically very good. I did travel with him in the early part of his career, but I can?t do it any more because I believe I can?t play the roles of father as well as the travelling coach. It?s much more important for me to be a dad. Of course I?ll continue to offer him advice and tips. 

?We were on the lookout for a coach he could live with. We tried out Mohit Vijay Kumar (a former national-level player now residing in Canada) for a couple of weeks and liked him. He will travel with Prakash for two-three months, we?ll see how it goes,? Amritraj said. 

Articles saying that Prakash?s only attribute is his surname don?t upset Amritraj. ?There are bound to be varying opinions although some of the criticism is just for the heck of it. The bottomline is, I know Prakash has the talent to crack the world?s top-50. I don?t care if some people don?t agree with that assessment.? 

How has he taught his son to take in stride the negative press? 

?One of the first things I told him was: ?the good thing is I?m your father, the bad thing is I?m your father.? I think he got the message,? said Amritraj. 

It was time to sign off. The summon had come from the TV commentary box.

Calcutta: Cristiano de Lima Junior had been godsent for Subhas Bhowmick?s team last season. The Brazilian striker scored in each of his first seven NFL matches and finished top-scorer in the competition with a tally of 15 goals in 18 matches. 

Fate guided Junior to Dempo this season. The rest is tragic history. East Bengal roped in Paolo Roberto da Silva as his substitute but he couldn?t quite satisfy the team management despite scoring nearly a goal per match. 

Enter striker No. 3 from Brazil, Juliano Martins. Coach Subhas Bhowmick and seniors like Bhaichung Bhutia were bowled over by the 28-year-old six-foot-plus striker from the day they first saw him in practice. On Sunday, after Juliano?s first stage show, Bhowmick and Bhutia were absolutely delighted with the new hero?s performance. 

?He plays a lot like Junior? the way he controls the ball, his passing and the hunger for goals,? Bhaichung told The Telegraph. ?I?m thrilled to have him as my strike partner.?

Junior had overshadowed Bhaichung in the last NFL and had played a major role in East Bengal?s triumph. Can Juliano do the same this time? ?It doesn?t matter who is getting the goals. I?ll be happy as long as the team keeps earning three points,? was Bhaichung?s reply. 

Bhowmick went a step further in Juliano?s praise. ?He is one of the best foreigners to come to India. His touches, his receiving, turning and passing are brilliant. He will be an asset for our team.? 

The East Bengal coach blamed the Salt Lake Stadium turf for his team?s mediocre showing on Sunday. ?You can?t expect quality football on a ground like this? the ball bounces too much.? 

Bhowmick even suggested that the organisers should think of scrapping this venue and thinking of an alternative. ?It?ll be most unfortunate if we have to play our home matches on such a ground? what a comedown after playing in those lovely grounds in Goa and Kerala.? 

East Bengal came under some pressure in the second half and Bhowmick felt that was quite natural. ?You have to take pressure at some point of time? all teams in the NFL are more or less of the same standard, so you will face resistance.? 

JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh was gracious in defeat. ?East Bengal created the better chances, they deserved to win.? 

East Bengal jumped to 14 points from six games, while JCT remained on seven.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Vasco thrash Tolly 5-0

Margao: Vasco scored their season?s first win at home when they thrashed Calcutta?s Tollygunge Agragami 5-0 in the ninth National Football League tie for the ONGC Cup at the Nehru Stadium here Wednesday. 

Vasco, who moved to 11th spot in the table after the win, had taken a commanding 4-0 lead midway through the match. Their goalgetters were Sidney Rodriuges (15th, 36th minutes), K. Aseem (28th), Samson Fernandes (31st) and K. Anees (56th). 

Vasco could have won by a bigger margin had they converted the chances that came their way in the second half. 

Tollygunge, who failed to put up a fight, earlier spurned two chances to score. Abolanle?s close range shot was blocked by Vasco ?keeper Arindam Ghosh and then Suley Musah?s rasping drive went inches over the bar. Vasco, who are only above SBT, now have 12 points from 13 matches. Tollygugne remained on 14 points from 13 matches. 

Vasco?s K. Anees was adjudged Man of the Match.

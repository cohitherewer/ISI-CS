Kuala Lumpur: India had to be satisfied with a third place finish when they defeated South Korea 3-2 in a play-off match at the six-nation junior hockey meet here on Sunday. 

The Indians trailed 0-1 at the breather but came back strongly in the second half to emerge victorious. 

Adam Sinclair scored a brace, Vikram Kant netted one while both the goals for the Koreans came from penalty corners.

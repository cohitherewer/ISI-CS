Perth: The United States? hopes of winning a third consecutive Hopman Cup were left hanging by a thread on Thursday after they suffered a surprising defeat to Slovakia. 

Daniela Hantuchova beat Meghann Shaughnessy 6-4, 6-2 and Dominik Hrbaty held off James Blake 7-6, 6-4 to give the Slovaks an unassailable 2-0 lead. 

Though Blake and Shaughnessy edged out Hantuchova and Hrbaty in the deciding doubles, the Slovaks gained a small measure of revenge for their defeat by the Americans in last year?s final. 

With one win and one defeat apiece from their respective Group B matches, the US, Slovakia and the Netherlands can all still qualify for Saturday?s final. 

The group scenario was complicated, however, by the withdrawal of Mark Philippoussis because of an adductor injury, costing the Australian team any chance of qualifying. 

World No. 324 Paul Baccanello will replace Philippoussis but Australia?s results in their final match against the US will not count for themselves, though they will count for the Americans. 

Slovakia meet the Netherlands in Friday?s other game. 

Hantuchova, who has slipped from her career-high ranking of five to No. 31, produced a confident performance to see off Shaughnessy. 

After trading breaks in the seventh and eighth games, Hantuchova clinched the vital break in the ninth game and after taking the opening set, she ran away with the second to earn victory in 69 minutes. 

Hrbaty, who beat Philippoussis in his opening match on Monday, then fought off a tough challenge from Blake to give the Slovaks a surprise win. 

?I didn?t expect this, I already had my plane booked for Friday,? Hrbaty said. ?I knew it would be a tough match against James today and it was but I played really well and now we have a chance of making the final.?

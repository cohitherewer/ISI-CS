 Celta Vigo shock Real

Madrid: Uruguayan midfielder Fabian Canobbio upstaged Real Madrids Brazilian contingent when he scored a contentious goal to give promoted Celta Vigo a 3-2 win in the Bernabeu on Saturday. 

Chilean defender Pablo Contreras put the visitors in front early on but the overwhelming pressure from Real soon paid dividends. 

Brazilian striker Ronaldo converted a penalty and his compatriot Julio Baptista scored his first goal since moving from Sevilla with a diving header a minute before the break. 

Former Liverpool midfielder Antonio Nunez levelled the scores almost immediately, reacting quickly after Iker Casillas saved a penalty. 

Canobbio wrapped up the points for the Galicians when the linesman ruled the midfielders shot had crossed the line after it bounced down off the crossbar 14 minutes from time. 

Real Betis warmed up for their Champions League debut against Liverpool on Tuesday with a 1-0 win over Osasuna, after Brazilian striker Ricardo Oliveira scored a second-half penalty. 

Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo handed Brazilian forward Robinho his first start, playing up front alongside Ronaldo in an attacking 4-2-2-2 line up. 

With captain Raul on the bench and France midfielder Zinedine Zidane out for three weeks with a groin strain, Guti came into midfield alongside Baptista. (Reuters)

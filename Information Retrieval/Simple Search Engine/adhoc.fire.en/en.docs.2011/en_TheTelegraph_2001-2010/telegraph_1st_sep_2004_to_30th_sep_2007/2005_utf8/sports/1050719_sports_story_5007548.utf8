 China divers start off with double 

 - WORLD SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS 

Montreal: China pulled off a golden double on the opening day of the world swimming championships on Sunday, capturing the womens 10 m platform and mens 3m springboard synchronised diving events. 

Winners of a record six of eight gold medals at last years Athens Olympics, Chinese divers look poised for another assault on the podium, with 15-year-old Jai Tong and 14-year-old Yuan Pei Lin leading the charge in the 10m platform. 

Wang Feng and He Chong followed with a precision performance that provided China with a perfect start to the two-week competition, taking top spot in the 3m event. 

We wish Chinese divers take all the gold medals and bring them back to China, Wang said. 

That could very well happen with China building towards the 2008 Beijing Olympics and their divers tightening their stranglehold on the discipline. 

Right from the opening dive, both Chinese duos were never threatened, Jai and Yuan posting a five dive total of 351.60. 

Australias Chantelle Newbery, a gold medal winner in the 10m individual platform in Athens and Loudy Tourky, bronze medallists in the same event, joined forces to take silver with 334.89. 

The Chinese have always been dominating throughout my career but its not impossible to beat them, Newbery said. But they are very difficult. 

Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion brightened a dreary opening day on Ile Ste Helene by giving the hosts their first medal, taking bronze with 328.80. 

He and Wang turned in a polished effort, finishing with a winning mark of 384.42 that easily out-pointed Germanys Tobias Schellenberg and Andreas Wels on 364.59. 

After being shutout of the diving medals in Athens for the first time since 1912, Americans made a quick return to the podium with brothers Justin and Troy Dumas claiming bronze with a score of 360.27. 

Earlier in the day, Russian teenager Larisa Ilchenko claimed the first gold medal of championships by successfully defending her womens 5km open water title. 

Under dark, rainy skies in front of a sparse crowd watching from the banks of the St Lawrence, Ilchenko clocked a winning time of 55 minutes, 40.1 seconds, crossing 4.2 seconds clear of Margy Keefe of the US. 

Edith Van Dijk completed the podium, the third place finish bringing the 31-year-old Dutchwomans world championship medal haul to 12, including four golds. 

Thomas Lurz of Germany scored the narrowest of victories in the mens 5km open event that saw all three medallists cross within 1.7 seconds of each other. 

Lurz, gold medallist over 10km at the 2004 worlds, needed every centimetre of the 5km race to collect his second individual world title, edging Chip Peterson of the US by 1.6 seconds with Italys Simone Ercoli 0.1 seconds further back. 

I tried to swim away but the last 300 m were very hard, the American didnt give up, Lurz said. He (Peterson) fought and fought and Im happy I won.

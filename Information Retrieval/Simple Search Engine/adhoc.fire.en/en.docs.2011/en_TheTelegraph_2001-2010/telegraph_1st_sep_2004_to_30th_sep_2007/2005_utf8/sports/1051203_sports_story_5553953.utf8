The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vijay is the one to watch 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Action starts at the RCTC ground on Saturday at 1.40 in the afternoon, instead of 1 pm ? the timing originally indicated in Thursdays acceptances sheet and also in the RCTC website. Good sense prevailed after some deliberations over the matter at the top level.

 The afternoon may, nevertheless, see trainer Vijay Singh calling the shots in most of the six events, including the 1,200m Hyderabad Race Club Cup. In the race, Vijays Serrafina is expected to make amends for her last failure when she lost nearly a distance at the start and yet troubled the ultimate winner. Noble Flash. The Razeen-filly though out-handicapped against Autocop, yet she may triumph in view of her less blemished track record.

 Vijays Regal Romance and Magical Romance also look potential winners in their races.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

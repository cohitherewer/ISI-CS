The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Unhealthy practice condemned 

 - CLUBS TENDENCY TO MOVE COURT 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya feels that time has come for members of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to talk and sort out their differences and thus prevent the body from getting mired in court cases. Former Board presidents Inderjit Singh Bindra and Raj Singh Dungarpur also agreed this was not a healthy situation. 

Dalmiyas response came even as Kalighat Club, one of the affiliates of the Cricket Association of Bengal, went to court on Wednesday and got Justice Suhas Chandra Sen appointed as observer for the elections at the AGM on Thursday. 

I cannot welcome this? Its very distressing? It shows bankruptcy of the quality of administration in the BCCI. We (CAB) have got 250 clubs, schools and district associations. If everybody goes to court then how can we function? asked Dalmiya, also the CAB president. 

Suddenly clubs have started going to courts. Time has come when the board should say that all affiliate units should come and talk and find a solution to their problems, he said. 

On Tuesday, Chennai-based Netaji Cricket Club had gone to court and sought the appointment of an independent authority to conduct the AGM. The ruling is still awaited. 

On Justice Sens appointment, Bindra said: This proves Mr Dalmiya concedes that Board elections are not conducted in a fair manner. 

This is certainly not an ideal situation but then cricket is paying for its popularity. 

While terming the move as a masterstroke, Dungarpur felt that none of such moves from Mr Dalmiya in the past have been from the middle of the bat. 

Dalmiya, however, rounded off the mood well. People should not be allowed to go away without elections. Election must happen. Even if we have to wait for seven days for elections to happen, we should wait.

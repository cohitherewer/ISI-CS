 India lose yet again

New Delhi: India continued to shock and awe themselves when they lost the second match on the trot on their ongoing tour of Fiji. 

Barely had the surprising defeat to a local side in Wednesdays opener subsided, came another rude awakening to the standard of our national team. 

On Friday against the Fijian national side at Churchill Park in Lautoka, Sukhwinder Singhs men embraced ignominy, going down 0-1 to a team, placed 10 spots below our Fifa rankings (131). 

The Indian under-23 team lost to local club BA by similar margin in the first match of the tour. 

Interestingly, India called for neutral official in the match and subsequently, Neil Fox of New Zeland run the show as the referee. But poor defence and lack of organisation in the midfield proved to be the bane for India as former Fiji captain Esala Masi scored the matchwinner. 

Masi is the most experienced player in the Fijian line-up having played in Malaysia besides in the Australian League for Wollongong and Newcastle. 

The home side consists of players who have featured in the Australian and New Zealand leagues. 

India will take on the Fiji side again in their final match on Sunday. (Agencies)

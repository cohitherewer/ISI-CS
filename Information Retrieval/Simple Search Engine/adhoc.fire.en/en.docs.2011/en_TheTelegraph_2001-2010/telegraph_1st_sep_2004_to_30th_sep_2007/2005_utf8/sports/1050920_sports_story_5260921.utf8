 Heat takes toll on Swedes

New Delhi: The visiting Swedish Davis Cup team had the first feel of the Indian summer on Monday when their seasoned Andreas Vinciguerra suffered from dehydration due to the intense heat during the morning practice session. 

It was a sudden change in the weather with days of persistent rain giving way to scorching sun, and factor in the humidity, the seven-time champions were truly feeling the heat. 

Twenty-four-year-old Vinciguerra, 1.78m tall and ranked 433 on the ATP Tour, made the mistake of not having regular intakes of liquid to supplement the loss of salts. 

All these players have experienced different weather conditions but the humidity that is here is probably only seen in the us summer. You have to keep drinking a lot of water but you have to build that habit, captain Mats Wilander said. 

The Swedes nevertheless went through a vigorous session, their first on grass at the NSCI Club courts, a few kilometres away from the match venue, R. K. Khanna Stadium. 

Thomas Johansson, their No. 1 singles player, was expected to join the team on Tuesday after a confident performance at the China Open event in Beijing. 

The Indian team, too, was in full swing with Harsh Mankad joining captain Leander Paes, Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj. Doubles ace Mahesh Bhupathi will fly in from Calcutta ? where he has been for the past four days in connection with the WTA meet ? on Tuesday. 

Paes said the fourth member issue had been resolved amicably, acknowledging that a lack of communication had led to unnecessary complications. 

The selection committee had named Mankad as the fifth member despite he being the highest-ranked Indian on the ATP Tour. 

Harsh is a smart guy, it did not take much convincing (to make him join the team), Paes said. 

Things were miscommunicated. When there is a misunderstanding between two parties, the best thing is to pick up the phone and talk, rather than go to the media. 

Harsh thought he was not welcome on the table. Probably it had to do with certain selection parameters but it was certainly not me. To me he is one of the pillars of the team. 

Paes also had a dig at the AITA, saying it could have avoided announcing four names and, instead, give a probables list. 

I know now what to do in such situations in the future. I know what steps to take, and am confident such situations wont happen again, Paes said. (PTI)

 Even Schumacher needs a competitive car: Fisichella

Montreal: Renaults Giancarlo Fisichella says Michael Schumacher can forget about winning Sundays Canadian Grand Prix. 

Asked on Friday whether he thought Ferraris world champion could win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, where the German has triumphed for the last three seasons and a record seven times, Fisichella shook his head. 

I dont think so, honestly, replied the Italian, who once yearned to drive for what amounts to his national team and who won the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. 

I was behind him on the long runs, I was catching him and I was about a second quicker a lap, he said after the days second practice session. 

When I was behind him, he was struggling with the grip on the rear end, in braking he was not so aggressive and even into the corner wasnt quick enough. 

So I think Ferrari are still struggling here. Thats not bad news for us. 

Even a seven-time world champion like Michael, who is a great driver, if he hasnt got a competitive car cannot fight for the podium, said Fisichella, who predicted another Renault-McLaren battle. 

Renault have won five races this year, McLaren the other two with Finlands Kimi Raikkonen. 

Ferrari have an eight-race losing streak going into the weekend with Schumachers dreams of a record eighth Formula One title looking increasingly fanciful. 

The team, champions for the past six years, have just 31 points to Renaults 76 with 12 races remaining. The German is in eighth place with 16 points from seven races, 43 points adrift of Fisichellas Spanish teammate Fernando Alonso. 

We are not looking too competitive here, looking at the lap times, said Schumacher after ending the second hour-long session in 16th place. Teammate Rubens Barrichello was 10th. (Reuters)

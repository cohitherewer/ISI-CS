 Paes-Bhupathi favourite in doubles: Bjorkman

New Delhi: Swedish Grand Slam champion Jonas Bjorkman on Friday said Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi would be the favourite to win the crucial doubles tie when the two teams clash in the Davis Cup world group play-off next week. 

Bjorkman, who has five Grand Slam doubles titles under his belt and has been the backbone of the Swedish team for nearly a decade, said it would be an interesting match up since both set of players were aware of each others game. 

We know our games well after playing against and together, so it is not going to be any surprises for any of us going into that match. They (Paes and Bhupathi) would be the big favourite to win, he said. 

The Swede is expected to pair with either Simon Aspelin or Thomas Johansson.

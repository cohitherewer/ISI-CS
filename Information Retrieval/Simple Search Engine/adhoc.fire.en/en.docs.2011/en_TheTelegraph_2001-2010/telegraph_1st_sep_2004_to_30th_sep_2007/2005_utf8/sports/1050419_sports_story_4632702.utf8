The Telegraph - Calcutta

 BCCI may step into the picture

 - Beloff upholds Broad?s ban on Sourav 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sourav received a boost when state chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in Siliguri that he is a victim of gross injustice 

Calcutta: There?s a possibility the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may itself appeal to the powers-that-be in the International Cricket Council (ICC), seeking a review of the six-ODI ban on Sourav Ganguly. 

Appeals commissioner Michael Beloff has, of course, upheld the penalty handed out by Match Referee Chris Broad. Under the Code of Conduct, his decision (incidentally, conveyed to Sourav late on Sunday night) is final. 

However, asking for a review at another level isn?t ruled out. 

?Going directly to the ICC is something that will almost surely be looked at,? informed a well-placed source of The Telegraph. 

Meanwhile, it appears all 23 pages of Beloff?s judgement hadn?t been received by the BCCI till Monday evening. 

Whatever was received, though, was taken to legal eagle S.S. Ray for his opinion earlier in the day. 

The former Bengal chief minister, in fact, spent quite some time with Sourav and the BCCI?s immediate past president, Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Given that the BCCI doesn?t have to ?respond? within a time-frame, the next move won?t be made in a hurry.

 Asafa Powell fastest now

Athens: Jamaicas Asafa Powell set a 100 metres world record after clocking a time of 9.77 seconds at the Olympic Stadium in Athens on Tuesday. 

The 22-year-old broke Tim Mongomerys previous record of 9.78 set in Paris in September, 2002, to become the fastest man ever over the distance. 

This goes to show that the no one knows how fast a man can run, a smiling Powell told reporters. I am just happy to have set the record on a track where Maurice Greene also broke the world record. 

American Greene set a record in 1999 when he ran 9.79 seconds in the same stadium, which hosted the Summer Olympics last year. That mark survived for three years until Montgomery beat it at the Paris grand prix final. 

On Tuesday, Powell showed he was in fine form during his semi-final when he clocked 9.98 despite easing up in the last few metres. 

In the final, he powered past his opponents to finish three metres ahead of Aziz Zakari from Ghana, who was second in 9.99 seconds and Jamaican Michael Frater, who was third.

 Keep backing youngsters, says Sourav

London: Team India regular captain Sourav Ganguly, who blazed back to form with a sparkling 142 for Glamorgan versus Kent Friday, said his county should now keep backing the youngsters. 

The BBC quoted Sourav as saying: We must make them (the youngsters) believe that theyre good enough to do well. 

Sourav scored 69 and a superb century in Cardiff, but the Welsh county still lost by 10 wickets to slump to their sixth defeat in seven championship games. 

The team hasnt played well, batting and bowling were bad, Sourav said. 

Sourav conceded that it would be difficult to avoid relegation from the championship. But he said he had the confidence that the players had it in them to stem the rot.

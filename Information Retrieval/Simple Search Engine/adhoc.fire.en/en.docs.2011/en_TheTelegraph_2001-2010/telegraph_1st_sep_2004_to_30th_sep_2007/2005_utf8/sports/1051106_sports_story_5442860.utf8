 Selectors ill-treated Sourav

Calcutta: Former India allrounder Ajay Jadeja on Saturday took a dig at the selectors for giving a wrong treatment to Sourav Ganguly. 

Selectors have no right to treat a great player like Sourav this way. He was asked to prove his fitness, which he did in a Duleep Trophy match, but still he was not included in the squad, he said. 

Jadejas support to Sourav is significant as the former India allrounder was a contender for captaincy when Sourav was given the job in March 2000. Later in the year, off course, Jadeja lost his place in Team India owing to match-fixing scandal. 

According to Jadeja, the former India ODI captains comeback now depends on how the team under Greg Chappell performs. Had India lost the first two matches in the ongoing series, Sourav would surely have been in the squad, but that wasnt the case, he said at Deshapriya Park where he graced the Scorpio Speedster Contest as a guest. 

He praised Rahul Dravid amp; Co. for their excellent run but was quick to add that it was too early to give credit to the coach and skipper for the turnaround in the teams performance. 

Cricket is a game where the appointment of a coach and captain cannot change the performance overnight. While the performance of the team is praiseworthy, the real cause can only be speculated upon. It is only at a later stage that we will be able to pin-point the real cause, Jadeja said. 

Asked how he rated Chappell, Jadeja said: I have always thought that he is the best in the business. He is the one who knows how important science is behind the game.

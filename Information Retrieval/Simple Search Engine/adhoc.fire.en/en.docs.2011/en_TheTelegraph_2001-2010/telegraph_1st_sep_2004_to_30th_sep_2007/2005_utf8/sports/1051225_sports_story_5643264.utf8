 Jharkhand in semi-finals

Varanasi: Defending champions Jharkhand on Saturday clinched a semi-final berth in the 42nd junior (under-19) national football championship for the Dr B.C. Roy Trophy defeating Assam 4-0 in a group B league match here. 

In another match, hosts Uttar Pradesh lost to Orissa 0-3 to virtually bow out of contention for a last four place. 

Ace forward B. Vincent scored a hattrick and Prashant Kumar netted one goal as Jharkhand overwhelmed Assam in a one-sides affair. Orissa beat the hosts on the back of goals from Prashant Kumar (2) and Manas Ranjan.

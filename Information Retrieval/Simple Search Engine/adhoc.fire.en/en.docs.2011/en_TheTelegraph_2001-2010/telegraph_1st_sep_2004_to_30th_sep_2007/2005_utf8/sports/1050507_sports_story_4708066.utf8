 Rare bad day for Atwal 

Charlotte: Sergio Garcia hit six birdies in his opening nine holes to charge into a two-shot lead with a six-under 66 after the first round of the $5.6 million Wachovia Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday. 

 Indias Arjun Atwal had an unimpressive day in office, bringing in a three-over par 75 that included four bogeys and a just one birdie at the Quail Hollow Golf Club. He shares the 96th place with nine others. 

Atwal had three bogeys in a row ? on the fourth, fifth and sixth holes ? on a cool, windy day. Teeing off on the back nine, he parred the 10th and birdied the 11th. That was immediately followed by a bogey on the 12th. 

Swedens Richard S. Johnson and Americans Patrick Sheehan, Kenny Perry and defending champion Joey Sindelar shared second place on four-under 68. 

Tiger Woods carded a 70 after beginning his round at the 10th. 

Also on 70 was world No. 2 Vijai Singh, who mixed six birdies with four bogeys. He and Woods finished the day in joint 10th place.

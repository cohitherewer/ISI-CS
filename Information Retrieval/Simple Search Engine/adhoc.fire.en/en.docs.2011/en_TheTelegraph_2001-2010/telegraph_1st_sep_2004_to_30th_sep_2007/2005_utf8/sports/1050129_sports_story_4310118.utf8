 FA admits faux pas, to release new DVD

 Black players like Ince have been ignored 

London: The Football Association (FA) apologised for releasing a DVD of England?s greatest post-war soccer stars that did not include any black players. 

?The Pride of the Nation? DVD was part of a welcome gift to new members of England fans, the official England Supporters Club. 

The FA submitted a list including black players to Octagon, a video production company, but none made the 30-minute final copy, introduced by England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

?We apologise for the regrettable oversight that shouldn?t have occurred,? FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said. ?There have been numerous outstanding black footballers since Viv Anderson?s debut in 1978 and that should have been highlighted on the DVD.? 

Other players for consideration would include John Barnes, Paul Ince, Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell. 

Bevington said the DVDs had been withdrawn and would be destroyed. The Professional Footballers? Association and all who received a copy would also be sent a letter of apology. 

?The FA is in the process of producing a new DVD, which will include several outstanding black players, who have, of course, made a huge contribution to the national team and football in this country,? Bevington said. (AP)

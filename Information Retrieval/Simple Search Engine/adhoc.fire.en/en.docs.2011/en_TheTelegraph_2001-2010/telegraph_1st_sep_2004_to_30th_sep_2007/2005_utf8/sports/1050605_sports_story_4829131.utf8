 BCCI clears ODI in Mumbai

Mumbai: The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), in its platinum jubilee year, has been given the green signal by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to host a one-day International during the forthcoming season as part of its celebrations. 

The BCCI working committee agreed to MCAs proposal of celebrating its platinum jubilee year with an ODI, said MCA treasurer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty. It will be a one-off ODI between India and a yet-to-be-confirmed opposition. 

We would also be hosting three Twenty20 matches featuring Mumbai against a Rest of the World side as part of the celebrations, sometime October and December. (PTI)

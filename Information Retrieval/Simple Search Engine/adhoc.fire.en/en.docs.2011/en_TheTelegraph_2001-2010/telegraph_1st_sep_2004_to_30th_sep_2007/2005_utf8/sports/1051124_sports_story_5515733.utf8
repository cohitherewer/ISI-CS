The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sachins mind one of the strongest

Guest Column

I always found that when I played against great batsmen, I often ended up getting sucked into the emotion of the occasion. Everyone comes to watch Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting or Jacques Kallis bat and the rest of us just make up the numbers. 

As great as it is for the spectators to watch these players bat, the prime objective for any opposition is to get the great batsmen in early so that you can make it as difficult as possible for them and hopefully send them to the showers before they get going. 

If this does not happen, one can very easily become just another spectator as the great batsmen become stars of the show and the fielders become ball boys, running to and from the boundary all day long. Sachin Tendulkar is one of those players. 

I used to find it fascinating how some people in India actually left the stadium the moment Sachin got out. They had come solely to see their hero in action and if he was out, watching the rest of us wasnt quite as exciting (and rightly so!!) 

As Sachin gets set to become the most-capped player in ODI history, I have no doubt the little man has it in him to reach the 500-match milestone. 

As a fielder with supposedly the best seat in the house, one lived in fear of dropping a simple catch with Tendulkar on 15 and he going on to make 235. This happened to me in an unofficial Test in South Africa when I dropped him in what can only be described as one of the easiest catches of all time. Thank goodness he only got 45 and my embarrassing moment was watered down a little. 

One gets a sense if a player like Sachin gets going, there is actually very little one can do. He is running the show and please hurry up and bowl the next ball so he can send it on its way to the boundary. 

This happened on more than one occasion while I was playing. If the bowling side falls into this negative trap, they will be guaranteed to spend a day-and-a-half in the field. 

As with any of the greats, his positive play can also provide an opportunity and one needs to grab it. It will more than likely be a half-chance and if not taken, it will inevitably lead to the most famous two words in cricket ? if only... 

Mentally, I believe he has one of the strongest minds in the game. To go out to bat day in and day out with the massive expectation of a nation and to have been able to perform as consistently as he has is a remarkable achievement. 

I remember reading an article on him a few years ago when he spoke about the importance of every innings he played and how disappointed he felt when he did not perform. One always got the sense when he walked out to bat he was mentally in tune and was going to give 100 per cent for India on that day. 

Although I did not get to know him that well, he has always come across as a thoroughly decent human being. I get the impression that he is a humble man who does not take success for granted and is a great ambassador for the game. He has a huge amount to offer this great game and I sincerely hope he gets involved in some way once his playing days are over. (PTI)

 Ticket to politics for Vijayan 

 Vijayan says he is what he is today because of Karunakaran 

New Delhi: After scoring goals galore on the pitch and striking success on the silver screen, soccer star I.M. Vijayan on Thursday launched a new chapter by becoming a primary member of former Kerala chief minister K. Karunakaran?s National Congress (Indira). 

The 36-year-old footballer, who is also into the business of manufacturing sports goods, said entering politics as an NC (I) member was only because of his equation with the veteran leader. 

?It is purely because of my close association with the leader (Karunakaran)? He was one man who helped me make it big in soccer and that is why I joined the party,? Vijayan said over phone from his hometown Thrissur. 

Vijayan, who will don East Bengal colours this season, said but for Karunakaran?s help he would not have blossomed at all. 

?Back in 1986 when I was a 17-year-old, I approached him on the advice of former Kerala DGP M.K. Joseph and he gave me a job in Kerala Police,? Vijayan recalled. 

The lanky striker, who earned the nicknamed ?black pearl?, said Kerala Police gave him a chance to be their guest player and once he was 18, he was recruited as a constable. 

?In 1991 when I was about to leave them to join Mohun Bagan, he called and wanted me to continue in Kerala. But I had already signed the papers and had to leave. When I came back, he promoted me to assistant sub-inspector,? Vijayan said. 

?And after we won the 1993 Santosh Trophy in Kochi, he gave me a double promotion and made me inspector.? 

But Vijayan, who scored many a sensational goal including quite a few off direct free-kicks, pleaded ignorance about the real politik. 

?Please. I don?t know any politics,? he said, adding that he did not have any plans to contest elections on an NC (I) ticket. 

He also made a name as an actor in Kerala after proving his mettle with some eye-catching performances in four films. 

His latest venture ?Ben Johnson? was released two months ago and proved to be a hit in the box office. But Vijayan, who will be leaving for Calcutta on July 20, said no more films were in the pipeline right now. 

Asked whether he had ever been approached by any other political party, Vijayan replied in the negative. 

?For me, there is only Karunakaran and none else,? he signed off.

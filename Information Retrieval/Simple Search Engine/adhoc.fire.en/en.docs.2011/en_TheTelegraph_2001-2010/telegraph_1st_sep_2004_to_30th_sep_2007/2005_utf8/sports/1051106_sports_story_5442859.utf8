 Zaheer grabs 10 in match

Aurangabad: The four-day Duleep Trophy match between holders Central Zone and West Zone was poised on a razors edge at the end of a dramatic second days play here on Saturday. 

At stumps, after a see-saw in fortunes on a day that saw 18 wickets falling on a crumbling pitch, West were two for no loss chasing 137 following the collapse of Central for 150 in the second innings. 

Zaheer Khan, who grabbed six wickets in the Central first innings on Friday to bowl out defending champions for 206, was among the thick of wickets for the second day running with a fine effort of four for 70. 

He got fine support from another seamer Munaf Patel who picked up three wickets for 17 as Central, trailing West by only 14 on the first innings, were shot out in 36 overs after a 41-run opening partnership between Amit Pagnis (34) and Naman Ojha (22).

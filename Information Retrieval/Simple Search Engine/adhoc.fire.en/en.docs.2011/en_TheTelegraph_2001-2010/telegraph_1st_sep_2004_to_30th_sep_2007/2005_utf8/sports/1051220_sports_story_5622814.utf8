Rawalpindi: Pakistan clinched the one-day series against England by winning the fourth match by 13 runs on Monday. The hosts took an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series as their bowlers battled hard to successfully defend a total of 210 runs, eventually bowling England out for 197 in 48.1 overs. 

England were also beaten 2-0 in the Test series and have now lost their last three one-dayers after winning the first in Lahore by 42 runs. The last match will be played on Wednesday. 

The England tail fought bravely to the end after being reduced to 114 for eight with Ian Blackwell (29) and Kabir Ali (39 not out) putting on a fighting 50 runs for the ninth wicket. 

The partnership provided a glimmer of hope but Blackwell was run-out by a direct throw from substitute fielder Mohammed Asif while going for a quick single with the total on 164 in the 39th over. 

Ali then combined with last man James Anderson (11) to get within striking distance of their target before fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar had Anderson caught at slip by Younis Khan to end the match. 

Shahid Afridi was the stand-out performer for his team with three for 34 after pacer Rana Naved took the wickets of Matthew Prior and Andrew Strauss in successive balls in the fourth over.

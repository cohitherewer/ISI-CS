The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gatlin proves a point vs Powell

 I?m the greatest, says Justin Gatlin 

Eugene: World-record holder Tim Montgomery, his mind focused on a Monday doping hearing that could result in a lifetime ban, ran poorly and finished seventh in a fast 100m at the Prefontaine Classic on Saturday. 

American Montgomery clocked 10.10 seconds in a wind-assisted race while his compatriot and Olympic champion Justin Gatlin won in 9.84. Jamaican Asafa Powell was second in the same time with the wind advantage 3.4m per second. 

?As much as I tried to go out there with a clear mind, it just wasn?t there,? said Montgomery, who will appear before a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing in San Francisco to appeal against doping charges by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). 

?I just can?t fool myself. My main focus is on Monday. If your life was to depend on tomorrow, do you think you could be racing with a clear mind today?? the 30-year-old asked reporters. ?I can?t sleep, I cannot eat. It?s like you lost your love. 

Montgomery set the 100m world record of 9.78 seconds in 2002. 

Gatlin said he had something to prove in the race with Powell, who was ranked No. 1 in the world. 

?Most definitely,? he said of the Jamaican, who ran a non-wind-aided 9.84 seconds earlier this year. ?I am the Olympic champion and I had to show everybody I am the greatest.? 

Olympic 110m hurdles gold medallist and co-world record holder Liu Xiang of China also proved he is the world?s best in his event. 

Liu finished strong to clock 13.06 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year. He said he was not pleased with his race over the first three hurdles, but liked the way he finished. 

Four-times world champion Allen Johnson, who fell in the early rounds of last year?s Olympics in Athens, had bad luck again on Saturday. He was disqualified from the race for a false start. 

British marathon world-record holder Paula Radcliffe had hoped to run a personal best in a rare appearance in the women?s 1,500 m. However, a tumble in which six runners, including Radcliffe, went down with 600m to go ruined her chances. 

The Briton scraped both hands and bruised her knees in the fall before finishing in a time of 4:13.13 for sixth place. American Christin Wurth won in 4:09.45. 

 Anju sixth 

Anju Bobby George?s disappointing form continued when she managed to clear only 6.35m to be sixth in a field of eight. Russian world No. 3 Tatyana Kotova topped the field with a leap of 6.80. Second and third place went to Jamaican Elva Goulbourne (6.64) and American Grace Upshaw (6.49). 

The prestigious meet, named after American athlete Steve Prefontaine who died at the age of 24, had been a lucky one for Anju as she recorded a wind-assisted 6.83 to finish third last year. She later repeated the distance, without any wind help, at the Athens Olympics. (Agencies)

Calcutta: Perhaps taking a leaf out of a romantic novel which ends with Jane reuniting with John, East Bengal club on Thursday doused all the fire raging around the teams spate of debacles and requested Subhas Bhowmick to continue. The beleaguered coach returned happy and hoping to see a change in fortunes during the rest of the season. 

As a coach, Im taking full responsibility for the teams failures (in the CFL Premier League and Federation Cup) and Im ready to quit. But as long as the club cant find an alternative, Ill continue. After all, I owe a lot to the club both as a player and coach, Bhowmick said. He, however, didnt spell out his future plans, nor the time for kicking off the teams practice, post-Federation Cup. 

This was just an epilogue of a high-voltage drama, staged at the club tent under full media glare, when Bhowmick wanted to resign and the club officials, instead, asked him not to leave the ground and face the challenge. 

The failure in the Federation Cup has come as a shock to me and I need time to get out of it. A win in the tournament would have given us a passage to the AFC Cup, which was my ultimate target, Bhowmick stated during an open forum. 

Bhowmick, however, made his stand clear about not taking Bhaichung Bhutia to Goa. He didnt join the camp at Shantiniketan, which was mandatory for each player to play in the Federation Cup, he remarked. 

The club was learnt to have sounded out a few options for the hot seat.

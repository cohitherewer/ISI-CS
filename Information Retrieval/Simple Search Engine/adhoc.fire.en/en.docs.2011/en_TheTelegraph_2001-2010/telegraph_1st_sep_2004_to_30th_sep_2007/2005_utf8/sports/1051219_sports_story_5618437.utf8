 Aussies in box seat

 - Hodge leads charge vs SA 

Perth: Brad Hodge, Mike Hussey and Ricky Ponting scored half-centuries on Sunday to put Australia in command of the opening Test with South Africa. 

Hodge survived a dropped catch on 13 to score an unbeaten 91, Hussey got a let-off on 46 to end the day on unbeaten 54. 

Ponting got the benefit of two dubious decisions to make 53 and help Australia open a 272-run lead with six second-innings wickets in hand. 

Australia, trailing by 38 on the first innings, started the day on 38 for one but were back in control at 310 for four at the close after an absorbing day. 

The hosts lost nightwatchman Brett Lee for 32 an hour after the start, then Justin Langer for 47 and Ponting between lunch and tea. Hodge and Hussey batted through the extended last session with an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 126. Hodge, playing in just his third Test, got off the mark first ball with a rare five.

 Clay can test steadiest of nerves: Agassi

 - Sometimes you may hit four great shots and still lose the point 

Paris: Pete Sampras proved you dont have to behave like John McEnroe to win but, as legendary street-fighter Jimmy Connors says, its not just shot-making that wins matches. 

And Andre Agassi, who allowed the 30-year-old Andres Gomez to outwit him as a 20-year-old in the 1990 Roland Garros final before triumphing nine years later, agrees clay court tennis can test the steadiest nerves. 

Sometimes you hit four great shots and still lose the point, he warns. 

So when mind games start at Roland Garros next Monday, can the likes of Amelie Mauresmo or Tim Henman avoid falling off the pace when the pressure is greatest? 

Connors says what he misses most is the mind games. 

Figuring out a way to win matches from four-all in the fifth set, where its about more than just tennis, where you have to fight the outside elements and inside demons, is what the American believes is required to win at the top. 

You have to fight to overcome a person who is as good as, if not better than you. 

And he relishes his legendary rivalry with McEnroe and Bjorn Borg. 

He might have been churning inside but he would not let that out, he said of Borg. 

McEnroe and I, it was who was going to butt heads the hardest. 

Just who of Borg and McEnroe was the greatest is difficult to say. They both played each other 14 times between 1987 and 1991, winning seven matches apiece. 

Borg won 62 singles titles, including Wimbledon five times consecutively and the French Open six times. 

McEnroe won 83 singles titles, including seven Grand Slams. 

But Borg, the greatest athlete tennis has seen, survived a potentially devastating fourth set tie-breaker to beat the immensely-talented McEnroe in the 1980 Wimbledon final. 

McEnroe took that tie-breaker 18-16 after saving five match points but the American could win only three points against serve in the fifth set and at 7-6 the Swede unleashed two superb returns to win his fifth ? and last ? Wimbledon title. 

But seven-time Grand Slam winner Mats Wilander says you dont always have to play your best to win. 

You can try to figure out a way thats going to make the other guy play worse, he says. 

Connors and McEnroe were masters at winding up opponents. 

But boxing legend Muhammad Ali was probably better at hitting a raw nerve. Connors would approve of that. 

And former Australia Test cricket captain Steve Waugh proved you have to have mental toughness to win. 

And the never-say-die player also believed sledging or mental disintegration was all part of the game. 

But Connors feels the gladiatorial aspect of tennis makes it the most demanding. Its everything-right-there-in-your face. You are what you are. 

So is Mauresmo, who climbed to No.1 in the world for a couple of weeks last year without winning a Grand Slam, just too nice? 

Her new mentor, Yannick Noah, the first Frenchman to win Roland Garros in 37 years when he triumphed in 1983, admits the difference between winning and losing is paper thin. 

Everybody knows the French have a problem with winning, he says ominously.

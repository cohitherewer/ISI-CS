Jamshedpur: Come Sunday and Sourav Ganguly will be rooting for the Mithali Raj-captained Indian women?s team, which is going to face Australia in the World Cup final in Centurion. 

?Hope the women take ?revenge? for the defeat we suffered in the 2003 final (in Johannesburg)... This time, the Australians must be beaten,? the Team India captain told The Telegraph. 

Good wishes, by the way, are being communicated to Mithali and her teammates.

 Convert chances: Skipper

Peshawar: After disappointing their fans in Quetta with some ordinary soccer, India would be keen to put up a better display against Pakistan in the second match of the National Bank series here on Thursday. 

India captain S. Venkatesh said he was looking forward to a much better show from his strikers and that, in spite of being held to a 1-1 draw, his team looked a better side in the opening match. 

We created more opportunities and inroads in the Pakistan defence. Now all we need to do is to convert those chances and control the pace of the game for the full 90 minutes, he said. 

But the teams preparations received a setback with the news that team trainer Pradeep Duttas father passed away in Calcutta. 

It is a disturbing news for everyone because we are a closely-knit team and we care very much for each others well-being, Venkatesh said. 

Pakistan, on the other hand, were oozing with confidence ahead of Thursdays match. (PTI)

 Shoaib demands explanation

 Shoaib maintains he is fit 

Karachi: Heartbroken after being ignored for the West Indies tour, Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar Tuesday demanded an explanation from the countrys cricket authorities for his ouster from the team. 

In an interview here at the National Stadium, where he had come to shoot a promo for Rashid Latif Cricket Academy, Shoaib, nevertheless, vowed not to give up and promised that he would be back in the side for the home series against England. 

?I am disappointed and heart-broken. I had conveyed my availability (for the West Indies tour) because I was convinced that I was fit. But even then, I have not been considered,? Shoaib said. 

?What puzzles me the most is that nobody is willing to tell me whether I have been dropped on fitness grounds or disciplinary reasons or for not appearing before PCBs medical commission to prove fitness,? the 29-year-old said. 

Shoaib, who is Pakistans most successful current bowler, was called back halfway through the Australian tour earlier this year because of a hamstring injury. He then pulled out from the tour of India before being overlooked for the West Indies tour. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board and the team management have issued contrasting statements that have made Shoaibs omission a mystery. 

?The final decision regarding the composition of the team is of the selectors and if they dont want to select me, I respect that,? Shoaib said. 

?But I want to know why I have been left out and they (selectors) owe me that (explanation). I maintain that I am fit and thats what I have to say about myself,? Shoaib, who has twice broken the 100-mile barrier, said. 

?I am willing to take this in its stride because its part of the game. As a professional you have ups and downs. But, then you should know why you are not part of the team. 

?No one can question or doubt my commitment to the team. In the last 15 odd Tests, I have taken nearly 80 wickets and have bowled my heart out. Internationally, I am tagged as a hard worker and someone who wants to perform and thats why people love me. 

?I am heart-broken but that doesnt mean that I have given up.? (PTI)

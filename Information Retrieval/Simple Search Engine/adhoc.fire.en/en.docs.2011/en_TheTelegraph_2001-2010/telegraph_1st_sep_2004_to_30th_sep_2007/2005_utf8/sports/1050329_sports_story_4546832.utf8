Bangalore: Pakistan restored their pride with a thrilling 168-run win over India in the third and final cricket Test, exploiting a spineless batting display by the hosts to level the series 1-1 here on Monday. 

The Indians, facing a daunting 383 for victory, wilted under pressure and paid a heavy price for their defensive approach as they were bundled out for 214 on a pulsating fifth day at the M. Chinaswamy Stadium. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, though, has been banned for one Test for showing dissent on Monday. 

Pakistan manager Saleem Altaf said, ?We had a hearing with the match referee Chris Broad on two counts of excessive appealing and dissent. On the first, he has been fined 30 per cent of his match fees and on the second, a level two offence, he has been given a one-Test match ban.? 

Things looked rosy for India when openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir put on 87 runs, but the hosts brought down the shutter a little too early after Sehwag?s dismissal. 

The defensive tactic backfired on a pitch of variable bounce as India suffered a familiar middle-order collapse. From 164 for seven, the lower order led by Anil Kumble (37 n.o.) waged a courageous, but futile battle. The end came with 6.1 overs still to go. 

It was a fantastic team effort by Pakistan with Shahid Afridi (3/13) delivering the crucial blows, including the wickets of Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav Ganguly. The memorable win helped Pakistan level the series and shed the underdog tag, while the Indians let go an opportunity to become the second-highest ranked team for the first time ever. 

A draw would have put them on par with England, instead they now remain in the third place in the ICC Test rankings. 

The much-vaunted quartet of Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman could muster only 39 runs between them. Tendulkar (16) in the process became India?s highest run-getter, surpassing Sunil Gavaskar. 

Younis Khan, with a record double century in the first innings, was named Man of the Match. 

Resuming at 25 for no loss, India made a cautious start. But it was not long before Sehwag opened his shoulders and launched into the rival bowling. He hit three successive boundaries of Razzaq in his second over and an uppish off drive off Danish Kaneria beat the mid-off fielder. 

It would have been little consolation for free-flowing Sehwag that he was adjudged Man of the Series after he was run out owing to a misunderstanding between him and Gambhir. 

Gambhir reached his second career 50 with a single off Kaneria. But after lunch, he was adjudged leg before to Mohammed Sami. Ten runs later, Rahul Dravid prodded at off spinner Arshad Khan, and Younis Khan at silly point plucked out of thin air a sharp reflex catch. 

Afridi then trapped Laxman (5) plumb in front with a faster one before he left captain Sourav Ganguly (2) in disbelief with a huge leg break that knocked his off stump. 

Tendulkar was reprieved when Asim Kamal failed to 

hold on to a catch at forward short leg when Tendulkar was caught off guard by 

a rising delivery from Sami.

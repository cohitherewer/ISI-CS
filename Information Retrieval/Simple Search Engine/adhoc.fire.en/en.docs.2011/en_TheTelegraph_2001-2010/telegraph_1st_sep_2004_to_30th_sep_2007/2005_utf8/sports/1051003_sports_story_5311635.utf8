 Warsaw: Otylia Jedrzejczak, Poland?s Olympic gold-medal-winning swimmer, is expected to recover from a car crash on Saturday in which her brother was killed, doctors said on Sunday. ?She is in good condition? and should recover after three or four months of physiotherapy,? Dr Wlodzimierz Nowatorski, chief surgeon at the hospital in Plock to which she was rushed, told a news conference.

 Jedrzejczak?s brother Szymon, 19 and also a swimmer was killed on impact when the car crashed into a tree. Jedrzejczak, 22, is a world record holder who won butterfly gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics and this year?s World Swimming Championships in Montreal.

 The accident occurred in a rural area some 40kms north-west of Warsaw, when Jedrzejczak failed to overtake a string of vehicles on a two-lane road and veered into a roadside ditch to avoid an oncoming car.

Loeb finished runner-up to Peugeot?s Marcus Gronholm. He joins Finnish drivers Juha Kankkunen (1986-1987) and Tommi Makinen (1996-1999) and Italian Massimo Biasion (1988-1989) in winning consecutive titles.

 The women?s title went to Romania?s Constantin Tomescu, who led from the start to finish in 1:09:17, ahead of Lornah Kiplagat of The Netherlands (1:10:19) and Kenya?s Susan Chepkemei (1:10:20).

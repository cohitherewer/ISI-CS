Calcutta: This might be the lifetime opportunity for a team like Ever-Ready when they take on European giants Bayern Munich in the final of the 111th IFA Shield at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

Ever-Ready coach Anjan Nath has done sort of a miracle with his boys. However, even after causing the upsets in the competition ? wins over JCT and East Bengal ? his team is neither complacent nor nervous at the prospect of facing Bayern Munich in the final. 

This will be a good opportunity for us as we are representing the country. The boys are motivated as they are playing against a big team, but they are not nervous. The urge to give the best comes from within. This is a big chance for my boys to show some quality football, said Nath. 

Nath, who played second fiddle to Amal Dutta and Aloke Mukherjee ??? both of whom coached the team in the past ??? for the last eight years, will take this opportunity to make a mark in the coaching arena. 

His main aim now is to better his teams performance in the CFL Premier Division and emerge as the fourth leading team in the city. The job seems tough against a big international team, but the Ever-Ready coach feels that there is no pressure on them to achieve it. 

Ever-Ready practised at the Central Park in Salt Lake on Saturday. On the sidelines, Nath said: We are very excited. I dont think that any team is unbeatable. The one who plays better on a particular day lifts the trophy. 

Meanwhile, Bayern Munich skipped practice to visit the Belur Math and Jorasanko Thakur Bari. The players were very surprised to know that for Swami Vivekananda ?? who established the Belur Math?? football was bigger than religion. The team will have a short practice session on Sunday morning at the Howrah Municipal Stadium. 

However coach Herman Gerland and assistant coach Gerd Muller turned up for a programme organised by an international sports apparel maker. 

When asked about their performance in the last match against Mohammedan Sporting, Muller said: I am satisfied with the result, but not with our performance. 

In the last match against Mohammedan Sporting, they took as many as 29 shots, but got it right on only two occasions. This is obviously a matter of concern for us, but I dont think that we can correct it overnight. 

However the coach assured that it will be a different ball game in the final. 

For Ever-Ready it will be the same old tactics, playing the defensive and then going for counter attack. Amulya Mondals injury seems to have caused wrinkles on the coachs forehead, but he felt that the defender would be fit. 

Meanwhile, in the evening, visiting Bayern Munich players joined in a face-to-face interaction with officials of Lufthansa, which is the corporate sponsor of the club.

 India denied permission to field animals

Melbourne: The organisers of next years Commonwealth Games in Australia have refused India permission to bring exotic animals for the closing ceremony at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

Melbourne 2006 Games chairman Ron Walker said India would not be permitted to bring tigers and elephants to Melbourne to take part in a hand-over ceremony for the 2010 Games, to be held in New Delhi, despite them being part of Indias cultural diversity. 

India, which will take possession of the Games ceremonial flag during the closing ceremony, has asked organisers in London if it can increase its portion of the ceremony beyond 10 minutes, assume creative control and bring 1,000 people to Melbourne. 

Walker said India would also be constrained by the artistic director the organisers had contracted for the ceremony, Jack Morton Worldwide, and the length of the ceremony. 

It appears they want to do a 20-minute segment, which is impossible? The closing ceremony is a huge party and you cant have 20 minutes of a flag handing-over ceremony. It does not work like that, he was quoted as saying on Tuesday. 

Walker denied organisers were concerned that Indias proposals would overshadow the rest of the ceremony. Our ceremony in Manchester was conservative but made the point that Melbourne was the next venue, and thats all you really need to do. 

However, Walker said organisers would not cap the number of people India wanted to involve in the ceremony. (PTI)

 Justines strokes resembled stray bullets

The Greeks have recently developed a habit of upsetting tournament favourites and Eleni Daniilidou is the latest name to put alongside the footballers who won Euro 2004 after she defeated Justine Henin-Hardenne, the No. 7 seed, in the first round. 

Besides Maria Sharapova, the champion, the Belgian with the beautiful backhand was the woman most likely to win this years Wimbledon title on the back of her remarkable victory at the French Open. Nick Bollettieri said so, Martina Navratilova said so, the bookmakers said so. Daniilidou, on the other hand, had something different to say. 

The Greek also cites her favourite stroke as the backhand and while it was not as graceful as her opponents, it was just as effective. 

Despite the flattering 6-2 scoreline in the second set, Henin-Hardenne resembled a player who had left her game on the Eurostar. Her concentration was lacking and her groundstrokes more akin to stray bullets than the surefire artillery she usually packs. 

Daniilidou likes the grass and is a fighter. In front of her home crowd at the Athens Olympics, she pulled off a heroic victory against Magdalena Maleeva on virtually one leg after collapsing with cramp. 

The prospect of joining the ranks of Serena Williams, Maureen Connolly, Margaret Court, Steffi Graf, Navratilova, Chris Evert and Billie Jean King, who have the full complement of Grand Slam titles, was pressure enough, but Henin-Hardenne was further burdened by a recurrent hamstring injury.

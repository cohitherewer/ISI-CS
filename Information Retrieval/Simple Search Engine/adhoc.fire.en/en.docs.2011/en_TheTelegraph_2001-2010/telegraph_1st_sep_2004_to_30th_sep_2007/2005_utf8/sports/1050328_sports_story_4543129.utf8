London: Poland lit up a busy night of World Cup action with an 8-0 thrashing of Azerbaijan on Saturday as the European zone qualifying competition resumed with a bang after the winter break. 

While the Poles scored eight to record their biggest win for 42 years, England, Croatia, Belgium and the Czech Republic all cracked in four goals on a day of 17 qualifiers. 

Former world and European champions France, however, continued to struggle in front of goal as they were held 0-0 by Switzerland in Paris. A series of missed chances, notably by striker David Trezeguet, condemned France to a sixth successive home draw, four of them goalless. 

There were also good wins for Sweden, Slovakia, Greece, Turkey, Denmark and Austria. 

It was a total mismatch in Warsaw as striker Tomasz Frankowski hit a hattrick in Poland?s biggest win since a 9-0 friendly success over Norway 42 years ago. 

Frankowski put them ahead in the 12th minute and a comical own goal by Aftandil Hajiyev and a goal by midfielder Kamil Kosowski made it 3-0 at the break. 

Frankowski completed his hattrick with two goals in three minutes just past the hour, Jacek Krzynoweks got the sixth and substitute Marek Saganowski grabbed two in the last eight minutes. 

The thumping win takes Poland to 12 points, one behind England, who beat Northern Ireland 4-0 thanks to four goals in 17 minutes at the start of the second half. 

The Euro 2004 semi-finalists had a flying start as Philip Cocu headed in after 38 seconds and they sealed the win six minutes from time through 18-year-old debutant Ryan Babel. 

European champions Greece continued their renaissance as a 3-1 win in Georgia hauled them to 11 points, within three points of Group II leaders Ukraine, who did not play. 

Argentina win 

In South American action, Argentina took a huge step closer to the 2006 World Cup by beating Bolivia 2-1 in La Paz at 3,600 metres above sea level on Saturday. 

Argentina?s win took them on to 25 points from 12 games, five ahead of world champions Brazil. Ecuador and Paraguay both have 16 points. Then come Uruguay (15), Colombia, Chile and Venezuela (14), Peru (13) and Bolivia (10), the only team without a realistic hope of qualifying.

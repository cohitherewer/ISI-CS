 Ward jailed for possessing cocaine

London: Former West Ham United and Everton midfielder Mark Ward was jailed for eight years on Tuesday after admitting possessing cocaine with intent to supply. 

Ward was arrested at a house on Merseyside in May after a police raid uncovered four kilos of cocaine with an estimated street value of up to ?645,000 ($1.13 million). 

Ward moved to West Ham in 1985 after making his name with Oldham Athletic. He later sealed ?1 million moves to Manchester City and Everton. (REUTERS)

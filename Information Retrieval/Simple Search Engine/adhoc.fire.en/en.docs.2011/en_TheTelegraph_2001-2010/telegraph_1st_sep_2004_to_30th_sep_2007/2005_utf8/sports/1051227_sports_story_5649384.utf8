 Madrid: American cyclist Lance Armstrong, who won his seventh Tour de France in July, has been voted Sports Personality of the Year, according to a poll published in a Spanish daily on Monday.

 Armstrong beat Spain?s first Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso and Italian motorcycle rider Valentino Rossi in the poll of 100 leading Spanish sporting figures.

 The Spanish Sportsperson of the Year was Alonso and the Revelation of the Year was 19-year-old tennis player Rafael Nadal who won the French Open and 10 other ATP tournaments this year.

 Alonso?s victory in the Formula One world championship was voted the outstanding sports event of the year. 

 Doha: Fiji?s world No. 2 Vijai Singh will take part in the $2 million Qatar Masters Golf Tournament, an event co-sanctioned by the European PGA Tour and the Asian Tour next month, organisers said on Monday.

 Last year?s winner, Ernie Els of South Africa, had already confirmed his entry for the tournament and Singh?s entry further boosts the tournament?s profile.

 Retief Goosen of South Africa and Britons David Howell, Darren Clarke, Paul McGinley and Lee Westwood are also scheduled to compete in the event from January 26 to 29. 

 New Delhi: Bharat Petroleum exhibited aggressive hockey to stun Indian Airlines 2-0 in a Super League match of the 42nd Nehru Hockey Tournament at the Shivaji Stadium here on Monday. The first goal came in the ninth minute as Amar Aiyamma took a loose ball from the midfield to put it past the hapless IA goalie.

 In the 20th minute, drag-flicker Len Aiyappa extended the lead for Bharat Petroleum by converting a penalty corner.

 In other matches, Punjab Police defeated CRPF 3-1 and Punjab and Sindh Bank beat Tamil Nadu XI 3-0 to qualify for the quarters.

 London: Manchester United have agreed an undisclosed fee with Spartak Moscow for defender Nemanja Vidic, the Premier League club announced on its website.

 The Serbia and Montenegro international is expected to complete the move when the transfer window opens on January 1.

 ?Nemanja is a quick, aggressive centre-half and at 24 will be a terrific addition to the squad,? United manager Alex Ferguson was quoted as saying on the club?s website on Sunday. Media reports suggest the fee to be around ? 7 m. 

 Vidic was captain of his first club Red Star Belgrade before moving to Spartak in 2004. The 24-year-old attracted interest from Serie A, and was also tracked by Arsenal and Liverpool. 

 Madrid: Osasuna have become the first Spanish soccer club to change the name of their stadium as part of a sponsorship deal.

 Uefas warning to clubs 

Brussels: European politicians and Uefa have warned clubs, players and national associations they face expulsion from the game if found guilty of sustained racism. 

The warning came at the European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday where MEPs are being asked to back a bid by European soccers ruling body to blow the whistle on racism. 

Uefa vice-president Per Ravn Omdal said that clubs should not tolerate racism in any form. 

Clubs, players and associations who are found guilty will be punished severely and will be thrown out of the game if necessary, the Norwegian said. 

Omdal will join five members of the European Parliament and former Chelsea defender Paul Elliot in urging other MEPs to sign a written declaration on racism in football. 

If they are successful in getting at least half the parliament to sign the declaration then it will become binding. 

Uefa wants to give referees more authority to deal with incidents. 

Referees will be given the necessary power to abandon or cancel matches if necessary, Omdal said. 

We need referees and match officials to be tough on this issue. If they have been asleep then they need to wake up. 

The latest initiative comes days after Messinas Zoro, an Ivory Coast defender, was reduced to tears after being subjected to racist chants in a match against Inter Milan. 

Zoro picked up the ball and planned to hand it to the fourth official as he walked off. 

However, Adriano and Obafemi Martins, Inters Brazilian and Nigerian forwards, calmed Zoro down and apologised for the fans behaviour. 

They persuaded Zoro that to leave the field to the racists was a precedent soccer could ill afford.

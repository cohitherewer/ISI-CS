 Figo may leave Real 

Madrid: Portuguese winger Luis Figo is reconsidering his decision to retire from international football after being dropped by Real Madrid. 

The 32-year-old also hinted at a possible premature departure from Real before his contract expires at the end of next season. ?I left the national team because I was tired and wanted to concentrate on playing for my club,? he told a news conference on Wednesday. 

?But as I?m not playing at the moment my feelings have changed. I know that I can play at the top level for another two more years and I will do that wherever I feel useful.? 

Figo was dropped by coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo from the starting line-up for the clash against Barcelona this month. He also started on the bench for last week?s match against Levante. (Reuters)

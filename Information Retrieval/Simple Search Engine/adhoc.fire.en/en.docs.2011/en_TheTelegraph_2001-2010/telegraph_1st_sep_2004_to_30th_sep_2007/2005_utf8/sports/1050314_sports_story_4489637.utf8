Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami could have walked 

away with nearly half a dozen goals and Gauranga Dutta a hattrick on Sunday. Instead, 

they had to remain satisfied with a solitary goal win over State Bank of Travancore 

(SBT) in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup tie at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Man-of-the-Match Suley Musah scored the all-important goal in the 30th minute following a neat back pass off Surajit Bose from inside the box to take the home side to 14 points from 12 outings to SBT?s nine. 

Tollygunge Agragami coach Biswajit Das Saturday said that he had earmarked SBT match to get maximum points. The home team, playing with all three foreigners, began the game in right earnest with Gauranga coming close to score in the 12th minute. 

But the visitors were not to be left behind. And despite going down Sunday, they produced a better display than their rivals. Playing passes along the ground they stretched the flanks and increased men during attacks. But for some poor finishing, they could have had a couple of goals at least. Often they moved the entire defence close to the centre circle to provide thrust upwards. During this period, the home side looked to attack on the counter. 

With only Akeem Aboanle upfront, they started using Surajit and Gauranga?s pace to good effect. However, they were guilty of floating long aerial passes towards Akeem, which were quite easily cut off. However, the goal opened the floodgates as Tollygunge started using the width of the pitch to good effect. 

The game became much more open as SBT went in search for an equaliser. Abdul Hakkim should have made it 1-1, but his header went over the bar with only the goalkeeper to beat. He was again the culprit in second session when he got past goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh and instead of shooting at the goal, he decided to send a back pass, that was timely cleared by Musah. 

The change of ends witnessed a flurry of attacks on the SBT goal. And had it not been for visitors? custodian Harshal Rahman, who ought to have been declared Man-of-the-Match, the team from Kerala would have faced greater humiliation. Time and again he produced outstanding saves to deny Gauranga and Co. 

At least on three occasions he blocked attempts from Gauranga on a one-to one situation. In trying to force a equaliser, SBT left a lot of open spaces in the middle-third, which made Tollygunge?s task a lot easier.

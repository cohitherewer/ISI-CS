 Germany keen to top group A

 - Klinsmann will be forced to make change in defence 

Frankfurt: Coach Juergen Klinsmann will make a reluctant change in defence on Tuesday when Germany challenge historic rivals Argentina for first place in Confederations Cup group A. 

Germanys back-four finally looked like they were getting their act together in a 3-0 win over Tunisia on Saturday, a result that gave the hosts a maximum six points from two games. 

It was a big improvement on the defending in a 4-3 win ov-er Australia but a second yellow card for right-back Arne Frie-drich will frustrate Klinsmanns quest for continuity. 

We have to make a change and I have two strong alternatives in Andreas Hinkel and Patrick Owomoyela, Klinsmann said before the team departed for Nuremberg. Were looking for continuity in this tournament and its important for us to win the group. Im not going to change the basis of the team. 

Like Germany, Argentina are assured of a place in the last four after Luciano Figueroas hattrick gave them a 4-2 win over Australia on Saturday. 

A draw would be enough to send Germany through as group winners on goal-difference with their semi-final opponents likely to be Brazil after the world champions surprise 0-1 loss to Mexico on Sunday left them in second place in group B. 

Tuesdays game in Nuremberg will be another early trial of strength for two sides steeped in World Cup history, and who will be among the favou-rites again when the competition comes to Germany next year. 

West Germany and Argentina contested two consecutive World Cup finals in 1986 and 1990, the South Americans winning the first in Mexico, with Germany gaining their revenge four years later in Italy.

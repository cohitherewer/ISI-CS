Monza: Indias Narain Karthikeyan on Saturday walked out of a spectacular accident during practice unhurt and put up a strong show to qualify 19th for Sundays Italian Grand Prix. 

He crashed heavily in the final session, flying across the gravel into the tyre barriers, but came out of it unscathed. 

Karthikeyan spun out at the end of the morning practice, which caused a fair amount of damage to his car. 

His mechanics did a fantastic job to repair his car on time for qualifying, in which he and teammate Tiago Monteiro had clean laps. 

My lap was okay considering the accident I had this morning when I spun the car while braking trying to get heat into a new set of tyres, said Karthikeyan. I am feeling a bit sore, though. 

Monteiro said the new Jordan-Toyota EJ15B felt ok, but Monza was not the right track to judge the its performance. 

Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, meanwhile, put race favourites McLaren on pole, with Renaults championship leader Fernando Alonso alongside. 

Montoyas teammate Kimi Raikkonen, winner of the last two races but 24 points behind Spaniard Alonso, was fastest in qualifying but an earlier engine failure cost him 10 places. 

Its not going to be easy, said Raikkonen after the latest blow to his championship hopes. But we cannot change the situation so we need to make the most of it. 

As long as we get through the first corner without any problems, we have a good chance to fight for the race, added Raikkonen, who won in Canada from seventh on the grid and finished second from 13th in France. He felt that the power drain from his engine on the last lap of final practice and Mercedes traced the problem to an inlet valve. 

Montoya lapped 0.176 of a second slower than Raikkonens 1: 20.878. 

Briton Jenson Button, in a BAR, shares the second row with Japanese teammate Takuma Sato. 

Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher qualified sixth, one place ahead of teammate Rubens Barrichello, and shares the third row with Italian Jarno Trulli in Toyota. 

Montoya said he was happy with his lap, with McLaren clearly faster than their rivals. The pole was the 12th of his career and first of the season, boosting McLarens chances in the constructors championship. They currently trail Renault by nine points. 

Brazilian Antonio Pizzonia, whose last race was at Monza in 2004 when he stood in for injured Ralf Schumacher, returned as a late replacement for another German at Williams. 

Nick Heidfeld crashed heavily in testing last week at Monza and complained of a headache on Saturday morning. Doctors advised him not to drive. He finished 16th.

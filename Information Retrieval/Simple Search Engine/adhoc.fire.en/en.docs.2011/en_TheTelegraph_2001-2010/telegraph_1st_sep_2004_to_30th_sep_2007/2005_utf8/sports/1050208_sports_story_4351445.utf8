 ODI format tiring, feels Buchanan

 John Buchanan 

Sydney: Australia coach John Buchanan feels one-day cricket is in need for an overhaul, a day after his team clinched the tri-series defeating Pakistan. 

Buchanan told reporters on Monday that he was not in favour of the increasingly popular Twenty20 matches replacing the 50-over format, but said rule changes were needed for the one-dayers. 

?I think it?s a bit of a tired old format, but that?s what the rules are and that?s what we play to,? he said. 

?So until somebody changes the game, then really it?s our duty to work out ways and means in which we play better cricket in the existing format ? I guess that?s what we try to do,? he said. 

Australia beat Pakistan by 31 runs in Sydney on Sunday in the second game of the best-of-three finals. . 

Buchanan refused to be drawn on whether out-of-form opening batsman Matthew Hayden would be reinstated for Australia?s tour of New Zealand beginning February 17 when selectors meet to pick the squad on Tuesday. 

But he said Hayden was not far off from recapturing his form. (AFP)

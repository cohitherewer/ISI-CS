 Saqlain unsure of comeback

Karachi: Pakistan off spinner Saqlain Mushtaq does not expect to make his Test comeback against England despite recovering well from a chronic knee injury. 

The 28-year-old has warned his teammates to expect a hard battle in the three-match series against England, who are keen to challenge Australia for top spot in the world rankings. 

The injury has healed and I resumed playing first-class cricket for Surrey this season. But a comeback against England is not likely because I still need more match practice and training, said Saqlain. 

After beating Australia, England are keen to show everyone their Ashes victory was not a fluke. Pakistan should expect on and off the field pressure tactics and mind games, he said. (REUTERS)

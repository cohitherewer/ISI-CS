The Telegraph - Calcutta

 2-0 vs Pakistan will take India to No. 2

 - ICC to determine who merits higher billing between Gavaskar and Tendulkar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mumbai: A 2-0 scoreline in the forthcoming 

 three-Test series against Pakistan, at home, will take Team 

 India to No. 2 in the LG-ICC rankings. Our best, so far, 

 is the No. 3 position achieved after last month?s win over 

 South Africa. 

So, if Sourav Ganguly and Co. actually need something outside the traditional rivalry to spur them on, well, they now have it. Each Test win is worth a point and a bonus (again, one point) is given for winning a series. 

Currently, India have a rating of 108 points, two behind England?s. The Australians are well ahead ? on 130. 

According to a projection made by the world body and the rankings? sponsors, a 2-0 win is going to take India to 111, one clear of the present No. 2. A 3-0 scoreline will, of course, increase that lead by a further one point. 

However, a 1-0 win isn?t going to affect India?s No. 3 standing as a recalculation will then see England ahead on the decimal-count. An Indian defeat, of course, is going to change equations. 

While the recent LG-ICC tie-up has seen the emergence of an ?improved? system of ranking teams both in Tests and ODIs, the one for individual players (batsmen, bowlers) is a continuation of the earlier formula ? incidentally, revised by Ted Dexter Associates. 

Significantly, to reflect current form, the rankings have been limited to performances in the last three-four years for Tests and the past two-three years for ODIs. 

That was confirmed at a workshop here on Friday afternoon, where the ICC?s general manager (cricket), David Richardson, and LG?s marketing head, Salil Kapoor, were present. 

Unusually, though, there?s no bonus for winning a one-day series. In fact, all ODIs will be treated equally. Players, however, are going to get weightage for World Cup performances. 

Test rankings are to be updated after every series. As for the ODIs, the updating will be after each match. 

 Richardson, by the way, informed that one of the ?special 

 projects? is to determine who merits higher billing ? Sunil 

 Gavaskar or Sachin Tendulkar. Another seeks to identify 

 the best team in different eras. 

 Footnote: Richardson endorsed 

 a suggestion from The Telegraph that the ICC ought to review 

 the conventional classification of an allrounder and place 

 a wicketkeeper-batsman like Adam Gilchrist in that category. 

 Surely, it?s time for an officially approved change?

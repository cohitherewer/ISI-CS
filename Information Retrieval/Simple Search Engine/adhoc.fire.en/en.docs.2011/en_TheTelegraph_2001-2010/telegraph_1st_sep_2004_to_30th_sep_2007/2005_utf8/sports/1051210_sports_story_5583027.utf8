 Record playing on Sachins mind: Greg

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: While the nation is busy speculating on will-he-or-will-he-not, Greg Chappell feels the quest for the magical 35th century may have weighed too much on the shoulders of Sachin Tendulkar. 

After three days of complete washouts in Chennai, the maestro got his chance to rewrite the record books. The disappointing 126-ball 22 at the Chepauk only increased the wait and with it the pressure. 

As the Kotla prepared for the second Test, the Team India coach admitted on Friday that the record was playing on Sachins mind. Theres nothing wrong in it... when somebody is approaching a world record, it has to play big at the back of his mind, Chappell said during his interaction with the media. 

The Australian, however, refused to believe that the record put Sachin into sort of a shell, affecting his natural flamboyance. 

We all know that moment is not far away. I dont wish to say he has been in a shell, but its clear he is trying to do things as quickly as possible. Once he achieves it, well see more of the natural Sachin, he pointed out.

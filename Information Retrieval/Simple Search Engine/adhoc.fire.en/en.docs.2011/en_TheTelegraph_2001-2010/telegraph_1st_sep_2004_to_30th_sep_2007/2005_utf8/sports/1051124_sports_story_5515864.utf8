 BCCI to select venues judiciously, says Nair

Chennai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will be selecting the venues judiciously in future to ensure that matches are not cancelled due to rain, according to BCCI secretary S. K. Nair. 

 The BCCI always cares for the paying public and we will take the necessary steps to see that matches are not allotted to venues when monsoon rains are on the cards, he said. 

In future we will select venues judiciously to avoid such happenings like the rained off tie between India and South Africa here yesterday, he said. 

Nair said that tours are fixed well in advance according to the International Cricket Council (ICC)s fixtures programme, but BCCI allots the matches to different venues on rotation policy. 

The option to stage the match is left to the units concerned. 

Explaining the rotation policy of the Board, Nair said If a unit concerned declines to accept the holding of a match, the chance is given to the next unit in line. 

The unit which declines to stage loses its chance and is placed at the bottom of the rotation formula. 

On refund of ticket money since no play was possible, Nair said: All the staging associations insure the match. I cannot speak for refunding of money but the decision rests with the Tamil Nadu unit. (PTI)

Shanghai: Jeev Milkha Singh knocked in an eagle en route to an eventful four-under 68, that carried him to a midway total of seven-under 137 and a tied eighth spot after the second round of the $1.5 million BMW Asian Open here on Friday. 

The highlight of the day at the Tomson Shanghai Pudong golf course was a brilliant and flawless 10-under from Ernie Els, whose 62 for the day saw him build up a huge four-shot lead over the Korean-born New Zealander, Eddie Lee, at the end of the round. 

Lee had a 66 to add to his first day?s lead-sharing 67. Els had a six-under 30 on the front nine including an eagle on the par-5 ninth and then four birdies on the six closing holes on the back nine for a 32 and a day?s work of 10-under 62. 

Two other Indians ? Rahil Gangjee and Jyoti Randhawa ? squeezed into the weekend?s money rounds as they finished their 36 holes in par and a tied 59th place. 

Gaurav Ghei, despite 18 pars in the second round, missed the cut following his first round 75, as did Amandeep Johl (74, 76) and Harmeet Kahlon (79 and 69). The cut came at par. 

Jeev, starting the day at three-under in the tied eighth spot, began well with two birdies on the second and third, before dropping one each on the fourth and sixth. 

A birdie on the ninth saw him make the turn at one-under. It was on the back nine that Jeev fired up with a birdie on the tenth and then parred five in a row, before he landed an eagle two on the par-four 16th. 

His second shot from the fairway and over the water hazard bounced once on the green before jumping into the cup, much to Jeev?s elation. 

A pumped up Jeev dropped a shot immediately on the par-three 17th, but made up with a birdie on closing 18th to end the day at a satisfying four-under and a total of seven-under 137. 

Gangjee atoned for his first day?s three-over 75 with a three-under 69 on the second day, while Randhawa with the proverbial ?Sword of Damocles? hanging over his head played superbly for an error-free back nine total of 33 including a birdie on the final hole. 

He ended the day at two-over 74 after a horrendous front nine of 41 with five bogeys and no birdies. Both Gangjee and Randhawa were par for the tournament and tied for 59th place as 75 golfers made the cut.

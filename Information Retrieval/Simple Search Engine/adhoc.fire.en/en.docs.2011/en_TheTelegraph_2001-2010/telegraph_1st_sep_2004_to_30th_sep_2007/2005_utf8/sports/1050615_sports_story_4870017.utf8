 Germany have a lot to prove vs Australia

 - Our philosophy clearly stresses on attack: Klinsmann

Frankfurt: Germany will begin a two-week public relations campaign directed at domestic and overseas soccer fans when they take on underdogs Australia in their opening Group A match at the Confederations Cup on Wednesday. 

Germany need to convince local supporters that they have a chance of winning the World Cup they are hosting next year, while showing the outside world that the country will be up to the demands of staging the 32-team tournament. 

For coach Juergen Klinsmann, the match at the new Waldstadion in Frankfurt is a chance to put his faith in the teams aggressive style to the test, after a diet of friendly matches since he took over in late July. 

Our philosophy clearly stresses on attack, with our speed and readiness to run at our opponents, said Klinsmann, who can look forward to further group games against Argentina and Tunisia. 

Well continue to practise all the things weve been working on for the past 10 months and we wont change our plans if we make one or two small mistakes. The players have worked hard and that brings you self-confidence. 

Klinsmann needs a good start in Germanys first competitive action since a deflating first-round exit at Euro 2004. The defence has been criticised after a 2-2 draw with Russia in the sides last friendly. Klinsmann must decide whether to play Patrick Owomoyela at right back or bring in Bernd Schneider to give an inexperienced backline more authority. 

Bastian Schweinsteiger secured his place in midfield with a two-goal performance against Russia and Lukas Podolski should start up front alongside Kevin Kuranyi. 

Australia have played well in the Confederations Cup on two previous occasions, reaching the final in 1997 and finishing third four years later. 

Coach Frank Farina is hoping to have Mark Viduka fit enough after a hamstring injury to lead the forward line, with John Aloisi pushing hard to partner him. 

The Germans are in a similar position to us, said Aloisi from the teams hotel in Frankfurt. 

They havent played proper international games for the last year or two so theyll be looking forward to showing everyone that theyll be ready for the World Cup. Lets just hope theyre not ready against us. 

Major tournaments often throw up surprising results right at the start. Hosts Portugal lost to eventual champions Greece in the opening match at Euro 2004 and reigning champions France went down to Senegal at the start of the last World Cup. 

Germany, who are preparing to host the 2006 World Cup, are well aware of the pitfalls. 

I think we can be completely happy with our preparation, said Joachim Loew, assistant to coach Klinsmann, on the eve of the game at Frankfurts new Waldstadion. 

Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, who celebrates his 36th birthday on Wednesday, said he would be glad to get the tournament underway. 

The tension grows in the build-up but thats normal, he said. This is a very important tournament for us because we want to know where we stand. 

Meanwhile, defender Christian Schulz was forced to pull out of Germanys squad on Tuesday because of a badly bruised leg. He will not be replaced, the German Football Association announced. 

The Werder Bremen player originally suffered the injury in training ahead of Germanys friendly international against Northern Ireland on June 4 and he was definitively ruled out after a series of tests on Tuesday.

 Imran remarks hurt Inzy

 Inzamam 

Melbourne: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has admitted feeling depressed after former captain Imran Khan described his leadership as ?spineless?. 

Pakistan?s second-leading rungetter in Tests, the 34-year-old Inzamam made one and nought in the first Test against Australia, missing the next two matches with a back injury. 

Australia won the third Test by nine wickets in Sydney this week to sweep the series. 

?I?m definitely depressed but hopefully I will perform well in the one-day series,? Inzamam told reporters. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said Imran?s description of his team as ?spineless? was incorrect. 

Imran told a Melbourne radio station on Thursday: ?What I think is disappointing is the spineless manner in which they have played, the lack of fighting qualities, no leadership, no plans. 

?It?s the mis-match that has been greatly disappointing. People expected a bit more of a fight. 

?Perhaps he (Inzamam) should have played the last Test because, with a back injury, I can understand a fast bowler missing out, but a batsman missing out I think is disappointing,? added Pakistan?s 1992 World Cup-winning captain who played 88 Tests. 

?I played as captain so many times with injuries, because if the team is inexperienced, they need you.? 

Pakistan play Australia A in a warm-up match on Wednesday in Adelaide before the triangular one-day series, which starts on Friday when Australia host the West Indies in Melbourne.

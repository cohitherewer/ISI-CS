The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rohan amp; Co. on brink of relegation

 - RANJI TROPHY - Madhya Pradesh post 392; Bengal?s hopes rest on Sourav Ganguly 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sanjay Pandey, who took the first two Bengal wickets, at the Eden on Saturday 

Calcutta: Bengal have a steep mountain to climb now and a lot of their survival in the Ranji Trophy Elite zone depends on Team India captain Sourav Ganguly. 

Having finally managed to dismiss Madhya Pradesh for 392, Bengal were tottering at 70 for four when the Day II stumps were drawn at the Eden on Saturday. 

It?s now more or less clear that unless Sourav, Devang Gandhi or Laxmi Ratan Shukla do something heroic, if not magical, Bengal are going to concede first innings lead. And with no result in the match likely to happen in the next couple of days, that means a relegation for Rohan Gavaskar amp; Co. to the Plate division. 

Bengal?s batting blues surfaced again in the final session of the second day?s action. With as many as four batsmen preferring to spend time in the pavilion instead of grafting in the middle, the hosts are keeping their fingers crossed with Sourav batting on 4. Sourashish Lahiri joined him as nightwatchman. 

Earlier, the home bowlers raised hopes with disciplined bowling in the morning session. But that tempo evaporated as the Madhya Pradesh innings wore on, allowing the visitors to make the hosts? task all the more difficult. 

The overnight centurion Syed Abbas Ali was dismissed by Shib Shankar Paul. In the eighth over of the day, a pitched up delivery from Paul was misjudged by Abbas and gave a straight forward catch to the bowler. 

In the very next over, Nikhil Patwardhan also departed, having been trapped by Ranadeb Bose. Three overs later, Paul struck again when Y. Golwalkar was trapped leg before. But that was all. A 71-run eighth wicket partnership among Brajesh Tomar and Sunil Dholpure negated those early efforts. 

Towards the end of the second session, Bengal went in attacking mode. Tomar edged an away-going harmless delivery from Paul which was neatly taken by Deep Dasgupta behind the stumps. 

The Madhya Pradesh innings finally folded up at 392. 

It was now Rohan amp; Co.s time to deliver and pathetically, they showed no sign of maturity as the wickets were thrown away one after another. 

First to go was Arindam Das. In the third over of the innings, Das, trying to glance a Pandey delivery, was caught by Naman Ojha. 

On the other end, n on-drive off Sunil Dholpure showed Deep?s intentions, but he also fell misjudging another Pandey delivery. 

It was 18 for two and the thin home crowd were expecting some responsibility from Subhomoy Das (No. 3) and captain Rohan Gavaskar. Subhomoy, however, misread a Golwalkar flipper. Rohan was then joined by Sourav and both looked in sublime form. . 

And the curtain also descended on Rohan when he was caught by Sachin Dholpure in the mid-wicket off Y. Golwalkar. 

Rohan seemed to have understood his mistake and he was seen weeping at the corner of the ground after the day?s proceedings. He was being consoled by coach Karsan Ghavri and assistant coach Satinder Singh.

 Chelsea rout Liverpool 4-1

London: Champions Chelsea charged nine points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 4-1 demolition of Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. 

Frank Lampard, Damien Duff, Joe Cole and Geremi gave the rampant London side their eighth win in as many league matches and left European champions Liverpool a staggering 17 points behind them with less than a quarter of the season gone. 

At Highbury, a late deflected shot by substitute Robin van Persie gave Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Birmingham City. 

However, Arsenal still trail Chelsea by 11 points. The leaders have 24, followed by Charlton Athletic and Tottenham Hotspur on 15. Manchester United have 14 points, Arsenal 13 and Liverpool only seven, albeit with two games in hand. 

Elsewhere, Everton remained rooted to the bottom after a 2-0 defeat at Manchester City, struggling Aston Villa lost 3-2 at home to Middlesbrough and Wigan Athletic beat visiting Bolton Wanderers 2-1. (Reuters)

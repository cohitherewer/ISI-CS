 Decision unanimous, says Majid

Karachi: Reacting to Sourav Gangulys outburst over his exclusion from the Asian XV for the series against Africa, Majid Khan Wednesday said the decision to omit the Indian was unanimous. 

The former Pakistan captain and one of the four selectors in the Asian panel, also said Shoaib Akhtar was picked in the side on his star value. 

Souravs omission was a unanimous decision and his recent performance were given due consideration, Majid said from Islamabad. 

Shoaib has been picked because of his star value. The only question mark against his name was fitness and now since he is playing county cricket, he gets a place in the side. He has also been included because the selectors thought the team needed a genuine fast bowler. 

We carefully studied the performance of all the players, including Sourav. The team has been selected purely on merit. I dont think any selection panel would have selected a different team, Majid said. (PTI)

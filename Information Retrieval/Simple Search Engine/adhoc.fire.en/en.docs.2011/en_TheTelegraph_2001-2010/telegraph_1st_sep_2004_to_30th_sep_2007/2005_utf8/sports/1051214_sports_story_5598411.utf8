New Delhi: Yuvraj Singh thinks his unbeaten 77 at the Kotla on Tuesday has proved his worth as a Test batsman. 

Speaking to the media after the fourth days action, the dashing left-hander ducked a query whether he deserved a guaranteed berth in the Test team, but pointed out that his performance in the ongoing Test has boosted his morale as a batsman. It is a very good feeling to perform well in a Test match. Ive scored in the one-dayers but Test cricket is rated higher. So when we score in Tests, it means you are a good player, Yuvraj said. 

Im not at all thinking about my selection (in the XI) for the third Test (starting from Sunday in Ahmedabad)... Its the selectors decision (to pick me up). My job is to score runs whenever opportunities come calling, he added. 

Yuvraj also didnt pay too much significance to the possibility of his century, cut short by Rahul Dravids decision to declare the innings 35 minutes after lunch. According to him, Dravids move was not a surprise to him. 

The captain told me during lunch that I would have seven or eight overs to play. So I wanted to be in a positive frame of mind at that time. Its not important whether I would get the century or not. I did my job I was asked to do and the team is now in a winning position? thats important, Yuvraj, who turned 25 on Monday, observed. 

Yuvraj admitted that Sourav Ganguly and he went into a shell because they wanted to play the first session without being separated. We started slowly, there were also some positive shots in the process. It was important that Sourav and I carry on in the first session. 

Our aim was to be positive against (Muttiah) Muralidharan but we were also aware that hes got the most wickets. In the end, the strategy paid off, he added. 

According to Yuvraj, Maravan Atapattus dismissal (by Anil Kumble) was the turning point of the days proceedings. It was a breakthrough we were all looking for and its good to see it happened today, he signed off.

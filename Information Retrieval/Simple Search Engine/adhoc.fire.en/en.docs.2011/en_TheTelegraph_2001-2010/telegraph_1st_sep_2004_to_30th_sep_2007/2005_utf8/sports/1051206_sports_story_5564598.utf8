 Injury cloud over Jacques Kallis

Sydney: Jacques Kallis withdrew from South Africas opening tour match in Australia on Monday because of an elbow injury. 

Kallis hurt his left elbow during his teams recent tour of India and aggravated the problem batting in the nets at the weekend. 

The ICCs joint Player of the Year was taken to a Perth hospital. Scans revealed an inflamed and torn tendon. 

South African team physio Shane Jabaar said Kallis was ordered to skip the three-day game against Western Australia and Fridays one-day match at Lilac Hill but should be available next week. 

Kallis will continue to receive the appropriate treatment to address the severity of the injury with a view to get him ready to play in the second three-day match against Western Australia, Jabaar said. 

The South Africans struggled on the field on Monday as Western Australia piled on 306 for five after being sent in. 

Adam Voges smashed 101, Marcus North made 71 and David Bandy posted his highest first-class score, an unbeaten 59. 

Charl Langeveldt captured two wickets for South Africa while Shaun Pollock, Andre Nel and Nicky Boje collected one each. 

The tourists began well, reducing the home team to 67 for three at lunch after claiming the prize wicket of Australian test opener Justin Langer for 21. 

Voges and North added 146 for the fourth wicket before Langeveldt dismissed North, caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Voges batted for just over three hours, hitting 17 boundaries off 168 balls before he was caught in the deep off Boje.

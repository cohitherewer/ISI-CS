 Brazil threat to turn down Robinho transfer

Rio de Janeiro: Robinhos move from Santos to Real Madrid was in danger of falling through on Friday when the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said they would not authorise the transfer under current conditions. 

The nine-time European champions said on Thursday that they had paid 60 percent, or $30 million, of the $50 million buy-out clause stipulated in Robinhos contract to buy Santoss share of his rights. 

Robinho, who says he is no longer in the right frame of mind to stay in Brazil, has waived the remaining 40 percent to which he is entitled. 

But the CBFs legal director Carlos Eugenio Lopes said that a unilateral breach of contract would require Real Madrid to pay Santos the full $50 million for the 21-year-old Brazil international, one of the worlds most exciting young players. Lopes said Robinho would not be granted the International Transfer Certificate he needs to complete the move. 

Were going to deny the certificate because the transfer does not meet the requirements of the law, Lopes said. We cant release him either under Brazilian law or under Fifa rules, he added. (Brazilian law) requires the payment of the entire amount for there to be a unilateral end to the contract and that is not what Real are proposing. 

Lopes said Santos had told the CBF that they did not agree with the transfer. 

Santos will only release him for $50 million. Robinho would only have the right to his 40 percent in a deal which is done by mutual agreement between both parties. Hes not entitled to anything if he breaks off the contract.

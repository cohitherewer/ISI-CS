 83 overs a day in Test matches

Karachi: England cricketers will have a reduction in their working hours for the international series later this year in Pakistan. 

Under International Cricket Council (ICC) rules, minimum 90 overs a day should be bowled during Tests. 

But a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Tuesday that this wont be possible during the tour, which will be held during winter from October 26. Instead the teams must only bowl 83 overs. 

November and December in Pakistan are winter months with bad light and fog normally reducing playing hours and dew problems affecting one-dayers in the evening. 

The one-dayers, which are being played under lights, will start early so that we have an early finish, director of PCB cricket operations, Saleem Altaf said. 

England play three Tests in Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore in November and four of the five one-dayers divided between Rawalpindi and Lahore in December. 

The tourists have also agreed to play a one-dayer in Karachi but rejected a proposal to play a Test there for security reasons. 

It was initially proposed by the PCB to play back-to-back one-dayers but the ECB turned it down and agreed to play a one-dayer. 

India had also played a one-dayer in Karachi in early 2004 after refusing to play Tests beacuse of security fears.

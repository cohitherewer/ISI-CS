The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hewitt wants favourable surface 

Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt has criticised organisers of the Australian Open for refusing to change the playing surface to boost his chances of winning the tournament. 

The world number three believes the hardcourts are too slow for his game and demanded they are sped up to suit him. 

Hewitt said he deserved special treatment because of his past achievements and could not understand why organisers disagreed. 

?I thought I may have had a bit of pull (influence) after being number one in the world for two years and winning a couple of Grand Slams, but obviously not that much,? he told a news conference at the Australian men?s hardcourt titles in Adelaide on Monday. 

?I?m baffled by the whole thing. I really am and I?ve had a gut full of it to tell you the truth.? 

Hewitt won the US Open in 2001 and Wimbledon a year later, but has not won a Grand Slam since and has never made it past the fourth round of the Australian Open in as many as eight attempts. 

The former world number one has never been far from controversy. 

In 2002 he angered Australian tennis fans by describing them as ?stupid? for cheering an opponent and a year later he called an umpire at the French Open a ?spastic? when a line call went against him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 There is no drama in selection anymore

 - Wisdom of retaining same squad evident in Englands results 

Richard Hobson

 Michael Vaughan is entitled to assemble the best talent with his influence 

Something is missing from this Ashes series. It may be generating some of the greatest games in 128 years of rivalry, but another source of drama has disappeared. No longer does the announcement of an England squad have us rushing to check the record of the latest questionable addition to the ranks. 

David Graveney, the chairman of selectors, named an unchanged XII for the third time in succession on Sunday, and the team for the fourth Test at Trent Bridge will be the same as at Lords, Edgbaston and Old Trafford ? unless somebody pulls up sick, lame or injured between now and Thursday morning. 

Not since Arthur Shrewsburys tour to Australia in 1884-85 have England been able to go through an entire Ashes campaign without an alteration, and the wisdom of the policy is evident in the results. 

Compare this with the panic of the recent series. In 2001, England used 19 players, with 18 in 1997, 24 in 1993 and, infamously, 29 in 1989. 

Fitness is clearly a significant factor behind this consistency. By refusing to allow any of the team that drew the most draining of games seven days ago to play during the intervening period, Duncan Fletcher, the coach, knew that he could guarantee their return fresh of mind and body when they reconvene before practice on Tuesday. 

Englands fighting response to defeat in the first Test has strengthened the hand of Fletcher in keeping centrally-contracted players away from county fixtures. There was little disagreement of his decision to withhold them from Cheltenham amp; Gloucester Trophy semi-finals at the weekend, only concern at the way it was relayed. 

For all his strengths, Fletcher is a poor communicator outside his own team. Yorkshire were unhappy to discover through a general e-mail that Matthew Hoggard supposedly had a niggle and Jack Simmons, the Lancashire chairman, wanted a second, local, opinion on Andrew Flintoff after being told that the allrounder also had a minor ailment. Unfortunately for Simmons, Flintoff was by then in France. 

Fletcher will not hesitate to block Ian Bell, Ashley Giles and Kevin Pietersen from the C amp;G final on September 3, if he believes it is in the interests of the national side. Warwickshire and Hampshire can hardly dissent in any case, with a strong prevailing mood of support for the team. 

There has to be mutual trust between England and the Shires, but an element of goodwill is sure to be lost when contracted players take part in a Twenty20 benefit game at Headingley on Wednesday next week, two days after the Trent Bridge Test is due to finish. The beneficiary is Michael Vaughan, the England captain. 

Advertisements say that Flintoff, Marcus Trescothick, Stephen Harmison and Pietersen are among those to feature for an England XI, while Yorkshire, the opposition, are due to include Hoggard. Rest assured that both sets of players will be taking this game very seriously, the spiel adds. Quite right, at ?10 a head. 

Vaughan, who is committed to donating some of his funds to charity, is entitled to assemble the best talent within his influence. But if players are told to rest from county commitments, then Fletcher and Vaughan will both stand accused of double standards if the same players feature elsewhere to line the pockets of their captain. 

A spokesman for the ECB said: If Duncan Fletcher feels players need to be rested, he can still choose to do so. No decision on available players will be made until after the Test match. In our view there is a qualitative difference between a 20-over benefit game and a first-class or a domestic knockout fixture. We do not have a problem. 

Criticism should not be of the game itself, but its timing between the fourth and fifth Tests. Clearly a benefit match, whatever the publicity material will claim, is less intense than a county game. 

But it is still being played with a hard ball, and accidents happen in the strangest of circumstances. Just ask Glenn McGrath.

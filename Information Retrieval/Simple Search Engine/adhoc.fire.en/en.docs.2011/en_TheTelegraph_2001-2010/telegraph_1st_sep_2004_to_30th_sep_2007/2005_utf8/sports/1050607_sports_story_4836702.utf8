The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indias poor form continues

 - AZLAN SHAH CUP - Teams performance no surprise to IHF 

 Prabhjot Singhs (seen trying to wrestle the ball from Malaysias Muhammad Amin Rahim in Kuala Lumpur recently) return to the national team was an insipid affair 

Kuala Lumpur: Yet another tournament and yet again a spineless performance. 

The Indian hockey team must consider themselves lucky not to finish at the bottom of the table, like in the previous edition, despite coming up with a mediocre performance in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup here. 

The Indians finished fifth in the seven-nation meet ahead of Malaysia and South Africa, managing just two wins and a draw besides four losses, thus putting a question mark on the future of new coach Rajinder Singh (jr). 

They lost four matches on the trot after forcing a last minute win against South Africa and a hard-fought draw against New Zealand in their first two encounters. 

The team struggled in the classification match against Malaysia before an extra-time winner by Prabhjot Singh gave the side the fifth place ahead of the hosts, who played much better than the eight-time Olympic champions in the event but were unlucky to finish below them. 

But the teams lacklustre performance in the prestigious tournament has not come as a surprise to the Indian Hockey Federation. 

The team was without several players who are attending the camp for the junior World Cup in Hyderabad. We had sent some very young players and a few new faces as well. So we were certainly not expecting miracles from them in this tough competition, an IHF official said Monday. 

Though India tried several new players, the return of strikers Prabhjot and Deepak Thakur, after a long break since the Olympics, had given rise to hopes that the team may come up with an inspiring show in the tournament. 

But they disappointed the supporters back home by playing some ordinary hockey for most part of the tournament suffering huge losses against hosts Malaysia and South Korea. 

They also went down to arch-rivals Pakistan and Olympic champions Australia, who won the title beating the Asian Games gold medallists in a thrilling final.

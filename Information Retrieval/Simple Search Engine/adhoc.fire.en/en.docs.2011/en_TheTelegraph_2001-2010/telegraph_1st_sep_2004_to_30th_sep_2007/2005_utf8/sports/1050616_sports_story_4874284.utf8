 Trescothick on 100th one-dayer

London: England will not be overawed by Australias reputation when the teams meet in the triangular one-day series, according to opening batsman Marcus Trescothick. 

The left-hander will be appearing in his 100th one-dayer when the hosts take on Bangladesh at The Oval in Thursdays tournament-opener. 

He said England had gained in confidence after rising up the world rankings and warmed up for the event by crushing the world champions in their inaugural Twenty20 meeting Monday. 

Everybody has been a little bit in awe of their team (Australia). We have gained confidence to stand up, be proud of what we have done and compete against the best team in the world, Trescothick told a news conference at the ground. 

Trescothick, however, said it was Englands fine Test form which had helped the team believe in themselves. 

The most important thing is not the fact that we have beaten them in two one-day games but how we have done over the last 18 months, he said. 

We have built a unity and team spirit as well as putting in extra work and extra disciplines in our team that will stand us in more stead rather than two one-day games. 

Trescothick will become the tenth Englishman to play 100 one-day Internationals. Of the current England team, only Darren Gough, with 147, has played more. The record of 170 was set by Alec Stewart. 

I never thought it would happen so quickly, he said. I dont want to miss any games at all. 

Trescothick, whose scoring rate of 85.59 is only bettered by Andrew Flintoff within the England team, averages 36.51 in one-dayers, but surprisingly has only managed 25.50 in four games against Bangladesh.

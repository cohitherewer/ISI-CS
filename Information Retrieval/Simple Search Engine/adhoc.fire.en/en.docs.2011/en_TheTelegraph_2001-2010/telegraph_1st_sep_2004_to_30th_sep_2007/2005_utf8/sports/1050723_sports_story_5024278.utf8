 Sania in quarters

New Delhi: Sania Mirza pulled off a thrilling 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 victory over Puerto Ricos Kristina Brandi to advance to the quarter finals of the $170,000 WTA Cincinnati Open. 

According to information received here, after clinching a tough first set, Sania bounced back from a 3-5 deficit and took the second by winning the last four games against the 28-year old Brandi, ranked 67th in the world, at the Tier 3 event Thursday. 

Sanias quarter final opponent will be Japans Akiko Morigami whom she had defeated in the first round of Wimbledon barely a month ago. 

The 25-year old Morigami, whose ranking had slipped to 72nd after the Wimbledon loss, would be looking to settle the scores after registering a 6-3, 6-2 upset win over second seed Vera Zvonareva. 

Sania, ranked 70th, was one point away from losing the second set but unleashed a flurry of strokes to scorch her way to success. 

I didnt even know she had set point, the 18-year-old Hyderabadi said. 

The Puerto Rican kept Sania on a leash with a frills-free game that stifled the Indians strokeplay. 

It played on Sanias nerves as she committed 26 unforced errors as against her rivals 15, but her aggressive style of play carried her through. That she had 42 winners compared to Brandis 15 told the story of the day. 

Kristina is a different player to play against. She gets a lot of balls in the court and likes to keep the ball low. She was breaking my rhythm a lot today. 

I just started getting more balls in the court and was trying to get to a lower margin of errors with my shots. 

I was committing a lot more unforced errors in the second set than I did in the first set. 

Like at the Australian Open and the Dubai Open, the teenager had a huge battalion of fans rooting for her. 

I always play better when Im down ... Im an aggressive player, she said after posing for pictures with the group waving the Tricolour. 

Thats how Ive always played. I like going for it. If I stop doing that, Im a different player.

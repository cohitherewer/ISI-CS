 Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian Open champion Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand capped a dream run in Malaysia by sweeping four main awards of the Asian Tour 2004, including the prestigious players? Player of the Year and Order of Merit titles.

 Jaidee, who earlier won the Myanmar Open before successfully defending his Malaysian Open title on Sunday, lifted the merit title with record earnings of $ 381,930 from nine starts.

 Jaidee also bagged the player of the year, stroke average and greens in regulation classifications. Hitting 73.61 per cent of greens in regulation helped him to an impressive stroke average of 69.58.

 The 35-year-old Jaidee said he badly wants to break into the world top-50 ranking which would earn him a ticket to play in the US Masters in April. 

 Allahabad: Indian men won the team contests while the women?s team emerged runner-up on the inaugural day of the second south central gymnastics championships here on Monday.

 Indian men finished with 203.80 points followed by Sri Lanka (187.30) and Bangladesh (142.35). The fancied Uzbekistan team, however, finished fourth mainly due to injury to some of its gymnasts.

 The Uzbek women?s team, however, emerged winners with 124.70, followed by India (120.85) and Sri Lanka (100.05). 

 New York: It was curtains up on Monday as organisers of New York?s bid to host the 2012 Olympics put their campaign?s best face forward for the first day of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Evaluation Commission?s four-day visit. The 13-member commission will report on the five finalist cities ?including London, Madrid, Moscow and early favourite Paris ? before the IOC makes its decision in July.

 Lavish entertainment and use of celebrity star power were taking a back seat given IOC guidelines installed after the scandal linked to the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City.

 ?This is a substantive visit, not a wining and dining exercise,? said Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff, founder of the NYC2012 bid organisation.

 Madrid: Albacete coach Jose Gonzalez was sacked on Sunday after his side slumped to a 1-2 home defeat against basement club Numancia that saw them drop into the relegation zone.

 The Primera Liga club said reserve team coach Martin Monteagudo will now take charge.

 Gonzalez, whose only previous coaching post was at second division Cadiz, was appointed at the start of the season to replace Cesar Ferrando, who left the club to join Atletico Madrid.

 Albacete, who were promoted to the top flight at the start of last season, are in 18th place in the 20-team Primera Liga.

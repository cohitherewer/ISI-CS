The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ZCU hasn?t slammed door on Streak amp; Co.

 - Our sights are on 2007 World Cup, says Justice Ebrahim 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 The likes of Streak can be back if they fall into the system 

Calcutta: Despite the bad blood between the rebels and the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU), it?s not the end of the road for the Heath Streaks. 

?At no time has the ZCU slammed the door. It?s not the end of the road for anybody? However, be it Streak or somebody else, he has to fall into the system. In fact, two-three have already come back (into the fold),? ZCU vice-chairman Justice (retd) Ahmed Ebrahim told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Mumbai, shortly before returning to Harare after spending over three weeks in India and Bangladesh, he added: ?Contrary to the general impression, our team for Bangladesh did have Whites... 

?That the ZCU hasn?t been promoting players of only one race has been confirmed by the high-powered commission set up by the International Cricket Council last year? I don?t think we need to say more.? 

The commission, it may be recalled, comprised India?s solicitor-general Goolam Vahanvati and senior South African judge Steven Majiet. 

Justice Ebrahim, a former Match Referee, felt that ?exoneration? by the commission should be accepted and respected by those attacking the ZCU. 

He said: ?The ZCU, of course, has always believed nobody is bigger than the game? That?s not going to change.? 

Justice Ebrahim, though, agreed that Andy Flower and Henry Olonga?s black arm-band protest during the 2003 World Cup ?hurt? Zimbabwe cricket. 

?However, why must people still talk of that? Surely, there?s much more to cricket in Zimbabwe than one protest? I accept Andy?s departure from the country also hurt us, but there?s nothing that can be done,? he observed. 

Justice Ebrahim defended Zimbabwe?s performance in Bangladesh, despite the Tatenda Taibu-led team losing both the Test and ODI series. 

?Look, when the first of two Tests began, Bangladesh?s playing XI had a collective experience of 180? Zimbabwe?s, on the other hand, stood at just 49. Therefore, the performance should be looked in perspective. 

?Indeed, today, our sights are on the 2007 World Cup and, believe me, Zimbabwe won?t be completing the numbers in that competition? We expect this lot to do very well,? he insisted. 

Justice Ebrahim, whose roots are in Gujarat, specifically came to speak at the annual Pravasi Bharatiya Divas ? incidentally, he was among those honoured last year ? and attend seminars. 

In between was a trip to Bangladesh. 

Justice Ebrahim, who retired as a Supreme Court judge some two-and-a-half years ago, was accompanied by wife Zulekha who used the ?holiday? to undergo a cataract operation (in Mumbai).

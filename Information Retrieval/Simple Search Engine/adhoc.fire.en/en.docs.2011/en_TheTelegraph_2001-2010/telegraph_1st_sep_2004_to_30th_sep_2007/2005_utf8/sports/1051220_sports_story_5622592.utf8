 Sri Lankans dance to Harbhajans tune

 - Laxman hits 104, Pathan 82; Last 5 wickets add 301 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Ahmedabad: If you were wondering whether Indian cricket would be in safe hands in near future, then rest assured. 

Virender Sehwag showed encouraging glimpses of leadership abilities during his 172-minute stay on the field on Monday. 

He had proved himself in the two one-dayers not so long ago, but the real test would always be in Test matches. In nearby Motera on the second day, his zeal and enthusiasm with attacking but not stereotypical field placements, and ushering in the right bowling changes, paid dividends. 

The moves clicked as Harbhajan Singh brought life into the match during a 30-ball span in which he picked up four wickets giving away only nine runs. It was mainly owing to his efforts that Sri Lanka were reduced to 131 for five at stumps, still 267 runs in arrears. 

It remains to be seen if the islanders can force this Test into the fifth day. It hadnt looked so rosy for India when Maravan Atapattu and Kumar Sangakkara added 60 for the second wicket. 

Anil Kumble was struggling to make an impression and Irfan Pathan was showing signs of tiring. It was then that Sehwag introduced Harbhajan and wickets tumbled. 

Atapattu was to be blamed for that atrocious shot, but Mahela Jayawardene, dismissed next ball, had little resistance to offer. The ball jumped off the rough and took his gloves. Thilan Samaraweera prevented the hattrick but left 16 balls later in almost similar circumstances. 

The wicket is affording turn at one end and some balls are also tending to keep low. It will need loads of patience to survive in these conditions and the visitors have not proved to be worthy in the Videocon series. 

If Harbhajan turned things around in his 50th Test, it was the record 125-run seventh wicket stand between V.V.S. Laxman and Pathan that helped India soar to 398, with 301 being put on for the last five wickets. 

The more Pathan refuses to be branded an allrounder, the more the runs flow from his bat. After missing his maiden hundred by just seven runs at the Kotla, he seemed destined for it this time. Until he missed the line to a straight delivery from Mahroof, he batted like an established batsman. 

There was no hurry or hesitation in Pathans approach and he found ample time for his shots. Another delayed start and the early life on the wicket may have prompted a cautious approach at the beginning, but once he gauged the pace and bounce of the wicket, he was in his elements. Lasith Malinga was pulled with authority and there was no mistake in reading Murali. In fact, he handled everything the Lankans threw at him with ?lan. 

The presence of Laxman, at the other end, gave him the assurance and confidence. But it can in no way undermine his efforts. That he is comfortable batting at any position also provides that extra edge. His 82 included 12 boundaries. 

There can, however, be no doubts as to who built the innings. Laxmans 104 wasnt flamboyant but the silken touch in his strokemaking was not to be missed. There were those wristy flicks that reminded one of the Hyderabad gharana, not to mention of the cool and unflinching approach that his presence generates. 

Despite that epic knock at the Eden Gardens, there has never been a fair judgement made of his abilities. Every Test is still a battle of survival for him and he has no regrets. Coming in at No.3 obviously meant he had the time to settle and shape the innings and he utilised it to the hilt. 

His ninth hundred consumed 401 minutes and included 14 boundaries. This tough, sternly disciplined cricketer batted impeccably and there was no false stroke during his 237-ball stay. 

Dravid discharge 

Meanwhile, Rahul Dravid will be discharged from hospital on Tuesday evening. 

Former Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya, among others, visited Dravid in the evening.

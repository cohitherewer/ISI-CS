 India lose to Pakistan, finish last

Chennai: India squandered a two-goal advantage to go down 4-3 to arch-rivals Pakistan for a humiliating last-place finish on their home ground in the 27th Sahara Champions Trophy Hockey Tournament on Sunday. 

The defeat in the play-off for 5-6 places meant India forfeited their place in the next edition of the elite six-nation tournament. Argentina will replace India in the next edition, to be held in Spain, by virtue of their win in Champions Challenge earlier this year. 

India, who had defeated the arch-rivals in the preliminary league, raised visions of a repeat performance as they rushed to a 2-0 lead within the first 15 minutes of the match but slackened later, thereby failing to break the jinx of losing to Pakistan in the play-off matches since 2002. 

Last years bronze medallists Pakistan, who were slow off the blocks, came back strongly and exploited the complacency in the Indian ranks by scoring three goals, including a penalty stroke, in the space of 15 minutes to register their second win in the tournament. 

Kanwalpreet Singh drew first blood for India in the second minute, converting a penalty corner while Prabhjot Singh increased the lead to 2-0 in the 14th minute. 

But Mohammed Imran (33rd), Akthar Ali (38) and Mohammed Saqlain (48th penalty stroke) helped their team bounce back. Rehan Butt increased the margin in the 62nd minute.

 Zimbabwe succumb to new low of 54

 - Kallis hits fastest-ever half-century 

 Ntini has become the third SA bowler to bag 200 wickets 

Cape Town: South African allrounder Jacques Kallis smashed the fastest 50 in Test cricket on Friday after his team skittled out Zimbabwe for their lowest Test score on the opening day of the first Test. 

On a day when records tumbled, Kallis completed a successful day for the hosts by following up his haul of four for 13 by bringing up his half century in just 24 deliveries. 

Kallis hit five sixes and three boundaries before being out for 54, helping the South Africans reach 340 for three after Zimbabwe had collapsed to 54 all out in their first innings. The allrounder hit a six off Graeme Cremer to reach the landmark and eclipse the record of England allrounder Ian Botham, who had taken 26 balls to score 50 against India in the 1981-82 season. 

The Zimbabwean?s paltry total beat their previous worst showing of 63, which was against the West Indies in 1999-2000 season. 

Zimbabwe won the toss and chose to bat but were dismissed in 31.2 overs with only opening bat Stuart Matsikenyeri reaching double figures when he scored 12. 

Makhaya Ntini and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher also joined in the act by reaching milestones. 

Ntini became only the third South African to capture 200 Test wickets, after Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock, when he dismissed Dion Ebrahim for three. 

Boucher claimed his 300th Test dismissal when he caught Brendan Taylor off the bowling of Ntini for two. He followed Australia?s Rodney Marsh and Ian Healy into the record books. 

With Zimbabwe left shell-shocked after their dismal batting display, South Africa added to their misery by scoring runs with ease. South African openers Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers guided the hosts past Zimbabwe?s total in 11.2 overs. 

At the close, South Africa broke a 109-year-old record when they moved into a 286-run lead after the first day. The lead broke the previous mark of 233 set by England against Australia in 1896.

 Parreira promises positive approach

 - WORLD CUP QUALIFIER vs ARGENTINA

Buenos Aires: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has promised to attack Argentina when they face their old rivals in Wednesdays South American World Cup qualifier. 

Speaking to the media on Monday, Parreira said the world champions would adopt the same formation which thumped Paraguay 4-1 at home a day earlier, but he had made two changes of personnel in defence. 

Cafu replaces Belletti at right-back after missing the Paraguay match through suspension and Juan steps in for central defender Lucio, who was sent off on Sunday. 

In an attack-minded midfield, Emerson and Ze Roberto will play in front of the back four, with Kaka and Ronaldinho providing the link between them and the front line of Robinho and Adriano. 

How can you stop a team like this going forward? Parreira asked. 

The formation worked superbly on Sunday, when Brazil ? who left out striker Ronaldo after he said he was tired ? produced one of their best performances since winning their fifth world title in Japan and South Korea three years ago. 

From now own, this will be Brazils characteristic, said Parreira, who until recently had been criticised for being over-cautious with his tactics. 

Obviously, we will take precautions, but the tendency is we will attack all the time. We are not going to play in a conservative manner, it would be suicide to come here and defend all the time. 

Argentina lead the 10-nation South American group with 28 points from 14 games, one ahead of Brazil. 

Both teams are virtually assured of a place in Germany and the winners of Wednesdays match at the River Plate Stadium will be mathematically guaranteed a berth.

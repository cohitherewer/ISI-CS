 Its tough for fans as Agassi meets Blake

CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 Blake is an extremely likeable guy, feels Agassi 

New York: The fist-pumping spectre of Jimmy Connors returned to the National Tennis Center as Andre Agassi and James Blake followed the trail into the final eight that Connors blazed on the hard courts here with more sound, fury and difficulty in 1991. 

Agassi went first on Monday, beating Xavier Malisse of Belgium 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 4-6, 6-2. 

Blake went next, beating his edgy opponent, 19th-seeded Tommy Robredo of Spain 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. Now, the 35-year-old Agassi and the 25-year-old Blake will face each other in a cross-generational, all-American quarterfinal that few would have predicted when this Grand Slam tournament began. 

Even fewer would have predicted it a year ago, when Blake was watching this tournament on television and unable to blink an eye because the left side of his face was paralysed by a viral infection brought on by the stress caused by the death of his father. 

But those who have watched the seventh-seeded Agassi and the unseeded Blake taking the ball bright and early and converting from the start of this tournament cannot be scratching their heads anymore. 

And it should make for a particularly intriguing match-up, in part because Blake has quickly become a crowd favourite here and Agassi is a crowd favourite wherever he plays at this late phase of his career. 

Listen, James is an easy guy to like, and hes an easy guy to root for, Agassi said while Blakes match with Robredo was still being played. If hes getting the better of me, if we happen to play, you know I couldnt wish it for a better person. He deserves support. 

I know Im not in a Hollywood script, otherwise I probably would have won a lot more this year, said Blake, when asked if his first Grand Slam quarter final was some sort of payback from fate after his year of travails. 

Hes (Agassi) helped me with scouting reports, helped me when I go out to Vegas, Blake said. Hes just a great guy that will help out young guys. Hes someone that you can tell your kids to look up to and be proud of it.

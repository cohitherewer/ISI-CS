 England eves clinch Ashes

London: Englands women clinched their first Ashes series in 42 years with a six-wicket triumph in the second and final Test in Worcester on Friday. 

England seam bowler Katherine Brunt took four for 64 to help dismiss Australia for 232 in the second innings after the visitors resumed on their overnight score of 179 for seven. 

The hosts then survived a few scares before reaching their victory target of 75 for the loss of four wickets on the fourth and final day. England were reduced to three for two at lunch and slipped to 39 for four early in the afternoon session. 

However, Arran Brindle and Lydia Greenway steered England to their first victory over Australia since December 1984. (Reuters)

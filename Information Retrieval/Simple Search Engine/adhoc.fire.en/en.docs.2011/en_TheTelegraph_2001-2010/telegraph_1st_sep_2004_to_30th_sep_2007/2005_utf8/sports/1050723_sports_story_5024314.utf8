 Narain: The car is running well, so Im hopeful

 - GERMAN GRAND PRIX 

 Karthikeyan finished 19th in second practice 

Hockenheim: Leaving behind his technical snags, Narain Karthikeyan scorched the 4.5740 km Hockenheim ring touching speeds upto 323 kmph to finish 19th in the second practice on Friday. 

The Indian rookie driver, racing for Jordan, stopped the clock at 1 minute, 17.506 seconds and left behind teammates Tiago Monteiro of Portugal and Nicolas Keisa, who brought up the rear finishing 22nd and 23rd, respectively. 

His placing, based on the top speeds attained, was far more impressive at 11th place after touching 323.6 kmph. The Indian left behind the likes of Michael Schumacher, who was 15th on the list after touching 321.3 kmph. 

Earlier in the first practice, Karthikeyan posted a time of 1:18.988 seconds to finish 18th. 

In the second practice, McLaren cars took the top two spots with Alexander Wurz posting the best time of 1:13.973 seconds and Kimi Raikkonen finishing with 1:14.576 seconds. 

Karthikeyan said the practice sessions were good learning experiences from technical aspect. 

Today we had two good learning practice sessions here at Hockenheim with our focus being on the technical track and the new information to be collected to prepare the best set-up for the car, he said. 

The Bridgestone tyre evaluation was also at the centre of our work. I lost the car for a fraction of second, at turn 8, but nothing serious. We need the best set-up work for qualifying on Saturday, Karthikeyan said. 

For the time being, the car is running well, so I am hopeful of a good qualifying result in Germany, he added. 

 FIAs U-turn 

Meanwhile, F1s governing body has formally overturned guilty verdicts made against the seven Michelin teams after the US Grand Prix tyre fiasco. 

The FIA said in a statement on Friday that its world motor sport council had voted overwhelmingly to wipe the slate clean after examining new evidence. 

The move was a formality after the FIA senate recommended last week to annul the verdicts. 

The June 19 race at Indianapolis turned into a fiasco after just six cars started. The Michelin teams ? championship leaders Renault, McLaren, Williams, Toyota, BAR, Sauber and Red Bull ? withdrew because of tyre safety concerns.

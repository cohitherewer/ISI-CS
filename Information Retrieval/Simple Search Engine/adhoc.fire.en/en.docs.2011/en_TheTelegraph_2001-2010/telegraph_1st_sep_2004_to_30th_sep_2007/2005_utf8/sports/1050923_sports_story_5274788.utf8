 Ponting sure of bouncing back

Sydney: Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he is confident that his side can bounce back against the World XI next month, dismissing the loss of the Ashes as a hiccup. 

The Australians simply need to recover their winning habits, he told a television channel on Thursday. 

Ponting, who faced strong criticism of his captaincy over the loss of the Ashes to England for the first time in 16 years, said the defeat would make him tougher. 

It will toughen me up as captain, if that needed to happen, he said. I am not sure it did. Things had been going along well for a long period of time and this has been a hiccup and something we have got to get over pretty quickly. 

Ponting said the Australians needed to bounce back for the Super Series next month. 

We got away from those habits and those little things along the way that help to win Test matches. 

Its important to get those back again and I am sure if we do you will see us win lots of Test matches. 

Ponting said he and his team would be taking a hard look at themselves ahead of the Super Series. 

One of the main reasons why we have been regarded as the number one in the world is that we are all harsh judges of our own games and how we are going, he said. 

A lot of players would have returned from England, had a good hard look at themselves and theyll try to find a way of making themselves better players next time around. (AFP)

 Hussain praise for Fletcher

London: Former England captain Nasser Hussain has put the recent Ashes win down to the forensic skills of the England coach Duncan Fletcher, who plotted the downfall of arch-rivals Australia. 

Chennai-born Hussain, who worked closely with Fletcher during his four years as captain, identified the key factors behind Englands success and the areas in which they can still improve. 

He wrote in a magazine: England teams have had plans for opposing batsmen in the past, it was just that we could never execute them. We could carry out the plans for three balls out of six; in this series England could bowl to a plan five balls out of six.

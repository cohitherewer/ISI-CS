 India go down to China

New Delhi: The Indian under-20 football team went down 1-3 to the Chinese U-23 side, their second successive defeat in the Grand Royal Challenge Cup taking place in Yangon. 

The Indians, who conceded 11 goals against the hosts in their opener, did well to avoid another whipping but were clearly second best, according to information received here. With this defeat, India are virtually out of the reckoning for a place in the final of the four-team meet. (PTI)

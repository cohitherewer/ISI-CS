 Dhoni: Ive got to perform and anything I do will be noticed

 - keeper keyed up for the biggest match of his career 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Colombo: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has established himself in crickets shorter version, but his sights are set on the biggest league. The 24-year-old may not have been brilliant, but has certainly been effective since his debut in Chittagong last December. Dhoni, who should captain Jharkhand once the 2005-06 season gets underway at home, spoke to The Telegraph in his Taj Samudra room on Monday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

 On his thoughts before his 

 first tournament final 

Tuesdays match is going to be the biggest of my career... Ive got to perform and anything I do will be noticed and talked about... Its a one-off match and both teams start with a clean slate. 

 On whether the pressure is 

 much more 

Jyada to definitely hai... That Sri Lanka have an excellent record at home adds to the pressure... Yet, because of the one-off nature, the team making fewer mistakes has the best chance. 

 On his unbeaten 28 in Sundays 

 virtual semi-final, against the West Indies, having made 

 the difference 

Taking guard at the end of the 45th over, I didnt have much time... I took a few balls to settle and, then, went for the shots... At that stage, youve got to improvise and I did that reasonably well... Meri strategy kaam kar gayi... Did I plan a six off the last ball? I aimed for the maximum as Narsingh Deonarine isnt a regular bowler... 

 On his performance in the first 

 four matches of the tri-series 

It has been so-so... Being asked to open in the first match (versus Sri Lanka) gave me the chance to bat for the maximum overs. However, I got out quickly... I ought to have made the most of that opportunity... Where my keeping is concerned, Ive been improving. 

 On whether he has spoken to 

 the most successful Test keeper, Ian Healy, who has 

 been doing commentary 

No... I was hoping we would be in the same hotel... Both in Dambulla and here, though, the commentators have been at different places. 

[Dhoni, incidentally, idolises Adam Gilchrist.] 

 On what he has learnt most 

 since his debut 

The importance of the middle overs... While batting, one must score the most in that period; while bowling, concede the least. A team either gains or loses momentum in the middle overs. 

 On batting in different positions 

(Laughs) Its not easy, but the team comes first... My job is to put my best foot forward. 

 On the blistering 148 in Vizag 

 (against Pakistan) 

At the international level, confidence is everything and that innings lifted mine ten times... I dont know whether I would have continued with Team India had I not got those runs... That innings ensured opportunities. 

 On whether hes satisfied 

 with his keeping 

Not entirely... Of course, main improve kar raha hoon... I need to keep a lot more to Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh... In domestic cricket, one doesnt get opportunities to keep to spinners of their class... The true test for a keeper is when he stands up. 

 On whether hes thrilled 

 about a particular dismissal 

I havent done anything spectacular. 

 On whether hes now more 

 confident about getting a Test call-up 

Absolutely... That the season has begun with a one-day tournament and the tour of Zimbabwe also starts with a one-day competition is to my advantage. Its up to me to make the most of this calender... In time to come, I can either pat myself or blame myself. 

 On whether life has changed 

Thoda bahut... Its not that Ive changed as a person, but I come from a place (Ranchi) which isnt big and one easily gets noticed... Adulation is fine, but there are times when you dont want to be held up because of a crowd... I continue to live in the Mecon Colony with my parents. 

 On the off season 

I played in the P. Sen Trophy (in Calcutta) and, while at home, followed Greg Kings training schedule... My fitness has improved since Ive been playing for India. 

 On whether he has recently 

 bought something he yearned for 

(Laughs again) A Yamaha 600cc machine... Im obsessed with bikes... I cant drive in Ranchi proper and, so, Ive occasionally done 100 mph on the national highway... 

 Finally, on being credited 

 with downing four litres of milk daily 

I dont know how that rumour spread... Even my parents have been mystified... I have about a litre each day... Thats the maximum.

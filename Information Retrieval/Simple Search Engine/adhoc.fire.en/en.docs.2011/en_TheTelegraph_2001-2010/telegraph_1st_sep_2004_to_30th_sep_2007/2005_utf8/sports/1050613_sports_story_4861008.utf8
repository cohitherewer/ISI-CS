 Not winning Test series hurts Inzy

 - Pak captain says team missed Shoaib, Sami in West Indies 

Lahore: Pakistans failure to win their Test series against the West Indies is a black spot for the countrys fast-maturing side, captain Inzamam-ul Haq said Sunday, while voicing hopes for a good result against England and India this year. 

We have players who have been there for two years now and although the team is maturing, not winning a Test series is worrying for me, Inzamam said. 

The coming season is very important and I hope that we produce some good results, win a Test series and show the signs of a top team, he said. 

The team returned late on Friday from Jamaica where Inzamams century lifted his side to a 136-run win last week, ending the series in a 1-1 draw. Pakistan earlier scored a 3-0 win in the one-day series. Before the Caribbean tour, Pakistan also tied a Test series 1-1 in India earlier this year. 

Last year, Pakistan drew 1-1 against Sri Lanka, lost 0-3 to Australia and suffered a 1-2 home series loss to India. They, however, beat New Zealand 1-0 in January 2004. 

Pakistan host England for a three-match Test and five-match one-day series in October-December this year followed by another home series of three Tests and five one-dayers against rivals India early next year. They also host the Asia Cup in February next year. 

The coming season is very important for us, we have England and India and have a major one-day tournament. So we need to achieve more success and success is the barometer of a good team, said Inzamam. 

Pakistan lost the first Test at Barbados by 276 runs where Inzamam and allrounder Shoaib Malik missed out due to bans. 

You have injuries to key players which derails you. We lost the first Test because we missed a number of players and they (the West Indies) took advantage of it and won, said Inzamam. 

Inzamam said Pakistan missed express pacers Mohammed Sami and Shoaib Akhtar ? both declared unfit ? during the Test series. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan Cricket Board said the cricketers, who were involved in a fracas in Barbados, would face a minor probe so that such incidents do not recur in future. 

PCB director operations Abbas Zaidi said board chief Shaharyar Khan will have another round of discussion with Inzamam, vice-captain Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi and other players regarding the incident in which Afridi had clashed with Younis on Day I of the Barbados Test. 

Zaidi said team manager Saleem Altaf had briefed PCBs ad-hoc committee members on the incident on Friday and also told them about the proceedings of the tour disciplinary committee held to deal with the episode. 

Akram, Waqar to help pacers 

The PCB will seek the help of former fast bowling greats Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis in helping budding talent. The ad-hoc committee has given approval for having extensive and specialised training camps for seamers and opening batsmen and Akram and Waqar will be asked to help out the invited pace bowlers, sources said. 

They said the board, as part of its strategy to develop the existing pool of pace bowlers, had already decided to send three bowlers to the MRF Pace Foundation in India.

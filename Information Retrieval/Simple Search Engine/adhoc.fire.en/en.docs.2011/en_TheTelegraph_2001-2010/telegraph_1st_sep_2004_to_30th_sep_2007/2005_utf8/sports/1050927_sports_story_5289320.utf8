 Arjun Atwal finishes tied 53rd

San Antonio: Arjun Atwal played a sedate one-under 69 in the fourth and final round to finish tied 53rd in the Valero Texas Open at La Cantera Golf Clubs Resort Course. 

The Indian pro, who tallied one-under 279 for four days, paid the price for a poor round. On the final day, he had two birdies and one bogey. 

This was Atwals 16th cut in 17 starts and he now has $963,768 with a few more events to go. 

Robert Gamez, who has not won since 1990 and played 394 events without success, closed with six-under 64 to win the meet. 

Gamez opened with three birdies and added three more on the back nine for a three-stroke victory and his first win on tour in 15 and a half years. 

Gamez reached 18-under 262 at Lacantera Golf Clubs Resort Course. The victory was worth $630,000 for Gamez. 

Olin Browne, a winner two weeks ago at the Deutsche Bank Championship, also shot a 64 and finished at 15 under and was second. 

Mark Wilson (68) and third-round leader Woody Austin (69) tied for third at 14 under. 

David Duval, the former top-ranked player who made his first cut of the season at this tournament, had a closing 4-over 74 and tied for 60th. He had missed 18 straight cuts.

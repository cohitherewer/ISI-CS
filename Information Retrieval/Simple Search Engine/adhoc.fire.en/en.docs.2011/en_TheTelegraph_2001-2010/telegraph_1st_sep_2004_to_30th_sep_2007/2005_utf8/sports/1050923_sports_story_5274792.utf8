 English boon for Wright

Wellington: New Zealander John Wright has recruited England video analyst Tim Boon to help beat Australia in a second successive series. 

Fresh from plotting Australias downfall in the Ashes series, Boon will assist Wright, coach of the World XI, for the upcoming Test and one-day series in Australia. 

Tim should be able to give us a line on what (Australia) did and then its up to our side to perform, said Wright, who left for Melbourne on Thursday to begin planning for the series. 

Wright said Australia would be stung by their Ashes defeat and would look to the new challenge as a chance to redeem itself. 

They have so much to play for and wont want to give their selectors the opportunity to make any more changes to the side, Wright told a Christchurch newspaper.

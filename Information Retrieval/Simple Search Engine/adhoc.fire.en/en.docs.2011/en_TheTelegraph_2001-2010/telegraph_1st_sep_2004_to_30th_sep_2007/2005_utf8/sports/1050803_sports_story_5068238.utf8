 Injury scare for Vaughan 

 Michael Vaughan 

London: Englands preparations for the second Ashes Test against Australia suffered a blow on Tuesday when captain Michael Vaughan was str-uck on the elbow during net practice at Edgbaston in Birmingham. 

Vaughan, who was hit on the right elbow by England fast bowler Chris Tremlett, was taken to hospital for a precautionary X-ray. 

He suffered heavy bruising but no fracture, said an England and Wales Cricket Board spokesman after results of the X-ray were made known. 

The England management will reassess Vaughans condition after practice on Wednesday. 

Vaughan, 30, had linked up with the England team in upbeat mood after scoring a one-day century for his county Yorkshire against Derbyshire on Sunday. 

Should Vaughan be ruled out of the second test, batsman Paul Collingwood is his likely replacement, having been called up as a late addition to the 12-man England squad on Monday night. 

Opener Marcus Trescothick is the obvious choice to take over the captaincy. 

Vaughans side trail the five-match series 0-1 after losing by 239 runs at Lords 10 days ago. 

Vaughan has been credited with instilling his England side with self-belief. 

That confidence, however, does not appear to extend to beating world champions Australia in the Ashes. 

Twice Vaughan has been given the opportunity to predict the outcome of the series, and twice he has dodged it, swaying out of the way as if avoiding a waspish bouncer. 

Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath had predicted a 5-0 whitewash before the first Test. Vaughan, in reply, said England would concentrate on their own game. 

The question was re-phrased after Englands 239-run defeat at Lords. Vaughan, looking towards the second Test at Edgbaston starting Thursday, responded: I think theres a real opportunity to go out there and play some good cricket again. 

It was not exactly a spine-tingling, Churchillian call to arms from a man who had led England to 14 wins and a single defeat in 18 Tests before the arrival of the Australians.

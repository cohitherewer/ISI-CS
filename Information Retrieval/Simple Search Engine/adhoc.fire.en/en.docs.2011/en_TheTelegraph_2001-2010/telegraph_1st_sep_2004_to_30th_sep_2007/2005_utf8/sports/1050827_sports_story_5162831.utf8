 Tennis rackets go hi-tech

Washington: Hi-tech tennis rackets would be the latest attraction in sports goods shops across the country with manufacturers claiming the use of nanotechnology and magnetic forces that promise more power and precision to the players. 

When the No.1 mens player Roger Federer steps out at the US Open on Monday, he will be wielding a racket infused with nanoparticles that will make it feel more solid without any added weight. Similiary former champion Andre Agassi would be using a specially designed racket that can cup a ball on impact. (PTI)

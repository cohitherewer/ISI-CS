Cardiff: Two late goals by Dutch substitute Robin van Persie helped Arsenal to an easy 3-0 victory over Blackburn Rovers in their FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. 

French midfielder Robert Pires side-footed Arsenal in front after 42 minutes. Van Persie, who had been introduced only in the 82nd minute, finished Rovers off with fine left-footed strikes after 86 minutes and in stoppage time at the Millennium Stadium. 

Arsene Wenger?s team will face the winners of Sunday?s semi-final between Manchester United and Newcastle United on May 21, keeping alive their hopes of finishing the season with a trophy. 

It will be Arsenal?s 17th appearance in the final ? a record Manchester United will match if they win on Sunday ? and their fourth in the last five seasons. 

Arsenal?s win was achieved without top scorer Thierry Henry and centre-back Sol Campbell, who were both injured. 

Even without the key duo, Arsenal were too clever and too wily to succumb to a fiercely determined and aggressive Blackburn side which never looked like preventing Arsenal from winning once Pires had struck the opening goal. 

Blackburn, trying to reach their first FA Cup final since 1960, committed twice as many fouls as Arsenal ? 27 compared to 13. 

Most of those were on Patrick Vieira in the first half as Rovers attempted to break up Arsenal?s rhythm and passing game. 

However, their tactics were foiled by impressive performances from both Vieira and Pires. It was never a classic match, and Vieira and Pires have both played better, but they refused to be intimidated by Rovers and one or the other was involved in all three goals. 

Although Blackburn were only trailing 0-1 till the closing minutes, they never seriously threatened Jens Lehmann in the Arsenal goal, while at the other end a series of fine saves by Brad Friedel kept Arsenal at bay. 

?Blackburn started really well but we responded and proved how strong we are,? Vieira said. ?Robin came on and scored two fantastic goals.? (Reuters)

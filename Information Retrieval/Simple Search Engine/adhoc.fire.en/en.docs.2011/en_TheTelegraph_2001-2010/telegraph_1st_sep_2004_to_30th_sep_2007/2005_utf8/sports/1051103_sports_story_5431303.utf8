Brisbane: Australia have dropped leg-spinner Stuart MacGill for the first Test against the West Indies starting at the Gabba here on Thursday. 

MacGill was named 12th man after the selectors opted for New South Wales fast bowler Nathan Bracken in one of two changes to the team that beat the World XI in Sydney last month. 

As expected, Mike Hussey comes in for his long-awaited Test debut after opener Justin Langer ruled himself out with a broken rib. 

Captain Ricky Ponting said Bracken got the nod ahead of MacGill because of his ability to swing the ball at the Gabba. He has got a great record up here and he will bowl well on that wicket, Ponting told a news conference. Theres still a little bit of moisture in the surface and with maybe a little bit of weather around, thats the way weve decided to go. 

The inclusion of Bracken and Hussey is the latest in a series of changes to the Australian team since their Ashes defeat in England. 

Middle-order batsman Damien Martyn gave way to allrounder Shane Watson and pacemen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz were also dropped, giving the side a relatively new look at the start of the domestic summer. 

It is always sad to lose those guys, but theres always an upside of that, you get a bag of youthfulness back into the side, Ponting said. 

Theres more responsibility on a lot of the batters to put our hands up, with some of the inexperience in the middle order the way it is. 

The Australians have quickly got over the disappointment of losing the Ashes, as evidenced by their crushing win over the World XI in October, and the once-mighty West Indies clearly face a formidable task. The last time they toured here, five years ago, they were spanked 5-0 and their recent form has not been encouraging, having failed to win any of their last four series against all comers. 

The odds are heavily stacked against them but there have at least been some encouraging signs with Marlon Samuels career-best 257 in the warm-up game with Queensland, and the emergence of a new group of hostile young pacemen. Jermaine Lawson, Fidel Edwards, Daren Powell and Tino Best have been showing real promise. 

We know they are a very dangerous side and weve spoken about that, Ponting said. 

The batting is very good with quality down the list and their bowling can be dangerous. They are the sort of side that, if they do get a bit of confidence, will play even better. 

West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul has also refused to write off his teams chances after they successfully chased down a world record 418 in the fourth innings to win their last Test at St Johns in 2003. 

Australia are a strong team but we have a good team also, he said. Weve beaten them in the Caribbean chasing a huge total and I know we can win out here. The guys are gelling and helping each other, its a wonderful sight. Obviously we want to win and go out there and play some tough cricket, Chanderpaul said. 

For that to happen, much depends on out-of-form Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chanderpaul to score runs and their new battery of pacemen to deliver on the bouncy wickets. 

The meticulous coaching of Australian Bennett King could also help revitalise the one-time Caribbean powerhouses. King has not only stepped up up the players fitness levels, but also worked assiduously on technique. 

Chanderpaul is not concerned about Laras form slump. I am not worried about Brian too much. Brian is one of those guys who can turn his game at any time, he said. Its up to him now to turn it on if he wants to. 

Since arriving in Australia last month to play for the World XI, Lara has failed to reach double figures in five of his six innings here ? 0, 5, 0 in the one-day series, 5 and 36 in the Super Test match, 1 against Queensland. 

The West Indian superstar, just 316 runs away from becoming Test crickets all-time leading run-scorer, is considerably underdone for match batting practice before he faces nemesis Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Shane Warne.

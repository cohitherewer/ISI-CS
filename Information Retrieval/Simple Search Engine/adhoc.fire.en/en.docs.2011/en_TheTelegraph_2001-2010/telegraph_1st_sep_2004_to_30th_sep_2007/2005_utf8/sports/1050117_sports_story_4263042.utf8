 Safin happy with build-up

Melbourne: Two-time Australian Open finalist Marat Safin is happy that most of the focus for this year?s tournament has settled on defending champion Roger Federer and local hope Lleyton Hewitt. 

Beaten 6-7, 4-6, 2-6 by Swiss world number one Federer in last year?s final, Safin has had a low-key build-up in his return to Melbourne after a barnstorming finish to 2004. 

Fourth seed Safin scored back-to-back Masters series titles in Madrid and Paris to finish 2004 but has arrived for the Melbourne Grand Slam with little recent form of which to boast after losing his three Hopman Cup matches in Perth last week. 

He is happy to remain in the shadow Federer and Hewitt, who crushed Czech qualifier Ivo Minar to win the Sydney International on Saturday. 

?I have no problem with that ... Time will show who is going to be in the final. That?s why I don?t have any pressure,? Safin said on Sunday. 

?The people, they are putting them under pressure because everybody is expecting ... them to be in the final. It?s great. Even better for me,? the 2000 US Open champion said. 

Safin, 24, defied even his own expectations by reaching last year?s final despite being unseeded, with his confidence at an all-time low and his ranking at 86 after a long battle with wrist and shoulder injuries in 2003. 

?It?s a completely different situation right now because last year it was the time that nobody expected anything from me,? he said. 

?Basically I was starting from zero. And now I?m back in the top five. I would like to move on, climb up a little bit higher in the rankings,? he said. 

?It?s a new season, new beginning,? he said. ?So I try to do as best as you can even though it would be great to be in the final again. I would love to repeat it, even do better,? he said. (Reuters)

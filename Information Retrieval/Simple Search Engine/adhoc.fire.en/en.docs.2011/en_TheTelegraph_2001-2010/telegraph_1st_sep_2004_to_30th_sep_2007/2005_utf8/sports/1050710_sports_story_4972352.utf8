 London blasts hit Calcutta Cup

 - RUGBY 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The impact of the London blasts were actually felt at a city sporting event, with the semi-finals of the Calcutta Cup rugby championship at CCFC having to be cancelled on Saturday due to the non-availability of the Calcutta Police team. 

The Police team, scheduled to take on CFC in a last-four match, informed the organisers on Friday evening that stringent security in the city called for extra forces as a result of which they would be unable to field a team on Saturday. 

The organisers decided to put off both semi-finals ? the other featuring Future Hope and LMOB ? which will now come off on next Saturday. 

The policemen were called for emergency duty following heightened security in the city. They requested for a postponement and we had to oblige, said Vasant Kumar, vice-president of the Bengal Rugby Union.

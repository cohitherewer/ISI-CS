 ICC clears Harbhajan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: There is good news for Harbhajan 

Singh. The ICC has cleared his action. 

Confirming this, BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra said over his cellphone that the decision had been conveyed to him around 5 pm. 

Asked if he had passed on the news to Harbhajan, he replied: Not as yet. Harbhajan is in England and Im still trying to make contact. 

Harbhajan, it may be recalled, has been signed up by Surrey. 

PTI adds: The ICC has upheld our stand, its a victory for the BCCI, Mahendra said. 

Mahendra added that Harbhajan wont have to undergo any drill under a bio-mechanical expert. But as per my information, Dave Richardson (ICCs General Manager, Cricket) will have a word with him, he said. 

The ICC had appointed bio-mechanist Marc Portus to undertake initial analysis of Harbhajans action. Portus was asked to review all relevant match and bio-mechanical footage as well as any other relevant information on the bowler. 

The Indian off-spinner had been under the scanner after Match Referee Chris Broad, the former England opener, questioned the validity of his action twice ? in December 2004 and March 2005. 

Harbhajan had undergone corrective measures in late 

1998.

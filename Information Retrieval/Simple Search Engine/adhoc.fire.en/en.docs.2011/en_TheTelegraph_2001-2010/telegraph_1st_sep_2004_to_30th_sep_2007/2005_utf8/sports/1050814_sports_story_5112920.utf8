 Atwal misses cut

Springfield: Arjun Atwals hopes of making the cut at the US PGA Championship ended with a string of bogeys and double-bogeys as he was unable to tame the lower course at the Baltusrol Golf Club. 

The Indian ended his second round with a seven-over 77 on Friday and finished the two rounds before the cut at 11-over and crashed out. (PTI)

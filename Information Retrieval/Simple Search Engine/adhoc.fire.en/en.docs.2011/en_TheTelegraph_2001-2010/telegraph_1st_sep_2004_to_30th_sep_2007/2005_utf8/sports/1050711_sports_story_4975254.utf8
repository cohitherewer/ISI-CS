 Ireland, Scotland to vie for title 

London: Hosts Ireland set up title-clash with Scotland in ICC Trophy final to be held at Clontarf near Dublin on Wednesday. 

Ireland registered a four-wicket win against Canada, and Scotland defeated Bermuda by six wickets to pose a claim for their maiden ICC Trophy title.

Chasing 239 to win, Ireland were struggling on 106 for five but Peter Gillespie put on a 66-run sixth wicket stand with Trent Johnston leading their team to a spectacular four-wicket win. 

In the second semi-final, Scottish batsman Cedric Englishs 75 not out rescued his team against Bermuda. 

In reply to Bermudas 219, English struck form at an opportune time and also partnered former England allrounder Gavin Hamilton to put on 145 for the fourth wicket after the Scots were reeling at 52 for three at one stage.

 Handling Sehwag my biggest challenge

 Chappell feels Sehwag is a rare talent 

Harare: Greg Chappell has found explosive talent in Virender Sehwag and feels his biggest challenge is to harness it. 

Three months into his job as the coach, the Australian great regards the dashing opener as a rare talent 

He is so instinctive that there is a fear if too much of method is applied on him, it might end up ruining his rare talent, Chappell said here. 

He is a delightful and most interesting person. He, probably in many ways, will be one of the great challenges of my coaching stint in India, said Chappell as he looked to harness the talent of the opener for the benefit of the Indian team. 

The coach feels Sehwag has been getting the starts but has not been able to convert them into big scores. 

Sehwag has lately been getting off to his customary explosive starts but is unable to convert them into big knocks. Finding a way to use his immense talent efficiently and in the best way for the balance of the team is going to be my biggest challenge. 

Chappell said he had some thoughts on how to get the best out of Sehwag but would prefer discussing it with the dashing batsman first. 

I have some thoughts on it and I will share it with him before I do it with the rest of the world. I have been thinking and talking about it in the last few weeks and have got some ideas which might just challenge and interest him enough to bring the best out of him, Chappell said. 

The Sri Lankan series might be a good way to try those thoughts and get the best out of him. 

Chappell has similar high opinions about a few others in the squad and Irfan Pathan, having done so well in the Zimbabwe tour, was right up there in his list. 

Pathan is an exciting talent in Indian cricket. He has hunger. He has talent. He wants to be successful and wants to know what he has to do to achieve so. 

If we can have 15 players with that desire and hunger, we can go forward. There have been half a dozen or so guys, as well as few seniors who have been most impressive. There are couple of gaps in the equation but the nucleus is there. 

At full strength we are okay. We have the right balance of players provided injuries, form or illness dont eat into our squad at various times. 

Chappell said he had identified the 18 players who could form the nucleus of the squad for the 2007 World Cup, though he had not yet shared it with selectors. (PTI)

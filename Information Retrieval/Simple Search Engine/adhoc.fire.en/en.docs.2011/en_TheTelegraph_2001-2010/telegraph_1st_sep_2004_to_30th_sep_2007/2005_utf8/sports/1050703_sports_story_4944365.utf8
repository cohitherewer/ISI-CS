 Rio de Janeiro: Former world No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten was recalled to Brazil?s Davis Cup team on Friday after an absence of nearly two years caused by political in-fighting and injury. Kuerten was named in the team for the American Zone Group II tie at home to The Netherlands Antilles in Joinville on July 15-17 in what is effectively the competition?s third division.

 Kuerten?s last appearance was against Canada in September 2003, when Brazil were beaten and lost their place in the World Group.

 Paris: Sebastien Grosjean has pulled out of France?s Davis Cup quarter final tie against Russia later this month in Moscow because of fatigue.

 Grosjean said he made the decision after his Wimbledon quarter final defeat by Andy Roddick on Friday and had informed France captain Guy Forget he would not be available for the July 15-17 tie.

 ?I feel tired, both physically and mentally,? the Frenchman told a French paper. ?I need a break.?

 Bangalore: Boniface Prabhu, the international wheelchair tennis player, will represent India at the Grand Slam Wheelchair Tennis Championship at Rolland Garros, beginning on Monday. Boniface will also participate in the Dutch Open in Namur and the Belgium Open in Brussels, both of which are high-profile tournaments in the European Wheelchair Tennis Circuit.

 He recently won the doubles title at the Japan Open, where he also reached the singles final.

 Melbourne: Wayne McKewen, who will umpire the men?s singles tennis final at Wimbledon on Sunday, has been named the new tournament referee for the Australian Open. Tennis Australia on Saturday said that McKewen will replace Peter Bellenger ? who retired this year after 22 tournaments ? at the 2006 Open.

 McKewen, 38, has officiated at every Australian Open since 1989, including the men?s singles final 10 years in-a-row from 1992 to 2001. 

 McKewen has officiated at the last 64 Grand Slam tournaments. During his 23-year career, he has also officiated at 65 Davis Cup matches, including five finals. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil striker Robinho was fined by his club Santos on Friday after failing to turn up for training.

 Robinho played for the world champions on Wednesday as they beat Argentina 4-1 to win the Confederations Cup in Germany and said afterwards he was hoping to sign for Real Madrid.

 He also bade farewell to Santos supporters in an interview with Brazilian television.

 But Santos president Marcelo Teixeira immediately replied that Robinho had a contract until 2008 and any club wanting to buy the 21-year-old would have to pay a $50 million penalty.

 Santos players have to pay a fine to a kitty when they are late or miss training and Gallo said Robinho would have to contri- bute.

 Madrid: Argentine striker Maxi Rodriguez has signed for Atletico Madrid from Spanish rivals Espanyol as the Primera Liga club continue to strengthen their strike force.

 The 24-year-old, top scorer at Espanyol last season with 15 goals, signed for the Madrid side on Friday after passing a medical exam, the club said on their official website.

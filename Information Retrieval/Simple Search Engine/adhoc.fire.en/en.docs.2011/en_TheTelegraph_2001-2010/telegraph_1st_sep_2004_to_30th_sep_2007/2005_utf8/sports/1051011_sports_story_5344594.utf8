 Kaiser advice for Klinsmann

Frankfurt: Franz Beckenbauer has urged Juergen Klinsmann to spend more time in Germany and accept more help from his fellow-coaches to head off a row going into next years World Cup. 

Klinsmann was sharply criticised by the German media for a 2-1 defeat by Turkey on Saturday and several Bundesliga coaches questioned the wisdom of staging tough fitness tests for the squad a few days before the match. 

Beckenbauer is confident the zip will be back in the German game when they return to home soil to play China in Hamburg on Wednesday but he still believes Klinsmann can do more to ease the tension building in the home camp. 

Specifically, Beckenbauer said that Klinsmann should spend less time at his home base in California. 

Klinsmann must also let himself be helped, Beckenbauer, the head of the World Cup organising committee, said in his column on Monday. That means he should at least give thought to a few well-meant suggestions and correct a few points. 

One is the little time he spends in his home league. In World Cup year he should spend more days in Germany than in the USA, so as not to be open to the habitual charge that he is never here.

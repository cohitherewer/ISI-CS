The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?ve psyched myself to be a success on this tour: Kamran Akmal

 - ?I didn?t give up when I got dropped? Can?t be stopped if I?m destined to play? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Coach Bob Woolmer believes Kamran 

 Akmal is right up there among the top wicketkeepers of the 

 present times and the Pakistan coach isn?t off the mark. 

 The 23-year-old is outstanding. Moreover, he is more 

 than handy with the bat ? something the Indians learnt in 

 the first Test (Mohali). Akmal, who feels ?threatened? by 

 younger brother Adnan, spoke to The Telegraph the 

 other evening.

 The following are excerpts

 On when he started off as 

 a ?keeper

 In 1995-96? I used to play as 

 a batsman for Model Town Cricket Centre (in Lahore) but 

 decided to try my hand, as a wicketkeeper as well, at the 

 trials for the U-15 Lombard Bank-sponsored World Cup. As 

 it turned out, I got selected, but not as a specialist batsman! 

 My career as ?keeper, therefore, began rather unusually? 

 I went on to do well in that tournament where we lost to 

 the Reetinder Singh Sodhi-captained Indian boys in the final 

 at Lord?s?

 On the time it took to be 

 comfortable with the big gloves

 I didn?t have to make too much 

 of an effort? Main bas wicketkeeping pe dhyan 

 dene laga? It helped that I was quickly included in 

 the National Bank team? That allowed exposure and brought 

 me to the selectors? notice.

 On his idol

 Rashid Latif? The catch 

 he took of Mohammed Azharuddin off Waqar Younis in the 1996 

 World Cup (quarters, in Bangalore) is still fresh? Woh 

 sari zindagi yaad rahe ga.

 On having been Latif?s understudy 

 before his debut (in 2002-03)

 Rashidbhai helped 

 a lot, made me understand the essentials of my job. Today, 

 I?m also grateful to my coach, Mohammed Jameel.

 On having had to contend 

 with Moin Khan?s comeback rather early in his career

 Unka aur mera to koi muqable nahin 

 hai? He has served Pakistan so well? (After a pause) 

 I didn?t give up when I got dropped and, thanks to Allah, 

 I?m back. I can?t be stopped if I?m destined to play. Jitna 

 khelna likha hai, utna main khelunga. 

 On whether he envies a contemporary

 Adam Gilchrist? His 

 collection is excellent and he brings off amazing catches.

 On interacting with him 

 on the recent tour of Australia

 Gilchrist confirmed 

 that a ?keeper can?t relax for even a minute and suggested 

 I must practice for two-three hours every day. I spoke to 

 world record-holder Ian Healy as well and he said much the 

 same thing? Hamesha involved rehna hota hai?

 On how he concentrates

 By telling myself ball 

 aa raha hai, ball aa raha hai? Mujhe pakadna 

 hai, mujhe pakadna hai? If I miss anything, I tell myself 

 I can?t slip-up on the next ball? It?s a tense job.

 On what he learnt in Australia

 Handling the best bowlers? 

 That tour was an education because pitches in the subcontinent 

 are so different... Even as a wicketkeeper, I emerged better?

 On having got a one-day 

 hundred (124 against the West Indies in Brisbane) as an 

 opener

 All by the grace of Allah? Opening wasn?t difficult as 

 I?ve opened (in limited overs matches) in domestic cricket.

 On how he unwinds

 Listening to music? 

 A.R. Rahman and Sonu Nigam are among my favourites? 

 On whether he is into other 

 sport as well

 I like watching soccer 

 and I?m a David Beckham fan? His passing, his sheer presence 

 is a refreshing change from the rest. I also keep track 

 of tennis ? Andre Agassi is my favourite? Of course, there?s 

 little time to follow either soccer or tennis when I?m in 

 Pakistan? On tours, though, I?m glued to the sports channels.

 On this tour of India

 I?m grateful to Allah 

 that I?ve come back for a full tour ? last November, we 

 only came for the Platinum Jubilee ODI? I?ve psyched myself 

 to be a success.

 On the pressure factor

 It?s on both teams.

 On whether he has an immediate 

 goal

 I want to stump Sachin 

 Tendulkar. 

 On Adnan

 (Laughs) I fear 

 him the most? See him as a ?threat?? He has equalled Wasim 

 Bari?s Quaid-e-Azam record (11 catches in a match) and is 

 out to take my place? Indeed, earlier this season, he was 

 initially picked for the Peshawar ODI versus Zimbabwe.

 On their relationship at 

 home

 Ghar mein bhaiyon ki tarah hain? 

 There?s no competition (at home)? I inspired him to take 

 up ?keeping, lekin woh mere hi peeche lag gaya hai! At 

 times, even teammates tease that he?s better? Being the 

 elder brother, I do pray for his success. However, he shouldn?t 

 knock me off too soon.

 On whether life has begun 

 to change after that heroic Test-saving 109 in Mohali

 Nahin.

 Finally, on whether there?s 

 more pressure as expectations have soared

 (Laughs again) 

 Actually, after the first Test, pressure kam ho gaya 

 hai.

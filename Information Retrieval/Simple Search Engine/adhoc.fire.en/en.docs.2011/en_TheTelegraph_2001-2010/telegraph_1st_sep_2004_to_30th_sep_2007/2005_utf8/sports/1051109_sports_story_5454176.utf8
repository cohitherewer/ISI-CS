The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gerd Muller to accompany Bayern in city

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: We dont have any idea of football in India, but we know that Calcutta is a big market for this sport. So we grabbed the opportunity as soon as we got the invitation to play in this century old tournament, said Martin Haegele, head of International Affairs of FC Bayern Munich in a press conference at the Indian Football Association (IFA) office on Tuesday. 

A second team of Bayern ? comprising junior and reserve players ? will feature in the 111th IFA Shield, to be played later this month. 

Gerd Muller is the assistant coach of the team. Haegele said, They generally play in the Reguraliga and various age group tournaments and this is going to be their first overseas tour. 

Some prominent players of the main team like Owen Hargreaves, Jose Paolo Guerro, Michael Rensing and Owen Hargreaves, will feature in the visiting team. Bayern had to reshuffle their matches in the Reguraliga to play in the IFA Shield.

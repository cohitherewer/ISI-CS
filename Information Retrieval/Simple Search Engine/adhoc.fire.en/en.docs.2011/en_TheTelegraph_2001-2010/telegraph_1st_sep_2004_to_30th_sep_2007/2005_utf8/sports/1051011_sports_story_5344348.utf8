 Scolari to quit after 2007 Cup

Lisbon: Luiz Felipe Scolari will quit as coach however Portugal perform in the World Cup finals in Germany next year, the president of the national football federation said on Monday. 

If the World Cup goes badly, Scolari naturally will not stay, but if it goes well it would be impossible to hold on to him, even though it would be our desire to do so, Gilberto Madail said. 

Scolari took over at Portugal after leading Brazil to a fifth world title in Japan, winning all seven World Cup matches in the process. 

His contract initially expired in July 2004 but after leading Portugal to the final of the European Championships that year he agreed to stay on through to the 2006 World Cup. 

Scolari said he had received numerous job offers from top European clubs following the Euro 2004 finals.

Calcutta: Sania Mirza gave the crowd at the Netaji Indoor Stadium what it wanted ? a sumptuous win that has only whet its appetite, leaving it salivating for more. 

And more they will get, in the second round which the world No. 34 and third seed here at the WTA Sunfeast Open reached with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Japanese qualifier Junri Namigata on Tuesday. 

The end result was a good one, but the match wasnt a breeze for the Indian, such as the scoreline would suggest. Namigata gave as good as she got, holding her own against a more experienced and high-profile opponent and brushing aside an overwhelmingly partisan crowd that clapped, stomped and roared her on, not just after each shot ? winner or error ? but every move Sania made. 

Namigata, to her credit was able to focus enough to match groundstroke for groundstroke, forehand for forehand. And though Sania was never broken in the match, Namigata took her to deuce too many times for the latters comfort. 

In the first set, she was barely getting in 40 per cent of her first serves, and found herself fighting to survive in the fourth and sixth games. But breaks in the first and last games gave Sania the set. 

Sania broke again to go 1-0 up in the second, for once not missing an easy volley at the net. The games went with serve after that till the sixth, when again Sania found herself fighting to hold ? a double-fault and unforced errors the culprits. 

 Seventh game, and she broke again to go up 5-2, and in the eight, got her first two serves in and sent down a resounding ace to set up triple match point. She needed just one to wrap up the match, and did so when Namigata sent a backhand sailing long. 

Sania now meets Hungarian Melinda Czink in the second round on Wednesday. The Hungarian was a 6-4, 7-5 winner over Argentine Ma Emilia Salerni, earlier in the day. 

In singles play, meanwhile, Ruano Pascual came from a set down to oust countrywoman and fifth seed Laura Pous Tio 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. 

Earlier, the first high-profile match of the day was reminiscent of The Charge of the Light Brigade with Sunitha Rao and Neha Uberoi, both of the US, trading volley and thunderous serve in the battle of expatriates. 

Sunitha, however, managed to come out in front, winning 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, despite Neha being the more aggressive one. The day began with the exit of a listless Rushmi Chakravarthy, who was decimated 2-6, 0-6 by fourth seed Maria Elena Camerin of Italy. The Indian lost in the first round of the doubles, too, on Monday. 

In another first round matches, sixth seed Antonella Serra Zanetti swept past Taipeis Chia-Jung Chuang with a fluid 6-2, 6-3 victory, while eight seed Rika Fujiwara of Japan battled past Spains Arantxa Parra Santonja 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 to set up a second-round meeting with Indias Shikha Uberoi. Thai Tamarine Tanasugarn (94) was upset by Swedens Sofia Arvidsson (108) 2-6, 1-6. 

Meanwhile, Anastasia Myskina ? the world No. 12 and top-seeded here ? and Likhovtseva paired up and blew the Ankita and Sanaa Bhambri off court in a first round doubles tie. 

The Russian pair, seeded No.1 here, swept past the Indians 6-2, 6-0 in little under an hour. Sunitha also teamed up with Villmarie Castellvi of Puerto Rico for her second victory of the day, notching up a 6-4, 6-4 win over Evie Dominikovic of Australia and Russian Galina Voskoboeva. 

Also going through were Italian-Croat pair Maria Elena Camerin and Karolina Sprem who defeated Emmanuelle Gagliardi of Switzerland and Argentine Ma Emilia Salerni 6-4, 6-4. The final match of the day saw sisters Neha Uberoi (US) and Shikha Uberoi (India) triumphing 6-4, 6-3, over Romanias Edina Gallovits and Estonias Kaia Kanepi.

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs Romantic Liaison dispelled all doubts about her discomfort over a 1,200m sprint and lifted the Unknown Warrior Cup on Monday the way she liked. 

 Ridden by C. Alford, who had the Razeen-Veenas Pet daughter settled close behind leaders, Common Spirit and Noble Flash, till the top of the final turn, the filly went about her task to cruise home by seven lengths.

 Vijay struck two more through Aptitude and Alcades ? both favourites in their respective events ? but it was left to his fellow-schooler Harvinder Singh Bath to lead in the three winners. Professional commitments in Western India had kept the champion schooler away from the city.

 The afternoon, on the whole, saw a majority of well-backed horses delivering the goods in the seven-event card. Secret Desire, Boldwin and Pay Check were, however, exception to the expectations as they beat fancied runners in their respective events.

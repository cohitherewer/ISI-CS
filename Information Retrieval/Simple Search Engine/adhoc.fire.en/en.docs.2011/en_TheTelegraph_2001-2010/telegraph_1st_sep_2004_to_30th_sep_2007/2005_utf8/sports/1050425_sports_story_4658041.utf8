The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sasikiran moves into joint lead

 - DANISH MEET - Indian to take on Timman in grand finale 

Copenhagen: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran crashed through the defences of GM Tiger Hillarp Persson of Sweden to join Dutchman GM Jan Timman in lead after the conclusion of the 8th and penultimate round of the Sigeman amp; Co chess tournament here. 

Top seed Hikaru Nakamura of the US failed to break the defences of Timman on another eventful day and is now out of race for the top spot in this category-13 event. 

While both leaders are on 6 points apiece, Nakamura is a distant third on 5 points along with GM Curt Hansen of Denmark and next in line are Danish IM Davor Palo, GM Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova and GM Jonny Hector of Sweden with 4 each. 

GM Sune Berg Hansen is yet to find his form and is struggling on 3 points while Swede duo of Emil Hermansson and Persson remain at the bottom of the table on just 1.5 points. 

It will be an interesting finale with Sasikiran slated to play Timman in the final round game. The Dutchman will have white pieces in the game and is likely to play it safe. 

However, going by Sasikiran?s past and given his tremendous will to win, many expect the duel to be exciting, especially after the treatment Persson got from the Indian. 

The Swede ventured into dangerous territory early in the opening itself and Sasikiran was all game for thrills after an irregular variation. The middle game was simply intriguing and the Indian sacrificed a pawn for further complications that perplexed Persson in quick time. The final stroke was quite brilliant too, when Sasikiran, short of time, spotted an elegant manoeuvre that ended the game on the 40th move. 

For Nakamura the story was not too different from his other games in the tournament ? but result was. Amazingly enough, Nakamura once again played till the last nail, making Timman sweat hard for the half point in the middle game. 

Starting with the advance variation against French defence with his pieces, Nakamura looked in control of the proceedings in the queen less middle game after Timman just decided to defend a slightly inferior ending rather than plan a double edged game. 

The American tried his best to make a foray in Timman?s position but the latter was well aided by his immense experience and eventually Nakamura blundered away his chances on the 45th move when he lost a piece and was lucky to salvage the half point after 64 moves. 

Palo remained in contention for his final GM norm after drawing with Sune Berg Hansen rather quickly. The Dane, however, has an uphill task to achieve the feat as he is pitted against Nakamura in the last round game. 

Jonny Hector simply proved the superior player against Hermansson, who again looked out-of-sort after a couple of encouraging draws in the past rounds. Hector needed just 20 moves with his black pieces to record the fastest victory of the tournament. 

The other game of the day between Curt Hansen and Iordachescu was expectedly dry with the latter more concerned about putting an end to his losses rather than try for a win. (PTI)

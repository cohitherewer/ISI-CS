 Gibbs century in SA?s 211

 - SIXTH ODI vs ENGLAND 

Durban: Herschelle Gibbs held South Africa?s innings together with his second century of the series as England dismissed the home side for 211 in the sixth one-day International in Durban on Friday. 

Gibbs scored 118 ? the next highest score was 27 ? as South Africa were bowled out in 46.3 overs. Rain reduced the match to 48 overs a side and England were set 213 to win by the Duckworth/Lewis system. 

England must win to have a chance of drawing the series after South Africa won the last three games to go 3-1 up. The damp evening conditions, however, were expected to favour the seamers. 

Gibbs faced 133 balls and hit 10 fours and a six in his chanceless innings. It was his 15th one-day century. Darren Gough took two for 14 off nine overs while Alex Wharf and Kabir Ali both took three wickets. 

Gibbs? century was desperately needed after medium pacer Wharf removed Graeme Smith (one) and Jacques Kallis for a golden duck with consecutive deliveries to make it one for two in the fourth over. 

Smith edged to Marcus Trescothick at first slip and Kallis attempted to pull his first ball and sent it looping over his shoulder to Andrew Strauss at second slip. 

Gibbs and opener Adam Bacher consolidated with a stand of 52 for the third wicket before their partnership was ended in the 15th over when Ali trapped Bacher in front for 15. 

Ashwell Prince helped Gibbs add 61 for the fourth wicket before Prince, on 27, drove hard at a delivery from left-arm spinner Ashley Giles and was well held by Paul Collingwood at mid-wicket. 

Gibbs was eighth out in the 46th over after driving a delivery from Ali to Collingwood on the long-on boundary as the last six wickets fell for 42.

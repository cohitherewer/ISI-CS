Chennai: A tremor of moderate intensity hit the SDAT Stadium as the $400,000 Chennai Open kicked off on Monday evening. Olivier Patience, a Frenchman with a modest record, toyed with third seed Rainer Schuettler, before dumping him 6-2, 6-2. 

There was heartbreak for the home fans as two of their favourite sons went out in straight sets. Prakash Amritraj bowed out 4-6, 4-6 without once looking like a winner against Swiss Ivo Heuberger. Leander Paes showed some fight before succumbing 2-6, 6-7 (5-7) to sixth seed Yen-Hsun Lu. 

Paes? singles forays are restricted to Davis Cup these days. He accepted a wild card here keeping in mind the tie against China in two months? time. 

Up against an energetic 21-year-old who has just become the first man from Chinese Taipei to break into the top-100, Paes was caught napping. By the time he got his bearings right, Lu had already pocketed the first set. Blazing winners at will from the baseline and running his 10-year-older rival ragged, Lu silenced the vocal crowd. Not once did Paes hold serve. 

The second set had to be different simply because taking such a thrashing from a greenhorn is not in Paes? blood. He didn?t drop serve and forced a tie-break. One mini-break did the trick for Lu, who produced a low return forcing the Indian Davis Cup captain to mishit a half-volley. 

Paes put the result in perspective, saying that he had been overrun by his younger opponent. ?To be honest, Lu is one of the fastest movers on court since Michael Chang. He?s a counter-puncher with loads of talent,? Paes observed. 

Coming back to the shock of the evening, Patience was a man in a hurry. His serving was not of the highest class but he more than made up with some strong returns and electrifying volleys. 

Schuettler had every reason to believe he was the favourite going into his first-round encounter. A finalist here in 1999 as well as a Grand Slam (2003 Australian Open), the German clearly belonged to a higher plane. Or so it seemed. 

As the match unfolded, Schuettler was shocked by the Frenchman?s aggressive approach. Patience kept missing opening serves but was flawless in every other department. 

Schuettler managed to hold his first service game, thereafter he was swimming against the tide. Patience returned every ball, hit some amazing backhand returns and just didn?t give Schuettler a breather. 

The German, who has slipped to No. 43 after ending 2003 on a career-high world No. 6, wasn?t exactly gracious in defeat. ?I never got any rhythm in the match? In this form, I would have lost to anyone in the draw,? the disappointed German remarked. 

For a man who made some headway only last season after struggling the previous five years, it was remarkable the way Patience sustained the high level of intensity. Six double-faults and a woeful first-serve percentage (40) forced the 24-year-old Frenchman to drop serve twice. But his relentless assault on Schuettler?s serve fetched him six breaks of serve. 

Prakash had his famous family members and the 2,000-strong audience rooting for him right through the 118-minute match. Yet, the only spark from India?s top-ranked player came in game 4 of the opening set. 

Prakash caught Heuberger off guard with a chipped service return to push him to 15-40. His next shot, a well-controlled angled backhand crosscourt, looked good enough to give Prakash the crucial break. Agonisingly, the ball landed an inch wide. 

Heuberger, yet to break into the top-100 and whose biggest claim to fame was a brief romance with Martina Hingis, didn?t allow his 21-year-old opponent another opening on his serve. 

The match aptly reflected Prakash the tennis player. Armed with an effective backhand as well as good serving-volleying skills, Vijay Amritraj?s son didn?t show the consistency and solidity needed to win matches at this level. For the second straight year, he has failed to utilise wild cards and lost to players who are anything but intimidating. 

Paul-Henri Mathieu doubled the French joy with a businesslike win on court No. 3. Considered by many on the Tour as a future Grand Slam champion, the 22-year-old Mathieu swept past Serbian Janko Tipsarevic 6-3, 6-4. 

A potentially-explosive all-American duel turned out to be a flat affair with Justin Gimelstob handing out a 6-3, 6-3 defeat to Jan Michael Gambill. 

Michal Tabara, the 2001 champion, survived a humdinger with fellow-Czech Jiri Vanek, ultimately winning 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5).

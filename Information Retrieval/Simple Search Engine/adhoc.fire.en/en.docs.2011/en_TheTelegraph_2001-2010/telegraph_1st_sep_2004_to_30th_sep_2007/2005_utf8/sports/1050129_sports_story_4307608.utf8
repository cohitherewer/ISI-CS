 Serena banking on ?special court? chemistry

Melbourne: Serena Williams will be hoping history repeats itself when she meets fellow-American Lindsay Davenport in the Australian Open women?s final on Saturday. 

Williams won the Melbourne singles title two years ago after saving match-points in her semi-final win over Kim Clijsters. 

The former world No. 1 saved match-points in this year?s semi-final, too, against Maria Sharapova and hopes it might be an omen for her clash with Davenport. 

?I?ve had a lot of great wins on this court, two times in a row I?ve been down match-point to win. This is such a special court for me,? she said. 

 Davenport admits shes not been playing 

too well

Williams was on top of the world two years ago when she beat sister Venus in the Melbourne final to complete a sweep of the four Grand Slams but has won just one major since after being plagued by injuries and personal issues including the death of one of her elder sisters and the separation of her parents. 

Her days at the top seem numbered after the emergence of a new crop of Belgian and Russian women players but she bristled at suggestions she was a spent force. 

?I?m still the top fighter out there,? she said. ?When I play my best tennis everyone would have to agree that it?s next to impossible for someone to beat me.? 

Williams, 23, has been in great form this week and her play has been as good as her word. Her serve remains a lethal weapon and her groundstrokes are dangerous and she says she can?t wait for the final to start. 

?This is what I love to do. I love nothing more than walking out there, hearing my name being announced, ?Serena Williams,? the crowd goes wild. I love that feeling,? she said. 

?I love being able to perform and being able to play a sport that?s so fun, you can travel the world. I wouldn?t give it up right now for anything.? 

Davenport almost quit tennis last year because of chronic health problems but decided to soldier on after finishing the year ranked number one in the world. 

The easygoing Californian won the last of her three Grand Slam titles in Melbourne five years ago but wanted to try and win one more before hanging up her racket. 

By her own admission, the 28-year-old has not been at her best in Melbourne. She won a tight quarter final with Alicia Molik and came within two points of losing her semi-final to Nathalie Dechy. 

?This whole tournament has been such an awkward and different experience,? she said. ?I feel like I?m not playing that well, I?m struggling through all these matches but I?m in the final.? 

Williams will go into the final as a strong favourite to win despite losing her last two matches against Davenport, at Los Angeles and the 2004 season-ending tour championships. 

?Before I played her last year and beat her two times, I had lost to her a number of times in a row,? Davenport said. 

?I?ve seen her play a lot recently but obviously I have some confidence from winning. 

?But I?m still going to have to play well and I?m going to have to not let her dictate, and go for shots. Against a player like that, you know that?s what you have to do so sometimes it?s a little easier to focus on the task at hand.? 

Regardless of who wins the match, both women say they are happy the title will go to an American after last year?s all-Belgian final here, followed by Russian triumphs in the remaining three Grand Slams. 

?It?s great to have two Americans so it?s nice that we?ll be taking it home. We?ll just go out there try and play well and see what happens.?

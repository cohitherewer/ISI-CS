The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sania Mirza up 34 slots

New Delhi: India?s new tennis sensation Sania Mirza has jumped up 34 points to reach a career-best 132 in the latest WTA tour rankings, following her third round appearance in the Australian Open. 

Mirza, 18, put up a brave fight before going down to eventual champion Serena Williams in the third round of the season-opening Grand Slam in Melbourne. 

Before the championship, Sania was ranked 166. 

But her compatriots have a lot of catching up to do with Rushmi Chakravarthi dropping to No.349 from her previous 339. 

Sisters Ankita and Saana Bhambri fared no better. While Ankita slipped to No. 432 from 416, Saana did marginally better to move to 548 from 568. 

Top honours among women went to Lindsay Davenport, who retained her No.1 spot despite losing to Serena in the final. 

Serena moved up to the second spot from her previous No. 7. 

Roger Federer retained the pride of place in men?s rankings, a loss in the semi-finals of the Australian Open notwithstanding, while Lleyton Hewitt overtook Andy Roddick to gain the second spot. 

Russia?s newest Grand Slam champion, Marat Safin, retained his fourth spot among men after beating Hewitt in Sunday?s title match.

 ?Thunder? fancied to win in Mysore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: The Prashanth Pawar-trained Lord Of Thunder, who in his last outing was very impressive when he easily had the measure of his rivals, looks set to make it two in-a-row when he takes on 10 opponents for the 1,600m Continual Cup here on Wednesday.

 The eight-year-old by Cruachan out of Thundering Express, on that occasion, had also recorded a very smart timing. Maintaining his winning looks and form, Lord Of Thunder, to be partnered by Vijay Kumar, may not find it too much to put it across Anchor and Foolish Pursuit who look to be his main challengerss.

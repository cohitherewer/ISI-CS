The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?ve given everything for Pak cricket, none can question my commitment: Inzamam

 - ?I?m determined to again take our team to the top... Like we were, say, in the mid-Nineties...? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

The demands on an Indian captain touring Pakistan are many. Equally, the demands on a Pakistani captain on a tour of India are huge. Despite the pressures, Inzamam-ul Haq spared around 45 minutes to speak to The Telegraph on the eve of the ongoing Test at the Eden. Among the most dominant batsman (7,225 runs in Tests and 10,632 in ODIs) of his time, Inzamam didn?t duck a single question. 

The following are excerpts 

Q You?re in your 15th year at the highest level. How satisfied are you? 

A Career theek raha hai... I wouldn?t say I?ve been outstanding, but I?ve given everything for Pakistan cricket. Nobody can question my commitment... More recently, I?ve been given additional responsibility and I?m trying not to let anybody down. 

I suppose it has been one big learning curve? 

Nobody stops learning. In fact, one continues to do so even after retirement... Thanks to the experience of 15 years, I understand the game better... Understand and respond better to situations. 

You were a mega hit in the 1992 World Cup, but how long did it take to actually establish yourself? 

(Pauses) I needed about three-four years to mature... 

Given that your debut was as a 21-year-old, you?ve grown with the game. Off the field, how have you gained from cricket? 

I?ve grown in confidence... However, I haven?t changed as a person... Na main pehle cheekhta-chillata tha, na main abhi cheekhta-chillata hoon. 

Your first captain was Imran Khan. How much were you influenced? 

I only played some ODIs under him... He was positive in the extreme and my approach, too, is the same. 

Who did you idolise? 

Viv Richards... 

You must have interacted with him on quite a few occasions... 

A couple of times... I used the opportunity to get an insight into how he approached a game... His thoughts as he went out to slaughter the bowling. 

Are you a little peeved that despite your achievements, the world largely talks of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara? 

It doesn?t affect me... I accept they are better... Having said that, players should be judged on their effectiveness, the number of matches they have helped win... Comparisons for the sake of comparisons ought not to be made. 

You?ve talked of wanting to reach 10,000 runs in Tests as well... 

(Interrupting) That?s a goal, yes... Inshallah, I will. More important, though, is for Pakistan to again become a zabardaast team. 

Why has consistency left Pakistan cricket? 

Dekhiye, the loss of so many seniors after the 2003 World Cup hurt us... It?s not easy to get replacements for top players. Moreover, experience doesn?t come overnight. 

Who are the ones to watch out for? 

My pick is Shoaib Malik and Danish Kaneria. Both are gifted and are going to serve Pakistan very well and for long. 

Are you enjoying the captaincy? 

I?ve got a young team... We?ve got challenges, but I?m determined to again take Pakistan to the top... Like we were, say, in the mid-Nineties. 

How do you go about captaining? 

Don?t rave and rant, as going overboard will put the youngsters under even more pressure. This is one phase in their career when they have to understand the game... It?s going to be easier if the captain stays calm. 

In the dressing room, then, are you more of a bada bhai? 

(Laughs) I have to be, because of the age difference with most. 

You didn?t play much under Imran, but is there a captain you?ve admired? 

Wasim Akram. He would get excited in his first innings as captain... Later, woh thande dimag se kaptani karte the... His approach was aggressive, yet behaved very nicely with the boys. 

Isn?t it tough being both the team?s No.1 batsman and captain? 

Somebody has to take the pressure... Has to be one from the XI... Somebody took it before me and somebody will do so after me too. 

How do you handle pressure? 

By not trying to do anything different... After all, irrespective of the profile of a match or series, it?s still played with the same bat and ball... The profile doesn?t change the game itself. 

Most feel you ought to be more aggressive, have a bigger presence while captaining... 

I?m happy with the way I lead. 

Are you worried about the high turnover of captains in Pakistan? 

Jab tak likha hai ki kaptan rahoonga, utne din to rahoonga hi... 

You were upset when the Media and the rest went for your jugular after India won the Multan Test last year... 

Ab main kya kahoon? I do know who has what agenda, but wouldn?t like to elaborate... The subcontinent has a peculiar problem: The team is praised to the sky and beyond on winning and gets clobbered when it doesn?t. 

Apparently, you don?t read the newspapers and watch the news channels during a series... 

Try not to, lekin log khabar dete rahte hain. 

Where challenges go, what?s No.1 for Pakistan? 

Getting back to the top. 

Bob Woolmer?s appointment as coach evoked sharp criticism from many quarters. What are your views? 

Bob needs time... As for the PCB having again got somebody from overseas, well, I?m all for looking outwards if those at home aren?t qualified to coach. Being a great player doesn?t necessarily mean the same person is going to be a great coach. 

What?s the No.1 lesson learnt from the great escape in Mohali? 

 (Smiles) That anything is possible... That one must never give up... The gains from the first Test, I?m confident, will be evident throughout this tour. 

How different is this Indian team from those of the Nineties? 

This lot fights and does so till the last ball... In my opinion, credit has to be given to Sourav Ganguly and John Wright. 

Looking back, which are your favourite innings? 

In Tests, it?s the 329 against New Zealand, at the Gaddafi (2001-02). As for the ODIs, the unbeaten 90 versus the West Indies in Port-of-Spain when we toured the Caribbean in 1992-93. 

Given that you?re somewhat of a recluse, do hordes of fans put you off? 

Part of the game is being chased by autograph seekers... I accept that. Yet, sometimes, it?s a bit too much. 

How far ahead are you looking? 

Depends... A cricketer would like to play forever, but that?s not possible... I?m 35, let?s see... Fitness pe kafi depend karta hai. Also, performance. If I don?t perform, mere paas koi choice hi nahin rahega! 

Why have you featured in so many run outs? 

(Laughs again) Look, even if I wasn?t responsible, I got the blame... Early on, the understanding with those at the other end wasn?t there... Of course, I accept I wasn?t good at running between the wickets either. 

Lastly, is there a problem between you and Shoaib Akhtar? 

Koi aisi baat nahin hai... The Media keeps making it a big story.

 Lanka release four players

 - Charity Matches in New Zealand

Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket have released four players, including Muttiah Muralidharan, for a World XI one-day series in New Zealand later this month. 

The matches were requested by New Zealand Cricket after Sri Lanka returned home early from their tour of New Zealand following a tsunami that has killed at least 156,000 people across Asia. More than 30,000 have been killed in Sri Lanka. 

Kumar Sangakkara, Chaminda Vaas and Sanath Jayasuriya will join Muralidharan and six Australians, including Shane Warne, already named for the three matches on January 22, 24 and 26. 

The matches have been arranged in conjunction with the players? union, the Federation of International Cricketers Associations and will also raise money for emergency relief in affected countries. 

 Tour options 

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka could play two Tests in New Zealand in April, New Zealand Cricket said on Monday. ?There are a number of options and one is to look at a couple of Tests in the first half of April,? chief executive Martin Snedden told Wellington?s Dominion Post newspaper. 

Sri Lanka returned home following the December 26 tsunamis with four limited-overs matches and two Tests unplayed. Under a proposal put to Sri Lanka by New Zealand Cricket, the team would return in April to play two Tests and at a later date to complete the one-day series.

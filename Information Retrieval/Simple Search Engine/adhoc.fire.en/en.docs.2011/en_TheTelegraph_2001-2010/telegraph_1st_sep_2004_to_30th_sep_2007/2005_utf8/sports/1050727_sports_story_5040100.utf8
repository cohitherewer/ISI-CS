 Becker breaks up with French girlfriend

Berlin: Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker and his French girlfriend of three years, Caroline Rocher, have separated, a weekly magazine has reported. 

The 37-year-old Becker, who won tennis most coveted trophy in 1985, 1986 and 1989, said the split with the 28-year-old, St Etienne-born ballet dancer had been amicable. 

Becker, known for his womanising ways, said: We have been going through a crisis for the past six months because of my frequent trips for work. 

Rocher said however that Becker had been faithful. 

According to Tuesdays edition of a German newspaper, Becker has a new girlfriend ? a 17-year-old Russian named only as Elena L ? whom he met on the Spanish mediterranean island of Majorca, though Beckers communications advisor denied they were involved in a relationship. 

The break-up is the latest in a catalogue of traumatic relationships for Becker, better known as Boom Boom when he was a player for his serve. 

Becker divorced Barbara, his wife of seven years and mother of two children, in 2001 and then it was revealed that he had fathered a daughter with Russian model Angela Ermakova after a brief liaison in London in 1999.

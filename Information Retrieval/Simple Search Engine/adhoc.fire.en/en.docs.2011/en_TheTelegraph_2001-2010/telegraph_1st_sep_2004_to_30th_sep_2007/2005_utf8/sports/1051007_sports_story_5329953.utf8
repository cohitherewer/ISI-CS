 Its an insult to the game: Kapil

New Delhi: Kapil Dev on Thursday said the recent face-off between Team India captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Greg Chappell should serve as a lesson for everyone involved with the game. 

This (the controversy) is an insult to Indian cricket. Whatever has happened is unfortunate and the media should also be blamed for it. Now the emphasis should be on how to bring the game back on track, the former India captain said. 

Despite the personality clash between captain and coach, country should always get first preference, Kapil felt. People have different personalities. But country comes first. Its (the clash) a part and parcel of the game but it should not affect Indias image. 

I would request the two of them to keep their personal differences out of the game, he said. 

On the leak of Chappells confidential e-mail, addressed to the BCCI president, Kapil said, I hope this does not happen again. 

Kapil also defended Chappell. Two months are too little to form an opinion. Overnight, things cant change but it appears he is working for the best interests of Indian cricket. (PTI)

 Referee reports racist chanting 

Madrid: The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) is likely to investigate the racist chanting during Sunday?s derby between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid after the referee mentioned it in his match report. 

?I asked the match delegate to make an announcement on the public address system to ask the fans to stop making monkey noises when certain players had the ball,? said referee Alfonso Perez Burrull. 

?As a result... the noises grew louder.? 

Real Madrid?s Brazilian fullback Roberto Carlos was particularly singled out by the crowd for the abuse at certain points during the game at the Calderon which Real comfortably won 3-0. 

The Spanish Federation only investigates such incidents if the referee notes them in his match report. 

Racist abuse at black players has been on the rise in Spain in recent months, but not always mentioned in referees? reports. 

European soccer?s governing body Uefa fined Real Madrid $12,820 after racist abuse by some of the club?s fans during a Champions League match against Bayer Leverkusen in November.

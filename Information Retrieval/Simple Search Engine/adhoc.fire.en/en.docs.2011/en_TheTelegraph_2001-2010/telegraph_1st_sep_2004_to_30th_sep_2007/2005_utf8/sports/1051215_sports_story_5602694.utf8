 Injustice done to Sourav: Dalmiya

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

 Jagmohan Dalmiya

Calcutta: Former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya feels injustice has been done to Sourav Ganguly. The former Team India captain was axed for the third and final Test against Sri Lanka which will be held in Ahmedabad from Sunday. 

I am not aware of any non-cricketing reason for Souravs omission? If that is the case, its very unfortunate. Whatever it is, injustice has been done to him (Sourav), Dalmiya said on Wednesday. I saw Souravs batting in both innings in Delhi, he looked in good touch. 

The cricket fraternity was angered by Wednesdays developments in the capital. The following are some of the reactions: 

KIRTI AZAD: No one can raise a finger at his performance in Delhi. I am shocked. It seems he has been put on the chopping block for reasons other than cricket. It seems the five wise men have set standards even higher than what one finds in Australia. If that be so, they should apply the same yardstick to other players. 

Sambaran Banerjee: Sourav deserves a better deal, going by both his recent performance and past record. This is not cricket. 

ARUN LAL: I am very disappointed but not very surprised. The team management has been looking for young blood. They had to make this harsh decision. This has nothing to do with board politics. Sourav came into the side on his own merit. But I still believe this issue could have been handled much better and they could have waited till the end of the series. 

ASHOK MALHOTRA: It was shocking to say the least. Sourav has stood up and performed every time he has been asked to. Now it appears they just want to block Souravs way. They are wary that he might get a big score in Ahmedabad, and it would have made their job tougher. I cant think of any big name in the Indian team who would played Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy to prove his worth? I cannot rule out a More-Chappell nexus.It is now almost definite that his name wont figure in the Pakistan-bound squad and Souravs comeback will depend on how India perform in Pakistan. 

DATTATREYA MUKHERJEE: Souravs exclusion has nothing to do with cricketing logic, it is simply a game played by a few in the Board and the team management.. 

SUBRATA POREL: It is shameful. This selection committee has no value as four of the members have no idea what international cricket is all about. Greg Chappell and Kiran More have been trying to leave out Sourav for long and Board politics has made their task easier. 

E. A. S. PRASANNA: I am shocked. He shouldnt have been treated like this. He performed quite well at the Kotla), dropping him from the third Test defies logic. You cant treat a cricketer like him so shabbily. They should have given him the opportunity to call it a day. If they wanted Wasim Jaffer in the side, the selectors should have dropped Gautam Gambhir. 

PRANAB ROY: You cant treat a player, and that too of Souravs calibre, like this. He has done so much for the country as captain and batsman?

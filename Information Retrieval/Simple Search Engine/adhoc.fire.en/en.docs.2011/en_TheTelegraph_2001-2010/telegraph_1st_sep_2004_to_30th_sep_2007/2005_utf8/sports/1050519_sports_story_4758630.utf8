 United to miss Neville, Heinze

London: England defender Gary Neville and Argentinas Gabriel Heinze are almost certain to miss the FA Cup final against Arsenal on Saturday, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said on Wednesday. 

Ferguson said Heinze had virtually lost his fight to recover from an ankle injury while Nevilles chances of overcoming a groin injury were only marginally better. 

I think Gaby Heinze is out. He doesnt want to be ruled out at this moment in time but I dont see him playing, Ferguson told a news conference. 

On Neville, he added: Hes not training, weve got the medical people working on him at the moment, thinking of something we can do to give him a chance... Its not looking good. 

Neville missed Uniteds last league game of the season at Southampton on Sunday. 

Heinze has been out of action for almost a month since injuring his ankle against Newcastle United on April 24. 

Ferguson said he was sorry that Heinze, a successful signing from Paris St Germain a year ago, would miss the showpiece final at Cardiffs Millennium Stadium. I particularly feel for Gaby because hes been fantastic this season, hes been a tremendous professional and a real winner, Ferguson said. He deserves to play in the final but I think its beyond him now. 

Ferguson, meanwhile, has called on the teams fans to forget their opposition to Malcolm Glazers take-over of the club and focus on the final. 

Its (the fans) big day too, they want us to win the Cup so therefore we will have a united front on Saturday, players and supporters together, to win this Cup, said Ferguson. Nothing else matters. 

Of course the fans are emotional and with the loyalty they have shown over the years that is understandable, but Im sure they wont let us down on Saturday either, added Ferguson, whose team are the holders and record 11 times winners. 

Furious United fans have demonstrated against US financier Glazers take-over of the club and vowed to carry their protests into the Cardiff final. 

Glazer on Monday upped his stake in United to more than 75 per cent, seizing full control of the club. Fans say he has no knowledge of football and plans to cream off Uniteds profits to pay back huge debts incurred buying the club. 

Everything is geared to Saturday for us, all the rest is peripheral, said Ferguson. (REUTERS)

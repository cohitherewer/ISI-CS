 Swati, Supriya among leaders

 - WOMENS NATL B CHESS 

Sangli: Five players were leading the bunch with 3.5 points each at the end of the fourth round of the 32nd womens national B chess championship here Friday. 

The players in the forefront were Bengals Swati Mohota and Supriya Maji, along with Kiran Manisha Mohanty of Orissa, Jharkhands Baisakhi Das and Maharashtras Amruta Mokal. 

While Manisha drew with Mokal and Supriya was held by Baisakhi, Swati gained a full point against S. Sujatha of Tamil Nadu in fourth round match-ups. 

On the first board Manisha opened her game with kings pawn which was replied by Amruta with Sicilian Kan-Paulson variation. Amruta made a mistake on 28th move and lost an opportunity to win a pawn. 

Towards the end Manisha held a slight advantage of passed pawn, but both the players settled for safety play and the game ended in a draw after 48 moves. 

On the second board the game between Supriya and Baisakhi began with Sicilian Alapin variation. In the middle game Baisakhi had a clear advantage but committed errors on the 25th and 31st moves and squandered a winning chance. The game was drawn after 51 moves. 

Sujatha took a gamble by sacrificing her knight away in return for three of Swatis pawns on the 25th move. But the Tamil Nadu woman could not get adequate compensation to win the game and towards the end Swati employed her bishop pair successfully to win the game. (PTI)

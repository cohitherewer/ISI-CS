 Chappell disappointed 

Harare: Team India coach Greg Chappell was looking forward to sharing the same dressing room with Sachin Tendulkar but the news of latters withdrawal has disappointed him no end. 

I am disappointed that Tendulkar wouldnt be seen on this tour but it is important that he recovers completely and is fit for Indias future engagements, said Chappell on Wednesday.

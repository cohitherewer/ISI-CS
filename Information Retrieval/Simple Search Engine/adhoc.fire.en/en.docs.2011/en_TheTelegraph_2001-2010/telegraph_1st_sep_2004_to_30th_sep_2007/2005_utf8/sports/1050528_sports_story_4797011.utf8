London: Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan plundered centuries before Englands bowlers left an inept Bangladesh side teetering on the edge of an innings defeat after the second day of the first Test at Lords on Friday. 

Trescothick, with 194, and Vaughan, 120, put on 255 for the second wicket to set up Englands total of 528 for three declared, scored at almost five an over. 

Bangladesh, needing 420 to make the home side bat again, then imploded for the second time in the match to close on 90 for five. They made 108 in their first innings. 

The left-handed Trescothick, seeking a second Test double century, batted for just over six hours and hit 92 in boundaries. 

For Vaughan, it was a 14th Test hundred and his third in consecutive innings at Lords. It also came in the England captains 100th Test innings and ended a 10-month run without reaching three figures. 

Bangladeshs hopes of saving face on their second visit quickly evaporated. With 22 overs remaining, they lost their top order. 

Nafis Iqbal, on three, edged Matthew Hoggard to second slip and straight into Andrew Flintoffs buckets-for-hands. 

Bashar, a gifted batsman who had thrown away his wicket in the first innings, then inexplicably did it again. After two boundaries, he shovelled fast bowler Simon Jones first ball straight to square leg. 

Bangladeshs misery was complete when Mushfiqur Rahim was caught behind.

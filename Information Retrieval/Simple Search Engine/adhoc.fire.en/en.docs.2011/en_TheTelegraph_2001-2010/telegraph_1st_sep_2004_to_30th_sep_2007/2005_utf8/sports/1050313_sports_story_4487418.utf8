 Inzy: Day didn?t start with hope

 - We could not finish the way we wanted: Sourav 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: When Pakistan?s ?lead reached 210 with around 35 overs still to go for the day?, Sourav Ganguly knew it was all over for the Indians. Pakistan had managed to crawl back from the dead and force a draw. 

The Indian captain did not think it would be hard to reconcile themselves to this result. ?I don?t think it will be tough. We must give credit to Razzaq and Akmal. We dominated this Test for four days; it?s just that we could not finish it off the way we wanted. 

?They were six wickets down at the start of today, we had 97 overs to get them out and get the remaining runs, and we couldn?t.? Sourav said with a tinge of sadness. 

But did he miss Harbhajan Singh, especially on the final day? ?Well, we did not know at the start of the Test what would happen. We saw the moisture on the wicket, made a decision to play the third seamer, and so we had to leave Harbhajan out. And our bowlers bowled well until yesterday, so it looked like a good decision.? 

Inzamam-ul Haq conceded he didn?t see much hope going into the fifth day. ?Honestly, I didn?t have many hopes. But both Razzaq and Akmal are good batsmen, and I thought that if we could take a lead of 200, we could put pressure on India. They played tremendously and showed character. It will help us in the rest of the series. Our morale is high now,? said the Pakistan captain. 

Inzamam agreed their fielding needed ?much improvement?. ?We let go many opportunities. If we had held on to some of the chances here, this Test could have been more interesting.? 

How did he feel when Pakistan were 10 for three in their second innings? ?Oh, it was very difficult. We had begun the innings 204 behind, and there were still two days left. But the boys were very determined, and they showed character in coming back into the game.?

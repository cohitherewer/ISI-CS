 Rosenborg test for Real

 Real are going to keep on improving, says Zidane 

Real Madrids recent revival will be put to the test in the Champions League on Wednesday when they host Rosenborg Trondheim without leading striker Ronaldo, adds a report from Madrid. 

Instrumental in Reals recovery with five goals in their last three league games, Ronaldo suffered an ankle injury during Saturdays 3-0 win over city rivals Atletico Madrid that will sideline him for a month. 

But Real, who went on top of the Primera Liga for the first time in 18 months after beating Atletico, are determined to show they are not overly-dependent on the Brazilian. It was just a question of time before we started playing better, French midfielder Zinedine Zidane said on Monday. We played well as a team against Atletico and we are going to keep on improving. 

Zidane gave a low-key performance against Atletico, but is still likely to be given the nod ahead of the in-form Guti for the Rosenborg match at the Bernabeu. Brazilian striker Robinho should step into Ronaldos shoes, although coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo could also choose Julio Baptista to partner Raul. 

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez, meanwhile, is expected to utilise the pace of Djibril Cisse in Wednesdays Champions League clash with Anderlecht. The latter have lost their last nine group games in the competition. 

PSV Eindhoven will seek revenge for one of their most painful defeats when they visit AC Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday. Last season Milan needed a stoppage-time strike by Massimo Ambrosini to scrape past PSV in the semi-finals on the away goals rule despite a 3-1 defeat in The Netherlands. (AGENCIES)

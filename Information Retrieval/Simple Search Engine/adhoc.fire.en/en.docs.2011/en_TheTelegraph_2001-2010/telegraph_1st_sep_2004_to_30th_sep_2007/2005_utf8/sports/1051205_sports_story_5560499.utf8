The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Board consults Dravid on itinerary

 - Captain, coach confer with two of three new selectors 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chennai: In a welcome move, 

 the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) brass took 

 Rahul Dravids views into account ? even though, technically, 

 he hasnt been retained captain ? before finalising 

 the itinerary for the forthcoming tour of Pakis-tan. 

The itinerary suggested by Pakistan was faxed to Dravid a couple of days ago... Today, his opinion was formally sought once it was known that the Asia Cup had been indefinitely postponed... Dravid spoke to the coach (Greg Chappell) and some of the seniors before communicating his views to secretary Niranjan Shah, a top source told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

According to the source, Dravid (on behalf of the team) requested that the tour have a delayed start instead of beginning on January 1, allowing more time to recover from the home engagements which began on October 25 and will only end on December 22. 

Given the Asia Cup development, the BCCI suggested the change to Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan, who agreed. With Khan timing his Mumbai visit to coincide with the working committee meeting at the CCI there, the itinerary was effectively finalised over lunch. 

While the Boards have agreed, New Delhis consent has to be taken. Getting the Ministry of External Affairs clearance shouldnt be a problem. As on the last tour, 2003-04, Peshawar is just going to host one of the ODIs. 

Meanwhile, despite there again being no play at the Chepauk, Dravid and Chappell had a somewhat busy day. Somewhere at the top of their agenda was a 90-minute meeting with two (Bhupinder Singh Sr and Sanjay Jagdale) of the three new selectors. 

 The other newcomer, Easts 

 Ranjib Biswal, hadnt arrived by the evening.

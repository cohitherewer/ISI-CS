 Greg open to coaching India

Mumbai: Greg Chappell, who is here on a private visit, has said he is open to the possibility of coaching Team India after the end of John Wright?s tenure. He, however, emphasised that the BCCI has not approached him yet. 

Without mentioning the Team India captain by name, Chappell said Sourav Ganguly?s poor run with the bat of late was because the latter was not focussing enough . 

?When a player is not in form, the reason is he?s not focussing on the things he should be focussing on. He?s focussing on the scoreboard, on what his teammates must be thinking and what the press is writing on him,? Chappell said. ?I?m not going to mention any names here. But you know who I am referring to.? 

He was all praise for the current Indian Test batting order. ?The Indian line-up is not only the best in current times, but also the finest in a long time.? 

It may be recalled that not many months ago, Chappell was approached by the West Indies Cricket Board but the move fell through. (Agencies)

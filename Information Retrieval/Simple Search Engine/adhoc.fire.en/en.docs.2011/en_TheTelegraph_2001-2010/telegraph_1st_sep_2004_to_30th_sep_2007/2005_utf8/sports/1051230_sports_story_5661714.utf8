 India wallop Sri Lanka 

Karachi: Indias women cricketers on Thursday made a perfect start to their Asia Cup defence, defeating Sri Lanka by ten wickets at the Gymkhana ground. 

India, who beat Sri Lanka in the two-nation first Asia Cup in 2003, raced to 118 for no less in 27.3 overs after bundling their opponents out for a meagre 115 in 48.5 overs. 

Hosts Pakistan, the third team competing in the double-league event, lost to Sri Lanka by 14 runs in the opening match on Wednesday. 

Off-spinner Nooshin al-Khadeer with three for 11 and leg-break bowler Reema Malhotra (3 for 31) rocked the Sri Lankans, who failed to build any partnership. Chamari Pologampola top-scored with 23.

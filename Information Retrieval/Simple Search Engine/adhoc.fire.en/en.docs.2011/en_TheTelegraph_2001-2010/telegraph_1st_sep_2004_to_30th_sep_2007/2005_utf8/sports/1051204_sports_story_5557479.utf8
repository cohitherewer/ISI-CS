 Sourashish spins Bengal to victory

 - RANJI TROPHY 

 Sourashish took 5 for 57 

New Delhi: Bengal put on a commanding performance to score a 10-wicket victory against Delhi with a day to spare in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match on Saturday. 

The visitors thus collected five points, including a bonus. They claimed the bonus after openers Arindam Das and Subhomoy Das put their heads down to chase the 69-run target without being separated. 

Earlier, off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri (five for 57) wrecked the hosts line-up to sent them packing for 131 on a pitch which got increasingly tough to bat on as the game progressed. 

Lahiri, who returned match figure of seven for 116, extracted considerable bounce and turn from the under-prepared wicket to script Delhis downfall.

 Monteiro confirms for Midland

Lisbon: Portugals Tiago Monteiro will drive for the Midland Formula One team next year, newspapers reported on Friday. 

My participation is assured with Midland F1 in the next World Championship. I got here from England with the best news, the confirmation, the paper quoted him saying at a banquet on Thursday. 

Midland would not confirm the reports, however: There will be a press release when we have something to announce, said a spokeswoman. 

Monteiro, 29, raced for Jordan this year and finished third in the US Grand Prix that was reduced to a six-car fiasco after the Michelin-equipped teams withdrew for tyre safety reasons. (Reuters)

 Indecent rush to cash in on Ashes success

 Guest Column / Michael Atherton

 If Fletcher reveals dressing-room secrets, he will alienate players

After the fever, the frenzy. The Ashes series was truly remarkable in many ways, not least of which has been the speed at which it has been exploited. 

There has certainly been little chance for mature reflection given the unseemly haste, which all parties ? participants and voyeurs alike ? have shown to grab a slice of the action. 

Last week, there were at least three advertisements for what looked like the tackiest of commemorative mouldings, which would be welcomed by surely only the saddest of mantelpieces. 

Then the DVDs. The production company behind Channel 4 cricket have been working their staff furiously to get three, at the last count, on to the market. 

Four books, trumpeting Englands triumph, have already been produced. 

The one that will get the most publicity, and which will sell the best, will be Being Freddie which, unlike being Freddied, will be a sober look at the life of our hero so far. 

Even Duncan Fletcher will have a diary of the summer in publication, co-written with Steve James of this parish. 

By my reckoning, it is Fletchers first attempt to exploit his position commercially. Six years into the job, he has shown commendable restraint. 

Nevertheless, the dangers of a coach writing a diary while in situ will not be lost on him. 

If he gives away some dressing-room secrets he will be in danger of alienating players with whom he still has to work ? much as Glenn Hoddle did when he lifted the lid on events in France in 1998. 

If, on the other hand, Fletcher reveals too much of himself, then he will run the risk of losing the mystique and mystery he has created by being so guarded with the media. 

There is a similarity here with the current England football manager: at the beginning of Sven-Goran Erikssons reign, every word was pored over as if they emanated from the mouth of an Oriental mystic. 

It was only when Eriksson succumbed to the temptations of the job, and started advertising Sainsburys and tacky classical music CDs that we realised that he was simply another football manager on the make. 

Fletcher is too shrewd, I think, to fall into either trap ? all of which means he is unlikely to give too much away. 

One who wont be compromised is Gideon Haigh, the Australian whose sparkling prose lit up the pages of a newspaper throughout this summer. 

Haighs diary of the Ashes summer will get the least publicity of any that will be published this autumn. 

I would lay a very large wager that it will be, by some distance, the best.

 Jamshedpur archer betters world mark

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: City-based archer Jhanu Hansda today bettered a world record mark, scoring 352 out of a possible 360 points at 70 metres in the first national ranking tournament in Hyderabad. 

The record is held by Valerie Fabre of France, who scored 349 points at the European Championship held in Mouscron, Belgium, in June 2001. 

Jhanu was representing Jharkhand at the meet, which will decide the selection of the Indian team for the European Championship. India can take part as it figures in the top 10 in the world rankings. 

Jharkhand Archery Association secretary Sanjeeva Singh said the details of Jhanu?s feat would be sent to Federation Internationale de Tir a l?Arc, the Lausanne-based governing body of the sport, for ratification as a world record.

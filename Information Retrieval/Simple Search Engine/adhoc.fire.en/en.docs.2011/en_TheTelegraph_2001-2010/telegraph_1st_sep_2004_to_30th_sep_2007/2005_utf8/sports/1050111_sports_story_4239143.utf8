Madrid: Real Madrid?s 3-0 derby victory over neighbours Atletico closed the gap on league leaders and arch-rivals Barcelona to seven points after the Catalans crashed 0-3 at Villarreal. 

Two goals from Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo either side of one from Argentine winger Santiago Solari gave a South American flavour to Real?s victory. 

In similar fashion, Barcelona were undone by players from the same continent. 

Former Manchester United striker, and Uruguayan international Diego Forlan, got two goals to accompany the strike from Villarreal?s Argentine defender Gonzalo Rodriguez, who finished off a free-kick from his compatriot Juan Ramon Riquelme. 

?We deserved to lose,? admitted Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. ?Villarreal were clearly superior ? not necessarily in football terms ? but in their intensity, their pressure and the way they adapted to the state of the pitch. 

?It?s a bad start to the new year but it?s a wake-up call and we will get good results again soon.? 

Real?s victory ended Atletico?s unbeaten record at home this season. The win also left Real seven points adrift of Barcelona. Champions Valencia are level on points with Real in third following their 2-1 win over neighbours Levante on Saturday. 

Espanyol reclaimed fourth place in the standings after a sparkling 4-1 comeback win at home to Osasuna. 

Osasuna took the lead when Cameroon striker Pierre Webo squeezed a left-foot drive inside the post on 16 minutes, but the Catalans turned the match on its head with three goals in an eight-minute spell before halftime. 

Roared on by a capacity 54,000 crowd, Atletico subjected Real to a storm of pressure in the opening minutes at the Calderon. 

Ivan Helguera almost succumbed to the tension when he wrong-footed keeper Casillas with a back pass, but fellow centre back Franciso Pavon scrambled the ball off the line. 

Atletico striker Fernando Torres skipped past Helguera in the next attack, but Casillas stood up well producing a top class block to stop the Spanish internationals shot. 

Real managed to hold firm and responded with a goal in their one and only attack of the first half. 

Roberto Carlos charged down the left flank and clipped the ball back across the area to the waiting Zinedine Zidane. The Frenchman miscued an attempted shot but the ball fell to Ronaldo who had time to pick his spot and fire into the top corner to put his side ahead in the 14th minute. 

It was Atletico who continued to dominate, however, and they proceeded to lay siege to the Real area in the final 15 minutes of the half. But Casillas produced a string of brilliant last-ditch saves to deny Torres and fellow strike partner Salva Ballesta making anything from a hatful of scoring chances. 

It was the same story in the second half as Atletico laid siege to the Real area and Casillas continued his brilliant solo rearguard action to frustrate the home side. 

But Real still managed to stretch their lead when Solari latched on to a sharp through-ball from Raul to round keeper Leo Franco and guide home into the open net nine minutes from time. Ronaldo made it three goals from three chances for Real when he produced another classy finish in their next attack as he drilled a low shot under Franco from the edge of the area after a great pass from Zidane. 

In Italy, Inter Milan scored three goals in the last seven minutes to seal an incredible 3-2 win over Sampdoria on Sunday and extend their unbeaten run to 18 Serie A games. 

Leaders Juventus beat Livorno 4-2 at the Delle Alpi stadium with two goals from Italy winger Mauro Camoranesi. Third-placed Udinese beat Cagliari 2-0, Paolo Di Canio?s rich vein of form continued with a goal in Lazio?s 3-2 win at Fiorentina, and Vincenzo Montella scored both AS Roma?s goals in their 2-1 victory over Atalanta. 

Fourth-placed Inter were trailing 0-2 to Sampdoria after goals from Max Tonetto and Belarussian Vitali Kutuzov. Roberto Mancini?s side then struck three times in six minutes through Nigerian Obafemi Martins, Christian Vieri and Uruguayan Alvaro Recoba whose superb winner came in the fourth minute of stoppage time. 

Many Inter fans had left the San Siro after Kutuzov?s goal in the 82nd minute and missed seeing their team turn the game around in the dying minutes. (Agencies)

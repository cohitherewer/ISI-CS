 Digvijay in joint lead

Beijing: Digvijay Singh moved into the halfway lead on the Asian Tour at the end of the second day of the $200,000 Crowne Plaza Open on Friday. 

Digvijay, who ended his first round this morning with two birdies in his last three holes, held sole lead at four-under 68 at the end of the first round. 

He carded a 72 in the second round, and was at four-under 140, sharing the lead with Thai Chapchai Nirat. Chapchai shot a 66, including a chip-in eagle and six birdies besides two bogeys. 

 Digvijay began his second round with birdies on second and third to go six-under. But then came a mid-round lapse as he bogeyed the ninth and the tenth. He steadied himself with eight straight pars that still kept him in the lead. 

Marcus Both (69) and Thaworn Wiratchant (72) shared third place at 141, while two other Thais, Prom Meesawat (71) and Prayad Marksaeng (70) shared fifth spot with Ecuadorian Rafael Ponce (68) at 142. 

Two other Indians, Rahil Gangjee (68) and Shiv Kapur (70), were tied for tenth at 144 with five others. Vivek Bhandari (73) made the cut at four-over 148, and was tied 48th. 

Uttam Singh Mundy (76) bogeyed his final hole, the ninth, but just made the cut on the line at seven-over 151. Gangjee moved up from tied 55th and Kapur from tied 24th after first round. 

Digvijay, who missed qualifying through the q-school this year, is currently 111th on the money list, but a win this week could take him inside top-60 and also earn him a two-year exemption. 

Digvijay led the 2003 Hero Honda Masters by two shots after three rounds, but collapsed with a final round 78 and ended tenth. He was also third at the Indian Open in 2002, when another Indian Vijay Kumar grabbed the title. 

Gurbaaz Mann, 13-over in first round, made a great improvement for a card of 73, but it was too late and he was way off at 14-over and 93rd place for two days. K. P. S. Sekhon added a 78 to his first round 79 and was eliminated in 90th place.

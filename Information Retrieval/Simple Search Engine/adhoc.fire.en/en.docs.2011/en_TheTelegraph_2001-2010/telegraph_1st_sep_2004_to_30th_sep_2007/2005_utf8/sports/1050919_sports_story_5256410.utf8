 Itll be tough for England, says Shoaib

London: Shoaib Akhtar has warned England to expect a tough and gruelling examination of their new-found confidence when they tour Pakistan next month. 

Michael Vaughans men are on a high after their historic Ashes triumph, but Shoaib believes England could be in for a rude awakening when confronted with vastly different playing conditions in Pakistan. 

The conditions are different, Shoaib told a radio network. 

Theyll find a different atmosphere, less bounce, good pitches for batting and its going to be hard work for the fast bowlers. 

Theyre going to have to rely on the reverse swing to get people out. I think its going to be a tough series. 

Shoaib congratulated England on their 2-1 Test triumph over Australia but insist they still have plenty to learn. 

England are the best team right now, he said. They have good guys around but Pakistan is different. 

Shoaib missed Englands last tour of Pakistan, when England clinched the series with a famous third Test victory in Karachi. But he has witness Englands recent triumphs at close hand. 

And he believes a first-choice Pakistan attack, including himself, Mohammed Sami and Abdul Razzaq, could cause England batting problems. We have the ability to swing the ball and destroy any team in a couple of spells, he added. (AFP)

 Bengal hopeful vs Tamil Nadu

Mumbai: Bengal hope to carry the momentum going when they face Tamil Nadu in the national one-dayer semi-final on Tuesday. 

Riding Devang Gandhi?s unbeaten 98 and Ranadeb Bose?s three for 33, Bengal thrashed Railways in the quarters, while Tamil Nadu got past Baroda by 30 runs. 

Devang, however, guarded against complacency and hoped his team would come up with another ?worthy performance? in the semis. (Agencies)

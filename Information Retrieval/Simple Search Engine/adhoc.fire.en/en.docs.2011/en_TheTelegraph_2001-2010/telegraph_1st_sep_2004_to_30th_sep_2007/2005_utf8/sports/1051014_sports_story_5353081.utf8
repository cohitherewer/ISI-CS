 Topalov needs 2 draws for title

 Anand beat Leko in the 12th round 

San Luis (Argentina): It looks implausible but the fortunes in the world chess championship can still change in the remaining two rounds. 

Bulgarian Veselin Topalov is set to annex the crown with 9 points in his kitty and now needs just two draws against Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Hungarian Judit Polgar. 

After the final rest day on Wednesday, Viswanathan Anand will have to tackle Alexander Morozevich of Russia in the 13th round effectively to retain some hopes of catching up with Topalov. 

It is a similar story for Russian Peter Svidler, too, who is on joint second spot along with Anand on 7.5 points. In the next round Svidler will meet Polgar before his showdown with Anand in the final round. 

Anand has scored five victories thus far with two losses coming against Kasimdzhanov and Morozevich in the first half. The Indian ace avenged his defeat against Kasimdzhanov two days back and would certainly like to settle scores with Morozevich too who is on sole fourth spot with 6 points in his bag. 

On Tuesday, Anand scored a thumping victory against Peter Leko of Hungary and caught Svidler on second spot after the 12th round. 

The victory helped Anand move closer to Topalov after the latter took a quick draw as white against Svidler. 

The other two games of the day also ended in draws with Adams of England signing peace with Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekisan and Russian Alexander Morozevich failing to breach the solid defences of Polgar. 

Theoretically, Anand can still catch up with Topalov but for that the Bulgarian must lose at least one of the last two games and draw the other while Anand will have to beat Morozevich and Svidler in the last two rounds.

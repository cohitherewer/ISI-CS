The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sania effort warms city hearts

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza may have lost her third-round match to Serena Williams at the Australian Open on Friday, but her spirited fight in the second set warmed most Indian hearts. The Telegraph spoke to three city-based ex-players who have served as Davis Cup captain or coach in the past. The following are their views on Sania?s performance: 

 AKHTAR ALI: She was too tight in the first 

 set and I don?t blame her for that. In the second set, Sania 

 played exceedingly well. Overall, I think she played good 

 tennis. We have definitely seen the birth of a new star. 

 It?s great for the women?s game in India. 

Sania hit the ball deep and hard. The difference was the big serve. That is one aspect she has to improve on. She also has to work on her movement and get physically stronger. Her first goal now should be to move into the top-100 so that she gets to play the higher-ranked players more often. 

JAIDIP MUKERJEA: Coming from a wild-card entrant ranked No. 166 in the world who was playing against someone of Serena Williams? calibre, it was a wonderful effort by Sania. She was a bit nervous in the first set, which is very normal. 

I remember playing Roy Emerson in the fourth round of the Australian Open in 1965. I was very conscious that I was playing on centre court and didn?t want to make a fool of myself. 

Sania must have been over-eager in the early stages of the match, which made her stiff. But she fought really well thereafter. In fact, the second set could have been anyone?s. This experience will give her loads of confidence for the future. But she will also have to work harder now. Everyone in India will expect her to win matches and tournaments, the pressure will be on her every time she steps on court. 

She has definitely developed as a player in the last 12 months or so. She looks very solid playing from the backcourt, but she needs to improve her serve and movement around the court. 

It?s difficult to say at this stage whether she can rise to the world?s top-20, but I think Sania should target the top-100 by the end of the year. 

Enrico Piperno: Had Sania 

 lost love and love, her two wins would have seemed like 

 a fluke. But the second set was ample proof that she can 

 compete with the best in business. 

She did remarkably well to come back from a disappointing first set. I thought the second game of the match was crucial. Sania had a game-point on her serve, went for a winner and just missed the line. It was a mixture of lack of experience and nervousness which resulted in the slow start. 

Sania should not take a break now. She should play 4-5 weeks in a row and try to get into the top-100. I think she has the potential to crack the world?s top-50.

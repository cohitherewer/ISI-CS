 Rupesh makes last eight 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rupesh Roy stormed into the quarter finals of the ITF junior grade II meet in Pretoria with two straight-set victories. 

According to information received here, the 16-year-old Indian ? who got a bye in the first round of the 64-player meet ? beat South African Tucker Vorster 6-3, 6-3 in the second round. Seventh-seeded Rupesh had it even easier in the next round as he dismissed Derek Drabble, another local boy, 6-1, 6-2. Rupesh will next meet Austrian Simon David. 

Ranked 183 in the world, Rupesh is hoping to pick up enough points in five tournaments in Africa to ensure a direct entry into the US Open boys event. 

Next week, Rupesh ? who has improved significantly since joining the Bosse Foundation in Boston four months ago ? will take part in another ITF grade II junior meet in Pretoria.

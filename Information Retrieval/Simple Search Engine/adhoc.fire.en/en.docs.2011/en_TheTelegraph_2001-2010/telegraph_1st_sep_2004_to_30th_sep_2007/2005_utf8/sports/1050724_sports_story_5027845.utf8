The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Thangaraj urges Bhutia to play for EB

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhutia at Barasat Stadium on Saturday 

Calcutta: The occasion was Peter Thangarajs benefit game, but once Bhaichung Bhutia made a belated entry into the choc-a-bloc Barasat Stadium arena, he hogged all the attention. 

The East Bengal fans, especially, made no bones about their wish, stretching their vocal chords and demanding their favourite striker sign for another season with the red-and-golds. The charismatic striker, it may be recalled, is leaving for a stint in Malaysia without having made up his mind on whether to renew his contract with East Bengal. 

Thangaraj judged the mood perfectly and urged Bhaichung to sign for East Bengal. I request Bhaichung to play for East Bengal. He is an Indian, why should he go and play for a Malaysian club? Let him play for any top club in our country, though my choice is East Bengal, Thangaraj said when asked to address the audience. 

Bhaichung, who handed over a cheque for Rs 3 lakh to Thangaraj, said he would be leaving for Delhi on Monday to get his visa done. Ive never said Id be playing for Mohun Bagan, have I? All Im saying is, let me come back from Malaysia and then Ill take a decision, Bhaichung said.

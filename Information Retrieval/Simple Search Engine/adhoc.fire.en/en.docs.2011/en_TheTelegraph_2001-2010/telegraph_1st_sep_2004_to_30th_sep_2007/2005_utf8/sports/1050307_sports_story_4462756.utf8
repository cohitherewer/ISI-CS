The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Team in dark over Shoaib

 - He can?t make a difference by not being around: Woolmer

Chandigarh: The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, 

Shaharyar Khan, may have spoken about the possibility of Shoaib Akhtar being available 

from the third (and final) Test onwards, but the team management is in the dark. 

The temperamental speedster is recovering from a hamstring injury and made himself unavailable for the Test squad some 24 hours before a fitness test. The Tests will be followed by six ODIs. 

?We haven?t heard anything... It?s news to us that 

Shoaib could join the squad,? a member of the team management told The Telegraph 

on Sunday evening. 

Another added: ?In any case, Shoaib has to prove he?s fit and, more important, must be willing to bond with the rest in all respects...? 

It?s no secret that Shoaib is deemed to have an ?attitude problem? and should mend his ways. In other words, he has to accept he isn?t bigger than the game. 

Incidentally, coach Bob Woolmer reacted rather sharply when a Mediaman sought his views (after nets in neighbouring Mohali) on Shoaib?s absence. 

?Look, he can?t make a difference by not being around... He?s a fine bowler, but I?d rather talk about the squad that?s here... The boys I?m currently working with,? Woolmer answered somewhat bitingly. 

Moving away from Shoaib, he expressed ?complete satisfaction? with Sunday afternoon?s workout. Clearly, after the weather-affected tour-opener in Dharamshala the sunshine came as manna from heaven. 

Woolmer, however, denied he was under pressure owing to Pakistan?s indifferent performances: ?A process is in place and I?m not only looking at immediate results... Of course, some pressure is there in a series involving Pakistan and India...? 

Smiling, he pointed out the squad had no fitness worries and, ?after quite a while,? everybody was available for selection. The first Test gets underway in Mohali on Tuesday. 

?We?ve got tough choices to make... In the circumstances, 

that?s not a bad thing,? Woolmer quipped.

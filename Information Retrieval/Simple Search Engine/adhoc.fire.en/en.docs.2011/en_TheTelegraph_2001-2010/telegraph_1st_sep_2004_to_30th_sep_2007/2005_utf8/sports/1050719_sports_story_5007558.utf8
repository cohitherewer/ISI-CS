 A dream come true: Tiger 

 - World No.1 was a picture of consistency, a testament to perseverance

 St Andrews: Once again, there was no stopping 

 Tiger Woods, not the pressure of a Sunday with a major championship 

 on the line, not a swirling wind, not the burden of history 

 and not the heat generated by those determined to chase 

 him down. 

The sky above the Old Course was as gray as the stone buildings that line Links Road as it hugs the length of the 18th fairway when Woods closed out his round of 2-under-par 70, winning the British Open for a second time and completing his second career Grand Slam. 

Its a dream come true, Woods said. 

Woods 10th major championship was a picture of consistency and a testament to perseverance. His rounds of 66-67-71-70 added up to a 14-under par total of 274, five shots ahead of Colin Montgomerie. 

Woods joined Jack Nicklaus as the only players to have won all four of the major championships at least twice, but at 29 Woods is younger than Nicklaus when he accomplished the feat at 31. 

Almost from the moment Woods set a goal as a youngster growing up in Californias Orange County, in Cypress, that he would break Nicklaus record of 18 major titles, it seems there was no other player with whom he could ever compare. So here is another: Nicklaus 10th major title was the 1972 Masters, which he won when he was 32. 

The only other player with 10 or more major titles is Walter Hagen, who had 11. In the end, Woods 10th will go down as one of his most serene. 

He drove par-four greens, but also found himself under gorse bushes and in bunkers. He took unplayable lies, but also hit flagsticks on the bounce. He established himself as the favourite, took on the best players in the game and slammed the door on them all. 

Its never a disgrace to lose to the best player of our generation by far, said Montgomerie, who pressed Woods for awhile, but was three over on the back and wound up with a 72. 

You have to beat Tiger. If he stays fit and healthy, he has 10 of these majors now and we all know Jack had 18 and hes over halfway now. Its amazing. Can he achieve the impossible? Hes on his way, and all credit to him. 

I hit the ball so solidly today. The golf ball was hit so flush all day, every shot. It was one of those rounds that I will be thinking about for a long time. Im very thankful it happened at the right time, said the champion. 

But it took awhile for Woods to turn the chase into a march of futility. Jose Maria Olazabal, who started the day only two shots behind Woods, closed to within one shot at the fourth hole, but Woods two-putt birdie at the 568-yard par-five fifth pushed the lead back to two. 

Montgomerie charged, much to the delight of his fans in his native country. And when Montgomerie birdied the ninth to reach 12 under, he trailed Woods by only one. 

The margin was two shots over Montgomerie and three over Olazabal after Woods drove the 352-yard green at the ninth, where he two-putted for a birdie. 

Woods seemed in trouble at the 10th when he missed on his attempt to reach the green on the 380-yard hole in two and instead landed in a bunker short of the green. He wound up three-putting for bogey from long distance, but caught a break when Montgomerie made bogey at the 11th immediately after failing to cash in with anything other than a par at the 10th. 

Everything changed at the 348-yard 12th, one of the holes lengthened and toughened this year in a so-called Tiger-proofing of the Old Course that added 164 yards. While Olazabal, paired with Woods, made bogey, Woods sank a four-footer for birdie. At the same time, playing a hole ahead, Montgomerie missed a six-foot putt for par. 

And that was that. Suddenly, Woods had a four-shot lead with six holes to go. 

After wriggling away from Montgomerie, there were no challenges. Fred Couples, who finished his round hours before Woods, shot a 68 and moved from a tie for 22nd and into a tie for third with Olazabal, who birdied the last hole for a 74. 

As Couples said, Woods was simply too good. 

Hes setting the bar so high and hes so strong. Hes always the guy to beat. 

And, once again, Woods seems to be picking up the intimidation factor. After Woods opened with his six-under round, Montgomerie said the players were already considering the possibility that they were all playing for second place. If it was prophecy, it might have been self-fulfilling, but none of that mattered to Woods. 

It was Woods fourth victory this year and the 44th of his career. His payday Sunday of $1,261,584 moves him to No. 1 on the PGA Tour money list with $6.6 million and also increased his career prize money to $ 51,744,610. 

And theres one more number to look at: Woods is 10 for 10 in majors when either leading after 54 holes or sharing the lead. He has never lost. Judging by the way he played for four days in July on the Old Course along St Andrews Bay, Woods looks like he might never.

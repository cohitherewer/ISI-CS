Calcutta: Jhuma Khatun is fast emerging as the states future in middle-distance running. A day after collecting the 1500m gold in girls under-18 with a new meet record, the Class XI girl from Nadia completed a double on Saturday, when she finished the 800m well ahead of her rivals. Her timing of 2:12.0 was a 0.02 second improvement of her own mark, created in the last edition. 

Five more new marks were established on the concluding day of the state championships at the Salt Lake Stadium ? Safina Khatun (girls U-18 heptathlon), Sharmila De (girls U-16 shot put), Tapasi Nandi (womens pole vault), Babli Mitra (girls U-20 pole vault) and Susmita Sinha Roy (womens high jump). 

Jhuma, who has been practising at the SAI for two years, said: The 800m gold is more satisfying since I want to concentrate on this discipline. 

Tarit Sinha Roy of Mohun Bagan and Dolly Sarkar of City AC were adjudged the mens and womens individual champions. The overall team titles went to Mohammedan Sporting (men) and Eastern Railway (women).

 Its all about creating pressure: Murali

 - Vital to get as close to Indias total as possible

 Rahul Dravid congratulates Irfan Pathan after the dismissal of Avishka Gunawardene in New Delhi on Sunday 

New Delhi: Steve Waugh once described Muttiah Muralidharan as a rubber-wristed illusionist. The Kotla was witness to that doosra side of the legendary off-spinner on the second day of the ongoing second Test. In a magical spell on Sunday, he triggered a dramatic collapse of Team India ? from 245 for three to 290 all out. 

He returned figures of 38.4-8-100-7 in the first innings and five of them came on Sunday. Anil Kumble, however, brought the hosts back in contention, reducing Sri Lanka for 198 for six. 

Jawagal Srinath was, however, all praise for the Sri Lankan. 

A great bowler doesnt need the assistance of a pitch to show his worth. Magical could be the word to describe the way he bound the Indian batsmen in his spell today, the former India quick said. 

Muralidharan, meanwhile, felt that the match is evenly poised and the team batting better in their second innings would eventually call the shots. 

It still looks like a batting pitch. I think its vital to get as close to Indias total as possible. Whichever team bats better in the final innings will win the match, the champion bowler said . 

He attributed his success in the morning to putting pressure on the batsmen and making them think about what they were going to face next. 

Its all about how you are creating pressure and forcing the batsmen to think of you. Once we dismissed Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar, it was difficult for a new batsman to come in and stay there for a few overs, Muralidharan told reporters during the press conference. 

He also revealed that his plans on Saturday didnt prosper because Sachin (Tendulkar) was playing well. 

Is he seeing any change in the Sri Lanka team between the ODI series and the current one? One-day match is all about entertainment. If you lose confidence, you just keep losing it. But in Tests, you have a chance to fight back, was Muralidharans reply. 

 Sehwag improving 

Virender Sehwag is recovering fast and should be fit to play the third Test, starting in Ahmedabad on December 18. 

Hes still on medication, but hes improving fast. Hes in constant touch with the team and were all hopeful that he will play in Ahmedabad, media manager Wng Cdr M. Baladitya said on Sunday. 

Incidentally, Sehwag went to see the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Maharashtra and spent a good deal of time with his teammates. The dashing opener may also join Team India in the dressing room at the Kotla on Monday. 

Meanwhile, DDCA will felicitate Sachin Tendulkar on his 35th century here. Well felicitate him on final day and itll be a surprise, president Arun Jaitley said.

 Milan cruise to 2-0 win

 Michele Canini and AC Milans Kaka find their paths blocked by Cagliari goalkeeper Hector Fabian Carini during their Serie A match on Sunday 

Rome: AC Milan kept up their pursuit of Serie A leaders Juventus when they cruised to a 2-0 win at Cagliari on Sunday. 

The result lifted Milan to second place on 16 points from seven matches, five points behind Juventus, who maintained their 100 per cent winning start to the season by beating Messina 1-0 on Saturday. 

Milans city rivals Inter also enjoyed an easy victory, crushing Livorno 5-0 at the San Siro stadium to climb to third on 15 points. 

The game was less than 30 seconds old at Cagliari when Milan striker Alberto Gilardino wriggled free of three defenders and poked the ball past keeper Fabian Carini. 

For a time it seemed that the home side might strike back but in the 27th minute Andriy Shevchenko effectively ended the contest, unleashing a left-footed shot that dipped underneath Carinis outstretched arms and into the bottom corner. 

Meanwhile in Spain, Osasuna joined Real Madrid at the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday after second half strikes from Savo Milosevic and Pierre Webo secured the Navarrans a 2-0 win at home to Celta Vigo. 

Former leaders Getafe lost their unbeaten record when they went down 0-1 at Real Betis.

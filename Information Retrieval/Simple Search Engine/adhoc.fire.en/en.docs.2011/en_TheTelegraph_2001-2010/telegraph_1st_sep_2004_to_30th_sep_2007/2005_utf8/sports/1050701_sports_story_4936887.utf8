The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India must move up a rung or qualify

London: India could be forced to play the qualifying round of the ICC Champions Trophy to be held in the country next year if they fail to improve their current ODI standing. 

The 2003 World Cup runners-up are at present in seventh spot in the ICC ODI championship table and will at least have to move one position higher by April 1, 2006 if they want a direct entry in the event, after the board of ICC Development (International) Ltd approved a new format for the championship at its meeting in Dublin Wednesday. 

According to the new format, top six sides of the ICC ODI championship table as on April 1, 2006 will get direct entry, while the next four Test playing nations will have to play a round-robin qualifying for the remaining two spots. 

The eight teams will then be split into two groups of four each with the top two teams from each group qualifying for the semi-finals, the ICC said in a release here Thursday. 

The initial qualifying round will take place in India, immediately preceding the group stage, the release added. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said the new format will be highly competitive for all the participating teams. 

The IDI board is of the view that the new format has addressed the main flaws of the previous 12-team system and we now look forward to an exciting major international event in India, Speed was quoted as saying in the release.

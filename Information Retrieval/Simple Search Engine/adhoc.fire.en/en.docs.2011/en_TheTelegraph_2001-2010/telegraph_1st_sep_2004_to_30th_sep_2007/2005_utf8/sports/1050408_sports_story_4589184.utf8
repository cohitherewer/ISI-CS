 Daniel wins 4, needs one to level with Vijay 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Daniel David saddled four winners on Thursday and his fellow-professional Vijay Singh drew a blank again. Trainers? championship, therefore, has reached fever-pitch with Daniel needing just one more win to draw level with Vijay at the top, on Wednesday, the concluding day of the season.

 Jockey Imran Chisty?s contribution to Daniel?s cause was ample. Three of the four winners he booted home, on the day, hailed from Daniel?s stable. He also helped trainer Errol Bhungard win a race. However, what the Daniel-Chisty combination missed out was the prime event, the Mysore Race Club Cup when their Steinlen failed to have the measure of the Dipak Karki-trainee Sea Legend, ridden by Md Islam. The winner led from the start and held on to win.

 The afternoon was, otherwise, ruled by the course-favourites.

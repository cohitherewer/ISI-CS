 Thanou confident of being cleared

 Katerina Thanou 

Athens: After testifying to a magistrate on Monday, Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou said she was confident she would be acquitted of avoiding a doping test on the eve of the Athens Olympic Games and faking a motorbike accident on the same day. 

Thanou, fellow sprinter Costas Kenteris and their coach at the time, Christos Tzekos, face charges of deliberately missing three doping tests and faking the accident that sent them to hospital for four days. 

?I am now going back to work which is training,? a smiling Thanou told reporters after her appearance. 

Kenteris, who won the 200 m gold medal at the 2000 Olympics, and Thanou, a 100 m silver medallist at the same Games, were initially cleared of wrongdoing by a Greek athletics commission in March in a shock decision that infuriated the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the World Anti-Doping Agency. 

The sprinters, who caused the biggest athletics scandal since 100 m gold medallist Ben Johnson tested positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul Games, had voluntarily withdrawn from the Games amid a whirlwind of publicity, to avoid heaping further embarrassment on the host nation. 

?Everything is good and I am very satisfied with the way things are going,? said a smiling Thanou, a Greek Air Force officer who was dressed in a civilian business suit. 

?I have submitted my evidence and I am confident.? 

They are still banned from competing, pending an IAAF appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). If found guilty they face a two-year ban. 

Thanou said she was confident the IAAF appeal would also fail. ?We have to take one step at a time. Next is the Lausanne (CAS) case. I am optimistic and feel good.? 

Kenteris is also due to appear before the magistrate in the coming weeks. 

Tzekos, who has been banned by the Greek athletics commission for four years for his involvement in the case, said he and his athletes are innocent and were not aware of new anti-doping procedures for last year?s Athens Olympics.

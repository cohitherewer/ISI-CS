 Woods battles to even par

 - US OPEN 

 Browne, Mediate set early pace 

 Tiger Woods tees off on the 14th in Pinehurst on Thursday, Day I of the US Open 

Pinehurst: Twice winner Tiger Woods battled to an even-par 70 as American qualifiers Olin Browne and Rocco Mediate set the early pace in the US Open first round on Thursday. 

US Masters champion Woods, despite looking a little out-of-sorts and struggling for accuracy off the tee, offset two bogeys with two birdies in difficult conditions at Pinehursts No. 2 Course. 

That left him three adrift of Browne and Mediate, who fired matching 67s in bright and breezy morning conditions. 

Defending champion Retief Goosen and British Ryder Cup player Lee Westwood were a further stroke back while South Koreas K.J. Choi, who holed a 35-foot eagle putt at the fourth, was among a group of three on 69. 

World No. 3 Ernie Els carded an opening 71.

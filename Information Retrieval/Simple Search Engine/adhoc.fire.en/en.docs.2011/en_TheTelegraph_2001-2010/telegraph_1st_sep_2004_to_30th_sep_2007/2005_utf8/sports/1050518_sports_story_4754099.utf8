 Haynes visa confusion

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Theres confusion over Desmond Haynes arrival in India for Thursdays interview. The former West Indian opener is one of four candidates for the Team India coachs job to be interviewed by a six-member panel in Delhi. 

When Haynes had accepted the invitation last week, he had said he will get the visa done on his own. 

Last night, however, he got in touch with the BCCI to say that he cant organise the visa in Barbados, and whether it can be arranged on arrival in India. 

The BCCI sounded out the external affairs ministry on Tuesday only to be told that the best they can do is expedite the visa anywhere in the West Indies, while the visa on arrival can be cleared only by the home ministry. 

The home ministry will be approached first thing on Wednesday. But because of the time difference, it will be difficult for Haynes to make it to India in time for the interview.

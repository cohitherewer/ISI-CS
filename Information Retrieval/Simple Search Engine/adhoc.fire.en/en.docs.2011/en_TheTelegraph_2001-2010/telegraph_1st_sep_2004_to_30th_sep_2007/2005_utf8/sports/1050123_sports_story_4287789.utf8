Christchurch: Stephen Fleming smashed a century off 54 balls to steer New Zealand to a nine-wicket win over a makeshift World XI in the first of three tsunami fundraisers at the Jade Stadium on Saturday. The matches do not have official status. 

The New Zealand skipper skipper belted 10 fours and nine sixes in a brutal display of hitting, helping New Zealand pass World XI?s total of 158 in just 16.1 overs. 

Fleming was particularly severe on the World XI?s twin spin attractions, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan, who bowled in tandem in an international match for the first time. Muralidharan conceded 57 runs from 3.1 overs and Warne, who captained the world side, went for 26 from three overs. 

Fleming reached his half century with a six off Muralidharan ? among three sixes and 22 runs he took in the 11th over ? and reached his century with a four off the same bowler. 

?In 15 years of playing international or first-class cricket, I don?t think I?ve seen anyone hit the ball like that,? said Warne who went for 26 in his three overs. ?Occasionally Brian Lara or Sachin Tendulkar when they?ve got to about 100, but that was just unbelievable.? 

Fleming?s century would have been the fourth fastest in one-day history had the match been given official status. 

Fleming reached 44 in the first 34 balls he faced, before exploding as Muralidharan was introduced into the attack. ?It was my day and I had some fun,? Fleming said. ?The game was over when Murali came on to bowl, so it was a tough ask for him.? 

The match was effectively over after the World XI, made up of past and present international players, crumbled to be all out for 158 in the 40th over. 

Former England former Test batsman Graeme Hick top-scored with 44 and retired South African star Jonty Rhodes chipped in with 36 but the total was too small. 

Fleming, opening the batting, made 106 before being dismissed just short of the target, leaving Nathan Astle (36 not out) and Chris Cairns (eight not out) to complete the win 

The match also saw the return to international cricket of allrounder Jeff Wilson, who made his first appearance for New Zealand since his debut as a teenager 12 years ago. Wilson, who put cricket on hold to shape a famous career in international rugby, took one for 27 from seven overs. The New Zealand government pledged $14 per run scored in the three-match series, $695 for every four and $3,475 for every six to Asian tsunami relief operations. 

On that basis, Fleming?s innings alone generated more than $34,750 for tsunami victims. Organisers said they raised more than NZ$500,000 (US$350,000) from Saturday?s opening match and hoped to take the total past $1 million after matches in Wellington and Hamilton.

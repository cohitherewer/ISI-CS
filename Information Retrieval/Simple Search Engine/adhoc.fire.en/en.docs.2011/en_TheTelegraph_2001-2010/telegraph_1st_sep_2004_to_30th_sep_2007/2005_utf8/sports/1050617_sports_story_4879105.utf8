Peshawar: India lived dangerously in the final minutes but hung on to a solitary goal by subsitute Abdul Hakim to beat Pakistan 1-0 in the second match of series here Thursday night. 

After failing to capitalise on two certain goal-scoring opportunities in the second half, an unmarked Hakim, in the 67th minute, headed an exquisitely timed cross from almost a negative angle by skipper Shanmugam Venkatesh to score the winner. 

The win also put India 1-0 ahead in the three-match series after both the teams split honours in the first game in Quetta. 

India should have doubled the lead eight minutes later but Surajit Bose was controversially declared off-side after Sunil Chettri found the net. 

Pakistan retaliated through Mohammad Essa and Arif Mahmood, and launched a series of counter attacks in the final minutes. But the Indian defenders held their nerves and thwarted all the attempts to successfully defend the slender lead. 

Both teams had entered the field promising to put up a more exciting performance. But both the teams struggled for ball possession in the mid-field in the first half. 

There were a few individual efforts but not a single planned move was produced by either team. 

India got the first real opportunity immediately in the second half when a scramble in the box provided an energetic Climax Lawrence an opportunity that was wasted when he kicked the ball wide. 

A little later, Jaffar Khan failed to gather an easy lob but Venkatesh could not deliver the killer blow. 

However, Venkatesh soon made amends when his solo run from the left drew the entire Pakistan defence that left Hakeem unmarked who made full use of the opportunity. 

Indias victory in Peshawar sets up an exciting finale in Lahore on Saturday evening.

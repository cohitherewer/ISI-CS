 Dempo lose 0-1

Margao: A second-half strike by substitute Hassan Maatouk helped Lebanese club Al-Ahed beat Dempo by a solitary goal in a group B match of the AFC Cup on Wednesday. 

Al-Ahed scored the all-important goal in the 72nd minute when Maatouk got the better of defender Raju Singh inside the box and beat keeper Abhijit Mondal. 

Al-Ahed could have easily won by a bigger margin had they not missed at least three clear chances. 

Dempo also had their chances to score but keeper Biilal Hachem made good saves and denied Ranty Martins and Clifford from scoring. 

The win took Al-Ahed tally to six points from three matches and has brightened their chances of qualifying for the next round as the second best team with a match in hand against table-topper Al Hussein, who have 9 points from all wins. 

Dempo finished their league engagements losing all four matches. (PTI)

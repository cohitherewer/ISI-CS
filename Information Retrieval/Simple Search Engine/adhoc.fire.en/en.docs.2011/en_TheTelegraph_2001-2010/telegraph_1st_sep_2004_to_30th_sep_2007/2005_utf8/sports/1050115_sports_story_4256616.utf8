Athens: Diego Maradona praised Greece?s surprise Euro 2004 win calling it a miracle that ?is good for football?. 

The Argentine legend arrived in Athens on a mystery trip early Thursday but has remained out of sight for more than 24 hours. He spoke briefly at the airport before being rushed off to a central Athens hotel he has since not left. 

?Greece beat everyone. It was a miracle... It is good for football when small teams do so well. They shake things up,? Maradona said. 

Wearing a blue jacket and jeans and sporting long hair and a moustache, Maradona cut his drug rehabilitation in Cuba short to fly to Athens.

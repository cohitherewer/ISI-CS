London: Swede Fredrik Ljungberg scored an early goal to earn Arsenal a 1-0 win at 10-man Bolton Wanderers in a rugged FA Cup quarter final on Saturday. 

Bolton?s Senegal striker El-Hadji Diouf was sent off for elbowing Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the ninth minute at the Reebok Stadium, shortly after Arsenal had taken the lead. 

Ljungberg ran on to a pass from fellow midfielder Robert Pires in the third minute and dinked the ball coolly over goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen from the edge of the area. 

The victory kept alive Arsenal?s hopes of winning a trophy this season following their Champions League exit at the hands of Bayern Munich. 

Bolton beat Arsenal 1-0 in January, one of only four Premier League defeats suffered by the champions this season but their chances of a repetition were severely reduced when Diouf was shown the red card. 

As referee Steve Bennett dealt with Bolton protests over a penalty claim for a foul on striker Kevin Davies, Diouf swung an arm at Lehmann and caught the German above the eye with his elbow. 

Arsenal dominated possession in the second half, making their numerical advantage count to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the fifth year in a row.

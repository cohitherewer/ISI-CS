 Asian stars step into major mode 

St Andrews: Star-struck but not overawed. Asias top players stepped into major mode as they prepared to take on Tiger Woods and other top players of the world at the British Open starting on Thursday. 

Thailands Thongchai Jaidee, last seasons Asian Tour No. 1, leads the regions challenge with each member of the contingent bent on making an impression at the worlds oldest major. 

For countryman Thammanoon Srirot, his major debut gives him the rare opportunity to lay to rest the ghosts of 2002.Three years ago, the 36-year-old stumbled to a calamitous 87 on the Old Course during the Dunhill Links Championship. 

I shot a one-over on the front nine and took 50 on the back nine. I hit it out of bounds twice on the 10th hole, and ran up a big number. So Im looking to play this hole well, in particular, this week, he said. 

But since arriving here on Sunday, Thammanoon admitted that he was feeling unusually nervous. 

Im feeling uneasy, said the Thai, a five-time winner on the Asian Tour. Its a big occasion. My game feels alright now but I know its going to be a challenge. 

Danny Chia of Malaysia and Singapores Mardan Mamat have been star-struck since setting up camp near the home of golf last weekend. 

It is exciting to be here. When I stood on the first tee on Sunday morning for my first practice round, I said to myself Finally, Im at the home of golf, said Mardan, who played at Royal Troon in 1997 but missed the halfway cut. 

Australian Richard Moir and Englands Simon Dyson, the 2000 Asian No. 1, are also in the elite field this week. Koreas Choi Kyung-ju, Hur Suk-ho and Yang Yong-eun will also vie for honours along with former Asian Tour regulars Ted Purdy of the US and Daniel Chopra of Sweden. 

Meanwhile, the Royal and Ancient said on Wednesday that play will be halted on Thursday so that players and fans can observe a two-minute silence for those killed in last weeks London bombings. A klaxon will be sounded at midday local time and play will be suspended as part of a nation-wide tribute. (PTI)

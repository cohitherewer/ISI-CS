Youve won it once. Now go out there and win it again. The words of Alf Ramsey to his players at the end of normal time in the 1966 World Cup final and England went out and did just that. These are the best words we can offer the England cricket team, who could only draw with Australia Monday on a day of fierce and terrible drama. 

England took nine wickets, and nine wickets were not enough. England knocked Australia down and jumped up and down on them all day but they just couldnt finish them off. It came down to the last pair in with 24 balls to face. Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath, the fast bowlers, were bloody-minded enough to complete the job. That leaves the series hideously balanced at one match each with two to play, the next at Trent Bridge starting on August 25. 

Thus England reached out and seized victory with both hands but like the soap in the shower it slipped from their grasp. England won just about every session in this match but the killing bite eluded them. 

Everything they did was right, everything was good, every man did his part. But, and by the tiniest possible margin, it was not enough. 

The greatest obstacle in the way was the Australia captain, Ricky Ponting. His leadership has been in question and there have been hints of disgruntlement if not outright mutiny among the Australia side, but Monday he batted for most of the day, scored 156 runs, and has rehabilitated himself, not least in his own eyes. This is not the best possible news for England. 

For them, the consolations of nearly but not quite. They took the attack to Australia from the outset, and played with power and purpose. It was a day in search of heroes and Andrew Flintoff did his damnedest to fill the need. He bowled in a frenzy of desire and was Englands top wicket-taker with four. But as the overs ticked down and he came on for one final blast, that all-important fifth refused to come to him. 

The only thing that went wrong for England was Saturday and most of what went on that day was rain. Without that they would certainly have won. And without Shane Warnes resistance and a couple of missed chances that day, they would have won that day as well. Great matches, great series are decided by the tiniest of things, and there is no mistaking the truth of it ? this was a great match, and it came in the middle of a great series. 

Monday was always going to be a day of hard and bitter agony. England are playing this series the Tim Henman way: nothing is easy. Whatever way leads most directly to national angst, that is the way the team chooses. We grew used to the agonies of disappointment as England played Australia in the past all-but-two decades. It is becoming increasingly clear that the agonies of hope are still harder to deal with. And there are more and greater agonies to come. 

Throughout the long day, hope died and was born again at teasingly irregular intervals. At more than one point it even seemed that Australia might do the insanely impossible and win the damn thing. 

But then another wicket would fall and the phoenix hope would fly up fully formed once again. 

The break till the next Test is more to Australias advantage. They have a much-needed chance to re-group, while gloating over their narrow escape. It is up to England to stay exactly as they are and to win it all over again.

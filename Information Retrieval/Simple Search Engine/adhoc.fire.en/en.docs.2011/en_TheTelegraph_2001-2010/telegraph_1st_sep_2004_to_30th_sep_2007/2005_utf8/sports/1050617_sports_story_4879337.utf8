The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Defeats make Aussies cautious

 - ASHES SERIES

 I am pretty embarrassed... We shall talk about it: Ponting 

 Buchanan and Ponting must be thinking of a different strategy 

London: England fans know better than to get too excited about Australian slip-ups but consecutive defeats for the tourists have fuelled cautious optimism that the destination of the Ashes may not be a foregone conclusion. 

Australia followed their Twenty20 drubbing by England on Monday with a four-wicket defeat at the hands of Somerset in a one-day match in Taunton on Wednesday. 

To lose one match in a shortened version of the game can be dismissed as a bit of fun, but to lose two in three days is a trend Australia captain Ricky Ponting will be looking to stamp out quickly. 

I am pretty embarrassed, Ponting said after Wednesdays defeat. We shall sit down and talk about why we were not able to defend a total of 342. 

We werent smart enough or good enough. Well have our work cut out against Bangladesh on Saturday the way we are playing. 

We could have got more than 340, but I was angry with the second part of the game. 

We werent good enough to change our plan. The ball was just in the hitting zone all the time. 

We gave them 20 or 30 extra runs in the field. I dropped a catch and missed a run-out. We pride ourselves on saving 20 or 30 runs a game so that is a big turnaround. 

Somersets only previous victory against Australia came in a three-day match in 1977, when the tourists went on to lose the Ashes series. 

Against such portents, however, the world champion Aussies can take comfort from their eight consecutive Ashes series victories and wins in 14 of the last 15 one-day internationals against England. 

The tourists should get back to winning ways in that triangular series match against Bangladesh in Cardiff on Saturday but the true test will come against England in Bristol the following day. 

Shane Warne, Australias greatest Test wicket taker, thinks England fans should not get too carried away. 

Enjoy it while you can, the leg-spinner wrote in a newspaper column on Wednesday. 

We have the odd session where things do not go our way, and we lose occasionally. 

We are not perfect and know we never will be. Over a period of time we win more times than we lose. It will take a big effort by England to change that. 

If England can keep up the momentum, intensity and pressure of Monday through the coming weeks then a couple of great series lie ahead, in one-day and five-day cricket. 

If they dont, Australia will maul them and overhaul them. (Reuters)

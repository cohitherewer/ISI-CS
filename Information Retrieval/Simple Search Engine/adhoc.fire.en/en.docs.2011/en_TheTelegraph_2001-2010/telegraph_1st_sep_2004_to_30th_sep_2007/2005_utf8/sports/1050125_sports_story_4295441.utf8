Chittagong: Captain Tatenda Taibu and Barney Rogers struck half-centuries to lead Zimbabwe to a 31-run victory over Bangladesh in the second one-day International on Monday. 

Taibu was unbeaten on 64 and opener Rogers made 66 to lift Zimbabwe to 237 for five in their 50 overs after they had struggled to 99 for four. 

Bangladesh were dismissed for 206 despite a 90-run stand between Nafis Iqbal (58) and captain Habibul Bashar, leaving Zimbabwe 2-0 up in the five-match series. 

Rogers followed up his batting with the wickets of Manjural Islam Rana (16) and Khaled Mahmud (one). 

Bangladesh lost opener Rajin Saleh for six and Aftab Ahmed (15) soon followed. 

The third-wicket stand between Iqbal and Bashar (44) took Bangladesh to 130 but the pair were dismissed in successive deliveries. 

Enamul Haq (junior) was then run out for nought to end the match, leaving Khaled Mashud unbeaten on 23. 

Zimbabwe made a poor start after choosing to bat, losing Stuart Matsikenyeri to the first ball of their innings when he was run out by Aftab Ahmed. 

Rogers put on 86 with Dion Ebrahim before the latter was caught by Haq, making his one-day debut, off spinner Khaled Mahmud for 26. 

The wickets of Hamilton Masakadza, Haq?s first one-day scalp when he was stumped by wicketkeeper Mashud, and Rogers quickly followed to leave Zimbabwe in trouble at 99 for four. 

Brendan Taylor made 31 but it was the unbeaten sixth-wicket partnership of 84 between Taibu and Elton Chigumbura (30) that lifted Zimbabwe to a respectable total.

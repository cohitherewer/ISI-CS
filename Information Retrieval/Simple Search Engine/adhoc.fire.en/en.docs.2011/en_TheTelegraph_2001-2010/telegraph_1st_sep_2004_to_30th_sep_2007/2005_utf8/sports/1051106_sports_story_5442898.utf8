The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav feedback taken by Board

 - Contracts issue Two review panel members meet four seniors 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The senior national selectors (and coach Greg Chappell) have exiled Sourav Ganguly, but the Board hasnt exactly forgotten him. 

Specifically, acting executive secretary Prof. Ratnakar Shetty spoke to the former Team India captain for around 20 minutes at the CCI (in Mumbai) on Friday night, ahead of the contracts-related meeting with four seniors in Ahmedabad. 

Prof. Shetty and joint-secretary Goutam Das Gupta, who are on the three-man review panel, met captain Rahul Dravid, vice-captain Virender Sehwag, senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar and Harbhajan Singh for an hour at the team hotel late on Saturday morning. 

Treasurer Jyoti Bajpai didnt make the trip from Kanpur owing to an illness in the family. 

The panel will report to the four-member gradation committee, empowered to offer contracts for 2005-06. A maximum of 20 players can benefit ? when introduced last year, contracts were given to 17. 

Besides the Board president, the committee has seats for the secretary, the Team India coach and chairman of the senior selection committee. 

Strictly technically, the 2004-05 contracts lapsed on September 30. 

Sourav isnt in the team, but remains an important player. Moreover, he was the captain when contracts were introduced? I felt I should get his views as well, Prof. Shetty, who has been a manager more than once, told The Telegraph. 

He also talked to the Bangalore-based Anil Kumble, on the telephone, to get the injured leggies feedback on the first year. 

Kumble (representing the players) and Prof. Shetty had done much of the spadework once a dialogue was initiated in May 2001 by the then Board president, Dr A.C. Muthiah. 

Both Sourav and Kumble, it seems, said they were satisfied with the way the contracts-script had unfolded. 

Apparently, that was the opinion expressed by the seniors, too, when they interacted with the two panel members. 

However, they made at least two points: The quarterly payment of the retainership (in three categories ? Rs 50 lakh, Rs 35 lakh and Rs 20 lakh) must be on time and the Board should offer contracts even after the process has been completed if players from outside the fold are consistently good over a period of time. 

A case in point being Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who made a terrific impression back in April itself, when he lashed 148 against Pakistan in Vizag. 

He remained without a contract. Now, of course, a handsome grade awaits him. 

The panel, one understands, sought a clarification on the exclusive tie-ups entered into by some players with certain TV channels and publications. 

The seniors pointed out that players from other teams did likewise and that nobodys comments would harm Indian cricket. 

Basically, there was an agreement on staying disciplined. 

Dravid, it seems, led from the front even behind closed doors and is obviously comfortable in crickets hottest seat.

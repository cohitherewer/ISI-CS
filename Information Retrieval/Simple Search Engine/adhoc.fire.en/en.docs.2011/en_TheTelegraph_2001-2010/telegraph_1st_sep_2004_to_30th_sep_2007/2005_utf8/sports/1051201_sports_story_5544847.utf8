 Mourinho giving Dr Crespos sick notes short shrift

 - The Argentine has a habit of making life difficult for himself

 For all his foibles, Hernan Crespo is Chelseas most natural goalscorer 

Hernan Crespos position at Chelsea is under fresh scrutiny after the Argentina striker ignored the clubs diagnosis and demanded an X-ray after picking up a rib injury against Portsmouth on Saturday. Jose Mourinho has said all of his players must be tough guys, as he recently described Damien Duff, so he is unlikely to be impressed by Crespos decision. 

Crespo has an unfortunate habit of making life difficult for himself. After working his way back into the managers good books by scoring three goals in as many matches, he has jeopardised his improved standing by making a meal out of what is said to be a minor injury. 

The forward was elbowed in the ribs after scoring the opening goal in Saturdays 2-0 win at Fratton Park and immediately hobbled to the sidelines, with sympathy from the bench conspicuous by its absence. With only Carlton Cole to call upon, Mourinho instructed the 30-year-old to pull himself together and carry on, but, after limping around ineffectually for several minutes, he was eventually replaced by the England under-21 striker. One teammate observed that he had never seen a player limping after suffering a knock in the ribs. 

On closer examination, Crespos complaint was dismissed as light bruising by Chelseas medical team, but the player compounded his perceived lack of courage by insisting he had fractured a rib and demanded an X-ray. Although many of Chelseas medical staff were not impressed, his teammates saw the funny side, with several wags at Stamford Bridge referring to him as Dr Crespo. 

After eventually accepting the clubs diagnosis, Crespo returned to training Tuesday and is expected to be fit for Saturdays Premiership match against Middlesbrough, but his actions have not done much for his fragile relationship with Mourinho. 

It is not the first time Crespos commitment has been questioned. One of Mourinhos first acts as Chelsea manager was to send the player to AC Milan on loan after he missed a breakfast meeting on the second day of pre-season training last year and they clashed this month after the player refused to travel to a Champions League match against Real Betis, but the manager is unlikely to force him out again. 

For all his foibles, Crespo is the most natural goalscorer at the club, possessing finishing skills and a range of movement no one else can rival, and with little time to find a replacement during the January transfer window, he is expected to stay until at least the summer. 

Mourinho, though, does have concerns at the increasing culture clash at Chelsea between players prepared to play through injuries and those who are not. Frank Lampard and John Terry put off operations towards the end of last season as the club chased the championship and Duff recovered from a knee operation in three weeks this autumn, but Crespo and Arjen Robben are not willing to put their bodies on the line.

 India fail to get direct entry 

Chennai: A poor display of defence and service reception denied India a direct entry in the 2006 Japan World Championship as they lost to China 23-25, 21-25, 21-25 in the final round robin league match of the qualifying event on Sunday. 

However, India, by finishing second in the points table among the four teams in the first leg of the qualifying phase, which ended on Sunday, has another chance of making it to the world stage in the second leg, starting here from July 1. 

Korea and Australia, besides India, will figure in the second leg. The top two finishers will join hosts Japan, Kazakhstan, Iran and China (already qualified) in the World Championship, scheduled to be held in Japan in July-Aug next year. 

Earlier, in an inconsequential match, Indonesia defeated Thailand to register their first win at 25-18, 25-21, 25-12.

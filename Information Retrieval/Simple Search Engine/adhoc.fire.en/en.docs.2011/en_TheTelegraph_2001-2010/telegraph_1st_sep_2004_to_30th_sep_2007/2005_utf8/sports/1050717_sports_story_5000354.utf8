 Liverpool shy of Owen

Michael Owens hopes of a return to Liverpool, less than 12 months after swapping Merseyside for Real Madrid, appeared to be dwindling Friday, despite senior Anfield figures being made aware of the England forwards desire to head back to the Premiership. 

Owen, who left Liverpool in an ?8 million transfer to the Bernabeu last August, is understood to be considering his future in Spain due to growing uncertainty surrounding his position at the club and a fear of a lack of first-team football ahead of next summers World Cup finals in Germany. 

Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has already identified the Southampton and England forward Peter Crouch as his No. 1 attacking target and, with Owens style as far removed from Crouchs as could possibly be imagined, the Spaniard is unlikely to rip up his plans in order to resign a player he was happy to sell just 11 months ago. 

Chelsea and Manchester United would both be keen to sign Englands leading striker, while Newcastle United would move to snap up Owen as a replacement for Alan Shearer, who is retiring at the end of the coming season. 

However Friday, as Newcastle were preparing for their Inter toto Cup match in Slovakia with Dubnica Sunday, it emerged that Nicolas Anelka had also become a transfer target for the club despite only joining Turkish champions Fenerbahce in January.

 Salgaocar ride Andrade brace 

 Sangram was confident under the Salgaocar bar 

Margao: Francis Andrades double strike guided Salgaocar to a hard fought 3-1 victory over spirited Vasco Sports Club and helped them enter the Federation Cup semi-finals on Tuesday. 

After Vascos Rovan Pereira equalled Andrades early strike in the first half, the match went into extra time in which Salgaocar scored two goals through Samson Singh and Andrade. 

Salgaocar will now take on Sporting Clube de Goa in the semi-final to be played on Thursday. 

Both the teams played an attacking game as the ball rolled from one end to the other. Salgaocar capitalised on an error by referee Walter Pereira to move ahead in the 11th minute. Pereira awarded a penalty when Vasco defender Nicholas Colaco unintentionally handled the ball off a shot from Jerose Oliveira. 

In the resultant spot-kick, Andrade beat goalie Milagrio Medeira to his left off a left footer. Vasco, who put up a gritty performance in their win against Mohun Bagan, did not lose hope as they attacked the rival goal with series of raids and equalised in the 23rd minute. 

Denis Cabral, Vascos live wire from the right, set Anthony Fernandes inside the box. 

The latter took a crack at the goal which goalie Sangram Mukherjee managed to block but the deflection fell on the path of Rovan Pereira who slammed the ball in. The second-half was fought on even terms and both the teams missed scoring chances. 

Salgaocar scored in the fourth minute of the extra time when Samson converted a through pass from the right by Rochus Lamare who raced into the box and uncorked a right footer which deflected keeper Medeira and went in. 

Salgaocar then sealed Vascos fate when Andrade scored in the 17th minute of the extra time after referee again gave penalty when Caitan Costa brought down Samson inside the box.

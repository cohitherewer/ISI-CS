 Aussies to face India sans Molik 

Sydney: Australia will play their Fed Cup qualifying matches against India in April without their top-ranked player Alicia Molik, Tennis Australia said on Monday. 

New Australian captain John Alexander said the world No. 10 Molik has made herself unavailable for the April 18-24 Asia/Oceania group one qualifying matches in New Delhi. 

Australia are trying to move back into the main world group after being relegated last year. 

Samantha Stosur, ranked 46, will lead a squad that also includes Fed Cup veteran Nicole Pratt, Evie Dominikovic and newcomer Bryanne Stewart. 

Alexander said Molik would concentrate on her quest to become the world?s No. 1 player.

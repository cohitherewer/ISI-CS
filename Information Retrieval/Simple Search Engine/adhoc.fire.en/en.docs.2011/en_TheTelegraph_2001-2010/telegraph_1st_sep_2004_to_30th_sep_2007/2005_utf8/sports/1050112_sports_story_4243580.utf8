 Rooney set to return versus Chelsea 

 - Liverpool to field strong line-up against Watford 

 Rooney has been doing well in training, says Ferguson 

London: Chelsea couldn?t have picked a better time to face Manchester United. 

The two giants meet on Wednesday for the second time this season in England?s second-tier knockout competition, the League Cup. Liverpool host Watford in the other semi-final. 

Chelsea face an embarrassed United, who are in disarray after their millionaire players couldn?t beat Semipro Exeter in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. After the 0-0 draw, the two will meet in a replay on January 19. 

Chelsea beat United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on the opening day of the season in a strong start under new manager Jose Mourinho. The blues have since excelled in the Premier League while United have struggled. 

Traditionally, big clubs field second-string sides in the League Cup. United, having made that mistake on Saturday, won?t be doing it again as striker Wayne Rooney looks set to return after suspension for the match at Chelsea. 

?It is possible Wayne will play on Wednesday,? United manager Alex Ferguson said on Monday. ?He has missed the last three games but he has been doing well in training, so it is a consideration.? 

United are already without injured strikers Ruud van Nistelrooy and Louis Saha. 

Ferguson said he had expected more from his younger players including Eric Djemba-Djemba, Liam Miller and David Bellion against Exeter, a club ranked 100 place below the Red Devils. 

Chelsea had a scare in their FA Cup tie against Scunthorpe, trailing 0-1 before winning 3-1. But the blues? second team is still strong enough to challenge any Premier League club. 

Liverpool missed out on their FA Cup match at Burnley on Friday because of a waterlogged pitch. 

The extra day?s rest means manager Rafa Benitez will field a strong line-up against Watford, including striker Milan Baros. He returns after nearly two months out with a hamstring injury. Captain Steven Gerrard is also expected to play. 

?We know we are also in the semi-final of the Carling (League) Cup and it is important to put out a strong side that can win and get us to the final,? Benitez said. ?And there is a trophy at stake here, which we want to win.? 

Watford proved they could match Premier League oppositions when they drew 1-1 with Fulham in the FA Cup on Saturday. Manager Ray Lewington said Liverpool were a tougher task. 

?What they have got to do is play their normal game as much as possible,? Lewington said. ?Sometimes with the adrenaline, you actually play above yourself when you go to these places. Let?s get in there and if they beat us, they beat us.? (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am comfortable with this group: Chappell

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad/Vadodara: The question, at the customary pre-match Media conference, was pretty straightforward: Has the core group within Team India been identified? It was implied that the query pertained to ODIs. 

Coach Greg Chappells answer was direct as well: Weve got 15 players here (Vadodara) and one or two on the fringe of the squad whore pushing the guys... 

Former captain Sourav Ganguly isnt a fringe player, nor for that matter quick Zaheer Khan. Chappell, therefore, confirmed they dont figure in his scheme plotted for the 2007 World Cup. 

In fact, in response to another question, the coach said much the same thing: Im very comfortable with this group, but am always keen that we improve... Its a healthy sign if theres a problem of whom to leave out rather than whom to pick. 

Captain Rahul Dravid feels much the same way. He reinforced that by saying: Ive never played in a (one-day) series which has been won so convincingly... It has been a complete team effort and Ive been privileged to captain such a squad... 

As reported by The Telegraph, Souravs best chance for a quick comeback had been when the selectors met in Mohali after the second match. However, both Dravid and Chappell favoured sticking to the same 15 and their wish was granted by Kiran More and Co. 

Its a tradition that the selectors dont question anything asked for by a winning captain and coach. With one ODI remaining, the series scoreline reads 5-1 in Indias favour.

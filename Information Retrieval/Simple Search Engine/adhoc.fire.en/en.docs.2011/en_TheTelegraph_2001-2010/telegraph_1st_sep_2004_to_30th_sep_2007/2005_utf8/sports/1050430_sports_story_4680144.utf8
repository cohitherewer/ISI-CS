The Telegraph - Calcutta

 South Africa off to flying start

St John?s: AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith launched South Africa?s innings in explosive style on the first day of the fourth Test against West Indies on Friday. 

South Africa, who won the toss and chose to bat, were 114 without loss when rain stopped play 15 minutes before the scheduled lunch interval. 

De Villiers was unbeaten on 63 and Smith undefeated on 47. Between them, the duo rattled off 72 runs in boundaries. 

De Villiers faced 60 balls and hit 10 fours while Smith scored his runs off 76 deliveries with eight fours. 

The openers took a liking to the flat pitch, the small, fast outfield and the home team?s lacklustre bowling. 

Smith survived a run-out attempt in the second over when Wavell Hinds?s underarm throw from cover narrowly missed the stumps. 

Debutant fast bowler Dwight Washington came close to taking a wicket with the last ball of his first over when Smith?s cut cleared a leaping Dwayne Bravo in the gully. 

By contrast, De Villiers hardly put a foot wrong, cutting, driving and pulling with power. 

Besides capping Washington, West Indies also brought in allrounder Narsingh Deonarine and fast bowler Tino Best. 

Fast bowler Reon King and allrounder Ryan Hinds were omitted while paceman Fidel Edwards was left out as a precautionary measure after complaining of stiffness in his back. 

Allrounder Shaun Pollock returned for South Africa in place of fast bowler Andre Nel, who has a lower back injury. 

Pollock, his country?s leading bowler with 377 wickets in 93 Tests, was sidelined in January with chronic inflammation in his left ankle. 

South Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. (Reuters)

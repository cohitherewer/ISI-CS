The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chelsea keep slate clean

London: Chelsea made it six wins from six games after Hernan Crespo and Arjen Robben guided the Premier League champions to a 2-0 victory at Charlton Athletic on Saturday. 

Jose Mourinhos side, who have scored 12 and conceded no league goals this season, hit the woodwork twice before Crespo headed them into a 55th-minute lead and Robben curled in the second just five minutes later to seal the points. 

Defeat for Charlton, who stay second in the table pending Sundays games, was their first after having won all of their four previous league matches this season. 

West Ham United won 2-1 at Fulham in the other London derby, Portsmouth were held 1-1 at home by 10-man Birmingham City and there was heartbreak for Sunderland after West Bromwich Albion scored in the final seconds for a 1-1 draw. 

Mourinhos assistant Steve Clarke said: Theres no comfortable victories in the Premier League. The first half was an even game. At halftime we had a little word with the lads and asked them to step up a gear ? and I think it showed in the second half that we were on top. 

When you know youre in the ascendancy, you have to kill the game at that moment ? and we did that. 

Charlton boss Alan Curbishley said: Well take it on the chin today. Weve been doing well and we start again on Tuesday in the League Cup game (against Hartlepool). 

Crespo gave Charlton an early warning when the Argentine striker sent a 20th minute shot onto the post and France defender William Gallas hit the woodwork after the break. 

Ghana midfielder Michael Essien, on impressive form, picked out Crespo for their first goal, while Robben showed the range of the Dutch wingers skills with a superb shot for the second. 

West Ham striker Marlon Harewood, who scored a hattrick in Mondays 4-0 win over Aston Villa, was their match-winner again at Craven Cottage. He scored a fine solo goal after 47 minutes and then saw a shot fly in off keeper Tony Warner as an own goal.

Milan: Serie A leaders AC Milan and second-placed Juventus were held to draws by lowly opponents on Saturday but in starkly contrasting fashion. In a pulsating match in Florence, Juve came from behind three times with two goals from Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic helping them salvage a 3-3 draw at Fiorentina. 

Milan were held 1-1 at home to Brescia after a thundering equaliser from the visitors? defender Pier Wome three minutes from time ended their run of eight successive wins. 

Those results left Milan top on goal difference with both teams on 67 points. 

Third-placed Inter, who face Milan in a Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday, won 1-0 at Bologna with an early goal by Julio Ricardo Cruz against his old club. Despite the win Inter are still 14 points behind the leaders. 

Giampaolo Pazzini fired Fiorentina in front against Juventus after 14 minutes with a fabulous strike from outside the area. Just eight minutes later, Alessandro Del Piero brought Juve level with a near post shot that Fiorentina keeper Cristian Cejas should have kept out. 

A Giorgio Chiellini header from a Martin Jorgensen cross sent the Florence side in 2-1 up at the break but another mistake from Cejas allowed Juve to equalise again. 

The Fiorentina keeper raced out of his area but his weak clearance fell straight at the feet of Ibrahimovic who drifted the ball into the unguarded goal. With 15 minutes remaining Fiorentina went ahead for the third time in the game with a Dario Dainelli header but once again the Viola, coached by former Juventus favourite Dino Zoff, were unable to hold on to their lead. 

With eight minutes remaining Juve produced a fluent passing move and, after a smart one-two with Marcelo Zalayeta, Ibrahimovic?s classy finish earned the Turin side a point. 

Milan played without injured captain Paolo Maldini and with several changes to the side that beat Inter 2-0 on Wednesday, and went ahead with Rui Costa?s beautiful strike. 

Athletic Bilbao claimed the honours in the Basque derby with a 3-0 win at home to regional rivals Real Sociedad in the Primera Liga Saturday, adds a report from Madrid.

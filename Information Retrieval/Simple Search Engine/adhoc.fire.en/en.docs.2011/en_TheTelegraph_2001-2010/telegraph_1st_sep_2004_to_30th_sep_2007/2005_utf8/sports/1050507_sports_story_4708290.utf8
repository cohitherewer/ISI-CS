 ICC yet to find solution

New Delhi: Harbhajan Singhs doosra seems to have snared the ICC too, with games governing body unable to find a solution to the issue of his bowling action. 

?We are working together with the BCCI to establish the best way forward in resolving the issue,? ICC spokesperson Brendan Mcclements said from London on Friday. 

Mcclements said there was enough analysis of Harbhajans action already available, and as such ICC has to find new ways to deal with the case.

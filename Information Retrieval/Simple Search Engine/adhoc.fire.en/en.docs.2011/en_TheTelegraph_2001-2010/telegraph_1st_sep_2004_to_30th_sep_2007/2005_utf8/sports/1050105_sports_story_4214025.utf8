The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav offered captaincy

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After Rohan Gavaskar put in his papers on Monday, Sourav Ganguly was offered the captaincy but the Team India captain hasn?t informed the CAB officially about his intentions. 

?Sourav was offered to lead the side when he is available. However, during his absence someone else will take charge,? a CAB source told The Telegraph. 

According to the source, either Devang Gandhi or Laxmi Ratan Shukla was slated to succeed Rohan. But now with the selection committee divided in their opinion, the matter will be sorted out by CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

At a selection committee meeting for the state under-22 probables, the matter came up for discussion. It was learnt that three of the selectors voted in favour of Shukla while Devang Gandhi got only one support. 

Devang?s asset is his experience. ?If Devang is made the skipper, he will also lead East Zone side in the Duleep Trophy. But if Shukla is given duty, Orissa?s Shiv Sundar Das might be chosen,? the source said. 

If Sourav ultimately decides to be the captain, the other who will lead the side throughout the season will be given the status of vice-captain. Bengal will start their Ranji Trophy East Zone one-day meet campaign against Jharkhand on January 11 at the Eden.

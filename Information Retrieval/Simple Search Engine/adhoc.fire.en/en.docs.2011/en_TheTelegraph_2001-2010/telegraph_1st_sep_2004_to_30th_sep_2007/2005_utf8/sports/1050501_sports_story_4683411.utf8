 - FINAL TEST 

St John?s: The West Indies jolted South Africa out of the comfort zone by grabbing three wickets for six runs on the second day of the fourth and final Test on Saturday. 

The touring side reached lunch on 295 for four with Jacques Kallis on 21. 

Captain Graeme Smith was out for 126 and Abraham de Villiers for 114 after the two became the ninth opening pair and the third from South Africa to share century stands in three consecutive Tests. 

They are also the first pair of openers to both score centuries in consecutive Test innings. 

Smith had scored 104 and De Villiers a career-best 178 in the third Test in Bridgetown, which South Africa won by an innings and 86 runs to clinch the series. 

De Villiers and Smith piled up 241 on Friday, when rain and bad light restricted play to 48.5 overs. 

They were separated eight overs into Saturday?s play when Tino Best came around the wicket to the right-handed De Villiers, who sparred at a leg-side delivery and feathered a catch to wicketkeeper Courtney Browne, ending the partnership at 245. 

Three balls later, Smith drove limply at a ball from Daren Powell and was caught by Dwight Washington at mid-on. Smith faced 173 balls and hit 19 fours. 

South Africa slipped to 251 for three when Boeta Dippenaar drove a delivery from Best to mid-wicket and was run out by Narsingh Deonarine. Dippenaar did not react to Kallis? early refusal of a third run and turned back too late. 

South Africa might have been 286 for four, but Brian Lara at slip failed to hold a difficult chance offered by Herschelle Gibbs, on 17, off Dwayne Bravo. 

Gibbs, who scored 23, was dismissed with what became the last ball before lunch, which he prodded to Deonarine at short-leg to earn a wicket for off-spinner Chris Gayle. 

The West Indies? decision to open the bowling with off-spinner Deonarine on Saturday hinted at a defensive mindset. 

But their seamers bowled a shorter length than on Friday, when they fed South Africa a steady stream of over-pitched deliveries. 

Smith, in fact, expressed surprised at the West Indies? approach on the first day. 

?I didn?t think twice about batting after I won the toss and I was surprised when I found out that the West Indies were going to bowl first if they had the choice,? Smith told a news conference. 

?It was also surprising that they took (fast bowler Tino) Best off after he started to reverse swing the ball and that they started with (medium pacer) Wavell Hinds after tea. 

?We never allowed them to settle, but I think the West Indies gave up too early.? 

Smith said South Africa had taken the weather forecast into account. 

?Our plan was to get a decent start, especially with the rain coming, and the rate we scored at helped to make up for the rain stoppages,? he said.

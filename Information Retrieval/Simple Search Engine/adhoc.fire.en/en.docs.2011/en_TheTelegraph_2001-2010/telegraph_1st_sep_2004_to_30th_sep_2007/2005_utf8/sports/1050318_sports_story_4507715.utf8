The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan desperate for three points

 - NFL tie vs Salgaocar 

 Noel Wilson is a doubtful starter 

Margao: Three-time champions Mohun Bagan would look to get back to winning ways against Salgaocar when they clash in the National Football League for ONGC Cup on Friday. 

Both teams had an indifferent showing in the first phase of the league with Mohun Bagan collecting 15 points from 12 matches, three better than Salgaocar. Both are aware of the requirement to collect full points to avoid the danger of relegation. 

The green-maroons, who lost to Fransa Pax in their last encounter on Tuesday, received a setback when striker Ashim Biswas had to be rushed to Calcutta on Wednesday for treatment after he aggravated his knee injury. 

To add to their woes, dependable medio Noel Wilson ? who is carrying a leg injury ? is also a doubtful starter. But the return of Mehtab Hussain would boost their defence in the presence of Ajibade Babalade, Edwardo Coelho and Mehrajuddin Wadao. 

Salgaocar?s start to the second phase received a jolt as they lost to Churchill Brothers. They will be looking to their new recruit, Brazilian Fabio Passos to do the needful. It, however, remains to be seen how well he combines with Nigerian Felix Ibrebru, Salgaocar?s trump card, who did not play in the last match on account of double booking. 

Meanwhile, Mahindra United would be facing Vasco in another NFL match at the Cooperage on Friday. 

Mahindra, slow to get off the blocks, have needed some late charges to keep themselves in the hunt for the top honours. At the end of the first phase, the Mumbai outfit is fourth with 18 points.

 CA sympathy for minnows

Brisbane: Australia supports the principle of keeping minnows Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in Test cricket but wants to better manage its future contests with them, Cricket Australia (CA) said Tuesday. 

CA chief executive James Sutherland has voiced his support for the retention of the two Test-strugglers, saying a sport with only 10 Test-status nations cant afford to dump teams. 

But Sutherland indicated the world champions bulging schedule of 17 Tests and about 34 one-dayers scheduled in five different countries over the next 11 months was not ideal. 

He said CA needed to explore how to fulfil obligations to the ICCs itinerary but not burn out its leading players. 

We will continue to look at that both from the context of who we play and when we play them, but also individually with players themselves in terms of managing their own workloads so that they dont get too much of a burden. 

The debate over Zimbabwe and Bangladeshs inclusion in Test cricket intensified after Bangladesh was pulverised inside three days by England last weekend. 

Sutherland would not make a judgement about Bangladesh, who broke through for a maiden Test win against a depleted Zimbabwe in January. 

They have (Test) status and we have commitments under the future tour programmes to play against those countries, he said. 

Its something that we see that we need to do (to fulfil) obligations contractually, but also to develop the game worldwide. 

Ten countries isnt a lot of countries to be registered Test-playing countries and in order for the game to continue to grow ... Its important that countries like Bangladesh are given the best possible opportunity to do that. (AFP)

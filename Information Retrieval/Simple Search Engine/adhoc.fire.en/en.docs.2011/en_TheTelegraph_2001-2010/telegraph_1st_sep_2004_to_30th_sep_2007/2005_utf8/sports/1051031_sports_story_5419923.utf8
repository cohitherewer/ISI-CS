 Campbell, King a study in contrast

 Guest Column

 Ledley King

 Sol Campbell may not have had 

 his best game in Saturdays North London derby between 

 Tottenham and Arsenal. But it was still a chance not just 

 to gauge the respective talents of two of Englands 

 potential World Cup centre halves in Campbell and Spurs 

 excellent Ledley King but to straddle two different eras 

 of defensive qualities.

 Sol is very much an old fashioned 

 central defender; big, strong, quick, aggressive, strong 

 in the air and with a big heart. Not the most gifted of 

 footballers but the sort of bloke you would always want 

 in your side or beside you in the trenches, though he looked 

 more than a bit ring rusty Saturday.

 Ledley, on the other hand, is 

 a more modern version of the central defensive art, very 

 comfortable on the ball, as he proved again, and though 

 big and quick, too, not the sort who wears his heart and 

 soul on his sleeve, instead giving the appearance of having 

 a more relaxed attitude. 

 He is also such a versatile player 

 that he is equally efficient in the midfield holding role, 

 as he showed recently in the final World Cup qualifier against 

 Poland, and has also played in both full back positions 

 for Spurs. We used to call that sort of footballer a utility 

 player, which is not really fair in Kings case because 

 he can actually play all those positions expertly. 

 What I love about both players 

 is that they can perform when it really counts and that, 

 ultimately, is what separates the very good club player 

 from the top international player, having the mental strength 

 to produce the goods when it matters most. Sol proved it 

 in the 1998 and 2002 World Cup finals and the 2000 and 2004 

 European Championships, while Ledley was outstanding when 

 he was drafted in against France in Portugal last year.

 Campbell and King, without knowing 

 it, could be in direct competition for one of the England 

 centre-half places and it seems inevitable, given their 

 ages, that there will be an overlap in their careers. At 

 31, Campbell might still be just below his peak but as someone 

 who relies so much on his pace, he might also be experiencing 

 the law of diminishing returns, where he will find it hard 

 to maintain his form beyond another 12 months or so.

 He has suffered a lot with injury 

 in the past two seasons and as I can confirm from painful 

 experience, that is what happens when you are close to the 

 end of your career.

 In saying that, I am not writing 

 off Sol. He and King will certainly be in Erikssons 

 XXII and though the latter has time on his side, he will 

 still want to be in the starting line-up of a side that 

 has a great chance of making history by winning the competition. 

 For that reason, he will happily 

 accept the holding role that Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard 

 both find so uncomfortable, particularly as central defence 

 is the most competitive area of the team. So with any luck, 

 Sol and Ledley will end up World Cup winners in the same 

 starting XI.

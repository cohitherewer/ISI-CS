 Musharraf approves PCB blueprint

Islamabad: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has approved the strategy being adopted by the Pakistan Cricket Board to win the 2007 World Cup to be held in the West Indies. 

PCB made a presentation to Musharraf outlining its proposals for achieving success at the next World Cup, a PCB release said here on Wednesday. 

The President approved measures taken by the PCB to prepare the national team for the top event, the release said. 

The President also appreciated the marked improvement in the teams performance in recent months and appreciated the role of board management, coach Bob Woolmer and captain Inzamam-ul Haq for their contribution in transforming the players into a fighting unit, the release said. 

The meeting was attended by PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, Woolmer, Inzamam, former Test player Zaheer Abbas and senior cricket administrators. 

During the presentation, the President, also the patron-in-chief of the PCB, asked pointed questions relating to the plan of action and interacted on the strategy outlined by the chairman. 

The President underlined the importance of discipline, fitness and building up reserve players for the World Cup. 

Earlier, former captain Javed Miandad expressed his unhappiness at not being communicated properly by the PCB about his attendance at the meeting with Musharraf. 

According to a report in a local daily, Miandad said he was informed by a PCB functionary about the meeting only Tuesday morning, which was a very short notice to attend such an important meeting. 

I told the caller that first they should let me know who had instructed for my presence in the meeting. Was it the Presidency or the board? Miandad was quoted as saying. 

Secondly, this was no way to invite a former Test captain to such an important meeting at such short notice and how was I required to make myself present at the Presidency on Wednesday in Islamabad, he said. 

The caller said the board would get back to me with details and I am still awaiting that call, he said. 

Miandad said the way the PCB went about the whole thing gave him the impression that it was not interested in having him present at the meeting. (PTI)

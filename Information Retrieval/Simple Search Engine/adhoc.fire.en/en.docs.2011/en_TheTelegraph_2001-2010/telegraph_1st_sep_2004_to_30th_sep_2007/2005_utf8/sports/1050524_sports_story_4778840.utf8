 Michael, Ralf in war of words

 - Elder brother accused of dangerous driving

Monaco: Ralf Schumacher accused elder brother Michael of dangerous driving that could have broken his neck after a last lap incident in Sundays Monaco Grand Prix. 

Michael, the seven-time world champion, tried to overtake Ralfs Toyota on the final lap and their wheels appeared to touch at high speed. Ralf held on for sixth place as Ferraris winless streak stretched to seven races. 

That was very dangerous, Ralf told German TV after the race.Sometimes Michael isnt all there. Sometimes I have the impression he turns his brain off. 

Ralf told a newspaper on Monday: If the tyres of either of us had shifted slightly, they would have been off (the track). 

Then he would at least have broken his neck. Personally I dont want that. 

Michael was unmoved by Ralfs criticism. 

I was only six-hundredths of a second behind Ralf and my attack was perfectly acceptable. I am a full-blooded racer. Were not on a Sunday outing. (Reuters)

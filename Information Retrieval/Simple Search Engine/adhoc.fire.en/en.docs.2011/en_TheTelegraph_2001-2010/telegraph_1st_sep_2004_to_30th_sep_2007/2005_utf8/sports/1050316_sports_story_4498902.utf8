The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Afridi a good option, feels Aamer Sohail

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Aamer Sohail is not a keen believer in chopping and changing the opening slots, but under the current circumstances leading to the Eden Test, the former Pakistan captain and selector thinks Shahid Afridi can be a good option as an opener. 

[In fact, late on Tuesday night, it was learnt that Afridi will make the XI and open.] 

?I don?t think opening is a problem for us. Both Salman (Butt) and Taufeeq (Umar) are quite good. They are learning and they should be encouraged. But sometimes you need to change strategy to add variety to the team,? Sohail said on Tuesday. 

?The Eden pitch generally favours spinners towards the end. Considering this, Afridi is an option that is worth exploring. 

?He can be used as an opener as well and his bowling can come in handy here,? remarked Sohail, himself a former opener.?

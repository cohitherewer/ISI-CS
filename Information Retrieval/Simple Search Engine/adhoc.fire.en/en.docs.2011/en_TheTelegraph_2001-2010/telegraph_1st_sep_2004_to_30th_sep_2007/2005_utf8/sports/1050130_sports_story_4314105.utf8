The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hewitt and Hawkeye 

Martin Johnson

Melbourne: The double-handed backhand wasn?t in vogue when John McEnroe first demonstrated its potential, with a frankly awesome display in a Davis Cup final in Stockholm. His initial forehand, which removed only a handful of plastic cups from his changeover table, left him as dissatisfied as a ten-pin bowler with a couple of skittles still standing, but the legendary American followed it up with an attack of such ferocity that the contents of an exploding glass water jug carried all the way to the seat occupied by the King of Sweden. 

Moments like that are not only part of the game?s priceless heritage, but provide it with an obligation to make sure that they are not lost to future generations. Which is why it is disturbing to see tennis now edging in cricket?s direction by threatening to take the human element out of decision-making. As the great man might have put it himself if he were here, they cannot be serious. 

Oh, but they are. The Australians have been so taken by a machine known as Hawkeye, which purports to convey images of the precise landing area of the ball, that they are talking about video replays for next year?s Open. Let?s just hope that Hawkeye, which is a computer program, doesn?t get hacked by a bent bookmaker, and has anyone considered the by-product of taking away the fun for the spectators? In an earlier round, when a line judge appeared to have fallen into a coma, a plaintive voice from the crowd shouted, in that unique Australian way: ?Someone wake the bugger up!? 

There are also the spin-offs to consider, and while it is frankly startling to see how many people are prepared to queue up for the privilege of having their giant tennis balls autographed by Slovakian players with unpronounceable names, there surely won?t be much of a rush for the bookshelves for signed copies of Hawkeye ? The Autobiography. 

However, the Hawkeye debate has been temporarily set to one side here, and should Lleyton Hewitt go on to win this tournament, it will make Henmania look about as virulent as a runny nose. The build-up to the Australian?s semi-final against America?s Andy Roddick had them in such a lather of excitement that one newspaper devoted half a page (complete with medical diagrams) to something called a ?hip flexor muscle?. 

This part of Hewitt?s body has been playing him up all through the tournament, and bulletins are released almost hourly. If a kangaroo had been made Australian of the Year, or the death penalty reintroduced for anyone caught watching Home and Away, Lleyton?s hip flexor would still have been lead item on the six o?clock news. 

Hewitt making it to the semi-final was, in fact, such a seismic event that the Melbourne Herald-Sun offered their readers an insight into 24 hours in the life of their tennis hero after his quarter-final victory over Argentina?s David Nalbandian. And exciting isn?t a strong enough word for it.

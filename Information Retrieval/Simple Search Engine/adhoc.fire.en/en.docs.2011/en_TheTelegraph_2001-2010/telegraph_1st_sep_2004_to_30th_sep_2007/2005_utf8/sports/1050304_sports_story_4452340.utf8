 Randhawa, Atwal tee-off tomorrow

Dubai: Third time lucky is what Arjun Atwal is hoping for as he gets underway with his challenge at the $ 2.2 million Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament, the richest professional golf tournament on the continent. 

Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa will head the Indian challenge at the 16th edition of the Dubai Desert Classic, where no Indian has finished higher than sixth. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, who missed the cut here last year, was sixth in 2001, but Randhawa has been the most consistent Indian in Dubai. 

He had a best finish of tied eighth in 1999 and a tied 13th in 2003, besides a tied 37th in 2000. Atwal, the only Indian to have won on the European Tour, the co-sanctioned 2002 Singapore Masters and 2003 Malaysian Open, has failed to make the cut on both appearances in the event.

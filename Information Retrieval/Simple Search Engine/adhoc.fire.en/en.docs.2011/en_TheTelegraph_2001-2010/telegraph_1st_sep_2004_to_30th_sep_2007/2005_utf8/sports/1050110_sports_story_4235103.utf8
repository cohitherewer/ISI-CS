 Valencia stretch unbeaten run

 - Spanish League

 Getafe hold Sevilla 

Madrid: Valencia extended their unbeaten run to eight matches after second-half strikes from Ruben Baraja and Mista helped them to a 2-1 win over city rivals Levante in the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

Baraja put Valencia in fro-nt when he nodded home 10 minutes after the break and Mista doubled the home side?s lead five minutes later after his close-range header was controversially ruled to have crossed the line. 

Levante substitute Edwin Congo made for an exciting finish when he pulled a goal back 17 minutes from time, but it was not enough to stop Valencia claiming the honours in the first league derby between the teams in 40 years. 

The win took Claudio Ranieri?s side within seven points of leaders Barcelona, who have a tricky fixture at Villarreal on Sunday. 

Fourth-placed Sevilla missed the chance to consolidate their position in the upper reaches of the table when they were held to a 0-0 draw by unfancied Getafe. 

The Andalucians, who have not lost at home this season, rarely threatened against their modest visitors who enjoyed better share of the match and were only denied a win by some outstanding goalkeeping from Esteban. 

Athletic Bilbao spurned a chance to move into the European places as they were held to a 1-1 draw vs Numancia. Asier del Horno?s first-half header was cancelled out when Luis Tevenet scored with a 30-metre drive to earn the home side a point. (Reuters)

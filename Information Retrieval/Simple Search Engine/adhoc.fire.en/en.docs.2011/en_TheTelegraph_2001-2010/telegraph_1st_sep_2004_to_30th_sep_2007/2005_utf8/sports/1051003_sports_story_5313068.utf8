New Delhi: India drubbed Italy 5-0 in their second match of the Indira Gandhi Gold Cup hockey tournament at the National Stadium on Sunday. 

Jasjeet Kaur, who was completely off colour and missed a penalty stroke on Saturday, was the star of the day scoring three goals, besides setting a brilliant piece for Saba Anjum. 

After their lacklustre performance against Malaysia on Saturday, the hosts pulled up their socks and the forward line came up with better synchronisation, especially in the second half of the match. 

Before the break, the hosts were disorganised and faltered in front of goalmouth on a number of occasions but they came up with a much-improved performance in the second half, scoring three goals in the last 13 minutes. 

However, the Indian eves continued to miss penalty corners and failed to convert any of the seven they got on Sunday. 

Jasjeet scored of a free hit push by Subhadra Pradahan in the third minute of the match. 

Two penalty corners went abegging by India in the 13th and 31st minute, while Italy wasted one in the 17th. India went 1-0 into the breather. 

The second half saw the Indian forward line controlling the ball better and making some brilliant moves. 

Chanu dribbled past Italys defenders and pushed the ball to Mamta on the left flank. Her cross rebounded off the goalie, but Jasjeet was in front of the net and made no mistake, deflecting the ball into the net. 

A sharp move by Jasjeet in the 62nd took the Italian defenders by surprise. She showed fine control and pushed the ball between two players to Saba, who was just left to get past the goalie. 

The Indian stepped up the offensive, as the Italian team appeared exhausted in the last moments of the game. Saba, who scored a brace on Saturday, deflected another ball into the net off a hit by Adeline Kerketta in the 68th. 

Jasjeet scored a brilliant last-minute goal after trapping a push by Kerketta and hitting the board.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Zonal NCA centres likely

Bangalore: The National Cricket Academy (NCA) may spread its wings by setting up zonal centres. 

An NCA meeting on Wednesday, which was attended by chairman Sunil Gavaskar, director Shivlal Yadav and other members besides BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, discussed such a possibility, reports PTI. 

According to Yadav, the proposal was to set up the academies in Chennai (South), Mohali (North), Calcutta (East), Mumbai (West) and Nagpur (Central). It was also formally announced that the Spin Wing would be merged with the NCA. 

The committee expressed satisfaction with the NCAs functioning but felt there was room for improvement. 

NCA chairmanship 

Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta adds: The Boards working committee, which met in Mumbai on December 4, didnt retain Gavaskar as the NCA chairman. 

In fact, as was reported by The Telegraph, the committee did everything but name the chairman. That decision was left to president Sharad Pawar ? who chose to continue with Gavaskar largely due to local (Mumbai) pressure. 

Pawar, apparently, had made a pre-election commitment to Raj Singh Dungarpur that the post would be his. The local pressure, obviously, proved too much.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Goa club hit hard

Margao: The All India Football Federations (AIFF) decision to revoke its ban on foreigners in the second division of the NFL had an immediate impact on the Goa Football Association (GFA) as Cabral Sports Club, the only Goan club to qualify for the second tier, submitted a letter to the GFA informing their decision to disband the team. 

In a letter to the GFA, president of the club Francisco Cabral, stated that the earlier AIFF ban on foreign players had deprived them of a chance to qualify for the premier league as they had two foreigners who are now playing for Fransa. 

Now that the AIFF has revoked its decision, we have no quality players as nine of our boys have signed in inter-state transfer, he said. (PTI)

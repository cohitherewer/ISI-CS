 Rooney hits a brace

London: Wayne Rooney scored twice and Rio Ferdinand grabbed his first goal for Manchester United in a 4-0 rout of Wigan Athletic which pushed the Old Trafford club up to second in the Premier League on Wednesday. Ruud van Nistelroy completed the tally. 

In the nights other game, West Ham United beat Everton 2-1 at Goodison Park. 

The victory by Manchester United, which took their tally to 34 points from 16 games, helped Alex Fergusons men leapfrog Liverpool into second place, nine points behind leaders Chelsea. Promoted Wigan, on 25 points, dropped one place to eighth. 

Meanwhile, Roy Keane joined Scottish League leaders Celtic on Thursday on an 18-month contract. The former Manchester United captain has long said he would like to end his career at the Glasgow club. He spurned the chance to join Real Madrid. (Reuters)

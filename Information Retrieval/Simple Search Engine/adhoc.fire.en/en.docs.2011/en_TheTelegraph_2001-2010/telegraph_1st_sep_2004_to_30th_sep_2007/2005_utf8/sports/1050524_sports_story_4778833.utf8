 Carson (California): Former Olympic 100 metres champion Maurice Greene suffered a shock defeat in the Adidas Track Classic on Sunday in a race marred by equipment problems and two false starts.

 Greene finished fourth in a race won by fellow American Leonard Scott, who recorded an impressive 10.03 seconds running into a stiff headwind.

 However, the 30-year-old American said the defeat did not represent a setback in his preparations for next month?s US national championships at the same venue.

 Olympic gold medallist Veronica Campbell powered to victory in the women?s 100 metres in 10.96 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year. 

 London: Newcastle United manager Graeme Souness faces a disciplinary charge after comments he made about referee Barry Knight following a 2-0 defeat at Everton, the FA said on Monday.

 The FA said Souness had until June 6 to respond to a charge of ?a failure to act in the best interests of the game and/or having brought the game into disrepute?.

 The Scot criticised Knight for his handling of the game at Goodison Park on May 7 and also of their 3-0 defeat in April by Aston Villa. Newcastle?s Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer were sent off for fighting each other in the match at St James? Park.

 Rotterdam: Coach Ruud Gullit has left Feyenoord after less than a year in charge, local media reported on Monday.

 The Rotterdam-based club won their final match of the season 6-3 against ADO Den Haag on Sunday to finish fourth in the table, 25 points behind champions PSV Eindhoven.

 Club officials met on Monday to discuss the season and Gullit resigned because he felt he did not have sufficient support from the directors, local radio said. 

 Lisbon: Portuguese Jose Couceiro resigned as coach of European champions Porto after his team failed to retain the Portuguese premier league title on Sunday.

 ?I declined the invitation from the management to remain in the club soccer structure,? Couceiro said. 

 London: Harry Redknapp will stay on as manager of Southampton and lead their campaign for promotion back to the Premier League next season, the club said on Monday. ?I?ve always said that this would be my last football job and I?m not going out on a low note,? Redknapp said.

 Tough day for Glamorgan

 - County championship 

London: Sourav Ganguly, playing for Glamorgan, could not help his team check Kent who amassed 357 for seven on Day I of the County Championship game at Sophia Gardens. 

The regular Team India captain bowled only three overs in which he conceded eight runs without taking a wicket. 

Martin van Jaarsveld was unbeaten on 174. 

Harbhajan Singh, playing for Surrey, struck luck towards the end of the first day when he claimed the prized wicket of J. W. M. Dalrymple in another Division One match against Middlesex at Lordsy. Dalrymple was the top scorer with 77. 

The off-spinner had figures of 24-8-57-1. His teammates, pacer J. Ormond and M.P. Bicknell, took three and two wickets, respectively, after Middlesex elected to bat first. 

Middlesex were 319 for seven at close with Indias Irfan Pathan, batting on 33. Pathan played 59 balls and hit six boundaries. 

Openers E T Smith (60) and B L Hutton (44) laid a strong foundation for a decent score for their side. (Agencies)

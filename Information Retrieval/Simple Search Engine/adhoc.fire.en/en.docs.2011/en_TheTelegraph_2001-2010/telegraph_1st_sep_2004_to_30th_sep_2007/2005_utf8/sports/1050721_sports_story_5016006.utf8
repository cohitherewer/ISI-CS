Montreal: Alexandre Despatie won gold in the three-metre springboard at the world swimming championships on Tuesday as Canada continued to ride a wave of success in the diving pool by reaching the podium for the third straight day. 

Despatie, who led after the preliminaries and semi-finals, capped a near flawless performance on a sun-kissed day before his hometown crowd by scoring perfect 10s from three judges on the third of six final dives to finish with a total of 813.60. 

It is the second gold medal in as many days for Canada, matching the two won by China on Sunday, the opening day of the two-week championships. 

After a bronze in the three-metre synchronised event, the United States were back on the podium with Troy Dumais taking silver with 752.76. 

Chinas He Chong, a gold medallist in the three-metre synchronised competition, added a bronze to his world championship haul by taking third with 730.77 ahead of Olympic champion and team mate Peng Bo. 

Winners of a record six of eight gold medals at the Athens Olympics, China looked poised to stage another assault on the podium in Montreal but have been blocked by a motivated squad of Canadian divers energised by raucous flag-waving crowds. 

While Blythe Hartleys victory in the one-metre springboard and a bronze from Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion in the 10-metre platform synchronised event were pleasant surprises, Despatie was always likely to provide the hosts with a gold. 

Canadas most accomplished diver, the Montreal native delivered as expected with a precision performance that produced the highest score in the event at a world championships. 

A lot of people were expecting so much and Im just happy that I didnt disappoint them, said Despatie. Im hoping this (medal) will provide another motivation to the team. 

Hopefully, it gives a tap on the back to the whole team. 

The world champion in the 10m platform, but unable to defend his title here because of a back injury, Despatie turned his attention to the three-metre springboard. 

The change in focus was hardly a stretch for the versatile 20-year-old, who took silver in the three-metre event in Athens. 

Today is huge satisfaction for me, said Despatie, who has been the face of these championships, appearing on billboards and ads across the city. I want to compete in both events. 

Not many divers compete in both but it excites me. 

Today is a day I will never forget... I will never forget Athens either. But today will always be something special.

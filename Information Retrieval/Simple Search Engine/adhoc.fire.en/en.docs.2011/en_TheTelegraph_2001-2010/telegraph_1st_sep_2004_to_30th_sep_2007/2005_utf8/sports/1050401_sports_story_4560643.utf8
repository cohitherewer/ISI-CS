 Mourinho gets 2-match ban 

 Jose Mourinho was also 

 fined 20,000 Swiss francs

Nyon: Chelsea were fined 75,000 Swiss francs ($62,810) and coach Jose Mourinho handed a two-match touchline ban by Uefa on Thursday for making false declarations in the Anders Frisk affair. 

The London club, charged with bringing the game into disrepute, had alleged Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard visited the Swedish referee at halftime during the first leg of their Champions League first knock-out round tie at the Nou Camp on February 23. 

Uefa had accused Chelsea of ?deliberately creating a poisoned and negative ambience? after they refused to attend the post-match news conference and submitted a report detailing their allegations. 

?Mourinho? will have to sit out the quarter final tie against Bayern Munich subject to an appeal,? a Uefa statement said after Thursday?s hearing. 

Mourinho was also fined 20,000 Swiss francs. 

Mourinho?s assistant Steve Clarke and Chelsea security official Les Miles were also reprimanded after being charged with bringing the game into disrepute. 

Chelsea said they were unlikely to appeal.

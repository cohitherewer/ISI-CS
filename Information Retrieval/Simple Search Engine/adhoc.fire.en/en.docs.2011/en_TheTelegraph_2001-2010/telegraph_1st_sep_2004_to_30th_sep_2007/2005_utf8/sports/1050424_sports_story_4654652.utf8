Calcutta: The stakes are never at a premium in an East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan derby. The pride factor is omnipresent, if not anything else. Come Sunday afternoon, pride and sentiment will take a backseat as they clash in the National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup ? desperately seeking points for totally contrasting purposes. 

The age-old rivalry is replete with stories of edge-of-the-seat drama, heroism and courage. But rarely, if ever, have the two foes gone into battle perched so delicately at two ends of the spectrum. 

On the one hand you have East Bengal (36 points from 17 matches) enjoying a wafer-thin advantage in pursuit of an unprecedented hattrick of National Football League (NFL) titles. Victories in their remaining five games will see East Bengal at the pinnacle once more but any slip-up along the way, Sporting Clube de Goa (38 from 18) and Dempo (35 from 17) are waiting to pounce on that half-chance. 

Then there are Mohun Bagan, the two-time champions who have fallen on bad times. They have averaged one point per game in 18 outings so far and are seriously stuck in the drop-zone. SBT have more or less ?booked? a relegation berth, but there are still three more candidates to be identified and in the fight for survival are Tollygunge Agragami, Vasco and Churchill along with the green-and-maroons. 

By simple logic, in-form East Bengal should be runaway favourites for the Salt Lake duel. Subhas Bhowmick, though, disagrees. 

?The NFL has proved that there are no big teams. Anyone can beat anyone on this stage, so no team is a favourite. In my book, Mohun Bagan will be as tough to beat as, say, Mahindra or Salgaocar,? Bhowmick argued after his team?s 90-minute morning workout. 

His philosophy is simple: win all five games, thus not letting anyone touch you en route to the summit. ?I?ve told my boys to treat the rest of the league as a five-match knockout tournament? if we lose, we are out of the picture,? said Bhowmick. 

A word of caution was thrown in for good measure. ?If you can?t win, don?t concede a goal. We must make sure we maintain discipline in defence. Against Fransa, we went all out to score in the second half and let in a goal and lost. That must not happen,? remarked the coach. 

He will have to finalise his starting XI without the suspended Bhaichung Bhutia. But, as is his style, Bhowmick didn?t betray any worries. ?I have 30 players on the roster? Everyone should be in a position to stand up and be counted. So it shouldn?t really matter if one or two players are missing.? 

He wasn?t as dismissive of the Amal Dutta factor, though. Mohun Bagan have roped in the veteran coach to haul them out of troubled waters and Bhowmick is aware what he is capable of. ?I have to keep him (Dutta) in mind when I draw up strategy? I have to keep my options open,? said the East Bengal coach. 

Dutta, in charge of a team in absolute disarray, is looking to gamble with two players who have had very little part to play so far. Palash Karmakar has at least played a few matches so far, Pravin Rawat is totally untested. 

?I have to take chances, don?t have much option,? said Dutta, whose record since taking charge from Subrata Bhattacharya is three draws and two defeats. 

Hard-working medio Dharamjit Singh is ineligible with a double-booking, while the coach was learnt to be unhappy with Noel Wilson?s attitude. ?He says he has some injury,? was all that Dutta would say on Saturday. 

Nigerian Ajibade Babalade, not an indispensable defender by any stretch of imagination, has a leg injury. No wonder Dutta is having to work overtime to forge a new combination. 

He was a relieved man to have Sunil Chhetri back in the fold. ?Now that Chhetri is fit I can think of playing him as the second man up front. (Roberto Mendes Silva) Beto needs some support there,? Dutta observed. Good logic, only it remains to be seen whether the Beto-Chhetri duo can make any headway against the likes of M. Suresh and Debjit Ghosh. 

Dutta felt the absence of Bhutia could be a factor. ?He is the only Indian who can carry a team as the single striker. But the fact remains that we have to play our game.? 

Mohun Bagan?s game will, to a large extent, depend on how Subrata Pal copes with the forays of Alvito D?Cunha amp; Co. The young goalkeeper has been in terrific form since his ban was lifted. He would have to stand tall once again if the red-and-maroons hope to earn a point. 

LIKELY TEAMS 

East Bengal: Rajat Ghosh Dastidar/Sangram Mukherjee, Syed Rahim Nabi, M. Suresh, Selwyn Fernandes, Debjit Ghosh, Climax Lawrence, Habibur Rehman Mondal, Chandan Das, Ernest Jeremiah, Alvito D?Cunha, Juliano Martins. 

Mohun Bagan: Subrata Pal, Palash Karmakar, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Eduardo Coelho, Rishi Kapoor, Manitombi Singh, Pravin Rawat, Mehtab Hussain, Tomba Singh, Sunil Chhetri, Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?/Jerry Zirsanga.

 Diwakar upsets Konguvel

New Delhi: Diwakar Prasad Singh of Jharkhand forced himself into reckoning once again with an upset win against IM P. Konguvel while other top players settled for a draw in the 11th round of the 43rd Parsvnath National B Chess tournament on Thursday. 

As the situation stands in the elite event with only two more rounds to go, Grandmaster R. B. Ramesh maintained his full-point lead with 9.5 points to almost assure himself of the title. Five others followed him at 8.5 points each out of possible 11, as draw remained the order on seven of the top boards. 

There are as many as 13 players occupying the third position on eight points and they would be battling hard for a slot among the top 14 who will qualify for the premier National A championship. 

Those on 7.5 points included IMs Deepan Chakravarthy, Konguvel, Abhijit Gupta, Saptarshi Roy, V. Saravanan and Deep Sengupta, who would be making efforts to bounce back on Friday in the penultimate round of the event being played in Swiss format. 

Diwakar Prasad, with white pieces, scored his second upset of the tournament when he bagged a full point against third seed IM B. S. Sivanandan in the fifth round.

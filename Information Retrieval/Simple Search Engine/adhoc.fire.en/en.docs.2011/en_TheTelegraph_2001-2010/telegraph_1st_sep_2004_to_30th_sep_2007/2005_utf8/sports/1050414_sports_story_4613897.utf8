 Bhupathi wins with new partner

 - MONTE CARLO MASTERS 

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and Fernando Gonzalez of Chile easily won their opening match in the Monte Carlo Masters Series on Tuesday. 

Bhupathi, pairing with Gonzalez instead of his regular partner Todd Woodbridge, defeated Dominik Hrbaty (Slovakia) and Marat Safin (Russia) 6-3, 6-3, according to information received here. 

Bhupathi and Gonzalez will next play eighth seeds Simon Aspelin (Sweden) and Todd Perry (Australia), who got a bye into the second round. 

Leander Paes and Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic, who got a first-round bye, will take on Argentines Gaston Etlis and Martin Rodriguez who overcame Frenchmen Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils 7-5, 7-5. 

In singles play, world No. 1 Roger Federer joined Marat Safin, Rafael Nadal and Guillermo Coria in the third round on Wednesday. 

Federer went through his full repertoire of shot-making during a useful 59-minute workout against Spaniard Albert Montanes, winning 6-3, 6-4. 

?It was a solid performance,? said Federer. ?It?s always a test playing against a Spanish player on clay, and you could see the difference from yesterday (against Greg Rusedski).? 

Earlier, the 18-year-old Nadal demolished Xavier Malisse 6-0, 6-3. Safin beat Frenchman Cyril Saulnier 6-3, 6-1, while defending champion Coria eased past French qualifier Thierry Ascione 6-2, 6-1. (AGENCIES)

 EB make capital of railway goalies follies 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 I.M.Vijayan tries a back-volley against Eastern Railway on Monday. This one missed the mark but Vijayan netted two of his teams four goals. Picture by Gautam Bose 

Calcutta: When Subhas Bhowmick was about to leave the ground after the customary post-match prayer with the players, somebody from the membership stands shouted at him, asking whether the team could exact revenge on Mohun Bagan in the return leg (on September 3). East Bengal coach smiled and gestured a thumbs-up sign towards the stands. 

Bhowmick had reasons to smile. Its a common feature that the losing side of a derby clash always struggles to get out of a psychological pressure in the next few matches. East Bengal ? who lost to Mohun Bagan via the Gley Yao Rodrigue goal ? seemed to have left behind the trauma of that defeat and thrashed Eastern Railway 4-0 at home on Tuesday. 

I.M. Vijayan opened his account in red-and-gold jersey this season with a double while Alvito DCunha and Syed Rahim Nabi ensured that the team should counter whatever pressure was there in the most convincing way ? this time, the biggest margin of victory in the CFL Premier Division so far. 

But under the glare lie a few pockets of worries. The alternative talent, on which Bhowmick so often stresses as the key element of success, is yet to find any meaningful expression. The Gauranga Duttas and K. Kulothungans appear to have lost whatever touch they would have loved to boast of (Kulothungan was rightly substituted in as early as the 16th minute by Jayanta Sen). Mispasses inviting dangers are now a frequent feature in any of their display and the communication in the backline looks to be snapped at any time. 

Had Eastern Railway goalkeeper Surabuddin Chowdhury not committed some cardinal sins in his area, the magnitude of East Bengals victory would sure have sounded less emphatic. 

The real positive from Tuesdays match was, however, Vijayans return to goal-scoring. He put the rival area under test twice ? including a goalline save from Saikat Mondal ? before opening the floodgates. And for this to happen, more credits should go to Surabuddin rather than the scorer! 

When Jatin Bishts 26th-minute centre landed into the Eastern Railway box, the goalkeeper went up to claim it. He had world of space and time to do the simplest of a job ? collecting the ball ? even though Vijayan was chasing him rather casually. But in shocking manner, Surabuddin let the ball slip out of his hands, gifting it to his challenger and a surprised Vijayan duly obliged by slotting home. 

The manner the first goal was scored was in harmony with the way the home team was playing at that time ? error-prone, listless and casual. In fact, Eastern Railway came close to equalising, at least on two occasions towards the end of the first-half. First Bapan Bera forced a nice diving save from Rajat Ghosh Dastidar and then sent Farid Ali Mollah clear inside the box, but his weak attempt was not enough to beat the custodian. 

The real East Bengal came out shining in the second-half and in a spell of 21 minutes, bamboozled the Railway outfit. 

First came Alvitos free-kick from the left corner of the box in the 53rd minute, the ball went in after striking the far post. He didnt have time to celebrate since Shylo Malsawmtluanga had already lined up to replace him. 

Within five minutes came Vijayans second, heading home off a Nabi centre, and Surabuddin just watched him finishing from close. 

Nabi duly made it 4-0, meeting a Sasthi Duley chip with a fine right-footer. 

Surabuddin had to leave the field after that, but since East Bengal showed little intention to increase the tally, his replacement Tapan Karmakar spent a relatively peaceful time under the bar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We have to be more hungry, feels Kapil 

 - Cutting and chopping wont take India anywhere 

 Kapil 

New Delhi: Former captain Kapil Dev on Thursday called for a comprehensive policy for governing cricket in the country, saying there must be something seriously wrong with Team India to lose so many finals on the trot. 

If you lose so many finals on the trot... There has to be something seriously wrong. The boys have to be more hungry, more committed, Kapil said, stressing that he was sure that once Team India taste blood, there would be no stopping them. 

The changes in the team should not be for the sake of changing. They should be thinking changes, not changing (the team) today and changing it right back tomorrow. Cutting and chopping will not take the team anywhere, he said. 

Calling for a comprehensive policy to govern everything from bowling to fielding, he said, the moment the BCCI came up with a policy, everything would fall into place. 

The policy should recognise ten-year goals and work towards achieving them, Kapil said, referring to the performance review announced by BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra. Such things should be put into affect, not talked about.

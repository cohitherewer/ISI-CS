 Dravid in contention for top ICC award again

Mumbai: Rahul Dravid is in contention for the Hyundai ICC Player of the Year award for the second successive year. 

Dravid is the lone Indian on the candidates list announced on Wednesday by the ICC at a function in which the various trophies were unveiled by ODI wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Dravid, who won the inaugural best player and Test player of the year awards, is vying with six other cricketers for the most prestigious trophy to be announced and presented in Sydney on October 11. 

The others in the running are Andrew Flintoff, Inzamam-ul Haq, Adam Gilchrist, Jacques Kallis, Glenn McGrath and Ricky Ponting. 

Dravid apart, there are five other Indians in contention for the annual awards in two other categories: Anil Kumble, Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh for Test Player of the Year; Gautam Gambhir and Dinesh Karthik for Emerging Player of the Year. 

Dravid also features in the list of 18 for the ODI Player of the Year award. 

The panel of five, which finalised the lists and will decide the winners comprises Sunil Gavaskar (chairman), Richard Hadlee, Courtney Walsh, Rodney Marsh and David Gower. 

Besides the individual honours, there will be trophies for the Team of the Year and an award for Spirit of Cricket to be selected by the captains and Match Referees. Australia and New Zealand had won the respective team honours last year. 

The period for which the awards have been considered is from August 1, 2004 to July 31. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is on all three nomination lists for individual awards, though he didnt find a berth in the World XI squads for Super Series against Australia. 

Asked about this, ICCs manager for cricket operations Dave Richardson said the panel of selectors for the two were different. 

He also said the 2006 ICC awards function would most likely be held in Mumbai.

Melbourne: Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett overcame controversial over-rule on match point to defeat American twins Bob and Mike Bryan 6-4, 6-4 and claim the Australian Open men?s doubles title on Saturday. 

It was the second Grand Slam title for the Zimbabwe pair, who also won the 2001 US Open title in their only other appearance in a Grand Slam final. 

The outcome of the match resulted from just one break of serve in each set. Bob Bryan had to hold off three break points in the opening game, but dropped his next service game with a double-fault to give Black and Ullyett a 3-2 lead. 

Although both Bryan brothers then held serve to love to begin the second set, Mike Bryan was broken when Ullyett struck a backhand volley at the net. 

That gave Black and Ullyett a 3-2 lead, and although they failed to convert two match points on Mike Bryan?s serve at 5-3, Ullyett then served out for victory.

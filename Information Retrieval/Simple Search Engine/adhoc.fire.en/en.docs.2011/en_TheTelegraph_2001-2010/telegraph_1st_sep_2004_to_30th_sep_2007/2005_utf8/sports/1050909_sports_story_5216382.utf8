New York: World No. 1 Lindsay Davenport stumbled out of the US Open on Wednesday, humbled in the quarter finals by a Russian with one of the worst serves in the womens game. 

Sixth seed Elena Dementieva fully deserved her 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6) victory despite serving 12 double-faults, and will face Mary Pierce in the semi-finals after the rejuvenated Frenchwoman thrashed third seed Amelie Mauresmo 6-4, 6-1. 

Davenports defeat means the US will not have a representative in the womens semi-finals for the first time since 1994. It was only the second time in the last nine US Opens that she has failed to reach at least the semi-finals. 

Dementieva, in contrast, gets the chance to repeat her feat of reaching last years final at Flushing Meadow. Then she lost to compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova and this time she could face another Russian, with top seed Maria Sharapova contesting the other semi-final against Belgian Kim Clijsters. 

It was a very tough match. I feel this is a lucky place for me, said the 23-year-old Muscovite, who saved one match point at 5-6 in the tiebreak before producing a backhand winner to take it 8-6. After last year Ive been dreaming about (the final on) Saturday night every single day so who knows? 

Davenport said of her error-strewn display: The bottomline is youve got to play better than that in a quarter final. She is a phenomenal competitor. 

Pierce, the 30-year-old who knocked out Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne in Round IV, mesmerised Mauresmo 6-4, 6-1 to reach the last four at Flushing Meadow for the first time (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). 

Pierce won the last of her two Grand Slam titles in 2000 but a new approach to her mental and physical conditioning has helped her rediscover her best form this year. 

She reached the French Open final in June and has yet to drop a set at Flushing Meadow. Its amazing, Im 30 and this is my 17th year on the tour and there are still firsts for me. Thats pretty exciting, beamed the 12th seed. 

Mauresmo must be beginning to wonder if she will ever win a Grand Slam title. 

Its a disappointment obviously, the 26-year-old said. Its hard for me when I play players who hit hard right from the start. She just played a better match than me today. 

Mary when she plays like that can beat anyone. 

Unseeded American Robby Ginepri took a more tortuous but now-familiar route into his first Grand Slam semi-final, beating Argentine eighth seed Guillermo Coria in his third successive five-set triumph in the mens singles. 

Andre Agassi, who recovered brilliantly from two sets and a break down to win against James Blake, will play Ginepri, who needed six match points to beat a dogged Coria 4-6, 6-1, 7-5, 3-6, 7-5. 

Coria, who was also seeking a place in his first semi-final at Flushing Meadow, delivered a gift to Ginepri with his 13th and 14th double-faults to close the match, after having saved five match points. 

It hasnt really sunk in yet, said an exhausted Ginepri. I think its going to hit me later tonight or even tomorrow. Im just overwhelmed right now, just exhausted. 

The world No. 46 beat 13th seed Richard Gasquet of France and No. 29 Tommy Haas of Germany in five sets in Rounds III and IV.

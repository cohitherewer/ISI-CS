 Kuala Lumpur: Australia?s request to join the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) was given unanimous support by Asia?s governing body on Wednesday.

 Australia have already asked Fifa for permission to leave the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) in order to make future World Cup qualification easier. Any move, however, will need to be formally approved by Fifa.

 ?The AFC executive committee has endorsed the wishes of Australia to join the AFC,? AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam said. ?But it has to go through the proper channels.

 The?Socceroos? could be eligible to take part in the 2007 Asian Cup in southeast Asia.

 Teresopolis: Ronaldo, out of sorts with his club Real Madrid, was given the backing of Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira on Tuesday.

 ?He just needs time to train and have a few good games,? Parreira said, as the world champions began training for Sunday?s World Cup qualifier at home to Peru. ?In a short time, he?ll once again be the Ronaldo that everyone knows.?

 Ronaldo has suffered a goal drought in the last two months. He apologised on Monday for throwing a plastic water bottle into the crowd after being verbally abused by fans during Real?s 1-0 home win over Malaga the day before.

 Parreira said: ?I?m going to talk to him. I?m certain he will be very important for us.?

 Brussels: Brussels will mark the 20th anniversary of the Heysel Stadium disaster with a 60-metre square ?sundial? sculpture incorporating a light inset for each of the 39 soccer fans who died.

 The sculpture?s designer, Frenchman Patrick Rimoux, said the stainless steel monument outside the replacement stadium for the now-demolished Heysel would incorporate Italian and Belgian stone and an English poem to mark the sorrow of the three nations. ?It?s to commemorate the tragedy and to say, ?don?t forget?,? Rimoux said.

 Toronto: Former world No. 1 Greg Norman underwent back surgery in Pittsburgh on Tuesday to alleviate the persistent pain that has made him consider retirement.

 ?I had a simple choice,? Norman said in a statement on his website. ?Either retire from the game of golf or seek any and all available means to help relieve the pain that has kept me from performing at a level that suits my standards and at the same time improves the quality of my life.?

 The 50-year-old Australian underwent a 90-minute operation at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center?s Presbyterian Hospital and expects to resume his playing schedule in three months.

 Norman, twice British Open champion, is scheduled to return to his Florida home on Wednesday where he will begin rehabilitation and physical therapy.

 ?My desire to return to competition as soon as possible,? said Norman. 

 Raleigh: World junior 400m hurdles champion Kerron Clement has ruled out running the 400m flat at August?s world championships.

 Clement recently broke Michael Johnson?s indoor 400m world record but, speaking during a teleconference from Gainesville in Florida on Tuesday, the 19-year-old said: ?I?ll just focus on one race (the hurdles).?

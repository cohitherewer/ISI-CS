Nottingham: Australia, forced to follow on for the first time in 17 years, were battling for their Ashes survival after a day laced with high drama and controversy on Saturday. 

The world champions closed the third day of the fourth Test at Trent Bridge on a 222 for four, with their backs to the wall, needing 37 more runs to avoid an innings defeat. 

Michael Clarke, missed off a routine stumping by Geraint Jones shortly before the close, was batting on 39 and Simon Katich on 24. 

England had wrapped up Australias first innings for 218 during an enthralling morning, with fast bowler Simon Jones completing a five-wicket haul to leave the touring side with a 259-run deficit. 

The Australians rediscovered their composure, reaching 155 for two at the second attempt, but moments later, captain Ricky Ponting was stomping back to the pavilion in a fury. 

Damien Martyn had prodded into the covers and called for a non-existent single. Substitute fielder Gary Pratt, on for Jones, swooped and hit the stumps directly with Ponting a yard short. 

Ponting, who had scored 48 and made a big century in the third Test to save his side, approached the umpire and firing off angry words towards Englands fielders, headed off. He also appeared to shout up at the home teams balcony, where coach Duncan Fletcher had been sitting. 

Australia have been annoyed by Englands regular use of specialist substitute fielders throughout the series, believing the home sides first-choice players often take breaks despite not being genuinely injured. 

It was later announced that Simon Jones had gone to the hospital for treatment on an injured right ankle. 

Pontings anger would have doubled 13 balls later when Martyn played back to Flintoff and snicked behind to make it 161 for four. 

But Clarke and Katich, batting with great caution, put on 61 before bad light cut 15 minutes off the day. Earlier Justin Langer, dropped on 37 by Strauss in the slips, made 61. 

Australia resumed on 99 for five in reply to the home sides 477 and tried to blaze their way back in the match, with Adam Gilchrist and Katich putting on 58 at a run a ball. 

The tactic, though, backfired as the last five wickets keeled over for 61 runs in 65 balls. Matthew Hoggard had been hammered out of the attack ? his third over went for 22 ? but Jones faced no such difficulty. 

He took two wickets in his first three balls, and three for one run in 13 deliveries en route to figures of five for 44. 

Australias only consolation came in the shape of Brett Lee, who hoisted three mid-wicket sixes, two of them out of the ground off Steve Harmison. He top-scored with 47 before Jones had him caught off an upper-cut to third man to end the innings.

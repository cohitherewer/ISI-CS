 IHF against charity tie date

Islamabad: Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) has not agreed to a suggestion made by FIH, the world governing body of the sport, to organise a charity match for Pakistan earthquake victims just ahead of the Champions Trophy in Chennai. 

The IHF has rather proposed that the match be held on December 20, two days after the six-nation tournament concludes, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. However, a decision on the date will be taken in a few days, it said. (PTI)

 High drama at Highbury

London: Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals in four minutes to guide Manchester United to a thrilling 4-2 comeback victory over champions Arsenal at Highbury on Tuesday. 

United had to play the last 21 minutes with 10 men after a red card for French defender Mikael Silvestre, but were not to be denied a famous victory that propelled them into second place in the Premier League behind runaway leaders Chelsea. 

Victory left United with 53 points and dealt a massive blow to Arsenal?s already faint hopes of retaining their title. 

Arsenal slip to third, on 51 points, and must now look to leapfrog United at the end of the season to claim the other automatic slot in next season?s Champions League. 

Captain Patrick Vieira headed Arsenal into an eighth-minute lead, Ryan Giggs levelled for United 10 minutes later with a deflected shot and Dennis Bergkamp, in outstanding form, restored Arsenal?s lead before the break. 

But Ronaldo?s goals in the 54th and 58th minutes, along with an 88th-minute strike by substitute John O?Shea, completed a United double over the champions after Arsenal?s record 49-match unbeaten league run ended in a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford in October. 

In the night?s other games, Liverpool won 2-1 at Charlton Athletic, Bolton Wanderers beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-1, Portsmouth were 2-1 winners against Middlesbrough and 10-man Crystal Palace drew 2-2 at West Bromwich Albion. 

The showcase game though was at Highbury, where a rampant United had both the determination and the finishing needed to inflict another defeat on their bitter rivals. 

Vieira, who had a verbal spat with United skipper Roy Keane in the tunnel before kick-off, put Arsenal in front after beating Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze to a Thierry Henry corner. 

It was an ideal start for the Arsenal skipper, who was sent off when these two sides met in September 2003 for a 0-0 draw which led to four teammates being banned following a fracas after the final whistle. 

Giggs soon checked the euphoria of the Highbury crowd when a Sol Campbell clearance was charged down by Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney flicked the ball into the Welshman?s path and his shot flew in off Ashley Cole. 

Arsenal rolled with the punch and hit back in the 36th minute when Thierry Henry laid the ball off for Bergkamp and the Dutchman rifled his angled shot between ?keeper Roy Carroll?s legs. 

Though both sides continued at full throttle after the break, it was United who came out on top as Ronaldo?s two-goal salvo floored the champions. 

He finished off a fine three-man move involving Rooney and Giggs with a shot into the far corner and then tapped in at the far post after ?keeper Manuel Almunia rashly tried to block Ryan Giggs on the edge of his area. 

The rout, and Arsenal?s first home league defeat since May 2003, was completed when O?Shea chipped Almunia. 

Meanwhile, the English FA will take no action against Arsenal or Manchester United over the tunnel incident. 

Television cameras caught Keane furiously shouting and pointing at Vieira in the tunnel as the players walked out for the start. 

Referee Graham Poll was forced to intervene. 

United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports later that Vieira had started the latest bout of trouble between the two clubs. 

The FA said in a statement that Poll was satisfied he had dealt with the incident at the time. 

?We have received a report from referee Graham Poll following last night?s Arsenal versus Manchester United Premier League fixture in relation to an incident in the tunnel prior to the match,? the FA said. 

?He has confirmed that he is satisfied that he dealt with the incident at the time. Therefore no further action is required.? 

Neville played down the verbal spat, telling the Manchester Evening News: ?There was nothing on our part in the tunnel. It was just a case of they were a little bit wound up. That is not a criticism.? 

United?s victory moved them into second place behind leaders Chelsea and probably ended Arsenal?s hopes of retaining their title. 

Neville said both sides were to blame for some fiery moments in a frenetic game that had been hyped into overdrive after the infamous pizza-throwing melee at Old Trafford following United?s controversial 2-0 victory in October that ended Arsenal?s 49-match unbeaten league run. 

?There were a couple of our players who might be disappointed with themseleves and I am sure there will be a couple of their players who will be disappointed with themselves,? he said. 

?It seemed in the first half that everybody was trying to get the better of everybody else and it wasn?t played in a fair manner. 

?They (Arsenal) might think it wasn?t played in a fair manner at Old Trafford but we never set out to play it in anything other than a fair manner.?

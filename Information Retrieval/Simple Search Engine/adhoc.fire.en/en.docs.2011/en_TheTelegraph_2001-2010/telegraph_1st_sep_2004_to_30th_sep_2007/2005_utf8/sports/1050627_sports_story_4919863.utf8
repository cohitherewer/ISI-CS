 Flintoff, Strauss set up 5-wkt win 

 - Its an England-Australia final 

 Flintoff claims one of his victims on Sunday 

Leeds: Andrew Strauss made 98 and Andrew Flintoff took four for 29 as England swept past Bangladesh with five wickets to spare in Sundays tri-series duel to set up a title-clash with Australia. Flintoff mixed accuracy and a couple of perfect yorkers to restrict Bangladesh to 208 for seven at Headingley. The allrounder took four for 29. 

Strauss needed eight for his century with seven runs left to win. The left-hander clouted a leg-side six off-spinner Manjural Islam Rana. Needing another boundary, he charged down the wicket and was bowled. 

Bangladesh were only in the game for 20 overs when they were 89 for one. Ten overs later, they were 113 for four. (Reuters)

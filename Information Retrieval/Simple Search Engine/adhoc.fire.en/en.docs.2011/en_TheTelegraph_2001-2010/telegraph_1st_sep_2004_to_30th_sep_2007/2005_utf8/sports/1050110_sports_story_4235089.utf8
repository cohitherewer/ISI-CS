New York: Vijai Singh?s flying start to the new season continued Saturday, firing a four-under 69 to take a one-stroke lead over Jonathan Kaye into the final round of the $ 5.3 Mercedes Championship. 

Singh, who claimed nine events, over $ 10 million and the number one ranking from Tiger Woods last year, has carried his brilliant form into a new campaign, carding three bogey-free rounds on the Kapalua Plantation course in Hawaii to sit at 19-under after 54 holes. 

While it is not unusual to see Singh?s name at the top of the leaderboard, having Kaye nipping at the Fijian?s heels ahead of some of golf?s biggest names is a bit of surprise. 

Having qualified for the elite 31-player winners only field with a victory at last year?s Phoenix Open, the 34-year-old American has made the most of his chance, shooting up the standings with a seven-under 66. 

South Africa?s Ernie Els will go into the final round two strokes off the pace after carding a third round five-under 68 with Stewart Cink another shot adrift. 

Defending champion Stuart Appleby of Australia continued to claw his way back into contention with a seven-under 66 to join Canadian Mike Weir four shots back at 15-under. 

Despite continuing problems with his putter and another up and down round of four-under 69, Woods remained within striking distance five shots back. 

And despite enjoying a flawless tournament, Singh has been unable to pull away from the field and will need to make more birdies to add to his 24 career titles. 

?I just couldn?t get it to the hole,? said Singh, who has won 11 straight events when leading after 54 holes.

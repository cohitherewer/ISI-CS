The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Same squad named

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: The newly constituted national selection committee, which held its first meeting on Tuesday, decided to retain the same squad for the second Test in Delhi. Since there wasnt much action here, we decided not to effect any changes, chief selector Kiran More said. 

It was decided that V.R.V. Singh, whose injury cost him a place in the one-day side and is now undergoing rehab, will join the squad in Delhi. 

The selectors will be watching Ranji Trophy matches before assembling in Delhi on the last two days to select the side for the third Test in Ahmedabad.

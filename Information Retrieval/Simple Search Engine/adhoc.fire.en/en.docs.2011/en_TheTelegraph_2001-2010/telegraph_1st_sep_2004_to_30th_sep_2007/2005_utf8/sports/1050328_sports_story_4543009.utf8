The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India need 358; Pak 10 wickets

 - Afridi, Younis raise the bar for hosts 

Bangalore: A commanding performance by its top order has helped Pakistan set India a steep fourth innings target and push for a series-levelling victory in the third and final cricket Test at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium Sunday. 

A blazing half century by the swashbuckling Shahid Afridi followed by another defiant innings from vice-captain Younis Khan saw Pakistan declare their second innings at 261 for two. 

Younis, with a record-breaking double century in the first innings, was unbeaten on 84 from 98 balls while young opening batsman Yasir Hameed came into his own at the right time to anchor the visitors? second essay with a valuable 76. 

 Having conceded a first innings lead of 121 after being dismissed for 449 earlier in the day, the hosts now face a daunting target of 383 which no team has successfully chased in India so far. 

At stumps, India were 25 for no loss with Virender Sehwag on six and Gautam Gambhir on 19. Afridi (58) set up the perfect launchpad for his team with an explosive innings. Afridi and Yasir scored at a scorching pace and they shared a 91-run partnership for the first wicket in 78 balls. 

Afridi struck the fastest fifty by a Pakistani when he reached the mark in 26 balls. 

The cavalier batsman, however, was tied down by Sachin Tendulkar who ripped huge leg breaks from the bowlers? footmarks around the batsman? legs. 

Trying to break the shackles Afridi stepped out to Sachin, missed and was stumped. His 58 came in 61 minutes from 34 balls with eight fours and two sixes. 

Hameed then put on 92 runs for the second wicket with Younis Khan before he was adjudged leg before wicket to Anil Kumble. 

Thereafter, captain Inzamam-ul Haq (31 not out), who his 184 in the first knock, and Younis drilled a few boundaries that had the Indians completely on the mat. 

If Inzamam was on the ball from the outset, pulling Kumble disdainfully to mid-wicket fence, Younis was audacious in playing a reverse sweep-drive against India?s leading wicket-taker. The shot also brought up the team?s 250 in the 49th over. The duo brought up their 50-run stand in mere 45 balls. 

Earlier, VVS Laxman struck a timely 79 and shared a 50-run partnership with Kumble for the last wicket that helped the hosts reduce the deficit to 121. Resuming at 379 for six, India were 396 for nine at one stage after losing three wickets for 10 runs in the morning. 

Danish Kaneria picked up his 10th five-wicket haul for figures of five for 125 as he sliced through the Indian tail. 

Shaharyar to inspect 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan would personally inspect the Kotla in Delhi which is slated to host the sixth and last one-day International on April 17. 

?I am going to Delhi tomorrow. I will have a look myself to see how the situation is,? he said on Sunday. 

The PCB chief said he expected the tie to go ahead 

at the same venue as planned, though, he had heard about the match being shifted 

to Faridabad in case the stadium was not given the necessary clearance.

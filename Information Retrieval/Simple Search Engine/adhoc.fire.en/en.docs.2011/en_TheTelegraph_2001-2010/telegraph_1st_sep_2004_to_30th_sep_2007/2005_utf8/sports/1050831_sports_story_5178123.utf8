 Bhupathi, Paes hope to salvage pride

New York: Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes, who have not gone past the quarter finals of any Grand Slam doubles events this season, would be hoping for a reversal of fortunes as they gear up for the last major of the year at Flushing Meadow. 

Paes, who reached the doubles final here last year with Czech partner David Rikl, will be hoping to go one better with Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic this time. They are seeded No. 5 and will face Americans Amer Delic and Jeff Morrison in their opening match later this week. 

Bhupathi and Czech Martin Damm, seeded No. 7, have been drawn to meet French pair Gael Monfils and Cyril Saulnier in the first round.

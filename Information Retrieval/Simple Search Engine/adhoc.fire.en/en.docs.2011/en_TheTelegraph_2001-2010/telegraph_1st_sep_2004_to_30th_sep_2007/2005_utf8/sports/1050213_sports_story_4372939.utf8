 Fransa raring to go

Margao: Following their two successive wins over Mohun Bagan and Dempo, Fransa Pax FC are all charged up to take on injury-hit Sporting Clube de Goa in a NFL match to be played here on Sunday. 

Sporting missed four matches after their team met with an accident in Calcutta after playing against Mohun Bagan. 

K. Jithesh and Rajesh Meetei are still nursing injuries and will not start on against Fransa. (PTI)

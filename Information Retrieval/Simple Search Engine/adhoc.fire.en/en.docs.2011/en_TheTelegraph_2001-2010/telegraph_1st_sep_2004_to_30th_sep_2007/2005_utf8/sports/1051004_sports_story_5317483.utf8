 Andrew Flintoff looms large Down Under

 Fans with masks of Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen cheer the World XI team at the Federation Square in Melbourne on Monday 

There were wonders aplenty at Melbournes Junction Oval on Sunday, where the Rest of the World edged past Victoria in an informal warm-up for Wednesdays Super Series opening one-dayer against Australia. Muttiah Muralidharan got through 10 overs without being no-balled; Shoaib Akhtar failed to fall out with his captain; and as for Kevin Pietersen, he even managed to take a catch. 

All this was warmly applauded by a crowd of 10000, who took advantage of free entry and Melbournes first balmy weekend of the summer to throng the grassy banks. Contrary to the usual practice after an Ashes defeat, when cricket is traditionally relegated to the vicinity of the small ads, the sport is big news over here at the moment. 

Such is the spirit of detente that Australias players have been heard advocating the benefits of the occasional setback ? purely for the benefit of the sport, you understand. Their leaders at Cricket Australia, meanwhile, have been distributing cardboard Andrew Flintoff masks at street corners. The marketeers reckon his guileless mug is the key to filling the 48,000-seat Telstra Dome on Wednesday night. 

For the 10000 sun-kissed fans, the day would have been perfect if Flintoff himself had been in action, rather than resting after his Ashes exploits (not to mention a heavy blow on the arm from Shoaib during Saturdays training session). In the words of Brett Lee, Flintoffs chief sparring partner through a bruising summer, the man has become a bit of a superhero over here. 

As a natural self-deprecator, too modest to be suited to his new role as Bobby Charlton and Mother Teresa rolled into one, Flintoff would have been looking forward to a couple of weeks out of the spotlight when he boarded the plane to Melbourne with his young family last week. But it can only have taken a few moments at Melbourne airport to end that ambition. 

People keep coming up to me, Lee explained on Sunday, saying, that was the most amazing series. Whats Andrew Flintoff like? Even people who dont watch cricket know about Andrew Flintoff and they always talk about how much of a sportsman he is and the way he carries himself. Thats a credit to him and his family and English cricket. 

Throughout Australia, Lee claims, cricket-mad kids are greeting every wicket with The Flintoff ? that X-shaped celebration, with feet planted wide, head thrown back and arms held aloft, that became such a signature of the 2005 Ashes. One can only wonder whether Ian Botham, in his years of Aussie-baiting in the early Eighties, achieved such heights of popularity within enemy territory. 

One key difference is that while Flintoff has challenged the undisputed world champions and overthrown them at his first attempt, Botham ? with the exception of his annus mirabilis in 1981 ? spent a lot of time subjugating inferior Australian sides. While that was hardly Bothams fault, kicking the Aussies while they were down was no way to win great popularity Down Under. 

Similarly, though Botham always played the game in an excellent spirit, he never participated in such an iconic moment of sportsmanship as Flintoffs consolation of Lee at the conclusion of Englands two-run win at Edgbaston. 

The image of the two men ? Lee brought to his knees by despair, Flintoff crouching down with one arm around his opponent ? has made two nations proud and one photographer very happy. 

The photographer actually came up to me and asked if Id sign his copy, Lee said. I said, Sure, but youll have to do me one too. In the end he made two big blow-ups, one for me and one for Andrew. He signed mine, with a joke that went, Is there any chance of you getting out while batting against me? I wrote on his, Youre a supreme athlete, its always been a pleasure, and Ive really enjoyed the last five games weve played against each other. 

Even Flintoffs new teammates have caught the mood. Attending a press conference with him on Saturday, the worlds No 2-ranked batsman, Rahul Dravid, earned a laugh by arriving in one of Cricket Australias Flintoff masks. Alongside him, the real model looked half-amused, half-embarrassed. 

Pietersen would have lapped up the attention, but Flintoff is more shirehorse than show pony. 

When his selection for this side was announced in May, he was overwhelmed with excitement, suggesting he would be taking his autograph book around a dressing room filled with the likes of Brian Lara, Jacques Kallis and so on. 

But after the last few months, Flintoffs own signature is the biggest prize of all.

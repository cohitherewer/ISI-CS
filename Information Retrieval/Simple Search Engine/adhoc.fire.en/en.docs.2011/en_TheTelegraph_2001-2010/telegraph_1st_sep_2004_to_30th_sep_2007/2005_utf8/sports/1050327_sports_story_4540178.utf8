The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sporting shock EB 3-2

 - Hosts find Man of the Match Edeh Chidi too hot to handle

Calcutta: Shocking news for some, not for coach Subhas Bhowmick. Leading 2-0 at one stage, and then 3-1 at another, Sporting Clube de Goa emerged 3-2 victors over holders East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium Saturday. Bhowmick said later: ?I told you, they have the best attacking variation in the country today?? 

Maybe Bhowmick wasn?t too surprised, but the fans were, and even the players weren?t prepared, it seemed, in their NFL match for the ONGC Cup. 

East Bengal dominated the first 25 minutes, swarming the rival defence area, Alvito D?Cunha, Climax Lawrence and Ernest Jeremiah making the best of a lapse in attention from the Sporting defence which was taking ?care? of Bhaichung Bhutia. Jeremiah did put the ball in, but was hauled up for an infringement. 

Thereafter, though, the seemingly lackadaisical Goa team, took control and Edeh Chidi became virtually unstoppable. His lazy gait was deceptive, as was his sudden acceleration and quick change of feet. 

Jeremiah was the best in the East Bengal ranks. In the ninth minute his shot was parried by Sporting ?keeper Felix D?Souza and then he drove into D?Souza a shot he could have controlled better in the 24th minute. 

Thereafter, East Bengal?s bravado was cut off. In the 33rd minute Chidi pushed into the box and dodged two defenders before running into M. Suresh, bent on a foul. The penalty was ordered and converted by Dudu Omagbemi. That took his league tally to 11 followed by Ronty Martins of Dempo at nine. 

The second goal stood a class apart. Two minutes to break, an innocuous-looking Sporting move reached the rival box. Then a sudden powerful left-footer by unmarked Adewusi Adebayo took the defence by surprise. The shot reached the far post before swerving as ?keeper Sangram Mukherjee, ahead of his charge, watched it go in. Leading 2-0, Sporting unleashed Chidi, MoM, and Dudu, even as the hosts? defence crumbled. But they too had an ace, still, up their sleeves. 

In the 51st minute Jeremiah trapped one on top of the box and his volley came off the woodwork. A lurking Syed Rahim Nabi thumped home from close. 

The reducer rejuvenated East Bengal for a while, but Chidi put cold water on the enthusiasm. He entered the box as substitute Habibur Rehman Mondal failed to intercept, the ball ballooning. Chidi collected again, and Sangram was easily drawn out of his charge. Chidi tapping in lazily from close, a last-ditch effort by Suresh failing. 

The final surge was through a relaxed Sporting defence. Nabi lobbed from the right and Bhaichung dived to head in two minutes from the time. 

East Bengal remained leaders with 27 points from 13 matches, ahead of Dempo (also 27 off 13) on more goals scored. Sporting are third, with 23 points from 13 ties.

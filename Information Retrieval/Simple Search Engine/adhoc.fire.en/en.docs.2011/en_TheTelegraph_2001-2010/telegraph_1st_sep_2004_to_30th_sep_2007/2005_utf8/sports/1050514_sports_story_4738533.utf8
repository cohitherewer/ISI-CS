 Appleby a stroke clear of Els amp; Co.

 Stuart Appleby 

Irving: Australian Stuart Appleby fired a seven-under 63 to take the first-round lead at the Byron Nelson championship on Thursday, one-shot clear of South Africas Ernie Els and Americans John Daly and Brett Wetterich. 

Appleby made a near-perfect start to the $6.2 million tournament, mixing eight birdies with a single bogey at the TPC Four Seasons Resort Las Colinas in Irving (Texas) to lead a field including the top five players in the world. 

World No. 3 Els, playing his first USPGA event since his poor showing at the Masters, was in stunning form on his return to America, carding a bogey free six-under 64. 

World No. 1 Tiger Woods, playing in just his second event since winning his fourth US Masters, battled to a one-under 69. Woods, who needs a good result to stop Fijian Vijai Singh from reclaiming the top spot, had a quiet round as he mixed an eagle with a single birdie and two bogeys. 

World No.4 Phil Mickelson also carded a 69 after an uneventful round of one birdie and 17 pars. 

Vijai Singh opened with a two-under 68 in a rollercoaster round including five bogeys and seven birdies. 

South Africas world No. 5 Retief Goosen settled for an even par 70, while Spains Sergio Garcia began the defence of his title with a one-over 71.

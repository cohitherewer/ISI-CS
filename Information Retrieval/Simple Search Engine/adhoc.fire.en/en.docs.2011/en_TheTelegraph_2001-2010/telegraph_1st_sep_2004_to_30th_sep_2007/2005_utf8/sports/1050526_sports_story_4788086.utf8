 Kimi will have his hands full

London: McLarens Kimi Raikkonen has two more cars and a host of bruised egos to deal with as he chases a third successive Formula One victory in Sundays European GP at the Nuerburgring. 

While the Finn was savouring victories in Barcelona and Monaco, Jenson Button and Takuma Sato were kicking their heels, serving out a two-race ban imposed on BAR for being underweight at the San Marino Grand Prix. 

Championship leader Fernando Alonso is determined to put Renault back on the podium after he missed out on a top-three spot for the first time this season with fourth place at Monaco. 

Seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher and Ferrari are hoping the sole Saturday qualifying format helps end their longest run without a win. 

But after three poles and two wins so far this season, Raikkonen is full of confidence. 

The car is fast and reliable, the Finn said at Monaco. 

I like the (Nuerburgring), last year we were reasonably okay with the old car, which wasnt very quick ... So lets see what happens. (Reuters)

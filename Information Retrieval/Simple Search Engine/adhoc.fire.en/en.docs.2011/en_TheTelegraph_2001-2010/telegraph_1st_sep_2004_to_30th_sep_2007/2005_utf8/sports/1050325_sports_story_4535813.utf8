The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rohan to represent Bengal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar (and not present skipper Devang Gandhi) will represent Bengal in the Ranji Trophy annual captains? and coaches? meeting to be held in Mumbai on April 11. 

Gavaskar left charge after Bengal?s last Ranji Trophy match against Madhya Pradesh and Devang Gandhi stepped in. 

?Since Rohan was our captain in the Ranji Trophy, he along with coach Karsan Ghavri will attend the April 11 review meeting,? CAB joint secretary Bablu Kolay told The Telegraph on Thursday. ?Devang was made the captain for the national one-dayers,? Kolay added. 

The meeting has been held annually over the last few years to get feedback from the captains and coaches about the conduct of various domestic tournaments, especially their views on umpiring, pitches, formats and scheduling of meets. 

The BCCI has scheduled the meeting, taking advantage of the fact that quite a few teams? captains would be in Mumbai around that time to take part in the April 8-14 all India one-day tournament. No match has been scheduled for April 11.

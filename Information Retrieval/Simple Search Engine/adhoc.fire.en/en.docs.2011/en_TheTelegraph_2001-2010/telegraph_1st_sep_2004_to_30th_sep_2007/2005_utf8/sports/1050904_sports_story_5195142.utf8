 ZCU crisis

Harare: A looming contracts crisis between Zimbabwe Cricket Union and its players could abort the forthcoming Test series against India later this month. 

The ZCU has given us September 14 as the date by which they should be able to work out on the contentious issues, said Clive Field, a representative of the Zimbabwe Players Cricket Association (ZPCA). 

ZCU, on Wednesday, announced it would offer extension of contract to only three of the 10 players from the past season. The rest would be on monthly retainer basis as they havent performed up to the expectations.

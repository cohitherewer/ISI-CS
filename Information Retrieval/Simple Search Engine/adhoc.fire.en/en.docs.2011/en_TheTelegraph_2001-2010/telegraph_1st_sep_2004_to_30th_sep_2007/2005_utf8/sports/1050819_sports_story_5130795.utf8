Amstelveen: Ignominy seems to follow India with their third successive defeat, to arch-rivals Pakistan 1-3 in their last league match of the eight-nation Rabo Trophy Hockey tournament here on Thursday. 

India already out of the medal race, were desperate for a win against their arch-rivals which could have salvaged some pride for the beleagured team. 

The win, however, kept Pakistan on course for a chance to qualify for the finals, while India, who had lost to Spain and Germany earlier, would now probably play for the 7-8 place. 

Muhammed Saqlain (15th ) drew the first blood for Pakistan and Imran Muhammed supplemented it in the 30th minute. India reduced the margin by Didar Singhs effort in the 56th minute. But the final strike by Shakeel Abbas earned Pakistan full points. 

Pakistan took their points tally to four from this win, with one match against Germany still to go. The side had drawn their opening match against Spain. Meanwhile India failed to open their account. 

India had a very impressive beginning and dominated the game with some fine moves early in the game and in created some good chances. In the first eight minutes, they earned two penalty corners, but could not take advantage as Kanwalpreet Singh and captain Dilip Tirkey failed to sound the board. 

India played well in patches, but the forwards again cut a sorry figure to add to the misery of the team. 

The second session saw India at their confused best as unforced errors galore. Their was no co-ordination on the link flanks manned by Davinder Pal Singh and Prabhdeep Singh with Rasquinha, Ignace Tirkey and Bimal Lakra. 

Even Arjun Halappa and Prabhjot made heavy weather of this encounter. 

India managed to put one across however after Didar worked his way in from the right flank, winning a penalty corner which he dragflicked home, thus raising some hopes of recovery. (PTI)

 United chief says Ferguson ?sackable?

 - No knee-jerk reaction to coach issue 

TIM RICH 

 Ferguson is under pressure 

All careers are finite and Tuesday Sir Alex Ferguson was, however inadvertently, reminded that his time as manager of Manchester United had its limits. 

As the club?s chief executive, David Gill, attempted to explain a 53 per cent fall in United?s half-yearly profits to ? 12.4 million, he remarked that Ferguson was ?sackable?. 

On one level this is a statement of the obvious. Every football manager, however great his achievements, must be held accountable. If Vicente del Bosque could be removed from his post at Real Madrid days after winning La Liga and a year after capturing the European Cup, then every manager is vulnerable, even one who has brought 16 trophies to Old Trafford. 

However, that it was said at all, albeit after persistent questioning by a radio interviewer and subsequently retracted, is significant, as is Gill?s view that how long Ferguson continues in a post he has held since 1986 is ultimately a matter for the Manchester United board. 

In an interview with a Portuguese magazine, Ferguson speculated, no doubt whimsically, about carrying on until his eighties, in the manner of one of his heroes, the business magnate, Armand Hammer. 

Gill told BBC Radio Five: ?He is sackable. We live in a very pressurised sport. The pressure will be on next season and we wouldn?t want it not to be there. But it would be detrimental to the club to make a knee-jerk reaction to not winning the League for a second season in a row.? 

?There is nothing in our plans about changing the manager. That issue has not even been discussed,? he said. ?For now we have great plans to work together.? Gill added that Ferguson would be consulted on the choice of successor, but the final decision would be the board?s. 

By using the word ?sackable? and opening the debate, Manchester United have at least avoided the embarrassment foisted on the Newcastle chairman, Freddy Shepherd, who claimed last summer that, ?you do not sack Sir Bobby Robson?, before messily firing him a mere four games into the season. 

Nevertheless, Ferguson?s position at Old Trafford is weaker than it was at its zenith in May 2001 when, backed by United?s fans, he faced down the board over a new contract and an agreed position after his soon-to-be-postponed retirement. 

In the past four years, Ferguson has spent more than ? 150 million on players and delivered one Premiership title and one FA Cup, while since losing the European Cup semi-final to Bayer Leverkusen in 2002, each campaign in the Champions League has been worse than the last. 

The great goal spurring Ferguson on is to win the European Cup a second time which he believes would match United?s status in the game and eclipse Sir Matt Busby?s record. United?s defeat to AC Milan this month left him as downcast as many seasoned observers could remember.

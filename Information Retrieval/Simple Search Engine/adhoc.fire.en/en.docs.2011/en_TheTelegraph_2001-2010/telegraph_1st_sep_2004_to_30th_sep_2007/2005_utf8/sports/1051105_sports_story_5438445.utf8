 Beijing: The mascot of the 2008 Beijing Olympics will be unveiled on November 11 for which the highly endangered Tibetan antelope and the giant panda seem to be the front-runners. The unveiling date also marks the 1,000-day countdown to the opening ceremony of the Games, which will start at 8 pm on August 8, 2008.

 Similar to when the slogan of the 2008 Games ?One World, One Dream? was unveiled, a gala show will be put on at the workers? indoor arena.

 Besides the Tibetan antelope and giant panda, the other major candidates are the Chinese tiger, the golden monkey and the red-crowned crane. 

 Berrien Springs (Michigan): Muhammad Ali was treated for a back and neck condition, and is undergoing follow-up physical therapy.

 The former heavyweight boxing champion, treated at Emory University in Atlanta, will return to his regular routine of public appearances when therapy is completed, Ali spokesman Craig Bankey said on Thursday.

 Ali will be at the grand opening of the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, on November 19, Bankey said in a statement. Ali?s office was responding to recent published reports concerning his health. The 63-year-old Ali has Parkinson?s Disease.

 San Francisco: A US grand jury in San Francisco on Thursday indicted Illinois chemist Patrick Arnold, 39, suspected of supplying a previously undetectable steroid to the Balco lab in a global scandal that tarnished some top names in sport.

 Arnold was indicted on three counts, including conspiracy to distribute steroids with Balco head Victor Conte, as well as the introduction and delivery of THG.

 Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona met Argentina football association (AFA) chief Julio Grondona on Thursday to discuss a possible role with the national team but said he did not want to tread on anybody?s toes.

 The surprise meeting was held at the AFA?s headquarters amid rumours that coach Jose Pekerman could resign if Maradona was given a position of power on the national team staff.

 ?I haven?t come to tread on anyone?s toes and I want this to be made quite clear,? Maradona said after the meeting. 

 Zagreb: Croatia forward Ivan Klasnic will be sidelined for a month after having his appendix out, according to newspaper reports on Friday. 

 ?Klasnic, who started to feel pain before Werder Bremen?s Champions League game against Udinese, underwent surgery on Thursday and will not be available for four weeks,? the paper said.

 Croatia, who have qualified for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany, play a friendly against Portugal in Coimbra on November 12 and Klasnic?s absence means a shortage of strikers.

 Melbourne: Former Japan striker Kazuyoshi Miura has joined Australia?s Sydney FC on a short-term contract, the A-League side said on Friday. The 38-year-old earned 91 caps for Japan and is a former Asian Player of the Year.

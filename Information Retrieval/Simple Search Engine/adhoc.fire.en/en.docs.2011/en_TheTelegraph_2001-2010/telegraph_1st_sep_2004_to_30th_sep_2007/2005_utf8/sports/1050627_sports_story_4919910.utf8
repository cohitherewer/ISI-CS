 Teenaged quartet a threat to old order

 - The class of 2005 leaves its mark on Wimbledon

Two young Frenchmen, a Scot and a Spaniard are threatening to overturn the old, established order in the mens game. 

Two teenagers took to the Wimbledon courts at tea-time on Saturday. One had his mother informing the nation of her sons love for bruschetta, chicken pizza and untidy bedrooms, the other was Richard Gasquet. 

Andy Murray strode on to Centre Court as if hed owned it all along, Gasquets arrival on Court 13 was utterly low-key, more Mantovani than Black Eyed Peas. And if Rafael Nadal did not last long enough to further his growing love affair with grasscourts and Gael Monfils met, in Mario Ancic, a student a year or two closer to graduation, the class of 2005 has already left its mark on this years Wimbledon. 

This promises to be some crop. For long sweeps of Saturday afternoon, Gasquet and Murray, the French prodigy and the Scottish boy wonder, seemed destined for an unlikely meeting in the last-16 of Wimbledon. Only Gasquet will make the rendezvous. 

It was almost as if Gasquet and Murray were attached by string, so similar was the early course of their matches. First Murray, the precocious young man from Dunblane, took the opening set against David Nalbandian on a tie-break; a few minutes later Gasquet, manouevring Gilles Muller ? Nadals second-round conqueror ? around the court with the skill of a puppeteer won his tie-break. Both forged through the second set before the parting of the ways. 

Gasquet turned 19 last week; Nadal earlier this month. Murray and Monfils are both 18. In the context of Boris Beckers victory here at the age of 17 years and 227 days 20 years ago, they are already elder statesmen; in the eyes of ordinary mortals they represent a clear vision of the future and of a significant shift in the balance of power within tennis. Two Frenchmen, a Scot and a Spaniard are hardly representatives of the traditional powerhouses of the game. In Australia and America, the inquests have already begun. 

On Friday, Monfils ? who won three of the four junior Grand Slams last year ? could be found facing a desultory collection of inquisitors in the main interview room. What, he was asked, is the main difference between playing in the juniors and the seniors? Pause for thought. 

Its here, he said, pointing to his temple, in the head. The point was reinforced from the same seat almost a day later by Nalbandian. 

In the seniors, I am losing more, he reflected. When I was in juniors I was playing so good and I think maybe I was a little more confident. But it was the same in the juniors when I was ranked 40 I was losing. This year, I dont talk about losing or winning, its just learn and see what I have to do to be the best maybe next year or two years after that. 

Monfils left school to train at the National Sports Institute, but for the past two years he has been based at Paris Jean Bouin club, owned and financed by the French industrialist, Arnaud Lagardere. 

Gasquet, one of Monfils closest friends, could not be more different, a product of provincial small town France, the son of two tennis teachers and blessed with such transparent ability he was featured on the cover of the major French tennis magazine as an eight-year-old. 

In terms of mental and physical development, Nadal has already crossed the great divide, though not yet on grass. He showed an astonishing maturity not just in sweeping through the claycourt season, but in successfully shouldering the expectations his form demanded. 

Monfils has Murrays build; Gasquet is shorter and stockier, but all four are playing a modern, all-court, style of tennis adaptable to clay, hard courts and, lastly, the grass. 

Monfils went to the net once in three sets against Ancic; Gasquet too is in the Murray mould, preferring to counter-punch. But, in a strange network of friendships, which stretches from Gasquet through Monfils to Murray and Nadal, they drive each other forward. 

My goal for Gael, says his coach, is that he will become a complete player in three years. By then, he will reach a level he can maintain. He can still grow and fill out. 

Murray and Gasquet have grown before our eyes.

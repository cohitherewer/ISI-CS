Los Angeles: Defending champion Maria Sharapova beat Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals of the WTA Championships late on Thursday. 

However, Davenport has already qualified for the semis, from the Green group in the elite eight-woman round robin competition. 

I knew before the match started that I was in, said Davenport. It was a bizarre feeling walking out. It was hard. There are no ranking points, no extra money, nothing like that. Thats a shame. But when I started losing, pride hit me. 

Frances Amelie Mauresmo and Mary Pierce have qualified from the Black group. 

Mauresmo scored a 6-2, 6-3 win over Russias Elena Dementieva and has a 2-0 record after an earlier victory over world number two Kim Clijsters. Pierce also stands 2-0 after defeating Clijsters and Dementieva. 

Clijsters, who came into the week hoping to seize the number one ranking from Davenport, cannot reach the semis, handing the year-end top spot to Davenport. 

Davenport finished the round robin with a 2-1 record, while Switzerlands Patty Schnyder and Russias Nadia Petrova, who Davenport beat earlier, were knocked out of the competition. 

Schnyder defeated Petrova 6-0, 5-7, 6-4 on Thursday, but finished with a 1-2 record, having fallen to Sharapova and Davenport. 

Petrova holds a 0-2 record going into her Friday match against Sharapova, who has a 2-0 record, so the contest will be a formality. 

Sharapova came into her match against Davenport with a 2-1 edge over the American, but had suffered an embarrassing 6-0, 6-0 defeat to Davenport the last time they played at Indian Wells. 

She stuttered near the end of the second set, failing to serve the match out at 5-4 when Davenport forced her into a forehand error. 

Sharapova then went into a brief mental funk and was broken to love to lose the set when she erred on another forehand. 

In the third set, the 18-year old regained the spring in her step and took it to the 29-year old, breaking Davenport to 3-2 on a sharply angled forehand across the court. 

On her third match point, Sharapova gunned her 13th ace to seal the contest.

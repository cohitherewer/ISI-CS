 Gagan Ajit captain

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

Chennai: Gagan Ajit Singh was named captain of the Indian hockey team for the forthcoming Champions Trophy tournament to be held here from December 10 to 18. 

Gagan Ajit replaces veteran defender Dilip Tirkey who was originally named captain. Tirkeys illness forced the Indian Hockey Federation to appoint a new captain. 

Tirkey said on Tuesday that it was his bad luck that he would not be a part of the event. I am very disappointed to miss out. Its bad luck as I was very eager to play before the home crowd, Tirkey said. 

Tirkey picked up a sinus aggravation during his Dutch league assignment and was ruled out on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, Doordarshan will telecast live all the matches. The national broadcasters will also provide uplinking facility to TEN Sports, the official broadcasters of FIH for the tournament. (PTI)

 Sachs to hear Sourav case

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council on Tuesday appointed Justice Albie Sachs to hear the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias dispute regarding the process used to deal with captain Sourav Gangulys appeal under the ICC Code of Conduct. 

According to a ICC release, Justice Sachs will sit as the sole member of a ICC disputes resolution committee. Over the coming days the South African constitutional court judge will consider the format and time-frame of the hearing. 

Justice Sachs will deal with a number of technical issues raised by the BCCI in relation to the process by which the charge and the appeal were heard. 

Sourav was banned for six one-day Internationals for the teams slow over-rate after the match versus Pakistan in Ahmedabad on April 12. His appeal against the ban was turned down by ICCs appeals commissioner Michael Beloff. 

Sourav requested for an oral hearing but Beloff ruled that arguments presented in text were enough to make a judgement. The ICC Code of Conduct states, the decision of the appeals commissioner shall be final and binding. 

The terms of reference for the disputes resolution committee state: Unless the disputes committee determines otherwise, the procedure shall comprise written submissions from the parties and, if the disputes committee deems it appropriate, an oral hearing. 

Justice Sachs is South Africas nominated representative on the ICC Code of Conduct commission. His decision will be final and binding on the parties.

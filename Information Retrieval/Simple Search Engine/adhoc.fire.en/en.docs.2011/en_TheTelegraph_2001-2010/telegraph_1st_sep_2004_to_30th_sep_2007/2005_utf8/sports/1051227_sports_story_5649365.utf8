 Pakistan to play 2 Tests, 3 ODIs 

Karachi: Pakistan will play two Tests and three one-day Internationals next March and April in Sri Lanka, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Monday. 

We have received the itinerary from the Sri Lankans. The Tests have been proposed in Colombo and Kandy and the one-dayers in Dambulla and Colombo, director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf said. 

Pakistan were originally scheduled to play only five one-dayers in Sri Lanka in April. 

But due to the postponement of the Asia Cup which was to have been held in Pakistan in February 16 to February 28/March 1, the two boards have agreed to add two Tests to the tour. 

In the proposed itinerary, Pakistan reach Colombo on March 12 with the one-dayers on the 18, 20 and 23 followed by the Tests in Colombo and Kandy from March 31 and April 8.

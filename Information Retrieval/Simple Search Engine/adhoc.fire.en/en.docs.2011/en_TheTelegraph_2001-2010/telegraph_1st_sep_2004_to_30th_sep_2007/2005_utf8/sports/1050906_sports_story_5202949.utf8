The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chappell talks of positives 

The tearaway had been unplayable (six for 19) in the opener. He was rested for the return match, which India won by six wickets last Friday. 

Most Team India well-wishers are concerned over the failure of Sourav and vice-captain Rahul Dravid (even Virender Sehwag), but Chappell is looking at the positives. 

I know the most experienced batsmen havent got runs, but the law of averages could work in their favour. Right now, Id rather talk of the positives ? for example, the maturity of the middle-order, he remarked. 

Sourav has just managed 46, while the usually supremely reliable Dravid has totalled 64. Sehwag, who missed one game, has collected 72 ? with a quickfire 45 as his best. 

The positives include 24-carat centuries by Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh ? in demanding situations ? and excellent fifties by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

It was a lost cause, but Jai Prakash Yadavs statement-making 69 in the opener, the highest by any No. 9 in ODIs, cant be ignored either. 

The bowling hasnt exactly been consistent, but Ajit Agarkars efforts have surely extended his career. 

Yesterdays MoM Yuvraj had kind words for Chappell (and sports scientist Ian Frazer), but the coach isnt taking any credit for the Punjab star cracking two centuries in his last six innings. 

The gifted middle-order bat, who will soon complete five years of international cricket, required 106 innings to get his first two centuries. 

Yuvraj has been generous? Hes the one who has scored and done the hard work? He deserves all the praise? At best, Ive helped lift his confidence? Given him positive thoughts, Chappell pointed out. 

Sourav, too, could do with positive thoughts. He hasnt fired for ages ? in fact, his last ODI century was in the 2003 World Cup semi-final versus Kenya ? and, as he accepted last evening, must continue to fight it out. 

The next match, perhaps, is going to be my game, Sourav quipped at the presentation ceremony after the win over Zimbabwe. 

Lets hope so.

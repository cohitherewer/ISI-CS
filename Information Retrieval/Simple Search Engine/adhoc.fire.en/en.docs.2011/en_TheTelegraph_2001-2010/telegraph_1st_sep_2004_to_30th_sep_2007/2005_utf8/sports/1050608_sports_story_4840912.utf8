The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Two-horse race with Paris as the front-runner

 - 2012 Olympics Londons use of existing world-class 

 venues praised 

 ASHLING CONNOR 

 Chairman of the 

 London 2012 Olympic bid, Sebastian Coe, answers questions 

 at a news conference in London on Tuesday. (Reuters) 

 The unfolding story of who will 

 host the 2012 Olympic Games turned into a tale of two cities 

 on Monday after a crucial report by assessors from the International 

 Olympic Committee (IOC) found little to separate London 

 and Paris.

 A month before the decisive ballot 

 in Singapore, the rival capitals emerged as the strongest 

 contenders in a 119-page document intended as a guide for 

 the 117 IOC members eligible to vote. The three remaining 

 candidate cities, Moscow, New York and Madrid, saw their 

 chances of success slip.

 Thirteen months after Lord (Sebastian) 

 Coe took over from Barbara Cassani as bid leader, London 

 has addressed IOC concerns over transport, venues and government 

 backing and turned itself into a credible choice. Coe, a 

 double Olympic champion, said that the report was a springboard 

 for continued campaigning in the run-up to the vote on July 

 6.

 A lot of hard work has paid 

 off, he said. This was never going to be the 

 management of Itll Be Alright On The Night. 

 This was choreographed to within an inch of its life.

 The report was written after a 

 four-day site visit in February by an IOC evaluation commission 

 led by Nawal El Moutawakel, who won 400m hurdles gold for 

 Morocco in 1984. 

 During the visit, made necessary 

 by strict IOC rules on ethics after the Salt Lake City bribery 

 scandal in 2000, the team was whisked around present and 

 proposed venues and driven in Range Rovers through the Channel 

 Tunnel rail link between Stratford and St Pancras to illustrate 

 the transport blueprint.

 The impact of the carefully planned 

 tour was evident in the report, the first of its kind for 

 an Olympic bidding process. An interim IOC assessment last 

 May condemned Londons transport system as often 

 obsolete.

 This time, the evaluators noted 

 substantial investment in transport that, if delivered as 

 promised, would meet Olympic requirements. They also accepted 

 estimated bus speeds and journey times, an area of dispute 

 at the interim stage. 

 London would be capable 

 of coping with Games-time traffic, they said.

 The report praised Londons 

 use of existing world-class venues such as Wimbledon for 

 tennis and Dorney Lake, Eton, for rowing. Twenty-two venues 

 will be within 28 minutes of the Olympic village in East 

 London.

 The biggest caveat attached to 

 praise for London concerned the fact that much of the bid 

 is still a paper vision compared with Paris. Thirty-six 

 per cent of venues need to be built, including an 80,000-seat 

 Olympic Stadium. 

 In the context of the saga that 

 is the rebuilding of Wembley Stadium, which would host the 

 Olympic football final, the concerns about Londons 

 ability to deliver the worlds biggest sporting event 

 are clear.

 The magnitude of the project, 

 including the planned upgrade and expansion of transport 

 infrastructure, would require careful planning to ensure 

 all facilities and rehabilitation projects were completed 

 on time, the report said.

 Paris received no real criticism, 

 veiled or otherwise, with its report littered with adjectives 

 such as excellent and exemplary. 

 The city has proven experience of hosting similar events, 

 including the football World Cup in 1998.

 Paris also has stronger public 

 support, according to the last official IOC poll, with 85 

 per cent of the citys population in favour and 79 

 per cent elsewhere in France. Londons support was 

 68 per cent in the city and 70 per cent outside, but has 

 improved since the poll in December, according to independent 

 research.

 The undertones of the evaluation 

 teams report suggest Paris is the safer bet, but IOC 

 members are in no way bound by its findings. National allegiances 

 and the order in which the five cities are eliminated in 

 each voting round are key. 

 The Latin American countries, 

 whose first vote would probably have gone to Madrid, could 

 provide the vital swing.

 Paris is still the bookmakers 

 favourite. Ladbrokes have cut their odds from 5-1 on to 

 6-1 on, with London maintained at 7-2. Madrid, ranked second 

 by the IOC ? ahead of London ? at the interim stage, drifted 

 from 12-1 to 16-1, New York from 20-1 to 33-1 and Moscow 

 from 66-1 to the 100-1 rank outsider.

 It is a two-horse race, 

 with Paris the strong front-runner, a Ladbrokes spokesman 

 said. London can be encouraged, however, that favourites 

 have a bad record of securing the Games. The odds now suggest 

 that Madrid, New York and Moscow are all but out of the 

 race.

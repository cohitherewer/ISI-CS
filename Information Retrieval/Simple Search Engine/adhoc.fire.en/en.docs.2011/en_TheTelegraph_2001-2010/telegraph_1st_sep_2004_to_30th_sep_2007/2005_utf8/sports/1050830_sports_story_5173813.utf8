The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Federer should sail through to 2nd 

 title

 Five-week lay-off only chink in Federer?s 

 armour.

 The tennis juggernaut rolls on 

 across the Atlantic. A giant leap from the frugal servings 

 of strawberries and cream at the Wimbledon to the mountains 

 of hot dogs, burgers, pizzas etc. The US Open is a son 

 et lumiere of unrestrained raucous, vibrant American 

 culture. Animals is what the five-time champion 

 Jimmy Connors affectionately calls the spectators.

 The atmosphere satiates a gladiatorial 

 streak in the spectators just short of the thumbs down. 

 Ramesh Krishnan sums it up by saying you get the feeling 

 that any moment anything can happen ? perhaps a bunch of 

 brawling spectators will fall over you on the courts.

 In this mayhem, Roger Federer, 

 the reigning champion and the No. 1 seed, on the threshold 

 of being acclaimed as the greatest of all time, seems set 

 to sail through to his second title. A five-week lay-off 

 due to a foot injury is the only chink in Federers 

 armour.

 Just one tournament in Cincinnati, 

 which Federer won convincingly, may not be adequate preparation 

 for the trying two weeks of best-of-five set ordeals of 

 a Grand Slam. His main challenger would have been the volatile 

 and unpredictable Russian Marat Safin, but he has been forced 

 to withdraw with a knee injury.

 The resolve and tenacity of Australian 

 Lleyton Hewitt should see him through to the semis. Nadal 

 and Roddick are in the lower half of the draw. On the fast 

 courts of Flushing Meadow, with vocifeorus crowd support, 

 Roddick will enjoy an edge over Nadal, who is at his best 

 on slower surfaces.

 After Federer, the other seeds 

 seem to be a mediocre lot and there is little chance, if 

 any, of an exciting rivalry developing in the near future 

 like the one between Sampras-Agassi or Connors-McEnroe. 

 The mens game has lost its lustre in the shadow of 

 Federers genius.

 In the womens draw, the 

 main contenders read like a casualty list. Recalling the 

 injuries most of them have recovered from would provide 

 a lesson on anatomy. Anyone of Sharapova, Davenport, the 

 Williams sisters, Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters and Mauresmo 

 could win if they are absolutely fit and can last the fortnight 

 without injury.

 Paying heed to rankings, 19-year-old 

 Sharapova seems the freshest and the least injured of the 

 lot. On form, Davenport is the best, but she has the tendency 

 to break down in the final stages, like she did in the final 

 against Venus Williams at Wimbledon.

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The AFC grounds inspection committee on Tuesday visited a number of grounds in and around the city as part of their process to identify venues for next years Under-19 Asian Meet. 

The centre of attention, however, was the three-member teams visit to the Salt Lake Stadium. A few minutes past noon, when they entered the stadium, it was already decked up for the stage show of Kallol.

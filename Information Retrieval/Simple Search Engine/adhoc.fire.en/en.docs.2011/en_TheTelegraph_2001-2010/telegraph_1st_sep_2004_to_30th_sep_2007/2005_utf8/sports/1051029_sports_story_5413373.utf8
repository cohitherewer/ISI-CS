New Delhi: Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant showed the kind of form which has taken him to the top of the Asian Tour Order of Merit this year by taking the second round lead in the Hero Honda Indian Open Golf Championship here on Friday. 

The 39-year old struck a round of six-under-par 66 to lead by a stroke from Gerald Rosales from the Philippines, in with a 67, while Harmeet Kahlon kept the tricolour flying high with an impressive 64 at the $300,000 event. 

First round leader Anura Rohana from Sri Lanka fell back with a 75. 

Thaworn is chasing his third title of the year and his third open of the season after winning in Indonesia and Taiwan. 

This is not really my kind of course as you need to hit it very straight off the tee and that is not something I do very well. I have not used my driver off the tee so that has helped. I hit 16 greens in regulation and missed two fairways, said Thaworn. 

He started quietly on the back nine, making the turn in one-under but then sped up the leaderboard with five birdies on the inward stretch. 

I feel quite comfortable in the lead although I am sure there will be some big crowds at the weekend so it is going to be hard work keeping concentration, added the Thai star, who leads on 10-under-par 134. 

Indian ace Arjun Atwal, winner of this event in 1999, made his move firing a 68 to lie at six under. Atwal is still on a high after a successful season on the US PGA Tour and is taking time to adjust to the greens. 

I really have not got used to the greens yet. I had 32 putts which is very poor. It is just going to take a bit of time adjusting from the fast greens of the US PGA tour, said Atwal. 

I missed at least three or four putts from 15 feet, leaving them all short, he added.South African Hendrik Buhrmann, Thailands Prom Meesawat, Marcus Both from Australia and local lad Digvijay Singh finished on eight under. 

Defending champion Mardan Mamat from Singapore fired a 72 to lie at one-under. 

I am not badly placed going into the weekend at one-under for the tournament but I reckon I need a couple of 65s now. I had a good chance today to make a move, but missed too many birdie chances. I missed about five good birdie putts, said Mamat. 

The cut was made at level par. 

The tournament witnessed a welcome return to form for Rosales. The Filipino, brother of US LPGA tour player Jennifer, lost his Asian Tour card last year and in 10 starts this year had missed four cuts. 

The last time I was here was in 2000. After todays round I think I should be coming here more often. This course is pretty tight. You dont need to hit it long. Just keep it in play and make some putts, said Rosales. 

The young Filipino finished second in the Philippines Open this season but is languishing in 83rd place on the Order of Merit.

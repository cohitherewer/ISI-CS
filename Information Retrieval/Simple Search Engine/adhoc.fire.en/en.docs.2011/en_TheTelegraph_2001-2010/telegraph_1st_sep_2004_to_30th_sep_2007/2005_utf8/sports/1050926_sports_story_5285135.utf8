Calcutta: Tasting success after having passed through a tough time made the Mohun Bagan fans more than happy when the club won their 26th league title at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. They celebrated their much-awaited success with slogans and abir of green and maroon colour. 

Winning the league after four years may have satisfied the supporters, but it didnt satisfy the coach Amal Dutta. I am not satisfied with the show, its only 20 percent of what we are capable. When we be able to play 70 percent of our potential, I will be happy, Dutta said amidst huge roar of the fans. 

Dutta, however, attributed the success to the players before leaving the ground escorted by daughter and cops. Now the league is over and we have to focus on the Federation Cup, Dutta signed off. 

Captain Mehtab Hussain also praised his colleagues for putting up a consistent show all through the championship. It is the result of hard work, Mehtab said when the fans were smearing the forehead of their captain with abir. 

In our team everyone is captain and everyone has the right to point out the mistakes and praise the good work, he added. 

Meanwhile, the century-old club will hold a two-day camp in Digha early next month as they will skip the Governors Gold Cup in Sikkim commencing on Saturday.

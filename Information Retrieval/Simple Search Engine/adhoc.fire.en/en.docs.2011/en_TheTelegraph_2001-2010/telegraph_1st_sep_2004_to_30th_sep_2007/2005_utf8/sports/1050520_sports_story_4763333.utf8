CSKA Moscow became the first Russian club to win a European trophy when they beat Sporting Lisbon in the Uefa Cup final, an achievement even more meritorious as the game was played at the Portuguese teams home ground, the Estadio Jose Alvalade. 

Soviet clubs won the Cup-Winners Cup three times ? Dynamo Kiev in 1975 and 1986 and Dinamo Tbilisi in 1981 ? but until Wednesday night the closest a Russian team has come was in 1972 when Dynamo Moscow reached the Cup-Winners Cup final. 

Dreadful defending by Sporting led to their downfall but CSKA deserved their place in the history books in their 19th tie of a marathon European campaign. 

Not surprisingly Sporting made the early pressure roared on in their home stadium by all but 2,000 fans from Moscow. The visitors had looked solid in defence until the 29th minute when Daniel Carvalho lost possession to fellow Brazilian Rogerio on the edge of the penalty area. 

The Sporting midfielder was not closed down and Rogerio took advantage of the time and space he was afforded, beating Akinfeev with a right foot shot of such ferocity the goalkeeper barely moved as the ball sped past him. 

CSKA should have equalised a minute from half-time when Olics centre from the right reached Vagner Love unmarked nine yards out but, with the goal at his mercy, the Brazilian striker scuffed his shot to his obvious embarrassment. It had not been a good opening 45 minutes for CSKAs Brazilian pair. 

But CSKA drew level in the 59th minute when Sporting failed to defend Daniel Carvalhos curling free-kick from the left which reached Alexey Berezutskiy. His downward header went over Ricardo who will probably feel he should have done better. 

The goal seemed to deflate Sporting who found themselves 1-2 down in the 67th minute after another defensive lapse. Miguel Garcia fouled Daniel Carvalho but Graham Poll played a good advantage as the ball went to Yuri Zhirkov who beat Joseph Enakarhire before scoring with a low drive. 

Things went from bad to worse for Sporting who were caught on the counter in the 74th. Tellos shot had struck a post and Rogerio one yard out somehow missed with the rebound. CSKA broke and the hapless Enakarhire made only a token challenge on Daniel Carvalho whose cross was missed by Ricardo, leaving Vagner Love with an open goal he did not miss a second time.

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indian football captain Bhaichung Bhutia along with other stars are expected to take part in the TVS futsal championship. 

The five-a-side soccer, organised by the Indian Football Association (IFA), will feature district clubs along with the city?s top six teams including East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. The tournament will be held from April 16 to May 29. 

?I hope this new idea will soon become very popular in India. I am eagerly awaiting to take part in the tournament,? Bhaichung said during the press conference at a city hotel on Wednesday. 

This five-a-side soccer is catching up with people in a big way in other parts of Asia and IFA secretary Subrata Dutta hoped that it will be the same here as well. 

He also informed that the final round will be shown live. 

A total of 304 teams from 19 districts will play each other on a round-robin basis. The district champions will then go on to clash in the knock-out format from where one will eventually qualify for the main round. 

Similarly, one team will qualify from Calcutta, which has been divided into three zones ? North, South and Central. 

A total prize money of Rs 3 lakh will be up for grabs. 

The champions will be richer by Rs 1 lakh while the runners-up will take home Rs 50,000.

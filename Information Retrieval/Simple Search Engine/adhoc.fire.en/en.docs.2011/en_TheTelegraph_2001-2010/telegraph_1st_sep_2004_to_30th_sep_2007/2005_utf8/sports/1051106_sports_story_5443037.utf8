 No light for Sourav

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Ahmedabad: Even if Sourav Ganguly had got 114 instead of 14 in Mumbai on Saturday, it would have done little to impress the selectors when they meet in nearby Motera on Sunday to name the squad for the last couple of matches against Sri Lanka. 

Till late on Saturday night, there was no indication that the former India captain will be recalled and the scenario is unlikely to be different when the side is picked for the next series against South Africa. 

It appears, though, that India is set to have different ODI and Test captains. Sourav is likely to retain captaincy for the Test series against Sri Lanka next month. That he does not feature in Greg Chappells scheme of things for the one-dayers was made clear in Mohali itself. 

Easts Pranab Roy will again be heavily outnumbered if he wants to raise the Sourav issue. The other thing certain is that Mohammed Kaif, who missed the five ODIs owing to a hamstring injury and is now fit, will be back. 

Its likely that Gautam Gambhir will get the axe, but if Chappell and Co. decide to rest Sachin Tendulkar for the inconsequential matches, the Delhi opener will survive. 

If Gambhir has to make way, then the reason for his being picked remains baffling. If the team management had planned to open with Sachin and Virender Sehwag then what was the reason for picking an additional opener? For the record, Gambhir didnt even get to bat for a length of time at nets on Saturday.

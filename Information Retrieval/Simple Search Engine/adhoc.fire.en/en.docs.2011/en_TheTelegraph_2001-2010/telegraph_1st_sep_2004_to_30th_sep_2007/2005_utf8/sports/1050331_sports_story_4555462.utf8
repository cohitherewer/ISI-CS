 9-man India go down 2-3 to Pak 

Kuala Lumpur: Defending champions India went down to Pakistan 2-3 in the under-21 six-nation junior hockey tournament here on Wednesday. 

India, who were reduced to nine men in the second half, led 2-1 at the break but could not hold on to the lead after their skipper Prabodh Tirkey and goalkeeper Adrian D?Souza were shown the yellow card. 

Pakistan drew the first blood in the fourth minute but the Indians came back when Sandeep Singh converted a penalty corner. Hari Prasad gave the defending champions the lead three minutes later when he slotted home a fine pass by Tushar Khandekar off a free hit from Tirkey. 

Meanwhile, Indian women have qualified for the under-21 junior World Cup hockey to be held at Santiago, Chile in September. (PTI)

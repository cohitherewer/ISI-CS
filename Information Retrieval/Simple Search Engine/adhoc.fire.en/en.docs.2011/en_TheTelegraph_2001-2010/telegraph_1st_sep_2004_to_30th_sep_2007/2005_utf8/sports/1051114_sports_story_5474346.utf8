Hyderabad: Buoyed by the 4-0 drubbing of New Zealand at home, Graeme Smiths South Africa are confident of bearding the Indian tiger in its own den, provided they can keep one player in check ? Sachin Tendulkar. 

The South Africans believe that despite all the hoopla surrounding the Master Blaster in the making, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, it is the champion batsman who holds the key for Indias success in the upcoming five-match limited overs cricket series. 

Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell are doing a good job, but the key is the return to form of Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar. He can really uplift the team, South African coach Mickey Arthur said after nets here on Sunday. 

Arthur said the team had studied Dhonis technique. It only remains to be seen how we execute them, he said. 

We also see this series as a major challenge as it would be a preparation for the tough series ahead with Australia, Arthur said. 

Arthur said bowling was their strength. We have a good bowling line up and we are often criticised of playing with seven seamers. 

We have Shaun Pollock, (Charles) Langeveldt, Andre Nel and others who can swing the ball well and also bowl excellent cutters, he said. 

Arthur also praised the wicket at the newly built Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. It appears to be a good wicket, I hope it remains so even after some matches are played on it. 

On the practice match they would be playing against HCA XI at Shirampally on the city outskirts, the South African coach said, It will serve us well. (PTI)

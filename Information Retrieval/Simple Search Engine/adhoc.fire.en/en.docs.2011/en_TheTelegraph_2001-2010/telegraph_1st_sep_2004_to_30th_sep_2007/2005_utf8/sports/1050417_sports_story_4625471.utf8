The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Shahid Afridi flowered in a flawed field

 JAVED MIANDAD

Shahid Afridi has acted decisively twice in this series. In the Bangalore Test, his bat first set up the game for Pakistan and he followed it up with key wickets on the final afternoon. Now he has flattened India at the Green Park, Kanpur. He is the man who has made sure Pakistan will return home undefeated. 

When a storm blows, it is difficult to stay on your feet. So it happened with Indian bowlers. It?s not the first time they have bowled to Afridi, nor is it a rare occasion when he has hit them around the park. So what did they learn from the past hidings? Nothing. 

Afridi?s aerial routes are predictable. He prefers midwicket-square leg area, there is this mighty blow over mid-off and he also crashes past the cover region. To have third man and fine leg against him is such a flawed field. If India had learnt anything from the past, these two fielders would have been up in the circle. 

In their places, two men would patrol the midwicket and long-off fence. If he still clears you, bad luck. At least you would be satisfied you had a game plan against him. 

It is a batsman?s mindset that he eyes the free areas in the field. Who knows with third man and fine leg up in the circle, the gambler in Afridi might have taken a chance in those regions. It would have called for delicate shots which, let?s be fair, is not exactly the way Afridi approaches his batting. 

Another way to bowl to Afridi ? so brilliantly, if briefly, illustrated by Zaheer Khan ? is to mix up the pace of your deliveries. A short-pitched ball is also a better option against him. On Friday if the Indian bowlers did so, at least I didn?t see it. I wonder if all those analysts and men with laptops in the dressing room are up to it. 

Till Afridi kicked up his storm, India might have sensed themselves in the game. They recovered from a poor start through admirable Rahul Dravid and hard-working Mohammed Kaif. It wasn?t a bad pitch but the first hour wasn?t easy for the batsmen. It was two-paced because of early moisture. Sachin Tendulkar got a good ball but the rest didn?t have the technique to cope with the conditions. 

From a cricketing point of view, Virender Sehwag, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh are similar in the way they approach their batting. Their shots carry enormous power but their footwork is limited. It serves them well when the wicket is flat. It shows them up when the ball is darting around. 

If your technique is good, as is the case with Dravid, you would come good in most conditions. Otherwise, a lot of equations have to fall in your favour for you to succeed. In our times, we used to call such batsmen as ?three-to-five? metre players. If you can stop them from coming forward or going back, you would have them in a bind. 

Despite Afridi?s heroics, Pakistan still made heavy weather of the target. The way Shoaib Malik and Yousuf Youhana departed, heaving high in the air on the off-side, you cringed with discomfort in your chair.

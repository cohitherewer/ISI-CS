 Sachin more relaxed now, says Akram

Bangalore/Islamabad: Two former greats on Sunday had contrasting views to offer on Sachin Tendulkar. 

While Jeff Dujon, former West Indies wicketkeeper, believes Sachin is not as confident after the tennis-elbow enforced break from the game, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram feels the maestro has it in him to smash all batting records before he hung his boots. 

I think Sachin has suffered from lack of cricket. He has taken too many breaks... This late in his career, breaks tend to upset you a bit more, Dujon said in Bangalore on Sunday. 

Adding that Sachin still has runs in him, the legendary gloveman said: Right now, he seems to be feeling his weight a bit, does not seem to be as confident as before. 

However Akram, whose record of playing maximum number of ODIs was surpassed by the Master Blaster recently, said: I think he will not stop before 600 ODIs and by that time, all records will be his. Sachin has already set countless batting records. With age on his side, he is capable of achieving even more. 

The 32-year-old batting great is already the highest scorer in ODIs with 13,879 runs in 357 matches with 38 centuries. 

Contrary to Dujons views, Akram felt Sachin was looking more focused and relaxed after recovering from the tennis elbow. 

I think Sachin is more focused and relaxed after a long layoff and I dont agree with those who say he is not a matchwinner. Tendulkar is one of the most difficult batsmen to bowl at and I always liked the challenge of bowling at him, he was quoted as saying in a Pakistan newspaper.

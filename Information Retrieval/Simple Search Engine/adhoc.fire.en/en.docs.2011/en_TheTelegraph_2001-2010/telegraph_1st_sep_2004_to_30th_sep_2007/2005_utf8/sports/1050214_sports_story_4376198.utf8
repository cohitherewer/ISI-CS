 Paris: Brazilian striker Ronaldo is giving his fiancee a romantic St. Valentine?s day present ? a lavish engagement party at a sumptuous and secluded castle outside Paris with about 250 guests.

 The Real Madrid player has reportedly invited teammates Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham and Raul to Monday?s party at Chantilly chateau just north of Paris and is flying them in by private jet.

 Brazilian media put the estimated cost at around 700,000 euros ($900,200), although they say the couple could earn 400,000 euros by selling exclusive photo rights to Spanish magazine Hola!.

 Although it has been billed as a wedding, Ronaldo, 28, cannot marry 23-year-old Brazilian model Daniella Cicarelli until he has been divorced for a full year from his first wife, Milene Domingues, his agent has said. 

 Frankfurt: Fifa president Sepp Blatter has again ruled out the use of video replays to help referees during matches.

 ?As long as I am Fifa president, there will be no video evidence,? Blatter said at a workshop for World Cup referees in Frankfurt on Saturday. ?Football is a game with a human face and mistakes are possible ? from coaches, players and referees.?

 Blatter has long opposed the use of video replays, despite its successful use in sports like rugby and cricket.

 Debate over the use of video replays and other technology in soccer has intensified since officials failed to see the ball had crossed the Manchester United line by about a metre in last month?s Premier League match with Tottenham Hotspur. 

 Berlin: German referee Robert Hoyzer, at the centre of the country?s worst soccer corruption scandal in over 30 years, has been remanded in custody after being arrested, Berlin prosecutors said in a statement issued late on Saturday.

 Hoyzer?s lawyer had said he expected Hoyzer to be released after being questioned about new evidence suggesting he had knowledge of attempts at match fixing prior to games in 2004, which he has admitted receiving payments to fix.

 Donetsk (Ukraine): Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva expended the minimum energy to the maximum effect on Saturday when she set a world indoor pole vault best in her first competition of the year.

 Isinbayeva, who set eight world records indoors and out last year, vaulted 4.87m at the Sergei Bubka annual pole vault competition in Donetsk.

 The mark bettered the 4.83m she cleared at the Budapest world indoors championships last year but is five centimetres short of the world record she vaulted outdoors in Brussels last September.

 World records can now be set either outdoors or indoors.

 During a four-hour competition at the 16th edition of the meeting set up by Bubka in 1990, Isinbayeva vaulted only four times and also ran through her first attempt at 4.87. 

 Buenos Aires: French Open champion Gaston Gaudio beat Alberto Martin in straight sets on Saturday to set up an all-Argentine final against wildcard Mariano Puerta in the Buenos Aires Open.

 Puerta, whose last title was in Bogota five years ago, followed up Friday?s quarter final defeat of top seed Carlos Moya by beating Jose Acasuso, another Argentine, 6-4, 7-6.

 Second seed Gaudio needed one hour and 34 minutes to overcome the unseeded Spaniard.

 Jayasuriya vows to return

Colombo: Sri Lankas former captain Sanath Jayasuriya has vowed to fight back and reclaim a place in the Test squad after being dropped for the Test series in India. 

I was feeling disappointed on the day the team left for India, the left-handed opener said. The team that I have been part of for so many years was leaving but I was playing a club match here. 

The 36-year-old was dropped for the three-Test series starting in Chennai on Friday after struggling with form and fitness in the seven-match ODI series recently which India won 6-1.

 WICB bows to Grenada PM?s pressure 

Bridgetown: Caribbean political leaders exerted pressure on the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to allow dumped captain Brian Lara and six other stars to play in upcoming home series against South Africa and Pakistan. 

Grenada Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, also chairman of Caricom?s Prime Ministers subcommittee on cricket, urged on Friday the WICB to reinstate the seven players it declared ineligible a week ago because their contracts with Cable amp; Wireless conflicted with board sponsor Digicel. 

?(The subcommittee) expects that the WICB will proceed with the selection of the team for the forthcoming series and that it will be based on merit and in a manner that does not retard development of West Indies cricket, now or in the foreseeable future,? Mitchell said in a statement. (AP)

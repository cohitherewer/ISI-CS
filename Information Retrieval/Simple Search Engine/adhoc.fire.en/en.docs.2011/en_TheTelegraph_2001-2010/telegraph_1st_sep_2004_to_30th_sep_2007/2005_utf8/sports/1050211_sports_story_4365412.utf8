 2-tier system on agenda

London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is finally waking up to the idea of a two-tier system, and as a first step, the issue will come up for discussion when the ICC meets in New Delhi from March 17. 

Under the proposal, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, the two weakest Test playing nations, will play less cricket and mostly at home, an ICC official said. 

Other issues likely to dominate proceedings are increased duration of the cricketing programme and varied obligations of different member countries. Under the ICC tour schedule, all 10 full members are supposed to play each other once (at home and away) in five years and repeat that over the next five. Each series must consist of at least two Tests and three one-day Internationals. (PTI)

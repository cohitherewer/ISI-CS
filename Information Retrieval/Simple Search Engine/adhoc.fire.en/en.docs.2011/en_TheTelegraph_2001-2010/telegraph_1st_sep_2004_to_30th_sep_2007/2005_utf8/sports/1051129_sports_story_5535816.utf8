Lahore: Pakistan pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar on Monday said he relished the challenge of bowling at England allrounder Andrew Flintoff because he was the dangerman. Flintoff is my main target and I am enjoying the battle, Shoaib said on the eve of the third and final Test here from Tuesday. 

His captain Inzamam-ul Haq was not far behind, making it clear that Pakistan are planning to target England skipper Michael Vaughan and will try to put him under pressure. 

Vaughan, who missed the first Test due to a knee injury and scored only two and nine in the second, is regarded by Inzamam as Englands key player. 

He is a successful captain and one of their top batsmen. He is going through a bad patch and we will try to put him under as much pressure as we can. If he doesnt get runs the England team will also come under pressure, Inzamam said on Monday. 

If England are feeling the heat, it just got more intense with the news that their first choice spinner Ashley Giles is doubtful for the third and final Test. 

Giles is struggling with a hip injury and said it was touch and go whether he could play in a match England must win to square the series. 

Despite all the sound and fury from the opposition camp, Vaughan put up a brave face on Monday. 

We will be going all out for a win. The pitch looks decent. It is good for batting with a little assistance for the bowlers. Vaughan told reporters on Monday. 

But if we bowl with discipline you can certainly put their batsmen under pressure like we showed in the first two Tests. 

A fact not lost on Shoaib. The fast bowler had tested Flintoff with bouncers in Faisalabad. He has so far dismissed Flintoff in three of the four Test innings. We know how important his wicket is and thats why I target him and will continue to do that, said Shoaib. 

Inzamam echoed similar sentiments. Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick are their two main players and if we can control them we will have a big edge in this Test, the Pakistan captain said. (REUTERS)

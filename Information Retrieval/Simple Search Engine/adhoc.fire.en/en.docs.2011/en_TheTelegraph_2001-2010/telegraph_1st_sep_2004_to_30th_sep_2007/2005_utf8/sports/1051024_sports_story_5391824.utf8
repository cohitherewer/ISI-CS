The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav has a lot of cricket left 

Karsan Ghavri

SANJIB GUHA

Mumbai: Karsan Ghavri was thrilled to hear that axed Team India captain Sourav Ganguly had made an emphatic statement in the Duleep Trophy match against North in Rajkot. 

I was so happy to know that Sourav had scored a brilliant century and thus proved his critics wrong, the former Bengal coach, who is now in charge of the Mumbai Ranji team, told The Telegraph here on Sunday. 

He (Sourav) has let his bat do the talking and answered all the destructive criticism, said the former India allrounder. 

Ghavri rubbished Greg Chappells charge that Sourav shirked work. Theres no truth in the allegation that Sourav shirks work in training sessions? I have seen him undergo rigorous training when I was the Bengal coach, said Ghavri. 

Sourav played two Ranji Trophy matches last season, both of which Bengal won. He helped his state team beat Karnataka in the first game and Madhya Pradesh in the last tie, which helped Bengal remain in the Elite Group. 

Ghavri was quick to make the point that whenever he sought Souravs help, the left-hander responded. He is a great motivator, and I think his form and fitness should no longer be put under the scanner, Ghavri remarked. 

I have seen him from close quarters, I can guarantee you that he (Sourav) still has lot of cricket left in him. What more does a cricketer have to do besides scoring a century and grabbing four wickets in a match to prove that he is still good enough to play for the country, asked Ghavri. 

Ghavri felt that the media hasnt been kind to Sourav. Such a fantastic cricketer should always be supported. Any team can benefit having a performer and mentor like him. 

Ghavri, who coached Bengal during the last two seasons, said he wont forget ever that experience. Ill make it a point to meet them (Bengal team) when they come to Mumbai? they are very close to my heart. 

Dadas association with the team will help others improve not only cricketing skills but also mentally, Ghavri said.

 Sanskara canters home 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Sanskara kept her date with the Fillies Trial Stakes at the RCTC on Wednesday. The prized filly from trainer Bharath Singhs yard beat her three rivals by a distance, which speaks highly of her superior class, and also her Classic credentials against formidable opposition in the major plums to follow.

 Jockey Suraj Narredu, who partnered the Dont Forget Me-Shiseido daughter to victory, virtually had an armchair ride. It was all about sense of judgement which had made the young jockey most sought-after rider in the countrys all turf centres. Sanskaras previous loss, in her lead-up race to the Classic, in fact, had much to do with Surajs requisition for the job on the day.

 Suraj followed the stables riding instructions in toto ? to settle the filly in second if the pace was desirable, otherwise take the matter in your hands.

 The jockey was forced to lead from the start as the early pace was slackened. He let the filly lob in front just ahead of Clockwork till the final turn and drew away from the field in the home stretch.

 The eight-event card was, otherwise, ruled by the Vijay Singh-C.Alford and Daniel David-Chisty combinations which notched up a treble apiece.

 Inzamam does a volte-face

 - ICC SUPER SERIES 

 Inzamam changed his decision after a meeting with PCB chairman 

Karachi: Pakistan cricket captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Tuesday did a u-turn by agreeing to play in the Super Series less than 24 hours after snubbing the Australian event. 

Inzamam, who had made a similar threat last week to withdraw from the captains conference and the International Cricket Council (ICC) annual awards, retracted his statement after meeting Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan on Tuesday morning. 

The PCB stated that Shaharyar had invited Inzamam to his residence on Monday evening in a bid to make him understand the mix-up in communication between ICC general manager Dave Richardson and PCB director cricket operations Saleem Altaf. 

The chairman advised Inzamam-ul-Haq that in the interest of Pakistan he should participate in the Super Series in Australia. 

Inzamam responded positively and agreed to play the Test match at Sydney. 

Inzamam is now looking forward to participating in the Sydney Test between Australia and the World XI, the PCB said in a brief media statement. 

The PCB admitted its mistake, but at the same time, we tried to make him realize that his withdrawal from the Test team would send wrong vibes across, a board official said.

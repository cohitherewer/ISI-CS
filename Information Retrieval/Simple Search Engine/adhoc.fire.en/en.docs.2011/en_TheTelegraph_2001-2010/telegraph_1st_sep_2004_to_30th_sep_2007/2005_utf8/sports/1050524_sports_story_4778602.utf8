 Akram case dismissed

Karachi: A Pakistani court on Monday dismissed a case against former cricket star Wasim Akram over allegations that he failed to return a luxury vehicle he had borrowed from an acquaintance, a lawyer said. 

A judge of the Sindh High Court threw out the case against Akram as false and frivolous, said Zahid Fakhruddin, a lawyer for Akram, a fast bowling icon and former Pakistan captain. 

An acquaintance of Akram, Saadat Hasan, had filed the complaint against the cricketer, accusing him of failing to return a luxury vehicle he had borrowed or compensate him for it. 

Akram, who denied the allegations, later filed a petition in the high court after a lower court cancelled his bail in March last year. (AP)

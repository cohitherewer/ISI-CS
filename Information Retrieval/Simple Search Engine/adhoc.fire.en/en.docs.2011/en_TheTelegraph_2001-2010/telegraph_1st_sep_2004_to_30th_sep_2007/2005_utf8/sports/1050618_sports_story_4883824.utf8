 Ailing Lee Westwood cards 68

Lee Westwood may have been croaking but his irons were fully on song during the first day of the 105th US Open. Level par at the turn and one over after 12 holes, the Ryder Cup golfer conjured up five successive threes on his way to the 68 which left him on the same mark as Retief Goosen and one shot behind Olin Browne and Rocco Mediate. 

It was a massive bonus to hit the ball as well as I did when I was feeling so bad, Westwood said. He had suspected the beginnings of a chest-cum-throat infection when he was practising his putting on Wednesday. 

It was a pair of six-irons, one to the short 15th and the next his second to the 16th, which did most to make his round. One finished 50 feet away and the other finished 30 feet away but they were both great shots, he explained. 

Brownes round continued a dramatic change of fortunes for the American, who nearly pulled out of the qualifying event at the Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Maryland, after a poor start to save himself for the Booz Allen Classic. He changed his mind, however, and qualified with a 12-under-par round of 59. 

I was probably five minutes from not being here, said Browne, 46, who shot a 73 in the opening round of his qualifier and knew he probably needed a 62 to progress. I decided to play nine to see how it went, managed to shoot 30 on the front nine and kept going. It was a fun, fun day and Im glad to be here. 

As early as 10 clock Thursday morning, the United States Golf Association, who took such stick for the state of the greens at Shinnecock Hills a year ago, were watering the putting surfaces. At that stage, they were by no means impossible but the officials were clearly fearful of what might happen over what was expected to be a hot and breezy afternoon. 

While Westwood went in search of a doctor, Ian Poulter felt that the best way of curing his problems ? he was round in a seven-over-par 77 ? was to talk about them. 

At the 18th, his ninth, Poulter had a one-foot putt which went into the hole only after taking an unexpected leap from the lip. On the next green, he had a two-footer which did the same, only this time the ball spun out. Poulter wheeled round and called for a tournament official. As he saw it the rim of the hole, which was meant to be one inch below ground, was rather less than that. The turf, he said, had risen with the rim. 

The official said that he could see nothing wrong. Whereupon Poulter holed his tiddler and jammed the flag back in the hole in a move which served the dual purpose of getting the fury out of his system and pushing the rim back to where it should have been. 

It was a shock, said Poulter, who in keeping with the respect he had shown in not wearing his Payne Stewart outfit, was determined to keep his more colourful language under wraps. Imagine what it would be like, he asked his audience, if I were to score three under par in each of the next three rounds and miss winning by a shot. 

Paul Casey, on the other hand, had a 15-over-par 85 which was clearly beyond repair. The player took a fortnight off to work on his game before this US Open and had not expected too much of himself. Those close to him, however, suspect that it could be a year or more before he is fully over the fall-out from those comments he made about Americans on the eve of last Novembers World Cup in Seville. 

The crowds were out in force at 7.44 am for the start at the tenth hole of the Tiger Woods, Luke Donald and Chris DiMarco trio. At the start, the spectators only had eyes for Woods. Then, though, Donald drew attention to himself with a 50-yard approach to two feet to salvage a par at the 11th. Two holes later the spectators at the green were rising from their seats to applaud a Donald second which looked as though it would drop for an eagle. 

Donald had no trouble playing with Woods, who was round in 70 to his 69. Mindful as he is of the commotion that goes on around him, Woods always does what he can to be considerate to his playing companions. Again, that courtesy extends to the marshals, with no better illustration than when he said a polite thank you sir to the marshal who found his ball in a perfectly foul stretch of rough at the 12th. 

As often as not, players are half-inclined to treat the marshals as though they were responsible for their errant shots.

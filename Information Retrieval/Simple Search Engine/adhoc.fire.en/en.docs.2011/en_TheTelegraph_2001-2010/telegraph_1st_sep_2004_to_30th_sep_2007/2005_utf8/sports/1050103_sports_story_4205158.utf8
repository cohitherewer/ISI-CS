 Jaffer puts Mumbai in control

 Jaffer made 122 

Mumbai: Opener Wasim Jaffer struck his third century of the season to lead Mumbai?s strong first innings reply on the third day of the Ranji Trophy Elite group A tie against Delhi here Sunday. 

Jaffer made 122 with 14 fours and also put on century stands for the first and second wickets with Vinayak Mane and Vinit Indulkar as Mumbai, replying to Delhi?s first innings tally of 394, finished the day at a commanding 350 for 3. 

Another partnership for the fourth wicket, already worth an unfinished 41 runs, between Amol Muzumdar and Nishit Shetty was looming large in front of Delhi, who needed at least the first innings points to qualify for the semi-finals along with holders Mumbai. Jaffer occupied the crease for over six hours and faced 236 balls while adding 136 for the first wicket with Mane, who made 73, and 152 for the second wicket with Indulkar, who was let off twice on his way to 85.

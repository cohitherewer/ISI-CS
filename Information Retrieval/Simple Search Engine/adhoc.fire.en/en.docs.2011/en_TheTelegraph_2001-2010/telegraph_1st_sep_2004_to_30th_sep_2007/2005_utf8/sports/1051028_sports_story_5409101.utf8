 Bracken included in squad

Sydney: Fast bowler Nathan Bracken has been included in a 12-man squad for Australias opening Test against the West Indies starting in Brisbane on November 3. 

The left-arm paceman replaced middle-order batsman Brad Hodge in the only change to the squad that beat the World XI in this months ICC Super Test in Sydney. 

Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill was retained in the squad, giving the selectors the option of playing two wrist spinners after his success bowling in tandem with Shane Warne in Sydney, although he may still be required to carry the drinks. 

The pair captured 15 of the 20 World XI wickets that fell in Sydney and although the Gabba pitch in Brisbane is better suited to fast bowling than spin, chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said MacGills inclusion would give them more options. 

Meanwhile, the West Indies suffered a blow on Thursday with the injury-enforced withdrawal of batsman Wavell Hinds. He broke the little finger on his left hand while fielding in the tourists opening tour match against Queensland here on Thursday. 

A team spokesman said the Jamaican left-hander must keep the finger immobilised for 10 days. He will not be fit again until the second Test in Hobart, starting on November 17.

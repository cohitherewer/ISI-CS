 Chidi takes Sporting to last 8

 Chidi scored both goals 

Margao: Edeh Chiddis first half brace helped Sporting Clube de Goa edge past State Bank of Tranvancore (SBT) 2-1 and book a quarter final berth in the 27th Federation Cup on Friday. 

Sporting, scored both the goals in the first half through Chiddi (29th, 45th). SBT pulled one back in the stoppage time through a Martin John header off Abdul Naushad cross from the right. Felip Gomes was adjudged as the man of the match. 

The match was played mostly in the midfield with Sporting, who held territorial advantage, dictating terms in the latter part of the first half and taking the lead in the 27th minute. 

Suresh Davi floated the ball off a flag kick, which saw defender Siva Kumar clearance landing at the feet of Chiddi, who despatched it into the net. The goal put Sporting in command as they probed into the rival half and increased the lead in the stoppage time of the first half. 

 Dudu, from the middle, relayed the ball to Chiddi and even before defender Pradeep tried to intercept him, Chiddi dribbled past two rival defenders before slotting home. 

Dudu, who was the highest scorer in the NFL last season, gave good support to Chiddi but lacked fineness in his first match as his header missed the target narrowly. 

SBT, who did not pose much threat in the first half, came up with counter moves and came close to scoring twice but keeper Felix stood the test putting the ball out of danger off Mohammed Harris and Ignatius Sylvesters shot. 

SBT finally pulled one back in the stoppage time when Martin Johns header off Abdul Naushad cross beat goalie Felix dSouza all ends.

 Lara more dangerous than Indian duo

Sydney: Brian Lara has been voted the most dangerous batsman by Australian cricketers, ahead of Indian stalwarts Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. 

The former West Indies captain, who failed miserably in the Super Series against Australia recently and has been generally lying low for some time, still evokes the maximum fear in the hearts of Australian bowlers, as he has been voted as the best of the rest by more than half of the Australian national squad. 

Lara polled 55 per cent followed by Sachin Tendulkar (25 per cent) and Rahul Dravid (20 per cent), an Australian newspaper reported on Monday. 

However, V.V.S. Laxman, who has been a thorn in their flesh, does not find a mention.

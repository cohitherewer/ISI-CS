 Treble for Vijay, Shanker 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh and jockey Shanker landed a treble apiece and jockey C. Alford also had his share of luck with a double on Saturday. The day also witnessed some exciting finishes and the suspension of jockey S. Tamang for not allowing his charge, Forest Ridge, to run on its merits in the Nero Handicap. Vijay?s Anzello was stretched to the fullest in the day?s main event, the 2,000m Hyderabad Race Club Cup, despite the fact that the 6-10 hot-favourite manoeuvered the shortest way home while his main rival, Secret Obsession, opted for the circuitous route.

 Mahi played his part well, says modest dad

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ranchi: Sachin Tendulkar failed for a change, so did Irfan Pathan. But Team India couldnt care less. There was Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take care of the Sri Lankans in Jaipur on Monday. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman was in the thick of action almost right through the match. He kept wickets as the visitors piled up 298 for four and, after the lunch break, arrived at the crease in the very first over of the Indian innings following Tendulkars dismissal. 

Dhoni took little time to announce his intention and soon the Sri Lankan bowlers started feeling the heat. 

As is rained sixes and fours at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium, each muscular hit was greeted by cheers and high-fives at the Dhoni residence here. The select group included some of Dhonis close friends who were giving his parents, Pan Singh and Devki Devi, company. 

The telephone lines rang non-stop from the moment Mahi ? as Dhoni is lovingly called ? reached his second ODI century. The celebrations reached a crescendo as soon as he belted his sixth over-boundary to signal Indias victory. 

The proud father thanked God and put Mahis matchwinning knock down to destiny. Im happy he has been performing consistently. I will pray to God that he continues to do so well over a long period of time. 

His sons record-shattering innings had obviously delighted him, but Pan Singh was quick to point out that individual performance doesnt matter much in a team game like cricket. 

India won and that is the main thing. Mahi just played his part well. Indias victory should be highlighted more than any individual performance, said Pan Singh a trifle too humbly. 

Dhonis friends and some neighbours begged to differ, having no qualms in announcing that he had single-handedly steered India to a 3-0 lead over 

The father made another important observation. Initially he (Dhoni) used to bat at number six or seven where he couldnt show his normal prowess. Now, he gets a chance to bat at three in some games and that has helped him blossom, said Pan Singh. 

Dhonis childhood friends felt Mondays knock was even better than his 148 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam. 

The kids in the muhalla were celebrating Diwali a day in advance. We watched Dhonibhaiya all afternoon. Now its time to celebrate, one of them said as a big group got ready to burst crackers. 

Ccongratulations poured in from far and wide. 

I have been maintaining for a long time that Dhoni is the best wicketkeeper-batsman in the country, he has proved his worth once again, said Amitabh Choudhary, the president of the Jharkhand State Cricket Association. A player who has kept wickets for 50 overs and then returns to the field to play such a blistering innings is simply brilliant. 

Choudhary added that the national selectors havent yet done full justice to Dhoni. Its high time Dhoni is picked for the Test side, Choufhary signed off. 

The whole of Jharkhand must be echoing Choudharys thought.

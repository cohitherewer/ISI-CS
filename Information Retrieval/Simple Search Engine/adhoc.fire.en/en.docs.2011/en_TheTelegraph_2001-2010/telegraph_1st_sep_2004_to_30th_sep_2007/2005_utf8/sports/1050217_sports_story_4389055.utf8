The Telegraph - Calcutta

 NZ, not Ashes, on Ponting?s mind 

 - Twenty20 opener today 

 Ponting has been thinking of a strategy for Thursday?s match 

Sydney: Australia?s cricketers flew out of Sydney on Wednesday for their tour of New Zealand, dismissing suggestions they already have their minds on England later in the year. 

The world champions will play New Zealand in three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 match over the next six weeks. 

The tour is Australia?s final workout before this year?s Ashes tour and while the English are looming as a potentially greater threat, captain Ricky Ponting said his team was only worried about New Zealand. 

?I think a lot of the media are talking about the Ashes series but we know that we have got this very big and vital series to play first,? Ponting told reporters at Sydney airport. 

?New Zealand are a very good side and they are hard to beat in Australia and a lot harder to beat over there.? 

The Australians were given a clean bill of health before their departure with opening batsman Matthew Hayden passing a late fitness test. 

The left-hander had been bed-ridden for a week after suffering from pleurisy, a lung inflammation related to pneumonia, but was cleared to play. 

While Australia?s main priority is the three Tests, Ponting said he had been racking his brain trying to come up with a strategy for Thursday?s Twenty20 tour opener, the first time the abbreviated version of the game has been played between international sides. 

?I?m going to have to don my thinking cap on the plane and work out what to do and what the field restrictions are,? Ponting said. 

New Zealand, although ranked second in the world in limited overs cricket, go into the series plagued with injuries. 

Four players in the ? Kyle Mills, Jeff Wilson, Daniel Vettori and Scott Styris ? have injury niggles bringing a lop-sided feel to the series and waning public interest.

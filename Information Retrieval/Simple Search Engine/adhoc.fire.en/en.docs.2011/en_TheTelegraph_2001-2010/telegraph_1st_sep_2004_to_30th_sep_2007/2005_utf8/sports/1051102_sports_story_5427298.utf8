 Bayern aiming to top group

 - Champions League

 host Panathinaikos 

 Roy Makaay has not scored in 994 minutes after starting the season for Bayern 

London: Bayern Munich and Arsenal can secure places in the second round of the Champions League with wins on Wednesday. 

Thats where the similarities end. 

Bayern lead the Bundesliga, while Arsenal languish in seventh place in the English Premier League, 14 points behind leaders Chelsea. 

Bayern, like Arsenal, have won their opening three European matches to lead their group. The German team plays at second-place Juventus on Wednesday. 

We are going for a victory. We want to win the group, said Bayern coach Felix Magath, whose team beat Juventus 2-1 on October 18. 

If Bayern beat Juventus and Rapid Vienna get their first point of the season against FC Brugge, the German team can guarantee itself of the Group A title. 

Juventus ended a nine-match winning streak with a 1-3 loss to AC Milan on Saturday, but still lead the Serie A by two points. 

With Bayern it will be another tough match, Juventus coach Fabio Capello said. Now more than before I am convinced my team is extremely strong. 

Patrick Vieira is doubtful with a groin problem, and with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon still sidelined with a shoulder injury, either Antonio Chimenti or Christian Abbiati will start in goal. 

Bayern have problems in attack. Roque Santa Cruz is out for about five months with a knee injury, while Roy Makaay hasnt scored in 994 minutes after starting the season with six goals in three games. 

Makaay is still expected to start considering Claudio Pizarro and Paulo Guerrero are even more out of form. 

Hell have to be able to deal with the pressure. I expect him to show his strength again, Magath said of Makaay. 

Michael Ballack again will be relied upon. He scored the winner against Aue in the German Cup and then notched the winner again on Saturday in a 2-1 win over FC Cologne. 

Arsenal are struggling with confidence despite rallying to draw 1-1 with north London rivals Tottenham on saturday. 

The team was deeply affected by insecurity in the first half, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. We were a little bit complicated and we did not play enough. 

Visiting Sparta Prague will hope that Arsenals self-belief continues to founder. 

The Czech club, in last place in Group B, has one point from three games and will be lucky to finish third and qualify for the Uefa Cup. Sparta lost their sixth match this season ? as many they lost all of last season ? 1-2 against Sigma Olomouc on Saturday. 

Ajax have four points and a win at Swiss club FC Thun should also help the club advance. 

Manchester United need a win against Lille to boost their morale after losing 1-4 to Middlesbrough in the Premier League. Manager Alex Ferguson will be without Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, all of whom are injured, while Paul Scholes is suspended. 

We are not in the greatest spirit at the moment but we have to analyse what went wrong (against Middlesbrough) and somehow start to focus on tomorrows game against Lille, United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar said. 

Benfica play Villarreal in the other Group D match. 

FC Barcelona lead Group C with seven points and face Panathinaikos ? the only club to take points off the Spanish champions this Champions League season. The two drew 0-0 on October 18 in Athens. 

Unlike some others, Barcelona enter with confidence high, coming off a 5-0 win over Real Sociedad on Sunday. 

When we play with ease, one or two touches, it is very difficult for our opponents to play against us, Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson said. 

Werder Bremen host Udinese in the other group match.

 Sukhwinder willing to face AIFF 

New Delhi: Expressing his willingness to continue in his present job, national football coach Sukhwinder Singh on Thursday said he would explain the dismal performance of the team on the tours to Pakistan and Fiji if called to do so by the federation. 

If the federation calls me, I would appear before them to give my side of the story, Sukhwinder said, adding, however, he had not received any official intimation in this regard. 

India had lost the three match series in Pakistan on goal difference. Worse was to follow in Fiji where Sukhwinders side lost all three matches on tour. 

The executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), which met here on Wednesday, had decided that Sukhwinder would have to appear before president Priya Ranjan Das munshi on September 15 and present his future plans for the team. 

But to complicate matters, the committee also decided to invite applications for the post of national coach, along with a foreign technical director. 

When asked about the fate of the present coach, AIFF vice-president Subrata Dutta said: He (Sukhwinder) will appear before the president and if the panel does not find anyone more eligible than him, he will continue as the coach.

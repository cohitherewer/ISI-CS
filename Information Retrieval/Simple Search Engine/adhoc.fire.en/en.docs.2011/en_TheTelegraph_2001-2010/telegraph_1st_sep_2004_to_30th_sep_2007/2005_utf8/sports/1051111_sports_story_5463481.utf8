The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India now have 22 players to choose 

 from

 - If the hosts can unnerve Aussies too, cricket will be the 

 beneficiary 

Straight Talk

 Arjuna Ranatunga

 Sreesanth works 

 up a tidy pace and is largely accurate 

 Sri Lanka have hit the ground 

 with a thud. Just when I was envisaging the return to form 

 of our team, India have crushed the uprising with a heavy 

 hand. Frankly, Sri Lanka have not looked in the same league.

 Instead of Lanka in their present 

 mess, it would interest me more to see how the rising power 

 of India match up to the best in days to come. India are 

 approaching basics as the Australians do and that is to 

 attack at all costs. The aggression is being backed with 

 good skills.

 Presently, the Indians have managed 

 to unnerve the Sri Lankans, made them blink. If they could 

 do it to a Glenn McGrath or Brett Lee; Ricky Ponting and 

 Adam Gilchrist, cricket, as a sport, will go a notch higher. 

 Now even fielding does not look their soft spot.

 In months to come, India could 

 bridge the gap even more rapidly. Greg Chappell has practically 

 built alternative for every spot. Instead of 11, India now 

 have 22 players to choose from. As I hear the names of VRV 

 Singh and Piyush Chawla, it seems there is no let-up in 

 experiments yet. 

 Interestingly, the Australians 

 are not doing the same. The nucleus of their side is still 

 the same old faces. These men have been irrepressible gladiators 

 but are already in their 30s. If in two years time they 

 lose their edge, Australia could have a problem. The new 

 faces we see in their side from time to time have not looked 

 exceptional.

 Still, I would have preferred 

 if India had cushioned their fast bowling department better 

 in the Rajkot game. Instead of both Rudra Pratap Singh and 

 Shreesanth playing, I would have opted for one, buffering 

 them with Irfan Pathan and Ajit Agarkar. It can be dangerous 

 if you bring a callow youth to an adults fiesta, unattended. 

 A mauling could scar him for life.

 Not that I did not like the look 

 of these two young men. For the second game running, R.P. 

 Singh, with his high-arm action, has managed lift from most 

 docile strips. He did it as first change in case you missed 

 the point. Along with the high action, the positioning of 

 his wrist has been critical as he continuously strives to 

 hit the deck. He would not be a typical slithering left-arm 

 pacer and thats a good deviation to have from a Pathan.

 Sreesanth, I am told, is not the 

 fastest in India and thats a surprise. He works up 

 a tidy pace and despite being hit for a few fours in this 

 game, is largely accurate. His bristling run-up helps in 

 keeping a batsman honest. Its not easy to bowl with 

 a 6-3 field amidst restriction of opening overs for there 

 is simply no margin of error. Its doubly joyous for 

 it has been done with aggression. 

 Practically every game in this 

 series has thrown up new heroes for India. Dhoni, Harbhajan, 

 Pathan, Tendulkar, Gambhir, Dravid, Raina, Kartik, Agarkar 

 have all strutted their stuff in the series.

 In Rajkot, it was the turn of 

 R.P. Singh, Yuvraj and Mohammad Kaif. Yuvraj was at his 

 stylish best in this game. If earlier he was coming down 

 to spinners to lift them, he is now advancing and driving 

 them and picking gaps at will. He seems to have made a huge 

 technical advance in his game.

 Only a Sehwag puzzle has not been 

 solved. This man has so much charm at the crease that even 

 hard nuts like us are willing to ignore his run of poor 

 scores. He is still smacking the bowlers and dismissing 

 them as if in nets before something snaps in him in 30s 

 and 40s. I wonder if it is concentration.

 I am sure it is hurting Sehwag. 

 He has a unique quality which I had also noticed in Kaluwitharana. 

 They smacked fours without resorting to hitting the ball 

 over the top. Most of their fours are grounded shots. Its 

 a dangerous and rare quality for you are destructive without 

 appearing too adventurous. (PTI)

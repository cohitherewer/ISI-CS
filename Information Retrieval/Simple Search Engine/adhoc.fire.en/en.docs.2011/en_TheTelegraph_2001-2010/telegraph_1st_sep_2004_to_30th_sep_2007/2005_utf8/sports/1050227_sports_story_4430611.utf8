 I?m available for the job, says Akram

Karachi: Just a couple of days after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) decided against appointing Waqar Younis as the bowling coach, former captain Wasim Akram said he was ?available? for the job but would not go out of his way to get it. 

?I?m really sick of this question. Everybody asks me why I am not training the Pakistan team. Now I cannot go to the PCB and beg them to give me a job. I?m available, they have to call me. And nobody has called me yet,? Akram said. (PTI)

London: Fabien Barthez saved a penalty on his UEFA Cup return to help Olympique Marseille sink holders CSKA Moscow 2-1 in the Russian capital on Thursday. 

Former European champions Steaua Bucharest crushed Racing Lens 4-0 to fire a warning to their Group C rivals. In Group A, Monaco were beaten 1-0 in Norway by Viking Stavanger, who began the competition in the first qualifying round. 

French international Barthez, making his second appearance since returning from a six-month ban for spitting at a referee, kept out a 48th-minute spot-kick from CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich as the 2004 runners-up made a winning start in Group F. 

The enigmatic Barthez also made a series of fine stops before being beaten 10 minutes from time by Brazilian substitute Vagner Love. First-half goals from Sabri Lamouchi and Mamadou Niang had put Marseille in control against injury-hit CSKA. 

Striker Nicolae Dica scored twice as Romanian champions Steaua brushed aside Lens, who ended a miserable game with 10 men after Ivorian striker Aruna Dindanes dismissal. 

Headers from Victoras Iacob and Dorin Goian put Steaua two up in 17 minutes before Dica rubbed salt in the wounds. 

AZ Alkmaar responded to being knocked off top spot in the Dutch championship at the weekend with a battling 2-1 win at Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in Group D. 

Georgia striker Shota Arveladze, the Dutch leagues top scorer, gave Louis van Gaals side an early lead in Ukraine. Morocco midfielder Tarik Sektioui added a second soon after the restart with Serhiy Matyukhin replying. 

Palermo defender Christian Terlizzi continued his scoring streak with a 77th-minute winner in a 2-1 victory over Israels Maccabi Petah Tikva in Group B. Terlizzi is top scorer this season for the Sicilian side with four goals in Serie A. 

AS Roma also won 2-1 away, a goal six minutes from time in Group E. (REUTERS)

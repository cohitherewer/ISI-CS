 Pindi to host 1st ODI, Peshawar 2nd

New Delhi: Its official. The venues of Indias first two ODIs have been swapped. 

As per the revised itinerary, Rawalpindi will host the first ODI and Peshawar the second. The dates remain the same (February 7 and 10). 

The venues were interchanged because of logistical problems pertaining to security arrangements for Muharram. 

This was decided during the IGP Yashovardhan Azad-headed five-member security teams visit to Pakistan. The team returned on Thursday. 

Regarding doubts about hotel accommodation in Faisalabad, BCCI executive secretary-in-charge Ratnakar Shetty said Faisalabad was almost certain to host the second Test. 

To compensate for bad light in the evening, play every morning in Tests would start 15 minutes early at 9.45 am local time. 

The five ODIs will be all be day-night affairs, starting at 11 am. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Eden Test likely from March 16

 - PAK in India 

- Ahmedabad is the proposed venue for fourth ODI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket 

in India (BCCI) has drawn up the itinerary for the tour by Pakistan, but could 

still amend it. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, the BCCI 

has ?budgeted? for a five-day delay ? both in the visitors? arrival and the hosting 

of the Tests and ODIs. 

Till the postponement, decided upon Thursday, Inzamam-ul Haq and Co. were to land on February 24. 

The itinerary, by the way, has been faxed to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). 

As of Saturday night, the three-Test series will begin in Mohali on March 8 and end on March 29 (Bangalore). The six-match ODI series is going to start in Kochi on April 2 and finish on April 17 (New Delhi). 

Significantly, the additional (sixth) ODI, in Ahmedabad, is proposed to be the fourth in the series. For ?tactical? reasons, it was assumed the Gujarat capital would be the last venue. 

The BCCI, clearly, is confident about security arrangements in Ahmedabad. 

The itinerary, though, will be confirmed only after the Madras High Court gives its ruling on the BCCI versus Zee telecast rights case. 

Arguments are expected to conclude Monday afternoon and, if the ruling too is given that day, the BCCI (under the circumstances) gets some breathing time. 

However, the BCCI is going to require ?at least ten days? to finalise the telecast rights for (at least) the forthcoming tour. An ad-hoc arrangement marked the last two series? at home and the Platinum Jubilee ODI against Pakistan. 

Therefore, the timing of the court?s ruling is pretty crucial to the Pakistan-in-India itinerary. 

Meanwhile, one learns, the Pakistan team won?t be accompanied by a security officer deputed by Islamabad. 

The PCB, though, will request the BCCI to liaise with the powers-that-be to ensure a security officer is assigned to the team throughout. 

Back in 1999, both during the Tests and the tri-series, 

that hat was worn by IG Yashovardhan Azad, who heads the VIP security division.

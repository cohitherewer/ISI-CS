 Eriksson plans midfield role for Scott Parker

Sven-Goran Eriksson is looking for a holding midfield player for his England team, and, to that end, he will watch Scott Parker face Manchester United on Sunday. 

The England head coach is considering whether to call up the Newcastle United man against Wales and Northern Ireland in World Cup qualifiers, with the squad to be announced on Sunday night. 

Although Eriksson is expected to stick to his usual midfield quartet ? David Beckham, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and, if fully fit, Steven Gerrard ? in Cardiff next Saturday and again in Belfast four days later, he wants the option of stiffening the team. 

With Nicky Butt having fallen out of contention, Michael Carrick is the first in line after his impressive displays on the summer tour of the United States, but Parker could also provide cover. 

Eriksson is also considering whether to drop David James from his squad and promote Chris Kirkland instead. James has been heavily criticised since conceding four goals in the second half against Denmark last week. Kirkland, who has been loaned out to West Bromwich Albion by Liverpool, is yet to make his senior international debut because of a succession of injuries. 

Michael Owen will be named in the party even though he is suspended for the game in Wales. With Peter Crouch still recovering from injury, Jermain Defoe is expected to line up alongside Wayne Rooney, as he did in Copenhagen. 

Gary Neville is sidelined with a groin injury and so his younger brother, Phil, or Jamie Carragher will deputise at right back. 

England lie second in the group with a game in hand over Poland, who are top.

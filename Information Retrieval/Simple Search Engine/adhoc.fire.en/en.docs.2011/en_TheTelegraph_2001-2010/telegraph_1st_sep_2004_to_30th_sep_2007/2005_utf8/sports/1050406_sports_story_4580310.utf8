 Jyoti, Jeev among six Indians in qualifiers

Kuala Lumpur: Jyoti Randhawa would lead a strong group of six Indians who will vie for a place at the prestigious British Open when the 36-hole international final qualifying for Asia begins here on Wednesday. 

Other Indians hoping for a trip to St Andrews, the home of golf, are Jeev Milkha Singh, who missed out on a spot in 2004 after losing in a play-off, Gaurav Ghei, who played at the Open in 1997, Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon and Rahil Gangjee. 

A total of 31 players will battle it out for three tickets to the Open at the Saujana Golf and Country Club. 

Randhawa has played in three British Opens, including last year when he made his first cut and tied for the 27th place. He became the first Indian to play in four rounds. 

Randhawa, Asia?s No. 1 in 2002 and 2004, is convinced that an Asian can win the Open in the near future. 

?A few guys in Asia are certainly capable of winning anything. This year, we?ve had Thongchai (Jaidee) and Thaworn (Wiratchant) winning European Tour-sanctioned events and Arjun (Atwal) nearly won the Bellsouth (on the PGA Tour on Monday),? said Randhawa, currently ranked third on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

?Five years ago, we didn?t have the experience but now through the Asian Tour, we?ve become better players. We are certainly on a par with the rest and the only thing that is perhaps lacking is a bit of consistency. 

?It?s great that we have a chance to qualify in Asia. I?m happy with my early-season form and the changes that I?ve made with my swing is working out well. I?m looking forward to the next two days,? Randhawa said. (PTI)

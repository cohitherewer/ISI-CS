London: Ronaldo was sent off as Real Madrid went out of the Champions League when they were beaten 0-2 by Juventus after extra-time in the second leg of their first knockout round tie on Wednesday. 

Juventus won 2-1 on aggregate at the Stadio Delle Alpi with Marcelo Zalayeta?s winner in the 116th minute coming three minutes after Ronaldo and Alessio Tacchinardi were sent off after clashing as they chased a loose ball. 

Ronaldo whacked Tacchinardi with a retaliatory kick to the shins after the Juventus defender appeared to grab the Brazilian round the neck as he bore down on the Italian goal. 

?It was a piece of stupidity on my part,? Ronaldo said. ?I got annoyed because Tacchinardi grabbed me round the neck and I kicked out at him ? I shouldn?t have done it.? 

Substitute David Trezeguet had forced extra-time for Juventus with an acrobatic bicycle kick after 75 minutes. 

?It is never an easy business defeating Real Madrid and so that was a special feeling,? said Juventus coach Fabio Capello. ?I think it?s the first time I have celebrated like that but now I?ve done it I?d like to try it again,? he said. 

Juventus joined other former European champions Bayern Munich, Liverpool and PSV Eindhoven, who all showed their European vintage on Wednesday by sealing places in the quarter finals. 

They advanced along with Chelsea, former champions AC Milan and aspiring Olympique Lyon who all qualified on Tuesday with wins over Barcelona, Manchester United and Werder Bremen respectively. 

Tuesday?s defeat of Barcelona by Chelsea means Spain will have no representatives in the last eight of the Champions League for the first time since this stage of the competition was introduced in the 1994-95 season. 

The eighth name to go into the draw at Uefa?s headquarters in Nyon on March 18 will be known next Tuesday after Inter Milan and European champions Porto meet in the second leg of their tie. They are level at 1-1 after the first leg in Portugal. 

Compared to Tuesday when 16 goals were scored in three matches, Wednesday?s fare was altogether tamer until the late drama in Turin where over 50,000 fans, nearly three times Juventus? usual Champions League crowds, came out to see Real?s stars. 

The Spanish side held their slender 1-0 advantage from the first leg until 15 minutes from the end of normal time when Trezeguet scored with a stunning effort. 

Then just as it seemed the match was destined to become the first in the knockout stages of the competition ever to be decided on penalties, Zalayeta slammed home the winner giving Real keeper Iker Casillas no chance from 10 metres. 

Bayern also lived dangerously in London but finally saw off fading English champions Arsenal despite losing 1-0 at Highbury. 

A superb 66th minute Thierry Henry goal was not enough to turn the tie the London side?s way after their 3-1 first leg loss in Germany two weeks ago. 

The defeat will be especially painful for Arsenal who watched city rivals Chelsea advance in style with a momentous win over Barcelona on Tuesday, yet have never got past the last eight in seven Champions League appearances themselves. 

Liverpool got the better of German opponents by winning 3-1 at Bayer Leverkusen to sail into the quarter finals on a 6-2 aggregate. Spaniard Luis Garcia scored twice and Milan Baros grabbed the other before Leverkusen got a consolation goal two minutes from time. 

PSV, European champions in 1988 but without any previous success in the Champions League before this season, made sure of their place in the last eight with a 2-0 win at last season?s beaten finalists AS Monaco for a 3-0 aggregate success. 

Striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink headed the Dutch League leaders in front from Mark van Bommel?s corner after 27 minutes and American substitute DaMarcus Beasley wrapped up the win with a close range goal 20 minutes from time. 

Monaco suffered more woe after 76 minutes when defender Gael Givet was shown a straight red card for a wild lunge on Peruvian striker Jefferson Farfan. (Reuters)

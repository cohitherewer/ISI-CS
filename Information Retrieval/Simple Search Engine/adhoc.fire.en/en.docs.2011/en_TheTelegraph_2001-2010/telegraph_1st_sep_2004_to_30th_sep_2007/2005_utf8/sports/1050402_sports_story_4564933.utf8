 Gagan Ajit, Daljit banned 

New Delhi: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) 

on Friday imposed ban on star forward Gagan Ajit Singh and Daljit Singh Dhillon 

for assaulting Indian Oil Corporation player Vikramjit Singh during the recent 

national hockey championship in Hyderabad. 

The three-month ban for Gagan Ajit and six-month ban for Daljit prevent the two players from participating in any recognised tournament both domestic and international, IHF said. 

The IHF disciplinary committee meted out the punishment 

after considering the reports of the tournament director, the enquiry committee 

and apologies of the two players. (PTI)

 Sachin begins light practice

 - Its important I look at long-term plans instead of short-term goals 

 Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai on Wednesday 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar has started light practice since Tuesday and says he is taking one step at a time in getting fit after undergoing elbow surgery in May. 

The master batsman also sounded cautious about whether he would be able to play in the two-Test series against Zimbabwe next month for which he has been selected subject to getting fit. 

I started practising yesterday. It was not a full session. I batted against season balls bowled at a slow pace of 40 kmph and not 90 mph which I have to face in matches. I faced around 35-40 balls, Sachin said on Wednesday. 

I have to take gradual steps (to get fit). The next step would be to practise longer with the season ball. I used to practice with a special ball, something which is in between (in hardness) a tennis and season ball so that the impact (on his operated elbow) is not too much, Sachin added. 

Asked whether he would be fit for the second half of the Zimbabwe tour, Sachin said, its too early to say as I have started practising only yesterday, he said. 

Sachin said he had not rushed his comeback into the national team last time around when he played two Tests against Australia and then took part in the full series in Bangladesh as well as the home rubber against Pakistan. 

Last time I did not have surgery. This time I had a tendon tear and had to undergo surgery. I dont think I rushed my comeback (last season), he said. 

I had played in the 2003 World Cup with an injured finger which was later operated upon. I was eager to play and contribute to the team. Sometimes it clicks, sometimes it doesnt, said the master batsman. 

Sachin, who spoke to reporters at a function to unveil mobile games for Nazara Technologies, said he was looking at long-term goals and not short-term gains on the fitness front. 

Its important I look at long-term plans instead of short-term goals. Thats why I feel even if it takes a couple of weeks more (in making the comeback), its okay, he said. 

I will know how much impact my elbow is going to take only when I practice and play more, he added. 

Sachin has been troubled by the elbow injury since August 2004 when the team went to play a tri-series in Holland. He did not play a single match in that rain-marred event. 

He travelled with the team, hoping his elbow would improve, to England for the NatWest Challenge one-day series, followed by the ICC Champions Trophy, but was not fit enough to take part. 

Sachin missed the first two Tests of the four-match home series against Australia that followed but came back into the team in the third Test in Nagpur. 

He missed Indias tri-nation engagement in Sri Lanka. He will miss the tri-series in Zimbabwe commencing later this month.

 McGrath makes light of England form

 - Brett Lee injury not serious, say scans; Jones hurts knee

 McGrath plays the mind game 

Australia have not allowed a stuttering start to derail their Ashes propaganda campaign. Glenn McGrath dismissed Englands Twenty20 victory Thursday with the words: They have improved, but I still feel they havent improved enough. 

McGrath, in an interview with A daily, dismissed three of Englands biggest names ? Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison and Michael Vaughan. 

Darren Gough bowled well and Jon Lewis bowled well and got some early wickets, but thats Twenty20 cricket, McGrath said. Harmison and Flintoff ? I probably expected a little bit more from them. 

As for Vaughan, McGrath added: He had a lot more confidence when he played against Australia the first time? whether or not a few failures and being captain has added pressure, he seems to be a bit more defensive. 

While the Australians ability to work a batsman out is legendary, McGrath has excelled himself here. His view of Vaughans batting on Monday was limited to one ball ? which Vaughan chipped to mid-on ? yet that was seemingly enough to detect a change of mind-set. 

Back in the real world, Australia coach John Buchanan admitted that his one-day spearhead, Brett Lee, was almost certain to sit out the weekends back-to-back Internationals against Bangladesh and England. 

Lee bowled four overs during Australias four-wicket defeat at Somerset on Wednesday. He left the field complaining of a sore shoulder, and was driven to London Thursday for a scan. Buchanan said: Even if it is good news we would probably err on the side of caution. 

[AFP adds from Sydney that scans have cleared Lee of any serious damage to his right shoulder and he hopes to play against England and Bangladesh, Cricket Australia said Friday. 

[Lee and Australian team physiotherapist Errol Alcott travelled to London to seek specialist advice. 

[Doctors determined that lee had suffered bruising to the front of the shoulder after being hit by the ball when batting during Australias 100-run Twenty20 defeat to England on Monday and this might have caused some restriction to his bowling action 

 This change of action has exacerbated a previous minor, shoulder injury Lee sustained four years ago, Cricket Australia said in a statement. 

[Team doctors said the prognosis for lee was good and the condition was expected to settle down quickly. He will be monitored and reviewed tomorrow before the team for Australias first match of the NatWest series Saturday is selected, it said. 

[I am relieved there is no major damage and I am looking forward to playing for australia in this up-coming series, said Lee. 

[Another report from London says Simon Jones is to undergo a scan after injuring his right knee during the warm-up before the Bangladesh tie. England captain Michael Vaughan said that he did not know how bad Jones injury was. 

[The fast bowler ruptured ligaments in the same knee on the Ashes tour to Australia in 2002-3 and did not play for England again for 15 months.] 

With all-rounder Shane Watson proving expensive during the Somerset debacle, Australia are expected to bring in left-arm wrist-spinner Brad Hogg. McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz ? who went for 11 an over at Taunton ? will make up a three-pronged seam attack. 

England maintained their smooth progress in Thursdays NatWest Series opener at the Oval, motoring past Bangladeshs 190 with 25 overs and all 10 wickets to spare. We keep gaining momentum, Vaughan said. Now its important for us to take it into Sundays game against Australia. We were happy to see Australia failing to defend 340 against Somerset.

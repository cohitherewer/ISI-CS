 Bond has Indians on the run again

 Pathan exults after taking one of

 his three victims

Bulawayo:Indian captain Sourav Ganguly and his New Zealand counterpart Stephen Fleming chose to dwell on one factor which could have an immense bearing in the tri-series ? the Shane Bond factor. 

After the match, Fleming lost little time in declaring he will have a psychological hold over Indians in coming games. 

He was difficult for them in the World Cup and now he again has them on the run, said Fleming, adding that it was remarkable the way Bond worked up pace and bounce on such a benign wicket. 

Sourav acknowledged the Bond factor and said it is up to his top-order batsmen to come up with an answer. I wouldnt say whether they should try to attack or defend or just see him through. Everyone has his own way of dealing with issues. 

 But yes, we have to find a way to ensure he doesnt get early wickets. Probably we have to play him on merit and back ourselves a bit more against him. 

Fleming said he felt happy the way his middle-order batsmen turned things around and the way Bond came back to make his presence felt. 

It was a good recovery by our middle-order. But it was Bond who made us believe that we could defend the small total. In just five overs, he raised visions for our win. Without him we were probably 50-60 runs too short. They fought well but having Bond in reserve for three more overs was great. 

Sourav praised J.P. Yadav and Irfan Pathan who raised the possibility of a win. They batted very well but there was always this danger that just one wicket and it could be all over for us. (agencies)

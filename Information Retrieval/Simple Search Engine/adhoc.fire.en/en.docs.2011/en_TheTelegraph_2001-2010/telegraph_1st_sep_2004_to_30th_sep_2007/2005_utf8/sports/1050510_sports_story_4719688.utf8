 Zaheer focusing on fitness

Mumbai: Team India left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan on Monday said he was neither disappointed nor surprised at being ignored in the list of 30 ICC World XI probables chosen for the Johnnie Walker Super Series against Australia in October. 

?Right now I want to concentrate on my fitness. I am working towards that goal for the season ahead. This break has given me a chance to do so,? the Baroda said. 

?I may go to train at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai,? Zaheer said. 

Zaheer, who broke down during the 2003-04 series in Australia and didnt bowl at full steam in Pakistan, looked much fresher in the recent home series against the Pakistanis.

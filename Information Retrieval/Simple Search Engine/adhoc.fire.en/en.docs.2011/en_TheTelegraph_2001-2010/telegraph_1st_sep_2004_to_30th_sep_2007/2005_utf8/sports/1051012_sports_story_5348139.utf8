 Liam Plunkett replaces Simon Jones

London: Uncapped pacer Liam Plunkett will replace the injured Simon Jones in Englands Test squad for the tour of Pakistan which starts later this month. 

Jones was ruled out last week after failing to recover from an ankle injury he suffered during the fourth Ashes Test in August. 

Ive tried to perform well this year and to now be in the England Test squad is fantastic, Plunkett said on Tuesday. 

Just to be a part of the Test squad is massive for me. Even if I dont get to play in Pakistan, Ill learn so much from being around such a quality group of players, he added. 

The 20-year-old Durham player has also been named in the one-day squad. The tour comprises three Tests and five limited-over matches. 

A decision on Chris Tremletts participation will be made later this week. The Hampshire bowler is receiving treatment for a right knee injury. 

Chris Tremlett has undergone fitness test, however the medical staff will continue to monitor him before making a decision on his availability at the end of the week, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman of selectors David Graveney said.

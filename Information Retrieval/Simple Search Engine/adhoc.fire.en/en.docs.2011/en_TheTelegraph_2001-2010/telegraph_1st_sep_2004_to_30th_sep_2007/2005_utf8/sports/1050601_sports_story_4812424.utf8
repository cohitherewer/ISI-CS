The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wednesday, June 01, 2005 

 London: England defender Rio Ferdinand could become the first big name to leave Malcolm Glazer?s Manchester United if he refuses a final ?100,000-a-week contract offer.

 Despite manager Alex Ferguson?s insistence the 26-year-old would not be allowed to leave, The Daily Telegraph reported that American tycoon Glazer has decided the five-year deal to replace the final two years of his contract was Ferdinand?s last offer.

 Ferdinand was in the news for other reasons on Tuesday when a British tabloid reported he was among a group of footballers questioned after alleged stag party high jinks at a hotel.

 Madrid: Atletico Madrid coach Cesar Ferrando has been dismissed, the Primera Liga club announced on Tuesday.

 Ferrando joined Atletico from Albacete last June on a one-year contract, which was extended by another 12 months in November, but failed to lead the club into Europe this season.

 They did not register a win in their last eight league games of the campaign to finish 11th in the table and were knocked out in the semi-finals of the King?s Cup by Osasuna.

 A successor has not been named. 

 Tbilisi: Crowd violence on the final day of the Georgian season overshadowed Dinamo Tbilisi?s record-breaking title celebrations.

 Tbilisi beat Dinamo Batumi 3-0 on Monday to capture their 12th crown since the championship was held for the first time in 1990, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

 A match in Kutaisi between local side Torpedo, who trailed Dinamo by two points before the last round of matches, and FC Tbilisi was abandoned when rioting fans invaded the pitch with five minutes to go and the home team leading 1-0.

 Santiago: Chile striker Marcelo Salas criticised the country?s football directors on Monday for sacking coach Juvenal Olmos with five matches to play in the South American World Cup qualifying group. Chile face Bolivia on Saturday in their first match under Nelson Acosta, who was brought in for aa second stint after Olmos was fired in April.

 Salas, who scored a hattrick for Argentina?s River Plate in a Libertadores Cup tie against LDU last week, said he had considered boycotting the team. Chile last reached the World Cup in 1998 when Acosta was last in charge. 

 Stockholm: Sweden striker Henrik Larsson is to stay with Spanish champions Barcelona for at least one more season. 

 The 33-year-old was given the option of extending his contract until June 2006 after he tore the cruciate ligament in his left knee during the 3-0 win over Real Madrid in November. 

 ?It?s a flattering offer and I?ve decided to accept it,? Larsson said on Monday.

 Raleigh: Tim Montgomery is planning to compete at the Prefontaine Classic, two days before a hearing in front of the CAS on doping charges that could ban him for life.

 ?He?s running,? a source close to the sprinter said on Monday when asked about world record holder Montgomery?s appearance in the 100 metres in Saturday?s Grand Prix meeting in Eugene, Oregon.

 Organiser Tom Jordan would not confirm Montgomery?s entry.

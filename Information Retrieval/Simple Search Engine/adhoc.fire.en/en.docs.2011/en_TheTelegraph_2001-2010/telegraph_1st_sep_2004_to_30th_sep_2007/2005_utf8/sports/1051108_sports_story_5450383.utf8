 Shiv Kapur up to No. 17 

 Shiv is the third highest Indian on the merit list 

New Delhi: Shiv Kapurs terrific run in recent weeks, including a second place finish at the Double A International, has propelled the rookie to the 17th spot on the Asian Order of Merit. 

The Indian golfer has had a series of top ten finishes but squandered an opportunity to take the title at St Andrews Hill Golf Club on Sunday when he lost in the play-off to a 17-year-old Thai amateur, Chinarat Phadsungil. 

The 23-year-old has earned more than $85,000 in his last six starts and his exploits last week fetched him $47,250, his highest cheque yet. 

It was the second successive week that an Indian had finished second on the Asian Tour after Gaurav Ghei at the Hero Honda Indian Open. 

With $114,503 in 18 starts this season, Kapur is the third highest Indian on the Asian Order of Merit after Jyoti Randhawa (third) and Jeev Milkha Singh (15th). 

Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant has earned $451,920 with 23 starts and holds the top spot. 

Five Indians ? Randhawa, Jeev, Kapur, Ghei (43rd) and Harmeet Kahlon (44th) ? are in the top 60 and assured of a berth in the year-ending Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok in December. (PTI)

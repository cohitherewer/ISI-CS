 Rain plays spoilsport

 Teams to stay put till Tuesday

New Delhi: The deluge which hit the capital on Saturday morning ruled out any tennis on Day II of the Davis Cup World Group play-off tie at the R.K. Khanna Stadium. And unless there is a dramatic change in the weather overnight, there is little likelihood of getting a full days action on Sunday. 

With even the second singles between Thomas Johansson and Rohan Bopanna in this India versus Sweden clash still not over, the tie will have to be extended to Monday unless one team takes an unbeatable lead by Day III. 

As things stand, Sweden have a better chance being already one up. But Johannsson ? who is leading 7-6 (7-3), 6-6 (5-0) ? will have to beat Bopanna quickly and then Sweden have to win one more rubber, either the doubles (Jonas Bjorkman and Simon Aspelin vesus Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi) or the first reverse singles between Johansson and Prakash (as of now). 

Thats a tall order considering the battering Delhi took Saturday from the weathergod. The grasscourt at the R.K. Khanna has been covered since Friday afternoon, but its just a sheet of tarpaulin being used for damage control. Around the covered area, there were pools of water and there is bound to be some sweating, if not dripping, into the court once the cover is taken off. 

According to referee Wayne McKewen, the covers will be taken off only after the rain has subsided fully. The skies were all dull and grey till late on Saturday night, so one has to keep fingers crossed. 

As per Davis Cup rules, the teams will have to stay put till Tuesday if a result hasnt been obtained by then. We have to see how things are tomorrow (Sunday) morning? I have no idea how wet the court is, McKewen said shortly after officially calling off play at 2 pm. 

In case the heavens relent on Sunday but the court is not fit to play, the referee can shift the remaining matches to hardcourts (which are there at the same complex) after taking the two captains consent. That would be to Swedens advantage, but as Paes told The Telegraph, they may not have an option. 

If we refuse to play on hardcourts and the tie remains unfinished even on Tuesday, the ITF could pull up India for providing inadequate covers and reschedule the tie in Sweden or at a neutral venue. That will be worse for us, Paes explained.

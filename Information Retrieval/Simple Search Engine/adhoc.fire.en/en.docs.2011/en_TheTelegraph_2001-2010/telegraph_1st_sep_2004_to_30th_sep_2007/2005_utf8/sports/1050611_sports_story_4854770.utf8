Calcutta: Sporting Union countered the heat and humidity well to post a comfortable five-wicket victory over CAB Presidents XI to ensure a berth in the final of the P. Sen Trophy at the Eden, on Friday. 

CAB won the toss and expectedly, chose to bat in the oppressive heat. A combination of good bowling by Asok Kumar Dinda (4/62), Ranadeb Bose (2/40) and pretty irresponsible batting by the CAB top and middle-order saw Deep Dasguptas side slump to 91 for six. 

Dinda, spurred maybe by the fact that he would be flying off to Australia to take a 21-day training under former Aussie international Damien Fleming, looked good. 

It was left to Rana Chowdhury and Ayan Nandi, however, to stem the CAB XI rot and they stitched a 91-run stand for the seventh wicket. 

Facing a target of 233, Sporting Union had early hiccups. Presidents XI boys complicated the plot by indifferent fielding. 

Charanjit Singh (58) was the highest scorer for Sporting, who, together with Alokendu Lahiri (56), built a solid platform. The finishing touches were provided by Sanjib Goel (44-ball 41) and Avijit Ganguly (39 ..). Sporting reached home two overs too soon. 

Meanwhile, Bengal mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose will leave the city on June 22 to attend the MRF Pace Foundation camp in Chennai, along with fellow pacers Shib Shankar Paul and Sabir Ali. 

Ranadeb, whose side Sporting Union will take on Shambazar on Sunday in the P. Sen final, said he is eager to have a go at Mahendra Singh Dhoni to see who can get on top. 

If he is really good, he will hit me around, otherwise its a matter of just one ball?, he said. 

BRIEF SCORES 

CAB Presidents XI 232/9 in 50 ovs (Rana Chowdhury 56; Asok Dinda 4/62). Sporting Union 233/5 in 48 ovs (Charanjit Singh 58, Alokendu Lahiri 56). Sporting Union won by 5 wkts.

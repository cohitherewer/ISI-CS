The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand crushes Vallejo

 - MONACO CHESS 

- Kramnik too good for Topalov 

 Anand completed his third successive 2-0 sweep 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand?s amazing run continued as he completed his third successive 2-0 sweep in the 14th Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament at the Monte Carlo Grand Hotel in Monaco. The Indian ace, sponsored by NIIT, beat Francisco Pons Vallejo in both blindfold and rapid games to take his tally to six. 

Both the blindfold and rapid games looked like headed for a draw. But Anand capitalised on Vallejo?s mistakes to ensure wins. 

Vladimir Kramnik too won his third straight blindfold game. Meanwhile, Alexei Shirov?s poor run continued as he lost all his blindfold games and drawn only one rapid. 

Anand proved that he was many notches ahead when it came to handling younger opponents. 

Giving a fantastic opening display in one of the most attacking variations against the Nazdorf in the blindfold game, Anand made sure he got enough attack after a routine piece sacrifice and Vallejo simply had no answers in the late middle game as he was forced to part with his queen. The game lasted just 32 moves. 

In the rapid game, Vallejo fought harder but Anand proved that he was champion in this form as he simply rode on the waves of success yet again. 

The Indian ace later conceded that it was a topsy-turvy game. Starting out with his English opening as white, Vallejo had things going fine till about move 30 but soon after Anand?s pieces created irresistible threats. The Spaniard called it a day after 60 moves. 

Kramnik ensured that at least in the blindfold he remained on a par with Anand with his third win on the trot in the section. 

On the receiving end this time was Topalov who surprisingly has lost all his blindfold games so far. 

Topalov is fresh from his triumph at Linares Super Grandmasters tournament where he finished equal to Russian Garri Kasparov. 

However, here ever since the beginning, Topalov is finding the going tough and Kramnik?s drubbing was another indication that this was a totally different ball game from usual chess. 

Topalov was up against an anti marshall and was subjected to an attack against his king after his counter play bid was successfully foiled. 

Kramnik, the overall joint winner here last year and clearly a cut above the rest in the blindfold, made merry after an erroneous plan by the Bulgarian and romped home in 51 moves. 

In the rapid though, the Bulgarian made sure things did not go out of hands and followed an earlier game of the tournament played between Bareev and Leko. 

However, Kramnik improved on that game on move 14 and after 21 moves the peace was signed.

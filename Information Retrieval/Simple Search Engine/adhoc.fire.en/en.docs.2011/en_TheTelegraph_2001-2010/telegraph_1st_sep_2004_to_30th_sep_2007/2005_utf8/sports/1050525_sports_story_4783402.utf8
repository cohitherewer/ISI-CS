 A dream year, says Strauss

London: England opener Andrew Strauss rounded off what he has described as a dream year by being named Englands Player of the Year. 

The 28-year-old South African-born Middlesex batsman has scored five centuries since making his debut last summer. 

It has gone far better than I ever thought it would, said Strauss, who was Man-of-the-Series in South Africa last winter after making 656 runs, including three centuries. 

Its a great honour. The key was getting runs early on and proving to myself I could play at that level. 

Strauss, though, has been in poor form for his County since the start of the season but Test minnows Bangladesh will not relish bowling to him at Lords when the first Test starts on Thursday. 

Strauss arrival in the England team also produced their record winning-streak as they went on to win their next eight matches. It is easier to perform in a successful side, he said. You can afford to go out and be positive about the way you play and back your gameplan. 

We have all fed off each other over the past year. 

 The only chance I have had to sit down and reflect upon what has happened was after the tour of South Africa. 

When we did get a break I just thought that was a hell of a 12 months. I really have been living the dream. (AFP)

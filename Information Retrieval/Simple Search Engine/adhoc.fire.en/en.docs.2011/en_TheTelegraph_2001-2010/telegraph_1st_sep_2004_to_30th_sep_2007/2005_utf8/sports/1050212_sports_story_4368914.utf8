 Mickelson leads

 - US NATl PRO-AM 

Pebble Beach: Phil Mickelson continued his blistering form by firing a tournament record 10-under-par 62 to race three shots clear of the field after the first round of the $5.3 million Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on Thursday. 

The US Masters champion, fresh from a five-stroke victory in last week?s Phoenix Open which included a course record-equalling 11-under 60, carried his momentum to California?s Monterey Peninsula. 

Mickelson, who won the Pebble Beach title in 1998, produced a bogey-free round in perfect conditions at Spyglass Hill golf club, one of three courses being used this week. 

Charles Howell III, Davis Love III, Hunter Mahan, Kevin Sutherland and Sweden?s Daniel Chopra were tied for second place on seven-under 65., 

Spyglass Hill is rated the toughest of the three courses being used in a rotation that includes the Pebble Beach Golf Links and Poppy Hill. 

Canada?s Mike Weir, the 2003 US Masters champion, was four behind the leader on 66 alongside Mario Tiziani and Dicky Pride. 

Mickelson made a fine start, opening with back-to-back birdies, and ended his round the same way with birdies on 17 and 18. 

World No. 1 and defending champion Vijai Singh struggled to a one-over 73. 

Meanwhile, India?s Arjun Atwal returned a card of four-under 68, along with 12 others.

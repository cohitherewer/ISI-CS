Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting suffered their second defeat in the Premier Division when they lost to Tollygunge Agragami by the odd goal in three at Kalyani on Friday. For Tollygunge, it was their first win in the fifth match. 

Mohammedan Sporting hardly did justice to their reputation and could have lost by a bigger margin. They lost control of the midfield early and a porous defence compounded their problems. 

Tollygunge took the lead in the 73rd minute through Ayan Chowdhury. Mohammedan Sporting, however, equalised five minutes later when Raman Vijayan struck an opportunistic goal. 

Tollygunges Sheikh Azim put it beyond the black-and-white brigade two minutes before the scheduled close. 

Mohammedan Sporting now have nine points from five matches while Tollygunge have four from similar number of games.

 Anand shocked in Game I

 Anand suffered his first ever loss to Kasimdzhanov 

Leon: Viswanathan Anand suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the first game of the 18th Magistral Ciudad de Leon meet final on Sunday. 

Anand, who trails 0-1, will be under tremendous pressure to perform in the remaining three games. 

A winner here thrice, Anand now needs at least to level scores to move to the tie-break stage wherein the blitz games will come into effect to determine the winner. 

Surprisingly, this was Anands first ever loss against Kasimdzhanov whom he had beaten convincingly in the final of the Hyderabad World Cup in 2002. Their last mini match during the Linares tournament earlier this year had ended in a 1.5-0.5 victory for the Indian. 

It was a sharp Sicilian defence that gave Kasimdzhanov an unexpected victory. His emergence as a star in the rapid form of the game should be sending alarm signals to the chess elite. 

Playing white, Kasimdzhanov went for Anands king in all possible ways even though it was an extremely complicated game. The Uzbek did not falter in capitalising on his advantage when he finally got it. 

Wild manoeuvres in the middlegame wherein Anands king went for a long walk, and a well-utilised endgame skill helped Kasimdzhanov get an early lead. 

In the second semi-final earlier, Anand proved too good for teenaged Grandmaster Magnus Carlsen of Norway and scored a thumping 3-1 victory. 

It turned out to be a one-sided affair as Anand gave no chance to his 14-year-old opponent and squeezed out victories in the first and third games while drawing the remaining two in the four-game match. 

On Friday, Kasimdzhanov had given a similar treatment to Shirov who went down in the first and third game and drew the remaining like Carlsen.

 Mistakes of Aussie series won?t be repeated: Sehwag

 - We?re all preparing in match situations and that?s most important, says dashing opener

New Delhi: Swashbuckling opener Virender Sehwag Sunday said India would not repeat the mistakes that cost them the series against Australia when they take on Pakistan in the upcoming series. 

Sehwag said whereas India were punished for lack of preparation by the Aussies, the players would be well tuned after playing in domestic cricket when they take on Pakistan in three Tests and six one-day Internationals beginning early next month. 

?The Deodhar Trophy, the Challenger Series and the Duleep Trophy have seen international players compete and give their best. We are all preparing in match situations and match practice is most important,? Sehwag said. 

?We are not having any camps (like we did against Australia), camps are mainly for fitness and training. Now we are in the middle of a season, and all batsmen have shown they are in form,? the Delhi batsman said. 

Sehwag did not agree that he reserves his best for Pakistan. ?That is not true because it would mean I have not done well against other teams. It is just that there is some pressure and excitement when playing against Pakistan that brings out that extra bit in your performance,? he said. 

The flamboyant player also said the absence of Shoaib Akhtar will not affect the visitors? chances in the coming series. 

?Shoaib?s absence will not matter. Pakistan have other bowlers who can do well, like Rana (Naved-Ul Hasan) and (Danish) Kaneria. They also did well in the one-day series against Australia. To bowl out Australia for less than 250 is a good achievement,? he said. 

Sehwag said constant changes in the opening combination did not affect his batting. ?Not at all. I always concentrate on my batting, not on my partner.? 

He said neither the non-cricketing issues surrounding the visit by Pakistan, nor the change in rule with regard to illegal bowling actions were a problem. ?It is not an issue for us. It is for the two boards to deal with,? he said when asked to comment on the controversy surrounding Ahmedabad as a Test venue and the pitch-digging attempts by some Shiv Sena activists in Mohali. 

Asked if the batsmen would be at a disadvantage following the ICC?s decision to allow bowlers to straighten their arm from a 15 degree bend, Sehwag said: ?I dont think a batsman is going to be worried about how much the bowler is bending his arm. It is the swing and seam that is going to bother him.? 

He refused to respond to a question as to whether it was proper to play an international match on a virgin pitch which would be laid out at the Kotla. 

Kotla, Sehwag?s home ground, is under renovation and work is on at a feverish pace to get the pitch ready for the series-concluding one-dayer. 

During the day, Sehwag was at a promotional in a city restaurant. He interacted with children, but the element of fun was taken out of the visit by unruly photographers who made life difficult for the kids despite Sehwag?s pleading.

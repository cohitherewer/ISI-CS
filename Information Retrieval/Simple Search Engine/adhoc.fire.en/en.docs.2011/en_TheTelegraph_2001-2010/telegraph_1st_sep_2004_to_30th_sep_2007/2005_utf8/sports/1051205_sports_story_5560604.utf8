 Vaughan heads home

Lahore: England captain Michael Vaughan returned home early on Sunday to get an expert opinion on a knee injury ahead of the one-day series against Pakistan. 

I will see a specialist on Monday and get an opinion on my right knee, Vaughan said after his Ashes-winning side lost a three-Test series 2-0 against Pakistan on Saturday. 

Vaughan, 31, suffered the injury during a warm-up match which forced him to skip the first Test at Multan last month. 

England lost the first Test by 22 runs and drew the second at Faisalabad before being thrashed by an innings and 100 runs in the final match here. 

This was Englands first Test series defeat after winning six in a row, including the Ashes against formidable Australia in September, under Vaughans captaincy. 

The team management said if Vaughan needed an operation he might not return for the five one-dayers against the hosts and opener Marcus Trescothick would lead the side. The first ODI is on Saturday. (AFP)

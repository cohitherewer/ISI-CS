The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chelsea win, Liverpool falter

London: Striker Eidur Gudjohnsen kept Chelsea on course for their first league title in 50 years with the winner in a scrappy 1-0 victory over 10-man Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. 

Gudjohnsen poked in a rebound 20 minutes from time after William Gallas? effort hit the bar to end some brave resistance by Everton, who played all but eight minutes of the match a man short after striker James Beattie?s foolish dismissal. Everton?s record ?6 million ($11.19 million) signing was given a straight red card, the first of his career, for twice head-butting the back of French defender Gallas? head as he chased an early through ball. 

In Saturday?s other games, fifth-placed Liverpool stumbled again, losing 0-2 at Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers beat fellow strugglers Norwich City 3-0. Aston Villa won 2-1 at Portsmouth. (REUTERS)

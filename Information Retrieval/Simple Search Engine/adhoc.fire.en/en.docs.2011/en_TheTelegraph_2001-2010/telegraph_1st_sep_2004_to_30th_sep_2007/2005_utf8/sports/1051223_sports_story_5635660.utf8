 CA warns Aussie fans

Sydney: Cricket fans in Australia have been threatened with on-the-spot fines and stadium bans in a crackdown on racism, officials said on Thursday. 

Members of the South African team complained of racial abuse during the opening Test in Perth, a week after Sydney was rocked by two nights of racial violence. 

Cricket Australia (CA) has ordered a review of security arrangements for the second Test, starting in Melbourne on Monday, officials said at a news conference on Thursday. 

According to local newspapers, the South Africans were called kaffirs and kaffir boeties, derogatory terms for black people and black sympathisers, during the Test in Perth. 

Security staff at the match did not take action because they were unaware of what the terms meant. Perth has a large expatriate South African community.

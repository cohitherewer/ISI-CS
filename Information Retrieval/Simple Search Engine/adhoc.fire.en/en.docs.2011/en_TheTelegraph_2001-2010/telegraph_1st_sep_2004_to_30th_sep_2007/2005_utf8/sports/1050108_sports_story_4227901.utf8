The Telegraph - Calcutta

 MCG match a sellout, says CA

 - Tie to be telecast to 122 countries 

Sydney: Australian cricket authorities on Friday declared the tsunami fund-raising match between the ICC XI and an Asia XI a sellout, that would raise millions of dollars for disaster victims. 

Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland said no more tickets were available for Monday?s match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. ?We are overwhelmed by the support shown by all parties involved with this match, particularly the Australian cricketing public,? Sutherland said. 

?To sell approximately 56,000 tickets in just three days is an amazing effort... We?re certainly hoping to raise several million dollars.? 

He was confident that remaining tickets at the 80,000 capacity ground, which are reserved for MCG members and their guests, would be snapped up over the weekend. 

England paceman Darren Gough said he was excited to play alongside some of his cricketing heroes for a worthy cause. ?It?s great to play in the same team with cricketers you?ve admired and played against all your life ? Shane Warne and Brian Lara, just to name a couple.? 

 Worldwide appeal 

Meanwhile, the tsunami fund-raiser at MCG would be broadcasted in as many as 122 countries across the globe, the ICC announced here on Friday, a report adds from London. 

The match would be available to TV viewers in 122 countries throughout Africa, Asia, Asia Pacific, the Caribbean, the Middle East, North America and Europe, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said in a release. ?The response from broadcasters has been fantastic and we are delighted that the match will be available to viewers in so many countries, including many of those affected by the tsunami,? Speed said. 

?These broadcasters have all donated to the world cricket tsunami appeal and during the match, viewers will be encouraged to contribute.?

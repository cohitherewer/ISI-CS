Wellington: Adam Gilchrist smashed an unbeaten half-century and Glenn McGrath edged closer to his 500th career wicket as Australia seized control of the third and final Test with New Zealand on Monday. 

Gilchrist smashed 60 not out from 62 balls to help Australia post a first-innings total of 383 and grab a 91-run lead in Auckland. 

McGrath, bidding to become the fourth bowler to take 500 Test wickets, then took his career total to 497 when dismissing Craig Cumming and James Marshall, leaving New Zealand in deep trouble at 11 for two when bad light stopped play on the third day at Eden Park. 

The lanky paceman trapped Cumming leg-before with the second ball of the innings then removed Marshall for three when the debutant fended a ball to Justin Langer at third slip. 

Marshall?s identical twin brother Hamish survived a torrid examination to reach the close unbeaten on three with skipper Stephen Fleming on one. 

Gilchrist?s swashbuckling half-century was a key contribution after they had led by just 11 runs with two wickets in hand. 

The left-hander, who had scored centuries in the two previous Tests, tore into the bowlers, belting 10 boundaries and a six in a record ninth-wicket stand of 74 with Michael Kasprowicz before he ran out of partners. 

James Franklin mopped up the last four wickets to finish with career-best figures of six for 119 from 26.1 overs on a day that was interrupted by several rain delays. 

Australia, 1-0 up in the series, had resumed on 219 for four but lost Michael Clarke in the sixth over and then three more wickets after lunch. 

Fleming dropped Clarke on 19 but his luck deserted him on 22 when he was run out at the non-striker?s end by a direct hit from James Marshall. 

Nightwatchman Jason Gillespie batted through the first session, frustrating the Black Caps with his sound defensive technique. 

He departed for 35 after lunch when he edged paceman Chris Martin to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. 

Simon Katich, in his 16th appearance, passed 1,000 Test runs before he also went for 35, miscuing an attempted pull off Franklin to give Paul Wiseman a simple catch at mid-on. 

Franklin also dismissed Shane Warne for one, caught by Fleming at first slip, before removing Kasprowicz and McGrath to complete his six-wicket haul.

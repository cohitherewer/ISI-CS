 Bangladesh survive Day 2

 Ian Bell 

Chester-le-Street: Opener Javed Omar fought hard to be unbeaten on 60 as Bangladesh reached 108 for three at tea on Day 2 of the and final Test versus England on Saturday. 

Englands hopes of a two-day kill were thwarted as Bangladesh pushed the match to Day 3. The tourists produced a stubborn display to close on 296 for eight. Javed Omar (71), Aftab Ahmed (67 batting) and Habibul Bashar (63) kept Bangladesh afloat. Matthew Hoggard and Andrew Flintoff took three wickets apiece. 

Omar scored Bangladeshs first individual fifty of the series ? and captain Habibul Bashar was on six. 

Earlier Ian Bells maiden Test hundred powered England to 447 for three declared. Bell finished on an unbeaten 162 and together with Graham Thorpe, who marked his 100th Test with an unbeaten 66, put on an unbroken 187 for the fourth wicket before the declaration. 

That left Bangladesh facing a minimum 60 overs before stumps. But they responded positively with an opening stand of 50 between Omar and Nafees Iqbal, their best for any wicket either in this match or in their innings and 261-run first Test defeat. 

The stand ended under controversial circumstances when Iqbal, on 15, gloved a ball from Andrew Flintoff. Wicketkeeper Geraint Jones claimed the catch, but replays suggested the ball had bounced in front of his gloves. (AFP)

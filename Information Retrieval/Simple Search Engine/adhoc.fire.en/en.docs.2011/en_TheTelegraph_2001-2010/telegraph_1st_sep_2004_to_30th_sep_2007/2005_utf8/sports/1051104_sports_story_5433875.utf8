 Ferguson orders United players to pull up socks

 - We cant afford to start feeling sorry for ourselves 

 Ferguson feels the young players need time 

Manchester: Sir Alex Ferguson has ordered his ailing team to pick themselves up if they want to save a season which already looks like turning into a nightmare. 

A disastrous week for Manchester United which started with a 4-1 hammering at Middlesbrough that launched an unprecedented volley of personal abuse from Roy Keane, continued at the Stade de France on Wednesday night with a 1-0 defeat to Lille that leaves their Champions League hopes hanging by a thread. 

Now Ferguson has to find some way of rallying his men to face the challenge of Premiership leaders Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

Losing matches does not help confidence, that is for sure, said Ferguson. 

But we cannot afford to start feeling sorry for ourselves. 

We tried our best against Lille and while I dont think we did enough to win the game, we didnt deserve to lose either. 

It is hard for the young players. We cannot expect them to show the same experience the older ones have. 

We just have to see it through. It is not a problem. We just have to trust them. 

Keane is set to meet his teammates for the first time on Thursday since news of his damaging interview emerged on Monday night. 

The details of the Irishmans brutal assessment of the defeat at Middlesbrough will probably never be known but the bits which have leaked out struck a chord with the United fans, judging by their reaction in Paris. 

A 5,000-strong travelling army bellowed the Irishmans name before kick-off, after the match had started and, tellingly, at the final whistle when they turned on their team, with the exception of Ruud Van Nistelrooy. 

Without question, those fans want to see us win, Ferguson said. 

They have followed us through thick and thin, which is what real fans do. They were like that when we had not won the title for 20 years and I am sure they will be like that again. 

Although Ferguson refuses to accept there are fundamental problems with his team, the alarm bells will really be ringing if they suffer a repeat of the 3-1 home defeat they suffered at Chelseas hands last term. 

United were a clear second best on that occasion, and with Jose Mourinhos side desperate to emphasise their current superiority, there must be a genuine fear of another heavy defeat. 

But Ferguson is relishing the prospect of battle. 

I feel okay about Sunday, he said. Obviously, we have a very difficult task playing a team in outstanding form who are top of the league.

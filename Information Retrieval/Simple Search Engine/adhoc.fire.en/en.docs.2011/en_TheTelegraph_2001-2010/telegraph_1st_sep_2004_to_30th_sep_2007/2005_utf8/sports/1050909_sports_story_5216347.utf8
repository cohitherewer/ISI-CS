Calcutta: It was an Indo-Pak duel with a difference. It happened on a squash court, at the Calcutta Racket Club. But there was no mistaking the intensity and fierce competitive edge that characterises all contests featuring these traditional rivals on any stage. 

The Indian, in the form of Ritwik Bhattacharya, lost out in four violent games (11-10, 7-11, 9-11, 8-11) lasting an hour and four minutes, paving the way for Khayal Muhammad to enter the semi-finals of the Calcutta International Squash Championship. 

On Friday, Khayal will face Malaysian top seed Mohammad Azlan Sikandar who eased past Basit Ashfaq (Pakistan) 11-3, 11-2, 11-5. 

The other semi-final will pit second seed Cameron Pilley against Shahier Razik. While Pilley shut out Englishman Stacey Ross 11-5, 11-5, 8-11, 11-10 (2-0) in 59 minutes, Razik ousted Alister Walker 11-9, 11-5, 9-11, 11-2 in 55 minutes. 

The spotlight on quarter finals day was all on the Ritwik-Khayal clash. Both with world ranking in the 60s, there wasnt much to choose from in terms of talent and skill. The difference was in approach. 

The tall and wiry Ritwik relied on his court-manoeuvring ability, while the stocky Khayal didnt hesitate to use his bodyweight at the slightest pretext. Ritwik took game I after a titanic struggle. Thereafter, Khayal changed tactics and resorted to frequent blocking, arguing and questioning of calls. 

It obviously got to Ritwik as he lapsed into a series of unforced errors. Ritwik got so frustrated, he copied his opponents methods ? and failed miserably. The result was a dog fight which turned ugly far too frequently. 

He was blocking me deliberately, the referee was too weak and didnt interfere, Ritwik was to say later. The match became physical, I dont like it that way. 

The top-ranked Indian admitted he lost rhythm from the second game. I couldnt play my normal game, I was not in the zone, so you saw a lot of errors, said Ritwik whose next events will be the Hungarian Open and British Open.

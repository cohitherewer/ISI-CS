Ahmedabad: Captain Rahul Dravid did not attend nets Friday due to the after-effects of the antibiotics he took in Delhi before the second Test against Sri Lanka. 

It was decided that he would rest today. He will practice tomorrow, media manager Wg Cdr M. Baladitya told reporters here. 

All other Indian players practised Friday, including Punjab pacer V. R. V. Singh, who has been specifically asked to be with the team and bowl at nets. 

The Lankans also had a practice session in the morning. 

The BCCI will felicitate Sachin Tendulkar, for his 35th Test century, and Anil Kumble, who will play his 100th match here, before the start of the third Test. 

Board president Sharad Pawar will be present among others. 

Meanwhile, no final decision has yet been taken on the Indians conditioning camp before their departure for Pakistan. (PTI)

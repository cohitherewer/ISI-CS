 BCCI effects changes in England itinerary

 - Nair surprised at Guwahati being retained as ODI venue 

Mumbai: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary S.K. Nair on Saturday reacted sharply to the changes in the fixtures for next years England tour of India. 

He expressed surprise at the how the BCCIs tours programmes and fixtures committee retained Guwahati as one of the venues for the best-of-seven one-day International contest against England in April, knocking off two other centres from the list decided by an earlier committee. 

The maximum objections (from the England and Wales Cricket Board) were over Guwahati. That has been retained, while Cuttack and Vizag have been taken off. I leave it to you to read between the lines, he remarked. 

He was referring to the Assam Cricket Associations support for Sharad Pawar in his quest to take over the reins of the BCCI at the November 29 AGM in Calcutta. 

Earlier in the day, the BCCI the sub-committee changed the venues of the warm-up games against England ? that led to the ECBs displeasure ? from Jamshedur and Agartala to Vadodara and the Cricket Club of Indias Brabourne Stadium. 

If Mohali gets to host the Test against England then the one-day tie against the same opponents scheduled there in April would be moved to Jamshedpur, BCCI vice-president Shashank Manohar said, adding the other Test and ODI venues remained the same. 

The other two Tests are to be held in Nagpur and Mumbai while Indore, Goa, Mohali/Jamshedpur, Delhi, Guwahati, Kochi and Faridabad would be the ODI centres for the England tour. 

The committee also confirmed that Ahmedabad would host the third India-Sri Lanka Test from December 18-22 if Kanpur was unable to do so. 

He also said in case Ahmedabad got the chance to host the Test against Sri Lanka, then the match it was scheduled to host against England in March would be held in Mohali. 

The BCCIs working committee meets here on Sunday to decide on the Kanpur issue and finalise the order of the Tests and ODIs against England. 

We received a letter today (Saturday) from Rajiv Shukla (Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association) saying that they were ready to host the match provided the state government released the stadium, Manohar said after the meeting. 

Earlier on Saturday, BCCI pitches committee member Daljeet Singh inspected the ground at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur. 

Daljeet Singh said he had been directed by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah to inspect the pitch conditions and send his assessment to the board immediately. He did not disclose his findings to the press, saying he was supposed to report the matter to the board.

 Slow turner surprises Sourav

Bulawayo: Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday played down his record for most matches as Team India captain, saying that the milestone probably did not mark the end of the road for his career. 

I dont know what exactly it feels. Its a good feeling to lead for such long term, he said, adding, but not like the one when I scored 10,000 runs or when my team wins a match. 

Sourav was surprised by the slow pace and low bounce of the pitch, which provided turn when Anil Kumble came on in the 18th over. 

I thought the pitch would assist the seamers more and I think its going to get slower and turn more. There was a lot more turn on the first day than even an Indian pitch has, Sourav said. 

It was a good batting track and we must make use of it, Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu said. 

It was a decent day today and all the batsmen were very positive. (AGENCIES)

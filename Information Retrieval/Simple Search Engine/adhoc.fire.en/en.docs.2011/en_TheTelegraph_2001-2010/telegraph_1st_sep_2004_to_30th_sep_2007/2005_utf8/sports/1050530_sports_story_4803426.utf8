 Eswarah to vie for Oaks 

 Aidan Brien

 London: English 1,000 Guineas winner Virginia Waters, trained in Ireland by Aidan Brien, is to run in the Epsom Oaks on Friday.

 Connections have paid a ?20,000 ($36,560) late entry fee and the filly is now quoted in betting as 4-1 third favourite although she was beaten into eighth place in soft ground in last weeks Irish 1,000 Guineas.

 The powerful Godolphin stable has also made a late entry with the lightly raced Fen Shui (20-1) but racing manager Simon Crisford cautioned: The trip is an unknown. She shows plenty of speed and there are some stamina doubts.

 Eswarah, trained at Newmarket by Michael Jarvis and unbeaten in her only two races to date, is the 9-4 favourite. The Epsom Derby, the classic for colts, is on Saturday.

 Hayden fails fitness test

 Matthew Hayden 

Wellington: Injury has forced opening batsman Matthew Hayden out of the Australian team for the third one-day International against New Zealand in Auckland on Saturday. 

Hayden injured his shoulder while taking a catch in Tuesday?s second match in Christchurch and, although it is not serious, he has been asked to skip the game after he failed a fitness test in Auckland. Simon Katich will replace him at the top of the order. 

Paceman Glenn McGrath has also been rested, with Michael Kasprowicz returning to the line-up. 

Australia are 2-0 up in the five-match series. The final two games will be played in Wellington and Napier next week. Meanwhile, New Zealand included Michael Papps, Andre Adams and James Marshall in their 13-man squad. 

Allrounder Scott Styris was ruled out through injury and opening batsman Mathew Sinclair dropped. 

?We?re pretty determined, we know the importance of the match to keep the series alive,? New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming told reporters on Friday.

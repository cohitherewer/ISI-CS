Mumbai: Sujata Kar netted five goals as India trounced Guam 10-0 in the AFC womens football championship qualifiers in Hanoi on Sunday. 

Thangam Tababi Devi scored a brace, while Sradhanjali Ray, Magar Pinky Bombal Magar and Oinam Bem Bem Devi got the other goals for India who led 4-0 at the interval, according to information reaching here. 

India dominated both halves of the group B match and shut Guam out with excellent team work and co-ordination. 

Sradhanjali kicked off the demolition job in the 23rd minute. Then Sujata began her goal-spree, scoring her first in the 36th minute before slamming home her second two minutes later. 

Magar added the fourth goal three minutes from half time and, after the restart, Tababi Devi blasted in two goals in quick succession in the 50th and 53rd minutes to give India a 6-0 lead. 

Oinam Bem Bem also got on the scoresheet five minutes later and Sujata scored the last three goals between the 67th and 84th minutes to round off the tally for a comprehensive win. 

Coach Harinder Singh, however, said: Although we won, I am not satisfied. The next game against Chinese Taipei will be a big challenge.

 Khade, D Souza scoop 3 golds

Chennai: It was a successful day for Indian swimmers at the fourth Asian Age Group Aquatic Championships in Bangkok as Bangalores Aaroon DSouza and Mumbais Veerdhawal Khade claimed an individual gold medal each and helped the team win another with a new mark in the relay. 

India also won three silver medals (Shikha Tandon 2 and Jason Shiraz) to take its medals tally to five golds, 10 silver and 13 bronze, Virendra Nanavati, secretary, Swimming Federation of India, said. 

After Veerdhawal claimed gold in the 50m freestyle final with a time of 25.55s, Aaroon and Jason pulled off a one-two finish in the 800m freestyle final. 

The trio ? Veerdhawal, Aaroon and Jason ? kept up the momentum in the 4x200m relay for boys (open group) along with Poorna Chandran to set a new mark relegating the defending champion and recordholders Japan to second place. 

Jason played the anchor role to perfection recording a time of 8 min 21.37s eclipsing the old record of 8:26.37. 

Bangalores Shikha Tandon, who represented India at the Athens Olympics, bagged silver medals in the 50m freestyle and 100m backstroke finals, taking her individual tally to four silvers and a bronze. Veerdhawal and Aaroon have won a brace of individual golds besides one in the relay event. 

In a waterpolo placings match, India beat Indonesia 12-8.

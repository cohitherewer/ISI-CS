London: Champion Roger Federer made a winning return to Wimbledons lush green lawns on Monday, reaching the second round of the grasscourt Grand Slam with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win over Paul-Henri Mathieu. 

The Swiss world No. 1 opened his campaign for a third consecutive All England Club title as early morning stormclouds cleared to leave Centre Court bathed in sunshine. 

Federer, who clattered 18 aces past his French opponent, was joined in the second round by the man he considers a main rival for his crown, 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt. 

The Australian baseliner wasted no time sweeping aside Belgiums Christophe Rochus 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 in 92 minutes. 

French Open runner-up Mariano Puerta hardly had time to knock the clay from his shoes before skidding out of Wimbledon on the very first day. The Argentine, seeded 16th at the All England Club on the strength of his Roland Garros heroics earlier this month, was never in with a shout against German Lars Burgsmueller, losing 1-6, 1-6, 4-6. 

For Puerta, Mondays match was his first departure from clay since a hardcourt tournament the first week in January. Since then he had played 42 straight claycourt matches. In four visits to south-west London, the Argentine is yet to win a match. 

Russias Marat Safin wasted little time beating Thai Paradorn Srichaphan 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the second round. The fifth seed and Australian Open champion looked unusually comfortable on a surface he admits is not his favourite against an opponent known for his serve-volley game on grass. 

Britains Greg Rusedski powered his way into the second round with a workmanlike 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory over Spaniard Alberto Martin. 

South Korean Hyung-Taik Lee beat Swede Thomas Enqvist 6-3, 6-7(4-7), 7-5, 6-4. 

While the leading men advanced with little fuss, womens ninth seed Anastasia Myskina survived a scare before finally scrambling over the first hurdle. 

Russias first woman Grand Slam winner when she triumphed at the French Open last year, Myskina was pressed all the way before beating Czech qualifier Katerina Bohmova 5-7, 7-6, 6-4. Myskina trailed 1-4 in the second set and 0-3 in the third before winning both to avert a second successive first-round loss at a Grand Slam tournament. 

Last month she became the first defending champion to lose in the opening round at Roland Garros. Lindsay Davenport made the most of her unexpected return to Wimbledon with a 6-0, 6-2 drubbing of Russian Alina Jidkova. 

Twelve months ago, the 1999 champion walked out of the All England Club convinced she had played on the Centre Court for the last time. On Monday, the American was back on the biggest stage in grasscourt tennis as the world No. 1 and only allowed a frustrated Jidkova to pick up a few stray points before wrapping up the victory. 

Third seed Amelie Mauresmo strode through to the second round with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Hungarian Melinda Czink.

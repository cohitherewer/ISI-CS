The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?ve learnt from mistakes: Parthiv

 - ?I?m not worried about others? performances? 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

 Parthiv is stressing on the importance of handling pressure 

Ahmedabad: Till Mahendra Singh Dhoni arrived on the scene, everybody was convinced Parthiv Patel would soon make a comeback and serve India for long. The Jharkhand wicketkeeper may not have played a Test yet, but given his one-day performance, it?s only a matter of time before he is tested in the longer version of the game. 

Dinesh Karthik has kept wickets in the last eight Tests, since Parthiv was dropped after the Nagpur game against Australia, but he surely doesn?t appear to be a certainty in the long term. Parthiv has seized on this opportunity to finetune his skills and he is ready for the tougher battles ahead. 

?I?ve had a good domestic season and am more confident now. I?ve worked on my wicketkeeping and hope to put up an improved performance. I?ve learnt from my mistakes,? Parthiv told The Telegraph. 

The 19-year-old local boy was not to be seen during Team India?s nets at the Gujarat Stadium, Motera, on Monday. ?There?s too much commotion... I don?t want to go there,? he said with a childish grin. 

The youngest-ever to keep in Tests and ODIs, Parthiv has so far featured in 19 Tests (46 victims) and 14 ODIs (15 victims). 

Parthiv informed that he had been working hard with special advice from selection committee chairman Kiran More and Australian Ian Healy. ?I?ve worked on my fitness. More Sir has given me valuable tips on keeping. I?ve also learnt to concentrate harder.? 

?I know the importance of handling pressure... the means to stay relaxed and enjoy the game. May be I was just going through a phase when things were not falling into place. 

?Maybe I was worried about a few things and that had affected my concentration. I realise nothing matters more than my keeping,? Parthiv explained. 

Has Dhoni?s 148 in Visakhapatnam made him feel insecure? ?There?s no doubt Dhoni?s has been a great innings. But I?m not worried about others? performances. I have the confidence to play at this level and know that I can bounce back anytime,? Parthiv said. 

Parthiv?s ability to hold fort in any position has been his biggest asset. He helped save the Trent Bridge Test on debut in 2002 and did not disappoint when asked to open in the series-deciding Rawalpindi Test last April. 

With Karthik, too, performing well with the bat, does he think his chances of a comeback are more difficult? ?Nobody is a certainty in the side,? he promptly interrupted and added: ?I know my capabilities... I?m mentally too strong to get affected by anything.? 

Does he think he?s got a raw deal from the selection committee? ?It?s part and parcel of the game. You?ve got to take it in your stride. What matters most is performance,? maintained Parthiv. 

That?s the right attitude for a youngster looking to make a fresh beginning.

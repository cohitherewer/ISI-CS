Madrid: Spain hailed a new hero on Monday after Fernando Alonso became the countrys first Formula One champion, and the worlds youngest at just 24 years of age. 

Champion, blared the front pages of the normally soccer-obsessed sports dailies, while one led with Alonso, the youngest king of Formula One. 

Alonso reportedly received over 300 telephone calls in the hour after his third-placed finish in Sundays Brazilian Grand Prix ? one of them with congratulations from the King of Spain, Juan Carlos. 

Juan Carlos expressed his great happiness and has proffered his warmest congratulations (to Alonso) in his name, that of the queen and the royal household and all Spaniards as this is a great day for the Spanish people, a royal household statement read on Sunday. 

Wild celebrations took place in his hometown of Oviedo in Asturias, continuing until the early hours of the morning, but his adoring fans will have to wait before they get a chance to celebrate with Alonso himself. 

Alonso, an intensely private character who lives in Oxford, England, has not yet agreed to any plans for a victory parade. (AGENCIES)

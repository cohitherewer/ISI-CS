Calcutta: It was a kind of running-with-the-hare-and-hunting-with-the-hounds experience a few thousand spectators sure returned with, after Mohun Bagan got off to a winning start in the Premier Division of the Calcutta Football League against Eastern Railway at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. 

Mehtab Hussain duly justified his ascension to the captains role, hitting the matchwinner six minutes from the break. But what went before and after that crucial moment was sometimes hazy. 

The match threw up quite a bit of interest about how Amal Duttas oft-repeated Mexican style of the game would come to influence Mehtab amp; Co.s presence on the ground. No doubt, this Mohun Bagan look fitter in outshining the opponents, sharper in controlling the proceedings and smarter in organising the moves through the flanks ? in all, a good departure from the sloth, languishing team that was struggling to survive the National Football League a few months back. 

But its not the kind of five-or-six players coming from the deep to raid the rival area ? Mexican way of attacking, as Dutta would love to call it. Rather a few subtle variations in the midfield composition. Take this for example ? while Dharamjit Singh and Manitombi Singh were operating down the flanks, the likes of Basudeb Mondal and Mehtab were joined by Meherajuddin Wadao and Dulal Biswas from the backline to form sort of a rectangle, to substantiate the attack. 

 This way, even if the ball was cleared from the rival box, Mohun Bagan quickly got back into its possession. 

But unlike a small-team mentality, Eastern Railway always attacked whenever there was an opportunity. Bapan Beras 25-yard free-kick forced Subrata Pal to come up with a superb save while Karim Ali cashed in on a late reaction from the Bagan defenders but failed to control the ball in the nick of time, allowing Eduardo Coelho to thwart the danger. 

All this happened before Mehtab switched the attention in the 39th minute. But there was an element of doubt around the goal. 

Dipendu Biswas, who huffed and puffed a lot to prove the doubters wrong, took a shot from the edge of the box, forcing Surabuddin Chowdhury to clear it for a corner. Dharmajits resultant flag-kick found Mehrajuddin meeting the ball with a bicycle kick. Surabuddin, obstructed by Dipendu on the goalline, partially fisted it out and a lurking Mehtab shot home from close. 

After the breather, Mohun Bagan, however, showed more focus on going through the motions, and hardly any intention to charge forward. They suddenly looked like a team, reminiscent of last years, intent on securing the lead. That time, they conceded a late equaliser on so many occasions, thereby ruining their own chances. On Wednesday, it was not to happen. Winning is always a good dish to dine with and who cares whether it was coming through a new system or old.

Colombo: Sri Lankas new coach, former Australian international Tom Moody, has set his sights on winning the next World Cup and a top three ranking in Test cricket. 

Our main focus is the World Cup in 2007 and the journey we are starting now is geared towards a successful campaign in the West Indies, Moody, who will give up his role as director of coaching at Worcestershire in England, told reporters. 

Fortunately, we have plenty of time up our sleeve to come up with strategies that can help us win that tournament. 

Sri Lanka won the World Cup in 1996 and are currently second in the International Cricket Councils one-day rankings. They are fifth in Test rankings. 

The 39-year-old former allrounder and one-day specialist was named as the islands coach on Wednesday, in an expanded role that includes a review of the coaching structure in Sri Lanka. 

Moody returned to England on Thursday but will be back in Sri Lanka in mid-June to prepare for the West Indies two-Test tour of the island in July. 

We will sit down with the senior core of the players when I return to review how the game is being played now and the likely conditions to formulate our strategies, Moody added. 

In Tests, our goal is to book a consistent place in the top three and to do that, we need to maintain the sides home form and improve performances overseas. 

Moody was appointed by the cricket board ? which is in turn being managed by a government-appointed interim committee after the previous board was suspended following a power struggle that saw the government dissolve the governing body for the third time since 1999. 

Asked whether he had any qualms about the cricket board crisis, Moody said: I am totally confident in Sri Lanka Cricket. 

Moody has been given the freedom to build his coaching team for the national side. 

He does not plan specialist batting and bowling coaches but is looking to expand the staff, including a full-time assistant coach for the first time in Sri Lanka. 

It may be worthwhile looking at an assistant coach and that is something we will address in addition to a physiotherapist and fitness trainer, he said. 

We will also be introducing new technologies into the coaching process but it is also important to stick to the basics and I will not cloud the players with technology. 

Moody was vague on whether he would seek a bigger say in team selection. Sri Lankas coaches have not been given an official say in selection in the past, and this was a source of friction. 

It is important that the captain and coach have a close relationship with the selectors as it is important that we get the best eleven out in the park, said the former international, who played eight Tests and 76 one-dayers. 

Moody, who missed out on the job of Team India coach to fellow international Greg Chappell, replaces another Australian, John Dyson, who finished a 20-month contract in April.

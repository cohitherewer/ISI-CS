 Pettersson joins Lowery at top

Toronto: Swedens Carl Pettersson fired a four-under-par 67 to join American Steve Lowery at the top of the leaderboard after the third round of the Chrysler Championship in Tampa Bay, Florida on Saturday. 

Pettersson, who began the day three shots off the pace, muscled his way into a share of the lead with a tidy outward nine at the Westin Innisbrook Resorts Copperhead course which included four birdies and one bogey. 

The 28-year-old Pettersson moved within sight of his first PGA Tour title, carding another birdie on the 10th before closing with eight consecutive pars to finish nine-under on 204. 

Lowery, 45, began the day with a two-shot lead but was unable to gain any momentum through a rollercoaster one-under 70 which mixed four birdies with three bogeys. Another Swede, Daniel Chopra (68), was in a tie for third place with Americans Tom Pernice Jr (70) and Davis Love III (70) on 207. 

World No. 4 Retief Goosen and Britains Justin Rose slumped to identical five-over 76s for matching totals of 214, one over. 

South African Goosen, the 2003 Chrysler champion, registered five bogeys before claiming his first birdie of the day on the par-three 17th. But he then bogeyed the 18th. 

Rose, another player chasing his maiden PGA Tour win, had five bogeys and two birdies before ending his round with a double-bogey six. (Reuters)

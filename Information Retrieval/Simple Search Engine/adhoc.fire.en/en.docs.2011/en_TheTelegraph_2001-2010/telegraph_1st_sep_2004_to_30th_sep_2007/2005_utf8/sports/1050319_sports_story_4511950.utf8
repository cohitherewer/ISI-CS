The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Extended sight

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

 Coaches Bob Woolmer and John Wright met up before the teams took to the field on the third day of the second Test at the Eden on Friday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 

Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar needed a better 

sight of the ball. On his request the sight screen at the pavilion end was extended 

by a couple of feet to the right. Sachin was out in the middle Rahul Dravid and 

the maestro had his concentration disturbed by people moving in the stands. He 

let his wish be known to the CAB and the needful was done.

Children in fray 

 Children from Howrah?s Utsav Deaf and Dumb School 

decided to put in their own effort in this series of cross-border bonhomie. They 

gathered at the team hotel after the day?s match and put vermilion on the foreheads 

of Sachin Tendulkar and Inzamam-ul-Haq. 

The hotel initially refused permission for the powdered 

colour but later this was arranged through the intervention of the principal of 

the school. Sachin and Inzamam spent some time with the children and also had 

few snaps taken. 

Good wishes 

More good wishes came the cricketers? way Friday when 

an all-party delegation from the state Legislative Assembly went to the dressing 

rooms of the of both India and Pakistan and conveyed their good wishes to the 

players after the day?s proceedings. 

Bucknor feted 

 Umpire Steve Bucknor was felicitated by the Umpires 

of Cricket Association of Bengal (UCAB) after the third day?s play. He was presented 

with a memento and bouquet at his and the team?s hotel for his having stood in 

100 Tests. 

Whispers of this ?not being the perfect occasion?, 

however, failed to gain enough currency this time. 

Shades of green 

Indian fans on their way to the Eden now have the 

option of having their painted in the colours of the Pakistani flag, if they so 

wish. 

Some vendors have found this unique way of adding to the general feeling of good neighbourliness. The price is small, at Rs 20. 

Of course, you have the option of having the Indian tricolours on your cheeks as well. For a price.

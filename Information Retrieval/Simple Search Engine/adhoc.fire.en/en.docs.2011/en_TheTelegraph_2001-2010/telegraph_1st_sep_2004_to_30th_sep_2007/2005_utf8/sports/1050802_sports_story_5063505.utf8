 Myskina confirms for Calcutta meet

A STAFF REPORTER

 Anastasia Myskina is really excited over her India trip 

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi had vowed to bring at least one top-10 player and another from the top-20 to Calcutta for the $ 170,000 Sunfeast Open. Well, the managing director of Globosport, which is organising the WTA Tour tier III event jointly with the state government, has kept one-half of his promise. He has managed to rope in a big name for the meet ? Anastasia Myskina. 

One of the pioneers of the Russian revolution which has been sweeping through womens tennis in the past couple of years, Myskina won the 2004 French Open, thus becoming the first lady from her country to clinch a Grand Slam. She also has eight other WTA Tour titles in her kitty and a career prize-money of over $ 4.5 million. 

She had risen to world No. 2 for a brief period but maintained her position in the top-10 for a long period. It was only on Monday that she dropped to No. 12 in the latest WTA rankings list. 

A quarter finalist at this years Wimbledon, Myskina played a big hand in guiding Russia past the US in the Fed Cup semi-final last month. 

Russia will seek to defend their Fed Cup title when they clash with France next month. The Fed Cup final, in fact, gets over a day before the WTA meet begins (September 19) at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

According to a press release, Myskina was looking forward to her India visit. This will be my first visit to India and I am really excited to be part of this event. Competing at the Sunfeast Open will provide me a chance to improve my rankings and stay close to the top of the Champions Race, said Myskina. 

While Myskina will be the main draw, Sania Mirza wont be far behind in the popularity stakes. Efforts are on to convince Myskina to pair up with Sania in doubles.

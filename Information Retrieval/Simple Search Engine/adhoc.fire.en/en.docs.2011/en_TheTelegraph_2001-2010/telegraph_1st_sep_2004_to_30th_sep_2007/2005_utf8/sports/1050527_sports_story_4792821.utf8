The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav runs into problem

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, who signed up with Glamorgan on Tuesday, has been saddled with a work permit-related problem. 

Sourav himself wasnt available for a comment when The Telegraph contacted his place of residence in London, late on Thursday, but wife Dona confirmed that all was not well. 

Im not absolutely sure, but Sourav may have to go to Brussels (where the European Union is headquartered) for getting the needful done, she remarked. 

Owing to this work permit-related development, Sourav and his family have deferred their departure for Cardiff.

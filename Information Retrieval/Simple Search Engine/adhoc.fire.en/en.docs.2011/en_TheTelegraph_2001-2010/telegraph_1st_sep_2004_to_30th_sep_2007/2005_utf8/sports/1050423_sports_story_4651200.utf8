 Ponting laughs off bat controversy

 Ponting isn?t sure how it all started 

Sydney: Australian captain Ricky Ponting said Friday he didn?t know what all the fuss was about over his cricket bat which the game?s lawmakers believe is illegal. 

The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) is concerned that Ponting?s bat has been strengthened by a thin strip of carbon graphite which it feels gives the Australia skipper an unfair power advantage. 

The concern over the bat?s legitimacy comes just months before the Ashes Series in England. 

Ponting said the sticker on the back of the bat had been changed to appeal to young cricket fans and provide protection against wear and tear. ?I?ve been using that Kahuna bat for the last five or six years, it?s just the sticker that?s changed this year, that?s the difference,? he told Channel Ten here. 

?I?ve just had a real laugh at it so far, I?ve not really thought too much about it. 

?I?m not sure where it?s all started out from, whether it?s the ICC or the MCC or whatever or whether it?s something the players have drummed up over there. 

?I?m not really sure and I don?t really care to tell you the truth.? 

The MCC has expressed its concerns to the ICC, which will debate the matter as part of an overall review of bats at a meeting in Dubai next month. 

An ICC spokesman Thursday confirmed that Ponting?s bat was up for review. 

?At present there is a MCC process ongoing on this matter and, pending the completion of this process, the player is permitted to use the bat in question,? the spokesman said. 

Ponting hit a double-century against Pakistan with the bat in Sydney last January, a century in the tsunami match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and made 293 runs at 97.66 in three Tests in the recent series in New Zealand. 

The laws of the game state that the blade of the bat may be covered with material for ?strengthening, protection or repair? as long as the material doesn?t damage the ball.

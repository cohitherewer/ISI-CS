 Van Persie to stay in custody

Amsterdam: A Rotterdam court decided on Thursday to keep Arsenals Dutch forward Robin van Persie in custody for another 14 days on suspicion of rape, a public prosecutor said. 

The 21-year-old Van Persie was arrested in Rotterdam on Monday following an alleged incident over the weekend. 

The public prosecutors office has asked for the custody to be prolonged in the interest of the investigation and because of the seriousness of the charges, the Rotterdam prosecutors office said in a statement. 

It added that the court had put Van Persie under restrictions, which meant no further statements could be made. The hearing was behind closed doors. Van Persies lawyer Abraham Moszkowicz had said he was confident his client would be released. (Reuters)

 50m butterfly mark by Schoeman

Montreal: Michael Phelps rebounded from a rare failure to capture his first gold medal at the world championships on Sunday after his bid to win a record eight titles had been sunk in his very first event. 

The American struck gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay after he flopped out of the individual 400m freestyle, won by Australian Grant Hackett, who created his own legacy by becoming the first swimmer to win gold medals at four world championships. 

Australia won a second title on Sunday with an expected victory in the womens sprint relay while French teenager Laure Manaudou overcame a bout of nerves to win the womens 400m freestyle and add the world title to the Olympic crown she captured at Athens last year. 

Roland Schoeman, part of the South African team that spectacularly ruined Phelps campaign for eight golds in Athens, set a world record in the semi-finals of the mens 50m butterfly on Sunday, stopping the clock at 23.01 seconds to wipe 0.29 off the previous record established by American Ian Crocker in Austin last year. 

Phelps had been one of the favourites in the 400m but faded so badly at the end of his morning heat that he finished 18th overall and had to watch the final from the stands. 

With Ian Thorpe taking the year off, there was no one left to mount a serious challenge to Hackett and the undisputed king of long distance swimming obligingly cruised to his first 400m world title after finishing runner-up to Thorpe at the previous three world championships. Russias Yuri Prilukov was second while Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia came home third. 

It was a shame that Ian and Michael werent there in the final but I really wasnt thinking about that too much, Hackett said. 

Phelps did not have long to dwell on his disappointment after he was ordered to lead-off the US relay and he responded with an opening split of 49.17 that gave his team a handy lead which they never relinquished, finishing ahead of Canada and Australia. 

Hacketts victory provided Australia with the perfect start to the eight-day championships and they finished the opening night on top of the medal standings with a rousing victory in the womens relay. 

The quartet of Jodie Henry, Alice Mills, Shayne Reese and Libby Lenton showed their rivals a clean pair of heels as they sped to gold to add the world title to their Olympic success last year. 

Germany finished second while the United States came third after Natalie Coughlin had given them the lead at the first changeover. 

Manaudou also completed the Olympic-world double but unlike her confident victory in Athens, she had to fight all the way to win the womens 400m freestyle final. (Reuters)

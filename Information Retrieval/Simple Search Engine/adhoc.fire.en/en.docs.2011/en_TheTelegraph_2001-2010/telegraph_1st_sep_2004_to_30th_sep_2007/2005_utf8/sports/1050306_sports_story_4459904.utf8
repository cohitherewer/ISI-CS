The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Prakash was terrific, says Leander

A CORRESPONDENT

 Vijay Amritraj congratulates Prakash after the latter?s win over Wang Yu Jr on Saturday 

New Delhi: He can put away volley winners with magical wrists coming into play and he can also be just as gentle when having to serve volleys of the verbal kind. 

These qualities were showcased on Saturday when Leander Paes was on court and then sat back to savour the taste of Davis Cup victory over China. 

?I am very happy that we have a 3-0 lead after two days. It has been a long time since we were in this position,? Paes said after pairing up with Mahesh Bhupathi to clinch the third rubber with a four-set victory over bristling left-hander Wang Yu Jr and Zhu Beng-Qiang. 

?I believe Harsh [Mankad] and Prakash [Amritraj] played superbly to put us 2-0 ahead. It is not easy sleeping over an unfinished match and Prakash was terrific today.? 

The Indian captain was gently critical of the grasscourt at the R.K. Khanna Stadium. ?The court was scratchy and uneven. We were not able to dominate as we would have liked. In fact, you would have noticed that there were not too many service breaks until the fourth set,? he said. 

Paes was pertinent, however, in pointing out that the grasscourt was rarely used. ?The court hasn?t had much play in a while and it has not been well looked after. We should pay attention to the court, it should be looked after well,? he said. 

?Mahesh?s return of serve is one of the best and I can tell you that he returns a lot better than he did today.? 

The skipper said that while his teammates do not really feature in too many grasscourt tournaments on the Tour, grass was a unique surface for India?s Cup squad. 

?Prakash has the game tailormade for grass. With his reach, he covers the net so well. Mahesh is really good on grass while I love playing on grass. Harsh is quick and can play well on any surface. He just needs to get his serve going (like he did yesterday). 

?I will also say that while we may have to look at playing home ties on hardcourt, we are not in a hurry to do that. We can wait to see who we play before we decide which surface to schedule the tie on,? he said. 

India have not played Uzbekistan in Davis Cup and travelled to Jakarta in May 1992, the last time they took on Indonesia. Paes also indicated he was not inclined to make any changes for Sunday?s reverse singles. The Chinese were not sure if they would field Wang in the final clash against Mankad. 

The reverse singles matches will have little more than mere academic interest.

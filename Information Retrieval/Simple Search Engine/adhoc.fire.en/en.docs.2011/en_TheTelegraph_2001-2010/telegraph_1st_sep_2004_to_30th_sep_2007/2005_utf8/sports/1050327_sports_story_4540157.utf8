Bangalore: Virender Sehwag struck his second 200-plus score but twin strikes by Danish Kaneria in the last session left Pakistan smelling blood on the third day of the third and final Test against India Saturday. 

Despite Sehwag?s belligerent 201, the huge first innings target seemed to weigh heavily on the Indians who were 379 for six at close, having managed to go past the follow-on mark but still 191 runs in arrears. 

VVS Laxman was finally among runs and picked the gaps in his trademark style to remain unbeaten on 51, with Irfan Pathan yet to open his account at stumps. 

Kaneria (3/97) succeeded due to his guile in combination with the batsmen?s foolhardiness while Mohammed Sami (2/80) was a typical example of fast bowler ploughing his way on an unforgiving pitch. There were a couple of individual milestones for the Indians fans to cherish. 

Sachin Tendulkar surpassed Brian Lara (10,094) in the all time batting aggregate list while Virender Sehwag crossed the 3,000-run mark when he reached 160. 

Sachin moved past Lara in the all time batting charts when he reached 18. But he fell short of the highest Indian aggregate of Sunil Gavaskar?s 10,122 by four runs as he miscued a drive for a simple catch at point and was dismissed for 41. 

Dravid (22) was trapped leg before wicket by Kaneria with the score at 172. Sehwag and Dravid put on 74 runs for the second wicket before Kaneria had the Indian vice-captain. 

The host lost the wicket of opener Gautam Gambhir mid-way through the pre-lunch session. 

The Delhi batsman had to slow down after the fall of Sachin but accelerated the pace of scoring beautifully as he approached his 200. 

A mistimed heave hung up in the air before it fell in no man?s land for his double ton. 

In the same over, he failed to check his drive and was caught and bowled by the leg spinner. His 201 came from 262 balls with 28 fours and two sixes in five hours and 34 minutes. (PTI)

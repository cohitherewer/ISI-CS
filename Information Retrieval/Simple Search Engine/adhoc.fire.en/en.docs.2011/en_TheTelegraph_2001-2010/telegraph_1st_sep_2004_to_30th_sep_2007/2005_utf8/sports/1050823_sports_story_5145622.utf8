 Kallis named deputy for a year

Durban: Allrounder Jacques Kallis has been appointed as vice-captain of the South African team for the next one year. 

Jacques Kallis will serve in this capacity for a year and it will then be up to him to decide whether he wants to continue, United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) CEO Gerald Majola said on Monday. 

He also gave details of the full management team to be in charge until the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Former Test fast bowler Vincent van der Bijl has been appointed professional cricket general manager. 

Mustapha Khan, a former cricketer of Indian origin from Kwazulu-Natal would be included in the national selection panel, Majola said. He will replace Enver Mall, who has taken over as CEO of Kwazulu-Natal cricket. 

The panel also includes Haroon Lorgat (chairman), Joubert Strydom, coach Mickey Arthur and captain Graeme Smith.

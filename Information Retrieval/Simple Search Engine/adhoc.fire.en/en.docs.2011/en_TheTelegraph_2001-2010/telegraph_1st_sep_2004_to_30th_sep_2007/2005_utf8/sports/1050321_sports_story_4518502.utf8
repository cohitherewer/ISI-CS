The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Bucknor just made a mistake?

 - Sachin gives thumbs-up to Team India 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Joy, disappointment? Sachin Tendulkar 

probably experienced every emotion during the second Test, which ended in a huge 

win for Team India on Sunday. 

At the end of it all, he was relaxed like perh-aps never before this season. 

?We?ve had a thrilling victory? Thumbs-up to this 

team,? Sachin, the senior-most international anywhere, told The Telegraph 

some two hours after Harbhajan Singh evicted Danish Kaneria to seal the win. 

Significantly, speaking in the dressing room after a shower and liberal use of cologne, he insisted the Steve Bucknor epis-ode was ?over and done with.? 

Sachin stayed back (keeping a lounging Sourav Ganguly company) as he preferred heading straight for the airport to board the flight for Bangalore. The captain, incidentally, leaves on Monday evening. 

Bucknor, it may be recalled, erred in giving Sachin 

out caught behind off Abdul Razzaq late on the third day. He was then on 52 and 

looked good for the record 35th hundred. 

?My disappointment was temporary? But, yes, I was 

very upset as such decisions can change the course of a match. Thankfully, it 

didn?t affect us,? Sachin observed. 

Sportingly, he added Bucknor ?just made a mistake.? 

Incidentally, Sachin didn?t call up Narain Karthikeyan on the eve of the Malaysian Grand Prix (in Sepang), where India?s first and only Formula One driver finished 11th. 

?I did think of wishing him before today?s race, but later thought it could disturb his concentration? I may talk to him later,? he informed. 

Sachin, of course, gave Karthikeyan tips on mental 

toughness before the 2005 season got underway in Melbourne, a fortnight back.

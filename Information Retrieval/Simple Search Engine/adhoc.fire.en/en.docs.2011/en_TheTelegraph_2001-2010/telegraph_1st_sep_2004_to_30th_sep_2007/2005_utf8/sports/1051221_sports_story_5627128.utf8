 Inzy, Shoaib to take a break

Rawalpindi: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq and pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar will skip the fifth and final one-day International against England on Wednesday. 

Inzamam said another pacer, Mohammad Sami, would also be rested to give some exposure to the younger players in the squad. 

No one is injured but we have decided that having won the series, it is a good opportunity to try out the younger players. 

Specially with the home series against India also coming up next month, he said. 

England lost the one-day series to Pakistan on Monday after losing the fourth match by 13 runs to give the home side a 3-1 lead.

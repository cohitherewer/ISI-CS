The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Salgaocar beat Fransa

Margao: Defender Remus Gomes? late goal guided former champion Salgaocar to a 2-1 win over Fransa Pax in a tie marred by poor refereeing in the ninth National Football Leauge for the ONGC Cup, at the Nehru Stadium here Tuesday. 

Fransa got an early jolt when the referee gave a penalty to Salgaocar, which Felix easily converted. Fransa restored parity in the 69th minute through Hardeep Saini from what looked to be a clearly off-side position. Salgaocar went all out and scored the winner two minutes before the end. 

Pullout threat

 Waiting for a Ferrari renaissance

 - CANADIAN Grand Prix 

 Fernando Alonso fancies his chances 

London: For most of his Formula One career, Michael Schumacher has arrived in Canada as a racing certainty. 

Not this time. The Ferrari world champion has not won a race since last October, has reaped a mere 16 points from seven GPs so far this season and his hopes of an eighth crown have all but disappeared. 

Sundays race could herald the long-awaited Ferrari renaissance (and where better than at a track named after one of the best-loved Ferrari drivers?) but the 36-year-old German is making no predictions. 

Even though Schumacher has won for the last three years at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, and a record seven times since his first appearance in Montreal in 1992 with Benetton, Ferraris dominance has ebbed away. 

Renault, McLaren, Toyota and Williams have been stronger so far and all have just as much if not more reason to hope for victory on Sunday. 

Renaults young Spaniard Fernando Alonso, with four victories under his belt and a 32-point lead in the championship over McLarens Kimi Raikkonen and Toyotas Jarno Trulli, certainly fancies his chances. 

Every year I have been there with Renault, we have been quick in Montreal, said the 23-year-old. With the R23 (in 2003) I set the fastest lap and with the R24 we were in a position to win. 

So with this years car, there is no reason not to expect a podium or perhaps the victory, as long as we have no problems during the weekend. 

Raikkonen, thwarted at the last race at the Nuerburgring when he flat-spotted a tyre and suffered a catastrophic suspension failure on the last lap while leading, needs to claw back some points and regain his momentum. Had it not been for that failure, he would be arriving in Canada with three straight wins under his belt and Alonso no more than 20 points clear. 

The Finns European Grand Prix retirement means that he has the disadvantage of running early in qualifying on a little-used circuit that takes time to clean up even if it has been resurfaced since last year. 

So too will Toyotas Ralf Schumacher, overshadowed by Italian Trulli so far this year, who won in Canada in 2001 with Williams but suffered his teams first retirement of the year at the Nuerburgring.

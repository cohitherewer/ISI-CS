The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ziauddin century boosts Kalighat

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Powered by brilliant knocks by Mohammed Ziauddin and Safi Ahmed, Kalighat Club coasted to a competitive 301 in 84.5 overs against Eastern Railway Sports Association (ERSA) at the end of the first day of the CAB two-day league championship play-off final at the Eden on Saturday. 

Opting to bat, Kalighat, started the proceedings well with opener Ziauddin, who seemed to be at his best during his 118-run innings under the scorching sun. On a slow batting track, Ziauddin was ably assisted by senior teammate Safi, who fell at the score of 71. 

At one point, it seemed that Kalighat would reach 350 but that wasnt possible as they lost wickets, mainly after tea, at regular intervals. But thanks to Avik Chowdhury and Manoj Tewari who made valuable contributions during the end to help the team crossing the 300-run mark. 

Avik scored 37 while Manoj Tewari, who has already captained the India under-19 side earlier this season, made a quickfire 34 off 35 balls. Chiranjib Guha was pick of the bowlers with a five-wicket haul while Kanchan Maity claimed three wickets. 

At lunch, the batting side was 92 for one in 36 overs while in the next session they added 113 runs to reach 205 for three. I was really expecting a score of 350-plus, but the lower order collapsed and we had to be content with 301, Kalighat coach Prasanta Ghosh said. 

According to Ghosh, if the bowlers can do their job, it wont be hard to clinch the tie. 

BRIEF SCORES 

 Kalighat 301 in 84.5 ovs (Mohammedan Ziauddin 118, Safi Ahmed 71, Avik Chowdhury 37, Manoj Tewari 34; Chiranjib Guha 5/112, Kanchan Maity 3/64) vs ERSA. Match to continue.

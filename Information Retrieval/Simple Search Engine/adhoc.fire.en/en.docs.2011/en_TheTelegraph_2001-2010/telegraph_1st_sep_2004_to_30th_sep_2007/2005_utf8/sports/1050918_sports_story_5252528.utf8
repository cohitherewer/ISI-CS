The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 France, Russia level 1-1

Paris: Amelie Mauresmo held her nerve to beat Anastasia Myskina 6-4, 6-2 on Saturday, levelling the Fed Cup final with Russia at 1-1 after the opening singles. 

The Frenchwoman, who has a reputation for cracking under pressure at Roland Garros, never advancing beyond the quarter finals of the French Open, proved her doubters wrong, returning superbly en route to a comfortable victory. 

Elena Dementieva had earlier taken revenge over Mary Pierce, beating her 7-6, 2-6, 6-1 to hand Russia a 1-0 lead. 

Dementieva had earlier accused Pierce of using unfair tactics after losing to the 30-year old in the semi-finals of the US Open last week. 

The Russian had alleged that Pierce faked an injury when she took back-to-back timeouts lasting 12 minutes to receive treatment after losing the first set. 

Mauresmo and Myskina had traded breaks in the opening set when the Frenchwoman captured the Russians serve again in the eighth game to serve for the set. 

The former world No. one worried her fans when she was broken in that game, but she made amends. (Reuters)

 The Indian team produced a sparkling display against Uzbekistan

The name of this column adequately describes the route to Indias Davis Cup sweep over Uzbekistan in the Asia-Oceania zone group I second-round tie in Jaipur. The two positives to emerge for Indian tennis were: Leander has matured into a bold and courageous captain, and that both Harsh Mankad and Prakash Amritraj have improved considerably since their outing against China. In fact, the sparkling display of Leander, Prakash and Harsh lit up the Indian tennis scene. 

For Prakash and Harsh, the litmus test of climbing up further in the ATP rankings is still a daunting task, and can only be achieved with more competitive exposure and hard work. Some commentators, enthused by the results, feel it could be ?the dawn of a new era? for Indian tennis but I would like to contain my jubilation and say it is just one small step in the right direction. 

The two giant Uzbeks, both six-four in height and in their teens, could not handle the playing conditions. Their baseline games are built on accurate and consistently pounding big groundshots, which require a true surface and a good bounce. Due to the condition of the court, they were forced to abandon the baseline and play a net-attacking game. 

The pockmarked grasscourt was speckled with green grass, brown burnt grass and bald patches: a sort of three-in-one which threw up different bounces and made it impossible to get into a rhythm. Without rhythm and timing, baseliners in particular get totally lost and frustrated. The unseasonal rain brought about a lower bounce and the fact that the Uzbeks did not have grasscourt shoes, which give you a firmer foothold, added to their woes. After a contested tie-breaking first set in the opening match, the resolve and grit of the Uzbeks faded away and the rest of the tie was a virtual walkover. Had the Uzbeks been playing on home courts, the tie would certainly have gone down to the wire. 

In the past, playing Cup ties at home on grasscourts has paid rich dividends for India. We beat several highly-ranked teams like Japan, Britain, South Korea, Switzerland and Croatia. Grasscourt tennis is almost extinct and the serve and volley at all levels of the game has given way to the consistency and accuracy of whirling top-spin shots off both flanks. The serve and volley game has been virtually abandoned in the higher echelons of ATP rankings, but has proved to be a very potent weapon in Indias Davis Cup matches on tricky grasscourts. 

Leanders opening match was like a dream run. A slight stutter, when he lost his serve at 5-3, was the only glitch in a spotless performance. He is in very good shape and in great touch, and looks likely to continue his winning streak in doubles on the Tour. Bhupathi, quiet and not as articulate as Paes, was in good touch. His deadly double-handed backhand did all the talking as the Indians won the doubles convincingly. 

Prakash was full of fire, and played a perfect grasscourt game. He went for winners on his groundshots and rushed to the net at the earliest opportunity. It was a stirring display. In between points, Prakash moves almost at a run adding to the hustle factor which unsettled the Uzbeks. There were practically no baseline rallies and Prakashs groundshots were not fully tested due to the court conditions. For the ATP circuit, he will have to develop a higher level of consistency on his groundshots and the patience to trade five to six groundshots on most points. 

Harsh had the toughest task. It is difficult to play on the third day of a dead tie. Especially if your opponent has already had a match under his belt. In this case he played against Murad Inoyatov who had the advantage of an outing on the second day. In spite of this, with nothing at stake, Harsh conjured up the enthusiasm for a sparkling display. Crisp volleys and consistent groundshots gave his game a sharp, impressive edge. 

Harsh is short in stature and needs to add more power to his game. This can be achieved by improving his physical strength and by hitting the ball earlier on his groundshots. Though 25 years old, Harshs resolve and application will surely take him higher in the rankings. 

With Pakistan beating Thailand and Chinese Taipei, they stand hand in hand with India at the Pearly Gates of the last sixteen. Pakistans victories were unexpected and very laudable. To beat Thailand with Srichaphan, a former top-tenner, and then go on to beat Chinese Taipei ? who have possibly the most talented youngsters in Asia ? is no mean achievement. Pakistan now play against Chile in Chile. A very tough, near impossible assignment. 

India have drawn Sweden to play for a place in the last 16. Sweden have beaten us four times in ties that bordered on humiliation ? 4-1 in 1985 in Bangalore (grasscourt), 5-0 in 1987 in Gothenberg (indoor clay), 5-0 in 1996 in Calcutta (grasscourt) and 5-0 in 2000 in Bastad (clay). I remember the tie in Bangalore when the grasscourt was on reddish clay and the grass was as sparse as a hair transplant on a bald man. 

The Swedes proved to be too good even on this type of surface. So Leander and his gang, barring miracles, may well have to swim back to the waters of the Asia-Oceanic zone group I and try again next year.

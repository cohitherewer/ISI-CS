 Harika defeats top seed

Istanbul: WGM D. Harika raised hopes of an improved finish by defeating top seed and 2003 champion Nana Dzagnidze of Georgia in the 10th round of the World Junior Chess Championship here. 

National junior champion G. N. Gopal completed the formalities of his 10-games International Master norm despite losing to IM Alexander Kharitonov of Russia in the boys section. 

The girls championship was thrown wide open by IM Irina Vasilevich of Russia after she defeated championship leader Gu Xiaobing of China and emerged as the new leader on 8 points. She is now followed by Xiaobing and German IM Elisabeth Paehtz who are both on 7.5 points. 

Just a half point adrift in the next group of four is Harika, and a good finish in the remaining three rounds can still rope in a medal. 

The other Indian girls in the fray had mixed results as Tania Sachdev cruised to a fine victory against Vera Nebolisa of Russia, but last years bronze medallist Eesha Karavade went down to Beata Kadziolka of Poland. Kruttika Nadig beat Janyl Tilenbaeva of Kyrgyzstan. (PTI)

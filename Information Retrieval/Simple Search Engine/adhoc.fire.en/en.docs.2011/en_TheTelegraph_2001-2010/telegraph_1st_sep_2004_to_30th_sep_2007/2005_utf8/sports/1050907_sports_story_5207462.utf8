 Leander, Martina bow out

New York: Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova bowed out in the mixed doubles quarter final at the US Open on Monday. 

The seventh-seeded Paes and Navratilova fell to Serbian Nenad Zimonjic and Slovakias Katarina Srebotnik 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (11-9). 

Mahesh Bhupathi and Martin Damm of Czech Republic also had a disappointing day in office as they crashed out in the mens doubles pre-quarter finals. 

Seventh seeded Bhupathi and Damm lost 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 3-6 to ninth seeds Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Todd Perry of Australia in the third round. 

Bhupathi, however, is still in contention in the mixed doubles, where he is playing alongside Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. 

The unseeded duo are slated to play fifth-seeded Japanese Ai Sugiyama and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe in the quarter finals. 

In boys singles, Rupesh Roy advanced to the second round, defeating Nathaniel Schnugg of US 6-3, 6-4. He will next play Matt Bruch, also of the US, who beat Andre Miele of Brazil 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. 

In other first-round matches, Indias Jeevan Neduncherhiyan lost to Jesse Levine of US 4-6, 4-6. 

Roy, paired with David Simon of Austria, went down to American duo of Kellen Damico and Tim Smyczek 3-6, 0-6 in boys doubles. (Pti)

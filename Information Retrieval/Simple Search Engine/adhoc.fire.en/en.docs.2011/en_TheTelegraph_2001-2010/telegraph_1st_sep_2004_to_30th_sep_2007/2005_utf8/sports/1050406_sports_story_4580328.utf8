 Kallis century saves SA

Georgetown: Jacques Kallis scored a record-equalling century as South Africa hung on for a draw with the West Indies in the first Test on Monday. 

South Africa, who needed 355 to make the West Indies bat again, reached 269 for four in their second innings before the teams shook hands on a draw. Kallis scored 109 not out, equalling Gary Kirsten?s South African record of 21 Test centuries. 

Herschelle Gibbs scored 49 in a fourth-wicket stand of 139 that deflated the West Indies? hopes of forcing the victory after they had dominated the opening four days. 

The West Indies, who began the day with high hopes of a victory with South Africa on 85 for two, were made to pay for Kallis being dropped on 22 by wicketkeeper Courtney Browne off captain and leg-spinner Shivnarine Chanderpaul. 

Both captains later said they were satisfied with the draw.

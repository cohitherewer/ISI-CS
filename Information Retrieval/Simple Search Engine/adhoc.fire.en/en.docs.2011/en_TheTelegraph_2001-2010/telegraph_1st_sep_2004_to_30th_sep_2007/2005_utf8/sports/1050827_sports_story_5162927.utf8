 Vandana cards 83 to finish third

Chennai: India No. 1 Irina Brar of Chandigarh won the Madras Ladies Golf Championship by three strokes on Friday despite a one-stroke penalty for delaying tactics. 

Bangalores 14-year-old Sharmila Nicollet (307) and Calcuttas Vandana Agarwal (308) finished behind Irina (304) in the open category (gold division). 

Nicollet also won the junior open title, followed by Sonam Chugh (312) and Vaishavi Sinha (315). Mysores Bhavana Shetty was disqualified for not having played her drop shot in the third round on Thursday from the intended area. Vandana, however, escaped unhurt for the same offence after an inquiry by officials. 

Vandana, the overnight leader, increased her lead from three to five strokes on the front nine. On the back, she triple bogeyed the 10th hole.

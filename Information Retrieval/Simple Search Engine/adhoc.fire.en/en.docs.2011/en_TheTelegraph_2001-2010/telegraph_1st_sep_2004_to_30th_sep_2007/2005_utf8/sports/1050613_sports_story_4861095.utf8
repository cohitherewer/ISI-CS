 New Delhi: India?s Vikas Gowda won the silver in discus at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) outdoor track and field meet in Sacramento.

 Vikas, who led the qualifiers on Thursday with a throw of 60.01, finished second in the final on Saturday with a throw of 60.07m.

 The gold went to Michael Robertson of Stanford University (61.70m), according to information received here.

 Vikas had finished fifth here in 2003.

 The Karnataka-born athlete, who studies at the University of North Carolina, had set an Indian best of 64.69m while winning the Charlotte invitation on April 2.

 India?s Mohinder Singh Gill has the credit of winning back to back NCAA titles in the triple jump in 1970-71.

 New Delhi: Indian athletes won 15 medals, including eight gold, in an international event for disable athletes ? the DSE Open athletics championship ? in Manchester.

 Sunil Kumar and Pratap Sinha, both in the blind class, led india?s charge with a gold and a silver each as the side also claimed five silvers and two bronzes, the Paralympic Committee of India said in a release on Sunday.

 Auckland: World Cup winning fly-half Jonny Wilkinson will make his first appearance on the British Irish Lions tour of New Zealand on Wednesday, when he lines up against Wellington.

 Hampered by a string of injuries that kept him out of international rugby from the World Cup final in 2003 until the Lions match against Argentina in Cardiff last month, Wilkinson will start in a backline widely expected to be named for the first Test against the All Blacks on June 25.

 Madrid: Michael Owen says that despite the speculation linking him with a return to the Premiership, he is reluctant to leave Real Madrid and will move only if the club tells him to go.

 ?I don?t know what my situation is at the moment, but I know I am happy here,? the England striker said in an interview with a Spanish sports daily on Sunday. ?All that I?ve been told is that Real Madrid are happy with me? I?m not thinking of leaving. Of course if someone comes and tells me there is a club interested in me and that I have to leave then I?ll have to go.?

 Owen, who joined Real from Liverpool for 12 million euros last August, had a difficult first few months at the club but earned himself a regular place in the starting line-up by the end of the season.

 Barcelona: World champion Valentino Rossi crushed Sete Gibernau?s hopes of a first win this season by snatching the lead and victory from the Spaniard three laps from the finish of the Catalan Grand Prix on Sunday.

 It was a fourth successive win for the Italian and his fifth in six races this season. He extended his lead at the top of the championship standings to 58 points over compatriot Marco Melandri, who finished third behind Gibernau.

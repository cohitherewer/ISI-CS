 This isnt hell, says Parreira

Buenos Aires: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said that Wednesdays 1-3 World Cup qualifying defeat away to Argentina did not mean that the world champions had gone from heaven to hell. 

Brazil had arrived in Buenos Aires amid a wave of euphoria after routing Paraguay 4-1 at the weekend, but they were happy to keep the scoreline respectable on Wednesday after going 0-3 down in their first 40 minutes. 

The win was revenge for Argentina, who lost by the same score in Belo Horizonte in an earlier group game last year and were also beaten on penalties in a dramatic Copa America final last July following a 2-2 draw. 

Beating Paraguay wasnt paradise, so this isnt hell, Parreira said. Our target is still intact, nothing has changed. Argentina have avenged last years defeat, we won 3-1 there and they won 3-1 here. 

Brazil stayed on course for a place at the World Cup despite the defeat while Argentina made sure of their spot with three games to play. 

In the first half, they put us under a lot of pressure, they were fresh, they were marking us and closing us down, Parreira said. 

A quick goal changes the whole story and I think Argentina won the game in the first 20 minutes.

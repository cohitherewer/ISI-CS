 Barthez triggers a French crisis 

 - Lawyers ready to move civil courts 

 Barthez 

Paris: By spitting at the referee during an obscure friendly, Fabien Barthez has triggered a crisis in French football. 

The effective suspension of the Olympique Marseille and France goalkeeper for only three months last week has sparked controversy within the French Football Federation (FFF). 

It has also raised fears among French referees that it might get more difficult for them to be respected by the players, not only in Ligue 1 matches but also at amateur level. 

The FFF has appealed the ruling by its disciplinary committee, saying that the governing body?s rules state that the punishment for such an offence should be a ban for at least six months with no suspension. 

The appeals committee of the FFF is expected to come up with a new, tougher sentence within the next two weeks but Barthez?s lawyers have already threatened to take the case to the civil courts. 

With the end of the season approaching, the sanction announced on Friday, a six-month ban with three of them suspended, means Barthez will miss only four Ligue 1 games and will be available when the new season starts on July 30. 

?I?m surprised because I think that respect for the referee is of paramount importance,? French sports minister Jean-Francois Lamour said immediately after Friday?s ruling. 

The FFF then said it would appeal but insisted its decision had nothing to do with pressure from the government. 

?Our only concern is that our rules were not interpreted correctly,? said FFF president Jean-Pierre Escalettes. 

Bernard Saules, the president of the National Union of French referees (UNAF), called the verdict ?simply ridiculous? and said it could have repercussions on the amateur game. 

?When you have problems in Ligue 1 games on a given weekend, you have problems in the amateur games the following Sunday,? he said. ?The showcase matches have to be clean, otherwise the sport as a whole suffers.? 

French referees had been saying even before the Barthez case that there was a growing lack of respect for referees, and not only in the professional game. 

Marseille said they would defend Barthez and did not rule out taking the matter to the civil courts if the sanction were to be revised. 

?Marseille will fight for their rights and for the rights of their goalkeeper,? said club chairman Pape Diouf. ?We have the feeling that some people want to drive Barthez out of French football. That?s the reason why we are ready to appeal.? (Reuters)

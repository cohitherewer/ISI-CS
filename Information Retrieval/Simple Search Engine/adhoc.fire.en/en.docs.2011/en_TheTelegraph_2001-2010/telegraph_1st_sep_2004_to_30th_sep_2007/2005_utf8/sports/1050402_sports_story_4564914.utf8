 Court restrains minister

Colombo: A Sri Lankan court has issued an order preventing the sports minister from taking over assets of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), which was suspended last week over allegations of mismanagement, an attorney said. 

The building housing offices of SLC was sealed off last Sunday ? two days after sports minister Jeevan Kumaratunga suspended cricket?s administrative body and appointed an interim committee to run the sport. 

The court petition by the board?s elected administration was launched to prevent the government-appointed committee from taking over the board?s offices and money. 

M.A. Sumanthiran, attorney for SLC, said the court order will be enforced until April 12. The judges also ordered Kumaratunga and his secretary to appear in court on April 11 when the case will be heard again. (AP)

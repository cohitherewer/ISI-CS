Shenzhen (China): Gaurav Ghei made a big move on the third day of the $1.3 m Volvo China Open when he shot a fine five-under 67 to jump to tied eighth place from overnight 25th at the Shenzhen Golf Club here on Saturday. 

Making it a fine day for the Indians were Jyoti Randhawa (71) and Shiv Kapur (70), who fought back on a tough day to join Ghei in tied eighth place. Missing out on the party was Rahil Gangjee (71) who was lying 37th. 

Rookie Ross Fisher moved within reach of a dream start to his season when he grabbed the third-round lead. 

The Briton, who celebrated his 25th birthday on Tuesday, carded a four-under-par 68 to move to 11 under going into Sundays final round at the Shenzen Golf Club. 

Randhawa missed a string of birdies on the back nine, but Kapur slammed four in the last five holes to make up for a disappointing front nine. 

Ghei, who was second at the Hero Honda Indian Open last month and then 12th at the Double A International, has had a lot of top-20 finishes this year. 

I thought I will be a few shots behind at the end of the day. It was kind of surprising as I hit the ball terrible today. I didnt hit any good shots. But luckily, I made all the putts that I needed to. I hit the ball so much better in the first two days, and didnt get the putts going then. 

Shiv Kapur fought well in his bid to maintain his string of top-10 finishes. Two-over on the front nine, he sizzled on the back nine. 

Overnight leader Chawalit Plaphol ? bidding to become the first Thai to win on the European Tour ? had a miserable front nine to fritter away his three-shot advantage and finished one shot behind Fisher with Oliver Wilson. 

Chawalit bogeyed the third and fifth before dropping two shots at the par-four seventh. He then hit his approach into water at the par-five eighth to drop another shot. 

Fisher, who finished 18th on the Challenge Tour last season before earning his Tour card at qualifying school, rattled in six birdies and carded just a couple of bogeys to seize the lead on the second tournament on the 2006 European Tour schedule. 

This is unchartered territory, Fisher said on the European Tours website. I played a few Tour events last season which has been a massive help to me, just to be out there competing with the big boys. 

It was pretty cool to see my name on the leaderboard yesterday and to see it now on top is an awesome feeling. I cant wait for Sunday. 

Fellow Englishman Wilson, a member of the victorious 2003 Walker Cup team, joined Chawalit on 10 under for a share of second place with a steady 71 featuring 15 consecutive pars before he birdied the par-three 16th. 

Chinas Lian-Wei Zhang was the days biggest mover, jumping to fourth with a best-of-the-day 66, a round only marred by a bogey at the last. Zhang was the only Chinese player to make the cut. 

Denmarks Soren Kjeldsen, and Englishmen Barry Lane and Miles Tunnicliff were a further shot back at eight under. (Agencies)

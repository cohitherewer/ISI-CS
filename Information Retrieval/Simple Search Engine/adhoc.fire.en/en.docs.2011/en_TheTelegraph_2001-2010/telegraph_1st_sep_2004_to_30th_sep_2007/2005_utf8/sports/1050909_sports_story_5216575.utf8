Calcutta: The empty terraces spoke eloquently of East Bengals troubled times. Eight points behind runaway leaders Mohun Bagan after being beaten twice by Amal Duttas men this season, the red-and-gold backers seem to have given up on the CFL Premier Division. 

The thousand-odd people who turned up at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday did, however, get to see a pair of brilliant goals which helped East Bengal overcome recently-crowned Kalinga Cup champions Ever-Ready 2-1. 

Syed Rahim Nabi once again showed his prowess as a quality striker to put his team ahead in the 29th minute with his sixth goal of the League. Snehasish Chakraborty drew level 20 minutes after half-time. Within four minutes, Shylo Malsawmtluanga came up with a stunning strike which turned out to be the winner. 

Ever-Ready, incidentally, held East Bengal goalless in the red-and-golds opening match of the league. 

The two goals and a half-hour second-session spell apart, East Bengal were thoroughly pedestrian. The midfield looked ragged and bereft of ideas, with Dipankar Roy being the sole trier. The versatile Nabi, enjoying his role up front, was relatively mobile but got little support from fellow-striker R.C. Prakash or the linkmen. 

K. Kulothungan, coming in early as Prakashs replacement, managed to inject some life into the East Bengal ranks. It was a Kulothungan square pass which set up the first goal. Nabi trapped the ball just outside the penalty box, beat the challenge of Surajit Chakraborty and unleashed a right-footer which had goal written all over it. Not only did he pack a lot of punch, the placement was spot-on. 

The only other time East Bengal threatened the Ever-Ready citadel in the opening half was in the 23rd minute when an Arun Malhotra header off a corner kick was smartly tipped over the crosspiece by Shibram Dey. That wasnt the Ever-Ready custodians only good work of the afternoon. 

With East Bengal suddenly realising that the flanks had to be utilised, the Ever-Ready defence faced a barrage of forays. A rejuvenated Malsawmtluanga down the right channel and Saumik Dey from the left provided inviting crosses which werent converted. 

On two occasions, the Ever-Ready defence denied East Bengal sure goals. In the 51st minute, Saumik and Nabi combined to set up Malsawmtluanga whose push was partially cleared by Shibram. The ball came back to Malsawmtluanga but his second shot was kicked away from the goalline by Surajit. 

Minutes later, Saumik, Nabi and Dipankar were involved in a three-touch move. This time, Shibram stretched a leg out to divert Dipankars shot off harms way. 

A hitherto defensive Ever-Ready got somewhat transformed after the introduction of Crispin Chhetri. The long-haired medio was at the root of a series of dangerous moves, the first of which fetched the equaliser. He found Eugene Gray on the right, the striker beat a diving Rajat Ghosh Dastidar with a minus from the goalline. An unmarked Snehasish tapped the ball into an empty goal. 

Ever-Readys joy lasted just over three minutes as Malsawmtluanga produced sheer magic. He flicked the ball over Snehasishs head, went wide and turned quickly to send the ball crashing into the far corner of the net. It was a goal worth travelling miles to see.

Close on their heels are seven players with 4.5 points each. 

On a day of upsets, Padmini, the Asian U- 12 girls champion, showed her class in the endgame as she systematically outmanoeuvred the top seed, Kh. Sanjoy Singh in the fourth round, and then outplayed fifth seed Suman Basu of Madhyamgram HS. 

This 11 round Swiss League tournament is being presented by Linc with Bata being the co-sponsor. 

Sanjoys woes continued in the fifth round as he was held by Avinash Singh of Chhattisgarh. Sanjoy now has 3.5 points to his credit. 

Ankush Khandelwal, the U-14 British chess champion was fortunate to salvage a win despite having an inferior position in the fourth round against Chandrima Ghosh. In the fifth round he won with ease against Shantanil Simlai in the Dutch defence.

 El Cid wins thrilling finish 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Apprentice Vinay Jaiswal was a delight to watch on Wednesday. His dare-devilry paid off, albeit in a close finish, when he pushed his horse El Cid through a narrow gap offered by Sea Legend (Rutherford Alford up), along the rails. It happened during the crucial stage of the race ? the day?s feature event, the Robin Hood Cup.

 What is more important, the apprentice had learnt his lesson in less that 30 minutes. Faced with similar situation in the previous race, Vinay had chickened out and switched the course. Still he triumphed on trainer Javed Khan?s Quintet in the Dangerous Romance Cup.

 Earlier Rutherford guided, father, Richard?s well-backed Serengetti to an easy victory in the Idolator Handicap. Tarak Nath Jaiswal who saddled El Cid, was also associated with Regal Rocket?s victory.

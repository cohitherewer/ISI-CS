The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bowlers swung this series

 Guest Column

 Ian Chappell

 This Ashes series, which has been 

 the most entertaining of my time, hadnt lacked for 

 anything, except rain. Then Jupiter Pluvius made a dramatic 

 entry [stage above] to add another twist to Australias 

 last-ditch attempt to retain the urn.

 Ironically, a damp outfield is 

 the one thing that can render difficult the two skills that 

 have shaped this titanic battle. In a captivating series 

 weve seen ample evidence why swing bowlers and leg-spinners 

 are great for the game of cricket.

 England surprisingly took the 

 advantage in the series thanks to the ample movement gained 

 by the highly competitive Andrew Flintoff and the much-improved 

 Simon Jones. Meanwhile, Australia cling to life in the strong 

 grip of Shane Warnes fingers and supple wrist, both 

 of which complemented his agile mind in tormenting the English 

 batsmen. 

 Strong man Charles Atlas was once 

 depicted as having the world on his back; for the bulk of 

 this series Warne has carried Australia on his shoulders.

 Both arts have a lot in common; 

 to be effective swing bowlers and leg-spinners, bowlers 

 need to pitch the ball up, which in turn provides opportunities 

 for batsmen to drive the ball. Consequently, when either 

 artist is plying his trade, the cricket is always entertaining 

 and an absorbing battle of brains rather than a matter of 

 pure brawn.

 Administrators would be well advised 

 to write a line in the laws that encourage bowlers to swing 

 the ball in order to ensure this never becomes a dying art. 

 The secret to fostering wrist-spin could well be found in 

 a suggestion made by former champion Bill Tiger 

 Reilly that, the rules [sic] cease to discriminate 

 against leg-spin.

 According to Reilly, English 

 administrators of the 1930s: Evidently despise[d] 

 leg-spin, yet they [their players] have always been absolute 

 suckers for it.

 The last part of Reillys 

 statement still holds true and Warne has forcibly reinforced 

 his words.

 Warne set a stiff examination 

 for the England batsmen on Day one and none, not even century 

 maker Andrew Strauss, passed the footwork test.

 Despite his success in the series, 

 Marcus Trescothick has to shoulder a lot of the blame for 

 the fact that Australia is still in a position to retain 

 The Ashes. At a time when England was in a position to crush 

 their opponents, Trescothick got himself out and opened 

 the door and Warne came barging right through.

 The gritty Justin Langer provided 

 Trescothick with a lesson in do or die batting.

 Captain Michael Vaughan is another 

 England batsman who needs to make bowlers earn his wicket 

 more often. Trescothick and Vaughan have to realise there 

 are times in a game when the result is balancing like a 

 trapeze artist and one slip can trigger a disaster. It is 

 not a plausible excuse to say, Oh, hes a stroke-maker 

 and that is the way he plays.

 Senior players should have a gut 

 feel for the mood of a game and at crucial times they 

 need to buckle down and ensure opposition bowlers earn their 

 wickets. 

 Until Englands senior batsmen 

 emulate Flintoffs temperament and produce that bit 

 extra when the game is in the balance, they will not be 

 able to dominate against strong opposition.

 Australia has been a champion 

 side for a long while but that aura has now been diminished 

 by an aggressive England team. Even if they retain the Ashes, 

 it is unlikely Australia will continue to dominate against 

 strong sides. 

 So what is in store for Ricky 

 Pontings side after this series?

 With Glenn McGrath and Warne in 

 his side Ponting has developed a style of captaincy that 

 is highly dependent on the champion bowlers. The rule of 

 law is attack when they are operating and when they arent, 

 sit back and wait for the batsmen to get themselves out. 

 This method will continue to work while McGrath and Warne 

 are playing. 

 And even when they are gone it 

 will work against lesser teams ? but when the two champions 

 retire, that method is doomed against strong opposition. 

 At the end of this series Ponting 

 needs to sit down with Brett Lee and Shaun Tait and map 

 out a plan for the future based on a mixture of sensible 

 aggression and prudent attack in times of retreat. 

 At the moment the disparity between 

 the attacking and defensive fields provided for the younger 

 fast bowlers is too great and occurs suddenly with no sign 

 of gradual retreat. It can appear as a lack of faith in 

 the bowler but to be fair to Ponting, the pace men do need 

 to be more circumspect in length.

 However, that is in the future 

 and currently Ponting has more pressing matters on his mind.

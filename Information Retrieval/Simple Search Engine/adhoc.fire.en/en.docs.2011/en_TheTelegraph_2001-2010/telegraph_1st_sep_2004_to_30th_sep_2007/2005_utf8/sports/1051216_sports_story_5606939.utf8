 MLAs from Jharkhand get into act

Ranchi: Sourav Gangulys exclusion from the Test team has led a dozen of Jharkhand MLAs to seek presidential interference. 

Dropping Sourav Ganguly is unjust and justice should be done to him... Who seems to have fallen victim to cricketing politics, said a memorandum faxed to President A.P.J Abdul Kalam. 

The memorandum also said that a winning squad is seldom changed, so Souravs scores were enough to retain his place. The signatories include JMM and Congress MLAs.

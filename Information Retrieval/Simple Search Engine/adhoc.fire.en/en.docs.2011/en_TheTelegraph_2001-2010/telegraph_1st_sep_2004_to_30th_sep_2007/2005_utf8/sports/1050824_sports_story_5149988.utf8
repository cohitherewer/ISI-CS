 Charlesworth accepts NZC post

New Delhi: Indian hockeys loss is New Zealand Crickets (NZCs) gain. Ric Charlesworth, once an applicant for the job of Indian hockey coach, has accepted the offer to join as the NZC as its new high-performance manager. 

The appointment was announced by NZC chief Martin Snedden via a press statement on Tuesday. 

Charlesworth played over 200 hockey internationals for Australia over 16 years from 1972 and later coached the Australian womens team to two Olympic gold medals. He also got the Australian coach of the year award six times. 

Just two years back, when the Indian Hockey Federation was looking for its first foreign coach, the Aussie legend had shown interest. He again expressed his desire to coach the Indian hockey team before the Lahore Champions Trophy last year, but the IHF ignored him and appointed Rajinder Singh Jr. 

Now that hes got a call from across the Tasman, Charlesworth decided to offer his services to cricket. Charlesworth will replace former New Zealand batsman John Reid, who has left NZC after a decade to accept a new role with Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC). 

Charlesworths cricket credentials include playing 47 first-class matches for Western Australia from 1972 to 1979.

 Federer fends off Rochus

 - Venus gets better of Serena, to meet Clijsters in quarters 

 Venus Williams consoles sister Serena after defeating her 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 at Flushing Meadow on Sunday 

New York: Flushing Meadow witnessed another curiously unsatisfying episode of the Venus and Serena Williams story on Sunday. This time Venus enjoyed the happy ending, winning 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 to level their head-to-head record at seven-all and move through to the US Open quarter finals. 

There the Wimbledon champion will face in-form Belgian fourth seed Kim Clijsters, who embarrassed Venezuelas Maria Vento-Kabchi 6-1, 6-0. 

They were joined in the last eight by Russian top seed Maria Sharapova, who produced her best tennis of the tournament to beat hard-hitting Indian Sania Mirza 6-2, 6-1 and reach the quarter finals for the first time (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

Mens defending champion Roger Federer fended off tenacious Belgian Olivier Rochus, winning their third round match 6-3, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 despite lacking some of his usual fluency. 

Third seed Lleyton Hewitt was stretched to the limit by American Taylor Dent (also reported in Mondays Late City edition) in a five-set thriller but won to stay on course for a semi-final showdown against Federer. 

As so often in the past, the meeting of sports most famous siblings was a strangely muted, messy affair. Venus won a protracted first set in a tie-break and after that Serenas inferior physical condition ultimately counted against her. 

The last time they played at a Grand Slam Venus was stricken with an abdominal strain and lost a low-key Wimbledon final to Serena in 2003. This time eighth seed Serenas left knee and ankle problems came home to roost. 

Mirza is probably the only womens tennis player who can rival Sharapovas global marketing potential thanks to her enormous Indian fan base and she also has a forehand of Sharapova-like proportions. The Russian was at times out-hit by her fellow 18-year-old in the first set but too many unforced errors by the Indian. 

Sharapova will play compatriot and ninth seed Nadia Petrova in the last eight. 

 Petrova reached the quarter finals for the second consecutive year with a 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 victory over temperamental 16-year-old Czech Nicole Vaidisova. 

Federer almost lost his first set of the tournament when he trailed 1-4 in the second set tie-break against Rochus, his former junior doubles partner. 

The Swiss will play German Nicolas Kiefer, who beat Arnaud Clement of France 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-1 in the last 16. 

Hewitt quelled Dent 6-3, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-2, 7-5 on a breezy Arthur Ashe Court. The 2001 champion will play Slovakias Dominik Hrbaty in the fourth round. Hrbaty, seeded 15, beat David Ferrer of Spain in 6-7 (7-9), 7-5, 7-5, 7-5. 

Jarkko Nieminen became only the second Finnish man to reach the fourth round at a Grand Slam, and the first at the US Open, when he beat Belaruss Max Mirnyi 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 6-3. 

Spains Fernando Verdasco is the Finns fourth round opponent. He fought out a 6-1, 4-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 6-4 win over Serbia and Montenegro teenager Novak Djokovic. 

Davide Sanguinetti became the first Italian to reach the last 16 of the mens singles for 11 years after an epic four-hour, 24-minute 6-3, 4-6, 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5) win over Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan.

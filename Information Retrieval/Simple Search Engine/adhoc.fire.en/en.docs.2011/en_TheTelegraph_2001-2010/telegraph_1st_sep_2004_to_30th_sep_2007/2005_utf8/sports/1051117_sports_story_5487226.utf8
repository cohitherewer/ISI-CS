The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill still have to be consistent: Yuvraj

 - Not thinking of retaining Test berth right now... Focus is on this series 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Hyderabad: Its rare for somebody from the losing team to be adjudged the MoM, but Yuvraj Singh got that recognition for a splendid 103 in the opening face-off against South Africa on Wednesday. 

Yuvrajs fifth ODI hundred came in very demanding circumstances, with India three down for five, which is why the adjudicators chose him and not any South African. Incidentally, he has now posted three hundreds this season ? one more than current captain Rahul Dravid. 

Actually, hed been short on runs at home till the brilliant unbeaten 79 in the sixth match versus Sri Lanka, in Rajkot, last week. 

Its nice to be back among the runs, but Im not thinking of retaining my Test berth (against Lanka)... Right now, the focus is on this series, Yuvraj, one of the original Young Turks (other being Mohammed Kaif), told The Telegraph at the Taj Residency. 

However, Yuvraj accepted the runs would position him well in the lead-up to the selectors meeting in Mumbai later this month. Of course, nothing is guaranteed and he acknowledged that, too: Present form is fine, but Im aware Ill still have to be consistent over the next four ODIs... 

Yuvraj played both Tests in Zimbabwe earlier this season and, overall, has featured in eight of them. The outstanding 112 in Lahore last year remains his highest in the longer version. 

Earlier, interacting with the Media after the match, Yuvraj said hed matured and nowadays looked to bat till the end. That was my aim today as well, but I got run out in the closing stages of our innings... 

Asked just how difficult it was to bat at No. 5 or even 6 in ODIs, he replied: It can be tough, but the teams interest comes first... Cricket is a team game and a players preference doesnt count. 

Yuvraj, who completed five years of international cricket last month, couldnt have been more candid.

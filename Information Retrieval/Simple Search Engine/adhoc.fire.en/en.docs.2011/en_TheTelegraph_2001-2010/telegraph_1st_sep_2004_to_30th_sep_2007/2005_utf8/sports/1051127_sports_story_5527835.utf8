 Rudra Pratap: Well bounce back 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Rudra Pratap Singh feels India will bounce back against South Africa in the final ODI in Mumbai. 

Admitting that Graeme Smith amp; Co. had a better batting than Sri Lankas, the rookie pacer said that Team India have the confidence to square the series. 

It was, however, an entirely different experience for him at the Eden. I played for India under-19 side here against Australia last year. But at that time the stadium was not packed. It was a new kind of experience and pressure for me on Friday. But its expected, he said. 

During an interaction with the media at the team hotel on Saturday, he revealed the superstitious side of the aggressive bowler. Being the only child of the family, my mother wants me to wear a few black ribbons, he said. 

According to him, Greg Chappell has taught me about field placing and given me confidence. Seniors like Sachin and Rahul also give me valuable tips whenever needed, he added. 

S. Sreesanth, on the other hand, stressed that he wanted to be the fastest bowler. 

Meanwhile, both India and South Africa left the city for Mumbai on Saturday. While Chappell and others took the early morning flight, Singh, Sreesanth and Mahendra Singh Dhoni left in the afternoon.

 Ascoli, Treviso promoted 

Milan: Ascoli and Treviso will play in Italys Serie A next season the Italian Football Federation ruled on Tuesday. 

The two clubs have been handed a place in the top division after Torino and Genoa, who had won promotion from Serie B, were both denied their places. 

Treviso, who have never been in the top flight, finished fifth in Serie B last season, one place above Ascoli who were last in Serie A in 1992. 

Torino will play in Serie B after their finances failed to meet approval while Genoa have been demoted to Serie C1 after a match-fixing probe. 

The federations ruling should put an end to weeks of wrangling over which clubs deserved to be given a Serie A place and is a blow to relegated Bologna who had hoped for a reprieve. 

The Serie A season starts on August 27. (Reuters)

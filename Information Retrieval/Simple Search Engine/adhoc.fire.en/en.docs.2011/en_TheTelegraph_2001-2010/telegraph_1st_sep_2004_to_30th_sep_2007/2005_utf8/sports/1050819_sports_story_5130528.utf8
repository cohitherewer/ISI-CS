 Twenty20 makes sense, says Shoaib Malik

Bangalore: Twenty20 cricket, the shortest version of the game that has made headway in England and Australia, is all excitement and action which a band of international cricketers find quite irresistible. 

Twenty20 is good excitement and good to play. Its a good variety and one has to keep adjusting ones game, says Sri Lankas Russel Arnold. Its getting popular. But its difficult to say whether it would eclipse one-day cricket. Only time will tell. 

Arnold along with some other cricketers from the island nation, Pakistan and England have arrived here for the three-day championship for Bradman Cup which commences Friday. Its getting popular even in Pakistan. Its catching up, said Pakistani speedster Mohammed Sami. 

According to Adam Hollioake of England, while a county game attracted 1,000 people normally in England, a full-house turns up for a Twenty20 game. Its very popular. 

He thinks the game might overtake one-day matches in the years to come. But its hard to say. I suppose only time will tell, he added. Hollioake said Twenty20 cricket might be popular with different types of crowd and added this type of cricket is high on entertainment and excitement and it is more like soccer and rugby. 

Pakistans Shoaib Malik said it is good from the point of view of the crowd and the players. It makes sense, he said. Cricket isnt an Olympic sport because it takes too much time. 

Indias one-day wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni feels Twenty20 can be successful but then international calendar these days is hectic and packed with Test matches and one-day games. Players may not get time to play in this type of game. It is really exciting mainly for spectators and batsmen, he said. 

According to rules for the matches, duration of each innings is 75 minutes with teams incurring a six-run penalty for failing to bowl the full 20 overs within the time limit. 

The championship will see six teams in action ? Karnataka State Cricket Association, Bradman World XI and Chemplast in group A, and New South Wales, Air India and CAB XI in group B.

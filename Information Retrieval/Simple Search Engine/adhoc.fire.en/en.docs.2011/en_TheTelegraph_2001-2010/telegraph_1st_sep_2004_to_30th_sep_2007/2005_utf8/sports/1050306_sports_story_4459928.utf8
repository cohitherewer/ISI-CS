 Lara, 6 others to be dropped

Bridgetown: West Indies captain Brian Lara and other leading players will be dropped for the home series against South Africa and Pakistan because of their contracts with former national team sponsor Cable and Wireless. 

West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) president Teddy Griffith said on Friday that Lara, Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Fidel Edwards, Dwayne Bravo, Ravi Rampaul and Dwayne Smith would not be considered for selection because of their existing contracts with a competitor of the board?s title sponsor, Digicel. 

Griffith made the announcement live on radio and television, clarifying the WICB?s position on the most issue which has plagued the region?s cricket for four months. (AP)

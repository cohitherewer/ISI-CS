 Big W Rain Man has no regrets

London: Rain Man was enjoying some sunshine, before rain butted in, Friday. 

Wimbledon tournament referee Alan Mills, who earned his nickname as the official who orders the covers on when rain stops play, is retiring after 23 years in one of tennis most high profile jobs. 

He has no regrets about the timing especially as Wimbledon has decided by 2009 to put a sliding roof on Centre Court, the most famous stage in the sport. 

Mills never supported the plan and said: The majority of the players I have asked about the roof say it is not necessary. Rain delays are all part of the charm of Wimbledon. They expect them. 

But, in an interview, Mills sought to allay the fears of traditionalists. 

I dont think the grass will go. It is definitely here to stay, he said of the only Grand Slam tournament still played on the sports original surface. 

Mills, sitting on the terrace overlooking courts bathed in sunshine (before rain intervened, that is), was in philosophical mood reflecting on all the changes in tennis ? mostly for the better. 

The referee, given an affectionate hug by Belgiums Kim Clijsters as she headed down to the players lounge, thinks players are much better behaved now. 

His clashes with Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe are just a memory. McEnroe even offered a fond dedication to Mills autobiography Lifting the Covers. 

The behaviour of the players has changed for the better. Now with professional officials on the courts, rapport and respect have developed. 

But what of fans who long for larger-than-life personalities in a game that is now a multi-million dollar entertainment industry? 

There was a spell when there was a lack of characters. But they are coming back. Take Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Marat Safin ? they have an army of fans. Look at womens tennis with the Williams sisters and Sharapova.

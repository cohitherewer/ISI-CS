 Topalov shocks Anand

Sofia: Top seed Viswanathan Anand was humbled by Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the sixth round of the MTel Masters chess meet here on Wednesday. 

Former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukra-ine also scored an unexpected win against classical champ-ion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, while Judit Polgar of Hungary recorded a sweet victory over British Michael Adams. 

The tournament standings saw some major changes on a day when all three games ended decisively. 

Ponomariov became the new leader with 3.5 points while Topalov, Kramnik, Adams and Polgar are right behind with three each. 

The loss proved simply too costly for Anand as he was pushed to the last spot in this category 20 double round robin meet. Just four rounds remain and the Indian has 2.5 points. (PTI)

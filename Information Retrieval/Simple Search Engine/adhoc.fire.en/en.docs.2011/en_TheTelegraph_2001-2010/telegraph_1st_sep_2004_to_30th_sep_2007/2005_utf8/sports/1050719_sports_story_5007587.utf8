The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Selection panels named

 - AFRO-ASIAN CUP - Squads to be chosen by August 1 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ravi Shastri is one of the selectors 

Calcutta: The squads for the Afro-Asian Cup, organised by the Afro-Asian Cricket Co-operation and featuring three one-day Internationals between Asia XI and Africa XI, will be selected by two panels of neutral selectors from the two continents by August 1, chairman Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Monday. 

The Asian Cricket Council-nominated panel will include Ravi Shastri from India, Majid Khan from Pakistan and Sri Lankas Sidath Wettimuny, Dalmiya said, adding, Bangladeshs member has not been decided yet. 

That Ravi Shastri and Majid Khan may be in the selectors panel was indicated by The Telegraph on Monday. 

Mike Proctor from South Africa, Psyche Nkala from Zimbabwe and Tom Tikolo (Kenya) will form the Africa Cricket Association-nominated panel, Dalmiya informed, during the AACCs first-ever press meet at a city hotel. 

The first ODI will be played on August 17 at the SuperSport Park, Centurion, followed by the next two (August 20 and 21) at Kingsmead in Durban, said the AACC chairman, who was flanked by vice-chairman Peter Chingoka, chief executive Syed Ashraful Huq and Cassim Suliman, chief executive of ACA. 

Refusing to name the sponsors or the company who would bag the telecast rights for the event, Dalmiya said, talks are on at an advanced stage and the matches (starts from 12 noon, Africa time) will be telecast live. 

The prize money for the series will be a whopping $100,000, with $25,000 going to the winning team, $5,000 for the Man of the Match and $10,000 for the Man of the Series. 

The revenue from the matches will go towards the development of the game and 10 per cent has been earmarked for charity, Dalmiya informed. 

As a mark of close co-operation between the two continents to promote the game at the grassroots, Dalmiya, who is also the Asian Cricket Council president said, an under-19 tournament, featuring six teams (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa and Zimbabwe) will take place around November or December 2000. It will be a sort of preparatory tourney for the upcoming under-19 World Cup.

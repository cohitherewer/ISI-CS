The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sprem hoping to be 3rd-time lucky

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Top seed Anastasia Myskina trounced Estonian Kaia Kanepi 6-3, 6-1 to set up a clash with Karolina Sperm at the Sunfeast Open on Saturday. Sperm upset second seed Elena Likhovtseva 4-6, 6-4, 6-1. 

It wasnt as easy as the scoreline suggests, said Myskina at the post-match press conference. Kaia was serving pretty well, particularly at the beginning of the first set. But thereafter it got easier. 

Sprem, in her third Tour final, is hoping to be third time lucky. How does she think it is going to be in the final? I always tend to lose if it is a three-setter in the final, said Sprem.

Le Mans (France): World champion Valentino Rossi grabbed pole position for the French Grand Prix with a spectacular late lap in Saturdays MotoGP qualifying. 

The Italian clocked the best time of one minute 33.226 seconds around the tricky, 4,180-metre Le Mans track with a few seconds left in a session held in cloudy but dry conditions. 

American Colin Edwards, who looked set for pole until the final moments, was second best, 0.223 second slower than his Yamaha teammate. 

Italian Marco Melandri, second to Rossi in the world championship standings after two podium finishes from three rounds, was third fastest on a Honda. 

Melandris teammate Sete Gibernau of Spain, trying to become the first rider with three Le Mans victories in the premier class after winning the last two years, clocked the fourth best time. 

A good position on the grid is crucial at Le Mans, a track featuring many tight corners and offering very few opportunities to overtake. 

Rossis time was well inside the circuit record lap of 1:34.088 set in last years race by compatriot and arch-rival Max Biaggi, who had a frustrating session on Saturday with the eighth best time on a Honda. 

It was a fantastic lap, said Rossi, who has won two of the seasons first three races. 

The Italian phenomenon won at Le Mans in 2002 but this is not his favourite track and he has often struggled here, notably last year, when he finished fourth. 

We suffered in free practice (on Friday) but today was good, said Rossi. We worked a lot on the tyres and the suspension and we did a great job, he added. (Reuters)

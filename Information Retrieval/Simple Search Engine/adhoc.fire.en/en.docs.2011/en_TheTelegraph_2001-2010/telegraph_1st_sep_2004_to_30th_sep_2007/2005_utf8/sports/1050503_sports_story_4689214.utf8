 Inzy focused on next challenge 

Abu Dhabi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq does not want to sit on past laurels. 

After leading exceptionally well in India in the recently-concluded Test as well as one-day series, the 35-year-old has now put his eyes on the upcoming challenge ? a series against the West Indies in the Caribbeans starting later this month. 

?It was a nice feeling after coming home from the India series. The reception we got was fabulous and all enjoyed it. But now it?s a thing of the past,? Inzamam said here on Monday. 

?Now we have the series against the West Indies and we are looking forward to it. We have to work hard, focus on our game and do the planning for the new challenge.?

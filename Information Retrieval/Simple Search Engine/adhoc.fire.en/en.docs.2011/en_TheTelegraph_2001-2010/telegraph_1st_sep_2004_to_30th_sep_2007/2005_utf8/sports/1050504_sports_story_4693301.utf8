 Threat of expulsion on BAR

 Wednesday?s hearing could strip Button of third place 

London: BAR could be thrown out of the Formula One championship if an appeal court finds evidence against them on Wednesday. 

Alternatively, the Honda-powered team and Jenson Button could emerge from the Paris hearing as contenders for victory in Spain this weekend. 

For the second time in a matter of months, BAR and their highly-rated young British driver must wait for a legal verdict that threatens to have a profound effect on their futures together. 

The hearing could strip Button of third place and expose BAR to heavy sanctions. International automobile federation (FIA) president Max Mosley has said any team found cheating can expect to be kicked out of the championship. 

If all goes well for BAR the ruling, expected on Thursday, will confirm Button as the third-place finisher at the April 24 San Marino Grand Prix and rubber-stamp the legality of his car. Should the evidence persuade the court that BAR are guilty of cheating, however, the team risks the ultimate sanction of a suspension. 

BAR, among the favourites for Sunday?s race in Barcelona, are confident the facts will clear them of all suspicions that Button?s car was running light in Imola or had a second, concealed, fuel tank. 

Button, caught in a bitter contract tug-of-war between BAR and Williams last year, could still be stripped of his only points so far this season even if the team is cleared of deliberately bending the rules. 

With a performance clause allowing him to join Williams next year if he is not within striking distance of the leader by a given point in the championship, that would only hasten the Briton?s departure. 

The case arose after the FIA decided to appeal against its own race stewards who cleared Button?s car after six hours of post-race scrutinising. 

FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer had earlier informed the stewards that he believed Button was able to run below the minimum weight limit of the 2005 FIA F1 technical regulations. 

The FIA is now expected to present new information to the court that was not available to stewards on the day.

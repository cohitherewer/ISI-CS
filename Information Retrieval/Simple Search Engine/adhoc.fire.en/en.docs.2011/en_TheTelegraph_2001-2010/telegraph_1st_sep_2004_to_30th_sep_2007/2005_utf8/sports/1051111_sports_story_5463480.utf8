 Greg Chappell spends an hour with Baroda players

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Vadodara: Team India coach Greg Chappell and the chairman of the senior national selection committee, Kiran More, are on excellent terms and when the latter requested Chappell to interact with the Baroda players, he was game. 

Chappell spent an hour with not just the Ranji lot, but the U-15s, 17s, 19s and 22s at the Under Deck, one of the basement halls at the Taj Residency, on Thursday evening. A number of coaches, including supremo Balwinder Singh Sandhu, were present as well. 

It was a great session... Greg was fantastic, More (who is also the Baroda Cricket Association joint-secretary) told The Telegraph. 

According to More, Chappell spoke about mental toughness and highlighted what needed to be observed about the opposition both while batting and bowling. Then, bad thoughts shouldnt wipe away everything else on a bad day. 

One-hour sessions cant have a lasting impact, but the colts in particular are still bound to cherish those 60 minutes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Jharkhand lose to Orissa

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Orissa defeated Jharkhand in their first match by five wickets to collect four points in the national one-dayers (East Zone) at the Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake Campus ground Thursday. 

In reply to Jharkhand?s 183 in the allotted 44 overs (the match started one hour 15 minutes late because of poor visibility, so the number of overs was adjusted), the winners achieved the target with 11 balls to go. Jharkhand?s Subrata Ghosh top-scored with 80. 

For Orissa, Sanjay Raul (54) and Niranjan Behera (47) added 96 runs for the fourth wicket to assure victory. At one point, Orissa were 49 for three, losing the wickets of B.B.C.C. Mahapatra, S. S. Das and Rashmi Ranjan Parida, when Behera joined Raul in the middle. 

Jharkhand, after this loss, have a faint chance of advancing to the next round as their first match against Bengal was washed out owing to rains Tuesday. They are now on two points after as many outings while Orissa are four from one match. 

 Brief scores 

Jharkhand 183/9 in 44 ovs (S. Ghosh 80; Behera 4/33). Orissa 186/5 in 42.1 ovs (S. Raul 54). Orissa won by 5 wkts.

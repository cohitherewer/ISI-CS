 Khel Ratna for Rathore

 - Arjuna for Sania Mirza, Deepak Thakur Manoj Kothari gets Dhyan Chand

New Delhi: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who blazed the shooting ranges to fetch the countrys only Olympic medal since Independence, was Wednesday expectedly selected for the countrys highest sporting honour ? the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award ? for the year 2004. 

The 35-year-old Armyman created history by clinching the silver medal in the Athens Olympics, an effort which made him the second shooter to bag the coveted award in the last three years after Anjali Bhagwat jointly won it in 2002. 

The list of awardees did not include any cricketer, reflecting the Indian cricket teams dismal performances last year. 

Teen tennis sensation Sania Mirza, golfer Jyoti Randhawa, athletes J J Shobha and Anil Kumar, hockey player Deepak Thakur and shooter Deepali Deshpande were among the prominent names in the list of 14 Arjuna award winners. 

Arvind Savur (billiards), Sunita Sharma (womens cricket) and Cyrus Poncha (squash) were selected for the Dronacharya awards for 2004, while Manoj Kothari (billiards and snooker) Rajinder Singh jr (hockey) and Maruti Dnyanu Mane Patil (wrestling) won the Dhyanchand award 2005. 

The awards would be given away by President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam at a glittering function at Rashtrapati Bhawan on Monday. 

The awards, which have invariably generated controversies over the years, were finalised by an elite panel chaired by former world billiards champion Geet Sethi. However, the selections for Dronacharya awards were made by a committee headed by G S Randhawa.

 Jerusalem: The memorable Brazil versus England match at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico continued beyond the final whistle, according to the Israeli referee.

 Abraham Klein, who officiated the game in which Brazil beat reigning world champions England 1-0, said he blew for full time but none of the players heard and because it was such a terrific match he allowed play to go on.

 ?Not many people know, but when I blew for time the players didn?t hear the whistle and as it was such a great game I let it continue for a few minutes,? Klein told NRG, the internet site of Israel?s Maariv daily newspaper. 

 Madrid: Real Zaragoza have signed the former Real Madrid keeper Cesar on a free transfer, the club said on Monday.

 The 33-year-old joined Real from Valladolid in 2000 but had to live in the shadow of Spain international Iker Casillas for most of his five years in the capital.

 After being replaced by Casillas due to injury near the end of the Champions League final against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002, Cesar found his opportunities in the first team largely restricted to appearances in the Kings Cup.

 Zaragoza keeper Cesar Lainez has just retired while Luis Garcia is currently being linked with a loan move to Getafe. The future of Raul Valbuena, who spent last season on loan at relegated Albacete, remains unclear. 

 Rome: Italian Serie A side Lecce have named Angelo Gregucci as their new coach, the club announced on its website on Monday.

 Gregucci, 41, whose previous experience includes stints with Serie B sides Venezia and Salernitana and has never coached in the top flight, replaced Zdenek Zeman who quit earlier this month.

 Lecce finished 12th in the 20-team division this season. 

 Paris: International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge says he expects a very tight vote on the host city for the 2012 Summer Games.

 ?There is no big gap between the bidding cities,? Rogge said on Monday. 

 ?Maybe there will be a difference of half a dozen votes. This wont probably be like in 2001, when Beijing won with 56 votes ahead of Toronto with 22 and Paris with 18.?

 Paris are the favourites to win the IOC vote in Singapore on July 6 ahead of London. The other candidates are Madrid, New York and Moscow.

 Rogge said the IOC evaluation commission report, which has been sent to 114 members of the IOC, 100 of whom will be eligible to vote, would be crucial.

 ?Be sure my colleagues read this report. I know it from the discussions I have with them,? he said. 

 New Delhi: The Indian Railways team returned with two medals ? one silver and one bronze ? in its maiden participation in the recent USIC World Railway judo championship held in Sofia, bulgaria.

 Ram Ashrey won the silver in the 73-kg category and Sanjay Kumar claimed bronze in 100 kg during the event which took place from June 6 to 10, according to an official press release here on Monday.

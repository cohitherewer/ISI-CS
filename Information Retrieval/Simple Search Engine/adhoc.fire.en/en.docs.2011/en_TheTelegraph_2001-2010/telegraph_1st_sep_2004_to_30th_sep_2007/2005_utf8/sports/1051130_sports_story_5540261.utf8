 Surya, Sasi in second round

Khanty-Mansiysky (Russia): National champion and GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly registered a second straight victory over US champion Hikaru Nakamura to advance at the World Chess Cup here on Monday (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). 

GM Krishnan Sasikiran also advanced to the second round after outclassing Russian GM Alexei Iljushin in the return game, but former world junior champion P. Harikrishna was forced in to a tie-breaker by Chinese Yu Shaoteng after the latter held the higher-rated Indian for a second consecutive draw. 

There were no big upsets at the top of the table as seeded players like Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, Etienne Bacrot of France, Boris Gelfand of Israel and Alexei Shirov of Spain advanced without much ado. 

Ganguly, playing black, was at his best against Nakamura. He had started off in the first game with a victory and was in no mood to spoil the hard work. Nakamura went for a side line in the Italian game but got nothing as Ganguly maintained the balance coming in to the middle game. The American erred in the middle game and Gangulys bishop spat fire on the king giving little chance. 

Nakamura found temporary solace in the queen exchange and kept on trying for an elusive victory before he was finally pushed to the wall by the Indian. The game lasted 52 moves. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No experimental rules in tri-series

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sri Lanka Cricket chief executive Duleep Mendis has confirmed that the experimental rules will not be followed in the tri-series. 

Talking to The Telegraph from Colombo, he said: The ICC has set August 1 as the starting point, but our tournament begins on July 30 itself. Obviously, we cant have one set of rules for the first two matches and the experimental ones thereafter. So, the existing rules are going to be followed.

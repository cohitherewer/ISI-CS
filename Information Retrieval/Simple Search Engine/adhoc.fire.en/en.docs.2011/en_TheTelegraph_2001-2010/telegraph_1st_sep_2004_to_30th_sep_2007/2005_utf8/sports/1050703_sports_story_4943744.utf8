 Dope test on Armstrong

Noirmoutier (France): Six time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong underwent a surprise dope test at his hotel on Friday afternoon, a control which raised questions as the American was the only rider to be tested. 

Tour organisers confirmed on Saturday, at the start of the 19-km first stage time trial to the island of Noirmoutier, that the American had undergone blood and urine testing in his teams technical area in the car park of the Discovery Channel team hotel in Nantes. 

The Texan was the only rider to be tested a second time, two days after blood testing on all 189 Tour starters. 

Meanwhile, Armstrong began his seventh title chase in style on Saturday by taking second place in the opening time trial.

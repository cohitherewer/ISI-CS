 Pakistan need incisive bowlers to halt Sehwag

 - Dhoni will provide balance and energy to the Indian line-up 

JAVED MIANDAD

 Dhoni won points on all counts 

It is an ominous sign that India are scaling 350 and yet quite a few of their key batsmen have not been in the best of form. Sourav Ganguly has not been among runs from the Test series, while Sachin Tendulkar, one-day specialists Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif haven?t got going in the two ODIs. To the largely two-faced Indian batting line-up of Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid has now been added a third dimension ? that of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

This boy won points on all counts ? technique and temperament, daring and fitness. He withstood some sharp tongue-lashing from the Pakistan bowlers and then unfolded a searing range of strokeplay. 

It was audacious yet judicious. His willingness to hit was matched by his desire to stay long at the crease. And let?s not forget his keeping which was equally brilliant ? the leg-side catch, the near stumpings of Shoaib Malik and Yousuf Youhana, the low catch of Rana Naved-ul Hasan. India have unearthed a serious talent who will add balance and energy to the side. 

In promoting Dhoni to No. 3, India showed their keenness to invest in the future. Pakistan, on the other hand, are still carrying on with its ?life members.? For the eighth match in a row, they failed to find an answer to Sehwag. He?s smashing them at will. He can wristily flick the same ball to midwicket fence which, if his mood takes over, he steers through the vacant thirdman area. 

Mohammad Sami, Rana and Abdul Razzaq are meat and drink to him; their threat to him is no bigger than that of a water-pistol. He?s roasting them over the coals, yet the bowlers are not even seen attempting something different. They come, pay their dues, and turn up at the appointed hour in the next match to do it all over again! 

Yet they are being persisted with. There is no attempt to confront Sehwag with some unknown element. Once he sets the tone and tenor of the innings, on flat wickets such as these, India brook no stopping. 

It?s some wonder that Ganguly and the rest haven?t feasted on the pop-gun attack yet. The Indian captain was out to a straight ball. Just shows when you are going through bad times, even simple deliveries can claim your scalp. Ganguly should either take his chances from the word go or he should block and take singles till his confidence is restored. At the moment, nothing is happening. 

In one-day matches in the subcontinent, with teams packed with batsmen and allrounders, any total is possible and any target is achievable. Only teams which have discipline and wicket-taking bowlers have a future. 

Pakistan need incisive bowlers. At present, nobody seems capable. Danish Kaneria is a must for the next game. So is Shahid Nazir, because Sami bowling to Sehwag is beginning to look like a free lunch. 

The less said about the Pakistan batting, the better. Let?s look at the batsmen and the manner they got out ? Shahid Afridi, Salman Butt, Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez. They won?t be able to see their captain in the eye. 

Razzaq, too, would avoid his captain for the latter held him responsible for his run out. From Razzaq?s point of view, he could have been unsure where the ball had gone and then Inzamam?s reputation as a poor runner is always a consideration for his partners. Still, it?s only basic cricket that you respond to the non-striker?s call if the ball has gone behind the batting crease. Same with shots played to mid-on and mid-off. It is a striker?s call and the non-striker must respond to it. 

How will Butt explain his dismissal when another 30 runs could have had India panting? And what explanation do Pakistan have for muffing the script when their scoring rate was 7.71 runs per over at the 35-over stage. (PTI)

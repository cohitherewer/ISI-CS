 Pollock: Sourav absence wont make difference

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former South African captain Shaun Pollock feels local hero Sourav Gangulys absence wont make a difference on Friday at the Eden when South Africa face India in the fourth ODI. 

It will be as usual, as he (Sourav) has not been there in the Indian team for quite some time, Pollock told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

According to the Proteas allrounder, the match will the first he will play in front of 1 lakh spectators. This will also be his first ODI at the Eden, though he has played a Test here. And he knows it will not be easy to concentrate when a house-full Eden roars for its heroes.

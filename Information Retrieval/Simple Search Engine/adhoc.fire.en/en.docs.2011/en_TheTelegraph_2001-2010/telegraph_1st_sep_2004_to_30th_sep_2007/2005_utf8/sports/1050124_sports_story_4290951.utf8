 Yuvraj wants berth in middle order 

Bangalore: Stylish left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh said on Sunday that he was keen to get back into the Test squad as a middle-order batsman for the upcoming series against Pakistan. 

Yuvraj said he was disappointed at not being given a fair trial after being thrust into the openers? slot against the Australians last year. 

?I felt bad about it. But that?s part and parcel of the selection process. Just have to carry on,? the Punjab batsman said on the sidelines of a prize distribution ceremony. 

?I just have to perform well in the Duleep Trophy and one-day matches. Maybe I will get a chance again.? 

Yuvraj refused to be drawn into a debate over whether he would accept a position at the top in order to get into the Test team. ?I don?t want to comment on that ...,? he said. ?What I want to do is bat in the middle order whenever I get a chance and do my best.? 

When pointed out that the Indian middle order is currently ?packed?, Yuvraj said the middle-order was also packed when he was picked for a Test match against Pakistan. 

?Still, I made my way. So, I think I (can) make my way again.? 

Yuvraj decried the tendency of putting undue pressure on international cricketers to play in domestic matches, pointing out that top players needed rest during a packed calendar. ?If you want your players to give their best in international matches, you have to give them rest,? Yuvraj said. 

?Sachin Tendulkar is now suffering from tennis elbow because he didn?t rest all these years. It?s okay if some international cricketers themselves offer to play a few games,? he said.

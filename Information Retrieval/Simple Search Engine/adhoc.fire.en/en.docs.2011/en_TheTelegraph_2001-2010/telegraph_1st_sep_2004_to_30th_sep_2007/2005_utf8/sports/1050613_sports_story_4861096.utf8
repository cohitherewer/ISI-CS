 Canadian, Russian drivers ideal: Owner

 - Fastest Indian feels it was a bad weekend 

Montreal: In what may not appear as music to the ears of hordes of Narain Karthikeyans supporters, Jordans new owner Alex Shnaider has said that the ideal Grand Prix driver line-up for the team would be a Canadian and a Russian. 

Shnaider, the Toronto-based Russian billionaire who bought the Jordan F1 team this year, met promising Canadian Andrew Ranger recently. The 18-year-old local boy and his agent were at the Grand Prix making contacts with F1 teams, media reports said here Sunday. 

Our doors are open to drivers of all nationalities, Shnaider at the Canadian Grand Prix. 

But obviously, because Im Canadian, Id like to have a Canadian driver just as Id like to have a Russian driver, because of my Russian origins. It would be great to have, he was quoted as saying by the Canadian media. 

The 28-year-old Karthikeyan and Tiago Monteiro of Portugal are currently the F1 drivers for Jordan. 

Karthikeyan, Indias first F1 driver, came under criticism from team manager Colin Kolles who slammed the racer for wrecking the car in the Monaco Grand Prix. Later, though, they are said to have made up. 

Shnaider was born in Russia, moved to Israel and then shifted to Toronto with his family in 1982 when he was 13. He has since built a fortune in metals, shipping and real estate, much of it in former Soviet republics. 

He originally planned to start a new F1 team in 2006, but opted to get a head start by buying Jordan this year. The team will be renamed Midland Racing after his company, Midland Group, in 2006. 

The modest team has spent the first seven races at the back of the grid. We hope to improve the team, said F1s only Canadian team owner. 

We bought Jordan a year earlier in order to learn everything for 2006 when we rebrand the team. Were going to work on a new car for 2006. The chassis will definitely be new and the engine will change because its going to have eight cylinders next year. We will announce shortly who will be the suppliers of the engine. 

Meanwhile, Minardi boss Paul Stoddart has suggested Grand Prix drivers be allowed to change tyres once during a race to reduce the risk of tragedy tarnishing the sport. 

The Australian said Formula Ones rulers should heed the warning from Kimi Raikkonens last lap crash at the Nuerburgring. 

The McLaren driver plunged out, narrowly missing Jenson Buttons BAR, at the European Grand Prix when a flat-spotted tyre caused by locked brakes produced such severe vibrations that the cars suspension failed. 

Under new rules introduced this season, tyre changes have been abolished with drivers having to qualify and race on the same set.

Agartala: Stretching their good work in the ?Test? series to the shorter version of the game, the Indian under-19 cricket team humbled England under-19s by 46 runs in the first one dayer on Tuesday. 

Replying to the hosts? formidable score of 299 for nine, the England under-19 side was bundled out for 253 in 46.4 overs at the Maharaja Bir Bikram Stadium. 

M. Tehlan (51, 64b, 3x4) top scored for the Indians who opted to bat after their new captain Manoj Tewari won the toss in the morning. Tewari made 46. The English colts had a poor start losing two quick wickets before middle order batsmen Moeen Ali (57, 72 balls, 7x4, 2x6), T. Smith (56) and W. Gifford (33, 55 b, 4x4) tried to rescue their side, but in the end the visitors fell well short of the Indian total. 

India?s Gaurav Dhiman, who scored 43 and claimed two wickets, was declared Man of the Match. (PTI)

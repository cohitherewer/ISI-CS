 Fit Woods raring to go

New York: Tiger Woods, back to full fitness after a rib injury, is set to chase a fourth WGC-American Express Championship title at Harding Park Golf Course in San Francisco this week. 

 Im feeling much better, the American said after a practice round. I was able to go at it full-speed and should be 100 percent fit for the meet. 

The US Masters and British Open champion has not played competitive golf since injuring two ribs on his left side during the Presidents Cup team competition against the Internationals two weeks ago. He had treatment and mainly rested until playing his first practice round on Saturday. 

I played through some circumstances that I dont normally have to play (at the Presidents Cup), but the team needed me and I tried to do my best to get points, added Woods, who won the American Express Championship in 1999, 2002 and 2003. 

Since then, Ive been trying to do some light lifting to get stronger and get mobility back in it. Trying to rehab it basically. 

An extra boost this week for Woods is that he will be re-united with his regular caddie Steve Williams. Williams opted out of the Presidents Cup to return to his native New Zealand for the birth of his first child, Jett Baillie. 

Woods, hoping for a record 10th World Golf Championships individual title, returns to a course he played several times as a student. 

It will be fun to see old friends, said the 10-time Major winner, who played two years of college golf at Stanford University. But my main priority is to win the tournament. How can you not get up for tournaments as big as these? (Reuters)

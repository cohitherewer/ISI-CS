St John?s: Shivnarine Chanderpaul?s century became part of a record-equalling run glut on the fifth and last day of the fourth and final Test between South Africa and the West Indies on Tuesday. 

Chanderpaul?s 127 took the West Indies to lunch on 690 for seven in reply to South Africa?s first innings of 588 for six declared. 

It was the West Indies? biggest total against South Africa, surpassing the 543 for five declared they scored in the first Test of the current series in Georgetown. 

The West Indian captain?s innings made the match the fourth Test in which a record seven centuries had been scored. 

The other instances were the Tests between England and Australia in Nottingham in 1938, the West Indies and Australia in Kingston in 1954-55, and South Africa and the West Indies in Cape Town in 2003-04. 

The chances of the record being broken appeared good, as Dwayne Bravo batted solidly for his unbeaten 68. So far the match, which is being played on the flattest of pitches, has yielded 1,278 runs and just 13 wickets. 

A total of 52 centuries have been scored in the 20 Test matches played at the Antigua Recreation Ground. 

The West Indies resumed on 565 for five and gathered runs easily against a South African team secure in the knowledge that they had won the series. 

The visitors clinched the series 2-0 when they won the third test by an innings and 86 runs in Bridgetown. 

Shaun Pollock ended Chanderpaul?s innings when he chased down the left-hander?s drive to deep mid-wicket off occasional mediumpacer AB de Villiers and threw down the stumps at the bowler?s end. 

Chanderpaul, who scored his 13th century, faced 287 balls and hit 13 fours. 

Nine balls later occasional off-spinner Graeme Smith trapped Courtney Browne in front without scoring. 

Smith took over the slow bowling duties from left-arm spinner Nicky Boje, who was advised by a cardiologist not to take the field after suffering from irregular breathing on Monday. 

Earlier, Gayle, who started day IV on 184 as the West Indies resumed at 299 for one, went on to his second Test double century after a half-hour. 

He reached 300 right on tea, when he nudged his 462nd delivery into the on-side. 

The Jamaican left-hander, who had not passed double figures in four previous innings in this series, ended up smacking 37 fours and three sixes in 10 and a half hours. 

He was eventually out to a predictably tired stroke a half-hour after tea. 

Gayle walked off to a rapturous reception from the South African team, and a 6,000-strong crowd at Antigua Recreation Ground.

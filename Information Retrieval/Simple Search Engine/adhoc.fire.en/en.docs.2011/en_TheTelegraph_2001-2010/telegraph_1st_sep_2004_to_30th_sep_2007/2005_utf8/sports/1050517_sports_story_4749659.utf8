The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cash visit set to be an annual affair 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The day Bengal Tennis Associations (BTA) efforts to rope in former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash to provide training to the city-based youngsters started rolling, it was in the back of the associations mind to make his visit an annual affair. But that needed a reciprocation from the other side, which might ultimately have got a final shape on Monday. 

In a closed-door meeting between BTA officials and the Australian on Monday morning, plans were chalked out regarding the Australian greats visit to the BTA every year and the chance of a talent pool from here to train at the Pat Cash Tennis Academy in Gold Coast. 

We had a preliminary discussion that every year 8-10 children will be chosen by Cash himself, and they will be trained in his own academy for a stint of two months, a top BTA official told The Telegraph on Monday. 

Both were learnt to have finalised the programme and were keen to have a tie-up for an indefinite period. We are also trying to send a coach each year to his academy, the official revealed. 

Cash, who is in the city to hold a three-day clinic at the BTA, will also be busy doing his charitable activities, mostly on Thursday. On May 19 (Thursday), he will do some charity works before leaving for Australia, the official said. 

I will try to improve the youngsters skills in terms of body movement and also streamline their sense of position. Once they learn to take the correct position, they can learn to play their best shots, Cash said of his objectives at the BTA.

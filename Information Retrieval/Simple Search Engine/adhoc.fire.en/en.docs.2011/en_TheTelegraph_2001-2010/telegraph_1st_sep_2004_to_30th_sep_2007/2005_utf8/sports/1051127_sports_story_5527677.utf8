London: Arsenal leapt to second in the Premier League when they thumped Blackburn Rovers 3-0 and Wigan Athletic lost 1-2 at home to Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. 

Goals by Francesc Fabregas, Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie gave Arsenal a win that lifted their points tally to 26, eight fewer than champions Chelsea. 

Wigan slipped to third on 25 points after Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids netted his first goal for Spurs in their victory at the JJB Stadium. Spurs are up to fifth on 24 points. 

On a day when fans paid their respects to former Manchester United great George Best, who died on Friday, improving Liverpool won 1-0 at Manchester City, Birmingham won 1-0 at bottom club Sunderland and Aston Villa beat Charlton, also 1-0. 

Some fans observed a minutes silence for Best, others applauded his memory, although it was not well-observed everywhere and the tribute was cut short at the Manchester City-Liverpool match, BBC reported. 

Bests former club United, who are fourth on 24 points, play at West Ham on Sunday. 

Arsenal were not entirely comfortable throughout the first half at Highbury. However a low fourth-minute shot by Spanish midfielder Fabregas and French striker Henrys sliding finish on the stroke of halftime, after he was sent through by Robert Pires, gave them control. 

Dutch substitute Van Persie underscored their victory with a spectacular last-minute strike from an acute angle. 

Robbie Keane strengthened his case for a regular starting place with an eighth-minute goal to put Spurs in front at Wigan and Davids drilled in their second 13 minutes from time.

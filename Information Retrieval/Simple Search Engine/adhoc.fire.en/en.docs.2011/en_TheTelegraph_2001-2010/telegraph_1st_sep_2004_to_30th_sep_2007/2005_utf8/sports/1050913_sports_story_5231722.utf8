 Arjun Atwal finishes 10th 

Vancouver: Indias Arjun Atwal carded a two-under 68 in the final round to finish tenth at the $ 5 m Bell Canadian Open. 

Atwal pocketed amp; 135,000 for the tournament at the Shaughnessy Golf Club course which carried him closer to the million dollar mark in earnings for the season. 

The Indian golfer, lying 29th after the third round, totalled an even par 280 for the four days. 

Atwal had rounds of 72, 67, 73 and 68 on the four days and it was his fourth top-10 finish of the season. 

Mark Calcavecchia survived a shaky finish to post a one-shot victory over fellow-Americans Ben Crane and Ryan Moore for his first title in four years. 

Calcavecchia, who held a four-shot cushion after six holes watched his advantage shrink on the back nine with a pair of bogeys, limping home with a one-over 71. 

Despite carding just a single birdie over his final two rounds, the 1989 British Open champion did just enough to hold on and collect his 12th career title with a winning total of five-under 275. 

One birdie on the weekend and I win the tournament, laughed Calcavecchia, who last tasted victory at the 2001 Phoenix Open. I bet thats never happened.

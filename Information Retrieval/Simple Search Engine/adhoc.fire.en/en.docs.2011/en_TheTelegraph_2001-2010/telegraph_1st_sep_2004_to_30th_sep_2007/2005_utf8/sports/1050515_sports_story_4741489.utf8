 Spectacular may come good 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: The 1,400m Jayachamaraja Wadiyar Cup, which is a terms race here on Sunday, may see a close contest among Coral Gables, River God and Spectacular Quest. However, going by their super mile run recently, in Chennai, it is the S. Ganapathy-ward Spectacular Quest who appears to have slight edge over the two and may win in the hands of B. Prakash.

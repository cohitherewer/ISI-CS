 Gilchrist, Katich lead resurgence

 - ?Keeper-batsman now third on all-time list of maximum sixes 

 Simon Katich after reaching his century against New Zealand in Christchurch on Saturday 

Christchurch: Adam Gilchrist and Simon Katich each hit hundreds in a double-century partnership to leave the first Test between New Zealand and Australia even poised after day three in Christchurch on Saturday. 

Gilchrist smashed 121 off 126 balls and Katich made a patient 118 from 229 deliveries to help Australia get within one run of New Zealand?s first innings total of 433. 

The Kiwis then survived six overs before close of play to reach nine without loss in their second innings, a lead of 10 runs. Captain Stephen Fleming was seven not out and Craig Cumming on two. 

Despite leading Australia out of trouble, Gilchrist said he was disappointed his team did not manage a first innings lead. ?We had the momentum and I felt like I?d opened the door again,? Gilchrist told a news conference. 

New Zealand were on top after dismissing skipper Ricky Ponting (46), Michael Clarke (8) and nightwatchman Jason Gillespie (12) before lunch to leave Australia teetering at 201 for six. 

But Gilchrist and Katich turned things around with a partnership of 212, five runs short of Australia?s all-time record for the seventh wicket. 

Gilchrist set the tone by launching a savage assault on the bowling as Australia added 133 in the second session. He reached his 50 off 52 balls and then completed his 14th Test hundred off 105 deliveries in 154 minutes. 

By the time he was finished, he had smashed 12 fours and six sixes, lifting his Test total of sixes to 74 to overtake Clive Lloyd, Brian Lara and Matthew Hayden and move third on the all-time list behind Chris Cairns (87) and Viv Richards (84). 

?I think we witnessed a pretty special innings today,? New Zealand left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori said. 

?His ability to score quickly and with good batsmanship sets him apart from others. You saw today how devastating he is.? 

Katich was always more cautious than his fellow left-hander, reaching his half-century off 86 balls. 

He crawled to 68 while Gilchrist was in full flow but accelerated before tea, hitting his first six and a string of boundaries to reach his second Test hundred off 172 balls when he flicked Iain O?Brien for two. (Reuters)

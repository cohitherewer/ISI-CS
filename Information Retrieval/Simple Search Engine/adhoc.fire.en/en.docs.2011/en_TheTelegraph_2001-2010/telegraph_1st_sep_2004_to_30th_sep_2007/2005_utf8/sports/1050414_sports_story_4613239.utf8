 Rahul, Lara to clash in Twenty20 match

London: Some of the biggest names in world cricket will take part in a tsunami appeal Twenty20 match between Asia XI and an International XI at The Oval in June 20. This, however, is not the second (officially-sanctioned) fund-raiser between an ICC XI and Asia, which was supposed to be held at the Eden in April, but has been postponed indefinitely. 

The Asia XI will include the likes of Team India members Rahul Dravid, Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble, Sri Lanka seamer Chaminda Vaas and off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, Pakistan quick Mohammed Sami and allrounder Azhar Mahmood, among others. 

For the International XI, players such as Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, West Indies batting great Brian Lara, South African stars Shaun Pollock and Graeme Smith, New Zealand duo Stephen Fleming and Chris Cairns, England?s Graham Thorpe and Mark Butcher will take guard. 

The match is being held at England?s oldest Test venue and the London home of Surrey County Cricket Club, who are hoping it will raise in excess of ?1 million ($1.88 million) for the Oval Cricket Relief Trust. 

Paul Sheldon, Surrey?s chief executive, said: ?having recently been to Sri Lanka, I am aware of not only the need to help those affected by the tsunami, but also to ensure that the money given is spent for the benefit of those who need it most. ?To this end we will donate the money to a cricket aid village named after Surrey in Sri Lanka.?

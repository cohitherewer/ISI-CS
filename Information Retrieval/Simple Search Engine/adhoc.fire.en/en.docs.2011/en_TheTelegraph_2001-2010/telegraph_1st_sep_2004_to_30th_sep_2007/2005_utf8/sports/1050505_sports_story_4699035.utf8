 Sri Lanka approach Moody

Colombo: Sri Lanka seem to have stolen a march over India in appointing a new national cricket coach, with the island nation approaching former Australian Test player Tom Moody to take over from incumbent John Dyson. 

Moody is a contender for the Indian post left vacant after the departure of New Zealand?s John Wright at the end of the season but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was yet to make an announcement as to who have applied. 

Talks were still underway with Moody to take over the job held by Dyson whose term ended last month, officials of the interim committee said Wednesday. (PTI)

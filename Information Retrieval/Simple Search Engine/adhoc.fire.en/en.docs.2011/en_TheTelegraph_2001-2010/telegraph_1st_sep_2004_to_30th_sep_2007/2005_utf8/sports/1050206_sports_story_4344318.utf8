London: Roy Keane reached a personal milestone at Old Trafford on Saturday as Manchester United cut Chelsea?s Premier League lead to eight points with a 2-0 defeat of Birmingham City. 

Cristiano Ronaldo set up United?s inspirational skipper for his 50th goal for the club early in the second half and Wayne Rooney?s late lob sealed an eighth win in nine league games. 

Chelsea can restore their 11-point advantage at home to Manchester City on Sunday. 

Champions Arsenal remain third, 10 points off the pace, after they responded to their demoralising 2-4 defeat by United on Tuesday with an impressive 3-1 victory at Aston Villa, scoring three times in the first half hour. 

Meanwhile, strikers Fernando Morientes and Milan Baros were on target for Liverpool when they boosted their Champions League chances with a 3-1 victory over Fulham while Middlesbrough are also handily placed after a 1-0 home win against Blackburn Rovers. 

Egyptian striker Mido scored twice on his debut to help Tottenham Hotspur come from behind and beat Portsmouth 3-1. 

A late Damien Francis goal gave Norwich City a dramatic 3-2 victory over bottom club West Bromwich Albion in the day?s big relegation battle. Bolton Wanderers were 1-0 winners at Crystal Palace, their seventh straight win. 

Chelsea probe 

Meanwhile, the Premier League has launched an investigation into Chelsea?s alleged illegal approach to arsenal defender Ashley Cole. 

?We are talking to both clubs to decide how to proceed,? Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore told The Sun on Saturday. 

Newspaper reports suggest that Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and chief-executive Peter Kenyon met the England full-back who is still under contract with the Gunners in a London hotel last week.

 Kasparov?s no to unification match

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Rattled by the ?battlefield of chess championship politics?, world No. 1 Garri Kasparov has said he would not take part in the ?unification match? slated to be held in Istanbul in April. 

?It?s not about money or winning the title. It?s about my disillusionment with the process and the others on which it depends,? Kasparov said in a statement on his website. ?In 2002 I dreamed of a legitimate chance to revive ? and reclaim ? the real world championship title. That no longer seems to be possible. Even if by some miracle the match is held and I win, I would bear a great deal of responsibility and still have no opportunity to unify the title. Fide has proven itself incapable of the task while others are unwilling,? he added. 

As per the treaty, Kasparov had to play a match with the then world champion Ruslan Ponomariov and the winner in that match was to play again with the winner of the classical format, Vladimir Kramnik. However, Fide suffered a setback as Ukrainian Ponomariov found more than a few reasons not to play. 

Later it was resolved by Fide that Kasparov will now play the same match vs Rustam Kasimdzhanov, the new world champion and the dates for that match were fixed for January 2005 in Dubai. 

However, again there was trouble for fide as the organisers failed to provide the financial guarantees before the time specified and the match had to be cancelled. 

Kasparov said: ?Perhaps the last straw was watching the Corus tournament in Wijk Aan Zee. I was forced to give up my invitation to play in this event when fide insisted that the match would take place in Dubai on conflicting dates. It breaks my heart to watch such a great event from the sidelines. It hurts me, and I believe chess is poorly served as well,? he said. 

 ?As for unification, I cannot see an avenue to contribute 

further.? (PTI)

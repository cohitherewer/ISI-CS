 Santos want Robinho to respect contract

 Robinho with the Confederations Cup 

Rio de Janeiro: Santos told Robinho to respect his contract on Monday after the Brazil forward said he could not understand why they would not accept a $25 million offer for him from Real Madrid. 

The 21-year-old, rated as one of the worlds most exciting players, became bogged down in controversy last Wednesday after an interview at the Confederations Cup when he bade farewell to Santos fans and said he wanted to play for the Spanish team. 

Santos president Marcelo Teixeira replied that Robinho had a contract until 2008 and any club wanting to buy him beforehand would have to pay a $50 million penalty. 

A furious Teixeira also accused Real of behaving unethically by approaching Robinho without the clubs permission. 

On Monday, Robinho said his mind was already in Spain but the club replied they would only consider letting him leave after the 2006 World Cup. Santos expect Robinho to report for training, said the Brazilian champions in a statement on their website. 

In order to avoid speculation and controversy over whether he will stay at the club, Teixeira reiterated the position of Santos, which is to let him go after the 2006 World Cup as he has been included in the planning for the team for the next championships. 

Santos know Robinhos character and believe he is being badly orientated by people who have a financial interest in the deal being concluded. 

Earlier, Robinho had told a news conference: I dont know if Im going to play for Santos again. But at the moment, Im not in the right frame of mind to play in Brazil. 

Its difficult to say that I dont want to play for Santos any more, but thats how life goes. 

Robinho, who burst on to the scene in 2002 when he helped Peles former club win their first Brazilian championship, said Teixeira had promised he could leave the club after this years Libertadores Cup campaign. 

Santos participation in the competition ended last month when they lost 2-5 on aggregate to Atletico Paranaense in the quarter finals after Robinho missed the second leg because of the Confederations Cup.

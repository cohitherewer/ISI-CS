The Telegraph - Calcutta

 China crush India 3-0

 - FED CUP 

 Hosts fail to win a single set 

 Na Li of China in New Delhi on Friday 

New Delhi: After dominating the first two days, the third day at the Fed Cup turned out to be a reality check for India as they were steamrolled by the Chinese in the final pool A engagement of the Asia-Oceania Zone Group I women?s team tennis meet here on Friday. 

The Chinese stamped their supremacy as Jie Zheng outclassed Rushmi Chakravarthi 6-3, 6-0 and Na Li tamed Shikha Uberoi 6-1, 6-2 at the RK Khanna Stadium. 

Ting Li and Tian Tian Sun, Athens women?s doubles gold medallist, completed the whitewash with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Ankita Bhambri and Rushmi. 

China play the pool B toppers Saturday and the winners go through for the July knockout against a first-round loser of the World Group. 

India?s chances are effectively over, and they remain in group I, having ensured they don?t finish in the bottom two with victories over Singapore and Kazakhstan. 

Their next match in the other pool would be of academic interest. 

Captain Enrico Piperno said he had always considered it a tough ask against top seeded China, particularly without the services of the No. 1 player Sania Mirza. 

India had the advantage of having played on the Centre Court on the first two days whereas China?s earlier matches were confined to the side courts. 

That, however, made little difference. The Chinese craft was on full display as Zheng, broken in the very first game, quickly adjusted to the surface and began dictating terms to Rushmi. A cross court winner by the 21-year-old Chinese followed by a backhand error by Rushmi resulted in a double breakpoint and the latter put her forehand into the net to drop serve in the eighth game. 

The second set was a one way traffic as the chasm in the ranking, nearly 200 places, told. 

Shikha did not have the right start as she could not get her first serves in. A double fault and wide forehand saw her go 15-40 down and she hit another forehand wide to drop serve in the second game. 

Shikha broke back in the next game but that turned out to be the only time when Li was a bit excited.

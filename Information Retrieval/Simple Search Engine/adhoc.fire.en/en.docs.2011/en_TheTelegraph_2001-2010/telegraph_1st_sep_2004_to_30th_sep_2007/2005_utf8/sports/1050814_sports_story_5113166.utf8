Calcutta: In an attempt to shape up well for the season ahead, East Bengal will make an attempt to iron out their weaknesses when they face Mohammedan Sporting in the seasons first derby match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

Mohammedan Sporting, on the other hand, will try their hearts out to snatch a point from their opponents in to dent East Bengals confidence. 

We know they have an experienced and set team since the last few years and we are just about to start afresh, Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said after the practice session on Saturday. 

Bhattacharyas counterpart, Subhas Bhowmick has already taken a resolution to stay away from the limelight and so, his assistant Bikash Panji faced the media. We want to win every match and so this is nothing different. 

IM Vijayan wont have much to prove and may come in as late replacement. East Bengal are likely to play 3-5-2 formation with R. C. Prakash and Syed Rahim in the starting line-up. Apparently, the red-and-golds do not have any injury scare. I will try to play for 15-20 minutes in the second session, Vijayan said. 

For Mohammedan Sporting, Jiten Rai, Malsawma, Amzad Ali Khan and Raman Vijayan are already on the injury list and doubtful for the big day. We havent though of anything apart from putting up a good fight, Bhattacharya said. 

Before the titans of the Maidan clash, Mohammedan Sporting are on nine points after three matches while defending champions are two less after same number of outings. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal have drafted in a new fitness trainer in Ranadeep Moitra after British Peter McNight left on Friday. Moitra, till date was in charge Bengal cricket team has formally informed the CAB about his decision on Saturday.

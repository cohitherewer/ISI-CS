 Monaco: Renault took the wraps off the car they believe can break Ferrari?s stronghold on formula one here.

 The French team was involved in a tense stand-off with BAR for second place in the constructors? championship last season, ultimately having to settle for third spot.

 But in the R25 they are aiming at a far richer harvest in 2005 than last season?s lone win in Monaco.

 ?We?ve said that in 2005 and 2006 we wanted to be fighting for the title. We have to be winning races in the plural and not just the one win we had last year,? said Renault Sport?s president Patrick Faure.

 ARDAF had sponsored local gymnastics for the past two years and the scrapped contract would have been worth 100,000 euros ($130,400) in 2005.

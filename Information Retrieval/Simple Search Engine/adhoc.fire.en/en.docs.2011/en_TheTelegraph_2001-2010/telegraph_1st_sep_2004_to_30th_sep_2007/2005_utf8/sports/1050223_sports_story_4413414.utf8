 Jordan name test driver

London: Dutchman Nicky Pastorelli has been named as a Test driver for the Jordan Formula One team. 

Pastorelli, 21, was the Euro 3000 champion in 2004 and drove a Formula One car for the first time last month with Minardi. 

He tried out for Jordan last week in Barcelona. 

?He?s quick and has demonstrated that he is a winner so we are pleased to be able to bring him on with the opportunity to learn F1 as our test driver,? Jordan managing director Colin Kolles said in a statement on Tuesday. 

Jordan was taken over by Midland Group last month. The team will be renamed Midland in 2006.

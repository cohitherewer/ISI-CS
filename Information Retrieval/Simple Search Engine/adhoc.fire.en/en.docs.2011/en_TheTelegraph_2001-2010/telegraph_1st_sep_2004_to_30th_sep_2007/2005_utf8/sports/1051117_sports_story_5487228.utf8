 SA juggernaut rolls on

 - Yuvraj century in vain; Kallis steers visitors home 

 Jacques Kallis in Hyderabad on Wednesday 

Hyderabad: Yuvraj Singhs brilliant century went in vain as South Africa kept themselves on course for a world record unbeaten run with a thrilling five-wicket victory over India in the first one-dayer Wednesday. 

The hosts recovered from a precarious 35 for five to post a competitive 249 for nine, riding Yuvrajs 122-ball 103, but the South Africans kept their nerves to overhaul the target with seven balls to spare and take a 1-0 lead in the five-match Pepsi Cup. 

South Africa relied on the experienced Jacques Kallis (68 not out) to steer the team home in what turned out to be a close contest while captain Graeme Smith (48 off 35 balls) and Ashley Prince (46) were the other notable contributors. 

The Proteas had the game under control all through the run chase, although they did lose a couple of quick wickets in the middle stages. The Indians, however, could not capitalise on the breakthroughs. Kallis slammed pacer Ajit Agarkar, who was the most successful Indian bowler with two for 55, to the boundary to bring about the victory in style. South Africa made 252 for five in 48.5 overs. 

The visitors now are just two matches away from breaking Australias unbeaten run of 21 matches. They are now unbeaten in 20 matches (17 wins, two no-results and a tie). 

The Indians, coming into the series on the back of a splendid 6-1 series triumph over Sri Lanka, found the going tough right from the word go when they were put in to bat on a juicy track that offered considerable assistance to fast bowlers early on. 

But the wicket eased out as the day progressed and the South African batsmen took full advantage of the conditions. Needing to score at nearly five runs an over, South Africans were off to a flier with Smith leading the charge with some aggressive batting. He slammed nine fours during his quickfire knock to rattle the Indians and provide a good platform to his team to build upon. 

Kallis first put on an 89-run partnership with Ashwell Prince (46) after the team was rocked by the dismissal of Smith and Justin Ontong (11) off two consecutive deliveries.

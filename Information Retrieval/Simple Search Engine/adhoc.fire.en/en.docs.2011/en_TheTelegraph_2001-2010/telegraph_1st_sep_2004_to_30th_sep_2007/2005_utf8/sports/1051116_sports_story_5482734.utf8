 Mysore inter venue cancelled 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Z. Darashahs Super Chieftan may win the Thungabhadra Cup here on Wednesday.

 Our City Turf Correspondent adds: RCTC has notified the cancellation of the inter-state betting of Wednesdays races due to unavoidable circumstances. However, other source in RCTC informed that the betting was cancellation after the RCTC Race Day Staff Association and the race club failed to sort out their dispute pertaining to employment of the staff on inter-venue days. More such cancellations are likely in the coming weeks, said the source.

 Yesterday once more for ladies

London: Teen talent has played second fiddle to know-how at Wimbledon with 29-year-old Lindsay Davenport taking on 25-year-old Venus Williams in an all-American Centre Court showdown on Saturday. 

Between them Davenport and Venus have won seven Grand Slam titles, but the formers last triumph was in 2000 at the Australian Open and the latters the US Open in 2001. 

This time last year, both appeared to be past their best. 

Davenport left the All England Club seriously pondering retirement, while Venus was a shadow of her former self, riddled by injuries and distracted by her outside interests. 

But in the space of 12 months, Davenport has once again taken the world No.1 spot, while Venus has used her love for the Wimbledon grass to re-ignite her passion. 

That passion spawned one of the best performances of her career in the semi-finals when she ousted title-holder Maria Sharapova in a match that saw new levels of hard-hitting in the womens game. 

The way she played against the Russian diva took many observers by surprise, specially those who saw her timid surrender to 15-year-old Bulgarian Sesil Karantatcheva in the French Open just three weeks ago. 

But Venus said she had never lost faith in her own abilities to get back to the top. 

I deserve to be where I am. Its not a surprise, she insisted. Ive learned to never leave it up to the next person to believe in me. I just took a few days off (after losing in Paris) went home and started practising again. Thats all. 

About Davenport, Venus said that they knew each other well and had very similar games. 

Playing her is very similar to playing me, she said. Ive played her a number of times and I am quite experienced when it comes to playing her. 

And if all else fails, Venus said that she can count on sister Serena to boost her confidence. 

Its nice to have some reassurance, specially from people I know. Every step of the way I know she is there with me, she said. 

Davenport and Venus have played each other 26 times since 1997 with Davenport 14-12 ahead including the last four encounters. 

They have played twice in Grand Slam finals, with Venus winning both ? at Wimbledon 2000 and the US Open the same year.

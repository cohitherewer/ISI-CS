 Marion, Tim to run first 100m of season

Raleigh: American sprinter Marion Jones and her boyfriend, world record holder Tim Montgomery, will run their first 100m of the season on the Caribbean island of Martinique on Saturday, their agent said on Thursday. 

?We came to Martinique because they both need individual races, rather than relays, at this stage of the season,? Charles Wells said over the telephone from Martinique. Jones and Montgomery are also considering May meetings in Mexico and Paris and a June competition in Milan, Wells said. 

Jones, the winner of five Olympic medals at the 2000 Games in Sydney but none in Athens last year, has been unimpressive in two races this season. (REUTERS)

Vasco made their intention clear as they went all out for a win from the start and surged ahead in the 22nd minute through a penalty. 

Referee N. Mohan awarded the penalty after Alex Ambrose was brought down by defender Sanjeev Maria. Sidney Rodrigues converted it. 

Fransa fought back and equalised six minutes later when Joseph Ogor scored off a free kick past the rival wall into the net. 

Vasco, playing with determination, again took the lead three minutes before the interval. 

Francis accepting a pass from Menino Fernandes took a rival defender in his stride and almost from the edge of the box essayed a right footer that found the far end of the net.

 Holding predicts clean sweep by Australia

 - Walsh feels West Indies can spring a surprise or two 

 Holding feels the tourists lack the right attitude 

Brisbane: Bowling greats Courtney Walsh and Michael Holding differ on the chances of the West Indies making a fist of their three-Test series against Australia, getting underway here on Thursday. 

One-time wicket-taking world record-holder Walsh believes the West Indies can surprise by winning a Test in Australia, something they havent done since February 1997. 

Definitely, I think the way theyve started (the tour) would have given them a lot of confidence, Walsh said on Tuesday. 

Its the first time this team has played together in about two or three tours because of politics (over sponsorship). 

These guys have a chance to gel here, and I am sure that they are going to play some good consistent cricket. They are up against the best team. It is going to be hard but if you want to make a mark you have got to play against the best. 

Holding, another former West Indies great, disagrees, and forecasts the Caribbean tourists will be drubbed 3-0 by Ricky Pontings side, determined to prove they are still worlds top team after losing the Ashes last September. 

 People do not like to hear the truth, but this group does not possess the right attitude to win Test matches, Holding said this week. 

 I am concerned about their general focus. They arent focused on their game enough. They are not focused on representing the Windies enough. 

The Windies are the last touring team to win a series in Australia, winning 2-1 in 1992-93, but they were spanked 5-0 by the Australians on their last visit in 2000-01. 

The one-time powerhouses have fallen on hard times and are looking to recapture lost glories under the coaching of Australian Bennett King, who went to the Caribbean last year with the pedigree of coaching Queensland and the Australian Cricket Academy. 

I think you will see a change in their fortunes sometime, but certainly its quite young in their development, King said this week. 

The Windies had the better of Queensland in the warm-up four-day tour match here last weekend. 

Marlon Samuels was the stand-out with his highest first-class score of 257 and best return of five wickets with his off-spinners. 

The Caribbeans have brought along an armoury of hostile quicks, led by Jermaine Lawson (50 wickets in 12 Tests at 27.84), Fidel Edwards (45 wickets in 17 Tests) and Tino Best (26 wickets in 12 Tests). 

Walsh likes what he sees in 23-year old Edwards from Barbados. 

 He could be a handful if he can get things right, Walsh said. He swings the ball away and hes got some good pace. 

Australia will have a Test debutant this week when Mike Hussey opens the innings with Matthew Hayden, after Justin Langer succumbed to a broken rib. 

No Australian has made more first-class runs (15,313 runs at 52.8) before making the Test debut. 

 The 30-year old left-hander has also scored 494 runs at 123.50 in 18 one-day Internationals, and averaged 55.46 in Australias Sheffield Shield last season. 

 I have been through heaps and all the enjoyable hard work is worth it in the long run, Hussey said on Tuesday. 

 I have been dreaming about this since I was a little kid, and hopefully it will all sink in once I have been presented with that baggy green cap.

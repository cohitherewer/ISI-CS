The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Zimbabwean side shot out for 94

Mumbai: Haryana duo Joginder Sharma and Amit Mishra helped North Zone bundle out Zimbabwe Board Presidents XI for 94 on the opening day of their Duleep Trophy league match here on Thursday. 

Medium-pacer Joginder, who made the XI after Vikram Raj Vir Singh pulled out with a foot injury, returned dream figures of six for 21 in 12 overs at the Wankhede Stadium. Leggie Mishra mopped up the tail with four for 16. 

The Zimbabwe innings lasted 43.2 overs and 188 minutes. 

The match started after lunch due to wet ground conditions following unseasonal overnight thundershowers. 

North were 62 without loss at stumps on Day I. 

In Surat, a strokeful century by opener Amit Pagnis (142 with 25 fours) and his 222-run partnership for the second wicket with Jyoti Yadav (87 with nine fours) helped Central Zone post 299 for three on the opening day of their tie against South Zone. 

SUMMARISED SCORES 

 In Mumbai: Zimbabwe Board XI 94 (Charles Coventry 27; J. Sharma 6/21, A. Mishra 4/16). North Zone 62/0 (S. Dhawan batting 33, R. Ricky batting 27).

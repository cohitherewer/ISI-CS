 R amp;A opens the door for women

 Michelle Wie is eligible to enter qualifying after tying 3rd at Womens British Open 

London: In a ground-breaking move, British Open organisers have paved the way for women to be able to qualify for next years tournament at Royal Liverpool. 

Women were previously barred from competing in the worlds oldest championship but the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R amp;A) said on Thursday that it would change the entry criteria. 

Our championship committee pledged to review entry conditions and to assess how women golfers might compete on equal terms with men for a place in the Open, R amp;A chief executive Peter Dawson said in a statement. 

As a result, I am delighted that a qualification route has now been established for the best women players to gain access to the championship, competing alongside men on the same courses and from the same tees. 

Last year, the R amp;A said it was not opposed to the idea of women playing in the Open and that teenage prodigy Michelle Wie could have booked her place in the field for St Andrews had she won the PGA Tours John Deere Classic in July. 

Wie, who turned 16 on Tuesday and is making her debut as a professional at this weeks Samsung World Championship in California, is now eligible to enter Open regional qualifying after tying for third at the Womens British Open in July. Dawson has an open mind on whether she and her other eligible peers will decide to take advantage.

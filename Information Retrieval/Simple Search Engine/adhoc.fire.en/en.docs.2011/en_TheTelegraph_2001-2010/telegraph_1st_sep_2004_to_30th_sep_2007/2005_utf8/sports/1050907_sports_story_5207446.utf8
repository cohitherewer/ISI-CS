Harare: Its another day and another tournament, but the script remains the same. 

Team India continued their sequence of defeats in finals as New Zealand, riding high on Nathan Astles scintillating century, clinched the Videocon Cup with a comfortable six-wicket victory here on Tuesday. 

The right-handed Astle cracked an unbeaten 115 as the Black Caps overhauled the target of 277 with ease at the Harare Sports Club. 

A total of 276 looks flattering, but doesnt quite reflect the failure of Indian batsmen, who lost the plot in the middle overs and fell short of the target which they should have achieved after a very good start. 

New Zealand coasted home in 48.1 overs, built around the 15th one-day International century by Astle, who shared a 121-run first-wicket stand with Stephen Fleming (61) off only 18-odd overs. 

The New Zealand captain struck five fours in Irfan Pathans third over and Astle creamed three off Ajit Agarkar at the other end as New Zealand galloped to 50 in the first five overs. 

The brakes were applied when spinners came in from the other end. Virender Sehwag met with two successes in his second over. 

Fleming offered a return catch to him and then Sehwag won a leg before shout against Hamish Marshall (3). 

But Sehwag was then taken off the attack as Indians sought to utilise the third power play of five overs. Sehwag was brought back and met with his third success as Scott Styris (37 off 41 balls) was stumped yards down the track. 

Earlier, New Zealand inched back from a horrendous start to restrict India to 276. 

Souravs side had been off to a rollicking start and were 155 for one in the 25th over before losing the plot. 

Sehwag (75) and Sourav (31) had put on 72 from a mere 13-odd overs and Mohammed Kaif (93 not out) carried on the good work. A total of 300-plus was there for the taking. 

It is when Daniel Vettori stepped in. He was the chief tormentor, conceding a mere 35 runs off his 10 overs and picking up two vital wickets in three deliveries. 

Sehwag was in absolute command and had the bowlers at his mercy when he mistimed a chip to be caught at mid-off by Lou Vincent. 

Dravid was deceived by an armer and was caught plumb in front. 

Sourav had a lot of trouble in negotiating Bond and got off the mark on his 12th delivery before slashing a few hits over the off-side for boundaries. Four of his boundaries came off Mills and one off Oram before he tamely guided an innocuous delivery to the fielder at point region. 

Sehwag made 75 for 65 balls with 12 fours and a six while Souravs 31 took him 44 balls and included five fours. 

Kaif, in excellent touch in this series, played a sumptuous knock in which he picked up the gaps with precision. 

Unfortunately, he didnt receive much support from the other end. 

His innings from 110 balls contained eight fours.

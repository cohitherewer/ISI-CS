Toronto: Tiger Woods regained the world No. 1 ranking after winning a gripping duel with Phil Mickelson to register a one-stroke victory at the Doral Open on Sunday. 

Trailing Mickelson by two shots at the start of play, Woods mounted one of his patented charges to card a final round six-under 66 at Miami?s Doral Resort for a 24-under 264 total. 

The victory was Woods? second of the season and returned the 29-year-old American to the top of the rankings, ending Vijai Singh?s 26-week reign as No. 1. 

Woods had held top spot for a record 264 consecutive weeks before being dethroned by the Fijian last September. 

The triumph earned Woods $990,000 and a high-performance sports car which he said he would give to caddie Steve Williams, who is still recovering from injuries he sustained in a motor racing accident in January in New Zealand. 

?I just felt like had to keep making birdies, pars just weren?t going to get it done,? said Woods, who broke the 72 hole tournament record of 265 held by Jim Furyk and Greg Norman. 

?It?s nice to come from behind like this. Starting out the day, Phil had all the pressure on him. He?s got a two shot lead and he?s been playing all year, everyone was kind of looking at him to go out and win the tournament. 

?But he was going to have to try and earn this, I?m going to make him earn it. He?s going to have to play really and I went out there and played really well myself.? 

Trailing by a single shot as they made the turn, Woods turned up the heat, catching Mickelson with a birdie on 10, then shocking the US Masters champion with an eagle on the par five 12th to surge two clear. 

Mickelson, however, demonstrated plenty of grit of his own, holing back-to-back birdies on 13 and 14 to pull level and set the stage for a dramatic finish.

 Beckham may launch Asian academies

Los Angeles: David Beckham hopes to launch an Asian version of the David Beckham Academy by 2007, a sister facility of his first two football schools in London and Los Angeles. 

We are looking at possibly two more (academies) in Asia next year or the year after, Beckham said during a news conference in Los Angeles Thursday to unveil plans for the California school. 

Beckham did not go into details about his Asia plans but it is clear he has global aspirations for his football academies. Asked what Asian countries they are targeting, his publicist Simon Oliveira would only say, we are looking at the usual suspects including China. 

 The 30-year-old Beckham launched plans for his Los Angeles Academy at the Home Depot Center. The $ 150 million stadium is located just 10 miles southeast of downtown, and with flashbulbs popping, the circus atmosphere was intensified by a swarm of Hollywood paparazzi in attendance. 

Beckham said he is investing over $ 500,000 of his own money into his soccer school here, and is paying for the tuition of the first 300 children at $ 500 each. Asked if he would play for an English club again, he said: I am happy in Real Madrid. I have a long-term contract there. I wont go to play in England again. 

Beckham also joined those calling for Liverpool to be allowed to enter next seasons European Champions League. They way theyve played, theyve won the Champions League so of course they should be in it next year, he said. 

Liverpool won the Champions League with a dramatic come-from-behind victory against AC Milan last week but missed out on automatic qualification for next season after finishing fifth in Englands Premier League when only the top four go through. 

European body Uefa is expected to discuss whether to allow a fifth English team in next season at its executive committee meeting in Manchester on June 17.

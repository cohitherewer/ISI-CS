 India sent 7 overaged players: Batra

New Delhi: Seven players who represented India in the just-concluded Junior World Cup, were over the maximum age limit for the mega event, Indian Hockey Federation senior vice-president Narinder Batra alleged Saturday. 

Batra said, V. S. Vinay, Vivek Gupta, Vickram Kanth, Navpreet Singh, Hari Prasad, Senthil Kumar and Ajitesh Roy were all over 21, the maximum age for players in the Junior World Cup. 

In a letter to IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran, Batra said: This manipulation in the age of players was done on instructions of senior IHF officials... 

Batra claimed that while Vinay was 24 and-a-half years old, Hari Prasad was 23, Vivek Gupta and Vickram Kanth were over 22 each. Navpreet was 21 years two months old and Ajitesh was almost 22. 

Batra said since there were two players with the name of Senthil Kumar ? R. Senthil Kumar and G. Senthil Kumar ? he was not sure which one took part in the World Cup. But, he claimed, both were overaged. (PTI)

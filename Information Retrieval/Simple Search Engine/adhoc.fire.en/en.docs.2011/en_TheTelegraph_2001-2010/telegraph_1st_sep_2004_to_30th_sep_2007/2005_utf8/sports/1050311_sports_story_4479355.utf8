 Shoaib may miss entire tour: Report

Karachi: Speedster Shoaib Akhtar, recuperating from a hamstring injury, expressed doubts that he might miss the entire tour of India as he would need time to be match-fit. 

?I don?t think I would be able to play the one-day series. Although I am feeling a little better, my hamstring is still very weak and doctor has advised complete rest before I start bowling even in the nets,? Shoaib was quoted as saying in a local daily Thursday. 

Reacting to reports that he would be able to join the Pakistan team for the third and final Test and one-day series later, he said: ?This is just a rumour. I do not think I would be able to play even in one-dayers, and participating in the last Test is totally out of question?. 

Pakistan manager Saleem Altaf was earlier quoted as saying that there was a possibility of Shoaib joining the team during the Test series. 

?I am keeping a regular tab on Shoaib?s progress in Lahore. The report is that his injury has healed and now the only thing remaining is that he passes a fitness test before he can join the team,? Altaf had said. 

But Shoaib clarified that although he was feeling better, he required another three weeks before he could resume bowling at the nets. 

?Shoaib needs another 20 days to startbowling at the nets and he would surely be needing more time to get back into match fitness,? the paper said without identifying the doctor.

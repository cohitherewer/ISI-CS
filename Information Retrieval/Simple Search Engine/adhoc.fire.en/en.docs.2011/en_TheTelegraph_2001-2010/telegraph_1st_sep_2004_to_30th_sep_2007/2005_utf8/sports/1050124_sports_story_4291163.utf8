 Tiger atop leaderboard

New York: Tiger Woods charged into a share of the third round lead at the Buick Invitational on Saturday, carding birdies on two of his opening five holes before play was suspended due to darkness. 

As fog rolled in off the Pacific disrupting play at California?s Torrey Pines Country Club for a second consecutive day, Woods kept his focus on a difficult day to join overnight leader US Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman at 14-under-par. 

Despite completing just three holes of his third round, Lehman?s three-shot advantage had disappeared with a bogey on his third hole. 

Australia?s Peter Lonard and Britain?s Luke Donald sit three shots back at 11-under with South Africa?s Ernie Els, Dudley Hart and Kevin Sutherland one stroke further adrift. 

Due to two delays created by fog, none of the field was able to finish their third rounds, which will be completed on Sunday morning, followed by the final round. 

A brief break in the haze had allowed organisers to complete the second round on Saturday morning and start third round play with officials sending golfers off both the first and 10th tees. 

However, before the first players had completed five holes the foghorn sounded, sending golfers back to the clubhouse for the first time. 

?I?m hitting well, stroking it well, you just have to hope the fog goes away,? said Lehman, searching for his first Tour win in almost five years. 

?It?s pretty strange but what can you do, just wait around and hope for the best.? 

Earlier, Woods, a two-time winner here, closed the final hole of his second round in style, carding a birdie to finish at nine-under 63. 

Following yet another delay, the world No. 2, began his third round in spectacular fashion with birdies on his first two holes followed by three straight pars. 

After struggling through his opening two rounds, world No. 1 Vijai Singh began to display the early season form that carried him to victory at the Sony Open last weekend, going four-under through 12 holes to move into contention at eight-under. 

However, three-time winner Phil Mickelson, who is making his season debut here, continued to have trouble finding his game and stumbled to four-over-par through 11 holes.

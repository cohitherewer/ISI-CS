 Coach urges United to sow doubt in Chelsea minds

 - Players owe Ferguson and supporters some massively improved displays 

HENRY WINTER

 Ferguson feels its not the biggest game weve ever played 

From Croesus to crisis, debt now defines Manchester United. A footballing institution once associated with great riches owes more than ?500 million following the Glazers unpopular take-over. Away from the boardroom, down in the dressing room, another debt damages Old Trafford: Uniteds players owe their manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, and their supporters some massively improved displays, starting against Chelsea on Sunday. 

After the shock of defeats to Middlesbrough and Lille and the electric shock of Roy Keanes punditry, Ferguson was keen to exude his usual defiance Friday. Striding into an ante-chamber at the Carrington training complex that his accumulation of 27 trophies helped to pay for, the manager who had just endured The Week From Hell looked like he had just had The Week In Hawaii. 

Ferguson sounded almost buoyant. No surprise. The odds on the driven Scot running up the white flag lie on a par with Keane getting a call from MUTV to do Sundays commentary. No chance. We know its a big game, but Christ we have had big games in the past, Ferguson stressed. Its not the biggest game weve ever played. 

True, Sundays task is neither the European Cup final of 1999 nor the 1990 FA Cup final replay, but it will decide whether murmurings of dissent on the terraces explode into a full rebellion against Ferguson and underachieving players such as Rio Ferdinand and Darren Fletcher. 

We need the crowd behind us, Ferguson observed. Stretford Enders, legitimately sceptical, will first need convincing of the players commitment. Chelsea boast three elements that once characterised the hosts: unity, money and leadership. If Ferdinand is worth ?100,000 a week, what value John Terry? If the limited Fletcher is considered a starting option at a famous club, what does that make Frank Lampard? Ferguson understands the challenge posed by Jose Mourinhos men. 

We are playing the best team in the country: worthy winners of the league last year and worthy leaders this year, the United manager said. 

Their form has been exceptional. The question is, can we usurp Chelsea and make them think for a bit? Deep down, I know we have the ability to do it ? and I think everyone else does, too. Its the one chance we have of saying to the rest of the league: It can be done. We can beat Chelsea. 

At the moment they are undefeated for 40 games. Chelseas consistency is probably better than ours way back in the Nineties. Hunger is vital. They have the drive and the right manager to drive them on. 

Ferguson remembers with particular pleasure preventing Arsenal reaching a 50-game unbeaten run last season. There are some similarities between the two games but this Chelsea side is made of much sterner stuff, he said. They are a very powerful team and very committed to defending. 

But he added: Ability-wise, we have the capacity to win the game, theres no question about that. 

Much, probably too much, depends on Wayne Rooney, though. If only players like Ferdinand and Fletcher possessed the boldness of Rooney or Ferguson, United wouldnt be in such a mess. Yet Ferguson refused to apportion any blame for recent lapses. 

My stance remains unchanged, unequivocal, unremitting: I wont be criticising anyone in this club. Anything we do will remain indoors. 

He refused to censure Keane or off-form youngsters like Fletcher and Kieran Richardson. None of them has deserted his post, thats for sure, Ferguson said of the kids, although he has sent Liam Miller on loan to Leeds United, where he could get an interesting reception. 

Where Ferguson himself deserves criticism is in his belief that he could build a top-class midfield out of an ageing Keane, an inexperienced Richardson and an inadequate Fletcher and Miller, plus Paul Scholes on a sad decline and Alan Smith ill-suited to central midfield. 

He could be permitted a wistful glance at Michael Essien on Sunday, having watched the dynamic African during his Lyon days. Chelsea stepped in, offering more money to club and player. Game over. 

If we are doing something we have to be really quick and decisive before Chelsea find out about it, Ferguson sighed. They are quite happy just to buy someone to keep Arsenal and ourselves away from them. They would do that, because they have that much money. Im not jealous, although I wouldnt mind that money myself. 

Our club is different. If we had that amount of money, we might not use it as much anyway. Its still important to have a healthy youth system. We have that. 

There are some issues [about Chelsea off the field] that concern not me but everyone else in the world, Ferguson said, thinking of the impact of Roman Abramovichs billions. The part surrounding Joses club is different but his management skills have been good for the game, refreshing. I like him. 

We have to get used to Joses public observations. Its amusing. He has opinions to make. Some I agree with, some I dont. I dont think it has done Chelsea any harm. He has given Chelsea a great profile, a profile they never had. Jose is the type who will come in and have a drink with you after the game, no matter what the result. I appreciate that. 

Ferguson passionately hopes Mourinho will taste rare defeat in the Red house. United have to start claiming some points and reclaiming some pride in the Premiership. Ferguson understands, concluding: Theres a duty for this club to be up there all the time.

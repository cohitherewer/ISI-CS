 United restore pride with draw vs Chelsea

London: Manchester United restored some of their battered pride as they held rampant Premier League leaders Chelsea to a 0-0 draw in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. 

United manager Alex Ferguson issued a rare apology on Saturday after he sent out a second string side that was held to an embarrassing 0-0 draw by minor league Exeter City in the FA Cup third round at Old Trafford. 

But there was little chance of a repeat of that insipid performance as Ferguson recalled Wayne Rooney and fit-again Louis Saha upfront and restored Cristiano Ronaldo to the right flank along with several other first-choice players. 

Rooney twice went close to giving United the lead in a pulsating first half but it was Chelsea, missing suspended Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who carved out the best chances with dangerous forward Damien Duff and midfielder Joe Cole in form. 

Duff fired one early dipping shot narrowly over while Frank Lampard, back after serving a one-match suspension, went the wrong side of the post with a glancing header midway through the opening period. 

Duff was involved again minutes later when his volley was turned into the net by Eidur Gudjohnsen only for the Icelandic forward?s effort to be ruled out for offside. 

Mourinho threw on Didier Drogba for Gudjohnsen at halftime and the Ivory Coast striker almost broke the deadlock with a deflected shot that keeper Tim Howard struggled to keep out. 

Lampard then looked to have broken through but his low shot was cleared off the line by United?s Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze. 

Mourinho added more firepower in the 67th minute when Mateja Kezman replaced limping midfielder Tiago but United, who have not lost at the semi-final stage of a domestic cup competition for 30 years, refused to buckle. 

Substitute Jiri Jarosik almost won it for the hosts with seven minutes remaining but this time United skipper Phil Neville was on hand to deflect his shot over. 

In the other semi-final first leg, Liverpool beat Watford 1-0. The final will be at the Millennium Stadium on February 27. 

 King?s Cup 

Primera Liga sides Athletic Bilbao and Numancia suffered narrow defeats against lower ranked opponents in the first legs of their third round King?s Cup ties on Wednesday. 

Bilbao, who have won the competition 23 times, slumped to a 1-2 defeat away to third division Lanzarote, while Primera Liga basement side Numancia were beaten 0-1 at second division promotion hopefuls Elche. 

In the only all-Primera Liga tie of the round Osasuna put themselves on course for a place in the quarter-finals with a 2-0 win over Getafe. 

Atletico Madrid bounced back from their 3-0 defeat against city rivals Real Madrid in the league on Sunday with a 3-1 win over third division Lorca. Atletico took the lead on the stroke of halftime when midfielder Antonio Lopez netted with a superbly struck free kick from 22 metres out, but their modest opponents equalised with an even better goal 18 minutes after the break. 

The visitors responded by stepping up a gear and regained the lead 10 minutes before time when defender Pablo Ibanez fired in a powerful header from a corner. 

New signing Jesper Gronkjaer capped an impressive performance by setting up his sides final goal with a perfect pass to the feet of striker Braulio to finish off from close range to make it 3-1 three minutes from time. 

Real Betis beat Mirandes by the same scoreline, but were given a scare when the third division side took the lead in the first minute of the second half with a spectacular free kick from skipper Rodri. 

The Andalucians hit back with quick-fire goals from Edu and Ricardo Oliveira midway through the second half before running out 3-1 winners.

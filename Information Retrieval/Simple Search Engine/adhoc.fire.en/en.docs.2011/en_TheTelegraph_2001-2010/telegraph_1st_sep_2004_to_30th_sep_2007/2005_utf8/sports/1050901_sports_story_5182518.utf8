The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lanka win by 88 runs

 - FIRST ODI vs BANGLA 

 Upul Tharanga on way to 60 on Wednesday 

Colombo: Upul Tharanga stroked his maiden ODI half-century and seam bowler Farveez Mahroof claimed three wickets as Sri Lanka scored a decisive 88-run win over Bangladesh in the first one-day International on Wednesday. 

Sri Lanka was restricted to a competitive 269 after Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar won the toss and elected to field first at an overcast Sinhalese Sports Club. 

Bangladesh could only muster 181 for nine wickets in reply, with only opening batsman Shahriar Nafees offering some resistance to Sri Lankas bowling attack with a 59-ball 39.

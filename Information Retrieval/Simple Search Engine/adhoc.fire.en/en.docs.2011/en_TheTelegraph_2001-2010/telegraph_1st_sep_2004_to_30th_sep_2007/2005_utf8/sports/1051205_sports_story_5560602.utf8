The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rain stops, but still no action

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Madras Rain Factory is how umpire Daryl Harper has described Cyclone Baazs effect on the city in his website cricketump.com. The Australian files daily bulletins and the second days action was thus summed up in the heading. 

Little did he imagine that the third day of the series would be no different. Torrential rain overnight meant there was no chance of play and umpires Harper and Mark Benson along with Match Referee Clive Lloyd called off the proceedings as early as 8.30 am. 

The Indians never came to the ground but Sri Lankan coach Tom Moody and Muttiah Muralidharan were present when the decision was taken. The soggy outfield needed at least four hours of bright sunshine and the umpires decided not to delay the inevitable. 

Its still rather wet. The umpires made another visit to the ground in the afternoon and found very little change in the conditions. Lets see how it goes, provided there is no more rain, Lloyd told The Telegraph. 

The slushes in the mid-wicket and cover regions are of major concern. The sun played peek-a-boo throughout the day as the groundsmen removed the muck before scattering sand on the affected areas. 

Curator K. Parthasarathy felt covering the entire ground wasnt feasible. Almost three-fourths of the ground is covered at the Chepauk. But the danger of covering it is that the water that seeps in takes longer time to evaporate. 

Lloyd felt it was up to the organisers to decide on covering the whole area. 

There has been no rain on Sunday, but it will be tough to start the match before lunch on the fourth day. The sweating on the pitch under the covers would take sometime to dry up. 

The Indians enjoyed an off-day while the Sri Lankans had to remain content with a session at the gym.

 Warne hopes to tide over crisis

 Shane Warne, who feels England should play Pietersen, 

in London on Tuesday

London: Shane Warne insists that problems in his personal life will have no bearing on his cricket or Australias chances of retaining the Ashes. 

Last month, the legendary leg-spinner announced he was separating from wife Simone, the mother of his three children, following reports in a British tabloid of an affair with a student. 

Its obviously been a tough time for me, I dont think thats any secret, Warne told newsmen at Australias team hotel on Wednesday. 

However, the 35-year-old Warne added: My major focus is on the Ashes series. One of my strengths as a cricketer over the years has been the ability to overcome any obstacles. Whatevers been put in front of me, I think Ive always responded pretty well. My focus at the moment is on the Ashes starting on July 21 (at Lords). 

He stressed he and his wife were still on speaking terms. 

Im very lucky actually. Were still very good friends. We speak every day or just about, and I speak to the children every day, so Im sure she will be very supportive. 

Warne has had plenty of experience in dealing with controversial aspects of his off-field life. 

Asked how he coped, Warne ruefully replied: Too much practice probably, to be perfectly honest. 

Whatever happens in your life you have to deal with it. Theres no use labouring on an issue or dragging your behind around the floor. You have to get up. Those sort of things make you stronger, everything youve been through in your life whether it be on or off the field. 

It all adds to make you a stronger person. Its disappointing and its tough. But my job now is to play the best cricket I possibly can. Ive got no doubt I can do that. 

On the upcoming series with England, Warne said he had never played in a losing Ashes series. But he acknowledged this England team did pose a threat for the first time since 1989. This time, England have got a chance because they have some match-winners, which I dont think they have had over the years. 

If Kevin Pietersen plays, you probably have three or four match-winners in their side. I expect him to play in the Test series. I think Kevin Pietersen should play. They should make room for him. He is the most destructive player in England, him and (allrounder) Andrew Flintoff. (Agencies)

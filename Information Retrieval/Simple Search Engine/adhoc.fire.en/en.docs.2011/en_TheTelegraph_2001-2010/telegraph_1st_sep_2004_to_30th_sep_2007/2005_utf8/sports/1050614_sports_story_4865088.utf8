 IN THE CITY

 The CAB will felicitate the two Best Players ? Manoj Tewari (under-19) and Sayan Sekhar Mondal (under-15) ? adjudged so by the BCCI for their performance in the 2004-05 season. ?Since they have emerged the best in the country, we should felicitate them and encourage them,? a top official of the CAB said on Monday. 

 According to the official, it is a rare for the state to have two of its players chosen for the Madhavrao Scindia Trophy. ?The felicitation may take place during the annual prize distribution ceremony slated for July-end,? he said. 

 The Ambar Roy Sub-junior tournament match between Ashok Malhotra CA and Dadu Memorial, Siliguri CCC was stopped due to rain after the Siliguri team had been bundled out for 178 at the Eden on Monday. The match continues Tuesday.

 Mahindra United players ? Jatin Singh Bist, Naseem Akhtar and Debabrata Roy signed on the dotted lines of the inter-state transfers to play for East Bengal this season. Another Mahindra footballer, Dipendu Biswas, also sought inter-state transfer to play for Mohun Bagan.

 Sania in 2nd round

Bangkok: Indian tennis sensation Sania Mirza breezed into the second round of the $200,000 WTA Thailand Open here on Tuesday after beating Slovakias Henrieta Nagyova 6-1, 4-6, 6-0. 

Seeded fifth, the 18-year-old Indian allowed her unseeded rival to stretch into the third set after losing concentration in the second. 

Sania, now ranked 31 in the world, had made it to the semi-finals of the Japan Open last week where she lost to third seed Tatiana Golovin of France 2-6, 4-6.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Arshad back after 5 years

Karachi: Young opener Taufeeq Umar and veteran spinner Arshad Khan were Saturday named in a 16-member Pakistan Test squad for the high-profile series against India. 

There were hardly any surprises as Pakistan selectors decided to more or less retain the squad that was whitewashed 0-3 in the recent Test series against Australia. 

The other change was that Younis Khan was named the vice-captain in place of Yousuf Youhana. 

[In fact, The Telegraph had reported on February 4 that Youhana could lose the post and that Younis was one of the top contenders to replace him.] 

Umar, 22, last played for Pakistan against India in Rawalpindi while 34-year-old Arshad Khan?s previous appearance in a Test was against England in November 2000. 

Paceman Mohammed Sami and Mohammed Khalil were retained in the squad after they passed fitness tests in the morning that were conducted by coach Bob Woolmer and foreign trainers Daryl Lifson, Murray Stevenson and Grant Compton. 

?We have basically stuck to the policy of consistency,? chairman of selectors Wasim Bari said. 

 Meanwhile, the PCB has delayed the announcement of 

 Waqar Younis as their bowling coach until next week. A PCB 

 spokesman said from Lahore that in principle, it has been 

 agreed that Waqar will be the bowling coach ?but the modalities 

 of the contract have yet to be discussed and finalised.?

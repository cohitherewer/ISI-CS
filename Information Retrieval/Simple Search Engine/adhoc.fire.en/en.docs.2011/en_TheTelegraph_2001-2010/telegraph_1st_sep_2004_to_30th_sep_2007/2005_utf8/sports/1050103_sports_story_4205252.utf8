 Martyn voted best

Sydney: Damien Martyn was Sunday announced as the winner of the McGilvray medal as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation?s Test cricketer of the year. Martyn had an outstanding year in 2004 scoring 1,353 Test runs at an average of 56.37 with six centuries. 

Martyn was presented with the medal by Australian Prime Minister John Howard after the opening day?s play in the third and final Test against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

The McGilvray medal, voted by a panel of ABC radio commentators, honours Alan McGilvray, the voice of cricket on ABC radio for more than 50 years. (Reuters)

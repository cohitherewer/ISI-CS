 Pulsating 3-2 win for world champions

 - Argentina vs mexico semi-final today 

 Juan Roman Riquelme has been in devastating form 

Nuremberg: World champions Brazil beat Germany 3-2 on Saturday in the Confederations Cup. 

Brazil led their semi-final three times with two goals by Adriano (21st and 76th) and a 43rd-minute penalty from Ronaldinho. 

Germany equalised twice through Lukas Podolski (23rd) and Michael Ballack, who scored with a penalty in first-half stoppage time. 

Meanwhile, in Hanover, captain Rafael Marquez will make a welcome return on Sunday when Mexico, shaken by a doping case involving two of their players, face Argentina in Hanover for a place in the Confederations Cup final. 

World soccers governing body Fifa says it has been informed by Mexico that Aaron Galindo and Salvador Carmona were sent home earlier this week after testing positive in doping controls that took place before the start of the tournament. 

A Fifa spokesman could not say what banned substance had been found in the tests. Fifa said it had now deleted the names from its players lists. 

Only these names have been struck off and the decision has no retroactive effect, Fifa said, confirming Mexicos place in the Confederation Cup semi-finals was not under threat. 

The absence of the Cruz Azul duo deprives Mexico of two more defenders when they battle a powerful Argentina side for the right to take on Brazil. 

Argentina scored eight goals in three matches to finish runners-up to Germany in group A. 

The good news for Mexicos Argentine coach Ricardo La Volpe will come in the return of Marquez to the starting line-up, after the centre-back came safely through a 17-minute run-out at the end of Wednesdays goalless draw with Greece. 

Mexico conceded one goal in three group B games, beating Japan and Brazil before drawing with Greece as they extended their unbeaten run to 20 games. 

Weve played well in defence throughout the tournament and that gives us a lot of morale, Marquez told reporters. Argentina are a very tough team but we have to play as we have done in the last three games. 

Mexico have been dogged by problems and controversy throughout the tournament. La Volpes team received a sharp rebuke from Fifa president Sepp Blatter for giving several Guadalajara players leave to play in the Libertadores Cup. 

Mexico then lost defender Hugo Sanchez Guerrero to a knee injury that required surgery while Marquez has not yet started a game because of a recurrence of his groin injury. 

The form of the Mexicans has been remarkable, given the circumstances. Argentina have been similarly strong, beating Tunisia and Australia and drawing 2-2 with Germany. 

Juan Roman Riquelme has been the key figure, dominating midfield with his unhurried style, while Luciano Figueroa staked a claim for a World Cup place with his hattrick in the 4-2 win over Australia. 

Argentina lost 0-1 to Mexico in their last meeting in the Copa America last year. 

Jose Pekerman, Argentinas coach, is confident there will be no repeat on Sunday. Were on the way to having a very good team. We want to be in the final. 

Argentina centre-back Walter Samuel is suspended, meaning a likely start for Gabriel Milito. Mario Santana has a hamstring injury but should be fit to keep his place in midfield. 

The final is in Frankfurt on Wednesday. 

 Match begins 9.25 pm on STAR Sports

Calcutta: You may mistake him to be any ordinary 17-year-old biding time in one of the coffee parlours on a stale Monday afternoon. A carefree attitude that will not prompt you to take notice. 

Wait a second, speak to him, and it is then that you realise he carries a wiser head on his shoulders. Surya Prakash, the countrys top-ranked junior golfer, is not taking things for granted. 

Arjun Atwals words are still ringing in his years, when he played two rounds with him in Orlando last April. 

You still have a long way to go. Practice hard? Decide and then concentrate on what you want to do in life? Time is running out, Atwal had told Surya. 

In his own words, Surya is a changed player after having spent two weeks at the Faldo Golf Academy in the US. 

I spent time with chief coach Chipkoechlke and putting specialist Dr Fransworth. My swinging improved and the confidence level has increased several folds, Surya told The Telegraph. 

Surya won the Chandigarh Junior Open this year, besides finishing second at Northern India and fifth at Southern India junior events. Having already spent six years on the circuit he knows what is good and what is bad for him. 

An ardent admirer of Tiger Woods, the La Martiniere class XII student wants to turn pro at 22, once he is through with college. It will be the Indian Tour first, mainly to gather experience, followed by the Asian Tour. Ill take it from there?, he spells out his plans. 

For now, he is concentrating on the Classic junior and inter-state meet in Delhi in October, and the East India junior and RCGC junior events in November. 

These will be big tournaments for me and Ive to win them. My goal is to make the Indian team for the Asian junior Masters in December. 

Coaches Inderjit Singh Bhalotia and Smriti Mehra have been of huge help but dad Deepak Prakash has been his biggest influence. 

Besides being part of the school swimming team, Surya tries to keep himself updated on cricket and football. But golf takes most of his time. 

Besides spending time at the gymnasium every morning, I practice at least a couple of hours at the Royal late in the afternoon. 

Today the club is closed. So its my day off and time to catch up with my friends. I know you have to miss out on the good things in life if you aim higher, he signs off.

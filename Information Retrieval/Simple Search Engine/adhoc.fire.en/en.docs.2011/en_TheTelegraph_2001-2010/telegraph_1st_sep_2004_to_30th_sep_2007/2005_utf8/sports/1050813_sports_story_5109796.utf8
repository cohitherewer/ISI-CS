 Sebrle under IAAF scanner 

Helsinki: The IAAF is investigating a report that Olympic decathlon champion Roman Sebrle received an intravenous infusion during Wednesdays world decathlon final. 

In a statement on Friday, the IAAF said it had been told by the Finnish team that two Czech athletes had received intravenous infusions before the start of the 1,500m. 

IAAF spokesman Nick Davies confirmed that the athletes were world record holder Sebrle, who won the world silver medal behind American Bryan Clay, and 1996 Olympic bronze medallist Tomas Dvorak. 

Czech Athletics Federation spokesman Tomas Klement said the pair had probably taken glucose injections after the javelin throw.

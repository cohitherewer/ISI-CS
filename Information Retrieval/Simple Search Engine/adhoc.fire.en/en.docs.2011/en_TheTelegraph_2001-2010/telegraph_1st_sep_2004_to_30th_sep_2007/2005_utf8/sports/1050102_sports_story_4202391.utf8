Sydney: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has been forced out of the final Test with Australia starting Sunday after failing a last-minute fitness test. 

Inzamam also missed the second Test in Melbourne with a back complaint but was hoping to return in Sydney as the injury showed signs of improvement. 

However, Inzamam?s hopes were dashed after he was put through a rigorous practice session at the nets on Saturday, leaving the tourists in further disarray. 

?We can?t even name a team yet,? stand-in skipper Yusuf Youhana told reporters on Saturday. ?We have to replace four players. There will be a lot of changes.? 

Abdul Razzaq was also ruled out after being taken to hospital during the Melbourne test with a mystery illness. He was later discharged with a clean bill of health but management left him out after he complained of feeling dizzy. 

The tourists were already resigned to losing paceman Mohammad Sami and allrounder Shoaib Mailk. Sami has been ordered to rest because of a foot injury while Malik split the webbing on his fingers taking a catch in Melbourne. 

Yusuf admitted the odds were heavily stacked against his team winning. 

?Australia don?t take it lightly and we don?t either,? he said. ?I know they?re better than us because we have a lot of young and inexperienced players but we?re still trying to win this game.? 

Australia easily won the first two Tests to take an unassailable lead into the final game. 

However, captain Ricky Ponting said they were not treating their opponents lightly. 

?I hope they?re competitive,? Ponting said. ?There were times in the first two Tests when they had us in trouble but they weren?t able to maintain the pressure and that is the main difference between the teams. 

?It?s another opportunity for us to improve ourselves as a team and win another Test match. We don?t ever see any game as being a dead-rubber. 

?At no stage now are we going to take our foot off the accelerator.? 

Meanwhile, batsman Darren Lehmann and fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz have been dropped. 

Lehmann lost his spot to allrounder Shane Watson, who will make his Test debut, while leg-spinner Stuart MacGill was recalled at the expense of Kasprowicz, who will act as 12th man. 

Ponting said the selectors had agonised for days about changing the team after the world champions had easily won the first two Tests. 

?There was a lot of talk about whether we should keep the same team because everyone had done a great job... but this selection was made wholly and solely for this game and for these conditions,? Ponting said. 

?As far as I?m concerned, no-one?s been dropped but I am a believer in picking the best possible team you can for the opposition and for the conditions youre playing in. 

?I think it?s looking like an SCG wicket of old. The whole square is very dry and barren and Pakistan have never been great players of leg-spin bowling.? 

Lehmann had been under pressure to retain his place after failing to make a big score in the first two Tests but Kasprowicz had bowled superbly and was expected to be included in the team. He is likely to be recalled for next month?s tour of New Zealand and Lehmann said he was also confident his Test career was not finished.

Chester-le-Street: England strike bowler Steve Harmison took five wickets for 38 as Bangladesh were rolled over for 104 on the opening day of the second and final Test on Friday. 

At close, England were 269 for three off 48 overs. Marcus Trescothick made 151. Ian Bell was unbeaten on 57. 

The home team, in reply, reached tea on 46 for one, with Andrew Strauss the one victim, trapped leg before for eight by the impressive Mashrafe Mortaza. 

Harmison, seeking to rediscover his best form on his home ground before the arrival of the Australians, produced a searing spell in the morning and then returned with three more wickets to help wrap up the innings in 39.5 overs. 

Matthew Hoggard offered the main support, with three for 24, including two wickets in three balls, after England opted to bowl in increasingly overcast conditions. Wicketkeeper Geraint Jones took six catches. 

England won the first Test by an innings and 261 runs. 

Harmison, after a poor tour to South Africa and a mediocre first Test, rediscovered the line and, crucially, the length that took him to the top of the world rankings last year as he terrorised all of Bangladeshs batsmen. 

Only Javed Omar, with 37, and Khaled Mashud with 22, got to double figures. 

Harmison made the initial breakthrough with 17 on the board, inviting a off-drive from Nafees Iqbal which flew via the edge to Strauss who stretched right at third slip. 

Habibul Bashars continued belief in attack as the best form of defence let him down again. 

Bangladeshs captain carved Harmison for four via Ian Bells fingertips in the gully but departed for six two balls later as the bowler rattled the base of his leg stump with a fine yorker. 

Mohammed Ashraful should have been Harmisons third victim as a leading edge off an attempted pull looped up in the air towards mid-on. Harmison, however, slipped in his follow-through and failed to get back. 

Change bowlers Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff joined the party with a wicket apiece before Hoggard claimed his 150th Test wicket when Omar, increasingly assured, leg-glanced too finely and was caught behind with lunch beckoning. 

Harmison struck again in his first over back. Aftab Ahmed chased a wide one and tickled a catch behind and the Durham bowler also took the final wicket . 

The last five wickets fell for 35 in 10.1 overs. Graham Thorpe, the eighth England player to reach 100 Tests, was presented with a commemorative bat before the start of play.

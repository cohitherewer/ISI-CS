 Hayden bats for Ponting

Sydney: Matthew Hayden Thursday went into bat for criticised Australian skipper Ricky Ponting ahead of next weeks one-day series against a World XI. 

Ponting has been largely blamed for Australias 1-2 Ashes series loss to England earlier this month with influential past players Ian Chappell and Dennis Lillee calling for Shane Warne to replace him as captain. 

One billion per cent (backing Ponting). Ricky is a fantastic little leader, Hayden told reporters in Brisbane. 

To be quite honest Im sick and tired of even thinking about even reading anything about it. Its just ridiculous. 

Hes won a World Cup, (and) hes won series away from home in Sri Lanka and India. 

Amid calls that Warne was a better tactician that Ponting, Hayden said: I dont think Shane Warne would be better. Four Tests and suddenly now you want change. I dont think so. I dont agree with that. 

Hayden, who responded to pressure for his Test opening position by scoring 138 in the first innings of the fifth Test at The Oval, has been dropped for the three-match one-day series against the World XI, starting in Melbourne next week. 

Hayden said he had been told by the national selectors they wanted to take a new approach for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. 

The lefthander said it would be very unwise for them (the selectors) to shut the door on him as a one-day player. 

Hayden blamed a failure to adapt to Englands tactics for his struggles in the Ashes series. I was batting really well the whole summer, unfortunately and frustratingly, he said.

 NZ recall All Black Wilson

 Wilson?s last appearance in international cricket was in 1993 

Wellington: Former All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson was recalled to New Zealand?s cricket team on Wednesday for matches against a Rest of the World team later this month, after a 12 year absence from the international game. 

New Zealand will play the Rest of the World team, captained by Australia leg spinner Shane Warne, to raise money for tsunami victims and plug a gap in the programme caused by the cancellation of the series with Sri Lanka. 

Wilson, who retired from rugby in 2002, last played for the national team in 1993 before giving up cricket to concentrate on an All Black career. 

He said he had been working towards selection for the national team since resuming domestic first class cricket. 

?Now that I have this chance I am looking forward to getting in there and making the most of it,? Wilson said. 

New Zealand coach John Bracewell said Wilson was a dynamic cricketer with much to offer. 

?His match turning ability is undoubted and we just need to see if he can step up to this level again,? he said. 

Wilson?s selection for the three-match series did not mean he would be a regular in the squad, but it was an opportunity for him to establish himself, Bracewell said. 

Wilson played four ODIs in March 1993 against Australia, including a match-winning 44 not out in the final match of the series before concentrating on rugby after making his debut for the All Blacks later that year. 

The games will be held in Christchurch on January 22, Wellington on January 24 and Hamilton on January 26.

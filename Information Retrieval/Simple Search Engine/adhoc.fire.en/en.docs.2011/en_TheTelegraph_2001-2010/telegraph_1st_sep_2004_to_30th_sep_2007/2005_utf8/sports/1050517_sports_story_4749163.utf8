 Sporting not to rely on home advantage

London: Sporting coach Jose Peseiro believes home advantage will not be a significant factor in the Uefa Cup final against Russias CSKA Moscow on Wednesday. 

Three years after Feyenoord won the Uefa Cup in their own De Kuip Stadium, Sporting will bid to match the feat at their Jose Alvalade ground in Lisbon. 

Portugal were favourites to beat Greece (on home soil) in Euro 2004 and look what happened, said Peseiro. You cant take anything for granted. 

Other than Feyenoord, three clubs have achieved the feat in European club competition history ? Real Madrid in the 1957 European Cup, Inter Milan in the same competition eight years later and Barcelona, who lifted the 1982 Uefa Cup Winners Cup. 

Sportings only European trophy was the 1963-1964 Cup Winners Cup when they beat Hungarys MTK Budapest. 

Their performances in this seasons competition, in which they are averaging more than two goals a game, make them favourites for the trophy and they boast a matchwinner in Liedson. The Brazilian striker, the Portuguese leagues top scorer, has hit nine Uefa Cup goals. 

CSKA are only the second Russian team, and the first for 33 years, to reach the final of a major European competition. 

The army side expect to have only 2,000 fans in the Alvalade Stadium but coach Valery Gazzayev feels his team can handle the pressure. 

I think were ready to face Sporting even in their own back yard, said Gazzayev.

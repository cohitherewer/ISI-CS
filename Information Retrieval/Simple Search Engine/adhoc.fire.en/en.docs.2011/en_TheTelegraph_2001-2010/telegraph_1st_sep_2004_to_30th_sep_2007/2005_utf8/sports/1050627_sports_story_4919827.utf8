 Solkar key in 71 wins: Wadekar

Mumbai/New Delhi/Chennai: Former India captain Ajit Wadekar was abundant in praise of Eknath Solkar. Solkar, he said, was not only a gutsy all-rounder, with extraordinary reflexes but that he played a major role in our Test series triumph in 1971 in the West Indies and in England. 

Wadekar was the skipper in those successful series. 

Wadekar also talked of the repartee that Solkar had ready to remarks from the likes of the great Gary Sobers, Allan Knott and Geoff Boycott. Talking back to Sobers, Solkar had said: You play your stuff I will play mine. 

When Boycott was out to Solkar in 1971, the great batsmen refused to walk. Solkar told Boycott to go and tell his aunty that he was out, he said. 

I cannot forget the diving catch he took at full stretch to dismiss Knott first ball in the historic Oval Test triumph over England. That was the turning point of the match, Wadekar said. 

The following are (alphabetically) some of the other reactions: 

 BISHAN SINGH BEDI: His close-in catching was really intimidating. We would not have been the same (successful) bowlers without him. It is a very sad moment. I last met him in Mumbai two months back. 

 ASHOK MANKAD: Solkar was the most outstanding close-in fielder in the history of the game and a tremendous utility cricketer who gave the word all-rounder in true sense. I am very proud to have captained him. 

 SRINIVAS VENKATRAGHAVAN: I have played for 

 many years with him. We have fielded in positions that normally 

 people will not accept. He was a gutsy cricketer. His death 

 is a personal loss.

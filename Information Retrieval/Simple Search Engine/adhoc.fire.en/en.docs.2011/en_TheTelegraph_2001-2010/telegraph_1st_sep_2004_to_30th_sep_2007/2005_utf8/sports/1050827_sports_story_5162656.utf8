 RCGC set to help ailing Jamshed

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) is set to formally help cancer-stricken Sheikh Jamshed Ali, the first Arjuna Awardee in golf. 

The assistance is expected to be via a voluntary contribution from members. 

A circular is likely to be sent out sooner rather than later, a senior functionary told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the AGM held on Friday evening. 

Another added: Im not sure of the form it will take, but there must also be a mechanism to ensure the money raised is properly utilised. 

That Jamshed should get help from the RCGC was privately echoed by many who turned up for the annual ritual. 

Jamshed, who is short on funds, recently appealed to prominent citizens for assistance. 

The AGM, meanwhile, saw Aveek Sarkar unanimously re-elected Captain ? for 2005-06. 

A toast wasnt raised, but members nevertheless applauded gifted Surya Prakash for climbing to No.1 in the national colts ranking. 

The RCGC, of course, aims to produce more top-rankers.

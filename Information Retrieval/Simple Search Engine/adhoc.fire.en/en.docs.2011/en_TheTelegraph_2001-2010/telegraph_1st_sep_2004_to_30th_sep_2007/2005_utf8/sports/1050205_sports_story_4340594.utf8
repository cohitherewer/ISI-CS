 Zidane plans to quit in 2007

Paris: French soccer star Zinedine Zidane plans to hang up his boots when his current deal with Real Madrid runs out in 2007 when he will be 35. 

 ?I?ll finish in 2007 at the latest,? he told a television channel on Friday. 

 ?My contract runs to 2007 and I want to see it out but then I?ll end my career.? 

 Zidane, 32, would not rule out packing in his playing days earlier but he added:? it?s not on the agenda.? 

 His Real Madrid teammate David Beckham, 28, said Friday he wanted to finish his career at Madrid. The England captain?s contract also runs to 2007. 

 Zidane, Fifa world Player of the Year in 1998, 2000 and 2003, retired from international football after Euro 2004. He won 93 caps for France and his two headed goals in the final against Brazil secured the 1998 World Cup. 

 Zidane became the world?s most expensive player in 2001 when he moved from Juventus to Real Madrid for 63.6 million dollars. He has picked up three Italian and Spanish League winners medals, as well as winning the Champions League in 2002 with Real.

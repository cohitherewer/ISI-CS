 Tolly held 0-0

Margao: Fransa Pax failed to take advantage of their first half chances as they settled for a goalless draw against Tollygunge Agragami in the NFL match on Saturday. 

Tollygunge, who beat Fransa in the first leg, played a safe game packing more men in the defence after their humiliating defeat against Vasco in their last match here. Tollygunge came off with snap raids but lacked ideas in front of the goal as Tarif Ahmed missed three chances to score. 

Tollygunge goalie Arindam Ghosh was declared the Man of the Match. Fransa with 22 points from 14 matches are on fourth place, while Tollygunge took their total tally to 15 points from 14 matches.

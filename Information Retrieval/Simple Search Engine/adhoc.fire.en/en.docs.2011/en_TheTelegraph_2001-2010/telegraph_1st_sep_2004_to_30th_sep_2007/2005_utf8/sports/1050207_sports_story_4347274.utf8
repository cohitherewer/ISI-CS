 MAM equals Mallya?s record 

 HONKY DORY

 Mumbai: Racing baron MAM Ramaswamy won his fifth Indian Derby on Sunday and equalled Vijay Mallya?s record of maximum number of winners in the premium classic. Ramaswamy was however, not present to lead in Southern Regent but then he was also absent when the horse had recorded his earlier Derby wins in Bangalore (summer) and Hyderabad (Golconda Derby). Both races were, however, run over 2,000 metres. 

 It was the first Derby win for trainer S.Ganapathy who said: ?I?m in the seventh heaven. I had longed for this one all my life.? Jockey Prakash, too, was very excited. ?It?s my second Derby. Starsky had won me the first in the year 2002.? 

 For the record, Jockey Pesi Shroff has a record nine Indian Derbies under his belt while trainer Rashid Byramji?s record stretches to 10. The one who surpassed all records after the victory of Southern Regent is the breeder Ameeta Mehra of Usha Stud Farm where the winner was bred.

 Crowd at the Mahalaxmi racecourse was larger than previous years, though the only gimmick provided by the Royal Western India Race course was a makeshift casino. However, access to the totalisator windows was far too difficult despite additional 100-odd betting terminals. The usual long queues could be seen all around. 

 Betting network, however, broke down at the start of the day?s programme and it was restored only 5 minutes before the first race was run. Southern Regent clocked 2 minutes and 33.26 seconds in the Sunday?s 2,400mDerby. It far exceeded the timing of 2 mins 31.07 secs cut by Aperitivo in the Calcutta Derby last month. Aperitivo failed to touch the frame. It left many wondering as to what the Derby winning formula could be.

 New Delhi: India?s Ritwik Bhattacharya created a flutter when he upset top seed Mohammed Essam Hafiz of Egypt in straight games to reach the quarter finals of the Atlanta Open squash championship.

 The former national champion, who also has four PSA Tour titles to his credit, thrashed his higher ranked opponent 11-9, 11-7, 11-3 in just 25 minutes.

 Bhattacharya will now meet Matt Guiffree of Canada, who had beaten Ritwik in the Quebec Open in Montreal earlier this year. 

 New Delhi: Ace shooter Abhinav Bindra finished a disappointing 40th in men?s 10m air rifle event in the ISSF World Cup (rifle and pistol) in Fort Benning, US. The 23-year-old Indian finished with a series of below par scores of 97, 97, 100, 98, 98, 98 for a total of 588 that gave him no chance to enter the final on Thursday. 

 Tokyo: Japanese club Kashiwa Reysol were fined a record $93,000 by the J-League on Friday because of crowd trouble after a home match with Nagoya Grampus Eight last month.

 The J-League?s disciplinary committee blamed Kashiwa for failing to prevent Reysol fans from attacking Nagoya fans following their 2-0 defeat on April 23. 

 Madrid: Osasuna reached their first ever King?s Cup final on Thursday when they produced a dogged defensive display to hold Atletico Madrid to a 0-0 draw at the Calderon and win through 1-0 on aggregate. Valdo?s strike in the first-leg at Pamplona was enough to see Osasuna through to the final on June 11 where they will meet Real Betis.

 Beijing: Retired Chinese champion diver Fu Mingxia will enter the International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF) in Lauderdale on Friday. Fu has completed a remarkable diving career that earned her the title ?Queen of diving?. Over a period of three Olympic Games (1992, 1996, 2000) she earned four gold and one silver medals, more than any other diver in history, xinhua news agency noted. 

 New Delhi: India?s Kiran Tak and Thirumalai 

 Kumar have won the gold and the silver medal, respectively, 

 in the long course swimming competition at the recently 

 concluded Disability Sport of England at Sheffield. Kiran 

 and Thirumalai were among the five swimmers who represented 

 the country.

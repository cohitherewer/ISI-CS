 Lin Dan loses 

title to Chen

Birmingham: World No. 1 Lin Dan lost his title at the All-England Open championships when he was beaten in the final by Chen Hong, his close friend from the same province of Fujian. 

Lin looked well on course to atone for his startling first round failure in the Olympics when he won a relaxed and skilful first game, but unaccountably fell apart to lose 8-15, 15-5, 15-2. 

Suddenly mistakes flowed from his racket and Chen hurried to 7-2 and to parity in only 15 more minutes, and the third game was a rout as Lin, who may have been suffering from knee problems, continued to look well below par. 

Chen also found increasing opportunities for his famous smash, hitting the deck from a great height more and more often and hurtling to victory in a disappointingly one-sided third game. 

It meant that chen, who had reached his third All-England final in four years, regained the title he won with a far more spectacular performance in the 2002 final. 

?I feel even more excited than when I won it last time,? said Chen, who only woke up two hours before the final and had no time to practise. ?I feel it is a new era coming for me. I am mentally stronger than I was before. 

?I feel that we are equally strong players and I won because I am a little bit mentally stronger today. I felt that Lin Dan also wanted it badly but that I had the upper hand.? 

Despite that, there were critics who thought the contest lacked sparkle. Chinese players are reputed to play exhibition-style matches against each other on occasions, and Chen was asked whether it was difficult to play a friend.

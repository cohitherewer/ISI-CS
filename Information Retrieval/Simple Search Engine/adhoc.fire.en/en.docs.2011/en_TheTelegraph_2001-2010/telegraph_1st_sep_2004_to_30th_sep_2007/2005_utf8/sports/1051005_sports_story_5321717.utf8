 Dalmiya: BCCI should get 50 per cent of revenue

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said the Board should get 50 per cent of the revenue generated from the ICC Champions Trophy. 

Speaking to the media at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday, he said: The maximum number of sponsors for the Champions Trophy are from India, so we will ask the ICC to give the BCCI 50 per cent of the revenue generated from the tournament. This money will be used for the development of the game in the country. 

Dalmiya will also raise the matter at the ICC meeting later this month. Apart from the revenue issue, he also wishes to bring the 2011 World Cup to India. The other contender for the 2011 edition is Australia. 

I will try my best to bring the 2011 World Cup to India and will also propose that Asia should host every third edition of the World Cup from 2015 to 2050, said Dalmiya. I will also ask the ICC to introduce a fixed timeframe for hosting the Asian Test Championship and Asia Cup. The fixture is very cramped and the ICC should slot both the tournaments in a proper way.

London: Arsenal strengthened their grip on second place in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory at relegation candidates West Bromwich Albion on Monday. 

Dutch forward Robin Van Persie shot home from 15 metres in the 66th minute and Brazilian midfielder Edu scored in the dying moments to hand Arsenal their success. 

With three games left, Arsenal moved on to 77 points, 11 behind newly crowned champions Chelsea but four clear of Manchester United, 4-0 winners at Charlton Athletic on Sunday. 

The Gunners are now in hailing distance of clinching the runners-up slot which guarantees an automatic place in next season?s Champions League. They also meet United later this month in the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was generous in his praise of Chelsea who took away their title with a 2-0 win at Bolton Wanderers on Saturday. 

?They were hungry for success and they achieved it,? he told Sky Sports News after Monday?s match. 

West Brom stay second-bottom on 30 points, the same as Norwich City and one less than Crystal Palace and Southampton. All four clubs have two matches to play. 

Manager Bryan Robson, staring relegation in the face, felt West Brom had been unlucky. 

?Sometimes there?s no justice in the game,? he said. ?We deserved more.? (Reuters)

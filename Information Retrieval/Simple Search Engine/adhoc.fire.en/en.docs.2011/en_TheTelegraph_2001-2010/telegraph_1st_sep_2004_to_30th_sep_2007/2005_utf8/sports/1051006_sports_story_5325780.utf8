 Sourav test now in Mumbai

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys Challenger fate will be decided in Mumbai on Friday. 

The Team India captain has been named to lead the India Senior side in the four-day tournament beginning in Mohali on Monday. 

His participation, however, is subject to passing a fitness test under the supervision of Team India physio John Gloster and BCCI medical panel chief Anant Joshi. 

I will be guided by what the Team India physio says, Sourav said on Wednesday. 

The left-hander has already intimated the BCCI about his injury on the right elbow which he picked up during a practice game in Zimbabwe last month. 

Meanwhile, Sourav also underwent training under senior Bengal fitness trainer Chinmoy Roy at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. Parachute was used during Bengal training, said Roy.

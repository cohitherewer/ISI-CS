 Alonso eyes seventh heaven

London: Renaults Fernando Alonso could find himself in seventh heaven on Sunday at his favourite Hungarian circuit. Two years ago, as a 22-year-old, the Spaniard made Formula One history at the Hungaroring as the youngest Grand Prix winner. 

He said then that he wanted to be the youngest champion as well and this time he returns to celebrate his 24th birthday on Friday knowing that his ambition is close to fruition. Alonso has won six of the seasons 12 races so far and, with a 36 point lead, a seventh triumph could put the championship within his grasp. 

Even if team boss Flavio Briatore has warned the team against doing a Milan, reminding them of the Italians who lost the Champions League final to Liverpool after being 3-0 ahead at half-time, Alonso will be hard to beat. 

Hungary has always been one of my favourite racetracks, he said after winning in Germany last weekend following yet another agonising retirement for McLaren title rival Kimi Raikkonen, who had been in the lead. 

I think with this years car it should be a good opportunity for us to be on the podium and hopefully beat McLaren, but at the moment they are the quickest. 

Even if Raikkonen has more pace, it will count for far less at the second slowest circuit on the calendar and one where it is also notoriously difficult to overtake. 

The Finn also has a disadvantage in qualifying: I will be going out first so will be affected by the dusty track, but the car is quick and I will push hard, he said. 

I always enjoy Hungary as there is a really good atmosphere because of all the Finns (who) come down to the race. It is like a home Grand Prix for me and I hope I can give the thousands of Finnish fans something to cheer about. 

Hungary should suit the Renault, but Alonso will have to watch out for Raikkonens Colombian teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, who finished second in Hockenheim.

 Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are 

 getting their feel back on the ground, slowly, and pretty 

 unimpressively, though. In a dreary display of pathetic 

 soccer, the home team beat JCT 1-0 in their National Football 

 League (for the ONGC Cup) match at the Salt Lake Stadium 

 Wednesday, but might as well have returned with a single 

 point instead of three.

 Ashim Biswas, too, was finally 

 into goals, heading home the winner in the 16th minute. 

 That leaves Mohun Bagan now at fourth spot, behind East 

 Bengal, Dempo and Fransa. Fransa and Bagan both have ten 

 points, but Fransa are ahead on goal difference and have 

 played one match less (six). JCT remain unhappy on seven 

 points from seven matches.

 The big disappointment was in 

 defender Ajibade Olaniran Babalade. In his first match in 

 India the Nigerian failed to impress. 

 In front of a sparse crowd ? that?s 

 the appeal of Mohun Bagan these days ? he showed slow movement, 

 inaccurate trapping, barely any passing, and a couple of 

 headers he missed that could have placed Bagan in a better 

 position.

 Not just that. In the 71st minute 

 he effected a back-volleyed clearance and fell to the ground 

 and failed to get himself to be back in action. He had to 

 be replaced. That showed his absolute lack of fitness. If 

 there were any positives emerging from this match it was 

 in the 16th minute when in a Bagan attack Noel Wilson took 

 a 25-yard volley that came off the crosspiece. Ashim, in 

 the box, snapped it up quickly and headed into the far corner 

 of the netting. Later, Bagan assistant coach Shyamal Banerjee 

 (coach Subrata Bhattacharya is currently suffering from 

 media allergy) said ?this goal will bring Ashim back, with 

 renewed confidence.?

 This comment of Banerjee, of course, 

 was after he had compared Babalade with the famous Samuel 

 Omollo and that ?he should be okay in two-three matches.?

 Rightly, of course, Wilson was 

 declared Man of the Match. 

 The misses of the day were close, 

 too. A hesitant Baldeep Singh at theMohun Bagan goalmouth 

 was dispossessed by goalkeeper Bivash Ghosh in the 12th 

 minute. Mehtab Hussein outdid Baldeep in the 27th minute 

 when he shot out from close after KV Dhanesh had failed 

 to thwart a Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? forward pass. It 

 was a difficult thing to do.

 Beto headed off target three minutes 

 later and play had gravitated towards midfield. It was all 

 over bar the whistle, delayed through injury time recovery, 

 when the Punjab team suddenly wanted to fight. Off a quick 

 move Ram Paul was in possession at the goalmouth. Then he 

 shot over. Few can, from there.

 ?That was a case of wrong perception,? 

 JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh said later. ?He should have scored 

 with his stomach in that position, but he wanted to use 

 his legs instead.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Asif reacts to PCA stand

 - MOHALI INVITATION ISSUE 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Former Pakistan skipper Asif Iqbal has reacted to reports in a section of the press, including The Telegraph, on his not being invited to the ongoing first Test in Mohali as a guest of the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA), because his name has been tainted by allegations of match-fixing. 

Incidentally, another former captain, Salim Malik, too has not been invited by the PCA. 

The UK-based Asif e-mailed a lengthy ?rejoinder? late on Friday, where he has specifically talked about PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra. However, efforts to get a comment from Bindra proved futile. 

The following is what Asif had to say: 

It takes time for news from the subcontinent to filter through to the UK and therefore I have heard only recently about a supposed news item that is said to have been doing the rounds for the past few days regarding why I have not been invited by the Punjab Cricket Association to the first Test currently underway at (sic) Mohali. 

I am given to understand that the head of the PCA has said that the ICC has ?unofficially? asked all cricket administrators to boycott me for my alleged ?involvement? in match fixing, although nothing has been proven against me. 

When I came to know that the ACU was conducting investigations on this subject, I appeared before them of my own accord although I knew full well that they had no authority whatsoever to compel me to attend. 

In two meetings that I had with ACU officials I was never even charged with any offence, so the question of any finding against me does not arise. In fact, I was not even under the impression that I was the subject of any inquiry. An inquiry commission appointed by the Cricketers? Benefit Fund Series to look into the affairs of the Sharjah based organisation of which I was a part for some 20 years, did not even bother to contact me. 

Yet, a few months ago, it came to my notice that some form of ?unofficial? below-the-table directive from the ICC to the various boards could have been the reason why I was not invited to the BCCI?s golden jubilee one-day International in Calcutta last November. I then wrote to the ICC and the Pakistan Cricket Board, and the operative parts of their replies are given below: 

The ICC?s Chief Executive Officer Mr Malcolm Speed, in response to my letter wrote on 24th December, 2004: ?There was, in sum, contrary to your suggestion, no recommendation by the Board that ?all cricket boards should in effect boycott (you)?. Members of the ICC are accordingly free to invite (or not to invite) you to their particular functions as they may see fit.? 

And the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Mr Shahryar Khan, in his reply to me dated 28th January 2005 said: ?In my book, a man is not considered guilty unless proven so. 

?Your tenure as Captain and your support for cricketers benefit fund is of course a matter of record.? 

The present comments have been attributed to Mr I.S. Bindra who had made accusations against me and was called by the CBI and the ACU to substantiate his claims. He did not appear before either. But neither Mr Bindra nor what he says are of any importance. 

If the ICC gives me one thing in writing and then surreptitiously gives contrary directions to other cricketing organisations, how can I be expected to clear my name under such a regime? The universally common principle of justice, applicable even to murderers and rapists, is that a man is deemed to be innocent until proven guilty. 

Here, any proof of guilt apart, I have never even been formally accused of any wrong doing. If, in spite of that, I stand convicted by the leading body of the sport to which I dedicated my life, what can I be expected to do to clear my name? 

I have heard of private clubs blackballing members but the fact that the organisation that controls one of the world?s leading sports at the highest level conducts itself on similar lines is, I feel, unacceptable. Yet, the ICC, I am certain hears such statements being made, which in effect contradict what it has given me in writing. 

That makes me think that what Mr Bindra says may not be entirely devoid of truth. But if the world?s leading cricketing organisation chooses to lie and in effect not have the courage of facing up to its own decisions, there is nothing that can legally be done. 

That is something lawyers have confirmed to me. 

There are people who have been invited by the PCA who have been fined in furtherance of match fixing inquiries in which they have figured. Yet, no other playing member of any country has been similarly ?blackballed? which means that if the ?blackballing? reports are true, I was the only one involved in the practice of match fixing. 

Given that I played my last Test match 25 years ago, this means that from outside the arena I could manage to fix games without anyone in either of the contesting sides actually playing, being involved. 

Regrettably, the cricketing authorities of the country which I captained and represented for 17 years, notwithstanding all the sweet words, did not deem it fit to fight my corner. That, I suppose, is the price one has to pay for abandoning one?s roots.

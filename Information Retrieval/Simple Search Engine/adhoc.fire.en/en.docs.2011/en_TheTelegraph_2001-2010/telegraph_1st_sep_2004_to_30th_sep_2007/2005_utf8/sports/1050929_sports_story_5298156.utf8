 Derby looks wide open 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The monsoon version of the Derby ? the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes on Friday ? is going to be as competitive as its winter edition, though there are only five horses in the running for the winners stakes of about Rs 2.4 lakh.

 At least three horses in the field ? Rasalas, Ardennes and Sanskara ? are capable of landing the prized event.

 Rasalas has done nothing wrong since carrying his topweight to victory in the 1,600m Grand Annual Handicap. The filly Sanskara, too, has exhibited her brilliance while trouncing the Fillies Trial field recently. 

 Aleksei could have given further boost to the classic but his connections have bestowed faith in Ardennes, a facile winner over a mile in Mysore. Aleksei has been asked to grace the Star Of Italy Cup line-up on the Derby day. 

 Nevertheless, its going to be a very exciting and competitive Derby and one hopes the best horse in the field wins.

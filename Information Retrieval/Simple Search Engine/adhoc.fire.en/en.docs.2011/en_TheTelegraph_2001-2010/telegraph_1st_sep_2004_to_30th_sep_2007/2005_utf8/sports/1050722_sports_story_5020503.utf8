The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am really motivated to do well at Hockenheim: Narain

 - GERMAN GP Kiesa new Jordan test driver 

 Narain will focus on learning the layout in Fridays practice session 

Hockenheim: After completing 101 trouble-free laps in last weeks testing, Narain Karthikeyan hopes to finish the race despite the challenge posed by the unfamiliar Hockenheim ring, venue for this Sundays German Grand Prix. 

Putting behind the disappointments of the last two races, the Jordan driver says he is motivated to do well in the back-to-back races in Germany and Hungary. 

The two-day test went very well at Paul Ricard last week. We focused especially on working on different types of Bridgestone tyres and finding a good set-up for the forthcoming races, Karthikeyan said. 

In Hockenheim, I will do my best to finish as I encountered some technical problems during the last two races. I am really motivated to do well there. Once again, Hockenheim is a circuit I have never driven on, as will be the case in Budapest next week, the 28-year-old reminded. 

The Jordan drivers finalised their preparations for the German and Hungarian GPs, the third consecutive double-header of the season, with a last two-day test session on July 14 and 15, before F1s summer testing ban. Karthikeyan said he would concentrate on learning the layout in the first free practice session on Friday. 

Therefore, I will have to spend the first sessions learning the layout, but I am up for the challenge. 

Meanwhile, Nicolas Kiesa will be the new test driver for Jordan in Fridays free practice sessions. 

Im pleased to give Nicolas Kiesa this well-deserved opportunity. He has proven himself to be a talented and consistent driver in the junior categories, as well as at the F1 level, Jordans managing director Colin Kolles said. 

Were looking forward to working with him this weekend, when we will also discuss our longer-term position. I would also like to thank Robert Doornbos for the work he has done for Jordan as our Friday test driver and wish him well in his career. 

Kiesa, who did his pre-season testing with Minardi, described it as an exciting opportunity for him. 

I am very excited about the opportunity to drive for Jordan. I want to do a good job for the team and help them with their preparation and data gathering, Kiesa said. (Agencies)

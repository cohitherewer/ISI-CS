Hyderabad: After a brief stint of practice session at the Gachibowli Stadium here on Tuesday, a confident looking Indian contingent left for Malaysia to take part in the Azlan Shah hockey tournament to commence in Kaula Lampur on Thursday. 

The Dilip Tirkey-led team would bank on experience of Len Aiyappa and Arjun Hallappa in the absence of formidable mid-fielders Viren Rasquinha and Vikram Pillay. 

India would be looking for a couple of good matches to improve their position in the prestigious seven-nation tournament as it had finished at the bottom in the previous edition.

New coach Rajinder Singh (Jr) dismissed that absence of some senior members in the side would have a bearing on the performance of the side. 

Everyone has to contribute. We can also rely on our strikers as we have a good forward line, he said. 

Mid-field was however appeared a bit weak with both Rasquinha and Pillay being out. Skipper Tirkey said though it was a matter of concern, he had the confidence that other players would live upto the expectations.

 Paris: Former Olympic 400m champion Colette Besson died from cancer on Tuesday aged 59, her husband said. Besson?s crowning moment came at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City when she produced a tremendous home straight in the final of the 400m to pip British star Lilian Board. The following year in 1969, Besson broke the 400m world record at the European Championships in Athens timing 51.70 secs. Besson retired from athletics in 1977.

 Beijing: With less than three years to go for the mega event, the Beijing Organising Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (Bocog) has launched two artistic campaigns of contrasting scales. For those who think big, Bocog is inviting proposals for public sculptures celebrating the Olympics, while for those working on a smaller scale, the committee is running a calligraphy competition.

 Beijing: Chinese world champion Zhao Hongbo snapped his Achilles tendon during training last week and may not be able to compete in the Turin Olympics, Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. Zhao, winner of world titles in 2002 and 2003 with partner Shen Xue, suffered the injury last Friday after attempting a jump at a high-altitude training centre in southwest China, Xinhua said. ?The operation went well, but he still needs three months to hit the ice,? Zhao?s coach Yao Bin said.

 Sydney: World and Olympic champion Ian Thorpe could skip the 400m freestyle at next year?s Melbourne Commonwealth Games, his coach said on Tuesday. Thorpe, who has not been beaten in a 400m final since 1998, will concentrate on the shorter distances and could even replace the 400m with the 50m, according to coach Tracey Menzies. ?He just wants a bit of a break from it,? Menzies was quoted as saying in a Melbourne daily.

 Rome: Italian director Marco Risi says he has reached an agreement with Diego Maradona to direct a film on his life. The film will be called quot;La Mano Di Dio, quot; named after Maradonas hand of god goal in the 1986 World Cup. quot;It doesnt have the classic style, its a series of incursions in the various phases of his life, with extracts of his most glorious soccer moments, quot; Risi said in an interview published on Tuesday.

 Genoa: Fans furious over a decision to relegate Italian club Genoa for match-fixing, clashed with police in the northern city into the early hours of Tuesday, overturning cars and setting fire to waste bins.

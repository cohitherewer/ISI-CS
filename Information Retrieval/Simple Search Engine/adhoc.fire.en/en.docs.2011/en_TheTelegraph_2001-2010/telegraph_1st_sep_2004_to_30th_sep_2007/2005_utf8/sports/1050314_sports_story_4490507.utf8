 Kapil the best captain: Azhar

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Kharagpur: Former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin feels Sourav Ganguly is surely a successful captain, but the greatest skipper India has seen is Kapil Dev. 

Speaking Sunday on the sidelines of an exhibition match between ex-India and Pakistan players, organised by Kharagpur Green Academy, the former skipper said: ?The record books will reveal that as a captain, Sourav has won lots of matches. In this respect, he is definitely successful. But I think as a captain, Kapil Dev is our all time greatest.? 

Azhar added: Kapil was an attacking captain and ?he would boost the morale of his players tremendously.?

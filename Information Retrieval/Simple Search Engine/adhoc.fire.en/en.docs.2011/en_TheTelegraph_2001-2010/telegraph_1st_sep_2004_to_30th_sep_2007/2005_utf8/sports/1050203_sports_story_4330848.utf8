The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Easy for Japan against Syria

Saitama: Japan beat Syria 3-0 on Wednesday in the second of two warm-up games ahead of their World Cup qualifier against North Korea next week. 

Striker Takayuki Suzuki headed Japan in front just before halftime after a disappointing first half in Saitama. 

Syria were reduced to 10 men on the hour when midfielder Kader Jbeili picked up his second yellow card and Japan defender Tsuneyasu Miyamoto made it 2-0 in the 70th minute. 

Playmaker Mitsuo Ogasawara added the third in stoppage time. ?We could have scored more goals but we showed good resilience and mental strength again,? said Japan coach Zico. (Reuters)

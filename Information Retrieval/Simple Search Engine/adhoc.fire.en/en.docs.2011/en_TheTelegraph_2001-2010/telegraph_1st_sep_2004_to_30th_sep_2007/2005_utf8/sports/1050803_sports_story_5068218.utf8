 Masters Cup Federers priority

 Federer will defend the US Open title without coach Tony Roche 

London: World No. 1 Roger Federer says winning the season-ending Masters Cup is his 2005 priority after claiming the Wimbledon title for the third year running. 

Speaking to a Swiss agency from his holiday, Federer denied media reports he was suffering serious foot problems. 

He said he would travel to this months US Open, where he is defending his title, without coach Tony Roche who would rejoin him for the Masters Cup in Shanghai in November. 

I have got lots of goals from here to the end of the season and Im really looking forward to playing again, said Federer, who has not competed since winning Wimbledon in early July and will return at the Cincinnati Masters in mid-August. 

Asked what was his top priority, Federer said: Possibly the Masters Cup. I dont play often in Asia and Im looking forward to returning to Shanghai. 

The other tournaments are essential for my ranking and its often those ones that people remember at the end of your career. 

The Swiss said that, on an emotional level, he was looking forward to playing in the Davis Cup playoff against Britain in September. 

The winners will retain their place in the elite world group. Federer missed Switzerlands first round defeat by the Netherlands in March. 

(Winning) the Davis Cup remains one of the great goals of my career. At the beginning of every year I analyse my objectives ? in 2005 my main goal was to keep my No. 1 ranking. 

One day my priority will be Roland Garros and one day it will be the Davis Cup.

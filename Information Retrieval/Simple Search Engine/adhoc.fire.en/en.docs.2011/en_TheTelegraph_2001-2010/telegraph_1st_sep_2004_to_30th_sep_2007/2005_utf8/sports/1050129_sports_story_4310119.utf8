 Captains? conclave in Sydney

 - Second ICC awards before Super Test 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Dave Richardson 

Mumbai: The next edition of the International Cricket Council (ICC)-hosted Test captains? conclave will be held in Sydney later this year, in all probability on October 11. 

The last such interaction between the ICC brass and the top guns was in London, on the eve of the 2004 Champions Trophy, almost five months ago. 

?The date hasn?t been fixed, but the meeting is definitely going to be gone through in the lead-up to the Super Test (between Australia and the Rest of World), which begins on October 13,? the ICC?s general manager (cricket), David Richardson, told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on the sidelines of an LG-ICC workshop here, on Friday afternoon, Richardson added: ?In fact, the second ICC awards will also be held there in the lead-up to the six-day Super Test?? 

The inaugural awards, it may be recalled, were hosted by London last September. 

Of course, the agenda for the captains? conclave is far from being finalised ? after all, there?s enough time ? but Richardson indicated one issue is bound to be addressed: The slow tempo of Test cricket, specifically, the rather dismal over-rates. 

The Super Test is going to be preceded by three limited overs matches between the Rest of World and the No. 1 ranked team ? again, almost surely, Australia. 

The matches don?t have official billing, but it?s likely that the ICC?s Executive Board will look at reviewing that, especially as the two tsunami fixtures have been accorded ODI status. 

?That?s a possibility, yes,? remarked Richardson, a distinguished former South African wicketkeeper.

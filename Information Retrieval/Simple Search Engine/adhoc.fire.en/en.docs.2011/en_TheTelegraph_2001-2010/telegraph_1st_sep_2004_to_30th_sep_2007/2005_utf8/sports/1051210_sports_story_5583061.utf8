Bangkok: Shiv Kapur and Jyoti Randhawa scorched the course to occupy the top two spots at the midway stage of the $600,000 Volvo Masters of Asia and keep alive the hopes of ensuring 2005 does not end as a winless year for the Indians on the Asian Tour. 

While rookie Kapur overcame a minor hiccup right at the end to emerge as the sole leader at 11-under 133, defending champion Randhawa shot the days best round of eight-under 64 on the strength of a brilliant back nine to rocket to the second spot at 10-under 134, just one behind his countrymate. 

The Volvo Masters of Asia has always panned out well for the Indians since its inception in 2002. While Arjun Singh lost out in a close finish and ended tied second in 2002, Randhawa was third with Harmeet Kahlon tied seventh in 2003. 

In 2004 when Randhawa won, Rahil Gangjee and Jeev Milkha were tied for ninth. 

The second day was all about Indians and Australians. After the Indians in the top two spots, Australians occupied the next three. 

Marcus Both brought in a six-under to be nine-under and was in sole third place, while overnight co-leader Andrew Buckle (71) and Adam Fraser (69) were tied fourth at seven-under 134. 

Gaurav Ghei was the other Indian to do well with a round of three-under 69 that placed him in tied 16th place at three-under 139, while Kahlon (76) and Jeev (79) floundered in form and were lying way behind in tied 45th and 53rd places. 

Randhawa, too, opened with a bogey, as he thinned a wedge shot and went over before missing a chip-putt. But thereon, he made no mistakes and slotted nine birdies from distances ranging as far as 22 feet. 

The defending champion holed four birdies on the front nine to take the turn in 33 at three-under and then added five birdies on the back nine for a blistering 31. (PTI)

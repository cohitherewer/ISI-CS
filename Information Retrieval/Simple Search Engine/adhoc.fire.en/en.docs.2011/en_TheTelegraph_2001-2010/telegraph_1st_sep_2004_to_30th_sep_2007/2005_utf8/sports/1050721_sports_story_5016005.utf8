 Autocop may come good 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: A healthy 

 average of eight runners per event, in Thursdays race 

 card, is a welcome sign. But what really matters is if the 

 stewards would continue with the stringent measures to cleanse 

 the system. They had done a good job on the Day I of the 

 season by slapping suspension on an erring jockey and giving 

 serious warnings to other professionals.

 If the form holds good, it is going to be a fascinating day of racing. Trainers Daniel David and Errol Bhungard apart, other schoolers like Bharath Singh, Richard Alford and Jaggy Dhariwal, too, seem to have serious interest in the afternoons card.

 Dhariwals Autocop, in particular, needs attention in the feature event, the Schwarzenegger Cup. With a light impost of 48-kg on her back, the speedy filly, by Burden Of Proof out of Traffic Police, may strike in the hands of apprentice Malcom Maseyk. Alfords Over The Rainbow and Bharaths Aneroid, too, are capable of winning their respective events.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 Olonga calls on NZ to cancel tour

Wellington: Zimbabwean cricketer Henry Olonga has called on New Zealand to abandon its scheduled tour of his troubled homeland and criticised the International Cricket Council for a lack of compassion for victims of human rights abuses. 

Olonga is visiting New Zealand as a guest of Green Party lawmakers who have campaigned for the cancellation of the tour to Zimbabwe, due in August and September. 

I personally believe (the tour) shouldnt go ahead simply because what is happening to people in Zimbabwe is just terrible. This is a government that has consistently abused its own people. Im disappointed the ICC hasnt shown more compassion. (AFP)

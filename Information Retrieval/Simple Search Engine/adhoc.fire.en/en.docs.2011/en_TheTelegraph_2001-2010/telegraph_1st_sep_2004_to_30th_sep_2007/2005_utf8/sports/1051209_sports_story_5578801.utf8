 Sehwag down with fever

 Kumble in Delhi on Thursday 

New Delhi: Two days ahead of the second Test against Sri Lanka at his home ground Ferozeshah Kotla, Virender Sehwag was down with fever. 

Sehwag, who missed the morning practice session due to illness, was learnt to have visited the Gangaram hospital to consult doctors. 

It is just fever, Indian team media manager Wg Cdr M. Baladitya said. 

Asked if the Delhi batsman would be fit and available for practice on Friday, Baladitya said, Hopefully. We have to see. The second Test, which starts here on Saturday, will be Anil Kumbles 99th appearance. 

Indias leading Test wicket-taker typically played down any suggestion of disappointment at having remained on the backstage throughout his colourful career. 

 The team knows what I am capable of. I have the respect of the team and the opponents as well, and the adulation I have received has been tremendous. So I have no qualms, the 35-year-old veteran leg-spinner said after the teams practice session at the Palam ground on Thursday. 

Only Sachin Tendulkar in the current team has played more matches than him. 

It is a great feeling. To think back, I started in 1990 and to have got this far ... Feeling a part of elite group, he said. 

It definitely helps your confidence. It shows your sustained kind of performance at international level. It acts as a motivational factor.

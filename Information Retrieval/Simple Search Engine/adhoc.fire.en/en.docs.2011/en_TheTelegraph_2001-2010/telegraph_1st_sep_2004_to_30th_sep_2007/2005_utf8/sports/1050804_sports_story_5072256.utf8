 City favourite has no takers in Bangalore 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Daniel David scored a popular double ? through Wayward King and Native Son ? on Wednesday but his 6-4 favourite, Generous Gift, ran like a dud. The poor performance of the horse helped a less fancied Thoughtful to score, crediting trainer Deepak Karki with a smart double. Earlier in the afternoon, Karkis Sea Legend had claimed the INS Netaji Subhas Cup.

 However, Bangalore sources informed that Generous Gift had no takers even at the odds of 7-1 in the Garden Citys betting ring. It is surprising that the betting pattern differed so alarmingly at the host centre compared to the off-course venue. Of late, some of the citys heavily backed runners from the leading stables have also been letting down.

 On this day, for instance, Errol Bhungards Trojan Desert attracted big betting at 5-2, in the Riders Of The Sea Handicap, but the trainers 15-1 shot Bold Display won like a champion. For the records, B. Gurang partnered Bold Display to victory and the jockey went on to serve another blow through a friendless win of Supreme Chancellor.

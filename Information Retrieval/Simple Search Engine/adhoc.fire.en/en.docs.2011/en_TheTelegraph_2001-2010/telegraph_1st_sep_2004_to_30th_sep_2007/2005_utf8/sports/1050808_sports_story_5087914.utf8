 Colombo: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, 

 who got hit on the unprotected left forearm while fending 

 a snorter from the West Indies Daren Powell, on Sunday, 

 hasnt suffered a fracture. 

Sourav retired hurt on two in the fourth over and was immediately taken to the Nawaloka Hospital for an x-ray and consultations with a leading orthopaedic surgeon. 

 The x-ray only showed bruising... 

 In fact, Sourav had padded up and, if necessary, would have 

 resumed his innings, manager Sanjay Jagdale told The 

 Telegraph. 

The manager added: Sourav, of course, was in a lot of pain for quite some time... For now, he has to manage with icing and pain-killers. 

 Its not confirmed, but Sourav should be available 

 for Tuesdays tri-series final against Sri Lanka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dinesh Vajpai counters Batra 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Dinesh Vajpai on Monday rubbished fellow-Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) vice-president Narinder Batras contention that the former is not eligible to contest for the Cricket Association of Bengal presidents post. 

Batra said at a press conference in Delhi that he had written a letter to IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran bringing to his notice that as per Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and sports ministry guidelines, no office-bearer of a national sports federation/association can hold office simultaneously of any other sports federation/association excepting the IOA and, so, Vajpai should step down as Bengal Hockey Association president. 

Firstly, the government cannot issue any guidelines to any sports federation? and there is no connection between the IOA and cricket, said Vajpai. Hes also talking of my holding two posts. Im just contesting for the second one. Let me get the second post, then well see?

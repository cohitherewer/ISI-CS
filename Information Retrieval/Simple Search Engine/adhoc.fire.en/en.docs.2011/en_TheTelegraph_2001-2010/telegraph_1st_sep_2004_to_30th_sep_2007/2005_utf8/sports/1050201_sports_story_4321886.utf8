 Cloud over Shoaib?s selection

 Shoaib feels a lobby in Pakistan is trying to run him down 

Islamabad: Frequent injury breakdowns and questionable off-the-field conduct could see the trouble-prone Rawalpindi Express being ignored for the forthcoming tour of India, according to a report in a Pakistan daily. 

Shoaib Akhtar, currently making headlines for his hamstring injury, has once again rubbed the cricket establishment the wrong way, a report in The News said on Monday. 

The speedster, who had to return home midway from the Australian tour owing to the injury, should consider himself lucky if he makes it to the touring squad for the next month?s tour of India, the report said. 

?The circumstances in which Shoaib has returned home do not augur well for him. Another breakdown due to fitness problems, his failure to come through in Australia as a match winner and question marks over his personal conduct are all issues, which are being looked at by the authority in the context of the Indian tour,? the report quoted a PCB source as saying. 

Shoaib, however, appeared in a combative mode. He has told another Pakistani newspaper that certain lobbies were trying to run him down. 

?Instead of helping me out in difficult times... The lobbies of my own country work against me and try to run me down,? Shoaib was quoted as saying by local daily The Nation. (PTI)

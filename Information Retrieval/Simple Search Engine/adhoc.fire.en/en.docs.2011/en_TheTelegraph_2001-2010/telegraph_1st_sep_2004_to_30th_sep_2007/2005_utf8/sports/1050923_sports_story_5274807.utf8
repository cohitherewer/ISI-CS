The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Pawar camp knew everything

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials were clueless about the travel plans of the two outstation observers ? Justice (retd) K. N. Singh and Justice (retd) M. M. Punchi ? but the Sharad Pawar camp knew just about everything. 

Both have held the countrys highest judicial office. 

In fact, key backer Lalit Modi is understood to have spoken to them soon after they landed from New Delhi and took it upon himself to personally receive Justice Punchi (and escort him to a room) when he reached the hotel hosting the AGM. 

Justice Singh came around half-an-hour later. 

Actually, it wasnt only Modi, but his lawyers as well who featured in the welcoming act. There was, however, no sign of anybody from the BCCI. 

Im the joint-secretary, but wasnt told anything by anybody... The BCCI president and secretary didnt receive any information either... I find it extraordinary, Goutam Das Gupta told The Telegraph. 

Well, despite being in alien territory, the Pawar camp organised itself remarkably. 

Incidentally, Justice Punchi stays in Chandigarh and was preparing for a post-lunch nap when he started getting calls that he would have to rush to Calcutta. 

After two flights, one of which was delayed, he looked tired.

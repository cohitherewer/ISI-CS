San Diego: Tiger Woods broke out of his title slump on Sunday, firing a final round four-under 68 to claim the Buick Invitational by a three-stroke margin over Americans Tom Lehman and Charles Howell III and Britain?s Luke Donald. 

Playing with an intensity that made him golf?s most feared competitor but was missing for large stretches of last season, Woods clawed his way to the top leaderboard on the final day and refused to be dislodged. 

Woods finished on 16-under-par 272 to collect his third win at the picturesque Torrey Pines Country Club here. 

Despite having lost seven pounds and being weakened by flu, Woods? steady performance in difficult conditions confirmed his swing overhaul is now complete and that he is ready to reclaim the No. 1 ranking he surrendered to Fiji?s Vijai Singh last season. 

The victory was the 41st Tour win of Woods? career but his first strokeplay triumph since the WGC in October 2003. 

?It feels great, especially today, as long as it was,? said Woods, who played 31 holes in total after starting the day by completing his fog-delayed third round. 

?The start I got off to this morning, it wasn?t very good, but I hung in there. 

?I?m tired now. Losing that much weight for me, I just don?t have the stamina. But I walked slower this afternoon. So I took my time and just tried to keep myself fed and try to eat as much as I possibly could to keep my energy. 

?It?s hard to believe it?s been that long to win on our Tour, but it feels great.? 

Singh faltered in his final round to finish well back at five-under 283. (Reuters)

 Langer ruled out of second Test vs WI

Sydney: Injured Australia batsman Justin Langer has been ruled out of the second Test against the West Indies starting in Hobart on November 17. 

Langer missed the series opener in Brisbane after breaking a rib and the condition has not sufficiently improved. 

It is disappointing to miss a Test match, but I have to consider the best interests of the team and whilst I continue pushing so hard to be right, I am not allowing myself to heal, he said on Tuesday. 

It is different from past injuries in that the bone is actually broken. I need to give it a break and allow it to mend so that I can be ready for the rest of the season. 

Langer is the second Australia player to succumb to injury this week. 

Allrounder Shane Watson has been ruled out of the rest of the season after dislocating his shoulder in Australias 379-run win over the West Indies in the first Test.

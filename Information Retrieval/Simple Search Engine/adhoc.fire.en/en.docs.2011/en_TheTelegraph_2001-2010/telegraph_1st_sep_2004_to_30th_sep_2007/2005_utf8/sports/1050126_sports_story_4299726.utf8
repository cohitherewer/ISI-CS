 Mourinho denies criticising Beckham

London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insisted he had not criticised England captain David Beckham following weekend press reports he would not sign the Real Madrid midfielder. 

The Premiership leaders? boss has criticised the Spanish giants? policy of buying up star players. But Chelsea?s Portuguese chief, speaking ahead of his side?s League Cup semi-final second leg away to Beckham?s former club Manchester United at Old Trafford Wednesday, maintained Monday that no personal slight was intended. 

?David Beckham is someone I respect as a man and as a player. He is the captain of England and has been a European champion. I have never been critical of him and reports that imply that are totally incorrect as I have never made any comments directly about him.?

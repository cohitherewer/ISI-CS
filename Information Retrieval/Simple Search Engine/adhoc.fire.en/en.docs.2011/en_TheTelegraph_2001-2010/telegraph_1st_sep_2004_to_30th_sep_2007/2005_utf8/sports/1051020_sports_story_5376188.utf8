 Bracken discovers English weapon

Sydney: Australian fast bowler Nathan Bracken suspects a mint sweet could have been the secret weapon behind Englands stunning Ashes victory. 

Australias batsmen were baffled by the way Englands bowlers, particularly Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones, were able to make the ball reverse swing when their own paceman could not. 

Bracken, a regular on the English County circuit, believes he may have unwrapped the mystery that played a significant part in Australias 1-2 series loss. 

It is just a breath mint you put in your mouth but it makes your saliva very sugary and that is being talked about being used over there, he told reporters in Australia on Wednesday. 

Every team has lollies and things like that, we had all our lollies checked before the first game to make sure there was nothing illegal that we had. 

When I was playing at Gloucester a couple of years ago, as soon as we needed the ball to go Irish, the captain would call and they would bring out some of these mints and it would work. 

There is no suggestion Englands players broke any rules as players are permitted to apply saliva and sweat to polish the ball. (REUTERS)

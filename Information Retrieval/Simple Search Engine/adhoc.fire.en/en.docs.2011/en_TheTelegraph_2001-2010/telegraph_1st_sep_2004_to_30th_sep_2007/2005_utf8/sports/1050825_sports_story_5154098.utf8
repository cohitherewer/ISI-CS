Bulawayo: Opener Lou Vincent smashed the highest one-day score by a New Zealander as the Black Caps flirted with a world record total before thrashing Zimbabwe by 192 runs in a triangular series match on Wednesday. 

Vincent top-scored with 172 in a New Zealand total of 397 for five in 44 overs before Zimbabwe were dismissed for 205 in 43 overs. 

The match, the first in a triangular series also involving India, was reduced to 44 overs per side after the start was delayed by a damp pitch. 

Had New Zealand faced their full quota of 50 overs, Sri Lankas world record total of 398 for five against Kenya in Kandy in 1996 would surely have been erased. 

New Zealand hit 39 fours and 16 sixes, a total of 252 runs in boundaries, while Zimbabwe fast bowler Andy Blignauts return of two for 96 in nine overs was the third most expensive in one-day history. 

The 349 for nine New Zealand made against India in Rajkot in 1999-00 was their previous highest innings. 

Vincent attacked the bowling from the outset and his maiden century, which included 16 fours and nine sixes in 119 balls, surpassed Glenn Turners 171 not out against East Africa in a 60-over match at the 1975 World Cup. 

Vincent and captain Stephen Fleming, who scored 93, shared an opening stand of 204 ? the biggest partnership by New Zealand for any wicket. 

Fleming had also held the previous record of 193 with Nathan Astle against Pakistan in 2001. 

Zimbabwe squandered a chance to dismiss Fleming for eight in the sixth over when debutant Anthony Ireland, fielding at mid-off, dived forward but dropped a catch which would have earned a wicket for mediumpacer Blessing Mahwire.

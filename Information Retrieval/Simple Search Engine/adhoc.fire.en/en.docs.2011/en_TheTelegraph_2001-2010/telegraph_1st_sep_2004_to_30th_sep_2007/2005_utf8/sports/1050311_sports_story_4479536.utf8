 Sarasota (Florida): Martina Navratilova is suing the sponsor of a credit card directly marketed to gays and lesbians, saying it uses her name and likeness after her request last month to stop.

 Navratilova is seeking at least $75,000 in damages from Do Tell, inc, which offers the rainbow card. The card helps fund the non-profit Rainbow coalition, which promotes the health and social well being of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

 Do Tell had used Navratilova to market the card since 1995 with the tennis star?s permission, said the suit, filed on Monday. But in late 2004, Navratilova came at odds with the card?s marketing, which she called ?inappropriate and repugnant.? 

 Brussels: Former world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne says she will return to competition at the Miami Open which starts on March 23.

 The Belgian injured her right knee while preparing for the Australian Open in January and has not played since losing in the fourth round of the US Open in September having battled a mystery illness for much of last year.

 ?It?s already her fourth week of training and she feels good. She has no more pain in her right knee,? a statement said on her official website.

 ?Given the circumstances, Justine has decided to resume competition in Miami, which starts on March 23.? 

 Bangkok: Thai kickboxing officials want former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson to come to Thailand and learn the national sport, the nation newspaper reported on Thursday.

 The World Boxing Council-Muaythai, recently formed to promote the sport and to hold title fights around the world, has been speaking to Tyson?s representatives and will travel to Las Vegas to meet Tyson, the paper said. ?He likes Muaythai, and he?s being encouraged to make the switch,? a senior official involved in the talks with Tyson said.

 Caracas (Venezuela): Venezuela?s gutsy bid to reach the 2006 World Cup finals may come to an abrupt end this month unless the country?s soccer federation obeys a March 19 Fifa deadline to hold elections for a new leadership, officials said on Wednesday.

 National team coach Richard Paez appealed to the Venezuelan Football Federation and the country?s Supreme Court to urgently solve a dispute that has twice forced the postponement of elections to appoint a new federation president and executive.

 Fifa warned the Venezuelan federation on Tuesday that unless it held the scheduled elections by March 19, it will be barred from taking part in international events.

 This would put Venezuela out of the ongoing World Cup qualifying tournament. ?We hope that everything will be resolved in the best possible way for the good of Venezuelan football,? Paez said.

 Paris: American Lance Armstrong has pulled out of the Paris-Nice race with a sore throat, his Discovery team said.

 Armstrong, six-times winner of the Tour de France, will return to his training camp in Spain.

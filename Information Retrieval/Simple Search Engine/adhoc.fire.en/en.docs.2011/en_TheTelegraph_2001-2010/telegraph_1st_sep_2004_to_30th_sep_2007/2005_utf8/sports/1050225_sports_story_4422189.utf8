The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sania sets modest target

New Delhi: She has conquered a billion Indian hearts during the past five weeks, but Sania Mirza?s head is still firmly on her shoulder. 

After Melbourne and Hyderabad, Sanis?s next destination is Dubai where she has got a wild card for next week?s Tier II WTA event. The Hyderabad teenager has set a modest target for herself ? to win the first round of the $585,000 meet. 

?My aim is to win the first round, I am not looking much beyond at the moment,? the 18-year old said on Thursday. 

?It is a very big tournament for me. The top 30 players will be competing in Dubai, including world No. 1 (Lindsay) Davenport. It?s going to be tough for me, and my aim will be to win the first round,? said the 98th-ranked Sania. 

The left ankle that she injured in mid-January still bothers her although the right one that she twisted while playing in Hyderabad has completely healed. 

?The preparations has been going on well. The ankle 

still bothers me, but it is not a major concern,? she said.

 Force may claim Derby 

 HONKY DORY

 Rising Force is fancied to lift the 2,000m Nanoli Stud Pune Derby, the star attraction of the season and the main-race in Sundays nine-event card. 

 The Alnasr Alwasheek-Adams Treasure colt displayed his penchant for the distance of ground during the Bangalore summer season. In one of his outings, though the S. Ganapathy-trainee went down to Formal Invitation, he, however, advertised his superior class. Formal Invitation, it may be recalled, went on to stretch Al Qamar and Star Angel, in his subsquent start. B. Prakash partners Rising Force.

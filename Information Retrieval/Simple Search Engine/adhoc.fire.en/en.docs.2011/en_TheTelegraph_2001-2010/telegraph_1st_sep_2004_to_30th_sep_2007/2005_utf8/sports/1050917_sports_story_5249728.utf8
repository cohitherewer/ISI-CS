The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No support for Greg Chappell 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: Greg Chappell asking Sourav Ganguly to step down on the eve of the first Test in Bulawayo will go down as something unprecedented in the annals of Indian cricket. Much will be debated upon in the next few days. 

The Telegraph spoke to three former India coaches to get their views on how they would have settled matters if they were in Greg Chappells shoes. 

The following are excerpts: 

Ajit Wadekar: I would have never done anything like that. The team wasnt doing too badly and the captain was just going through a bad patch. The captain needed support and anything contrary would have been damaging. It could also have ruined team spirit? The coach telling the captain that I have no faith in your abilities is simply not on. 

Im not aware of the circumstances that forced Greg to say this, but it was most unfortunate. Being an Australian, hes not aware of our culture? that Indians are emotional and sentimental. Against Zimbabwe, who are no better than a club side, theres no point talking about team balance. What Sourav needed most was confidence and support before the start of a series. 

Greg is a pro and knows well he will be held accountable for the teams performance. I feel he got a bit carried away and didnt bother to keep in mind Souravs performances over the years. (Its) more like the slam bang way the Australians play? 

Madanlal: I would have never asked Sourav to step down. I dont support Greg simply because asking the captain to relinquish his post before the start of a series is not done. If Greg had no confidence in the captain, then he could have asked him to do so at the end of the series. 

But why should Sourav resign? What he does is his own prerogative and should not be dictated by others, least of all, the coach. 

The whole problem seems very strange. The situation should have been handled more delicately. 

I would have sorted out the problem differently. If Mohammed Kaif was to be included, Yuvraj Singh could have been dropped. A captain should never be made scapegoat. It can spoil harmony among the players. 

Aunshuman Gaekwad: I am currently in London and not following what has happened. So, it wont be proper for me to make a comment.

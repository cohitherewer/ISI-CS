 Gatlin on course for 200m gold

Helsinki: World 100 m champion Justin Gatlin expended only the minimum energy required to qualify for the second round of the 200m Tuesday in a low key start to his bid for a rare global sprint double. 

Maurice Greene is the only man to win both titles in the 22 years of the world championships while Carl Lewis in 1984 was the last Olympic double champion. 

Gatlin, who finished third in his heat, said he was still tired after winning the 100m Sunday by the widest ever margin at a world championships. I was trying to conserve energy, he said. 

Olympic 400 champion Jeremy Wariner and his training partner Darold Williamson had to contend with strong winds during their first round heats following Monday nights torrential rain. 

Williamson, who won his heat in 45.97 seconds, said he had not expected to have to run so hard. Coming off the curve it was very windy and all I could do was fight to the finish line, he said. 

Monday, Lauryn Williams tore through wind and pelting rain to complete a 100 m double for the US on the third day (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Williams, the surprise silver medallist at last years Athens Olympics, clocked 10.93 seconds to join mens gold medallist Justin Gatlin as a world champion. 

Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele stepped on to the track for the first and last time at this years championships to retain the mens 10,000 title. 

Swede Kajsa Bergqvist soared to an effortless victory in the womens high jump and Dorcus Inzikuru won the inaugural womens steeplechase to give Uganda their first world title.

 Narain Karthikeyan again in poor way

 - Tyre safety problem spews pull-out spectre; Trulli grabs pole

Indianapolis: Tyre safety fears and the threat of teams refusing to race hung over Sundays US Grand Prix after Italian Jarno Trulli seized Toyotas first pole position in Formula One. 

Trulli, whose teammate Ralf Schumacher was ruled out after a heavy crash in Friday practice, lapped the famed Indianapolis Brickyard circuit in one minute 10.625 seconds in Saturdays qualifying. 

He was 0.069 quicker than McLarens on-form Finn Kimi Raikkonen. 

Indias Narain Karthikeyans poor form stayed that way when he finished a near-rock-bottom 19th for Jordan (1:13.776), with teammate Tiago Monteiro of Portugal ahead at 17th (1:13.462). 

Even Christijan Albers (Netherlands) of Minardi, qualified at 18th, ahead of Narain who had said on Friday that he was satisfied with his performance. 

The Toyota celebrations were muted however after unexplained tyre failures in their cars in Friday practice raised the spectre of Michelin-equipped teams deciding to pull out for safety reasons. 

Michelin supply seven of the 10 teams, with champions Ferrari with struggling Jordan and Minardi on Bridgestone. 

Trullis success meant Ferrari, without a win in nine races, were not in pole position at a US Grand Prix at Indianapolis for the first time. 

However Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher will start fifth with championship leader Fernando Alonso alongside on the third row. Briton Jenson Button was third for BAR with Renaults Giancarlo Fisichella fourth. 

It has been a difficult time for everybody here, especially for us, said Trulli after his third career pole. We came here with a lot of expectations and then on Friday had two crashes...for sure weve had a weekend of mixed emotions up to now. 

Ralfs crash and that of Toyota test driver Ricardo Zonta, who will replace him for the race, were both due to sudden loss of tyre pressure. 

Michelin ordered new tyres to be flown in from France, while they analysed the old ones, and sought a special dispensation to use them. 

That request triggered an immediate controversy, with teams obliged to use the same tyres for qualifying and the race. Michelin also asked teams to raise tyre pressures as a safety precaution, a move that affected both performance and handling. 

McLarens Ron Dennis said he did not expect the situation to be clarified until late on Sunday morning. 

Renault boss Flavio Briatore declared however that Alonso and Fisichella would not race unless Michelin were allowed to use the new tyres. The safety of our drivers remains our number one priority, he said. 

Alonso leads Raikkonen in the standings by 22 points with 11 races, including Indianapolis, remaining. 

If Michelin is happy to run tomorrow, were happy and confident to run with them, said Alonso. If Michelin said it was not safe, then the drivers would agree not to race. But this is an extreme option and this will not happen, never. Im sure we will be okay. (Reuters)

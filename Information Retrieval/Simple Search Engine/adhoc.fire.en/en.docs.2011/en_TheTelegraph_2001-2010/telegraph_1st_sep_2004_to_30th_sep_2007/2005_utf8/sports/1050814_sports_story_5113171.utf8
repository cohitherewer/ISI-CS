 United begin campaign with 2-0 win

 - PREMIER LEAGUE 

London: Goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney either side of halftime gave Manchester United a 2-0 win at Everton in the opening game of the Premier League on Saturday. 

Despite taking most of the first half to find their feet, United were eventually deserved winners as they begin their campaign to improve on last seasons disappointing third-place finish in a rare trophy-less season. 

The teams went in following contrasting fortunes on Tuesday when they kicked off their competitive seasons in the third qualifying round of the Champions League. While United secured a 3-0 home win over Hungarian champions Debrecen, Evertons first European match in ten years ended with a disappointing 1-2 home defeat by Villarreal. 

Everton though, as they had in midweek, started full of energy and had the best of the early chances. 

Uniteds new goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar did well to block a Tim Cahill header after 21 minutes, and 13 minutes later Marcus Bent sent a deflected volley against the bar. 

United had struggled to piece much together throughout the half but took the lead after their best move in the 43rd minute. 

Rooney neatly made space in the middle before feeding Shea, whose low cross from the left was expertly turned in by Van Nistelrooy from close range. 

The game was settled inside the first minute of the second half when Rooney scored his first goal at Everton for United since swapping Goodison Park for Old Trafford a year ago. 

Everton centre back Joseph Yobo played a suicidal square ball behind his fellow defenders and into the path of Rooney, who calmly slotted it beyond Nigel Martyn. 

Everton never looked likely to recover and another Cahill header, again blocked by Van der Sar, was their best effort of the second half. 

Korean Park Ji-sung, Uniteds other main close-season signing, got two chances to increase the lead but failed to find the target while Gary Neville hit the side-netting from close range in injury time. 

A ray of hope for Everton is that a year ago they lost 1-4 at home to Arsenal in their first match but went on to finish an unexpected fourth.

 We want McGrath to play: Bell

 We can handle McGrath, says Bell 

London: England want Australias phenomenal opening bowler Glenn McGrath to play in the deciding fifth Ashes Test next week, according to Ian Bell. 

Whatever happens, if McGrath is fit we can handle him, Englands number four batsman told a news conference at Lords on Thursday. 

We have a belief in the changing room that no matter who is on the park, we can keep playing our game. 

It would be nice to see McGrath playing at The Oval so that we can regain the Ashes with the best team on the park. That would be the best thing for us. 

England lead the five-match series 2-1. McGrath was the Man of the Match in Australias victory in the first Test but he missed the second Test with an ankle injury, then the fourth with an elbow problem. 

Bell was at Lords in the run-up to Saturdays C amp;G final between Warwickshire and Hampshire. 

Bell and England teammate Ashley Giles are set to play for Warwickshire, with Kevin Pietersen in the Hampshire line-up for the limited-overs encounter. 

We dont talk about any aura or anything about McGrath, Bell added. We have our game plans and although we know he is a fantastic, class performer, there is no chat about anything else. 

Bell said Saturdays final at Lords would be a welcome break from the intensity of the Ashes. 

I still think about England all the time, but as a county cricketer any time you get to go to Lords it is a big day. 

Meanwhile, Australia paceman Shaun Tait, who is undergoing treatment for a shoulder problem, has been cleared for the final test at The Oval next week. 

The 22-year-old, who made his five-day debut in the fourth Test loss to England at Trent Bridge, has been cleared of serious injury after undergoing scans at a London clinic. 

Team physio Errol Alcott reported Tait was suffering mild shoulder soreness.

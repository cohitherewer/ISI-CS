The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia flies off to Malaysia

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia made an appearance in the city on Wednesday before flying off to Malaysia at night, but did not reply to East Bengals contract queries. 

East Bengal, who claimed to have made a significant breakthrough in clinching a deal with the striker on Sunday, sent both an SMS and e-mail to him, detailing the finer aspec-ts of the likely contract. Till late Wednesday night, there was no response from Bhaich-ung. 

He made a surprise return to the city from Delhi, where he had gone to get his Malaysian visa processed, and even had a light practice session at the SAI complex, under coach Shibaji Sengupta and later, national under-19 coach Aloke Mukherjee. He was not available for comment.

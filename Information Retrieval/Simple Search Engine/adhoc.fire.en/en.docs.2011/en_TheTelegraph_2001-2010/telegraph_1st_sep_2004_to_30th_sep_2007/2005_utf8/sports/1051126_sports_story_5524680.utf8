The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Seeds keep up winning streak

A CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: Seeded players maintained their winning streak at the end of the third round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at the Kanaklata Indoor Stadium here on Friday. 

Playing white, top seed Kh Sanjoy Singh of Khurai Sajor Lekai School, Imphal, adopted the closed variation of Sicilian Defence versus Krishnashis Gogoi of Srimanta Shankar Academy, Guwahati. Faced with lesser known variations of the game, Krishnashish could not handle the opening moves properly, allowing Sanjoy right from the 25th move to deliver checks. Finally, Sanjoy checkmated Krishnashis in the 33rd move. 

Third seed Lairenjam Shakespeare of Luis English School, Imphal, employed the Trompovsky attack to register a facile victory over Rishideep Bordoloi of Delhi Public School, Duliajan, in 44 moves. 

Handling black pieces, fourth seed Ashim Roy of Ramkrishna Vivekananda Vidya Mandir, Agartala chose the Phildors Defence to usual Ruy Lopez against Tanmoi Das Kashyap of Faculty HS School, Guwahati. Though Tanmoi followed the book for a dozen moves or so, Ashims tactical onslaught made his opponent falter in the middle game. On the 34th move, Tanmoi threw in the towel.

 Mukesh Kumar at the RCGC on Friday 

Calcutta: Mukesh Kumar proved his class once again as he marched to a four-stroke title triumph in the Eastern India Open at the RCGC Open Friday. This was his third success on the Amby Valley Tour?s 2004-05 season and his first at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. 

Mukesh also regained the top spot on the Tour?s order of merit. His earnings for the season went up to Rs 10,09,710 in 11 events, Rs 50,846 clear of Ashok Kumar. 

Vijay Kumar finished second after a fine two-under 70, to earn a cheque for Rs 1,12,000. 

With a three-shot lead over Rafiqe Ali, going into the final round, Mukesh attacked from the outset. When Rafiqe bogeyed the third, Mukesh?s lead was five shots. 

Then Rafiqe?s two birdies cut the lead to three shots. That was before Rafique bogeyed the seventh and double bogeyed the ninth. Mukesh did bogey the ninth, though. 

On the return path Mukesh consolidated his position till the title win, his first at the RCGC.

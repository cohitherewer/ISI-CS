 Mahela to skip 4th ODI due to marriage

Mumbai: Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardene will miss a game of the one-day series in India in order to get married, a team official said on Wednesday. Jayawardene will fly home during the series to marry long time girlfriend Christina Sirisena. 

Jayawardene, 28, will skip game four of the seven-match series, to be played in Pune next Thursday, to be in Colombo that day for his marriage to a tourism executive. 

Sri Lanka team manager Michael Tissera said the middle-order batsman would re-join the team for the fifth match in Ahmedabad on November 6. 

Sirisena has a Danish mother and has also studied in India. The couple met about two years ago and were engaged in March. 

Now, Jayawardene would leave for Colombo on Monday after the match in Jaipur and rejoin his teammates in time for the fifth game of the series in Ahmedabad, a day-nighter, Tissera said. (Agencies)

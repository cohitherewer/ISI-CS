 Md. Sp. inch closer to qualifying 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Mohammedan Sporting brought themselves close to qualifying for the top tier when they notched up their second successive win in the ongoing second division National Football League (NFL) match at the Keenan Stadium on Monday. 

A 3-1 win over Air India on Monday followed a 2-1 victory against Punjab Police in the opener. The picture about their qualification will be clear on Tuesday, after Bangalore outfit HAL will take on Punjab Police. 

Malswama put Biswajit Bhattacharyas side ahead when his deft left-footer found the net in the 16th minute. Air India equalised a minute from the breather through Paresh Shaivalkar. Jiten Rai made it 2-1 for the Calcutta team in the 63rd minute. Raman Vijayan then completed the formalities in the 76th minute.

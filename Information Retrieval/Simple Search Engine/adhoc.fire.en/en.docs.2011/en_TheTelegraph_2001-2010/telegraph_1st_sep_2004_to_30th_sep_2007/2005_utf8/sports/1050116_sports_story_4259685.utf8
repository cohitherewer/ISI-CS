 Focus on line and length, Inzy tells Shoaib

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Hobart: World?s two fastest bowlers will clash in Hobart on Sunday, but Pakistan?s Shoaib Akhtar has been warned by his skipper not to get caught up in a pace race with Australian Brett Lee. 

The two speedsters will spearhead the attacks for their teams when they meet in the second tri-series one-day game at Bellerive Oval ? Australia crushed the West Indies by 116 runs in the opening fixture in Melbourne Friday. But Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, himself under pressure, has made his feelings clear to Shoaib about his priorities. 

While he conceded a Lee-Shoaib showdown was an exciting prospect, Inzamam urged the Pakistani star to remember his rhythm on what is likely to be a good batting wicket. His main thing is to concentrate on line and length and how he performs, and not his competition on speed,? he said. ?It?s not a game of speed, he?s (Shoaib) definitely the world?s fastest bowler, but the main thing is line, length and swing.? 

Shoaib bowled the fastest delivery ever recorded at 161 kmph (100 mph) in the third Test against New Zealand in Lahore in April, 2002. 

For his part, Lee, who bowled at speeds of 150 kmph (94 mph) in his brilliant three for 36 spell on return to the national team against the West Indies, said he knew Shoaib could not resist the temptation to bowl fast. ?I was watching (some) of that Twenty20 match in Adelaide and Shoaib bowled a couple of real quick 130, 140, 150 kmph outswingers, which got Brad Haddin out,? he said. 

?I think when the crowd gets there and he?s pretty fired up I?m sure he?ll be steaming ahead. There is always talk when myself and Shoaib get the chance to play each other. 

?But the most important thing I?ve said time and time again is, it?s not just speed, it?s about taking wickets and doing well for your team.? (AFP)

 Churchill hope to upset Sporting

 Churchill fortunes will depend on Yakubu?s form 

Margao: A confident Churchill Brothers are looking to upset in-form Sporting Clube de Goa when they play their last match of the first phase of the National Football League for ONGC Cup at Nehru Stadium here Wednesday. 

Churchill Brothers president Joaquim Alemao said his team would draw inspiration from their improved performance in their last two drawn matches against Fransa Pax and Dempo, who are in contention for the title. 

Churchill are at the bottom of the table with seven points from 10 matches and are struggling to avoid relegation. 

?Sporting are a strong side who are playing well with Dudu Omagbemi at his best. We really need to play to our potential to win,? Alemao stated. 

?We have the capability but we need to play as a team and a bit of luck to collect full points. For this, Yusif Yakubu and Marcos Pereira along with I.M. Vijayan will have to perform,? Alemao added. 

Yakubu who has scored over 50 goals in the NFL, is having a lean patch. The hamstring injury to his right leg is cause of worry as it has been affecting his performance. 

Sporting, who are at seventh place with 14 points from eight matches, has maintained consistency in their play. With Dudu and Chidi combining well upfront and Adebayo, Joseph Periera, Bibiano Fernandes giving them good support, Churchill defenders are sure to have a tough time. 

?The match will be exciting and we have geared up ourselves to garner full points. We know that Churchill Brothers are struggling to find their form but they have good foreigners upfront who can tear away any defence on their given day,? stated Peter Vaz, president of Sporting Clube de Goa.

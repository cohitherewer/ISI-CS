The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Amelie wins crown

Brussels: French top seed Amelie Mauresmo won the Antwerp Diamond Games title on Sunday with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 win over Venus Williams. 

Mauresmo clinched a hard-fought victory over the third-seeded American on her fifth match-point with a forehand winner. 

?This was a great final for a great tournament,? the Frenchwoman smiled. ?It is incredible in Antwerp, the Sportpaleis is always full, every night with great audiences. 

?I am so happy because the quality of my game went up and up during the whole week until the final... this is the result of all the work I have done with my coach.? 

Fellow former world No. 1 Williams was gracious in defeat. 

?Amelie deserves her win today? she said. ?She played so well.? 

Williams had been gunning for a third career title at the Belgian indoor tournament having won on both of her previous visits to Antwerp in 2002 and 2003. 

Victory would have seen her take home a golden racket encrusted with 1,700 diamonds. 

But despite a bright start she was beaten for the first time at the event and missed her chance to end an 11-tournament drought without a title ? the longest of her career. 

On Saturday, Venus Williams outgunned Anastasia Myskina 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, while Amelie Mauresmo beat Australian Alicia Molik 6-3, 7-6 in the semi-finals. (Reuters)

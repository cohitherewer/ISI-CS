The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav, India will hit back: Dravid

Kochi: Team India vice-captain Rahul Dravid Wednesday said India will come back strongly in the ensuing ODI series and also backed skipper Sourav Ganguly as a man who will be back in form quickly. 

?It is a little disappointing to lose the last Test, but that is over. One-day (game) is totally different. We have to look ahead and be positive. We can put up a good performance in the one-day series,? he told reporters on the sidelines of a painting exhibition by his mother Pushpa here. 

India went down by 168 runs in the final Test in Bangalore and allowed the visitors to level the three-match series 1-1. 

The first ODI is scheduled to be held here Saturday. 

On his skipper?s form, Dravid said: ?Sourav has been around for ten years playing lot of cricket. He knows exactly what he needs to do and he is working at it,? he said. 

?All of us undergo difficult patches in our careers. I do not think there is anything I need to tell him... He knows exactly what he needs to do.? 

Dravid said he had mixed feelings about his own form in the series. ?I had a good match in Calcutta and am happy about that. I did not do well in Bangalore. 

?It was pretty disappointing when the team loses since you will feel if you had made a few more runs the team could have done well.? (PTI)

 Sydney: Defending Australian Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne withdrew from the first Grand Slam of the year Saturday because of a knee injury, officials said. Craig Gabriel, a spokesman for the Sydney International, said that Henin-Hardenne had pulled out of the Sydney event and the Australian Open beginning January 17 because of the injury.

 ?She apparently hurt her knee just before New Year?s eve while training in Florida,? Gabriel said.

 Henin-Hardenne was also defending champion in Sydney. On Thursday, fellow Belgian player Kim Clijsters, who lost to Henin-Hardenne in the final last year at Melbourne Park, also confirmed she would not be coming due to a left wrist injury.

 Auckland: Slovakia?s Katarina Srebotnik beat doubles partner Shinbou Asagoe of Japan 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 Saturday to win the ASB women?s classic final. The unseeded Srebotnik fought back from a set and 0-4 down to beat the fourth-seeded Asagoe in two hours and 20 minutes for her third WTA title.

 Momentum in the match changed when Srebotnik left the court at 0-3 in the second set to receive medical treatment for a thigh injury. Asagoe won the next game to lead 4-0, but Srebotnik, both physically and mentally revived, reeled of the next five games then broke serve to take the set. Srebotnik first served for the match at 5-3 in the third set, dropped serve, then broke Asagoe to take the title on her fifth championship point.

 New York: Ty Votaw will step down as commissioner of the LPGA Tour at the end of the season after overseeing seven years of extraordinary growth in women?s professional golf, he said on Friday. 

 When Votaw was named commissioner in March 1999 there were 12 LPGA tournaments with purses of at least $1 million or more but this season the schedule features 30 and there are four events offering at least $2 million.

 During Votaw?s seven-year tenure the average purse rose from just over $840,000 in 1999 to $1.4 million in 2005, with total prize money of $45 million this season, the most in LPGA history.

 Gaza: The Palestinian Football Association signed Israeli Arab Azmi Nassar as their new national team coach on Saturday on a two-year contract. Nassar had been in line for the position for several weeks but he was able to secure a deal with his new employers only after the Israeli authorities last week allowed him to travel to occupied Gaza. Israelis are barred from travelling to Gaza, a territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War, due to fears for their safety. Nassar was given special permission to go there after senior Israeli political figures intervened on his behalf. ?I am very proud because my work with the Palestinian soccer team is not just a job but a national service,? Nassar said during the signing ceremony at the Palestinian Olympic Committee headquarters in Gaza.

Manchester: Former Australian batsman Stuart Law, who plays 

county cricket for Lancashire, has been granted British citizenship after deciding 

to make his move to the United Kingdom permanent. ?I am glad that its happened 

quickly and with no problems. I can now start the new year as an English player,? 

said Law.

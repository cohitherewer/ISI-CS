The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No problem with Sourav, says Lloyd

 - 13 months after Eden, paths yet to cross 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Chennai: There has been no play on the first two days at the Chepauk and, so far, no opportunity for Clive Lloyd and Sourav Ganguly to cross each others path. The longest-serving Match Referee, however, maintains he doesnt have a problem with the former Indian captain. 

Lloyd, it may be recalled, banned Sourav for two Tests as India were way behind on the over-rate during the November 2004 Platinum Jubilee ODI against Pakistan (at the Eden). Subsequently, appeals commissioner Tim Castle overturned the punishment. 

I dont have a problem with Ganguly... Id only followed the rule book... He was entitled to appeal and it got upheld... Clearly, I didnt have anything personal then and there cant be anything personal now, Lloyd, assigned the three-Test series versus Sri Lanka, told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

This is the legendary West Indians first assignment featuring India since that one-off ODI. Usually, if not on the ground, players and match officials do bump into each other at the team hotel. For this Test, though, the teams and officials havent been accommodated together.

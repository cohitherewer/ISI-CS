Paris: A hattrick by Brazilian superstar Ronaldinho handed Barcelona a comfortable 4-1 victory over Italian side Udinese in the second round of Champions League group matches. 

There was much-needed relief for Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who saw his side rebound from a 1-2 defeat to Blackburn Rovers at the weekend by beating Benfica 2-1 at home, Ruud Van Nistelrooy grabbing a late winner. 

Arsenal stayed top of Group B with a 2-1 win over Ajax in Amsterdam thanks to an early strike from Fredrik Ljungberg and a second half penalty from Robert Pires. 

Juventus were convincing winners, thumping Rapid Vienna 3-0 in their Group A match at the Stadio Delle Alpi with goals from David Trezeguet, Adrian Mutu and Zlatan Ibrahimovic although there were only 11,156 fans there to see them do it. 

Bayern Munich continued the domination of the big guns in that group with a 1-0 win over Club Bruges in Munich where Martin Demichelis scored the only goal after 32 minutes. 

There was an outstanding victory by Swiss minnows Thun, who beat Sparta Prague, thanks to a last minute goal by Selver Hozdic. 

Ronaldinho was in masterful form scoring from a freekick, a beautiful slide rule shot from the edge of the box and a late penalty to round off his performance. 

He was in such generous form that he handed his shirt to Udinese coach Serse Cosmi ? whose side were not helped by leaving recalcitrant Italian international striker Vincenzo Iaquinta at home and then being reduced to 10 men for most of the second-half with Vidigal being sent off ? afterwards for a gift for his son. 

It was a kind gesture from Ronaldinho, though if hed scored fewer goals then Id have happily lost out on the shirt! joked Cosmi. 

Although Ronaldinho scored a hattrick, it was the clubs Argentine youngster Lionel Messi who attracted the biggest cheer of the night from the Nou Camp faithful. 

During another glittering performance in the Champions League the 18-year-old forward provided yet more evidence to support the comparisons being drawn with the great Diego Maradona. 

Messi created Barcelonas first scoring chance when he skipped across the edge of the area and forced a fine save from Udinese keeper Morgan Di Sanctis.Four minutes later he was brought down just outside the area by a desperate Jose Vidigal after he had surged through the Udinese midfield to win the free kick from which Ronaldinho gave Barcelona the lead. 

The youngster also had a hand in Barcelonas second, winning the ball in midfield and slipping a superb pass down the right flank to Samuel Eto who cut the ball back into the area for Ronaldinho to steer into the corner. 

He showed what a talented player he is once again and demonstrated his dynamism, pace and acceleration, said coach Frank Rijkaard.Although he has played in the Champions League for Barcelona, Messi has not been permitted to play in the Primera Liga because the club has already filled its permitted quota of three non-European Union players. 

But the news that he was granted Spanish citizenship on Monday means that he will now be able to showcase his skills in the domestic league as well. 

Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson shrugged aside criticism of his sides tactics against a Benfica side that probably merited a draw. 

We did exactly the same thing on Saturday (the defeat by Blackburn) as we did tonight and no, I am not going to explain myself, said Ferguson.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was in a more positive frame of mind than his bitter rival after seeing his side record their second successive victory in the campaign. 

He was especially impressed by England defender Sol Campbell, who had a nightmare season last term culminating with being left out of the side that won the FA Cup. 

I think what you saw tonight was the Sol of 2003-04. He was terrific, purred the Frenchman. 

Campbell, who returned after months on the sidelines with a calf problem in Arsenals opening group B win against FC Thun, was more than satisfied with his form. 

Im ready, as simple as that, he said when asked if he was expecting a call from England manager Sven Goran Eriksson. 

Im coming back, Im fit. Its all coming together. 

If Wenger was over the moon about Campbell, that could not be said for Juventus coach Fabio Capello and his Swedish striker Ibrahimovic. 

While he did get on the scoresheet for Juventus, he was not the toast of Turin as far as Capello was concerned. 

In looking for his first goal of the season he was too selfish, Capello said after his teams second European win in as many matches which moved them closer to the knockout stages. 

On one occasion in the second half when (Alessandro) Del Piero was completely free, he ignored the better option and preferred to shoot. He made several mistakes and we will discuss it.

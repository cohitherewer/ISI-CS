 Sehwag to draw inspiration 

New Delhi: Virender Sehwag said on Wednesday he will take inspiration from Bob Wooler?s comments that the Indian opener?s attacking style resembles that of Sir Donald Bradman. 

?Earlier people compared me with Sachin Tendulkar and now these comments. I am happy and I will surely take inspiration from such comparisons,? Sehwag told reporters here on the sidelines of the launch of ?Shikhar? ? an organisation for social development. 

Woolmer in his column for PTI Tuesday wrote that ?Sehwag must come close to resembling a modern day genius because of his unerring and unnerving ability like Sir Donald to manhandle attacks and make Test match bowlers look like pop gun attacks. For me, he has redefined how an opening batsman can approach an innings. His performances in this recent series have been quite phenomenal.? (PTI)

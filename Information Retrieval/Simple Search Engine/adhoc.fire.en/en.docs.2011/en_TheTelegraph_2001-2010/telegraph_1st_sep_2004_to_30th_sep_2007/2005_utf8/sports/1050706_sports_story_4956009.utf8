The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rupesh comes in for praise 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Steven Host, director of the Bosse Foundation in Boston, is extremely satisfied with the progress Rupesh Roy has made since he joined the academy about three months ago. 

In a letter to the Bengal Tennis Association (BTA), Host observed that the 18-year-old ? who overcame humble beginnings to emerge as a real talent ? has developed a serve which can be a weapon. 

Even his solid backhand has come in for praise. 

Rupesh, who won an ITF junior meet in Philadelphia without dropping a set a fortnight ago, will next be travelling with the academy team (five players and coach Johan Rudant) to Africa for five ITF tournaments. 

According to the academy director, the goal is to push Rupeshs ranking high enough so that he can get a direct entry into the US Open boys event next month. 

Rupeshs world junior ranking has gone up from 307 to 180 since he joined the Bosse Foundation.

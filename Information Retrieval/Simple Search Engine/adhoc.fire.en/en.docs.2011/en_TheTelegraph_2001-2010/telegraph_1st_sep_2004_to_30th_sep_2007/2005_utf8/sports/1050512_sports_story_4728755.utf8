Hamburg: Roger Federer avenged his Olympic defeat by Tomas Berdych on Wednesday, thrashing the Czech teenager 6-2, 6-1 to reach the third round of the Hamburg Masters. 

The world number ones loss to Berdych in the second round of the Athens tournament was one of the shock results of 2004 but the Swiss top seed dominated their rematch on centre court at the Rothenbaum. 

He ruined my Olympic dreams in Athens so its nice to get him back, said Federer. Especially 6-2, 6-1? thats a nice scoreline. 

Federer, the defending champion, will play Spains Tommy Robredo in the last-16 and looks in ominous form as he prepares for the start of the French Open on May 23. The claycourt event is the only one missing from his Grand Slam title collection. 

Federer broke 19-year-old Berdychs serve in the opening game of each set and sealed a 53-minute victory with a decisive backhand volley on his first match-point. It was his 37th win in 39 matches this year. 

Robredo coasted to a 6-3, 6-0 victory over Brazils three-time former French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten, who looked well short of fitness. 

Lying in wait for Federer as a potential quarter-final opponent is Argentine Guillermo Coria, the runner-up in last weeks Rome Masters and at the 2004 French Open. 

The 10th seed sped through to the third round by beating Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-2, 6-3. 

Tim Henman won his all-British duel with Greg Rusedski 7-6, 6-4 in the first meeting between the two on clay. The fifth seed recovered from 3-5 in the first set to record his sixth successive win over Rusedski, the world No. 45, in a match interrupted by rain and played on a wet and breezy court 1. 

Henman hits out 

Hitting out at the state of the outside courts, Henman said: It was very, very difficult. I dont know if Ive ever played in tougher conditions. At the Masters Series, the pinnacle of our Tour, I dont really think those conditions are acceptable. 

I think there should be covers. When the court is sodden like that its very difficult to play the level of tennis everybody feels that they can play in this type of tournament. 

Youve got a fantastic stadium court with the benefit of a roof but besides that, I dont think that court (court 1) is really good enough. At this level the drop-off is not acceptable. 

Henman was also annoyed that he and Rusedski had to sit in the rain during changeovers, rather than being allowed to stand under cover by the courtside.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India?s domination of Asian tennis 

 has come to an end

 - Beating a young inexperienced Chienses team didn't warrant 

 so much jubilation

 Prakash has to curb impatience 

 and develop more consistency in ground shots

 India defeated China 5-0 at New 

 Delhi to move into the semi-finals of the Asia Oceanic Zone 

 Group I of the Davis Cup. A newspaper headline with a flamboyant 

 touch described it as ?the dawn of a new era?. After victory 

 the team in accepted modern norms ran around the court waving 

 the flag in front of a cheering crowd. Trouncing a young 

 inexperienced Chinese team with very little Davis Cup exposure, 

 totally at sea on wet grass courts, perhaps, did not warrant 

 so much jubilation. 

 The tie was a watershed of sorts. 

 For the first time after 15 years Leander Paes did not play 

 singles. As captain he nominated Prakash Amritraj and Harsh 

 Mankad at the No.1 amp; No. 2 slots for the singles. It 

 was a wise decision with not much risk. Out of the five 

 matches the doubles, with Bhupathi and Paes teaming up for 

 India, was in the bag. Also the Davis Cup rules allow substitution 

 for the reverse singles on the third and final day. So Leander, 

 if necessary, could have stepped into the breach, a role 

 he is familiar with, and best at. 

 Harsh Mankad was impressive. His 

 perseverance and hard work have paid off and is reflected 

 in his performance. He needs to develop more allround power 

 which can be done by physical training and by hitting the 

 ball earlier on his ground shots. Harsh is competitive and 

 has a fine temperament. He can prove to be an asset for 

 the Indian Davis Cup team and move up in the rankings if 

 he continues to persevere.

 Prakash Amritraj played the traditional 

 Vijay Amritraj way. Serve and volley and hustle. A nervy 

 first day did not see him at his best. When the unfinished 

 match was resumed on the next day he overwhelmed his opponent 

 with big serving and decisive volleying. He played brilliantly 

 and got better and better as the match progressed. On fast 

 surfaces and grass courts he will be at his best. He has 

 to curb his impatience and develop more consistency in his 

 ground shots. Warm hearted and good-natured like his illustrious 

 father, Prakash has to work hard and go through the grind 

 of continued tournament play before achieving his full potential.

 It was a good debut for both Harsh 

 and Prakash without Paes but they have a long way to go. 

 The Asia-Oceania zone group I is getting tougher and tougher. 

 Pakistan beat Thailand at Lahore! Srichaphan of Thailand 

 ranked No. 33 in the world, easily the best player in Asia, 

 lost to Qureshi of Pakistan. 

 Mankad can 

 prove to be an asset for the Indian Davis Cup team 

 The Asia Oceanic zone with Korea, 

 Japan, Thailand and Chinese Taipei will make things difficult 

 for India especially in away matches in the future. Also 

 China who have budgeted to spend billions in training their 

 players for the Olympic games, one is told, have already 

 sent a group of 14, 16 and 18 year olds to train in Florida, 

 which has amongst the best facilities in the world. They 

 are bound to come good after a few years. To maintain a 

 weighty presence in the Asia Oceana Zone which has become 

 very competitive, India should immediately send at least 

 a dozen or more promising youngsters abroad for world class 

 coaching and training and sponsored tournament participation. 

 Staying in Group I of the Asia 

 Oceana Zone will be quite a struggle and the possibility 

 of being relegated to Group II is a distinct possibility 

 in the future if we happen to meet Thailand, Chinese Taipei, 

 Korea or Japan in the first round in away ties. India?s 

 domination of Asian tennis has come to an end. We have to 

 find more Krishnans, Amritraj?s and Paes?s urgently or else 

 we will languish in the lowest tier of Davis Cup play. 

 This is easier said than done. 

 The British Lawn Tennis Association has spent millions of 

 pounds, and this is not an exaggeration, over the years 

 but is still searching in vain for a champion. Money alone 

 cannot produce champions. There are a whole lot other factors. 

 One of them is an insatiable hunger for success. The success 

 of the Russians, Czechs, Croats, Slovakians and other such 

 countries is driven by an obsessive desire to break into 

 the top echelons of the game and reap rich benefits beyond 

 their wildest dreams. 

 Our boys are just as talented 

 as juniors in other parts of the world. They are usually 

 more mature and better focused than their western counterparts. 

 Physically most of them are not as strong, and inclined 

 to be timid. It would be wonderful if, with government and 

 corporate aid, the AITA could send a minimum of a dozen 

 each boys and girls to world class academies abroad for 

 a period of two years. A few could make it to the top. The 

 others would pick up coaching and training systems which 

 can be used in academies in India. 

 The AITA has done very good work 

 in arranging so many tournaments all over India. But now 

 they must think big and take a big leap forward to catch 

 up with other Asian countries. For Indian tennis rescue 

 by a family sponsored ?Lone Ranger? is over. The game has 

 moved beyond it.

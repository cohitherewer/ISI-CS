Silchar: India won the womens one-day International series in style, drubbing England by ten wickets in the fourth match here on Wednesday. 

A near capacity 20,000 crowd at the Jatindra Mohan Dev stadium here was treated to some magnificent medium pace bowling from the Player of the Match Jhulan Goswami, who wrecked England with a career best of 16 for five on a slow pitch. 

Jhulans efforts helped India bundle out the visitors for a paltry 51, their lowest total ever. 

The Indian openers ? Karuna Jain (12) and Jaya Sharma ? (29) finished the demolition job in style and ended the match at the stroke of lunch. 

With Wednesdays win, India took an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series with the fifth match to be held in Calcutta being rendered into an inconsequential affair. 

Everything went well for the home team after skipper Mithali Raj won the toss and elected to field. 

The home team tasted success immediately with medium pacer Jhulan getting rid of the highest scorer of the Guwahati match ? skipper Charlotte Edwards. 

Edwards wicket triggered off a collapse with Jhulan combining well with Amita Sharma to make the contest a totally one-sided affair. 

The England team had themselves to blame as the batswomen played reckless shots and slumped to their lowest total ever.

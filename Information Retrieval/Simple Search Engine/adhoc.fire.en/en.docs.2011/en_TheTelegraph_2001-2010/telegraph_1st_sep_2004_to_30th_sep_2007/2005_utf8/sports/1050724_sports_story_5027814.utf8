The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav could be even bigger loser

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Its unlikely that Justice Albie Sachs award will be announced before Monday, at the earliest. However, even if it benefits Sourav Ganguly, he could still be a loser in the long run. 

One isnt only talking about his possibly not getting back the Team India captaincy, but being targeted by the International Cricket Council-appointed umpires and Match Referees ? irrespective of whether hes captain or not. 

In effect, being placed at the very top of the Establishments (unofficial, of course) Most Wanted list. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, that possibility is why Sourav actually wasnt keen on his six-ODI ban being pursued by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

The national body came into the picture as a player cant again move for justice once an Appeals Commissioner has upheld a ban. 

Theres an apprehension that the Match Referees and umpires are going to nail him at every opportunity? Whether Sourav is back as captain or not, the pressure of constantly being monitored may affect his game, a confidant pointed out. 

As Sourav prepares to vacate the Glamorgan-provided flat in Cardiff, hes bound to have more on his mind than just the Team India captaincy. 

Perhaps, it would have been better had the BCCI not pushed for arbitration. In any case, it didnt back Sourav by provisionally appointing him captain for the season-launching tri-series. 

So, even a favourable award is unlikely to be more than a pyrrhic victory for Indias most successful Test captain. 

Footnote: Sourav, clearly, wants the arbitration to end quickly. Early on Saturday, some close to him received an SMS which said much about his state of mind: Ban-er kono news achche?

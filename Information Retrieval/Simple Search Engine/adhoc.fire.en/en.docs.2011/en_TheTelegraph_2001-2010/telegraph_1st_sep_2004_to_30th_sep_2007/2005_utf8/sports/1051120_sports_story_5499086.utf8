 Gopal gets first IM norm

 Deep Sengupta split point with Andrey Kvon 

Istanbul: National junior champion G.N. Gopal crashed through the defences of Matthieu Cornette of France to secure his maiden International Master norm in the World Junior Chess Championship on Saturday. 

The victory also helped Gopal to emerge as the best performing Indian in the fray and the Kerala lad is now on 5.5 points in the boys section. 

Meanwhile, the juggernaut of 2003 champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov rolled on mercilessly and claimed another victim in form of Dutch Daniel Stellwagen. 

In the girls championship, Indian prospects of a medal suffered a setback as hopefuls ? WGM Tania Sachdev and D. Harika ? were held to draws. 

Chinas Gu Xiaobing took a massive stride forward for the girls title after beating Turkan Mamedyarova of Azerbaijan. 

The Indian winner in this section was Eesha Karavade who accounted for Anna Sharevich of Belarus, while Kruttika Nadig and N. Raghavi lost to Maka Purtseladze of Georgia and Anya Corke of Hong Kong, respectively. 

GM-norm holder Deep Sengupta was held to a draw by Andrey Kvon of Uzbekistan and G. Rohit achieved the same result against Roderick Nava of the Philippines. 

Among Indian boys, IM-in-waiting Parimarjan Negi missed another opportunity to complete his overdue title after a loss to Malkhaz Sukhashvili of Georgia. (PTI)

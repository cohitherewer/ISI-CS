The Telegraph - Calcutta

Despite lack of astroturf, Bengal are fighting on equal 

terms with the rest

- Sooner the national coach is selected, the better 

 Stickwork 

Gurbux Singh

With no immediate international commitment, except 

for the junior international meet, the focus has shifted to domestic hockey. We 

have the ongoing senior national championship and the 110th Beighton Cup.

The composition of teams in the national meet has 

changed a bit. After many objections and protests from the states in the last 

AGM of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) about the induction of departmental 

sides like Punjab and Sind Bank (PSB), Indian Oil and the BSF, it was pointed 

out that the national hockey championship was mooted initially when the Rangaswamy 

Cup started and only the states were supposed to take part. Eligible along with 

them were the Services and Indian Railways. Later, two further additions were 

made ? Indian Airlines and Combined Universities.

Remember that these other entities are full-fledged 

members of the IHF, with voting rights.

A few years back some of the other departments wanted 

to participate and join the IHF. The IHF thought it fit, in its own wisdom, to 

absorb them as associate members without any voting rights. That was where most 

of the departmental sides like PSB, Customs, P amp;T, Indian Oil came in with 

donation of certain amounts. That?s how they started participating it the national 

hockey meet.

In the last AGM in Hyderabad, a committee was formed, 

of which I woo was a member, to formulate ways to solve this problem. There were 

two suggestions. The first was to have a separate championship for the associate 

members and the main one for the affiliated units.

But the IHF had made certain commitments to the departmental 

sides when they were inducted and hence certain compromises were necessary. It 

was decided that this time there was to be a separate qualifying meet in Delhi 

for the associate members only. Fourteen-odd teams took part in that meet and 

four qualified. They were Indian Oil, PSB, Namdhari XI and Air India.

The main stream of the national championship, meanwhile, 

identified eight quarter finalists (from the main league). The four associate 

qualifiers join these eight to make a 12-team quarter final stage of four pools 

of three teams each. The pool-toppers go through to the semis.

Bengal?s qualification for the quarters was heartening. 

In the last championship too, held in Jammu four years back, Bengal had made this 

stage. Of the 35 states taking part, five have made the quarters, plus three institutional 

teams. I consider this an achievement of no mean proportion. Sans a single astroturf 

now, with apathy at all levels of administration, our boys are fighting on equal 

terms with the rest of the country.

That brings us to the contentious issue of the astroturf.

It is really a matter of deep regret and hurt that 

despite the astroturf being around for over two decades now, and despite the world 

in general accepting this as standard, we in Bengal have to still fight to prove 

the utility value of the wheel all over again.

I don?t understand why the authorities refuse to pay 

attention to hockey, a sport that has given our state no less than 29 Olympic 

gold medals. I would like to know from those who are trying to shout out the rest, 

which other sport has brought so much international honour to the state? Football? 

Tennis? Cricket?

One thing I feel strongly is about the national coach. 

I believe that the prospective coach of the national side (he is yet to be chosen) 

should have been around to watch the many talents at the national championship. 

Such a large number of players would surely have offered him scope for selection.

The coach selection, I think, should be done at the 

earliest, giving him sufficient time to be able to get along with the boys.

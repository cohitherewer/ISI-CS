 Sourav hits run-a-ball 36

London: It turned out to be an average day for the Indian cricket stars in the Twenty20 Cup on Saturday with two of the three playing ending on the losing side. 

Off-spinner Harbhajan Singhs Surrey and Sourav Gangulys Glamorgan ended on a losing side, while, despite below-par performance by Irfan Pathan, Middlesex got the better of Kent. 

Sourav scored a run-a-ball 36, but Glamorgan failed short by 54 runs against Warwickshire, who scored 205 for 7 in their allotted 20 overs. 

It was a low-scoring game between Surrey and Kent with the former being bowled out for 118 in 15.3 overs. Harbhajan was out for just four runs. 

However, the off-spinner, with Nayan Doshi, son of former international Dilip Doshi, claimed some quick wickets but failed to save the match. Harbhajan ended with figures of 4-0-22-2, while Nayans analysis read 4-0-16-2. 

Only Pathan ended up on the winning side after his Middlesex defended a score of 189 for eight. Pathan gave away 30 runs claiming just one wicket, but Middlesex restricted Kent to 169 for five. (PTI)

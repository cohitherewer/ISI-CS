 Less fancied cornered glory 

 STAR RACER

 Barring, questionable riding of two horses in last Saturday?s seven-event card, form held sway, though favourites had taken a day-off, leaving the fields open for less fancied winners. 

 It was, however, a mere coincidence, and not the horse-sense, that the Mayor?s and the Governor?s Cups were picked up by Star Magic and Adderly ? the only favourites to oblige in the seven-event card. The focus during the afternoon was, however, on Aleksei in the 1,600m Nanoli Stud Calcutta Million. The half-money favourite from trainer Vijay Singh?s yard had demonstrated good turn of foot in the 1,400m Champagne Stakes and the extra 200m journey in the ?Million? was, therefore, considered to be his strength. But it did not happen. 

 Sanskara, a filly from Bha-rath Singh?s stable had other ideas, though she was outclassed by Aleksei in the Champagne encounters, and on identical weight difference. It was Sanskara who found the additional furlong to her advantage after her jockey C. Rajendra had settled off the pace till 400m from home. She may have scored only by a ?head? but the Don?t Forget Me-Shisedo daughter certainly ruined dream of a good galloper.

 It was, however, a long ?head? that helped Vijay?s Adderly conquer Santarelle. The former, a sparingly raced horse, was also ridden in a check by Mark Reu-ben till the final turn but he had to fire on all cylinders to retain advantage. 

 However, Reuben was in trouble for going easy on Way To The Starts in the Spats Colombo Cup won by another of Vijay?s trainee, Announcer. The jockey was seen applying negative tactics on the horse, and was therefore handed a three-week suspension. Jockey S. Paswan was, in comparison, lucky after his blatant effort to stop Sign Of Class from beating the Vinay Jaiswal-ridden Common Spirit in the Crystal Man Cup. He was stood down for five weeks.

 Star Magic did not need to do anything supernatural to pull off his fourth successive victory despite the fact that the Harvinder Singh Bath-trainee suffered from throat infection after his runaway victory in the Champions? Sprint trophy about a month ago. 

 Incidentally, it was his fourth win in-a-row ? and all ?terms? races. Jaiswal, though was presented with an opportunity to score a double atop Thoughtful, found Cambridge Blue a wee bit better in the Pentire Handicap. He was, however, on the up and his well-judged effort on Annotate in the 2,000m Cupid Cup, on Tuesday, was praiseworthy. 

 He was also alert while partnering Mayavi to a smart win in a sprint race on the same day. Reuben and apprentice Melvyn Maseyk also looked hungry for wins and they not-ched up a brace apiece. 

 However, it was Melvyn who impressed in a battle for supremacy against his senior brother Malcom in the 1,400m Play Boy Handicap. Melvyn?s Salient Star won the race after fighting a long battle against the Malcom-ridden Fighting Force. He is gaining confidence with his each ride.

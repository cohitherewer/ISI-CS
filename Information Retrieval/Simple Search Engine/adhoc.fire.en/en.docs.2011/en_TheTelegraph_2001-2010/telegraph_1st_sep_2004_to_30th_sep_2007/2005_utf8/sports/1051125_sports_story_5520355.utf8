 Best critical again

London: Desperately ill former Manchester United winger George Best is unlikely to survive another 24 hours, his doctor said on Thursday. 

He could die at any time ? Ill be very surprised if he survives another 24 hours, Professor Roger Williams said outside the Cromwell hospital in west London. 

Im afraid Mr Best is coming towards the end of the long road. 

A hospital spokesman said earlier that the former player had suffered a bad night. 

Best, 59 ? who has had an alcohol problem for much of his adult life ? has been in hospital since the beginning of October and was put on a life support machine last week.

 STAR RACER

 Liaison is a class apart

 Calcutta: Classic and Class horses normally complement each other. Therefore, there is no reason to look beyond the filly Romantic Liaison in Sundays star event, the 1,600m Calcutta 1000 Guineas ? the first Classic of the season.

 The Vijay Singh-trainee, who recently trounced a Class I company, is pitted against an opposition which has hardly been a force to reckon with two Classes down. It may, therefore, turn out to be a cakewalk for the Razeen-Veenas Pet daughter and her jockey, C.Alford.

 The Mayfowl Cup, on the other hand, may see a tough contest between the Vijays duo of Aperitivo and Formal Invitation ? placed one and two in last winters Derby ? and the western India migrant Magical Sunset. The handicap advantage, however, lies with Formal Invitation and the Steinbeck-Invitation Only son may do the trick in the hands of M.Mark.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

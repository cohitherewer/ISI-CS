 Stuart Clark cover for McGrath in final Test

London: Stuart Clark has been called up as cover for Glenn McGrath ahead of this weeks fifth and final Ashes Test, Cricket Australia announced on Monday. 

McGrath is doubtful with the right elbow injury that forced him to miss Englands three-wicket fourth Test win at Trent Bridge where the home side went 2-1 up. 

The uncapped 29-year-old New South Wales seamer, currently with Middlesex, has already been with the Australian squad this tour, having been selected as a standby for McGrath ahead of the drawn Third test at Old Trafford. 

McGrath, who took nine for 82 in Australias 239-run first Test win at Lords, missed Englands two-run second Test win with an ankle injury after he trod on a ball during the warm-up.

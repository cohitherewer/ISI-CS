Centurion: Ashwell Prince scored his maiden half-century to steer South Africa to a three-wicket win over England and wrap up a 4-1 series victory in the seventh and final one-day International on Sunday. 

Despite a superb century under pressure by Englands Kevin Pietersen, who lifted England to 240 all out in 49.5 overs, South Africa won with an over to spare after Prince struck a career-best 62 not out in 76 balls. 

The hosts finished on 241 for nine, with further contributions from captain Graeme Smith (47) and Mark Boucher, a brisk 44. 

Pietersen smashed 116 off 110 balls ? his third century of the series ? to lift his series aggregate to 454 runs at an average of 151 after coming to the crease with his side 32 for three. 

Ashley Giles (41) and Kabir Ali (25) combined with the South African-born Pietersen in crucial lower-order stands of 104 for the seventh wicket and 53 for the eighth. 

Andrew Hall, with three for 52, and Makhaya Ntini and Andre Nel, with two wickets each, were the most successful South African bowlers. 

Boucher scored his 44 off just 40 balls with six fours before he was run out when 23 runs were still needed, though he had got South Africa near enough to their victory target and, while Justin Kemp and Shaun Pollock were dismissed cheaply, Prince got them home safely. 

South Africa shuffled their batting order with Andrew Hall (23) opening with Smith, and the pair put on a confident 46 in 10.4 overs for the first wicket before Hall was brilliantly caught at deep square-leg by Steve Harmison off Alex Wharf. 

Smith continued to attack the England bowlers, scoring his 47 off 66 balls, with six fours, before he gifted Giles his wicket by holing out at mid-off. 

Kallis also got himself out, hitting Michael Vaughans first ball to long-on for 36, while Herschelle Gibbs was out lbw for a duck to Harmison before Prince and Boucher ensured the win. 

Earlier, the South African-born Pietersen was relatively subdued as he and Ashley Giles dug England out of trouble. 

It took him 72 balls to score his first 33 runs but he switched back into the bludgeoning mode which has characterised his performances in South Africa when he hit left-arm spinner Nicky Boje for two sixes over mid-wicket in three balls. 

They were the first of six sixes for Pietersen, who also hit 10 fours. It took him 80 deliveries to reach 50 but he only needed 28 more to notch his century. Pietersen, 24, who was not originally included in England?s squad but was called up after an impressive Zimbabwe debut. (Agencies)

 Zimbabwe contract row deepens

Harare: The contract crisis in the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) deepened on Sunday. The Zimbabwe Cricket Players Association has rubbished claims by the board that contracts had been withdrawn from three white cricketers because they were asking for a great deal of money. 

As far as we are concerned, there is no question of cricketers asking for more money because they have not been offered contracts in the first place, said Clive Field, the players representative. 

The ZCU, on Saturday, announced that it would not issue fresh contracts to three white cricketers ? Stuart Carlisle, Barnie Rogers and Neil Ferreira. (PTI)

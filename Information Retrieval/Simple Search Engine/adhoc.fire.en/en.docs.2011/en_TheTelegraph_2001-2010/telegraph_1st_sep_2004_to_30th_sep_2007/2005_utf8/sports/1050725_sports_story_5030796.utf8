 London: Olympic champion Shawn Crawford of the United States has pulled out of the 200m at next month?s world championships in Helsinki because of a persistent foot injury, his agent said on Sunday.

 Kimberly Trammell said Crawford had been troubled with a foot injury since late last year. He has not competed since the US trials in June. ?As a result, he will try only to compete in the 100m and (4x100) relay at the world championships,? Trammell said.

 Crawford?s withdrawal opens a place for Wallace Spearmon, who finished fourth in the trials. 

 Paris: American rookie Paula Creamer became the youngest winner on the Ladies European Tour (LET) with an eight-shot victory in the $2.5 million Evian Masters at Evian-les-Bains on Saturday.

 The 18-year-old, who upstaged fellow American teenage prodigy Michelle Wie by becoming the LPGA Tour?s second-youngest winner at the Sybase Classic in May, fired a one-under-par 71 to finish at 15-under 273. Aged 18 years, 11 months and 18 days, she eclipsed the achievement of Belgium?s Florence Descampe, who was the LET?s previous youngest winner after clinching the 1988 Danish Ladies Open at the age of 19 years, 74 days.

 Wie, 15, closed with a 68 to tie for second at seven under with Mexican Lorena Ochoa, who returned a 69. 

 Stuttgart: Rafael Nadal swept to a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Gaston Gaudio in Sunday?s Mercedes Cup final to land his eighth clay-court title of the year and extend his winning run on the surface to 34 matches.

 The 19-year-old Spaniard confirmed his status as the best clay-court player in the world, and qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup with a commanding win, running the third-seeded Argentine ragged in an entertaining final.

 The French Open champion recovered from losing his opening service game to take the first set in 54 minutes, broke twice in the second and completed victory in two hours 41 minutes.

 London/Milan: Inter Milan?s pre-season tour of England will begin as scheduled, Italian officials said on Sunday.

 The Italian Serie A club had announced on Saturday that they were cancelling the tour over safety fears following the London bombings but reconsidered their decision just 24 hours later. 

 ?I can officially confirm the tour is on as scheduled,? Italy?s ambassador to Britain said on Sunday. ?The team is leaving for the UK,? Giancarlo Aragona said.

 Donington Park: MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi made light of appalling conditions to win a crash-strewn British Grand Prix Sunday. 

 The Italian Yamaha rider was the undisputed rainmaster, totally dominant in taking his seventh victory to move 104 points clear.

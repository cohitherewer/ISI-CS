 SA name Botha

Centurion: South Africa called up the uncapped Johan Botha as part of a three-pronged spin attack for a one-day tour of India starting next week. 

The 23-year old took up off-spin bowling just two years ago, having entered first-class cricket for Eastern Province as a medium-pacer. 

Slow left-armer Robin Peterson, who has taken just nine wickets in 21 one-day Internationals, and Justin Ontong, who bowls off and legbreaks but has taken just eight wickets in 18 matches, are the other spinners in the 15-man squad announced on Sunday. 

THE Squad: Graeme Smith (captain), AB de Villiers, Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince, Justin Kemp, Justin Ontong, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Albie Morkel, Andrew Hall, Robin Peterson, Johan Botha, Charl Langeveldt, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel.

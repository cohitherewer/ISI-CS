 Bengal denied points

Surat: The four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match between host Gujarat and Bengal ended in a tame draw at the Lalbhai Contractor Stadium here on Wednesday. 

Replying to Bengals first innings total of 462, Gujarat were 371 for the loss of nine wickets when stumps were drawn. Gujarat skipper Mukund Parmar remained unbeaten on 57 (7x4) while Lalit Patel was unbeaten on three at the end of the match. The visitors needed to get the last wicket to get two points for the first innings lead. 

Nilesh Modi was the top scorer for Gujarat with 76 (6x4), while Neeraj Patel chipped in with a useful 60. Shib Shankar Paul and Sourashish Lahiri took three wickets each for 84 and 121 runs, respectively. 

Earlier on Tuesday, Gujarat had a shaky start after losing two quick wickets for 127 after Bengal piled up a huge score of 462, riding on skipper Deep Dasguptas knock of 143. 

As an innings of both sides was not completed, neither team got any point from this match.

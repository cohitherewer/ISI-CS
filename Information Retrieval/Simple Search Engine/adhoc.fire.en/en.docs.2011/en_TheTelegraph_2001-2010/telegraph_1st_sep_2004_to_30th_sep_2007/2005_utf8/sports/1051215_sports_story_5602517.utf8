Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has voiced his concerns about the super sub rule in one-day Internationals. 

It is a difficult rule for the team losing the toss. I think it is better if it is not there in matches but if it is there, teams should be allowed to name their super sub after the toss, Inzamam told a news conference at the National stadium on Wednesday. 

Pakistan and England play the third ODI on Thursday at a venue where no non-Asian team has played since 2001 due to security concerns. 

The series is level at 1-1 after England won the first game by 42 runs and Pakistan the second by seven wickets. 

It is very difficult for the teams losing the toss. We have been unable to utilise our super sub because we lost the tosses, Inzamam said. 

Pakistan named off spinner Arshad Khan as super sub in the first two games but only called on him in the second match to bowl a few overs because of an injury to leg spinner Danish Kaneria. 

Allrounder Shahid Afridi returns to the squad after serving a two-match ban for scuffing the pitch in the second Test in Faisalabad and Inzamam said he would definitely play. 

England will be without Kevin Pietersen due to a rib injury and Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer thinks the touring side will miss him. 

Pietersen is a big blow for England in the sense he is a very dangerous cricketer in one-day cricket specifically and it would be difficult to replace someone like him, Woolmer said. 

We cant underestimate England because they have lost Pietersen and teams occasionally play without their frontline players. We still have to play well to beat England. 

Some Pakistani players, including fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and allrounder Shoaib Malik, are suffering from viral fever due to the change in weather but Woolmer is confident they will be available. 

England have played all their tour matches in the cooler central province of Punjab and Thursdays game is their first in the southern port city of Karachi where temperatures are warmer.

 Rajinder (Sr) hits out at IHF 

Mohali: The Indian Hockey Federations (IHFs) inability to chalk out a long term plan is hurting the game dearly, according to former coach Rajinder Singh Sr who also foresaw another poor performance from the team in the Champions Trophy to be held later this year. 

There is no long term planning by the IHF to raise the standard of game, Rajinder Singh, who was the coach of the senior team from 2001 to 2003, said. Rajinder was here to attend a seminar on Revival of Hockey, to mark the 100th birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand. 

Rajinder was also critical of IHFs tendency to remove and appoint coaches frequently. A coach should be given at least four to five years to prove himself, he said. 

He also suggested of giving an open hand to the coach in taking decisions concerning the team. 

Describing the performance of the Indian team in the recent Rabobank Trophy as poor, he said he had no hopes from the team in the forthcoming Champions Trophy. 

The former coach also said the team lacked drag flickers who were crucial since more than fifty per cent of the game is based on penalty corner conversions. 

Rajinder said the present team lacked a playmaker and individual dedication was also missing among players. 

On being asked whether coach Rajinder Singh (Jr) and IHF chief KPS Gill should be held responsible for the plight of the team, he said the morale of the players is low and it is time to motivate them. 

He cited the teams shift from attacking game to defensive play as the biggest technical flaw, which needed rectification. 

Joining the issue, Tarlochan Singh Bawa, the eldest and oldest surviving gold medallist who represented the country in the 1948 Olympics in hockey as right full back, said that discipline was grossly missing from the players. 

He said the fitness of Indian players was also not up to international standards. Our players fail to match the speed and stamina levels of foreign players, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 My best is yet to come, says Carlos Moya

 - Chennai Open 

- ?A Grand Slam crown is one of my goals for 2005? 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Carlos Moya feels he is far from finished 

Chennai: If Carlos Moya?s tennis career hadn?t taken off, he could have made a living out of films. With his chiselled looks and sharp features he surely would have walked into tinsel town. 

The Spaniard did, in fact, try his hand in acting ? four years ago in a Spanish film as a tennis coach. There were offers galore after that, in lead roles. But Moya chose to pursue his chosen profession. And of course he hasn?t regretted his decision. 

For a time after winning the French Open in 1998 and capturing the world No. 1 ranking, the Mallorca-born pro did stagnate. Few would have blamed him for changing track and taking up an equally lucrative career option. 

His results in the last three years reconfirmed his class and pedigree. A Grand Slam may have eluded him, but 10 of his 17 career titles have come in this period including three in 2004. He is happy to be world No. 5, the third straight time that he has managed a top-10 year-ending slot. That?s remarkable consistency. And, he says he is far from finished. 

?I have been playing some great tennis in the last few months. I may be 28, but I feel my best is yet to come,? Moya said in response to a query from The Telegraph during a press conference. 

He was candid enough to admit that he still needs to make improvements. ?There are areas in which I can improve and I am working really hard to do that. I hope to keep running for some more years to come.? 

For a player of his calibre, it?s a surprise he hasn?t got more Grand Slam trophies in his cabinet. He is aware of that ?drawback? and wishes to rectify it this year. ?A Grand Slam crown is one of my goals for 2005,? Moya said, adding that he didn?t have a preference. ?Any of the four would do.? 

The other aim is to win the year-ending Masters Cup. ?I did well to qualify for last year?s meet as one of the top eight players? I played pretty well too but?? Moya got eliminated from round-robin stage and that?s something he is determined to improve next time. 

Having spearheaded Spain?s American conquest in the Davis Cup final, Moya wouldn?t mind an encore of that as well. ?The Davis Cup final was an unbelievable experience. I had prepared well for the tie and was very focused? Good all the hard work paid off,? Moya said. 

No wonder Moya is strictly against a change in Davis Cup format. ?I have been playing Davis Cup since1996, it?s a wonderful format and a great tournament which has worked so well over the years. Whatever others may say, I don?t think there?s any need to change it.? 

This is his fourth visit to the Chennai meet, a place he?s developed a liking for over the years. He doesn?t, however, wish to repeat his maiden ?performance? when four years ago, he had to pull out on the morning of his first-round match after developing blisters on his right hand. 

The city?s tennis fraternity wouldn?t want that either. They love this classical baseliner who has worked tirelessly to develop into a solid all-court performer.

 Sachin predicts tough series

 Sachin 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar said on Wednesday that both India and Pakistan have momentum going into next months upcoming three-Test rubber, which he feels would be a great series. 

We both have good momentum going into the series. Pakistan have done well against England and we have won at home (against Sri Lanka). Its going to be a tough and great series, the champion batsman told a press conference here. 

On former Pakistan captain Imran Khans comments that the Indians may struggle this time around in Pakistan owing to wintry conditions, Tendulkar said these were not new to his team. 

I come from Mumbai but I have played in such conditions. I have played with two or three pullovers in England while playing for Yorkshire. Our fast bowlers have done well on the last tour, he said. 

We dont want to focus on what Pakistan do. We want to concentrate on what we have to do and thats what we will be doing, he added. 

The maestro, however, agreed that Pakistan look a much-improved team this time around. 

Last time we had the momentum after having done well in Australia where they had not done so well. This time they look a better prepared side, he said. (PTI)

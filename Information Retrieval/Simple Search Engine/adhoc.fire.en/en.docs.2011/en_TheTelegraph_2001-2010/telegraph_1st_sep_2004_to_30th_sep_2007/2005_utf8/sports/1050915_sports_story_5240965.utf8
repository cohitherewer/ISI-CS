 Laxman takes a dig at critics

Bulawayo: V.V.S. Laxman had a rare outburst at his critics after stroking a classy unbeaten 125 against Zimbabwe on the second day of the first Test here on Wednesday. 

There has been some negative vibes in the team and outside and I just wanted to prove myself, remarked Laxman after providing the team with a platform from where they could put the hosts in a corner. 

Laxman was particularly scathing at critics who questioned his presence in the one-day squad and even doubted if he was fit to retain his position in the Test side. 

Its really unfortunate. Its unfair to put pressure on a single guy. There are different criteria for different guys. 

But then thats been the way with me throughout my career, he said.

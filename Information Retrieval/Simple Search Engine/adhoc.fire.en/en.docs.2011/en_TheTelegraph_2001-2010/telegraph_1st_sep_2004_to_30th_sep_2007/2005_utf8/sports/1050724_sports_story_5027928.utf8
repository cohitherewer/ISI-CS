Tyre-care needed

Overdrive 

Narain Karthikeyan

I was very disappointed after my last race in Silverstone 

where I had to retire after 11 laps due a problem with my cars electronic 

control unit (ECU). Somehow the whole system just shut down. I was having a very 

good show till that moment. I had very good pace all weekend and even after 11 

laps into the race I was only a second behind the cars in front of me, the Saubers. 

The Silverstone circuit is a place where I had always done reasonably well and 

had some track experience, therefore I was even more upset. 

The Hockenheim Circuit in Germany is another one of 

the circuits where I have never raced before. The stadium section of the sector 

is very interesting and technical. This circuit was recently modified in 2002 

and the long runs into the forest section have been done away with. It is still, 

however, a very fast circuit where we are doing speeds of around 330 kmph and 

there are a couple of very good overtaking opportunities. We have to be very careful 

not to push too much as this circuit is very harsh on the tyres, especially the 

front left tyre. 

In the past two weeks we managed to do a lot of tyre 

testing for the car. We needed the optimum balance between our tyre compound and 

the car and now we feel we have the right compound for the race ahead and for 

the one next week in Hungary. We also did a lot of fitness work in the past two 

weeks. On some days we were doing between 10 km to 16 km run. We havent 

made much change to ours from the usual setup. 

I was quite pleased with my practice session on Friday. 

I managed close to 35 laps around this circuit. Since I have never been here before, 

it was good to get these laps under my belt. Our most obvious objective for this 

race will be to finish the race and end the bad run we are currently having. 

The Mclarens as usual seem to be the strongest car 

on the circuit and they had a very good showing at the Friday practice. They will 

have to use that advantage to close the gap between Alonso and Raikkonen otherwise 

it will get really difficult to stop Alonso from winning this years championship.

KARTHIKEYAn SO FAR...

In the Formula One world championship, so far, Narain 

Karthikeyans best result has been at US Grand Prix in Indianapolis where 

he finished fourth. Of course only six cars took part after the rest pulled out 

due to fear of Michelin tyres not being safe. The following is his performance 

in the first 11 races of the season: 

 March 6, Australian GP (Melbourne): Finished 

15th 

 March 20, Malaysian GP (Sepang): Finished 11th 

 April 3, Bahrain GP (Sakhir): Retired after two laps 

 April 24, San Marino GP (Imola): Finished 14th 

 May 8, Spanish GP (Barcelona): Finished 13th 

 May 22: Monaco GP (Monaco): Retired after 22 laps

 May 29: European GP (Nurburgring): Finished 16th

 June 12: Canadian GP (Montreal): Retired after 28 laps

 June 19: United States GP (Indianapolis): Finished 4th

 July 3: French GP (Magny-Cours): Finished 15th

 July 10: British GP (SIlverstone): Retired after 10 laps

 Hari slips to second spot

Pamplona: Grandmaster and former world junior champion P. Harikrishna slipped to second spot after settling for a draw in the seventh and penultimate round of the 15th Ciudad De Pamplona International Chess Tournament here. 

The Indian split the point with Dutch GM Sergei Tiviakov, his fourth draw of the event. 

He now has four points out of a possible six, and is assured of an increase in his present Elo rating. 

 Former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine defeated GM Oscar De La Riva Aguado of Andorra. 

With just one round remaining in the category-16 round robin event, Ponomariov took his tally to 4.5 points and now just needs a draw against Harikrishna in the final round game to emerge clear champion.

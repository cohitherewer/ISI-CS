 FIA lifts threat on truant teams

London: Formula Ones governing body has lifted the threat of sanctions against seven Michelin teams who failed to take part in last months US Grand Prix at Indianapolis. 

The international automobile federation (FIA) said in a statement on Thursday that a meeting of its senate in Monaco had recommended cancelling a guilty verdict against Renault, McLaren, Williams, Toyota, Red Bull, Sauber and BAR. 

It said the decision followed receipt of a dossier of new evidence from all teams with the exception of Red Bull. 

The senate will therefore recommend to the World Motor Sport Council that the guilty verdict of 29 June against the teams be cancelled, the FIA said. 

The Paris-based governing body expected the recommendation to be put to a fax vote of its Council in the next few days. The meeting was attended by McLaren boss Ron Dennis, representing six teams.

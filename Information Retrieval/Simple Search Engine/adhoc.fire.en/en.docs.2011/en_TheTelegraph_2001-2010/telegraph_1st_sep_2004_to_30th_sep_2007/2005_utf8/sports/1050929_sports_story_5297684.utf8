 No, says former European official 

 Michelle Wie 

London: The arbiters of professional golf should think long and hard before deciding whether to allow teenage prodigy Michelle Wie to play on the mens Tour, former European Tour executive director Ken Schofield said. 

The American schoolgirl, who turns 16 next month, is expected to turn professional this year, and is already one of the biggest attractions of the game. 

But the Hawaiian-born teenager should concentrate on smashing records in the womens game rather than joining the mens Tour, Schofield feels. 

The history of golf is of men playing men and women playing against women. That has stood the test of time, so why should we change it? 

Are we talking about a civil liberty issue here, a restraint of trade? I dont think so, Schofield said. 

Having made her Tour debut at the age of 12, Wie became only the fourth female, and the youngest in history, to play on the mens US PGA Tour when she missed the cut by one stroke at the Sony Open in Hawaii. 

In her third crack at the mens circuit, in July, she missed the cut by two shots after dropping three strokes in the last four holes. 

In Schofields opinion, it is not Wies ability that is in question, rather the direction the sport should take. 

There is the great history of the womens game to consider, he told a British newspaper. The US Womens Open dates back to 1946 and its roll call of champions includes the likes of Babe Zaharias, Mickey Wright and of course Annika (Sorenstam). (Reuters)

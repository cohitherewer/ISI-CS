The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Vaughan may sue ICC

 Michael Vaughan 

 London: England captain 

 Michael Vaughan is contemplating legal action against International 

 Cricket Council (ICC) after Match Referee Clive Lloyd fined 

 him the entire match fee for his ?inappropriate comments? 

 against umpires during the JohannesBurg Test against South 

 Africa. 

Vaughan has asked the Professional Cricketers? AssoCiation (PCA) for advice regarding the legal action, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph on Monday. 

The skipper was charged with a Level II offence, a relatively minor transgression for which there is no appeals procedure ? a player can only appeal if he has been charged with a Level III or a Level IV offence. 

PCA chief executive Richard Bevan argued that the ICC?s ruling, which came on Sunday, was inconsistent with its own guidelines. 

?If you?re going to fine somebody 100 per cent of their match fee, then that is no longer a minor offence,? Bevan said. 

?We?re going to call for a total review of the ICC?s disciplinary process, insisting on a right of appeal for Level I and II offences. We hope the ICC will realise that they?ve got it wrong. If they don?t recognise that, we may be taking legal advice.? 

Lloyd?s action has also drawn flak from many former players including Ian Botham. 

 ?Instead of putting just players and coaches on charges 

 in a kangaroo court, why not apply the same code of conduct 

 to umpires when they make a cock-up?? Botham said.

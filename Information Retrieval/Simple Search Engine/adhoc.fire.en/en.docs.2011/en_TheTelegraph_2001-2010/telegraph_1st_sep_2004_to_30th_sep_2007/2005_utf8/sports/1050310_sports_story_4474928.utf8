The Telegraph - Calcutta

 This is no setback: Bhowmick

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick was prepared for the media. More prepared, it seemed, than he had had his team, going into their AFC Cup opener versus Muktijoddha Sansad of Bangladesh at the Salt Lake Stadium Wednesday. 

?I said it would be a difficult match, we just could not get past their defence, it was remarkable defending,? he said. ?But let me tell you, this is not a setback. In their home match, they will come out to score, then we will go for the kill? we will show them what attacking is all about.? 

?I said there was little difference between teams of the two countries,? said Muktijoddha coach Safikul Rahman Manik. ?I had come for at least one point and I leave with it, and no goals conceded either,? he said. 

The Bangla team will now play two tournaments in Bangladesh and ?polish? themselves up as East Bengal had, Manik believed, from the NFL. 

?Actually throw-in man, Sk Belal Ahmed, was a bolt from the blue. His throw-ins are longer than anybody?s I have come across, and that is what they were using to effect, till, in the second half, I instructed Rajat (Ghosh Dastidar, goalkeeper), to move a couple of steps and cut off the throw,? said Bhowmick. ?The secrets are out now, I will be able to take this team easily in Bangladesh.? 

Next up for East Bengal is an away match against Turkmenistan?s Lebit Chi. East Bengal, who haven?t got any formal invitation so far nor any match details, have sent a letter to the Turkmenistan club. 

Manik, though, felt that his players had a good start, and ?we now look forward to be able to organise ourselves better for the matches ahead, as also the Federation Cup and the league that is upon us.?

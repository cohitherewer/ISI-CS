 Streak named deputy

Harare: Zimbabwe allrounder Heath Streak returned to his Matabeleland Farm from England and will be in Harare later this week practising for the first Test against New Zealand beginning at the Harare Sports Club on Sunday. 

Streaks inclusion as Tatenda Taibus deputy in the home teams 14-man squad, having been released by Warwickshire, will provide strength in both batting and bowling against the Black Caps. 

He has also made his peace with the Zimbabwe board following his walkout 16 months ago, together with 14 other contracted white players, after they alleged racism in the selection process. 

Other former rebels, Stuart Carlisle, Craig Wishart and Andy Blignaut have also been included in the squad. But not Ray Price (Worcester), Grant Flower (Essex), Sean Ervine (Hampshire) and Travis Friend. 

Streak was the top wicket-taker in one-day matches during his three-month stay in England and top wicket-taker in all matches for Warwickshire. (AFP)

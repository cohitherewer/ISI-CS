 Sourav sounds optimistic

Ahmedabad: Sourav Ganguly had a nightmarish match with the bat in the Duleep Trophy final against West Zone. But the former India captain sounded optimistic of a comeback to the national team. 

I am disappointed with this game. Though I did not score, I made a Test hundred in the last series (against Zimbabwe). 

I also won the previous two first-class matches for my side (East versus Zimbabwe Presidents XI and North) and scored a first-class hundred recently, Sourav said, adding it was upto to the selectors to decide his future. 

Indias most successful Test captain did not feature in the seven-match ODI series against Sri Lanka and is also not in the squad for the first three matches of the South Africa series which begins in Hyderabad on Wednesday. 

Asked about the low-scoring Duleep final which ended in under three days, the East skipper said: First-class games are known to finish inside three days, like it happened against the Zimbabwe team. (PTI)

 Inzy reminded of 1992 reception

Karachi: The Pakistan team was Monday accorded a warm welcome on arrival after completing a 57-day tour of India during which they drew the three-Test series 1-1 and won the six-match one-day series 4-2. 

Five members of the squad ? vice-captain Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi, Mohammed Sami, Danish Kaneria and Asim Kamal ? arrived in Karachi in the afternoon while the rest landed in Lahore in the evening. 

Nearly 300 followers ? mostly fans of Afridi ? had gathered outside Karachi?s Quaid-e-Azam international airport while nearly 500 people greeted Inzamam-ul Haq and his men in Lahore. 

Inzamam attributed the team?s success to the committed and disciplined performance by his team. 

?Odds were heavily against us but we proved that if we play to our own potential, we can beat any team. The credit must go to the entire team who made up for their inexperience with a dedicated, disciplined and professional performance,? Inzamam said. 

Inzamam said the reception his team received on Monday reminded him of the welcome the team got in 1992 when they returned after winning the World Cup. ?The welcome I received today reminded me of our arrival from Australia in 1992,? he said.

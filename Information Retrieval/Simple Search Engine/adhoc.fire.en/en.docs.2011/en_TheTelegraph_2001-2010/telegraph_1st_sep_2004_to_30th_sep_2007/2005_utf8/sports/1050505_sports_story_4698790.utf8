 Linesman scored it, says Mourinho

Liverpool: A furious Jose Mourinho blamed Slovakian linesman Roman Slysko for Chelsea?s 0-1 Champions League semi-final defeat to Liverpool at Anfield here but then vowed that his side would come back stronger than ever next season. 

Chelsea?s Portuguese manager, whose side wrapped up the Premiership title Saturday, saw his team beaten by a fourth-minute Luis Garcia goal that appeared to have been hacked off the line by William Gallas. 

?Football sometimes is cruel,? said Mourinho. ?We have to accept the result. They scored a goal, if you can say they scored it. I can say that the linesman scored it.? 

He was generous, though, to Liverpool, and specifically their crowd, who maintained a constant level of raucous support throughout although he typically turned that praise into a jibe at Slysko, whose raised flag persuaded referee Lubos Michel to give the goal. 

?The Anfield Road experience, I felt it, it was magnificent,? Mourinho said. ?I felt it did not interfere with my players, but maybe with some other people. It maybe interfered with the result. 

?I think you must ask the linesman why he gave the goal. To give it you must be 100 per cent certain. You must be sure that the ball is in. My players say it was not a goal. 

?From TV I could not see, but other people say you could not confirm it was a goal. Only one person decided the future of players who have never played in a Champions League final,? added Mourinho who last season won European club football?s biggest prize while in charge of Porto. 

But, following a goalless first leg, there was equally no denying the role of Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez, his five-man midfield blanket and defensive fulcrum Jamie Carragher. 

With this season over bar the routine of the final league games, Mourinho is already looking ahead to next year. 

?I know I can?t win everything,? he said. ?I can?t complain with my success, with my players or my career. I?m a happy man. I?m just sad because of the result today. But tomorrow I will be at training preparing for next season.? 

Benitez also played to type, the occasional flicker of an understated smile the only indication of the glee the Spaniard must have felt. 

?I?m very proud. It is hard to be consistent in the first year, and we?ve played much better in the Champions League than in the Premiership.?

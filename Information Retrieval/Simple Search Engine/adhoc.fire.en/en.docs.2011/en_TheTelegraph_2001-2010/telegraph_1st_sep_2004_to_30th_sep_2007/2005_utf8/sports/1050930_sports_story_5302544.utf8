 Rasalas may do the trick 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The three-way contest in Fridays main event, the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes, has generated much interest among the city turfites. In past, the monsoon edition of this Classic was always considered as a farce.

 The three star performers in the race are Rasalas and Sanskara ? the two highly rated youngsters of last winter. Ardennes, the third serious aspirant, has walked into the reckoning after her effortless mile-win, recently in Mysore, albeit in Class IV. 

 However, it is Rasalas who is expected to wear the Derby-crown shortly after 4.10 pm. The half-brother to Fiddle Faddle is the best stayer in the field and the Daniel David-trainee may negotiate the mile-and-a-quarter trip comfortably. Jockey B. Prakash will partner the horse.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

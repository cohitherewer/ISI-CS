 Harmeet Kahlon slips to tied 18th 

Macau: Harmeet Kahlon dropped two vital shots on the last two closing holes, but continued to be the best among the Indians at the end of the third round of the $275,000 Macau Open. 

Kahlon, who was tied 12th, shot a one-over 72 and slipped to tied 18th at three-under for the tournament. His first two rounds were 71 and 67. 

Chinese Taipei veteran Wang Ter-Chang fired two closing birdies for a four-under-par 67 to earn the third round lead and an attempt at ending a six-year title drought. 

Among other Indians, who are still in the race for a good position in the top 20 include Arjun Singh, who shot a round of one-over 72 and is now tied 20th at two-under for three rounds and Amandeep Johl, who with his second successive par round of 71 was one-under for the tournament and in tied 24th place. 

It was not easy today, it was windy and blew in different directions. I played okay but one or two chips were not up to the mark. It was disappointing to bogey the 17th and 18th. 

But I still have one more round to play and try to move up. I wont be going to the Philippine Open next week, so it will be nice to finish off strongly here. 

There are as many as eight Indians in the weekend rounds of the event. While Kahlons tied 18th, Arjun Singh tied 20th and Johl tied 24th, Rahil Gangjee (71) is now 33rd at even par and Gurbaaz Mann (71) is one-over for 54 holes and tied 40th. 

Uttam Singh Mundy slipped with a four-over 75 and is now three-over and tied 54th, while Sandy Lehal playing his first Asian Tour event is tied 61st after a third round of 74 and a total of five-over 218. 

Kahlon had two birdies and two bogeys on the front nine and then another bogey saw him one over after 12. But birdies on the 13th and 15th placed him better before the closing two bogeys spoil this card. 

The 42-year-old Wang leads the Asian Tour event by one stroke from American Edward Loar, who charged into contention with a 66 at the par-71 Macau Golf and Country Club. 

Defending champion Jason Knutzon and Australian rookie Jarrod Lyle share third place a further stroke back.

All the teams have now played two matches each, with India topping the table with six points. Australia and New Zealand follow with four each. 

The Aussies began with skipper Nikki Hudson scoring from the very first move in the second minute of the game.

The Aussies also earned eight penalty corners in the first half, but could convert only one ? through Nicole Arnold in the 30th. 

The Aussies then messed up a penalty stroke in the 53rd, while squandering as many as 13 penalty corner conversion chances. 

Malaysias repeated counter-attacks eventually earned them a penalty stroke in the 69th and Sitti Noor Ruhani didnt make a mistake. 

Earlier, skipper Muirhead opened New Zealands account with a penalty corner conversion in the 20th; 

Italy levelled 12 minutes later via a penalty stroke through Faustini Francesca.

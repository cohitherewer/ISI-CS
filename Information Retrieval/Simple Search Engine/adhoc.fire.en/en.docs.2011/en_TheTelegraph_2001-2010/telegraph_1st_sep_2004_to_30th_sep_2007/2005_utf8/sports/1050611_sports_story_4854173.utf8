 Liverpool allowed to defend title

London: Liverpool will be allowed to defend their Champions League title next season and the Uefa has changed its rules for future competitions, European soccers governing body said Friday. 

Liverpools failure to finish in the Premier Leagues top four meant they were not entitled to a place in next seasons Champions League, despite lifting the trophy after a penalty shootout win over AC Milan in last months final. 

Uefas executive committee decided, however, in an exceptional decision to allow them into the competitions first qualifying round, with their opening match on July 12 or 13. The draw for the first qualifying round is on June 24. 

To retain the Champions League title next season Liverpool would have to play 19 matches. 

It means that England will have five representatives in the competition, champions Chelsea, runners-up Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton and Liverpool. 

It is the first time any country has had five representatives in the continents premier club competition and, according to Uefa, it will be the last. 

From next season, a club winning the Champions League but finishing outside their countrys allocation will qualify automatically at the expense of the lowest of the clubs above them. 

Liverpools presence next season means that the four other English clubs financial share in the Champions League will be reduced as the pot is cut five ways. 

There will be no country protection for Liverpool, Uefa said, meaning they could be drawn against another English side, including city rivals Everton, if they progress to the latter stages. 

It is also good news for Fenerbahce, Wisla Krakow, and the teams vying for the Romanian league title. 

Because the Uefa had always allocated a slot in the group stage for the holders, Liverpools absence opened a slot that will now be filled by Turkish champions Fenerbahce, who originally would have had to play in the third qualifying round. (Reuters)

 Bucharest: Arges Pitesti have rejected Juventus striker Adrian Mutu?s offer to buy a majority stake in the Romanian first division side, a club spokesman said on Tuesday. ?The club?s board decided to double its share capital so the club does not need Mutu?s support anymore,? the spokesman said.

 Last week, the 26-year-old Mutu said he wanted to invest 1.5 million euros ($1.79 million) to buy 51 percent of the club, with whom he started his career before going on to play for Dinamo Bucharest, Inter Milan, Verona, Parma and Chelsea.

 Pitesti owes more than one million euros to the state and local tax authorities tried, without success, to sell some of the club?s assets last month. Current shareholders are now expected to invest the funds that are needed. Mutu was not immediately available for comment. 

 Berlin: Schalke 04 have dismissed Ralf Rangnick, three days after the coach announced he would be leaving at the end of the season. ?We had no other option. There were issues that we couldnt resolve,? club manager Rudi Assauer told a news conference on Monday.

 Rangnick, whose team failed to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League last week, said on Friday he planned to step down from the club he joined just over a year ago when his contract ran out in July 2006. He was quoted as saying he was ?sick of the political shenanigans? at the club.

 Lisbon: Porto striker Helder Postiga has joined French club St Etienne on a six-month loan deal, the Portuguese Premier League team said on their website on Monday. No financial details were disclosed but media reports said the two clubs had agreed a fee of 500,000 euros ($594,400) for the loan and 6 million euros if the Ligue 1 side decide to take up a permanent option on the player at the end of the season.

 Portuguese international Postiga, who has won 21 caps, began his career at Porto and moved back to the club in July 2004 following one season in England with Tottenham Hotspur.

 Brussels: European soccer?s governing body Uefa is launching an investigation into the alleged trafficking of child players by football agents. Chief executive Lars-Christer Olsen said on Tuesday that Uefa had evidence of soccer ?camps? in eastern and southern Europe being used to bring children into the region illegally. ?Children as young as under 10 are being brought in with the view of eventually selling them on as players to big clubs,? Olsen said. ?We intend to investigate these reports.?

 New Delhi: The Asian Invitational International Boxing Tournament, scheduled to be held in Pune next month, has been scrapped due to ?administrative reasons?. An Indian Amateur Boxing Federation official on Tuesday cited inadequate participation as the reason for not holding the tournament from January 7 to 12.

 Beijing: Ace Chinese hurdler, Liu Xiang on Tuesday said he hopes to have some rest next year before starting preparations in 2007 for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. ?I?m expecting to have an easy season since only two major events awaits in 2006,? Liu said before leaving for Italy to run the torch relay for the 2006 Turin Winter Olympic Games

 Perera arrest 

Colombo: Former Sri Lanka allrounder Suresh Perera has been arrested on assault charges, police said on Saturday. 

Perera was drinking at home with friends last week when they were allegedly antagonised by a group of men and drawn into a fight that left two in hospital. The 27-year-old was arrested and held in custody overnight before being released on bail. (Reuters)

 Sania in second round

New York: Sania Mirza became first the Indian woman to win a match at the US Open after she battled poor form and fitness problems to clinch a thrilling first round win in womens singles at the Flushing Meadows on Monday (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). 

Sania, hampered by a strained abdominal muscle, needed to dig deep into her reserves to outclass 19-year-old Mashona Washington of the US 7-6 (8-6), 6-7 (6-8), 6-4 in two hours and 13 minutes. 

Sania now plays Italys 81st ranked Maria Elena Camerin who ousted 21st ranked Dinara Safina of Russia. 

In a low quality contest where both players committed too many unforced errors and frequently squandered advantageous positions, the 18-year-old Indian showed a steady head in handling the pressure to come through a worthy winner. 

Mashona, ranked 65, blew hot and cold. The American had 38 winners as against Sanias 21 and at times showed more variation. Whenever she came up to the net, the Indian had no answer. 

But Mashona also had a high number of unforced errors, 52 compared to Sanias 45, and as many as eight double faults. 

That the Indian had two less winning points in the match than her opponent, 115 to 117, and was still able to come through only showed her maturity in handling crunch situations.

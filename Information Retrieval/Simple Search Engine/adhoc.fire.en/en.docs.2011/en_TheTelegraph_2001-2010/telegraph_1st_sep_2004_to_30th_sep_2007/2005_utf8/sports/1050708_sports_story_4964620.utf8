 New Yorkers never got behind the 2012 movement

In the summer of 2012, the New York Olympics will go on as scheduled. Folks will wrestle over cabs. Most will keep pole vaulting over the soaring cost of housing. Police officers and teachers will continue boxing the bureaucrats for decent paychecks. And you know everyone will line up for the rat race. 

Nothing will disrupt the chaotic daily life of New Yorkers as we know it, or make it more complicated and challenging than it already is. Thats how the people want it. And thats why New York didnt come close to getting the other Olympics. 

It didnt matter who went to Singapore on New Yorks behalf to provide a glowing recommendation: the mayor, the Greatest, Senator Hillary and other assorted beautiful people. We couldve sent Henry Hudson and the American Indians who gave Manhattan away for $24. It wouldnt have made a difference. 

It was all about selling the Olympics on New Yorkers, and the organisers never did that. The people who hand out Olympic host invitations love it when cities want them very badly and will do whatever it takes. I 

When they receive mixed signals or worse, dead signals, theyre more likely to thumb their noses back. Thats what happened Wednesday when the worlds greatest city couldnt even beat out Madrid. When word reached us around 6:30 am that New York was finished, people around here reacted the way they always do at that time of day: They yawned. 

From the very start of this ambitious plan, there was no groundswell of support from the grassroots, no spirit, no unified effort between the big shots and the citizens, no passion by all of New York to get the Olympics. This was a one-sided effort from Mayor Bloomberg that was almost entirely driven by politics, his place in history and the desire to get a Manhattan address for the Jets. 

The mayor and his cronies tried hard; give them that. They kept insisting how New York could use the Olympics, but the reality was more the opposite. The Olympics woul-dve benefited from the marketing, the media, the money, the exposure and the cache that New York can uniquely provide. 

Plus, through the sheer diversity of its people, no other city in the world truly reflects the Olympic movement. But what was in it for New York? Besides the hassle, of course. New York didnt need the Olympics for an ego boost. The summer tourist dollars flow here anyway, so that wasnt an issue. Theres no part of the city that needs the kind of facelift thats often accomplished through construction for the Olympics. 

Sporting entertainment is provided by the Yankees and Mets. Its not that New York cant handle something on the gargantuan scale of the Olympics. The people looked at the Games and saw only potential headaches. Lets not bother discussing security and transportation, even as sophisticated as both might be seven years from now. 

Turning over the city for a few weeks, and dealing with years of preparation, just wasnt an option for a good many people, and the reward for enduring the Games just wasnt worth it. Had the people been on board, the West Side stadium would be a reality and the Games wouldnt be far behind. 

Had the New York bid been swelled by passion and fuelled by support from those who matter most, there would be the same size of anticipation in Manhattan Wednesday as there was in London and Paris. New York could not be rescued by desire, and believe this: It wont in 2016, either. You get the sense this was a one-shot deal.

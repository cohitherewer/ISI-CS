 Fransa down Mahindra

Mumbai: Fransa Pax FC punished a lethargic Mahindra United by a solitary first-half goal to climb up to the fourth spot in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup on Monday. 

Fransa scored the winner in the 24th minute through skipper Jules Alberto, who headed in past the Mumbai team?s custodian Sunder Rajan. 

The spadework for the only goal of the match, which was otherwise scrappy and boring till an action-packed last ten minutes, was done by the Goans? Nigerian import Benjamim Ansah, who nodded forward a corner kick taken by medio Peter Rodrigues. 

Mahindra hardly had a look at the rival goal throughout the first half and spoiled moves through mispasses or loss of possession. 

Today?s win took Fransa?s tally to 21 from 13 matches, while Mahindra stood rooted on 19 from 13 ties. They now occupy the fifth slot. 

Churchill face Dempo 

Strikers Yusif Yakubu and Marcos Pereira hold the key to Churchill Brothers? success when they take on Dempo in Margao on Tuesday. 

Churchill, who drew with Dempo goalless in the first leg, have had an unimpressive run so far, collecting only 13 points from 12 matches. They have been conceding silly goals and need to tighten up their deep defence. (PTI)

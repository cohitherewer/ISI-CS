USA reduced the margin when H Bach and Malythong got the better of Sanave Thomas and Rupesh Kumar 17-14, 15-11 in the mens doubles but Gutta then teamed up with Shruti Kurian to beat Lee and Mesinee 15-10, 15-6 and complete the scoreline. 

Meanwhile, Scotland defeated Wales 4-1 in the other encounter to register their first win in the sub group.

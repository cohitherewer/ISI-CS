The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Carlos Moya tipped to retain title

 - I couldn?t believe my eyes seeing what the tsunami had done to this wonderful place: Leander Paes 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Chennai: The SDAT Stadium in Nungambakkam is a good 6-km from the Marina Beach. The tsunami-triggered devastation that changed life in this southern metropolis the Sunday after Christmas has left not a trace of destruction at the venue of the Chennai Open and its vicinity. Deep down, in human hearts and minds, though, the scars are as visible as the tennis stars flocking Chennai for one of the year?s three ATP Tour lung-openers (along with Doha and Adelaide). 

There hasn?t been a single major pullout from south Asia?s only top-flight ATP event and the organizers must be thanking their stars. Especially the rate at which rumours of an epidemic in the entire south Asia spread across the globe in the last few days. But that doesn?t mean players have shut tsunami out of their lives. Top seed Carlos Moya, here to defend his crown, had doubts after hearing the news back home. It took an assurance from his manager Fernando Soler, who also happens to be the tournament director of the Chennai Open, to convince Moya. 

?The fact that the ATP is going ahead with this tournament means there is no risk for the players? I think it?s important for the players to support this event and the victims in whatever way they can,? Moya observed. 

Our very own Leander Paes was visibly shaken talking about the tragedy. Within hours of landing in Chennai Sunday morning, the Indian Davis Cup captain drove down to Marina Beach. 

?This was where we used to run and train every morning for a period of five years? I couldn?t believe my eyes seeing what the tsunami had done to this wonderful place,? said Paes, who spent the formative years of his career at the BAT Academy here. Paes has decided to donate his proze-money for the Tsunami victims. 

Even as the players join the rest of the world in showering support on those who experienced the tragedy, the city is fully geared to host its ninth edition of this blue riband sporting extravaganza. 

It?s been a long time since India?s biggest tennis meet came to this city after a one-off show in Delhi, but it will be a new beginning all the same. For the first time, the tournament doesn?t have a title sponsor, but a consortium of sponsors running the show. None other than Vijay Amritraj took the initiative in ensuring that the event stayed in his own city after Tata Group decided to end their three-year association. And going by the preparations, it promises to be another mega-hit. 

Few have forgotten last year?s epic final featuring Moya and Paradorn Srichaphan, which the Spaniard won in three tough sets. A look at the draw suggests an encore can happen. Moya, coming off a great year capped by Spain?s Davis Cup triumph, is getting better with age. At 28, the Geneva-based pro with Hollywood looks believes he can retain his title. 

?I am here to win it again but I have to be careful early on,? Moya said. ?I finished the year on a high but it?s always a bit difficult after coming out of a break. The first two rounds will be important.? That?s more humility than reality. Moya is clearly the best bet to lift the trophy in a week?s time.

Moya opens against a qualifier but his first test could be against precocious French teenager Paul-Henri Mathieu who is in the same half of the draw. 

Srichaphan didn?t have a particularly memorable 2004, but that shouldn?t be a deterrent for the friendly Thai who has a special affinity for Chennai. The only player to feature in three back-to-back finals here, Srichaphan faces Belgian journeyman Christophe Rochus before facing sterner opposition. 

Lurking in Srichaphan?s half is fourth seed Jonas Bjorkman. The 31-year Swede is more of a doubles celebrity but never has he shied away from singles. 

As for the Indian challenge, the prospects look as bleak as ever. Paes, the lone Indian to have made a mark here in singles here, opens against sixth seeded Yen-Hsun Lu from Chinese Taipei. The Indian, a wild-card entry, has been off singles for years now and few will bet on a decent run this time. 

Two other Indians have also got wild cards, Prakash Amritraj and Karan Rastogi. Of course it will be too much to expect great performances from either of them. 

The Indians? focus will certainly be on doubles with 

top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Bjorkman drawn to meet Paes and his new partner 

Nenad Zimonjic in the final. What a treat that will be for the tennis-loving fans 

here!

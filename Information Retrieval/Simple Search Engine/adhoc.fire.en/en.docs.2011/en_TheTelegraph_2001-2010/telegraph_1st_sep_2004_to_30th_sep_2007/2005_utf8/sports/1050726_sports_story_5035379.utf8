 Atwal finishes tied 26th

 Arjun Atwal 

Milwaukee: Arjun Atwals putter went cold on the final day as he went over-par for the first time in the week and ended tied 26th in the US Bank championships here. 

Atwal, who started the day at nine-under, finished at eight-under 272 for a cheque of $29,260 to carry his total prize money sum to $802,881. 

Meanwhile, Daniel Chopra suffered a back nine collapse with four bogeys that saw him crash from a tied fifth place at one stage to tied 31st. 

Ben Crane, the leader for first three rounds, had no hiccups nor did he go for any heroics, as he carded a steady one-under 69 to win his second career title. 

Crane beat his closest rival Scott Verplank by four shots and with a 72-hole total of 20-under 260 he grabbed a cheque of $684,000. 

Cranes fourth straight round in the 60s included an eagle, two birdies and three bogeys. After a birdie on 17th, the 29-year-old had a four-stroke advantage at the 18th tee. He duly parred and took the title. 

Atwal started on the first and managed only pars for the first three holes and then dropped one at fourth. He got that shot back with a birdie on sixth, but a double bogey on the eighth, his first of the week, spoilt his card. He did manage birdies on the tenth and 15th, but in between dropped a bogey on 13th to end at one-over 71. 

Atwals driving and iron play were well above average, but the 32 putts that he took to complete his round derailed all his chances. This was indeed a pity considering Atwal is currently second on the overall putting average list. 

His score at the par-fives was nine-under for the week, but that was small consolation as putts did not fall on many other holes. 

The Indian takes a break from US Tour and will play in the Scandinavian Masters next week. 

Chopra starting the day at 11-under and tied sixth promised big with a birdie on first and again on sixth as he was inside top-five at 13-under. But then came the collapse. 

He dropped shot on seventh and ninth. On the back nine, he bogeyed three holes in a row from 12th to 14th and then added one more on 16th to complete a miserable final round of four-over 74. Though he putted alright, his driving and iron play let him down as the winds played up. 

Chad Campbell had a great final day with five-under 65 to climb to third place at 15-under 265. Jeff Sluman (68) was fourth at 14 under. 

For Crane, his only previous win came at the 2003 Bellsouth Classic. (PTI)

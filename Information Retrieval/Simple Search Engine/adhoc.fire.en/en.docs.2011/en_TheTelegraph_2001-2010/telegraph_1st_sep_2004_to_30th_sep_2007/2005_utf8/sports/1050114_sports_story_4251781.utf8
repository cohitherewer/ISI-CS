 Mukesh in sole lead

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mukesh Kumar fired a superb four-under 68 to displace five way leaders and gain a three shot lead at the end of the third round of the Eastern India Open at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Friday. 

The 12th leg of the Amby Valley PGAI Tour is set to witness a scintillating finish as three shots behind in second place was overnight joint leader and local favourite Rafiq Ali. He compiled an even par round of 72. Joining Mukesh and Rafiq in Friday?s leadergroup will be Sanjay Kumar, who shot a 2-under 70 to compliment his opening round of even par 72. 

Gaurav Ghosh stayed in the lead for the amateur title with a two round total of 164 but he will have to watch his back on the final day as top junior Karan Singh is on his trail just four shots behind at 168.

Madrid: Cameroon striker Samuel Eto and newly-crowned World Player of the Year Ronaldinho on Tuesday set up a 2-0 league win over Celta Vigo for Barcelona ? their 13th consecutive victory in all competitions. 

Eto scored both goals, in the 38th and 57th minute, to take his tally for the season to 17, with Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho involved in the build-up to both. 

Celta made Barcelona work hard for the victory in a first half where they could easily have taken the lead, but it was Barcelona who finished the stronger with visiting keeper Esteban preventing the score from creeping higher. 

Barcelona moved up to 40 points after 17 games, extending their lead at the top of the table to five points over second-placed Osasuna, who play Atletico Madrid at home on Thursday. 

Barcelona laid siege to Celtas goal early on with Ronaldinho showing few signs of suffering from being delayed in Switzerland overnight, after Mondays Player of the Year award ceremony. 

As the home side piled forward in search of goals, they left themselves open to counter-attacks. In the 32nd minute, Celtas Brazilian striker Fernando Baiano pulled wide in the area and crashed a shot against Victor Valdes far post. 

Two minutes later, another Barcelona attack floundered and Uruguayan midfielder Fabian Canobbio sent Baiano racing through to be denied in a one-on-one by Valdes. 

Barcelona took the lead soon after with a craftily worked opener when Ronaldinho took a quick free-kick on the edge of the area, which he had won, while Celtas players disputed the decision. 

His pass put Eto clear in the area and from a tight angle he lifted the ball over the advancing Esteban into the far corner. Andres Iniesta, who has been drafted into midfield to cover for the injured Xavi, proved he is more than just a stand-in in the build-up to the second goal. 

Ronaldinho fed Iniesta on the edge of the area, surrounded by four blue shirts. The 21-year-old spun round and threaded a pass to the lurking Eto, who snapped a shot high into the corner. 

Second-half substitute Ludovic Giuly almost added a third when he cut in off the right flank, played a one-two with Eto in the area, only to be denied by Esteban. The Celta keeper saved from Giuly again in the final minute. 

In England, Manchester United won 3-1 at Birmingham City to reach the League Cup semis and Wigan Athletic continued their dream season by joining them courtesy a 2-0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers. 

Two goals for Louis Saha and one for Park Ji-sung gave United a comfortable victory and a place in the last-four for the second successive season, while two for Jason Roberts late in the first half sent Wigan into their first major semi-final in their maiden season in top-flight football. 

United, out of Shampions League and nine points adrift of Chelsea in the Premiership, fielded a strong side in a competition that has suddenly become an important part of their season. 

They started well and Giuseppe Rossi hit the bar in an early attack but Birmingham settled and held their own until half-time. It all changed at the start of the second half, with the introduction of Wayne Rooney adding spark to the United attack. 

The goals came from less familiar sources, however. Injury-ravaged French striker Saha slid in to convert a Cristiano Ronaldo cross two minutes after the restart and then turned provider as he set up Korean midfielder Park to shoot home his first goal for the club. 

Saha, whose season began a month ago following a string of injuries, then smashed in the third in the 63 minute before Jiri Jarosik headed a consolation for Birmingham in the 75th. 

Wigan, who ended a run of five successive league defeats with a 3-0 win over Charlton on Saturday, continued their recovery with an impressive victory over a Bolton side fresh from beating Everton 4-0 in the league. Roberts fired in the opening goal from 10 metres out after 40 minutes and doubled Wigans tally with a similar effort five minutes later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Drivers unite against Mosley

 KEVIN EASON 

 Mosley?s cancellation 

 of a drivers? meeting sparked the move 

 Max Mosley?s hard line towards 

 Formula One?s drivers rebounded on Wednesday as they formed 

 a united front against the FIA president.

 Mark Webber, a key member of the 

 Formula One drivers? unofficial union, the Grand Prix Drivers? 

 Association (GPDA), gave warning that they want their voices 

 to be heard and would not be muzzled by the FIA, the sport?s 

 governing body.

 Webber spoke out after Mosley 

 withdrew from a meeting with the GPDA, scheduled for Friday 

 at Silverstone during preparations for the British Grand 

 Prix. Drivers wanted the chance to discuss safety at test 

 sessions, where they believe medical facilities are not 

 as highly geared as they are at races such as Silverstone 

 this weekend.

 Mosley is said to have phoned 

 David Coulthard, the GPDA chairman, after the debacle, admonishing 

 him for his criticism of the authorities and the teams for 

 allowing a worldwide audience to witness their inability 

 to come to a deal that would have allowed a proper race 

 to go ahead.

 Coulthard compounded the supposed 

 felony after Sunday?s grand prix in France by criticising 

 rules on engines and qualifying in The Times on Tuesday. 

 Mosley was so upset that he cancelled the meeting at Silverstone, 

 but Webber stepped into the row Wednesday by giving warning 

 that the drivers will not be turned away, particularly when 

 there are safety issues at stake.

 ?There are some concerns from 

 the GPDA after Indianapolis,? he said. ?We work together, 

 all the drivers. Time will tell if the drivers are a voice 

 when it comes to these matters. We don?t want to run the 

 sport, but we are part of the whole deal. It?s all about 

 the drivers. The public come to see the drivers.

 ?Look at Spain ? five years ago 

 there were 30,000 people at the race and now there are over 

 100,000, and that?s because we have a Spanish guy in Fernando 

 Alonso leading the championship. We are important when we 

 are united and it?s good that we can stand up for the sport 

 we love, because essentially we are all fans of Formula 

 One.?

 Coulthard should have no worries 

 that he will be left alone in what is rapidly becoming a 

 stand-off with the FIA.

 A letter to Mosley signed by all 

 race drivers, with the exception of Coulthard and Christian 

 Klien, his Red Bull Racing teammate, and Michael Schumacher 

 registers their concern that, ?during the course of this 

 telephone conversation (with Coulthard), you suggested the 

 FIA might withdraw support for the ongoing safety initiatives 

 of the GPDA?.

 With Mosley in conflict with the 

 drivers, he will be hard pushed to find anyone on his side 

 when he arrives at Silverstone.

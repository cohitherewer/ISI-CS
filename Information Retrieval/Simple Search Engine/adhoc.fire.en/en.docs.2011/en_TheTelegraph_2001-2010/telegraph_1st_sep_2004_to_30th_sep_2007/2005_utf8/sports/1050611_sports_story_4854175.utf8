 Glazer to make tickets dearer

 - New owner wants to boost United revenues

 Glazer also plans to have a United show tie in Florida 

Manchester United ticket prices are to rise by 54 per cent within five years, under plans by Malcolm Glazer, the clubs new owner, to boost club revenues to ?246 million by 2010. Previously unseen documents shown to The Times indicate that the American tycoon is also planning to increase the cost of attending Champions League matches by as much as 25 per cent from next year. 

The plans are likely to fuel fears that United ticket prices will move beyond the reach of ordinary fans, and comes as the Office of Fair Trading considers intervening in Glazers ?790 million takeover to protect United followers from what might be soaring prices. 

According to the documents, which detail Glazers vision for the worlds richest football club, United players will also be expected to play a showcase match each year in Tampa, Glazers hometown in Florida. The game, designed to boost club revenues by ?2 million, will be in addition to the teams annual tour commitments in the US, Europe or Asia. 

The documents also indicate that Glazer is likely to have agreed a deal with the bankers that could make it difficult for United to sign top stars such as Wayne Rooney, who cost them ?27 million. 

Under the terms of the debt contract, the amount of money United have to spend on transfers has been set at ?25 million a year excluding receipts from player sales, over the next five years, although a further ? 25 million in total can be spent over that period. 

The documents also show that Glazer intends to boost Uniteds total revenues by 52 per cent to ?245.6 million by 2010, up from ?161.5 million this year. He expects the rise to be supported by an increase of 61 per cent in match day turnover, of 13 per cent in media turnover and 76 per cent in commercial turnover. 

United fans will be expected to pay an average of ?46 per ticket for home games in 2010, just below the current cost of an average Chelsea ticket, the most expensive in the league. The price of an average United ticket, expected to be ?29.90 this season, will jump to ?33.40 next year, ?38.70 in 2007, ?41 in 2008 and ?43.40 in 2009. Manchester United tickets are currently in the mid range of Premiership prices. 

According to the FSA Premier League National Fan Survey Report, the average Manchester United fan earns ?34,000 per year, against the ?48,000 earned by the average Chelsea fan. 

Fans are likely to be further angered by Glazers plans to raise the price of general admission tickets to Champions League quarter and semi-final matches by 25 per cent, and to second-round Champions League matches by 12.5 per cent. Executive seating tickets for all European games will be raised by 25 per cent next year, although there will be no price rise for executive boxes. 

A source close to the Glazer camp said: It is important to stress that these plans are fluid and nothing is set in stone at this stage. 

The documents, which were prepared this month, also detail the huge interest repayments that Glazer will have to make on the ?275 million of preferred securities that he sold to three New York hedge funds to help to finance his controversial takeover of United. 

He will have to make annual payments of 20 per cent, or more than four times the current interest rate, on ?210 million of these securities and 14 per cent on the remaining ?65 million. The preferred securities give the hedge funds ? Citadel Horizon, Perry Capital and Ochs-Ziff ? the right to take 30 per cent of Uniteds equity in 2010, along with proportionate representation on the clubs board. The money raised through the preferred securities is on top of the ?374 million that Glazer has already borrowed from a syndicate of banks led by JP Morgan. 

Glazer, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, took control of United late last month in a swoop on the majority stake owned by the Irish horseracing tycoons John Magnier and J.P. McManus. As of May 23, he held 76.2 per cent of the clubs shares. 

His offer to buy the remaining stake closes at 3 pm on Monday, when the Glazers will disclose how much of the equity they own. The board has recommended acceptance of the offer. 

If the Glazers fail to secure 90 per cent acceptance, the point at which they could forcibly buy out minority shareholders, the total cost of the takeover will be ?767 million. 

If Glazer does secure 100 per cent, the total cost of his takeover will be ?831.3 million, including ?34 million of banking and legal fees.

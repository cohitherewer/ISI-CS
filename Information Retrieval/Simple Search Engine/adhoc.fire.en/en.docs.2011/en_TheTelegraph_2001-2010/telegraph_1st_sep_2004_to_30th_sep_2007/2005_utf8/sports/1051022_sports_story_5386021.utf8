 Performance analyst for Australians

Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) moved to strengthen their national coaching set-up with the appointment of Richard McInnes as a full-time performance analyst, the organisation said on Friday. 

A senior coach at CAs centre of excellence, McInnes will be responsible for co-ordinating the teams video and computer analysis. As part of the detailed review of Australias current team management structure, a need was identified to split the roles of assistant coach and performance analyst, CA chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement. 

CA also said on Friday that Creagh Connor had succeeded outgoing chairman Bob Merriman, who completed his term. Connor was appointed to the CA board in 1998 and was made deputy chairman in 2004 before his latest promotion.

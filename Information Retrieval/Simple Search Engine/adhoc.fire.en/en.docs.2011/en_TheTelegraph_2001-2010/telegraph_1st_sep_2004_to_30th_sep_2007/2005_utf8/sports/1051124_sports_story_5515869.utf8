 5-wkt haul for Sourav

 - RANJI TROPHY 

 Maharashtra 307/9 at close 

 Sourav rattled the top order 

Pune: Sourav Ganguly on Wednesday justified his inclusion in the Indian squad for the first Test against Sri Lanka claiming a five-wicket haul for Bengal in their Elite Ranji Trophy group A match against Maharashtra at the Nehru Stadium here. 

Bowling as a first change after Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta won the toss and put Maharashtra into bat, Sourav took five for 64 in 22 overs. 

With his gentle mediumpace, Sourav rattled the top-order although Maharashtra recovered from the early blows to post 307 for nine at stumps on Day I of the four-day match. 

Interestingly, the recovery was staged by fast bowler Munaf Patel who scored 78 with seven fours and four sixes on his debut for Maharashtra after switching over from Mumbai. 

Patel was due to play for Board Presidents XI against the Sri Lankans in a three-day match starting on November 26 in Bangalore, but has preferred to stay on and play in this match. 

Maharashtra wicketkeeper Satyajit Satbhai was another notable contributor for his team making 47 runs with seven fours. 

Bengal mediumpacer Shib Shankar Paul took one wicket and off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri claimed two.

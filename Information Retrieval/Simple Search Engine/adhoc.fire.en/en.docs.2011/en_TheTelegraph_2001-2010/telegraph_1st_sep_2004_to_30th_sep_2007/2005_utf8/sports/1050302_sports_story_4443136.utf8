 Allan Rae no more

Kingston: Allan Rae, former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) president and Test batsman, is no more. 

He died on Sunday, the Jamaica Cricket Association announced on Monday. He was 82 and is survived by one sister. 

The cause of death was not disclosed. 

Rae opened for the West Indies in 15 Tests. He scored 1,016 runs at an average of 46.18 with four centuries, including one against India in Mumbai in 1948 in his second appearance. 

Rae formed a strong opening partnership with Trinidadian Jeffrey Stollmeyer. He was a member of the West Indies squad which defeated England for the first time in a Test series in 1950. 

During Rae?s tenure as WICB president from the late 1970s to the mid 1980s, top players defected to Australian tycoon Kerry Packer?s World Series Cricket and rebel tours in apartheid-ruled South Africa.

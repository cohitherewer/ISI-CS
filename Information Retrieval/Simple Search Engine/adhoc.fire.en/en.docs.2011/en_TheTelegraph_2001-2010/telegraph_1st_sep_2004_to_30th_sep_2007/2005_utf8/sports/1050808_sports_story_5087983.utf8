 Martyn goes the Warne way

Sydney: After Shane Warne, it is his teammate Damien Martyn to suffer the mobile message effect. 

In yet another embarrassment to the touring Australians, Martyns former fianc?e Helen Appleyard revealed how she called off their wedding after finding messages from another female on the batsmans mobile phone. 

The cricketer was due to marry Helen in June 2003, but eight weeks before their wedding, she discovered the messages from Martyns secret South African lover while he was having surgery in a Perth hospital. 

I found a string of messages on his mobile just weeks before our wedding, I was devastated, she says in a womens magazine. 

The couple had been together two years and became engaged during a holiday in Bali. 

Helens revelations came following reports of worlds leading wicket taker Warnes alleged indiscretions. 

The master bowler, who is just one wicket short of becoming the first player to take 600 Test wickets, formally separated from his wife Simone recently. 

The split came after British newspapers published a series of allegations linking him to other women and his pursuit of them with raunchy text messages. 

Helen said in her interview that she failed to understand why Simone had stood by her husband for so long. 

Im surprised Simone tolerated Shane Warnes behaviour for so long, she said, according to an Australian website. 

For me, the moment I found out Damien was cheating I was out of there. I was heartbroken. (PTI)

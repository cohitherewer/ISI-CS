London: A total of 23 teams go into Saturdays World Cup qualifiers around the globe with a hope of securing a place in next years finals in Germany. 

Depending on what the results are, as many as 15 could see their dreams become reality as they attempt to book their berths alongside the 10 countries already through which include the host nation and world champions Brazil. 

The Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ecuador, Togo, Ghana and Tunisia are among those who need just one point to qualify. 

Others, such as Senegal, surprise quarter finalists in their first World Cup finals in 2002, and Ivory Coast, hoping to reach the finals for the first time, must win and hope others slip up if they are to succeed. 

Almost 40 qualifiers are being played worldwide on Saturday followed by another full round in Europe, South America and Concacaf, the North American and Caribbean zone, next Wednesday. 

By then the identity of 27 of the 32 finalists should be known with the five outstanding berths to be filled in Novembers play-offs. 

Ukraine are the only European qualifiers known so far but they could be joined by as many as seven others on Saturday. 

The Netherlands will qualify from Group I if they avoid defeat against the Czech Republic in Prague, but even if they lose they will stay atop and should clinch their place against Macedonia at home next Wednesday. 

Portugal, five points clear of Slovakia and Russia in Group III, will also qualify, if, as expected, they avoid losing at home to Liechtenstein. 

The Portuguese will take nothing for granted against their visitors after they were held to a 2-2 draw in Vaduz a year ago. 

Italy also need only a point at home against Slovenia to maintain their record of qualifying for every finals since 1962 and will be keen to avenge their defeat in Slovenia a year ago. 

France, world champions in 1998 who surprisingly went out in the first round four years ago, will seal first place in the tightly-bunched Group IV if they win in Switzerland, although the Swiss will go through if they beat France and Ireland fail to win in Cyprus. 

If England bounce back from their shock 0-1 defeat to Northern Ireland in Belfast last month by beating Austria at Old Trafford, they can qualify for the finals if the Czech Republic lose at home to Netherlands in Group I. 

That scenario would guarantee England finish among the best two runners-up in Europe, guaranteed to join the eight group winners who automatically go through. 

Two of the four automatic South American qualifying berths have already been filled by Argentina and Brazil and Ecuador and Paraguay could join them on Saturday.

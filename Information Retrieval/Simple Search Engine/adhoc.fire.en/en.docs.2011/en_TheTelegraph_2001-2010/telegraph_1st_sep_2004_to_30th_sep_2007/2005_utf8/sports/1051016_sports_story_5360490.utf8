 Anand finishes second

 - WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 

 - Topalov ends with draw vs Polgar 

San Luis (Argentina): Viswanathan Anand secured a quick draw with black pieces with Russian Peter Svidler in the final round to finish a commendable second in the World Chess Championship here. 

Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, who had already claimed the championship, completed the formalities with a quick draw against tailender Judit Polgar of Hungary. The Bulgarian tallied an impressive 10 points out of a possible 14. 

With the victory, Topalov went home richer by $300000 and if he does not lose any rating points before January, will also cross the 2800 Elo rating barrier for the first time ever. The Bulgarian will be the third player in history to achieve this feat after Russians Garri Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik. 

Anand finished with a score of 8.5 points along with Svidler but the Indian finished second thanks to a better tie-break score. 

The fourth place went to Russian Alexander Morozevich who finished with 7 points, half a point clear of Peter Leko of Hungary. 

In the final round Morozevich drew with Michael Adams of England while Leko defeated last years winner Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan, who finished sixth on 5.5 points with a superior tie-break than Adams. Polgar finished at the bottom of the table on 4.5 points. 

Anand had no trouble whatsoever in getting a draw with black pieces against Svidler. It was a petrof defence wherein Svidler failed to eject any life in the middle game. 

Routine exchanges led to a balanced position quickly and the truce was signed in just 19 moves. Anand also stands to gain a few Elo points from this event which will take the Indian ace closer to 2800 rating. 

Topalov faced the Queens Indian defence by Polgar and after just 18 moves the players split the point. 

The days lone decisive victory was scored by Leko who put up a spirited show to beat Kasimdzhanov in a Sicilian Paulsen game. Playing white, Leko went for the kill in the middle game with a direct attack and was duly rewarded. The Hungarian first won a pawn and later an exchange to record a smooth victory in 48 moves. 

Morozevich tried hard to break the defences of Adams but lost a piece in the endgame, arising out of a closed Ruy Lopez. However, there was still some counter play left for the Russian and eventually peace was signed when all the pawns got traded. The game lasted 54 moves. 

 FINAL STANDINGS 

1. Topalov (10 points); 2. Anand (8.5); 3. Svidler (8.5); 4. Morozevich (7); 5. Leko (6.5); 6. Kasimdzhanov (5.5); 7. Adams (5.5); 8. Polgar (4.5).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dutta basks in the glory

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: If it was Amal Duttas day, he let it rip. 

The Mohun Bagan coach attributed his teams amazing turnaround to his power of observation. 

When I was called in, Bagan were in dire straits. Owing to my sixth sense, I quickly realised what the problem was and the result is evident, Dutta said, adding, I asked the administration to back the young players and as you can see, I didnt effect a single substitution. My boys outpaced them for the better part of the match. 

Dutta defended his approach towards the last 10 minutes on Saturday. Defensive football is also a valid way of playing. The way Bagan made a habit out of losing the match in the dying moments has been put to rest. 

East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick rued the lack of a striker. We created chances but failed to convert them. The way Subrata Pal saved Malsawmtluangas shot was brilliant to say the least. I didnt have any striker either. Vijayan is only a 20-minute player and I had to persist with him for 90 minutes. Whom do I replace him with?, he posed.

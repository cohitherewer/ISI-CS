 Anelka high on Newcastle wish-list

 GEORGE CAULKIN 

 Anelka wants to 

 move to Newcastle, says Souness 

 Few modern footballers divide 

 opinion as much as Nicolas Anelka, but Graeme Souness is 

 the latest manager to believe that he can tame a famously 

 nomadic and truculent player. Depending on your viewpoint, 

 the France centre forward is either a misunderstood genius 

 or a disloyal sulker, yet he has emerged as one of Newcastle 

 Uniteds leading targets in the transfer market.

 Anelka swapped Manchester City 

 for Fenerbahce for a fee of ?7 million only last January, 

 but, according to Souness, the 26-year-old is enthusiastic 

 about moving to St James Park. His brief spell in 

 Turkey ? he signed a three-season contract with the Istanbul 

 club, with an option for a further season ? has been mixed, 

 featuring four goals, a league title and increasing disaffection.

 That scenario may be familiar 

 to supporters of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City 

 (as well as Paris Saint-German and Real Madrid), but he 

 remains an established forward blessed with pace and talent 

 who has commanded ?43.5 million in transfer fees and who 

 should be approaching his physical peak. Souness is content 

 that Anelkas brittle attitude is not a concern and 

 hopes that a bid of ?4 million may snare him for Newcastle.

 I know Nicolas is desperate 

 to come here, Souness said. I have done a lot 

 of checks on him and everyone is telling me that he has 

 got his head right. Last season was not great for him, but 

 no one can say that Nicolas Anelka is not a proven, top 

 goalscorer and there are not that many around who are available. 

 He has amassed 65 goals in 150 league starts in the Premiership.

 Souness reiterated that Jermaine 

 Jenas is not available. It would take an offer of about 

 ?20 million to persuade Newcastle to rethink, although that 

 stance would be tested if Jenas submitted a transfer request 

 or intimated that he was unsettled.

 At this stage, there is no suggestion 

 of that and while the midfield player has been omitted from 

 Newcastles 18-man squad that is in Slovakia for Sundays 

 Intertoto Cup match against Dubnica, it is not a sinister 

 development.

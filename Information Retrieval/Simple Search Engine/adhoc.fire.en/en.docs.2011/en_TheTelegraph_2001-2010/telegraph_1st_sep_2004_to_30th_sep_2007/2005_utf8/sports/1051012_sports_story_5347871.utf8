Sydney: The World XIs appalling show in the ODI version of the Super Series has drawn much flak ? all of it deserved, mind you ? but one Brian Charles Lara is hopeful of a considerably improved show in the six-day Super Test here from Friday. 

All three ODIs, in Melbourne, went Australias way by big margins: 93 runs, 55 runs and a whopping 156 runs. Laras own scores were embarrassing ? 0, 5, 0. 

Theres a professional duty to do our best. Moreover, the longer version of the game allows natural ability to come out... Talking of myself, Test cricket is what Im more comfortable with, Lara pointed out at the end of a rather demanding workout at the SCG on Tuesday afternoon. 

He added: As a concept, the Super Series is good. However, it takes time to gel and start thinking as a team... Individually, each one is a great player, but the team thing takes time... One must accept that, as a team, the Australians were clearly better (in Melbourne). 

Lara, of course, has scored thousands in both forms. At the same time, he has featured in a long list of controversies ? in fact, somebody like Ridley Jacobs went for his jugular not very many moons ago and even Sir Vivian Richards has had uncharitable things to say. 

Look, Ive always given that hundred per cent (for the West Indies)... Have always given my best, the record-rewriting Lara defended himself. 

Asked whether the forthcoming face-off would be his last Test in Sydney, he replied: I dont know... I dont draw up itineraries... But, yes, the SCG has always been special and Ive named my daughter after this city... 

The 277, well over a decade ago, remains Laras solitary Test hundred at the SCG. Overall, he has 30. 

The West Indies will be in Australia later this season, but wont play a Test in Sydney. 

Meanwhile, in a chat with The Telegraph, Virender Sehwag accepted there was a difference in the level of passion, but said: Its an honour that I got picked for both World XIs... Kya pata phir mauka milega ki nahin? Obviously, the atmosphere in the Indian dressing room is different ? so is the passion. 

Earlier, interacting with the Media, Sehwag spoke of the pressures faced by present-day cricketers and vowed to score big in the Super Test: Im here for runs... I want to put behind the disappointment of not doing well in the ODIs. 

Sehwag scored 6, 21 and 37. But, then, he has gone on record saying hes better in Test cricket.

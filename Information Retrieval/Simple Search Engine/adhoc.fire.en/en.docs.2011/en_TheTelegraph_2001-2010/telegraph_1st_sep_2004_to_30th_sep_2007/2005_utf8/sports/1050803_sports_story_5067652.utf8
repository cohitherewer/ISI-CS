 Rio de Janeiro: Ronaldo was recalled to the Brazilian national team after missing the Confederations Cup, returning for the side?s friendly later this month against Croatia. National team manager Carlos Alberto Parreira on Monday included Ronaldo, who asked to be excused from the June tournament in Germany due to fatigue, as part of the 22-man roster for the August 17 match in Split.

 Parreira also included Santos striker Robinho, who recently resolved his month-long dispute with his Brazilian club and agreed to a transfer to Real Madrid later this month. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid?s Brazilian fullback Roberto Carlos was granted Spanish citizenship on Tuesday, freeing up one of the club?s three non-European Union places for new signing Robinho.

 ?After so many years in Spain I feel proud to have gained dual nationality,? said the 32-year-old international after swearing an oath to the Spanish constitution in Madrid. ?It is a very important thing for me.?

 According to Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) rules, each Primera Liga club is permitted a maximum of three non-European Union players on their books. Last season Real?s three berths were occupied by Roberto Carlos, fellow-Brazilian Ronaldo and Argentine centre-back Walter Samuel.

 London: Six-time world champion Valentino Rossi will ride for Yamaha in MotoGP next season after extending his contract until the end of 2006.

 The announcement ends speculation that the 26-year-old Italian, who is well on course for a fifth straight MotoGP world title, might make a switch to Formula One or rallying next year.

 ?I am so happy to be able to announce the continuation of my relationship with Yamaha,? Rossi said.?Last year was magic, to win my first race with Yamaha, and then to win the championship.

 New Delhi: Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua and veteran Pravin Thipsay have pulled out from the 43rd National B chess tournament beginning here on Wednesday.

 Former champion R. B. Ramesh remains the only Grandmaster to feature in the elite event from where 14 players will qualify for the national A championship.

 IMs Satyapragyan, who missed a GM norm just by a whisker last week, and Rahul Shetty are also doubtful, organisers said on the eve of the tournament, which is being held in the city after a gap of 20 years.

 Washington: Andy Roddick is working his hardest to catch Roger Federer, but the American star admits that finding the form to dethrone the Swiss world No. 1 at the US Open next month is still beyond him.

 ?Roger Federer has a physical and mental advantage over everybody,? Roddick said. ?He?s doing to tennis what Tiger Woods did to golf a few years ago. He is making us all improve.? 

 Nairobi: Kenya?s President Mwai Kibaki has urged his country?s athletes not to defect to Gulf states in search of money and better training facilities. His appeal at a meeting on Tuesday with the Kenyan team for the World Championships comes after some 40 Kenyans changed their nationalities to run for Qatar or Bahrain.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 New-look attack faces acid test

 - Squad short on experience: Wadekar 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: Rahul Dravid faces a tough task. 

In keeping with Greg Chappells policy of looking ahead to the 2007 World Cup and picking players with the right attitude, the national selectors on Friday shunned experience while picking a fairly new-look pace attack for the first two of the seven-match ODI series versus Sri Lanka. The first match is in Nagpur on October 25. 

Ajit Agarkar and Irfan Pathan are the only two experienced new-ball operators. Allrounder Jai Prakash Yadav, Rudra Pratap Singh and rookie S. Sreesanth are the other pacers in the 15-member squad. 

Zaheer Khan has been dropped again after being ignored for the tri-series in Zimbabwe. Anil Kumble doesnt feature in Chappells scheme of things either, and so, Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik continue to be the two spinners. 

Both Agarkar and Kartiks inclusion has much to do with the super sub rule. 

The selectors acted on a Board directive by picking the squad for only the first two matches. They have thus kept the door open for Sourav Gangulys return. The former captain has to now prove his fitness and form in the Duleep Trophy game against North Zone in Rajkot from October 20. 

The only representative from East Zone is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

It is clear that Kiran More and his colleagues ? Yashpal Sharma, Pranab Roy, Gopal Sharma and V.B. Chandrasekhar ? have handed Chappell the squad of his choice. Sreesanth had impressed the coach during his stint at the bowlers camp before the tri-series in Sri Lanka. Sreesanth himself was surprised at his inclusion. 

On the other hand, V.V.S. Laxmans century in the Challenger Trophy did little to impress Chappell. 

With Ashish Nehra (and Mohammed Kaif) out with injuries, it will be left to these youngsters to prove their mettle in the highly tense environment of a home series. 

Sachin Tendulkars return will give Chappell more options in the batting line-up. It is learnt the coach is keen on trying him out in the middle-order. He has already gone on record saying he wants the Master Blaster to act as a mentor. 

Gautam Gambhir is back in the one-day squad after a two-and-a-half year hiatus and it is likely that he will open with Virender Sehwag. The coach may also try out Dhoni with Sehwag at the top. 

The likes of Y. Venugopal Rao and Suresh Raina are yet to prove their credentials. 

The squad is definitely short on experience? There are too many youngsters in the side and they will have a tough time, former captain and coach Ajit Wadekar told The Telegraph. 

If you are looking to build a solid team for the World Cup, youve got to rely on experience, he added. 

Wadekar feels Rao is short on temperament and Laxman should have been there to lend proper balance to the team. If the Lankans recent form against India is anything to go by, the Maravan Atapattus and Sanath Jayasuriyas will be waiting impatiently to pounce on the Indian attack.

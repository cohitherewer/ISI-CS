The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lin moves into semis 

Birmingham: World No. 1 Lin Dan had to fight a long and unusual battle to maintain his bid to become the first man in nine years to defend the All-England men?s singles title. 

The Chinese needed 93 minutes to achieve a 15-10, 13-15, 15-8 quarter final victory over Korea?s Lee Hyun-il in a contest of two left-handers which sometimes looked as though Lin were struggling with a mirror image of himself. 

He was certainly tussling with a dangerously revived opponent, unseeded this week but the world No. 2 only 16 months ago and twice a victor in their previous four meetings. 

Although Lin made a great start, grabbing the first five points quickly, easing in and out of attack and defence with great versatility, and holding on to his lead throughout the first game, Lee began to make better progress in the second. 

He could never quite match the easy fluency of Lin?s movement, but he did begin to find ways of forcing his attacks through more often, and of applying more pressure to the favourite. 

Lee also came back strongly from within two points of defeat at 10-13 down, unleashing a hard-to-read round-the-head smash to reach 14-13 and then converting a game point at the second attempt with a brilliant flicked block. (AFP)

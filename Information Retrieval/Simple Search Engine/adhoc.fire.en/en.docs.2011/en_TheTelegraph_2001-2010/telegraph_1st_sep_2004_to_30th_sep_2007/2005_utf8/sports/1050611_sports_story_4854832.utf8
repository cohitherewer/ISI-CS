 Form points to Aperitivo 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: The well-tuned Aperitivo from trainer Vijay Singhs yard, with C. Alford in the saddle, looks good to lift the 1,400m Civil Service Cup here on Saturday.

 The Diffident-Dramatic Irony gelding may, however, come up against some opposition from Attorney, Just Brave and Saratoga Sizzle who look best in the field of nine to make it tough for him. But going by his second in the Chennai Turf Invitation Cup, and also his third in the Indian St. Leger, Aperitivo may deliver the goods.

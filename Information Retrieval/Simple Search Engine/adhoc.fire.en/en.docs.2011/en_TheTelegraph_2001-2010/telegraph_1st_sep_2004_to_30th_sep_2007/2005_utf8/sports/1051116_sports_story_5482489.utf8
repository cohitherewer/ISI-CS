 Win No. 2 for Paes, Zimonjic

 Leander Paes 

Shanghai: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic won another hard-fought match at the season-ending Masters Cup Doubles Championship to virtually assure themselves of a semi-final berth. 

The fifth-seeded Indo-Serbian pair saw off Australian duo Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6) on Tuesday to maintain their all-win record in the Red group of round-robin play. On Sunday, Paes and Zimonjic had shocked No. 3 seeds Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor. 

In Tuesdays other match, top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan beat Knowles and Nestor 6-4, 6-4. Knowles and Nestor are, thus, out of reckoning after losing two matches. The Bryan brothers have a chance provided they beat Paes and Zimonjic on Thursday. 

In Masters Cup singles action, Roger Federer survived a scare against Ivan Ljubicic before prevailing 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 and closing in on a last-four berth. The world No.1 bounced back from a poor second set to make it two wins out of two. 

Meanwhile, Swede Thomas Johansson has been called up to the injury-hit meet as a last-minute reserve after a shock double withrawal left the tournament without emergency back-up. 

The world No. 14 will fly in early on Thursday after both reserve players were called into action by injuries to Rafael Nadal and Andre Agassi. 

Mariano Puerta took the court just three hours after being told of Nadals withdrawal, while Agassi has been replaced by Chilean Fernando Gonzalez. (Agencies)

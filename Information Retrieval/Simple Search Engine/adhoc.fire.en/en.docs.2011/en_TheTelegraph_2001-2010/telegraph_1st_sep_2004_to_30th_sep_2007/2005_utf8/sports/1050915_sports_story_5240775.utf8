 Flintoff future captain, says Benaud

London: Andrew Flintoff, who was instrumental in England winning the Ashes after a gap of nearly two decades, has been hailed as a possible captain by Aussie legend Richie Benaud. 

He (Flintoff) lifted himself on several occasions during the series. I think Andrew Flintoff is a future captain, at least of the one-day side, Benaud said. It depends how Michael Vaughan goes in the one-dayers but certainly 

I would be looking at him as vice-captain in the next team to go away to give him a bit of experience, he is a thinker, Benuad said on a radio programme. (PTI)

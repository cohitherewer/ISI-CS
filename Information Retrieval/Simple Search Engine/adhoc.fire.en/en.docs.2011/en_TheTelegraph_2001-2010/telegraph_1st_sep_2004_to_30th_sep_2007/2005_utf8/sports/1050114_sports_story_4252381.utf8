 Anju plans to hire full-time physio

Mumbai: Ace long jumper Anju Bobby George plans to take part in 10-12 international events from May onwards and have a full-time physiotherapist while she follows a gruelling schedule, her coach and husband Bobby said here Thursday. 

Anju will start training in Bangalore initially and then move on to Europe, most likely to London for the coming season, Bobby George told a press conference. 

?She is likely to take part in two events in US before moving on to Europe for the Grands Prix there and the Helsinki world championship. The Asian championship scheduled at the end of the year in Busan, South Korea, is also in our sights.? 

Anju is here as brand ambassador for this Sunday?s Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon. 

Asked whether they intend to engage a foreign coach, George said what she needs now is a full-time physio to sort out the niggling injuries. 

Anju said her intention was to clear seven metres on a regular basis. Asked how many years she can continue as a top-level long jumper, George said for four more years. She will turn 28 then. (PTI)

New Delhi: Mohinder Amarnaths nearly two-hour presentation on Thursday, which was high on passion and sentiment, has improved his prospects for the Team India coachs job. 

Till the other night, he was simply seen as one shortlisted by the BCCIs six-member selection committee to keep the swadeshi lobby happy. 

Mohinder was confident during his interview and presentation ? even making Greg Chappell wait for almost an hour-and-half ? and may script an upset if one of the three former captains on the committee manages more support for him. 

Desmond Haynes isnt anywhere in the frame, but Mohinder is there... He was almost written off, but treating him now as a poor also-ran will be foolish, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

John Wrights successor was to have been known by late evening, but the committee (Ranbir Singh Mahendra, Jagmohan Dalmiya, S. K. Nair, Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri) deferred its decision till Friday. 

An announcement is expected around 12.30 pm, after the committees own meeting, scheduled for 10.00 am. 

Things spun out of control as Mohinder far exceeded the 45 minutes budgeted for each contender. Also, the Mahendra-Dalmiya duo went to meet the Prime Minister in connection with the tax exemption for the 2006 Champions Trophy. 

The nearly two-hour adjournment meant Tom Moody could only be called for his interview and presentation over five hours after the process began at the Taj Palace. 

Chappell and Moody began the day as frontrunners, but while the former is still the favourite ? albeit by a wafer-thin margin ? its to be seen whether Moody has actually lost ground to Mohinder. 

Apparently, Chappell (inarguably the tallest contender, stature-wise) made the most professional presentation. As for Moody, at 39 the youngest contender, his was probably the most technical? 

Chappell kept it simple as he believes cricket doesnt have to get complicated, the well-placed source pointed out. 

Unlike the others, who used CDs and took the help of a projection screen, Haynes relied on pen-and-paper. Its no surprise, then, his presentation was the shortest. He must return to Barbados ? where hes chairman of the national sports council ? empty-handed. 

Incidentally, the Sri Lankans are chasing Chappell and Moody in earnest. Both, one understands, received calls from Colombo during the day with the caller suggesting they board an early mor- ning flight for the Lankan capital. 

Chappell and Moody, however, are going to wait for the BCCIs decision.

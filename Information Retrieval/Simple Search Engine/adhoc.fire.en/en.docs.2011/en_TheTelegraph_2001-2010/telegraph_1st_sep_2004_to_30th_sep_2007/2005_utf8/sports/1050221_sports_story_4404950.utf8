 JCT trounce Churchill 3-0

 Omagbemi scored a brace for Sporting 

Ludhiana: JCT Mills, Phagwara recorded a comfortable 3-0 win over Goa?s Churchill Brothers in the National Football League tie for the ONGC Cup at Guru Nanak Stadium on Sunday. 

All the goals were scored in the first half. The victory helped JCT Mills improve their tally to 11 from nine matches while the visitors, after eight outings, remained 11th in the table with just five points. 

Churchill Brothers began on a rousing note, exhibiting an attacking game and forced the home team on the defensive. They looked comfortably in charge early on. 

The Goans went on the offensive time and again during the initial stages of the game, but failed to get the desired results. Marcos Pereira missed a couple of scoring chances. 

Similarly, JCT too made some forays into the rival citadel midway through the first half but could not break the defence. 

It was in the 37th minute that JCT took the lead. Defender Harpreet Singh took possession of the ball inside the box and rolled it neatly into the net to open his side?s account. Four minutes on, Julius Arabor Akpele headed home a throw-in from Daljit Singh to make it 2-0. 

With 10 seconds to go for the breather, midfielder Sukhwinder Singh scored off a rebound to complete the tally. 

Churchill next meet Fransa Sports Club on Friday, while JCT take on Tollygunge Agragami on Wednesday. 

In Margao, Sporting Clube de Goa rallied from a goal down to beat 10-man State Bank of Tranvancore (SBT) 3-1 at Nehru Stadium on Sunday. 

SBT drew first blood in the 57th minute through Lanel Thomas but after Adewusi Adebayo equalised in the 61st minute, Dudu Omagbemi struck a brace in the 64th and 82nd minutes to give Sporting full points. 

SBT got a jolt soon after Lanel?s goal when defender V. Sivakumar was given marching orders by referee N. Mohan for his second booking. 

The win took Sporting to 10 points from five matches, the same as Tollygunge Agragami, but are placed above them at sixth on account of better goal difference. 

SBT, who have played nine matches, remained on nine points.

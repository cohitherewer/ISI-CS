 Challenger from Oct. 10 

Mohali: The NKP Salve Challenger Trophy one-day series will be played between India, India A and India B teams at PCA Cricket Stadium here from October 10 to 13. 

The full Indian team is expected to take on India A and India B teams on league basis and the two top teams will play the final on October 13. 

A PCA official said the series will serve as the base for the selection of the Indian team for the ODI series against Sri Lanka, starting from October 25. 

The rate of tickets for the day-night matches is being kept quite low as compared to the normal one-day matches to attract more crowds, he said. 

The Challenger Trophy is a great opportunity for promising and talented youngsters of the country. 

The stars have also been turning out regularly for the different sides adding to the intense competition.

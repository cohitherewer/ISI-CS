 Setback for Phelps 

Montreal: Michael Phelps bid to win a record eight gold medals at the world championships ended at the first hurdle when he failed to qualify for Sundays 400 m freestyle final. 

The American faded badly to finish seventh in his morning heat and 18th overall, missing a place in the final by 10 spots. 

Phelps stopped the clock at three minutes 50.53 seconds, nearly six seconds behind Australias Grant Hackett who topped the qualifiers with a time of 3:50.53. 

Thats not the way I wanted to start off. It was pretty disappointing, Phelps told reporters. I was surprised, I was good in the warm-up, but in the race it just wasnt there. 

Phelps had never swum 400m freestyle at world or Olympic level before. (Reuters)

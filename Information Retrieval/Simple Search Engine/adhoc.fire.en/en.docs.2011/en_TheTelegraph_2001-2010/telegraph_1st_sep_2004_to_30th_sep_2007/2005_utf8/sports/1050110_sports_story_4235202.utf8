 Moya: It was kind of a miracle

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Before Sunday, the experienced Carlos Moya had 17 ATP titles to his name. But not once had he converted a 2-5 final set deficit into victory. 

?Once, in Umag (2003), I won after my opponent was serving for the title at 5-4. But never did I win from being two breaks down in the final set? I was lucky today, it was kind of a miracle,? Moya said at the post-match conference. 

?It was a strange match really? He was in control from the beginning and I had no chance in the early stages. Then I broke him in the second set and started playing better.? 

Though the odds were stacked heavily in Srichaphan?s favour, Moya knew he had a chance to fight back as his opponent was ?tiring a bit. I hang on and played my best tennis of the week at 2-5 in the final set.? 

Delighted to be the first player to retain the Chennai crown, Moya said this victory would give him a lot of confidence going into the Australian Open. ?I hope to come back and make it three in a row here next year,? said Moya, who donated his entire prize-money of $52,000 to the Unicef tsunami relief fund. 

Paying a tribute to the Chennai crowd, Moya said: ?I knew Paradorn is a favourite here, but the crowds supported me also and helped me recover. It?s great playing in front of such an appreciative audience.? 

Srichaphan tried hard to hide his disappointment. ?I had many chances but couldn?t take them. But I?ll take the positives. It was a great match and a great tournament for me,? said the Thai, who has now lost all three encounters versus Moya, and three of his four finals in Chennai.

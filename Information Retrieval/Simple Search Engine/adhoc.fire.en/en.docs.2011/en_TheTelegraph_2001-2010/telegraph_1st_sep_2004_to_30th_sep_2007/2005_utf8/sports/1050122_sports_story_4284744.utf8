The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sporting down JCT

 - National League

 - Tolly aim for a draw against Salgaocar 

 Suley Musah has been in fine form for Tollygunge Agragami 

Margao: A goal in each half from foreigners Adewusi Adebayo and Edeh Chidi guided Sporting Clube de Goa to their first victory in the ninth National Football League match here on Friday. 

They defeated JCT 2-0. 

The Goans led 1-0 at the break after Adebayo found the net with a rasping drive from 40 yards. 

After the change of ends, Sporting, who held the upperhand, created three more chances and finally Edeh completed the tally in the 77th minute. 

It was Man-of-the-Match Joseph, who initiated the move from the left flank and relayed the ball to Dudu Omagbemi. 

He found Edeh, who went past two defenders and beat JCT goalkeeper Mansuru Allends with an angular drive. 

Sporting could have won by a bigger margin but Allends came up with some superb saves to deny Wilton Gomes and substitute Alvito. 

JCT shone only in patches and had only one clear chance in the entire match. But Sukhwinder Singh?s attempt went straight to Sporting custodian Luis Bareto. 

Meanwhile, Tollygunge Agragami will be looking to keep the momentum going for them when they lock horns against former champions Salgaocar in the National Football League in Margao on Saturday. 

The Calcutta outfit, who have got off to a good start in the League, have so far collected four points, thanks to a win and a draw. 

The Ghanaian Suley Musah so far has been instrumental in Tollygunge?s performance in the competition. 

On the other hand, Salgaocar began their campaign with a shock defeat against State Babk of Travancore but bounced right back, beating JCT, Phagwara, in their very second match. 

Salgaocar?s midfield put up a good performance in both the matches, but it is their defence and forward line that have to be tightened up. 

Jyothi Kumar, Felix and Francis Andrade have combined well to open the rivals? defence but lack of finishing has so far proved to be their undoing. 

Tollygunge, who play a defensive game, are clearly looking for a draw. 

?Our aim was to collect three points from our three matches of the Goa leg before we moved back home to play against Dempo. 

?But now that we have collected four points from two matches, a draw will be a bonus against Salgaocar,? Tollygunge coach Biswajit Das said on the match-eve. 

?They have a good reputation and are a tough team to beat at home,? he added.

 Fit Federer ready to defend title 

London: World No. 1 Roger Federer said on Thursday that he was fit to defend his season-ending ATP Masters Cup title after recovering from an ankle injury. 

The Swiss will be the favourite for the final event of the mens season at Shanghais Qi Zhong Stadium from November 13-20. 

A few weeks ago I was not sure how quickly my ankle would recover, but now I am on the court and playing again, Federer said. 

I will go to Shanghai with a fresh mind and really look forward to defending the title. 

The two-time champion, who defeated Lleyton Hewitt in the 2004 final and Andre Agassi in the 2003 final, will be making his fourth consecutive appearance in the ATP finale. 

Last year in Houston, Federer was undefeated and improved his record at the event to 13-1. 

Federer clinched the year-end world number one ranking in Bangkok earlier this month and carries a 77-3 match record in 2005. 

Despite missing the final three weeks of the regular season, he still won 11 titles (tied with Rafael Nadal). 

Federer also became the first man since 1938 to win both the Wimbledon and US Open titles in consecutive years, and extended his unbeaten record in finals to 24 matches ? a streak dating back to October 2003. 

Federer will be joined in Shanghai by Spaniard Nadal, Andy Roddick, former champion Hewitt, Agassi and Guillermo Coria. 

Corias qualification was confirmed on Thursday after Australian Open champion Marat Safin announced his withdrawal due to a knee injury. 

Safins season has been hampered by a ligament tear in his left knee, forcing him to miss nearly four months of the ATP season. Since Wimbledon he has played only one tournament. 

Unfortunately I will not be able to play in the Masters Cup because of my knee injury, said Safin. 

I am very disappointed because the Masters Cup is the culmination of the tennis season. I was looking forward to playing in Shanghai, I have had good results in China and I like playing there. 

The remaining spots in the elite eight-men field will be determined this week at the Paris Masters.

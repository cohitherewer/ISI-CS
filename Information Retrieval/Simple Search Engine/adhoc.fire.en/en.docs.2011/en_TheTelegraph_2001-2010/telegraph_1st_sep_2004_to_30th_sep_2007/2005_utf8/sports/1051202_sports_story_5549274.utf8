 Harikrishna defeats Brazil GM

Khanty Mansiysk (Russia): Grandmaster P. Harikrishna scored a thumping victory over GM Giovanni Vescovi of Brazil in the second game of the second round of the World Chess Cup now in progress here. 

 The victory was an absolute necessity for the wily Indian as he had lost the first game of the two-game mini match under normal time control against Vescovi on Wednesday. The two will now battle it out in the tiebreak games on Friday. 

Playing white, the Indian sprang an early surprise by opting for one of the sharpest variations in the Ruy Lopez opening. 

Vescovi failed to gauge the deep preparation of Harikrishna in the middle game and his king side was routed by the Hyderabad based who started the wild complexities with a bishop sacrifice on the 27th move. Vescovi resigned on his 31st turn. 

Also moving to the tiebreak stage in the second round was national champion GM Surya Shekhar Ganguly who had an easy draw with Levan Pantsulaia of Georgia. 

Having drawn the first game of the match too, Ganguly was happy with the draw and now his skills will be tested in the tiebreaker. 

Gangulys game ended soon after it began as Pantsulaia was keen on moving to the shorter time control games.

 Asia can host if Australia forfeit, says Mani

Rawalpindi: International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday said that Asia would get to host every third World Cup and that the subcontinent would be awarded the 2011 edition if Australia forfeit their turn to host the mega event that year. 

The ICC has decided that every third World Cup will be held in Asia because it has four out of 10 members. But according to the rotation policy, it is Australias turn, and whether Asia will host the 2011 event or 2015 event, would only be decided after Cricket Australia (CA) let us know about their decision, ICC president Ehsan Mani said during the fifth ODI between Pakistan and England. 

CA chief executive James Sutherland last week said his board had not decided about hosting the World Cup while the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have indicated their willingness to organise the mega event. Of the eight World Cups, Asia has hosted two ? in 1987 when Australia won ? and in 1996 when Sri Lanka won. Mani further said if Australia declined, Asia would be offered the hosting rights of the World Cup. 

I would like to see all the four Asian Test playing countries jointly host the World Cup like that did in 1996. But again, its premature to say and it will depend entirely on the boards how they want to go about it. (PTI)

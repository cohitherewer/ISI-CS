 Sehwag not worried over form

 - I had intentionally gone for shots early in the innings, says opener 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Virender Sehwag is confident he will soon be back among runs. The Indian vice-captain had been unable to build on the starts during the recent one-day series versus Sri Lanka and South Africa and it was no different on Monday. 

He was dismissed by Chaminda Vaas for 36. The innings included seven boundaries and came off 28 balls. Im not worried about my form. I think I am in good nick and it is just a matter of one innings which I am confident will come in the remaining two matches of this series, Sehwag, who has an average of 55.32 in 37 Tests before this series, said. 

He feels that the wicket is slow and there is nothing for the bowlers. There is no turn for the spinners. You can play long innings on this wicket. The only thing needed is patience. You have to stick around and the runs will automatically flow. 

A view shared by Mahela Jayawardene. Patience is the key on this wicket. You have to grind? The ball isnt coming onto the bat. The wicket is slow because of the rains. We encountered similar sort of conditions during the three-day match in Bangalore. 

Sehwag, however, does not agree that he was a victim of the one-day syndrome on Monday. 

I had intentionally gone for my shots early in the innings. The ball was new and hitting was easy. What happens in these conditions is that after 8/10 overs as the ball gets old, it starts reverse swinging. It becomes hard to score. My aim was to make maximum use of the new ball, he explained. 

He admitted it was tough sitting for three days and then motivating one to play well. But we are professionals and have to adjust to any situation. Once the match started there was no problem. Now everyone is in the Test mood. 

Jayawardene said the Lankans are ready for Tuesdays challenge. 

The bowlers had learnt a lot from the match in Bangalore. So bowling in these conditions wont be tough. 

He was all praise for Chaminda Vaas. He knows the conditions in the subcontinent inside out. He was amply rewarded for his efforts today.

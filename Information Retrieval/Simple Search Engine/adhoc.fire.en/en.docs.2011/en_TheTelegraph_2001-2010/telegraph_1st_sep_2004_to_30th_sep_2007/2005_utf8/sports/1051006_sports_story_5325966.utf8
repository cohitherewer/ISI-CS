 BSF blank Md. Sp. to reach semis

Gangtok: Gurjit Singh Atwal struck home twice to help BSF Jalandhar blank Mohammedan Sporting 3-0 and set up a semi-final showdown with Arambagh, Bangladesh, in the Governors Gold Cup football tournament at the Palzor Stadium here on Wednesday. 

After a failed attempt by Sarabjit Singh only seven minutes into the game, Atwal scored the first goal in the 23rd minute, shooting home a Santosh Kujur pass from the right flank, past Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Gopal Das. 

The second goal came in the 72nd minute. Harvinder Singh hit the target from inside the box after Sarabjits corner kick was headed away by Mohammedan Sportings Sule Musa. 

Three minutes later, Kujur tried to hit in from close, but Das thwarted the attempt. However, Atwal was alert enough to find the target and clinch the match in favour of the BSF men. 

In Thursdays first semi-final, Nepal XI will take on Tata Football Academy.

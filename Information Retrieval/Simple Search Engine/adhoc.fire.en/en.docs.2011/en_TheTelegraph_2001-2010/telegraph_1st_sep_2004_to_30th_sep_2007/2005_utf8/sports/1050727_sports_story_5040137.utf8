 Leicester: Inter Milan launched their pre-season tour of England with a 2-1 win over second division Leicester City on Monday.

 Leicester were sunk by goals from Santiago Solari and Lampros Choutos. Substitute Chris O?Grady replied with a penalty for the home team. Roberto Mancini?s side will continue their four-match tour with a game against second division Crystal Palace on Wednesday.

 Coach Mancini said his players were not unduly worried about playing in London. ?From Milan to Rome to London, the fear is the same,? he said. ?There?s not a huge fear because of playing in London, any more than playing in other places.? 

 Cotonou: Edme Codjo has been named as the new coach of Benin, making him the fifth man to hold the position since African group phase qualifiers began for the 2006 World Cup a little over a year ago.

 The appointment was announced by the Benin Football Federation ahead of the west African country?s next World Cup qualifier at home to Sudan on August 17. 

 Paris: Alexander Vinokourov will join the Liberty Seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the Tour de France, the Kazakh rider said on Tuesday.

 Vinokourov said he could no longer ride in the shadow of 1997 Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich anymore and last week said he would be leaving the German?s T-Mobile team.

 ?My goal is clear, I want to win the Tour de France,? said Vinokourov.?So I chose the team with the best arguments. It?s the most organised and the most experienced team.

 Wellington: The New Zealand Open will be put back from January to November next year to better align itself with tour dates in Australia.

 The decision to move the tournament was brought forward following the demise of Australia?s Heineken Classic. 

 Moscow: Russia?s Black Sea resort of Sochi will bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the countrys Olympic chiefs said. Ater Moscow failed to win the right to stage the 2012 Summer Games, the executive board of the Russian Olympic Committee voted unanimously to submit Sochis bid to the IOC.

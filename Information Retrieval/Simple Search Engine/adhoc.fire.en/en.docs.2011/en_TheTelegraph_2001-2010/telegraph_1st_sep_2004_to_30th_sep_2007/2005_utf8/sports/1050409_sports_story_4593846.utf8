The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kunte goes down to Zhang 

Dubai: Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte suffered a defeat at the hands of Zhang Zhong of China but it turned out to be a satisfying day of other Indians in the fourth round of the Dubai open chess championship. 

Amongst the norm hopefuls, double WGM norm holder Eesha Karavade was the biggest gainer as she put it across Alexander Areshchenko of Ukraine to collect three points from a possible four. 

Also coming out good was G. Balaji, who proved a tough customer for compatriot IM S. Kidambi, and youngsters Parimarjan Negi and Abhijeet Gupta, who held Wang Yue of China and Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine to draws. 

Meanwhile, Georgi Kacheishvili emerged sole leader after four rounds following his easy triumph over compatriot Merab Gagunashvili. 

He is now followed by top seed Alexander Motylev of Russia, Aleksej Aleksandrov of Belarus and Zhong who all have 3.5 points apiece while a pack of 33 hopefuls, including Indian GMs Sandipan Chanda and Koneru Humpy, are breathing down their necks with three points apiece.

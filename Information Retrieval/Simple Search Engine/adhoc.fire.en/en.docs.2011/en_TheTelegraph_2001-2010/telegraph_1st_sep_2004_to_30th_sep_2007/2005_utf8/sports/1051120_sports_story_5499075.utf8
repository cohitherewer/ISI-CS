 Ian Botham to improvise for birthday bash

Martin Johnson in Faisalabad

 Botham will celebrate turning 50 in Faisalabad 

Englands cricketers may have arrived in Faisalabad slightly chastened by the last-day events in the opening Test match, but given that there is more than one way of getting beaten in Pakistan, they can count themselves fortunate that the scars were only mental. If they needed any further reminder of the different culture out here, there was an article in the morning paper declaring that the Lahore Airport Security Police had thrashed 20 passengers in a baton charge when they complained about the late departure of their flight to Karachi. 

Whether anyone would ever complain about not getting to Faisalabad on time is highly unlikely, but you could certainly imagine a riot if you ever got delayed trying to get out of here. 

Faisalabad may not be the only city in Pakistan that would make you think twice about a holiday timeshare cottage, but with its textile factories, smoking brick kilns, extra size and extra pollution, it makes Multan look like Leamington Spa. 

The atmosphere here, of course, has never been more noxious than it was in 1987, when a 30-second conversation between Mike Gatting and umpire Shakoor Rana could have been precised down to about 10 words once the expletives had been deleted. There has only been one more notorious incident in the entire history of Test cricket, and that was Bodyline. 

Without excusing the conduct of the England captain, what has slightly got lost in the wash is that Rana was not only incompetent and bumptious, but insufferably vain, and didnt so much spot an England fielder being illegally moved (which he wasnt being) as a potential headline. 

The bad blood caused by home-town umpires (Tom Graveney called them cheats at the time of the Gatting affair, and even the mild mannered Bob Taylor got hauled up for dissent on the 1983-84 tour) eventually disappeared with the move to neutral arbiters, although there was reportedly a mild spat between Geoffrey Boycott and the TV umpire in Multan (a Pakistani) when the teams flew out on Wednesday. 

The umpire apparently didnt care for Boycotts comments on radio that Salman Butt should have been given run out on video evidence, and in fairness he had a point. Butt was, in all probability, out, but the camera angle was such that while the crucial frame showed the bottom half of the stumps being broken, you couldnt actually see the bails being dislodged. 

Technology can get as much wrong as it does right, as we saw in the first ever third umpire decision, in a Benson and Hedges Cup match between Surrey and Lancashire at The Oval in the 1990s. Wasim Akram was run out by about two feet, but as the then Test and County Cricket Board had instructed the officials to test out the new innovation at the earliest opportunity, they referred it upstairs. The replay showed a perfect view of the square leg umpires crouched posterior, and Akram had to be given not out. 

Talking of TV, Ian Botham is out here commentating for Sky, and by some delicious irony he is due to celebrate ? if thats the word for it ? his 50th birthday here in Faisalabad next Thursday. It is not thought to have been Bothams first choice venue, as Pakistan was the country he once voted for as the ideal place for sending the mother-in-law on an all expenses paid holiday. 

It was a tongue in cheek remark, Botham said, and it was sadly no surprise when the ECB (then TCCB) decided to get all po-faced about it. If Morecambe and Wise had said it (you can tell hes nearly 50) everyone would have fallen about laughing. 

Botham has been on the wagon since the start of the tour, but he does have connections, and is not thought to be planning to raise the bat to his half-century with a freshly squeezed lime soda. 

If Botham was disappointed with Englands last-day performance in Multan, he stopped short of suggesting they be made to stay here on an all-expenses paid holiday. It would be a suitable punishment if they bat the same way again in this Test, although there does appear to have been a mitigating circumstance.

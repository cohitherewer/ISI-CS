Madrid: Ronaldo struck twice to help Real Madrid to their second Primera Liga victory in four days with a 3-0 win against the leagues bottom club Alaves on Sunday. 

The Brazilian striker broke the deadlock with a fierce strike in the 58th minute after Alaves had matched Real in a tense first half. 

Ronaldo sealed the win with a solo effort seven minutes from time and midfielder Guti added a third in injury time. The result helped Real put their shaky early start to the season behind them and lifted them to third in the standings with nine points, along with Valencia, Deportivo Coruna and Osasuna. 

Promoted Celta Vigo continued their impressive start to the campaign with a 2-1 win over Sevilla that put them top with 12 points. 

Brazilian striker Fernando Baiano scored with a flicked backheel after only a minute, and midfielder Borja Oubina doubled the lead soon after with a jinking run and shot. 

Celtas Jose Manuel Pinto saved a Luis Fabiano penalty before the break but could do nothing about Vincenzo Marescas second-half effort from the penalty spot. 

Another promoted side Getafe went second with 11 points after they secured a 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid on Saturday. 

Champions Barcelona romped to a 4-1 win over 10-man Real Betis to climb to seventh on eight points. 

Meanwhile in Italy, AC Milan captain Paolo Maldini celebrated his record 571st appearance in Italys top flight by helping his side to a 2-0 win over bottom side Treviso on Sunday. Milans victory moved them into a share of third place, level with Palermo and Lazio on 10 points from five matches, five behind leaders Juventus who won 2-1 at Parma on Saturday. 

Palermo wasted a two-goal lead to lose 4-2 against Lazio at Romes Olympic Stadium, allowing Livorno to move second after their unbeaten start continued with a 2-0 win over Ascoli. Inter Milan rode Obafemi Martinss early goal to beat Fiorentina in another match. (REUTERS)

 Korea trounce India 7-0

New Delhi: India crashed to a 0-7 defeat against hosts Korea in the AFC under-17 women?s football meet on Monday. 

This was India?s second consecutive defeat in group A, after losing 4-6 to Thailand on Saturday, which effectively puts them out of contention for a semi-final berth. 

Though the Indians held their much superior opponents goalless in the first 25 minutes at the Sports Park, the flood gates opened after Korea went ahead through Hah Nul Kwon in the 28th minute. India conceded two more to trail 0-3 at the break. 

Changing ends, the Koreans continued their supremacy and pumped in four more, according to information received here Monday. 

Earlier, India went down to Thailand in an exciting match after leading 4-3 at one stage in the second half.

 Svidler forces Anand to share honours

 - WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP - Topalov reinforces lead with another win 

 Topalov has the crown in his sight 

San Luis (Argentina): Viswanathan Anands attempts to force a victory were thwarted by Russian Grandmaster Peter Svidler who survived a few scares before taking a draw in a hard fought sixth round game of the World Chess Championship on Wednesday. 

Veselin Topalovs rampaging form continued as he outplayed worlds top woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary to stretch his lead to a whopping 2 points. 

With his fourth straight and fifth victory overall in just six games, Topalov, currently ranked joint second in the world along with Anand, took another stride towards his maiden world title, taking his tally to an impressive 5.5 points. 

Anand, for whom it was the third draw in six games, inched up to 3.5 points and remained in joint second spot along with Svidler. 

Defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan remained in the fourth spot on 3 points followed by Hungarian Peter Leko. The sixth spot is shared by the remaining three contestants ?? Polgar, Russian Alexander Morozevich and Britains Michael Adams, all having 2 points apiece. 

On another uneventful day, barring Topalovs victory, Anand could not do as much he might have liked against Svidler who played the Marshall Gambit, that has been a posing some problems to white in the past few years. 

Anand accepted the Gambit Pawn in the opening and uncorked a theoretical novelty that involved an exchange sacrifice to liven up things in the queen less middle game. 

However, Svidler was alert after the debacle against Topalov in the previous round and played just about the right defensive manoeuvres to steer the game to a draw in 39 moves. 

After showing tremendous insight in tactical finesses of the game in the previous rounds, Topalov showcased his endgame skills against Polgar. 

Playing the black side of a Berlin Defence, the Bulgarian got an easy equality in the middle game and had little troubles in securing the advantage once Polgar went overboard. 

Winning a pawn at the end of a forced series of manoeuvres, Topalov liquidated to a rook and pawns endgame in quick time and romped home after 64 moves. 

Peter Lekos faith in the sharp Sicilian Sveshnikov again came good as Kasimdzhanov failed to make an impact with his white pieces. 

 Earlier, the Uzbek had gone for 

 a rather safe variation in the opening that paved the way 

 for Leko to get easy play on both flanks. Routine exchanges 

 led to a balanced position with pawns left only on the king 

 side and the players signed peace after 43 moves. (PTI)

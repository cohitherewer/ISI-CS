The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Arindam, Nadeem in contention

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal middle-order batsman Arindam Ghosh and Jharkhand left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem may be included in the 15-member (U-19) squad to play against the Australians, who will visit India from September 19 to 28 to play five one-day matches. 

According to The Telegraphs selection committee sources, Ambati Rayudu and Manoj Tewari ? who led the team against England in the Tests and one-dayers, respectively ? cant be considered owing to the age criterion, when selectors meet here on Monday. 

It was learnt that the selection committee, headed by Praveen Amre, would depend heavily on coach Venkatesh Prasad for choosing the captain. We will have ask for his views before selecting someone, a source added. 

The names doing the rounds are Piyush Chawla, Ravi Kant Shukla and Rohit Sharma. 

Coachs views will also be given utmost importance in the selection of the team as well, as he has been working with the same set of boys for quite a long time, the source said. But Prasad, asked about his choice, didnt comment. 

The selected players will be given ample time to settle as they have two big tests ? Asia Cup and World Cup ? immediately. The under-19 team also has a tough schedule ahead next season.

 Madrid: Spanish rider Santiago Perez was banned for two years by the Spanish cycling federation on Tuesday after testing positive for a blood transfusion in last September?s Tour of Spain. Perez, who finished second on the tour, gave an irregular blood test after the race that indicated he had undergone a transfusion.

 The 27-year-old, riding for Phonak at the time, denied any wrongdoing, and may still appeal against the decision.

 Perez?s former teammate at Phonak, American Tyler Hamilton, also tested positive for blood transfusions after the Olympics and the Tour of Spain. He was cleared by the IOC, but a final decision over his case has yet to be made.

 ?(I) checked my luggage through. There was a rugby game going on and we were watching that game and I gave myself half an hour to get a boarding pass. But when I got to the check-in desk, it was closed. I thought they had given my seat away but thankfully we were able to make a plan,? he said.

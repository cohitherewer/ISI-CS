 Pak name 8 top players 

Karachi: Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has named eight top players for participation in the Premier Hockey League (PHL) scheduled to be held in Chandigarh early next year. 

Pakistani captain Mohammad Saqlain, striker Rehan Butt, goalkeepers Salman Akber and Ahmed Alam, Mohammad Shabbir, Shakeel Abbasi and penalty-corner specialists Imran Warsi and Adnan Zakir will play in second edition of the event. Young short-corner specialist Mohammad Imran has been named as a stand-by, according to a report published in a Pakistani newspaper on Saturday. 

Missing from the list is dragflicker Sohail Abbas, who was the biggest star of the inaugural edition of the PHL in Hyderabad. 

A PHF official, however, said that though the players had been named, the dates of the event were still an issue. 

We want our players to go to India and their players to come and play in our league. But there is still a problem because the PHL dates clash with our national championship, Sardar Naveed Khan, director (marketing), PHF was quoted in the news report. 

He said the PHF was trying to reschedule their three-tier national championship as much as possible and expected similar flexibility over PHL dates from the Indian Hockey Federation. (PTI)

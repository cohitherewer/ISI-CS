 US scrape past Holland 2-1

Perth: James Blake put a nightmare year behind him on Tuesday, helping the US make a winning start to their defence of the Hopman Cup. 

Blake, who missed much of 2004 through a combination of injury, illness and the death of his father, looked close to his best beating Peter Wessels 6-1, 7-6. 

Meghann Shaughnessy had earlier defeated Michaella Krajicek 7-5, 6-4 and, though she and Blake were beaten 7-5, 7-5 by Wessels and Krajicek in the mixed doubles, the US emerged 2-1 winners in their group B clash against The Netherlands. 

The 25-year-old Blake produced a typically athletic performance, breaking back when Wessels served for the second set at 5-3 and winning the tiebreak 7-4. 

?I really didn?t know what to expect coming back,? Blake said. 

?I think I played some of my best tennis in the first set, and when it was tight in the second, I still managed to come back well.? 

Blake broke a vertebra in his neck when practising at the Rome Masters last May and his father Tom died in July from cancer. 

Blake?s ranking dropped to 97 at the end of the season but the American said he had not set himself any specific goals for 2005. 

?A few things last year helped me put things in perspective, and I am just glad to be playing again,? he said. 

?I love doing what I do for a living and I love playing here.? 

Earlier, Shaughnessy, who received a late call-up to the team after an injury to Lindsay Davenport, survived a tough test from 15-year-old Krajicek, to put the Americans ahead. 

Krajicek, sister of former Wimbledon champion Richard, surprised Shaughnessy with her ability and composure, but the American?s experience helped her secure a straight-sets victory. 

?She made me feel old out there,? the 25-year-old Shaughnessy said. 

?I?d never seen her play before but she is a great player. She has a great serve and I knew that I had to serve well myself.?

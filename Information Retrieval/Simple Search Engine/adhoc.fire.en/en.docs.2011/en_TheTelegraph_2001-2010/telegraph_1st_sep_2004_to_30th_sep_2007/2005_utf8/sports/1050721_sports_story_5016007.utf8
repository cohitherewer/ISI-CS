 Hari settles for quick draw 

Taiyuan: World junior champion Grandmaster P. Harikrishna settled for a quick draw with GM Ni Hua of China in the 10th and penultimate round of the second Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters chess tournament and retained his half-point lead over nearest rival GM Alexander Motylev of Russia. 

Harikrishna is now on eight points from the first 10 games. 

Motylev failed to make the most of his game against Chinas Wang Yue and settled for a draw. 

The Chinese trio of Yue, Hua and Bu Xiangzhi ? once the youngest GM of the world ? is next in line with 5.5 points each. 

Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, who drew with Wang Hao, moved to five points and was lying on a par with Tigran Petrosian of Armenia pointwise. 

Yesterday the Indian Grandmaster had registered a crucial win against Bu Xiangzhi of China. (PTI)

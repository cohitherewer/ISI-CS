 Jeev finishes tied 18th

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh strung together a fine five-under 66 in the final round to finish tied 18th in the ?120 million Aiful Cup on Sunday. 

Jeev had a bogey-free round with three birdies on the front nine and two on the back for a good days work at the Daisen Ark Country Club. 

The 34-year-old from Chandigarh, 38th on the Japan merit list, finished at 10-under 274 with rounds of 74, 65, 69 and 66 for his fourth finish in the top-20. 

Local hero Tatsuhiko Takahashi won his maiden title here after nine years on the Tour as he kept at bay the fast-approaching Yasuaki Takashima in the final stages. (PTI)

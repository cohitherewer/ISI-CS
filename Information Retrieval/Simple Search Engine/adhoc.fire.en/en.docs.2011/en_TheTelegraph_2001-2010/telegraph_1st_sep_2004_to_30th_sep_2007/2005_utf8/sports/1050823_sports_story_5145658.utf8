 Tokyo: Japan?s former Olympic champion Naoko Takahashi is set to run her first race in two years at the Tokyo International Marathon in November.

 Takahashi, who won gold at the Sydney Olympics five years ago, flopped badly in Tokyo in 2003 and subsequently failed to qualify for last year?s Athens Games.

 ?It has felt like my career came to a halt in Tokyo,? the 33-year-old said in a statement on Monday. ?It makes sense to restart my career in Tokyo.?

 Takahashi has been training at altitude in Colorado in preparation for her comeback on November 20 after ditching long-time coach Yoshio Koide earlier this year.

 Lokomotiv coach Eduard Eranosian said on Monday the ban would start with immediate effect after Uefa informed the Bulgarian club of their decision. Kamburov will miss the second leg at home to OFK on Thursday. 

 Madrid: Valencia need to sign a replacement for Edu after the Brazilian midfielder suffered a serious knee injury, coach Quique Sanchez Flores said.

 ?It is an absolute priority to find a substitute for Edu,? Sanchez Flores told a sports daily on Monday. ?His injury has been a major setback. Edu and Baraja are the two players that give us direction in midfield.?

 The 27-year-old Brazilian will be out for around six months after tearing the cruciate ligament in his left knee during training on Saturday.

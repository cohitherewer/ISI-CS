Calcutta: Prakash Padukone isnt losing hope. It was in 1997 that Padukone took the lead to fight for better facilities for the players and bring about a change in the functioning of Badminton Association of India (BAI) with the formation of Indian Badminton Confederation. I tried to put a system in place during those three years, he recounts. 

Today, he wants a professional administration in place that will help the game reach new heights. He also wants players and officials to work in close proximity to achieve the best results. 

I will prefer a full-time professional to be at the helm. In England, the Badminton Association of England Ltd runs the show. It is the same even in smaller countries like New Zealand. A CEO is employed to oversee its functioning with former players and coaches coming in to offer help when needed, Indias first All-England champion, who is in the city to inaugurate the senior state badminton championships, explained on Thursday. 

Will he be eager to take the post of CEO if BAI offers him the job? I will decide when the offer comes, he said. 

Besides a professional administration, Padukone feels the players should also start feeling hungry for more success. The players here do not aspire to reach the next level. The facilities have increased manifold. A little more effort and determination is needed. One mustnt be satisfied by just being in the top-60. There are lot of opportunities available and one has to work hard towards achieving that. 

It took almost 20 years for Pullela Gopichand to be the second Indian to lift the crown after Padukone won the All-England title in 1980. How long will India have to wait for the next champion? 

Thats a difficult question, he grinned. There is no dearth of talent in the country. But today the problem lies with players getting easily satisfied. The lunge to make the next grade isnt that intense. Logically, players should first aim to be among the top six in the world. Then comes the desire to break ahead, he pointed out. 

According to Padukone, P. Kashyap is a talent worth noticing. He is still at the junior level but is already at ease against senior players, he said. Padukone ? whose all-time greats remain Rudi Hartono, Morten Frost and Liem Swie King ? is pinning hopes on Saina Mehwal of Hyderabad as well. She is the countrys best talent. Shes only 15 and already ranked No. 2 among seniors. Dedicated, disciplined and very promising.

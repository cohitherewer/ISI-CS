 Palm Beach Gardens (US): Former women?s world champ Susan Polgar is believed to have broken four international chess records this week after playing more than 1,100 games over 17 hours.

 The records, which still have to be confirmed by the Guinness Book of World Records are:

 Polgar?s opponents, who ranged in age from four to 95, sat before identical chessboards at long rows of tables at the Palm Beach Gardens mall. Polgar remained standing, walking from board to board. By 3 am, she had walked more than 14.5 kms.

 Wellington: New Zealand Cricket umpire Doug Cowie announced his retirement from all levels of the game on Wednesday after 20 years at first-class and Test levels.

 Sao Paulo: Pele said on Tuesday that he helped persuade his former club Santos to sell their 21-year-old striker Robinho to Real Madrid in a $30 million transfer.

 Real Madrid announced last Saturday that they had managed to complete the deal, ending a long-running transfer saga.

 ?As a lifelong advisor at Santos, I gave my opinion,? Pele said at an event in Sao Paulo organised by a World Cup sponsor. ?I knew that if it went to Fifa, Santos would not win. So they listened to my opinion.?

 But Pele, who spent 17 years of his career at Santos, criticised Robinho for refusing to train or play before the deal had been completed. 

 Madrid: England captain David Beckham is set to extend his contract at Real Madrid by two years till 2009, a Spanish sports daily reported on Wendesday.

 It said the 30-year-old midfielder, who has often said he is enjoying his time at the Spanish giants and would like to end his career there, asked club president Florentino Perez for the extension. Perez agreed and the deal should go through in September.

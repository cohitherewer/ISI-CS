The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Security personnel on the ball

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Dambulla: The driver of an unregistered car was questioned by security personnel after he parked his vehicle next to the Indian team bus, a mere 15 metres from the nets area off the Rangiri International Stadium, on Tuesday afternoon. 

The car was hired from the team hotel by a couple of journalists, who themselves didnt notice anything amiss till local police and the elite Ministerial Security Division (MSD) officers asked the driver to immediately remove his vehicle from that parking lot. 

The driver shouldnt have been at the wheel of a car without registration... Of course, he didnt have bad intentions and, so, got away by being questioned only, one of the MSD officers told The Telegraph. 

The hotel, one learns, hired the vehicle from a private operator. The local police were to question the operator, too, for flouting rules. 

It wasnt a close shave, so to say, but the incident did reveal the security personnels alertness. Incidentally, an Indian High Commission-assigned security officer is with Rahul Dravid and Co. throughout.

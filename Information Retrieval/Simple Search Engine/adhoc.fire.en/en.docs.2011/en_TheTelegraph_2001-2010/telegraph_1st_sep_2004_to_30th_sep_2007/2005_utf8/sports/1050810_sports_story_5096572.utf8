 Aussies draft in rookie Clark for cover

 - Down with knee infection, Brett Lee spends night in hospital

Birmingham: Australia were bracing themselves for a second blow to their Ashes tour within a week after Brett Lee spent the night in hospital with a knee infection. 

Captain Ricky Ponting, already resigned to playing the third Test at Old Trafford without fast bowler Glenn McGrath, will hope for better news from Lee although the strike bowler will not be travelling to Manchester with the squad. 

The world champions, seeking a ninth successive Ashes series win, were pegged back to 1-1 at Edgbaston on Sunday. McGrath missed the defeat, damaging ankle ligaments just before the start by stepping on a stray cricket ball. 

On Tuesday, Australia drafted in uncapped fast bowler Stuart Clark as cover for the injured pair after he impressed selectors with his form with English county side Middlesex. 

Another option could be the untested 22-year-old fast bowler Shaun Tait, who is already in the Test squad. 

We consider Stuart to be a similar bowler to Glenn McGrath. He is already in England and showing some good form, so we have selected him to provide some cover for the current injuries, said chairman of selectors, Trevor Hohns. 

Clark, 29, is a right-arm pace bowler who took 40 wickets at 25.98 in the 2004-2005 Australian domestic season. Playing for New South Wales, he took 5 for 10 during a match against Victoria. 

In his most recent match for Middlesex, he took 5 for 61 against Warwickshire. 

Lees problem stems back to the first Test at Lords, when he grazed his left knee while fielding a ball. 

The knee has become inflamed again and he was on an intravenous drip and receiving antibiotics on Monday night in a Birmingham hospital. 

Australia physiotherapist Errol Alcott said he was optimistic about Lees chances although the exact cause of the infection had yet to be diagnosed. When pressed, he added: Its not easy to say. My answer to that question is always 50-50. 

Alcott would also not make a prediction over McGrath but he was still limping on Monday night, albeit without the surgical boot that was used to protect his ankle. 

Alcott confirmed that the fast bowler had suffered extensive ligament damage. McGrath seems certain to target his comeback for the fourth Test. 

Australia were already considering remodelling their attack for Old Trafford. The wicket, while hard, is expected to take spin and Stuart MacGill, who has had success against England in the past, is hoping to team up with fellow leg-spinner Shane Warne. 

The loss of Lee, however, would be another significant blow. 

McGrath took nine wickets and was the Man of the Match at Lords, while Lee took five in the second Test and scored a courageous 43 not out in the fourth innings to take his side to within two runs of England. 

It seems ironic that Lee should be laid low by an old graze, considering the number of blows he took to hand and body during that innings. 

Jason Gillespie, with two wickets for 163 in the series, and Michael Kasprowicz made up the pace bowling attack with Lee at Edgbaston but neither was as effective. Kasprowicz, McGraths replacement, took three for 109. 

England are unlikely to feel much sympathy, following their own bowling injury problems during the last two Ashes series. 

In 2002-03, Darren Gough and Andrew Flintoff missed the entire series, Simon Jones lasted one morning while Ashley Giles broke his hand after a single Test. When Alex Tudor came in, he was put in hospital by a bouncer while Chris Silverwood bowled four overs before having to return home with an ankle problem.

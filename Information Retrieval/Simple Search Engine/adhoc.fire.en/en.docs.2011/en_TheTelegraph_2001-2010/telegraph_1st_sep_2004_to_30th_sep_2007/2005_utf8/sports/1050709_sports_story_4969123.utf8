The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 London robbed of sporting innocence

 - Terrorism is not about achieving things, its an end in itself

And so at a stroke the city of joy became the city of horror. That is the way of b******s: they hit us when we are most vulnerable and they rejoice in doing so. 

On Wednesday, we were celebrating the fact that in London in seven years time, thousands of people will do thousands of silly things to get a bit of tin hung round their necks and we were all relishing the way we would cheer ourselves silly in response. 

Sport requires a certain innocence. Without innocence, the glorious inconsequentialities of sport could not exist. We demand that people take part in sport as if it were a life-and-death matter, and yet all of us, participants and audience both, know that it is all most frightfully silly. 

Its only that without the assumption of seriousness, it wouldnt be any fun. Betting is fun only if you stake slightly more than you can afford; sport is fun only if you take it slightly more seriously than it is worth. 

That is why sport makes us so horribly vulnerable. And vulnerable, in this case, to the b******s. 

So on Wednesday, London was full of rejoicing ? the Olympic Games of 2012 will be held there and we will all have lots and lots of fun. 

British chaps will run faster than other chaps, British women will leap farther than other women, we will have sword-fighters and tumblers and strong men and punchers and grapplers and ball-whackers and sailors and rowers and shooters and Robin Hoods and ping-pongers and all the pretty horses and, of course, beach volleyball at Horse Guards Parade. 

Such larks, Pip, such larks! 

And now we have death and injury and blood and terror and bravery and chaos and a million phone calls of thank God youre safe and a few hundred that followed a rather different script. 

A city is by definition a soft target; a city suffused with the sporting delight feels the horror that much more keenly. The contrast with the innocent frivolities of the day before is altogether too much. 

Most of us who travel on the Tube in London are not warriors. Very few of us wish active harm to Muslims. Many of us feel unhappy about Britains involvement in Iraq. Most of us want to do a good days work, get home to our loved ones, maybe have a nice drink and at the weekend, perhaps enjoy a spot of sport. 

For those crimes, some have received the death sentence, others life-changing injuries, thousands have been given a day of terror they will never forget and millions a day of grinding misery. 

On Wednesday we were all so merry. 

When terrorism moves into sport, on purpose or, as it seems in this case, by coincidence, we feel an extra pang of horror. This is not a war in which we face our enemies in battledress, fully armed and trained to the minute. 

On Thursday, Londoners went to war armed with a newspaper and briefcase, an iPod, some in the comfy seat in the corner, others hanging from the straps, some meeting a friend on the way: Old Seb did it again, eh? Pity about the poor French, though. When do you think well be able to get tickets? 

Ive always wanted to go to the gymnastics. For me its got to be 100 metres. Then bang. B******s. 

I have always been haunted by the story of the men who broke into the Olympic village in Munich in 1972, the last Games at which there was a deep and genuine innocence abroad. The armed Black September terrorists crept into the village late at night and they were spotted. 

They were spotted by a bunch of athletes who had broken the curfew and gone out for a few beers and were climbing the fence to get back in. 

Laughing merrily, the two groups helped each other over and said their farewells on the other side, one group to boozy slumbers and dreams of glory, the others to kill a few Israelis. 

They killed some Israelis in order to ? well, there you may have spotted the weakness in the whole scheme. 

They killed some Israelis in order to make them dead, I suppose. In order to do a bit of terror. What they achieved for the Islamic world was ? well, absolutely nothing. All the same, the attack changed the world. You now get searched going into big sporting events. But thats it. 

I was in Vienna, of all places, in the summer of 1972. I decided to have a little treat one sunny morning. I bought myself a nice Viennese cigar, a speciality of the place, for I used to smoke then, and an airmail Daily Mirror, for it was a grown-up newspaper then. I found a seat in the park in the sun, got my cigar going nicely and then settled back to a good old read: scan the front and then get stuck into the sport. 

And the cigar turned to ashes in my mouth. I stubbed it out and the sun stubbed itself out, too, as I read of the horrors in that days paper: the athletes who were killed because they came from Israel. 

And part of my horror was deeply childish ? how could they spoil this? 

They spoilt my cigar and my treat; they spoilt the worlds treat. The sort of people who spoil sport in that terrible way seemed at that moment more vividly wicked than any other kind. 

Sport is, above all, a celebration of being alive. Those people who willingly and frivolously turn it into a festival of being dead are b******s. 

Their eagerness to spoil the worlds innocent frivolities spells out the eternal truth about terrorism. It is this: terrorism is not about achieving things; terrorism is an end in itself.

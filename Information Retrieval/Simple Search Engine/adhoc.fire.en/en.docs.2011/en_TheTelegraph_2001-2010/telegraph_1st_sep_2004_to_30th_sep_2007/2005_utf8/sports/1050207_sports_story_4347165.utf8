Cape Town: South Africa capitalised on a Herschelle Gibbs century to crush England by 108 runs in the fourth one-day International at Newlands on Sunday. 

Gibbs scored 100 and put on 143 with Jacques Kallis (71) for the third wicket as South Africa made 291 for five, the highest score of the series, after being put in. 

England, in reply, collapsed to 183 all out in 41.2 overs, Makhaya Ntini taking three wickets for 29 as the home side went 2-1 up in the seven-match series. 

It was Gibbs? 14th one-day hundred and included eight fours and three sixes. Big-hitting Justin Kemp then hammered 57 off 36 balls, including four sixes, as 98 came off the last 10 overs. 

England hit early trouble in reply when they lost three wickets for three runs in 12 balls to slump to 35 for three. 

Ntini got rid of Geraint Jones (19) and Michael Trescothick (13) while Shaun Pollock removed Michael Vaughan for a duck, before Kevin Pietersen produced the sole defiance with 75 off 85 balls. 

England?s fast bowlers had struggled at the start of the day. Kabir Ali, having taken one for 22 off eight overs, conceded 36 off his last two as Kemp cut loose, while Steve Harmison, on his recall after injury, shed 44 off his first five overs before finishing with one for 65. 

England openers Marcus Trescothick and Geraint Jones attacked, but the home bowlers maintained their line and length. 

Ntini was the first to strike, when he had Jones caught behind for 19. Pollock followed suit, snaring the wicket of a nervous-looking Vaughan, well caught at slip for a duck. (Reuters)

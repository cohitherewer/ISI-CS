 Australia, a team in decline

Simon Barnes

 Pietersen has been playing like a habitual tyrant 

A strange thing happened in Nottingham on Thursday. Australia inserted the knife and neglected to twist it. They let England off. They did so because there is a softness at the heart of this team. They can win this Test series only by default. It might happen. 

They might yet prove to be a better side than England but, by God, they are a worse side than they used to be. 

This is a team in decline, there is no mistaking the signs. The outcome of the series depends on the question of whether England have risen higher than Australia have sunk. This is a difficult question indeed, especially when it is considered how high Australia were at their, as it were, perihelion. But they are on their return journey now, moving away from the sun at some pace. 

They began the day bowling in perfect batting conditions. Glenn McGrath, the spearhead, was injured again ? and the rest of the quick bowlers bowled in the morning as if they were missing Daddy. A proper Australia side keeps finding new heroes ? this one keep missing old ones. 

Decline of the Australian Empire, yes, but is this decline and fall? That is the question that is keeping us all on the edge of our seats. 

So then the cricketing gods, perverse beings even by the standard of sporting deities, decided to spice things up a bit. Lets chuck a bit of rain at the pitch, and some uncomfortable light and lets see if that doesnt swing it back Australias way. 

So there is a softness, a new softness about Australia. No ducking out of the way of that one. But how much hardness is there about England? And is it enough? There is no point in the opposition making errors if you dont punish them. You need a real relish for making the error-makers feel bad. 

There is no profit in forgiving an unforgivable error. Do you know what intimidated so many teams when they played against the great Australia side? It was the dread of making an error. They knew what would happen if they gave Australia the slightest amount of help and the fear itself led them into error. 

No longer. Australian errors gave England the chance to test their own capacity for causing pain. Vaughan was the man to do the knife-twisting, and he managed maybe a half or three-quarter turn. 

Australia may be softer than they were, but England arent as hard as the Australia of old. Ah yes, but are they as hard as the Australia of now? Thats the point, and thats what every day of this series keeps asking. 

In the final period of the day, Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen played under a darkening sky like a pair of habitual truants vying for the part of school swot. Australia have acquired a soft centre; England a hard shell. Both are vulnerable, that is the fascination of the series. Their strengths are closely matched, but so are their weaknesses. The victory will go to the side that best exploits the oppositions weaknesses and cover up their own.

Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan took six for 36 on his return to Test cricket and Thilan Samaraweera scored 51 as Sri Lanka won the first Test against the West Indies by six wickets on Saturday. 

Muralidharans 45th five-wicket haul in Tests left Sri Lanka chasing a modest 172 for victory on the fourth day, a target they achieved comfortably despite fine fast bowling from Jermaine Lawson who took four for 43. 

The 23-year-old gave Sri Lanka a fright during a hostile post-lunch spell, taking the wickets of Sanath Jayasuriya (15), Kumar Sangakkara (0) and Maravan Atapattu (28). 

Jayasuriya was acrobatically caught at backward-point by Xavier Marshall, Sangakkara edged his first ball to second slip and Atapattu glanced a catch down the legside where keeper Denesh Ramdin took a fine diving catch. 

The West Indies suddenly sensed the possibility of a major upset. But Samaraweera and Mahela Jayawardene, who made 41 not out, rescued Sri Lanka, weathering a difficult spell against the West Indies pacers and then counterattacking with some aggressive strokeplay during an 86-run fourth-wicket stand. 

Lawson returned after tea to separate the pair, trapping Samaraweera leg-before for 51 with a full-length inswinger, but vice-captain Jayawardene guided Sri Lanka home without further alarm in par- tnership with Tillekeratne Dilshan, who made 30 not out. 

Like Muralidharan, Lawson marked his return to the Test arena after an injury lay-off with a fine display, bowling at great pace on a flat pitch and finishing with eight for 102 for the match. (Reuters)

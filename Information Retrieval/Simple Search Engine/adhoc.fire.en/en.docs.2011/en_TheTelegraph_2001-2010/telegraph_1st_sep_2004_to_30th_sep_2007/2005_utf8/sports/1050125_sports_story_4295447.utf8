 Bangalore Derby 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: A field of 11 runners, including seven colts and four fillies, will face the starter in the 2,400m Bangalore winter Derby on Wednesday. On their past and current form, it boils down to four ? Full Speed, Big B, Camarioca and Forever Elegance ? who look the main contenders.

 But Classic records heavily favour Full Speed, from Irfan Ghatala?s yard. The Burden Of Proof-Speedy Beauty son is the winner of the Mysore 2000 Guineas and the Derby. 

 Among his rivals, V. Lokanath?s Big B has three effortless wins under his belt and is yet to reveal his full potential. The Pennine Ridge-Byzara son would take some beating If he stays the Derby trip.

 The Rashid Byramji-ward Camarioca, an easy winner of a 2,000m race, has proved her staying abilities while giving a stiff fight to S. Ganapathy?s Guineas and Oaks winner Forever Elegance who is likely to carry the public purse.

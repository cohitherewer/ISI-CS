 Jeev finishes tied 7th

Nagoya: Jeev Milkha Singh posted his second top-10 finish in as many appearances on the Japan golf Tour this season as he tied for the seventh spot after a superb seven-under 64 in the final round of the Token Homemate Cup on Sunday. 

Tadahiro Takayama won the Token Homemate Cup, which was reduced to three rounds at the par-71 Token Tado Country Club. 

Driving at almost his very best, Jeev shot eight birdies and just one bogey on the 11th to card the day?s best score from among the 65 professionals who played the final day. 

Besides his driving, Jeev also putted very well needing just 25 to go through the round. On the first two days he needed 26 and 33, during rounds of one-under 70 and five-over 75. (PTI)

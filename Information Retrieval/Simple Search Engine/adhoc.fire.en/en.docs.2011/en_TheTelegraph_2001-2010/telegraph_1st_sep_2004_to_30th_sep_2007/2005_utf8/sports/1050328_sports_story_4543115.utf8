 Ranbir flays detractors

Mumbai: The BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra on Sunday took a dig at those who have dragged him to court in Chennai saying they were not connected with the game. 

?BCCI is competent enough to handle such problems. The persons doing these are not connected with the game. We, however, welcome suggestions from any quarters,? he said, after receiving the CCI?s life membership. (PTI)

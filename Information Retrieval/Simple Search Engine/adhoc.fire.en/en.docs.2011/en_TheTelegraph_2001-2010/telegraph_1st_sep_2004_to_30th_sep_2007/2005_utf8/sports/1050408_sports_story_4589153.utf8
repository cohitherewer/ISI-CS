 Whatmore eyes India top job

London: Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore has expressed willingness to become the coach of Team India in place of the outgoing John Wright. 

Whatmore, also former coach of Sri Lanka, said coaching the Indians ?would excite me, absolutely? and added he could talk to the Indians over the issue. 

?They?d (Indians) better make up their minds soon ? my contract (with Bangladesh) expires on April 30. I?m a professional ? of course I?d be interested in talking to the Indians,? Whatmore said on Thursday. 

Besides Whatmore, former Australian captain Greg Chappell was reportedly in the running to replace Wright, who is set to quit after India?s ongoing one-day series against Pakistan. 

Whatmore, who coached Sri Lanka to world cup glory in 1996, was handed the Bangladesh job two years ago and oversaw their first-ever Test win over Zimbabwe in January. 

Whatmore revealed that talks over a new Bangladesh contract were at an advanced stage but he was not sure if he would sign the deal. (PTI)

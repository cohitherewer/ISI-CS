 Warne breaks Lillee record

Perth: Shane Warne is showing no signs of slowing down at an age when most bowlers have already quit. 

The 36-year-old Australian leg-spinner already holds the world record for the most Test wickets and now owns the mark for the most in a calendar year. 

On Saturday he broke the previous record of 85, set by Australian pacer Dennis Lillee in 1981, with a three-wicket haul against South Africa. 

Warne has now taken 87 wickets this year with the second innings of this Test and another match still to come before year ends. 

Its obviously a very proud achievement, he said. 

Ive played 15 odd seasons of international cricket and to have your best season at this stage, aged 36, really makes me look forward to the next few seasons. 

Warne may be in the twilight of his career, but he is playing better than ever. 

He may not turn the ball as sharply as he once did and might no longer be using the flipper, but remains just as potent. 

He captured 40 wickets in this years Ashes series in England and his three wickets against the Proteas on Saturday lifted his career tally to 648. 

Warne is 70 in front of his nearest rival, Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan, but said he expects all his records to eventually fall. 

Itd be nice if it lasted another 24 or 25 years but I dont think it will because theres obviously a lot more Test cricket being played these days, he said. 

Warne has made a career out of tormenting opposition batsman and played a leading role in reviving the art of spin bowling, just as Lillee inspired a generation of Australian fast bowlers. 

Warne said he grew up idolising Lillee and the fiery pacer, who lives in Perth and was at the ground to see Warne break his record on Saturday, returned the compliment. 

I was happy Shane was the one who did it, Lillee said. If anyone deserves it, its Shane. Id go anywhere to watch him play.

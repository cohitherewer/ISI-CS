 Grischuk in semis

Khanty Mansiysk (Russia): Russian Grandmaster Alexandre Grischuk displayed steely nerves to beat Israeli GM Boris Gelfand in the blitz games of the quarter final tiebreak to assure himself a place in the last four of the World Chess Cup here. 

Grischuk joined the likes of former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine, Levon Aronian of Armenia and Etienne Bacrot of France, who had already qualified to the next round by virtue of their winning performances in normal time control games of the quarter finals. (PTI)

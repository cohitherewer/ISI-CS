London: Ashes hero Andrew Flintoff revealed on Thursday that he would accept an offer to captain England and brushed aside suggestions there was a rift after current skipper Michael Vaughan suggested he would not be suitable. 

Flintoff was the star of Englands 2-1 Ashes series win over Australia in the summer and Vaughan believes the allrounders workload would be overwhelming if he was also captain. 

But Flintoff insisted he would be ready for the challenge if an opportunity to lead his country arose after Vaughans reign. 

I think everyone in the side has got aspirations of captaining their country, if it ever came up Id jump at the chance, Flintoff said. 

At the moment Vaughany is doing an unbelievable job, Im enjoying playing under him and long may it continue but if ? maybe a few years down the line ? there is a chance then its obviously something youd have to be interested in. 

He was only saying what he thinks, Ive known Michael for a few years and he would have my best interests at heart so its not something thats going to bother or upset me. 

Flintoff wants to retain the Ashes Urn in a years time and also make an impression at the World Cup the following summer. 

I want to play in a Test side ranked No.1 in the world, which would mean retaining the Ashes next year, Flintoff told a radio station. 

I want to win a World Cup, Ive played in two and have not been through to the super-six stages yet. So the West Indies will be a big few months. 

Meanwhile, England cricketers will raise funds for earthquake victims in Pakistan by playing in a golf event next month in Lahore. 

The English players will take part in a four-ball contest, with each group containing three businessmen and one cricketer, on December 4 at the Royal Palm Beach course in Lahore. 

Former Pakistan players, including ex-captain Wasim Akram will also take part in the event. 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan said the tourists had more plans to help those affected by the tragedy. 

They will let us know in the next few days. But by agreeing to play the golf event they have already made a very good gesture, Shaharyar said. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan and England will make early starts to their first two Tests next month in Multan and Faisalabad to overcome weather-related problems. 

The first two Tests will have a 9.30 am (0430 GMT) start and end at 4.30 p.m., with a minimum of 83 overs to be bowled in the day. The third Test in Lahore will have a 10.00 a.m. start with 90 overs to be bowled, weather and light permitting. (AGENCIES)

 Player lands Thakur in hospital 

 - India forward undergoes surgery for nasal fracture 

 Deepak Thakur 

New Delhi: Olympian Deepak Thakur was on Saturday hospitalised with a broken nose and injured arms after he was beaten up by a rival player during the Maharaja Ranjit Singh hockey tournament. 

Thakur, playing for Indian Oil, was hit repeatedly on the face by Punjab Police defender Kanwalpreet Singh, also an international player, and had to be rushed to the Apollo hospital where he underwent a surgery in the evening for a nasal fracture. 

Punjab Police paid the price for Kanwalpreet?s act as the side was thrown out of the competition and Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) observer Charanjit Singh Raheja recommended action against the player as well as the team. 

?Keeping in view the gravity of the incident, Punjab Police team has been suspended from the tournament. This decision was taken unanimously by the managing committee,? tourna ment director A.S. Bawa said. 

The incident took place when Thakur apparently objected to Kanwalpreet?s tackling of Prabhjot Singh, an IOC forward, during a Super League match at the Shivaji Stadium. 

Incensed over the objection, Kanwalpreet hit Thakur ?intentionally? with his stick more than once inflicting facial injuries on the player. 

?Kanwalpreet hit Thakur mercilessly with his stick. I don?t know what provoked the Punjab Police defender. Thakur lay on turf bleeding profusely for sometime before he was taken to the hospital,? umpire Avinash Srivatsava said. 

The incident occured 14 minutes into the contest after which it was called off and Punjab Police scrapped from the competition. 

Hospital sources said the player had no ?serious? injuries. ?He has nasal fracture and injuries to the shoulder and arm. There is nothing serious about his injuries.? 

Raheja, meanwhile, spoke to the IHF secretary K. Jothikumaran over phone informing him of the incident. 

?I will be sending my report to the IHF after the tournament. But I will be definitely recommending stringent measures against the player as well as the team,? Raheja said. ?I spoke to Mr Jothikumaran over phone today and he seemed to be very upset with it.? (PTI)

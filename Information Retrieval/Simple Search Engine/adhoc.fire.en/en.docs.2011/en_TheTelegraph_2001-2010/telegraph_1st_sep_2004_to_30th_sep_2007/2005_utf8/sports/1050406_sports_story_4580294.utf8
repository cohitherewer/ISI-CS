The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Task cut out for EB 

 - AFC CUP - Suresh doubtful against Al Faisaly 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Suresh has a hamstring injury 

Calcutta: East Bengal will not only be fighting for survival in the AFC Cup, but will also have to battle extreme conditions when they take on Al Faisaly at the National Stadium in Jordan on Wednesday. 

The red-and-gold have a solitary point from two outings and have a tricky away match on hand in the near freezing temperatures of west Asia. According to information received here, the team has not only to contend with cold (Tuesday?s highest temperature being 14? and the lowest ?2?), but also the wind factor and poor visibility. 

Apart from M. Suresh, who has a hamstring injury and seems doubtful for the match, the rest of the players are fit. The players had a practice session at the National Stadium on Tuesday. The match will start at 5 pm local time (7.30 pm in India). 

Meanwhile, the soaring heat could pose a hurdle for Al Hussein when they take on Federation Cup champions Dempo in the AFC Cup league match at Nehru Stadium, Fatorda on Wednesday, adds PTI from Margao. 

Al Hussein, leading the group with an impressive 4-0 win over Al Ahed, need a draw to remain on top at the end of the first leg. 

Coming from the colder zones, the Jordanians, ranked third in their national league, might be troubled by the hot and humid conditions. However, they have arrived here three days well in advance to get acclimatised and have had five practice sessions so far. 

Al Hussein team manager Fahmi Roshan Naimi said their aim was to win and was confident that his team would collect full points. ?We have watched Dempo play against Al Ahed. They are a good side and I was impressed with their style of playing long passes,? he said, adding Nigerian striker Ranty Martins and ?keeper Satish Kumar could pose threat to them. 

?We have special plans to counter Ranty,? Fahmi stated. 

Al Hussein players, with the average height of six feet, would play the long ball more to unsettle their opponents. Coach Osama Ahmed Saleem said ?we will begin cautiously, but go all out towards the end?. 

The in-form Jordan club appears to be formidable as they boast of players from Egypt and Iraq. Egyptians ? Ibrahim Yehia and Othman Mohammed ? would handle the defence, while Iraq?s Mazin Muhsen would be the linkman in the midfield. 

Olympian Ahmad Hatamleh, the 22-year old midfielder, would be another key member while 26-year-old striker Anas Zboun, who is known to gel well with the likes of Husein Ahmad Radad and Omar Ahmad, would form Al Hussein?s strike force. 

Dempo, who had light session Tuesday morning would be missing Sameer Naik, Jose Colaco, Lazarus Fernandes and Raju Singh due to injuries, while Stanley Colaco with a groin injury remained a doubtful starter. 

Coach Armando Colaco was confident that the boys would rise to the occasion as they did against East Bengal in the National League and Al Ahed in Beirut in the AFC Cup match, where they went down narrowly through a controversial goal. 

?We have watched our opponent during practice in the last three days and have worked out a plan to counter them. We know for sure that they will try to play cautiously in the beginning and are ready for it,? he said. 

?Our boys know how to handle pressure and they did not get bogged down against Al Ahed, who were tall and robust, but played their attacking game with varied pattern,? added Colaco. 

Dempo?s strike partners Ranty Martins and R.C. Prakash said they would give their best and strive for victory.

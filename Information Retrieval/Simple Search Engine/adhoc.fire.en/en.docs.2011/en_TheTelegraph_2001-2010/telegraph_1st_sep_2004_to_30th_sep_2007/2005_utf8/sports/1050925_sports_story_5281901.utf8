The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It will take Mahesh 2-3 lifetimes to achieve what I have: Paes

 - Taking part in a 5th Olympic Games is pushing me, says Indian Davis Cup captain 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

New Delhi: Unseasonal rains in the capital may have given other players a break, but for Indias Davis Cup captain, there was little time to relax. He had three business meetings to attend before talking to The Telegraph over lunch at the team hotel. 

The following are excerpts: 

Q Mahesh Bhupathi recently won his ninth Grand Slam title. You have seven so far. Based on these figures, some people are saying Bhupathi is the most successful Indian tennis player. Does this hurt you? 

A There will always be some armchair experts who will make such uneducated comments. But I know where I stand, Mahesh knows what hes done. The knowledgeable writers and fans are very much aware of my record in the Olympics, Asian Games, my singles and doubles record on the Tour. Then theres the longevity factor? Ive been playing for nearly two decades now, I was successful as a junior also. There can be no comparison between him (Mahesh) and me. Let me put it this way: it will take Mahesh 2-3 lifetimes to achieve what I have. 

You had said at the start of the year that (Nenad) Zimonjic and you are capable of winning a Grand Slam. All four Slams are over and you didnt manage to get to the semis in even one of those? 

You are right, but were still the No. 5 team in the world, so you cant say we have flopped. We won two big events in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, reached the quarter finals at the French Open and Wimbledon. We had a very good middle season but our results in the US hardcourt season werent upto the mark. The indoor season is coming up, thats Zimos favourite. I also love playing on indoor synthetic courts. Im optimistic of finishing the year on a high. 

Are you surely going to play with Zimonjic in 2006, or will you look for a different partner? 

I will be making that decision in a months time. Id like to see how we do in the indoor meets and whether we can push our ranking up further. If I see we are stuck at No. 5 and theres somebody available with whom I have a chance to get to No. 1, I may explore that option. 

You had that terrible on-court shoulder injury during the mixed doubles final at the French Open, despite that you took a risk and played Wimbledon. Do you rue that decision as your shoulder isnt 100 per cent yet? 

I wouldnt have played any other event. Because it was Wimbledon, I took a chance. I dont regret that, we reached the quarter finals there. I took a long break after that. 

Would you have played singles in Davis Cup this week had the shoulder injury healed fully? 

Probably yes. I talked to a lot of respected people about this and most of them felt I should play singles if I was fully fit. Being the captain, I had to look at it responsibly from all aspects. Hence I took the decision to opt out of singles though it wasnt an easy one. 

The Harsh Mankad controversy put you in an awkward position, didnt it? 

I was not even directly involved, it was between Harsh and the selectors. But since none of the parties were willing to thrash it out, I had to come into the picture. It was an avoidable issue which could have been sorted out by plain talking. Harsh was digging his own grave by contemplating staying out of the tie. I explained to him and, realised it and flew over to India. It was one of the trickiest situations I have faced in my career. 

How did you ultimately solve the fourth member issue? Wasnt that a difficult one as well? 

The night before the draw, I sought the opinion of all players during team meeting. Prakash (Amritraj) felt the best thing for him would be to play (Jonas) Bjorkman on the first day. Everyone agreed, including me. For that to happen, Prakash had to be the top-ranked player of our team, so Harsh had to sit out. Harsh said if that was the unanimous feeling, he would opt out of the race for the fourth member. It was a great gesture by Harsh? It showed what a teamman he is. By that one gesture, he made up for his folly of announcing that he wouldnt come to Delhi unless he was assured he would be included in the four-man squad. 

After so many years and so much success, whats driving you to prolong your career? 

I had promised my dad Id compete in four Olympics. Ive achieved that, now I want to raise the bar. I want to take part in a fifth Olympic Games. Thats pushing me. It cant be singles, youll have to be playing doubles to realise that dream. 

But by the time the 2008 Beijing Olympics come around, is there any guarantee that Mahesh will be in the scene? 

Beijing is a long way off, no one knows what will happen then. But if Mahesh isnt around, Ill try to play with Prakash. Hes a very good doubles player, he just has to play more regularly to get his ranking up.

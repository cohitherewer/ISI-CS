Memphis: American Justin Leonard extended his lead to eight strokes at the St Jude Classic in Memphis on Saturday, firing a flawless four-under 66 to move within sight of his second win of the season. 

It was the second bogey-free round at the TPC at Southwind for the former British Open champion, splitting four birdies between the front and back nine to sit on 17-under 193, eight shots clear of Heath Slocum going into Sundays final round. 

Meanwhile, Indias Arjun Atwal followed his second round 66 with a one-under 70 on Saturday to take his aggregate to a three-under 207. 

He had three birdies ? on the first, second and 16th holes ? but negated them with three consecutive bogeys ? on the 5th, 6th and 7th. 

He is now in 16th place along with six others. He finished Day II in joint 14th place. 

After an opening round eight-under 62, Leonard has remained atop the leaderboard. He started the day with a five-shot lead and never took his foot off the gas, having carded just one bogey all week. 

The 54-hole lead is the biggest on the PGA Tour this season, bettering by one stroke Kenny Perrys seven shots going into Sunday at last weeks Colonial and Phil Mickelsons advantage at Pebble Beach. 

If Leonard, a winner earlier this year at the Bob Hope Classic, can hold on to his lead he will join world no. 1 Vijai Singh, Tiger Woods, Mickelson and Perry as the only winners of two or more PGA Tour events this season. 

Scrambling to close ground on Leonard, Slocum had a rollercoaster afternoon as he mixed six birdies with three bogeys for a three-under 67 to sit in second on nine-under 201. 

Tom Pernice Jr had a two-under 68 and is one shot further adrift at eight-under 202 followed by Fred Funk (66), Davis Love III (68) and Paul Goydos (70) all on 203. 

Two-time defending champion David Toms fired a third round five-under 65 to rocket up the leaderboard into a tie for seventh at six-under 204. 

American Bob Estes, the 2001 St Jude winner and runner-up last year, Britains Phillip Price and Swedes Fredrik Jacobson and Richard S. Johnson are also 11 shots off the pace on 204. (Agencies)

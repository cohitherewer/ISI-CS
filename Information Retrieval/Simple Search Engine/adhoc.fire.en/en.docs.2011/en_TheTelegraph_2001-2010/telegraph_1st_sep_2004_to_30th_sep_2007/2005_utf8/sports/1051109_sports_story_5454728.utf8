Calcutta: The dictum where there is a will there is a way is relevant for Priyanka Saha and Srikanta Biswas, who won the nursery cadet girls and boys title in the 71st State and Inter District Table Tennis Championship at the Khudiram Anushilan Kendra on Monday. 

Both Priyanka and Srikanta hail from a poor background, coming from Naihati. Priyankas father is a vegetable vendor, while Srikantas father is a train hawker. 

However, poverty did not deter them from achieving top honours in the game, which has become a mission in their life. Although getting two square meals is hard for them, the urge for the game overcomes all that barrier. 

Their coaches ? Amit Mukherjee and Sumit Mukherjee ? who run a coaching camp in Bijoynagar Athletics Club in Naihati, spotted them two years back. 

We had decided to hold a table tennis camp where we spotted Priyanka, and I was pretty sure that she can do really well. 

It was the same for Srikanta as well. He is a talented player, and better grooming will enable him to be one of the top players in the country, said Sumit. 

Amit and Sumit bear all their expenses. In fact, Amit ? who is also playing in the state meet ? is the role model for both the youngsters. 

However, as days pass by, it is becoming more and more difficult for them to sustain them. 

It is really becoming hard for us to bear all the expenses. We are trying to get sponsors, but till now we have been hopeless. But we still believe, that some day, our voices will be heard, and we will have another Arup and Mouma, added Sumit. 

Meanwhile, Priyanka and Srikanta, who study in standard IV in the same school ? Bijoynagar Nimna Buniyadi Vidyalaya ? will continue nurturing their dreams.

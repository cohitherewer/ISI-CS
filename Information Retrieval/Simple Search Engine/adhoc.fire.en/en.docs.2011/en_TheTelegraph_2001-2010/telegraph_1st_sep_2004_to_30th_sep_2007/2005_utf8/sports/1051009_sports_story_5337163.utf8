 Pride at stake for World XI

 - SUPER SERIES Pietersen, Katich doubtful; McGrath set to return 

Melbourne: With their reputation in tatters, World XI will be desperate to salvage some pride when they take on world champions Australia in an inconsequential match of the Super Series here Sunday. 

Having lost the inaugural three-match series 2-0, it is a moment of reckoning for World XI which comprises some of the biggest names in contemporary cricket including Indias Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid. 

More than the defeat in the two matches, it is the manner in which the worlds stars capitulated, that is raising doubts on whether the entire concept of pitting a string of stars against the top ranked team should be persisted with. 

While Australia have used the opportunity to spring back from the Ashes debacle, the world team appears to be short on motivation and struggling to play as a unit. 

Players like Brian Lara and Jacques Kallis, super stars in their own right, have hugely disappointed as also the Indian duo of Sehwag and Dravid. 

Despite the grim scenario in which his team finds itself in, World XI coach John Wright sought to put up a brave face saying there was too much pride at stake for his players to treat the match as a dead rubber. 

The players are obviously disappointed. But they are seeing the (match tomorrow) as another opportunity to turn the tables, he said. 

Wright also sought to defend the concept and said, I think the concept is very good. It does give a platform for something a bit unique and a bit different, providing it is not overdone. 

However, the immediate concern of the coach must be the injury to Kevin Pietersen. The England star has a minor strain in his right hamstring and is doubtful for Sunday. 

Pietersen had a scan on his leg on Saturday after the 25-year-old pulled up sharply and clutched his leg when fielding at long-on in the second match on Friday. 

He had a scan today (Saturday) and has a minor strain, Wright told reporters. Hell be reassessed tomorrow (as to whether he can play the final match). 

Pietersen batted with a runner, scoring 16 in the World XIs 273 all out chasing Australias 328 on Friday. 

Australia also have an injury concern relating to Matthew Haydens replacement Simon Katich, who has returned the faith of the selectors with scores of 58 and 47. Katich has been diagnosed with groin strain and his condition is being monitored. 

Pace spearhead Glenn McGrath, who was rested Friday, is set to return to the team. McGraths replacement Stuart Clark, however, made the most of the chance, grabbing two wickets to announce his arrival on the international stage. 

While the Australians thrived in all departments, the performance of World XI was mediocre, be it batting, bowling or fielding, a fact reflected in the lop-sided results of the two matches. 

Pollock had admitted after the match Friday that his team failed to play together as a team and it remains to be seen whether he can help the players gel as a unit. (Agencies)

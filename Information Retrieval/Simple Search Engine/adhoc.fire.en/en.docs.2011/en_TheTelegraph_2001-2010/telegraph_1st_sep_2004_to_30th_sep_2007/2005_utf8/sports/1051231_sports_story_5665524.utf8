 Sania stands alone in Indian history

 In the history of Indian tennis, 

 2005 will be remembered as Sania Mirzas year. No other 

 Indian, not even the great Ramanathan Krishnan, Vijay Amritraj 

 or Leander Paes, made such a telling impact at the national 

 or international level in one single year. Though Sanias 

 achievement levels fall far short of what many of our sporting 

 greats have done, she stands alone in Indian sporting history. 

 The perfectly timed fusion of many factors brought about 

 an iconic stature much beyond Sanias performance. 

 Her image was enhanced by attractive looks and aggressive 

 attitude. The belligerent slogans on her T-shirt, her mini 

 skirts and the press conferences took the West by storm. 

 She was visualised as a pioneer who broke the conservative 

 mould of Eastern women.

 Fatwas were issued condemning 

 her skimpy skirts. BBC debates with Mullahs and other relevant 

 respected members of society escalated the issue. Through 

 all this turbulence, Sania tackled the issues with maturity 

 beyond her age and with rare aplomb.

 At the same time, there happened 

 to be a vacuum in the female sporting star slot. Here was 

 a new sporting star who could respond intelligently to questions 

 with sparkling eyes and not use the tired old clich?s one 

 hears day in and day out from the top stars. The response 

 in an India, hurtling forward on the crest of an economic 

 wave, was unprecedented.

 Outriders escorted Sania to meet 

 the Governor. The chief minister allocated money and other 

 goodies, while sponsors dug deep into their pockets to rope 

 her in for endorsements. There was much envy as the crores 

 rolled into Sania coffers.

 Another important content in these 

 very extraordinary happenings was the fact that Sania performed 

 at her best in three of the four Grand Slams. Watched worldwide, 

 she traded shots with three women who have been in the worlds 

 top-ten. Though she lost, she was fearless and gave as good 

 as she got, and won respect for her stout fighting qualities.

 Sania richly deserves the accolades 

 and rewards. She has projected to the world a new image 

 of Indian women and inspired Indian girls in all walks of 

 life.

 Looking at 2006 from the high 

 pedestal she has built for herself, Sania now has a formidable 

 task. She has to find the time to work hard on her weaknesses, 

 improve her physical fitness and strength, and, at the same 

 time, keep her tournament participation at the same level. 

 All this has to be synchronised to perfection and the higher 

 workload achieved without injury. It is like trying to juggle 

 with your feet.

 The current organisational structure 

 of the womens tour has been described as having a 

 damaging short-term prospective and extracting 

 maximum gain in a minimum time, by a Harvard study. 

 In fact, it has devastated the game and it is difficult 

 to find an injury-free player in the top-20 among women.

 Staying injury-free should be 

 the most important objective in Sanias programme. 

 Learning to play the computer and trying to pick up easy 

 points from tournaments with weak entries in remote places 

 is another must. 

 Years ago, after Leander had won 

 the junior Wimbledon event, I was surprised to see the runner-up 

 Marcos Ondruska with a much higher ranking and getting direct 

 entries to major tournaments while Leander was struggling 

 in the qualifying rounds. Ondruska had collected points 

 by shrewd participation in the weaker tournaments with surfaces 

 which were best for his game.

 These are some of the things that 

 Sania needs to do. Many more difficulties have to be tackled. 

 Getting to the top is like trying to walk up an escalator 

 moving down. You cannot stand still or even walk up ? you 

 have to run up.

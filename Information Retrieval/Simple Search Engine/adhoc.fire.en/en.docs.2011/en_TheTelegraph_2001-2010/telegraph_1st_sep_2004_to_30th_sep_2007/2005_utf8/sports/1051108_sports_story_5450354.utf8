 Langeveldt, coach fined 

Durban: Fast bowler Charl Langeveldt was fined 75 per cent of the match fee for breaching the ICC Code of conduct during the fifth and final one-day International against New Zealand in Centurion on Sunday. 

Coach Mickey Arthur was also found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct and fined 25 percent of his match fee. 

Cricket South Africa said in a statement that the punishments were handed out to them after separate hearings conducted by ICC Match Referee Chris Broad. 

Langeveldt was found to have breached Level 2.1 in which he celebrated a dismissal before a decision was given by the umpire. It was Langeveldts repeat of Level 1 offence within a twelve-month period. 

Arthur was fined for swearing at the umpire. He was unhappy when a second interruption for rain came after 19 overs of South Africas innings, one over short of the 20 required to constitute an innings. South Africa, who went on to win by five wickets, were well ahead of the Duckworth-Lewis victory target at the time. 

A Cricket South Africa media release said Arthur was found to have breached the ICC Code of Conduct by confronting an umpire as he was coming off the field. 

It was out of character, his first offence, but swearing at an umpire should not be tolerated, the release quoted Match Referee Chris Broad as saying. 

Arthur has apologised for his actions and I hope that we will not see this unsavoury incident repeated. 

New Zealands Scott Styris was also found guilty of swearing at an umpires decision and fined 25 per cent of his match fee. (AGENCIES)

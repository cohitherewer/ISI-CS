The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Practice sessions in Barcelona

 - I?ll be happy if Jordan can improve to eighth, says Narain 

Mumbai: Narain Karthikeyan is all set to become the first Indian to race in the Formula One. 

Karthikeyan?s immediate aim is to push Jordan one place further in the team standings in the annual championship. 

?Obviously, I don?t expect team Jordan to win the championship. I will be happy if we could finish eighth as they had finished ninth last year,? Karthikeyan said. 

Elaborating on his immediate plans, he said: ?I will be going to Silverstone in a couple of days to get my special licence where I will have to drive between 300 to 350 kms in front of the FIA representatives. 

?I will be moving my camp to Barcelona to test-drive and also for practice races before the Melbourne meet on March 6,? he added. 

?It was during my Nissan World Series Championship that I gained much-needed confidence after doing quite well against champion drivers like Sato and Jensen Button.? 

Karthikeyan?s chances of entering the F1 circuit received a boost when Midland group, owned by Russia-born Canadian business tycoon Alexander Schnaider, acquired Jordan last month. The team?s new sporting director was Trevor Carlin who had seen Karthikeyan race in Formula 3. 

?Obviously Carlin was very impressed with my driving as he has been following my progress since I was racing in Formula 3,? the fastest Indian on wheels said. 

?Carlin knows my potential and realistically speaking I and my sponsors like Tata, JK Tyres, Speed and Red Bull were waiting for the right opportunity? I think the right time has come for me to take the plunge,? he added. 

?Lot of hard work has gone into my dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver and I am happy that Jordan has offered their number one driver spot,? said Karthikeyan who had previously test driven for Jordan, Jaguar and Minardi. 

In fact, he was offered to drive for Minardi in 2003 but missed out as he was unable to raise the huge sum required to secure the offer. ?There have been ups and downs but when I sit back and think about it, I should say it was worth every effort as I never imagined that my dream of driving in F1 would be realised so soon,? the Chennai lad said.

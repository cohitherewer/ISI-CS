 Bagan?s SoS to psychiatrist 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: When it seems there?s no stopping Mohun Bagan?s free fall from a title-aspirant to a struggling outfit, the club officials have sent an SoS to a psychiatrist ? a move aimed at boosting the players? morale during the rest of the National Football League (NFL). 

This clearly puts the glamorous team in desperation of getting out of their sagging fortunes ? Friday?s defeat to Vasco, another NFL-strugglers, just adding fuel to such demand. 

?We are exploring various options to get the team back on track. The league is still a long way to go and we are hopeful of a turnaround today or tomorrow,? said a club official on Saturday. 

The city-based psychiatrist is slated to interact with the green-and-maroon players during morning practice at the club ground on Sunday. 

It may be recalled that Mohun Bagan had sought a psychiatrist?s help last year too. But whether such move will help form a rejuvenated team, remains to be seen. 

For coach Subrata Bhattacharya, though, a change in fortune is ?definitely? around the corner. 

?It?s a fact that nothing is going our way. This lean patch is quite common, and I?m sure the boys will overcome it soon enough to put up a fight in the remainder of the League,? he told reporters after a practice session on Saturday. 

The former India defender, however, asserted that he would not shirk responsibility by quitting. ?If I quit now, everybody will dub me an escapist. I?ll fight with this very squad. They had put the team in three major tournament?s finals and they will again rise to the occasion in the NFL,? he remarked. 

Subrata, however, admitted part of the problem was in the players? mind and believed the more the team plays outside the city, the better. 

?I feel the pressure of playing at home is getting on the players? nerves? They are not quite at the job with a sound mental framework. This is why, I want to play more away from here, because in that case, the supporters? pressure will not be of much consequence there,? he maintained. 

The club, in recent moves, has approached two of the veteran true-blues ? Compton Dutta and Pradeep Chowdhury ? to be part of the team management, in a bid to boost the morale of Ashim Biswas amp; Co. 

As if this was not enough, a host of other club loyalists, including some of the former internationals, may also be asked to help the team out, in one way or other. 

Mohun Bagan will host Salgaocar and Tollygunge on Wednesday and Saturday, respectively.

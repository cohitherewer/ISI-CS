 Moitra to assist King for third ODI

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Bengal trainer Ranadeep Moitra has been asked to assist Team India trainer Gregory King for the third ODI between India and Pakistan to be played in Jamshedpur on Saturday. The trainer received a letter from the BCCI a few days back saying that he would have to reach Jamshedpur by Thursday. 

In a recent development, the board has decided to send an additional trainer as well as a masseur to all the venues within the country. ?So we have decided to send Moitra to Jamshedpur to accompany Team India,? a BCCI official told The Telegraph this evening. 

Meanwhile, Moitra will also compete in the Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist?s examination to be held in England in July. The Bengal trainer has also trained the India A side in the past.

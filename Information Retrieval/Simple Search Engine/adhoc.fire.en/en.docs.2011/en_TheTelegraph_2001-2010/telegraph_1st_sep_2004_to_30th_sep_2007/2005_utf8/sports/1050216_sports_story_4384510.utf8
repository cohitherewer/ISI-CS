The Telegraph - Calcutta

 CM?s 50-50 session with Steve 

 - Buddhadeb?s favourite bowler and more? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

made it fifty-fifty: He animatedly discussed cricket for 15 of his 30 minutes 

with Steve Waugh; the remaining time was devoted to business. 

?Oh, he?s a big cricket enthusiast? The chief minister 

had questions about leadership, the forthcoming Indo-Pak series? Then, he informed 

Glenn McGrath is his favourite bowler,? Steve told The Telegraph. 

The legend and his entourage (manager Robert Joske and two top bankers, William Moss and Tony Fehon, from Macquaire) met Bhattacharjee over ?excellent tea? and biscuits on Tuesday afternoon. 

Speaking in the evening, shortly before his departure for home (via Singapore) after seven days in the city, Steve added: ?The chief minister, in fact, came across as a nice guy? Very relaxed and helpful?? 

Asked whether Bhattacharjee named his favourite batsman as well, Steve quipped: ?He didn?t? However, I guess it?s Sourav Ganguly. He is everybody?s favourite in Bengal, is it not?? 

Steve didn?t reveal much about his response to the leadership question (?that?s for select audiences, mate?) but was forthcoming over what he said on the soon-to-begin series. 

?Consistency is going to be the key? India start favourites, but the team with fewer bad sessions will win? We (Australia) have been doing so well because we have so few bad sessions,? Steve pointed out. 

Given that this trip ? the India-leg began in Mumbai ten days ago ? was driven by ?studying business opportunities,? what were his thoughts at the end of a visit with a distinct difference? 

?I don?t know where this is going to take me, but I?ve been enjoying the learning process? Of course, the odd ball has been going through to the wicketkeeper! Hopefully, though, some concepts will turn into reality after two-three months,? he signed off. 

Meanwhile, Steve?s facility for the visually impaired girls (in Nepalgunj) gets underway ?pretty soon.? As he is going to be back after ?two-three months,? the launch could be on hold till then. 

Apparently, the facility will be midway between a 

school and a home.

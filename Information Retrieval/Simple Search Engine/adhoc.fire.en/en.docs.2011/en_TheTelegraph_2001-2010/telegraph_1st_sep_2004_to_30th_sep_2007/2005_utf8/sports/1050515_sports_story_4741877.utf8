 New Delhi: The Indian hockey team suffered a jolt ahead of the Sultan Azlan Shah meet when defender Viren Rasquinha was ruled out with a broken finger. Rasquinha broke his left finger during training Friday and has been advised three weeks rest, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) sources said here Saturday.

 IHF would prune the 35-member probables? list to 18 before shifting the camp to Hyderabad where the players would undergo training along with juniors who were preparing at the Gachhibowli Stadium for the upcoming World Cup. The seniors on Saturday underwent their final training session in the national stadium here.

 Beijing: Chinese world record hurdler Liu Xiang will auction off the shoes he wore during his Athens Olympics gold medal-winning performance with bids expected to start at $1.2 million, state press reported Saturday. Liu?s track shoes, which he wore in Athens when tying the 12.91 second 110m world record, will be auctioned off in a charity event organised by the Shanghai Sports Bureau, the non-profit Shanghai Hope Project and the Shanghai Benevolent Fund, Xinhua reported. Independent buyers have already offered 13 million yuan for the red, gold and white ?Zoom Super Fly G5? shoes, it said. The sale of the shoes would be restricted to China as they were considered a national treasure, the report said.

 Bangalore: All is set for the inaugural Bangalore International Marathon to be held on Sunday. The celebration run of seven km is expected to attract more attention than the full marathon (42.195 km) and half marathon (21.097 km). Prakash Padukone, Prasad Bidappa, Vasundhara Das, Hirish Bijoor, Mahesh Dattani, Syed Kirmani, Javagal Srinath, Ashish Ballal and Nindini Alva are among the expected participants in the celebration run. 

 Foreign participation has been below expectations. Only six Ethiopians ? Tesfaye Bayu Orgawa, Tegayae Desalgne, Abebe Seume, Korre Alemu, Marashet Jimma and Adanech Beyene are in the fray. Organisers are expecting a turn out of up to 15,000.

 Tokyo: Under-fire Olympique Marseille coach Philippe Troussier has said he wants the Japan job back at the 2006 World Cup, a Japanese newspaper reported on Saturday. Troussier?s future at Marseille is in doubt following a string of poor results and the Frenchman expressed interest in returning to Japan, if they qualify for next year?s World Cup.

 ?I want to coach Japan if they qualify for the 2006 World Cup,? Troussier, who coached Japan from 1998 to 2002, was quoted by the newspaper as saying.

 Troussier criticised the methods of current Japan coach Zico. ?Zico doesn?t use young players. His style is too regimented,? he said. ?He should let the players play with greater freedom.? Troussier took Japan to the Asian Cup title in 2000, the final of the 2001 Confederations Cup and the second round of the 2002 World Cup, which Japan co-hosted with South Korea.

 London: Kevin Pietersen hit his first century for Hampshire on Friday, boosting his hopes of selection for England?s first Test against Bangladesh at Lord?s later this month. The South African-born batsman struck 125 off 111 balls to help his new side pile up 461 for nine declared on the third day of the county championship first division match against Kent at Canterbury.

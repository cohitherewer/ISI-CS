 Chanderpaul lifts West Indies

Port-of-Spain: Shivnarine Chanderpaul propped up a lacklustre West Indies innings in the fourth one-day International against South Africa on Saturday. 

Chanderpaul top scored with 85 not out to anchor West Indies total of 231 for eight, which they scored after losing the toss and being put in to bat. 

South Africa claimed the five-match series 3-0 when they won the third game by one run in Barbados on Wednesday. 

The futility of Saturdays dead rubber was writ large on the West Indians approach. 

Chanderpauls discipline, which saw him face 103 balls and hit five fours, was the exception. 

Support for the West Indies captain was largely fleeting, and the biggest stand of the innings was the 50 shared by Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan for the fourth wicket. 

Sarwan scored 48 before lifting a leg-side delivery from fast bowler Jacques Kallis to Andrew Hall at fine leg in the 29th over. 

Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini removed openers Chris Gayle and Xavier Marshall for three runs each before Brian Lara helped Sarwan add 45 for the third wicket. 

Lara was dismissed for 22 in the 17th over when his lofted drive off fast bowler Andre Nel was well held in the covers by Ashwell Prince, who had his back to the batsman when he took the catch. 

Sarwans dismissal was followed by a stand of 49 between Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo, who scored a bright 28 before edging a drive off Ntini to be caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 

Dwayne Smith, Courtney Browne and Ian Bradshaw were all dismissed cheaply as the innings unravelled. 

Ntini took three for 34 from eight overs.

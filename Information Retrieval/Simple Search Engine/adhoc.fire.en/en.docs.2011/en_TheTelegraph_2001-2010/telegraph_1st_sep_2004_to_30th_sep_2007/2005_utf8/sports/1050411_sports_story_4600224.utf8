 Unwell Shoaib?s chances recede

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar?s chances of joining the team in India appear remote after he missed a domestic limited-overs match with illness. 

The controversial quick, who has missed competitive games since early January, was expected to play in Lahore on Sunday for Khan Research Laboratory against National Bank of Pakistan, a game that was to be watched by chairman of selectors Wasim Bari. 

?Shoaib is sick and didn?t play the match. He has to first regain match fitness before we may consider him for selection,? Bari said from Lahore. 

Shoaib, on Wednesday, took four for 22 in seven overs and later reiterated that he was fit to join the team in India, adding that the final decision of his selection would be taken by his trainer Grant Compton and selectors. 

Shoaib and Shabbir Ahmed were expected to join the team for the Kanpur and New Delhi one-dayers, scheduled for April 15 and 17. 

Shabbir, who has not played any international cricket since August last year, was last week ruled out of the tour as he lacked match fitness. 

?The team management has also not asked for any replacements. If there is no request from India, I don?t think we will send anyone,? Bari said. 

Bari replied in the positive when asked if he was hoping that the duo would be fit for June?s tour of the West Indies. 

?I am hoping that the two fast bowlers will regain fitness for the tour.? 

Pakistan will tour the West Indies between May 11 and June 7, during which it will play one-dayers at St Vincent (May 18) and St Lucia (May 21 and 22) and Tests at Barbados (May 26 to 30) and Jamaica (June 3 to 7).

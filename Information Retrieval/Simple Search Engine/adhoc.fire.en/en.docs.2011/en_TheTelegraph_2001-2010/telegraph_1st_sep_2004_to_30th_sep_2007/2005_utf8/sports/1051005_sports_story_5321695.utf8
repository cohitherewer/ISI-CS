 India earn 

World Cup 

direct entry 

 Randhawa and Atwal 

New Delhi: Indian golf received a major boost as it qualified for the World Cup directly for the first time. 

Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal, both former Asian number ones, created history by earning a direct spot for India in the World Cup, which is part of the World Golf Championship series. 

The $ 4 million event featuring two-man teams from 24 nations around the world will be held from November 15-20 at Victoria Clube de Golfe-Vilamoura in the Algarve region of Portugal. 

India were originally slated to take part in the qualifiers with Amandeep Johl and Arjun Singh as the representatives. 

However on September 19, the last date for direct qualifiers to be decided, Randhawa figured among the top-18 available players by nationalities. The highest ranked player is then allowed to choose his partner. Randhawa and Atwal have confirmed their participation. 

In the past India has qualified for World Cup by winning one of the qualifying spots in the Nations Cup. The last time was in 2003, when Gaurav Ghei and Digvijay Singh made it to the World Cup in Kiawah Island. 

For both Randhawa and Atwal, the World Cup will be a big feather in their cap, as neither have played in it before. By the time the year ends, Randhawa, the Asian Tour No. 1 in 2002, would have played in three of the World Golf Championship events. 

He has already played the WGC-NEC invitational and is due to play the WGC-Amex invitational, too. And now comes the World Cup call. 

Atwal, who is within hand-shaking distance of reaching the million-dollar mark on US Tour has booked his 2006 PGA Tour card, played the PGA championships, the fourth major in world golf, and has four top-10 finishes on US Tour this year. 

The winning team gets $1.4 million to be split between the two players, while the 24th and last placed team gets to split $40,000. 

The host country, Portugal, along with 18 exempt nations have booked their entries into the championships, while five more will join them.

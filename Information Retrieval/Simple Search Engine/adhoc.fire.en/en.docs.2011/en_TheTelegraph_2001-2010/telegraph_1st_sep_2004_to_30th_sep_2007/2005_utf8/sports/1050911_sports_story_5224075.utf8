 Pole for Montoya 

Spa-Francorchamps: Spaniard Fernando Alonso suffered a setback in his bid to become Formula Ones youngest champion in Belgium after qualifying behind McLaren rival Kimi Raikkonen. 

The 24-year-old Renault driver, who will win the title if he beats Raikkonen by four points, took fourth place after McLaren swept the front row of the grid. 

Indias Narain Karthikeyan, driving Jordans new car, finished last this time in 1:51.675, one behind teammate Tiago Monteiro, who clocked 1:51.498. 

In Saturdays second free practice, Narain finished 19th in the first session clocking 1:53.480. The second session saw him faring no better, with a last-place finish in 1:51.594. 

Raikkonen, second fastest and immediately in front of Alonso on the starting grid, was 0.049 slower than Colombian teammate Juan Pablo Montoya who starts on pole position for the second race in succession. 

It was the Mercedes-powered teams first front row one-two since the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola in 2001 and a significant boost in their battle for the constructors championship with Renault. 

 Renault lead McLaren by eight 

 points. Raikkonen can expect Montoya, now with 13 career 

 pole positions, to help him score maximum points, while 

 Alonso must muscle past Jarno Trullis third-placed 

 Toyota. (AGENCIES)

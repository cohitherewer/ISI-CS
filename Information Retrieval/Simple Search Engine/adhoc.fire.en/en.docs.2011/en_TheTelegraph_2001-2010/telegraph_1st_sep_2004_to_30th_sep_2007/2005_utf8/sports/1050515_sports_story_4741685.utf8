 After 142 cuts, a weekend without Tiger

 - I couldnt quite find what I needed to make the right swing

With only a golf hole between them, Tiger Woods and his caddie, Steve Williams, paced the final green at the Cottonwood Valley Course on Friday, inspecting the blades of grass, trying to decode one last riddle in the sun. 

Outside right edge, Williams said above the silence, and Woods was soon standing over his ball for a 15-foot putt for par to extend one of the records he cherishes most. Woods struck the ball and awaited its verdict. It rolled on a line but strayed to the right of the hole, ending his streak of consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour at 142. 

Im not going to make it, Woods said after crunching the numbers from a second-round two-over-par 72 on Friday to finish the Byron Nelson Championship at one-over-par 141. The cut fell at 140. 

Woods streak dated to the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February1998, when he withdrew after shooting four over par for two rounds of an event that was shortened to 54 holes and postponed until August. Before Friday, Woods only other missed cut was at the 1997 Canadian Open. 

He had constructed a streak so sturdy that no end seemed in sight. It had come to personify his dominance on the PGA Tour as much as any other achievement. Eight of his nine major championships came during his run. Last month, he won the Masters. 

But in wind gusts of up to 30 mph, Woods swing betrayed him on a course he knows well. He hit only four of 14 fairways and said he would soon be on an airplane back to Orlando, where a session at the gym and the driving range awaited him. 

I couldnt quite find what I needed to make the right golf swing, said Woods, who shot a first-round 69. I tried to bandage my way to the finish. 

Woods short week came in a tournament he won in 1997 and with a host, Byron Nelson, who held the record of consecutive cuts made at 113 until Woods passed him in 2003. As Woods tacked onto the record, some compared it to Joe DiMaggios 56-game hitting streak in 1941. 

Woods scrambled to make the cut several times during his run, including at the 2003 Masters when he got up-and-down from a greenside bunker and made the cut on the number. In March, at the Players Championship, he finished 36 holes at one-over-par to make the cut by a shot. 

This is more intestinal fortitude than anything else, Woods said. Days when you just dont have it, you dont mail it in. Give it everything youve got. You somehow try to find a way to get it done. Youve seen me do it over the years. I should have missed many cuts by now. You just somehow figure out a way. 

Woods said his problems began during his morning session on the driving range, when his swing did not feel right. As his round wore on, Woods said he knew he needed to get to the clubhouse at even par or better, but bogeys kept cropping up. He had four bogeys in the round. 

He made one on No. 13, three-putting from 20 feet, and another on No.15, when he could not get up-and-down from a bunker. After reaching the par-5 No. 16 in two and two-putting for birdie, Woods needed two pars to make it to the weekend rounds. 

He got one on No. 17, a par 3, and laced an iron down the middle of the fairway on No. 18, a par 4. When the wind kicked up, Woods backed off his ball before hitting his 7-iron approach into a bunker left of the green. 

With the green sloping away from him, he blasted out to 15 feet, setting up his final shot at par, one he narrowly missed. He removed his cap, shook hands with Sutherland and Peter Lonard and walked through a throng to add up the numbers on his scorecard. 

Its been a nice, what, seven years? said Woods. Thats not too bad.

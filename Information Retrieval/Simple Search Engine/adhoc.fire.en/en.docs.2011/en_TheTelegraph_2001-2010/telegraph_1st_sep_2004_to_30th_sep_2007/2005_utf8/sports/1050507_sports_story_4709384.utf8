 BAR not to appeal ban

Barcelona: BAR will not launch a legal challenge to its two-race ban by Formula Ones ruling body, imposed for breaking weight and fuel regulations. 

The team, backed by British American Tobacco and Honda, will now definitely miss Sundays Spanish Grand Prix and the Monaco race on May 22. 

?Upon receiving the best legal advice, in all relevant jurisdictions, the conclusion is that nothing can be done to enable the team to race this weekend,? BAR said in a statement on Friday. 

?BAR Honda has considered whether to pursue further action which might enable it to compete at Monaco. 

?On balance, the team has decided that to challenge the sports governing body (FIA) would cause a level of disruption and damage to the sport which would not serve the best interests for everyone involved.? 

BAR have also been excluded retroactively from the San Marino Grand Prix. Briton Jenson Button had finished third and his Japanese team mate Takuma Sato fifth at Imola last month. 

A motor racing appeal court, dealing with a complaint by the sports ruling body, said the only way the BAR car could have achieved minimum weight requirements in Imola was by using fuel as a ballast which was against regulations. 

The courts finding on Thursday spoke of a ?special compartment within the fuel tank?. Its contents allowed the car to reach minimum weight requirements. 

On Thursday the British-based team said they were appalled by the decision, were considering their legal options and still hoped to race this weekend in Barcelona. 

Meanwhile, BAR said their two-race suspension could cost them more than $10 million. ?This is going to cost a huge amount of money,? team boss Nick Fry said on Friday, after announcing that the team would not pursue legal action. ?I havent sat down and calculated what it is at the moment but in terms of contractual obligations that well have to meet I could confidently say this is going to add up to more than $10 million I would imagine. 

?Weve made things more difficult for ourselves, no doubt,? said Fry. ?But we want Jenson for 2006 and beyond.? 

Both drivers turned up on Friday, ready to take part in practice should the team give them the nod. It never came.. 

?We remain insistent that weve done nothing wrong, we still think that the penalty is excessive but the lawyers are telling us that the issue of jurisdiction is a very difficult one. 

?We cant find a court that is willing to say yes, its our responsibility. The case seems very sound, the only possibility looked like it would be in France (where the FIA are based) but that cant be done in time.?

Bangkok: Roger Federer recovered his poise on Thursday, beating Germanys Denis Gremelmayr 6-3, 6-2 to ease through to the quarter finals of the Thailand Open. 

The Swiss world No. 1 has now w-on 74 matches this year, mat-ching Spaniard Rafael Nadal, and looked far more comfortable than in his opening match. 

Federers frustration boiled over on Wednesday as he struggled to overcome Brazilian Marcos Daniel and he threw an uncharacteristic temper tantrum by slamming his racket to the ground. 

The fluid strokes and aggressive shot making were back in abundance against Gremelmayr, after Federer held off three break points in the opening game and then broke the left-hander for 2-0. 

Although he was never seriously threatened, Federer faced some tense moments as Gremelmayr settled and held a point to break back at 4-2. 

Federer escaped when Gremelmayr netted a forehand, and after sealing the first set he broke to love to start the second. 

Briton Andy Murray, meanwhile, realised his ambition of a place in the world top 100 by beating Swedish fifth seed Robin Soderling 7-6, 7-6. 

The 18-year-old Scot, who was ranked 411th at the end of last season, demonstrated impressive speed around the court to reach his first ATP quarter final. 

Murrays next opponent is third seed Robby Ginepri. 

Paes-Hanley up 

Meanwhile, top seeds Leander Paes and Australian Paul Hanley advanced to the doubles second round with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Yves Allegro (Switzerland) and Graydon Oliver (US) on Thursday. 

Paes and Hanley will next meet Thai pair Paradorn Srichaphan and Danai Udomchoke.

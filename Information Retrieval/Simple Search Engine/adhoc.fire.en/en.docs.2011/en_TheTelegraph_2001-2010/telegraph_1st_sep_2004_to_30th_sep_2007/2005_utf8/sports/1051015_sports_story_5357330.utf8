 Kapil welcomes Dravid appointment

Bangalore: Kapil Dev has welcomed Rahul Dravids appointment as Team India captain for the ODI series versus Sri Lanka and South Africa. I am happy and delighted. I only wanted that he should not be appointed for a short span, said Kapil, adding that he felt Dravid can deliver. 

Kapil suggested the BCCI groom a 30-member party ahead of the World Cup and added those who are fit will play and others who lack fitness will have to go. 

Kapil declined to react whether the row between Indias coach Greg Chappell and Sourav Ganguly cost the latter his captaincy and termed the episode as unfortunate. 

Former Pakistan skipper Zaheer Abbas, also lauded the decision to name Dravid captain for two important series. ((PTI)

 Narain ?relaxed? before race day

Sepang: India?s first Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyan Saturday said he did not feel much pressure to perform and was relaxed coming into the second leg of the F1 Grand Prix in Malaysia. 

?I do not feel as much under pressure in Sepang than in Melbourne. There was a lot of expectation from me, to perform in the first ever race, the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. Now that has passed. I feel more relaxed coming into this Malaysian race,? Karthikeyan said after finishing 17th in the first qualifying here Saturday. 

The 28-year-old Jordan driver said he drove as was the requirement of the difficult Sepang circuit and the changed rules regarding usage of tyres was on his mind. 

?I finished 17th with 1:37.806 for the qualifying session because I drove quite a conservative lap as we are trying to save the Bridgestone tyres for Sunday as much as possible. 

?It is important as the heat here is hard on the tyres during the race. Overall, the tyres were working pretty well this afternoon and that helped of course the performance of the car.? 

[A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Later in the day, though, a video conference arranged by VSNL, a group company of Karthikeyan?s sponsors Tata Motors, was called off because ?Karthikeyan was dehydrated, was resting, and did not want to take any risk the day before the race,? as a spokesman of the company put it.] 

The final grid position will be decided after the second qualifying Sunday morning (after an aggregate timing) before the start of the final race later in the afternoon. 

?I had a hot second morning to prepare the qualifying session. I did experience a lot of oversteer with the car that caused my car to be more on the outside of the course than I would have wished to. I lost a couple of tenths of a second in the middle section turns of the lap,? Karthikeyan said. 

?Overall the balance was fine, but we just weren?t fast enough. It was not the best lap I could have done on this circuit but it was okay in the end and I am ahead of my teammate.? 

Karthikeyan and his teammate Tiago Monteiro were reasonably satisfied with their provisional qualifying laps and looking forward to the race, despite the fact that hotter temperatures were expected for Sunday. 

Karthikeyan said he knew that the Malaysian Grand Prix would be hot, but did not expect such high temperatures in Sepang. 

In the morning, the track temperatures went up to 41 degrees. 

?I hope that our cars will remain consistent in the race, so I am optimistic for a finish in Sunday afternoon?s race and I have an equal good feeling about Sunday?s qualifying.?

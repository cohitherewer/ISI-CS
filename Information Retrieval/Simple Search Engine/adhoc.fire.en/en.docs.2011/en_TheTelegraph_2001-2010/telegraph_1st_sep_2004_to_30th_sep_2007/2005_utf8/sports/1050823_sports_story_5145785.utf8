 No alteration in strategy: Greg

 - Team India coach not worried about change in captaincy 

 Greg Chappell at a press conference in Mumbai on Monday night

Mumbai: There will not be much change in plans following the change in captaincy, Chappell said here at the airport ahead of the teams departure for the month long tour of Zimbabwe. 

I dont see much of a difference in the strategy that will be followed even though there is a change at the helm, though Rahul (Dravid) did a good job in Sri Lanka and we know Souravs (Ganguly) record as captain, he said. 

On experimentations with the batting order, the coach said it depends upon the situation. 

If opportunities present themselves we can make experiments but otherwise no. We had a situation in Sri Lanka where Laxman was injured and opportunity arose to give people chances they have not done before, he said referring to M. S. Dhoni and Mohammed Kaif opening in two matches. 

According to Chappell, the players have to do the basic things right to improve the teams performance in one-day Internationals. 

There is no quick fix solution. Maybe take a step backwards in order to progress, chappell told reporters. 

Taking into account Indias poor performance in one-dayers Chappell said the teams dismal ranking in the ICC list is a true reflection of the form.

Rankings dont lie. On current records it is justified, he said. 

On the other hand, Sourav said the absence of players including Sachin Tendulkar has given the youngsters a great chance. 

The new boys have an opportunity in the absence of players including that of injured Sachin. I hope they will do well and we will settle into a right combination in the run-up to the next World Cup, he said. 

Definitely any team will miss a player of Sachins calibre. But I was not following his progress since I was away in England, he added. 

Meanwhile, physio John Golster said pacer Irfan Pathan has cleared the fitness test. 

Pathan got injured during the tri-series in Lanka and was forced to pull out of the Afro-Asian Cup. 

Two players Virender Sehwag and Ashish Nehra are not accompanying the team. The duo, who played in the Afro-Asian Cup, will join the team in Zimbabwe.

 Diva lifts Melbourne Cup 

 Melbourne: Makybe Diva, brilliantly ridden by Glen Boss, won the 145th Melbourne Cup on Tuesday to become the first horse to triumph three times in Australias greatest race. 

 The seven-year-old mare enhanced her reputation as one of the countrys greatest racehorses with a barnstorming finish in the gruelling $3.8 million 3,200-metre handicap at Flemington.

 After settling midfield, Makybe Diva burst to the front 200m from the line then sprint- ed clear to a thunderous ovat- ion from a crowd of 106,479 and a national audience of millions.

 What she did today was one of the greatest sporting events ever witnessed in Australia, said Makybes trainer, Lee Freedman. 

 Go and find the smallest child on this course and there will be the only example of a person who will live long enough to see that again.

 Boss, who also rode Makybe Diva to victory in 2003 and 2004, burst into tears after returning to the winners enclosure. 

 Shes immortal, said Boss, who broke his neck and was lucky not to have died after an horrific race fall in Macau in 2002. Shes just such a gutsy, determined mare. Im struggling for words.

 Makybe Divas owner, Croatian-born tuna fisherman Tony Santic, stunned the crowd by announcing he had decided to immediately retire the horse, allowing her to bow out on top.

 There is nothing left to prove, he said. What she has done for me and the people around me and for the people of Australia, its history and will never be forgotten.

 Makybe Diva went into Tuesdays race as clear favourite following one of the biggest betting plunges in Australian sporting history expected to top $150 million. She paid $3.60 to a $1 stake for winning.

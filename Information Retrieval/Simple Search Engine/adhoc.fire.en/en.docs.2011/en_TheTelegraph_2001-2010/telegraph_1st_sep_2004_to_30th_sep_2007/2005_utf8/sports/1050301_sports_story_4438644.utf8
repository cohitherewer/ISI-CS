 Toms cruises to biggest win

Carlsbad (California): David Toms cruised to the biggest victory in WGC-Accenture matchplay championship final history by beating Chris DiMarco six and five on Sunday. 

The win, worth $1.3 million, placed American Toms in the same class as Tiger Woods, who arrived at the La Costa Resort and Spa seeking an unprecedented third consecutive title before bowing out in the second round to Australian Nick O?Hern. 

In a dominating display never before seen at these championships, Toms needed just 31 of the scheduled 36 holes to seal his victory. 

The previous largest winning margin in a final was Briton Darren Clarke?s four and three win over Woods in 2000. 

?I?ve won a few tournaments along the way but I never felt that type of ease on a golf course,? said Toms, who had just four bogeys over 116 holes of play. ?I felt really great. 

?I don?t know how to explain it. I felt at peace all week. 

?This is a big deal. It?s the best players on a great golf course. 

?I can take a lot away from this and gain from it.? 

Runner-up to former world No. 1 Woods in 2003, Toms seized control during a brilliant morning round enjoying a blistering back nine to go six-up on his Ryder Cup teammate. 

Just as he did in Saturday?s semi-final against Britain?s Ian Poulter, Toms turned up the heat after the turn, scorching the final nine holes to break open what had been a tight contest. 

All square after nine, Toms shifted into top gear with birdies on five of the next six holes to surge in front five-up. 

Toms then watched as DiMarco collapsed under the relentless pressure and carded bogeys on 16 and 17 to add two more holes to his friend?s advantage. 

?We were all square at the turn and then he just went on a birdie barrage,? DiMarco said. 

?You?ve got to take your hat off to him, I think he was 20-under the last two days. ?That?s the worst beating I?ve ever taken for sure. 

In the consolation match played over one round, South Africa?s Retief Goosen defeated Poulter on the 20th hole to secure third place.

 Brand Beckham on wane

 - England captain to pen new deal with Real in early September 

 ASHLING CONNOR AND LEO LEWIS

 As one contract comes to an end 

 for David Beckham, another beckons for the England captain, 

 who is rarely between negotiations with sponsors or employers.

 After a pre-season tour to Asia, 

 training in Austria and an international friendly fixture 

 against Denmark, Beckham will sit down with Real Madrid 

 officials to discuss an extension to his contract.

 The meeting, which sources say 

 is pencilled in for early September, is likely 

 to take the edge off any inconvenience caused by having 

 to buy a new mobile phone.

 Vodafone, the network provider 

 that has used Beckhams face to sell its products around 

 the world for the past three years, confirmed on Tuesday 

 that its endorsement agreement with the player would not 

 be renewed by mutual consent.

 The contract, initially for two 

 years, had been extended for a further year and it suited 

 both sides to let it lapse.

 For Vodafones part, marketing 

 executives are thought to have been concerned about the 

 use of Beckhams image by Real to promote Siemens, 

 a rival company and the clubs shirt sponsor.

 Beckham was a Manchester United 

 player when he signed the deal and Vodafone decided it would 

 be better to focus on its relationship with United and its 

 ?9 million-a-season sponsorship deal with the club.

 The UK group also has separate 

 endorsement deals with Ruud van Nistelrooy and Cristiano 

 Ronaldo, the United players, whose profiles in their advertising 

 campaigns might be expected to rise.

 From Beckhams perspective, 

 he is looking for long-term sponsors of his soccer academies, 

 the first of which opens in Los Angeles this year.

 Vodafone was not interested in 

 backing the schools scheme, so Beckham and his advisers 

 turned to other global names.

 The transition of Brand Beckham 

 has been clear in the Japanese market for some months. His 

 descent from ubiquity to obscurity has been staggering, 

 even in a popular culture notorious for its faddishness.

 The theory in the Japanese sports 

 papers and gossip magazines is that the exposure of Beckhams 

 alleged affair with Rebecca Loos, formerly his personal 

 assistant, has fatally dented the squeaky-clean image that 

 once made him such a favourite with spon-sors.

 In Tokyo, there used to be streets 

 and subway carriages dedicated to his image. In 2003 he 

 was said to be the most valuable star in Japan.

 Nowadays, even with Real in town, 

 it is hard to locate a single advert bearing his photograph.

 Masahiro Hieda, the manager of 

 Tokyos largest replica shirt store, has the till receipts 

 to prove the depreciation in Beckhams value. 

 We havent been selling 

 any Beckham shirts recently, he said. His England 

 shirts were almost impossible to get hold of during the 

 World Cup in 2002.

 His Manchester United one sold 

 well and a little less well during his first season in Madrid. 

 But since then weve been selling next to nothing.

 Everybodys buying Ronaldino 

 shirts now ? hes the new favourite here.

 Much of the reduced exposure has 

 been of Beckhams own doing, such as the decision to 

 end a ?1 million deal with Meiji, a confectionary company, 

 after he was mercilessly ribbed by the British press for 

 having a 10-foot chocolate statue made in his image. Meiji 

 will use Ai Miyasato, a professional golfer, instead.

 Beckhams advisors realised 

 the brand had gone too far in Japan after deals worth more 

 than ?5 million required him to cavort with cartoon rabbits 

 and look convincing while saying I love cars.

 Multimillion-pound deals with 

 Renew Car and Tokyo Beauty Clinic are also expected to lapse. 

 Yet Beckham still has 97 per cent awareness in Japan and 

 fans continue to wait for him outside his hotel.

 It may be true to say that 

 it is the end of the delirium, but he is still hugely popular, 

 a source close to Beckham said.

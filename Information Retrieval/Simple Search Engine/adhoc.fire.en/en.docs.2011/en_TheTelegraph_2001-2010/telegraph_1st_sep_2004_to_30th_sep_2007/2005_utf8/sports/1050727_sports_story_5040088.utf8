The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 One more practice match today

 - Laxman may get openers berth in ODIs as well 

 Greg Chappell is stressing on consistency 

Dambulla: The Indians are set for another practice match Wednesday as the start of the triangular series draws near in this socially and agriculturally important region of Sri Lanka. 

New coach Greg Chappell obviously believes that good coaching is more than just giving discourses on matters of mind and discussing technical niceties. He prefers cricketers to check out their lessons on the field as he demands consistency above anything else in this long, grinding season ahead. 

The process is important. Sometimes in search for the result you could ignore method, said the Australian great after the Indian team had finished a light fielding session in front of their shack-rooms and gone for a little jog around the curving lake which dominates the landscape of Dambulla. 

No wonder, Chappell found time to hold three practice games in India amid the hectic schedule of a national camp and the task of assisting selectors to pen down the squad for Sri Lanka. By Wednesday, he would have gone through two more games in four days. 

Chappell wants his selections to grow in their appointed slots before the D-day of meeting Sri Lanka in the triangular series opener on July 30. 

His first experiment concerns V.V.S. Laxman who looks all set to resume his one-day career as an opener ? something which he had forsaken with whatever authority his genteel personality could summon a few seasons ago. 

Now times have changed. Laxman is desperate to revive his one-day fortunes and would do whatever it takes to be in the side, be it bowling off-spinners or opening the innings. 

By all accounts, Laxman has looked in outstanding touch in the practice games. He did not score much in the first practice match Monday, but everyone is in raptures about his timing and the ease with which he is finding gaps in the field. The Indians are looking at solidity rather than any flamboyance from the stylish Hyderabadi. 

The Indians arrived this afternoon to Dambulla and were told it was no practice for the day. Yet all of them ventured out in the little front yards in front of their rooms when Chappell, and his support staff of Ian Frazer, John Gloster, Gregory Allan King and computer analyst Ramakrishnan gathered to aid the boys in their quest to loosen up. 

There was some predictable pattern in the session: Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra and Irfan Pathan strove to improve their strike-rate of hitting the stumps. On their left, the likes of Virender Sehwag, Mahandra Singh Dhoni, J.P. Yadav practised slip catching, while the rest, including captain Rahul Dravid took some front-on catches hit in the air by Chappell. 

The boys are consigned to stay at a resort-type club in Dambulla where there is little diversion. 

For the Indians it is a matter of serious business and they seem in no mood to lift their feet off the gas pedal, first doing the fielding bit and rounding it up with a dip in the stylishly designed pool near the hotel lobby. 

The match is scheduled in Karunegala, some 50 km from here. It is by far the busiest part of this hinterland of Sri Lanka as there are more than ten shops and even a traffic man at a round-about ? a surprise given the stillness that exists in this part of the world.

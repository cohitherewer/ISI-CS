 Bharath joins big league 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Bharath Singh is set to join the select band of trainers like Darius Byramji, S. Padmanabhan, Imtiaz Sait and, of course brother, Vijay, who has been dividing their time in stables across the country.

 RCTC apart, Bharath will be training simultaneously in Mumbai, from the forthcoming season, but not migrating to the West now. Im getting a decent string of horses, including those of Haresh N. Mehta. Ill be training at RCTC as well, said Bharath. The dual establishments may require me to shuttle up and down as I will also be training Vijay Mallyas horses at RCTC, among others. Then Ive Sanskara who is a live contender for the RCTC Classics, added Bharath, who has won many Classics and plum events for local owners.

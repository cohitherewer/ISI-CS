The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand maintains sole lead

 - MONACO CHESS 

 Indian avenges Corus loss to Leko 

 Anand is now 2.5 points ahead 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand struck back with vengeance against Hungarian Peter Leko and won the eighth round contest 1.5-0.5 in the 14th Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament (as briefly reported in Monday?s Late City edition). 

After a wonderful start that fetched him as many as nine points from first 10 games, the Indian ace hit a temporary low against Russians Alexander Morozevich and Evgeny Bareev and could muster just 1.5 points in four games against them. 

However, with this fine win against Leko, Anand yet again stamped his authority on this unique event that has a total prize money of euro 1,93,250. 

After the much-needed win, Anand took his tally to 12 points out of a possible 16 and maintained his sole lead by a whopping 2.5 points with just three rounds or six games remaining in the 11-player round-robin event that has one blindfold and one rapid game in each round. 

Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk (9.5) follows Anand, while last year?s joint winner Morozevich is in third with 9 points. 

The fourth place is jointly shared by Leko and Russian duo of Vladimir Kramnik and Peter Svidler all of whom have 8.5 points apiece. 

In the rapid event, the Indian had a half point lead over Ivanchuk and an improved performance this year in the blindfold saw Anand topping the nearest rivals by a 1.5 points margin. 

Against Leko, Anand was at his technical best especially in the rapid game after the blindfold encounter between the two was drawn . 

Playing the Petroff Defence, Anand was quick to pounce on the opportunity offered by Leko as he sacrificed three pieces for a queen and later picked up white pawns in tandem to score the victory in 51 moves. 

With the victory, Anand also avenged his loss against Leko in the Corus chess meet earlier this year, in which the Indian had finished second behind the Hungarian. 

Earlier, in the blindfold game, Anand had little to worry about with his white pieces as Leko allowed the Ruy Lopez having the Marshall Gambit in mind. 

Anand, showing little interest in a theoretical and tactical battle, steered the game to a close variation and the players signed the peace in just 20 moves. 

 Kramnik, Topalov, Ivanchuk and Spaniard Alexei Shirov scored victories playing black as all the games in rapid had a decisive result for the first time in the event. 

Kramnik?s victory was only enough to level scores against compatriot Morozevich as the latter had scored a fine win in their blindfold game earlier in the day. 

Ivanchuk was the biggest gainer as he downed Svidler in a tactical skirmish in the rapid game after drawing the blindfold while Topalov, struggling with his form here, gained an excellent 1.5-0.5 victory over Bareev.

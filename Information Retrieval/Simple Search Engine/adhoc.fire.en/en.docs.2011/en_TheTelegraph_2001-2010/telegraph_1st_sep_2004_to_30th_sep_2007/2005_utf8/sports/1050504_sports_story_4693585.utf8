 Guga writes off own chances

 Kuerten 

Rome: Triple French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten has written off his chances at Roland Garros this year because of his lack of fitness. 

The 28-year-old Brazilian, who has been easing his way back after six months on the sidelines following a second hip operation in two years, was beaten 3-6, 3-6 in the first round of the Rome Masters on Monday by Tim Henman. 

Asked about his chances at the French Open, which starts in three weeks? time, Kuerten replied: ?I think it?s going to be tough for me to do something, even winning a couple of matches. 

?I don?t see myself going further than the quarter finals, semi-finals, something like that. 

?But as long as I can be there playing more and more matches, that?s going to be very valuable for myself mentally and for my personal motivation, too. 

?So I will prepare myself as best I can for that tournament. That?s been the idea since I came back. 

?But it?s not going to be enough for sure. I can?t be at the same level as the other guys.?

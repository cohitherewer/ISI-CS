The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India have to work as unit

 - Teammates need to rally behind Sourav: Steve Waugh 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh feels that Team India is not working as a unit and that has led to the lacklustre performance in the recently concluded series against Pakistan. 

They are a talented side, close to Australia. I think they need to work as a cohesive unit to perform better? No individual can help improve the teams fortunes, Waugh said during a press conference at a city hotel on Thursday. 

Steve, who is on a business trip here, didnt agree that batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar was not performing up to the mark. 

On Team India captain Sourav Gangulys recent form, the most-capped Test cricketer said: It is time for his teammates to back him as this sort of bad phase is quite common in the life of all sportsmen. Sourav should look back at his performance in the last 10 years, which has been outstanding. 

He also mentioned that this bad phase should be a wake-up call for the Indian captain, and can bring him back to the peak soon. At times things just dont work out? But this is only a passing phase. 

Its a good wake up call for Sourav. He is under pressure. If he is the sort of player that I have known him for long, I am sure that he will rise to the occasion. 

Steve recalled that he too had passed through such lean phases during his career. 

Asked whether he would be available for Team India duty, Waugh said: If the help required is for a short term, its okay, but in the long-term I have too many things in hand.

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni came, saw and conquered the heart of Shambazar Club as well as the Eden on Monday, in his typically scintillating, swashbuckling manner. 

He smashed 207 off just 126 balls, including 10 sixes and sank George Telegraph along the way on his P. Sen invitational Trophy debut at Eden Gardens on Monday. 

The impact of his innings seemed so deep that it might not end in itself. 

If it led the people present at the ground to talking about the Team India ODI wicketkeepers 148 against Pakistan (in Visakhapatnam in April), it also threw up on Monday a wish that the opportunity of seeing the man in full action wearing the Bengal jersey should be explored. 

As of now, the CAB top brass is yet to approach the Jharkhand player to serve Bengal in the next season. However, the temptation to do so could well arrive in time to come. 

When asked about this, Dhoni said, Let the offer come to me and then Ill focus on this. 

Coming back to the match, Dhoni admitted that it was a challenge and a pressure to perform and in the end, he looked relieved, brooding over some of his schooldays memories. 

It was a challenge of different sorts here. First, Im playing in different conditions ? the question of adaptation, heat and other related things are there. Then, I have come here to perform? thats what my club is expecting. So it has put some extra pressure on me. Hopefully, I have proved my worth, Dhoni said after Shambazar thrashed George Telegraph by 203 runs. 

The knock, studded with 20 hits to the fence as well, gave him an occasion to look back into his formative years. 

It (the 147-minute innings of 207) brought back some memories? I got a double century for my school (213 in 1997). Todays innings has reminded me of that, Dhoni maintained, checking his emotion. 

He, however, refused to say that the first double century in the tournament, was his best so far in domestic circuit. 

Its certainly one of my memorable innings, but not the best. Because the bowling wasnt quite up to the mark, he said, candidly. 

Dhoni, however, is looking forward to the new challenges in international arena. 

I always look for improving my game. Ive also a plan to meet Nayan Mongia and discuss with him some of the finer aspects of wicketkeeping, he told the reporters. 

Against George Telegraph, Dhoni was ably supported by Wriddhiman Saha (who scor-ed 74). The duo put up 274 in just 32.1 overs in the opening stand. 

If George wished to have any aspirations in the game, those were quickly killed by Shib Shankar Paul. He scuppered George with a five-wicket hall, conceding 30 runs. 

In another match, held at the Jadavpur Universitys Salt Lake complex, Kalighat also won big, accounting for Combined Universities by 101 run. 

Safi Ahmed hit a unbeaten 100 for Kalighat.

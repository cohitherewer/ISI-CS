 Hari keeps full-point lead

 Harikrishna 

Hoogeveen: P. Harikrishna maintained a full-point lead after drawing a tactical battle with Aeroflot Open winner Emil Sutovsky of Israel in the fourth round of the Essent chess tournament here. 

With the draw, Harikrishna, competing in the crown section, took his tally to 3 points out of a possible four. 

There was no change in the overnight standings as womens world champion Antoaneta Stefanova earned a creditable draw with top seed and local star Ivan Sokolov for the second time in the tournament. 

Both Sokolov and Sutovsky have 2 points each with just two rounds remaining in this category-16 double round robin tournament. 

Harikrishnas game against Sutovsky was a bloody fight right from the beginning. The Indian, having the cushion of a full point and white pieces, was in for a surprise when just before the start of the game Sutovsky asked him to check the wavering of his hands. 

Disturbed as he was, he did not let it show beyond the first few moves. Regaining his composure in quick time, Harikrishna got an advantageous position amidst wild complexities arising out of a queen-pawn game. 

Sutovsky won Harikrishnas queen but had to part with three pieces in the process. Sutovsky was able to neutralise huge material deficit with his active queen and minor pieces. The Israeli eventually found perpetual checks to split the point in 32 moves. 

Sokolov was surprised for the second time by Stefanova who is on just one point, thanks to her double-draws against the Dutchman. 

In the open section, Parimarjan Negi suffered a defeat at the hands of GM Ian Rogers of Australia. Negi remained on 4 points after the loss in the event which is jointly led by Vladimir Baklan, Michail Brodsky (both Ukraine), Friso Nijboer (Netherlands) and Eduardas Rozentalis (Lithuania).

New Delhi: Irfan Pathans promotion as opener might be Team Indias surprise element in the ongoing Test, but Chaminda Vaas said it was not so for his team. 

We could understand that Indias strategy would be to get some quick runs on the board (in the second innings). But Pathan batted really well, the left-arm pacer said on Monday. 

Vaas, however, revealed that he was waiting for his 300th wicket. Its a milestone and a very pleasing moment in my 10-year-old career. I was waiting for it, he said. 

It is not easy being a fast bowler in the subcontinent. To bowl in these conditions and for such a long period requires a lot of hard work. he added. 

According to Vaas, bowling in tandem with Muttiah Muralidharan was a key factor of his success. 

Murali is one of the worlds best. So, as he bowls from the other end, the batsmen focus too much on him and it helps me get wickets, he said.

 Gagan Ajit peeved with organisers

Karachi: Indian striker Gagan Ajit Singh says he thoroughly enjoyed playing in the Super Hockey League but would think twice before returning to Pakistan if invited to play in the second edition of the event. 

The hospitality had been excellent and I have been loved and admired both on-and-off the field which made me feel at home. Nevertheless, I would think twice before returning for the second Super Hockey League, Gagan said at the Hockey Club of Pakistan Stadium last night after the final. 

When pressed further, he said, I feel sad and insulted as the organisers did not consider me good enough to be considered for player of the league award. 

I agree that Mohammad Shabbir (of Sindh Qalandars) deserved the award, but having won two Man-of-the-Match awards in the league event, I deserved to be in the pool of players who were considered for the award. (PTI)

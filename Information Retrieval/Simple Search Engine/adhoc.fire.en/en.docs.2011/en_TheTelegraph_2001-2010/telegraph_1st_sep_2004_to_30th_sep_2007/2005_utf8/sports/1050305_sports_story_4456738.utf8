 Bangla manage draw

New Delhi: Central Zone set up title clash against North Zone in the Duleep Trophy even though they failed to deliver the knockout punch to Bangladesh on the final day of their league match on Friday. 

Chasing a target of 436 runs, Bangladesh were 199 for six in their second innings when the two captains agreed for a draw, after rain interrupted the match a couple of overs into the last session at the Karnail Singh Stadium. Bangladesh finished their campaign without a point from their two matches. In their first match, the tourists suffered an innings defeat against East Zone. 

Earlier, Sanjay Bangar narrowly missed a century, adding just five runs to his overnight score of 91.

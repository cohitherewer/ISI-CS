Dublin (Ohio): American Jeff Sluman fired a flawless seven-under 65 to take the first round lead at the Memorial tournament in Dublin, Ohio Thursday with Tiger Woods lurking near the top of the leaderboard. 

Sluman, who needed a sponsors exemption to gain entry into the tournament, started quietly with three pars but then birdied six of the next nine holes and added one more on the 15th for a bogey-free start at the $ 5.2 million event and a one stroke advantage on South African Rory Sabbatini. 

For Indias Arjun Atwal, though, it was a see-saw ride throughout the round. He bit into the course with a double-bogey on the fourth, a major setback. Ad, as if that wasnt enough, he got tied up in a bogey on the ninth. However, Atwal, who has made the cut in all outings this year, recovered brilliantly, with an eagle on the 11th. He pushed his position further with a 12th-hole birdie before slumping to another bogey on the next. Birdies on the 15 th and the 16th helped him complete his round at a one-under 71, tied at 39th spot. 

Sitting one stroke back at five-under 67 from Sluman is a group of eight golfers, including Adam Scott and Nick Hern, while Woods headlines another large group at three-under 69. 

Woods two great rivals here got off to far less impressive starts, world number one Vijai Singh slumping to a five-over 77 and defending champion Ernie Els carding a one-over 73. Playing at the event Jack Nicklaus had looked ready to card a solid opening round sitting on even par through 14 holes. But the 65-year-old staggered to the finish with bogeys on three of his final four holes for a three-over 75.

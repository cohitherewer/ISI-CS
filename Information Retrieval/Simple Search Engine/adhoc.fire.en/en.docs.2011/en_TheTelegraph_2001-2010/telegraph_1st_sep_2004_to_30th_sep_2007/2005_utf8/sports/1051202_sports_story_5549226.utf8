 Firoz in lead after Day II

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Familiarity with the course is a big plus for any golfer. Ask this to Firoz Ali and youll get a prompt answer. The home-grown golfer continued the consistent form and led the inaugural Hero Honda Open East at the halfway stage. 

With a two-under 70, Firoz now holds a slender one shot lead over fellow citymate Yusuf Ali, as the seventh event on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour 2005-06 season moves into the final two money making rounds. 

The difficult Royal Calcutta Golf Club was everything but kind to the golfers with the cut going at 10-over 154 that saw 61 professionals and 5 amateurs make it to the final stages of the event. 

The first-round leader Amardip Sinh Malik had a birdie putt on the par-3 thirteenth, but the ball hit his playing partners one that resulted in a two shot penalty and a double bogey that saw him finish with a one-over 73. 

Yusuf shot the best round of the day, with a score of 4-under 68 and now stands at sole second, with a total of 4-under 140. Indrajit Bhalotia also had a good day, turning in a card of 3-under 69.

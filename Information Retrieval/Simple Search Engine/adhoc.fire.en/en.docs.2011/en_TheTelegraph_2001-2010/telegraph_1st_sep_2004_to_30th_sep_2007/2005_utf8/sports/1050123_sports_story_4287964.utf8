 Allodium strikes again 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Allodium did it again on Saturday. The nine-year-old gelding, from trainer Bharath Singh?s yard, produced a champion-like performance to walk away with the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup. Earlier in the season, while winning the 1,600m Eveready Gold Cup, the Twist And Turn-Dangerous Romance son was pressed to the limit by a much younger horse, Calorific. But, over the extended trip, Allodium was on his own, leaving Calorific behind by a length and-a-half.

 The pace in the race was hot, rather scorching, with Accuser slipping into a six-length lead. Approved followed the leader, with the favourite, Moon Emperor, Calorific and Allodium, on his heels.

 At the half-way stage, the pace turned cracking when Approved bolted in front to make the race further difficult for the favourite. However, the Vijay Singh-trainee ruined his own chances in the process.

 C. Alford, who guided Allodium to victory, also helped Vijay saddle two winners. If Arapahoe tested his riding skill in the Republic Cup, Aleksei gave him an armchair ride in the prestigious juvenile race ? the Indian Champagne Stakes over 1,400 metres. In his debut run, and as a half-money favourite, the Razeen-Remembren son had placed fourth owning to injudicious riding. Alford was warned on that occasion.

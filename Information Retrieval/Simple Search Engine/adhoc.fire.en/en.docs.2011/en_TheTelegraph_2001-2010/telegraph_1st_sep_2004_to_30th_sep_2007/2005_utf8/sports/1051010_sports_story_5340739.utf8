The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 World Cup missed the Best

 Patrick Barclay 

It was not just here that George Bests latest illness made news. I happened to be in Italy last Tuesday and an Italian newspaper carried a top-of-the-page article with pictures of Best in his Manchester United prime ? the fifth Beatle ? and now. 

The tragedy of his journey from the fifth Beatle to the last-chance saloon, where, by the grace of God, he appears to have spent an inordinate length of time, was dwelt upon, and I marvelled at how the word of a great talent had somehow got around in the Sixties and Seventies, when television coverage was scanty in comparison with todays. Except, of course, during World Cups and other major events. Which Best, due to his birth in Northern Ireland, never experienced. 

 I suppose most of his Italian admirers would have savoured his classic goal in the European Champions Cup final of 1968, when he went round Benficas goalkeeper before rolling the ball into an unguarded net. Was he the greatest player never to feature in a World Cup? Among United Kingdom players, he was certainly a class above Ryan Giggs (and, before anyone takes offence on Giggss behalf, let me add that to be one class below Best is an honour), while the air-crash victim Duncan Edwards died young. 

 Farther afield, though a case could be made for George Weah ? still held in such esteem by Liberians that he is a candidate in their presidential election on Tuesday ? only Alfredo di Stefano could be said to stand taller than Best in the hall of fame. Di Stefano, described by Bests erstwhile teammate Sir Bobby Charlton as the leading footballer of all time, above even Pele, not only helped Real Madrid to win the Champions Cup in each of its first five seasons, but scored in each final. 

The story of how Di Stefano and the World Cup avoided each other is an odd one. In 1950, when he played for Argentina, they declined to enter. 

In 1954, because he had represented both his native land and Colombia, Fifa declared him ineligible for Spain. In 1958, by which time Fifa had relented, Spain failed to qualify. In 1962, he was injured and by 1966 he was 40. 

Best, likewise got his chance too late. Or so he argued when Billy Bingham, having guided Northern Ireland into the 1982 finals in Spain without him, made an 11th-hour plea for him to get fit enough to take part. 

Best, by now in his late thirties, refused, and it was probably one of his more sensible decisions. But, at his peak he had a talent that few footballers, if any, in the games history could surpass. 

He was an extraordinary player and, although drink and other demons were to turn him into a sad little man, the basic material from which his personality was fashioned could be very pleasant indeed. 

Eventually, when no health farm or stomach implant can save him and the obituaries are polished, much will be made of his alcoholism and occasional belligerence, but I remember an obliging young man who once helped this equally young reporter to write an article when he would have been justified in shaking his head, berating me for wasting his time and striding from the room.

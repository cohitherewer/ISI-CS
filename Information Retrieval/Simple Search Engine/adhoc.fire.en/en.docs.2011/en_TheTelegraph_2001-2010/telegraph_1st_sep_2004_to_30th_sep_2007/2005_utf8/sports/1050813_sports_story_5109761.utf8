Calcutta: Prakash Padukones fondness for cricket is well-known. Despite a busy schedule at his academy in Bangalore and Pune, he keeps himself regularly updated on what is happening in cricket. So much so that he was aware that Sourav Ganguly had been re-appointed captain for the Zimbabwe tour. 

Sourav is the right choice. It was known he would be back. Rahul (Dravid) was a stop-gap arrangement, Padukone told The Telegraph on Friday evening. 

The elegant and humble Padukone has always been an inspiration for many a cricketer. Indias first All England champions friendship with Sunil Gavaskar dates back to their playing days in the late Seventies and Eighties. Anil Kumble, too, has acknowledged Padukone being a source of motivation during his early days. 

Sunny has always been my inspiration? He was the one Indian sporting icon I always looked up to? Besides bringing the country innumerable laurels, he changed the face of Indian cricket. He showed the world that Indians could play fast bowling. Being contemporaries, we developed a liking for each other. He remains the all-time favourite, Padukone remarked. 

But doesnt he have a liking for any of the current crop of players? Sachin Tendulkar, he said after a moments silence. 

Besides an excellent track record, Sachins human qualities are adorable. The way he handles pressure? The way he carries himself on and off the field? His mental toughness? His concentration and dedication? The way he carries the expectations of a nation on his shoulders, Padukone explained. 

Padukone spent another busy day on Friday before taking a late evening flight out of the city. Besides meeting representatives of the Badminton Players Association of India, he spent time with trainees at Sports Authority of India.

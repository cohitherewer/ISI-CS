 WI working hard to shake off rust

 Courtney Browne 

Melbourne: The West Indies wicketkeeper Courtney Browne has admitted his side are rusty after three months off, but should be ready to face Australia and Pakistan in a triangular one-day series starting next week. 

West Indies, who had not played since winning the Champions Trophy in September, were beaten by seven wickets by Victoria in the opening match of their Australian tour. 

They play two one-day matches against Australia ?A? in Tasmania over the weekend. ?We were obviously a bit rusty,? Browne said of Wednesday?s game when they were bowled out for 201 in 47.5 overs before Victoria scored 205 for three with 18 overs to spare. ?But we are working hard to get ready for the two games over the weekend. 

?We want to be in a position of strength when we go into the (one-day) series.? Australia A pace bowler Michael Lewis said his side would not let up. ?We?re going to test them out a bit,? said Lewis. 

?If we can put the wind up and get a psychological edge on them that?s great and hopefully when they play the senior side the scars will be there for them.? (Reuters)

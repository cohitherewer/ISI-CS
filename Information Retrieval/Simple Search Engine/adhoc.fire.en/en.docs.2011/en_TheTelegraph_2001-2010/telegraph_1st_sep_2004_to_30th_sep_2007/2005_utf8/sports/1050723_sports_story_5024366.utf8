 Ferdinand row looms over tour

 - Rio will play for United in the coming season, says agent 

 Tim Rich in Hong Kong

Manchester United have arrived here for an intensive summer tour facing familiar clouds ? those bearing rain common to Old Trafford and those hanging over Rio Ferdinand. 

If, as expected, Joel Glazer joins the United tour around China and Japan, the most pressing task for the man overseeing the clubs affairs is settling Ferdinands contract dispute, now a running sore. 

Ferdinand is likely to receive a far warmer reception in Hong Kong than he did in the friendlies at Clyde and Peterborough, as it is the Chinese way to be polite. His agent, Pini Zahavi, attempted to limit the damage Thursday by saying that the centre-half would not seek to leave Manchester United this season, regardless of his relationship with the clubs supporters. 

Rio will be playing for United in the coming season, theres no doubt about that, Zahavi said. He has said he wants to stay and I know for sure that Manchester United dont want to sell him. 

But Zahavi said no resumption of contract talks was planned ? and there is still no sign of Cristiano Ronaldo formally sealing a long-expected new deal that would treble his ?15,000-a-week pay packet. Theres no need to panic, Zahavi said of Ferdinands situation. 

He has two years left on his contract and when Manchester United come back to us we will talk again. 

After admitting that their slog around the United States last summer contributed to a disappointing start to the 2004-05 season, it seems strange that United have scheduled four games in a dozen days as well as a raft of sponsorship events. 

Nevertheless, unlike the American tour, broadly regarded with indifference, United were greeted keenly on their arrival, fans having queued in the rain to ensure that Saturdays game against Hong Kong is sold out.

 Salgaocar rally to hold Churchill

Margao: Salgaocar capitalised on the defensive lapses of Churchill Brothers to hold them to a 1-1 draw at the end of the sixth round of the National Football League match at Nehru Stadium on Tuesday. 

Marcos Pereira, who played his first match after taken on loan from Salgaocar, gave Churchill lead in the fifth minute when he floated the ball, off a free kick, past the rival wall to beat goalkeeper Juje Siddi to find the far post. 

Salgaocar came back strongly in the second half and restored parity through Felix Ibrebru in the 60th minute. 

The draw took Salgaocar to seven points as they moved to sixth place, displacing JCT on goal difference while Churchill, who have two points, are at the bottom. 

Looking for their first win, Churchill started positively as Yakubu and Marcos Pereira combined well initially. 

They took an early lead in the fifth minute when Marcos, who took the free kick from the top of the box after Yakubu was tackled from behind by rival defender, floated the ball over the wall of Salgaocar beating ?keeper Siddi to find the far post. 

The goal acted as a tonic for Churchill Brothers who went into the attack and nearly increased the lead but Salgaocar defender Remus Gomes made a goal line save off Osmanu Hussein header off a flag kick taken by Yakubu. 

Churchill suffered a setback when their midfielder Bungo Singh got injured midway in the first half and Churchill surrendered their midfield superiority. 

Salgaocar went on the attack and tried long shot but found keeper Marc Mascarenhas hard to beat as he made a diving save off Rocus Lamare shot four minutes before the interval to deny Salgaocar the equaliser. 

Salgaocar kept on the pressure after the interval and found the equaliser in the 60th minute through a defensive lapse. 

Samson Singh snatched the ball from defender Subhashish Roy Choudhary and relayed the ball to Felix Ibrebru who after entering the box, beat goalie Mascarenhas with a fine placement. 

Both the teams went all out to break the deadlock and Salgaocar?s Jerose missed an open chance in the 88th minute first and later Churchill?s Marcos Pereira shot was put out by Siddi. 

Meanwhile, Sporting Clube de Goa?s NFL match against Vasco slated on Thursday has been postponed after the team?s request was accepted by the AIFF on Tuesday. (PTI)

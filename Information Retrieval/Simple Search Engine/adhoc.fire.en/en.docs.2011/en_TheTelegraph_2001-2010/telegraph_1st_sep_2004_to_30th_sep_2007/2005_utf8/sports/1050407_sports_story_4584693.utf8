Napier: Captain Maravan Atapattu made a chanceless 127 and Mahela Jayawardene blazed an unbeaten 118 to help Sri Lanka reach 351 for three when bad light ended play early on the third day of the opening Test at McLean Park. New Zealand had earlier posted 561. 

In registering his 16th century, Atapattu became the fifth player to score hundreds against all nine Test opponents. The others to have done this are Gary Kirsten, Steve Waugh, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. 

The tourists are still 210 behind New Zealand?s massive first innings total but with only two days remaining on a placid pitch that offers little encouragement to bowlers, a draw is the most likely outcome. 

?The pitch isn?t going to break up, it?s going to be a flat surface for five days,? New Zealand paceman Chris Martin said. ?To get a result on it will need either some sensational cricket or some very average cricket.? 

Sri Lanka began the day 48 without loss and suffered an early setback when Martin removed opener Sanath Jayasuriya and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara before lunch. 

Jayasuriya fell two short of a half-century when he was trapped leg-before with the total on 95. Martin added the scalp of Sangakkara (5) with the first ball of his next over when the left-hander played on. 

Martin?s double-strike brought Atapattu and Jayawardene together and the pair quickly set about balancing the ledger with a partnership of 184, setting a Sri Lankan record for the third wicket against New Zealand. 

Jayawardene made a flying start to his innings, reaching his half-century at almost a run a ball and then going on to register his 13th Test hundred off 157 deliveries. 

Atapattu, cautious but elegant, crawled to his half-century in 119 deliveries but accelerated after lunch, reaching his hundred off 196 balls in 255 minutes when he pulled Kyle Mills for his 17th boundary. 

The Lankan skipper raised his bat in triumph as he recalled the inauspicious start to his Test career, when he managed only one run from his first six innings. He was dropped for three years but forced his way back in and has been on a roller-coaster ride ever since. 

His Test career includes 21 ducks but also features 16 centuries and six double-hundreds, more than any other player in history except Don Bradman (12), Wally Hammond (7) and Brian Lara (7). 

?It?s so special, thinking about the start that I had in Test cricket,? Atapattu said. 

?I am especially happy as it was one of my ambitions that I had to score a century against every Test-playing nation.? 

Atapattu reached another major milestone on Wednesday 

when he became the fourth Sri Lankan to reach the 5,000 Test-run mark but got 

out before adding to his score, caught by New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming 

off Nathan Astle.

 English reverse keeps Aussies guessing

 - Its an area weve got to look at, says Ponting

 Flintoff uses reverse swing very well and at 90 mph 

Australia may have escaped further damage to their Ashes prospects with their last-gasp draw at Old Trafford, but they remain deeply worried over the threat posed by the reverse swing of England bowlers like Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones. 

After the high-octane cricket of two of the best Ashes Tests ever played, in which both sides battled each other to a standstill, the players have just over a week to prepare for the fourth Test at Trent Bridge, which begins next week. 

With the series level at 1-1 and everything left to play for, preparations over the next week will be crucial. But while Englands players have a note from their coach Duncan Fletcher to excuse even those six belonging to counties in Saturdays C amp;G Trophy semi-finals, Australia are set to move heaven and earth to nullify the reverse swing that has caused their batsmen, especially the middle-order, so much anxiety in the Test matches since Lords. 

Its an area weve got to look at, and not only from the batting point of view, Ricky Ponting, Australias captain, said. Weve also got to work out how we can do it better when were bowling. Theres no doubt its played a key role in the last couple of games. 

At the moment, the middle-order is the most difficult place in the game to bat. I would take facing a new ball thats swinging than facing a 10-over old ball thats reversing the way it did at Old Trafford. Flintoff does it very well. He uses his angles well, he goes around the wicket a lot to the left-handers and swings it both ways as much as anyone in the game. And he does it at 90 mph. 

Pontings side do not have much time to either convert the bowlers or for batsmen to find counter-measures. Suggestions so far are for batsmen to bat out of their crease, as Glenn McGrath did when facing the last over from Steve Harmison on Monday, a move that would lessen the likelihood of lbw. Yet that has to be balanced against a reduction in the reaction time against the 90 mph-plus balls being sent down by Harmison, Fintoff and Jones. 

With England using a bowling machine called Merlyn to help them tame the spin of Shane Warne, with decent success, perhaps Australia should make enquiries to see if there is one for swingers. 

Reverse swing is not a new phenomenon, having been around in Test cricket since the Seventies when Sarfraz Nawaz, the Pakistan pace bowler, used it. It has since been handed down and refined by the likes of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, two of its greatest exponents, though not all bowlers fully understand how it works. 

Broadly speaking, one side of the cricket ball needs to be smooth and slightly damp, while the other is dry and abraded. Unlike conventional swing, which requires precise technique and an optimum pace to keep the seam upright long enough to trip the boundary layer of air around the ball, reverse swing seems to work better the quicker it is bowled. 

Englands bowlers, especially the fiery Welshman Jones, seem to have taken it further still. What used to take 30 overs of wear and tear before it worked, now takes about 10 to 15 overs. What is more, Jones can get it to move both ways at will, something Waqar and Wasim only managed on rare occasions. 

Jones improvements since the winter tour of South Africa have enabled England to keep Australias batsmen under pressure when the big two, Harmison and Flintoff, take a breather. 

Simon has definitely come of age, Fletcher said. His improvement has been tremendous and when he gets that old ball in his hand hes as good as anyone with reverse swing. He can control it both ways and his next step up is now maybe to use the new ball a little bit more effectively. 

Fletcher admitted that Englands plans against Australias batsmen had been working well. Of course the Aussies claim to be experiencing a dip in form, pointing out that despite Englands dominance over the last two Tests they have just one win to show for it. The truth is less palatable, with most errors being forced by Englands bowlers. 

Im sure there must be some doubts in their minds, Fletcher said. Weve got our plans against all of the Australian batters and the nice part about it is weve got bowlers now who bowl to those plans, which have seemed to work. 

Were getting 19, 20 wickets a match so somewhere along the line its got to sow some sort of doubt in their minds.

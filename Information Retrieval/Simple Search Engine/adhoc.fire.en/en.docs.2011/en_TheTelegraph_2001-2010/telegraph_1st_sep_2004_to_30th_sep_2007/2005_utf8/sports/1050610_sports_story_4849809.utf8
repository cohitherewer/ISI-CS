The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Johnson predicts a record this summer

 - Lius success inspires hurdlers to think big 

 Allen Johnson considers himself, Liu Xiang and 2 others as possible record-breakers

Eugene: Chinese hurdler Liu Xiangs stunning run to the 110m hurdles Olympic gold will be the inspiration for a world record in the event this year, four-time world champion Allen Johnson believes. 

Somebody is going to run faster than (the world record of) 12.91 seconds this summer, American Johnson predicted during an interview at the Prefontaine Grand Prix meet last week. 

Its the spirit of competition, Johnson added. Everyone really feels they have a shot to win and everyone is going to run hard. 

The 21-year-old Liu set the stage when he equalled Briton Colin Jacksons now 12-year-old record with his Olympic win in Athens. 

His success as a fresh face in the sport brought a new outlook to the hurdles, Johnson said. It gives people the impression that if he can do it, I can do it. 

For me, I feel like I am not going to let these young guys come up and pass me by, the 34-year-old added. 

Johnson, whose lifetime best is 12.92 seconds, puts himself, Liu, US Olympic double silver-medallist Terrence Trammell and French indoor European champion Ladji Doucoure in the group most likely to take down the record. 

Cuban Sydney Olympic champion Anier Garcia could join the group if he worked himself back into top shape, Johnson said. 

Liu has already shown he could challenge the record this year with runs of 13.12 and 13.06 seconds. The latter, in the Prefontaine meet, is the fastest time in the world this season. 

It came in the first of two races in the United States for Liu, who had never competed in the US previously. 

Johnson, who fell in the early rounds of the Athens Olympics and did not make the final, also had to watch the Prefontaine race from the sidelines after being disqualified for a false start. 

The two men are scheduled to meet again on Saturday in New York. Then Liu will turn his attention to Europe. Using Paris as a base, he had at least 10 major European races on his schedule, including Augusts world championships in Helsinki, Liu said.

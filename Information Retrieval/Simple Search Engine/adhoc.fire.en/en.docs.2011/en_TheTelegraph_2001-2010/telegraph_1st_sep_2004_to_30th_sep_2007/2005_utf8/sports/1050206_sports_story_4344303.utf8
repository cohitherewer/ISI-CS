The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Subrata blames defensive lapses

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan slumped to their second straight defeat, their third in six NFL-ONGC Cup matches this season. It wasn?t a happy afternoon for the three-time champions. 

But coach Subrata Bhattacharya was remarkably composed while facing the media after Saturday?s 1-2 loss against Fransa Pax FC. 

He conceded that the defence had faltered, leading to the defeat. ?Mehraj hasn?t fully matured, Prasanta (Dora) made a mistake, even Noel (Wilson),? Subrata said. 

?Let?s see if things improve after (Ajibade) Babalade?s induction. He?s mature and I?m quite hopeful. We have to stop conceding goals.? 

The Nigerian defender wasn?t eligible for Saturday?s game as he signed across the dotted lines just 24 hours earlier. 

He will be making his debut in the home match against JCT on Wednesday. 

Mohun Bagan, who have seven points, have conceded six goals while scoring only four in six matches so far. 

Fransa coach Norbert Gonsalves also pointed out Mohun Bagan?s defensive woes. ?Yes, they need to strengthen their defence. A constructive medio like Noel (Wilson) can?t play as stopper. He made our job easier.? 

Gonsalves came down heavily on the referee (Chamchuk Lama). ?He denied us two penalties and showed yellow cards unnecessarily,? said Gonsalves, a former Salgaocar midfielder. 

Of course, the coach was delighted with Saturday?s 

scoreline. ?Mohun Bagan are a very good side, a draw would have been a bonus for 

us? This is a great result, especially after the loss to Tollygunge Agragami (on 

Tuesday),? said Gonsalves.

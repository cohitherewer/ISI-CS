 Regent set to redeem image 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Southern Regent looks all set to win the 2,200m Maharajas Cup here on Sunday. In his last start, the multi-Classic winner from S.Ganapathys yard had found the metric mile a wee bit sharp to his liking. Over the extended trip, the Razeen-Allinda son may make amends for his last failure in the hands of B. Prakash.

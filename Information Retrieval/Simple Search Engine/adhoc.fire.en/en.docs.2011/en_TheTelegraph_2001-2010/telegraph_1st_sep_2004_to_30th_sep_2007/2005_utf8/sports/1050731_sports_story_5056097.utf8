New Delhi: Sahaj Grover, who won the under-10 World Chess Championship in Belfort (France) on Thursday, returned home to a rapturous welcome from family members, schoolmates and teachers. 

Sahaj, who reached Delhi from Paris via Doha, was garlanded by father Vijay Grover and several others. His friends from the Kulachi Hansraj Model School then played the school band and broke into a bhangra to show their appreciation for Sahajs feat. 

Champagne bottles popped as elders joined in the celebration. 

Despite a long and tiring flight back home, the Delhi boy was visibly overjoyed to see the euphoria on his arrival. 

We are overwhelmed by his achievement, said his father. Only last month, his son became the worlds youngest International Master. 

Sahaj was hardly four when he participated in the Delhi U-19 Championship where he won one game. 

He won a silver medal in the U-8 and U-10 categories of the British Open Championships in Torquay in 2002.

 Atwal shares lead with DiMarco

 - NEW ORLEANS CLASSIC 

 A tough day, says Indian ace after 8-birdie Round I 

 Arjun Atwal returned seven under 65 

Avondale (Louisiana): Arjun Atwal went on a birdie spree to return a brilliant seven-under 65 and share top place after the opening round in the $5.5 million PGA Zurich Classic of New Orleans on Thursday. 

Atwal, who lost in a play-off to Phil Mickelson in the Bellsouth Classic three weeks ago, shared the lead with an equally flawless Chris DiMarco who is playing his first event since losing the Masters in a heart-breaking shootout with Tiger Woods two weeks ago. 

Defending champion Vijai Singh was two off the pace as he was tied for third place with J.J. Henry, Tom Pernice and Tim Clark. 

India-born Swede Daniel Chopra, who had a topsy-turvy start from the tenth tee, was placed joint 36th at one-under 71. He birdied 13th, double-bogeyed 17th and birdied 18th as he turned in three-over. On the second nine, he had four birdies between second and eighth hole to finish at one-under. 

The windy conditions made it difficult when Atwal started on the tenth tee. But the Indian played well to land two birdies in his first nine and then went on a rampage with six birdies on the return journey. In its first year at the Pete Dye-designed course, thus, this opener becomes the course record, first time Atwal?s name will be recorded for posterity in the USPGA. 

?It was a tough day,? said Atwal. ?I know the score seems pretty low but we ground it out there. The course was not playing easy, I?m just glad today is over and hope tomorrow doesn?t play as tough as this. This is the first time I?ve ever gotten a sponsor?s invite to a PGA Tour event and glad I did.? 

Atwal said he concentrated on his putting. He had just 23 for the round, the lowest number of putts for the day. He topped in birdie count with eight, as he also bogeyed once on the third. ?I just tried to make pars because it was so windy. Then I got things going on the front nine,? Atwal said. 

Between the 18th and eighth, over the nine holes, he birdied seven, bogeyed one on the third and parred the par-4 fifth. Atwal, the first Indian to play the US Tour, earlier this month became the first from his country to get into a play-off of a US tour event and finished tied second. He now becomes the only Indian to share the lead at the end of a round. 

DiMarco, coming off the draining loss in the first hole of a play-off to Woods at Augusta National, had a bogey-free round as the winds teased the golfers. 

DiMarco started the round on No. 10 and had three birdies on the first nine holes. He got to 4 under with a birdie on number 1, made five straight pars, and holed a 20-foot eagle putt on the par-5 seventh. He closed the round with a birdie on No. 9. 

?This course reminds me a little bit of Augusta,? said DiMarco. ?My goal now is when I?m ready I?m going to hit it.? 

Singh also opened on back nine and he had two bogeys and three birdies to make the turn at one-under. He bogeyed the first, birdied the second, sixth and seventh and then eagled the par-4 eighth with a 339-foot drive and a 30-yard chip to go to six-under. 

But he then three-putted the ninth for a final bogey.

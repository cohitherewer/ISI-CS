 MCC members scalping on Net

RICHARD SYDENHAM AND ROYA NIKKHAH 

London: Members of the Marylebone Cricket Club face a two-year ban for selling their tickets to the Ashes Test on internet auction sites. 

The worlds most famous cricket club, based at Lords, is investigating members for breaching club rules by reselling their alloted tickets, often for a large profit. 

Iain Wilton, MCC spokesman, said that the club took a very dim view of the situation. The rules are very clear on how people should behave with their allocated tickets, he said. 

MCC members were invited to apply for 110,000 tickets to the England and Australia Test at Lords from July 21 and to two one-day Internationals. 

Although the MCC usually offers two tickets per member, demand was so high that many successful applicants received just one ticket. 

Some members, however, have now started to auction their tickets on internet sites such as eBay for anything up to ? 350 each, up to 10 times the legitimate price. 

The MCC sent letters to its members last week warning them that the resale of tickets would incur stringent penalties. The club has set aside a fund to buy back the tickets and trace the culprits. 

Offenders face a membership ban of between one and two years and the suspension of their ticket-buying privileges for five years. About 10 cases are being investigated, although no disciplinary action has yet been taken. 

Wilton said: We keep an eye on a number of auction sites and unofficial sources where Lords tickets may end up. We have set aside a record amount to buy up a number of those that become available in that way so we can track them back by their seat numbers. 

Tickets for the tsunami relief match ? MCC XI vs an international XI Tuesday have also found their way to eBay. It is deplorable that people are seeking to line their pockets from a charitable cause, Wilton said.

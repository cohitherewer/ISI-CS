 Sharapova makes last 4

Rome: Maria Sharapova closed in on the world No.1 spot when she reached the Rome Masters semi-finals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Elena Bovina on Friday. 

The 18-year-old top-seeded Russian will replace Lindsay Davenport at the top if she wins this week. 

Sharapova was rarely stretched. She simply outgunned her compatriot, moving her around the court with low, flat groundstrokes and firing back serve return winners to break in the sixth and eighth games and take the first set. 

Having held off three break points against her serve early in the second set, Sharapova lashed a return down the line to go 4-2 up, then held to close out the contest. 

A year ago Id just turned 17 and a lot has happened since then, said Sharapova, who lost in the third round at Rome in 2004. Having a year to work hard physically has made a big difference. 

Strength-wise I feel a lot stronger on the court. I can play more matches in a row without getting tired, which is important on clay, where you often get tough matches. 

Im really excited about being in the semi-finals. Its been a great tournament so far, though obviously it gets harder from here, she said.

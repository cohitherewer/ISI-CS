 Kapil slams support staff

Mumbai: Former captain Kapil Dev on Monday took at a dig at Team India support staff. 

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a promotional event here, the former national coach criticised the physio and trainer, saying: We have a lot of support staff, but still we see so many injuries. I am surprised. 

He said fielding and running between the wickets are areas the team needs to improve upon. 

Cricket is a team game. The players need to be committed. When the team starts to lose we find that commitment is lacking. 

They need to stay committed for 6-7 hours (to be successful), Kapil said, adding: Can we doubt the talent of a Dhoni or a Sehwag? But when they are losing there would be question marks over their commitment. 

On captaincy, the former captain said Sourav Ganguly had done very well in the last five years. 

When you replace him you have to take precautions. (PTI)

 Twelve swimmers appeal

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Twelve of the 13 sub-junior state swimmers suspended for being overaged have appealed to the BASA president to review the decisions against them. All of them have contested the medical and forensic reports on the basis of which they have been suspended and submitted necessary documents to argue their case. 

Our panel has called them for a hearing on Wednesday afternoon? if any case seems genuine, well go back to the doctors who conducted their tests for a review, said BASA secretary Ramanuj Mukherjee. Incidentally, 14 junior swimmers have also been found overaged but the BASA hasnt yet found the time to intimate them about the suspensions.

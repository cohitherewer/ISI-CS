Receiving the Kartick Bose Lifetime Achievement Award from association president Jagmohan Dalmiya, Premangshu Chatterjee ? a left-arm medium pacer of repute, who played for Bengal in 26 matches between 1946-47 and 1959-60 and skippered the state in four ? said it was a special award and great that I am receiving a trophy named after my guru Kartick Bose.

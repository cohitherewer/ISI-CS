 Favourites fail to justify odds 

 STAR RACER

 Royal Bounty, a better rated horse but tested over trips beyond sprints, was expected to be at disadvantage because of the sharpness of the trip. However, the Bee?s Prospector-Auspicious Girl son simply trounced the field, including the favourite, Karan?s Choice, who was never a factor when ridden by C. Alford.

 Alford also let down a large following on trainer Harvinder Singh Bath-trainee Allenby ? a stablemate of Karan?s Choice, In the Brogue Handicap. The Excalibur?s Lake-Olympic Way-son was also given a poor ride by Alford against the winner Sergeant Slipper, an Errol Bhungard-trainee who was also ridden by Chisty.

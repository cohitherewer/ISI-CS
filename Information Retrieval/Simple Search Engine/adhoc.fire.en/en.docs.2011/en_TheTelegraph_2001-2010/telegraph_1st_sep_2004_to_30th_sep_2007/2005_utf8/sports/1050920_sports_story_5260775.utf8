The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Water continues to drip

 - Bhupathi blames it on high humidity 

A STAFF REPORTER

 A volunteer does the cleaning act at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday 

Calcutta: Water continued to drip on the courts and off it again, from the air-conditioning ducts. 

This, despite assurances by the organisers that there was no problem as such and whatever little there was had been rectified. 

The leakage was noticed as early as Thursday. 

On Monday, while the first singles match between Villmarie Castellvi of Puerto Rico and Emmanuelle Gagliardi was being played on Court I and the first doubles on Court II, water dripped and the courts had to be wiped dry after every couple of games. 

Queried, Mahesh Bhupathi said: This is no problem at all. I have seen this happen with indoor courts ? even at Paris indoors, the biggest of them all. 

This happens when the humidity level goes up, resulting in condensation, he elaborated. 

And how do you tackle it? Simple, you just wipe the water away, pat came the reply from Bhupathi.

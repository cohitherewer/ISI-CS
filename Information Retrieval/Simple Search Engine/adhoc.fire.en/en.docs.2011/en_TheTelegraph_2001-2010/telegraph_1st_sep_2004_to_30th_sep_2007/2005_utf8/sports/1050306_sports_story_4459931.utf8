 PCB returns 4,500 tickets

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Saturday it had returned 4,500 tickets to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) following a lukewarm response for the Mohali Test starting on Tuesday. 

?We returned 4,500 tickets to the Indian Board on Wednesday so that they have ample time to sell them. Out of the 7,500 tickets received from BCCI, only 3,000 were bought by people interested in going to Mohali,? PCB general manager (cricket operations) Subhan Ahmed said from Lahore. 

He said the Pakistan spectators appeared keen in visiting other Indian cities. 

Legal battle 

Meanwhile, in Kharar, a city court adjourned to Monday a case challenging the issue of complimentary passes for the first cricket Test between India and Pakistan in Mohali. After hearing the arguments of rival counsellors, additional civil judge Poonam Ratti of the Kharar Sub-Divisional Court, posted the case for Monday. (PTI)

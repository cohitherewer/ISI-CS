 Monterey (California): The Laguna Seca track for the US Grand Prix is unsuitable for motorcycle racing, world champion Valentino Rossi says.

 Speaking after the first day of practice for Sunday?s race, being held in the US for the first time since 1994, Rossi, the championship leader said: ?The track was quite dangerous in many points, but some are very, very dangerous. The level of security is not very good, certainly not as good as the other tracks we go to. If they don?t change it, I don?t think we will be able to race here again.?

 For many riders, including Rossi, this was their first exposure to the tortuous, up-and-down 2.238-mile road course for the eighth round of the MotoGP world championship.

 London: South Korea?s Park Ji-sung has completed his transfer to Manchester United from PSV Eindhoven after being granted a British work permit, the Premier League club said.

 Park, a member of the Korean side that reached the last four in the 2002 World Cup, signed a four-year contract, United said on their website.

 The 24-year-old, who obtained his work permit in midweek, trained for the first time with the United squad on Friday. United are preparing for a pre-season tour of Asia. 

 London: Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze has been voted Manchester United?s Player of the Year by fans.

 Heinze, who took a third of the votes by 17,000 United fans, is the first defender and first non-European player to win the trophy named after the late United manager Matt Busby.

 The 27-year-old, who helped Argentina to the Confederations Cup final against Brazil in Germany last month, beat young strikers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, United said on their official website.

 Singapore: The London 2012 Games will be better following the axing of baseball and softball from the Olympic programme declared International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge here on Saturday.

 ?We want quality over quanity,? said Rogge following the closure of the 117th IOC session.

 Baseball?s failure to have the best players compete in the games and doping problems with the sport caused their expulsion, said Rogge. Softball suffered because it was not universal enough.

 But he did not close the door on the two sports returning, perhaps as early as 2016 Games.

 Hyderabad: India stormed into the semi-finals of the first Asian women?s kabaddi championship, topping pool A with six points here on Saturday.

 After Bashing Thailand in the first round on Friday, the hosts defeated Bangladesh 51-21 and trounced Korea 44-31 in the two matches played on Saturday.

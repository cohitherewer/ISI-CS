The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania Mirza was brilliant at Big W

 - Fresh from Wimbledon triumph, Bhupathi visits the city for September meet 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi on Tuesday rated Sania Mirzas performance at Wimbledon as brilliant. She had a great tournament, despite losing in the second round, Bhupathi said. 

According to Bhupathi, temperament is Sanias strength and her match against Svetlana Kuznetsova proved what she is capable of. We all saw what tennis Sania played on that day? You have to remember that she lost to world No. 5 which is a definitely a creditable achievement for her. 

After Sania, Globosport, Bhupathis sports management company, is on the look out for more promising youngsters to lend a supporting hand. 

Bhupathi said that he would have liked to support Vivek Shokeen, Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Sanam K. Singh, but they already have AITA sponsorship. 

Bhupathi, who won his eighth Grand Slam title on Sunday, is in no mood to revise his target of 10 Grand Slams in the career. 

I have stepped closer to my goal and there is no question of revising my target, he said. 

After this win, I have answered my critics and proved that I am not more focussed on business and tennis remains my first love and priority, Bhupathi stated. 

Bhupathi said he wants to play with Mary Pierce in the US Open too, and then think of the future. Mary is basically a singles player and she is back after quite a big injury lay-off? Now if she stays well we will play mixed doubles together. 

Bhupathi also wants to continue with his new doubles partner Martin Damn for long, after Todd Woodbridges retirement. To get the chemistry right, we will play five tournaments starting with the Stuttgart Open, prior to the US Open, he said. 

But he hasnt decided on, who will be their coach. I dont know, who will be our coach. I will decide that after having discussions with Martin, Bhupathi said.

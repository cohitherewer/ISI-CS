 Gatlin back to winning ways

Rome: Olympic 100 metres champion Justin Gatlin returned to winning ways with victory in 9.96 seconds at the Rome Golden Gala on Friday. 

In the absence of Jamaicas world record-holder Asafa Powell, Gatlin won by a tenth of a second ahead of Ghanas Aziz Zakari. Zakari beat Gatlin to the line in the Paris Golden League meeting. 

After two Golden League meetings, three remain in contention for the $ 1 million jackpot ? Russian long jumper Tatyana Lebedeva, French 100m runner Christine Arron and American 400m hurdler Lashinda Demus. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand off to winning start

 - Linares MEET 

 Anand 

Linares: World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand started his campaign in the Linares Super Grandmasters chess tournament with a victory over Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria. 

Top-rated Gary Kasparov of Russia tried hard to break through the defences of Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan but had to settle for a draw in another keenly contested game of the day. The match between Britain?s Michael Adams and Hungarian Peter Leko petered out to a tame draw. 

The category-20 event is being played on a double round-robin basis with seven players. 

As things stand now, Anand, Kasparov, Topalov and Leko share the lead with one point each. But Anand?s ?plus one? means the Indian is effectively in sole lead after playing only one game. 

Anand was simply at his best against Topalov even though the latter was on a high after he defeated Michael Adams in the first round. Playing white, Anand employed his trademark English attack against the Sicilian Nazdorf and maintained his stronghold right through the game. 

For major part of the game, Topalov looked like contesting Anand move for move. But once white got a substantial advantage, the Bulgarian proved no match.

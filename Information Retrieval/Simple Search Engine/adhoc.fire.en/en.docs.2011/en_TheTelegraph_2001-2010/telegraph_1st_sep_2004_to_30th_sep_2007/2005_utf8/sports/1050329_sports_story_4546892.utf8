The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India lucky to get a point vs Germany

Kuala Lumpur: India narrowly escaped defeat, managing to hold Germany 1-1 in the six-nation junior hockey tournament here. 

The Prabodh Tirkey-led Indian team conceded the lead in the 18th minute and trailed for most part as the Europeans dominated the game. India equalised against the run of play in the 66th minute when a Sandeep Singh strike earned them a point. 

India, the defending champions, had won 3-1 against South Korea in their first game. 

The first half of the India-Germany game saw heavy rains lashing the turf, making it difficult for the players. Action was confined mostly to midfield with the Germans having the better of exchanges. 

Germany, who lost 3-4 to England on Sunday, went ahead midway through the opening session through a penalty-corner conversion. 

India came under heavy pressure after change of ends. The Germans displayed exquisite stickwork and toyed with their opponents. 

Just when it seemed India would lose, Sandeep converted a penalty corner.

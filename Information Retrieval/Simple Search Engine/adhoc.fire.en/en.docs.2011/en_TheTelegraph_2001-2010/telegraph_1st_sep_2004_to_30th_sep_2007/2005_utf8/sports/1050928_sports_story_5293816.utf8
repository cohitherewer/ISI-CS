 Clijsters ready for more action

 - LUXEMBOURG OPEN 

Luxembourg: Kim Clijsters is looking forward to a cosy return to action after winning the US Open, although she said it is a wrench to leave home. 

The 22-year-old Belgian, who has not played since taking her first Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadow this month, leads the field in the Luxembourg Open ? a venue that holds special memories for her. 

I love this (tournament). This is me more than anything else. I love playing in a small environment ? its more cosy, said Clijsters who won her first WTA tour title there in 1999. 

I feel good, I definitely needed the time off, although it would have been nice to have a couple more weeks but thats life, said Clijsters. 

It was very hard for me to start packing again because I was getting settled at home. 

Former world No. 1 Clijsters will open her challenge for an eighth tour title of the season on Wednesday. 

I havent done much since the US Open, she said. I have been pretty busy, I have received a lot of mail and had to respond and send out lots of posters and cards. 

But I have been hitting for a week now and trying to get back into some sort of routine because I need to play well at tournaments, added Clijsters, who reiterated her decision to retire at the end of next year. 

Clijsters also confirmed that she would continue to go it alone after splitting from coach Marc de Hous just one week after her victory over Mary Pierce in New York.

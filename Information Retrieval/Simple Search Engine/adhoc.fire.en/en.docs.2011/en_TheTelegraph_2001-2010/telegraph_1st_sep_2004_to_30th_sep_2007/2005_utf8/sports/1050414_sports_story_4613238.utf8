Mumbai: India?s women cricketers received a rousing welcome at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport on their return, following an impressive run to reach the final of the World Cup at South Africa. 

Indian eves, led by Mithali Raj, reached the final for the first time, but suffered a 98-run loss at the hands of the experienced Australians, who annexed the title for a record fifth time. 

Raj said the loss was unfortunate but hoped the team would cope up with it and perform better in future. 

?It was very unfortunate to lose in the final. But I hope the team will leave the past behind and perform much better in future tournaments,? Mithali told reporters after the team?s arrival here Tuesday night. 

?I think we played well overall in the World Cup but somehow failed to maintain our performance in the final,? she said, adding, the team was done away by the tough and experienced Australians. 

She pinpointed fielding as one area of the game in which the squad was lagging behind. 

?It was a dream come true for the team members in reaching the final. Many expected us to reach the semis, but we exceeded expectations by reaching the final,? Mithali said at a function on Wednesday evening. 

?Our spinners did very well even on those pace-friendly pitches, with three of them in the top five of the wicket takers? list. But fielding is one area which we need to improve.? 

?In most of the matches we chased small targets, but in the final we lost our way chasing in excess of 200. We restricted australia in the first 30 overs, but then could not sustain it.? 

Women?s Cricket Association of India (WCAI) secretary Shubhangi Kulkarni expressed her happiness that the team became the first from Asia to reach a women?s World Cup final. 

She also said the ICC has given the WCAI an extension of one years time to merge with the BCCI.

 Brazil farewell for Romario

Rio de Janeiro: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has included 13 uncapped players for next week?s friendly at home to Guatemala and recalled 39-year-old Romario for a farewell appearance. 

?He will start the game and play for at least the first few minutes,? said Parreira. ?It?s a tribute to one of Brazilian football?s great players.? 

Romario, who scored five goals as Brazil won the 1994 World Cup with a team also coached by Parreira, last played for his country in a World Cup qualifier away to Uruguay in 2001.He currently plays for Rio de Janeiro?s Vasco da Gama. 

Parreira was forced to pick only home-based players for the game, which is not being played on a Fifa international date and has been arranged to celebrate the 40th anniversary of a Brazilian television station. 

Despite not being able to call on any of Brazil?s top player, such as Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, Parreira said he was spoilt for choice when picking the side.

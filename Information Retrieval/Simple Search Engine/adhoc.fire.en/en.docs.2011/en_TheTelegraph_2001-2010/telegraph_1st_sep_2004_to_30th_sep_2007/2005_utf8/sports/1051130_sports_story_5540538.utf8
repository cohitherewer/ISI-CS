The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pawar plays down Chappell gesture

 - Sourav one of the best allrounders country has seen 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Ranbir Singh Mahendra-led dispensation was unmoved on the issue of Greg Chappells middle-finger gesture on the eve of the fifth ODI between India and South Africa here on Friday. The new-look BCCI, under Sharad Pawar, has gone the same way. 

When the issue was raised during his first press conference as BCCI president, Pawar described it as insignificant. There are some discussions on the issue here and there, but we should not give them too much importance, he said on Tuesday evening. 

Insisting that the crowd at the Eden is still patriotic and cricket-loving, Pawar revealed that he had a chat with Team India players in Mumbai on Monday night and none has said anything about it (crowds behaviour at the Eden). 

When asked about Sourav Gangulys future, the new BCCI chief said: Hes one of the best allrounders the country has seen. However, it will be the selectors decision (about his inclusion in the team). 

Pawar also spelt out his list of priorities, which included offering fresh contracts to the players, settling TV rights issues, finding a suitable sponsor as well as bringing transparency and professionalism in the functioning of the BCCI. The possibility of appointing a CEO is not ruled out, he said. 

We will also form a committee to look into the preparations related to next years Champions Trophy, he added. The union minister also said that infrastructure at Test and ODI centres should be improved. 

Pawar, however, refused to agree that the results signalled the end of (Jagmohan) Dalmiya era in the BCCI. 

He (Dalmiya) has such a long experience in ICC matters and Ill definitely seek his support whenever needed, Pawar, who is going to represent India at the ICC, said. Perhaps, I am going to meet him over a cup of tea and well talk of cricketing matters, he added. 

On Dalmiyas allegations that political and government pressure played a role in his victory, Pawar said: I have been in public life for 40 years. I have been heading the Maharashtra Olympic Association for 30 years and some of my predecessors in the sport like Madhavrao Scindia and Ranbir Singh Mahendra were in politics. I dont think political affiliations have coloured their functioning.

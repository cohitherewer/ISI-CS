 Astle, McMillan get the axe

Wellington: New Zealand has axed veterans Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan from the team for the first two one-day Internationals against Sri Lanka over the New Year. 

The pair have struggled for form in recent series and have been replaced by the uncapped James How, who captains the Central Districts first-class side, and Peter Fulton from Canterbury. 

Stephen Fleming returns to captain the side after missing two matches against Australia due to a benign tumour which had to be removed from his jaw. He has been cleared to play despite chipping a bone in his finger on Wednesday. 

The squad ? Stephen Fleming (captain), Daniel Vettori (vice captain), Andre Adams, Shane Bond, Chris Cairns, Peter Fulton, Jamie How, Hamish Marshall, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Scott Styris, Lou Vincent. (Reuters)

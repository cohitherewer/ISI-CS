The Telegraph - Calcutta

We must exploit India?s strength in numbers

- Not even one percent of the 1 billion population has access to sports facilities

If I were the king of the Indian sports world the 

first thing I would do, would be to have a common cast iron constitution drawn 

up by experts for all sports associations.

After that, no changes should be allowed. Amendments 

to the constitution, ?unanimously? pushed through by the group in power, are amongst 

the weapons used by office bearers to extend terms in office and in other spheres 

of activity.

At times they are bold enough to disregard the norms 

of natural justice. Voting strength must be linked to the amount of activity of 

the sport in each state. It is despicable that a state without any major sporting 

events, enjoy the same weightage as the major states who have flourishing activity.

This change would, in some measure knock out the endemic 

disease of trading votes for trips abroad and allocation of prestigious events. 

Of course, there are many other areas, the least of which is the term in office, 

which is at times subverted by creating new posts or change in nomenclature of 

office. In brief, the associations can certainly be independent but they must 

work within an approved framework set up by the government with no exceptions. 

An organisation like SEBI should enforce transparency, accountability and financial 

propriety.

With a sound constitution in place I would move towards 

sports facilities. We must learn to think big. 

I would build hundreds of sports centres all over 

the country, especially in schools, colleges and universities. If money is in 

short supply as is mostly the case we can concentrate on disciplines, which require 

minimal equipment such as athletics, basketball, football etc. inter-school, inter-collegiate, 

inter-varsity and inter-state competitions must be revived and made compulsory. 

These competitions will become the nurseries of the future.

India?s strength lies in its numbers, and it infuriates 

me to hear the oft-repeated phase ?One billion and not a single medal.?

(One lone silver was the tally in the Athens Olympic 

game) when not even one percentage point has access to sports facilities. Considering 

the circumstances Indian standards are reasonably high while the achievement of 

medal winners can be termed as close to miraculous

Secondly, I would integrate sport with the education 

system and ensure that weightage is given for proficiency in sport for admission 

to colleges and universities.

 Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore

We live in an age of specialisation and standards 

are so high that, it is not possible to achieve excellence in sport as well as 

obtain marks, which will get admissions to good colleges. 

A core syllabus reducing the number of subjects should 

be drawn up for sports persons, and sports should be treated as a subject. This 

would entice a large number of average students to participate actively in sports. 

A minimum level of sporting activity should be made 

compulsory in schools and colleges. The beleaguered quotation ?The Battle of Waterloo 

was won in the playfields of Eton amp; Harrow? has much substance. The spin-offs 

of a massive sporting movement are monumental. Good health, discipline and character 

of the younger generation can change the face of our nation. These values are 

the backbone of society and cannot be taken lightly.

I would enroll past players give them back their pride 

and respect with suitable salaries and post them to sports centres to participate 

and share their experience and knowledge with youngsters.

For Olympic medals, to the handful who have managed 

to buck the system and get close to international levels, I would get foreign 

coaches who have produced world champions. They know the route to the top, and 

it is stupid for us to try and find the way when we can learn it from someone 

who already knows the route. By this method we would save both time and money.

Broadly speaking, the aim should be for sports to 

be pyramid based and not the reverse as it is now.

Olympic medals do not jump out of a conjurer?s hat. 

First, the raw material has to be melted in a sizeable stream, then cast and then 

polished by the guru?s.

But where are the guru?s? Ego?s must be shelved, and 

the great players of yesteryear most of whom are sullen and disillusioned must 

be brought back into the fold to coach in their disciplines and share their know-how. 

At pre-national levels they are a must. There must 

be a confluence of administrators and past and current leading players. The diverse 

nature of our country can cater to all disciplines and the large numbers we enjoy 

are the strengths we must exploit. For instance the foothills of the Himalayas 

can become a nursery of distance runners. We must take advantage of the economic 

boom, think big and catch up with the great sporting powers of the world.

One reads that India?s economy is the fourth largest 

in the world after the US, China and Japan, but in sports we are out of sight.

Happily, the government has woken up with meaningful 

grants to medal prospects, but we have to look beyond at the millions who do not 

get a chance. Glory in sports will add a new lustrous facet to the image of our 

great country and fire the imagination of the younger generation.

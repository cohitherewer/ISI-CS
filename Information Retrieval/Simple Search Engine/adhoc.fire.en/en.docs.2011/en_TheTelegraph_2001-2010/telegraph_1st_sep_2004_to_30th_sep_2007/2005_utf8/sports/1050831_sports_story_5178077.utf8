 Wright calls for a review

Harare: Zimbabwe, on the eve of their match against New Zealand, face another cry for their ouster and this time it has surprisingly come from former India coach John Wright. 

Wright, back in limelight as coach of the Rest of World team against Australia in Super Series in October, has asked the International Cricket Council to review the situation as Zimbabweans lurch from one disaster to another. 

Wright also questioned the prevalent infrastructure in Zimbabwe. 

Im not as much interested in the results as the strength of the games infrastructure in Zimbabwe, he was quoted as saying in a New Zealand daily. 

The crux of the matter is whether Zimbabwe have the development programmes and the resources to sustain their international presence. 

He termed Zimbabwe as very competitive till six or seven years ago, but now feels they have been unable to extricate themselves from the quagmire of disastrous performances. 

The former New Zealand captain said it served no purpose to promote a team which was losing so badly so consistently. 

I dont think its any good for any cricket team to be beaten so badly and so often as Zimbabwe have been lately, the confidence of the individuals has to be affected, and there comes a time where it almost becomes cruel, Wright said. 

Having said that, the results are just the tip of the iceberg. The real issues involve Zimbabwes capacity to improve and progress as a cricket nation, and maybe thats where the ICC should be playing a role. 

It cant be just allowed to carry on regardless, because failure will breed failure ? it wont help with development. 

Wright compared Zimbabwes plight with Bangladesh and found the latter to offer better hope in contrast. 

Bangladesh have the population base, a passion for the game, a decent budget and plenty of support from India, so they should be okay in the long term. Its hard to see them not making progress. 

But if thats not the case in Zimbabwe, then the ICC needs to have the tools and the commitment to review the situation. 

As for the Super Series, Wright said he was honoured to be appointed as coach and was looking forward to another opportunity to stand up to Australia.

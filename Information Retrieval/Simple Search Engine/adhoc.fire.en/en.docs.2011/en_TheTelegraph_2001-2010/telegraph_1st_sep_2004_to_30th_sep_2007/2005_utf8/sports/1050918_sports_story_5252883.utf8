 Jeev tied fourth

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh birdied three of the four par-fives en route to a card of two-under 70 to be tied fourth and one shot off the leader, after the third round of the 200 million yen Ana Open on the Japan golf tour. 

Jeev, now nine-under 207 at the par-72 Sapporo Golf Club Wattsu course along with three others, will play in second group as he eyes his maiden title in Japan. 

The lead is shared by three players, including defending champion Chawalit Plaphol, who with his 68 is now 10-under. 

The other co-leaders are Tomohiro Kondo, who double-bogeyed on the back nine, and Hidemasa Hoshnino. 

Jeev, after first two rounds of 67 and 70, is well-placed to be in contention on the final day. 

On the third day, Jeev birdied the par-fives at fifth, ninth and 17. He was one-under for both front and back nine. He bogeyed the par-five at the 12th. His other birdie came on the par-four 10th and the bogey on seventh. 

Both bogeys were three-putts, much to his annoyance and he needed 29 putts to go through the round. On each of the par-fives he was three on, but three times he single putted for birdies and once three-putted for a bogey. 

Co-leader Keiichiro Fukabori, whose 10-under 62 helped him to a total of 10-under for two days after a first round of par 72, had another par round with two birdies and two bogeys. (PTI)

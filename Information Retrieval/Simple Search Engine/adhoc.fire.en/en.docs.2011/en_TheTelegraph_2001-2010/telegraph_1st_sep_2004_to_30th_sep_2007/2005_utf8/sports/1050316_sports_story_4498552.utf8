The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Inzy?s wicket is the key: Balaji

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta: Lakshmipathy Balaji thinks Inzamam-ul Haq is the toughest to bowl at in the Pakistan camp and the rival captain?s wicket will be the key in the Eden Test. 

?Inzy (Inzamam-ul Haq) and (Yousuf) Youhana are certainly the toughest players to bowl at in this Pakistan team. (Kamran) Akmal has also turned out to be another difficult customer. 

?But if I?m asked to pick only one, it has to be Inzy. His wicket is the key for us,? Balaji told reporters on Tuesday. 

Balaji, however, doesn?t want to read too much into his success against Pakistan, saying: ?I always want to give 100 per cent, whether the match is against Pakistan or some other country.? 

Even the possibility of his maiden appearance at the Eden doesn?t rouse him much. 

?I?ve heard of the atmosphere here, but it?ll be just another game for me,? observed Balaji. 

Talking about the wickets, he felt: ?It looks like a compact wicket? the binding is good. I think it?ll help spinners from the third day.? 

He, though, stated that both teams have equal chance in the match. 

Balaji, who always looks up to Anil Kumble as ?a real fighter and an inspiration?, however, revealed that ?there?s some homework for Pakistan batsmen and I?m really looking forward to use it.? 

Shoaib Malik, meanwhile, said that he is improving on his wicketkeeping skills, adding another thrust to his allround ability. 

?Of late, I?m concentrating on wicketkeeping and that helps give an added edge to my batting,? Malik, whose bowling action came under scanner, said.

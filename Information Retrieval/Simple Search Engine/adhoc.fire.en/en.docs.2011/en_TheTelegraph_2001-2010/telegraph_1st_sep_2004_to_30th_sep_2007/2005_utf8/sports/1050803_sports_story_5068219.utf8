 Unhappy ones can leave, says Real coach

Madrid: Real Madrid coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo has opened the door to any players unhappy at the club, saying he only wants those that are fully committed to staying on next season. 

Anyone that isnt happy will have the opportunity to leave, the Brazilian told a Spanish sports daily. I dont want to see angry faces here. Everyone should be content because, if not, we will not be able to construct a winning team. 

Those players that dont like being on the bench are perfectly within their rights to say they want to play, but it is up to them to go out and look for another club. 

Luxemburgos remarks follow speculation about future of several players who have been threatened following recent signings. (Reuters)

 Wenger refuses to make peace

CHRISTOPHER DAVIES

Arsene Wenger insists he will continue to give his opinions about Chelsea and maintains he has nothing to apologise for in the wake of his war of words with their manager Jose Mourinho. 

The Chelsea manager put forward the offer of a mutual apology in an effort to end their exchanges but Wenger seems to be in no mood to smoke the pipe of peace and said: I dont know what I can apologise for. 

The Arsenal manager was amazed to hear Chelsea have a 120-page dossier on him. I will still give my opinion about Chelsea if I want to, said Wenger. 

Nothing will stop me doing that. We are not in a dictatorship. 

It was a personal attack and it was not involved with football. I respect Mourinho and everyone in the league and have never made a personal attack on anybody. 

There is never anything vicious about my statements. I just give an honest opinion but sometimes the competition is so ferocious the sensitivity about opinions is higher.

 Corner still awaits licence 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: About 2000 winners, including 71 Classics, and nearly a decades stiping experience make up an impressive bio-data for a race professional. Meet Robin Corner, who is in the city and may start his new innings as a horse trainer in RCTC from the winter season.

 Corner is, however, still waiting for his licence. I havent got the training licence yet, Corner told The Telegraph at the racecourse office on Wednesday. But having been part of the system at the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) for long, he understands such things take their usual course of time.

 Corner said: My experience in riding, and also being familiar with stable-management may find favour with stewards.

 Corners formal application, by the way, was cleared by the RCTC stewards on Tuesday, informed an insider. 

 Be it riding, stiping or training, what Corner wants is to remain close to horses. I love horses, I had two at home for myself and my son even after quitting riding, Corner signed off.

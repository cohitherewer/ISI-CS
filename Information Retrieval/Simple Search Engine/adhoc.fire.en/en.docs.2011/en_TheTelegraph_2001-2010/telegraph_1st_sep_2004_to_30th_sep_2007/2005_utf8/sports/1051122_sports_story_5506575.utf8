 Sourav plans to bat at No. 5

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Having captained East Zone to the Duleep Trophy final, Sourav Ganguly is bracing for a new challenge when he leads Bengal against Maharashtra in their Ranji Trophy opener, starting in Pune on Wednesday. 

While other members of his team left for the venue on Monday, Sourav will join them on Tuesday afternoon. 

The former India captain, however, said that he had no plans to change his batting order. I had batted at No. 5 in the Duleep Trophy. As of now, I have no plans to change it, he said at the Eden on Monday, after working out for about two hours. 

Talking about Bengals chances in the match, Sourav stressed that the players have got enough match practices since eight or nine of them were from Bengal in the Duleep matches. But Ranji Trophy is a new challenge and we are all looking for it with a positive frame of mind. 

Kanitkar to lead 

PTI adds from Pune: Hrishikesh Kanitkar was named on Monday as skipper of the Maharashtra squad to take on Bengal.

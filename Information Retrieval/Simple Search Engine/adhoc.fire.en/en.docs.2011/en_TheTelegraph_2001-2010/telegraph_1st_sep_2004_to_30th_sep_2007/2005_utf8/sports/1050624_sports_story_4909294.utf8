 Symonds leads Aussies to 266/5 

Chester-le-Street: Andrew Symonds and Damien Martyn put on 142 to lead Australia to 266 for five against England in Thursdays triangular series day-nighter. 

Symonds, playing his first game after being suspended for partying all night before the Australians opening fixture of the tournament, made 73 from 81 balls and Martyn ended on 68 not out. 

The world champions are seeking their first win of the triangular series while their hosts have won all three games. 

Symonds and Martyn came together after England, who won the toss, had hit back with two wickets for one run following a good start from Australia. 

They looked threatening on 95 for one after 20 overs but were soon 96 for three when Steve Harmison removed Ricky Ponting for 27. Andrew Flintoff then got Matthew Hayden next over for 39.

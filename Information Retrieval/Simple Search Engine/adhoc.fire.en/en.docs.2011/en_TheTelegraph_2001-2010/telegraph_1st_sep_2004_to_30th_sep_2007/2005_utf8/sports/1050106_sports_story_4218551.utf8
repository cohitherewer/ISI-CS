 Further tests for Malik on Monday 

 Malik?s action is okay now, feels Woolmer 

Sydney: Pakistan off-spinner Shoaib Malik will have his bowling action reassessed to get clearance to play in this month?s triangular one-day series in Australia, team coach Bob Woolmer said Wednesday. 

Allrounder Malik was cited for a suspect topspin action following a one-day series in Sri Lanka in October and has been tested by human movement specialists at the University of Western Australia in Perth. 

But Woolmer said Malik had left for Perth Wednesday to be re-tested with a view to getting cleared to bowl in the tri-series against Australia and the West Indies, getting underway later this month. 

?He went to Perth today,? Woolmer said after Pakistan?s nine-wicket loss to Australia in the last Test here. ?He?s been working on his action. We want to try and get him cleared before the one-day series. 

?He?s going for re-testing Monday. It?ll be interesting. We?ve been working on his action to try and correct it. I?ve watched him. And I cannot see any semblance of a throw at all, not one. 

?A genuine throw and a bowl with a slightly bent arm are two different things. Hopefully, the university in Perth will clear him.? 

Malik, who played in the second Test in Melbourne but did not bowl, missed the Sydney Test with split webbing.

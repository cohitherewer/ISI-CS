 Steinlen steals a march over Anzello 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Despite a five-month lay off from the track, Steinlen stole a march over the in-form hot-favourite, Anzello, in the 2,000m Monsoon Cup at the RCTC on Wednesday. Imran Chisty partnered the Daniel David-trainee by Excaliburs Lake out of Kinski.

 The race was run at a fair pace but it was the 13-kg difference at the weights which worked in favour of the lowlyweighted horse. The overnight rains also added to Anzellos woes as the underfoot condition of the race-track had become soft.

 The favourite dictated the terms till about 600m from home but he fought for a lost cause once Steinlen came abreast of him.

 The afternoon, in any case, belonged to the Daniel-Chisty combinations which reeled of a quadruple of wins apiece. Steinlen apart, Daniels prized youngster Pure Valour was also guided by Chisty to an exciting victory in the No Regrets Cup.

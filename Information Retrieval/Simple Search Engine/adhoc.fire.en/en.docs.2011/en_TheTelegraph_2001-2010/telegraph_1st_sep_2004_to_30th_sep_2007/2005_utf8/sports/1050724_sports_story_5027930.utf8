 Third gold for Jingjing

Montreal: Olympic champion Guo Jingjing of China continued her domination of the 3m springboard event on Friday, capturing her third consecutive world title ahead of teammate Wu Minxia. 

Guo recorded a five-dive total of 645.54, becoming the first woman diver to win the same event at three world championships. Wu took silver with 619.05 and Italys Tania Cagnotto the bronze (591.27). 

The day included a scary moment when Chelsea Davis of the US slammed face-first into the diving board. The 17-year-old was taken to hospital but tests showed no major injuries. Edith Van Dijk of The Netherlands took gold in the 25km open water event

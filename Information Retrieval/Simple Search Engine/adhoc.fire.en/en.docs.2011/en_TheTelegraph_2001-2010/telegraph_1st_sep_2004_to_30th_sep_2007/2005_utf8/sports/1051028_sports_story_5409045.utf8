The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I cannot be a winning captain without the team, says Dravid

 - I have a good relationship with Greg... I know where he comes from and he knows where I come from 

Q: Were you able to meet Mark Taylor, your ideal captain, during the Super Test in Sydney? 

A: Unfortunately, I couldnt. 

Q: After Tuesdays ODI in Nagpur, you revealed that promoting Irfan Pathan was Sachins idea. That seemed to be a way of thanking him publicly... 

A: Its a team game and people in the team must get credit... I mean, I cant be a winning captain without the team... The success will come from a team effort and Im realistic enough to understand that. In any case, I believe credit should be given where deserved. 

Q: Following the Sourav-Greg Chappell face-off have you (as captain) set out groundrules to ensure that even if theres a difference of opinion, nothing comes out of the dressing room? 

A; I have a good relationship with Greg... I know where he comes from and he knows where I come from... Hes straight and direct... (After a pause) Some of the things which recently became public, didnt come from the team... The leaks were from outside, not within the dressing room, and its disappointing. 

Q: Did the failure to consistently score big in Zimbabwe and the Super Series in Australia put you under pressure in the lead-up to Nagpur? 

A: I wanted to do well and, yes, wasnt happy that I hadnt scored in some games. At the end of the day, Im a batsman and my job is to get runs... Thats how Im going to be judged... Its nice that I scored an unbeaten 85. 

Q: Was the impending birth of your son (Samit) a distraction during the three Super Series ODIs in Melbourne? 

A: My wife and I had thought the planning was fine and that the baby would be born during the early part of this series... As it turned out, I was far away (in Sydney) and couldnt wait to get back home. As for the Super Series, we (World XI) got beaten by the better team and Im not making any excuse. 

Q: Has fatherhood changed you? 

A: (Laughs again) Have just been a father for over two weeks... Dont know. 

Q: Did you choose your sons name or is it the result of a joint effort? 

A: Like most things in a family, its a joint effort! 

Q: To return to the Super Series, did everybody in the World XI give hundred per cent? 

A: Everyone tried... Its possible that some 20 per cent (of motivation) wasnt there because we werent playing for our country... Had we been together for a month, we would have been pretty much unbeatable. It was all over by the time we got used to what was happening. 

Q: Now that you arent a stop-gap captain, will you have the time to read books? 

A: I love reading... Thats how I switch-off... Helps me come back emotionally charged and not become stale... A switch-off time is needed as the batteries have to be recharged... Physically, one does get to rest. In much the same way, the emotional and mental side also needs to be looked at... Books are to continue figuring in the time and space I have for myself. 

[Dravid is currently finding time for Bob LaMontes Winning the NFL Way.] 

Q: Nowadays, theres at least one rookie in about every series. What do you tell the newcomers? 

A: That they must not worry if theyre nervous or overawed as I was probably even more overawed and more nervous when I first got picked for India (early 1996)... I tell them to enjoy the challenge... Today, the environment is tougher. 

Q: How? 

A: Because the scrutiny is that much more. The last few years have seen the emergence of so many TV networks and publications... Earlier, the pulls and pressures werent that much and I dont know whether I would have been able to handle what the present-day cricketers face from the very beginning. I admire them. 

Q: Is a good beginning to a series half the job done? 

A: (Laughs yet again) One-twelfth of the job has been done... 

Q: The final question: Given a chance, would you do something differently? 

A: Definitely, because one keeps learning... If I actually had to start all over again, my approach to fitness would be different... Its from the late 1990s that we got professional about training and gym work and... Its not that, as a youngster, I didnt pay attention to fitness but no structure was in place. Today, when I go to the NCA (in Bangalore), its nice to see youngsters train in a systematic manner. If we had the same facilities and knowhow, perhaps a difference could have been made.

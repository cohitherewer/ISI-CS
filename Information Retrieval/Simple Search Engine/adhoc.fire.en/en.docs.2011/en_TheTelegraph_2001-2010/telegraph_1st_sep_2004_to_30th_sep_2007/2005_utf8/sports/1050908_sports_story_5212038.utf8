The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ponting, Smith wont be alone

 - Captains invited for Oct. 11 conclave will be guests during Super Test too 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Of the ten elite cricket captains, Ricky Ponting and Graeme Smith will be the only ones to feature in next months Australia versus World XI Super Series ? Ponting in both the three ODIs and the first-ever Super Test; Smith in the latter alone (as captain). 

The other eight, though, are still going to be invited for the six-day Super Test, which begins three days after the annual captains conclave (on October 11), in Sydney itself. 

The ODIs, in Melbourne, will be gone through on October 5, 7 and 9. 

Yes, the (eight) captains are going to be our guests during the Super Test as well, International Cricket Council (ICC) general manager Brendan McClements told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

McClements is also the Super Series tournament director. 

The invitee-captains expected to be in Sydney are: Habibul Bashar (Bangladesh), Michael Vaughan (England), Sourav Ganguly (India), Stephen Fleming (New Zealand), Inzamam-ul Haq (Pakistan), Maravan Atapattu (Sri Lanka), Shivnarine Chanderpaul (West Indies) and Tatenda Taibu (Zimbabwe). 

Given that he was furious at being overlooked, its to be seen whether Inzamam will stay on for the historic Super Test. 

Incidentally, edition No. 2 of the ICCs annual awards is also going to be held on October 11, some hours after the captains have met the world bodys brass. 

The agenda, one understands, hasnt been finalised but a feedback on the experimental changes in ODIs is bound to figure rather prominently. 

Except Chanderpaul, the remaining nine captains have already been exposed to the changes ? either while leading the national side or captaining Asia/Africa. 

Other items may include: The amended Code of Conduct, continuing problem with over rates, doping policy and the proposed change ? extending the cycle by a year ? in the second half of the ICCs ten-year programme. 

The 2006 captains conclave should be in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy in India.

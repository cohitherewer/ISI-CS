 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

London: Olympique Lyon missed a penalty but still trounced Real Madrid 3-0 in a stunning start to the Champions League group stage, as holders Liverpool ground out a 2-1 win at Real Betis on Tuesday. 

Europes elite looked short of top form as last seasons runners-up AC Milan needed a late flourish to beat Fenerbahce 3-1, 10-man Inter won only 1-0 at Slovak outsiders Artmedia and big-spending Chelsea edged Anderlecht 1-0 in London. 

Elsewhere, PSV Eindhoven beat Schalke 04 1-0, Olympiakos Piraeus went down 1-3 at home to Rosenborg Trondheim and a late goal gave Rangers a 3-2 victory over 2004 champions Porto. 

But the place to be for drama was the Stade Gerland where Lyon, the competitions top-scorers last season, carried on where they had left off with a three-goal blast in the opening half-hour. 

Norwegian John Carew, Brazilian Juninho and Frenchman Sylvain Wiltord ? rounding off a superb move from the halfway line ? all scored as Lyon tore Reals rickety defence to shreds. 

It could have been worse as Juninho missed a penalty he was fortunate to be awarded just before the break. 

Real, without suspended Brazil striker Ronaldo and injured France playmaker Zinedine Zidane, made a better fist of the second half but never looked like turning the game around. 

Lyons next opponents in Group F, Rosenborg, came out on top of a game with plenty of twists before Oyvind Storflor put the result beyond doubt in stoppage time. 

Olympiakos went in front courtesy of the first own goal of the night by Alejandro Lago. Per Ciljan Skjelbred levelled for the Norwegians, who went 2-1 up just after halftime when Dimitris Mavrogenidis put through his own net. 

Liverpool, who had to fight their way through all three qualifying rounds after their amazing final triumph in Istanbul in May, had clearly been well-briefed by their Spanish manager Rafael Benitez on what to do in Seville. 

Two goals up within 14 minutes, thanks to Frenchman Florent Sinama-Pongolle and Spaniard Luis Garcia, Benitezs men held on despite a second half strike by Arzu. 

Their victory, and the winning start by Chelsea, will add further spice to their clash in Group G at Anfield in a fortnights time. 

Chelsea had plenty of possession but needed a goalkeeping blunder by Daniel Zitka, allowing Frank Lampards shot to swerve past him, to earn the points. 

Anderlecht teenager Anthony Vanden Borre hit the post with a deflected shot but his team could not avoid a record eighth consecutive Champions League defeat. 

Milan were heading for a draw against Fenerbahce at San Siro until Brazil playmaker Kaka scored his second of the night after a brilliant solo run in the 87th minute. European Footballer of the Year Andrei Shevchenko finished the job with a tap-in two minutes later. 

Milans Group E rivals PSV, who they beat in last seasons semi-finals, secured their win with a powerful header by striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. 

Inter took an early lead in their Group H game in Slovakia through Julio Cruz but failed to kill off a team appearing in Europes flagship competition for the first time. 

Inter lost Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron to a second yellow card after 56 minutes ? for taking a free-kick before the referee had blown his whistle. 

The Italians return to San Siro later this month to host a Rangers side who snatched the points after Greek defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos headed an 85th minute winner. 

Meanwhile, Real Madrid captain Raul says his side has to learn from their mistakes after they were swept aside by Olympique Lyon. 

We knew that Lyon were a good side, the difference was they took their chances. Now we have a few days to study the areas we need to work on, Raul said. 

In football set pieces are very important and today, as against Celta, we conceded goals from them. We need to work on putting this aspect of our game right, said Raul 

There is still a long way to go and we hope this suffering will be a positive for us later on. 

Goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who saved a first half penalty, also recognised the need to work on the defence but did not believe the result was a fair reflection of the game. 

Anyone who didnt see the game would think it was a mad result, said Casillas. 

But no one needs to say anything to us because we are also very upset about it. Our luck will change though, we just had a tremendous amount of bad luck. 

Coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo thought his team played better than they had at the weekend. 

Luxemburgo can look forward to the return of injured France midfielder Zinedine Zidane and Brazilian striker Ronaldo who was serving the first game of a two-match ban. 

They are players who make a difference in a game, Luxemburgo added. (Reuters)

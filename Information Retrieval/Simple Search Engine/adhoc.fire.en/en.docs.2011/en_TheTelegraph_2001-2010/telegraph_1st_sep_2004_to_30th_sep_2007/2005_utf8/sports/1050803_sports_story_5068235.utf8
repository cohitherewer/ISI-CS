 Lanka cruise to victory

 - Dwayne Smiths resistance not enough 

 Maravan Atapattu en route to his 70 on Tuesday 

Dambulla: Sri Lanka subdued a late fightback by the West Indian lower-order to seal a 50-run victory in the IndianOil Cup here Tuesday. 

The hosts rode half-centuries by captain Maravan Atapattu (70) and Kumara Sangakkara (79) to post a challenging 241 for six but had to resist the brilliant pyrotechniques of allrounder Dwayne Smith before sailing through at the Rangiri International Stadium. 

Smith hit two sixes and nine fours in a defiant innings of 68 from 90 balls, the innings top score, and threatened, at least, to deny the Lankans their bonus point. 

The right-hander was involved in two vital partnerships, adding 46 runs with Denesh Ramdin (29) for the seventh wicket but more destructive was his 43-run stand with Deighton Butler (13 not out) that came in less than seven overs. 

Smiths innings came to a tame end when he played on to his stumps a Muttiah Muralidharan delivery in the 44th over. 

The Caribbeans were eventually all out for 191, two short of the target to deny the hosts a bonus point, in 45.1 overs. 

The second string West Indies side however were done in by the early jolts inflicted by speedster Farveez Maharoof, who returned with brilliant analysis of three for nine, and Dilhara Lokuhettige (two for 30). 

Muralidharans two for 46 was not his usual economical figures but the bowler to suffer the most from Smiths blade was Upul Chandana (one for 65). Sri Lanka now lead the table with 11 points followed by India who have seven. West Indies are yet to open their account. 

Sri Lanka at one time had reduced West Indies to 39 for five before the unexpected resistance came through Smith who made his highest-ever score. The tenor was set by new ball bowler Mahroof who bowled his 10 overs in one go. 

Mahroof took out the openers Xavier Marshall (8) and Ryan Ramdass (1) and then also accounted for Ricardo Powell (2) to leave the West Indies in tatters.

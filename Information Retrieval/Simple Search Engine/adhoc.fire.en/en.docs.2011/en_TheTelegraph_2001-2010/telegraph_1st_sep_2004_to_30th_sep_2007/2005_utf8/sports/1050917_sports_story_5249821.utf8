The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tollys woes continue 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: This is the worst of times for Tollygunge Agragami. Having been demoted from the National Football League last season, Tollygunge are now dangerously hovering over on the relegation zone in the CFL Premier Division too. 

They drew 1-1 with Ever-Ready at the East Bengal ground on Friday. With this verdict, Tollygunge are now on eight points after 11 matches, struggling at the place of the league table. 

George Telegraph, who were pointless after their first seven matches, won over Calcutta Port Trust at the Mohun Bagan ground in the other match. By virtue of this win, George pushed Tollygunge to the bottom by a point. One of the eight teams will be relegated. 

At the East Bengal ground, Tollygunge officials had some heated discussions with the referee Rathin Mukherjee after the match. The Mounted Police had to intervene and came to the referees rescue. Bhola Prasad for Tollygunge and Habib Ali of Ever-Ready found the nets.

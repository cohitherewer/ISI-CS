 SC go-ahead for Bagan elections

OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The fiercely fought legal battle among the office-bearers of Calcuttas Mohun Bagan Club ended Friday with the Supreme Court directing for elections to choose a new team of office bearers for the club. 

A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and G.P. Mathur directed that the Calcutta high court order mandating conducting elections in September would not be interfered with and that elections would be held as per the schedule ordered by the high court. However, the apex court directed the high court to order for audit of accounts of the club reportedly not done for about 20 years now. 

The only grievance of the petitioner (Srikrishna Shaw, treasurer) is that no direction by the high court for audit of the accounts of the club was made in the order. Without interfering in any manner with the direction of the high court for elections, we are of the view the high court should also issue appropriate orders for audit of the accounts, the judges directed in a brief order after hearing both the sides and made it clear we are not linking the audit of accounts to elections which should go on as per schedule.

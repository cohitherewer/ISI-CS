The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We have the nucleus for future: Paes

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Harsh Mankad and Prakash Amritraj were beaming with pride when they got the best possible compliment for their fine show in India?s Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Group I 5-0 conquest of Chinay. Skipper Leander Paes said he would have to consider playing only doubles for the rest of his Cup career if they continued to play as well as they did this weekend. 

?I am glad we now have the depth in singles play to support the world-class doubles team,? Paes said. ?From a bag of three singles players, we can choose the two who are physically and mentally in the best shape. We have the nucleus for the future in these two lads.? 

The Indian captain said the process of grooming the next generation of Cup players was already well under way. ?These guys have covered a lot of ground this weekend. It is up to them to get back on the tour and keep improving their rankings so that they are in good shape when we come together again for the semi-final at the end of April. 

?When the team got together for practice earlier in the week, I looked at them and told myself, ?they are so talented and the only way to lose is for them to beat themselves?. The most important thing this weekend was that they played to potential and didn?t drop a set along the way. I am proud of them,? Paes said. 

 ?It will be a tough decision to make again in April,? he said, indicating that he had not really thought of giving up Cup singles play. 

Mankad was modest. ?Anyone who thinks Leander is not our best singles player on grass is wrong. We are focused on becoming more solid players. I have a lot of work to do in terms of building my strength so that I can play five sets. 

Amritraj said: ?I was waiting to be given the responsibility (of leading the challenge)... I?m glad I was able to repay the trust shown in me.?

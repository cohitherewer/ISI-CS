 Venkatesh backs Sukhi

 S. Venkatesh 

New Delhi: Indian football captain S. Venkatesh Monday came out in support of beleaguered coach Sukhwinder Singh who received flak from the AIFF after the teams recent performances. 

I think Sukhwinder should continue. How can you expect anyone to deliver results in 10-20 days preparation, Venkatesh said on the sidelines of a press conference to announce a deal between AIFF and Zee Sports. 

He said: In 1998 he (Sukhwinder) did a fantastic job against UAE, then no one said he was bad and now in just 2-3 matches you judge his performace! 

Deal signed 

The AIFF and Zee Sports Monday signed a ten-year deal for exclusive telecast for all domestic and international football matches. The channel will telecast a minimum of 70 live matches in a year.

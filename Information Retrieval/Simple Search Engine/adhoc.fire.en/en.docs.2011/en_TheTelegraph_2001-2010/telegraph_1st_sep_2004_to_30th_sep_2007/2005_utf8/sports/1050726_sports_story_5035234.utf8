The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barua Academy from Sept. 1

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy will get rolling from September 1, albeit not in the manner the Grandmaster wanted it to. 

Barua had been granted a plot of land by the state government to set up his academy. 

I couldnt get the academy built up there because of paucity of funds and lack of sponsorship, so I have rented a house to start the academy, said Barua. 

Housed at 33B Hindustan Road, Baruas academy will take in a limited number of trainees (upto 16 years) on a first-come-first-served basis. Registration will begin on August 1, between 6.30 pm and 8.30 pm every working day at the academy.

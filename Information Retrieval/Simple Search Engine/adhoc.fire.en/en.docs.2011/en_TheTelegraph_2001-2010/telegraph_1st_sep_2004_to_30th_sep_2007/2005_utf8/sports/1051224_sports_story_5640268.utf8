 Mourinho apologises 

London: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has apologised to Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger for calling him a voyeur earlier this season. 

Mourinho made his comments in October, reacting to Wengers suggestion that champions Chelsea were suffering a dip in form after a draw with then-bottom club Everton and a League Cup defeat by Charlton Athletic. 

The Portuguese coach accused Wenger of having a real problem with us and said he is someone who likes to watch other people ? in English you say voyeur.

 Two-year extension for Warne

London: Shane Warne has signed a two-year contract extension at Hampshire with an option of a further two years, the English county said on Thursday. 

The 35-year-old Australian leg-spinner will continue as captain. 

However, Warne will miss a large chunk of next season as he will be playing in the Ashes Tests from July. The world record Test wicket-taker has retired from one-day Internationals. 

?It is a lengthy contract, he has signed for two years with an option of a rolling two years,? Hampshire spokesman John Hughes said. 

?He has bought a house in the Southampton area and is really committing himself to the county.? Warne joined Hampshire in 2000 and looks set to stay until he is 39. 

Fellow-Australian Simon Katich also returns to the Rose Bowl for a third spell this season. 

The left-handed batsman will be joined by South Africa-born England one-day batsman Kevin Pietersen, who has signed for Hampshire on a three-year contract after spending four prolific years with Nottinghamshire.

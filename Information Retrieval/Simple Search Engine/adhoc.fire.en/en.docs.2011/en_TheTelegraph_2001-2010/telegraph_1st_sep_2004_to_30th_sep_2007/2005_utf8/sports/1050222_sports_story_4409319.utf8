 Shandilya upset

Pune: In a major upset, double Asian Games gold medallist Ashok Shandilya of India suffered a 2-3 defeat at the hands of Myanmar?s Aung San Oo in a thrilling group C tie of the fourth Asian billiards championship here on Monday. 

However, defending champion Devendra Joshi and Saurav Kothari gave Indians reason to cheer with fluent 3-1 and 3-0 wins respectively in group A and group C ties. 

Shandilya got off to a dream start by bagging the opening frame which included a significant break of 97 in the 100-up best-of-five contest. 

Aung San, a double bronze medallist at the Busan Asian Games won the next frame to level the score, but Shandilya took the lead for the second time with a brilliant 96 break to set the stage for a fight back. 

Aung San came back brilliantly with an unfinished 100 in the fourth. Trailing 84-92 in the decider, Shandilya had his chance but lost position. Aung San, who unravelled a brilliant cannon off two cushions moments earlier, seized his opportunity and sealed a crucial win. (PTI)

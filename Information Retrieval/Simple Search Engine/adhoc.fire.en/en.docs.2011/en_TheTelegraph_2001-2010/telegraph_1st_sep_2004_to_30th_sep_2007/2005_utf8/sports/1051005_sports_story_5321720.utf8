 Kenya turned down

Nairobi: Test strugglers Bangladesh and Zimbabwe have both turned down an offer by Kenya to play ODIs against them, claiming their national sides needed a break. 

Kenya are keen to play top-quality opposition ahead of this months ICC International Cup semi-finals in Namibia. Although they have been assured of two three-day matches with the Zimbabwe A side, the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) had also requested for a one-dayer with the Zimbabwe national side.

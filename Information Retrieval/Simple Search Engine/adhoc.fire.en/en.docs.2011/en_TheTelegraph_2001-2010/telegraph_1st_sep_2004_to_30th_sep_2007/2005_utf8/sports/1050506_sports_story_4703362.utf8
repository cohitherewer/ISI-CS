The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Match not fixed, feels observer 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: An air of suspicion hung heavily on the Mohun Bagan-Tollygunge Agragami NFL match on Thursday, pointing to the fact that both teams might resort to unfair means in helping the three-time champions stay in the top tier. 

Acting on the move, the AIFF instructed referees inspector Ghayas-ul Haque and match commissioner B. Dingdoh to oversee the proceedings at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Mohun Bagans 4-0 rout of the opponents and Tollygunges abject surrender might have fuelled the speculation of a ?fixed match? in some corners, but the AIFF-appointed men gave both teams a clean chit. 

?I didnt seen anything suspicious (in the verdict). Its a normal game,? Haque said. 

Mohun Bagan players also insisted that everything was ?fair? in the match. ?Why is this question being raised. We played well and beat them comfortably,? said Noel Wilson. 

Meanwhile, Sunil Chhetri, the hattrick-man, dedicated the goals to his parents. 

Tollygunge coach Biswajit Das was also clueless to his teams show. ?I am very disappointed with the way they played. May be they were tired. Das said.

 Andreyan to take on ?Arising? 

 PRAVESH GUPTA

 Mumbai: Assessing the potential of each of the 17 runners in the line-up for Sunday?s mega event here, the McDowell Indian Derby, will be an arduous task. However, the four horses who make a strong claim for the whopping winner?s purse of about Rs 43 lakh are the filly Venus Arising, and her male challengers Andreyan, Aperitivo and Southern Regent.

 Venus Arising is the 7-4 ante-post favourite on the strength of her fluent Oaks victory, here, about a fortnight ago. She has maintained her good looks, composure and the form but it is almost 10 years that a filly ? Amazing Bay in 1995-96 season ? had recorded a classic double ? the Indian Oaks and the Indian Derby, both over 2,400m trips. 

 Two long distance races, dated in close proximity, take steam out of fair sex. History reveals that most of the winning fillies in the elite ?double? category, were hard put to win the Derby even after trouncing Oaks fields. Masculine power is, therefore, going to be a dominant factor in the 4.05 pm event on Sunday.

 Indian Derby has also eluded many a champion professionals. In the current line-up, only trainer Rashid Byramji can make a tall claim of saddling ten Derby winners against jockey Mallesh Narredu?s two. However, Byramji?s last winner in the super classic event was the great Elusive Pimpernel during the 1994-95 season. Advancing age and failing health has forced him to restrict his stable size to a manageable limit. But the maestro hasn?t lost his old magic which had transformed moderate purchases like Commanche, Squanderer, Manitou into champions.

 History would repeat itself if Byramji?s Andreyan wins Sunday?s Derby. In the mid-Eighties he had pushed Everynsky into the Bangalore Derby line-up after the horse?s two career starts. Everynsky did not disappoint after his two runs were spaced by four weeks. 

 Andreyan, too, has made his debut late and went on to stretch Foreever Elegance in the Bangalore Derby 11 days ago. The Derby may have come a week too early for him, yet the experience gained in Bangalore classic makes him a strong contender on Sunday.

 Aperitivo, the Calcutta Derby winner, is no pushover either. What the Vijay Singh-trainee may relish more than others is the sizzling pace at which the Derby is expected to be run. There are at least seven hot-footed horses in the big field to ensure this. The long Mahalaxmi-straight could also be his boon, but the fact that the Deepak Khaitan-property has been overlooked by his first jockey C. Alford, in preference to Andreyan ? the ownermate ? is in itself a pointer.

 Southern Regent may not have won a classic but he is also the horse on the up. The MAM Ramaswamy-horse has finished close behind Imtiaz Sait?s Derby hope Warsaw Pact in the 2,000m Gold Ruia Cup. He is sure to relish the extended trip but in final analysis it seems Venus Arising and Andreyan are cut above the rest. It?s a toss-up between the two. It could be the big race temperament that favours M. Narredu who is eying for his third Derby win after Amazing Bay and Indictment. Or, it could also be the last hoorah for the master craftsman Byramji? The miracle-man has done it in the past. Remember Poonaji Bhonsle and Manitou winning the Bangalore Derby.

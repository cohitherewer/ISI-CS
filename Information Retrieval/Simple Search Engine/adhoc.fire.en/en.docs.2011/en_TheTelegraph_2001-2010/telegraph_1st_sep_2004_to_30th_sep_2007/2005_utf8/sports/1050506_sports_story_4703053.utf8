Second-best to a super-charged PSV in the Philips stadium for much of an unforgettable game, AC Milan scored a decisive away goal in added time, Massimo Ambrosinis header giving the visitors an overall win they barely deserved. 

Whether Liverpool will be brave enough to attack Milan as PSV did remains to be seen but the visitors were vulnerable to the darting runs of the home forwards. There is a lesson there for Rafael Benitezs team to contemplate as the Istanbul showdown with Milan approaches. 

Alessandro Nesta returned from suspension to take his place in the centre of the Milan back-line alongside former PSV defender Jaap Stam. Milans attack was led by Andriy Shevchenko with coach Carlo Ancelotti, aware of PSVs attacking power, preferring an extra midfielder in Ambrosini at the expense of Hernan Crespo. 

Ji-Sung Park began the move with a sweeping pass to Vennegoor of Hesselink who was challenged by Stam. The ball broke loose and Park, who had continued his forward run, beat Didi with a rising shot from eight yards, the first goal the Milan goalkeeper had conceded in 640 minutes of Champions League action. 

PSVs inventive display at San Siro deserved better than a 0-2 deficit to take into the second leg and Wednesday they again took the game to Milan, this time gaining an early advantage on the night. 

It is probably more of a surprise to see PSV so close to the final than Liverpool. The Dutch champions had never progressed beyond the group stages before this season and last summer lost their entire strike-force ? Arjen Robben, Mateja Kezman (Chelsea) and Dennis Rommerdahl (Charlton) ? to the Premiership. This is an ongoing problem for coach Guus Hiddink who is likely to have to replace midfielders Johann Vogel and Mark Van Bommel who are out of contract in June. 

It was from Van Bommels free kick in the 27th minute that Vennegoor of Hesselink came close to making it all-square, his header clipping the Milan crossbar. Not only Milans woodwork was rattled because the visitors needed all their strength and experience to keep a rampant PSV from scoring a second. 

PSV were grateful that Alex was perfectly positioned to block a goal-bound shot from Kaka and a thrilling first-half ended with Dida diving to save a powerful low shot by Lucius. 

PSV had 61 per cent of possession in the opening 45 minutes and Milan, on the defensive for much of this period, were forced to play the second-half without Maldini following his earlier kick in the head. 

Park was unfortunate when the ball hopped up just as he was about to shoot, the South Korean instead performing an embarrassing air-shot. 

Wilfred Bouma had no such problems in the 53rd minute when the ball broke to him 20 yards from goal but his shot hit a grateful Milan defender who prevented its goal-bound progress. 

It was terrific entertainment though the home crowd held their collective breath as Kaka put Shenchenko free but Lucius had tracked back and made a decisive tackle. 

The second goal PSV had been threatening to score came in the 65th minute. Young-Pyo Lee beat Cafu to send over a left wing centre which was headed home by Philip Coco, easily shrugging off a challenge by Maldinis replacement Kakhaber Kaladze. 

The teams had taken to the field to the theme from Mission Impossible and only a superb 77th minute save by Dida from Robert Pinho da Souza prevented PSV from closing in on mission accomplished. In the first minute of added time Kakas centre found Ambrosini completely unmarked to head past Gomes who should have saved the Milan midfielders effort. 

But PSV were not finished and from the restart PSV broke and Vennegoor of Hesselink flicked the ball on for Coco to score his second goal of the night. The final scoreline read 3-1 for PSV and 3-3 on aggregate.

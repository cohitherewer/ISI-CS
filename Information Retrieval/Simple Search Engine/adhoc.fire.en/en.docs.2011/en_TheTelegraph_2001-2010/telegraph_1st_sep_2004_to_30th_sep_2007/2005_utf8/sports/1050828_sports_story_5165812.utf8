 Bahadur appeals to President

Chandigarh: After being ignored again by the selection committee for the Arjuna Award, Busan Asian Games gold medallist Bahadur Singh on Saturday appealed for President A. P. J. Abdul Kalams intervention. 

I appeal to you to ensure justice as the presentation of awards is scheduled for August 29, the athlete said. 

Singh said his name was recommended by the Athletic Federation of India and the Punjab government during the last three years, but was not considered. The only option left for deserving sportspersons is either demonstration or hunger strike, he said. 

Meanwhile, hockey Olympian Joaquim Carvalho on Saturday questioned the criteria behind the selection of the Dronacharya awardees and the reason for his omission from the award list. 

I do not understand the criteria behind this years Dronachaya Awards. I feel I am fully qualified to get the award for producing fine hockey players like Olympians Dhanraj Pillay, Gavin Ferreira, Jude Menezes and Mark Patterson, Carvalho said.

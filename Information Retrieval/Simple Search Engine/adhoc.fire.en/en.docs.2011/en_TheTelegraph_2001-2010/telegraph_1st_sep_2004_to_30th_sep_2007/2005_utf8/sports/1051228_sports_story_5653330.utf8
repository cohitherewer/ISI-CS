 Didnt think Id score a 100, says Hussey

 Herschelle Gibbs defends against Shane Warne in Melbourne on Tuesday 

Melbourne: Australia batsman Mike Hussey singled out tailenders Stuart MacGill and Glenn McGrath for praise after making his third Test century against South Africa on Tuesday. 

Hussey, who made 122 before being last out in Australias first innings of 355, engineered a 107-run 10th-wicket partnership with McGrath to frustrate the visitors. South Africa finished the second day of the second Test on 169 for two. 

South Africa had dismissed MacGill early on Tuesday to leave Australia struggling at 249 for nine before Hussey and McGrath fought back. 

You have to give a lot of credit to the number 10 and 11 batsmen, because theyre the ones under the most pressure, said Hussey, who scored 133 not out against the West Indies at Adelaide with MacGill holding up the other end. Im the one trying to shield them and take as many balls I can. 

I guess theyre not well noted for their batting and if they can stay in there for a long time and face a lot of balls, then we can frustrate the opposition for as long as possible. 

It is a partnership at the end of the day. You do need the bloke at the other end standing in there and having the courage to take it as well. 

Hussey, who made his Test debut this year against the West Indies, said he had not even thought about another century when McGrath strode to the wicket. 

I must admit when Glenn came to the crease, I was 27 or something and I didnt think Id be able to score a 100, he said. 

I think it wasnt until I was 91 or 92 that I thought maybe I could be in with a chance and get a couple of boundaries through slogs... but it was well into the 90s before I thought Id get to 100. 

Hussey also admitted there had been nerve-wracking moments when he smashed a six off Nicky Boje to move to 97. 

McGrath had to see out an over from Andre Nel after Hussey failed to take a single off the last ball of Bojes. 

I played a ball to (wicketkeeper Mark) Boucher when I was 97 and he said oh Huss, what have you done? 

But Glenn played well. He kept the over out from Andre Nel and Glenn did say to me thank goodness he got through that over because it gave me the chance to get 100. 

Hussey said he felt the match was evenly poised because the pitch was taking spin and showing signs of variable bounce. 

I think weve still got a great chance. If we can take some wickets tomorrow (Wednesday), well be in with a chance. 

Its going to be a great Test match, but I feel like were just in front.

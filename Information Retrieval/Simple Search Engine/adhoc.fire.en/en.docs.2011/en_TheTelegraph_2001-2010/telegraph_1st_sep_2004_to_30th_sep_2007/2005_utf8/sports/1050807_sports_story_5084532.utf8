 - Premier Division George fail to cash in on opportunities

Calcutta: Amal Datta tried to put up a brave front saying he was satisfied with the teams showing on Saturday, but the fact remains that a porous defence is sure to give him sleepless nights during the season ahead. 

Until Sanjay Partes brilliant volley turned out to be the winner against George Telegraph early in the second session, it seemed the green-and-maroon brigade would have to remain satisfied with a goalless tie. There were very few positive moves that resulted in creating openings. Too many square and miss passes added to their woes. 

George Telegraph, reeling under one point in four games, were hardly supposed to pose any significant challenge. Still, Mehtab Hussain and Co. found it hard to break their citadel. 

Bagans attack was too predictable. A run down the flanks, followed by a floater with the strikers trying to nod in. 

On the counterattack, George Telegraph was finding it all too easy. With no blocking or snatching visible in the Bagan midfield, the defence was caught napping time and again. 

In the 37th minute, George nearly scored after Subrata Pal fumbled and the ball ran loose to a player lurking nearby. But like a few occasions, inept shooting inside the box led to his inability to score. 

George best chance came in the 65th minute when Mohan Chakraborty capitalised on a misspass and found himself in the clear. He ran a good 25 yards unchallenged but failed to place the ball past an advancing goalkeeper. The shot was wide off the target. 

A recruit from Chuchill Brothers, Partes goal came in the 52nd minute, a superb shot from the right corner of the box that beat Uttam Patra hands down on the first post. A little later another Noel Wilson volley hit the bar. 

Finding it hard to open the goalmouth in the face of a cluttered defence, Bagan often initiated the tactics of shooting from a distance. A Dharamjit Singh strike missed the target by a whisker late in the first half. 

Sushil Kumar Singh squandered a chance early in the match when he failed to control the ball with an open net lurking in the background. 

Meanwhile, Bagans new recruit, Yao Rodrigue Glay from Togo, has arrived in the city.

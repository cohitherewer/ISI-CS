The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid defends opener Pathan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rahul Dravid did not wish to blame the Eden Gardens wicket for the humiliating defeat on Friday. 

The fact is, we didnt bat well. I cant really blame the wicket. It played good and there was true bounce. We didnt have enough runs on the board. When you dont play well, you have to accept that and move on. 

The Indians are not losing hope and looking forward to the match in Mumbai with optimism. We have a very important match in Mumbai. We havent performed well in a couple of games in this series. But if our top-order can perform, we can be competitive. 

Dravid defended his decision to send Irfan Pathan as an opener. The thinking was to go with two lefthanders. Pathan had some success against them. We thought if they can score some runs in the first seven/eight overs, then the middle-order can build up on that. 

Unfortunately, he got out. When you keep trying different things, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt. 

On Sachin Tendulkars failure in the last six matches, Dravid said he was not really worried. Sachin is a great player. I hope he will score. According to the law of averages, he is due for a big score. 

The Indian captain also tried to downplay the dew factor. 

Bowling second is always tough under dewy conditions. We had experienced this in our match versus Pakistan. But the real problem was that there were not many runs on the board. We should have scored close to 300, he said. 

Dravid hailed Graeme Smiths superb innings saying, we had two-three plans for him. But he played very well and our plans did not work.

 Mosley to meet drivers on August 1

Silverstone: Formula One drivers have been invited to discuss their safety concerns with the sports governing body in the French Riviera resort of Cannes on August 1. 

August 1, in the afternoon, in Cannes, International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Max Mosley said at the British Grand Prix on Sunday. The date is the Monday after the Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest and marks the start of Formula Ones three-week break when there is no testing allowed and drivers will be on vacation. 

The meeting was originally scheduled for Silverstone last Friday but was called off after Mosley took exception to published comments by Red Bulls British driver David Coulthard. 

Mosley, who lives in nearby Monaco, said Cannes would be convenient for many of the drivers who also lived in the Mediterranean principality. 

For the rest, its just a question of getting in the private jet, he added. 

The FIA said however that the meeting would go ahead only if at least half the current super-licence holders confirmed their attendance by next Friday. The drivers want the FIA to ensure safety measures at private tests are on a par with those at grands prix and have also expressed concern about the handling of the US Grand Prix tyre fiasco. 

The FIA said the agenda would focus on private testing, proposed technical and sporting regulations for 2008 and any other business. 

Mosley, who is at odds with some of the teams and manufacturers over the sports future direction, said he had a good relationship with the drivers but urged them to stay out of paddock politics. 

Their fundamental problem is that they want the same safety measures at private testing that they have at a grand prix, he said. 

All logic and reason says that that should happen because there is more risk of an accident probably at private testing than at a grand prix, from component failure. 

The problem is that it will be more expensive for the teams, added Mosley, whose term of office runs out in October when he is expected to stand for re-election.So if I start insisting on that, which we could do because we are completely responsible for circuit safety, I am going to have the teams against me. 

Mosley said he had called off the Friday meeting to prevent it turning into a media circus. (Reuters)

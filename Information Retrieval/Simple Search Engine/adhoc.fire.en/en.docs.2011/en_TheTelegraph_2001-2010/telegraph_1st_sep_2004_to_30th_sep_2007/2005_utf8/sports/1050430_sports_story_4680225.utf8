 PCB to probe Malik for throwing match

 Shoaib Malik has apologised 

Karachi: The PCB has constituted a three-man inquiry committee to probe the conduct of Shoaib Malik who faces a level 2 charge for conceding a match in the country?s inaugural Twenty20 Cup meet. 

PCB?s director of cricket operations, Saleem Altaf, said from Lahore that Malik had already been fined Rs 10,000 Pakistan rupees while the decision of the inquiry committee would be made public on Saturday. 

?I would not like to comment on his selection chances for the West Indies tour because the matter has been referred to the inquiry committee and its findings and recommendations would be forwarded to the selection committee,? said Altaf, a former Test cricketer who was manager of the team which recently toured India. 

?But had it been a one-day International, Shoaib Malik would have been charged under level 2 which attracts a fine of 50 to 100 per cent of match fee and a ban of one Test or two ODIs,? he said. 

Sialkot Stallions, chasing 176 for victory on Thursday evening, were 151 for three after 16 overs when Malik scored just 20 runs from the last four overs to deliberately concede the match to Karachi Zebras. 

According to Malik, Stallions had beaten Eagles fair and square by seven runs in the sixth match of the tournament but the Match Referee and umpires penalised his team for slow over-rate and awarded 12 penalty runs to Eagles that helped the local team win by three wickets. 

Malik has since apologised, saying he had reacted after feeling his team had got a raw deal earlier. 

Malik accepted he had acted immaturely as a captain and player. ?He has apologised, but we still feel he acted inappropriately for a Pakistan player,? Altaf added. ?The chairman of the board is not happy and we feel he has sent out a wrong message. 

?We are trying to contact Shoaib Malik to inform him of Saturday?s inquiry committee meeting so that he can defend himself. But so far, we have not succeeded in passing on the information,? Altaf said. 

Altaf played down rumours of ?fixing? in Thursday?s match involving Lahore Lions and Multan Tigers. 

?I have seen a newspaper report in which questions have been raised because of the number of extras conceded. I haven?t seen the match but we will look into the matter,? he said when asked if the PCB would investigate that match also.

 Lee, Hodge in squad

 - TEST SERIES 

- New Zealand name newcomers O?Brien, Cumming 

 Playing XI still distant for Lee, says chief selector 

Sydney: Australian selectors ignored calls for speedster Brett Lee to be dropped from the team for dangerous bowling as they named a 13-man squad for the Test series against New Zealand beginning next week. 

Batsman Brad Hodge was the only novelty in the squad, being brought into the Test squad in place of veteran Darren Lehmann, who was dropped from the one-day side last month and was unavailable for Test selection due to injury. 

Lee has come under sharp criticism for throwing beamers against New Zealand batsmen four times this season, most recently hitting wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum in the arm over the weekend. 

The bowling had columnists demanding Lee be sent home. 

The chairman of Australia?s selection panel, Trevor Hohns, said the 13-man squad was ?balanced? and sufficient for the three-Test series. 

He, however, played down Lee?s impressive one-day form in the current series against the Black Caps by maintaining the two forms of the game would be viewed separately when choosing the Test team. 

?We have plenty of options with both bat and ball and given the close proximity of the two countries, we always have the option of flying players in as the series progresses,? he said. 

?We settled on 13 players as we don?t want players sitting on the sidelines in New Zealand when they could be representing their states in the Pura Cup (domestic season),? he said. 

Hohns said Hodge?s entry into the squad was a reward for a fine domestic season, during which he has belted 735 runs. 

Two newcomers were named on Wednesday to the New Zealand Test squad to play Australia next week as the Black Caps attempt to bounce back from a disastrous one-day series. 

Wellington pace bowler Iain O?Brien was the biggest surprise in the squad for the Test to be played in Christchurch, starting on Thursday next week. 

Otago opener Craig Cumming, who played in the fourth one-dayer in Wellington Tuesday, has also been named in the Test squad for the first time and Auckland batsman Lou Vincent won a recall after a 14-month absence from the Test side. 

Allrounder Scott Styris was ruled out with bruising to the bone in his knee, allowing a Test recall for Craig McMillan, while batsman Hamish Marshall was also named.

 Chance to fulfil my Eden dream: Isa

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The only English woman cricketer of Indian origin, Isa Guhas dream will come true when she takes on the hosts in the fifth and final one-dayer at the Eden on Friday. 

Yes? Playing at the Eden is something which I have been dreaming for long, and tomorrow I will get the chance to fulfil my dream, Isa said at the Eden on Thursday. 

Isa, a biochemistry student from the University of London, is following few of her male compatriots ? Nasser Hussain, Mark Ramprakash, Ronnie Irani ? who have their roots in India but play for England. 

I dont have much knowledge about Indian culture, but I try to keep a tab of whats happening down here, Isa said. 

The mediumpacer, who likes the conditions at the Eden where the ball has a chance of swinging, will be looking forward to the morning session. I am very happy to be back in the city where I am originally from, she admitted. 

The 20-year-old cricketer is impressed by Indian outfits, some of which she would carry back home.

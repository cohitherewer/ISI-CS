 Jones may fly to Munich for treatment

DEREK PRINGLE

The race to get Simon Jones fit in time for next Thursdays final Ashes Test has led to speculation he may fly to Munich for treatment with Dr Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt, a man with an impressive record for getting sportspersons back into competition in record time. Jones is spending several sessions a day in a hyperbaric chamber, where oxygen is breathed under pressure in the hope that it will speed up recovery to the soft tissue injury caused by boney spurs in his right ankle. 

England lead Australia 2-1, a position that owes much to his part in a pace attack that has bowled Ricky Pontings side out twice in all but one of the four Tests played. 

Muller-Wohlfahrt specialises in repairing injury to soft tissue and cricketers like Darren Gough and Ronnie Irani have both used his unorthodox techniques to overcome career-threatening injuries. 

Jones affliction is not quite that serious, but it appears to be chronic if boney spurs are involved. But while that suggests a longer-term cure is needed, probably through surgery, five good days at the Oval next week is the priority. 

Jones has an anterior impingement, which according to James Davis, Essexs former physiotherapist, is unusual in cricket. Mostly it occurs among footballers, but Jones is thought to suffer because he drags his back foot ? something most pace bowlers did in Fred Truemans era, but not since the no-ball law was shifted from the back to the front foot. 

Dr Muller-Wohlfahrt is unorthodox and ahead of his time, but he is very effective, Davis said. Using a hyperbaric chamber for an injury like Jones has is interesting, but it doesnt always help. Nasser Hussain used one after breaking a finger, but it didnt accelerate the healing time. 

With his ability to swing the ball at pace, Jones has become a valuable member of Englands bowling attack and his absence for what many are billing as this countrys biggest sporting event since the 1966 World Cup final, would be a massive blow.

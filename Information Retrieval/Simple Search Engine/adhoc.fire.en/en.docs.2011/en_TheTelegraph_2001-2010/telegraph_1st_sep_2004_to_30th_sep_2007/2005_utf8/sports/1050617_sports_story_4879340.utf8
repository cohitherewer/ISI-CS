The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barua, 3 more GMs to take part

A STAFF REPORTER AND PTI

 Dibyendu 

Calcutta/New Delhi: The 43rd national B chess championship, featuring over 300 players will be held here from August 3 to 13, and Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua will be among them. 

Logically, Barua, as a GM, would have made it to the A meet directly. However, as per new norms, missing out on a national team berth (from the last national A meet) does have the effect of pushing the player down to B. 

When there were a few Grandmasters, we were even exempt from playing in the national A, Barua told The Telegraph in Calcutta Thursday. I did not play from 1991 to 1998. Then, as the number of GMs grew, we were playing in the A. 

In the last national A meet in Andhra Pradesh this year, I was out of the national team for the first time in 16 years. Hence I will have to play in national B. 

At this point only players with an elo rating of over 2650 are exempt from playing in the national A. that exempts Viswanathan Anand and Krishnan Sasikiran. 

The top 14 players move into the elite group. 

Dibyendu apart, other prominent players who are likely to take part are, Grandmasters R. B. Ramesh, Koneru Humpy, Pravin Thipsay and International Masters P. Konguvel, V. Saravanan, Lanka Ravi, V. Koshy, N. K. Mishra, Deepan Chakravarthy and Chandrashekhar Gokhale, a media release said in Delhi. 

The local challenge will be spearheaded by IM Sriram Jha along with his wife WGM s. Vijayalakshmi.

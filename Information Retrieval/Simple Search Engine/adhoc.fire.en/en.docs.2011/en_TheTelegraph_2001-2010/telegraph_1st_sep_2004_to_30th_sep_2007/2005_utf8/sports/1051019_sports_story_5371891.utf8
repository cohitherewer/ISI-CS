 Indianapolis: American Scott Speed was named as a regular driver for Red Bull Racing, which will field two Formula One teams next season after acquiring Minardi in September.

 The 22-year-old Speed will become the first American to compete in a full Grand Prix season since Mario Andretti in 1993.

 Speed participated in test runs here during the weekend of the United States Grand Prix in June. He will be among five Red Bull Drivers entered in the event in July. A native of California who also tested for Red Bull Racing in Canada this season, Speed was third in the GP2 series this year.

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian referee Edilson Pereira de Carvalho was banned for life on Monday after the country?s top sporting tribunal found him guilty of involvement in a match-fixing scandal.

 After a hearing in Rio de Janeiro, the five-man tribunal said it had unanimously found Carvalho guilty of ?giving or promising to give an unfair advantage by influencing the result and acting in a manner which undermines the dignity of the sport?.

 Sao Paulo: A weekend shootout between rival groups of Brazilian soccer fans that left one dead and two critically injured was prearranged on the internet, police said on Monday.

 Authorities are now trying to access the e-mails of those arrested on Sunday to determine who organised the fight and how it was publicised, said Luiz Carlos do Carmo, a Sao Paulo police spokesman. Some of those arrested told authorities that they learned of the time and location of the planned clash from computers, Do Carmo said.

 Bucharest: Romanian authorities on Monday seized the assets of Steaua Bucharest owner Gigi Becali over unpaid club debts of around 7 million euros ($8.4 million). ?The decision to put under seizure the wealth of Gigi Becali is a normal one. The authorities take hundreds of such actions every day,? Sebastian Bodu, president of the National Agency of Fiscal Authority (ANAF), said.

 San Jose: A California university unveiled a statue on Monday honouring two Olympic medallists whose raised fists at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics became a symbol of black power protest.

 The 23-foot-tall statue at San Jose State University, where Tommie Smith and John Carlos were teammates on the track team, depicts the two sprinters on the podium after Smith won the gold medal and Carlos the bronze in the 200m sprint. During the playing of the US national anthem they bowed their heads and raised black-gloved in protest of poor treatment of blacks in America.

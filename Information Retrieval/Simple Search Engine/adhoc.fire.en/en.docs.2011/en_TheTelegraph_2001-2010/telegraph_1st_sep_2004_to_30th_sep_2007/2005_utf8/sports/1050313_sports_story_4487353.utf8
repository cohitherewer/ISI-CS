Calcutta: It all happened in less than a minute ? from the joy of winning to the grief of death for the syndicate that owned Calorific. 

The four-year-old triumphed handsomely over the hot favourite, Anzello, to claim the first Classic of his career and the six-member Thoroughbred Racing Syndicate?s cup of joy was full. 

However, the horse collapsed after passing the winning post following a cardiac arrest. 

Calorific?s trainer Vijay Singh attempted to revive the horse by pumping over his heart and veterinarian also administered oxygen. But a second attack proved too much for last year?s ?Million? winner to survive. 

?Exhaustion could have been one of the reasons for the horse to collapse,? said Vijay who was on his way to Mumbai. ?But the weather was cool after the overnight rain. He suffered successive attacks before the end came.? 

Derek O?Brien, a partner in the Syndicate, was equally upset. He had just stepped on to the track to lead in his winner. 

For him it was an awful sight as he struggled to mix two extreme emotions ? from the delight of winning to the horror of Calorific?s sudden demise. 

?I?m so upset, I can?t explain it. I do not wish to own horses anymore,? he said. 

Old-timers recalled the death of Best Of All, a horse trained by the late Manohar Lal, who had also collapsed and died after landing a gamble for the trainer nearly 25 years ago. 

Trainer Lawrie Fownes? Fighting Force, a hot-favourite for the city?s classics had suffered almost a similar fate about three decades ago. However, the horse had died of a cardiac arrest before passing the winning post.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Heroics must be followed by consistency

[+uc('ALAN SMITH at OLD TRAFFORD 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]

You could see exactly what it meant every time a close decision went against them. Whether it was Ruud van Nistelrooy, Cristiano Ronaldo or the inspired Alan Smith, the affronted figure jumped up and down manically, head in hands, barely able to contain his angst. 

With Chelsea pouring forward to try to salvage something, nobody wanted to be the one to let the side down. Every red shirt told the same story. After an extraordinary eight days in the life of Manchester United, this was quite clearly a match they could ill-afford to lose. 

So what does this win tell us, what did we learn after 90 sweat-stained minutes of rousing defiance? The answer is not an awful lot. United, as suspected, do have good players, having done their very best to hide that fact in the previous two games. Better than that, they have genuine matchwinners who, at the sharp end of a team that stays nice and tight, can elevate the spirits of the most disenchanted fan. 

In Wayne Rooney and Van Nistelrooy, in Ronaldo and Paul Scholes, United still rival the champions, surpass them even, in terms of attacking flair. Yet that has never really been in doubt (apart from Scholes whose lacklustre form took a welcome upturn here). No, its further back in the line-up where most worries lie, where United have looked far from secure. 

Rio Ferdinand reminded us just in time that, yes, he is actually a top-class defender when he puts his mind to it. The much-criticised centre-half was clearly intent on getting the basics right: winning his headers against Didier Drogba, putting his foot in where it mattered and generally taking no chances in his own penalty area. 

Smith, meanwhile, in Roy Keanes anchor role, enjoyed perhaps his best game for United since arriving from Leeds. Certainly his bravest. The indignity of being publicly criticised by his captain had clearly hurt. In response, this proud son of Yorkshire knuckled down to concentrate on his holding position with an inspired series of tackles and interceptions that lent the side a welcome platform. 

In accepting the bubbly, Smith insisted that this must only be the start. Hes right. Its easy to rouse yourself for Chelsea in a do-or-die atmosphere, not quite so straight forward at Charlton this weekend. Consistency must follow the heroics for any good to come about.

 Technology will play a bigger role: Shepherd

London: David Shepherd, who made his final appearance as an international umpire at The Oval on Tuesday, said he expected technology to play an even bigger part in cricket in years to come. 

Shepherd, 64, who quit ahead of reaching the England and Wales Cricket Boards compulsory retirement age of 65, said television had created the biggest changes in his 25 years as an umpire. 

Television shows up our mistakes. It also proves us right now and then. Theres more scrutiny from the camera, said Shepherd, who stood in 92 Tests and 171 ODIs. 

But where would we be without the tight line decisions? They are crucial and its been great to turn to the third umpire and get the camera view. How far down the road will technology go? Will it go to lbw, to caught behind? It may well do. 

The sad thing about it is of course only if a game is being televised do we have technology. There are thousands of umpires doing club cricket and first-class games who dont have the benefit of that. So its a bit ironic that the so-called elite are getting help where everyone else is not. 

But he insisted that technology had helped improve player behaviour, often criticised by cricket traditionalists. 

To be quite honest, I think it has improved a bit mainly because of microphones and the fact they are on TV and the fact we have got a Match Referee. The referee has the power to fine and suspend people. Its very important for a player to keep his place in the side these days. 

In England, the tradition has been that first-class games are umpired by former County players and Shepherd said this experience had been invaluable to him after he retired as a player in 1979 and started to look for a new job. 

I think the fact that I played the game was a great advantage. Sometimes I can realise the emotions the players are going through and perhaps smooth troubled waters. 

The veteran umpire said he was very superstitious. Friday 13th is terrible day, on that day I have a matchstick touching my finger so I am touching wood all day to combat it, Shepherd said.

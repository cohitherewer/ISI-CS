 PCB to ICCs rescue

Islamabad: The ICC escaped a major embarassment with the PCB officials rectifying in the nick of time a poster, showing Afghan refugees and Maulvis taking part in a demonstration, to promote Pakistan cricket. 

According to PCB sources, the ICC has created posters of all the teams whose players have been pic-ked for the World XI to play against Australia in the Super Series in October. The poster of each country including Pakistan shows a crowd of people in the backdrop with the slogan a million people want your seat.

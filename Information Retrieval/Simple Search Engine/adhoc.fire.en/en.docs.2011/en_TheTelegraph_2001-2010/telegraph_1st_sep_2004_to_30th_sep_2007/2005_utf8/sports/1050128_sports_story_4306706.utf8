 North Zone crush East

 - deodhar trophy 

Vadodara: Amit Bhandari claimed four for 35 as a star-studded North Zone crushed East Zone by seven wickets in a low scoring match of the Deodhar Trophy here on Wednesday. 

East had lost their first match, too, against West Zone. 

After skipper Virender Sehwag elected to field, North bundled out East for a paltry 146 in 46 overs. North overhauled the target in 36.2 overs. 

Sehwag produced a blazing start as he struck 27 off 19 balls with four fours and a six while Gambhir made a steady 44 off 58 balls including six fours. 

Yuvraj Singh (34) and Dinesh Mongia (20 not out) chipped in with useful knocks.

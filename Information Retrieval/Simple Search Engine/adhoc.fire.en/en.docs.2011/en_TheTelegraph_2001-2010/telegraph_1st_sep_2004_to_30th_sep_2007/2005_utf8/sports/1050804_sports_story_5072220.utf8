The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hungry Sehwag kept waiting

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Virender Sehwag in action in Dambulla on Wednesday 

Dambulla: Virender Sehwag must wait till Colombo, at least, for his first fifty since the 74 in Vizag against Pakistan. The wait for his first truly enjoyable meal in over a week, though, is bound to end once the team reaches the Sri Lankan capital on Thursday. 

Dambulla does have a pretty stadium and the team hotel has been excellent ? however, only from the accommodation point of view as the food hasnt had even an iota of the Indian flavour. 

The Mahendra Singh Dhonis and Suresh Rainas have struggled and, on Tuesday, Sehwag looked rather helpless as he moved around the buffet with just rice on his plate. 

That, by the way, wasnt a first for him in Dambulla. 

Ab kya kahen? Bas kuch khana hai, Sehwag told The Telegraph in an unamused tone. What he left unsaid is that, like many teammates, he was praying for the quickest departure. 

The Indians are expected to reach Colombo early in the afternoon, in time either for a desi meal at the Taj Samudra or at one of the restaurants (outside the team hotel) which serve authentic Indian khana. 

After enjoying a meal or two, for variety, Sehwag may decide to feast on the West Indians. The return match is on Sunday.

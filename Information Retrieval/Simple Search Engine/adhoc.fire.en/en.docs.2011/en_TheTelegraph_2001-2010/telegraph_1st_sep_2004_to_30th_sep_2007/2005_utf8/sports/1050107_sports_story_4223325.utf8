 Eight stake claim for Sunday?s Classic 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Eight horses, including two fillies ? Make A Wish and Star Angel ? have lined up for the most prestigious race of the season, the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, the star attraction in Sunday?s eight-event race card. All races on the day will be trophy events and six of them named after the past Derby winners. The card also includes two events for three-year-old juveniles ? the 1,400m Zara Shah Cup and the Psychic Flame Cup, an 1,100m scurry. Psychic Flame, it may be recalled, won the city Derby last year and she went on to lift the Indian Derby too. First race starts at 12 noon.ACCEPTANCES

 Sehwag aims to bat the whole of Day III

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Virender Sehwag is not thinking just about completing his ninth Test century but also aiming to bat the whole of the third day. Eager to get back into the middle, he wants to score fast and score big. 

?My aim is to play the full day tomorrow, which will put the team in good stead. Our priority will be to get back to the field early and capitalise on today?s work,? Sehwag said after Wednesday?s play. 

Sehwag, who started off in a whirlwind fashion and is batting on 95 at the close, slowed down somewhat during the last hour of play. And he has a specific reason for that. 

?The Melbourne episode, in the 2003-04 series Down Under, taught me a lesson where I got out on 195 and the team all out for 366. I didn?t want that to happen this time, and that?s why I reined myself in,? he explained. 

 He refused to make a decision on whether India had at last found a solid opening partner in him and Gautam Gambhir after their second century-plus stand. ?We will have to wait and see? Give him some more time to prove himself further. In the past, too, I have had century partnerships with Akash Chopra and Sanjay Bangar.? 

Sehwag did not agree that this was the weakest Pakistan attack he had faced. ?Their bowling is not weak... It?s just that they didn?t bowl enough in the right spots.? 

He did not agree that he had a special liking for their attack and it always eggs him on. ?I have scored hundreds against other countries too.? 

Terming the wicket as ?good?, he said that the bowlers were getting ?enough purchase?.

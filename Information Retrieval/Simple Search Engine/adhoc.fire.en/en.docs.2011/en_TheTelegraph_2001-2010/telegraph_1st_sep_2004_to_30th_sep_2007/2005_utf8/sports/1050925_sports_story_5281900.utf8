Calcutta: It was a mixed day for the Russians at the WTA Sunfeast Open at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Saturday. 

While top seed Anastasia Myskina fairly flew into the final with a 6-3, 6-1 dismissal of Estonian Kaia Kanepi, second seed Elena Likhovtseva was upset 6-4, 4-6, 1-6 by seventh seed Karolina Sprem, the Croat making it a hattrick of wins against the Russian. 

Neha (US) and Shikha Uberoi (India) beat Melinda Czink (Hungary) and Yuliana Fedak (Ukraine) 7-6 (7-5), 1-6, 6-3 to move into the doubles final. Serving for the match, Neha wrapped up proceedings with an ace and jumped for joy before hugging sister Shikha as the stadium erupted. This will be the first WTA final for the pair. 

Later in the evening, Sania Mirza and Virginia Ruano Pascual went down 7-4, 3-6, 5-7 to Myskina and Likhovtseva. 

Known for her giant-killing ways, she last beat the world No. 16 in the second round of the Australian Open this year. She also beat her during a Fed Cup tie in 2003. 

Sprem also scalped Venus Williams in the second round of Wimbledon last year. 

Of course, Likhovtseva did pull up short with an injury midway the second set, and despite taking a medical time-out in Game 6 for a lower back problem, she still couldnt get back into her stride. She had trouble hitting forehands cleanly and also seemed uncomfortable running sideways. 

To be fair, though, Sprem played a humdinger of a match, sending down smashing forehands that had the Russian caught like a deer in the headlights. 

Likhovtseva, a little stiff in the beginning, looked like she was warming to the match when she broke the Croat in the fourth game of the first set. 

But Sprem, ranked 81 in the world, wasnt about to let herself get overwhelmed by the higher-ranked Russian. However, Sprem reckoned without the Likhovtsevas determination, and found herself broken back in a flash. The Russian broke in the tenth to clinch the set. 

The second set also seemed to be going according to script, and the first four games went with serve. By now, Likhovtseva was beginning to stiffen up again. It was obvious something was wrong. 

She was not moving well at all and was broken in the fifth, after which she took the medical time-out, even needing some tablets at the end of the next game. But she just couldnt back into her rhythm, and her concentration lapsed. 

She managed to hold twice more in the set before being broken as many times to hand the set to Sprem. 

From then on end, it was all Sprem, who broke thrice in the third to take the match and make the third WTA final of her career. 

The injury was obviously keeping Likhovtseva from playing up to standard, and it showed in the errors that began creeping in. Her first serve began to go awry, and her returns were less than average. 

Sprem, on the other hand, began moving around the court more, hitting some magnificent winners and cancelling out the Russians drop shots with some accurate forehand and backhand passing shots. 

The only game Likovtseva won was the fifth one; Sprem broke in the first, third and seventh to seal the match. 

Myskina just outclassed Kanepi in the second semi-final. The Russian top seeds superior court coverage and finesse proved too much for the big Estonian to handle and she capitulated in just 50 minutes. 

Kanepi tried hard to stay in the match by retaliating after being broken in the second game of the first set ? breaking back immediately with a smart drop-shot and a couple of passing winners. 

But the flicker of brilliance was momentary and it was easily snuffed out by Myskinas strong serves and deep returns.

 Himmat champion

 - EAST INDIA AMATEUR GOLF 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Himmat S. Rai defeated Sanjeev Mehra in the final of the Goodricke East India Amateur that concluded at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club course on Sunday. 

Himmat beat Mehra 4 and 3 to lift and conclude a fine week of matchplay golf. 

Mehra had been in great form till the semi-finals, and on Sunday too he began by taking the early lead. 

But gradually he found that it was difficult to keep momentum over 36 holes. 

In fact, the issue was decided by the 33rd hole, when Himmat had pulled away to a four-up lead. 

Mehra began well by winning the third hole to go one-up. 

But every time he tried to pull away, Himmat clawed back with vengeance. He came back twice to all-square, and then slowly began to pull away. 

Himmat won the 10th hole, and then the next, to go 2-up. Mehra pulled one back on the 13th, but Himmat birdied the 14th and 16th to go up by three. 

Mehra birdied the 17th, but missed a putt on the 18th to go three behind again. 

On the return leg, the match was decided on the first three holes. 

Himmat birdied the 19th, pared the 20th and then Mehra double bogeyed the 21st and his rival won that hole, despite bogeying himself. 

Mehra won the 25th, 26 th, 27 th but Himmat again snared the 28th and 29th holes to go five up. 

Mehra birdied the 30th and 32nd, but surrendered the 31st, and stayed behind by four. 

And when he failed to win the 33rd hole, which was halved, the title went to Himmat.

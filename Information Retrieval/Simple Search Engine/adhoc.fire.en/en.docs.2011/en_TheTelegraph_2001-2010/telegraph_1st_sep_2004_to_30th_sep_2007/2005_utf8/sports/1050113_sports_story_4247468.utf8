 Agassi unveils new anti-ageing concept 

 - ?I don?t want to compromise on strength for sake of being lighter?

Melbourne: Andre Agassi unveiled his latest anti-ageing concept in his first outing of the season on Wednesday, showing off a sleeker, more defined physique in a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) win over Olympic gold medallist Nicolas Massu at the Kooyong Classic. 

Agassi, 34, admits his greater attention to strength and conditioning is part of a constant search for ways of keeping pace with his rivals, who are mostly a decade or more younger. 

?Being down here feeling good physically and looking forward to the tennis to me is a great opportunity to hopefully have some magical things happen,? said Agassi, who has won the Australian Open after each of his three wins at the Kooyong exhibition tournament in 2000, 2001 and 2003. 

Agassi said he?d trimmed down to about 74 kilograms from about 80 kilograms after concentrating on fitness instead of tennis technique in the off season. 

?When you?ve hit thousands of balls a day for 30-plus years you?re not convinced you are ever going to really learn to hit the ball better, but you can become a better athlete,? said Agassi, who?ll be 35 in April. 

?You can move better, you can get fitter ? I believe those are things that make you a better tennis player,? Agassi said. 

Agassi said he?s honing his shots with his extra strength rather than trying to put more onto each ball. 

?It?s not about hitting the ball harder, it?s about hitting your normal shot easier and that?s what I believe being stronger offers you,? Agassi said. 

And now he thinks he?s hit the right balance, still able to scramble with the best but still having something in reserve in the long five-set matches at a Grand Slam. 

?I don?t want to compromise on strength for the sake of being lighter or else it?s just less of you and that?s not what you need out there,? he said. ?You need to be strong, you need to be fit and you need to be able to get yourself around the court.? 

The enduring Agassi has remodelled himself again, after failing to reach a final at a major in 2004 for the first time in six years. 

In the first half of his career, it was Pete Sampras he was targeting. Now it?s another potentially once-in-a-generation player ? Roger Federer ? he wants to measure himself against. And that doesn?t leave any room for error, Agassi thinks. 

?Federer ... Has strengths that have to be dealt with and it sort of forces you to play a perfect match,? to beat him, said Agassi, an eight-time Grand Slam titlist. 

?If you have a good tournament, you only have to deal with him once ? hopefully on the last day ? and it?s about playing that great match when you need to.?

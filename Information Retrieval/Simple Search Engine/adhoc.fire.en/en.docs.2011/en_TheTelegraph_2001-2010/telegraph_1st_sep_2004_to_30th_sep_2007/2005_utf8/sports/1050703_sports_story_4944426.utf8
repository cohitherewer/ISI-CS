The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg Chappell may target barrier-busters

 - Getting the very best to interact with players 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Dennis Lillee, Dr Charles Krebs? New Team India coach Greg Chappell obviously wants the very best to interact with both the established players and those on the fringe. 

However, one understands he doesnt wish to restrict the exchange of ideas to a select field ? either only former players or specialists associated with cricket/sport in general. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Chappell may invite the biggest achievers (perhaps in the world of arts, business, movies) to spend time with the regulars and aspirants. 

Apparently, hes fascinated by those who have smashed barriers. 

Chappell, of course, himself raised the bar rather effortlessly during his 13-year innings at the highest level. Indeed, the Australian is still regarded as an all-time great. 

He believes theres much to learn from the hottest achievers? That their experiences can form part of our own players learning curve, is how one source put it. 

Given that Chappell may exclusively target the barrier-busters, at a suitable time, it wont surprise if somebody who has scaled Everest or rocketed into space features in his plans. 

He isnt going to rush things, nor will anything be overdone? Hes still settling down and is yet to meet all the Team India regulars? The vision, though, is clear and he wont leave any stone unturned in his push for excellence, explained another source. 

When thats the Chappell agenda ? for the next two years, at least ? nobody should have reservations. 

Footnote: Its learnt that the Chappells wont move into an apartment (in Bangalore), but remain at the Taj West End. The delightfully laid-out hotel, it seems, is refurbishing a cottage. Among other things, the Chappells are going to have a lot more privacy than they would in a complex-located apartment.

 Indians leave for Pakistan

New Delhi: The Indian snooker team on Wednesday exuded confidence that they would retain the Indo-Pak Peace Cup, which begins in Karachi on Thursday. 

We are very confident that if we play to our potential we will easily retain the Cup which we won at home last year, reigning national and Asian champion Alok Kumar said before departure. 

Three members of the team ? Alok, former IBSF world champion Pankaj Advani and local boy Manan Chandra ? left in the afternoon while the fourth member, Devendra Joshi, and national coach Michael Ferreira boarded the flight from Mumbai. (PTI)

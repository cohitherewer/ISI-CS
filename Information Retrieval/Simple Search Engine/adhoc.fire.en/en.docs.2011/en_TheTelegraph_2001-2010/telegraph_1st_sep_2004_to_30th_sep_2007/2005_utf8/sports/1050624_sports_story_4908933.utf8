 3 Indians share 5th spot

Bandar Seri Begawan: Three Indians ? Amandeep Johl, Gaurav Ghei and Ashok Kumar ? found their touch and scored four-under 67 to be tied fifth place on the opening day of the inaugural Brunei Open on Thursday. Malaysias Danny Chia fired eight-under-par 63 to take the lead. 

Johl had just one blot on his card with the bogey on par-3 seventh and his birdies were on the second, third and three in a row from 13th to 15th. Ghei had three birdies each on the front and back nines, and one bogey each on either side to end up at four-under 67. Ashok had just one blemish on a fairly good day, when he bogeyed the eighth. His five birdies came on the second, fourth, 12th, 15th and 18th. 

Firoz Ali began with a two-under 69 with four birdies and two bogeys one of them on the last hole. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Moody set to be named next week

 - SRI LANKA COACH 

 Moody is expected to get a two-year contract 

Colombo: Sri Lanka are expected to name Australian Tom Moody as their national coach next week following Indias appointment of Greg Chappell. 

Sri Lanka were forced to delay their recruitment process until after India had finalised interviews with Moody and Chappell. 

Moody, director of cricket at English county Worcestershire, is due to travel to Colombo over the weekend for an interview on Monday or Tuesday with the Sri Lankan Cricket board. 

Tom (Moody) is going to confirm shortly when he can come and we hope to have everything finalised early next week, Sri Lanka Cricket chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa said. 

Moody is expected to agree a two-year contract to lead the team to the 2007 World Cup. 

His first assignment will be a two-Test series against the West Indies scheduled to start on July 15 at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo. 

Moody, a seam-bowling all rounder, played eight Tests and 76 one-day Internationals, twice helping Australia win the World Cup in 1987 and 1999. 

The 39-year-old has been linked with several coaching jobs, including the England post after speculation that Duncan Fletcher may not renew his contract after this years Ashes. 

Sri Lanka approached a number of coaches including Dav Whatmore of Bangladesh, and Australians Dean Jones and Steve Waugh. 

Former coach John Dyson, whose contract expired in April after 20 months in charge during which Sri Lanka rose up the Test and ODI rankings, was also in the running.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Time for me, V.V.S. to get runs: Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly feels Younis Khan?s first-ball dismissal on the final morning proved to be the deciding factor. ?When we declared on the fourth evening, we knew we had a chance. Afridi?s dismissal yesterday and the first-ball dismissal of Younis Khan set it up for us. That was the turning point,? the Team India captain said. 

?This is one of our better wins in recent times. Very satisfying? It?s always good to win but the way we dominated four of the last five Tests against Pakistan has been very pleasing,? Sourav added. 

He also praised Dinesh Karthik. ?Karthik batted well. He along with Dravid took us to a match-winning position.? 

Sourav felt it was only a matter of time before V.V.S. Laxman and he were back among runs and changing the batting order wouldn?t help much. 

?I have scored runs for the last few years. Changing my batting position won?t make a big difference. Laxman has also proved himself. But yes, it?s time for both of us to get runs. ?I feel runs are just round the corner for me. It?s just a matter of an innings. Hopefully it will happen in Bangalore.? 

Inzamam-ul Haq felt conceding the first-innings lead made a big difference. 

?We had a great opportunity in the first innings to score 500, but we lost eight wickets fairly cheaply and ended up conceding a lead. That was very disappointing. If you miss an opportunity against a good team, then you make things difficult for yourself.? 

Did Younis? dismissal make things easy for India today? ?In such a situation, the fielding side has its tail up and it adds to the pressure on the batting team. If we had shown greater responsibility, we could still have saved the match. At lunch I was fairly confident that we could pull off a draw.? 

Inzamam, though, isn?t disheartened. ?I?m confident we can draw level in Bangalore. Even here, if we had put up a good first-innings total, the result could have been different. We just need a combined effort.?

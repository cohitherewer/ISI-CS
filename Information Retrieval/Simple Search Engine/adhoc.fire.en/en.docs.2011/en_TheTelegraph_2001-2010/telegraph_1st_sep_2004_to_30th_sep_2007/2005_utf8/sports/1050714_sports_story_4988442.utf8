 FIA modifies position on technology

London: FIA president Max Mosley has changed his tune on Formula One technology after fans called overwhelmingly for the sport to retain its cutting-edge status. 

The International Automobile Federation (FIA) head wrote to the 10 teams and other parties on Wednesday, asking them to consider the technology/cost issue and what should be permitted in future. 

Mosley has called for expensive and invisible technology to be stripped out, with draft proposals for 2008 envisaging significant restrictions to cut costs. 

However an FIA-backed survey, the results of which were released last week, found that fans wanted the sport to retain its high-tech image. 

Eighty percent agreed that advanced technology set Formula One apart from other motor sports while 64 said they looked forward to technical innovations each season.

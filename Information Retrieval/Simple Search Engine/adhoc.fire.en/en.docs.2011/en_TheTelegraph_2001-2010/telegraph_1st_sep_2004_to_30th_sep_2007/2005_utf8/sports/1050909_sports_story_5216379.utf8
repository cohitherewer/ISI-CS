New York: Mahesh Bhupathi and Daniela Hantuchova continued their giant-killing act with a third successive upset of a seeded pair to enter the mixed doubles final of the US Open on Wednesday. 

Bhupathi and Slovakian Hantuchova shocked sixth seeds Corina Morariu and Mike Bryan of the US 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 in the semi-finals to set up a final clash with Katarina Srebotnik of Slovakia and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia. 

Srebotnik and Zimonjic defeated Israels Andy Ram and Dinara Safina of Russia 6-1, 7-5. 

Bhupathi has won four mixed doubles titles previously with four different partners, the latest being with Mary Pierce at Wimbledon. 

In the boys singles second round, the last Indian hope ebbed with Rupesh Roys 6-3, 4-6, 3-6 loss to Matt Bruch of the US.

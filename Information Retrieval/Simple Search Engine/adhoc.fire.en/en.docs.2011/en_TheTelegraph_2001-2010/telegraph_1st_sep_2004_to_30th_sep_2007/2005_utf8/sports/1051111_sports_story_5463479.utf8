Multan: England captain Michael Vaughan has been ruled out of the first Test against Pakistan owing to a knee injury, an England team spokesman said on Thursday. 

The selectors have appointed Marcus Trescothick as captain for the first Test in Vaughans absence, Andrew Walpole, England teams media manager, told a news conference in Multan. 

He will continue to lead the side if Vaughan is unavailable for any remaining matches on the tour, he said. 

Vaughan will continue to receive treatment and a further update will be issued in due course of time. 

Vaughan, 31, who has played 62 Tests, injured his right knee while taking a third run during the three-day tour match in Lahore on Monday. 

The same knee injury also kept him out of a Test against New Zealand last year at Lords. 

Michael has a superb record as captain and to lose him for the first Test is major blow, Trescothick said.

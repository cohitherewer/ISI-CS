 ICC to mull Pak request

Sydney: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has agreed to look at a request from Pakistan to have only neutral umpires for one-day Internationals. 

ICC spokesman John Long said a letter had been received from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) following the tour of Australia. 

The Pakistanis felt that the umpiring in general during the tri-series tournament, also involving Australia and the West Indies, favoured the home side. (PTI)

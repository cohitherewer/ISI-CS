 Mahendra: Sourav will be back

New Delhi: Sourav Ganguly has found support in his hour of crisis with Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Ranbir Singh Mahendra saying the former skipper could not be ruled out of Indias scheme of things for World Cup 2007. 

Mahendra said at the moment the selectors did not want to tamper with a winning combination but that did not mean the doors had been shut on the Bengal southpaw. At present nobody wants to disturb the winning combination, otherwise I dont think theres any problem for Sourav to return to the team, Mahendra said. 

Asked specifically if Sourav held a chance to be a part of the team for the World Cup, he said, who has ruled him out? nobody has. This is the handy work of gossipmongers who believe in sensationalism, a press release quoted Mahendra as saying. 

He is a great player, he has also been a great captain. We are proud of him and he will definitely make a comeback to the team, said the BCCI chief. 

In my view, even the selectors have not taken any negative view on Souravs likely comeback, he added. 

Mahendra said: I dont think anybody believes that Sourav does not deserve to be in the team. His performances in Zimbabwe and in Duleep Trophy have been good. I think hell make a comeback. (PTI)

 Lara vaults to No. 1

London: Brian Lara has replaced Jacques Kallis atop the ICC Test batting rankings while Rahul Dravid has dropped a spot to third. 

Lara, who hit a superb 176 in a lost cause for the West Indies in the third Test last week, now has 886 points which moved him up from No. 3 to 1, according to an ICC press release. Kallis is No. 2 with 882 and Dravid third with 872. 

The rest of the top-10 remains unchanged with Virender Sehwag still at No. 5 and Inzamam-ul Haq at 8. Former No. 1 Sachin Tendulkar continued to be at the 11th spot with 750 points, 

Among the bowlers, South African Andre Nel entered the top-10 for the first time following his maiden ten-wicket haul on Sunday, including the wicket of Lara in both innings.

Johannesburg: England?s Andrew Strauss scored his third century of the series but Makhaya Ntini struck twice before close to earn South Africa a share of the honours on the first day of the fourth Test on Thursday. 

England, who won the toss and chose to bat on a pitch which gave early assistance to seamers, were 263 for four when bad light ended play 4.2 overs early. 

An out-of-form Michael Vaughan was playing on nine with nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard after the tourists lost three for 36 in the final session. 

Strauss survived an early grilling from Shaun Pollock to score a chanceless 147, his fifth century in 11 Tests. 

?I was very disappointed to get out as I did but we are in a pretty reasonable position,? he said. ?It was pretty hard against the new ball. We just had to knuckle down and get over that spell. It got easier.? 

England had stamped their authority on the day?s play during a second-wicket stand of 182 between Strauss and Robert Key (83). 

England openers Marcus Trescothick and Strauss saw off the new ball, shared by Pollock and Makhaya Ntini, and seemed set for a big partnership. But two balls after drinks Dale Steyn had Trescothick caught behind for 16. 

Strauss and Key took England to lunch on 77 for one, and shared 110 runs from 30 overs in the second session as the pitch eased. The stand was ended in the 10th over after tea, when Key drove hard at a ball from Ntini. 

Strauss was dismissed in the third over before close when he drove at a wide delivery from Pollock and was caught by Jacques Kallis at second slip. Three balls before the end Graham Thorpe fended a short ball from Ntini to Boeta Dippenaar at third slip to be dismissed without scoring.

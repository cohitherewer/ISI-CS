Surat: Gujarat were off to a shaky start losing two quick wickets for 127 after Bengal piled a mammoth first innings score of 462 on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy Elite group-A match at the Lalabhai Contractor stadium here on Tuesday. 

Gujarat lost opener Akash Christian and Bilakhia. Akash failed to open his account and was the first to go with five runs on board. Then Bilakhia joined Nilesh Modi and both had a partnership of 89 runs. 

Earlier, resuming on their overnight score of 405 for the loss of seven wickets Bengal could only add 57 runs. 

Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta top-scored with 143, which was studded with 13 fours.

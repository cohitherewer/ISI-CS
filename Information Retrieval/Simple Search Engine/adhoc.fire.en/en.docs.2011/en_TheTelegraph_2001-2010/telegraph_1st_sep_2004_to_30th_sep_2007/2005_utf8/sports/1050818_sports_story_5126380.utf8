 Pay hikes for Younis, Afridi 

Karachi: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan and allrounder Shahid Afridi have been given pay raises by the countrys cricket board, putting them in a group of six contracted players receiving the highest salaries. 

The one-year contracts offered last month by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to a total of 20 players award the elite group a monthly salary of Pakistan Rs 200,000 on top of match and tour fees. 

Younis and Afridi have performed outstandingly since last winter and deserved this promotion, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Wednesday. 

The two join captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Yousuf Youhana, Shoaib Akhtar and Abdul Razzaq as the highest paid performers.

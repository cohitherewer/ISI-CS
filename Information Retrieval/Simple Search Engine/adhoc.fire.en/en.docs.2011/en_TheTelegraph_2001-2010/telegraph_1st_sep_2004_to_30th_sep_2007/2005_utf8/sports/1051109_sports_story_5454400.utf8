 Banajee, Gill to represent India

Mumbai: Punes Rayomand Banajee and Delhis Gaurav Gill have been selected by the Motorsports Association Of India (MAI) to represent the country at the forthcoming Taiwan International Auto Gymkhana to be held in Taipei on November 12 and 13. 

Banajee said that the event provided a level platform to all drivers as everyone has to drive the same car. 

So it is down to driver skill. I am sure this event will raise awareness about this form of motorsport, he stated in a press release. 

Auto gymkhanas allow ordinary people to participate in their own road cars at a negligible cost. This is bound to get many more people involved with motorsport in countries like India where costs are a prohibitory factor, the national Go-Karting champion was stated. 

Delhi-based driver and 2004 Formula Maruti champion Gaurav Gill, who has been into motorsports since he was 17, echoed Banajee. 

Gill welcomed the plans of MAI and CTMSA of making this an annual event, with a round of the proposed Asian Zone Gymkhana Championship to be held in India next year as well. 

This will help the sport to grow in India and Asia as every year new drivers will be given a similar opportunity to test their skills against the top drivers of the region, resulting in higher level of drivers in Asia, he said. 

Gill further added that this experience could result in making it easier to find sponsors for future motorsports events. 

The team is scheduled to leave for Taipei on November 10.

 India humbled by Fiji outfit

 - Trinidad extend invitation 

New Delhi: India may have moved up four places to No. 131 in the latest Fifa rankings, but their performance against low-key teams continues to generate wonder about such progress. 

Following the trail of a 1-1 draw versus Pakistan in a three-match series, Sukhwinder Singhs team suffered another round of ignominy when they started their tour of Fiji with a 0-1 defeat. This time, the agents of the humiliation were not even the Fijian national side, but a local outfit ? BA XI. 

 India, led by S. Venkatesh, are slated to play two friendlies against the Fiji national side in Lautoka on Friday and in Suva on Sunday during the exposure trip. 

Meanwhile, Fifa vice-president Jack Warner has invited India to come and play some matches in Trinidad and Tobago. 

The Trinidad-born Warner placed the invitation while addressing the first ever economic forum between India and CARICOM at the Centre of Excellence in Port-of-Spain. 

Warner suggested that when the second economic forum is programmed for next year, he would be happy to host an Indian football team at this venue. 

Indias minister of state for commerce and industry E.V.K.S. Elangovan responded favourably to the invitation.

 England gaining momentum, feels Darren Gough

 Gough feels good about the selection procedure these days 

Melbourne: England can look forward to this year?s Ashes series with confidence despite suffering their first Test defeat for over a year this week, England fast bowler Darren Gough said on Friday. 

Gough, who retired from Test cricket in 2003 but remains in the national one-day squad, said England were gaining momentum for this year?s five home Tests against the top-ranked Australians. 

?The players are playing their natural game,? Gough told reporters in Melbourne, where he is preparing for Monday?s tsunami charity game between a ICC XI and Asia XI. 

?That?s what we need before we play Australia. What we are getting now is momentum and selection is a lot better than it used to be,? the 34-year-old Gough added. 

England won 11 of 13 Tests in 2004, drawing the other two. South Africa won the third Test against England in Cape Town this week to level their five-match series at 1-1. 

Australia have won the past eight Ashes series. 

Gough, who took 229 wickets in 58 Tests, wore a rueful grin as he recalled the first of his four Ashes campaigns in 1994-95. 

?I genuinely believed we could beat Australia. Obviously after being 0-3 down, I realised that we couldn?t. It?s very difficult,? he said. Gough said key members of Michael Vaughan?s current England side, like all-rounder Andrew Flintoff and fast bowler Steve Harmison had the advantage of not experiencing several Ashes defeats. 

?We have players now who are at the top of their game. They are all up for it,? Gough said. ?Everybody wants to do it. When England win the Ashes again, I will be there at the ground, I?ll guarantee it. 

?We all watch Australia playing and you have to admire the way they have played in the past two series at home (against New Zealand and Pakistan). They blitzed Pakistan in all three Tests.? 

Gough, who has taken 213 wickets in 141 one-day Internationals, is preparing for a seven-match one-day series against South Africa starting in Johannesburg on January 30. (Reuters)

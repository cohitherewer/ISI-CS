The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fresh start for Agassi, Sharapova

[+uc('LIZ ROBBINS 

 New York Times News Service')+]

New York: Andre Agassi returned to the lights on Monday night for the 20th year running ? albeit only briefly. In an efficient 69 minutes, Agassi dispatched Razvan Sabau of Romania, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1. At 28, Sabau was making his first US Open appearance. At 35, Agassi has tied Jimmy Connors among the men for most consecutive appearances at the Open. 

Andre: 20 more years! yelled a fan from Arthur Ashe Stadium Court as Agassi suppressed a smile before going on to break Sabaus serve in the final set. Some moments it feels longer, other moments it feels like its flown by, you cant believe youve done it all that time, Agassi said, shaking his head about his 20-year streak. Overall, you have a strong sense for the full spectrum that youve sort of travelled. Its the relationship with the people that make it feel so long. 

He did not always have that relationship, he said. It took me a while to enjoy playing here, he said. If you dont appreciate the mentality of the New Yorker, they dont have a lot of time to waste. They expect the same from you. 

He did that Monday night, sparing no time on the court. The Open may never get old to Agassi, but it is all so new for 18-year-old Maria Sharapova, who started off the womens portion of the night. 

As the top-seeded player, Sharapova cruised to a 6-1, 6-1 first-round victory over Eleni Daniilidou of Greece in the first-round night match on Centre Court. The match lasted three fewer minutes than Agassis. 

Playing to cheers of We love you, Maria! Sharapova dismissed concerns of her slight injury ? a strained right pectoral muscle ? and waltzed into the next round. Its amazing to be the No. 1 seed at the US Open, its just great, she said on court after the match. 

The first three games was a little bit tough, Sharapova said. I havent played a lot of matches. I had to get used to the conditions in the stadium. I havent played under the lights for a while. 

Sharapova had earned the top ranking in the world for one week ? before Lindsay Davenport took it back while Sharapova rehabilitated last week. She said that her strained muscle was growing stronger and that in the back of her mind she thought of reclaiming the top spot. 

I dont feel like Ive showed New York how I can play tennis, she said. Hopefully I can put some good matches in here for my New York fans. 

She admitted to being intimidated by the city, however. I think this the toughest Grand Slam to win just because of the traffic, she said. Its a busy city and its hard to keep your mind on what you have to do. Its always rush hour. 

Monday night, she and Agassi set the pace. But while Sharapova is looking towards the first Open title of her career, Agassi knows he is not getting younger.

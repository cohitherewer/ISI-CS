 Lara hits unbeaten double century

 - WI star 11 short of equalling Border 

 Lara says he had targeted the final Test to make another huge score 

Adelaide: West Indies batsman Brian Lara was poised to break Allan Borders record for the most Test runs after blasting an unbeaten double-century on Day I of the third Test against Australia on Friday. 

Lara toyed with the Australian attack, scoring 202 not out to register his 31st Test hundred and take his career tally to 11,163 runs, just 11 behind Borders record of 11,174. 

Ive been working hard all series without much success but I was still feeling good, Lara said. I was making starts and getting to double figures but just not going on it with it. But I knew it was just around the corner. 

Lara said he had targeted the final Test as his chance for another huge score. 

Were not going to be playing Test cricket for three months so I was really looking forward to this particular Test, Lara said. 

His brilliant innings helped the tourists, already 0-2 down, reach stumps in the healthy position of 352 for seven after slumping to 53 for three before lunch. 

Allrounder Dwayne Bravo made 34, Denesh Ramdin 27 and captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul chipped in with 25. 

Lara, playing possibly his final Test on the Australian soil, came into the match on the back of a string of modest scores but was clearly in the mood for something special on a hot and humid day at the Adelaide Oval. 

He joined Border as the only player to score 11,000 Test runs when he eased his way to 39 and then raised his half-century off 92 balls. 

The left-hander raced to his century off 144 deliveries when he dispatched Australias fastest bowler Brett Lee to the boundary twice in one over. 

He got to 200 off 261 balls when he again hooked Lee to the fence then ended the day on 202 from 266 balls in six hours, featuring 20 fours and poised for another world record. 

The 36-year old from Trinidad already holds the world record for the highest individual Test (400 not out) and first-class (501 not out) scores. 

The tourists had been in deep trouble before Laras rescue mission when Lee ripped through the top-order in the morning session and leg-spinner Stuart MacGill made a hole in the middle-order after lunch. 

Lee dismissed Wavell Hinds and fellow opener Devon Smith in the sixth over of the day then Ramnaresh Sarwan before lunch. 

Hinds fell for 10 when he was caught by Matthew Hayden at gully with a ball that lifted sharply and caught the Jamaican by surprise. 

Smith departed in the same over for seven, also caught by Hayden at gully after he had been given a life when Shane Warne dropped him at slip off Glenn McGrath.

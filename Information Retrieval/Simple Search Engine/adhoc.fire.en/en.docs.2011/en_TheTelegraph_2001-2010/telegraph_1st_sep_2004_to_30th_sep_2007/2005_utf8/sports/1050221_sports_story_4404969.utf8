Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran recorded his second straight victory, humbling GM Mahamad al-Modiahki of Qatar in the fifth round of the Aeroflot International Open chess tournament here. 

The victory helped Sasikiran move to a fifty per cent score. 

However, it turned out to be a bad day for the other two Indians in the strongest Open event of the world. In the A1 section national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda suffered setbacks against Arkaditsch Naiditsch of Germany and Zoltan Gyimesi of Hungary, respectively. 

Meanwhile, a tactically agile Emil Sutovsky of Israel crushed Ukrainian Alexander Areshchenko to join overnight leader Andrei Kharlov of Russia who drew his game with Moldavian Viktor Bologan, a former champion of this event. 

As things stand now in the $ 30,000 first prize tournament, Sutovsky and Kharlov have 4.5 points apiece and are followed by Russian Sergey Volkov and Bologan who have 4 points each. 

A pack of 14 players are next, on with 3.5 points from five games while another 20 are queued next on 3 points with four rounds still remaining. 

In the A2 section, Grandmaster Tejas Bakre put it across International Master Ashot Nadanian of Armenia to take his tally to an impressive 3.5 points. 

The lead in this section is currently held by as many as 11 players who have four points each and Bakre is in a pack of 21 players who are on the heels of the leaders. 

The other Indians in A2 did well, barring youngster Parimarjan Negi who lost an engrossing battle to Dmitry Andreikin of Russia. 

S. Kidambi was in his elements in defeating Russian Dmitri Sokolov who played black. Getting a subtle advantage in the middle game, Kidambi had it easy right till the very end to move to 2.5 points. 

WGM Eesha Karavade recorded another fine performance from the Indian perspective as she beat Russian GM Petr Tishin who was at his wits end to find the right manoeuvres against some fast and correct play by the Indian. 

Also coming out better was former Asian junior girls? champion Tania Sachdev who drew with another Russian Konstantin Mesropov, also an International Master. 

After three straight losses in the preceding rounds, Tania got some consolation after this half point and still have some chances of getting her final WGM norm. 

In the B group, played simultaneously, IM Dinesh Sharma drew with Maria Kursova of Russia. After 6 rounds in this section Elmir Guseinov of Russia emerged as the sole leader on 5.5 points while Sharma is on 3.5.

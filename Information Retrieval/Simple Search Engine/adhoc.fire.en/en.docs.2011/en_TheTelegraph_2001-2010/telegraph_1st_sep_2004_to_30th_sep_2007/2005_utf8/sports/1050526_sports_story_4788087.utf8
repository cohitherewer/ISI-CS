 Ankara: Turkish weightlifter Halil Mutlu, a three-time Olympic champion, tested positive for a banned substance in the European championships last month, Turkish media reports said Wednesday. The Turkish weightlifting federation declined to comment, while an official from the government?s directorate of sports told AFP they were looking into the reports.

 A local daily quoted an unnamed source close to Mutlu as saying: ?Halil unfortunately tested positive for doping?, adding, ?he did not take the substance deliberately. However, he took pain-killers ahead of the championships because of an injury. The medications might have contained the banned substance.? The banned substance was an anabolic steroid, it said. 

 Paris: Barcelona forward Ronaldinho says it would be ?a dream? if Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry joined the Spanish champions during the close season. ?When I take a look at all the players in the world, I say to myself that he is the very image of Barcelona,? the Brazilian international told a French daily on Wednesday. ?We could take him right now. His pace and technique make him one of the best players in the world. It would be a dream to have him with us and to play with him.? Henry was the top scorer in the 2004-05 English Premier League with 25 goals in 38 games.

 Glasgow: Martin O?Neill is stepping down as manager of Celtic for personal reasons, the Scottish Premier League club said on Wednesday in a statement. The move had been expected since weekend media reports in Scotland said that O?Neill would end his five-year spell in charge to care for his wife Geraldine, who is ill. O?Neill, 53, whose team lost their league title to Rangers on Sunday in the final two minutes of the season, brought Celtic six domestic trophies and a place in the 2003 UEFA Cup final.

 London: Former England left back Graeme Le Saux is poised to announce his retirement at the age of 36, his club Southampton?s website said on Tuesday. Le Saux joined Southampton in 2003 and made nearly 50 appearances for the Premier League club who were relegated at the end of last season.

 Born in Jersey, he started his career with Chelsea before moving to Blackburn Rovers in 1993 and helping the Ewood Park club win the Premier League title in 1995. Le Saux returned to Chelsea for ? 7 million in 1997. 

 He won a League Cup winner?s medal in 1998 but his second spell at Stamford Bridge was dogged by injury and he joined Southampton two years ago.

 London: South Korea?s Lee Jae-bok, British Olympic badminton coach in Barcelona in 1992, is returning to the UK to work as a coach with the English national squad. Lee takes up his post on Wednesday and along with new head coach Ian Wright will help prepare the squad for the world championships in Anaheim, California, from August 15-21.

 Badminton England chief executive Clive Ricks said: ?We are very excited about both appointments as it will give England the stability we need.?

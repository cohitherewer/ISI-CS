The Telegraph - Calcutta

 It seems the sisters have it right, after all

 - It?s finally sinking in that too much tennis is a bad thing 

 Venus and Serena Williams 

London: Perhaps the Williams sisters have got it right after all. Their infrequent forays onto the merry-go-round of the professional circuit do not appear to be hampering the American siblings. 

In fact, while all around them are falling to pieces physically, Venus and Serena would appear paragons of fitness and rude health. 

Serena?s victory at the Australian Open last month suggests she is still doing something right and, rather than limiting her chances of success, her time spent on off-court activities may in fact be saving her from the crippling injuries others are storing up for themselves. 

While the Williams sisters have been frequently criticised for their seemingly lackadaisical approach to their schedules ? historically, neither sister has played nearly as many tournaments as their contemporaries ? it is finally sinking in that too much tennis is a bad thing. 

World No. 1 Lindsay Davenport?s body gave out on her during the final of the Australian Open against Serena and she is now leading the call for a shorter season and less tennis. 

?You always want your best players in every Grand Slam and I think something should be done ? a shorter season or cut down on the tournaments,? the American said last week. ?If you look at the last few years, it?s the most troubling aspect of the game.? 

Former world number ones Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters are also sitting on the sidelines, crippled by a surfeit of tennis. 

Henin-Hardenne battled a mystery virus for most of last year and is now struggling with a knee injury. Clijsters had wrist surgery last June and has played just one lower-tier WTA Tour tournament since. 

Henin-Hardenne has joined Davenport?s call. The Belgian suffered a nightmare 2004 in which she was largely bed-ridden for eight months with what had been deemed to be a mystery virus. 

She now claims she was actually suffering from ?burnout? ? at just 22. ?It was more than a viral infection. I think it was a burnout,? she said last month. ?In 2003, I played so many matches and worked so hard that I really never stopped playing, never took a break. This kind of thing happens to all of us.? 

Henin-Hardenne?s debilitating illness, which sapped her energy and left her constantly feeling lethargic, restricted her to just nine tournaments in a stop-start 2004. 

She knows it will be tough to ring in the changes, however. ?It?s not easy to make a good calendar for everyone. We have to find a good way. It?s not an easy situation and I totally understand it.? 

Prevalent as it is now, burnout is not a new phenomenon in women?s tennis. 

In the 1980s American players Tracy Austin and Andrea Jaeger were both forced into premature retirement. 

Jennifer Capriati was another high-profile victim a decade later before her successful rehabilitation. Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis was forced out of the sport three years ago aged just 22 . 

The answer would appear to be less tennis. Until that brave decision is made, strapping and bandages will continue to be as much a part of women?s tennis as rackets and balls. (Reuters)

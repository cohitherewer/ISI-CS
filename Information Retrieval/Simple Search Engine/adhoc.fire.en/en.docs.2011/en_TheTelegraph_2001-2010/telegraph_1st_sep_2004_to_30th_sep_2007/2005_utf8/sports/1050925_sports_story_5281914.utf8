 PCB to oppose super sub rule 

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday said it would oppose the super sub rule in next months ICC Executive Board meeting to be held in Sydney. 

We dont like this substitution rule because we feel it is complicating cricket. We would oppose its introduction, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Saturday from Lahore. 

However, the former career-diplomat put his weight behind the technology that will be used during the Super Series. 

I would like to see more use of technology in Tests and one-day Internationals. I hope that ICC agrees and extends the use of technology beyond Super Series. 

Shaharyar, meanwhile, said the BCCIs election fiasco would hamper the correspondence between the two boards ahead of Indias tour of Pakistan in January. 

Most of the issues have been agreed upon, including the tour itinerary. 

But discussions regarding venues and minor adjustments would definitely be affected with the current BCCI crisis. 

Shaharyar insisted the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had not contacted him in the aftermath of Thursdays bomb blasts that left eight dead and over 25 injured in Lahore. 

The ECB have not contacted us. It was an isolated incident and I think ECB also understands this. These are minor incidents that can happen anywhere. 

But Ill be meeting David Morgan in Sydney and would once against brief him on the security and assure him that his team would be as safe and secure in Pakistan as in England, he said.

 IN THE CITY

 Indian tour greenhorn Shiv Kapur stormed into the final round with a tally of 10-under 206 and a four-shot cushion over nearest rival Vijay Kumar in the RCGC Open on Thursday.

 Kapur, who had a two-stroke lead after the second round, gave himself a bigger cushion with a fine three-under 69 and a boost to his chances of a back-to-back win on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour. Vijay retained the overnight second position that he shared with Mukesh Kumar.

 In the leadergroup Friday, Kapur and Vijay Kumar will be joined by local hero and former Indian Open champion Firoze Ali, who shot an even par round of 72 to stay at 4-under for the championship.

 Helped by Kunal Bajpayee?s eight-wicket haul, Tollygunge Agragami thrashed Calcutta Cricket Club by 100 runs in a CAB senior division league match on Thursday.

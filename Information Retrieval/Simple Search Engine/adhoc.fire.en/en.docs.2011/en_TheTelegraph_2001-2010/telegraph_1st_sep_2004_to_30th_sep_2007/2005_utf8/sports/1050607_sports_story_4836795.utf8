 Safin doubtful for Wimbledon

Halle: Marat Safin played through a painful knee injury Monday to beat wild card Alexander Popp 6-3, 6-2 and advance to the second round of the Gerry Weber Open. 

The Australian Open champion won his first match on grass in three years, but said his left knee injury could force him out of Wimbledon. It hurt out there. If it feels the same before Wimbledon, I will withdraw, the second-seeded Safin said. I will sit down with my trainer and the doctor and make a decision. 

Its more mental than physical, said Safin, of his aversion to grass. But today I played impressively, considering my knee hurt. Your heads not there because youre always worried about what happens if you move left or right. 

Safin said his knee has bothered him for two months ? without elucidating ? and made it difficult to work on his physical condition. (AP)

 Kahn accepts rotation of No. 1 shirt 

Berlin: Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn has reluctantly accepted coach Juergen Klinsmanns plan to rotate the number one shirt between himself and rival Jens Lehmann until next years World Cup. 

Asked when he would settle the issue, Klinsmann told German television on Saturday: Just before the World Cup in May 2006. 

Kahn, 36, made it clear in a news conference on Monday he would prefer the matter to be resolved well ahead of Germanys hosting of the World Cup next year, but said he would go along with the management. 

If its going to be another year, then so be it, Kahn said. I feel I have raised myself to a level where I would like to see myself. The two titles at Bayern have shown that. I dont view it as negative. I will take this challenge gladly. 

Kahn, who won the league and German Cup with Bayern Munich last season, indicated he would have preferred a more settled side, particularly in light of Germanys defensive problems ? they have let in 10 goals in their past five matches. 

It would certainly not be a disadvantage if a back four could get used to a goalkeeper. But thats not a criticism, it is just my view, Kahn said. 

Kahn played in Germanys first match in the Confederations Cup, against Australia, with Arsenals Lehmann getting the nod twice ahead of Wednesdays third-place playoff against Mexico, for which Kahn will again be in goal for his 80th cap. 

Kahn was Germanys undisputed number one keeper and captain under previous coach Rudi Voeller to the annoyance of Lehmann, who argued he had made fewer blunders than his rival. 

However, Klinsmann stripped Kahn of the captaincy after taking over in July 2004 and said the keepers would have to prove who was Germanys best. The pair has taken turns in goal in matches since. 

Kahn added that keepers could build confidence and rhythm by knowing they would play. 

These are things that one has to consider and for a goalkeeper are very important. Its not about what I think, but is a question of philosophy... Juergen Klinsmann and the training team dont think so, and I have to accept that. 

Kahn said he and the team were disappointed to have missed out on the Confederations Cup final after their 2-3 loss to Brazil in Saturdays semi-final in Nuremburg, but said they were fired up for the Mexico match. 

Its less about a place but a chance to see where we are or to see what we have to do. So we see this match as a step towards the World Cup.

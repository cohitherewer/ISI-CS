Bangkok: Japan beat North Korea 2-0 behind closed doors in Thailand on Wednesday to become the first team to qualify for the 2006 World Cup alongside hosts Germany. 

Striker Atsushi Yanagisawa put the Asian champions in front in the 73rd minute and substitute Masashi Oguro added a second a minute from time to secure Japans third World Cup appearance. 

Later on Wednesday, Iran became the second team to qualify for the finals with a 1-0 home victory in Tehran over Gulf rivals Bahrain. Iran needed only a point to reach their third finals but defender Mohammad Nosrati gave them a psychological cushion with a firm header two minutes into the second half. 

Nosratis effort proved to be enough and the 70,000 crowd at Azadi Stadium erupted in delight at the final whistle. 

Iran previously qualified for the World Cup finals in 1978 and 1998. Victory sent them back to the top of group B with 13 points from five games, one more than Japan. 

Irans final group game is away to Japan on August 17. 

In the Bangkok game, North Korea striker Kim Yong-su was sent off in stoppage time for stamping on Makoto Tanaka, who was lucky to escape a red card himself for lashing out at his opponent. 

Weve had lots of criticism but weve got the job done, Japan coach Zico said. The players have shown tremendous resilience, guts and mental strength. We deserve to be through. 

Fifa moved the politically charged clash to Bangkok as punishment for crowd violence following North Koreas 0-2 defeat by Iran in Pyongyang in March. 

Japan qualified for their first World Cup finals in 1998 and co-hosted the 2002 tournament with South Korea. 

Italy-based midfielders Hidetoshi Nakata and Shunsuke Nakamura were both suspended for the group B game but Japan, who only needed a point, always looked in control. 

Yanagisawa slid in to volley home from close range after 73 minutes to settle Japans nerves. Oguro latched on to a pass from Tanaka to add a late second. 

The final whistle was greeted by wild celebrations from the Japanese players and coaching staff that echoed around the empty stadium. 

North Koreas outside chance of reaching the World Cup for the first time since 1966 ended with their fifth straight defeat. 

The players only played at 75 per cent today, assistant coach Pak Jong-hun said. If it had been Pyongyang they would have given 100 per cent. That was the reason we lost. 

Billed as the Battle of Bangkok, the match fell victim to a lack of atmosphere. 

The steamy capitals 40,000 seater Supachalasai Stadium was eerily deserted except for a travelling army of about 500 Japanese mediapersons on hand to cheer their side. 

Seldom can a qualifying tie between such bitter rivals have been played with all the verve and passion of a weekend kick around in the park. 

With the stadium doors locked to supporters, the only noise came from a small but diligent band of Japanese fans with a large drum immediately outside the gates. 

Other Japanese supporters had to make do with watching giant screens in hotel bars or on the balcony of a high-rise apartment block near the stadium.

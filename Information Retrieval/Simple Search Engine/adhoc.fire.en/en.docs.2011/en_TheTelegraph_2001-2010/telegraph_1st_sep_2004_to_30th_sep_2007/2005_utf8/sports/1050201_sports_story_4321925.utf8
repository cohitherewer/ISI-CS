The Telegraph - Calcutta

 AIFF shifts focus to grassroots

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A total of 22 state teams, divided into eight groups, will participate in the AIFF seven-a-side under-13 football festival at Kalyani from Wednesday. The seven-day tournament is a unique effort aimed at nurturing the game at the grassroot level. 

The teams in each group will play on a league basis to determine the winner, runner-up and the third-placed side. 

The winners of each group will then play in a knockout format to determine the champion. The runner-up and third-placed teams from each group will also face each other to determine the ?winner?. 

Bengal have been clubbed with Haryana and Jharkhand. 

At a press conference Monday, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said each team will comprise 14 players and unlimited substitutions will be allowed in each match. Each player, though, will have to play for at least 10 minutes. 

Each half will be of 20-minute duration and smaller fields and goalposts will be in play. There will be free-kick instead of throw-ins and the offside rule will not be applicable. 

Thirty-five players will be shortlisted from here and will undergo training for the AFC under-13 festival in Uzbekistan from May 2-8. Chinmoy Chatterjee has been named spotter and the selectors are Syed Sabir Pasha (TN), S. Balan (Kerala) and Mariano Dias (Goa). 

There will also be a individual skill competition where goalkeepers will take part in the ?goal-save meet?. The players will also feature in one-to-one, target hitting and speed, dribble and shooting competitions. The medical unit will be in place in each of the four grounds in Kalyani and the players have also been covered by the medical insurance policy.

 England among seeds 

Leipzig: Hosts Germany and champions Brazil were named in the top eight seeded teams for the World Cup draw on Tuesday along with England, Spain, Mexico, France, Argentina and Italy. 

Fifa has split the remaining 24 teams according to their confederations rather than their current world rankings or past World Cup performances. 

However, there is no place at the top table for the Czech Republic, currently second in the Fifa world rankings, or the Netherlands, who are third, or even the United States, ranked eighth, who edged Mexico to win the CONCACAF qualifying compet-ition for the first time in 71 years. Fridays draw will start at 1930 GMT. 

A special pot will contain only Serbia amp; Montenegro, the lowest ranked European team, to be placed in a group including either Brazil, Argentina or Mexico. Germany will open the World Cup in Munich on June 9 while Brazil will start their campaign for a sixth title in Berlin on June 13. 

Fifa has also ruled that any player selected to play in the finals will not be allowed to play any other competitive match after May 15, the deadline for the announcement of the finalists 23-man squads. The only exception will be for those players involved in the Champions League final, to be held in Paris on May 17.

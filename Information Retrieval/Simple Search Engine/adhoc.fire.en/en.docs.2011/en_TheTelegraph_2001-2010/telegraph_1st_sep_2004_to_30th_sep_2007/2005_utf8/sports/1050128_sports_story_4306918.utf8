The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Van Wely holds Anand

 - WIJK AAN ZEE MEET 

 Anand missed a chance vs Loek van Wely 

Wijk Aan Zee: Viswanathan Anand missed out on his chances and was held to a draw by Loek van Wely of the Netherlands in the tenth round of the Corus chess tournament here Wednesday. 

Anand, after the draw inched to six points out of a possible ten and moved to joint second spot along with Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, and England?s Michael Adams. 

With just three rounds to go in this category-19 tournament, Peter Leko of Hungary shot in to sole lead for the first time after holding out in an inferior position against Alexander Morozevich of Russia. 

After the draw, Leko took his tally to 6.5 and is now a firm contender for the title. 

The fifth spot is jointly held by Cuban Lazaro Bruzon and Russian duo of Vladimir Kramnik and Alexander Grischuk who all have 5.5 points in their kitty while Judit Polgar of Hungary, after a rather unexpected victory over in-form Topalov, is next in line on 5 points. 

Anand had beaten Van Wely in their last encounter during the Chess Olympiad, but only after the latter missed out in a simply balanced position. That game was also a Sicilian Sveshnikov and Wednesday too Wely employed the same set up to explore further. 

On Tuesday, Anand had played it safe vs No. 3 Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and had easily drawn his ninth round game.

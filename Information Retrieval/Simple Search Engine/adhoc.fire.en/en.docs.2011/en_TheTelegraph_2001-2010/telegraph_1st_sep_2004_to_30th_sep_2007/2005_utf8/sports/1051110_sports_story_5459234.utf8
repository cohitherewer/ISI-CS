The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Ashes defeat was a wake-up call, says Alan Hurst

 - The kind of support available today is amazing... I must add that the demands on players have also increased 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Rajkot: A back injury prevented Alan Hurst from playing more than a dozen Tests (43 wickets), but there was a time ? in the mid-Seventies ? when the right-hander was regarded as fast as compatriot Dennis Lillee. Very reluctant to interact with the Media, especially one-on-ones, the 55-year-old Hurst (in his fourth assignment as Match Referee) nevertheless found some time to speak to The Telegraph late on Tuesday. 

The following are excerpts: 

On Australia bouncing back after the Ashes reverse 

I havent been surprised... The Ashes defeat was a wake-up call and I expected a strong response in the Super Series... That Australia won the first Test against the West Indies (in Brisbane) with so much to spare hasnt surprised me either. Of course, I wont go into specifics as to why we lost the Ashes. All Ill say is that certain things needed to be set right and that has been done. 

On whether the post-Ashes call for the sacking of Ricky Ponting and John Buchanan wasnt quite in order 

I wouldnt like to comment on individuals. 

On what separates the Australians from the rest 

The professionalism... The superb infrastructure... The quality of our domestic cricket... We dont have many teams, but the competition for places is fierce. The academy concept has also worked very well and players from beyond the big cities have had opportunities. Earlier, in some states, it used to be difficult if you were from the countryside. 

On the outlook during his playing days 

(Laughs) We werent professionals and played for the love of the country and the game... The infrastructure wasnt as good and we didnt have any support staff. Those days, only a manager and the baggage man accompanied the Australian team. 

On whether the presence of a physio and a physical trainer would have prevented an early end to his career 

Perhaps, yes... They would certainly have made a difference... I think all of us would have gained if an analyst was there, too... The kind of support available today is amazing and I applaud the Boards. I must add that the demands on players have also increased. 

On the back injury he suffered during the Bangalore Test on the 1979-80 tour of India under Kim Hughes 

I was at the peak of my career... The injury was such that the Board considered hospitalising me in India itself. Eventually, it was decided I would return home... I hardly played after that, but the good thing is that my replacement, Geoff Lawson, went on to serve Australia very well. 

[Hurst had also played during the Kerry Packer-hit series in 1977-78, when Bobby Simpson and Bishan Singh Bedi were the captains.] 

On the quick he looked up to 

Lillee... Admired his bowling, admired his mental toughness... Lesser mortals would have given up with the injuries he had... I was his roommate for four months on our 1975 tour of England (five Tests and the inaugural World Cup) and learnt so much. He was terrific. 

On not getting to play in that World Cup 

(Laughs again) Thats because nobody got injured... In any case, Australia had a great attack: Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Gary Gilmour, Max Walker, Ashley Mallet... 

On the quicks besides Lillee whom he admired 

Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner... Then, Imran Khan and Kapil Dev. Imran and Kapil deserve more praise because of the conditions in which they did much of their bowling. Indeed, pitches in the subcontinent are usually unkind towards fast bowlers. 

On the Shoaib Akhtars and Brett Lees of the present times 

They believe in pace... Thats their forte. 

On the ideal approach for young quicks 

They should leave it to their respective coaches to determine whats best. If its pace alone, well, so be it. However, they must allow the coach to guide them. I expect coaches to have both a short and long term perspective. 

On his message to the captains at the customary pre-series meeting 

(After a pause) Im not comfortable talking about it... I wont go into what I emphasise, but I do say that the game is to be played within what is laid out. 

Finally, whether he has had the time to have a beer or two with one-time captain Greg Chappell 

Actually, no... Were in quite different roles till Vadodara.

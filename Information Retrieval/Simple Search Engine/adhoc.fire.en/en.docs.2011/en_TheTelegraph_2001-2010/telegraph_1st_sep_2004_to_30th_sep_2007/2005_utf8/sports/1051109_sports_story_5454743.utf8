 Indian eves Lords debut next August

London: The Indian womens team would play its first match ever at Lords when they take on hosts England in an ODI next year. 

It has been Indias dream to play at the home of cricket and I feel the timing has never been better, said womens cricket chief Gill McConway. For England, it would be their first match at Lords in five years. 

The match is due to take place on August 14 and the MCC said admission to the game, scheduled during the British school summer holidays, would be free. (PTI)

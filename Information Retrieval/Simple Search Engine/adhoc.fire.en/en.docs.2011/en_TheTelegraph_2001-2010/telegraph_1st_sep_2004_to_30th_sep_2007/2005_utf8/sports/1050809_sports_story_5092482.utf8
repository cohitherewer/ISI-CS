 - TENNIS RANKINGS 

 Sania collected 103.5 points at the San Diego meet 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza on Monday officially became the first Indian woman to move into the WTA Entry Point Systems top-50. 

Sania, who was 59 last week, jumped 11 places to land at No. 48 after her fine run in the $1.3 million Acura Classic in San Diego, according to lists released on Monday. 

Sania also becomes the first Indian since Ramesh Krishnan to break into the top-50. Vijay Amritraj was ranked 16th in July 1980, while Ramesh Krishnan was ranked 23rd in 1985. 

His father Ramanathan Krishnan was ranked No. 3 before the Open Era. The highest ranking occupied by an Indian woman before Sania exploded onto the scene was 134 by Nirupama Vaidyanathan in 1997. Leander Paes highest-ever singles ranking was 73. 

 Going into the tournament, Sania needed around 90 points to break into the top-50. She accumulated 103.5 points (including bonus points) from her two main draw wins as well as the two qualifying round wins. 

Meanwhile, the WTA top 10 remained unchanged with Lindsay Davenport of the US still heading the list. 

On the mens side, the only change in the top 10 was Nikolay Davydenko swapping places with Andre Agassi. 

The Russian moved one place up to No. 6, while the American went down one to No. 7.

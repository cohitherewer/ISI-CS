The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Smith guides SA to 311

 - FIFTH ODI vs ENGLAND 

East London: Skipper Graeme Smith scored his second hundred in three matches and Justin Kemp hammered a spectacular 80 off 50 balls as South Africa amassed 311 for seven in the fifth one-dayer against England. 

 England were 249 for six chasing 312 for victory. 

 At the time of going to press, the visitors need another 

 63 runs from the last six overs. South Africa lead the seven 

 match series 2-1. 

Smith, who made a hundred in the third match of the series, batted through the 50 overs to end on 115 not out and put on a lightning 117 with the big-hitting Kemp. 

The right-handed Kemp delighted the crowd with seven massive sixes and four boundaries. It was his best score in 19 one-dayers. He had hit 57 off 36 balls in the previous match. 

It was the highest one-day International score ever made at East London. 

Darren Gough finished with a hattrick of sorts when he removed Kemp in the 49th over, bowled Mark Boucher for a golden duck and removed the bails to run Shaun Pollock out next ball. Gough took three for 52 while Matthew Hoggard bowled nine overs for 74 without a wicket. 

Earlier, Smith put on 90 for the second wicket with Jacques Kallis (49) after the home side opted to bat. 

Kallis knocked Kabir Ali out of the attack with five fours off his first over, but Ali returned to have Kallis caught at square leg before dismissing Herschelle Gibbs cheaply. 

The start was delayed by an hour following overnight rain. (Reuters)

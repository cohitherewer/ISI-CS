 Bopanna, Rastogi in last four

New Delhi: Karan Rastogi halted Sanam Singhs winning streak with a 7-5, 6-3 victory to advance into the mens singles semi-finals of the State Bank of Saurashtra National Grass Court Tennis Championships here on Thursday. 

Top seed Rohan Bopanna was in erratic form, as he needed an hour and 34 minutes to overcome the stiff challenge of Divij Sharan. Bopanna defeated Sharan 7-6 (7-4) 6-4. 

Bopanna fired 19 aces but also made 10 double faults. Twice, he made three of them in the same game to drop serve. 

Bopanna will face Vishnu Vardhan in the semis on Friday. Vardhan booked the semi-final berth after Ashutosh Singh retired with a back spasm. 

In the womens category the top and second seeds, Rushmi Chakravarthy and Isha Lakhani, had to work hard for their semi-final berths. 

Rushmi was stretched by Sandhya Nagraj who made a stunning comeback in the second set before the former pulled away in the decider to win 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. 

Isha had a 6-3 7-5 victory over Sonal Phadke. Isha capitalised on Sonals double fault to break serve in the fourth game and held on to the advantage to take the first set. 

The energetic left hander then went up 2-1 in the second set and saved five breakpoints in the sixth game. Isha will take on third seed Sanaa Bhambri in the semis. The third seed had a 6-1, 6-0 win against Parul Goswami. (PTI)

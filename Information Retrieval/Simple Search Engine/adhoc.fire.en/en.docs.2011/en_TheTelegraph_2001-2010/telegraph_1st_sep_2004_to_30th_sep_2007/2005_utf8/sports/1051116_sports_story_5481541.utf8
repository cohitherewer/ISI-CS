The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Amanjyot takes lead 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Jaipurs Amanjyot Singh grabbed the limelight in category A (15-17 years) as he carded a three-under 67, with an eagle on the 7th hole, on Day I of the Nokia Eastern India Junior/Sub-Junior Open at the par-70 Tollygunge Golf Club on Tuesday. 

The 15-year-old was followed by Rahul Bakshi of Chandigarh at one-over 71, and local lad Surya Jai Prakash with three-over 74. 

Amanjyot didnt get off to a good start, with a bogey on the very first hole. The Jaipur lad, however, recovered and the eagle on the seventh was particularly creditable as his second shot found him in the bunker, but he chipped out brilliantly to find the hole. 

Bakshi had three birdies, on the sixth, 10th and 15th holes, but four bogeys dented his charge. Prakash, too, had three bogey, but an equal number of double bogeys, on the 13th, 17th and 18th did not help his cause. 

Udayan Mane led Category B (13-14 years), while Hemendra Chudhary was ahead in Category C (11-12 Years), after Tuesdays action.

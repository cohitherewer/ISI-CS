The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg for Sourav, Sachins presence

 - First two days of final camp 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Sourav and Sachin

Calcutta: Team India coach Greg Chappell would like regular captain Sourav Ganguly and senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkars presence on at least the first two days of next months cricket-specific camp, in Bangalore, for the 2005-06 seasons probables. 

In normal circumstances, it wouldnt have been an issue as attendance in that camp is supposed to be compulsory for all (around 25) probables, to be chosen on Tuesday. 

However, its assumed the ICC-imposed ban on Sourav is going to stay (and he continues with Glamorgan till the middle of August). As for Sachin, hes recovering from elbow surgery. 

The cricket-specific camp, the third and last in the lead-up to the season-launching tri-series in Sri Lanka, is slated for mid-July. 

Till the other day, the July 12-22 window was being talked about. According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, though, the camp may now start a day late to enable Sourav make it after the July 8-11 Championship game versus Nottinghamshire. 

After that, Glamorgans next engagement is on July 17. Sourav, therefore, can spend two days in Bangalore and still not miss any game. 

As attendance isnt compulsory for the second (physical conditioning) camp, and the first is exclusively for the quicks, Gregs interaction with all the probables will only be at the cricket-specific camp. So, Sourav and Sachin must be there for at least the first two days, the source added. 

Obviously, Greg wants to quickly share his vision, besides making the ground rules of his functioning clear from Day 1. 

Greg hasnt spoken about it, but it appears everybody is going to start from zero in his era. 

The coach just has two years and, if anybody trips rather badly, there may not be enough time to firmly get back on both feet. 

Moreover, Greg believes players should help themselves instead of waiting to be helped.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Don?t underestimate us: Inzy

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq took a pot shot at Team India captain Sourav Ganguly in the city Saturday. He had sent out a warning before he left home. 

?I hope India do not underestimate us on the basis that we have an inexperienced and young team as compared to them or because we don?t have same superstars or match-winners as we had on the 1987 and 1999 tours,? he had said. 

Later, at a commercial shoot at the Kishore Bharati Stadium in Santoshpur, he was maha thrilled, in period costume, charging Team India captain Maharaj Sourav Ganguly as the crowds welled, a pretty heavy brigade from across the border. Whatever the effect with the spear, the bat came through as the main weapon. 

The effect was to provide the sharpest contest, the costume and battle preparations. The crowd cheered, not many noticing those pretty modern sports shoes. 

He added: ?My team has a lion?s heart and that?s what you require to excel in countries like India. We have also managed to find some positives in our defeats in Australia which will help us in India. Victories in the last three ODIs versus India will motivate us further.? 

Inzamam leaves for home, via Delhi and Dubai, on Sunday.

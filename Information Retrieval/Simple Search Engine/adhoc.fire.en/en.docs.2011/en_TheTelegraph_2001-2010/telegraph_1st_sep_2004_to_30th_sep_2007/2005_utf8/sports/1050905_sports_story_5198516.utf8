 Steffi my inspiration, says Agassi

 Andre Agassi after his win at Flushing Meadow on Saturday 

New York: Andre Agassi said after his third round win over Czech Tomas Berdych on Saturday that his wife, Steffi Graf, was an inspiration to him. 

I suppose watching her going about her life is the greatest lesson I could learn, said Agassi, who is mounting a campaign for a third US Open title in his 20th successive trip to Flushing Meadow. 

I mean, in tennis, when you evolve as a person and youre more disciplined in your life and more commitment and passion and focus and intensity, it all translates into the tennis court, and vice-versa. 

When you start showing more discipline on the court, then your life starts to reflect that. 

Agassi, who expresses a new appreciation for his career now at age 35, said he is most grateful for the life lessons he has learned from Steffi, winner of 22 Grand Slam singles titles. 

Seeing how Stef went about parts of her career, most of it I wasnt anywhere near seeing close up, but more importantly how she goes about her life, he said about her greatest influence on him. 

Its pretty clear focus, every day reflecting her values and priorities. So I aspire to that. 

Agassis new maturity in recent years has also extended to his wardrobe. The once-flamboyant star, who used to bleach his long hair and wear denim shorts and iridescent colours, now performs in classic tennis whites. 

Im at the stage where Ive just thought to myself, If I dress like my wife, maybe I can play like my wife, he said, drawing a big laugh at his news conference. Been working, by the way. 

Agassi dug deep against the 19 year old Berdych to clinch a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory in two-and-a-half hours. 

I went out there and I certainly didnt have my rhythm, Agassi said. I wasnt timing the ball very well. A little bit had to do with the way he was hitting it but I was just sort of out of sorts. 

I think he got a little careless early in the second, allowed me to settle in a little bit more. Then the standard started gradually picking up. 

Agassi, champion at Flushing Meadow in 1994 and 1999, will play unseeded Belgian Xavier Malisse for a place in the quarter finals. 

We played a few times, Agassi said. Hes a talented player with a great flair for the game. He has a big forehand and solid backhand and moves incredibly well. He has a deceptive first serve and it can get very streaky. Its always a tough match when we play, its always toe-to-toe tennis.

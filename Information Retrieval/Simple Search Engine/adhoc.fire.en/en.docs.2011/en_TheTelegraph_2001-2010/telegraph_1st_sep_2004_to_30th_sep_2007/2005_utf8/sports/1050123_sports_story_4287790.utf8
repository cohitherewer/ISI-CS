 Depleted West take on East today

 East will bank on Ranadeb?s form 

Mumbai: West Zone take on East Zone in a Deodhar Trophy tie at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday. The big names, though, will be missing. West will be sans Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan, while East won?t have the services of Team Indian captain Sourav Ganguly. 

West will also miss former India spinners Sairaj Bahutule and Ro mesh Powar, both sidelined by injuries. 

Ajit Agarkar will have to lead from the front. West will also be banking on the skipper?s Mumbai teammates Vinayak Mane, Amol Muzumdar, Baroda?s Satyajit Parab, Maharashtra?s Dhiraj Jadhav, Gujarat duo Akash Christian and Parthiv Patel to put up a good total on what is likely to be a bowler-friendly wicket. The new ball is likely to be shared by Agarkar, Irfan Pathan (senior) and Siddharth Trivedi. 

East will depend heavily on the Bengal players, seven of whom could make the XI. Skipper Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and allrounder Sanjib Sanyal will bolster the batting, while medium-pacers Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose and off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri will be key members of the bowling attack. 

Bose, in particular, will look to continue his wonderful Ranji Trophy form. The lanky paceman emerged Bengal?s top wicket-taker with a haul of 32. 

West also need to watch out for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Jharkhand?s wicketkeeper-batsman who recently made his ODI debut.

 Sporting storm into semi-finals

 Dudu scored a brace and was adjudged MoM 

Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa delivered a strong warning to the opponents when they thrashed Fransa Pax 4-1 and stormed into the Federation Cup semi-finals on Monday. 

Sporting, who led 2-0 at half-time at the Nehru Stadium, scored through Chidi Edeh (28th), Dudu Omagbemi (40th, 48th) and Nicholas Rodrigues (58th). Fransa Pax pulled one back in the 65th minute through Peter Rodriuges. 

Referee K. Sankar showed yellow cards to Sportings Hardeep Saini, Suresh David and Fransas Creson Antao and Surajit Roy. 

Dudu, who scored the brace, was declared the Man-of-the-Match. Sporting coach Clifford Chukuwama was happy with Mondays win and the way his two strikers Chidi and Dudu performed. 

It is good that they adjusted together quickly in a short span of time. The victory should not lead to creep into the minds of the boys which will result in complacency. I am confident my boys will put up a good show in the semi-finals, Chukwama said. 

The match failed to rise to any great heights and lacked the impetus of Sundays match between East Bengal and Churchill Brothers that enthralled the crowd till the very end. 

Sporting started in right earnest and probed into the rival half with steady flow of passes, mostly from the left, and after missing couple of chances, went ahead in the 28th minute when Chidi floated the ball off a free-kick above the defensive wall and found the far post to the right of keeper Rajat Guha. 

They increased the lead five minutes before the interval when Dudu capitalised on a miss-pass, raced into the box and took a shot which Guha managed to block. However, Dudu latched on to the deflection and shot in. 

Chidi and Dudu combined well to harass the rival defence with the latter securing his brace after defender John Barreto failed to clear a diagonal pass from Chidi. 

The absence of regular keeper Mark Mascarenhas was felt by Fransa Pax as Guha was found wanting in reading the flight of a free-kick by Rodrigues. Mascarenhas, it may be recalled, was suspended and fined by the AIFF for deliberately assaulting a player during Fransas opening match against Mohammedan Sporting. 

Fransa got their consolation goal in the 65th minute when Roque Barreto floated a free-kick from the right to Peter Rodrigues who headed home. (PTI)

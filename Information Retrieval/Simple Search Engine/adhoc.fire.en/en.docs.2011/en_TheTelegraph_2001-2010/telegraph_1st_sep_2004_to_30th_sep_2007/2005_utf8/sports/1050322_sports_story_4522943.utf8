 Anand blows Topalov away to keep sole lead

 Anand gave an aesthetic display of tactical chess 

Monaco: A rampaging Viswanathan Anand blew away Bulgarian Veselin Topalov 2-0 in the second round of the 14th edition of Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament here. 

Anand gave an aesthetic display of positional and tactical chess in two games of the day and remained the sole leader with an absolute score of 4/4 that is a record of sorts here. 

The Indian ace, who started with a 2-0 drubbing of Spaniard Alexei Shirov in round one, now sits pretty with a slender half point lead over nearest rival Peter Svidler of Russia, who crushed Israeli Boris Gelfand in both form of the games to move to 3.5 points. 

With nine rounds still to come in this unique competition with one blindfold and one rapid game in each round, Vasily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Russians Vladimir Kramnik and Evgeny Bareev were on joint third spot with 2.5 points in their kitty and from what was evident from the first two rounds, it might just be a race between Svidler and Anand from now onwards. 

A winner here on as many as three previous occasions, Anand lived up to his billing in the blindfold game where despite black he was able to convincingly outsmart Topalov. 

In the blindfold game here, the players just have access to a blank chess board wherein they have to just guess the moves right and on this day, Anand just made about all correct choices starting from his Nimzo Indian defence as the opening. 

Topalov did fairly well in the initial stages of a popular variation but missed the thread as the game progressed to find himself in a lost endgame. The Bulgarian threw in the towel in 45 moves when he was a rook less. 

The rapid game lasted just one more move after Anand outsmarted Topalov from a seemingly innocuous position arising from the Berlin defence. 

Just like in the first round when he beat Corus champion Peter Leko, former Russian champion Peter Svidler ensured he was not far behind Anand so early in the tournament after to a terrible oversight by Gelfand in the blindfold game. 

Starting from an English attack, Svidler was having a tangible advantage when disaster struck Gelfand. 

In the return game Svidler made merry after a regulation exchange sacrifice to romp home in 52 moves with black pieces. (PTI)

 Title for Moodie

 - Japan Open 

Tokyo: Unseeded Wesley Moodie of South Africa upset fifth seed Mario Ancic of Croatia 1-6 7-6 6-4 at the Japan Open on Sunday to win his first ATP singles title. 

Its great to win, especially being down match points today and yesterday. I dont think its sunk in yet, said the 99th-ranked Moodie. 

Czech teenager Nicole Vaidisova won the womens competition after French Tatiana Golovin was forced to retire with a leg injury in the second set. 

Second seed Vaidisova was leading the match 7-6, 3-2 when a limping Golovin called it quits. 

Moodie also took an injury timeout for treatment on his shoulder after winning the second set against Ancic. 

In a match between two big servers, Ancic, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon last year, raced into the lead. After the one-sided first set, however, the final turned into an absorbing battle of crunching serves, great returns and dazzling winners. Moodie saved two match points in the second-set tiebreak, the second with a superb curling forehand. 

The victory for Vaidisova was her biggest title to date.

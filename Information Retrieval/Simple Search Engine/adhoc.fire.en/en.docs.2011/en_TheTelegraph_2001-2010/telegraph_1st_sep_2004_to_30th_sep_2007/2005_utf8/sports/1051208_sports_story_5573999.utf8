 Serrafina returned with a bang 

 STAR RACER

 More than her connections, bookmakers were more sanguine about Serrafina taking a smart jump out and win the Hyderabad Race Club Cup on Saturday.

 Otherwise there was no reason for the Vijay Singh-trained filly to go to the start as a 45-100 hot-favourite. Bookies were right, and Serrafina took a level start. Jockey C.Alford, too, had a tension-free ride as he kept Serrafina close behind the early leaders ? Blue Devil, Senor Pele and Autocop.

 With frontrunners running out of steam 300m from home, Serrafina pounced on them and went clear to score pulling up from a late finishing Noble Flash. In her previous outing, the Razeen-Passed So Fast filly had lost nearly a distance at the starting gates, and yet troubled the ultimate winner, Noble Flash.

 Alford, who helped Vijay mop-up a hattrick of wins, opened the stables account with Regal Romance who was sent out as the hottest favourite in the six-event card.

 The Royal Kingdom-Celestial Heights son won the 2,000m Birthday Girl Handicap in manner of a true stayer ? varying the pace upfront from the beginning to win by three long lengths. The horse is capable of striking again.

 The expanding odds of Vijays Averroes, in the 1,100m Bountiful Treasure Cup, caused no alarms among her backers. The youth of the Duja-filly, besides her good looks and the significant pull at the weights, separated her notably from the topweighted Aag ? the rage of punters in the ring, at 6-4.

 While Averroes made a short work of her five rivals, Aag had to be stretched fully to overtake Pay Check who held the second berth till the final 50m.

 In fact, the days pattern, of winning from the start, was kicked off by Daniel Davids 5-4 favourite, Poetic Moment, in the curtain raiser, the 1,600m Fair Haven Handicap. The four-year-old, who was ridden confidently by apprentice Melvyn Maseyk, could do the trick again.

 Alarico, who attracted an equal amount of support in the betting, found his rhythm late and just about managed to edge out Royal Contender from the second slot.

 Melvyn did equally well on Errol Bhungards Arabie and in a similar fashion, though the final verdict of a shade over two lengths may have flattered the second-placed Schumacher, who appeared on the scene when the race was virtually over. The winner, a four-year-old, could be trusted to strike again.

 The Harvinder Singh Bath-trained filly Karans Choice maintained the days trend and she also made it to a pillar-to-post victory in the Horendra Kristo Dutt Memorial Cup. The Sizzling Melody-daughter savoured the assigned weight of 54kg having spent most of the monsoon season carrying a heavy impost.

 However, the filly was given a fright, in the last furlong, by Daniels Wayward King, ridden by apprentice Amandeep Singh. Daniels Pure Valour, an unbeaten three-year-old till date, ran like a dud for a major part of the journey. He was seen making some headway in the stretch run. The 7-4 favourite may repay following, and soon enough.

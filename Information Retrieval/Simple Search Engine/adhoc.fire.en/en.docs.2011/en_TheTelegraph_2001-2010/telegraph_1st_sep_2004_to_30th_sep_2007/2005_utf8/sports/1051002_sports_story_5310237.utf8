 London: England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson believes fiery striker Wayne Rooney will learn from his mistakes and any attempts to defuse his temperament will nullify his impact. The Manchester United star remains suspended for England?s crucial World Cup qualifier against Austria after picking up his second booking against Northern Ireland.

 While Eriksson has hinted Liverpool striker Peter Crouch would replace Rooney alongside Michael Owen in a return to 4-4-2 formation at Old Trafford, he refused to condemn the controversial player.

 Rooney was booked in Belfast and substituted before half-time in a friendly in Spain last November to prevent him being sent off. He was also dismissed for Manchester United at Villarreal earlier this month for sarcastically clapping referee Kim Milton Nielsen during the Champions League qualifier.

 Madrid: Real Madrid president Florentino Perez inaugurated the club?s lavish new training facilities on the edge of the Spanish capital on Friday, and dedicated them to Madrid fans the world over. Their new training base, in Valdebebas near Madrid?s Barajas airport, occupies 120 hectares and is 10 times bigger than their former training ground in northern Madrid.

 ?This training facility is a dream made real. It is for Madrid fans all over the world,? said Perez. ?It will become a symbol of the club, and will be the base from where we work day by day to continue being the most important club in history. We want people from every continent to come and see it so we can show them what we represent.?

 Club captain Raul said: ?The players are all looking forward to training here. They must be the best facilities in the world. It will be our home.?

 Lima: Fifa will discuss whether an experimental electronic microchip inside soccer balls needs refining before it can be introduced at next year?s World Cup finals in Germany. Fifa president Sepp Blatter would meet with the international football association board to discuss the issue. 

 The microchip, designed to confirm whether or not a ball has crossed the goalline, has been used for the last three weeks at the ongoing under-17 world championship in Peru. The Adidas balls contained a microchip that sent a signal whenever they passed over sensors in the touch line, alerting referees via a special device worn on the wrist. 

 New Delhi: The Indian women will play their first match in the international football tournament in Vietnam against local side Cua Ong Province on Sunday. According to an AIFF release, the Indians? other league ties will be against Chinese Taipei and the Vietnam national team on Wednesday and Friday. The final is scheduled for October 10.

 Madrid: The Spanish government has passed a draft law against doping which will make it a criminal offence for professional athletes to use, or be supplied with banned substances. ?If anyone forces, encourages or helps sportsmen take drugs, it could lead to a prison sentence in certain circumstances,? deputy PM Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said on Friday. ?We want our sportsmen and women to be honest competitors.?

 Obihiro: Citroen?s Sebastien Loeb meticulously steered clear of trouble on leg II of the Rally of Japan on Saturday as he closed in on his second straight world title. Subaru?s Petter Solberg fought off a determined early challenge from Marcus Gronholm?s Peugeot to tighten his grip on a race he won last year.

 Loeb needs only a podium finish to retain his title.

 Greg briefs BCCI on players attitude 

 - Bowling department set to look different 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell

Calcutta: Team India coach Greg Chappell is understood to have formally conveyed his reservations (to the Board) over the attitude of some players during the recent tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

India, it may be recalled, lost to the hosts in Tuesdays final. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Chappell let his strong views be known to Board secretary S.K.Nair and chief selector Kiran More in Mumbai on Friday afternoon. 

The trio met before the selectors got together to pick the captain (Sourav Ganguly) for the forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe. 

For now, Chappell has left it to More to convey his reservations to the other selectors ? Yashpal Sharma, Pranab Roy, Gopal Sharma and V.B.Chandrasekhar. 

The selectors (as also Sourav and Chappell) meet on Saturday afternoon to choose both the tri-series and Test squads. 

While the Zimbabwe tour begins with the limited overs competition (New Zealand being the third team), two Tests are also to be played. 

The Indians first exposure to the experimental changes in ODIs will be during the August 24-September 6 tri-series. 

Apparently, the bowling department is either going to see a couple of new faces or the recall of one or two who have fallen by the wayside. 

Sourav leaves for Mumbai in the early hours of Saturday.

 Remarquable strikes it rich in main event 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh continued to reap the harvest and notched up another treble on Thursday. But it was his fellow-schooler Daniel David whose Remarquable grabbed the prize event in the six-race frame ? the 1,400m Robin Hood Cup for horses in Class II and Class III. 

 The winner, a three-year-old, displayed remarkable improvement and justified his even-money odds while handing a near distance beating to an equally fancied Alarico ? a Javed Khan-trainee.

 Vijay, on the other hand, completed the formality of leading in Knowledgeable, a 2-10 hot-fancy in the opener, the 1,100m Fizz Handicap before Ardennes and Regal Romance delivered the goods for the stable in the Real Danger Handicap and the String Of Pearls Cup, respectively. However, Ardennes had to be stretched out fully to contain Daniels Supreme Princess.

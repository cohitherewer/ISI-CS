 Spaniard wins 18th stage

Mende (France): Spains Marcos Serrano attacked in the final climb to Mende to give his Liberty Seguros team their first victory on this years Tour de France at the end of Thursdays 189-km 18th stage from Albi. 

Frances Cedric Vasseur was second, 27 seconds behind, after a late burst of acceleration took him past Belgian Axel Merckx, who was third in the same time. 

The three belonged to a group of 10 riders who had been given the go-ahead by the main bunch to have their day in the heat of the Massif Central. 

On the podium, race leader Lance Armstrong received the 80th yellow jersey of his career, one more than Frances Bernard Hinault, a five-time winner between 1978 and 1985. 

The American, who finished 11 minutes and 18 seconds behind Serrano with most of the other lead riders, still leads Italian Ivan Basso by 2:46 overall and is firmly on course for an unprecedented seventh Tour triumph this weekend. 

Third-placed Michael Rasmussen of Denmark is now 3:46 adrift after losing 37 seconds on the final climb. 

The peloton observed a minutes silence at the start in Albi in memory of Australian rider Amy Gillett, who was killed in a traffic accident on Monday while training with the national womens road racing team in Germany. 

As the race got underway, an early breakaway took shape as 10 riders headed out in search of one of the last stage victories on offer and built up a lead of 15 minutes. 

In the last climb, as each of the breakaways lost ground one after the other, Serrano, Merckx and Vasseur were left to battle it out for the stage victory. 

Serrano surged three kilometres from the top and Merckx, who had seemed the most active towards the finish, and Vasseur were both left behind.

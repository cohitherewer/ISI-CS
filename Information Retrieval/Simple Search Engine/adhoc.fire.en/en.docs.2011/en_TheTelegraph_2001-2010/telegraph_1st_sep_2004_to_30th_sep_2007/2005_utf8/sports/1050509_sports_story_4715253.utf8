Barcelona: McLarens Kimi Raikkonen ran away with the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday to dash Formula One leader Fernando Alonsos hopes of celebrating a fourth win in a row before his home crowd. 

Alonso, the Renault driver who has set the championship alight and fired up a nations dormant passion for Formula One, had to settle for a distant second place behind the Finnish Iceman. 

The McLaren crossed the line 27.6 seconds before Alonso after pulling away at a second a lap in the early stages. 

Raikkonens first win of the season, and third of his career, ended Renaults run of four victories in a row and made up for the disappointment of two weeks ago when he led at Imola from pole before retiring. 

?The car was perfect the whole weekend, we knew we would be strong in the race,? Raikkonen said. ?When I saw I was leading by so much, I didnt see the point to keep putting pressure on the car.? 

Alonso, who said he had driven a conservative race once it became clear Raikkonen could not be caught, was overwhelmed by the massive local support for him. 

?It was an incredible feeling, its the first time weve seen that here,? he said. ?Not only I but all of Formula One has to thank the public for what they did.? 

The race also ended Michael Schumachers hopes of a record-equalling success in Barcelona. 

The seven-time world champion had a tyre nightmare, retiring for the third time in five races, while his teammate Rubens Barrichello was lapped by Raikkonen at half distance on an afternoon to forget for Ferrari. 

Schumacher had won the last four Spanish grands prix and another win would have equalled the record of five in a row at a single venue set by the late Brazilian Ayrton Senna at Monaco from 1989-1993. 

Italian Jarno Trulli was third for Toyota, his third podium finish of the season, to maintain his second place in the championship. 

Toyotas Ralf Schumacher was fourth, ahead of Renaults Italian Giancarlo Fisichella and Australian Mark Webber in a Williams. 

Watched by the King of Spain, and with most of the 115,000 capacity crowd willing him on, Alonso could at least take comfort in an extended overall lead and his fifth successive top three finish. 

The 23-year-old now has 44 points to Trullis 26. Raikkonen has 17. Renault have 58 to Toyotas 40. 

The circuit lived up to its reputation of producing predictable winners, Raikkonen the 11th driver in 15 races there to win from pole. 

Never has a driver won from outside the top three on the starting grid and they did not look like doing so on Sunday, with the pattern set from the start when Alonso scythed past Webber to settle in behind Raikkonen. 

Schumacher did a longer first stint than the frontrunners and ran in second place briefly before the tyre problems. Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya was seventh for McLaren on his return from a two-race layoff due to injury, while Briton David Coulthard collected a point for Red Bull.

 Bangla aim for a sweep

 - Second Test vs Zimbabwe 

 Habibul Bashar says the job is half done 

Dhaka: Bangladesh, savouring their maiden Test win, go into the second and final Test against Zimbabwe at the Bangabandhu National Stadium here from Friday hoping to secure a 2-0 sweep of the series. 

Bangladesh, winless for 34 matches after receiving Test status in 2000, ended the drought earlier this week when they hammered the depleted Zimbabweans by 226 runs in the opening match in Chittagong. 

Captain Habibul Bashar was confident. 

?We realise our job is only half done and the boys are keen to wrap up the series,? said Bashar, who top-scored in both innings of the first Test with knocks of 94 and 55. 

Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore said his side faced a different kind of pressure. 

?Before our maiden win, there was pressure because we had not won. Now the pressure is because we are expected to win,? said Whatmore, the former Sri Lanka coach who joined Bangladesh last year. ?We have to guard against complacency. We are making progress and have to look at the future.? Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu felt his team could do better than their effort in the opening match. ?We did not apply ourselves well enough in Chittagong and our shot selection was poor,? said Taibu, who led Zimbabwe in their first Test since June last year.

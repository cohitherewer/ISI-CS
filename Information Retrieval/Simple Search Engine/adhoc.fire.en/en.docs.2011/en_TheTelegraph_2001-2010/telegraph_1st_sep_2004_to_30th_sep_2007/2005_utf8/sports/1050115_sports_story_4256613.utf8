The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Good draw for Sania

 Sania will face world No. 294 Cindy Watson 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza has earned a favourable draw at the Australian Open as she plays 294th-ranked home challenger Cindy Watson in the first round of the women?s singles. 

Sania, who entered the main draw courtesy of a wild card after reaching the final of the Asian tennis championships last year, could not have asked for a kinder draw as she walks out to play her first Grand Slam match in Melbourne next week. 

Watson is no mean player by any account, having played at the Open, her home event, four times and reached the third round in 2002. Her career-best singles ranking was 131 that came the same year. 

But Sania has age on her side, as she is nine years younger than the Australian challenger. Besides, the Indian?s 12 singles titles on the ITF circuit compares more than well with Watson?s seven. 

Sania, ranked 169th on the WTA Tour, is drawn in the bottom quarter that features Serena Williams, seeded seven for the event. 

But for Sania to play the American, she has to first get past Watson and a very difficult second round where she would meet either Petra Mandula of Hungary or Flavia Pennetta, the Italian 30th seed. 

The best performance by an Indian girl on the Grand Slam stage so far is that of Nirupama Vaidyanathan who reached the Australian Open second round in 1998. 

Meanwhile, in women?s singles qualifiers of the Open, US-based Shikha Uberoi lost to Teryn Ashley of US 6-3, 6-3 in second round. Shikha had beaten Lioudmila Skavrouskaia of Russia 6-1, 6-4 in first round.

 Karthikeyan makes steady progress

 London: Narain Karthikeyan and Tiago Monteiro continued Jordan Grand Prix?s test programme in Barcelona, making steady progress and completing test mileage of 76 and 32 laps, respectively. 

?It was a good day and among other things we spent time updating Tiago?s car to EJ15 specification, so he got some runs in the afternoon with the latest specification. 

?Narain improved his time, he did a 1:19.179 and was working through some more of Bridgestone?s tyre test programme. Tiago?s best time was 1:19.7 so we are making progress all the time and it?s going quite positively at the moment,? sporting director Trevor Carlin was quoted as saying by the team on the second day?s practice in a press release. 

The Indian?s inclusion in the Formula One stable has created a storm of talk and Narain is, in certain quarters, considered one of the best hopes among the rookie drivers that this season will see. 

The season, incidentally, will be 19-races long, too long some feel, but something that just might yield unusual results down the order. 

The top order, though, does not look like changing much. 

Narain has made it clear that winning is out of the question (even a podium finish) in Montreal, the first race. He has to finish the race, that?s crucial. 

Whatever he does, there will be a billion eyes on his every turn.

 Ernest Jeremiah 

Ludhiana: Defending champions East Bengal scored a 1-0 win over JCT Mills, Phagwara to consolidate their position at the top of the table in the National Football League for ONGC Cup on Tuesday. 

Ernest Jeremiah scored the all important goal in the 43rd minute off a pass from Shylo Malsawmtluanga. 

East Bengal are on 27 points from 12 matches, while JCT have 15 points from 12. 

JCT tried their best to draw level especially in the last ten minutes when they held sway over their fancied rivals. 

Though Sukhwinder, Daljit and Jaswinder came up with some great attempts, the equaliser evaded them. 

East Bengal played without their key striker Bhaichung Bhutia, who was out of action following two bookings. 

Alvito D?Cunha of East Bengal was declared Man of the Match. 

JCT?s next home match is against Mahindra United on April 3.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 England in trouble

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: England colts were tottering at 140 for six at close on the penultimate day of the four-dayer ?Test? at Eden on Saturday. They now need another 123 to make the hosts bat again. 

Earlier, the Indians resumed their innings with unbeaten batsmen ? Aditya Jain and Gaurav Dhiman adding 96 for the sixth wicket. Dhiman?s scored run-a-ball 54 while Jain made 41. Both batsmen used their feet well to attack the bowlers. 

The visitors, who have faltered time and again against the spinners, started badly losing two quick wickets with only 17 runs on the board. The first one to go was Michell O?Shea, caught brilliantly at second slip by Faiz Fazal off Dhiman. 

The other opener and their highest scorer in the first innings Joseph Denly (7) departed on the same score when he failed to read a Piyush Chawla googly. 

Captain and wicketkeeper Steven Davies joined William Gifford and tried their best to consolidate the innings. Davies made 66 andsmashed 12 boundaries.

Hobart: West Indies were battling to keep alive their series with Australia after a failed attempt to sustain a fightback in the second Test at the Bellerive Oval on Saturday. 

Already trailing 0-1 in the three-match series after being thrashed by 379 runs in Brisbane, the tourists were facing another heavy defeat after slumping to 82 for four in their second innings at stumps on the third day. 

They required a further 175 runs just to make the Australians bat again when play ended an hour early on Saturday because of heavy rain. 

Australia led by 257 on the first innings after they were bowled out after lunch for 406, but were eyeing an even bigger lead until their own batting collapsed. They had resumed on 256 for one in reply to West Indies dismal first day effort of 149, but lost six wickets for 68 runs. 

Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds, Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne made a combined total of just nine runs but a stylish 60 on debut from Brad Hodge helped push the total past 400. 

Brian Lara was unbeaten on 18 at stumps after overtaking Steve Waugh as the second highest run scorer in Tests, while Marlon Samuels was on two and batting with a runner after hurting his leg. 

Lara has now scored 10,934 Test runs, seven more than Waugh, and just 240 behind Allan Borders world record of 11,174.

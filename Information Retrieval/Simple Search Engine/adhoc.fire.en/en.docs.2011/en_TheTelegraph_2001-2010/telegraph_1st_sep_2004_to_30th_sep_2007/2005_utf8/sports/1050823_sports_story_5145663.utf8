 Seasons fifth title for Woods

 - Randhawa finishes last 

Akron (Ohio): Tiger Woods clawed his way to a one-shot win over Chris DiMarco at the $7.5 million WGC-NEC Invitational on Sunday, collecting his fourth victory in seven years. 

Jyoti Randhawa, meanwhile fired his best round of the week, but it was still three-over as he ended in the 70th place, the last among all finishers at the par-70 Firestone Country Club. 

The Indian, coming back to tournament play after a long injury lay-off, struggled through the week with rounds of 79, 77, 75 and 73. 

Randhawa, the Asian Tour No. 3, had two birdies in the final round on seventh and 16th and five bogeys. 

Earlier, he completed Saturdays third round with a double bogey on the 17th and a bogey on the 18th. Overall he had just four birdies in four rounds, 20 bogeys and four double bogeys. 

There was nothing pretty about Woods fifth success of the season as he struggled to a final round one-over 71 on the famed South Course that he claims is one of his favourites. 

But what the world No. 1s performance lacked in style was more than up for with grit and determination, tapping in on 18 for a winning total of six-under 274 to earn his 10th victory in 20 World Golf Championship starts. 

DiMarco, who lost to Woods in a play-off at the Augusta Masters in April, carded a two-under 68 but once again had to settle for runner-up honours with five-under 275. 

World No. 2 Vijai Singh had a final round three-under 67 to finish in a tie for third at four-under 276 with Irishman Paul McGinley (72) and American Ryan Palmer (69). 

Britains Luke Donald (67) and David Howell (69) and American Kenny Perry (74) were one shot further adrift on 277. The victory was the 45th of Woods career, moving him past Walter Hagen on the all-time list.

 Bahrain to host opener

London: Bahrain will be the opening Grand Prix in a 19-race Formula One championship next year. 

The Gulf Kingdom will start the season on March 12, with Malaysia following a week later and then Australia on April 2. 

The International Automobile Federation (FIA) published the draft calendar after a meeting of its World Motor Sport Council in Rome. 

The session also confirmed changes agreed earlier in the week, including a new three-part qualifying system and a return to tyre changes during races. 

The Australian Grand Prix has been the season-opener since 1996 but has been pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. (reuters)

 Kumble for Surrey

London: Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble has agreed to join Surrey next season, the English County side said on Wednesday. 

Kumble, who took 10 wickets to help India to a 188-run victory over Sri Lanka in the second Test on Wednesday, is expected to be available from mid-July after the completion of the Test series between India and the West Indies in the Caribbean.

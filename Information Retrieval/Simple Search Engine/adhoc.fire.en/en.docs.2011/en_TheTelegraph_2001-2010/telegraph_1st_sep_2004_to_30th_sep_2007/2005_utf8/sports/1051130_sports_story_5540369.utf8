 Pakistan inflict late strikes

 - THIRD TEST vs England Collingwood holds fort 

Lahore: Pakistan produced a fine bowling performance to restrict England to 248 for six despite a battling unbeaten 71 from Paul Collingwood on the first day of the third Test on Tuesday. 

Collingwood, playing his fifth Test in place of Andrew Strauss, saved England from total collapse after a strong start by Michael Vaughan (58) and Marcus Trescothick (50). 

Although fortunate not to be given out caught behind off Shoaib Akhtar on 54, the 29-year-old battled hard to hit 11 fours in his maiden Test fifty. 

He and Shaun Udal (10) had added 23 when play ended owing to bad light with 13 overs left. 

Pakistan took six wickets in the final two sessions after Vaughan won the toss for the first time in the series and shared an enterprising 101-stand for the first wicket with Trescothick. 

Vaughan, opening for the first time in more than a year, hit 10 fours from 91 balls, while Trescothick struck nine boundaries in his 28th Test half century. Off spinner Shoaib Malik completed figures of three for 58 to bring his team back into the game after lunch, grabbing three wickets in the space of 14 runs to reduce England to 115 for three. 

Wicketkeeper Geraint Jones was bowled playing a wild cross-batted heave at a straight ball from leg spinner Danish Kaneria to leave England on a precarious 225 for six. 

Four batsmen fell playing cross-batted sweep shots to the spinners and Flintoff top-edged a pull off Naved straight to Shoaib at deep fine leg.

 Strong start by Sussex

London: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly was yet to come out to bat in Glamorgans tie against Sussex as Sussex opted to bat on winning the toss. 

They were 225 for two at stumps on the second day. Sourav bowled four overs giving away seven runs with one maiden. 

Allrounder Irfan Pathan did not start for Middlesex against the Universities, but Harbhajan Singhs County stint for Surrey was off to a bad start when he was out for a duck after facing just two balls against Warwickshire. 

Surrey were all out for 340 and in reply Warwickshire were 181 for the loss of four wickets when reports last came in. 

Another Indian in the circuit, Dinesh Mongia scored 26 for his side in a Division II match against Somerset as Leicestershire made 254 for the loss of seven wickets.

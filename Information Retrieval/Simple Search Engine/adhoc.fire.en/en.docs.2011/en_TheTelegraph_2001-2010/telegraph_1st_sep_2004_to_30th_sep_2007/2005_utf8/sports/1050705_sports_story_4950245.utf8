 Laver: Roger could be greatest of all time

 - Naresh, Jaidip join the greatest debate 

AGENCIES/A STAFF REPORTER

London/Calcutta: Just two years after capturing his first Grand Slam crown, Roger Federer is already being hailed as one of the greatest players ever to have picked up a tennis racket. 

Soon after he captured his third straight Wimbledon crown, the Swiss world No. 1 has been flooded by accolades from all over the globe. The one Federer may cherish the most came from the one and only Rod Laver. The Aussie legend said he would be honoured to be compared with Federer. 

Following are reactions from a clutch of former players: 

JIMMY CONNORS: The way he plays mixing up the shots and the way he approaches match after match, he has set himself apart from the rest of the guys in the game. He wants to set records, he wants people 15 years from now, 100 years from now to look back and say during his era, he was the absolute best. 

NARESH KUMAR: Federer cant be termed the greatest yet just because he has won three consecutive Wimbledon titles. He has to show more endurance?. He has to win five more titles at the All England Club. He definitely, though, is among the greatest. He is a complete player with all the shots. 

ROD LAVER: I would be honoured to even be compared with Roger. He is such an unbelievable talent and capable of anything. Roger could be the greatest tennis player of all time. 

JOHN MCENROE: He is the greatest natural talent in tennis Ive ever seen. He is the most beautiful player Ive ever seen. I love to watch the guy play, hes an awesome talent. 

JAIDIP MUKERJEA: Federer compares well with Laver. In fact, I would put the two in the same league. The Swiss has no weakness. Im not talking of Sampras in the same breath as he had certain flaws. For example his backhand wasnt a weapon. 

 TONY ROCHE: Like Rod, Roger has the skills with so many options and a wonderful variation of strokeplay. He can rally from the baseline, use the slice and drop shots and play the winning volley. I havent seen such a complete player around for so long and Id put him up there with Laver. 

PETE SAMPRAS: His demeanour on court is pretty similar to mine. Hes pretty relaxed, goes out and plays. He doesnt have any holes in his game and hes a great athlete.

 We had the last laugh, says Ponting

Melbourne: Psychological warfare almost overshadowed the on-field action during the second Test between Australia and South Africa. 

Australia won the match by 184 runs just after lunch on Friday, though the pre-game comments and on-field niggles played a significant part throughout. 

Prior to the match, South African captain Graeme Smith questioned who was actually leading the Australian side, captain Ricky Ponting or leg-spinner Shane Warne, prompting an angry response from Ponting. 

But when you make statements like he has, then it puts you under a bit more pressure yourself. I guess sitting here right now weve had the last laugh. 

Smith, who had heated exchanges with Stephen Fleming after the New Zealand skipper needled him thought a series in 2004, said his pre-Test tactics were designed to create pressure on the Australians. 

The Australian captain also expressed satisfaction about his remodelled side beginning to take shape ahead of next years Ashes series. England won the Ashes for the first time since 1987 this year and Australias selectors have subsequently wielded the axe and introduced several new players. 

Since losing the Ashes, batsmen Damien Martyn, Simon Katich and Michael Clarke and bowlers Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz have been discarded. 

However a career-best three-wicket haul from his medium pacers in South Africas first innings seemed to give him confidence that carried over in the second innings.

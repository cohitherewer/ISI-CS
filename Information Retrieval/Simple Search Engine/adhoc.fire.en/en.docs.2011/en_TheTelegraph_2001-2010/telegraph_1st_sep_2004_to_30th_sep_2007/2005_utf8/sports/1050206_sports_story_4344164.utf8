 I?ll be back, vows Hayden

Melbourne: Dumped Australian opener Matthew Hayden said he had been treated harshly by selectors but vowed to bat his way back into the world champion one-day team. 

Speaking after he was left out of the side which beat Pakistan by 18 runs in the opening tri-series final, Hayden said he wanted to remain a part of the Australian team for upcoming tours of New Zealand and England. 

?Obviously when you love playing for Australia as much as I do, it?s very disappointing to get dropped,? Hayden said. ?I see this personally as a temporary thing. I will make sure that whatever it takes, I will fight my back in.? 

Australia will play three ODIs in England starting in July as the lead-up to the five-Test Ashes series. (AFP)

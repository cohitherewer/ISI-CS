 London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson wants captain Roy Keane to take over the Old Trafford hot seat when he eventually stands down.

 Three years ago Ferguson abandoned plans to retire and says he will be in charge for at least one more year, marking the 20th anniversary of him taking the job after moving from Aberdeen in November 1986. ?I will carry on at United next season and I have a contract to do that,? Ferguson told a tabloid on Friday. ?But when I do move on I would like to see Roy Keane taking over. He is a leader on the pitch and he could be that kind of leader sitting on the United bench too.? Ferguson, however, has played down the reports. ?I would not presume to have the authority to make these decisions,? he said in Manchester on Friday. ?Roy Keane definitely has the potential to become a manager. I think that will come eventually if that is what he wants.?

 Bucharest: Steaua Bucharest and crosstown rival Rapid have been ordered to play their next Romanian league matches behind closed doors after both sets of fans chanted racist slogans at each other.

 Steaua, which was accused of broadcasting ?racist, xenophobic messages referring to the ethnic origin of the opposing team? over the loudspeakers at Wednesday?s match against Rapid Bucharest, was fined $900. Steaua?s stadium announcer was suspended for six months for instigating the anti-gypsy chants. Both clubs have said they will appeal the ruling.

 Buenos Aires: Argentina Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona has tried to defuse the rivalry between his country and Brazil after last week?s racism controversy. ?Brazil and Argentina should always be friends,? Grondona said in a radio interview on Thursday. ?This should be a football match and nothing more.?

 His remarks came one week after Argentine defender Leandro Desabato, who plays for Quilmes, was arrested in Brazil. 

 The incident has sparked concern about possible reprisals when Brazilian teams visit Argentina in the future. The two meet for a World Cup qualifier in Buenos Aires in June.

 Ankara: The IAAF has urged Turkey to increase back to two years a drug ban imposed on runner Sureyya Ayhan or face legal action by the world athletics? governing body, Anatolia news agency has reported.

 Turkish sports authorities suspended the European 1500m champion for two years in February for violating anti-doping rules, but later reduced the ban to one year.

 Ayhan was accused of shying away from a doping test and trying to submit someone else?s urine sample ahead of the 2004 Athens Olympics. She and her coach have rejected the charges.

 In a letter to the Turkish athletics federation, the IAAF said that the right to reduce doping sanctions rested with it and not national authorities. It demanded that the original two-year ban on Ayhan be reinstated by next Wednesday, else legal action will be taken.

 London: Danny Williams has admitted his boxing career would be over if he failed in is bid to regain the British heavyweight title against Matt Skelton in July.

 Williams faces the unbeaten Skelton in his first fight since being brutally stopped in eight rounds by Ukraine?s WBC champion Vitali Klitschko in Las Vegas in December.

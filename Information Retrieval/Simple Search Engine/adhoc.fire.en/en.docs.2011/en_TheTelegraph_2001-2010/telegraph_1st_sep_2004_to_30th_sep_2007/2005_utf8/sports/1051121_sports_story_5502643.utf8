 West Ham hold Tottenham

London: Defender Anton Ferdinand headed a stoppage-time goal to earn West Ham United a 1-1 draw at London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. 

Spurs had seemed on course for victory on the back of a 16th-minute looping header by unmarked Egyptian striker Mido. 

West Ham keeper Shaka Hislop prevented a second goal when he saved an overhead kick by Robbie Keane in the 53rd minute. 

West Ham got stronger as the game progressed, however, with former Tottenham favourite Teddy Sheringham having a powerful shot brilliantly tipped over the bar by England keeper Paul Robinson in the 65th minute. 

Their pressure paid off at the death when Ferdinand, the lookalike younger brother of England and Manchester United defender Rio, connected with a Paul Konchesky corner. 

The result takes Tottenham to 21 points and sixth place, above Manchester City on goal difference. 

Chelsea lead the standings on 34 points after their 3-0 home win over Newcastle United on Saturday. 

Wigan Athletic remain second on 25 after losing 3-2 to Arsenal, now fourth on 23. 

Manchester United are third on 24 after winning 3-1 at Charlton Athletic. (Reuters)

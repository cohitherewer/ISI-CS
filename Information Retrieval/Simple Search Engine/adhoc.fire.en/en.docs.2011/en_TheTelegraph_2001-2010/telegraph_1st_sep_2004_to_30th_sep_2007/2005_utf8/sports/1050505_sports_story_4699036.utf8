 Boje out with mystery illness

 Nicky Boje is deeply disappointed 

St John?s: Nicky Boje has been released from South Africa?s squad for the five-match one-day International series against the West Indies owing to a mystery illness. 

Boje, the South African vice-captain for this tour, had been diagnosed with the medical condition and did not take the field on the last day of the fourth and final Test on Tuesday. 

Further tests Tuesday morning failed to clarify his condition, and Haroon Lorgat, convenor of the South Africa selectors, has withdrawn him from further participation on tour. 

?Nicky has been released to go home to undergo further medical checks under the care of his own doctors,? Lorgat said in a Cricket South Africa press release. 

?A replacement for him will not be flown out, as the squad has sufficient depth from which we can draw on. This presents a good opportunity for fringe players to take advantage.? 

Boje, a left-arm spin bowler and competent lower order batsman, was deeply disappointed. 

?I wanted to be part of a winning team, but health problems have to be sorted out.? 

The 32-year-old Boje left the field shortly before tea on the penultimate day of the match. 

Lorgat revealed he suffered a recurrence of the symptoms of irregular breathing he developed on the first day of the Test. 

?We shall exercise caution by not playing him until his condition is determined to be otherwise,? he said.

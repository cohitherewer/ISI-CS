Dharamshala: Mohammed Kaif proved selectors wrong with another solid innings to guide Board President?s XI to 91 for one in the three-day tour opener against Pakistan at the HPCA Stadium here Friday. 

Kaif?s unbeaten 42 helped the hosts ride over an early bump. At stumps on the second day, the home team are 182 runs behind the visitors? first innings score of 273 before bad light forced a premature end. 

The Uttar Pradesh batsman had faced 56 balls and struck seven fours during his 85-minute stay at the crease. 

Opener Dheeraj Jadhav was the other not out batsman on 30 (4x5) from 71 balls. The two had raised 74 runs for the second wicket after Satyajit Parab had fallen cheaply for 11, bowled while playing across to Rana Naved-ul Hasan. 

Kaif, ignored for the first Test, opened with a flick to midwicket boundary off Mohammed Sami. He found the on side fence once more before cutting the bowler to point for two more boundaries in the same over. 

The Board President?s XI skipper then turned his attention to Abdul Razzaq, slashing him over the slip cordon and following it up with a boundary in the cover in one over. 

For good measure, Kaif pulled Razzaq twice to midwicket to rub it in. 

For the second successive day, nearly three hours of play was lost due to inclement weather. 

Bright sunshine promised an entertaining day?s play, but soon blue sky gave way to grey clouds. 

Play was suspended one hour into the post-lunch session, and after two and-a-half hours wait, umpires were forced to call it off. 

But there was enough entertainment in the three hour of play that was possible. 

Razzaq stole the centre stage in the morning session with a fighting half century that helped Pakistan post a competitive 273. 

Razzaq?s 63 should serve as a warning for the Indians as the allrounder hammered the host?s bowling all around the park with 10 fours and two sixes. 

Yet, Pakistan fell way short of a formidable score they had hoped for going into the match, thanks to the fragile lower order that failed to provide Razzaq the much needed support. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal (34) shared a 59 run partnership with Razzaq in the only bright phase of the visitors? innings. 

Y. Venugopal Rao picked three for 48 with his part-time off-spin, while Gagandeep Singh and Shib Shankar Paul picked two wickets each. 

Resuming at 165 for five, the visitors lost Asim Kamal in the second over of the day. The left-hander failed to add to his overnight score of 43 when he was rapped on the pads by Paul. 

Razzaq and Akmal then combined for an enterprising stand as they took apart the Board President?s bowling. There were 11 fours in all with Akmal hitting six of them during his plucky knock. 

But Akmal fell after being well set. The right-hander was caught bat-pad by Mohammed Kaif at silly point off Rao, his innings lasting 55 minutes and 39 balls. 

Sami perished in similar fashion before he could open his account. 

Razzaq then began to open his shoulders as he hoisted Rao for two huge sixes. He added 24 with Danish Kaneria (4 n.o.) for the last wicket. 

The batsman finally holed out to deep-midwicket where Rao took a well-judged catch off Neeraj Patel, bringing the innings to end 10 minutes before lunch. (PTI)

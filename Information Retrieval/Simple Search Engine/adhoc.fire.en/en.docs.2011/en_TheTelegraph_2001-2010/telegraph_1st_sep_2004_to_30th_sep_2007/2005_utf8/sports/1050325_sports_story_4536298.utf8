The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harbhajan kept to avoid controversy

 - Offie?s ?tiff? with Younis melts quickly 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Bangalore: Harbhajan Singh 

 is quite cut up with Chris Broad, but it?s thanks to the 

 Match Referee that he retained his Team India berth in the 

 third and final Test here. 

Mediumpacer Zaheer Khan was all set to take Harbhajan?s place when, in a late rethink, the brains trust decided it wouldn?t be wise dropping him when his doosra action had just been reported again by Broad. 

 As was indicated by The Telegraph 

 in the Test preview, the brains trust feared the world would 

 give Harbhajan?s exclusion a twist ? thereby starting an 

 eminently avoidable controversy. 

?Harbhajan played by default and one feels sorry for Zaheer who, apparently, was told he would be making a comeback,? is how a well-placed source put it on Thursday evening. 

Incidentally, Harbhajan steered clear of the doosra in his first spell but did ?unleash? it in the afternoon. 

Whatever the build-up, Harbhajan?s big moment was his brawl with Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan, soon after he helped himself to a six and four. 

?Kuch nahin hua... Misunderstanding ho gayi... Harbhajan accha ladka hai,? Younis explained. The off-spinner, for his part, said: ?I was telling Veeru (Virender Sehwag) something, but Younis thought my comments were at him... Koi aisi baat nahin hui...? 

Fact is Inzamam-ul Haq and Sehwag, not to speak of umpire Billy Bowden, had to intervene. The question is: Now, will some planned needling take place over the next four days? 

 So far, this series has been played in excellent spirit.

 Bahrain: With all events in Italy already cancelled, the death of Pope John Paul II continued to affect sport on Sunday as Ferrari prepared for the Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix. After qualifying for the race in second place, world champion Michael Schumacher recalled the team?s blessing by the Pope during one of his last Vatican audiences on January 17.

 ?The atmosphere is very strange to all of us,? Schumacher said. ?You can?t explain the emotions and the feeling on the team.?

 The red Ferraris of Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello raced with black nose cones.

 Italian Jarno Trulli of Toyota, had a sticker on his crash helmet saying, ?Thank You, Pope.?

 The audience wasn?t the Pope?s first meeting with the team. In 1988, he visited its headquarters and rode in a Ferrari instead of his famous ?Popemobile?.

 Indianapolis: American Aaron Peirsol broke his own men?s 100m backstroke world record at the US world championships trials here on Saturday. 

 The 21-year-old clocked 53.17 seconds to shave nearly three-tenths off his previous best of 53.45, set in the first leg of the men?s 4x100m medley relay in the Olympic final in Athens last year.

 The world championships take place between July 17-31 in Montreal. 

 Mumbai: Three Indian women, led by Sonal Phadke, made it to the main draw of the $10,000 ITF women?s tennis championship on Sunday. Sonal, the top seed in the qualifiers, stopped compatriot Asha Nandakumar 6-2, 6-2.

 Joining her in the draw of 32 were fourth seed Tara Iyer and seventh seed Karishma Patel.

 Tara beat Oormila Ram 6-1, 6-2, while Karishma outclassed Deepanwita Chakrabarty 6-2, 6-0.

 With the qualification of the trio there will be a total of 13 Indians in the main draw, led by former national champion Rushmi Chakravarthi.

 The tournament proper, commences Monday.

 Berlin: Bayern Munich strikers Claudio Pizarro and Roy Makaay were injured in their 3-0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday ahead of Wednesday?s Champion League quarter final first-leg showdown with Chelsea.

 While Pizarro, who has a torn right thigh muscle, will be out of action for 10 to 12 days and definitely miss Wednesday?s match in London, the extent of an injury to Makaay?s right thigh was still unclear on Sunday.

 New Delhi: In yet another act of utter disregard for sportmen, the Ambedkar football stadium has been leased out for a political meet just weeks before the kick-off of the state league. The stadium would witness the BJP?s national executive and national council meeting on April 5-6, organised to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the party. 

 This means that the Delhi Soccer Association would have to defer its coaching programmes and maybe the beginning of the league since the ground would not be ready in time.

 New Delhi: Aided by a tournament tally of 15-under 273, Mukesh Kumar posted his first win in 15 years at the Delhi Golf Club here when he clinched the Rs 50-lakh PSPB Open golf championship on Sunday.

 Mukesh?s third straight error-free round of golf, a two-under 70, handed him a win and fetched him the winner?s cheque of Rs 8.1 lakh. Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia and Digvijay Singh settled for tied-second at 12-under 276, to pocket Rs 4,37,500 each.

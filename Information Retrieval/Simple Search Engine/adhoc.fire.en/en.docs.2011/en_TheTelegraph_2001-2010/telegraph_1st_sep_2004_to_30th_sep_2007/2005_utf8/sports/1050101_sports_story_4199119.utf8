 Prasad claims title

Bikaner: S. Arun Prasad annexed the 27th Asian junior chess title after a hard fought draw with Nguyen Van Huy of Vietnam in the 11th and final round on Thursday. 

Former champion International Master Deepan Chakravarthy, overnight joint leader, failed to convert a clearly superior endgame against G. Rohit and had to be content with the second spot. 

In fact, both Prasad and Chakravarthy tallied an identical 7.5 points out of a possible 11, but Prasad?s progressive score proved superior. 

In addition to the coveted crown, Arun Prasad, the former national sub-junior champion, also got his maiden Grandmaster norm from the event. 

The third place went to S. Poobesh Anand who had the best tie break score amongst seven pointers. 

Among the girls, Vietnam?s Hoang Thi Bao Tram won the title ahead of top seed and fancied women Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika. 

Harika and Tram ended were level at 9.5 points apiece after defeating H Sowmya and N Sandhya, respectively, in the last round, but Tram had an edge in the progressive score which was just too good. 

Soumya Swaminathan got the third place in girl?s section despite losing the last game against Mary Ann Gomes. 

Pune-based Swaminathan finished with an impressive 8 points and was the only one in the event to beat Tram.

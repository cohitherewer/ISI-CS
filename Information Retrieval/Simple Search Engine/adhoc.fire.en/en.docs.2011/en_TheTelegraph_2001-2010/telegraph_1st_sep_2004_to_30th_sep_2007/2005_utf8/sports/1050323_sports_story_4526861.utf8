The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Arshad set to replace Khalil

 - BANGALORE TEST 

- Yasir Hameed looks strong to take Taufeeq Umar?s place 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Arshad will play a Test after over 4 years 

Calcutta: Arshad Khan, whose last Test was over four years ago, is set to make the Pakistan XI in Bangalore. 

The third and final Test, at the Chinnaswamy Stadium there, begins on Thursday. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, the off-spinner will replace unimpressive medium pacer Mohammed Khalil. The latter was (to put it mildly) a liability in the second Test, at the Eden, which resulted in a huge loss for the visitors. 

Apparently, the Pakistan thinktank is also looking at dropping shaky opener Taufeeq Umar and recalling Yasir Hameed or even Shoaib Malik. 

Umar?s immediate future should be decided by Wednesday evening and it won?t surprise if, eventually, specialist Hameed gets his first Test of the series. 

For the record, Umar got 44 and 4 in Mohali; 18 and 35 at the Eden. The runs weren?t convincing. 

Meanwhile, the Team India XI is expected to remain unchanged unless, of course, the brainstrust feels that the grass on the wicket is reason enough to have a 3-1 attack. 

If that happens, Harbhajan Singh is going to sit out with Zaheer Khan taking his place. Only, doing so could convey that something is actually wrong with the off-spinner?s doosra action. 

A 3-1 attack was employed by India in the series-launching Mohali Test.

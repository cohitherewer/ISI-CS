The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 SA territory Down Under

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Sydney: One corner of the Four Seasons Hotel lounge became South African territory on Sunday evening ? captain Graeme Smith, vice-captain Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher, Jonty Rhodes and former team physio Craig Smith all converged there for a t?te-?-t?te. 

While Graeme, Kallis and Boucher are doing duty in the ongoing Super Test, Jonty is here as a guest of the International Cricket Council and Smith dropped in from Melbourne after attending a conference there. 

Jonty, by the way, is one of the selectors who picked the Super Series squads. 

Its always nice to catch up with friends... I spend six months in Cape Town and the remaining time with Nottinghamshire, Smith, who formed part of the support staff during the Hansie Cronje-Bob Woolmer era, told The Telegraph. 

Smith, who joined the County last year, added: I wish the Super Series had been more competitive... Thats a sentiment being voiced by millions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 United close in on Chelsea with Nistelrooy brace

London: Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy breathed more life back into Manchester United on Saturday, scoring twice in a 3-2 triumph at Fulham. 

The victory brought United to within seven points of leaders Chelsea. However, second-placed Charlton Athletic lost ground by squandering a two-goal lead in a 3-2 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, for whom Robbie Keane grabbed a late winner. 

Spurs joined Charlton on 15 points, six behind champions Chelsea, while United moved up to fourth on 14 points, the same as Bolton Wanderers. 

Elsewhere, Blackburn Rovers beat struggling West Bromwich Albion 2-0, while Portsmouth and Newcastle United played out a goalless draw. 

All the goals came in a frenetic first half at Craven Cottage where recalled striker Collins John gave Fulham a second-minute lead with a left-foot shot amid shaky United defending. 

Alex Fergusons side hit back hard, however. Van Nistelrooy stroked a 17th-minute penalty into the corner of the net after South Korean midfielder Park Ji-Sung was fouled. A minute later England striker Wayne Rooney rounded off a fluid attack with a clinical finish to give United the lead. 

Fulham were level before the half-hour mark through Danish midfielder Claus Jensen but Van Nistelrooy scored the winner before the end of a breathless half after being teed up by the excellent Park. 

Spurs left Charlton reeling with a superb fight back at The Valley. Playing in front of England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, Darren Bent scored twice to give Athletic a 2-0 lead after 48 minutes but the prospect of defeat merely spurred Tottenham into action. 

Ledley King quickly pulled one back, and Egyptian striker Mido lashed in an equaliser through the goalkeepers legs after 64 minutes. 

 Keane completed the comeback 10 minutes from time with a neat finish after a counter-attack by Martin Jols improving team. 

Michael Owen was left out of Newcastles goalless draw at Portsmouth, placing a question mark over his inclusion in Englands squad for their final two World Cup qualifiers. (Reuters)

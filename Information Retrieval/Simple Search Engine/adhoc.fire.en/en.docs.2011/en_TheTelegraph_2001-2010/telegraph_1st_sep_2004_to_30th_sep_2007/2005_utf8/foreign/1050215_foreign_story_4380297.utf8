 UK?s mobile mantra: security before safety

 Cannes, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Almost five million British children ? some as young as five years old ? will own a mobile phone by the end of this year, despite possible health concerns, a research consultancy is warning.

 MobileYouth, part of the wireless world networking forum for industry executives, said its research showed that parental concerns about the potentially harmful effects of radiation from mobiles on children were being overridden by security worries.

 ?It appears it is their parents who are putting the safety and security of their children over and above other concerns,? Graham Brown, a director of mobileYouth, said.

 The consultancy, which will publish its latest annual research into the global youth wireless market in March, forecasts that 4.76 million mobiles will be sold this year for the 7.51 million five to 14 year-olds living in Britain, up from 4.37 million in 2004.

 MobileYouth?s research into a potentially explosive aspect of one of the world?s fastest growing markets ? published against the backdrop of the world?s top technology conference in Cannes, France, this week ? comes one month after a UK report advised parents against allowing young children to use mobiles.

 The chairman of Britain?s National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), an independent research body, said while there was still no hard evidence that mobile phones caused health problems ranging from headaches to brain tumours, he was unable to categorically pronounce them safe. ?There is clearly a lot of concern from different agencies about this growth,? noted Josh Dhaliwal, another mobileYouth director. ?We shall have to see if it materialises.?

 UK mobile phone operators agreed five years ago not to market phones directly to children in what they call a recognition of the precautionary approach here. Handsets are not advertised during prime child television programmes. 

 But the latest advice prompted Communic8, a UK distributor, to withdraw its ?MyMo? handset, which was marketed as a security tool for four to eight year-olds, and Dutch electronics retail chain BCC to pull its ?Foony? handset for the same age group.

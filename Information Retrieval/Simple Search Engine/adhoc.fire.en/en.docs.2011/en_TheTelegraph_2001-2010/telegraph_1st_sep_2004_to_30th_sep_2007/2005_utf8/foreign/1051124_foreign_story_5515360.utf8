 Russian MPs act to curb NGOs

 Moscow, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Russia took a step towards curbing the activities of foreign human rights bodies and charities today when parliament backed a draft law that will assert tight state supervision over non-governmental organisations or NGOs.

 The state Duma (lower house) voted by 370 for, with 18 deputies against, in the first reading of a bill that would make NGOs ? from human rights and green groups to medical charities and sports clubs ? re-register, while increasing state supervision on them.

 Some observers say the move reflects the Kremlins deep suspicion of such bodies following the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in December 2004 that overthrew a pro-Moscow candidate for the presidency.

 NGO leaders had appealed to parliament, which is packed with President Vladimir Putins loyalists, to reject the bill, saying the law will allow the Kremlin to seize control of the last area of public life outside its reach. Putin, whose five years in power have been marked by greater centralisation of power, last July attacked the political activities of foreign-funded NGOs, saying: He who pays the piper pays the tune.

 The bill would also bar foreign NGOs from working in Russia directly ? representative offices would be banned ? and restrict Russian organisations ability to accept foreign cash.

 Cartoon salt in Israel cut

 TOBY HARNDEN

 London, Nov. 6: Iranian state television has broadcast a cartoon that glorifies suicide bombings against Israelis, depicting a young boy blowing himself up after being told: Go and show the Zionists how brave and heroic are the children of Palestine.

 The cartoon, one of a series shown by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting on Jerusalem Day nine days ago, presents the actions of a boy who kills himself to strike back against Israelis as an example for children to follow.

 More professionally produced and graphic than previous Iranian propaganda aimed at children, the cartoon appears to be part of a campaign led by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to elevate the issue of the destruction of Israel. The day before it was aired, he declared at a World Without Zionism conference: This stain of disgrace (Israel) will be wiped off the face of the world ? and this is attainable.

 His comments were greeted with outrage in the West and prompted Tony Blair to suggest that military action might be required against Iran if progress towards a nuclear bomb continued.

 At the start of the 10-minute animation, Abd al-Rahman, a Palestinian youth, watches as Israeli soldiers murder his family. They are seen laughing as they strike his mother in the face with a rifle butt and then shoot his father.

 Abd comforts his sister and weeps, declaring: Oh God, I must take revenge upon these bloodthirsty aggressors, who murdered my father, mother and brother. His cousin Karim introduces him to a neighbours son, Jassem, who is a member of a resistance group.

 Jassem instructs the boys to take part in an attack against Israeli soldiers, applauding their deep faith and telling them that they may become martyrs. Abds aunt bids the boys a tearful farewell. Go, my children. Go and show the Zionists how brave and heroic are the children of Palestine.

 As he lies in wait, Abd ties a string of grenades around his waist. The convoy approaches and the film s hows satanic-faced Israeli soldiers sitting in a lorry around an ammunition box decorated with a Star of David. 

 Abd shouts: I place my trust in God. Allah Akbar, pulls the grenade pins and leaps onto the lorry. When the smoke clears, the bodies of Abd, the Israeli troops and the attackers are strewn around the road.

 A young Palestinian boy then walks over to Abds body, takes his bloodstained keffiyeh head-dress, drapes it over his own shoulders and walks off into the sunset.

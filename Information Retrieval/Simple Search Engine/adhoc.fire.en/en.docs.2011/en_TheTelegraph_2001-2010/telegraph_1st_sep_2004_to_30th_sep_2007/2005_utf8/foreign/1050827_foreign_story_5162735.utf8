 Fine Print

 Skirting issue 

 Budapest, Aug. 26 (Reuters): The mayor of one Budapest district wants female City Hall staff to wear miniskirts only if they have completely perfect legs and the skirts are no shorter than 2-3 cm above the knee.

 Gabor Mitynan, a conservative who runs the wealthy 12th district, also wants male employees to wear blazers in summer, and told the website (www.index.hu) the dress code was needed because he had seen staff dressed like beggars or holidaymakers.

 Mitynan also dislikes crop tops ? popular in Budapest ? saying few women have well-trained bellies worth showing to people and wants the city to legislate on stocking thickness, proposing 5-10 denier for summer, 15 for spring and autumn and 20 for winter.

 Crowe suit

 New York (Reuters): Russell Crowe on 

 Thursday settled a civil lawsuit filed by the New York hotel 

 clerk he assaulted in June with a telephone. A statement 

 released by both parties said the Oscar-winning actor and 

 the Mercer Hotel employee, Nestor Estrada, had settled the 

 case but offered few details. Local tabloids said Crowe 

 paid about $100,000 to settle the civil lawsuit. 

 Girl cub

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Three weeks after a giant panda cub was born at the San Diego Zoo, veterinarians confirmed on Thursday that the newborn is a girl. The veterinary staff had its suspicions during the cubs first exam last week but chose to wait one more week to get a second look, the zoo said. The cub now weighs 618 grams and is 29.5 cms long from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail.

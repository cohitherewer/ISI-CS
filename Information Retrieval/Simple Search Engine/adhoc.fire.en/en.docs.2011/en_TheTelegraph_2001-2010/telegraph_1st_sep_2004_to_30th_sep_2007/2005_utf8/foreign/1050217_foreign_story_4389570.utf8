 Iraq crowd lynches suspected bomber

 Baghdad, Feb. 16 (Reuters): A crowd of Shias marking a religious ceremony spotted a suspected suicide bomber amongst them and, fearing he might blow himself up, beat the man to death, Iraqi police said today.

 The incident occurred in the western Baghdad neighbourhood of Bayaa, a largely Shia district, where residents were celebrating a religious ritual honouring the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.

 The police said the crowd spied a man mingling amongst them who appeared to be wearing a vest strapped with explosives, like those used in suicide bombings.

 ?They attacked him and beat the man to death,? a police source said, adding that security forces had been powerless to prevent the mass onslaught. It was not clear if the man had actually been planning a suicide attack.

 Italian scribe

 An Italian journalist taken hostage in Baghdad this month made an emotional appeal for her life and called on foreign forces to withdraw from the country in a tape released by insurgents today.

 In the undated tape, 57-year-old Giuliana Sgrena, a reporter for Italian newspaper Il Manifesto, said: ?I beg you, put an end to the occupation. I beg the Italian government and the Italian people to put pressure on the government to pull out,? Sgrena says in Italian, sobbing and holding her hands in front of her. It is the first tape of Sgrena, who was snatched on February 4.

 Grave-raiders face jail in UK

 London, Feb. 19: Three British boys were warned by a judge in London today that they faced possible jail for ?systematically? desecrating Muslim graves.

 One boy is only 14. The others in the gang, who cannot be named either because they are legally minors, are 16 and 17.

 They were convicted at Inner London Crown Court for knocking over headstones and pictures of a total of 34 resting places, including those of children, in the Muslim part of a cemetery.

 The vandalism was discovered by the local grave digger when he arrived for work at the cemetery in Charlton, southeast London. 

 The youths admitted conspiracy to commit criminal damage on March 17 last year, but denied it was religiously motivated. But a jury found them all guilty of the more serious charge. They will be sentenced on March 11 after their background reports have been studied. None of the youngsters showed any reaction as Judge Lindsay Burn told them: ?You must each understand that you had been convicted by the jury of a serious offence. There is a very real possibility in this case that each of you will have to go into custody.?

 Afterwards, the senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll, of Scotland Yard?s Racial and Violent Crime Task Force, said: ?Relatives of the deceased were shocked by what had happened. How would you feel if your loved ones? graves were attacked in this way? This was a very unhappy and distressing incident for them.?

 This is the second time the youths have gone on trial. An earlier trial in October last year ended inconclusively when the jury failed to reach verdicts.

 In the first trial, the court heard that the teenagers waited until cemetery staff had locked up for the day before launching their late night rampage. As one headstone after another was upended, one of the youngsters shouted, ?Paki bastard.? This is a common term of abuse in England aimed at Asians.

 The prosecuting counsel, Carl Hackman, said that what they did was nothing less than the ?deliberate, comprehensive and systematic desecration of gravestones belonging the certain members of the community, namely Muslims.?

 After showing a 10-minute video of the rows of damaged resting places, the barrister added: ?As you can see, there can be no question that the damage was deliberate and comprehensive and aimed at a particular section of the community ? graves of deceased Muslims.?

 There is no doubt that some British youths are simply absorbing what many Muslims see as ?Islamaphobia?. However, there are people of goodwill, too. The white collar union, Amicus, wants more Muslim women to participate in the trade union movement, it was announced today.

 Amicus has organised a trip this weekend to Manchester by a group of Muslim women, aged between 17 and 23, from the Tipton Muslim Community Centre in the West Midlands. Linda McCulloch, National Equalities Officer for Amicus, said: ?Dynamic, growing unions such as ours need to represent every part of modern British society. Hopefully everyone will learn a bit more about what Amicus does during the day and when these young women join the workforce, they will be encouraged to join a trade union. quot; 

 The problems involved in bringing Muslims into the mainstream of British society are multi-layered. The school ministers Stephen Twigg said today that faith schools must work to quot;promote understanding quot; between different religions. Last month, Chief Inspector of Schools David Bell said too many traditional Muslim schools were failing to teach children their obligations to the rest of British society.

 He called on Muslim schools to promote quot;tolerance and harmony quot;, warning them: ?Religious segregation in schools must not put our coherence at risk.? Muslims may also find themselves becoming an ?issue? in the forthcoming general election. 

 In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, a weekly newspaper, released today, Tony Blair was asked if the Labour Party was drawing attention to Tory leader Michael Howards Jewishness in order to attract Muslim support.

 To this charge, he replied: quot;The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous.?

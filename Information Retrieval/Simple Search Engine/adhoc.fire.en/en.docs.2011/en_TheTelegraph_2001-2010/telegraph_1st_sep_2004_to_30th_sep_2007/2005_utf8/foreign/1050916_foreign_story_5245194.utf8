 Stockholm, Sept. 15 (AFP): The worlds most expensive hot dog will go on sale in Stockholm as part of a UN-sponsored event aimed at highlighting the problem of poverty as world leaders gather at the UN summit in New York.

 Hot dogs will be sold in Stockholm for $132 a piece, said Klas Waldenstroem, a spokesman for the UN Development Programme.

 The goal is to highlight world poverty during the UN summit in New York by using the customary Swedish korv (hot dog) to show people here what it would be like to live life without having enough money for even the most basic things, he said.

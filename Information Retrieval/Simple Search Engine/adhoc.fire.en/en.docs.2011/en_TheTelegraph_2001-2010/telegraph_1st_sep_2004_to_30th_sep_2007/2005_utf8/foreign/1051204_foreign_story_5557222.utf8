 Bible nudes

 Theres a whole range of biblical scriptures simply bursting with eroticism, said Stefan Wiest, the 32-year-old photographer who took the pictures. 

 Dare drive

 Ottawa (Reuters): Heres a hint 

 ? if you want to drive away with property belonging to the 

 Canadian military, it helps if you take something small 

 and inconspicuous. When police were tipped off on Friday 

 that two armoured personnel carriers were missing, it didnt 

 take long to solve the case. The large and rather conspicuous 

 green vehicles ? complete with missile launchers ? were 

 on the back of a truck travelling on a highway near Toronto. 

 Police arrested the driver, who was working for a company 

 that had been hired to transport the surplus vehicles to 

 Montreal.

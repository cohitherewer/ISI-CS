 Canada boy killed in Cambodia school siege

 Siem Reap (Cambodia), June 16 (Reuters): Gunmen killed a Canadian boy and took 29 mostly foreign kindergarten pupils hostage in a Cambodian tourist town near the famed Angkor Wat temples today before being captured making their getaway.

 The gunmen, led by a private security guard at the Siem Reap International School, shot the boy in the head after bursting into the classroom, deputy Siem Reap police chief Lach Savin said. The age of the boy was not clear.

 The drama lasted eight hours. Children aged between two and six, and including 14 foreign nationalities, were held with their teacher in the classroom while frantic parents, most expatriates working in the towns booming tourist industry, waited outside.

 The gunmen, armed with one handgun and knives, first demanded $1,000 dollars and a van, increasing the sum later to $30,000, Lach Savin said.

 After $30,000 was tossed through the window, the gunmen still demanded grenades and other weapons, so negotiators agreed to give them a van, which was driven into the compound by a military policeman, Lach Savin said.

 When the gunmen herded some children into the van, military police jumped them and the one driving the van was wounded, he said.

 Ignazio Di Palma, Italys ambassador to neighbouring Thailand, said a 3-year-old Italian boy was rescued by his father during the melee.

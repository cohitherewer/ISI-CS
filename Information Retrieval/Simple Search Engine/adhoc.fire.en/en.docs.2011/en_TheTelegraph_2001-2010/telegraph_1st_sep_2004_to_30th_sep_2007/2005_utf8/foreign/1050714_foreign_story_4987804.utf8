 Family men, all three

 AMIT ROY

 London, July 13: An anguished British establishment is trying to understand why the four bombers of 7/7 did what they did. 

 Prime Minister Tony Blair today told a hushed House of Commons of his shock when he learnt that the bombers were from Britain.

 From all accounts, the young men did not fit the terrorist stereotype.

 Take, for example, Hasib Hussain. The 19-year-old lived with his parents in a three-storey red-bricked terrace house in Colenso Mount in the Leeds suburb of Holbeck. 

 On Wednesday, he told his parents he was going to London for the day with friends. At 10.20 pm on Thursday, his parents reported him missing to the police casualty bureau, providing one of the vital clues which led detectives to Leeds. What his parents did not know was that at 9.47 am that morning, he had blown himself up on the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square, causing 13 deaths. His driving licence and cash cards were found in the mangled wreckage.

 Hasib attended Matthew Murray High School in Leeds and apparently became very religious two years ago. 

 The story of Shehzad Tanweer, 22, is not so different. He grew up in the Beeston area of Leeds with his younger brother and two sisters in the familys semi-detached house. 

 Shehzad went to Wortley High School before moving on to Leeds Metropolitan University where he studied sports science. He loved cricket. He and his friend Mohammed Anwar, 19, played together just over a week ago. 

 Its not in his nature to do something like this, hes the type of guy who would condemn things like that, Anwar said. 

 The third bomber, Mohammed Sadique Khan, 30, leaves behind wife Hasina and their baby girl, eight months old.

 Neighbours said he worked with disabled children while his wife was involved in education.

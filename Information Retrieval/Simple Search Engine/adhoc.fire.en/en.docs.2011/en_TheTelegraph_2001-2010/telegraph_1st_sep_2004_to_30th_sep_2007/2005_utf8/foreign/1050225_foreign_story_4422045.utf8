 Pope rushed to hospital again

 Pope John Paul

 Vatican City, Feb. 24 (Reuters): Pope John Paul was rushed to hospital today for the second time this month after suffering a relapse of his earlier flu, the Vatican said.

 A church source said the Polish Pontiff, 84, had a fever and a renewed breathing crisis two weeks after doctors had allowed him to go home following a 10-day stay at Rome?s Gemelli hospital.

 A security guard said the Pope was conscious and resting on a partly raised stretcher as he was wheeled into the Gemelli at 0945 GMT. A passer-by told Sky Italia television that he had waved to people as he entered the clinic. ?Yesterday afternoon, Wednesday February 23, the Holy Father had a relapse of the flu symptoms which he had already suffered in previous weeks,? a Vatican statement said.

 ?For this reason, the Pope was taken this morning to the Agostino Gemelli hospital for the opportune specialist care and further checks,? it added.

 The Vatican said it would issue its next health bulletin late tomorrow morning.

 Vatican sources said the Pope had hoped until the last minute to attend a ceremony today to approve sainthood decrees, which took place in the frescoed Clementia Hall metres from his private study in the Apostolic Palace.

 Cardinals and bishops were gathered in the hall awaiting his arrival, but worried by his condition, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, decided to preside in his place.

 Minutes later, the Pope?s health worsened and doctors ordered his immediate transfer by ambulance to the Gemelli, some 4 km from the Vatican. Senior churchmen urged Roman Catholic faithful to pray for the man who has led the 1.1-billion member Church for 26 years.

 ?In the warmest of ways, I call on all the diocese of Rome to gather in prayer for our most loved bishop and the father of the faith,? said Camillo Ruini, the Cardinal of Rome. 

 The deterioration of the Pope?s health will revive fears throughout Catholic world that one of the most historic pontificates is nearing an end.

 ?He had the same symptoms as last time, including fever and some breathing difficulties,? the Church source said.

 It was the 10th time that John Paul has had to be treated at the Gemelli since becoming Pope in October, 1978.

 ?I?m so sorry he?s back. It?s a bad sign,? said Silvana Monti, who was visiting a friend at the Gemelli on a blustery, chill winter?s day.

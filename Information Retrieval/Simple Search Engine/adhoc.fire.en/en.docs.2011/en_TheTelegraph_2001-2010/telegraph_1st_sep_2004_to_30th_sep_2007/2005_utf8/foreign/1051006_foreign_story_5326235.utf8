 Nobel molecule dance

 Stockholm, Oct. 5 (Reuters): Frenchman Yves Chauvin and Americans Robert Grubbs and Richard Schrock won the 2005 Nobel Chemistry prize for showing how to tailor-make molecules for cheaper, cleaner chemicals and drugs to combat major diseases.

 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded them the 10 million crown ($1.3 million) prize for work in metathesis, where molecules dance round and change partners to create new molecules.

 In an unusual step, two men and two women from the committee then took to the floor of the wood-panelled academy hall and danced quietly from partner to partner to give a simple illustration of the trios complex work.

 Their research into metathesis laid the groundwork for the production of new drugs to treat illnesses like Alzheimers, Downs Syndrome, HIV/AIDS and cancer.

 Imagination will soon be the only limit to what molecules can be built, said the Academy citation, calling metathesis an example of how important basic science has been applied for the benefit of man, society and the environment.

 Describing the prize as very meaningful, Schrock said he might buy a bottle of wine to celebrate, a bottle thats been too expensive until now.

 We have shown how to make catalysts for this reaction, now organic chemists can use this reaction for many things, for example for making drugs, he said by telephone from his home in Massachusetts in the US.

 Grubbs, who was lecturing in New Zealand, said the news was still sinking in. Ill probably have a couple of drinks and try to get some sleep.

 Metathesis, which means changing places, refers to the reorganisation of groups of atoms of carbon which form the building blocks of all organic life on earth.

 Chauvin, who is 74 and works at the French Petroleum Institute, provided the recipe for this in 1971.

 Schrock, who is 60, and Grubbs, who is 63, developed effective and more stable catalysts to reproduce the reaction.

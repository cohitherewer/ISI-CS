 Venezuela jet crash kills 160

 Caracas, Aug. 16 (Reuters): A Colombian jet travelling from Panama to Martinique crashed in Venezuela today after its engines failed, killing all 160 passengers and crew in one of the countrys worst air disasters, officials said.

 The West Caribbean Airways MD-82 aircraft was en route to the French Caribbean island when it began to have engine trouble and attempted to divert to an airport in Venezuela. It crashed at a cattle farm near Venezuelas border with Colombia.

 Most of the passengers were local government officials in Martinique who had been on holiday with their families.

 Pope in no-condom stand

 Vatican City, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Pope John Paul today stressed that the Roman Catholic Church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage, and not condoms, were the best way to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.

 The Pope?s words, spoken to a new ambassador to the Vatican, took on an added significance being his first direct comment on the controversial topic since a Catholic official in Spain this week appeared to question the church?s stand against condoms.

 ?The Holy See... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality, that is chastity and faithfulness, is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly,? the 84-year old Pontiff said in a written address.

 The church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception. It says promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of AIDS fosters what it sees as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behaviour that will only contribute to its spread.

 The condom debate made the front pages of newspapers around the world this week after Father Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, secretary-general of the Spanish bishops conference, said they could have ?a place in the global approach to tackling AIDS?.

 The next day, the conference retracted his statement saying there had not been any change in the church?s position on the use of condoms.

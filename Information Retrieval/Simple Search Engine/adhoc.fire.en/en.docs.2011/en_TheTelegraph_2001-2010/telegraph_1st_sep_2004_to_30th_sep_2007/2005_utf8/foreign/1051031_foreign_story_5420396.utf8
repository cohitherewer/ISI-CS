 Fischer ties fifth knot in Rome

 Fischer: New leaf

 Rome, Oct. 30 (AP): Outgoing German foreign minister Joschka Fischer has married for the fifth time, wedding his companion Minu Barati in a civil ceremony at Romes City Hall, a newspaper reported today.

 Rome mayor Walter Veltroni performed the brief ceremony yesterday that was attended by about 20 people, including the brides daughter from a previous relationship, Rome daily La Repubblica said.

 Were friends; they like Italy and Rome, Veltroni was quoted as saying. The daily quoted Fishcher as saying: Its a completely private fact.

 Mozarts eine kleine nachtmusik accompanied the couple into the City Hall room where they were married, and Vivaldis primavera closed the ceremony, Repubblica reported. Veltroni gave the bride a bouquet of pink and yellow orchids.

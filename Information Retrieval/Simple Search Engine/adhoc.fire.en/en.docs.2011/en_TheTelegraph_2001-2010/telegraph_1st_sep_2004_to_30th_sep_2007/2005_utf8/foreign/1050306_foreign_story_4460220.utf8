 Chanel?s pompous display

 Paris, March 5 (Reuters): In the latest advertisement for Chanel No 5 perfume starring Nicole Kidman, the French label?s name and iconic ?double-C? logo beam out from billboards and skyscrapers across a darkened metropolis.

 The image could be a metaphor for the luxury goods industry, where the superbrand looms large almost a century after it was founded by Gabrielle ?Coco? Chanel.

 Everything about Chanel is bombastic, from its new flagship store in Tokyo ? where the 10-storey facade doubles as a giant television screen ? to its catwalk show yesterday, the largest of Paris fashion week with 3,000 guests.

 German designer Karl Lagerfeld presented a dizzying array of outfits for next winter, with every conceivable variation on house trademarks such as tweed suits, quilted leather handbags and little black dresses festooned with camellias.

 Among the crowd decked out in tweed and pearls was German actress Diane Kruger, who frequently wears Chanel for red-carpet premieres such as last year?s Cannes film festival. ?It?s elegance, timeless, very feminine and to me very youthful in a way. When you see all those great women that have worn Chanel, it?s sort of a nice feeling to wear an antique Chanel gown,? the Troy star said.

 Models with thickly painted fake lashes ? reminiscent of 1960s supermodel Twiggy ? stepped out in quick succession on the silver catwalk, wearing knobbly wool separates paired with ribbed legwarmers and snug beanie hats.

 Sheepskin jackets came tufted with seams of cream or black tweed, in a twist on last year?s best-selling trenchcoat. Little black sun dresses featured crisp white piping, while pleated black schoolgirl dresses had demure white collars and cuffs.

 Rising Belgian model Elise Crombez stood out in a tuxedo jacket worn over black knickerbockers.

 If that sounds too much like a costume, Lagerfeld offered an eminently modern alternative in the shape of a plain long-sleeved cream blouse split in the back and tied over a frothy black lace skirt and mean black boots.

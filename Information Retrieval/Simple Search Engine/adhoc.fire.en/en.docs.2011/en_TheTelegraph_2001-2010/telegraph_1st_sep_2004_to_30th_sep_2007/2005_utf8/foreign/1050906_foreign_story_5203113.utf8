 Iraq town in Zarqawi hands

 ELLEN KNICKMEYER

 Zarqawi: Back in business

 Baghdad, Sept. 5: Abu Musab Zarqawis foreign-led al Qaida in Iraq took open control of a key western town at the Syrian border, deploying its guerrilla fighters in the streets and flying Zarqawis black banner from rooftops, witnesses, residents and others in the city and surrounding villages said.

 A sign newly posted at the entrance of Qaim declared: Welcome to the Islamic Kingdom of Qaim. A statement posted in mosques described Qaim as an Islamic kingdom liberated from the occupation.

 Zarqawis fighters were killing officials and civilians seen as government-allied or anti-Islamic, witnesses, residents and others said. Yesterday, the bullet-riddled body of a woman lay in a street of Qaim. A sign left on her corpse declared: A prostitute who was punished.

 There was no immediate comment from the US or Iraqi military. A US military spokesman in Baghdad, Lieutenant Colonel Steven Boylan, said he was looking into the reports.

 Qaim, within a few miles of the Syrian border, has been a major stronghold for insurgents ferrying fighters, weapons and money from Syria into the rest of Iraq along a network of Euphrates river towns.

 Many of the towns along the river have appeared to be heavily under the insurgents domination, despite repeated Marine offences along the river since May. Residents and Marines have described insurgents escaping ahead of the offensives, and returning when the offensives are over.

 While the stepped-up US offensives have been unable to drive out insurgents permanently, the US attacks are credited by some with helping disrupt insurgent networks and reduce the number of car-bombings and suicide attacks in the rest of Iraq.

 US Marines last week launched days of air strikes against suspected insurgent safe houses in the area, in some of the heaviest known uses of air power in recent months. A Sunni Arab tribe, the Albu Mahal tribe, simultaneously vowed to drive Zarqawis fighters from the area, with the aid of the US air strikes.

 US and Iraqi officials welcomed what they called signs that insurgents were losing support from their Sunni Arab base in the west.

 By the weekend, however, Zarqawis forces had fought back and taken control of Qaim, residents said. Accounts from the town described a rare, prolonged overt presence of the foreign fighters.

 The Albu Mahal tribe as of yesterday remained in control of its village outside the city. However, a car bomb placed by Zarqawis fighters in front of the home of a tribal leader, Sheikh Dhyad Ahmed, killed the sheikh and his son yesterday, resident Mijbil Saied said.

 It was unclear whether any Iraqi forces were in Qaim. A Zarqawi fighter said any Marines and Iraqi forces had left Qaim, with nothing left of their crosses.

 Armed insurgent fighters loyal to the Jordanian-born Zarqawi openly travelled Qaims streets. The fighters included both Iraqis and foreigners, including Afghans.

 The foreign-led fighters hung rooftops with Zarqawis al Qaida banner of black backgrounds with a yellow sun. Shops selling CDs, a movie theatre and a womens beauty parlour were burned.

 Black Xmas trees are hot this year

 FRANCES BOOTH

 London, Nov. 5: Among the style-conscious, it seems, bets on a white Christmas are off. The colour on everyones lips this year is black ? not for the party dress but for the tree.

 A full 50 days before Christmas, sales of artificial black trees suggest that the familiar green needles may have had their day. Susan Rose, the editor of Ideal Home, said: Black and white has been a strong interiors trend for a couple of years now. If you want to do an elegant, sophisticated Christmas, black is the way to do it.

 Its a look that fits with all our pale and minimal homes where traditional reds, golds and greens are going to stick out like a sore thumb. Sales figures from John Lewis department stores show that artificial black trees ? 6 feet tall, pre-lit with 400 white lights, for ?90 ? are outselling ice white, gold and green trees. 

 Christine Kasoulis, a buyer at John Lewis, said that normally 10 per cent of tree sales would be made in October, 40 per cent in November, and 50 per cent in December. However, 25 per cent of its black trees stock had been sold.

 The shopping website iwantoneofthose.com has also seen healthy sales of black artificial trees. Black and pink are this years colours when it comes to retro cool fake trees, says the website.

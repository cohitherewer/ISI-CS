 Rural US convulsed by ?meth? addiction

 Washington, Jan. 28 (Reuters): Imagine that, with $100 worth of supplies bought from neighbourhood stores, dealers could easily cook up $1,000 worth of a drug so addictive that users quickly descend into a hell of violence, crime and neglect.

 That frightening scenario is the reality of methamphetamine, or meth, a drug that is sweeping rural America, spawning crime, child abuse and toxic pollution and ripping apart communities.

 ?It is out of control. It is a huge problem all across the US,? said Mike Logsdon, unit chief of an intelligence arm of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that collects data on the problem.

 The drug, also known as crank, crystal, speed and ice, can be snorted, injected, smoked or swallowed. Within minutes, the user experiences a rush of energy and sense of well-being that can last up to 12 hours. But when it wears off, it leaves a feeling of deep depression and paranoia which makes the user desperate for another dose.

 The scourge has taken hold in the last five years, and rural areas are bearing the brunt of the problem. Experts say that is primarily because meth is easy and cheap to make. Ingredients include readily accessible rock salt, battery acid, anhydrous ammonia and cold medicines. Recipes can be downloaded from the Internet.

 Wide-open spaces in the country and small towns offer plentiful places to hide the drug activity. ?It?s the first drug in the history of the US we can make, distribute, sell, take, all here in the Midwest,? said detective Jason Grellner, of in Franklin,Missouri, who seized 120 meth labs last year.

 ?You can?t grow a coca plantation or an opium plantation here to get your heroin or cocaine, and marijuana takes four or five months to grow a good plant. With methamphetamine you can go out and for a couple hundred dollars you can make your drugs that day,? Grellner said.

 The problem descended on rural America with shocking suddenness. Police officer Randy Krukow of Clay county in western Iowa said that in 1999 he had detected not a single meth-producing laboratory. By 2001, his force had broken up 56 in a county with a population of only 18,000.

 For the fiscal year ending September 2004, the DEA counted more than 16,800 methamphetamine-related seizures by law enforcement across the country, up from 15,300 in 2002.

 But these small mobile labs only scratch the surface of the problem. According to the DEA, 80 per cent of the methamphetamine sold in the US is produced in so-called ?super labs? in Mexico or California run by organised crime syndicates which cook up vast quantities.

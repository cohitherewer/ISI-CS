 King of US late-night TV dies

 Los Angeles, Jan. 24 (Reuters): Comedian Johnny Carson, the king of US late-night television as host of NBC?s The Tonight Show for nearly 30 years ? and the last face millions of Americans saw before drifting off to sleep ? died yesterday at age 79.

 Carson?s topical opening monologues and on-air banter with sidekick Ed McMahon and bandleader Doc Severinsen made his show a cultural touchstone, and his death saddened many in Hollywood who got their first big break on the programme.

 ?Mr Carson passed away peacefully early yesterday morning? surrounded by family members, nephew Jeff Sotzing said in a statement. He died from emphysema at his Malibu, California, home, NBC said.

 Chirac in hospital for eye trouble

 Jacques Chirac

 Paris, Sept. 3 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac was admitted to hospital for a week with eye trouble following a blood vessel problem, officials said today.

 The 72-year-old French leader was admitted to a Paris military hospital late yesterday and all his appointments for the coming week have been cancelled at his request, a spokeswoman for Chiracs office said. There was no mention of any temporary handover of authority.

 Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said he spoke with Chirac and discussed all major government business. Villepin told reporters in southwest France he believed the eye problems would clear up within a few days.

 He will stay in hospital for a week ... As soon as I get back to Paris late this afternoon, I will visit him at Val de Grace (military hospital), he said.

 Chiracs office said he was suffering from slight eyesight difficulties following a blood vessel problem, but did not give further details.

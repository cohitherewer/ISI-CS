 Islamabad, Oct. 22: The first batch of Nato military engineers will arrive in Pakistan next week to join relief efforts in areas hit by the October 8 earthquake.

 Nato deputy assistant general Maurits Jochems today said in Islamabad that the organisation will deploy a battalion of light engineers comprising 600 personnel to clear roads of rubble and reconstruct the destroyed ones before the winter sets in and to build safer homes for the affected people.

 According to the Pakistani relief commissioner, the quake killed 51,300 people and injured 74,000. The 7.6 magnitude quake and hundreds of after-shocks have displaced over four million people, exposing them to severe cold weather in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges.

 Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has called for more international assistance. He said aid worth $610 million pledged by the world community so far is inadequate, adding that Pakistan needs at least $5 billion for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the quake-hit areas.

 The decision to send Nato troops was taken at the organisations headquarters in Brussels, which decided to enhance its assistance to Pakistan in response to the request by government in Islamabad, Jochems said.

 The setting up of a major strategic airlift operation of relief supplies to Pakistan is unprecedented in Natos history based on humanitarian concerns for the quake-affected people, he added.

 Brigadier General Antonius Strik, chief of the NATO Operational Liaison Team in Pakistan, said about 50 people, including the administrative staff, should be in Pakistan within a week.

 In Brussels, Belgium, Nato secretary-general Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said: This is the first time Nato has done something like this on this scale... Nato is not a humanitarian organisation. It is playing its role within the framework of what it is.

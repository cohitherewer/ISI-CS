 Saddam family was far from reality

 - Doctor 

 saw tyrant at his worst 

 Dr Ali Bashir (top) 

 and Saddam Hussein 

 As a barometer of Saddam Husseins declining grip on reality, we need look no further than the state of his feet. With bombs raining down on Baghdad, his people poisoned by the water supply, his enemies being routinely tortured, the dictators main preoccupation was getting relief from the corns under his right foot. 

 More revealing still, he would never have had corns in the first place if he had not, out of sheer vanity, worn shoes that were two sizes too small and much too narrow. 

 Oblivious to impending disaster, his female relatives behaved with just the same petty self-obsession. In the countdown to war in 2003, three of them ? including his 16-year-old granddaughter ? were queuing up, like competitors in a beauty contest, to have plastic surgery to straighten or reduce their noses. 

 No one is better placed than a personal physician to shatter a tyrants self-image with a few well-chosen details, and Dr Ala Bashir, former head of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Baghdad University, is able to expose the full megalomaniac absurdity of Saddam and his family because he saw them, corns and all, at their dysfunctional worst. 

 Dr Bashir was at the mercy of the Hussein clans trivial summonses for 20 years, often having to abandon more serious cases to attend to them. He was forced to operate repeatedly on Saddams psychotic aunt (Happiness for her was a general anaesthetic), even though her ailments were entirely imaginary ? this was a woman, after all, who had executed two servants she suspected of stealing. We quite simply dared not stop the nonsense and say enough was enough, he admits. 

 Bashir pieced together Saddams psychopathic eldest son, Uday, after a failed assassination attempt in 1996 left him disabled and brain-damaged. It was more difficult to gauge the extent of any damage to the brain, he notes dryly. He was already insane. At some risk to his own life (since Saddam demanded to be informed of any medical procedure on a member of his family), he performed a secret facelift on Samira Shabandar, the mistress who was to become the Presidents second wife, and passed it off as the removal of a small growth from behind her ear. This must have been demeaning for a man who treated the victims of atrocity and rose to prominence as a plastic surgeon during the Iran-Iraq war, when he and his team performed more than 22,000 operations on wounded soldiers from both sides. 

 When Saddam was involved in a car crash in 1991, Bashir recalls that the lacerated dictator refused to have his face bandaged because it would have made him look weak on television, but for weeks afterwards he was obsessed by an injury to his little finger. The man who terrorised and tortured his subjects for decades could not bear the slightest physical discomfort or impairment. He even tried to hide the fact that he dyed his moustache. 

 I am not violating the oath of my profession by telling these trivial stories, says Bashir. I just wanted to show that this family was divorced from reality. These small operations are related to important events in the history of Iraq.

 The provider of so many far from trivial insights into the psyche of Saddam Hussein is a conspicuously tall, bird-like man with a beakish nose, mahogany skin and long wispy white hair floating either side of his bald head. The backs of his delicate hands bristle with black hair. His manner is courteous but also infuriatingly oblique, as if he is on a higher mission than answering questions. 

 Ala Bashir, formerly Iraqs most highly decorated doctor, left his country three months after the outbreak of war and, from the safe suburb of Nottingham where he now lives with his wife and daughter, he has written a book called The Insider. Based on diaries he kept clandestinely and gave to friends in plain envelopes for safe-keeping, it is a stomach-churning chronicle of brutality, corruption, casual violence and intrigue ? as well as endless nose jobs. 

 Bashir extols his memoir as a salutary study of the corrosiveness of absolute power, rather than the story of a single despot.

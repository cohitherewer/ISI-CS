 Lanka army opens fire in Tamil belt

 Jaffna, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Sri Lankan troops and protesters clashed in the minority Tamil-dominated Jaffna peninsula today, with one person shot and wounded and each side accusing the other of trying to provoke further violence.

 The army said it had fired into the air after protesters incited by Tamil Tiger rebels hurled stones at checkpoints. Protesters said troops attacked a peaceful demonstration against army brutality and beat up lecturers and students.

 They shot at us, University of Jaffna management student Senthil Ratneswaran said in an overcrowded local hospital, a suspected bullet fragment still in his back. Some fell onto the road to save themselves and they were kicked. They are trying to... instigate the LTTE to move towards war.

 Hospital staff said it was the worst incident of its kind since a 2002 ceasefire halted two decades of conflict between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). One had been confirmed shot and wounded and 14 others were injured.

 The injured included senior university staff who said they had been beaten with sticks and rifle butts. The army said it had no details on anyone being shot, but that if troops had fired into the crowd, casualties would have been much higher.

 Earlier this month, a claymore fragmentation mine attack blamed on the rebels killed 14 soldiers in Jaffna, a city cut off from the rest of Sri Lanka by the de facto state the rebels control and which the Tigers want the army out of.

 On streets bearing the scars of past bombs and shells, soldiers stood with assault rifles and sticks, some obscuring their faces with black bandannas. The army said the student demonstration had been aimed at provoking an army over-reaction.

 It is obviously incited by the LTTE, army spokesman Brigadier Nalim Witharanage said. There are people behind the scenes who are trying to provoke the army.

 The rebels on Saturday rejected an offer from Japan to host peace talks with the government, saying they wanted only to go to peace broker Norway. Diplomats said a meeting of the European Union, Japan, the US and Norway in Brussels today was likely to result in a strong statement against the Tigers.

 Diplomats say the international community does not believe repeated rebel denials that they have been involved in recent attacks, including the assassination of the foreign minister in August, and is also angry at a November presidential election boycott.

 Over 1,000 people marched through Colombo, demanding the EU follow Britain and the US and officially list the Tigers as a terrorist outfit.

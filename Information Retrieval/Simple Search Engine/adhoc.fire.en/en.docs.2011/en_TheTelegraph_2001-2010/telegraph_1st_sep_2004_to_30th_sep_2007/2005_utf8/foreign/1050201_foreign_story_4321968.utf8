 Peres caught ?concentrating? in cabinet

 Shimon Peres: Deep thought?

 Jerusalem, Jan. 31 (AFP): Israel?s usually indefatigable deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres dozed off for a full 15 minutes during the weekly cabinet meeting, some of his less than discreet colleagues said today.

 ?His eyes were well and truly closed and he went to sleep for a quarter of an hour,? one minister told the Yediot Aharonot daily on condition of anonymity.

 The 81-year-old Nobel laureate, who joined a new Israeli coalition government earlier this month, had only just returned to Jerusalem from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for yesterday?s meeting.

 Even though colleagues banged their glasses on the table and spoke in raised tones, all attempts to rouse him failed, the paper said.

 Peres? office, however, denied that the Centre-Left Labour Party?s leader had drifted off, saying in a statement that ?it is well known that Mr Peres closes his eyes in order to concentrate and that?s all that happened.? 

 Peres urged all 25 EU members to establish business? in the West Bank or Gaza to spur the Palestinian economy and give the Palestinian people the hope of a better life. 

 Peres said political and security progress must be backed with action in the economic sphere.

 ?In the eyes of the people, it will be their economic situation that will decide their moods and minds more than anything else,? he told a small group of reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum. ?What worries me is the contradiction between the immediacy of the problems and the delay of the solutions.?

 ?So we would like to accelerate the solutions, and that can be done with the help of the europeans,? peres said.

 To start building a palestinian economy, he said, the eu would be ?very wise to help to build industrial centres in gaza and the west bank.?

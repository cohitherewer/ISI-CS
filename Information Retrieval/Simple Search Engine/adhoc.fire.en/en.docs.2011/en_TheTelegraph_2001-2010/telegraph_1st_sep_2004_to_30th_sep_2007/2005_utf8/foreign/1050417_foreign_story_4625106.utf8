 Keys inspires school students

 DEBBI WILGOREN

 Alicia Keys

 Washington, April 16: Rhythm and blues mega-star Alicia Keys strode into the cinder-block classroom at R.H. Terrell Junior High School in northwest Washington wearing tight jeans, an off-the-shoulder sweatshirt and a baseball cap pulled low over her eyes.

 Twenty-three students in neat khaki-and-white uniforms shrieked as they recognised the nine-time Grammy Award winner, looking smaller but just as dynamic as she does in her music videos. Tamika Walker, 15, grabbed her friend?s arm and squeezed. 

 Within minutes, Keys was perched on the corner of Tamikas desk, helping her craft a one-sentence plan for making the honour roll, ?by completing all my homework and classwork every day.?

 ?You want specific, specific goals,? said Keys, 24, in a soft, smokey voice that Tamika had to lean close to hear.

 She urged the group of eighth-graders at the school to keep working toward their dreams and not to be dissuaded by those who don?t have faith in them.

 ?A lot of times, there?s people around you, and they tell you what they think you should do, what they think is good for you, what they think you should be,? Keys said. ?When anybody says ?can?t? to you ? they don?t know you. They can?t know you. So prove them wrong.?

 Keys, raised by a single mother in a tough New York neighbourhood, conducts the workshops with her road manager, DJ Walton, 26, as part of Frum Tha Ground Up, a nonprofit organisation Walton founded three years ago to encourage young people to live productive lives. 

 They choose a group of students to meet with in each city where Keys performs. The youngsters don?t know they are meeting the singer until she walks in.

 Keys and Walton said they try to connect personally with as many of the students as possible ? placing an encouraging hand on the shoulder of the Terrell student who kept his eyes down and shoulders slumped, or complimenting the shy girl who summoned the courage to read aloud the goal she wrote on her worksheet. 

 At one point, after the TV crews were ushered out of the room, Keys said about her struggles to chart her own path as a teenager. When she was playing with her first band, a man working with the group said she would never make it unless she approached the music his way, she said.

 Ralpheal Smith, 15, said later that the story reminded him of the times fellow students have made fun of him when they saw him working on homework. One girl questioned why he was doing the work, he recalled, saying he would never make good grades. Listening to Keys ?really made you understand that some people will try to bring you down,? Ralpheal said.

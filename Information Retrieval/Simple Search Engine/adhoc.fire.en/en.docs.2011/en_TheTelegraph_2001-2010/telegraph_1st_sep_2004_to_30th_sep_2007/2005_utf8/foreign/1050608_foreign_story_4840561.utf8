 No human clones

 Seoul, June 7 (Reuters): There will be no human clones this century because the work is dangerous, complicated and unethical, the South Korea scientist at the forefront of stem cell research and cloning technology said today.

 I dont think we will have any chance to meet a cloned human being within the next 100 years, at least, said Woo-Suk Hwang, the head of a team of South Korean scientists who cloned the first human embryo to use for research. 

 Speaking at a panel discussion, Hwang denounced human cloning as foolish and unsafe science.

 Cloning a human being is nonsense. Briefly, it is not ethical, it is not safe at all, and its technically impossible, Hwang said.

 Hwang made news around the world last month for a breakthrough that fulfils one of the basic promises of using cloning technology in stem cell research ? that a piece of skin could be taken from a patient and used to grow stem cells.

 Researchers believe the stem cells could be trained to provide tailored tissue and organ transplants to cure juvenile diabetes, Parkinsons disease and even to repair severed spinal cords. 

 Hwang has said his work does not involve human cloning, but using eggs harvested from human females to create cells that can never become an actual human being.

 Last month, President George W. Bush expressed concern about Hwangs research and threatened to veto legislation that would loosen restrictions on US government funding of embryonic stem cell research. 

 In response, Hwang said last month that while he had respect for Bushs views for their theological and political values, he also said they represented a peculiar policy that hampered US research.

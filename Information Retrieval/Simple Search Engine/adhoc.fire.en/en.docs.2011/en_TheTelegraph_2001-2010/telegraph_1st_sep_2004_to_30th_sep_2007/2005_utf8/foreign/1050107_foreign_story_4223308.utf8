 Bush donates $10,000

 Collinsville (Illinois), Jan. 6 (Reuters): President George W. Bush, who called on Americans this week to make a donation to help victims of the Asian tsunami, has contributed $10,000 himself, the White House said yesterday.

 Bush, whose wealth is estimated at some $13 million, on Monday asked ?every American to contribute as they are able to do so.?

 The President?s personal donation comes two days after he enlisted former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to lead an appeal for assistance. ?The President has sent contributions totalling $10,000 to some of the international relief organisation who are working in the region,? a spokesman said.

 Boss as bishop

 Rome, May 16 (Reuters): Its no wonder Bernardo Provenzano, the Sicilian Mafias boss of bosses, has eluded capture for more than four decades.

 According to a Mafia godmother-turned-supergrass, the 72-year-old mobster turned up to a summit of Cosa Nostra leaders in 1992 disguised in a bishops purple vestments.

 At first I didnt recognise him. It seemed strange that someone would show up at a meeting dressed as a bishop, Giuseppina Vitale told a court yesterday, according to Ansa news agency. He was even wearing a violet hat.

 Provenzano has been on the run for 42 years. The most recent photograph police have of him was taken nearly three decades ago.

 Song spoof

 London (Reuters): British soldiers serving 

 in Iraq crashed defence ministry computers in London last 

 week after officials downloaded a spoof video the troops 

 had made of a chart-topping song. The soldiers four-minute 

 video take of the 1971 hit Is This The Way To Amarillo 

 had officers laughing out loud back at London headquarters 

 as they e-mailed copies to each other. But computers could 

 not cope with the demand and the e-mail server was paralysed 

 for several hours on Friday, May 13, he said. 

 The video was a good way of maintaining morale on 

 operations. The fact that it proved so popular was unfortunate, 

 but the system failure did not affect operational capabilities, 

 he added. The original song was re-released earlier this 

 year with British comic Peter Kay miming to Tony Christies 

 original. The soldiers version was entitled: Is 

 This The Way To Armadillo? In the spoof video, a soldier 

 looking like Kay marches through a British base in Iraq 

 calling on fellow troopers to join him, including two dressed 

 only in underwear, webbing and rifles.

 Top Heaven

 London (Reuters): Hollywood Crusades epic Kingdom Of Heaven stayed at the top of the British box office for the second week running, Screen International said on Tuesday. In second place was new entry Monster-In-Law, a romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda. The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, which follows Englishman Arthur Dent on his space travels, was at number three. Nicole Kidmans The Interpreter, directed by Sydney Pollack, gained one place to four. At five was Lee Tamahoris action thriller xXx: The Next Level.

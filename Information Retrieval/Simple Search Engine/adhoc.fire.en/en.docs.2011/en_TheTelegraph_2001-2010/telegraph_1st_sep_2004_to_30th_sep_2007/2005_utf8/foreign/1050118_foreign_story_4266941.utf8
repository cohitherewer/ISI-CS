 Fine Print

 Blanket blow

 Manila, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Filipinos who walk in the street or cross the road illegally will no longer get a slap on the wrist. Instead, they risk a smack with a wet blanket.

 ?We?ve tried talking to pedestrians, asking them to walk on the sidewalks, but it wasn?t effective,? said Richard Apodarado, a traffic enforcement commander in Manila, the congested capital of 12 million people and seemingly as many vehicles.

 Under the new campaign, about 20 trucks patrol the city with wooden poles attached to damp blankets emblazoned with the warning: ?No walking or standing in the streets?. People who don?t step back onto the kerb are in for a rude shock.

 In the past, offenders who blocked 

 the road while waiting for public transport were fined or 

 jailed. ?We lack respect for the government and government 

 does not have moral authority like it does in other Asian 

 nations,? said a professor at the University of the Philippines. 

 But not everyone is happy with how the soggy clampdown is being carried out. ?It seems that they don?t know what they?re doing,? said street vendor Bobot Flores.

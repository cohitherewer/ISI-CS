 Holiday row hots up in France

 Jean-Pierre Raffarin: Monday test

 Paris, May 15 (Reuters): Millions of French workers are expected to stay at home tomorrow, ignoring a government decision to scrap the traditional Pentecost public holiday to generate funds to improve healthcare for the elderly.

 Mass defiance of the government will deal a new blow to the authority of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and President Jacques Chirac, two weeks before a referendum on the European Union constitution which polls show the government could lose.

 The row over the holiday has served as a lightning rod for opposition to the constitution. The latest opinion poll by the Ifop research group showed the charters opponents are again ahead of its backers, by a margin of 54 per cent to 46 per cent.

 The great day of solidarity foreseen for Monday, May 16 has become a social and political imbroglio (mess), Le Monde newspaper said in an editorial in its Sunday edition.

 Frances cash-strapped government hopes taxes on tomorrows production will generate an extra 2 billion euros ($2.57 billion) to be spent on healthcare for the aged.

 In 2003, the government was criticised for being unprepared and not acting fast enough to save lives when an August heatwave killed 15,000 people, most of them elderly.

 By dumping what was one of 11 public holidays, Raffarin had hoped to avoid raising taxes on individuals, but now faces a backlash over what unions call a day of free work.

 An Ifop poll published today showed 55 per cent of employees plan not to work tomorrow. Another poll last week found two-thirds oppose the governments decision.

 Ifop found 28 per cent of respondents plan to take the day off, while 13 per cent cannot work because their company is not working. Fourteen per cent have decided to strike for the day. 

 Government spokesperson Jean-Francois Cope said it was normal that people giving up a days holiday did so with some gnashing of teeth but that it was better than raising taxes.

 Those who do show up for work could face chaos because the SNCF rail network has given many of its workers the day off. The SNCF, which faced strike threats by unions, has decided its workers will from now on work one minute 52 seconds longer each day to make up for the lost labour.

 It hopes to run a normal service tomorrow by offering those who work a holiday rate, but many people fear chaos as they return from a long holiday weekend. Other rail companies faces strikes and taxi drivers are charging the higher holiday rate.

 The five main energy unions have called a strike although ordinary consumers are not expected to face power cuts. Some parents plan to keep their children at home because although schools will be open, some canteens may not be.

 The controversy comes at an awkward time for the government before the May 29 referendum on the EU constitution, which is intended to make the 25-nation bloc work more smoothly.

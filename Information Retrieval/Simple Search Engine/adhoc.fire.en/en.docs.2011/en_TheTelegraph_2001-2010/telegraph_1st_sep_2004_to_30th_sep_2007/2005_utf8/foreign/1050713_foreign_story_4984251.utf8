 Finance firm sues Jackson

 Michael Jackson

 New York, July 12 (Reuters): A financial firm has sued Michael Jackson for $48 million in fees it says the singer owes for help in refinancing bank debts and claiming a larger stake in a library of Beatles songs.

 Prescient Acquisition Group, also know as Prescient Capital Corp., filed the lawsuit against Jackson in the US district court in Manhattan late on Monday. Lawyers for Jackson were not immediately available for comment.

 The suit said Prescient was employed in November, 2004, by Jacksons MJ Publishing Trust to help him secure refinancing of $537.5 million through another company.

 At the time, Jackson was facing trial on child sex-abuse charges. He was acquitted by a California jury in June.

 The money allowed Jackson to pay off $272.5 million in bank debt and buy the other half of The Beatles library of songs he did not already own, the lawsuit said.

 Prescient said Jackson and MJ Publishing Trust broke a deal which promised the firm fees worth 9 per cent of any completed financing.

 Prescient accused Jackson of breach of contract, saying that it had done what was expected in a written agreement and that Jackson and his company were not entitled to retain the benefits of those services in equity and good conscience without paying to Prescient an amount to be determined at trial. 

 A lawyer for Jackson did not immediately return a message for comment.

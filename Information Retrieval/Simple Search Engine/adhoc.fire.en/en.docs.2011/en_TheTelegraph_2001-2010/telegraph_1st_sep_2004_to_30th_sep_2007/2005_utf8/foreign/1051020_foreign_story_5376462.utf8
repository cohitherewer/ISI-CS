 Kathmandu, Oct. 19: As the Nepal government began preparing for Februarys municipal elections, the seven-party Opposition alliance formed a high-level committee to start talks with the Maoist rebels.

 Alliance sources told The Telegraph that a two-member committee headed by Nepali Congress supremo and former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala would soon begin talks with Maoist supremo Prachanda and ideologue Baburam Bhattarai, both of whom are currently underground. 

 The other member of the committee is United Marxist Leninist (UML) general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal.

 The sources said that top alliance leaders met here this morning at the office of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party and decided to speed up the dialogue process with the rebels. 

 The meeting decided to go ahead with the dialogue despite threats from the government, the sources added. 

 Soon after meeting, the alliance released a statement announcing its plans to boycott the municipal elections totally.

 The municipal elections are a conspiracy to prolong the autocratic rule of the monarch, the statement said, adding that all talk about parliamentary polls are meaningless.

 The alliance called upon the people to defeat all conspiracies hatched by the incumbent regime and hoped that they would rally around the political parties which are fighting for restoration of democracy.

 The alliance also condemned the recently promulgated media ordinance and expressed solidarity with journalists and other professional organisations in their protests against the stringent laws. It said the seven parties would resume their protest programmes after the Tihar festival.

 The meeting was attended by Koirala, Madhav Kumar Nepal, Amik Serchan of Janamorcha Nepal, Narayan Man Bijukchhe of Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, Hridesh Tripathi of Nepal Sadbhavana Party (Anandi Devi) and Krishna Das Shrestha of the United Left Front Nepal.

 The Election Commission has urged political parties to register within 30 days if they intend to participate in the municipal elections, which will be held on February 8, 2006.

 Addressing a media gathering, Chief Election Commissioner Keshav Raj Rajbhandari said that an official notification would be made public in tomorrows gazette.

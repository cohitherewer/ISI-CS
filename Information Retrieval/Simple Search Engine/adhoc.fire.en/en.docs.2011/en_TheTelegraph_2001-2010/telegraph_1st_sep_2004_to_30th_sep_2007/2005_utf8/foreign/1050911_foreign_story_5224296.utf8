 Strip club cleans up to bring back spectacle

 New Orleans, Sept. 10 (Reuters): Theres no water for the wash the girl of your choice service and there arent any girls either, but Big Daddys strip club on New Orleans Bourbon Street is getting ready to bring back erotic spectacle to the devastated city.

 Friday night on Bourbon Street, usually a throbbing artery of the party-going French Quarter, was pretty grim this time around in what has become a foul-smelling ghost town partly covered with a swamp of filthy water.

 Police patrol cars and military Humvees made up most of the traffic on the street.

 But Big Daddys general manager, Saint Jones, and a band of helpers defied an evacuation order by arriving to clean up their premises in the historic French Quarter, which escaped largely unscathed from the floods.

 Jones said he would open for business as soon as he could get electricity, water and dancers.

 He was already had electricity from a generator, which was moving a pair of robotic womans legs, in stockings and pink high heels, waving invitingly on the street by the sign for Big Daddys.

 He also had plenty of bottled water. But his former employees had been evacuated, so his main problem was convincing girls to come to a town without services and supposedly off limits to most civilians.

 But Jones, a corpulent man with a strawberry blonde beard wearing a black t-shirt reading: Im smiling because they havent found the bodies yet, foresaw few problems getting strippers.

 It shouldnt be too hard. Everyones going to come back in town and want to work. You know, if youve got 50 dancers in Houston and theyre not making money, theyre going to spread out, he said.

 Judging from the number of military and police vehicles which stopped or slowed passing Big Daddys, theyll have plenty of customers. It didnt seem to occur to the men in uniform to enforce the evacuation order in effect on the city ? they preferred to ask when the strippers would be back.

 One army Humvee, carrying a team of Puerto Rican troops, stopped so that a soldier could pose with his M16 rifle by a life-size picture of a naked blonde while his buddy took a photo. Jones gave them vodka on the rocks in plastic cups, which they enjoyed before hopping back in the Humvee.

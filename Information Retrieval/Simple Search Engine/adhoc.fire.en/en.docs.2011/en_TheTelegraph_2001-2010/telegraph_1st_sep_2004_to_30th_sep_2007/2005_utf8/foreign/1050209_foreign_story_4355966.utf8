 Fine Print

 Balls away

 London, Feb. 8 (Reuters): A Welsh rugby fan cut off his own testicles to celebrate Wales beating England at rugby, the Daily Mirror reported today.

 Geoff Huish, 26, was so convinced England would win Saturday?s match he told fellow drinkers at a social club: ?If Wales win I?ll cut my balls off?, the paper said. Friends at the club in Caerphilly, south Wales, thought he was joking. 

 But after the game Huish went home, severed his testicles with a knife, and walked 200 metres back to the bar with the testicles to show the shocked drinkers what he had done. 

 Pizza run

 London (Reuters): A British army pilot 

 has been disciplined by senior officers for using a tank-busting 

 helicopter to deliver a pizza to his girlfriend. The pilot, 

 based with Britain?s 659 Army Air Corps squadron in Suffolk, 

 eastern England, was on a map-reading training drill when 

 he dropped off the pizza to his girlfriend who was taking 

 part in an exercise 50 km away.

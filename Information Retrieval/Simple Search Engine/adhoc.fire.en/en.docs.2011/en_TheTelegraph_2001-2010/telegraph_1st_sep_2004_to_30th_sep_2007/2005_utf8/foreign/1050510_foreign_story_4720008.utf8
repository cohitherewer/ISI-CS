 Free market comes with censor chains

 - Its 

 like going back to 1989

 Chinas communists take pride in turning established ideas on their head. Their latest success has been in toppling the notion that free markets create free politics.

 China has the highest number of imprisoned journalists in the world ? at least 42 according to the New York-based Committee for the Protection of Journalists. 

 The sharpest reminder of this was the arrest of Zhao Yan, a research assistant for The New York Times, last October. A former farmers rights activist, Zhao was accused of ?revealing state secrets?, a catch-all charge that is being increasingly used against dissidents and which carries a maximum sentence of death. Zhaos plight mirrors Chinas increasing suppression of the local media. ?Its like going back to 1989,? says Qi Zhi Yong, a pro-democracy activist who survived Tiananmen Square that year. 

 Around 30,000 human monitors track Internet usage in China, including that of foreign journalists, business people, diplomatic staff and NGOs, making the country ?more successful than any other? in censoring the web, said a report by Harvard Law Schools Berkman Centre for Internet and Society. 

 Guo Liang, a professor of social development at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences here, says the government is doing this because China, which now has more than 100 million Internet users, is ?reaching the point where web-based information is acquiring a critical mass and bypassing traditional censorship. The government feels it cannot just let this happen?, he says.

 Aiding Beijing in the task are US companies like Cisco, which have developed cutting-edge word recognition and filtering techniques. Individuals identified for ?seditious? online activity are often arrested, as was the case with Zhang Shengqi. The 23-year-old student was arrested for publicly supporting the Catholic Church, which is banned in China. 

 With one in every four Chinese now owning a cellphone, the ministry of public security is rolling out an SMS filtering system developed by a local company, Venus Information Technology. It will monitor politically sensitive areas, like the central Henan province.

 The governments plans to keep censorship in step with new technologies was made clear earlier this year when China Central Television (CCTV) quoted Shao Liqin, an official in the ministry of science and technology, saying that plans were afoot to create a network of 100 satellites capable of monitoring every inch of Chinese territory by 2020. In addition to monitoring environment and urban growth, the network would monitor ?various activities of society?, Shao said.

 But it is the ?old media? that is bearing the brunt of the crackdown. Several leading journalists, such as Chen Min of the China Reform magazine, who criticised the governments civil rights record, have been arrested. The government has barred the press from writing about 50 intellectuals recently denounced in the Liberation Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, for trying to ?estrange the relationship between the party and intellectuals?.

 That the list included relatively soft critics, like rock star Cui Jian and novelist Jin Yong, has spread fear of speaking out in public, says Chu Tian, a journalist once associated with Southern Weekend, a news weekly in southern Guangzhou province whose website was closed in 2003 after it pushed the envelope on issues like homosexuality and workers rights. 

 ?Such self-censorship is probably the worst thing,? says Chu. ?The government has become completely arbitrary in dealing with the press. Now, there is not even a line to toe. A piece might go unnoticed one day but a similar or even milder article may get into trouble the next day. This makes people stay as close to the official position as possible.? Political activists say the tightening of media controls stems from increasing social turmoil. In areas far removed from cities like Beijing and Shanghai, people are increasingly distraught with the rising inequities of market reforms.

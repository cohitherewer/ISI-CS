 Fine Print

 Hudson heat

 London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Hollywood actress Kate Hudson, star of The Skeleton Key, instructed lawyers to begin action today against several publications for printing pictures which she said falsely implied she had an eating disorder.

 Hudson, daughter of actor Goldie Hawn, claims the pictures suggested that she had an eating disorder that was so grave and serious that she was wasting away, her lawyers said.

 The images, and the articles that accompanied them, could also prove damaging to her career as it might raise concern amongst casting agents, London law firm Schillings added.

 The publications included US tabloid The National Enquirer, British magazine Heat and the Daily Mail tabloid.

 Anna?s stalker told: stay 1000 feet away

 Kournikova

 New York, Feb. 25: A homeless man accused of stalking the tennis player Anna Kournikova has been ordered by a judge to stay at least 1,000 feet away from her after he tried to reach her seaside home by swimming naked across a Florida bay.

 William Lepeska, 40, has been detained in a psychiatric hospital awaiting trial on charges of assaulting police officers and burglary.

 He also faces charges of stalking, criminal mischief and indecent exposure, relating to his attempt to swim nude 200 yards across Biscayne Bay to reach the Russian?s home in Miami Beach. Lepeska was arrested when he emerged beside the swimming pool of the wrong house and started shouting: ?Anna, save me!?

 Lepeska told her that he longed for the day when they would be together. He made repeated attempts to discover if Kournikova had read his letters. He appeared dejected when she said she hadn?t. ?I thought Anna possibly had some sincere regard for me,? he said.

 NY lights out for birds

 New York, Sept. 21 (Reuters): The city that never sleeps will darken the lights of the famed Manhattan skyline after midnight to help save migrating birds.

 New York civic leaders yesterday said the lights of buildings above the 40th floor will be turned off after midnight in the fall and spring migration seasons to save birds. 

 Since 1997, more than 4,000 migratory birds have been killed or injured from colliding into skyscrapers, bird experts said.

 New York City is this nexus of ancient migratory flyways, and the parks have become these havens for these birds, but ... the buildings with their light draw birds to them, sort of like moths to a flame, New York city Audubon director E.J. McAdams said at a news conference.

 McAdams was joined by city officials and real estate groups in promoting Lights Out New York. 

 One building group leader said he expected 100 per cent compliance, and another said he expected around 95 per cent of its members to participate.

 Theres no reason why we cant do this little effort to help our environment. Just because the lights are out does not mean that energy will not be flowing in New York City 24 hours a day, Real Estate Board of New York president Steve Spinola said.

 The programme was modelled after others in Chicago and Toronto. For those who would lament the dimming of New Yorks famed skyline, New York officials said it would only occur a few months a year and save energy.

 This is recognising that beyond architectural beauty, natural beauty is something that cant be replaced. Once these bird species go extinct theyre not coming back, parks commissioner Adrian Benepe said.

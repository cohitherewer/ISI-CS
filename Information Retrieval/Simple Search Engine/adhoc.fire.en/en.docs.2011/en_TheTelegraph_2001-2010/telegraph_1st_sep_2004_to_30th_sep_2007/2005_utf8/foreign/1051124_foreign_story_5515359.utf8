 Historian in Holocaust dock

 Vienna, Nov. 23 (Reuters): British historian David Irving, known for his controversial views on World War II, has been charged with denying the Holocaust, a criminal offence in Austria, a state prosecutor said today.

 Irving was arrested on November 11 near the town of Hartberg in the southern province of Styria under a warrant issued in 1989 for violating a clause outlawing Holocaust denial in Austrias law prohibiting the Nazi Party.

 The charge refers to two lectures Irving gave in 1989, in which he denied the existence of gas chambers, said Otto Schneider, a spokesman for the Vienna state prosecutors.

 Irving has two weeks to object to the charge. In Austria, denying the Holocaust can incur a prison sentence of between one and 10 years. On Friday, a court will review Irvings detention and decide whether he must remain in custody, Schneider said.

 Irvings lawyer Elmar Kresbach said his client was reading the charge and would then decide his next move.

 Amazon trip lies in ruins

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Oct. 17: Mountaineer and trekker Raheela Gul, who also enjoyed extreme sports, became the latest casualty of the Margalla Towers apartment complex that crumbled in the devastating earthquake on October 8.

 Gul, 35, was visiting a friend at the complex before the earthquake struck. Guls friend also died in the tragedy. 

 Both were planning to leave for Lahore at 9 am. 

 A Pakistani Norwegian who had a diploma in travel and tourism from the London School of Management, Gul had met Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz on October 5 to discuss her new expedition ? a trek through the Amazon region in Brazil in November. 

 Gul arrived in Islamabad after the Norwegian embassy offered to fund her Amazon expedition. 

 Earlier this year, Gul had crossed the Nara, Thar and Cholistan deserts on foot. Her passion for extreme sports had also taken her to the Baltoro glacier which is the base camp for climbers of K2, Rakaposhi and Nanga Prabat peaks.

 Her family members at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences identified her body. 

 Her brother Mohammad Wasif, who had hoped to see his daring sister alive, tearfully said that he had a feeling Gul would walk out of the Margalla Towers rubble any minute.

 We were confident that she was down there somewhere alive and would be out any moment as her mother is waiting for her in Lahore, Wasif added.

 A Pakistani rescue official said today said that the death toll in Margalla Towers collapse rose to 57 late last night.

 US army medics yesterday were preparing to airlift a 56-bed mobile hospital from Germany to Pakistan within the next few days.

 Wonder wives 

 Mbabane (Swaziland), May 30 (Reuters): The king of impoverished Swaziland has married a 20-year-old virgin, making her the monarchs 10th wife, a senior member of the royal household said today.

 King Mswati, sub-Saharan Africas last absolute monarch, picked Nolichwa Ntentesa as his latest bride at the tiny kingdoms annual Reed Dance ceremony, where thousands of bare-breasted maidens parade before the king.

 After two years of complex wedding preparations, Ntentesa joined the royal household last week in a traditional ceremony where her face was painted with red ochre.

 Mswati, 37, already has nine wives and two fiancees, one of whom was a Miss Teen Swaziland finalist.

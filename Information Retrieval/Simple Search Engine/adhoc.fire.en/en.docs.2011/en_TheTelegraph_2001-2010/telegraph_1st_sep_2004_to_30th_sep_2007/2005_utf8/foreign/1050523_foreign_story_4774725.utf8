 Prince stole my idea, says baker

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 London, May 22: It is a tale of the prince, the baker and the saffron cake that never made it on to supermarket shelves.

 The Prince of Wales was accused yesterday of stealing a Cornish traders idea and launching a food range that has become a multi-million pound enterprise.

 According to one former employee of Tesco, Martyn Hawkins was royally sold down the river by Prince Charles when the baker was on the verge of signing a lucrative new contract with the supermarket chain worth an estimated ?200,000 a year. Last week, Hawkins and Sue Wolstenholme, who handled the marketing negotiations with Tesco, said they had been shocked and disappointed by the way he was treated.

 Hawkins had come up with the idea of providing Tesco with a wholesome, country brand to fill a gap in the supermarkets bread and cake products. He had invested ?20,000 in the project. After 18 months of negotiations, Tesco was poised to take 4,000 saffron cakes a week for its shelves. 

 The supermarket, however, told Hawkins at the eleventh hour that it had decided not to sell his product which had been due to be marketed as Cornish Sunshine Cake. Instead, Tesco announced in 1990 that it was going to sell Prince Charless Highgrove bread. 

 Wolstenholme said yesterday that she first told Prince Charles about her clients intention to market the saffron cake at a lunch in Cornwall attended by 300 guests. 

 Prince Charles was interested in the project and we discussed it, she said. Then, out of the blue, at the eleventh hour, Tescos executive rang me to say they wouldnt be taking Cornish Sunshine because it had decided to take the Highgrove loaf instead.

 It was a difficult situation. I was very surprised that the Prince put one of his own products before Martyns because I thought he was behind the idea of getting Cornish products sold nationally.

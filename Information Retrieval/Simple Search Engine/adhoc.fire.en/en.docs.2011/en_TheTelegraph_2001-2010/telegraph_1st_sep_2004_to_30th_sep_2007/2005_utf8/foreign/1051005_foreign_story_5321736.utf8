 Iran ready for no-strings talks

 Tehran, Oct. 4 (Reuters): Iran said today it was willing to resume unconditional talks with the European Union (EU) over its nuclear programme, which Washington says is a cover to make atomic bombs.

 Talks between the EU and Iran collapsed in August after Tehran restarted uranium conversion, suspended under a November 2004 deal with France, Britain and Germany.

 Iran has no problem with resuming talks. But it will not accept conditional talks under pressure, foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza AsefiAsefi said.

 The EU has said it was up to Iran to suspend conversion again and cooperate fully with the IAEA for talks to resume.

 Washington and the EU are trying to persuade the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency to send Iran to the UN Security Council in November for violating international nuclear obligations. They say Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, but Tehran insists its nuclear programme is dedicated solely to generating electricity.

 Asefi said his country needed to see Europes goodwill, demanding more practical and meaningful steps from the EU.

 Instead of sending mixed signals, the EU should practically show it is interested in talks, he said. Ali Larijani, secretary-general of the Supreme National Security Council, said today Tehran would review its membership of the Non-Proliferation Treaty if its case was reported to the council. 

 Hardline parliamentarian Mehdi Kouchakzadeh said today that talks with the Europeans were a waste of time.

 Iranian officials should not wait for the EUs shallow promises any more, he told the official Irna news agency.

 We should also start uranium enrichment in Natanz and think about ending snap (UN) inspections. Iran has so far refrained from resuming work at its Natanz uranium enrichment facility. 

 Iraq interference

 Iran today shrugged off Saudi accusations that it was interfering in Iraq, insisting it was playing a positive role in its Arab neighbour. Neighbouring countries had a great role in assisting Iraq in the past to solve its problems, Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki said in Kuwait.

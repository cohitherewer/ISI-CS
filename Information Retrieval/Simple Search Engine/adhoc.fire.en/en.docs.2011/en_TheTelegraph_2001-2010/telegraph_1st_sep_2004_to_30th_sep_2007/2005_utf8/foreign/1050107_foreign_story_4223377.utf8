 Emergency extended in Iraq

 Baghdad, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Iraq?s US-backed government said today it was extending emergency powers equivalent to martial law for a further 30 days to try to safeguard the January 30 elections under threat from deadly attacks by insurgents.

 The state of emergency, first imposed in November ahead of a major US assault on the rebel stronghold of Falluja west of Baghdad, would be extended into February, Prime Minister Iyad Allawi?s government said in a statement.

 Emergency powers allow the government to impose curfews, close borders and airports and detain suspects without following normal legal procedures. 

 The emergency applies to all regions of Iraq except the Kurdish north.

 ?Since terrorist gangs continue their activities to prevent the creation of a broad representative government and try to impede peaceful political participation of all Iraqis, we have decided to extend the state of emergency in all areas of Iraq except the region of Kurdistan for 30 days,? Allawi said.

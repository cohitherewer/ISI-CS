 Everest shrinking? China scans

 Mount Everest

 Beijing, Jan. 25 (PTI): China plans a scientific expedition on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau from March this year to re-measure Mount Everest, because of fears it may be shrinking, Chinese Central Television (CCTV) said.

 The investigation, to be carried out jointly by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping from March 20 to June 20, will focus on the damage caused by global warming over the past 30 years which has led to the melting of glaciers, apparently causing Everest to shrink.

 Chinese scientists will map Everest to check estimates that it is a metre shorter than before. They will use global position systems to re-measure the peak which is known as Qomolangma in Chinese. The mountain is currently 8,850 metres tall.

 According to a recent survey, the world?s tallest peak has shrunk by 1.3 meters, the CCTV said. The movement of the earth?s tectonic plates is forcing the Himalayas upwards, causing Everest to grow by a centimetre yearly.

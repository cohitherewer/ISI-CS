 NY subway strike ends

 New York, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Leaders of striking bus and subway workers in New York today agreed to a return to work after talks at which the union and transit authorities undertook to go back to the bargaining table, mediators said.

 Some 34,000 workers in the Transport Workers Union Local 100 walked off the job on Tuesday after contract talks broke down over pay, healthcare and pensions, stranding some seven million passengers who use subways and buses each day.

 Reaction on the streets was unanimous. Im glad that its over. I didnt think Id be able to leave the city to go home to Virginia for Christmas with all the hassles, said fashion stylist Christina Turner.

 City officials have estimated the strike could cost New York some $1 billion in the first three days, hitting retailers and other businesses at the height of the holiday season.

 With the strike on Americas largest mass transit system in its third day, mediator Richard Curreri said Transport Workers Union (TWU) Local 100 leaders and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) negotiators had agreed to resume talks.

 We have requested the leadership of the TWU to take the actions necessary to direct its membership to immediately return to work and they have agreed to take such actions, Curreri, the director of conciliation at the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, told reporters.

 The union board was expected to consider the recommendation to return to work later on Thursday.

 Assuming it agrees to end the strike, transport officials say it could take at least 12 to 24 hours for full service to resume on the subway and bus system.

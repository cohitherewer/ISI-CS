 Putin offers help, boosts peace in Ramallah

 Ramallah (West Bank), April 29 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin promised help for rebuilding Palestinian security forces and boosting West Asia peacemaking today during the first visit by a Russian leader to Palestinian territories.

 Putin said Russia would deliver helicopters for President Mahmoud Abbas. But he made no mention of supplying the dozens of armoured personnel carriers which the Palestinians had hoped for and which Israel opposed.

 ?We understand that the Palestinians, in order to enforce the law in this region, need to have all the necessary resources,? Putin said in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

 ?We understand they can?t do so using slingshots and stones. Israel understands this too.? Putin, on a West Asia tour that also took him to Israel and Egypt, is trying to revive the regional influence that Moscow lost after the Cold War. 

 In Ramallah, Putin placed a wreath at the tomb of Yasser Arafat, whose death last year and replacement by Abbas has buoyed hopes for peacemaking.

 Abbas agreed to a ceasefire with Israel in February.

 Palestinians had hoped that Putin would promise to send 50 armoured vehicles for security forces battered by a four-and-a-half year uprising with Israel as well as two transport helicopters.

 But senior Israeli officials said any such offer would be unacceptable to the Jewish state, where Putin tried yesterday to allay concerns over Russia?s planned arms sales to neighbouring Syria and help for Iran?s nuclear programme.

 Russia, alongside the US, UN and EU, forms the quartet of West Asia peace negotiators. Moscow?s peacemaking proposals have met with little sympathy in Israel, which is happy to keep Washington as the main power broker in the region. Russia dropped a plan to hold a peace conference in Moscow after it was criticised by Israel and the US as premature.

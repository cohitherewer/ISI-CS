 Fine Print

 Publicly personal Paul

 Los Angeles, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Paul McCartney has released what he calls his most publicly personal album, and has just begun a US tour that will keep him in the public eye through the end of November.

 Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, his 20th studio album since 1970, the year the Fab Four broke up, he broaches such topics as recovering from the death of his first wife, Linda, and finding a new love in second wife, Heather Mills McCartney. In an interview, McCartney said it took a few years after Lindas death from cancer in 1998 to bring those kinds of emotions out publicly.

 It wasnt hard, privately. Its easy to experience it. But, you know, you have to think about how to write this stuff down. It took a little while to find its way into the songs, for the dust to settle. How to make it art.

 Scotty in space 

Los Angeles (Reuters): Evidently Star Trek actor James 

Scotty Doohan took the catchphrase beam me up very seriously 

? his cremated remains will be launched into space in accord with his last wishes. 

Commercial space flight operator Space Services Inc will launch the actors 

remains into space aboard its Explorers Flight on December 6. Doohan portrayed 

feisty chief engineer Montgomery Scotty Scott on the Star Trek 

television series.

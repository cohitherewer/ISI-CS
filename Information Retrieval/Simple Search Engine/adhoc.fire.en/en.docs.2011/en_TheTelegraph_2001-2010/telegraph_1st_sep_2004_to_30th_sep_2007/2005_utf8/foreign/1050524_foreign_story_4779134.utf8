 Lassie legend

 Dublin, May 23 (Reuters): Legendary collie Lassie is to hit the big screen again for the first time in over a decade, playing alongside Irish actor Peter Toole.

 Toole has broken the actors golden rule ? never work with animals or children ? to star in Lassie Come Home, being filmed in Ireland.

 Toole, who shot to fame in the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, also has to face three times the competition ? three dogs have been chosen to alternate in assorted scenes as the celluloid canine. The film is set on the eve of World War II in a Yorkshire mining town in northern England. The Carraclouugh family fall on hard times and have to sell Lassie to the Duke of Rudling, played by Toole.

 Transported to the Dukes remote castle in Scotland, Lassie is determined to make her way home for Christmas.

 Seoul (Reuters): A Seoul eatery that was trampled by elephants is back in business with a new name and a new menu that aims to capitalise on its bout with pachyderm pandemonium. The restaurant that serves barbecue and other traditional Korean foods was closed for a month for repairs after three elephants rampaged through its plate-glass front. It has just reopened with a new name: Restaurant Where Elephants Have Been. Owner Keum Taek-hoon said today she had used the $18,000 insurance money to remodel her eatery. It now has a sign featuring three elephants and a new, 7,000-won menu item called an elephant set that consists of seven vegetable side dishes and a hot soup. Keum, who plans to decorate the restaurant with pictures of pachyderms, said the elephant set has proved wildly popular. On April 20, six elephants escaped from a zoo and roamed around Seoul. Three of them crashed through the eatery, sending staff and patrons fleeing in terror.

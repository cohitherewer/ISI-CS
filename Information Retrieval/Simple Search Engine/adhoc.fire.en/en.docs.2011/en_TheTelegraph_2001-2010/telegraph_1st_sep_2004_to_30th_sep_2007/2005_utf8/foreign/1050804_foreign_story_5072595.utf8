 Hotline fraud

 Berlin, Aug. 3 (Reuters): A court in Germany convicted a man for fraud after he racked up huge phone bills phoning a sex hotline from work and split the proceeds with a woman working at the service, authorities said today.

 He wasnt calling for the stimulation, said a spokesman for the court in the western city of Duesseldorf. The court handed the 38-year-old an eight-month suspended jail sentence for the ruse which he cooked up with the hotline worker. 

 German media said the man had made more than 160 calls within half a year, at a cost to his company of almost 16,000 euros ($19,700).

 Great gig

 is coming to DVD for the first time on October 25. The soundtrack 

 CD also will be re-issued on the same day with an extra 

 track from Bob Dylan.The rights are owned by the Beatles

 amp; Friends for the sake of consumers who dont 

 know anything about the concerts, an Apple spokeswoman said.

 Africa polio strain hits Java

 DONALD G. MCNEIL JR. 

 New York, May 3: A case 

 of polio has been detected in Indonesia, World Health Organisation 

 officials said yesterday, indicating that an outbreak spreading 

 from northern Nigeria since 2003 has crossed an ocean and 

 reached the world?s fourth most populous country.

 The virus, found in a village 

 on the island of Java, is most closely related to a strain 

 that was found in Saudi Arabia in December, the officials 

 said. The most likely explanations of how it got there are 

 that it either was brought back by an Indonesian working 

 in Saudi Arabia or by a pilgrim who went to Mecca in January.

 Indonesia?s last case was in 1995, 

 and it is now the 16th country to be reinfected by a strain 

 of the virus that broke out in northern Nigeria when vaccinations 

 stopped there, then crossed Africa and the Red Sea. 

 Officials recommended that Indonesia 

 immediately vaccinate five million children on the western 

 end of Java, including the capital, Jakarta, to contain 

 the virus. The country began planning such a drive last 

 week, they said. 

 Indonesia has more Muslims than 

 any other nation, and polio is now found almost exclusively 

 in Muslim countries or regions.

 Resistance to polio vaccine has 

 been high from northern Nigeria to the Pakistan frontier 

 because of persistent rumours that it is a western plot 

 to render Muslim girls infertile or to spread AIDS. 

 Paradoxically, after several states 

 in Muslim northern Nigeria halted vaccinations in 2003, 

 it was purchases of Indonesian vaccine that persuaded wary 

 imams and politicians to drop their opposition, because 

 it is a Muslim country. With each new case, the WHO?s goal 

 of eradicating polio by the end of this year slips farther 

 away. 

 With its emergency response fund 

 virtually depleted, the organisation is pleading with donors 

 for help with containing new outbreaks in Ethiopia, Yemen 

 and other very poor countries.

 At the disease?s low point, in 

 early 2003, it was endemic in only six countries: Nigeria, 

 Niger, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. 

 The current case was found in 

 a village in Sukabumi Province in West Java in an 18-month-old 

 boy who became paralysed in mid-March, said Dr Bruce Aylward, 

 coordinator of the polio eradication drive for WHO. 

 Genetic typing of the virus, completed 

 in India, shows that the original source of the strain was 

 northern Nigeria, said Dr David L. Heymann, the WHO director 

 general?s representative for polio eradication. 

 Comparison with databases at the 

 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta shows 

 that it is about 99.2 per cent similar to a strain circulating 

 in Saudi Arabia and 99.1 per cent similar to a strain in 

 Sudan, suggesting that it came through Saudi Arabia, ?but 

 they?re so close that it?s a hard call,? Dr Aylward said.

 Dr Christopher P. Maher, chief 

 of technical support in WHO?s polio division, visited Sukabumi 

 last week and found that no relatives of the child had gone 

 to areas where polio was endemic, but other families in 

 the village had members who had gone recently to Saudi Arabia 

 as workers or pilgrims.

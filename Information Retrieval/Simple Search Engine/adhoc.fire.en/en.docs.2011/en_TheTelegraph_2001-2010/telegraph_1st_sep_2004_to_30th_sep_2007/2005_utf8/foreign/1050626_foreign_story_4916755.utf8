 Groans, moans on the bourse

 Tehran, June 25 (Reuters): The teeming trading floor at the Tehran Stock Exchange was a hubbub of groans and barbed remarks today after hardline Tehran mayor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad trounced an economic liberaliser in presidential elections.

 Traders and investors, who had been banking heavily on a win for business-minded former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, resigned themselves to a downward trend in prices in weeks to come.

 There is no stopping the falls of the all-share index for the next two months until Ahmadinejads economic team is known, said analyst Mohammad Massah at Atinegar Stock Analysis.

 Ahmadinejad is due to take office in August.

 The TEPIX all share index closed down one per cent at 12,368.6 points, traders said.

 At the crowded bourse in central Tehran Reuters journalists overheard traders moan: All those who voted for Ahmadinejad are to blame, and If the other guy had won it would have been quite the reverse today.

 Ahmadinejads team, fearing it would be held responsible for knee-jerk losses, sent a statement to the market trying to soothe brokers fears.

 Ahmadinejad has strongly supported capital markets in his campaign broadcasts, read the statement that was carried on Iranian news agencies. But it did little to quell fears.

 Despite Ahmadinejads reassuring statement everybody is selling and will continue to do so, analyst Massah said. But trader Mohammad Ahmadi thought the downward trend would be short-lived.

 This is the same sort of negative activity we get with fears over our nuclear programme, he said, watching the lines of declining offer prices flicker across flat screen monitors.

 The bourse is highly sensitive to sabre-rattling on Irans nuclear programme, which Washington argues is a smokescreen for building atomic weapons. Tehran denies the charge.

 Some people have demonised Ahmadinejad, saying he thinks that the stock market is just a form of gambling. But I think this is just a brief psychological knock, Ahmadi added.

 Irans stock market lists 423 companies, valued at $45 billion. Price rises may have cooled from the heady days of 2003 when it soared 116 per cent over the year, but it is still a prime haven for investors looking to beat 15 per cent inflation. The hardest hit sectors today were property rentals, construction and mining.

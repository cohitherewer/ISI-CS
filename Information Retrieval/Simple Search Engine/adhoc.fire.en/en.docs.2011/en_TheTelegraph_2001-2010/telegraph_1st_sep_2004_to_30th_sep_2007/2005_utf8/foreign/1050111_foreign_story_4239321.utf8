 Abbas win stirs hope for peace talks

 Ramallah, Jan. 10 (Reuters): A sweeping victory by Mahmoud Abbas, an advocate of non-violence, in Palestinian presidential elections stirred hopes today for a revival of peace talks, but Israel demanded a Palestinian crackdown on militants first.

 ?The main focus at this stage, following (yesterday?s) election, should be Palestinian action on terror,? Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharons office quoted him as telling visiting US Senator John Kerry.

 Abbas won 62.3 per cent of the vote in the ballot in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem to find a successor to Yasser Arafat, the Central Electoral Commission said. The margin was at the top end of expectations.

 Israel has said it sees Abbas as a man to do business with and has praised his calls for an end to violence in a four-year-old Palestinian uprising. But it has criticised his intention to co-opt rather than confront militants.

 Abbas has promised to seek peace with Israel, battle widespread corruption and revive the crumbling Palestinian authority, reversing the legacy of four years of debilitating violence. ?Victory is beautiful but it will be more beautiful to fulfil the pledges,? said Abbas.

 Silent Osama foxes experts

 Berlin, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Why has Osama bin Laden gone silent?

 While his lieutenant in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, has not only stepped up the insurgency there but also claimed responsibility for three suicide bombs in Jordan this week, the al Qaida leader has released no audio message since last December and has not been seen on video for over a year.

 Bin Ladens longest public silence since the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001 is unlikely to be because he has suddenly gone shy, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld remarked ironically to German magazine Der Spiegel last month.

 Intelligence officials and security analysts see two explanations ? that bin Laden is so tightly holed up that he cannot smuggle out messages, or that he is biding his time and preparing a major announcement.

 Some of the means he had to communicate have dried up, said a US counter-terrorism official, who declined to elaborate. Hes isolated, and has difficulty communicating.

 He described this as an impediment to al Qaidas propaganda. Western intelligence officials say such messages, usually shown on Arab television channels such as al Jazeera, have a significant mobilising impact on potential followers. 

 In the absence of new material from bin Laden, widely believed to be hiding in inaccessible mountain terrain between Pakistan and Afghanistan, his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri has become the chief mouthpiece of the al Qaida leadership, issuing one audio and five video tapes since the start of this year.

 We have no indications (bin Laden) is no longer alive. We havent seen any messages from bin Laden but we have seen messages from Zawahri, German foreign intelligence chief August Hanning said this week. I believe this whole communications channel that was built up in Pakistan by the al Qaida structure is still quite effective and is functioning well.

 That may suggest that Zawahri and bin Laden are hiding at separate locations, said Mustafi Alani, a security analyst at the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai.

 Or it could be that bin Laden has deliberately delegated communications to his deputy in order to maximise the dramatic impact of his own rare appearances, like his video message just before last years US presidential election.

 According to this theory, Osama bin Laden will appear when there is a major, major operation again ... This will have maximum publicity, Alani said.

 Gaza settlers cry Nazi

 Gadid (Gaza Strip), Aug. 19 (Reuters): Israeli troops pushed through burning barricades and dragged screaming protesters from a settlement synagogue today in an assault on one of the last pockets of resistance to evacuation from the Gaza Strip.

 Die-hard Jewish settlers took to rooftops in the tiny Gadid enclave shouting Nazis as security forces swept in, hours after clearing Gazas main anti-pullout strongholds to break the back of opposition to ending 38 years of occupation. With the latest poll confirming solid support among the Israeli public for the first removal of settlements from land Palestinians want for a state, troops rushed to wrap up their toughest tasks before the start of the Jewish Sabbath at sunset.

 Marching past flaming cars, unarmed riot troops surrounded Gadids synagogue and forced their way in as 90 protesters, mostly radical youths who had locked themselves inside, lay on the floor. Some prayed. 

 Others cried or shouted abuse. In what has become a familiar scene this week, police wrestled them out one by one and carried them to waiting buses ? as they had in raids on two other enclaves yesterday.

 This is a desecration of everything that is sacred to Jews, said Boaz Puterel, 30, echoing the belief of ultranationalist Israelis that the Gaza Strip is part of Gods gift to the Jewish people and should never be relinquished. More than 80 per cent of Gazas 8,500 settlers have been evacuated under Prime Minister Ariel Sharons disengagement plan, and officials said they were far ahead of schedule.

 With 17 of Gazas 21 enclaves clear of settlers, troops plan to begin evacuating two small West Bank settlements on Tuesday in a 24-hour operation, a security source said. That would complete removal of all 9,000 settlers under Sharons plan. But Sanur and Homesh, built on territory where many religious Jews feel an even closer biblical bond than in Gaza, are seen as potential flashpoints because of an influx of Rightist Israelis from the most radical West Bank settlements. 

 Many of Gadids 350 residents had already left before troops moved in, but a few families defiantly remained. Columns of smoke rose from piles of burning tyres as soldiers went door to door ordering people out.

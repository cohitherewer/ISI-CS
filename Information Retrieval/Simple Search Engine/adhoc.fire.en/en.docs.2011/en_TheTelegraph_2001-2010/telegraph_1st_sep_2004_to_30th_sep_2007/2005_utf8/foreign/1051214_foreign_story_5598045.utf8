 Sydney iron fist after riots

 Sydney, Dec. 13 (Reuters): More than 450 policemen, four times the usual number, patrolled Sydneys streets today to prevent a third night of racial violence by youth gangs who have attacked people, smashed cars and hurled rocks at police.

 As rain fell on Sydney on Tuesday night, there were no reports of trouble as police checked cars at road blocks in suburbs scarred by racial violence in the previous two nights.

 The New South Wales (NSW) state Parliament was being called into emergency session on Thursday to give police special powers to lock down parts of Sydney, Australias biggest city, to stop the unrest, officials said.

 Police will also be allowed to ban consumption of alcohol in areas of unrest by shutting down licensed premises and prohibiting anyone from carrying liquor. The state will also raise the jail term for rioting from five to 15 years and double the penalty for affray, fighting in public, to 10 years.

 These criminals have declared war on our society and we are not going to let them win, NSW premier Morris Iemma said. You will not take control of our streets, he added while announcing the special police powers similar to those given during the Sydney 2000 Olympics.

 Racial violence erupted at Sydneys Cronulla Beach on Sunday when some 5,000 people, some yelling racist chants, attacked youths of Middle Eastern background. Police said white supremacists incited it.

 Drunk mobs of youths, some wrapped in Australian flags, said they were defending their beach after lifesavers were attacked. They believe the attackers were of Lebanese background. 

 Yesterday, youths, mainly of East Asian origin, attacked people with baseball bats, vandalised cars and were involved in rock-throwing skirmishes with the police for a second night.

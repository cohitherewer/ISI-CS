 UK diplomat in 7/7 Pak kidnap scandal

 ANTON LA GUARDIA AND PAUL A NAST 

 Athens, Dec. 27: A British diplomat has been named as the MI6 station chief in Athens who was allegedly part of a Greek-British team that abducted Pakistani immigrants in an attempt to extract information about the London bombings in July. 

 Amid growing controversy, the magazine Proto Thema said at the weekend that those who took part in the alleged abductions included a man listed as a senior diplomat at the British embassy in Athens as well as several named Greek officials. 

 A government D notice requests British newspapers not to name MI6 officers, even if they are identified abroad. However, the name given by Proto Thema matches that of a man identified as an intelligence officer on the Internet and in allegations made by the renegade MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson. 

 The public naming of intelligence agents usually means their recall to London. 

 The foreign office said: We do not comment on intelligence matters. We are not confirming or denying this story. But Greeces National Information Service reacted angrily. It said the Greek intelligence service never comments on such issues, even when they are non-existent. 

 However, it is our duty to point out that such claims are illegal because they endanger the national security of the country and of allied countries, but also endanger the physical safety of persons who are identified by name. 

 Seven of the 28 Pakistanis have testified before an investigating magistrate that unidentified Greek and British men forced their way into their homes in four Athens suburbs after the bombings. 

 They were allegedly blindfolded and driven to unknown destinations. 

 Two times a policeman hit me while I was on the floor, said Gul Nawaz, a 32-year-old Pakistani who says he has lived in Greece as an immigrant for three years. 

 I asked him for some water and he punched me hard in the face. Later he kicked me. They confiscated my mobile phone. They wanted to know everything about our friends, relatives and calls to London. They asked us if we had any links to al-Qaida. 

 The Pakistanis said they were questioned by two British officials ? one white, one black ? as well as about 15 Greek anti-terrorism agents. 

 The issue has caused a furore. The Greek branch of Amnesty International has protested at an attempted cover-up. 

 in the middle of the night. 

 Opposition parties have called on ministers to testify before parliament on Jan 11. 

 Last year, British spies across the Balkans had to be moved after they were unmasked in media stories planted by disgruntled local intelligence services. 

 These included the MI6 station chief in Serbia, who was forced to leave after a campaign against him involving the publication of his photograph and calling card on the cover of a Serbian magazine.

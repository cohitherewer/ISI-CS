 Fine Print

 JLo swings to salsa

 Miami, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Jennifer Lopez and husband Marc Anthony will star together in a music-based movie based on the life of iconic Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe.

 El Cantante (The Singer) started filming on Sunday in New York. Shooting is also planned in Puerto Rico, with release scheduled for sometime next year. Anthony will portray Lavoe and Lopez his wife, Puchi. Other featured actors include John Ortiz as Willie Colon. Lopez is also serving as a producer. 

 El Cantante takes its name from the song 

 written by Ruben Blades and popularised by Lavoe, who in 

 the 1970s rose to become one of the great voices of salsa 

 in the New York music scene, at the height of the genres 

 popularity. Lavoe, who initially recorded with Colon, later 

 went solo and reached the peak of his fame in the mid-1970s. 

 Smelly luck

 Berlin (Reuters): A German man who fell 

 asleep in a rubbish container after a bout of heavy drinking 

 had a lucky escape after he was tipped into the hydraulic 

 press of a garbage truck, police said on Wednesday. The 

 47-year-old was only saved from being crushed when the trucks 

 driver stopped to urinate before continuing his round. He 

 quickly switched off the press after he heard swearing coming 

 from the trucks interior. The man admitted drinking 

 a lot of booze and climbing into the container to seek refuge 

 from the rain, the police said in a statement.

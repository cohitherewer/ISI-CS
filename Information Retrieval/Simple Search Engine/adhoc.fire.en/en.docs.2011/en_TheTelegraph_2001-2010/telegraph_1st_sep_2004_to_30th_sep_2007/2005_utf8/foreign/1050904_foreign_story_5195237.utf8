 Relief not enough: Jolie

 Jolie: Shocked

 New York, Sept. 3 (AP): Angelina Jolie says she is happy aid is getting to the hurricane-ravaged New Orleans area, but that it is simply not going to be enough.

 The 30-year-old actor issued a statement late yesterday that she was shocked at the images coming from New Orleans, a city she said is very close to my heart.

 It is wonderful to hear of the relief efforts that are finally coming into New Orleans and the rest of the region today, but as we all know, it is simply not going to be enough, she said.

 Jolie said she has sent letters to members of Congress asking them to increase the speed of the federal response. She added: Like most people, I am simply trying to understand the situation.

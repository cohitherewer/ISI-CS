 Global trust in politicians low

 London, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Trust in politicians is abysmally low around the world and most citizens say their governments do not reflect the will of the people, according to an intriguing global survey of what influences our lives.

 Who Runs Your World? was the question put by Gallup International and the BBC World Service to more than 50,000 people in 68 countries in what was billed as one of the biggest surveys of public opinion ever conducted.

 Religion is crucial in Nigeria, family is vital in Latin America and the Japanese distrust authority figures.

 One of the most striking findings was international disillusionment with politicians. They achieved extremely low confidence ratings, with only 13 per cent trusting them.

 Two out of three people polled around the globe felt unrepresented by their governments. 

 The exceptions were South Africans, Israelis and Scandinavians. Most of these believed their governments were in tune with the people. There was a global desire to put more power in the hands of intellectuals such as writers and academics, the survey showed.

 As technology shrinks the world to a global village, patriotism is still a strong force, with feelings of national identity strongest in Latin America, southeast Asia and east Africa. Muslims and Protestants were the most likely to trust religious leaders. Jews appeared to be the most positive about being able to change their own lives. 

 The Japanese are shown to be deeply suspicious of authority with only journalists and business leaders gaining any substantial credibility.

 In Europe there is a low level of trust in all types of leaders ? military, political, religious, business and media.

 In India, Pakistan and Vietnam, the majority believe there is little they can do to change their lives. Family is highly important in Latin America where more than 80 per cent singled out their families as the ones most likely to influence their decisions.

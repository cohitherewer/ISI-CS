 Rare Korea praise for Bush

 Seoul, June 3 (Reuters): North Korea offered rare praise to President George W. Bush today, saying the US leader addressing the norths leader as Mr Kim Jong-il improved the tone for talks on Pyongyangs nuclear programmes.

 A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said Bush calling Kim mister was a way of politely addressing our headquarters of revolution, the official KCNA news agency reported. 

 The praise for Bush comes a day after the north labelled US vice-president Dick Cheney a bloodthirsty beast after he had said Kim Jong-il was irresponsible and runs a police state.

 If Bushs remarks put an end to the scramble between the hawkish group and the moderate group in the US, which has thrown the Korean policy into a state of confusion, it would help create an atmosphere of the six-party talks, the spokesman said.

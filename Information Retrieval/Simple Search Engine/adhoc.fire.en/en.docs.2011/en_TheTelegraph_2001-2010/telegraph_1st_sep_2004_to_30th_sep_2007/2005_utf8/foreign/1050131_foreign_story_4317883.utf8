 Condi cheers ?voice for freedom?

 Condoleezza Rice

 Washington, Jan. 30 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice hailed today?s landmark elections as ?the emergence of an Iraqi voice for freedom? but acknowledged there would be many difficult days ahead.

 Although participation estimates varied, Rice, who took office last week, said in a series of television interviews that Iraqis defied expectations to turn out in large numbers. At least 35 people were killed in militant attacks throughout the day.

 Rice said President George W. Bush was nonetheless very pleased by the voting, which will have broad implications for his legacy and his vision to bring democracy to West Asia.

 Rice expressed confidence that minority Sunnis, a key to Iraq?s future stability, would be included in the post-election political process. And she vowed that America would help ?brave? Iraqi voters ? who defied threats and deadly attacks to cast ballots ? to ?finish the job? of bringing democracy to their country.

 ?Every indication is that the election is going better than could have been expected ...What we?re seeing here is the emergence of an Iraqi voice for freedom,? she said on ABC?s This Week.

 She added: ?Of course, there are many, many difficult days ahead. But this has been an extraordinary day so far for the Iraqi people.?

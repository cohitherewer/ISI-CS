 Sculpture stolen

 London, Dec. 17 (AP): Thieves with a flat-bed truck stole a bronze Henry Moore sculpture of a reclining figure north of London, police said today.

 The statue, valued at more that $5.2 million was stolen on Thursday evening from the courtyard of the late sculptors foundation in Hertfordshire county, authorities said in a statement.

 This is a very valuable statue and we are working closely with the Henry Moore Foundation to ensure its safe return, Graeme Smith of the area crime unit said in the statement. Police said three thieves with two vehicles ? including one flat-bed truck ? gained access to the courtyard and hauled away the artwork.

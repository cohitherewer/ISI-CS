 US laptop sale ends in chaos

 Richmond (Virginia), Aug. 17 (AP): A rush to purchase $50 used laptops turned into a violent stampede, with people getting thrown to the pavement, beaten with a folding chair and nearly driven over. One woman went so far to wet herself rather than surrender her place in line.

 This is total, total chaos, said Latoya Jones, 19, who lost one of her flip-flops in the ordeal and later limped around on the sizzling asphalt pavement with one foot bare.

 An estimated 5,500 people turned out at the Richmond International Raceway in Henico County, Virginia, in hopes of getting their hands on one of the Apple iBooks. Henico County public schools were selling 1,000 of the computers to residents.

 Seventeen people suffered minor injuries, with four requiring hospital treatment, police said. There were no arrests.

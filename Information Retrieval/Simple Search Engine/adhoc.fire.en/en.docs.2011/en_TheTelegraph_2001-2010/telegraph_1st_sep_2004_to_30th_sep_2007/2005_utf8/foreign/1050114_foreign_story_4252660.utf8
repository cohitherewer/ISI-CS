 Thatcher son admits coup link

 Cape Town, Jan. 13 (Reuters) : The son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pleaded guilty today to a role in a foiled mercenary plot in west Africa under a plea bargain to avoid prison.

 The Cape High Court agreed to a deal for Mark Thatcher to pay a fine of 3 million rand ($500,000) or face five years in jail in South Africa, in addition to a further four-year prison sentence suspended for five years.

 Prosecutors said Thatcher was free to leave South Africa and he left his Cape Town home for the airport this evening and was expected to rejoin his family in the US.

 His American-born wife Diane took their two children to the US after his arrest, but returned to Cape Town to be with him. 

 When asked in court whether he agreed to the various terms of the deal a nervous-looking Thatcher said: ?Yes I do, Yes I do? repeatedly. Thatcher agreed to assist South African investigations into the plot against the government of Equatorial Guinea.

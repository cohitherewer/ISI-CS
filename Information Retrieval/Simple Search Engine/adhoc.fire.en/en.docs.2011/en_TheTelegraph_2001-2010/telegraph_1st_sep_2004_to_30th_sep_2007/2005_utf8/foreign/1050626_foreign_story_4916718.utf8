 Britain loses appetite for curry visas

 AMIT ROY

 British immigration minister Tom McNulty

 London, June 25: The government has withdrawn a short-term visa scheme which allowed foreign workers to take jobs in curry restaurants because of alleged abuse by Bangladeshis.

 The cancellation of the visa scheme which benefited up to 9,000 restaurant workers a year was announced by the UK immigration minister Tony McNulty who said the home office had evidence of widespread immigration scams by Bangladeshis.

 There is concern that the scheme in this sector is being used as a means of facilitating illegal entry, McNulty said. There is also evidence that third party representatives have submitted applications for sector-based scheme permits in respect of fictitious jobs or without the knowledge of the employer specified on the application for.

 There are between 8,000 and 10,000 curry houses in Britain. Though they trade under the generic name of Indian restaurants, most are run and staffed by Bangladeshis. The vast majority of the Bangladeshis come from Sylhet.

 It is certainly true that as the British have acquired a taste for curry, more and more curry houses have opened up, ranging from the up market Indian restaurants which charge ridiculous prices to High Street curry houses for British lager louts who use chicken tikka masala as an antidote to a long night in the pub.

 Unlike the first generation of Bangladeshi immigrants, the British born second have less desire to work long hours in restaurants and take abuse from their English customers. This has caused something of a staffing crisis in the Bangladeshi curry houses. 

 There is a bigger social crisis because many younger Bangladeshis have not bothered to study and are becoming unemployed and unemployable.

 After much persuasion, the government introduced a short term visa scheme under which foreign workers could come in for a year providing they could get a work permit.

 One of the authorities on the ethnic food industry, Peter Grove, said today: The work permit was relatively easy to get but the visa was not. There is a backlog of 120,000 waiting for visas in Bangladeshis.

 The government believes that restaurant owners are using their businesses as a way of getting in friends and relatives who have no skills in the cooking department.

 Many want to be front of office and serve customers but cannot speak English, said Grove. The government has now decided enough is enough and cancelled the entire scheme.

 According to Grove, the governments view is: Why bring in 10,000 new Bangladeshis from Bangladeshis when there are 10,000 Bangladeshis registered as unemployed in Britain?

 Although the Bangladeshis feel aggrieved at the tough stance taken by the government, they have also not put up good arguments to show why unskilled workers should be brought into the UK.

 It may be some Indian restaurant owners, who do genuinely need new staff, will now suffer because of alleged Bangladeshi dodginess.

 But Grove said: I dont think Indian restaurants are much affected from what I have seen. They have no problem showing their people have the necessary skills.

 The Indians cant afford to be too superior, though. It was the hard slog over 30 years by poorly paid Bangladeshi immigrants which made it possible for the Indian food industry to flourish in Britain.

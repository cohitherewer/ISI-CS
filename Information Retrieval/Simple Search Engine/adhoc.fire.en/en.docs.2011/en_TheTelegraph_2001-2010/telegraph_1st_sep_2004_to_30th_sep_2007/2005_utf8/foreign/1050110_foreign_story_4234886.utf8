 Risks and rewards for US in relief push

 THOM SHANKER AND JAMES BROOKE 

 Washington, Jan. 9: The huge American relief operation in the Indian Ocean carries risks for the Pentagon but also rewards, employing combat resources at a time the armed forces are stretched thin, but putting forth an image of an American military that is as caring and efficient in saving lives as it is violent and efficient in slaying adversaries.

 Senior Pentagon and military officials say the defence department carefully balanced its strategic needs with the imperative to open up logistical bottlenecks and begin ferrying water, food, medical supplies and shelter in one of the most challenging relief operations of the last 50 years. 

 In the hours after the tsunami levelled coastal villages across the Indian Ocean, killing more than 150,000 and leaving millions displaced, the Bush administration began crunching numbers to calculate relief donations. But a very different kind of risk analysis was under way deep inside the Pentagon and at the military?s Pacific Command in Hawaii, officials said.

 Senior military planners calculated in just a few hours how much combat power would have to be preserved for commanders in the Pacific to maintain a credible deterrent against North Korea, and even China, while sending aid.

 Although large military commitments to Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched American forces worldwide, Pentagon and Pacific command planners realised there was an unintended benefit, especially in the decision to move heavy bombers from home bases in the US to Asia, within easy striking distance of North Korea. This step was taken to maintain a strong deterrent in the Pacific as American military forces flowed toward Iraq. 

 These changes to the traditional force posture in the region have allowed the commitment of a large military contingent to the aid mission. As of Friday, approximately 13,000 American military personnel, nearly 20 warships and about 90 aircraft were assigned to the relief effort, said Lt Gen. Robert R. Blackman, commander of American military efforts for the relief mission.

 While the military has focused on fighting wars, the relief mission showed how swiftly it can shift missions and provide, on a large scale, mundane but life-saving capabilities as global transportation, cargo handling, water purification and emergency medical care.

 Officers and enlisted personnel involved in the mission say they are grateful for the change of pace and proud of the relief mission, which presents the world with an image of an American military saving lives of tsunami victims in countries where the US has strong military ties, and in some where it has few.

 Fresh US offensive in Iraq

 Baghdad, May 9 (Reuters): US troops launched an offensive in Iraqs most rebellious province, killing 75 insurgents, following a spate of ferocious bombings designed to undermine the new Iraqi government, the US military said today.

 As US soldiers acted to drive insurgents from the desert in western Anbar province, guerrillas struck again in Baghdad. 

 A suicide car bomb exploded at a police checkpoint in southern Baghdad, killing at least three people and wounding eight, police said. A car bomb targeting Iraqi soldiers exploded near the ministry of transport, wounding four people.

 News of the American offensive came after a weekend of heavy losses for the US military and with the Iraqi cabinet still incomplete three months after January 30 elections.

 US Marines, soldiers and sailors backed by aircraft launched the operation, a military statement said. 

 It did not say when the offensive started, but said 75 insurgents were killed in the first 24 hours.

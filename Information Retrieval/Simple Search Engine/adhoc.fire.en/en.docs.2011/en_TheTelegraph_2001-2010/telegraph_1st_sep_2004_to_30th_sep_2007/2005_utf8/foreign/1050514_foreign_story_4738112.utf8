 Washington, May 13 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice urged Muslims around the world yesterday to resist calls for violence from people outraged by a report that interrogators at Guantanamo Bay had desecrated the Quran.

 We have heard from our Muslim friends around the world about their concerns on this matter. We understand and we share their concerns. Sadly some people have lost their lives in violent demonstrations, Rice said.

 I am asking that all our friends around the world reject incitement to violence by those who would mischaracterise our intentions, she added in a surprise statement at the start of testimony to US lawmakers.

 I want to speak directly to Muslims in America and throughout the world. Disrespect for the Holy Quran is not now, nor has it ever been, nor will it ever be tolerated by the United States, she said. Disrespect for the Holy Quran is abhorrent to us all.

 Rice said the allegations about desecration of the Quran were being investigated by military authorities and if they are proven true, we will take appropriate action.

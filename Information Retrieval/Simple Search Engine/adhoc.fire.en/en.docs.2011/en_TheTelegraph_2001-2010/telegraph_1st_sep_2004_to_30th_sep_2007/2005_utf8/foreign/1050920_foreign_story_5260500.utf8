 Leader thorn in Germany truce bid

 Berlin, Sept. 19 (Reuters): German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and conservative leader Angela Merkel said they would talk to each other on forming a new government after yesterdays election stalemate, but each insisted on leading it.

 Merkel, still looking subdued and shocked after an unexpectedly poor showing in the vote, struck a conciliatory tone in promising to talk with all parties except the Left Party.

 We dont have a preference, she said, insisting however that her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their sister Christian Social Union (CSU) had come out on top in the vote, giving her the right to replace Schroeder as chancellor.

 Schroeders Social Democrats (SPD), energised by a result that put them just a percentage point behind Merkels party despite forecasts of a blow-out, continued to sound defiant.

 It is clear that Germans do not want Merkel as their chancellor, SPD chief Franz Muentefering said. We have a responsibilty to make clear that we want to rule with Schroeder as chancellor and implement much of that which we have undertaken to do. The likeliest outcome to Germanys most inconclusive election in the post-war era remains a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD.

 But divergences between the parties ? not only about who should lead but also over CDU pledges to free up the labour market and its opposition to Turkey joining the EU ? could prevent any accord before an October 18 deadline for the new parliament to sit.

 The weeks leading up to that date will be characterised by much grandstanding and hard-nosed politics, as the SPD, CDU/CSU and their potential partners, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, manoeuvre to get the most out of the talks.

 Both the Greens and the FDP, which with nearly 10 per cent did far better than anticipated, will now be wooed by rival camps.

 The uncertainty weighed heavily on financial markets, which before the election had hoped for a clean sweep by Merkels conservatives and the FDP ? a grouping that had vowed deep economic reforms. The euro currency fell over one per cent to a 7-week low against the dollar.

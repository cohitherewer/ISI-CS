 Microsoft CEO in kill-Google vow

 Steve Ballmer: Finish him

 Silicon Valley, Sept. 4 (PTI): Kill Google. Thats what Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer vowed to do when one of his employees told him he was joining the Internet search engine company, according to court documents filed on Friday in a bitter legal battle between the IT rivals.

 The allegation, filed in a Washington state court, is the latest salvo in a courtroom battle triggered when Microsoft executive Kai-Fu Lee jumped to Google in July this year in what Microsoft claims is a violation of a one-year, non-compete agreement, cnet news.com reported.

 In a sworn statement, key Windows and .Net architect Mark Lucovsky, who left Microsoft for Google in November 2004, recounted Ballmers angry reaction when he told him of his decision to work for the search engine company. 

 At some point in the conversation, Mr Ballmer said: Just tell me its not Google, Lucovsky, whose title at Microsoft was distinguished engineer, said. Lucovsky replied he was joining Google.

 At that point, Mr Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room hitting a table in his office, Lucovsky recounted.

 The 16-year Microsoft veteran added that Ballmer then launched into a tirade against Google CEO Eric Schmidt. 

 Im going to f***ing bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. Im going to f***ing kill Google, Ballmer reportedly said.

 The remarks apparently refer to Schmidts previous stints as an executive at Sun Microsystems and Novell, two Microsoft competitors. 

 Late on Friday, Ballmer issued a statement disputing Lucovskys declaration.

 Mark Lucovskys account of our conversation last November is a gross exaggeration of what actually took place, Ballmer said.

 Marks decision to leave was disappointing and I urged him strongly to change his mind. But his characterisation of that meeting is not accurate, he added.

 Plans by Google to hire Kai-Fu Lee sparked an immediate legal battle between the two companies, which have increasingly emerged as one anothers top competitors.

 Google announced on July 19 it was hiring Lee to head a new China research centre, with Microsoft immediately suing to block the move.

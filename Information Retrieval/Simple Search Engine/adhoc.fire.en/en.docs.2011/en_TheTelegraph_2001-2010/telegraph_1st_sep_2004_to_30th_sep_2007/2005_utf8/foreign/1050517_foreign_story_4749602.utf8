 Kuwait women get right to vote

 Kuwait, May 16 (Reuters): Kuwaits parliament passed a law today granting women the right to vote and run in elections for the first time, after pressure from the pro-western Gulf Arab states government.

 We made it. This is history, prominent activist Roula al-Dashti said. Our target is the parliamentary polls in 2007. Im starting my campaign from today. 

 Outside parliament, young women and men danced and cheered, while passing drivers hooted horns in support.

 Parliament speaker Jassim al-Khorafi said the legislation had been passed by a majority of the all-male parliament. There were 35 in favour, 23 against and one abstention on a vote that had met fierce resistance from Islamists, conservative tribal MPs and others.

 The US has been pressing its allies in West Asia to bring in political reform, saying a lack of freedom and democracy had fostered Islamic militancy. The Kuwait government wanted the bill passed before a likely trip by the prime minister to Washington next month.

 A similar decree for womens political rights issued by Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah was narrowly defeated in 1999 by Islamist and conservative lawmakers who wield enormous influence in the assembly.

 Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah said Kuwait now had the right to appoint women to the cabinet. 

 This is a celebration for democracy even though it is 45 years late, said Jassim al-Gitami, a former MP and head of the Kuwaiti Human Rights Association. Women activists said it was too late for women to vote and run for municipal elections set for June 2, after parliament earlier this month delayed a vote on the issue. 

 Islamists, in agreeing to the law today, stipulated that there must be separate polling stations for men and women.

 Kuwaiti women, traditionally more liberal and educated than their Gulf Arab counterparts but long lagging in political rights, had been pressing for years for a greater say.

 In 2002, Oman granted all citizens aged 21 and above the right to vote and women to run in elections to its advisory Shura Council. Qatar adopted a new constitution in 2004 which allows its nationals, including women, to elect 30 members of its 45-member parliament.

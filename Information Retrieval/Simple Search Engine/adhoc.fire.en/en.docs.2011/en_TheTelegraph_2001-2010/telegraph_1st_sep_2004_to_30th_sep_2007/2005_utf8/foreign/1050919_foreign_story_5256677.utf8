 N Korea nuke talks hope

 Beijing, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Monday loomed as make-or-break day in prolonged but still deadlocked North Korean nuclear talks after the top US envoy said he would leave Beijing at the end of the day.

 Parties at the talks involving the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and China have been poring over a draft statement presented by China today.

 It was thought to recognise in principle North Koreas right to nuclear energy, a position that Washington, backed by Japan, has up to now been against.

 Japanese chief negotiator Kenichiro Sasae said the delegates were studying the draft but he would not give details.

 I believe there is a possibility of reaching an agreement, he said.

 Talks are in the direction of advancing now more than they were yesterday... The Chinese side presented a proposal in line with present views from each country and each country is studying it now.

 US chief negotiator Christopher Hill said he expected to fly home from talks in Beijing after a full plenary meeting tomorrow morning, and yet he still held out the possibility of an agreement.

 I cant say at this point how this is going to end up or whether we are optimistic or pessimistic, except to say that I dont think it is going to go much beyond tomorrow morning, he said. I know that I expect to be leaving tomorrow afternoon.

 He described the China draft as an effort to bridge the differences over Communist North Korea, whose official name is the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK). I think it is a good deal for everybody, especially for the DPRK, which does have a long road to travel, Hill said.

 Three previous rounds and a marathon 13-day, fourth-round session have failed to breach an impasse in the crisis that erupted in October 2002 when the US accused North Korea of possessing a clandestine nuclear programme.

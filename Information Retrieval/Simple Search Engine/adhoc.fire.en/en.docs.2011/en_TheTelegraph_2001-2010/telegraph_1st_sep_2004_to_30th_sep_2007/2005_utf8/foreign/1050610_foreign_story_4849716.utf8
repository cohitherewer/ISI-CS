 Dictionary catches up with chav

 London, June 9 (Reuters): Whether its back, sack and crack, heteroflexible, or going commando, the dictionary is catching up.

 The latest edition of the Collins English Dictionary published today contains hundreds of new words that its editors say give a snapshot of how society is changing.

 Back, sack and crack ? a beauty parlour waxing procedure made famous by David Beckham ? is officially defined as (cosmetic depilation of) the back, scrotum and the area between the buttocks.

 Heteroflexible is someone who is usually ? but not always ? heterosexual.

 Supersize, the fast food menu word for big portions, can now be both an adjective and a verb, as in supersize me. And to go commando means to wear no underpants.

 The dictionary is filled with new terms referring to what editor-in-chief Jeremy Butterfield called urban tribes, like chav and chavette, both derogatory British slang for a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothes.

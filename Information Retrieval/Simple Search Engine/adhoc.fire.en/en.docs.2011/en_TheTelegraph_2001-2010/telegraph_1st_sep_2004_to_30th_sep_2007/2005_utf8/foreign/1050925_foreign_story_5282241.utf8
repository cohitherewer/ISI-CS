 Pervez rape voice on website

 Washington, Sept. 24 (PTI): Challenging President Pervez Musharrafs credibility after he denied saying that women in Pakistan cry rape in order to go abroad, The Washington Post today posted on its website the audio version of the comments he made to its reporters.

 The (audio) link includes the full nine-minute discussion with Musharraf on the problem of rape in his country, the newspaper said.

 In the September 12 interview, Musharraf told the Posts reporters that claiming rape has become a money-making concern in Pakistan. A lot of people say if you want to go abroad and get a visa for Canada or citizenship and be a millionaire, get yourself raped.

 Faced with protests over his remarks, Musharraf subsequently told a womens group in New York that he had been misquoted. These are not my words... I am not so silly and stupid to make comments of this sort. He later told CNN that the remarks were made by someone else in his presence.

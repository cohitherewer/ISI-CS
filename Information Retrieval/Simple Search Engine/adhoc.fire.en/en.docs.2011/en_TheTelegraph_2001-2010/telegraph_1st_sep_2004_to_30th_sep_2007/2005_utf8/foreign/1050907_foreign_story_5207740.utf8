 Director John Turturro had the Venice Film Festival singing along on Tuesday with his blue collar musical Romance amp; Cigarettes, the off-beat story of a man tempted by his mistress but still in love with his wife.

 The Sopranos star James Gandolfini is Brooklyn ironworker Nick Murder, married to the strong-willed Kitty, played by Susan Sarandon, but lusting after underwear saleswoman Tula, portrayed by a flame-haired Kate Winslet.

 The characters, funny and desperate at once, express themselves by singing along to foot-tapping favourites from Engelbert Humperdinck to Bruce Springsteen. In several sequences, they break into song on the street, while garbage collectors, cheerleaders or policemen dance in the background.

 This is something different, something completely new. It is a much needed breath of fresh air, said Gandolfini, who himself worked in a variety of blue collar jobs until he was 30.

 A lot of time with The Sopranos you have to work yourself into another world. This is more everyman, he said in an interview before the films official premiere at the Lidos beachside Cinema Palace.

 Romance amp; Cigarettes is the third film directed by Turturro, best known as an actor in Coen brothers films including The Big Lebowski and Brother, Where Art Thou?. Joel and Ethan Coen are executive producers for the film.

 Turturro, who drew on his own childhood for the setting and music, said he began to write the film while shooting the Coens 1991 film Barton Fink. But the project was delayed while he chose music and planned filming around Gandolfinis schedule. Im glad I waited, Turturro added with a smile.

 One of the directors most daring choices was to have his characters sing their songs, together with, and not instead of, the original. In the notes to the film, Turturro describes the approach as bathtime musical.

 I cast actors which I thought were very grounded. It was not like a musical comedy, Turturro said. I think that the way music is used in the film is the way people associate music in their own lives. People use it as a means to contemplation.

 Aiming to create the real, cramped conditions that drove his characters to despair, Turturro paid a great deal of attention to the Murder house, from its dirty light switches to the faded kitsch wallpaper and powder-pink exterior. That house, the size of it, is important, he said. When people are on top of each other, they have to find a way to escape. Music is a way to escape.

 Turturros all-star supporting cast include Steve Buscemi, a veteran Coen brothers actor, as Murders confidant, and Christopher Walken as the cousin whose wife ran off with the mysterious luscious Greek.

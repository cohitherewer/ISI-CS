 Ukraine leader in tricky Russia talks

 Moscow, Jan. 24 (Reuters): Ukraine?s new West-leaning leader today sought to mend fences with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but even as their talks began he showed his independence by naming a Prime Minister regarded with suspicion by Moscow.

 Viktor Yushchenko, who pledged at his inauguration yesterday to move Ukraine towards a ?united Europe?, said at Moscow?s Vnukovo airport that he wanted relations with Russia to be ?rational, successful (and) mutually beneficial?. 

 Out of deference to his Russian hosts, he was conspicuously not wearing the orange scarf that became his trademark during the ?orange revolution? that blocked a pro-Moscow candidate from taking power after a rigged election.

 But as he went into the Kremlin talks with Putin, who had opposed his election, it was announced in Kiev that Yushchenko had appointed nationalist Yulia Tymoshenko as Prime Minister.

 A close ally of Yushchenko in the ?orange revolution?, Tymoshenko, 44, faced charges of forgery and gas smuggling in connection with her activities as head of a private gas trading firm in the mid-1990s and an arrest warrant has been issued for her in Russia. She denies the charges. 

 The lightning trip fulfilled Yushchenko?s pledge to make Moscow his first port of call as president.

 Analysts expected Putin to quiz Yushchenko over his economic and foreign policy plans and sound out how far he will move towards the West and away from traditional partner Russia.

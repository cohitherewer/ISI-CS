 Catholics look to the future

 Vatican City, April 2 (Reuters): Even as they prayed for the dying Pope on St Peter?s Square, Catholics were looking to the next pontiff, all keen he should carry forward John Paul?s legacy but some hoping he would be more liberal on doctrine.

 Hundreds of faithful were gathered in a sombre vigil under the Pope?s windows today, some having stayed up all night. But amidst their sadness at the Pope?s fading there was also hope for the future of the Church.

 ?I?m sure the Lord will not abandon his Church. After this great Pope there will be an even greater one,? said Father Ugo Tadni, an Italian priest.

 ?He will have to continue (John Paul?s) work, the opening to the world and to all religions, to believers and non-believers, the love for young people ... the great political gestures as well as the most simple ones, speaking to the sick and to prisoners.?

 The charismatic Polish Pope has fostered better ties between his Church and other religions, especially Judaism, during his 26-year reign. John Paul is also credited with helping undermine communism in Eastern Europe.

 More recently, millions around the world who opposed the US-led invasion in Iraq admired the Pope?s outspoken opposition to the war there. ?I think the next Pope will have to follow his path ... and speak out on issues like the war (in Iraq), saying: ?We don?t want this?,? said Penelope Sanchez, a 23-year-old Mexican.

 Some Catholics, however, parted company with John Paul?s orthodox interpretation of Church doctrine. Among those praying for him today were some who hoped for reforms under his successor.

 ?It would be good if the next Pope pushed for more reform than this one but had the same personal appeal,? said German pilgrim Elisabeth Huelsdau, praying on the square with her husband Paul. He agreed, saying the Vatican should allow Catholic priests to marry. John Paul has vigorously defended celibacy for priests.

 ?I don?t see what makes women so different from men that they can?t be priests,? said 18-year-old Austrian Teresa Galler, while her friend Robert Dullnig objected to the Vatican?s tough line against contraception.

 ?On contraception the Church is out of touch, I disagree with their teachings on condoms,? he said.

 The Pope was the first non-Italian to become head of the Church for 455 years. There is no favourite to take over, but some churchmen believe the developing world should provide the next pontiff as that is where the religion is most vibrant.

 ?I would be open to a Latin American or an African Pope, someone who has lived the problems of these countries,? said Marianne Rottmann, from Germany.

 Hot meals back on BA plates

 London, Aug. 18 (Reuters): British Airways will resume hot meals on flights from its main London airport next week, its caterer said today, a week after a strike at the firm spread to the airline and left 100,000 passengers stranded.

 Loss-making caterer Gate Gourmet fired about 350 staff last week, sparking a sympathy strike by BA ground crews which brought BA operations at Heathrow airportto a complete halt.

 Gate Gourmet ... will improve service levels to near normal from Monday August 22, the catering firm said in a news release, meaning a return to hot meals for passengers served only cold food for the past week.

 Putin orders investment curbs

 Moscow, May 11 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin ordered Russias government today to draft legislation to secure national control over strategic areas of the economy by curbing foreign investment.

 The Kremlin press service said Putin wanted a bill readied by November 1 on limiting foreign investment in the areas of national security, infrastructure, defence, natural monopolies and strategic natural resources.

 Putins move came after celebrations in Moscow to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II were overshadowed by criticism from President George W. Bush of Russias record on democracy and treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbours.

 But rather than interpreting the instruction as a tit-for-tat move against the West, analysts said Putin was following through on policy priorities in his annual state of the nation address last month.

 This looks consistent with the governments plans from earlier this year to define strategic sectors where they would restrict foreign ownership or foreign investment, said Zsolt Papp, emerging markets economist at ABN Amro in London.

 Putin also tasked Premier Mikhail Fradkovs government with implementing measures on helping repatriation of capital parked by Russians abroad, improving tax administration and fighting crime and terrorism.

 All were key points of Putins April 25 speech, where he said natural resources auctions should have a proper legal basis and demanded the creation of a definitive list of mineral deposits which must remain under Russian control.

 Following the state-driven breakup of oil group Yukos, which hammered investors confidence, Putins push sheds more light on the kind of corporatist state he appears to want to create.

 Russia (is) moving toward a more Chinese-style resource allocation, said Philip Poole, head of emersging markets research at HSBC. 

 Effectively you have combination of a planned part of the economy with a functioning market economy. A Kremlin official moved to reassure investors there was no threat to plans to scrap restrictions on foreign ownership of shares in gas monopoly Gazprom.

 The so-called ring-fence should come down once the state regains control of Gazprom, Arkady Dvorkovich, the head of the Kremlins analytical staff, told Interfax news agency.

 Exactly when that will happen is in doubt, however, as a planned merger between Gazprom and state oil firm Rosneft ? in which the states share in Gazprom would increase to over 50 per cent from 38 per cent ? is on the rocks.

 Refugees go home: Pak

 Islamabad, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Pakistan is urging 15,000 earthquake survivors who flooded into its small capital city to return and rebuild their homes in the countrys hard-hit northern mountains, but many fear being forgotten as winter closes in.

 Many refugees living in tent settlements in Islamabad do not want to go back, despite promises by authorities to help reconstruct houses in areas devastated by the quake.

 Congestion in the capital city were concerns but officials said their main aim was to see people resume their lives. They are not becoming a problem for us, but we dont have that much space here, the interior minister said.

 Sunni elected Iraq speaker 

 Baghdad, April 3 (Reuters): Iraqi politicians elected a Sunni Arab to be the speaker of parliament today, ending a political impasse and taking a decisive step towards forming a government nine weeks after historic elections.

 In a ballot, the members of the 275-seat National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to elect Hajem al-Hassani, the current industry minister, as speaker. Hassani, a religious Sunni, is an ally of Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.

 ?We passed the first hurdle,? Hassani said afterwards. ?The Iraqi people have proven that they can overcome the political crisis that has plagued the country for the last two months.? But he also warned against complacency. ?If we neglect our responsibilities and fail, we will hurt ourselves and the people will replace us with others,? he said.

 Shia politician Hussain Shahristani and Kurdish lawmaker Arif Tayfor were elected deputy speakers. The Shias and Kurds, who came first and second in the January 30 election, had agreed between them that a member of the once-dominant Sunni Arab minority should be speaker.

 Parliament?s last meeting on March 29 descended into chaos after politicians berated their leaders for lack of action. The naming of a speaker is one step towards ending Iraq?s political deadlock, but a more important step will be the naming of a President, two Vice-Presidents, and Prime Minister. Those appointments are expected at parliament?s next meeting on Wednesday, Shahristani said.

 The President is expected to be Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, and one of the Vice-Presidents will be Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Shia. The Sunnis need more time to decide who their candidate for the other Vice-President position will be. Shia Ibrahim Jaafari will be Prime Minister.

 US justifies secret prisons

 Washington, Nov. 3 (Reuters): The US has sought to justify the detention of thousands of foreign terror suspects in a report to a UN panel as questions mount over possible secret CIA prisons for al Qaida captives.

 In a report sent late last month to the UN Committee Against Torture in Geneva, the state department gave its rationale for the holding enemy combatants in Afghanistan, Iraq and the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The report did not cover detainees held elsewhere.

 There is no question that under the law of armed conflict, the US has the authority to detain persons who have engaged in unlawful belligerence until the cessation of hostilities, said the October 21 report, which was recently published on the state departments website (http://www.state.gov).

 Like other wars, when they start we do not know when they will end. Still, we may detain combatants until the end of the war, the report said.

 The report listed well-documented instances of abuse at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq and Afghanistan, where two detainees died in Bagram in December 2002.

 Former PM not to back Yushchenko

 Kiev, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Sacked Ukraine Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said today she would not back the camp of President Viktor Yushchenko, who fired her and her cabinet yesterday, in parliament elections next March.

 I and Viktor Andriyovych (Yushchenko) will go to the elections in parallel ways. It does not mean it is a war. There will be two different teams, with absolutely different people, she told a television chat show.

 I will not go to the elections with those people who have discredited Ukraine so much. I do not mean President but his closest circle, she added

 Speaking on a television chat-show, Tymoshenko said: He practically ruined our unity, our future, the future of the country. I think this step is absolutely illogical.

 Yushchenko, who won vital support from Tymoshenko during last Decembers Orange Revolution that brought him to power, sacked her and her government yesterday amid infighting and allegations of mass graft in his administration.

 He has since named long-term ally Yury Yekhanurov to form a new government. But analysts say he still needed the support of the charismatic Tymoshenko for a tough battle ahead in parliamentary elections set for March 2006.

 Tymoshenko said there were now two clear teams in the country ? hers and that of Yushchenko ? and each would go its own way but without a war.

 Asked what her plans were now, she replied: I have not decided yet. I came here to listen your advice.

 In a reaction to the political turmoil, Ukraine delayed a roadshow of its planned 10-year Eurobond issue worth about $600 million by one week while the national currency, the hryvnia, dipped slightly on the interbank market.

 Yekhanurov, 57, was a regional governor until his surprise promotion yesterday. A low-key technocrat known for his loyalty to Yushchenko, analysts see Yekhanurov as being able to bring some consistency to Ukraines economic policy in time for the March elections. 

 He is expected to reduce state intervention in the economy and be more cautious than Tymoshenko on privatisation and currency issues, analysts said.

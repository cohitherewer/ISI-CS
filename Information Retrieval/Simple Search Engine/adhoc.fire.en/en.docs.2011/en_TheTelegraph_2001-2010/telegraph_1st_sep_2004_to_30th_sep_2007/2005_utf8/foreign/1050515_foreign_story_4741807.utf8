 Anti-China Chen wins key vote

 Taipei, May 14 (Reuters): Taiwan President Chen Shui-bians ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won an election today and secured a fresh mandate for his independence-leaning policy towards rival China.

 The National Assembly poll was held for the sole purpose of ratifying constitutional reforms already approved by parliament, but ties with China dominated the agenda as the vote followed bridge-building visits by Opposition leaders to the mainland.

 By affirming its standing as Taiwans largest political party with 42.52 per cent of the vote, the DPP can now dismiss earlier opinion polls showing its support might have eroded due to the islands gridlocked relations with China, analysts said. Chen can breathe a sigh of relief, said Philip Yang, a professor of political science.

 Setback to Iran leader as nominee pulls out

 Tehran, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suffered a sharp setback today when his nominee for oil minister withdrew in the face of criticism from lawmakers about his wealth and lack of experience.

 The withdrawal of Sadeq Mahsouli, a former Revolutionary Guards comrade of the President, adds domestic embarrassment to the storm Ahmadinejad has caused abroad by calling for Israel to be wiped off the map.

 The new President has staked his political reputation on putting his close allies from the conservative religious camp into the Islamic Republics most prestigious jobs.

 I would prefer the nomination of someone else for this great responsibility who would win more votes, Mahsouli said in a letter to Ahmadinejad, read out by parliament speaker Gholamali Haddadadel.

 Mahsoulis withdrawal will bring further disarray to oil policy in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) second biggest exporter.

 He was the second oil ministry nominee presented to parliament by Ahmadinejad. The first, Ali Saeedlou, was rejected along with three other ministerial picks in August. Ahmadinejad said he would nominate a new candidate soon.

 Ahmadinejads nominees for the education, welfare and co-operatives ministries all comfortably won their votes of confidence in todays session, softening the blow. Mahsouli walked out of the chamber before his letter was read out.

 Mahsoulis political experience was confined to a stint as a provincial governor and deputy defence minister, leaving him poorly equipped to steer energy policy in the worlds fourth biggest oil producer.

 Anoush Ehteshami, head of the school of government and international relations at Englands Durham University, said Mahsoulis withdrawal would weaken the Presidents authority. This will weaken (Ahmadinejad) institutionally as well as within the cabinet because people will begin to question his judgment and that will boil down to lack of experience more than anything else, he said.

 Ali Ansari, an Iran expert at Scotlands St Andrews University, said the President could still survive but would have to make concessions. I do not think it is fatal, but he is going to have to take some drastic action to realise that politics is the art of compromise, he said.

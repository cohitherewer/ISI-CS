 Tories find poll plank

 London, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Britain?s opposition Conservative Party hoisted immigration to the top of the pre-election agenda today with a pledge of tough controls that drew accusations it was playing the ?race card? to reverse dire opinion polls.

 The Conservatives, trailing Tony Blair?s Labour with an election expected in May, promised an annual limit on immigrants, quota for asylum seekers and an Australian-style points system for work permits. ?Some people say this is racist. It?s not. It?s common sense,? party leader Michael Howard wrote in an article.

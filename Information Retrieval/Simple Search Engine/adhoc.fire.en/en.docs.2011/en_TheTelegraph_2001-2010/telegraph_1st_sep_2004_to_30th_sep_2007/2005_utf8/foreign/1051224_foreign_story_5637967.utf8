 Kids suffer more before parents split 

 New York, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Divorce is tough on children, but for some the hardest part may come before parents separate, according to a new study.

 The study, which followed more than 2,800 Canadian children from two-parent homes, found that those whose parents eventually divorced tended to show high levels of depression, anxiety and behaviour problems in the years before the separation.

 And though children with depression and anxiety typically still suffered from these problems after the divorce, behaviour problems tended to fade, said findings published in the Journal of Marriage and Family. 

 While the aftermath of divorce can be emotionally difficult for children, the findings show that the family situation before it can be just as damaging, or more so, said study author Dr Lisa Strohschein.

 Perhaps we should pay more attention to what happens to kids in the period leading up to parental divorce rather than directing all our efforts to helping children after the event occurs, said Strohschein, a sociologist at the Alberta university in Edmonton.

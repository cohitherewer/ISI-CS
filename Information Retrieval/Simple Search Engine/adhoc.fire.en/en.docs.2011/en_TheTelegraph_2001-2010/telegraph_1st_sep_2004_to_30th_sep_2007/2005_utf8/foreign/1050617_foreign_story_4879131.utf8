 No research funds in climate draft

 London, June 16 (Reuters): A new draft communique on climate change for next months Group of Eight summit has removed plans to fund research and put into question top scientists warnings that global warming is already under way.

 The text seen by Reuters, titled Gleneagles Plan of Action and dated June 14, has been watered down from a previous draft which itself had no specific targets or timetables for action.

 The latest draft also explicitly endorses the use of zero-carbon nuclear power ? another development that will dismay many environmentalists three weeks before the summit of the worlds eight richest nations at Gleneagles in Scotland.

 The text is getting weaker and weaker. There are no targets, no timetables, no standards ? and even the money is gone, a source close to the negotiations said on condition of anonymity. 

 You are looking at a very, very serious problem for Blair, the source added.

 Prime Minister Tony Blair has pledged to put the fight against climate change at the heart of Britains year-long presidency of the G8. He visited three G8 leaders in two days this week to drum up support for his priorities.

 The leaders of the G8 and major developing nations South Africa, Brazil, India, Mexico and China will meet at the heavily guarded Gleneagles countryside hotel, 65 km northwest of the Scottish capital Edinburgh, from July 6-8.

 But the US, questioning the scientific basis for global warming, refuses to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol that finally came into force in February aimed at cutting emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).

 The new draft starkly illustrates the weakening process that has gone on in just six weeks.

 An introductory paragraph has moved the statement our world is warming into square brackets and has given the same treatment to a statement from the worlds top scientists that climate change is already under way and demands urgent action.

 All references in a draft dated May 3 to unspecified dollar funds for research and development into new, clean technology and fuels have been excised from the latest version.

 References in the May 3 draft to setting ambitious targets and timetables for cutting carbon emissions from buildings has completely disappeared from the June 14 text. Even a suggestion that the developed world has a duty of leadership in combating global warming is given the square bracket brush off.

 A section on managing the impacts of climate change which previously talked about global warming happening and bringing with it more floods, droughts, crop failures and rising sea levels now contains just one reference to the global crisis. 

 And even that is in square brackets, indicating that there is deep disagreement over its inclusion. 

 Campaign group Friends of the Earth said the latest draft lacked any sense of urgency or genuine commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

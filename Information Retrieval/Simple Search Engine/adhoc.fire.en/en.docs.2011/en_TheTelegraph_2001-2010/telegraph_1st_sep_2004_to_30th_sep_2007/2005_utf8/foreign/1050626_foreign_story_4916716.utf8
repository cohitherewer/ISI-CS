 US justice statue wrap falls away

 Washington, June 25 (Reuters): The cover-up is over at the US justice department.

 After more than three years of being blocked by large blue drapes, two Art Deco aluminum statues of semi-nude figures in the buildings Great Hall can be seen again.

 The Spirit of Justice and the Majesty of Justice, which loom over the stage in the Great Hall, were blocked from view by curtains installed by the department in January 2002, when former attorney general John Ashcroft was in office. The curtains were quietly removed yesterday after a decision by attorney general Alberto Gonzales, justice department spokesman Kevin Madden said.

 At one end of the stage is a 1930s-era female statue representing the Spirit of Justice. Although she wears a toga-style garment, one breast is exposed. At the other end of the stage, a male statue represents the Majesty of Justice, and has a cloth draped by his waist.

 When they were covered up, officials working for Ashcroft ? a devout Christian ? said the move to spend about $8,000 for curtains to cover the figures were made for TV aesthetics.

 The decision to install the curtains sparked a myriad of jokes and Ashcroft became fodder for late-night comedians.

 UK knife attack on Slater

 Christian Slater

 London, Jan. 24 (Reuters): American actor Christian Slater has escaped a knife attack after a performance of his show in London?s West End.

 Slater, 35, has been starring in a stage version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest? at the Gielgud Theatre, which ended a three month season on Saturday. Media reports said Slater?s bodyguard took the brunt of the knife attack, which occurred outside the theatre. 

 A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said police were called to Shaftesbury Avenue in the heart of London?s theatreland at 11 pm on Friday evening after reports of an attempted stabbing. ?A 44-year old man was attacked by a knife which luckily did not penetrate his skin but only his clothes,? she said, adding that a knife was recovered from the scene and that police are continuing to investigate.

 The New York-born Slater, star of films True Romance and Interview with the Vampire, made his UK stage debut last August when One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest? played during the Edinburgh Film Festival, before moving to London.

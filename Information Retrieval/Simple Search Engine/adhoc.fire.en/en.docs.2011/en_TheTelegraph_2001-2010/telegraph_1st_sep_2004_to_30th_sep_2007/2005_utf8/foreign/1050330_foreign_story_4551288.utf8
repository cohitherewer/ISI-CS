 ?Life has to go on?

 Phuket, March 29 (Reuters): Foreign tourists in Thailand shrugged off the threat of another killer tsunami today although tourism officials worried the latest major quake may slow an already fragile recovery after the December 26 disaster.

 Last night?s 8.7 magnitude quake off Sumatra killed about 1,000 people on the small Indonesian island of Nias, but did not trigger a tsunami as feared. But it came just three months after December?s 9.0 magnitude quake and tsunami left about 300,000 people dead or missing across Asia, including thousands of tourists.

 Although seismologists have warned of a third big quake sooner rather than later, tourists appeared prepared to take that risk in their stride. ?We still come because it?s not too dangerous,? Sverre Ruud, a 30-year-old Norwegian factory worker, said after he jetted into the Thai tourist island of Phuket where thousands were evacuated after yesterday?s quake triggered a tsunami alert.

 That view was echoed by Klaus, a German tourist who was flying home to Munich at the end of his beach holiday.

 ?I could die anywhere. I could be killed in Switzerland if I took a vacation there,? he said at Phuket airport. ?This is a nice country and I want to come back. Life has to go on.?

 But tourism officials fretted that potential holidaymakers may rethink the notion that the December tsunami was a one-off disaster. ?It might have some psychological impact among some guests. There have been some cancellations, but nothing significant,? said Pattanapong Aikwanich, president of the Phuket Hotels Association.

 Occupancy rates on Phuket, which has 32,000 rooms, were up to 40 per cent from single digits in January. Last night, Thai disaster officials used everything from megaphones to CB radio to broadcast the tsunami alert.

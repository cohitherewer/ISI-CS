 Britons snap up survival kits

 London, July 27 (Reuters): Britons fearful of more bombings are snapping up personal survival kits designed to give people the edge if they are caught up in emergencies.

 We have sold several thousands of our Commuter Emergency Kits, said the managing director of SurvivalBox.co.uk today. 

 The feedback we get from people is they are buying the kit for reassurance, Simon Johnson said.

 He said sales had surged by 150 per cent since the July 7 bombings on three London underground trains and a double-decker bus killed over 50 people and wounded hundreds.

 The pack, which can fit into a handbag, contains a particle mask to filter out dust, a torch to provide light, a whistle, water and antiseptic wipes.

 The mask is high grade, not something you can buy at a Do- It-Yourself (DIY) retailer, he said. After the July 7 attacks, survivors spoke of choking soot and of having to use their mobile phones to illuminate their escape.

 Johnson, who set up SurvivalBox.co.uk following the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC), said the kit was launched in March 2004, coincidentally just days before bombers struck in Madrid.

 We decided we needed to make a product that would make people feel safer, said Johnson, who but for a cancelled trip would have been in the North Tower of the WTC on the morning of September 11.

 Although police have made a number of arrests, they still believe there are bombers on the loose.

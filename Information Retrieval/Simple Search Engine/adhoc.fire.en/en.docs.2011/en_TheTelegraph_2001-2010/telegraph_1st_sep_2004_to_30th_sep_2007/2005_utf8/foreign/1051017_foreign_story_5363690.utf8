 Revealed: Bush worry on Pak nukes

 AMIT ROY

 Bush: Talking tough 

 London, Oct. 16: President George W. Bush appears to have given some thought to the tough action the US may be forced to take if Pakistans nuclear arsenal was in danger of falling into the wrong hands, according to a leaked memo from Tony Blairs office at 10 Downing Street.

 The alleged memo has been quoted in a book, Lawless World, written by Philippe Sands , a leading international lawyer who is a professor of law at University College, London, and a senior barrister at Matrix chambers, which he shares with Cherie Blair.

 According to the book, Bush and Blair had a telephone conversation on January 30, 2003 ? two months before the invasion of Iraq. According to minutes of their conversation taken at the time, Bush apparently told Blair that he wanted to go beyond Iraq in dealing with WMD proliferation.

 The countries he wanted to deal with include two of Americas allies, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, as well as Iran and North Korea.

 The book is to be published in the UK by Penguin, which says: In the explosive Lawless World, Philippe Sands argues that recent American actions are undermining the global legal order established after World War II and promoting its economic interests at the expense of human rights and the environment.

 Parts of the book have been leaked to The Sunday Telegraph which said that in his conversation with Blair, Bush implied that the military action against Saddam Hussein was only a first step in the battle against WMD proliferation in a series of countries. 

 The paper comments: Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have been close allies of the US in the war against terror and have not been considered targets in relation to WMD.

 The confidential memo, which recorded the Bush-Blair conversation on Downing Street notepaper, was written by Michael Rycroft, then Blairs private secretary and foreign policy adviser. 

 He sent the two-page letter recording the conversation to Simon McDonald, who was then private secretary to Jack Straw, the foreign secretary. 

 Rycroft warned his memo must only be shown to those with a real need to know. 

 The books author is quoted as saying that the conversation between the American and British leaders seems to indicate that Iraq was not seen as an isolated issue but as a first step in relation to a broader project. What is interesting is the mention of Saudi Arabia, which to the best of my knowledge had not at that time been identified particularly as a country with WMD. An alternative view is that the mention of Saudi Arabia indicates that the true objectives were not related exclusively to WMD.

 The inclusion of Pakistan is also considered to be surprising, although there has in the past been concern about nuclear proliferation in that country, the Sunday Telegraph says.

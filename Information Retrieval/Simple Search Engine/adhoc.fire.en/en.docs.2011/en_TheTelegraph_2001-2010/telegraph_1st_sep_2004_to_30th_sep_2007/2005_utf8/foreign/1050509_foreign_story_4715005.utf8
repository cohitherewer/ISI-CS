 Neo-Nazi march stopped in Berlin

 Berlin, May 8 (Reuters): A neo-Nazi march in Berlin was stopped by thousands of anti-fascist demonstrators today after a tense standoff that overshadowed Germanys ceremonies marking the end of World War II in Europe 60 years ago.

 Berlin police said 6,000 demonstrators opposed to the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) crowded into streets around Alexanderplatz square where 3,300 right-wing extremists gathered to protest what they called a German ?cult of guilt?. 

 Eager to prevent violence, authorities first ordered the NPD to stay at Alexanderplatz behind a buffer zone of barricades and police. The NPD later decided to abandon the march.

 Holding one of their biggest rallies ever, the far-right then stayed at the square. Speakers rejected the view that Germany was liberated by the end of the war on May 8, 1945. 

 Most Germans see May 8 as a day of liberation. The motto of the anti-Nazi rally borrowed the word for ?Thanks? in Russian: ?Spasibo ? We say thank you?. Some carried banners reading ?Fascism never again? and ?War never again?.

 The NPD, citing constitutional free speech guarantees, wanted to march through the landmark Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of unification, and past a new Holocaust memorial. The city government said ?no? to that, but approved another route nearby.

 ?This was not a day of liberation but a day of defeat for Germany and its nothing to celebrate,? said NPD leader Udo Voigt. The extremists with shaven heads and black clothing were required to pass through tight police screening to the rally. 

 ?A lot of Germans are tired of hearing May 8 called a day of liberation,? Voigt said, criticising the anti-fascists as ?intolerant?. ?Almost every German has relatives expelled from the east or a grandfather who was killed. Were here to mourn the millions of Germans killed in the war.?

 In a speech in parliament, President Horst Koehler said most Germans were relieved ?and numbed? when the war ended. ?There are unfortunately incorrigibles still among us who want a return to the racism and right-wing extremism,? Koehler said. ?But they dont have a chance.?

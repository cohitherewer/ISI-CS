 Clooney to womans aid

 London, Nov. 5 (AP): George Clooney denied a newspaper report that he was involved in a shoving match with a security guard outside a bar in Londons West End.

 The Evening Standard said Clooney had got into a pushing fight with a guard at Meza in the early hours of yesterday morning after using the bars rear entrance to avoid photographers.

 According to the newspaper, a reception was being held at the bar for a screening of Clooneys latest film, Good Night, and Good Luck.

 A statement by Clooneys Los Angeles-based publicist, Stan Rosenfield, said the actor did not get into a fight with a security guard... However, he did get into an argument with someone connected with the movie... And while it had nothing to do with the paparazzi, it did have everything to do with someone being unkind to a woman.

 While no punches were thrown, George told the person to knock it off.

 Rosenfield didnt give full details of what happened, and didnt identify the woman he was referring to.

 In the statement, Clooney said he was coming to the defence of a woman he believed was being mistreated. I wont stand by while someone is being insulted and maligned, the 44-year-old actor said.

 The Evening Standard said Clooney left with his ex-girlfriend, British TV presenter Lisa Snowdon, in a car that had pulled up at the bar.

 Redbus, the company distributing Good Night, and Good Luck in Britain, said: This is a storm in a teacup. George had travelled a long way for the premiere, and everyone was thrilled to see him and had a good time. It did not confirm or deny the incident.

 A Meza spokeswoman said none of the staff were involved in any incident with Clooney.

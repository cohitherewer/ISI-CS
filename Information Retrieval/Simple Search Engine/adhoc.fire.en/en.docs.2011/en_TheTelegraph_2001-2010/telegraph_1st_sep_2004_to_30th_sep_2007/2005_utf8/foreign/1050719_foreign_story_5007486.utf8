 Iraqis fear Saddam trial

 Saddam Hussein

 Baghdad, July 18 (Reuters): The expected announcement of a trial date for Saddam Hussein stirs mixed emotions in Iraqis. Some hope he is executed. Others want him back.

 But all sides have one dire prediction ? violence ravaging their country can get worse when he takes the stand.

 There is no way they can try Saddam. It is too dangerous because they will have to close every street to prevent violence, said soft drink vendor Abed Jassim, 54. If they do try him, they will have to get Iraqi leaders out of the country for their own safety. The killing will escalate.

 Chief investigating judge Raed Jouhi said yesterday a date for the trial would be set within days after a special tribunal laid the first formal charges against Saddam.

 Officials hope Saddams trial will erase painful memories of alleged killing, torture and mass graves and help defuse an insurgency led by his former agents.

 Iraqis overwhelmed by daily suicide bombings, kidnappings, criminal gangs and lack of basic services say the trial will not improve life one way or the other.

 Sitting in his beaten up car in a long petrol queue, Ayad Ahmed keeps his AK-47 assault rifle near his seat as he braves temperatures of 55-degrees Celsius.

 As a driver for a ministry official, he feels especially vulnerable to insurgents, and the simple task of filling up his car is risky in the new Iraq, which the US promised would be a land of stability after it toppled Saddam.

 What will Saddams trial change? The bloodshed will only get worse. I just think about surviving, he said, sliding his finger across his throat as if he were being beheaded.

 US and Iraqi officials hoped the capture of Saddam in December 2003 would demoralise the insurgency.

 But the violence keeps getting worse, leading some Iraqis to long for the stable police state of the past.

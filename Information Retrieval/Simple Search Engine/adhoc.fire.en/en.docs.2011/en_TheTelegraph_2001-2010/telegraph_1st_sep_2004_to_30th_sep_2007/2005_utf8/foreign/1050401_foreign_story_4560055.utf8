 UN ?rising star? faces harassment charges

 Carina Perelli

 United Nations, March 31 (Reuters): The head of the UN elections unit has been accused of making unwanted sexual advances towards a male employee and creating a sexually charged work environment, according to a confidential UN-commissioned report.

 The allegations were more bad news for secretary-general Kofi Annan as the UN faced findings of impropriety and mismanagement in the $67 billion oil-for-food programme for Iraq and sexual abuses by UN peacekeepers. In addition UN refugee chief Ruud Lubbers resigned in February amid sexual harassment allegations.

 Carina Perelli, the highly praised Uruguayan director of the Electoral Assistance Division, who helped organise elections in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been charged with violating UN staff rules and was preparing a written response to the charges, UN officials said yesterday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 Her defence would be analysed by senior official to determine if disciplinary action was warranted.

 The report by Swiss management consulting firm Mannet SARL, obtained by Reuters, also accused her division of a possible misuse of money for travel expenses, particularly to Latin America, for an ?inner circle? of staff members.

 The report said that employees, in interviews, had raised allegations of sexual and workplace harassment, misuse of agency funds and mismanagement. ?The work environment within the division is considered offensive by many of those interviewed and has contributed to emotional harm,? the report said.

 Perelli, 48, could not immediately be reached for comment. She is known at the world body as a rising star with an outspoken manner who often accents her speech with salty language. But staff turnover has been high in the unit of 13 professionals she has run for nine years.

 The internal review was ordered after complaints about the unit?s operations surfaced during a 2003 staff retreat.

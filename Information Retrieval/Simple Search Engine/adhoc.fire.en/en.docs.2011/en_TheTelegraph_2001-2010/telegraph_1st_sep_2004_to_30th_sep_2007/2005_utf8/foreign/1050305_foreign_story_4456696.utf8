 China eyes Taiwan, to hike budget for defence

 Beijing, March 4 (Reuters): Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will stress the goal of peaceful reunification with Taiwan in a speech to parliament tomorrow but will give few details of a new law that could provide the basis for an attack on the island.

 The country will also raise the defence budget by 12.6 per cent this year to nearly $30 billion, but officials said the increase was aimed at military modernisation, not at preparation to use force against Taiwan.

 ?The draft of the anti-secession law to be reviewed by this session fully reflects our consistent position to strive for peaceful unification with our utmost sincerity and greatest efforts,? Wen will say, according to an advance text of his report to the annual National People?s Congress (NPC) session.

 China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the country?s civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalists fled there. It has threatened to attack the self-governing island of 23 million people if it formally declares independence.

 The new law ?shows the Chinese people?s common will and firm resolve to safeguard the nation?s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and absolutely not allow Taiwan independence forces to split Taiwan from China by any means,? Wen says.

 His words echo the spirit of comments made by President Hu Jintao and parliament spokesman Jiang Enzhu yesterday, who said the law was not a ?war mobilisation act?.

 ?Peaceful reunification does not mean that one side swallows the other, but that the two sides confer on reunification through consultation on an equal footing,? Hu said in a hint at flexibility, although he reiterated Chinas long-standing conditions for resuming talks stalled since 1999.

 He also had harsh words for what he called Taiwan independence forces, saying they threatened peace and stability in the region.

 ?If we do not oppose and check ... their activities resolutely, they will certainly pose a severe threat to China?s national sovereignty and territorial integrity (and) ruin the prospects of peaceful reunification,? he said in comments carried by the official Xinhua news agency.

 The NPC is widely viewed as a rubber stamp but the anti-secession bill has given this years session a strategic edge.

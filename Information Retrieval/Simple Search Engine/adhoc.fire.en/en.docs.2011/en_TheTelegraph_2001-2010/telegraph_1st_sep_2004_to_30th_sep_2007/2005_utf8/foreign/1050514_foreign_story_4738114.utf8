 Taiwan rejects China offer

 Taipei/Beijing, May 13 (Reuters): Taiwan today rejected Chinese offers of economic sweeteners and a new formula to define current bilateral ties, dashing hopes for fresh talks between the rivals and prolonging a dangerous stalemate.

 James Soong, head of Taiwans second-biggest opposition party, and Chinese President Hu Jintao proposed a two sides, one China formula yesterday as a basis for talks between Beijing and an island it considers its own.

 China also offered to ease employment for Taiwan residents on the mainland, simplify entry and exit procedures and reduce tuition fees for Taiwan students. The move came as Soong ended a nine-day visit, the latest in a string by opposition delegations.

 Beijings strategy aims to increase pressure on President Chen Shui-bian, who supports independence for Taiwan, the self-governing island China insists must return to the fold. Chinas Kuomintang Nationalist authorities fled to Taiwan in 1949 and set up their government there after losing power on the mainland to Mao Zedongs communist armies.

 Chens government said today that any agreements between China and the islands opposition parties were of no consequence and Beijing should deal with the government on these issues.

 The government is disappointed and regrets that Chinas policy towards Taiwan is still rigid and shows no concrete sincerity to improve bilateral relations, said Michael You, vice chairman of Taiwans Mainland Affairs Council. We insist any issues relating to government authority must be discussed through official channels on both sides, he said, adding that Taiwan remained willing to open dialogue with China on an equal basis with no preconditions.

 China said its offers were aimed at deepening ties between the two sides. Economic links have flourished despite a long political stalemate that has turned the Taiwan Strait into a dangerous flashpoint.

 This is another gesture of affinity of easing tensions across the Taiwan Strait, Chinas Xinhua news agency reported, quoting Chen Yunlin, head of Chinas Taiwan Affairs Office.

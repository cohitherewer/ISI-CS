 Amid row, Harvard boss relents on remarks

 Lawrence Summers

 Cambridge (Massachusetts), Feb. 18 (Reuters): Harvard University president Lawrence Summers bowed to faculty pressure yesterday and released a copy of his controversial remarks on women as top school officials publicly voiced support for him.

 Facing a brewing revolt by some undergraduate faculty, Summers posted a transcript of his remarks on his website along with a letter in which he again atoned for the things he said. ?If I could turn back the clock, I would have spoken differently on matters so complex,? Summers wrote, referring to remarks he made last month at a conference that innate differences between men and women may help explain why fewer women work in the academic sciences.

 ?I should have left such speculation to those more expert in the relevant fields,? he said of his remarks, which sparked an uproar when word leaked out. In the context of why there were fewer women in science and engineering, he had said ?there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude? that might explain the phenomenon.

 ?I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong,? Summers had added. The former US treasury secretary has apologised repeatedly for his remarks, but the controversy served as a rallying cry for faculty and others upset with his record since he took over the oldest US institution of higher learning in 2001.

 This week, several professors confronted him at a faculty meeting, saying he had brought shame on the school. Others demanded he release a copy of the remarks ? a move he had resisted ? to clear the air.

 A similar meeting has been scheduled for next Tuesday, with some professors saying there may be a vote of confidence in Summers and others calling for his resignation.

 But the governing Harvard Corporation, a secretive seven-member board that has authority to fire Summers, issued a statement saying it stood by the Ivy League school chief.

 Summers, who is one of the seven, received a big show of support in the form of a letter from fellow corporation member James Houghton to the Harvard community.

 Houghton, praising the president?s ?energetic leadership?, said the Corporation had spoken at length with Summers about his comments on women.

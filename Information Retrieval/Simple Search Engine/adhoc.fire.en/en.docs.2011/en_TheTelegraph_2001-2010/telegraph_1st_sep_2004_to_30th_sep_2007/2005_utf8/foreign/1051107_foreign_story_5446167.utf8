 Qaida runs into rage in Morocco

 Casabanca, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Thousands marched through Moroccos biggest city today to protest al Qaidas decision to kill two Moroccan hostages in Iraq.

 Holding banners and chanting Muslims are brothers. A Muslim does not kill his brother and Yes to freedom, No to terrorism and barbarity, the protesters marched through Casablanca, a city of 6 million and Moroccos financial capital.

 Al Qaida has said it decided to kill the Moroccan embassy employees, Abderrahim Boualem and Abdelkrim al Mouhafidi, because of Moroccos support for the US-backed Iraqi government.

 Top Moroccan officials, ministers, pro-government and Opposition party leaders and trade unions and rights groups, led the protest to put pressures on al Qaida to free the two men.

 Moroccos influential organisation of Islamic schol- ars, known as the High Council of the Ulema and the Councils of Ulema in the Moroc-can Kingdom, dismissed al Qaidas argument that its verdict to kill the two emba-ssy employees was Gods judgment.

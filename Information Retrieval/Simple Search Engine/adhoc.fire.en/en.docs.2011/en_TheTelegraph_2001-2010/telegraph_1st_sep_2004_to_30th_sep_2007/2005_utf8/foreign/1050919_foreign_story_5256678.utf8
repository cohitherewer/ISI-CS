 Iraq approves statute draft

 Baghdad, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Iraqs parliament finally approved a draft constitution today, just four weeks before the text is put to a referendum, as violence persisted after one of the bloodiest weeks since the US invasion of 2003.

 Kurdish parliamentary deputy Faris Hussein was shot dead along with three bodyguards last night as he travelled to Baghdad from the north. Fellow deputy Haider Qassem was wounded.

 The shooting as well as a car bomb which killed 30 people in Baghdad yesterday rounded off a week of carnage which saw 250 people killed in the capital and elsewhere.

 The Kurdish- and Shia-led government, backed by occupying US forces, is facing a Sunni Arab insurgency aimed at bringing it down, and the US military has said it expected violence to rise before the October 15 constitutional referendum.

 The National Assembly only approved a final text of the constitution today, giving little time for the UN to print five million copies and distribute it nationwide ahead of the referendum.

 Hussain al-Shahristani, the deputy speaker of parliament, said it was an absolute final draft of the text, which has been held up repeatedly by last-minute amendments.

 There is no way there will be any changes now, he said. The draft is being submitted to the United Nations and will be presented to the Iraqi people soon.

 The UN official in charge of printing the text, Nicholas Haysom, said his office could get it out on time even though it had come in so late. 

 He said the first copies would be ready for distribution in about five days time.

 Were pretty confident that were going to be able to get it done, he said. 

 Theres a lot of demand out there from civic groups, political offices and others to get copies of the draft constitution and see it distributed, he added, saying all five million copies would be run off by the end of September.

 Report: No proof Syria hid arms

 Washington, April 26 (Reuters): 

 The US-led group that scoured Iraq for weapons of mass destruction 

 has found no evidence Iraq hid such weapons in Syria before 

 the US invasion in March 2003, according to a final report 

 on the investigation.

 The 1,700-member Iraq Survey Team, responsible for the weapons hunt, also said in a report released late yesterday it found no Iraqi officials with direct knowledge of a transfer of weapons of mass destruction developed by former President Saddam Hussein.

 President George W. Bush and other US officials cited a grave threat posed by Iraq?s chemical and biological weapons and Baghdad?s efforts to acquire a nuclear arms capability as a justification for war. No such weapons were found but US officials said it was possible Saddam sent them to Syria for safekeeping.

 The report is the final addendum to the investigators? September report that concluded pre-war Iraq had no WMD stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons and that its nuclear programme had decayed before the US-led invasion.

 The Iraq Survey Group, led by CIA special adviser Charles Duelfer, wrapped up its physical searches for weapons of mass destruction last December.

 The new report posted on the CIA website said: ?Based on evidence available ... it is unlikely that an official transfer of WMD material from Iraq to Syria took place. However ISG was unable to rule out unofficial movement of limited WMD-related materials.?

 It said investigators ?found no senior policy, program or intelligence officials who admitted any direct knowledge of such movement of WMD.?

 ?Indeed, they uniformly denied any knowledge of residual WMD that have been secreted to Syria,? the report said.

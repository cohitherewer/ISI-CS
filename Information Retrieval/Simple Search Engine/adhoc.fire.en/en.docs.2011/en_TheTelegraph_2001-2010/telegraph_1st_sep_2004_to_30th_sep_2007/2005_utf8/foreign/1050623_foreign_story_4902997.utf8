 No travel plans, says Mai

 Islamabad, June 22 (Reuters): A Pakistani woman gangraped in 2002 on the orders of a village council said today the government had promised to return her passport but she has no immediate plans to travel abroad.

 The case of Mukhtaran Mai provoked a national outcry and focused international attention on the treatment of women in rural Pakistan.

 Human rights workers had wanted Mai to go abroad to speak on the plight of women but the government, saying it was acting in the interests of her security, recently banned her from overseas travel.

 Following protests, the ban was lifted last week but Mai said today she had still not got her passport back. Nilofar Bakhtiar called me and said she is sending the passport, Mai said by telephone from her village of Meerwala in Punjab province, referring to a Prime Ministers adviser.

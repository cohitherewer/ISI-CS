 Iran women face dress scrutiny

 Tehran, April 19 (Reuters): Iranian police have vowed to crack down on the way women dress this summer when soaring temperatures typically tempt many to flout the country?s strict Islamic dress code, newspapers reported today.

 Sartorial battles have become a regular feature of Iranian life in the summer months when police try to confront growing numbers of young women who test the limits of the law with shorter, brighter, skimpier clothing.

 Iran?s Islamic dress code obliges women to cover all but their face and hands and to disguise the shape of their bodies. Violators can receive lashes, fines or imprisonment.

 But many women, especially in the capital Tehran, shun the traditional head-to-toe black chador to don calf-length Capri pants, tight-fitting, thigh-length coats and brightly-coloured scarves pushed back to expose plenty of hair. Tehran police chief Morteza Talaei said the crackdown would form part of an all-out war against social vices, the Hambastegi newspaper quoted him as saying.

 ?In accordance with the law, the police will confront those who appear in public in an indecent and inappropriate way,? Talaei said. The change in womens attire over recent years has been one of the more noticeable impacts of reformist President Mohammad Khatami who has encouraged authorities to ease up slightly on social restrictions.

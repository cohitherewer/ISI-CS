 Where are the people, asks Annan after tour

 Banda Aceh (Indonesia), Jan. 7 (Reuters): UN secretary general Kofi Annan toured Indonesia?s tsunami-ravaged Aceh province today, flying by helicopter to the razed town of Meulaboh, beyond which is a black hole of devastation.

 ?I must admit I have never seen such utter destruction, mile after mile. You wonder, where are the people?,? said Annan on his return to the provincial capital, Banda Aceh.

 Meulaboh on the west coast of the island of Sumatra is just 150 km from the epicentre of the undersea earthquake that triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing more the 153,000 people from Asia to Africa. The UN estimated that one-third of Meulaboh?s 120,000 people were killed when the giant waves ripped through the town on December 26.

 ?I am deeply overwhelmed with the misery I just saw with my own eyes,? said an emotional Tadao Chino, president of the Asian Development Bank who accompanied Annan, along with the leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

 But 12 days after the tsunami hit, and with aid merely trickling in to Meulaboh aboard US military helicopters, Annan said survivors were starting to rebuild their lives. ?We saw people beginning to pick up the pieces of their lives and that tells us something about the resilience of the human spirit,? Annan said.

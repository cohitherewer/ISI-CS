 Moss woes multiply

 London, Sept. 21 (AP): Burberry cancelled a deal with supermodel Kate Moss and Chanel decided not to renew her contract today, as police said they were investigating allegations that she recently used cocaine.

 The new blows came a day after Hennes amp; Mauritz, Europes largest fashion retailer, dropped plans to have Moss represent one of its clothing lines this Autumn.

 Kate has always been highly professional for Burberry the company said, announcing that it was cancelling a project with her.

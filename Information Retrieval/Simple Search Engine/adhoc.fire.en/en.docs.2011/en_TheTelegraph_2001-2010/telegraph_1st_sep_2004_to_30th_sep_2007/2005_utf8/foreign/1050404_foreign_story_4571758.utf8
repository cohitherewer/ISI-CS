 Fine Print

 Mona Lisa

 Paris, April 3 (AFP): The world?s most famous portrait the Mona Lisa will have plenty to smile about when she moves into her new home on Wednesday, with the reopening of part of the Louvre museum after four years of works.

 The Salle des Etats has been completely renovated since being closed in 2001 in a bid to provide a suitable home for Leonardo da Vinci?s portrait of the woman with the enigmatic smile.

 Designed by Peruvian architect Lorenzo Piqueras, the 4.81 million euro ($6.2 million) repairs have been virtually all paid for by Japan?s Nippon Television Network.

 Watch it

 Basel (AFP): Watchmakers at the Baselworld 

 International Watch and Jewellery fair are bracing for a 

 new challenge to declining sales: the cellphone. ?Youngsters 

 don?t have a watch anymore today. If they want to know the 

 time, they look at their mobile, which never leaves them,? 

 said Patrick Besnard, a representative for the French watchmaking 

 industry at the fair.

 Cruise baby on screen

 Los Angeles, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Not every family can afford one at a price tag of up to $200,000 but actor Tom Cruise says he bought a sonogram machine for his pregnant fiance Katie Holmes so that they can monitor the development of their child.

 In an interview with ABCs Barbara Walters to be aired on a November 29 television special about the most fascinating people of 2005, Cruise said: Im going to donate it to a hospital when we are done.

 A sonogram machine, which uses ultra-sound to look at a foetuss development, can cost between $150,000 and $200,000, according to People magazine which published excerpts from the interview yesterday.

 Cruise said he did not know the gender of the child but said if he did, he would not reveal it. Walters then asked him: So what do you see? and he answered a little baby. The couple revealed last month that Holmes, 26, was pregnant.

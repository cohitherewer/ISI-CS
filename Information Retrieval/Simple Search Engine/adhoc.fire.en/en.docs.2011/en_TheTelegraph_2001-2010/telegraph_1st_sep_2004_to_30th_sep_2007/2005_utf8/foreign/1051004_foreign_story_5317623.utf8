 Your daily pinch of salt

 London, Oct. 3 (Reuters): People should cut their daily salt intake to 6 grams a day ? one heaped teaspoon ? to reduce their blood pressure levels and the risk of heart disease and stroke, health experts said today.

 A new report by Britains Medical Research Council (MRC), which summarises scientific evidence on the links between salt and health, said cutting salt consumption from the average 9.5 to 6 grams a day could result in a 13 per cent reduction in stroke and a 10 per cent decrease in heart disease.

 It was felt to be a level that brings significant health benefits, Dr Susan Jebb, head of nutrition and health research at the MRC, said. It is achievable.

 Britain has set a salt reduction target of 6 grams a day for adults by 2010. Jebb said the EU and other countries are looking at the British model to set their priorities.

 Salt is composed of 40 per cent sodium and 60 per cent chloride. People need sodium because it regulates water in the body and acts as a message coordinating system by carrying electrical charges.

 But about 1 gram a day would be sufficient to carry out those functions.

 Too much salt raises blood pressure which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease ? one of the worlds leading killers. Salt increases blood pressure because the sodium makes the body retain more water and the extra water in the blood vessels creates more pressure.

 Paul Lincoln, the chief executive of the National Heart Forum, said salt is a major, modifiable risk factor for high blood pressure. About 75 per cent of salt is hidden in processed foods, he said.

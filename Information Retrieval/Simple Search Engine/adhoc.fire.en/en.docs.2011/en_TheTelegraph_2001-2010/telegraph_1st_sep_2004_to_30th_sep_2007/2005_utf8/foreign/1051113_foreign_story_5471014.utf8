 Bangkok toddler tests positive for bird flu

 Bangkok, Nov. 12 (Reuters): A Bangkok toddler has tested positive for bird flu, while China confirmed more cases and Japan drew up an action plan to tackle any outbreak of the disease which has swept Asia and spread into Europe.

 The one-year-old boy probably contracted the H5N1 virus from playing at home around chickens which later died of the virus, Paijit Warachit, director-general of the department of medical science, said today.

 The Thai boy is the first human case in Bangkok since a fresh flare-up of the deadly disease there a month ago. The virus has killed 13 Thais.

 Worried about a possible mutation into a transmittable killer human virus, Japan has drafted plans to tackle an epidemic, including closing schools around infection zones.

 Blair casts doubt on UK referendum

 San Gimignano (Italy), May 30 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair cast doubt today on whether Britain would hold its planned referendum on the EU constitution following Frances rejection of the treaty.

 Britain had previously said it would hold its own vote next year, but Blair said that EU leaders needed time to think about the French result and address profound anxiety across the 25-nation bloc about the economy. What is important now is to have time for reflection, he said during a brief holiday in TuscanyFrance rejected the constitution in a referendum yesterday, dealing a major blow to a charter designed to make the enlarged 25-member bloc run smoothly. If the Dutch also reject the treaty in their referendum on Wednesday, the European Council may declare it dead.

 If there is a constitutional treaty to vote upon, we will have a vote in Britain before ratifying it, Blair said.

 But I think we now have to see what happens in the Dutch referendum in a couple of days time. We have to have discussion at the European Council, he added, referring to a meeting of EU leaders slated for June 16.

 Although Blair backs the constitution, opinion polls have consistently pointed to a defeat in any British vote, which could end his career.

 He defended the treaty again today, saying it provided a sensible set of rules for the newly expanded EU.

 However, he acknowledged that while EU leaders were worried about trying to make the large bloc function, EU citizens were focused on other issues, such as economic security, welfare reform, globalisation, illegal immigration and organised crime.

 There is a different level of debate going on amongst people in Europe that the political leadership in Europe has to address, he said.

 Europes economy is struggling with listless growth and high unemployment in the face of growing competition from developing countries with far lower production costs. 

 What emerges so strongly from the French referendum campaign is this deep, profound, underlying anxiety that people in Europe have about how the economy of Europe ... faces up to the challenges of the modern world, Blair said. Britain is due to take on the rotating EU presidency in July and Blair said he had a particular responsibility to listen to all sides. 

 However, he acknowledged that unless the EU managed to adapt its rules, it would find it hard to govern itself under the existing treaties.

 There is a problem for Europe there, but this other (economic) issue is going to have to be addressed otherwise we will find it hard to get support for the necessary changes in the rules of Europe.

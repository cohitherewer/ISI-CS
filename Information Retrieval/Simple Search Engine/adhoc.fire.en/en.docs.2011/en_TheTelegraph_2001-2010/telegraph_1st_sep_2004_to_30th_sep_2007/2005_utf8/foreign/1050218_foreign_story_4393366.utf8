 Sharon spared, son indicted

 Jerusalem, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Israel?s attorney general decided not to file charges against Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and former aides in a campaign funding scandal but indicted his son today, the justice ministry said.

 Attorney general Menachem Mazuz closed a three-year investigation of Sharon, saying there was insufficient evidence of involvement in setting up shell companies to funnel foreign donations to his 1999 primary campaign. Foreign funding of political campaigns is illegal in Israel.

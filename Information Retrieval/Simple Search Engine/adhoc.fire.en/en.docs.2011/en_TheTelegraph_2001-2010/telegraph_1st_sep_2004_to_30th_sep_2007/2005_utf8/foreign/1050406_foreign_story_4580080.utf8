 French bias row worsens

 Paris, April 5 (Reuters): The French government faced accusations of double standards today over a decision to fly flags at half-mast in honour of Pope John Paul which critics said violated the state?s commitment to secularism.

 What began as a debate among a few Left-wing and Green party politicians spread into the pages of newspapers today, with letters pages filled with the issue. Some also aired complaints about wall-to-wall coverage from Vatican City by French television. France?s many Roman Catholics are united in grief over the Popes death. But the order to fly flags at half-mast for 24 hours was too much for some secular French, especially after most French leaders attended a special mass for the Pontiff.

 Critics accuse the government of hypocrisy by paying tribute to a religious leader after banning Muslim headscarves in state schools to try to ensure strict observance of the 100-year-old official separation of church and state. ?For five days there has been a hagiography about the sovereign Pontiff without any critical spirit,? said Jean-Luc Melenchon, a Socialist senator, renewing an attack on the government which he began on Monday.

 ?We live at a time when we must be very careful about the strict separation between the church and state, especially after adopting a law banning religious symbols in schools.?

 The criticism may at first glance seem of little consequence in a country where surveys suggest about 60 per cent of people are Catholics. Many are grieving for the Pope.

 But President Jacques Chirac and the conservative government are particularly sensitive to any criticism as they try to win back public trust and persuade sceptical voters to approve the EU constitution in a referendum on May 29. 

 ?The media overdose before, during and after the Pope?s death leads me to ask two questions. First, is France 2 (television) still a public service channel?? Charles Bottarelli of Toulon wrote to ?Left-wing newspaper Liberation. ?The second, is the separation between the church and state still in force in our country??

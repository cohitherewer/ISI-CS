 Cairo, May 3 (Reuters): Archaeologists discovered what could be the most finely decorated mummy ever found in Egypt, Zahi Hawass, the head of Egypt?s Supreme Council for Antiquities said today.

 An Egyptian archaeological team led by Hawass, digging near the Saqqara pyramids, found the mummy, which dates back to the 30th Dynasty (380-343 BC), last week.

 ?The sand revealed maybe the most beautiful mummy ever found in Egypt,? Hawass said at the site, 25 km south of Cairo. ?The mummy is so beautiful. The Egyptians drew maybe the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in my life on a mummy,? Hawass added.

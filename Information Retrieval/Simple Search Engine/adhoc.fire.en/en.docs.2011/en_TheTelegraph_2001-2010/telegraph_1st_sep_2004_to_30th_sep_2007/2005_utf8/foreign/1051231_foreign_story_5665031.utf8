 Fear key to quitting smoking

 Houston, Dec. 30 (PTI): Apprehensions of failing to quit smoking might do the magic and help people do away with the habit.

 On an average, most smokers make five to six attempts to quit before they are successful. And relapses occur within the first three months after one stops smoking. One third of relapses occur because of alcohol use, says Patricia Daza, staff psychologist for the Hope programme at the Menninger Clinic.

 If you do relapse, treat it as a bump in the road and not a proof that you cant quit. A more productive approach than quitting cold turkey is to think about tobacco dependence as a chronic disease, and expect that there might be periods of relapse, Daza says.

 An estimated 25 per cent of people in the united states smoke. About half of the 50 million smokers in the us attempt to quit each year, but only five to 10 per cent still dont smoke a year later.

 Dr daza studied smoking cessation before coming to menninger, and counsels patients working on mental health issue who also want to quit. Cigarette smoking is common among psychiatric patients. For patients with schizophrenia, the rate of cigarette smoking can be as high as 88 per cent. The smoking zone is often the busiest area in a psychiatric hospital.

 A key factor with addiction to 

 cigarettes is that not only is there a physiological craving 

 for the tobacco, but there is also a psychological craving 

 for social interaction and camaraderie, dr daza says.

 Sparks fly over French ?bias?

 Paris, April 4 (Reuters): 

 As Catholics mourned the death of Pope John Paul, French 

 Left-wingers and a major teaching union criticised the government 

 today for ordering flags on public buildings to be lowered 

 in a sign of respect.

 Socialist Senator Jean-Luc Melenchon and Yves Contassot, a senior Green party member on the Paris City Council, said the government had abused its powers in ordering the official tribute to the Pope, who died on Saturday.

 The Unsa union said the government was guilty of double standards having ordered schools to take part in the tribute to a religious leader while having banned Muslim headscarves in state schools in a drive to keep schools firmly secular.

 ?Let the Christians pay tribute to the head of their church, it?s a private matter,? Contassot told France Inter radio. ?Today, we have a government and a head of state who, clearly, for political reasons, are trying to take advantage of an issue that is a private matter,? he said.

 Lowering of flags on all state buildings was ?totally out of place and at the limit of legality.? Once so Catholic it was known as the ?elder daughter of the church?, France has imposed a strict separation of church and state for 100 years to keep religion from provoking the bloody strife it sparked in previous centuries.

 While the leaders of most major political parties have avoided comment, the row underscores the unpopular government?s weakness as it struggles to convince hostile voters to back the EU constitution in a referendum next month. Millions of French are Roman Catholics, and there has been a public outpouring of grief over the Pope?s death.

 But Melenchon told Europe 1 radio the state was duty bound to observe a strict neutrality and that the flag tribute was a ?favour awarded to one particular religion.?

 In a statement, the teachers? union Unsa said the order ?to mark the death of a foreign head of state is unusual and constitutionally counter to our principles when it is a question of a representative of a church?.

 Interior minister Dominique de Villepin defended the government?s move, saying the lowering of the flag was one of the ?Republican customs? when a Pope died. ?They have been applied at the occasion of the deaths of Pius XII, John XXIII and John Paul I,? the interior ministry said.

 Whine and get sacked

 New York, Dec. 22 (Reuters): The time-honoured office tradition of whining at the water cooler just might get you fired, according to a newly compiled list of workplace horrors around the world.

 Two workers who exceeded the official limit of two moans per employee at a German firm were fired this year. Several colleagues quit before their moans could be counted. 

 Their employers strict policy tops a list compiled by Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The Chicago-based outplacement firm gave nine examples from hundreds of cases. Most involve petty rules.

 Workers at a DaimlerChrysler plant in Kokomo, Indiana, should drive a Chrysler model or they may find their car in Indianapolis, 50 miles away. Its because a rule limits parking space for non-Chrysler cars. Violators will be towed.

 These are things that make you go hmmm, said James Pedderson of Challenger.

 Such stories pour in throughout the year and Challenger plans to make the list an annual tradition, he said. The point is to encourage managers and their staff to communicate better.

 Some of the worst stories involve discrimination against a workers religion, ethnicity, or, less seriously, squirrels. A librarian lost her job for devoting too much time to saving a squirrel stuck in a ceiling.

 I think reason has to prevail in some of these instances, Pedderson said.

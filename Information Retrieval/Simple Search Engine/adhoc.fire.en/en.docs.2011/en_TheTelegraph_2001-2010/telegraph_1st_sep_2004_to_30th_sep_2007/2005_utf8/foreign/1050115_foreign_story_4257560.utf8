 Income fines

 London, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Britons found guilty of minor crimes, such as driving a car without insurance, could find themselves fined according to their income ? with better-off transgressors facing a bill of up to ?15,000.

 The home office said today the proposed legislation would allow magistrates to set means-tested fines up to a pre-determined limit.

 ?The court would determine an individuals? daily disposable income, after bills and outgoings, which could be multiplied up to a maximum of 200 times,? a home office spokesman said. ?The maximum fine the court could apply would be ?15,000 ? or 200 times the maximum assessement of a daily disposable income of ?75,? he said.

 The home office said no date had been set for the proposed legislation to go before parliament, which it must do before it is enacted into law.

 The type of crimes that would come under the new law would encompass such misdemeanours as riding a bike carelessly to driving a car without a licence.

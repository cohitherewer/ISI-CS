 Election result Iraq certificate: Bush 

 JIM VANDEHEI AND MICHAEL A. FLETCHER

 Washington, Jan. 16: President Bush said the public?s decision to re-elect him was a ratification of his approach to Iraq and that there was no reason to hold any administration official accountable for mistakes or misjudgments in pre-war planning or managing the violent aftermath.

 ?We had an accountability moment, and that?s called the 2004 elections,? Bush said in an interview with The Washington Post. ?The American people listened to different assessments made about what was taking place in Iraq, and they looked at the two candidates, and chose me.?

 With the Iraq elections two weeks away and no signs of the insurgency abating, Bush set no timetable for withdrawing US troops and declined to endorse secretary of state Colin L. Powell?s recent statement that the number of Americans serving in Iraq could be reduced by the year-end. 

 In a wide-ranging, 35-minute interview aboard Air Force One, Bush laid out new details of his second-term plans for both foreign and domestic policy. For the first time, Bush said he will not press senators to pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, the top priority for many social conservative groups. 

 The President?s inaugural speech on Thursday will focus on his vision for spreading democracy around the world, one of his top foreign policy goals for the new term. But it will be Iraq that dominates White House deliberations off stage. 

 In the interview, the President urged Americans to show patience as Iraq moves slowly toward creating a democratic nation where a dictatorship once stood. But the relentless optimism that dominated his speeches before the US election was sometimes replaced by pragmatism and caution.

 ?On a complicated matter such as removing a dictator from power and trying to help achieve democracy, sometimes the unexpected will happen, both good and bad,? he said. 

 A new report released last week by US intelligence agencies warned the war in Iraq has created a training ground for terrorists. Bush called the report ?somewhat speculative? but acknowledged ?this could happen. If we are not diligent and firm, there will be parts of the world that become pockets for terrorists to find safe haven and to train.?

 As for perhaps the most notorious terrorist, Osama bin Laden, the administration has so far been unsuccessful in its attempt to locate the mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Asked why, Bush said, ?Because he?s hiding.? 

 Bush acknowledged that the US? standing has diminished in some parts of the world and said he has asked Condoleezza Rice, his nominee to replace Powell at the state department, to embark on a public diplomacy campaign that ?explains our motives and explains our intentions?.

 Bush acknowledged ?some of the decisions I?ve made up to now have affected our standing in parts of the world,? but predicted most Muslims will eventually see America as a beacon of freedom.

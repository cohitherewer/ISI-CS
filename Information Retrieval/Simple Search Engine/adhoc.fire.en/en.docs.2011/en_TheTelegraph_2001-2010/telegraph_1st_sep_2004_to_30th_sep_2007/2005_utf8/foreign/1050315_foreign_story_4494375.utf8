 SC takes over rape case

 Islamabad, March 14 (Reuters): Pakistan?s top court said today it is taking over a notorious gangrape case that has stirred fierce legal controversy.

 Mukhtaran Mai was gangraped on the orders of a village council nearly three years ago. The anti-terrorism court that first heard the case sentenced four men to death for the rape. A high court in Multan overturned this decision on March 3, acquitting five of the six due to lack of evidence. Last week, the federal shariat court in turn threw out this judgement.The Supreme Court in Islamabad suspended the rulings of both the high court and the Islamic court and said it would hear the case itself, court documents showed.

 Britain foils rail attack

 DAVID BAMBER 

 London, April 17: A poison attack planned by al Qaida-trained operatives was aimed at the busy Heathrow Express rail link and would have been ?our September 11?, Britain?s Metropolitan Police has revealed. 

 A plot to bring death and terror to Britain was disclosed last week after Kamel Bourgass, 32, an Islamic extremist from Algeria, was convicted and jailed for 17 years.

 Senior Whitehall officials have told The Daily Telegraph that Bourgass and some of his associates intended to target the busy rail link between central London and Heathrow Airport. The plan was to place ricin, a fast-acting and potentially lethal home-made poison, on hand rails and in lavatories on the trains.

 Bourgass entered Britain in 2000 using forged documents. He made an asylum claim, which was rejected in 2001 but no attempt was made to force him to leave the country. Whitehall officials say that the authorities found maps of the Heathrow Express route from Paddington station, west London, to the airport, in the home of an associate of Bourgass. They were subsequently told by a second informant that the rail link was the target.

 Senior officials were earlier deliberately vague about the target because they did not want to cause panic or encourage copycat attacks.

 One conspirator, who was arrested in Algeria, had earlier claimed that there was a plot to smear ricin on car doors in the Holloway Road, north London. Officials, however, dismissed this suggestion and said the Heathrow Express was in fact the intended target.

 ?It would have caused chaos and panic in London?s public transport system. Even if it did not kill anyone ? which it could well have done - it would have achieved its purpose,? one official said. ?It was not possible to be specific in court about the target because we do not want to encourage imitators in any way. There were ridiculous stories about attempts to spread poison on the London Underground, but they were not true.?

 A senior officer at Scotland Yard said: ?This was going to be our September 11, our Madrid. There is no doubt about it, if this had come off this would have been one of al Qaida?s biggest strikes.?

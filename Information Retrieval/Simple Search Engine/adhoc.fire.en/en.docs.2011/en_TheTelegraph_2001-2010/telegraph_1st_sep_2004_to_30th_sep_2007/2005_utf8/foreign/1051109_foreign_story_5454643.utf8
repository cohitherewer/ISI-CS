 Chemical arms smear on US

 Rome, Nov. 8 (Reuters): US forces in Iraq have used incendiary white phosphorus against civilians and a firebomb similar to napalm against military targets, Italian state-run broadcaster RAI reported today.

 A RAI documentary showed images of bodies recovered after a November 2004 offensive by US troops on the town of Falluja, which it said proved the use of white phosphorus against men, women and children who were burned to the bone.

 I do know that white phosphorus was used, said Jeff Englehart in the RAI documentary, which identified him as a former soldier.

 The US military says white phosphorus is a conventional weapon. 

 An incendiary device, white phosphorus is used by the military to conceal troop movements with smoke, mark targets or light up combat areas. Its use has been banned.

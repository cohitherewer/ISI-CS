 Help or face action, UN orders Syria

 United Nations, Oct. 31 (Reuters): The UN Security Council voted unanimously today for a resolution demanding Syria cooperate with a UN probe into the death of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri or face possible further action.

 The US, France and Britain sponsored the measure in response to a tough report earlier this month by a UN commission that said Syrian security forces and its Lebanese allies organised the bombing that killed Hariri and 21 others in Beirut on February 14. The report, by German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, who heads the UN probe, also accused Syria of lack of cooperation.

 Some 11 foreign ministers or their deputies among the 15 Security Council members travelled to New York for the meeting, underlying the importance of the vote and negotiated the text until the last minute.

 With our decision today we show that Syria has isolated itself from the international community through its false statements, its support for terrorism, its interference in the affairs of its neighbours and its destabilising behaviour in West Asia, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said.

 The resolution was adopted 15-0 after the principal drafters, the US and France, agreed to delete a specific reference to economic sanctions. Instead the resolution would consider possible unspecified further action if Syria did not comply.

 Russia, China and Algeria had objected to an outright threat of sanctions and might have abstained.

 The measure demands Syria cooperate unconditionally with the UN probe, led by German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, and orders Damascus to take into custody and make available to UN investigators people suspected of involvement in the killing.

 The death of Hariri, an opponent of Syrian domination of his country, transformed Lebanons political landscape. The killing led Syria to pull out its troops from Lebanon after three decades and has put increasing pressure on Lebanons pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud to resign.

 Fine Print

 Church change 

 London, Oct. 19 (Reuters): How many men does it take to change a light bulb in a British church?

 Thanks to the EUs Working at Heights Directive the answer is four ? over three days at a cost of more than ?1,300. Preaching at St Benets Church in Beccles, Suffolk, in gathering gloom, Father Anthony Sutch had to call in electricians to change light bulbs that are 40 feet above the congregation.

 Since the church ceiling was too high for a ladder, scaffolding had to be erected for a costly replacement operation.

 Could Father Sutch have done the job himself? When I was a young monk. I climbed up a ladder to have a look at something and two girls whistled and said what good legs I have. I havent climbed up a ladder since, he told todays Daily Mail.

 Foul fumes

 Singapore (Reuters): It is healthier 

 to walk along a busy road and breathe in exhaust fumes than 

 to sit in the comfort of an airconditioned car, a US researcher 

 said on Wednesday. He said American scientists have found 

 the air inside cars to be more contaminated than the air 

 outside, even in urban areas. This was due to unfiltered 

 air from exhaust fumes and chemical smells from car seats, 

 audio equipment and air fresheners.

 Daring doll

 Caracas, Venezuela (Reuters): Move over Ken and Barbie, the revolution is here. Venezuelas President Hugo Chavez, whom critics accuse of trying to introduce communism in Venezuela, has been modelled into an action doll with his trademark red beret and distinctive mole, according to an online offer. The 51-cm revolutionary doll costs $16 and gives soundbites from the talkative President, according to the offer posted on Internet shopping site MercadoLibre by a seller.

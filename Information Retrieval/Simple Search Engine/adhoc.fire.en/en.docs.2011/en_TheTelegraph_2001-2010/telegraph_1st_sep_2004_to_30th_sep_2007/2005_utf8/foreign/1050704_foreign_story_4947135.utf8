 Fine Print

 Wife winner

Sonkajarvi (Finland), July 3 (Reuters): Estonia reigned supreme 

once again in the wife-carrying world championship on Saturday, as Margo Uusorg 

sprinted home to win the Baltic countrys eighth straight title in the offbeat 

competition.

 Forty couples from 10 countries gathered in the remote Finnish village of Sonkajarvi to complete a 253.5-metre-long obstacle course. A man must carry a woman, not necessarily his spouse, through a pool and across hurdles.

 The few rules require a minimum weight of 49 kg for the wife and state that all contestants must have fun. Uusorg, 25, completed the course in 59 seconds with friend Egle Soll, 23, clinging to his back in the trademark Estonian Carry ? hanging upside down with her legs clenched around his neck. It was his fourth victory, and the third in a row for his family. Brother Madis won in 2004.

 Comic court

 Rome (Reuters): An Italian court has told a 98-year-old 

plaintiff to come back in 2010 for the next hearing in her legal battle over property 

rights ? more than 10 years after the case first opened. Amalia Cuccioletti, who 

was born in 1907, launched the suit against some of her relatives in 1997. An 

initial hearing was held in 2001, but the court in the Italian town of Macerata 

decided to fix the next session for 9:30 am on March 25, 2010.

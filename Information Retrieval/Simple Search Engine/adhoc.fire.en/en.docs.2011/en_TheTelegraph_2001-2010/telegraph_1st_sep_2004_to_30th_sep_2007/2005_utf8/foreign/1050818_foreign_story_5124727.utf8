 Tearful settlers leave Gaza

 Neve Dekalim (Gaza Strip), Aug. 17 (Reuters): Israeli troops dragged settlers screaming and sobbing from homes and synagogues today, beginning a forced evacuation of Gaza settlements after nearly four decades of occupation.

 Thousands of unarmed soldiers marched door to door in six Jewish enclaves, ordering people out and in some cases breaking down doors when they refused. Police grabbed protesters off the streets and pushed them into waiting buses.

 A West Bank settler woman opposed to the pullout set herself on fire at a checkpoint outside the Gaza Strip, suffering burns to 60 per cent of her body. Ultranationalist Israelis see the West Bank and Gaza as land bequeathed to the Jews by God.

 I dont want to. I dont want to, one woman wept as four female soldiers, each grabbing a limb, carried her out of her home in Neve Dekalim, the largest Gaza enclave. 

 In one synagogue, radical youths who had slipped into the main settlement bloc sang the haunting melody some Jews sang on their way to Nazi gas chambers. But elsewhere there were increasing signs of settlers resigning themselves to evacuation as they tearfully hugged soldiers before filing quietly onto buses taking them to Israel. The operation, the culmination of Prime Minister Ariel Sharons plan for the first removal of settlements from land Palestinians want for a state, began after a midnight deadline for the remaining Gaza settlers to leave or face eviction.

 Palestinians watched from nearby rooftops. 

 Sharon, once the settlers champion but now reviled by them as a traitor, voiced sympathy for the evacuees in a televised address. He urged them to blame him alone and not attack troops. I am responsible for this. Attack me, said Sharon, who has billed his plan as disengagement from conflict with the Palestinians.

 But confrontation loomed as forces fanned out among the red-roofed villas of Neve Dekalim, where the hundreds of radical youths were in the synagogue for a possible last stand. When a family of five refused to open their door, soldiers broke it down and carried them out, including a young girl.

 First UAE elections

 Dubai, Dec. 1 (Reuters): The United Arab Emirates, in a step towards political reform, will hold its first elections to its consultative council since the nation was founded in 1971, the Gulf Arab countrys President said today.

 The elections would only elect half of the body and a UAE official said they may be limited to 2,000 voters, as a first step towards wider participation in the future.

 The next stage of our march requires giving a wider role to the Federal National Council (FNC), allowing it to support and guide the executive authority, said President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, quoted by state news agency WAM.

 Although there is no political dissent or Islamist violence in the relatively liberal UAE, it is the only country without elected bodies in the mainly conservative Gulf region after Saudi Arabia held municipal elections earlier this year.

 The UAE, an oil producer and booming trading hub, is a close ally of the US which is leading a drive for democratic reform throughout the Arab world. It is holding talks on a free trade agreement with Washington.

 In light of the changes and reforms our region is witnessing, ... we decided to begin activating the National Council by electing half of its members, Sheikh Khalifa said

 The 40 members of the council have until now been appointed by the seven semi-autonomous emirates that make up the UAE.

 Reformists have called for the council to become an elected parliament with the power to propose laws and discuss public issues without permission from the cabinet. Finally we have the first step. Its a gradualist approach the UAE is opting for. It came a bit late, but better late than never, UAE political analyst Abdul-Khaleq Abdullah said.

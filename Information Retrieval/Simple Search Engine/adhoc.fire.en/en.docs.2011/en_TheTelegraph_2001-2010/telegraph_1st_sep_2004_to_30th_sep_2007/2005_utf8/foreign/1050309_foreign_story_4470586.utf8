 Clinton to undergo surgery

 Washington, March 8 (Reuters): Former President Bill Clinton will undergo a low risk operation to remove scar tissue and fluid from around his heart, his office said today.

 ?President Bill Clinton will be undergoing a medical procedure this week to remove fluid and scar tissue from his left chest cavity,? his office said in a statement.

 ?The procedure, which is a recognised, occasional consequence of open-heart surgery, will take place on Thursday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center and he will remain in the hospital for three to ten days,? it added. Clinton had open-heart surgery last year.

 The White House said he was going ahead with a planned meeting with President George W. Bush to brief him on a trip across Asia to review aid operations following the tsunami disaster.

 The meeting will also include former President George Bush, who went on the Asian trip with Clinton. ?Hes coming to the White House today,? said White House spokesman Scott McClellan.

 ?The risk of the procedure is low, and once fully recovered, President Clinton is expected to resume his work without limitations,? his office said.

 Chocolate that is a sweetheart

 Zurich, April 29 (Reuters): A chocoholic?s dream may be about to come true as Switzerland?s Barry Callebaut develops a range of chocolate said not only to appeal to the tastebuds but also to protect the heart.

 The world?s largest producer of chocolate, Barry Callebaut is seeking out the health-conscious market and plans to offer not only ?guilt-free?, such as no-sugar, ranges but also ?good-for-you? chocolate.

 The company?s secret is polyphenols, a natural ingredient in vegetables and fruit that are plentiful in cocoa beans but are partly destroyed in the process of making chocolate. Polyphenols could prevent cancers and cardiovascular diseases, and tests in rats have already shown they can help improve memory and the ability to learn.

 ?What started this off is the so-called French paradox,? Barry Callebaut?s head of research, Dirk Poelman, said. ?People in the south of France live longer although they drink a lot of red wine.?

 Red wine also contains polyphenols but Poelman said the levels in dark chocolate were double those in red wine, and four times higher than in green tea. That could prove to be the firm?s formula for success.

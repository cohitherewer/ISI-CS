 Deadly error

 Washington, May 15 (Reuters): Newsweek magazine today said it may have erred in a May 9 report that said US interrogators desecrated the Quran at Guantanamo Bay, and apologised to victims of deadly violence sparked by the article.

 The weekly news magazine said in its May 23 edition that the original source of the allegation was not sure where he saw the assertion that at least one copy of the Quran was flushed down a toilet in an attempt to get detainees to talk.

 We regret that we (may have) got any part of our story wrong, and extend our sympathies to victims of the violence and to the US soldiers caught in its midst, Editor Mark Whitaker wrote in the magazines latest issue, due to appear on US newsstands tomorrow.

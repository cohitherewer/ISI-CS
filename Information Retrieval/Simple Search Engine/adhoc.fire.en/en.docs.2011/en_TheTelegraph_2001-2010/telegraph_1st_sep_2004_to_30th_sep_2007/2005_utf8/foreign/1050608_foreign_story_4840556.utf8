 Granny escort

 Philadelphia, June 7 (Reuters): An 80-year-old woman, who uses a walker and an oxygen tank, has been busted for running an escort service from her New Jersey apartment.

 Vera Tursi, who rarely left her low-income apartment in Lindenwold, took phone calls from men who answered her Internet ad for August Playmates listed under Personal Escort Services and other headings for at least six months until her arrest in May, according to police.

 Tursi, who inherited the business from her late daughter, was charged with promoting prostitution, a felony.

 We doubt very much whether she will see jail time, said New Jersey police captain Al Della Fave. She will probably get some type of probation.

 Fishy find

 Melbourne (Reuters): An Australian woman 

 was found to be carrying 51 live tropical fish after custom 

 officials were alerted by flipping noises coming 

 from beneath her skirt as she arrived at Melbourne airport. 

 On closer inspection, officers discovered the woman had 

 strapped on an apron of plastic water-filled bags containing 

 the fish, the Australian Customs Service said in a statement 

 on Tuesday. During the search, customs officers became 

 suspicious after hearing flipping noises coming 

 from the vicinity of her waist, it said. 

 Gay grind

 Rome (Reuters): A Sicilian court condemned road authorities on Monday for suspending the driving licence of a man after finding out he was gay. The court on the Mediterranean island said being gay was merely a personality disturbance which had no bearing on a persons ability to drive, Ansa news agency reported. The 23-year-old man, who was identified as Danilo G, got into trouble with the road licence authorities in the city of Catania after they discovered he had been exempted from military service because he was gay. The authorities suspended his driving licence ahead of further checks on his suitability to take the wheel. 

 Tramp tale

 St Petersburg (Russia), (Reuters): Curators at one of Russias most venerable museums have evicted a tramp who made his home among its priceless collection of antique china and manuscripts. Workers at St Petersburgs 18th century Peter and Paul Fortress discovered the homeless man after a burglar alarm went off on Tuesday morning. We asked him: What are you doing here? and he said: I live here, a museum worker said.

 King Fahds austere end

 Riyadh, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Saudi Arabias King Fahd was buried in a simple unmarked grave today after a brief funeral to mourn the monarch who ruled the oil superpower for more than two turbulent decades.

 In keeping with the kingdoms austere Islamic tradition Fahd, who in life enjoyed enormous wealth and privilege, was laid to rest in a sprawling Riyadh cemetery alongside hundreds of other unidentified dirt graves.

 Fahd died yesterday after 23 years ruling the strategic Gulf state which is both the worlds biggest oil exporter and the cradle of Islam ? drawing more than a billion faithful to turn five times a day toward Mecca in prayer.

 In the Imam Turki bin Abdullah mosque in the capital, Muslim leaders from across the world joined ordinary Saudis to offer condolences to Fahds successor and half-brother Abdullah, and performed Muslim prayers for the dead.

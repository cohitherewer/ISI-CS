 Scandal gathers more Moss

 London, Sept. 28 (Reuters): A documentary is set to show footage of British supermodel Kate Moss which Sky One says shows her snorting cocaine, as the furore over her alleged drug taking which cost her lucrative advertising deals refuses to go away.

 Moss has been embroiled in scandal since The Mirror tabloid printed grainy pictures two weeks ago that apparently showed the 31-year-old taking drugs. Sky One said its documentary: Kate Moss: Fashion Victim? would provide a balanced debate over the role of the media and the fashion industry.

 The documentary aims to paint an honest picture of the landscape that formed the backdrop to the saga and in a worldwide exclusive, features video footage of the widely-reported incident involving Moss and her self-confessed heroin addict boyfriend, Pete Doherty, Sky said.

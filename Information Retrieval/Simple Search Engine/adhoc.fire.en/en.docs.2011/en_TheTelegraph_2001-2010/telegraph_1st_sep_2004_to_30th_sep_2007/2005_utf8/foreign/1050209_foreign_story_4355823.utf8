 Nomination feels good second time too: Swank

 Beverly Hills (California), Feb. 8 (AFP): Oscar-winner Hilary Swank, tipped as a favourite to win the Best Actress award again this year, has said that being nominated felt as good the second time around.

 ?I?m just as in awe and humbled and speechless that I?m in this position again,? said the straight-shooting star, who won the Best Actress award for Boy?s Don?t Cry at the 2000 Oscars, yesterday. ?I?m beside myself.? Swank, who won a nod for her role as a female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, faces a rematch this year with her main rival from the 2000 show, Annette Bening, nominated this year for her role in Being Julia.

 She previously snatched the statuette from Bening, who was nominated for American Beauty five years ago.

 This year, she is leading the pack again following her win on Saturday of the Screen Actor?s Guild?s Best Actress award, seen as a key indicator to the Oscars? acting category wins. Swank sidestepped a question about her thoughts on the criticism that Million Dollar Baby has drawn from disabled rights groups over its assisted suicide storyline.

 ?I don?t take on roles necessarily because they reflect my own opinions or my ideas of life,? she said. ?That?s the great thing about acting. We get to explore so many different ideas and so many different ways of life and expand our own horizons and our own view of the world.?

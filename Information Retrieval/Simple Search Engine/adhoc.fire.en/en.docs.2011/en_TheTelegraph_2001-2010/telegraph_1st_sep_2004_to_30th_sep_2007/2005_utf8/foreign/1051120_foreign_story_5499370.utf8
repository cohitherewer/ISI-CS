 Crowe charges

 New York, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Academy Award-winning actor Russell Crowe pleaded guilty yesterday to reduced misdemeanour charges for hitting a hotel clerk with a telephone in June and was fined $160 and told to stay out of trouble.

 Crowe appeared in court for yesterdays hearing with his wife and admitted to using a phone to assault a hotel employee but said nothing else.

 Shania tale

 Ottawa (AP): Shania Twain received the 

 Order of Canada on Friday, the countrys highest honour. 

 The citation said the Canadian-born singers journey 

 from poverty in a small Ontario town to the pinnacle of 

 the entertainment industry has inspired countless other 

 emerging musicians. I was surprised, and I was very 

 humbled, Twain said. Im not sure its 

 somewhere I belonged. Im not even sure Im quite 

 deserving. 

 Driver care

 Los Angeles (AFP): A Los Angeles taxi driver distinguished himself by his honesty after finding a pouch filled with diamonds worth 350,000 dollars in the back of his cab, police said. At first, Afghan immigrant Haider Sediqi, 40, paid little attention when he found the small brown pouch in the back of his car. But later in the day, Sediqis jaw dropped when he opened the pouch to discover a series of clear plastic boxes filled with a fortune in cut diamonds. The honest cabbie immediately called police and handed over the kings ransom in precious stones.

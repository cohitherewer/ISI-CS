 Mubarak challenger jailed for forgery

 Cairo, Dec. 24 (Reuters): An Egyptian court sentenced Opposition politician and former presidential candidate Ayman Nour to five years in jail on forgery charges today, raising a storm of outrage from liberals and reformers.

 Nour, leader of the liberal Ghad (Tomorrow) Party and the main challenger to President Hosni Mubarak in the September elections, will appeal the sentence, his lawyer said.

 This is a black day for this court... This is injustice, lawyer Amir Salim said.

 Nours wife, Gameela Ismail, who has organised daily protests against the trial, led supporters in chants of Down with Mubarak, Down with the regime.

 A Ghad Party statement blamed the judge, Abdel Salam Gomaa, and noted the same man had found liberal sociologist Saadeddin Ibrahim guilty in 2002 of damaging Egypts reputation abroad.

 Throughout Nours trial, the judge showed a hostile attitude towards Nour and his defence team, denying most of their motions and allowing slander of Ayman Nour, it said.

 The independent Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights said it had doubts about whether the trial had been fair and asked the authorities to free Nour until his appeal is complete.

 Another rights group, Sawasya, said Egyptian justice was clearly selective since no one faces prosecution for the widely documented electoral violations committed during the year.

 Political analyst and reformist Mohamed el-Sayed Said said: Its totally unacceptable and I am confident the ruling was a fraud.

 Nour, 41, has been on hunger strike in jail for two weeks in protest at the trial, which he says is an attempt to remove him from politics. The forgery charges stem from Nours 2004 application to set up the Ghad Party, which required hundreds of signatures of endorsement.

 Nour was detained in January and held for six weeks for questioning on allegations that many of the signatures were forgeries. He repeatedly denied it and said the authorities were trying to disrupt his campaign for the presidency.

 Nour won about 8 per cent of the popular vote in the presidential elections, second to Mubarak with 89 per cent, but he and all other Ghad Party MPs lost their seats in the legislature in November and December.

 US troubled

 The US called on Egypt today to release Nour, saying his conviction cast doubt on the countrys commitment to democratic reform.

 White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the US was deeply troubled that the court sentenced Nour to five years in jail.

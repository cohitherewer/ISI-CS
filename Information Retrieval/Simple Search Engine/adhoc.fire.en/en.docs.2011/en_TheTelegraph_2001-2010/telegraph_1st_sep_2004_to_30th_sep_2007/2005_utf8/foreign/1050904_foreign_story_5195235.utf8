 Bjork upstages Ford in Venice

 Venice, Sept. 3: The crazy world of Bjork proved to be so outrageous at the Venice Film Festival yesterday that she upstaged an appearance by Harrison Ford holding the hand of Calista Flockhart.

 The Hollywood stars, a romantic item for some years now, were in Italy for the unveiling of Fragile, a horror film featuring the former Ally McBeal actor.

 However, they were virtually ignored by the paparazzi, while the Icelandic singer took the event by storm with her new movie, a 135-minute epic shot in Japan in which she stars with a vast vat filled with thousands of gallons of Vaseline.

 As an over-the-top experimental 

 picture, it even made Ang Lees daring new movie Brokeback 

 Mountain look tame, despite the appearance of Heath 

 Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall as gay Wyoming cowboys. 

 Bjork, in scarlet high-heeled boots and a pink dress, arrived in Venice with her boyfriend, Matthew Barney. She said: I happen to be an emotional person. Its been hard work, and I dont know whats going to happen with the film. Its kind of scary, but I love it.

 Drawing Restraint 9 follows Bjorks appearance in the cult director Lars von Triers film Dancer In The Dark. But the new picture is far more weird.

 It emanated from the imagination of Barney, a San Francisco-born artist, who hired the mothership of the Japanese whaling fleet, the Nisshin Maru, to sail in Nagasaki Bay with a huge steel basin on deck.

 Sailors spent hours filling the basin with Vaseline poured in through hosepipes. According to the script, the idea was to use the petroleum jelly to show the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity by transforming it into a vast sculpture, called The Field, which is moulded, poured, bisected and reformed on the ship over the course of the film.

 With the jelly congealing, cracking and moving with the sea, the movie tracks the descent of form into states of sensual surrender and formal atrophy.

 But many critics attending the film festival were baffled, and at a press screening the sound of seats flipping up as viewers left the cinema began early. Some lasted for 90 minutes, watching the tedious process of Bjork and Barney, identified as The Guests, arriving on the vessel and being dressed as a Shinto couple in mammal fur costumes by geisha girls. It was all so slow ? with virtually no dialogue, but some soothing background sounds and songs ? that the odd snore could be heard in the air-conditioned cinema. 

 At a media conference, one Italian journalist said that she had been so moved that I want to watch it over and over again. However, others were less enthusiastic.

 Bjork was immensely upbeat about the film, with Barney, the subject of a recent Guggenheim retrospective in New York, equally wrapped up in what the producers described as his hermetic vision.

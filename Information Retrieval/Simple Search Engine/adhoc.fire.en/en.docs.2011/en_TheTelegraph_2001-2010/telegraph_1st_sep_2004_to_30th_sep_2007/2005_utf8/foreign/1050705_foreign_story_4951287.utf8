 Collision angers Russian

 Moscow, July 4 (Reuters): A Russian astrologist who says Nasa has altered her horoscope by crashing a spacecraft into a comet is suing the US space agency for damages of $300 million, local media reported today.

 Nasa deliberately crashed its probe, named Deep Impact, into the Tempel 1 comet to unleash a spray of material formed billions of years ago which scientists hope will shed new light on the composition of the solar system.

 It is obvious that elements of the comets orbit, and correspondingly the ephemeris, will change after the explosion, which interferes with my astrology work and distorts my horoscope, Izvestia daily quoted astrologist Marina Bai as saying in legal documents submitted before todays collision.

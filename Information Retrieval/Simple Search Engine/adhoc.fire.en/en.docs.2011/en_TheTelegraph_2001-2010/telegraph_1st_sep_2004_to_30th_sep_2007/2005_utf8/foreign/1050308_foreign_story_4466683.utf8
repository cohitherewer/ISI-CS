 Segregate plan in UK schools

 NEIL TWEEDIE

 London, March 7: The head of the body charged with ensuring racial equality in Britain has suggested that black boys should sometimes be taught separately from white children in order to improve their school performance.

 Trevor Phillips, the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said the measure could soon become necessary because of the continuing poor performance of male black pupils in GCSE examinations. But his comments are likely to be condemned by some as endorsing a form of segregation.

 Speaking in a BBC documentary, Phillips, who is black, said many black boys suffered from a culture in which being clever was regarded as unfashionable. Many also suffered from a lack of positive role models and self-esteem. ?If the only way to break through the wall of attitude that surrounds black boys is to teach them separately for some subjects, then we should be ready for that,? he said.

 Phillips also suggested banning black fathers from seeing their sons if they failed to turn up at school parents? evenings.

 ?A tough new strategy would compel black fathers to be responsible fathers,? he added. ?If they can?t be bothered to turn up for parents? evening, should they expect automatic access to their sons?? 

 Figures published last month showed black teenagers continued to trail far behind their white classmates in regard to GCSE results ? although there were signs that the gap was narrowing. Last year, only 35.7 per cent of black Caribbean pupils in England scored at least five C-grades at GCSE, compared with a national average of 51.9 per cent.

 As part of the BBC1 programme Inside Out, Phillips returned to his old school in north London, to gain a better understanding of the problem. He went on: ?We need more male black teachers, tempting them with extra cash if necessary. I was one of the few lucky ones who escaped the fate of most black men of my generation. We need to embrace some new if unpalatable ideas both at home and at school. None of us, least of all the next generation of black children, can afford a repeat of the last 40 years.?

 Phillips said he had been inspired by a project in the southern United States, where black boys had been taught English in isolation from other pupils.

 Nasa mulls repair walk

 Houston, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Nasa was deciding today whether it needed another spacewalk to make shuttle Discovery safe for its return to Earth as its crew finished transferring cargo to and from the International Space Station.

 The astronauts were loading up the station with as much food, water and other supplies as they could. Discovery was the first shuttle to visit since the 2003 Columbia disaster and another may not come for some time. Nasa has grounded the shuttle fleet until it figures out how to stop insulation foam from the spacecrafts external fuel tank from coming loose at launch.

 Astronauts Steve Robinson and Soichi Noguchi have performed three spacewalks, including a landmark walk yesterday to remove loose cloth strips protruding from Discoverys belly. 

 Nasa was deciding whether to send the spacewalkers out again on Saturday to repair a tear in an insulating blanket that protects tiles near the commanders window. They worry that a small piece of the blanket could tear off and strike the spacecraft when Discovery re-enters the atmosphere.

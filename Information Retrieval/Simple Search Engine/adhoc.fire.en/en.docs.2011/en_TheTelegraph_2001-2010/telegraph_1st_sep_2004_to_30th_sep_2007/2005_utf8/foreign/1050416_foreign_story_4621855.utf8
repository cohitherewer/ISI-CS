 Fine Print

 Testy success

 Seoul, April 15 (Reuters): The motto for one would-be South Korean driver likely is ?if at first you don?t succeed, then try, try again another 271 times?.

 Seo Sang-moon passed the academic part of his driver?s licence examination on his 272nd attempt earlier this week.

 The repairman, from a small town in the southeastern part of the county who will soon turn 70, said he was illiterate and used the test process to teach himself the rules of the road because he could not read them in a manual.

 Since the oral exam was launched, Seo took the test as often as he could, paying about $1,000 in fees along the way. Each failure taught him a little more, and after 271 attempts, he was able to get the minimum score needed to pass the academic test.

 Seo said he was preparing for his road test, and was discussing with his wife what kind of car to buy once he get his licence.

 New Singer

 New York (AP): The Wedding Singer, 

 that celluloid celebration of the 1980s starring Adam Sandler 

 and Drew Barrymore, has been transformed into a Broadway 

 musical and booked for a New York opening ? for April 2006. 

 No casting has been announced for the stage version of the 

 show, which centres on a young man, Robbie Hart, played 

 in the movie by Sandler, who sings in a wedding band and 

 has been jilted by his fiancee. Despite the setback, Robbie 

 still pines for the perfect girl.

 Racist ice

 Stockholm (Reuters): A Swedish rights group cried foul over advertisements for a liquorice ice-cream, saying the posters for ?Nogger Black? were racist. Not only could the name of the ice-cream bar made by GB Glace cause offence, but the posters, with graffiti-style text, lampooned black culture, the Centre Against Racism said. ?The GB Glace company may not be racist, but the ads they use give new life to racist stereotypes,? the campaigning group said in a statement. GB Glace said it did not believe the ice-cream, nor its advertising, was racist. 

 Brothel tax

 San Franciso (Reuters): Nevada lawmakers 

 are considering a bill that would tax the state?s 28 legal 

 brothels, the only regulated bordellos in the US. The brothels 

 pay local taxes and licence fees but have never been taxed 

 by the state, which under the bill would impose a 10 percent 

 tax on drinks and food and collect a $2 fee on each customer.

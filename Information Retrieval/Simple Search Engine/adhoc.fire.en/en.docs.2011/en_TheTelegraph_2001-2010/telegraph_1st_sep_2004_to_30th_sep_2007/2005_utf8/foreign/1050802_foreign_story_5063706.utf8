 Baby deaths

 Berlin, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Police in Germany have discovered the bones of nine newborn babies buried in flower pots and buckets, and arrested a woman believed to be their mother on suspicion of killing them, authorities said today.

 The remains, buried in sand and earth at a site in the eastern state of Brandenburg, were recovered yesterday after a witness who had been clearing a garage there found human bones stored in a fish tank, a police spokesman said.

 We are assuming there are at least nine corpses, said Michael Neff of the Frankfurt an der Oder state prosecutors office. Police arrested a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of killing the babies immediately after they were born.

 Tentena (Indonesia), May 28 (Reuters): Two bombs ripped through a busy market in a Christian town in eastern Indonesia today, killing up to 21 people in an attack likely to raise fears that sectarian bloodshed could again break out in the region.

 The explosions left a trail of blood and destruction in the lakeside town of Tentena, on the eastern island of Sulawesi, part of an area where three years of Muslim-Christian clashes killed 2,000 people until a peace deal was agreed in late 2001.

 Periodic unrest has flared since, but this mornings attack was among the worst. Tensions rose after the bombings, with hundreds of residents converging on the local hospital and destroyed an outdoor market, demanding that the police find the killers.

 The official Antara news agency, quoting local government officials, said the death toll was 21. Police earlier said it was 19.

 A local hospital official said 32 people were wounded, many seriously. One toddler was among the dead.

 Crowds of people banged their hands on the local police chiefs car when he arrived on the scene soon after the attacks, but there was no violence. The situation is getting tense, Andi Asikin, the mayor of Poso town not far from Tentena, told El Shinta radio station.

 People are upset because their families are victims. Crowds of people who are relatives of the victims are condemning the act. They are demanding officials hunt the perpetrators.

 Police on the scene said the bombs comprised high explosives, adding that the blasts could be heard 12 km away. The second explosion came 15 minutes after the first, and was the bigger of the two, residents said.

 The roofs of shops near the market were torn off and food and goods scattered over a wide area in Tentena, 1,500 km northeast of Jakarta. Windows in a police station were blown out.

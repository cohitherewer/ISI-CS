 Italy overhaul

 Rome, April 23 (Reuters): Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi resolved a bruising row with his coalition partners today and named a new government tasked with reviving the sluggish economy ahead of next year?s general election.

 The cabinet was sworn in at a swift ceremony at the Quirinale presidential palace that stood in stark contrast to 2001 when Berlusconi?s initial team took the oath of office amidst much backslapping and applause. 

 Centre-Left Opposition politicians said the new government, put together in just three days, was a carbon copy of the old administration and would be incapable of confronting the economic and social problems besieging Italy. But coalition allies said the cabinet represented a break with the past, and promised that it would focus its efforts on boosting industry, increasing employment in the poorer south and protecting the purchasing power of Italian families. Today?s overhaul saw the appointment of new health, communications, industry and culture ministers. It also marked a return to front line politics for Berlusconis long time ally, Giulio Tremonti, who was named deputy Prime Minister 10 months after being ousted as economy minister.

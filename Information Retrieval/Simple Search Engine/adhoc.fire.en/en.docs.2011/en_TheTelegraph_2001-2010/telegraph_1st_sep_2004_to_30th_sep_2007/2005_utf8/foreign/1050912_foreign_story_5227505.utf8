 Minnelli back in limelight at Toronto

 Toronto, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Some stars are wandering through the Toronto Film Festival virtually unnoticed but one woman who is grabbing attention and affection is a singer/actor/dancer once written off as a Hollywood has-been.

 Liza Minnelli is in Toronto to promote a remastered version of Bob Fosses 1972 television special starring her, Liza with a Z. The film features a stunning array of dance numbers, from the raucous Son of a Preacher Man to the spare elegance of Bye Bye Blackbird and hits from Cabaret.

 The show premiered on Friday night at the festival, winning a prolonged standing ovation from a packed house.

 In an interview yesterday, Minnelli said she was bloody grateful to the films producers for bringing the project to the screen. 

 Asked if this was a comeback year for her, what with an upcoming movie ? The OH in Ohio ? and a part in the TV series Arrested Development, the heavily made-up Minnelli bristles. If you sit down for 20 minutes in this business now its a comeback, the 59-year-old daughter of Judy Garland said, noting that she is currently on tour.

 Id say Im a woman whos learned a lot and is looking forward to learning more, she added. Bitter is so boring.

 Venice award

 Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain, a tale of homosexual love in the mountains of Wyoming, won Venices Golden Lion on Saturday, beating film festival favourite George Clooney in the race to take the top prize.

 The latest movie by the director of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hulk is adapted from a story by Annie Proulx and stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as love-struck cowboys whose forbidden affair begins in 1963 and ends 20 years later.

 Clooney, adored in Venice, did not go home empty-handed, winning an award for best screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov.

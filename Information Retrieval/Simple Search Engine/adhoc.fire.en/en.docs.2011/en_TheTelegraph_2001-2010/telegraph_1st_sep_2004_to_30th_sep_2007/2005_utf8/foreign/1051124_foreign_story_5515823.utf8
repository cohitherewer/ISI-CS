 Pentagon plans Iraq troops cut in 2006

 BRADLEY GRAHAM AND ROBIN WRIGHT

 Washington, Nov. 23: Barring any major surprises in Iraq, the Pentagon tentatively plans to reduce the number of US forces there early next year by as many as three combat brigades, from 18 now, but to keep at least one brigade on call in Kuwait in case more troops are needed quickly, several senior military officers said.

 Pentagon authorities also have set a series of decision points during 2006 to consider further force cuts that, under a moderately optimistic scenario, would drop the total number of troops from more than 150,000 now to fewer than 100,000, including 10 combat brigades, by the end of the year, the officers said.

 Despite an intensified congressional debate about a withdrawal timetable after last weeks call by Representative John P. Murtha for a quick pullout, administration officials say that military and political factors heavily constrain how fast US forces should leave. They cite a continuing need to assist Iraqs fledgling security forces, ensure establishment of a permanent government, suppress the insurgency and reduce the potential for civil war.

 US military commanders, too, continue to favour a gradual, phased reduction, saying that too rapid a departure would sacrifice strategic gains made over the past 30 months and provide a propaganda windfall to insurgents.

 Lieutenant General John R. Vines, the senior tactical commander in Iraq, indicated to reporters at the Pentagon yesterday that his staff had looked at shrinking US force levels more quickly. But he made his opposition to such a move clear.

 A precipitous pullout, I believe, would be destabilising, Vines said from Baghdad.

 Another senior general likened an accelerated withdrawal to taking the training wheels off of a bike too early, warning that a sudden removal of all US troops would risk the collapse of Iraqs fledgling security forces. 

 He and several other officers privy to the planning for force reductions said the process has not been affected by the mounting political pressure in the US.

 The current number of US forces in Iraq represents an increase of more than 15,000 troops over a base level this year of about 138,000, including 17 combat brigades. The equivalent of another brigades worth of combat power was added this autumn to bolster security for the October 15 constitutional referendum and the coming December 15 vote on a new national government.

 Defence secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld spoke over the weekend of plans to bring the force level back down to 138,000 after the elections, effectively removing the extra brigade equivalent added for the election period.

 In addition, officers said, two combat brigades that had been slated to move into Iraq to replace units coming out are now expected to be held back.

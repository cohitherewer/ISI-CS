Baghdad, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Saddam Hussein argued with the judge and complained about Iraqs occupiers when his trial for crimes against humanity reconvened in Baghdad today with the prosecution presenting the first witness testimony.

 But after less than three hours of hearings, including videotaped testimony from a witness who has since died, the judge ordered a week-long adjournment to allow one of the eight defendants to secure legal representation.

 Saddam, dressed in a white shirt, dark jacket and carrying a Quran, arrived late for todays session, only the second of the trial, which opened on October 19 only to be adjourned for 40 days. They brought me here to the door and I was handcuffed. They cannot bring in the defendant in handcuffs, Saddam said when Amin asked him to explain his lateness. Amin ordered Saddam and his seven co-defendants to be unshackled by their guards before they entered the courtroom.

 Saddam said he had to walk up four flights of stairs because of a broken elevator in the heavily fortified courthouse. I will tell the police about this, Judge Amin told him in the cool, polite tone he maintained during several tirades by the former president on the first day of the trial. I dont want you to tell them, I want you to order them, Saddam replied hotly.

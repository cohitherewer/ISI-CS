 Charles wedding getting verse

 London, March 21: Who would be Poet Laureate at a moment like this?

 While the country waits for Andrew Motion, the incumbent, to deliver his Olympian thoughts on the forthcoming royal wedding, fellow poets reveal today just how awkward is the task that he faces.

 Four poets commissioned by The Daily Telegraph to write verses for the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles next month found much to lament, poke fun at or to be loftily indifferent about.

 The four who took on the job were: Pam Ayres, comic poet/priestess to middle England; Attila the Stockbroker (real name: John Bain), a punk poet for 25 years and poet-in-residence to Brighton and Hove Albion football club; Hamish Robinson, poet-in-residence at the Wordsworth Trust, a charity dedicated to a previous Poet Laureate; and Todd Swift, the Canadian poet-in-residence for Oxfam.

 For more than 300 years, appointed royal poets have commemorated great national occasions such as weddings, funerals and battles.

 Motion?s next task may be doubly difficult for him because before becoming poet laureate he poured his heart and soul into a poem, Mythology, in praise of Diana, Princess of Wales, soon after her death.

 His verse included the lines: Diana, breathless, hunted by/ Your own quick hounds and he wrote of her life as not your own to keep/ Or lose.

 The poet laureate could also draw inspiration from one predecessor, Lord Alfred Tennyson, who snatched glory from the jaws of tragedy in his laureate poem The Charge of the Light Brigade.

 Pam Ayres said yesterday that she could not bring herself to write more than a terse four-line poem because she felt sadness at the tragedies and traumas that Princes William and Harry had had to suffer.

 She said: ?It is written with them in mind. In my heart I can?t believe that they don?t mind about this wedding.

 ?It may have been less nightmarish for them if Parker Bowles had stayed with her first husband.

 ?I have been a great admirer of the Royal Family and I?ve got an MBE but I cannot feel glad about this marriage. I look at the preparations with dejection.? She added: ?I cannot think of a worse task for the poet laureate. This must be a particularly difficult one for him to write. He will have to tread a very fine line.?

 Attila the Stockbroker, a staunch republican, said his rhyming couplets were inspired by Hilaire Belloc and The Clash. ?I am totally bored by the Royal Family,? he said (The Clash used to be a punk rock band and Hilaire Belloc was a French writer).

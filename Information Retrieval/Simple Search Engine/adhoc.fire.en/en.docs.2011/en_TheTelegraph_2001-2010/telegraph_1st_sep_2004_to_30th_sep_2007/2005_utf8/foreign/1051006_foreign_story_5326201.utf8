 Bali balm and blow from prison

 Denpasar (Indonesia), Oct. 5: The spiritual head of Jemaah Islamiyah, the terror group blamed for the weekends suicide bombings in Bali, condemned the attacks yesterday from his prison cell.

 But Abu Bakar Bashir, who is serving a 30-month sentence for conspiracy linked to the 2002 Bali bombs, also said victims of Saturdays outrage should accept this fate from Allah.

 Jemaah Islamiyah, which has been linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network, seeks to establish a caliphate across southeast Asia.

 I really disapprove of bombings in non-conflict areas for whatever reason, including in Bali, because it can be almost certain that innocent and unknowing victims would fall, Bashir said in a statement released by his lawyer.

 He added that he was particularly saddened if the victims included people whose religion is Islam.

 I suggest the government bring themselves closer to Allah by implementing his rules and laws because these happenings are warnings from Allah for all of us, he added.

 A total of 19 people were killed in co-ordinated suicide bombings of three restaurants on the tourist island of Bali at the weekend, along with the three bombers.

 Bashir, who could have been sentenced to death had he been convicted on all the charges he faced at trial, has condemned other attacks blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah since he was arrested.

 But another of the men convicted of the 2002 attacks, which killed more than 200 people, said the latest bombings were similar. Who else if not the group of Dr Azahari? said Ali Imron, referring to Azahari Husin, one of Indonesias two most wanted men and Jemaah Islamiyahs top bomb-maker.

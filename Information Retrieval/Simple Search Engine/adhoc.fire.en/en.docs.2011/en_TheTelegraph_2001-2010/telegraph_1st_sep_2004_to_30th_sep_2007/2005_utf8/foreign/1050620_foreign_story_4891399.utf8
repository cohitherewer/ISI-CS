 Revolutions heir, now critic

 COLIN FREEMAN 

 Zahra Eshraghi

 Tehran, June 19: She may be the granddaughter of the Islamic revolution, but Zahra Eshraghi worries about work-life balance like any modern woman. Almost 30 years after her grandfather, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, wrote the constitution that condemned Irans women to a life of veiled drudgery, she wants it changed to recognise her twin roles as dutiful wife and politician.

 I work hard during the day, but when I come home at 5 pm I am a mother of two children, she said in her first interview with a British newspaper.

 Our constitution still says that the man is the boss and the woman is a loyal wife who sacrifices herself for her family. But society here has changed, especially in the last 10 years. If my grandfather were here now, I am sure he would have had very different ideas.

 Recasting Khomeini as a feminist rather than firebrand Islamist is not the only aspect of his legacy that Eshraghi, 41, wants to dismantle. A leading light in Irans reformist movement, she also seeks an end to compulsory headscarves for women, a general curbing of the mullahs power and the right to have stood in the presidential elections last Friday ? expected to be the closest fought since the 1979 revolution.

 The constitution my grandfather approved says that only a man can be president, said Eshraghi. We would like to change the wording from man to anyone.

 But discrimination here is not just in the constitution. As a woman, if I want to get a passport to leave the country, have surgery, even to breathe almost, I must have permission from my husband.

 Eshraghi is just one of many Iranians with impeccable credentials questioning the regime. Her husband, Mohammad Reza Khatami, is a former teenage revolutionary whose group stormed the American embassy in 1980 and held its diplomats hostage for 444 days. Today, Khatami is the running-mate of Mostapha Moin, the leading reformist candidate in the election. 

 Yet the fact that the former aristocracy of Irans revolution is now its critic reflects as much a nostalgia for Khomeinis regime as disillusionment.

 Like many Iranians, Eshraghi insists her grandfather was a misunderstood man whose mission was corrupted. He loved freedom and liberty; that was why he came here in the first place. I believe many of the people who surrounded him, his apostles, had very frozen minds. They were the decision-makers.

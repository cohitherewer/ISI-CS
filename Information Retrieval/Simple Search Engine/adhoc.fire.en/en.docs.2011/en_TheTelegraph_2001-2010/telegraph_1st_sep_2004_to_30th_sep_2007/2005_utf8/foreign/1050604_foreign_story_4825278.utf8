 Dead babies

 Vienna, June 3 (Reuters): 

 The bodies of four babies have been found at a house in 

 Austria ? two in a freezer, one in a bucket of concrete 

 and another in a nearby shed ? police said today.

 Police in the southeastern city of Graz said the children had died around birth and the cause of death was unclear. A 32-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of killing them but had said she did not know what happened, police added.

 She says she was in such a state that she simply doesnt know what she did, the head of Graz criminal police, Anton Lehr, said. We assume that these are her children but we need it in black and white with DNA, etc, Lehr said. He said police were searching for more bodies.

 The woman said the children were born one to one and a half years apart and that the most recently born died roughly two years ago, Lehr added. Her statement is that the first child (that was found) died two years ago, but we dont have any forensic results, Lehr said, adding that she said the first one found was the last born. A 38-year-old man, identified as the womans boyfriend, was arrested on suspicion of murder, he said. The woman said her boyfriend had not noticed that she was pregnant, Lehr added.

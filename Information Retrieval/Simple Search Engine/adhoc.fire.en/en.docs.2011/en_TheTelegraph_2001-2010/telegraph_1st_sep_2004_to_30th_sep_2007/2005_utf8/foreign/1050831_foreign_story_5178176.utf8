 Fine Print

 Feline thief

 Berlin, Aug. 30 (Reuters): German police called to a break-in at an apartment in the northern town of Itzstedt found the intruder still on the premises and hiding under a kitchen cabinet.

 The cat burglar had somehow crawled into the ground-floor of the apartment, broken window blinds, torn down drapes and trashed furniture.

 Police also found fish and fish remains from a broken aquarium scattered around the apartment, said Julika Reinhardt, spokesman for the police in the town north of Hamburg.

 Reinhardt said the cat, wearing a name tag, was returned to its owner who would have to pay for the damage.

 Heavy rule 

 Berlin (Reuters): A German court has 

 ruled that Mercedes must release a man from a car lease 

 deal after a dispute over whether he was too heavy to drive 

 the luxury vehicle, Bild newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 Mercedes refused to release the insurance salesman, who 

 weighs 160 kg, from a lease agreement on his S-320 CDI model, 

 arguing the multiple car breakdowns caused by his weight 

 were insufficient grounds to break the deal. But the Stuttgart 

 court ruled in favour of the salesman, named only as Frank 

 S, apparently on the grounds that the car should have been 

 able to take his weight. 

 Zoo fears

 Budapest (Reuters): A Hungarian zoo says it will reduce the number of large animals it holds and restock with smaller ones because it fears that zoo effluent could pollute a local spring, the state news agency MTI said on Monday. The zoo in the southwestern city of Pecs was responding to a prediction by environmentalists that animal dung and droppings would pollute a spring that provides drinking water to the city of 160,000, zoo director Tibor Pinter said.

 Glen fame

 Nashville, Tennessee (Reuters): Glen 

 Campbell, the group Alabama and pioneering black Grand Ole 

 Opry musician DeFord Bailey will become the newest members 

 of the Country Music Hall of Fame, said the Country Music 

 Association, or CMA, on Monday. Their formal induction will 

 take place on November 15 during the 39th Annual CMA Awards 

 show from Madison Square Garden, New York. The Arkansas-born 

 Campbell, whose signature tune was Rhinestone Cowboy, 

 toured with the Beach Boys in 1964 and 1965 before hitting 

 it big with Gentle On My Mind and By the Time 

 I Get to Phoenix.

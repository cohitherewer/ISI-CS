 Fresh bird flu outbreak in China

 Beijing, Oct. 19 (AFP): China today announced its first reported outbreak of bird flu in more than two months, saying the disease had killed 2,600 birds, mostly chickens, on a farm in its northern Inner Mongolia region.

 Most of the dead poultry are chickens, said a government official surnamed Zhao from Saihan district where the outbreak has taken place. He said it was a small farm with less than 10,000 birds, mainly chickens, geese and peacocks.

 The National Bird Flu Laboratory confirmed that an epidemic on a farm near the Inner Mongolian capital of Hohhot was the H5N1 strain which is potentially lethal to humans, the Xinhua news agency reported.

 In China, the most recent confirmed case was near Lhasa in August, in which 133 birds died. 

 Romania tests

 A British laboratory has detected a second outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus in Romania, agriculture minister Gheorghe Flutur said today.

 Tests had found the strain in samples taken last week from the village of Maliuc in the Danube delta. Russia has also confirmed that the flu outbreak has spread westwards to around 200 km south of Moscow

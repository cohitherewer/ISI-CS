 Death cloud on Saddam 

 Baghdad, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein will go on trial on October 19 on a charge of mass killing, Iraqs government spokesman confirmed today, raising the possibility that he could soon be hanged.

 There is a date set for October 19, Laith Kubba told a news conference, adding that several of Saddams associates, including one of his half-brothers, would face trial with him.

 They will be tried for the execution of 143 citizens.

 Kubba was referring to reprisals for an assassination attempt on Saddam in the Shia Muslim village of Dujail in 1982, after which over 140 men from the village were killed.

 Iraqs Shia-led government has reintroduced the death penalty after it was suspended following the US invasion in March 2003. 

 On Thursday, three convicted criminals were hanged, the first since the suspension was lifted.

 Saddam faces execution if found guilty.

 Stressing that he was voicing a personal opinion, Kubba said that if Saddam were convicted for the Dujail killings, trials for other crimes might be shelved and the sentence carried out quickly.

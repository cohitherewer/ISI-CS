 Hamas sweeps Gaza polls, blow to Abbas

 Gaza, Jan. 28 (Reuters): Hamas swept seven out of 10 councils in first-ever Gaza Strip local elections seen as a test of strength between the Islamic militant group and new President Mahmoud Abbas, final results showed today.

 The Islamists, sworn to destroying Israel, had boycotted a January 9 presidential election won by Abbas on a platform of ending violence to allow talks with the Jewish state on Palestinian statehood.

 ?Hamas? victory proves Islam is the solution,? blared a slogan from loudspeakers as thousands of supporters celebrated in the streets beneath fluttering green Hamas flags.

 Abbas has been trying to win a ceasefire from Hamas and other militants spearheading a four-year-old revolt to allow the resumption of talks with Israel and to avoid chaos in Gaza ahead of an Israeli plan to abandon the occupied territory.

 ?Our people have a consensus on the choice of jihad and resistance and the election has underscored that concept,? Hamas spokesman Muhir al-Masri said.

 Candidates from the Hamas list won 75 of the 118 council seats compared to 39 for members of Abbas? Fatah movement and their allies, final figures from the electoral commission showed.

 But while the results were a blow to Fatah, they also raise the prospect that Hamas will join parliamentary elections in July and thereby shift closer to the political mainstream.

 Voter turnout topped 80 per cent ? much higher than at the presidential election for a successor to Yasser Arafat.

 Local government minister Jamal al-Shobaki, a Fatah member, said the high turnout showed that ?Palestinian people understand that democracy and elections are the start to the end of occupation.?

 Hamas, which has killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings, has won many hearts in Gaza not only for its role in the fighting but also for charities that help the needy in the absence of support from the crumbling Palestinian authority.

 Hamas made a strong showing in municipal elections in the West Bank last month and the group had been expected to do even better in Gaza, where 1.4 million Palestinians live in often dire poverty.

 Political analysts say that by taking part in the municipal elections, Hamas is also demonstrating its claim to a share of power ahead of Israel?s planned withdrawal of Jewish settlers from Gaza.

 Guinness sets record for work dispute

 JESSICA BERRY

 London, April 3: A proposal for a romantic novel about an American girl working in London for Guinness World Records has become an event worthy of entry itself in the book, as the record for the strangest bust-up between a worker and her employers.

 Jerramy Fine, a 27-year-old from Colorado, was hired to adjudicate over unusual claims for Guinness, such as the world?s biggest hug (899 people), the longest penis extension (3 inches) and how many naked people can fit in a roller coaster (81).

 Fine, who was once called ?the future of Guinness? by her former boss, decided to fictionalise her life in a novel. HarperCollins bought the proposal, which it called ?heart-warming?.

 The next day, however, she was suspended by HIT Entertainment, the owner of Guinness World Records, after it saw a leaked copy of the book. Six weeks later she was sacked for alleged breach of contract.

 Fine, who is taking her case to an industrial tribunal, said she was summoned to a meeting with the head of personnel and the head of the legal department. ?On the table there was a copy of my proposal and a covering letter from my agent. They asked me strange questions like: ?Does the name HarperCollins mean anything to you?? and ?Did you write this??

 ?One sentence in the proposal ran: ?Friday morning pasties were changed to bagels. This was the biggest scandal to hit the office in years.? They countered that this ?belittles what we do in the office on a daily basis and is very detrimental.?

 ?They also were upset about an anecdote I had about the longest penis extension. They told me that I could have chosen something ?more wholesome, like the 100 metre dash?. This is all coming from a company that is promoting salacious records such as how many naked people can fit into a roller coaster.?

 She said that her employers also complained about other items she had written about. ?They were also upset because I wrote about a drunken staff party held at Gleneagles Hotel in the summer of 2001. They said it breached confidentiality, yet the story was reported at the time in News of the World.? 

 At the end of the meeting, Fine was suspended. After a disciplinary hearing, however, she was dismissed and told that the company objected to the overall content of her proposed novel and that it breached confidentiality.

 Succour for victims, business for donors

 Bite of life: A tsunami survivor eats a biscuit.

 Bangkok, Jan. 9 (Reuters): As aid rushes in to Asia?s tsunami survivors, makers of essentials such as biscuits and medicine are cranking up production, ensuring part of the billions of dollars pledged to help victims will stay in the coffers of rich donor countries. Aid agencies say they need to feed two million people and shelter up to five million whose lives were wrecked by the tsunami on December 26 that devastated parts of Asia and has led governments and agencies to pledge more than $5 billion in aid.

 Agencies are scrambling to get special food and drinking water to Indonesia?s remote Aceh province, far flung islands in the Maldives and Sri Lanka?s battered east coast, and are grateful for any company that can deliver within hours. ?Obviously, high-protein biscuits are humanitarian; you don?t have them with your cup of tea,? said Sandie Blanchet, a spokeswoman for UNICEF in Denmark, where the UN children?s agency has a warehouse the size of three football pitches.

 ?There is such a thing as a humanitarian business, but it?s good because these companies are used to emergencies.?

 Nutriset, a French company with 40 staff set up 16 years ago by a food engineer, is completely geared towards disasters. It called staff back from holiday to boost production of its mineral-enriched peanut paste called ?plumpynut? and zinc tablets to combat diarrhoea. UN agencies are sending both products to tsunami-hit communities.

 ?We shouldn?t blush at the fact that we?re a private company. Obviously we do make profit, otherwise we?d go down, but most is invested in research,? said Beatrice Sinkins, who is in charge of developing Nutriset?s zinc tablets.

 ?No pharmaceutical companies were developing products like the zinc tablets because they didn?t think they were profitable enough,? she said. ?But I suppose they might be interested now.?

 UNICEF spent just over $700 million in 2003 on procurement, up 30 per cent from the previous year, and uses around 700 companies ? two thirds of which are in developed countries. In 2003, its top suppliers by value of orders were Belgium followed by France, India, Italy, Denmark, Japan, the US, Britain, Germany and Kenya.

 Aid agencies say they strive to buy more from countries hit by disasters, but sometimes the specialist products are available only in the West.

 ?We definitely say that the standard best practice is that all agencies involved should source locally as much as possible,? said a spokeswoman at Oxfam in London. ?It?s better for the local economy and reaches people much sooner.?

 Japanese stock investors seem to believe some of their government?s generosity will end up in domestic bank accounts. On Thursday, while Japan was pledging $500 million for relief efforts at a tsunami conference in Jakarta, shares in engineering consultancy Nippon Koei Co. soared nearly 20 per cent.

 Japanese firm Tetra Co which makes wave-breaking concrete blocks, has jumped 30 per cent since the tsunami.

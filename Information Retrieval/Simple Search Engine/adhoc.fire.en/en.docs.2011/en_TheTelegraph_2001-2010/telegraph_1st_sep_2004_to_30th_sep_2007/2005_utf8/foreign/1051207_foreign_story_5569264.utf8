 Pak ire over Bush poem

 Islamabad, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Pakistan has ordered that a poem in which the first letters of each line spell out the name President George W. Bush be deleted from a school textbook.

 The education ministry said the poem The Leader was unacceptable as it had been downloaded from the Internet and was anonymous. A ministry statement seen today accused those responsible for compiling the English textbook of oversight and negligence and warned them to be more careful in future.

 The move came after local newspapers published the poem on their front pages and called it an embarrassment for President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally of Bush in his global war on terrorism.

 Wed amp; emigrate ring busted

 AMIT ROY

 London, Jan. 18: Police in Leicestershire have smashed one of the UK?s biggest immigration rackets in which 26 people were jailed for their part in smuggling Indians into Britain through a system of bogus marriages.

 Although over the years, British consular staff in India (and Pakistan), accused of being racist, have become sensitive in handling visa applications, their work is being undone by ruthless gangs who make big money by people trafficking.

 Leicester is a city where Asians make up a quarter of the 280,000 population. It has two MPs of Indian origin, many councillors, thousands of successful Asian businesses and reasonably harmonious race relations. 

 But the tale which emerged at Leicester Crown Court reveals the dark underbelly of the Asian community.

 Many commentators will feel that the judge has been remarkably lenient. Such cases provide valuable ammunition to the Right-wing parties who argue that illegal immigration into Britain is out of control.

 Four members of a family were part of the scam. They included Zainab Patas, her brother Ibrahim Hafeji, and their mother and stepfather, who were involved in the bulk of the 42 bogus marriages.

 The scam involved Indian men and women marrying British citizens of Indian origin, which gave them the right to enter Britain.

 Patas, now 22, was said to have taken part in six bogus weddings ? the first when she was 16 ? with the approval of her mother, Zahida Amujee. She was jailed for three years. Her brother, aged 20, got 12 months. Zahida, 43, took part in two weddings herself. She was given 32 months and a severe reprimand from the judge.

 Asian families being what they are, all the proceeds of crime went to the stepfather, Abdul Samad Amujee, 56, who was jailed for one year, for taking part in one wedding.

 The ringleaders were named as Salim Mullan, 50, of Osborne Road, Leicester, and 66-year-old Ibrahim Umarji, of East Avenue, East Ham, London, who were both jailed for four years each after pleading guilty to conspiring to arrange illegal entry into the UK.

 Since Asians like to keep businesses within the family, Mullan?s wife, Jahara, also got involved and received 18 months. She had a couple of nice bank accounts, with a total of ?80,0000.

 Nineteen other people were also sentenced receiving punishment ranging from suspended prison terms to three-year sentences. Clients offered between ?8,000 and ?10,000 for a wedding, which would take place in either Leicester, Bolton, London or Mumbai.

 Judge Hammond said: ?Clearly this was a well-planned and sophisticated operation involving recruitment of stooges in this country. Some were flown to India and there was substantial funding. ?

 Fourteen of the defendants jailed were women, many single mothers who had been put under financial stress or were pressurised by the ringleaders to go through with the bogus ceremonies.

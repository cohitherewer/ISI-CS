 50 Maoists die in clash 

 - 500 held at protest rallies

 Kathmandu, April 8 (Reuters): Nepali soldiers killed at least 50 Maoist rebels in a deadly overnight clash, the army said today, as around 500 political activists were reported arrested by police during pro-democracy rallies in the kingdom.

 The Nepali army said its troops killed the rebels after the insurgents attacked their base overnight using rocket launchers and mortars in the west of the nation in one of the deadliest battles in the past two months.

 An army statement said many more, possibly hundreds of Maoists, could have died in the fighting and soldiers had recovered 31 weapons, including AK-47 assault rifles.

 ?On the basis of the situation at the site of the clash and on the version of local people, it is understood that hundreds of terrorists have died,? it said. ?Only 50 bodies have been recovered so far.?

 These figures could not be independently verified and the Maoists have not commented on the latest fighting. The rebels frequently carry their casualties with them to keep their morale high.

 Nine soldiers were wounded at the base in Khara in Rukum district, 550 km west of Kathmandu, three of them critically.

 The latest assault by the Maoists ? who want to overthrow the monarchy and establish a communist republic ? comes after an attack five weeks ago in which the army said its forces had killed at least 50 rebels in the western Bardiya district. Four soldiers also died in that clash.

 The new violence came as police in Kathmandu arrested about 50 political activists, including some former ministers, who were demonstrating against King Gyanendra?s move on February 1 to declare emergency, sack the multi-party government and seize power.

 ?Down with the proclamation of emergency. Long live democracy,? some protesters shouted before being dragged away by helmeted policemen.

 Around 450 more activists were arrested in pro-democracy gatherings elsewhere in Nepal. In the eastern towns of Janakpur, Sarlahi and Mahottari, dozens of activists were injured after police used batons to break up protests.

 In Kathmandu pro-democracy protesters were quickly arrested, bundled into iron-meshed vans by police and driven away.

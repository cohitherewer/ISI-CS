 Police identify Pak attacker

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 28: Pakistan law enforcement agencies have released a photograph of the suspected suicide bomber who blew himself up at the Bari Imam shrine in Islamabad yesterday killing 19 people and wounding 70.

 In the photograph, which was shown on local TV channels today, the man is in his mid-20s and has a small beard. 

 Yesterday evening, the police had recovered the decapitated head of the bomber from the shrine with his face still intact. 

 The blast ripped through the Shia religious gathering at the conclusion of the annual Urs of Bari Imam, a 17th century Sufi teacher who is also Islamabads patron saint.

 President Pervez Musharraf has ordered a high-profile police team to investigate the incident that comes less than ten days after Islamic clerics issued a decree against suicide bombing in Pakistan calling it un-Islamic.

 We have taken the head of the attacker in our custody for DNA tests, interior minister Shehzad Wasim said in Islamabad today.

 Wasim also hoped to find the men who had planned the bombing and said that the investigation was already moving in the right direction.

 President Musharraf appealed to all Pakistanis to stand up against extremism. 

 They should stop if they see anyone trying to incite hatred, publish and spread hate material or misuse the mosque for provoking hatred, he said in Karachi.

 Yesterday, the president had said that his government would continue taking stringent measures to deal with the menaces of extremism, sectarianism and terrorism.

 Security has been beefed up in and around all religious sites across the country after yesterdays explosion.

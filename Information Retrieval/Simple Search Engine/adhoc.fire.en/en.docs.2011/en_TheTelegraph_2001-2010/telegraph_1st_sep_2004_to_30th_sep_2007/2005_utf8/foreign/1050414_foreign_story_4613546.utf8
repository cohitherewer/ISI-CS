 Blair goes to poll war with economic shield

 London, April 13 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair today unveiled the policies that will underpin his bid to make British political history by winning a third straight term for his centre-left Labour party.

 At the heart of Labour?s campaign for next months election is a pledge to preserve economic stability ? the factor Blair hopes will offset widespread discontent over the Iraq war.

 In a bulky manifesto, Labour also promised to lead economic reform in Europe, keep up pressure on Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programmes, and lamented violence in Iraq.

 ?We mourn the loss of life of innocent civilians and coalition forces in the war in Iraq and the subsequent terrorism. But the butchery of Saddam is over,? it said.

 ?Many people disagreed with the action we took ... We respect and understand their views. But we should all now unite to support the fledgling democracy in Iraq.?

 Polls show Labour on course to win the May 5 poll. A new survey by MORI today gave Blair a four-point lead.

 He and finance minister Gordon Brown, his most likely successor, have put aside years of on-off feuding to campaign together. Blair has promised Brown will keep his job if Labour wins, in a bid to entrench economic stability.

 ?We will never return to the stop-go of the past,? Blair, who has pledged to serve a third term but not seek a fourth, told a news conference.

 But Labour?s emphasis on the economy was undermined by figures showing the largest rise in unemployment claimants in two years and a protest outside Blair?s office by the families of workers at collapsed car firm MG Rover.

 Labour?s manifesto reset an inflation target of 2 per cent, which the Bank of England must tailor interest rates to meet.

 A commitment not to raise rates of income tax ? key to Blair?s 1997 and 2001 election wins ? was repeated but without a broader promise not to hike any taxes at all.

 Economists say the government?s spending plans mean higher taxes at some point after the vote, an analysis Brown denies.

 ?There?s one thing you can be certain of. If Blair gets in again, taxes will go up again,? opposition Conservative leader Michael Howard said.

 By promising a referendum on the European Union constitution next year, Blair has neutered Europe as an election issue.

 Polls suggest he faces an uphill struggle to convince sceptical Britons although the manifesto said Blair will campaign ?wholeheartedly? for a ?Yes? vote. If the pro-European Premier lost, political insiders say it may hasten his exit and make it impossible to pursue the even more controversial topic of euro entry for years.

 Far Pavilions bombed out

 AMIT ROY

 London, Aug. 19: The London bombings have claimed their first casualty in the West End ? The Far Pavilions, based on the 1,000-page novel by M.M. Kaye.

 The musicals closure was announced tonight by the shows producer, Michael Ward, who took seven years to bring the ?4.5-million project to the 1,300-seat Shaftesbury Theatre. Takings were down by 25 per cent as a result of the security scares, he said.

 The musical, which began previews on March 24 this year, will have its last performance on September 17.

 The story revolves round a young boy, Ashok, who is suddenly told he is not Indian at all but English and returns after a military education in England to India, the land of his birth, but this time as a British officer, Ashton Pelham-Martyn. He falls in love with Princess Anjuli, whom he had known when they were children.

 Its ironic that of all the shows in the West End, this should be the first casualty of the bombings on July 7 and 21, Ward pointed out. This is a show that celebrates the cultural diversity and the multiculturalism of London and the country at large. At its heart, it deals with the question of identity, which British Asians have to deal with. I am very proud that a third of our audience has been British Asian.

 Ward said it was never easy to fill such a large theatre, especially after mixed reviews. However, after favourable word of mouth, a third of the audience was beginning to come from outside London and the producers felt confident enough to extend the booking period until January 2006.

 The cast took it very well when I broke the news yesterday after which they performed both the matinee and the evening shows, he said. We are hoping to redevelop the show and take on tour both in Britain and abroad, with a smaller cast, and also turn it into a film.

 Kaye was born in India and took 15 years to complete the novel, which was published in 1978. The backdrop, which was meticulously researched, includes the 1857 first war of independence and the two Afghan wars but the core of the novel deals with an Englishman who is the opposite of what is termed a coconut in todays slang. Ashton Pelham-Martyn is white on the outside, brown inside, which gets him into trouble with his fellow British officers but brings him close to his Indian servants and soldiers.

 Kaye worked closely with Ward, who was also born in India, during the musicals preparatory phase but died in January last year, aged 95. In her honour, a seat was kept empty on first night. Ward explained how difficult it had been to carry on with the losses. We were able to go on thanks to the generosity of our backers but finally we had to take a decision (to close).

 Molly Kayes family and literary executors have been very understanding and supportive. The Far Pavilions will live again.

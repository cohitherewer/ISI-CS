 Spain royals

 Madrid, May 8 (Reuters): Princess Letizia, 

 the future Queen of Spain, is pregnant with her first child 

 who will be born in November, the royal palace said today.

 A glamourous former television presenter, Letizia Ortiz, 32, married Crown Prince Felipe, 37, on May 22 last year, and news of a pregnancy has been eagerly awaited in Spain. ?The Prince and Princess of Asturias are delighted to announce they are expecting the birth of their first child next November,? the palace said in a brief statement. ?Their Majesties the King and Queen wish to express their great happiness at this joyful announcement.?

 Felipe, tall, dark and blue-eyed, married elegant divorcee Ortiz in a fairytale wedding that symbolised a new dawn for Spain just over two months after the March 11 Madrid train bombings. At the official announcement of his engagement, Felipe was asked how many children he wanted. ?Well, we cant say with complete certainty. The intention is perhaps more than two and fewer than five,? he answered, to the apparent astonishment of his fiancee.

 Harry at Sandhurst

 London (Reuters): Prince Harry arrived at the prestigious and notoriously tough Sandhurst military academy on Sunday to begin his army career with a warning from his superiors that he will be treated like any other cadet. The 20-year-old was accompanied by his father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, as he enrolled at the college south-west of London. British bookmakers were already taking bets that the young prince would not complete the 44-week course. ?I am really excited,? Harry said in a statement issued by his fathers office, Clarence House. ?I want to get on with it and do the best job I can do.? The first five weeks of the course are notoriously tough, with cadets up at dawn and unable to leave the site.

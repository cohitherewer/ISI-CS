 Black baby abortion slur irks Bush

 Washington, Oct. 1 (Reuters): The White House today criticised as not appropriate a comment from former education secretary William Bennett that aborting black babies would reduce the US crime rate.

 Bennett, a conservative radio commentator, stirred outrage for saying on his talk show on Wednesday: But I do know that its true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could, if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down.

 That would be an impossibly ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down, he said on his call-in programme Morning in America. Asked for President George W. Bushs reaction to the remarks, spokesman Scott McClellan said: The President believes the comments were not appropriate.

 Bennett has not served in Bushs Cabinet, but has held various senior roles in the administrations of Bushs father and President Ronald Reagan. He is a former education secretary and head of US drug policy.

 Rumsfeld twin quit offers

 Washington, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld said yesterday he twice offered his resignation to President George W. Bush over the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, but both times was asked to stay in the job.

 Photographs of US personnel sexually humiliating and physically abusing prisoners at the jail on the outskirts of Baghdad surfaced last April, triggering global condemnation.

 ?I submitted my resignation to President Bush twice during that period and told him that... I felt that he ought to make the decision as to whether or not I stayed on. And he made that decision and said he did want me to stay on,? Rumsfeld said.

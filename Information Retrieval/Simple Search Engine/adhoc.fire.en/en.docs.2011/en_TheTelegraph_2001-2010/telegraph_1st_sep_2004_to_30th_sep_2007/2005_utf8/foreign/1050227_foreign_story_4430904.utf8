 Castro skips cigar fest, Irons steals the show

 Havana, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Cuban President Fidel Castro snubbed hundreds of cigar aficionados by skipping a gala dinner closing the annual Habanos festival last night, and British actor Jeremy Irons took his place as the star attraction.

 ?As I get older, and I see the years ahead of me getting shorter, I try to live a better quality of life. I think in the years to come I will smoke less cigarettes and more cigars,? Irons told the diners as waiters handed out trays of Partagas Coronas.

 It was the third year in a row that Castro, 78 and recovering from a broken knee, has been a no-show at the dinner for worldwide cigar lovers and retailers of Habanos cigars, an incongruous meeting of the well-heeled and Communist Cuba.

 ?I think it is a huge disappointment for everybody,? said Hong Kong businessman David Tang, the main distributor of Cuban cigars in Asia.

 Tang said Castro had a ?magnetic? presence at previous dinners, where the Cuban leader would go on stage to sign humidors filled with cigars that were then auctioned to wealthy buyers for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

 Cigar aficionados paying $1,400 to attend the five-day Habanos festival felt let down, because they had been told Castro would attend the dinner, dedicated to the 160th anniversary of the legendary Cuban cigar brand Partagas.

 ?I?m disappointed. This is small change,? Jimmy Ng, manager of the The Cigar Divan in Singapore, said of the five-day event. Ng said he had brought thousands of dollars to buy rare cigars for rich clients, but there were no mature cigars on sale, just recently rolled ones. 

 ?The festival needs a new attraction instead of Fidel,? said a Spanish investment broker. Britain?s Duke of Marlborough and the Duchess of Westminster, visiting Cuba for the cigar festival, left the island before the gala dinner. 

 But Irons stole the show with a plug for cigars. ?Smoking a cigarette is like having sex, and smoking a cigar is like making love,? the actor said.

 Fine Print

 Amazon on song

 Seattle, July 17 (Reuters): Online retailer Amazon.com celebrated its 10th year with a concert yesterday for its employees and customers that included a rare joint performance by Bob Dylan and Norah Jones.

 The free concert for over 2,500 employees in Seattle, which was also broadcast over the Web, was aimed at showcasing Amazons success at becoming the Internets biggest retailer, unlike other unlucky companies that died along with the bursting of the technology bubble five years ago. 

 No limits

 Ottawa (Reuters): A Canadian teenager 

 caught driving at almost twice the speed limit told police 

 he had overdosed on a protein drink and was desperately 

 looking for a washroom, the Ottawa Citizen reported. 

 Hayder Mobaraks tale did not impress a judge, who 

 gave him a whopping $760 fine and banned him from driving 

 for 30 days. Mobarak was clocked doing 195 km per hour on 

 a road where the limit was 100 km/h.

 Shed-flab bonus

 Chicago, Jan. 31 (Reuters): The owner of a Michigan company who forced his employees to either quit smoking or quit their jobs said today he also wants to tell fat workers to lose weight.

 A ban on tobacco use ? whether at home or at the workplace ? led four employees to quit their jobs last week at Okemos, Michigan-based Weyco Inc., which handles insurance claims. The workers refused to take a mandatory urine test demanded of Weyco?s 200 employees by founder and sole owner Howard Weyers, a demand that he said was perfectly legal. ?If you don?t want to take the test, you can leave,? Weyers said. ?I?m not controlling their lives; they have a choice whether they want to work here.? 

 Also a health concern: overweight workers. ?We have to work on eating habits and getting people to exercise. But if you?re obese, you?re (legally) protected,? Weyers said. He has brought in an eating disorder therapist to speak to workers, provided eating coaches, created a point system for employees to earn health-related $100 bonuses and plans to offer $45 vouchers for health club memberships.

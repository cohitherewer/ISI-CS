 Cameras combed for blast clues

 London, July 10 (AFP): Londons streets, stations and Underground stops are filmed by a dense surveillance camera network which could reveal vital clues in the hunt for the perpetrators of Thursdays attacks which killed at least 50 people and left 700 wounded in the city.

 For some years, the British capital has been rigged up with one of the worlds most comprehensive closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems that have allowed police to track and snare countless criminals.

 Just after Thursdays blasts, investigators seized thousands of video tapes and digital recordings which are currently being ploughed through frame by frame.

 Theres a large number of CCTV tapes were going to take and examine, said Andy Hayman, Londons Metropolitan police assistant commissioner of specialist operations.

 Met deputy assistant commissioner Brian Paddick added: Weve had considerable success in the past using CCTV footage to trace the movements of people implicated in criminal activity. That will be one of our first priorities.

 With around 1,400 cameras, including several high definition cameras, installed in the Undergrounds tunnels and platforms, some 8,000 on board buses and thousands on the streets, there is every chance one or more of those behind Thursdays attacks on London transport will be caught on camera.

 According to a recent university study, which estimated a total of seven million CCTV cameras in Britain, each Londoner is filmed 300 times per day on average.

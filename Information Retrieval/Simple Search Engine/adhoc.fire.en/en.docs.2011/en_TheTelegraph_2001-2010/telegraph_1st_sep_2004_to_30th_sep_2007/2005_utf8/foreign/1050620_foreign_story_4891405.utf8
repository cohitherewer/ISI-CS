 Laden lair? Ask CIA boss

Washington, June 19 (Reuters): CIA director 

Porter Goss said he has an excellent idea where Osama bin Laden is 

hiding, but the al Qaida leader will not be brought to justice until weak links 

in counterterrorism efforts are strengthened, Time magazine reported today.

 In his first interview since becoming head of the CIA last year, Goss also told the magazine the insurgency in Iraq was not quite in its last throes, but close to it.

 Goss did not say where he believed bin Laden was hiding, but intelligence experts have said the al Qaida leader who has evaded an extensive US-led manhunt is probably in the border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

 I have an excellent idea of where he is. Whats the next question? Goss said in the interview.

 In the chain that you need to successfully wrap up the war on terror, we have some weak links. And I find that until we strengthen all the links, were probably not going to be able to bring Mr. bin Laden to justice, Goss said. We are making very good progress on it.

 He cited some of the difficulties as dealing with sanctuaries in sovereign states, youre dealing with a problem of our sense of international obligation, fair play. Goss added, We have to find a way to work in a conventional world in unconventional ways that are acceptable to the international community.

 Al Qaida could strike the US again, he said. Certainly the intent is very high. And we are trying to stay ahead of their capability. And so far, I think we have done pretty well carrying the war to them, as it were, Goss said.

 Bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, sporadically release taped messages that have been broadcast on Arab television or on the Internet since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Intelligence experts say the messages are partly to reassure followers that the leaders are still alive.

 In the most recent message, a videotape broadcast by Arabic television Al Jazeera on Friday, Zawahri said reform in Muslim countries and expelling the invaders could not be accomplished except by fighting.

 Vice-President Dick Cheney has said the insurgency was in the last throes. President George W. Bush says it would be wrong to set a timetable for withdrawing US forces from Iraq and they will stay until local security forces are trained to take over.

 Goss said, I think theyre not quite in the last throes, but I think they are very close to it. And I think that every day that goes by in Iraq where they have their own government and its moving forward reinforces just how radical (the insurgents) are and how unwanted they are.

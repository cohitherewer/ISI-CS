 Sex writer plans TV series on Lipstick

 Candace Bushnell

 New York, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Sex and the City author Candace Bushnell is in talks to turn her new book Lipstick Jungle, the story of three successful career women in New York, into a television series.

 I havent signed any deals yet but theres a lot of interest, Bushnell said. Nothings been finalised but hopefully it will be in the next couple of weeks.

 In an interview ahead of the September 6 publication of her latest novel, Bushnell said it was too early to discuss who might play the three main characters ? a film producer, a fashion designer and a magazine executive.

 HBOs Emmy-winning Sex and the City, the TV series about the love lives of four single women in New York, ended in 2004 but reruns still feature heavily on US cable stations. Bushnell said Lipstick Jungle was a pretty philosophical kind of book about what happens when women like the thirty-something women of Sex and the City get into their forties and experience real success in their careers.

 I see it more as a TV show than a movie, Bushnell said. One of the things thats really hard with movies these days is that its almost impossible to have forty-something women.

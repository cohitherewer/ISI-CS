 Skiers caught in avalanche

 Salt Lake City, Jan. 15 (Reuters): A number of skiers were believed caught in an avalanche yesterday in an out of bounds area near Park City, Utah, an official said.

 ?We have recovered no bodies. We believe now there are multiple victims,? Summit county sheriff Dave Edmunds said.

 The 300-metre avalanche came down in an ungroomed area near a resort known as The Canyons. ?If you go outside the boundaries of any ski resort you are on your own,? the sheriff said. He held out little hope that the skiers or snowboarders would be found safe.

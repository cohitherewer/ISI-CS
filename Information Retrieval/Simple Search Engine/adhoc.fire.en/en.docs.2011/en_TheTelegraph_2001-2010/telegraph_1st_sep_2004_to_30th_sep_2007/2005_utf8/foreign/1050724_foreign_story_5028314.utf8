 Botched attack left bagful of clues

 JOHN STEELE

 London, July 23: In contrast to the carnage of the four bombings on July 7, where investigators are sifting through hundreds of dustbins of debris for clues, Thursdays aborted terror attacks yielded many text book forensic clues.

 Police have four rucksacks ? three from Tube trains and one from a bus in Hackney. Three bags contained home-made chemical explosive devices similar to those used on July 7. One is smaller and in a plastic sandwich box. Detectives believe that there is evidence of detonation in three of the bombs, where the explosive mix did not go off. There was no evidence of detonation in the fourth. 

 They are treating at least one, and possibly all, of the incidents as suspected suicide bombing missions which failed for some reason, causing the bombers to flee leaving behind their explosives. 

 At the Oval a bomb was left in a carriage on northbound Northern line train. Another was left in a carriage at Warren Street on a northbound Victorian line train.

 At Shepherds Bush a device was left on a Hammersmith and City line train heading westbound, while the fourth device was left at the rear of the top deck on a No 26 bus going from Waterloo to Hackney Wick, east London. 

 The chemical in Thursdays bombs was said to bear similarities to explosives found in a house in Leeds and in the boot of a car in Luton after the July 7 bombings, which killed 56 people. This led officers to suspect a link between the two sets of attacks, though experts have still to ascertain why Thursdays bombs did not explode. 

 Another reason for suspecting a link is the geography of the attacks, which like the July 7 bombings took place in locations north, south, east and west of central London.

 A comment on a website linked to an offshoot of al Qaida threatens that London will burn in its four quarters. A further similarity between the two sets of attacks is the use of rucksacks, a similar method of delivery of the bombs.

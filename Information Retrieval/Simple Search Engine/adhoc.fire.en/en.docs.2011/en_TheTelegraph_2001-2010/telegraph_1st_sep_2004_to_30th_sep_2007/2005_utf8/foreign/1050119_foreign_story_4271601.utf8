 More on mobile

 Tokyo, Jan. 18 (AFP): Japanese high-tech giant Toshiba said today it has developed the world?s first software to enable users to operate their computers remotely via mobile phones.

 Existing mobile phone services only allow users to view files in their computers but not edit them, Toshiba said.

 Toshiba plans to make the system commercially available by the end of March for third-generation mobile phone services.

 UN envoy in Nepal appeal 

 Kathmandu, July 15 (Reuters): A top UN official called on Nepals King Gyanendra today to restore democracy quickly, his parting shot after a five-day visit to a nation he said was facing a very serious crisis.

 The comments by Lakhdar Brahimi came a day after Gyanendra appointed a dozen more loyalists to his council of ministers, a move that analysts said could widen the rift between the monarch and the political parties.

 Brahimi, secretary-general Kofi Annans special adviser, is the most senior UN official to visit Nepal since Gyanendra plunged the nation into crisis when he fired the government, seized power and suspended democracy on February 1. One does not need to tell the people of Nepal that they are facing a very serious crisis, Brahimi said.

 A solution is needed urgently. That solution rests on a return to constitutional order and multi-party democracy (and) an end to hostilities.

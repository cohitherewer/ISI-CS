 Officials clash as Big Easy residents get ready to return

 New Orleans, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Federal and local authorities clashed today over whether New Orleans was ready for residents to return, putting in doubt efforts to quickly resettle the devastated city.

 Coast Guard Vice Adm. Thad Allen, head of the federal recovery efforts in New Orleans, said the city lacked most basic services ? such as drinkable water, sewage and electricity. Its protective levees remained vulnerable, and the city lacked a plan to respond to any new emergency.

 Tens of thousands of New Orleans residents ravaged by Hurricane Katrina nearly three weeks ago remain housed in temporary shelters across the US, with many poised to return home when officials permit.

 Mayor Ray Nagin has been encouraging many to return this week, but Allen said he was far more cautious after consulting the heads of the Environmental Protection Administration and the Centers for Disease Control.

 If you bring significant amounts of people into New Orleans, you need an evacuation plan, Allen said during a round of TV appearances today. It also needed safe water to drink, working telephones, and a storm-warning system.

 The announcement to move the re-population ahead of any of those completed tasks in our view puts the city at risk, he said. 

 But Nagin has strenuously defended his call for many citizens to return, saying reoccupying the city was vital to New Orleans revival. We believe our re-entry plan properly balances safety concerns and the needs of our citizens to begin rebuilding their lives, Nagin said yesterday.

 Despite Nagins invitation, there were few signs people were rushing to get back into the Big Easy.

 State homeland security officials said the relief effort was improving, after weeks of chaos. What were more focused on is continuing to get the aid and necessary supplies to those in need, said Mark Smith, spokesperson for the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.

 Despite those fears, Nagin has asked business owners in the historic French Quarter, the downtown business district and parts of the Uptown neighbourhoods to return to the city.

 Saturday night, many lights were back on downtown and in the French Quarter as electricity was restored in some sections. If youre here for the next Mardi Gras, youd never think there was a hurricane. The streets will be full again, vowed Chellie Smith, who owns four bars in the French Quarter.

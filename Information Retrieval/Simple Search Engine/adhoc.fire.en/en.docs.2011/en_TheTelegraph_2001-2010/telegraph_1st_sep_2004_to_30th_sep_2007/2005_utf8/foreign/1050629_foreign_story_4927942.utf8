 US delays Nepal arms

 J. HEMANTH

 Donald A. Camp

 Kathmandu, June 28: Visiting US principal deputy assistant secretary for South Asian affairs Donald A. Camp today said the Bush administration will insist on restoration of democracy as a pre-condition for resuming arms supplies to the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA). 

 Speaking at the end of a three-day official visit to Nepal, Camp said the US was monitoring the situation in Nepal very closely. 

 The entire world will find the return to a pre-1990 Nepal unacceptable. The king and the legitimate political forces will have to unite to deal with the Maoist insurgency successfully, he said.

 Camp added that the US would continue to provide non-lethal aid to the RNA as it felt the Maoists were the most immediate threat to a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Nepal.

 However, the US would hold back the next consignment of M-16 rifles till King Gyanendra restored civil liberties and multi-party democracy in the kingdom. 

 The US recognises the difficulties the army faces in countering the insurgents. The US military assistance aims to make the Royal Nepalese Army professional and includes training in rules of engagement, investigating alleged human rights abuses and battlefield medical skills.

 As for the Maoists, Camp said that they should realise they cannot win an armed struggle. We call upon them to cease their systematic targeting of the Nepalese people, including schoolchildren and civilians, declare a ceasefire, lay down arms and come to peaceful negotiations, he said.

 The American official said the Bush administration was being guided by inputs from New Delhi to structure its Nepal policy. However, he expressed concern over reports that the Maoists were meeting leaders from Indian political parties.

 Camp also reiterated the US stand that King Gyanendras February 1 takeover was a big step backward for democracy. He hoped that political parties would continue to cooperate with each other and force the King to restore democracy.

 US carries out 1000th execution

 Kenneth Lee Boyd

 Raleigh (North Carolina), Dec. 2 (Reuters): Double murderer Kenneth Lee Boyd became the 1,000th prisoner executed in the US since the reinstatement of capital punishment when he was put to death by lethal injection today.

 God bless everybody in here, Boyd said in his last words to witnesses separated from his death chamber by a double-paned glass partition.

 Boyd, who was 57, died at 0715 GMT at Central Prison in North Carolinas state capital, Raleigh, a spokeswoman said. 

 Boyd, a Vietnam war veteran with a history of alcohol abuse, was sentenced to death for the murder in 1988 of his wife and father-in-law committed in front of two of his children.

 Boyds lawyer Thomas Maher said the execution had not made the world better or safer. Boyd was wheeled into the death chamber strapped down on a gurney and injected with a fatal mix of three drugs.

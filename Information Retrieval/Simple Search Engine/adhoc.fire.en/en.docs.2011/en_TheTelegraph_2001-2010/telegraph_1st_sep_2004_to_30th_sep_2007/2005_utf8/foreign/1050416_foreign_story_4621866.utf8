 Dane queen in anti-Islam stand

 HANNAH CLEAVER 

 Berlin, April 15: Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has called on the country ?to show our opposition to Islam?, regardless of the opprobium such a stance provokes abroad.

 Her comments further undermined the image of Denmark as a liberal haven for those seeking a new life in northern Europe.

 The Danish government has already been accused of fuelling xenophobia by introducing measures which effectively closed the country to asylum seekers. But in overtly political passages from an official biography published yesterday Queen Margrethe makes comments certain to complicate her nation?s relationship with Muslims.

 She said: ?We are being challenged by Islam these years ? globally as well as locally. It is a challenge we have to take seriously. We have let this issue float about for too long because we are tolerant and lazy. 

 ?We have to show our opposition to Islam and we have to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on us because there are some things for which we should display no tolerance.?

 Spit-kit trap

 London, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Britains much abused and derided traffic wardens have a new weapon in their struggle with irate car drivers ? DNA evidence.

 British car-parking firm NCP is to issue DNA spit kits to its staff after a man who spat at a traffic warden pleaded guilty to assault when his saliva was identified.

 NCP, which manages off-street parking for various local authorities, began a trial of the spit kit in March and now plans to make the kit more widely available to its wardens.

 Nobody should have to be spat at while they go about their work. The spit kit will be a powerful deterrent against the small minority who think they can spit at traffic wardens, said the spokesman. 

 Church cut

 London (AP): Welsh teenager Charlotte 

 Church, who has transformed herself from child opera prodigy 

 to pop star, has been named GQ magazines woman 

 of the year. GQ hailed the 19-year-old as a role 

 model and praised Church for her efforts to take her voice, 

 dubbed by critics as angelic, into a harder, more rock-star 

 style. Charlotte Church is our woman of the year simply 

 because she is larger than life. She is a great singer, 

 a tabloid giant and enjoys life to the full, said 

 GQ editor Dylan Jones. After four albums of classical 

 music and opera, Church released her first pop recording, 

 Tissues and Issues, this year.

 Rubens art

 Brussels (Reuters): A recently discovered painting by Peter Paul Rubens, showing Christs descent from the Cross, will go on display at an exhibition in Italy later this week, a Belgian weekly said on Wednesday. Rubens-expert Justus Mueller Hofstede recently discovered the painting ? completed around 1602 ? in a private collection, he told Knack weekly in an interview. Professor Hofstede will publish his findings later this week. The Flemish artist, Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), was one of the most influential artists in northern Europe in the 17th century, best known for his paintings of women as well as biblical scenes.

 Hindus slam blasts 

 London, July 9 (PTI): Describing the London blasts as a barbaric attack on human dignity, democratic freedom and modern civilisation, the Hindu Forum of Britain appealed to all faiths to extend full support to the government in fighting all forms of terror. 

 It was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister Tony Blair saying that we will stand united in our resolve to ensure that terrorism will never win, said Ramesh Kallidai, secretary general of the forum.

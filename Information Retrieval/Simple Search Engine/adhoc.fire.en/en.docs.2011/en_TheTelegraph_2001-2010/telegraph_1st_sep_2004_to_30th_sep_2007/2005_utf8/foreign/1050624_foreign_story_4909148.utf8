 After tsunami, disease

 Boston/Jakarta, June 23 (Reuters): The December tsunami that left over 200,000 people dead or missing in Asia and Africa appears to have caused some unusual lung and sinus infections, and even a paralysing brain infection, according to officials and a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.

 Doctors from Massachusetts General Hospital report in the Journal on the case of a 17-year-old girl from Indonesia who was 2.5 km inland when a wave from the December 26 tsunami swept her up and carried her another kilometre.

 Two days later she developed a cough, followed by headache, nausea and vomiting. She was treated for pneumonia but after another week developed a weakness on the right side of her body, which progressed to paralysis.

 The teen turned out to have a brain abscess caused by the same infection that had first attacked her lungs. After intensive treatment with antibiotics, she recovered and was able to walk.

 Her case was rare among tsunami survivors, said Tjandra Yoga Aditama, a senior lung doctor who served in a government team that reopened hospitals in Aceh where the tsunami left more than 160,000 killed or missing.

 There were a few cases, but definitely not many. We had one treated in Aceh and several (treated) in Medan, he said, referring to the countrys third largest city where many tsunami patients from Aceh were taken.

 Aditama said he had not heard of any new cases since early this year, but added that pneumonia was a major problem for tsunami survivors.

 UWorld Health Organisation (WHO) officials also said the case reported in the journal was likely to be rare.

 This is most likely an individual case, but would not be a transferable disease based on the information available, Anshu Banerjee, head of the WHO office in Aceh, said.

 In Thailand, a team of doctors at Bangkoks Rajavithi hospital reported that after the December 26 disaster they had to treat lung problems in dozens of patients who inhaled salt water contaminated by bacteria often found in the soil.

 Pro-Syria PM on way back

 Beirut, March 9 (Reuters): Lebanon?s parliament nominated pro-Syrian Omar Karami as Prime Minister today, a decision sure to anger the anti-Syrian Opposition that pressured him to resign in the first place.

 Syrian troops continued to redeploy to eastern Lebanon in the first stage of a two-phase pullout, security sources said. Some soldiers crossed into Syria with equipment. Sixty-nine deputies out of 128 named Karami in consultations with pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud, political sources said.

 Lahoud was now bound to charge Karami with forming a national unity government to lead Lebanon to May elections, and was expected to make the announcement tomorrow.

 Karami submitted the resignation of his government last week after large anti-Syrian protests in Beirut but stayed on as caretaker.

 Forming a national unity government will be a difficult task for Karami. To succeed, he will have to bring in a number of Opposition figures and cannot simply reform a pro-Syrian government like the one that resigned with him.

 Hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Lebanese flooded central Beirut yesterday for a pro-Syrian rally called by the Hizbollah militant group that dwarfed previous protests demanding Syrian troops quit Lebanon. Lebanese newspapers, even those who back the opposition, agreed the rally was Lebanon?s largest.

 ?The greatest demonstration in Lebanon?s history: Let?s unite,? Leftist As-Safir daily said in a frontpage headline splashed over a picture of the crowd. ?Hizbollah draws largest crowd ?in gratitude to Syria?,? the Opposition An-Nahar dailys headline said.

 It was the first major show of popular support for Syria in Beirut since the February 14 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri touched off daily anti-Syrian protests.

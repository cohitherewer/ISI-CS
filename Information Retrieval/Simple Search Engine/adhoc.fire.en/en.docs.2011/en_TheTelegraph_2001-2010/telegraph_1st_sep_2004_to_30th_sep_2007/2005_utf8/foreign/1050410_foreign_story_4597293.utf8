 Cardinals in media silence

 Reverend Sebastian Vaniyapurackal from Kerala, who has lived in Rome for five years, said he was surprised how Pope John Paul always had time for people like him. ?He talked not only with authorities in high levels, he wanted also to be near to all the faithful,? he said. (AP)

 Vatican City, April 9 (Reuters): Roman Catholic cardinals imposed a media silence on themselves today as they resumed meeting to prepare to choose a successor to Pope John Paul, whose funeral resounded with calls to make him a saint.

 The Vatican said the cardinals made the decision at the latest ?general congregation?, meetings being held until April 18, start date of a conclave to choose one cardinal as new pope. ?They have begun a period of more intense silence and prayer,? spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.

 ?They decided unanimously to avoid interviews and meetings with the media. Journalists are invited not to ask for interviews or meetings with the cardinals.

 ?This should not be interpreted as a snub to the media but a gesture of great responsibility,? the spokesman said.

 On April 18 only 115 of the cardinals who are under 80 will enter the Sistine Chapel and face the daunting task of choosing a successor to John Paul, whose effect on people?s lives was shown by the massive turnout for his funeral.

 The original total was 117, but the Vatican said two cardinals ? Jaime Sin of the Manila and Adolfo Antonio Suarez Rivera of Monterrey, Mexico ? were too ill to travel.

 Many of those present at yesterday?s funeral chanted ?Santo Subito?, demanding the church make the pope a saint immediately. The call was picked up by Italian newspapers today.

 Newspapers said the Vatican already had information on ?miracles? that faithful from around the world claimed John Paul had worked on their lives.

 La Repubblica said the miracle stories included one from a doctor who once operated on the pope. The doctor was brought out of an irreversible coma, the paper said, while others had been healed of cancer, including a four-year-old with leukaemia.

 Vatican rules say the process leading to sainthood cannot even start until five years after the death of a Pope. But John Paul?s successor could waive the rule and let the procedure start earlier. John Paul himself did that for Mother Teresa. ?This decision belongs exclusively to the next Pontiff,? Navarro-Valls said.

Yesterday?s funeral was the first of nine daily Masses 

of mourning that will be held until the night before the conclave begins.

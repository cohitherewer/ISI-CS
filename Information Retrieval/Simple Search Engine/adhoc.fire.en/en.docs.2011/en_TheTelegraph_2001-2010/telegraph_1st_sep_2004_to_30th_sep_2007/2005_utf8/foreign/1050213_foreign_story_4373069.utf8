 Graf wins case over saucy radio quiz

 Steffi Graf: Radio ruckus 

 Berlin, Feb. 12: No room 

 is safe ? not even your bedroom. At least not if you are 

 a celebrity. 

 Tennis legend Steffi Graf learnt it the hard way when a German radio station aired a sketch supposedly of her and husband Andre Agassi, also a former world number one, in the throes of lovemaking.

 WDR broadcast a conversation on December 29 in which actors batted words back and forth before settling on Jaden Gil, the name of Graf and Agassi?s first child. The radio station then asked listeners to identify the famous pair.

 Graf took offence at the coarse sketch and filed a complaint, claiming injury to her reputation, with a court in the western city of Cologne. It heard the case yesterday.

 WDR backed down and issued an undertaking not to air any similar sketch in the future, agreeing it would pay a 5,100 euro ($6,600) penalty if it did. ?The court made it clear they would have banned any further broadcasts if the station had not done so,? a court spokesman said.

 WDR was also made to pay the legal costs of around 5,000 euros.

 Last month, Oscar-winning Australian star Nicole Kidman said she had been a virtual prisoner in her Sydney home, fearing for her safety if she left due to the actions of two photographers staking out her house.

 Kidman won restraining orders against the photographers after a listening device was found outside her home. In 1999, a freelance journalist was convicted in the US of illegally taping an intercepted telephone call from Kidman to her then-husband, actor Tom Cruise, and selling the tape to a tabloid newspaper. Their 10-year marriage ended in 2001.

 China in arms build-up

 Washington, July 20 (Reuters): China not only is massing forces facing Taiwan, but developing new long-range missiles and acquiring an arsenal of sophisticated jets and warships in an ambitious arms build-up, the US said today.

 Over the next several years, Beijing will deploy a DF-31 road-mobile, solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile and a JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile, the Pentagon said in an annual report to Congress on Chinese military power.

 The current military focus by the Peoples Liberation Army stresses protecting Chinese borders and waters and intimidating Taiwan, according to the 44-page report, which lists a broad range of new armaments from fighter jets to submarines.

 Here is a breakdown of some of weapons listed and a look at efforts by Beijings huge PLA ground forces to slim down and mobilise:

 Ballistic missiles:

 About 650-730 mobile CSS-6 and CSS-7 short-range missiles in coastal garrisons opposite Taiwan. Deployment is increasing by about 100 missiles a year, including improved range and accuracy in newer versions.

 Air Power:

 More than 700 aircraft within un-refuelled operational range of Taiwan. Many are outdated, but Beijing continues acquiring sleek fighters from Russia, including the Su-30 MKK multi-role and Su-Mk2 maritime strike aircraft. 

 Naval Power:

Includes 64 major surface warships, 55 attack submarines, 

40 medium and heavy amphibious lift vessels and about 50 coastal missile patrol 

craft. Two-thirds of the fleet is located in the East and South Sea fleets.

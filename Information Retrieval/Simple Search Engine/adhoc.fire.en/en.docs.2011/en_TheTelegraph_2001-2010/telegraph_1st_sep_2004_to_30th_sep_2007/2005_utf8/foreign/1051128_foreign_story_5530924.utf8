 Tigers mix tact and threat

 Colombo, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tiger rebels today warned the government that they would intensify their independence fight unless given acceptable political power, in a speech analysts said was diplomatic but also threatening.

 Rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran said the Tigers would wait to see how perceived hardline new President Mahinda Rajapakse would approach the islands stalled peace process.

 Our people have lost patience, hope and reached the brink of utter frustration, Prabhakaran said in his annual Heroes Day address to observe the rebel war dead.

 The new government should come forward soon with a reasonable political framework that will satisfy the political aspirations of the Tamil people.

 Without government accommodations, the Tigers would intensify their struggle, he said ? seen as a thinly veiled threat of war. Rajapakse ? whose hardline Buddhist and Marxist allies loathe the minority Tamil rebels ? has said he wants concessions from the rebels, not the other way around.

 Analysts said Prabhakarans speech was less aggressive than many had feared, but also effectively put the government on notice that a revival of the rebel armed campaign was possible. More than 64,000 people were killed during two decades of war halted by a ceasefire in 2002.

 Its a hawkish speech couched very diplomatically, said Janes Defence Weekly analyst Iqbal Athas. It actually makes war much more likely. The gulf widens because both have restated their positions. I cant see Mr Rajapakse backing down.

 Observers say the Tigers effectively won the November 17 election for Rajapakse when they blocked roads to prevent Tamils expected to back his more conciliatory rival from voting. Some saw the boycott as a sign the rebels fear being trapped in an internationally backed peace process. A stable peace is seen as a key condition for Sri Lankas $20-billion economy to grow. The islands stock market has fallen sharply since Rajapakses victory, partly because of worries about a return to war.

 We are... aware of the incompatible gaps and the irreconcilable contradictions that exist between Mr Rajapakses vision and the Tamils struggle for self-determination, Prabhakaran said.

 Mr Rajapakse is considered a realist committed to pragmatic politics... We have, therefore, decided to wait and observe, for some time.

 Iraq suicide blast kills 98

 Musayyib (Iraq), July 17 (Reuters): A suicide bomber in a fuel truck killed at least 98 people near a crowded vegetable market, devastating a highway town south of Baghdad late yesterday, and more attacks struck the capital early today.

 Al Qaidas wing in Iraq vowed more violence as a relentless campaign of suicide car bombings across the capital and towns to the south entered its third day, having killed more than 100 people. Within just over 48 hours there have been at least 14 suicide bombings.

 By far the worst incident was the blast near a Shia mosque which caused devastation in the small highway town of Musayyib, near Karbala, last night. In addition to the 98 killed, at least 82 people were wounded, police said.

 It was the worst single attack in Iraq since May, when more than 60 Kurds were killed outside a police recruiting centre in the northern city of Arbil. This is a black day in the history of the town, Musayyib police chief Yas Khudayr said by telephone.

 Some people who rushed to the scene discovered they had lost loved ones. After the bomb I went over there and found my sons head. I could not find his body, said Mohsen Jassim of his 18- year-old son.

 Al Qaida in Iraq, which has urged hundreds of suicide bombers from across the Arab world to come to Iraq to wage holy war, claimed responsibility for the latest suicide bombing campaign and said more violence would follow.

 The operation is continuing as planned and we warn the enemies of God of more to come. We ask our Muslim brothers around the world to pray for God to grant us victory, said an al Qaida Internet statement yesterday.

 Today morning began with two more suicide car bombs at police checkpoints in the capital.

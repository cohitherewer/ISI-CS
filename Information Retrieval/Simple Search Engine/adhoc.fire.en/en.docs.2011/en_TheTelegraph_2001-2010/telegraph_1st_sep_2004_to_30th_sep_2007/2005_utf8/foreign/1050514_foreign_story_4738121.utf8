 Bond role news to Craig

 Daniel Craig: Me, spy? 

 New York, May 13 (AP): 

 If Daniel Craig is going to be the next James Bond, its 

 news to him.

 Craig, who stars in the upcoming thriller Layer Cake, says he first heard the rumour from British tabloids while he was filming a movie in Texas.

 They seem to know a lot more than I do, Craig said recently. Craig praised the Bond character, calling him an iconographic figure in movie-making, but said he hasnt given the role any serious thought. But he added: I think youd have to be stupid not to consider something like that.

 The blond, blue-eyed British-born actors credits include the 2005 thriller The Jacket, starring Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley. 

 Craig, 37, co-starred with Tom Hanks in the 2002 film The Road to Perdition and with Gwyneth Paltrow in Sylvia.

 Layer Cake, based on the novel by J. Connolly, opens in selected cities today.

 Karzai plea on Quran row

 Kabul, May 14 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai urged the US today to prosecute and punish anyone found guilt of desecrating the Quran as anti-US protests flared for a fifth day.

 Sixteen Afghans have been killed and more than 100 hurt since Wednesday in the worst anti-US protests across Afghanistan since American forces invaded in 2001 to oust the Taliban for harbouring Osama bin Laden and his al Qaida network.

 Newsweek magazine said in its May 9 edition investigators probing abuses at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay found that interrogators had placed Qurans on toilets, and in at least one case flushed a holy book down the toilet. If proven that this happened, then we will strongly ask the American government to put on trial and punish whoever is the culprit, Karzai said. 

 The US has tried to calm global Muslim outrage over the incident, saying disrespect for the Quran was abhorrent and would not be tolerated, and military authorities were investigating the allegation.

 International Muslim groups in Saudi Arabia also called on the US to investigate and punish those responsible.

 The 57-nation Organisation of the Islamic Conference said the report had enraged Muslims and would provide fanatics and extremists with excuses to... justify their acts of violence and terrorism.

 The anti-US protesters in Afghanistan have also been venting their anger against Karzai, torching government offices and police stations.

 Microsoft answer to Google

 Seattle, Feb. 1 (PTI): Microsoft Corp. finished its first Internet search engine built from scratch, an effort to boost advertising revenue and catch up with Google.

 Microsoft, the world?s biggest software maker, paid hundreds of people to test the MSN Internet search programme over the past 11 weeks and to help engineers improve the results by ranking searches against market leader Google and number two Yahoo! Inc., vice-president Yusuf Mehdi said.

 The company spent 18 months developing the programme, which is now available at the msn.com site, and wants future versions to let users delve through video content and text from books, Mehdi said. By using its own software, instead of relying on other companies, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft can add functions that win over more users and help boost advertising revenue.

 With the official release of the service today, Microsoft?s msn will begin television and print advertising and ?the largest Internet ad campaign probably ever,? Mehdi said. 

 Microsoft still needs to improve the search for local businesses, Mehdi said.

 The company wants to index the text of books, videos, newspaper articles that are available for a fee and the database of Internet auction site ebay Inc., Mehdi said. Microsoft is releasing the final version in 25 countries and 10 languages. 

 It will be faster and more likely to return results that match what the user is looking for than the previous test version, Mehdi said.

 Library ?edits? Sartre smoker

 HENRY SAMUEL

 Paris , March 10: France?s National Library has airbrushed Jean-Paul Sartre?s trademark cigarette out of a poster of the chain-smoking philosopher to avoid prosecution under an anti-tobacco law.

 ?Smoking,? the Left-wing existentialist wrote, is ?the symbolic equivalent of destructively appropriating the entire world.?

 And yet in its poster for an exhibition to mark the hundredth anniversary of Sartre?s birth the Biblioth?que Nationale de France decided, destructively or not, to edit out the philosopher?s Gauloise.

 The library?s president, Jean-No? Jeanneney, confirmed that the cigarette had been discreetly smudged to comply with the 1991 loi Evin - a law banning tobacco advertising ? but also so as not to frighten away potential sponsors from the exhibition, which opened yesterday.

 Sartre?s love of tobacco is well documented: he reportedly smoked his way through two packets and several pipes a day. Indeed, all the best-known photographs of the author of La Naus?e, such as his portrait by Henri Cartier-Bresson on the Pont des Arts in Paris, depict him with a cigarette or pipe in hand.

 So organisers homed in on a photo taken by the artist Lipnitzki in 1946 during a rehearsal of Sartre?s play La Putain Respectueuse, (The Respectful Prostitute), from which Sartre?s cigarette could easily be removed.

 The doctoring of the photo was first spotted by Lib?ration, fittingly enough the Left-wing newspaper founded by Sartre. The exhibition shows previously unseen manuscripts by the writer and author of the immortal line: ?Hell is other people.?

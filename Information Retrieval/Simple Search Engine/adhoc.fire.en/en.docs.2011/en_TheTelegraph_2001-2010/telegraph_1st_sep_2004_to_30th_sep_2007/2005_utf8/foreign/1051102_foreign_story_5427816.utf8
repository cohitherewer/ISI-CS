 Stampede for stem cell registration

 Seoul, Nov. 1 (AP): The website of a stem cell research centre here was overloaded today when it began formally accepting applications from patients seeking to benefit from cloning technology. 

 The World Stem Cell Hub, led by cloning pioneer Hwang Woo-suk, had announced that it would begin receiving patient registration via the Internet and in person this morning. Its website, inaccessible for hours due to a rush of applications, returned to normal around late morning. 

 Our website was extremely slow for about three hours from 8 am as there were too many access attempts, said Yang Sung-kee, an official in charge of the website management at Seoul National Hospital where the research centre is. It looked like the server went down, but it didnt. 

 The official said his team had two network experts on standby in case of attacks on the site from those who oppose cloning technology, but there were no such attempts. 

 Nearly 1,200 applications were received this morning, said Lim Jong-pil, a centre official. More were still being submitted. 

 Im pinning all hopes on this, said Lee Kil-no, 52, sitting in his wheelchair at the registration centre, where dozens of other patients were filling up registration forms. 

 Lee said he suffered paralysis from the chest down after falling from a five-story construction site. I believe my condition will improve if I get this treatment. I wish I could walk again, he said. 

 The stem cell bank opened on October 19 with the aim to serve as the main centre for providing scientists around the world with embryonic stem cells, seen as a potential source of replacement tissue for treating a variety of ailments. 

 The bank planned to receive applications from patients with Parkinsons disease or damaged spinal cords, who are willing to offer their skin tissue for research purposes. Officials have said it doesnt mean the beginning of clinical tests or treatment, yet applications still surged. 

 The bank ? which will have its first branches in the UK and US ? is expected to provide other scientists room to get around government restrictions on research into embryonic stem cells. 

 Many scientists are hoping to accelerate research on embryonic stem cells ? master cells that can grow into all the other tissues in the body. 

 However, culling stem cells often involves destroying the days-old embryos and the Bush administration bans US federal funding for research on all but a handful of older embryonic stem-cell lines. 

 Hwang has received world recognition for cloning the worlds first human embryos and extracting stem cells.

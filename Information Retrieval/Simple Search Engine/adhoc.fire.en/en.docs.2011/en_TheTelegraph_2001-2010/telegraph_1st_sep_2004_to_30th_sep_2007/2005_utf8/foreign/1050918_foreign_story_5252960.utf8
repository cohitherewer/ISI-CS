 Unlike Sourav, life is rosy for Vaughan

 AMIT ROY

 Andrew Flintoff and Michael Vaughan in London

 London, Sept. 17: While Sourav Ganguly, the Indian cricket captain, is in the middle of a major crisis with his coach, Greg Chappell, life could not be rosier for his England counterpart, Michael Vaughan, who is to be given the freedom of his home city of Sheffield, it was announced yesterday.

 He has spoken warmly of the supportive and strategic role played by his coach, Zimbabwe-born Duncan Fletcher, to whom Vaughan is obviously very close ? in marked contrast to the apparent rift between Ganguly and Chappell.

 The British media will now take every opportunity to undermine India by twisting the knife in the run-up to the clash with India next spring. Ganguly already has more than his fair share of enemies in the English camp, where he is often tauntingly referred to as Lord Snooty.

 The city of Preston was first off the mark in deciding to grant a similar honour to its favourite son, Andrew Freddie Flintoff, the England all-rounder whose heroics helped his side win the Ashes against Australia.

 Watching Flintoff run through the Australian batsmen at the Oval, the former British Prime Minister, John Major, a cricket enthusiast, worried about the riches in the form of endorsements that would now flow in the direction of the player, now hailed as the new Ian Botham and more popular than even David Beckham, the football captain.

 I hope it doesnt go to his head, commented Major. I dont think it will.

 However, it was disclosed yesterday that Flintoff, who may earn well over a million pounds in the next 12 months, is moving with his wife, Rachael, and their daughter, Holly, from their present relatively modest home into a Georgian-style mansion in an area of Cheshire popular with Premiership footballers and soap stars. The couple are expecting their second baby.

 Flintoffs new three-storey house, which backs on to a golf course, is in an exclusive development in the leafy village of Hale, near Altrincham.

 Workmen were today putting the finishing touches to the house. Neighbours in the village include Manchester United players Roy Keane and Ruud van Nistelrooy as well as a number of actors from the TV soap, Coronation Street. What must be a worry to fans of Flintoff, who plays county cricket for Lancashire, is that a certain vulgarity is normally associated with the lifestyle of celebrities.

 Flintoffs skipper, Vaughan, will be the 68th personality to be granted the freedom of Sheffield.

 The 30-year-old, who lives in the upmarket Dore area of the city with his wife Nichola and baby daughter Tallulah Grace, joins a list that includes Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela.

 Lord Mayor Roger Davison said: Sheffield is very proud of Michael Vaughan.

 Vaughan, who will help pick the England Test and one-day sides to tour Pakistan this winter ? the names will be announced on Monday ? said he was honoured to receive the freedom of his home city but was unsure of the perks. He joked: Freddie said he would get a few free drinks in Preston, so I might get a few free in Sheffield.

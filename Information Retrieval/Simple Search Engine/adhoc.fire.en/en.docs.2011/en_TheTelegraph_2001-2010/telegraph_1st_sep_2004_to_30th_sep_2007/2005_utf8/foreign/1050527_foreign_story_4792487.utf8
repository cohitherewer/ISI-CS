 Fine Print

 Toilet trauma

 Helsinki, May 26 (Reuters): Shoppers in Finland raided shelves for toilet paper yesterday in fear of it running out as a lockout of workers kept the Nordic countrys paper mills shut.

 As soon as we get a delivery, the packages vanish off the shelves. The big bags go first, said Hille Laine, manager of a central Helsinki shop which had no tissue paper products left.

 Paper makers enforced a four-week lockout on May 18 following a two-day strike by workers. The latest round of talks ended without a deal on Wednesday, meaning that the lockout will continue at least until Monday.

 Chain plan

 Nicosia (Reuters): British women on 

 the Mediterranean island of Cyprus plan to make the worlds 

 longest chain of bras to heighten breast cancer awareness 

 and raise funds for research. Organisers said they will 

 need at least 90,000 bras and about 10 months to build the 

 chain that they hope will put them in the Guinness Book 

 of World Records. The previous record was a 79,000-long 

 bra chain in Singapore. Organisers have asked for small 

 money donations with each bra.

 Fine Print

 Business basics

 London, June 26 (PTI): Teenagers in Britain will get an oppurtunity to launch their own business by attending two-week summer schools run by local companies.

 The scheme is expected to be introduced in two years time, Sunday Telegraph reported. The courses, designed for all pupils aged between 12 and 18, will feature intensive training, including lessons in how to draw up business plans and obtain bank loans. 

 Cruise out of control

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Tom Cruise has 

 leaped to the forefront of celebrity punch lines since his 

 couch-hopping appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. 

 Tom and Katie got engaged on Friday and, once again, 

 the media somehow found out about it, late-night comedian 

 Jimmy Kimmel said on his show last week. If we promise 

 to go see War of the Worlds, will you please make 

 this stop? Another website was hawking Free 

 Katie T-shirts, stickers and coffee mugs.

 Koizumi visit sparks anger

 Tokyo, Oct. 17 (Reuters): China and South Korea protested angrily today after Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi paid homage at a Tokyo shrine for war dead that its neighbours consider a symbol of Japans militaristic past.

 There were small demonstrations in Beijing, Hong Kong and Seoul, and Kyodo news agency reported that a meeting tentatively planned for later this week in Beijing between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers would not take place.

 Japans relations with Beijing and Seoul had already chilled because of the annual visits by Koizumi to Yasukuni shrine, where war criminals are honoured along with 2.5 million war dead.

 Clad in a dark suit rather than the traditional Japanese garb he has worn on some past visits, Koizumi bowed, put his hands together in prayer and stood silently in front of an outer shrine for a moment before striding back to his car in front of a crowd that had gathered in drizzling rain.

 Escorted by security police, he used the public entrance and did not enter an inner shrine as in the past. Koizumi later said he had made the visit to pray for peace and that outsiders including foreign governments should not interfere in how Japan mourns its war dead.

 Its a matter of the heart, he said, adding that China and South Korea would eventually understand his intentions. But Chinese ambassador to Japan Wang Yi branded the visit a grave provocation to the Chinese people.

 There is no doubt that (the visit) will damage Japan-China relations, Wang was quoted by Kyodo news agency as saying after meeting foreign minister Nobutaka Machimura.

 Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxing called in Japans ambassador to China to express Beijings strong indignation, Chinas foreign ministry said on its website. Japans embassy in Beijing advised Japanese nationals to stay away from areas where there was potential for anti-Japan demonstrations.

 South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki-moon summoned Japanese ambassador Shotaro Oshima to complain, and a presidential aide said President Roh Moo-hyun was unlikely to meet Koizumi for their semi-annual summit meeting this year.

 Hong Kong CEO quit buzz

 Hong Kong, March 2 (Reuters): Hong Kong?s chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, whose unpopular leadership led to pro-democracy protests in the city, has resigned, sources close to the government and Beijing said today.

 A source close to Hong Kong?s government said that Chinese leaders in Beijing accepted Tung?s resignation last Saturday. 

 Tung?s move comes weeks after he was publicly reprimanded by Chinese President Hu Jintao for poor performance in the past seven years.

 Another source close to Beijing said that Chinese leaders had already agreed to Tung stepping down but he would only formally resign after being made vice-chairman of a top advisory body to China?s parliament, a promotion Tung is almost certain to get over the next 10 days.

 Citing unidentified sources, Hong Kong newspapers reported Tung?s right hand man, chief secretary Donald Tsang, would be made acting chief executive after Tung steps down.

 But asked to confirm if Tung had stepped down, a government spokesperson said: ?We don?t comment on speculation.?

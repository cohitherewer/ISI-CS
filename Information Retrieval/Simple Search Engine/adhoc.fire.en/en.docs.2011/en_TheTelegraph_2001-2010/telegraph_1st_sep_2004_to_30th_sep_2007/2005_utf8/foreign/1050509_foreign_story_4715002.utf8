 Myanmar blast 

 Bangkok, May 8 (Reuters): Opponents of Myanmars military regime today denied that they were behind three bomb blasts that killed 11 people and wounded 162, blaming junta infighting for the countrys worst attacks in two decades.

 State media accused three ethnic rebel groups and an exiled pro-democracy group of ?terrorist acts? against two busy shopping malls and a trade centre yesterday in the capital Yangon.

 The groups rejected the charge and said the violence may be linked to last Octobers purge of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and reports of a power struggle in the secretive military leadership.

 France heat on foreigners

 Paris, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Urban violence dropped for the third straight night in France after the government adopted emergency powers, but a controversy erupted over the interior ministers plans to expel foreigners caught rioting.

 Two weeks of unrest in poor suburbs around France have badly rattled the conservative government and prompted Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin to invoke a 50-year-old law allowing local government officials to impose curfews and other restrictions.

 The move coincided with a sharp fall in petrol bomb attacks on cars, buses, public buildings and police by youths angered by racism, unemployment and harsh treatment by police.

 Many French people welcomed the governments tough response but Villepin also faced accusations of overreacting by reviving a measure dating from Algerias war of independence against its colonial master France.

 Its calm. Its subsiding, said a spokesman for the Seine-et-Marne department east of Paris. 

 Interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy, accused by opponents of stoking passions with his strong attacks on troublemakers, caused a new controversy by telling parliament that about 120 foreigners convicted of participating in the unrest would be expelled, even if they had residence permits.

 What were seeing is the restoration of double jeopardy, Pierre Henry, president of the Terre dasile association that works with immigrants, said. Sarkozy won plaudits from pro-immigrant groups three years ago when he abolished double jeopardy, a policy under which convicted foreigners are expelled after serving their sentence.

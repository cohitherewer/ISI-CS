 43 hurt in Madrid raid 

 Madrid, Feb. 9 (Reuters): A car bomb exploded near Madrid?s main convention centre today, injuring 43 people, hours before Spanish and Mexican leaders were due there and after a warning from the Basque separatist group ETA.

 The worst blast in the Spanish capital since last year?s March 11 al Qaida train bombings came before King Juan Carlos and Mexican President Vicente Fox were to open an art fair at the complex on the outskirts of the city.

 Forty-three people were hurt, none seriously, including 24 taken to hospital, an emergencies official said. 

 The explosion, which coincided with a major police operation against ETA, seemed to erase any hope the group might declare a truce before Basque regional elections in April and could dent Madrid?s bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games.

 ?The terrorist band ETA is weakened. It has no political future, but it still has operational strength,? interior minister Jose Antonio Alonso said. The ministry said 200 police officers had taken part in a nationwide operation overnight which had smashed ETA?s recruitment structure. Fourteen people were arrested in the operation.

 ?It?s awesome, unbelievable?

 Vatican City, April 19 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of joyous faithful cheered and applauded a smiling Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger when he appeared on the balcony of St Peter?s Basilica today as the new Pope Benedict XVI.

 ?Papa! Papa! Papa!?, the ecstatic crowd shouted in chorus as the 78-year-old German churchman who succeeds John Paul II smiled and raised his arms in greeting.

 People waved umbrellas, flags and posters to welcome the new pope. Some climbed lamp posts and fountains in the cobblestone square for a better view. Antonio Sette, 39, had travelled from Bari on Italy?s heel with his wife and 10-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son.

 ?It?s beautiful because I have brought my whole family here to see this so that when my children are my age some day, they will remember and tell their children,? he said.

 Lines of red-hatted cardinals flanked the new pope when he emerged on the balcony holding his hands aloft.

 The Vatican army, the Swiss Guard, marched in formation across St Peter?s Square. ?It?s awesome. It?s unbelievable,? exclaimed German student Ralf Geretshauser who came to Rome before the cardinals started their secret meetings in the Sistine Chapel on Monday.

 Amid the joy, there was a long period of anxious confusion before a senior cardinal announced the election of Ratzinger.

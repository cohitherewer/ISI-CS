 Liberals: Orphans of the order

 Vatican City, April 4 (Reuters): When Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini emerges from this month?s papal election and returns to his biblical studies in Jerusalem, liberal Roman Catholics will see another of their long-held hopes quietly slip away.

 Martini, a Jesuit who ran Italy?s Milan diocese for 22 years until he retired in 2002, was the man reformers hoped would succeed Pope John Paul and reverse his conservative policies.

 But John Paul?s 26-year reign was so long that the Pope outlasted Martini, who at 78 is seen as too old to be elected, and gradually replaced reformist cardinals and bishops with men much closer to his traditional Catholic teachings.

 This has left Catholicism?s reformist wing, the believers inspired by the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65, feeling like orphans in John Paul?s church with few leaders to represent them and little support for their concerns.

 ?The direction he took the church in internally was very distressing for those who had hopes for real reform,? said Christian Weisner, head of We Are Church, a reform movement started in 1995 after a clerical sex abuse scandal in Austria.

 ?John Paul II ignored pleas from the growing worldwide movement of grassroots Catholics seeking to strengthen the spirit of openness and inclusion that began with the Second Vatican Council,? he said.

 In the absence of statistics, it is hard to say whether the ?Vatican II Catholics? Weisner represents amount to a growing global trend. Most liberals tend to be from western Europe and North America, only a small part of the worldwide church.

 Many liberals are now going grey, a tell-tale sign they were young and idealistic when Pope John XXIII decided to ?throw open the windows of the church?. Having lived those changes, they look askance at more traditional views among younger Catholics.

 Christian Terras, editor of the critical French magazine Golias, formed his views in a 1960s Catholic youth group. ?I learned Christianity was based on something much more liberating and radical that what the clerics were saying,? he said.

 Reformist groups in western countries advocate women priests, married clergy, contraception, abortion, gay rights, shared communion with Protestants and other reforms rejected by John Paul and his doctrinal watchdog, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.

 Many Catholics in developing countries, which now make up about 70 per cent of the church worldwide, think little of these as well.

 The Vatican ban on condoms, even if they could prevent the spread of AIDS in Africa, stirred criticism among wider groups in western churches ? to the point where even some cardinals said preventing death was more important than regulating sex.

 Scandals in several countries concerning priests who sexually abused boys sparked groups like We Are Church in Europe and Voice of the Faithful in the US, which demanded more say by the laity in the way the church is run.

 While he did not openly espouse these causes, Martini was the liberals? darling because, in their view, he signalled a more open and sophisticated approach to new ideas.

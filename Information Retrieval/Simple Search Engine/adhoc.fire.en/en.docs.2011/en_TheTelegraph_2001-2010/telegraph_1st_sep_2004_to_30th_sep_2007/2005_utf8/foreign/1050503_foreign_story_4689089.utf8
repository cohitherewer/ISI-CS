 Orwell?s dark 1984 hits stage

 George Orwell

 London, May 2 (Reuters): The creators of a new opera based on the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four did not have to work hard to make George Orwell?s nightmarish vision of a loveless and brutal world resonate with audiences today.

 Technology used for surveillance and control, the denial of personal freedom, Doublethink, Newspeak and a seemingly endless war place a work written in 1948 firmly in the 21st Century.

 Lorin Maazel, the American conductor and composer who began working on the opera in 2000, insisted he did not set out to create political theatre. ?Five years ago no-one was really thinking in these terms,? the 75-year-old said backstage after a dress rehearsal for tomorrow?s world premiere at the Royal Opera House in London.

 ?The theme has concurrently become very current and seemingly ever more relevant ... but that was really not our intention.?

 There are references placing the action in the present: the sound of helicopters, orange jumpsuits for criminals and an English-American accent for Big Brother. But 1984, the opera, largely sticks to the novel?s script.

 ?We started discussing this project in the year 2000, so it was way before 9/11,? said Canadian director Robert Lepage, renowned for his bold productions.

 ?At that moment we didn?t suspect that the piece would resonate in such a strong way in today?s world.?

 Lepage argued that Orwell?s work had lost none of its relevance since the fall of Soviet Communism, the totalitarian system with which most readers associate the narrative. Spectators could work that out for themselves, he added.

 ?You have to have confidence in the intelligence of the audience, you have to trust ... that you don?t need to stress or underline anything that has to do with security or terrorism.?

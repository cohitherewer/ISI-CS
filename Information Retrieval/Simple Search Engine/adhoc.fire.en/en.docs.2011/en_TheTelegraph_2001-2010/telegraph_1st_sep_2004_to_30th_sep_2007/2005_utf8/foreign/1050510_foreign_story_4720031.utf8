 Scooter ban in Naples

 Naples, May 9 (Reuters): If you cant beat them, ban their getaway vehicles.

 So goes the logic of the latest attempt to curb crime in the southern Italian city of Naples ? a scooter ban to aid police chasing common crooks who famously rob pedestrians and speed away through the historic centres narrow alleyways. 

 ?Our goal is to give tourists and citizens more security,? said Nicola Oddati, Naples counsellor on traffic.

 From tomorrow, non-residents of the picturesque but often unruly area will be required to either leave their scooters behind, or walk them through the historic centre, motors off. 

 Sanctions include a fine of about 35 euros ($45) and possible confiscation of the vehicle.

 In the past, authorities have outlawed selling certain types of knives to curb violent theft in the city, the centre of an area whose unemployment rate is among the highest in Europe.

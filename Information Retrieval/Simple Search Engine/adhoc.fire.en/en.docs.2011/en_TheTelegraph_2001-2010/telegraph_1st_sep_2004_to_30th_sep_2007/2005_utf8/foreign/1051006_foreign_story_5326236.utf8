 Fund or FUN?

 Washington, Oct. 5 (Reuters): The IMF was temporarily rebranded yesterday when three letters came off its shiny new Washington headquarters, identifying the venerable development lender as the INTERN TIONA MONETARY FUN.

 The International Monetary Fund said the metallic characters were removed because of maintenance, not vandalism. The letter L fell off. When they noticed it was down, they checked all the letters and found the A and D were also loose, spokeswoman Frances Hardin said. 

 The missing L was found around the corner from the ultra-modern buildings entrance.

 Word play

 London (Reuters): Welsh has joined some 

 of the worlds major languages boasting an important 

 status symbol ? their own version of Scrabble. The Welsh 

 game does not contain some of the highest-scoring letters 

 in the English version of the board game such as Q 

 and Z but features tiles with combinations used 

 in Welsh such as LL and DD. Researchers 

 scoured the University of Wales dictionary and the Welsh 

 version of the bible ? some two million words ? to determine 

 the most commonly used letters in the language.

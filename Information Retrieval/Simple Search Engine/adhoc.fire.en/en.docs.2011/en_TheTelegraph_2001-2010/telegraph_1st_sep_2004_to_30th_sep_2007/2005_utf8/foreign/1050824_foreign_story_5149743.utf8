 Mai gets vote salute

 Mukhtaran Mai

 Meerwala (Pakistan), Aug. 23 (Reuters): Last week, the women of a Pakistani village infamous for a gangrape did something that gave the victim, Mukhtaran Mai, hope for the future.

 They voted.

 Wrapped in a shawl embroidered by herself and wearing salwar kameez, Mai was jubilant as she anticipated the election of two housewives from Meerwala to a district council.

 I hope these women will help resolve problems of all women. This can only be done if women are fully empowered, said Mai, who caused a storm of bad publicity for Pakistan and became an international symbol for womens rights after speaking out over her gangrape ordeal three years ago.

 The first phase of elections for district councils was held on August 19 when 53 of the countrys 110 districts voted. The remaining districts will cast their ballots on Thursday.

 Turnout was put around 50 per cent in the first round, but among women it was less, ranging from 43 per cent in populous Punjab province to 16 per cent in North West Frontier Province.

 Mai, who used money donated by the Pakistan government and supporters at home and abroad to establish a school for girls in Meerwala, canvassed door-to-door to get village womenfolk to come out and vote. Up to eight women stood for election, she said.

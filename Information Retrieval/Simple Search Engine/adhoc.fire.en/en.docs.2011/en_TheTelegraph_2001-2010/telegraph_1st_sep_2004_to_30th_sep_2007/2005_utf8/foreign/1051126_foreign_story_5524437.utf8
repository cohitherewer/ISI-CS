 Brazil jail blooms

 Sao Paulo (Brazil), Nov. 25 (Reuters): An Angolan won Brazils marquee prison beauty pageant, beating a troupe of contestants born in a country where people are deadly serious about looking good, even in its notorious jails.

 Angelica Mazua, 23, was the choice of the judging panel. Inmates from 10 prisons competed in last nights event in Sao Paulo. Finalists in the categories of beauty, poetry, prose and congeniality had their nails, hair and makeup done by a non-profit group that provides make-overs to underprivileged women. Female prison guards also helped out.

 Dolled up Dutch royal

 Amsterdam (Reuters): A Dutch cartoonist 

 has created a paper doll of the late Prince Bernhard, the 

 German-born father of Dutch Queen Beatrix, which can be 

 dressed in 30 costumes including the black uniform of Adolf 

 Hitlers elite SS guard. Prince Bernhard, who died 

 last year at the age of 93, was a member of the Nazi party 

 before marrying Dutch Queen Juliana in 1937. He later fled 

 the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands for England, where 

 he flew Spitfires for the Allies.

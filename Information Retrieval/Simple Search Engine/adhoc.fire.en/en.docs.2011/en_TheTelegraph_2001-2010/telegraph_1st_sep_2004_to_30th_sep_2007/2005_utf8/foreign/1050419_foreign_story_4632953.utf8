 Iraqi flak on leaders for fake hostage crisis

 Baghdad, April 18 (Reuters): Iraqis today accused their new leaders of fabricating a hostage crisis for political ends and urged them instead to focus on tackling relentless violence and unemployment after two years of turmoil.

 Officials said on Saturday that Sunni insurgents were holding 150 Shia hostages in Madaen, about 45 km south of Baghdad, and were threatening to kill them unless Shias left the area.

 Shia caretaker Prime Minister Iyad Allawi vowed to punish the ?terrorist? kidnappers he linked with al Qaida?s wing in Iraq. But raids by Iraqi forces backed by US troops have yielded no kidnappers or hostages.

 People on a central Baghdad street frustrated by suicide bombings and economic hardship drew their own conclusions. ?It is all lies. Instead of fighting terrorism the government is just making things up. What we need are jobs,? said Abu Zahra, a 35-year-old labourer standing with other workers hoping to get menial jobs for about $5 a day.

 The murky drama has raised fears that a major conflict between majority Shias and rival Sunnis could erupt.

 Shia-Sunni towns like Madaen are especially volatile because they have a delicate sectarian and tribal mix. Iraqi officials say tensions have been rising there because of tit-for-tat kidnappings. So whether or not the kidnappings took place, the episode threatens to intensify distrust in a country trying to adjust to a new political landscape after decades of iron-fisted rule.

 Majority Shias long oppressed under Saddam Hussein are now the most powerful force. Minority Sunnis who enjoyed vast privileges under the toppled dictator are sidelined.

 Doubts about what actually happened in Madaen fuelled the growing cynicism of Iraqis whose leaders have promised stability and economic prosperity since US-led troops invaded the country in 2003. ?There is no way it is true. It was probably a problem with one person in Madaen and people with their own interests blew it up,? said Jasmine Daghaghni, waiting to cross a busy street.

 Part of the frustration stems from Iraq?s power vacuum 11 weeks after the January 30 elections.

 The conflicting reports from Madaen generated conspiracy theories that thrive on Iraq?s uncertainty. Some people said US forces made up the story for an excuse to raid Madaen. Others suspected Iran, which was home to Iraqi Shia exiles during Saddam?s rule.

 Fewer girls in science class

 VALERIE STRAUSS

 Washington, Feb. 1: In Sarah Wise?s section of a computer systems laboratory at the elite Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, the 18-year-old senior is the only girl. 

 That?s a better ratio, though, than in 17-year-old David Banh?s computational physics class at the Fairfax County school. It has only boys. There aren?t any girls in the school?s top mathematics class, either. Senior Rachel Miller, 17, who took algebra in fourth grade, was asked to join, but she decided biology would be more fun.

 Ask teachers, administrators and students at Thomas Jefferson ? where about 55 per cent of the 1,694 students are boys ? why such discrepancies exist in these classes, and they will say it has nothing to do with ability. 

 So what explains it?

 ?It?s a fabulous conundrum,? said Josh Strong, the school?s division manager for science and technology. 

 The issue has new relevance since Harvard University president Lawrence H. Summers roiled the academic world last month by suggesting that the country?s shortage of elite female scientists might stem in part from ?innate? differences between men and women.

 ?Any elementary teacher can tell you that a class with 15 boys and five girls is very different from a class with 15 girls and five boys,? wrote Scott Hollinger, principal of McAuliffe Elementary School in McAllen, Texas, in an e-mail response to questions about the issue.

 Young boys are more physical and seem more spatially aware at a younger age, while girls are more social and learn language faster, educators say. 

 But because girls and boys develop differently on average, research suggests that they can be directed to develop in different ways.

 Teachers and scientists say that there are greater differences in learning styles within each sex than there are between the sexes and that any school or teacher that doesn?t approach students as individuals is missing the mark.

 Although all Thomas Jefferson students are required to take computer science, the more advanced elective courses are heavily populated with boys, as are advanced physics, engineering and math, teachers and students say; biology and chemistry classes are more attractive to girls, as are the humanities.

 Students, teachers and administrators attribute class enrolment to factors including personal interests and personality, levels of exposure at younger ages and the subtle ? and not so subtle ? stereotypical signals sent by adults.

 Boys, for example, are more often exposed to computers and blocks at an earlier age than girls and thus come early to engineering, a subject that requires early interest for proper sequential course enrolment, teachers said.

 Girls are usually more social ? something Jan Taylor, an engineer turned school counsellor at Thomas Jefferson, believes is ?hard-wired? ? and physics and math are commonly seen as more individual pursuits. Biology, on the other hand, is usually seen as more collaborative, students said.

 Big Macs get the rap

London, March 29: McDonald?s is tempting rappers to use the name Big Mac in their lyrics, it was reported yesterday.

 The fast food chain will offer singers up to $5 (?2.80) every time their song is played on the radio, the American magazine Advertising Age said.

 It said its goal was to have Big Macs featuring in several songs by the summer.

 Rap and hip-hop artists are no strangers to placing brand names, but they have usually concentrated on more expensive items than burgers. Bentley, Porsche, Gucci and Dom Perignon have all been mentioned by the likes of Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg.

 McDonald?s is said to have hired marketing firm Maven Strategies for the campaign. Its president, Tony Rome, said: ?The main thing is to allow the artists to do what they do best. We?re letting them creatively bring to life the product in their song.?

 The burger chain would have final approval of the lyrics, he added.

 A McDonald?s spokesman said: ?This partnership reflects our appreciation and respect for the most dominant youth culture in the world.?

 Revealed: Osama sought UK asylum

 DANIEL MCGRORY

 Bin Laden: Astonishing 

 London, Sept. 29: He claims 

 to hate everything the West stands for. But yesterday it 

 emerged that Osama bin Laden sought asylum in Britain even 

 as he was planning the September 11 attacks on the US. 

 The al Qaida leader wanted to 

 abandon his base in Sudan at the end of 1995 and asked some 

 of his followers in London to sound out whether he would 

 be able to move to Britain. 

 Michael Howard, who was then home 

 secretary, recalls how his aides told him of the asylum 

 request from the Saudi-born militant of whom the world knew 

 little of ten years ago. A number of his brothers and other 

 relatives, all members of the wealthy bin Laden construction 

 empire, owned properties in London by the mid-1990s. 

 The teenage bin Laden had reportedly 

 toured Europe with his family and became a fan of the Arsenal 

 football club in London, though there is no record of his 

 ever having been to a match at Highbury. 

 The astonishing approach to the 

 British authorities happened only months after bin Laden 

 had secretly organised a terror summit in Manila in January 

 1995 to begin planning how hijackers would turn passenger 

 planes into flying bombs. He called it the Bojinka 

 plot, which is Arabic slang for an explosion. 

 By this time bin Laden had also 

 transferred some of his considerable personal fortune to 

 London for his followers to establish terror cells here 

 and across Europe. 

 His name rarely appeared in the 

 British media even though by late 1995 his network had already 

 bombed a number of US army bases abroad and plotted assassination 

 attempts against Pope John Paul II and President Clinton. 

 Howard said yesterday: In 

 truth, I knew little about him, but we picked up information 

 that bin Laden was very interested in coming to Britain. 

 It was apparently a serious request. He already had people 

 operating here, and who knows how history could have been 

 rewritten if he had turned up here? 

 Bin Laden never got a chance to 

 make a formal application as home office officials investigated 

 him and Howard issued an immediate banning order under Britains 

 immigration laws. 

 It was not until June 1998 ? two 

 months before attacks on US embassies in Africa ? that bin 

 Laden was placed on the FBIs most wanted list. 

 Bin Laden had, according to home 

 office officials, used a Saudi businessman, Khaled al-Fawwaz, 

 to sound out his chances of coming to Britain. 

 Fawwaz, 41, had arrived in 1994 

 and was described by security chiefs as his de facto 

 ambassador in Britain.

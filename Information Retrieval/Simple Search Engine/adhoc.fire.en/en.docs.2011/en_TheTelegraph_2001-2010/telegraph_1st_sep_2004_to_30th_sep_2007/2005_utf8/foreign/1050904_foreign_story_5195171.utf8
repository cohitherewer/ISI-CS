 Maoist truce to court parties

 Kathmandu, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Nepals Maoist rebels announced a three-month ceasefire from today, their chief said in a statement, in a move to win support of political parties opposed to King Gyanendras seizure of power in February.

 During this period, our Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) will be in defensive positions, Prachanda said in a statement made available to Reuters.

 The PLA will not launch any offensive from its side.

 We believe our move will encourage all forces, within and outside Nepal, who want peace through a forward-moving political solution, the elusive Maoist chief said. The Nepali Congress, the biggest party, welcomed the truce.

 We take this very positively, Nepali Congress spokesman Arjun Narsingh K.C. said, adding he hoped it would help to establish a permanent peace.

 Nepals mainstream political parties said in July they would hold talks with the rebels to discuss joint protests against Gyanendras power grab but added the rebels must stop the violence before the talks could take place.

 Prachanda also promised in July the rebels would not target unarmed civilians, stop extortion and urged the seven parties to name negotiators for talks on a united campaign against the king.

 The seven political parties that controlled more than 190 seats in the 205-member parliament dissolved in 2002 have been protesting against Gyanendras February 1 sacking of the multi-party government and assumption of absolute power.

 Today, more than 5,000 people attended a rally organised by the seven-party alliance in Kathmandu demanding the restoration of democracy.

 Activists sat cross-legged carrying red and white party flags and banners criticising the king and shouted slogans.

 Down with autocracy, long live democracy, participants shouted as party leaders vowed to intensify anti-king protests. The king says his move to take power was prompted by the failure of squabbling parties to quell the increasingly deadly Maoist revolt in which more than 12,500 people have died.

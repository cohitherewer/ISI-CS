 Jolie, Pitt in adoption rumour

 London, Nov 28: Is this a publicity stunt or is there more to the suggestion that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt may adopt a child following their visit to meet earthquake victims in Pakistan?

 Five separate public relations groups are involved in promoting a concert and fashion show at the Royal Albert Hall in London on December 13, aimed at raising a handsome sum for earthquake relief work. More than 73,000 died in the earthquake and millions were made homeless.

 There is as yet no confirmation that Jolie and Pitt, who are officially not even a couple but behaving in the way that Aishwarya Rai and Vivek Oberoi did when they were officially not a couple, will actually come to the concert.

 The couple has been promoting the new film done together, Mr and Mrs Smith. When they came off the flight in Tokyo recently, Pitt was seen cradling baby Zahara, Jolies adopted Ethiopian daughter. Jolie also has an adopted son, Maddox, four.

 Attempts are being made by the concert organisers in London to get them to send their blessings to the concert. 

 It is claimed they may adopt again in light of their trip, said one of the PR companies, which said it had picked this piece of intelligence from its client. 

 Jolie, who is an ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ? she and had undertaken 30 missions in this role, and Pitt met President Pervez Musharraf after touring the earthquake devastated areas.

 You watch TV and you see the pictures, but nobody sitting at home has any idea what this really looks like, she told a news conference in Islamabad afterwards.

 Its just unbelievable. You fly in a helicopter and you see ? one house after another ? just rubble, nothing standing. She has appealed for donors to make good their promised aid.

 The pledges need to materialise soon, she said. Because from what Im understanding, there are so many wonderful pledges of money that could come in the next few years but this winter is in the next few weeks, and so many people are in danger of possibly freezing to death. 

 Whether Jolies concern for the victims will translate into adopting another child remains to be seen. Some Hollywood celebrities have been accused in the past of treating adopted children almost as fashion accessories. 

 Pitt, meanwhile, has pledged to buy 40 orthopaedic beds at a cost of over $100,000. 

 The concert in London is being organised by Asia House, a cultural organisation, and the Asian Music Circuit, in association with the Pakistan Britain Trade and Investment Forum. Up to 5,000 tickets will be available at prices ranging from ?35 to ?10.

 This seems good value since artists performing will include Ghulam Ali, the famous ghazal maestro, and Nizami Brothers and Taufiq Niazi, quwaali singers from Delhi.

 Others include Garaj, made up of Waseem Niaz, Imran Ahmed and Karam Abbas, who fuse classical Pakistani sound with western music; Sajjad Ali and his Crazy Band, who mix contemporary Pakistani classical and pop music; and an Indian kathak group led by Gauri Sharma. 

 The fashion show is likely to feature the singer known as Lisa B. The BBC presenter, Michael Palin, well known for his travel programmes on the Himalayas, is also likely to come.

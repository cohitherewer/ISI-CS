 Big bets on little Lombard

 Dublin, April 3 (Reuters): An Irish bookmaker will start taking bets tomorrow on the likely successor to Pope John Paul, with candidates from Italy, Nigeria and Honduras the punters? favourites to lead the world?s 1.1 billion Catholics.

 Paddy Power has been offering odds on who will be the new Pope for several years, but suspended betting yesterday after the Pontiff?s death.

 ?We?ve taken it down for 24 hours as a mark of respect,? a Paddy Power spokesperson said. 

 The spokesperson, whose name is also Paddy Power, said the group had taken 1,500 to 2,000 bets on the future Pope. 

 The highest bet so far has been 1,000 euros ($1,296) on bookies? favourite Dionigi Tettamanzi at 5-1, but most of the bets taken have been small sums. 

 Odds on 71-year-old Tettamanzi being Pope now stand at 5-2. Cardinal-archbishop of Milan, Tettamanzi is top of the list of Italian candidates to succeed Pope John Paul II.

 An intellectual, former seminary rector and prolific writer who helped Pope John Paul write some of his encyclicals, the ?little Lombard? has many friends and few enemies.

 Nigeria?s Francis Arinze is the second choice at 11-4, followed by Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras at 4-1 and then Germany?s Joseph Ratzinger at 7-1.

 Arinze, 72, was the Vatican?s point man for relations with Islam for nearly 20 years. If elected, he would become the first African Pope in more than 1,500 years.

 At 62, Maradiaga is one of the youngest men to enter the conclave to elect a pope. Since popes usually rule for life, not everyone in the Church thinks the job should be given to someone who could hold it for 30 years or more if his health permits.

 Ratzinger, who will be 78 on April 16, has been doctrinal watchdog at the Vatican since 1981. His traditionalist judgments delight fellow conservatives and outrage liberal Catholics and members of other faiths.

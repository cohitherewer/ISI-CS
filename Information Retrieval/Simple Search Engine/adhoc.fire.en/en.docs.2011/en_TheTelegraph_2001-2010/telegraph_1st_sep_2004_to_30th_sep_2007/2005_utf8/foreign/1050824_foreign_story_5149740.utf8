 Daily Het Laatste Nieuws showed pictures of a dancing Johanne Vertommen being held up in the air by the missionary, and then clinging to him with her legs wrapped around his body. I wouldnt do this at home but at such occasions I get carried away by the enthusiasm of the group, the 29-year-old told the paper later.

 Bangla ferry

 Dhaka, Feb. 20 (Reuters): At least 79 people were killed and more than 120 were missing after a Bangladeshi ferry capsized in a storm on a river near the capital Dhaka, police and officials said today.

 The ferry M.V. Maharaj, which officials said was believed to have been carrying some 200 people, had been sailing to the southern town of Chandpur from Dhaka when it was caught in a tropical storm on the Buriganga river late yesterday.

 Only a few people were known to have survived.

 ?We have found 74 bodies, and search for more bodies is continuing,? Saiful Haque Khan, a director of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority supervising the rescue operation told Reuters.

 Most of the passengers and crew were feared drowned.?But we will not know the number of casualties until the ferry is fully salvaged,? an official on the scene told reporters.

 He said the exact number of people on board was unlikely to be determined as most Bangladeshi ferry companies do not keep passenger lists and often pack ships beyond their capacity.

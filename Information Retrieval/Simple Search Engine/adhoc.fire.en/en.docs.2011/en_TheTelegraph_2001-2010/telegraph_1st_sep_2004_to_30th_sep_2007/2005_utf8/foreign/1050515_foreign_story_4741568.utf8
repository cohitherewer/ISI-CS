 Hundreds feared killed in Uzbek town 

 Andizhan (Uzbekistan), May 14 (Reuters): Uzbek President Islam Karimov today blamed Islamic militants for violence in which troops fired on protesters and hundreds of people are alleged to have been killed.

 One human rights campaigner said the overall death toll today could have been as high as 500, which would make it the bloodiest incident in Uzbekistans post-Soviet history.

 The government of Uzbekistan, Central Asias most populous state, is an ally of both Moscow and of Washingtons war on terror and has been widely accused of severe repression of political opponents.

 Few observers expected the uprising in the eastern town of Andizhan to emulate the success of the March rebellion in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan which led to the overthrow of its president.

 In his first word on the violence in Andizhan, Karimov denied any order had been given to troops to open fire. He said rebels who seized a state building belonged to the outlawed Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. I know that you want to know who gave the order to fire at them... No one ordered (troops) to fire at them, a visibly angry Karimov said in the capital Tashkent.

 Karimov, in power since 1989, said 10 policemen and troops had been killed and 100 wounded.

 He said there was a higher number of rebel casualties, but made no mention of dead or wounded among protesters. He said the protesters were relatives of the 30 rebels who stationed them as human shields outside the building they took over.

 But a human rights campaigner in Andizhan, Saidzhakhon Zainabitdinov from the Uzbek rights group Appeal, said: The total number of deaths could reach 500 people from both sides.

 Most of the dead were killed by heavy machineguns mounted on armoured personnel carriers, he said, adding the streets were strewn with spent bullet-casings. A pro-Opposition reporter counted 30 corpses and a doctor spoke of many, many dead.

 A protest of around 1,000 people continued today, but the situation was calmer and fewer soldiers were on the streets, Zainabitdinov said.

 The violence in Uzbekistan follows unrest in March in Kyrgyzstan, where violent protests started in the city of Osh, just across the border from Andizhan, and led to the ousting of President Askar Akayev.

 Invisible force on the prowl

 Vatican City, April 17 (Reuters): The Holy Spirit who Roman Catholic cardinals believe will inspire them in next week?s conclave to choose a new Pope will not be the only invisible presence in the Vatican?s Sistine Chapel.

 You cannot see the state-of-the-art electronic jamming and anti-bugging devices ? but they are there.

 Everything is ready in the world?s most famous frescoed room for the secret conclave beginning tomorrow to elect a successor to Pope John Paul.

 While Michelangelo?s paintings of Biblical scenes are the same, the 115 cardinal electors who will be locked up in the chapel in the Vatican?s Apostolic Palace for some six hours a day will find some changes. A false floor made of wood and covered with new beige carpeting has been built about one metre off the ground in the larger portion of the two-part 15th century chapel.

 It is there under the new floor, a Swiss Guard official said during a pre-conclave visit yesterday, that the electronic jamming and debugging devices have been put. Out of sight but not out of mind.

 In fact, it was impossible to get a cell phone signal inside the chapel during the visit.

 The devices under the floor are part of an elaborate, high-tech clampdown around the conclave area to keep the proceedings secret and the cardinals cut off from the world.

 Cardinals will walk up a newly-built wooden ramp, equipped with handrails, to reach the new floor, which supports 12 long tables ? three sets of two along each of the two longer walls of the rectangular chapel.

 The cardinals will sit side-by-side at those tables while they debate and cast their ballots for the man who will be the 265th pope in the Catholic Church?s 2,000-year history.

 The ballots on which the cardinals write their vote and all tallying papers and notes will be burned in an old stove that was first used in the conclave of 1939 that elected Pius XII. The old wrought-iron cylindrical stove is engraved with the dates of the five previous conclaves and the names of the men who were elected.

 But there is now a modern addition. To the left of the old stove is a new electronic one.

 Its job is to provide the right amount of heat and air thrust so that everything works. The two copper flues from the stoves join into a single flue several metres off the ground and it reaches up to the ceiling. The second stove, which a Vatican statement called ?an auxiliary one to increase the visibility of the smoke?, includes an internal fan and an electronic panel with a row of buttons.

 But just in case, the Vatican plans to ring the great bells of St Peter?s Basilica when a Pope is elected.

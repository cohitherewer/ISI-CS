 Terror raid stalls US Saudi fest

 Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 13 (Reuters): Saudi security forces shot dead a man and arrested three in a raid on a suspected militant?s flat in Jeddah on Sunday, officials and witnesses said.

 They said a woman was also killed and five policemen were wounded in the early morning clashes at the apartment in the northern part of the Red Sea city. Officials said the woman was apparently a neighbour.

 In response to the shooting, the US said it was postponing tomorrow?s advance celebrations for the US Independence Day at its consulate in Jeddah, which was the target of a militant attack three months ago.

 The incident came less than a week after the US embassy in Saudi Arabia warned of a heightened threat in Jeddah.

 ?It was a raid to arrest wanted people classified as terrorists,? said interior ministry security spokesperson Brigadier-General Mansour Turki. He said security forces were fired at and may have been attacked with hand grenades. ?The wanted man was arrested after he was injured,? Turki said. ?Two of his companions were also arrested and another of his companions was killed?.

 Saudi Arabia has been battling al Qaeda militants for nearly two years. Despite recent successes by security forces, diplomats say militants may be planning further attacks in the world?s biggest oil exporter.

 Neighbours identified the dead man as Saed al-Youbi. Witnesses saw his bloodied body being carried out of the building after the shooting.

 Security sources said the raid took place after Saed?s relative Ibrahim al-Youbi, who was being followed by authorities, arrived in Jeddah and came to his apartment. Security forces tried to enter at 6.30 am (0330 GMT) but came under fire. Reinforcements arrived 30 minutes later and they stormed the building.

 Five members of the security forces were wounded, some of them seriously, witnesses who helped transport them to hospital told Reuters.

 Security sources in Jeddah said late on Saturday they were searching for a car seen circling suspiciously around the US consulate complex. The car had false number plates.

 Islamabad, June 1: Karachi remained tense today as a strike called by an Opposition religious alliance completely shut down Pakistans main business centre. 

 The strike was called by the six-party religious alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) to protest against Mondays deadly suicide bombing inside a Shia mosque and the assassination of a radical Jamaat-e-Islami activist.

 Public transport and private vehicles remained off the road and all major shopping malls remained closed today.

 There was thin attendance at offices and schools due to the lack of public transportation in most areas.

 President Pervez Musharraf imposed Americas war on Pakistan, putting lives of his own people at stake, MMA chief Qazi Hussein Ahmad said in Karachi while expressing satisfaction over the publics response to the strike call.

 Ahmad said the strike reflects the publics lack of confidence in the governments policies, adding that Musharraf is blindly following foreign powers and ignoring the security interests of his own country. Ahmad said Aslam Mujahids assassination shows the governments failure to protect life, honour and dignity of the people.

 Mujahid was kidnapped and later shot dead by an unknown person on Monday, the same day a suicide bomber and his two accomplices attacked a Shia mosque in Karachi, killing five and injuring 20.

 After the bombing, the port city was gripped by unrest that left at least six people dead after a KFC outlet was burnt down by protesters.

 Despite extra security, an angry mob attacked different parts of the town, setting ablaze vehicles and damaging public and private property. 

 According to police, more than 100 rioters were arrested till last night.

 Mondays suicide bombings took place after a decree issued two weeks ago by Pakistani religious clerics and scholars describing bombings on mosques as un-Islamic.

 On Friday last week, a suicide bomber killed 19 people and injured scores at a Shia religious gathering in Islamabad.

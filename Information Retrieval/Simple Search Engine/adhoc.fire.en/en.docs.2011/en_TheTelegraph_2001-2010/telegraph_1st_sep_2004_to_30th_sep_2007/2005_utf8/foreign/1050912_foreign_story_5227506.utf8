 N. Korea talks

 Seoul, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Six-party talks on ending North Koreas nuclear weapons programmes open on Tuesday in Beijing with Pyongyang having hardened its stance on its right to have a civilian programme ? a key sticking point in the discussions.

 The talks among the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the US headed into a recess on August 7 after failing to settle even on a statement of principles during 13 days of discussions in Beijing. Nobody should expect the DPRK to waive its right to peaceful nuclear activity, an official statement said. The Norths official name is the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.

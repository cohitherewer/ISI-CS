 Pak rejects report on sale of Iran nuke parts

 Islamabad, March 14 (Reuters): Pakistan rejected today reports it would hand over used centrifuge components to the UN nuclear watchdog to help it solve a key mystery surrounding Iran?s atomic programme.

 Diplomats familiar with a UN investigation into Iran?s nuclear programme said yesterday Islamabad had agreed to hand over the parts so UN inspectors could compare them with machinery sold to Iran by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan?s atomic bomb programme.

 ?That report is incorrect; that?s entirely baseless and speculative,? said Pakistan?s foreign ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani.

 Islamabad acknowledged for the first time last week that Khan, the disgraced nuclear scientist at the centre of a global atomic black market, provided Iran with centrifuges used to produce enriched uranium fuel for nuclear power plants or arms.

 A diplomat, who asked not to be named, said in Vienna at the weekend that the centrifuges could hold crucial fingerprints, or ?the DNA? of uranium traces found on equipment in Iran.

 In 2003, the UN?s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found traces of uranium in Iran that had been enriched to various levels, some of them close to what would be useable in weapons.

 This sparked fears that Tehran?s secret centrifuge programme had been used to purify uranium for atomic weapons.

 Iran blamed the traces on contaminated centrifuge components it acquired second-hand from Pakistan. But Islamabad?s refusal to allow IAEA experts to take environmental samples inside the country has prevented the IAEA from verifying Iran?s explanation. 

 An IAEA spokesman in Vienna declined to comment on whether Pakistan would provide the centrifuge parts, but two diplomats close to the agency said they would arrive soon. Analysts say Pakistan?s admission that Khan gave Iran centrifuges appeared to be the result of US pressure ahead of a visit to Islamabad this week by US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.

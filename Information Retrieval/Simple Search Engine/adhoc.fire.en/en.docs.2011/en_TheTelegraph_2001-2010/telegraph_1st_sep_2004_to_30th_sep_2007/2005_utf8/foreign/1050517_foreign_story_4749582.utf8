 Andizhan (Uzbekistan), May 16 (Reuters): Uzbek authorities are likely to carry out mass arrests of protesters who staged an uprising that ended in a massacre when troops opened fire, a leading human rights campaigner said today.

 The rebellion in Andizhan on Friday, sparked by the trial of 23 Muslim businessmen and blamed by President Islam Karimov on Islamic extremists, was put down by security forces in the bloodiest chapter in the countrys post-Soviet history.

 The prosecutors office in Tashkent said a formal investigation had been launched into murders and the organisation of mass unrest in Andizhan.

 According to witnesses interviewed by Reuters in Andizhan, soldiers outside a school gunned down a large crowd, including women, children and 10 police hostages, that was moving away from a main square where the shooting started.

 It was a massacre, said a 31-year-old cobbler who witnessed the killing outside School No. 15 from a side-street. This sickening smell of blood, smashed brains, guts, and blood, blood, everywhere. I could not put my feet on a dry spot.

 I saw soldiers killing several wounded with single shots to the head after asking are there any wounded around, he said.

 He said he saw about 500 corpses. He said he did not want to be named as he had been detained twice by the security services. 

 His statement could not be verified but it corroborated others.

 Saidzhakhon Zainabitdinov of Uzbek rights group Appeal said a wave of repression was likely to follow.

 One can now only expect massive arrests and the elimination of those opposing the regime, he said in Andizhan.

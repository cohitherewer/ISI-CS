 Pak Hindu couple held for defiling Quran

 Islamabad, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Pakistani police arrested a Hindu couple on charges of desecrating a Quran, officials said today.

 The man identified as Chaman Lal and his wife were arrested near the conservative northwestern town of Swabi yesterday after neighbours complained to the police they had thrown a copy of the Quran in a field near their house.

 We have arrested the couple and we are holding an investigation, local police chief Atta Mohammad said.

 After an investigation, we will send their case to the court and they will be punished according to the law of the land, if they are found guilty, he added.

 Residents and newspapers said other members of the Lal family had been moved to a safe place after a mob ransacked their house. But Mohammad denied the house was attacked.

 Blasphemy, including desecrating the Quran, is a capital offence in Muslim Pakistan and carries the death sentence.

 Such cases are relatively common in the country, but death sentences have never been carried out because convictions have always been turned down by high courts.

 However, several people accused of committing blasphemy have been killed by religious zealots in the past. Human rights groups and non-Muslim minorities want the blasphemy law to be struck off the books saying it is often abused by people to settle personal scores.

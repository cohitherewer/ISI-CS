 Monument dispute splits court

 Washington, June 27 (Reuters): A divided US Supreme Court declared today it was unconstitutional to post framed copies of the Ten Commandments in county courthouses but permissible to have a commandments monument on the grounds of a state Capitol.

 The two 5-4 rulings on the the politically charged issue involving Ten Commandments displays on government property came in a pair of cases that have been widely regarded as the most important of the court term concerning church-state separation.

 In one decision, the high court ruled that Kentucky officials went too far by posting framed copies of the Ten Commandments on the walls of the courthouses in McCreary and Pulaski counties.

 Part of the distinction between the two rulings turned on the intent of government officials concerning the displays and whether they conveyed a religious message. A number of legal battles have taken place around the country over displays of the Ten Commandments on government property.

 Nobel for unafraid nuke fight

 Oslo, Oct. 7 (Reuters): The UN nuclear watchdog and its head, Mohamed ElBaradei, who clashed with Washington over Iraq, won the Nobel Peace Prize today for fighting the spread of nuclear weapons.

 The Nobel Committee praised the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and ElBaradei, a 63-year-old Egyptian, for their battle to stop states and terrorists acquiring the atom bomb and to ensure safe civilian use of nuclear energy.

 In Vienna, ElBaradei (seen reacting to the prize with tearful eyes in AFP picture on left) said the award, first given in 1901, would give him and his agency a much needed shot in the arm as they tackle nuclear crises in Iran and North Korea.

 ElBaradei said he had been sure he would not win, despite being a favourite from a list of 199 candidates, because he had not received the traditional advance telephone call from the Nobel Committee. He learnt of his win from the television.

 Congratulations came from world leaders like Britains Tony Blair and Frances Jacques Chirac, who said he was delighted. Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the 1990 laureate, praised ElBaradei for doing his job solidly and responsibly.

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, also a peace laureate, called it a welcome reminder of the acute need to make progress on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.

 The IAEA has had little success in recent standoffs with Iran and North Korea and ElBaradei has faced criticism from many quarters, most recently from both the US and Iran, in his efforts to investigate Tehrans nuclear programme. Washington had opposed his reappointment to a new term.

 He came to prominence before the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 by challenging Washingtons argument that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found after the overthrow of Saddam. 

 Some experts say the IAEA has achieved too little in North Korea and Iran to merit the prize. ElBaradei is unbowed.

 There have been two nuclear shocks to the world already, ElBaradei once said. The Chernobyl accident and the IAEAs discovery of Iraqs clandestine nuclear weapons programme. It is vital we do all in our power to prevent a third.

 The Nobel Committee, acknowledging the worlds lack of progress in nuclear disarmament, expressed hope that this award would spur work to outlaw atomic weapons 60 years after the US bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

 ElBaradei was an unaf- raid advocate of measures to strengthen non-proliferation, the committee said. 

 Other contenders for the prize had ranged from presidents to Irish rock star Bono.

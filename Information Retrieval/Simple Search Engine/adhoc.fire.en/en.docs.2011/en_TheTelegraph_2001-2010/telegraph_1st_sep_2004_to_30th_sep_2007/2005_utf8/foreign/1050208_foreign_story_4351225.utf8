 W. Asia rivals in peace meet

 Ariel Sharon

 Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt), Feb. 7 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will try to end four years of bloodshed and take a step back towards negotiations at a summit in Egypt tomorrow.

 The highest-level meeting between the two sides since near the start of the Palestinian uprising in 2000 aims to seal a fragile calm and prepare the ground for reviving a US-backed ?road map? for a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.

 Adding force to any announcement from the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh will be the presence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who invited the leaders, and Jordan?s King Abdullah.

 Hopes for an end to decades of conflict have shot higher since Abbas was elected last month to succeed late leader Yasser Arafat and managed to coax a de facto truce from militants.

 But armed factions have fallen short of declaring a formal ceasefire, while neither side shows signs of budging on key issues obstructing a peace deal like borders and whether Palestinian refugees get a ?right of return? to Israel.

 ?This is a time in which we expect we have opportunities for peace,? US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said after meeting Israeli and Palestinian leaders.

 ?It does not guarantee that there will be the positive outcome for which we all hope. That is what the parties have to work toward,? she said in Tel Aviv, ending a West Asia visit today that showed Washington?s new engagement.

 Rice said Abbas and Sharon had accepted an invitation to the White House in the spring. She also named a US general as security coordinator, underscoring a view that hopes of ending the conflict rest on stopping the bloodshed first.

 Washington, like its Israeli ally, had long accused Arafat of fomenting violence ? despite his denials ? and President George W. Bush refused to meet him.

 Israeli and Palestinian officials alike say they would like tomorrow?s summit to bring a formal end to the violence that erupted in 2000 when talks collapsed for a Palestinian state on land occupied by Israel in the 1967 West Asia war.

 But the vital agreement of militant groups for declaring a ceasefire remains in doubt.

 The factions have said Israel?s promise to free 900 out of 8,000 Palestinian prisoners ? not including those convicted of deadly attacks ? to pull back troops from some West Bank cities and to stop targeting top militants are not enough.

 ?We will determine our position only when we receive Israeli commitments and guarantees,? said Sami Abu Zuhri of Hamas. If violence does stop and Palestinians rein in militants, as they are meant to under the road map, Israel would like to coordinate with Abbas on its plan to withdraw settlers from Gaza.

 Palestinians fear the pullout is meant to cement an Israeli hold on the West Bank and say Israel must abide by a road map commitment to freeze settlement growth in the territory. Many more traps lie on the road to a final peace deal and the two sides are far apart on fundamental issues.

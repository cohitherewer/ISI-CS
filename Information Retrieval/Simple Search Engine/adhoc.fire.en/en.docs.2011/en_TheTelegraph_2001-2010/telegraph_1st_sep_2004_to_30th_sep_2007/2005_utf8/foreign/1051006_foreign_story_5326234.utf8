 Film fuels McCarthy paranoia

 George Clooney

 Los Angeles, Oct. 5 (Reuters): History has not been kind to Senator Joseph McCarthy. 

 Since his death from alcoholism in 1957, he has grown into a symbol of government run amok ? the witch-hunter feeding on rumour and innuendo, a hero for some but a reckless villain for many others.

 A new film,Good Night, and Good Luck, which opens on Friday, about McCarthys 1954 television showdown with CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, pointedly does nothing to improve the Wisconsin senators reputation, but it just might make him a star.

 The films director, actor George Clooney, half-jokingly suggests that he may organise a campaign to get McCarthy nominated for best supporting actor since all the scenes of him in the movie come from actual videotapes made when he held sway in Congress in the early 1950s, hunting communists and traitors and fuelling Cold War paranoia.

 The film, an examination of the limits of democracy and even plain human decency in a time of political stress, is certain to win kudos and award nominations for its star, David Strathairn, who plays newsman Murrow in a feat closer to channelling a ghost than acting.

 The 90-minute, black and white film tells of Murrows decision to expose McCarthys misuse of power in a now classic 1954 See it Now programme in which he used the senators own words to paint a portrait of a bullying demagogue at work. 

 Many credit that programme as the start of McCarthys fall from grace.

 We decided to use McCarthy, the way Murrow did. If we used an actor, people would say he was too oafish or too large. 

 It was better to let him do it in his own words and it was much cheaper, Clooney said in a recent interview.

 He joked that he tried to launch such a campaign to get Matt Damon named Sexiest Man Alive, but the ad was rejected by the Hollywood Reporter on the grounds that it was clearly a spoof.

 Jokes or half-jokes aside, the film has a darker subtext for it argues that Murrow and television paid a huge price for taking on McCarthy, a price it is paying even today.

 For Clooney, the story of television news is of a battle between a networks desire to make money by entertaining viewers and effort to meet its less-profitable obligation to inform the public of important news.

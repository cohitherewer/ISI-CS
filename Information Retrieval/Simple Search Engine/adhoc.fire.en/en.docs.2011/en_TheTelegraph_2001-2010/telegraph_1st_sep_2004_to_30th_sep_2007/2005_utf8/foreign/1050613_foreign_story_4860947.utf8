 Washington, June 12 (Reuters): A senior official at the White House council on environmental quality has resigned, days after a newspaper reported he changed some reports to downplay links between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.

 Philip Cooney, the councils chief of staff and a former energy industry lobbyist, resigned on Friday, two days after The New York Times reported he edited some descriptions of climate research in a way that cast doubt on links between greenhouse gas emissions and rising temperatures.

 White House spokeswoman Dana Perino confirmed Cooney had resigned from the council but said it was unrelated to the Times story.

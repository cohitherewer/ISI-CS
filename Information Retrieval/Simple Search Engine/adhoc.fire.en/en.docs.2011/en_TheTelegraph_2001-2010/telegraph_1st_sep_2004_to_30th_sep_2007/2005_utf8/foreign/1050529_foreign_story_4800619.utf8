 Oliver Stone arrested on drug charges

 Oliver Stone

 Beverly Hills, May 28 (AP): Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone was arrested for investigation of drug possession and driving while intoxicated, police said today.

 Stone 58, was arrested last night at a police checkpoint on Sunset Boulevard after showing signs of alcohol intoxication, police Sergeant John Emundson said. A search of his Mercedes turned up drugs, Edmundson said. He did not specify what kind.

 Stone was released this morning after posting $15,000 bail. 

 In 1999, the filmmaker pleaded guilty to drug possession and no contest to driving under the influence and was ordered into a rehabilitation programme. Stones films include the recent Alexander, JFK (1991) and Natural Born Killers (1994). He won an Oscar for best direction in 1989 for Born on the Fourth of July.

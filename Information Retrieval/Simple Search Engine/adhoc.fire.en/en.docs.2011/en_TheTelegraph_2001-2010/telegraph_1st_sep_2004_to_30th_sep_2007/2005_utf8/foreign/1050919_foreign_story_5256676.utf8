 Streisand squeals admiration for Clinton

 New York, Sept. 18: If there was any doubt that Bill Clinton still elicits the adoration of women, Barbra Streisand was on hand last week to squash it.

 As the former US President laid out his agenda for world change from a podium flanked by Tony Blair, Condoleezza Rice and King Abdullah of Jordan, the singer-actor emitted a series of gentle but disconcerting squeals of approval, interspersed with admiring sighs.

 Hers was typical of the audience reaction at the of the modestly named Clinton Global Initiative in New York.

 Streisand and her husband, the actor James Brolin, were at the glitzy gathering of international leaders, old White House allies, business chiefs, showbiz celebrities and Third World campaigners, aimed at solving the worlds most pressing problems.

 In fact, they made more concrete progress than the UN summit held just across town. 

 Clinton required all participants to contribute time or money to one of four critical challenges ? poverty, religious conflict, climate change and good governance. 

 Tom Hunter, a Scottish entrepreneur turned philanthropist, made one of the biggest donations: $100 million. 

 Streisand, a prominent Hollywood liberal, was thrilled. This is such a great idea, she said. I think Bills great and hes doing such an important thing here. 

 Clinton has taken post-presidential activism to new levels. In addition to the Global Initiative, he has raised money for the victims of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina and overseen other aid projects funded by his foundation. 

 So impressed was Streisand that she suggested America change the Constitution to allow him to run again for the White House.

 Clinton returned the compliment later, at a reception in the Nobu restaurant. Barbra is a great woman and good friend, he said. 

 She was also fantastic to my mother. She met her at my inauguration in 1993 and when she heard she was ill, she called her and invited her to her show in Las Vegas.

 Former Clinton cabinet ministers and staffers rubbed shoulders with 40 heads of government, several prominent Republicans and the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, who sang the former Presidents praises as he discussed the role of religion in conflicts.

 But the greatest beneficiary of the praise and of the high profile for the Clinton brand may prove to be his wife, who as the junior senator for New York state joined a discussion of climate change.

 If Streisands dream of a Clinton return to the White House comes true, it will be Hillary who leads the way ? with her husband as the first First Gentleman.

 Spears sizzles on Net

 Los Angeles, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Britney Spears reclaimed the top spot on Yahoos annual list of the most-searched for terms on the Internet, with all 10 top positions coming from the world of entertainment.

 Spears has been number one for three of the last four years, unseated last year by the search for American Idol, Yahoo said yesterday. The list shows us that people are fixated on the activities of pop culture icons, said Erik Gunther, guru of what Yahoo calls its Buzz Index.

 Rounding out the Top 10 list, in order, are 50 Cent, Cartoon Network, Mariah Carey, Green Day, Jessica Simpson, Paris Hilton, Eminem, Ciara and Lindsay Lohan.

 Gunther said that it was consumer interest in Cartoon Networks line-up of raunchier fare known as Adult Swim that made it the only non-human to crack the Top 10 list. Searchers of still-photos on the Internet were most interested in Simpson, Hilton, Spears, Lohan and Jolie, while video searchers went for Spears, Simpson and 50 Cent.

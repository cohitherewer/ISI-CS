 Bold Brazil brothels

 Sao Paulo (Brazil), Sept. 22 (Reuters): Two high-class brothels hoping to attract racers and pit crews in Sundays Brazilian Grand Prix were shut down after they posted sexually explicit advertisements on 30 billboards around South Americas largest city.

 Sao Paulo mayor Jose Serra demanded the billboards be covered with blank white sheets and his code enforcement officers sealed doorways to the brothels, Romanza and Cafe Millenium, with concrete blocks. 

 Guinea pig sets record

 London (Reuters): Sooty has set a new 

 world record for the most Valentine cards sent to a guinea 

 pig. The three-year-old guinea pig from Wales received 206 

 cards from as far away as New Zealand to gain a bizarre 

 entry in the latest edition of Guinness World Records 

 published on Thursday.

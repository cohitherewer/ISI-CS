 Google faces nude picture suit

 Los Angeles, Aug. 25 (AFP): The publisher of a US mens magazine has sued Google, alleging that the Internet search giant is infringing on copyright by displaying thousands of pictures of nude women.

 Perfect 10 magazine said in a statement yesterday that it was seeking a preliminary injunction against Google to enjoin Google from copying, displaying and distributing Perfect 10 copyrighted images.

 The magazine said it had already filed a complaint against Google in November 2004 claiming the Web giant is displaying hundreds of thousands of adult images, from the most tame to the most exceedingly explicit, to draw massive traffic to its website, which it is converting into hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising revenue.

 Snooping on UK smokers

 CELIA HALL

 Fume watch

 London, June 21: New powers effectively criminalising smoking in public were announced by the government yesterday, with the minister in charge promising an intelligence-led approach to enforcing the law.

 Informers will be encouraged to report breaches of sweeping bans on the habit, in which company smoking rooms will be outlawed and places such as bus shelters and the outsides of office blocks made no-smoking areas. The ban may also cover sports stadiums that are not fully enclosed.

 There will be ?200 fines for breaches and penalties for companies that fail to display No Smoking signs in areas newly outlawed. Individuals who offend face fines of ?50.

 It is thought that establishments which attract repeated complaints could be subject to sting operations by council enforcers.

 Caroline Flint, the public health minister, confirmed that the policy would be vigorously enforced with the assistance of informers from the public.

 I dont think we are talking about brigades of people out on the streets, she said. What we are talking about is an intelligence-led approach to enforcing the law. The burden of enforcement would fall on councils, which will receive extra money for the task, with informers calling a telephone hotline manned by officials.

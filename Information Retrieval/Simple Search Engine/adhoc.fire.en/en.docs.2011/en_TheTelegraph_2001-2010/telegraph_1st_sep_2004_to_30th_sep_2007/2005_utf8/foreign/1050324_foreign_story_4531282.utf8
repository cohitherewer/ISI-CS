 Song of hope

 Jerusalem, March 23 (Reuters): Israeli and Palestinian singers will perform a love song in Hebrew and Arabic on each side?s public radio stations on Sunday, hoping it will help inspire peacemaking after years of bloodshed.

 The bilingual In My Heart, to be sung by Israeli David Broza and Palestinian Wisam Murad, will be broadcast simultaneously on the official Voice of Palestine radio and Israel?s Army Radio.

 ?It?s a big issue for Israelis to hear an Arab sing on Army Radio, and the Voice of Palestine has never before broadcast a song in Hebrew. It?s a breakthrough for coexistence,? Brozas media adviser Nir Gontarz said.

 He said peace hopes raised by an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire summit had encouraged both singers to risk controversy for the cause of reconciliation.

 ?It?s about love and peace, and we are not against peace,? said Voice of Palestine director Bassem Abu Sumaya. 

 ?We echo the political environment. If there?s violence, we cover the facts on the ground. If it?s quiet, we can air recreational programmes and songs.? 

 Bird block

 Beijing (Reuters): China imported a 

 US-made scream machine to scare away the birds at Beijing 

 airport ? except they didn?t recognise the noises and refused 

 to budge. The bird-dispersing equipment had recorded the 

 screams of American birds or the sounds of the birds? natural 

 enemies, the Beijing Evening News said. ?Local birds 

 did not understand the foreign language,? the newspaper 

 said. So Chinese experts ?translated? the US bird noises 

 into those of their Chinese counterparts. ?The workers have 

 already recorded six or seven bird screams which are common 

 in Beijing,? it said, adding that the new scare tactics 

 were undergoing tests.

 Cute clock

 London (Reuters): Can?t get out of bed in the morning? Scientists at MIT?s Media Lab in the US have invented an alarm clock called Clocky to make even the doziest sleepers, who repeatedly hit the snooze button, leap out of bed. After the snooze button is pressed, the clock, which is equipped with a set of wheels, rolls off the table to another part of the room. ?When the alarm sounds again, simply finding Clocky ought to be strenuous enough to prevent even the doziest owner from going back to sleep,? New Scientist magazine said on Tuesday.

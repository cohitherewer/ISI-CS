 Watergate opens notes

 Austin (Texas), Feb. 4: Thousands of pages of notes, memos, transcripts and other materials collectively known as the Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers opened to the public today at the University of Texas, minus the most fascinating detail connected to the demise of the Nixon administration: the identity of Deep Throat.

 The name of the executive branch source ? as well as dozens of other confidential sources ? will remain secret until their deaths, as promised to them by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, whose reporting for The Washington Post led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.

 ?We would have thought many of these people would be dead by now, but people just live longer,? Woodward, an assistant managing editor at The Post, said at a media briefing on the papers, archived at the university?s Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center. 

 But what is in the collection reveals publicly for the first time that even Nixon?s closest aides and senior Republicans on Capitol Hill shared ?doubts, worries and suspicions? about Nixon. They were concerned, Woodward said, both about the President?s involvement in the criminal Watergate cover-up and his fragile psychological state toward the end of his presidency.

 As Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona so succinctly said about Nixon, according to the newly available documents: ?I began to think that he was off his head? and ?lying all the way through.? 

 The collection was culled from 75 file-drawer-size boxes accumulated during Woodward and Bernstein?s reporting and writing for The Post, for the book and movie versions of All the President?s Men and for the book The Final Days. 

 The documents range from Woodward?s hand-scribbled notes from the preliminary court hearing for the five men arrested on June 17, 1972, after a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarter to 42 pages of typed notes gleaned from eight extensive interviews with one of Nixon?s principal Watergate lawyers, J. Fred Buzhardt.

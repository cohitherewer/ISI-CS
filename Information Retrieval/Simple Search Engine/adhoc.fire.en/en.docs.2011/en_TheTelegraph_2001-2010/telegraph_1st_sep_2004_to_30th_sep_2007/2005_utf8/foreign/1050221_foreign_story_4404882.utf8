 Laidback Laura switches to party mode

 PHILIP SHERWELL

 Laura: Confident

 Washington, Feb. 20: A dramatic shift in policy is afoot at the White House, but it has nothing to do with the political plans of President George W. Bush.

 While the building?s West Wing is synonymous with political intrigue, this second-term revolution is being orchestrated from the First Lady?s base in the normally sedate East Wing.

 Bush?s wife, Laura, has sacked the White House chef, installed a new social secretary and told her famously early-to-bed husband that they are going to throw more parties during this term.

 The new order began last week with a Valentine?s Day dinner for 60 guests.

 Laura Bush is overseeing the recruitment of a new executive chef after firing Walter Scheib III, who had held the post since 1994. The new chef will need to be able to turn his hand to everything from grand receptions to the humbler demands of Bush, who is partial to peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

 Laura?s quest for a new face in the kitchen has assumed added importance after it was revealed that the First Lady ? an extremely popular figure in her husband?s re-election campaign ? has insisted on a more sociable White House.

 ?I think she is really coming into her own now. She seems to be blossoming,? said Sally Quinn, a writer who chronicles Washington?s social scene. ?She, I?m sure, is partially responsible for him being re-elected. I think that she knows that. Everybody knows that. She gets an A-plus, and that?s given her enormous confidence.?

 Scheib, 50, was recruited by Hillary Clinton to usher in an era of New American cooking, replacing the French cuisine that had dominated for so long. His menu for the Bushes? last state dinner, for Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki, in October 2003, featured a salad of avocado and tomato in toasted cumin dressing, grilled halibut, bay scallop risotto and lobster sauce, roasted rack of lamb, sweet potato flan and vegetables.

 He acknowledged, however, that his dishes were not to Laura Bush?s taste. ?We?ve been trying to find a way to satisfy the First Lady?s stylistic requirements and it has been difficult,? he said. ?Basically, I was not successful in my first attempt.?

 The Bushes hosted just four state dinners in their first four years ? the same number thrown by President George Bush senior and his wife Barbara in their first six months. The Clintons and the Reagans were renowned for their parties and love of socialising.

 Laura?s new social secretary, Lea Berman, is married to a prominent Washington lobbyist and Bush fund-raiser. She has also brought in a new chief of staff, Anita McBride, who was director of White House personnel for George Bush senior. 

 Whether she can persuade the President, a teetotal former heavy drinker, to stay awake beyond his preferred 9.30pm, only time will tell.

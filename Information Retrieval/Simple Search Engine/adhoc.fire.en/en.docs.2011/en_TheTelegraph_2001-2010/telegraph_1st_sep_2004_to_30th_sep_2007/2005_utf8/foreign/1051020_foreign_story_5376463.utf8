 Hurricane Wilma takes aim at US

 Washington, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Hurricane Wilma, which triggered mudslides that killed up to 10 people in Haiti, has strengthened to a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it approaches western Cuba and Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula.

 The seasons record-tying 21st storm, fuelled by the warm waters of the northwest Caribbean Sea, strengthened alarmingly as it headed into the Gulf of Mexico on a path expected to lead across storm-weary southern Florida by Saturday.

 An Air Force plane measured maximum sustained winds of near 280 kmph from the vicious storm, the centre reported at 0900 GMT today. The storm was moving west-northwest at 13 kmph.

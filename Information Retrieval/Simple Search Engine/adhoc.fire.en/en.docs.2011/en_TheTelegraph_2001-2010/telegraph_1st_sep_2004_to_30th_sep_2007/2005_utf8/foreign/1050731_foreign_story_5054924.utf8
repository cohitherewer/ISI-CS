 Saddam assault

 Amman, July 30 (Reuters): Lawyers for Saddam Hussein said today their client was attacked by an unidentified man during a court appearance in Baghdad this week, but US forces guarding him denied any such incident took place.

 A statement issued by Saddams international legal team Jordan, said the former President was attacked and exchanged blows with another person in a hearing attended by Saddams main lawyer Khalil Dulaimi, on Thursday.

 As the President (Saddam) stood to leave the courtroom one of those present attacked him and there was an exchange of blows between the man and the President, the statement said, adding that the head of the tribunal did nothing to stop the assault.

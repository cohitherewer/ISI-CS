 Diaz sues 

tabloid for cheat slur

 Cameron Diaz

 Los Angeles, June 3 (Reuters): Cameron Diaz has sued The National Enquirer tabloid for more than $10 million over a story that accused her of cheating on boyfriend Justin Timberlake.

 The libel suit, filed in Santa Monica Superior Court on Wednesday, says the newspaper turned an innocent, insignificant and non-memorable occurrence involving co-workers and friends into a sensationalistic, scandalous and accusatory story which was completely false.

 In a May 23 cover story headlined Cameron Caught Cheating, the tabloid published photos and said Diaz kissed MTV producer Shane Nickerson outside a Los Angeles studio. 

 Diaz says that she briefly hugged Nickerson, who works on her television show Trippin, and other co-workers while saying goodbye, and that there was no kissing. National Enquirer spokesperson Stu Zakim said: We stand behind our reporting.

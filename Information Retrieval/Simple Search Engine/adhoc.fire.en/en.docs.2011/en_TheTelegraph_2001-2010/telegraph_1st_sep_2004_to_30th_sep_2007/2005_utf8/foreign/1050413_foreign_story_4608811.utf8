 US Iraq warning

 Baghdad, April 12 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld issued a terse warning to Iraq?s new leaders today urging them to avoid political purges or favouritism that could lead to charges of corruption in the new government.

 On his ninth visit to Iraq since the 2003 invasion, Rumsfeld also warned against delays in the political process, particularly the drafting of a new constitution. ?It?s important that the new government be attentive to the competence of the people in the ministries and that they avoid unnecessary turbulence,? he said on his plane before arriving at dawn for the unannounced visit. Rumsfeld expressed particular concern about possible purges of Iraq?s defence and interior ministries, which are at the heart of efforts to gradually put Iraqi security forces in charge of battling the country?s Sunni-led insurgency.

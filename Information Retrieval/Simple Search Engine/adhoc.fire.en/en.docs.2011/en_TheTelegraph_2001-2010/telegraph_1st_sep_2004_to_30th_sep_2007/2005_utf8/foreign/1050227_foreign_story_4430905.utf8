 TV time delay plan angers Oscars

 Los Angeles, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Oscar organisers yesterday blasted television network ABC for broadcasting the star-filled Academy Award telecast with a time delay, dismissing it as a ?terrible idea? and a concession to political correctness.

 The choice of comedian Chris Rock as host has the network, owned by The Walt Disney Co. and the only broadcaster to air the show in the US, nervous about offensive language hitting the American airwaves.

 Federal regulators may boost fines for US broadcasters following last year?s Super Bowl ?wardrobe malfunction? by singer Janet Jackson in which she bared her breast. 

 Earlier this month the US House of Representatives voted to raise the maximum indecency fine to as much as $500,000 from $32,500.

 Rock has already unnerved the Hollywood establishment by joking that straight black men do not watch the Oscars, and his stand-up comedy acts are laden with obscenities. 

 Still, he is popular with young audiences that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which gives out the Oscars, is eager to attract.

 ?I do not like a time delay,? Oscar show producer Gil Cates said on the famed red carpet leading to the awards venue, the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.

 ?I?m very happy I?m not the person who has to push that button and decide the difference between something that may be out of step in terms of what the culture thinks is appropriate and something thats political,? Cates added. 

 ?My feeling is it?s a terrible idea but it?s ABC?s network.?

 Cates said he thought images would hit TV screens seven seconds after they happened, which was the time delay ABC instituted last year.

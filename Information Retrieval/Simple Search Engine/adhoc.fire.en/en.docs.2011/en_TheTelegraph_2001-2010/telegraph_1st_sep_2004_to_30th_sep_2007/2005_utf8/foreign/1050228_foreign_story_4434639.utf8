 Moscow, Tehran ink nuke fuel deal

 Putin

 Tehran, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Russia and Iran today signed a nuclear fuel supply deal long opposed by Washington, paving the way for Iran to start its first atomic reactor next year.

 The agreement, inked by the two countries? nuclear energy chiefs at the Bushehr atomic plant in southern Iran, came as Tehran faced heightened pressure from the US, which accuses it of secretly developing nuclear weapons.

 ?This is a very important incident in ties between the two countries and in the near future a number of Russian experts will be sent to Bushehr to equip the power station,? Iranian state television quoted Alexander Rumyantsev, head of Russia?s Federal Atomic Energy Agency, as saying.

 A key part of the agreement obliges Tehran to repatriate all spent nuclear fuel to Russia. Moscow hopes this will allay US worries that Iran may use the spent fuel, which could be reprocessed into bomb-grade plutonium, to develop arms.

 But a leading Senator said the US should seek to bar Russia from this year?s G8 summit to protest against Moscow?s actions including the fuel deal. ?The United States and our European allies should start out by saying, ?Vladimir, you?re not welcome at the next G8 conference?,? said Senator John McCain. The next summit of the G8 nations, which includes Russia, will be held in Scotland in July.

 The White House had no immediate comment on the signing of the supply agreement.

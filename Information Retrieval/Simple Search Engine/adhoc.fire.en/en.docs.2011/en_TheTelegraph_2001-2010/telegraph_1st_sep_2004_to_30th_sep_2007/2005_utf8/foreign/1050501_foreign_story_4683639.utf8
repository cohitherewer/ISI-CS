 Cairo raids on tourists, two killed

 Cairo, April 30 (Reuters): A bomber and two veiled women attacked tourists in separate incidents that killed two people in Cairo today, targeting a museum and a tourist bus, official sources said.

 An Egyptian man was killed and seven people injured near the museum in what Cairo?s security chief said was a suicide attack.

 In the other attack ? the first in living memory by women in Egypt ? the two veiled women opened fire on the bus in southern Cairo but missed, Cairo?s security director Nabil el-Azabi said. One of the women then shot dead the other and the second was wounded, possibly by herself.

 Those injured in the bombing were three Egyptians, an Israeli couple, one Italian woman and a Swedish man, the official sources added. ?They are in stable condition,? said tourism minister Ahmed el-Maghrabi.

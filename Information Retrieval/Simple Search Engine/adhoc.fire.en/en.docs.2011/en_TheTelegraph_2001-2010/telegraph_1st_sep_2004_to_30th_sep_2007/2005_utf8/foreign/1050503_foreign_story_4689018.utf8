 Iraq barely dents Blair ratings

 Tony Blair: On course

 London, May 2 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair?s opinion poll lead was barely dented today, putting him firmly on track to win Thursday?s election despite accusations from the Opposition he deceived Britons on Iraq.

 In the final days of campaigning, Blair ? seeking a third successive term ? is expected to target the Labour Party?s most vulnerable seats. Party officials are concerned that anger over his support for the Iraq war could slash his huge parliamentary majority.

 The Prime Minister is expected to team up with finance minister Gordon Brown this week in an effort to try to shift the attention of voters onto Labour?s preferred battleground, the economy, which has been buoyant since he came to power in 1997.

 But the death of a British soldier in Iraq today ensured Iraq remained an issue at Blair?s agenda. 

 A YouGov poll for the Daily Telegraph newspaper put Labour on 36 per cent, the main Opposition Conservatives on 33 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 24 per cent. The figures suggest Blair is on course to win the election but with a substantially reduced parliamentary majority from his current 161 seats.

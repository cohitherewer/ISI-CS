 Crushing conclave

 Vatican City, April 13 (Reuters): Electing a pope used to be so difficult cardinals were punished with isolation, starvation rations and cramped quarters to get them to finish quickly. Some died before they reached the final ballot.

 The search for a new leader of the world?s 1.1 billion Roman Catholics to succeed Pope John Paul starts on Monday and is expected to last a few days ? a far cry from past conclaves that could be long and dangerous ordeals.

 The word ?conclave?, ?with a key?, dates back to the protracted election of Celestine IV in 1241 when cardinals were locked up in a crumbling palace by Roman noble Matteo Orsini. 

 Aimed at forcing a decision in the sweltering August heat, the lock-up led to the death of one of the 10 confined cardinals, who eventually reached a decision after two months. The effects of the confinement were such that Celestine himself died after only two weeks.

 Worse was to come. In 1268, in the town of Viterbo, 85 km north of Rome, cardinals began what proved to be the longest conclave in the history of the Roman Catholic Church.

 While John Paul?s successor could be chosen in a matter of days, it took three years to settle on Gregory X in September 1271. 

 After two years, restive locals rioted, removing the roof from the palace where the cardinals were gathered ? supposedly to let the Holy Spirit join them ? and food was restricted. Again conditions were so harsh, two cardinals died and a third had to leave due to ill health before the remaining princes of the church chose the new Pope.

 Gregory X was determined the ordeal would never happen again. He was behind a ruling in 1274 that in future cardinals would be locked in a single room with an adjoining lavatory in the late Pope?s palace within 10 days of his death.

 After three days, if no Pope was elected, they would be served only one dish for lunch and supper instead of two. 

 After five days, they would be given only bread, water and a little wine until they decided on a new Pontiff.

 The tribulations of the 13th century were mild compared to some of the elections of earlier times. In 897, Pope Steven VI ordered the remains of his implacable enemy, Pope Formosus, who died a year earlier, to be dug up, dressed in papal vestments, propped up on a throne and accused of various crimes. 

 Unsurprisingly, Formosus was found guilty. His decaying corpse was stripped of its papal vestments and the fingers he used to bless were hacked off before the remains were flung into Rome?s Tiber river.

 Unfortunately for Steven, the body was retrieved and stories soon spread that Formosuss remains were still working miracles. Steven was deposed in a mob rising, imprisoned and strangled.

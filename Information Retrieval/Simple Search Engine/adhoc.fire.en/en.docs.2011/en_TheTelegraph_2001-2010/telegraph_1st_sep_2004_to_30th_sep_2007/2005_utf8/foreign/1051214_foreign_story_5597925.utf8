 Fish keeps your mind young

 New York, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Eating fish appears to knock a few years off your mental age ? in a good way.

 Elderly people who ate fish at least once a week had the mental functioning of a person three years younger than their chronological age, while those who ate fish twice weekly or more turned the clock back four years.

 It appears as if its helping to keep the brain healthy, said Dr Martha Clare Morris of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, the studys lead author.

 Seafood is rich in omega-3 acids. One of these acids in particular, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is essential for the development of the brain in early life, she explained. 

 The researchers followed 3,718 people 65 and older for six years. Those who ate fish once a week showed a 10 per cent slower decline in their mental function, equivalent to a three-year reduction in mental age, Morris said.

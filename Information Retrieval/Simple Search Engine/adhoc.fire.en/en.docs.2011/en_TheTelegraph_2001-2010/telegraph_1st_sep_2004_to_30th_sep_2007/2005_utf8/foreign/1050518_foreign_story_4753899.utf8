 Pervez to stand for election after term expires in 2007

 Pervez Musharraf

 Islamabad, May 17 (Reuters): Pakistans military ruler President Pervez Musharraf will stand for election after his current term expires in 2007, a government minister said today, a plan swiftly denounced by political opponents.

 There is no doubt that he will remain a candidate for the post of president after 2007 and inshallah (God willing), he will win, information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said.

 Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and adopted the title of chief executive, secured a five-year term as president through a controversial referendum in 2002.

 This was endorsed by a parliamentary vote of confidence in January 2004 after his government struck a deal with a hardline Islamic opposition alliance.

 Under the deal, Musharraf promised to quit his post of army chief by the end of 2004, but he later backed down on the pledge, citing his crucial role in the US-led war on terrorism and his efforts to make peace with rival India.

 Political rivals and other critics of Musharraf say the referendum in 2002 was massively rigged in his favour through widespread stuffing of ballot boxes.

 Opposition groups quickly denounced Musharrafs plan to stand for election as unconstitutional.

 Hardly any comment is justified about General Musharrafs seeking election in 2007, said Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for the Pakistan Peoples Party of Benazir Bhutto. 

 He has already occupied the presidency through a fraudulent election and through unconstitutional means.

 Babars comments were echoed by Liaquat Baluch, a senior leader of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, the six-party Islamic Opposition alliance still angered by Musharrafs failure to stick to his bargain on giving up his military role.

 This statement is a deviation from the constitution because even the present position of General Musharraf is legally and constitutionally controversial, he said.

 The pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League enjoys a majority in parliament and three of the four provincial legislatures, which will constitute the electoral college that will elect the president in 2007. A new parliament is due to be elected in a general election 2007.

 Under the electoral college system, the new president will be chosen by a majority vote of all members of the national and four provincial assemblies and the Senate. 

 In recent months, Musharraf has been trying to improve his relations with Opposition parties to boost his position ahead of the presidential polls.

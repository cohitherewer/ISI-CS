 Israel row twist

 Jerusalem, May 16 (Reuters): An Israeli diplomatic row that features high-powered wives and guest-stars Madonna took a new twist today that could cost the countrys leading ambassador his job.

 The soap-opera-like spat centres on a request by Israels ambassador to Washington Danny Ayalon for an official probe into whether foreign minister Silvan Shaloms socialite wife fired an embassy aide for failing to secure her an audience with Madonna. In the latest development, a source close to Shalom said he was determined to remove Ayalon from his post, even though the ambassador had won respect in Washington. Shalom has lost confidence in him, the source said. Offering a break from matters of war and peace, the dispute has been played out in daily newspaper headlines and TV newscasts.

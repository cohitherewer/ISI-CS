 Emergency declared in Costa Rica

 San Jose (Costa Rica), Jan. 12 (Reuters): Costa Rica declared a national emergency yesterday because of flooding along the Central American nation?s Caribbean coast which has killed at least two people and forced the evacuation of 7,500 others.

 Heavy rains since the weekend have sent water overflowing from rivers and floods have damaged 12 bridges and roads.

 President Abel Pacheco signed a decree to free up funds to aid those who were evacuated and pay for rebuilding work.

 Rescue workers have reported two dead to date, with another five missing, and about 7,500 people have been sent to churches and other shelters since the flooding began.

 Rescue workers have been unable to reach some of the affected towns, including indigenous reserves around Alta Talamanca.

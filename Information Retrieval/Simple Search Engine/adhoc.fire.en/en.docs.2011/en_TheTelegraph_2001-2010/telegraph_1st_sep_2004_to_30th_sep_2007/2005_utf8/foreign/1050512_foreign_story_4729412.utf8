 Dogs day care

 Nairobi, May 11 (Reuters): A baby girl rescued by a dog after being dumped in a Kenyan forest to die was offered homes across the world yesterday, with callers from as far away as Japan offering to care for the infant, dubbed Angel by nurses.

 Catherine Gicheru, news editor of the Daily Nation, said her newspaper had been swamped by calls from would be adoptive parents in Japan, Venezuela and South Africa after carrying the story of the baby saved from a lonely death by a female dog.

 The baby, estimated to be about two weeks old, was handed over to police by a family whose unnamed dog found her in a forest near Nairobi as she foraged for food for her puppies.

 The dog carried the baby in her mouth across a busy road and set her down beside her puppies in the compound of the familys iron sheeted shack.

 Gaza erupts in violence

 - Israel firm on pullout

 Neve Dekalim (Gaza Strip), Aug. 16 (Reuters): Israeli security forces clashed with protesters in the largest Gaza settlement today in the run-up to the midnight deadline for Jews to leave the occupied territory.

 Soldiers and police trying to take control of Neve Dekalim, a flashpoint of resistance against Israels first uprooting of settlements on land Palestinians want for a state, dragged away more than 50 youths, some kicking, punching and cursing.

 The scuffles, the most violent since the army issued a 48-hour eviction notice to Gaza settlers, were wreathed in smoke as hundreds of demonstrators trying to block moving vans entering the enclave burned piles of rubbish on the main street. Where is the Jewish heart? one youngster cried as four soldiers carried him away.

 Protesters pelted troops with eggs, stones and paint-filled balloons. One settler woman lay down sobbing in front of a bulldozer. 

 Officials vowed to do whatever was necessary to clear the way for settlers leaving under Prime Minister Ariel Sharons plan for disengaging from conflict with Palestinians. 

 We do not intend to blink, said Brigadier-General Miri Regev, chief military spokeswoman. If there is no choice, the police will arrest all of the lawbreakers. With forced evacuations due to begin tomorrow, many settlers packed up trucks and joined an exodus that Israel says will mark the end of its 38-year occupation of the Gaza Strip.

 Dugit, a largely secular settlement on the northern edge of the strip, became the first Gaza enclave completely evacuated when the last of its 79 residents left today. All of Gush Katif is in mourning, settler Gilad Meimon said.

 But hardline settlers vowed to stay put on land they believe was bequeathed to the Jewish people by God.

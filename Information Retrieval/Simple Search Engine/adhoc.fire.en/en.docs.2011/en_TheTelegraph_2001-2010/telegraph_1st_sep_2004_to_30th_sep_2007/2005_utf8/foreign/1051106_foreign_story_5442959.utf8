 Annan cancels Iran trip

 Annan: Diplomatic snub

 United Nations, Nov. 5 (Reuters): UN secretary-general Kofi Annan has cancelled his forthcoming trip to Tehran in response to the Iranian Presidents call towipe Israel off the map, the United Nations said on Friday.

 Annan had planned to visit the Iranian capital in mid-November during a swing through West Asia beginning next week, presumably to talk about Irans nuclear policy.

 But since the trip was arranged, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad drew international condemnation for his remarks on October 26.

 The secretary-general and the Iranian government have mutually agreed that this is not an appropriate time for him to travel to Iran, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

 In light of the ongoing controversy, it would have been difficult to advance the agenda that he had wanted to discuss with the Iranian leadership, Dujarric said.

 In Tehran, a foreign ministry source contended it was Iran, not Annan, who wanted the trip rescheduled to a more appropriate time in the future, the official news agency Irna reported. It said comments made by Annan on Thursday were under the influence of American officials and were not interpreted well in Tehran. Annan had previously rebuked the Iranian president.

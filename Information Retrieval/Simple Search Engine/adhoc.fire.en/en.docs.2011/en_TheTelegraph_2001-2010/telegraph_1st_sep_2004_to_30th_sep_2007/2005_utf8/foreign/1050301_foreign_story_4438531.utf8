 Detained Koirala renews protest call

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, Feb. 28: Former Prime Minister and Nepali Congress chief Girija Prasad Koirala today renewed his call for nationwide street protests to force King Gyanendra to reverse his February 1 takeover. 

 In a statement issued from detention, Koirala said the monarch was using the army to quell dissent and stifle all forms of political activity. 

 He said the king was adopting double standards to dupe the international community. ?While the king tells the world that he is committed to constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy, in practice he is ruling the country with the might of the army?, he said. Koirala?s call comes after the party?s failure to mobilise the people against the royal takeover. 

 With most of the Nepali Congress leadership under detention, the movement launched on February 18 evoked very little response. 

 Today, only a dozen Nepali Congress workers took part in a protest before they were arrested by security forces for violating prohibitory orders that were enforced after the takeover. Koirala, who has been under house arrest since the royal coup, also renewed his demand for the restoration of the House of Representatives as part of the greater agenda for safeguarding parliamentary democracy. 

 ?The Nepali Congress still considers that the revival of the House of Representatives is a must if we are to defend parliamentary democracy,? he said. 

 The veteran opposition leader pointed out that by imposing emergency, the king has taken away the basics rights of the people like freedom of expression, speech, publicity, freedom of movement and the constitutional rights that protected the citizens against all these. ?Given the situation we are forced to postpone the General Convention of the party?, he said while calling upon the people to ensure the success of the movement launched by his party. 

 Meanwhile statement issued separately by the party today claimed demonstration in Kailali, Tanahu, Parsa and Kathmandu with a number of activists rounded up by the police.

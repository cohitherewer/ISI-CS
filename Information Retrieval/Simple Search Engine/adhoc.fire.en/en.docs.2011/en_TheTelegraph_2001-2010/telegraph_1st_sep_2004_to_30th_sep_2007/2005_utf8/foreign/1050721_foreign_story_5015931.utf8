 Must-watch movie list for children

 LIZ LIGHTFOOT

 London, July 20: Films such as ET and Toy Story could be given the same importance in schools as classic works of literature under plans to modernise the English curriculum.

 A list of 10 films that all children should have seen by the age of 14 was published yesterday by the British Film Institute (BFI), which is talking to the governments curriculum advisers.

 It wants to shift the debate away from films that children should not see, either because they are unsuitable or too commercial, towards those that are acknowledged by the industry to be classics with enduring appeal.

 Too often, films are used in schools to bring light relief or to keep children occupied at the end of term, says the institute, when they should be acknowledged as a vital part of childrens cultural heritage.

 The BFI wants to broaden the range of films that children watch and has drawn up the list as the first step towards defining a tradition of great films that can compete with the classics of literature. 

 Ten films have been chosen because they won the most nominations from childrens film experts in Britain and the rest of Europe. Only one, Kes, directed by Ken Loach and released in 1969, is from Britain. Four are from America, and one each from Italy, France, Sweden, Japan and Iran, dating between 1939 (The Wizard of Oz) to 2001 (Spirited Away).

 Lord Puttnam, the British film director, applauded the initiative and called it a pretty good list, though he would make two substitutions. He would take out Show Me Love and include Pelle the Conqueror, which he believes has a stronger appeal.

 I would also choose The Miracle Worker instead of The Night of the Hunter because it is of the same era but more effective, he said.

 Sue Horner, the principal subject officer for English at the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, has agreed that films could have a useful role in helping children learn about things such as genre, narrative, use of words, characterisation and interaction. 

 She said: If you are thinking about the curriculum for the future and what the children bring with them to school and the ways they learn, we have to take the moving image text into account. It doesnt mean we will forget about books.But Martin Ward, the deputy general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said he was disappointed to see only one British film. Im surprised to see that none have been included from Bollywood, he said.

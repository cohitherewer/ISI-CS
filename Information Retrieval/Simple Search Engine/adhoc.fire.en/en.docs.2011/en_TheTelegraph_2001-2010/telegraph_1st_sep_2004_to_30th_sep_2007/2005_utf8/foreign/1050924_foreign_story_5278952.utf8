 Islam forced on Hindu girl

 - Pak MPs vow protest

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Sept. 23: The forced conversion of a Hindu girl to Islam in Pakistans southern Sindh province has sparked a new controversy with minority MPs vowing to protest in the parliament.

 Demanding that the National Assembly committee, comprising members of the Opposition and the government, probe what they alleged was forced conversion to Islam of the girl during a week-long illegal confinement by four kidnappers, the MPs said such incidents earn a bad name for the country. 

 It is a very sensitive issue, which must be thoroughly investigated to bring the culprits to justice, Gyan Chand, an MP from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, told The Telegraph today. 

 Sapna was allegedly abducted on September 14 in Jaccobabad town of Sindh province and the case was registered at a local police station the same day against the four abductors. The issue was also raised yesterday in the National Assembly where the deputy minister for the interior, Waseem Shehzad, explained that the girl adopted her new religion by her own sweet will and married one of the four kidnappers. 

 Police had arrested two of the four abductors but the court disposed of the case after the girl gave a statement she had married one of the kidnappers and embraced Islam, Shehzad said while producing a copy of her statement before the assembly.

 Rejecting Shehzads claim, Gyan Chand said Sapna had been intimidated to change her religion. He said that in a predominantly Muslim country of 153 million people, where all minorities form a mere three per cent of the total population, Sapna had no reason to flee to marry a Muslim. The Hindu population in Pakistan is only 1.6 per cent of the total.

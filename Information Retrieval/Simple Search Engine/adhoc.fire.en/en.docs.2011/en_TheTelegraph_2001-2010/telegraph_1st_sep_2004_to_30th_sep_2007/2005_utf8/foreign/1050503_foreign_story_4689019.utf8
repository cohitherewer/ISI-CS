 Bad hair days amp; Tony?s tan

 London, May 2 (Reuters): Four years ago, deputy Prime Minister John Prescott enlivened the British election campaign by punching a protester who threw an egg at him. This time round, Prescott has kept his fists down.

 So Tony?s tan, Sandra?s battle of the hairdos and baby Donald?s ability to reduce Dad to a bumbling wreck have kept voters entertained instead.

 With little political excitement generated by carefully crafted soundbites and stage-managed photo opportunities, the campaign?s few quirky gems are to be treasured. Prime Minister Tony Blair even had to defend a speedily acquired tan.

 Beauty experts were convinced he had resorted to a fake tan to boost his appeal. But Blair insisted he had gone brown naturally ?in my back garden at the weekend. The weather was glorious.?

 For the First Ladies of British politics, it has been hairdos at dawn. Former model Sandra Howard, the wife of Conservative leader Michael Howard, took a dig at Blair?s wife Cherie in her campaign Internet diary.

 ?I have heard it on the grapevine that a certain other leader?s wife has booked arguably the best and certainly the priciest hairdresser in town for the entire campaigning month ahead,? Howard wrote after one particularly bad hair day.

 But her windblown disarray was nothing to the look of total exhaustion on the face of Charles Kennedy, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats as he battled to explain party tax policy after the birth of his baby son, Donald. Tabloids had a field day and TV channels kept running clips of his befuddled reply.

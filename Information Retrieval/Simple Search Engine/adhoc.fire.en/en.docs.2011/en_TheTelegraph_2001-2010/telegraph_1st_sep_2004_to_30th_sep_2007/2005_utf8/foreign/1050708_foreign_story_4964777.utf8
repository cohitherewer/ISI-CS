 All faiths condemn attacks

 RUTH GLEDHILL

 London, July 7: The Archbishop 

 of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has spoken of his horror 

 and grief following the explosions in London this morning. 

 Dr Williams, who is on an inter-faith 

 visit to west Yorkshire, said: The appalling events 

 in London this morning have shocked us all. So I want first 

 and foremost to extend my personal sympathy and condolences 

 to everyone who is suffering and grieving at this time. 

 All those caught up in this 

 tragedy ? and that includes of course the emergency services 

 whose selfless dedication and commitment is so vital at 

 times like this ? all are in my own prayers and in the prayers 

 of a great many people.

 As it happens I have spent 

 this morning with Muslim colleagues and friends in west 

 Yorkshire, and we were all as one in our condemnation of 

 this evil and in our shared sense of care and compassion 

 for those affected in whatever way. 

 We in the faith communities 

 will have to continue to stand and work together for the 

 well being of our nation and for our shared understanding 

 of the life that God calls us to. I hope that we shall all 

 keep that vision alive at this deeply sad and testing time.

 Muslims in the UK also joined 

 in condemning the attacks. The British Muslim Forum said: 

 Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected 

 and we express our sympathy to their families and friends. 

 This is clearly a day of 

 great disappointment coming after a day of great joy as 

 our city of London only yesterday won the bid for hosting 

 the Olympics 2012.

 We wholeheartedly support, 

 congratulate and appreciate the efforts of the authorities 

 that are currently dealing with the situation.

 Ahmed Versi, editor of The 

 Muslim News, said: We unequivocally condemn these 

 terrorist attacks. We express our deep condolences to the 

 families, relatives and friends of the victims.

 Leaders of all religious groups 

 are concerned that the attacks should not damage inter-faith 

 relations.

 Clergy throughout the capital 

 opened their services for shelter, aid and prayer today 

 as churches of all denominations responded rapidly to the 

 crisis. Ministers and priests went on to the streets to 

 work alongside the emergency services, helping to comfort 

 traumatised commuters.

 St Pauls Cathedral was closed 

 to tourists but remains open to all who wish to pray. 

 The Bishop of London, the Right 

 Reverend Richard Chartres, said: This is a grave day 

 for London. Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured 

 and bereaved and also with the emergency services who have 

 responded so rapidly.

 The Roman Catholic Archbishop 

 of Birmingham, the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols, formerly 

 a bishop in London, expressed his revulsion. 

 He said: My heart goes out to everyone caught up in 

 these outrageous attacks in London today.

 I offer my prayers for all 

 those who have been killed and my condolences to their families 

 and friends.

 For many years, a Bishop 

 in north London, I too travelled every day on these tubes 

 and share the deep sense of shock and revulsion of what 

 has happened. May God give strength and determination to 

 all of us at this time.

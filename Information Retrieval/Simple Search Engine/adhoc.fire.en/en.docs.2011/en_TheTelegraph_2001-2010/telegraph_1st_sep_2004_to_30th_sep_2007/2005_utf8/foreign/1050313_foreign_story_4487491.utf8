 HK chief to be picked by pro-China poll body

 Hong Kong, March 12 (Reuters): Hong Kong?s next chief executive will be picked by a Chinese-sanctioned election body on July 10 following the shock resignation of unpopular leader Tung Chee-hwa.

 The territory?s interim leader Donald Tsang, who is expected to be confirmed in the post, announced the date after holding an urgent meeting with his cabinet, who agreed to stay on after Tung?s departure on Thursday.

 Tsang also said the next chief executive will serve for two years instead of a fresh five-year term, a controversial move that is bound to heighten fears that Beijing is increasingly interfering in Hong Kong?s affairs.

 Sources close to the Hong Kong government said Beijing has already picked Tsang as their man, and has in effect put him on probation by limiting him to serving out the rest of Tung?s term.

 ?The government will endeavour to maintain the stability of Hong Kong on all fronts, especially social and economic,? Tsang told a late night news conference.

 Most people in the city of nearly seven million will not be allowed to vote for their new leader, who will be chosen by an electoral college of 800 Hong Kong people, largely pro-Beijing businessmen and professionals. China endorsed chief secretary Tsang as the city?s interim leader earlier today after giving Tung a face-saving exit.

 If Tsang performs well, the sources said he might win Beijings backing to run for a full term in 2007. Otherwise, he would just be a seat-warmer for someone more acceptable.

 Tsang skirted questions on whether he had any ambitions to run for chief executive in July. ?My top task is to conduct the elections fairly openly and in strict accordance with the law ... I am not thinking about anything else.?

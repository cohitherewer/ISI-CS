 Pope slams genocide of Jews

 Vatican City, May 20 (Reuters): Pope Benedict, in his first major address about the Nazi era in his native Germany, yesterday condemned the genocide of the Jews, and said humanity must never be allowed to forget or repeat such atrocious crimes.

 Speaking exactly one month after his election, the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger also quoted from a famous phrase of reconciliation between German and Polish Catholic bishops issued in the 1960s: We forgive and we seek forgiveness.

 Benedict, 78, served briefly in the Hitler Youth during the war when membership of the Nazi paramilitary organisation was compulsory. 

 But he was never a member of the Nazi party and his family opposed Hitlers regime.

 He spoke of the repression of the Polish people and the genocide of the Jews, branding both atrocious crimes that show everyone the evil that the Nazi ideology had within it. 

 In his address, parts of which were read in an emotional voice and drew repeated applause from the crowd, the Pope said the Nazi period illustrated the abysses of wickedness that can hide in the human soul.

 From tedium to terror

 London, July 22 (Reuters): Once just a tedious daily routine, commuting has become an ordeal of suspicion and anxiety for millions of Londoners.

 Passengers eyed each other nervously and fought back jitters at every unexplained delay as they travelled to work today, a day after a second wave of bombings struck Britains capital.

 Many said they had begun to scrutinise others and the size and shape of passengers luggage on tube trains and buses, trying to work out whether their neighbour might be a suicide bomber or if an unattended bag might contain a bomb.

 Im resigned to the fact that this is going to happen again, 37-year-old John said, adding he had counted 13 large bags in his underground train carriage. Everybody is saying: You look at everybody suspiciously. But what are you going to do?

 Cairita Wogan, 29, a banker said: Im not so much nervous, but more aware on the tube. I look for baggage hanging around. People seem more jumpy.

 Three underground trains and a double-decker bus were struck by small, near-simultaneous explosions yesterday in an apparently failed bid to repeat suicide bomb attacks that killed 52 people two weeks earlier.

 Reports that the attackers might have been carrying large rucksacks ? a common item of luggage on the citys public transport ? have lent new dimensions of fear and suspicion to Londoners journeys to work.

 You cant help feeling a bit edgy, said Peter Meadows, 23, on a bus that was diverted away from a blast site in east London. Some said they had decided to stop using the underground, preferring to either drive or take the bus to work ? clogging many roads in central London.

 I am very hesitant about using the tube, but I feel more confident about using buses, although obviously that wont stop them being attacked, said Jacqui Shute, 39.

 I think that being vigilant is the best we can do. I am now very wary of people with rucksacks.

 After a train was held at Oxford Circus in central London, a woman ran up to a station guard and demanded to know whether it was another bomb. 

 After the delay, underground officials said they had found lost property. In response, one woman said: I just dont like this.

 Danny Prescott, 33, a bus driver whose bus was stopped at the station summed up a feeling of fear spreading across London. All we saw is police coming from everywhere, he said.

 It does make you really scared but youve got to carry on. You can see passengers are more nervous as they get on the bus, they glance at people with bags and I am always looking at peoples bags.

 Climate change blow to human cradle

 The Sterkfontein Caves (South Africa), June 26 (Reuters): Climate change in Africa gave rise to modern humans.

 Now experts fear that global warming linked to carbon emissions will have its worst impact on humanitys cradle. Africa is the most vulnerable continent to climate change, said Jennifer Morgan, director of the Global Climate Change Programme at conservation group WWF.

 Most African livelihoods depend on rain-based agriculture so droughts and floods will have a serious impact on the workforce, she said, adding that the continents extreme poverty reduced its ability to cope. 

 Africas plight will be high on the agenda of a Scottish summit of the Group of Eight industrialised nations next month which could herald increased aid flows to the region.

 British Prime Minister Tony Blair has also made climate change a priority of Britains year-long presidency of the G8.

 Global warming is widely blamed on emissions of heat-trapping gases from cars, factories and power plants ? gases mostly spewed from the rich world. 

 Climate change in Africa prodded mankinds distant ancestors along their evolutionary path as forests gave way to grasslands, forcing early humans into an open environment where it appears stone tools and long strides first developed.

 But while most past changes in weather patterns were gradual ? giving our pre-historic ancestors a chance to adapt ? the pace of global warming today could overwhelm modern Africa. 

 The UN projects that temperatures may rise by 1.4-5.8 Celsius by the year 2100.

 Desertification threatens to drive millions of Africans from their homes, said a recent international report drawing on the work of 1,360 scientists in 95 nations.

 Rising sea temperatures are also among the threats seen to the coral reefs off Africas lush east coast, the life-blood of poor coastal communities dependent upon fisheries and tourism.

 And this tragedy of the weather is unfolding across the continent where climate change gave birth to modern humans.

 The evidence for this is embedded in the Sterkfontein caves, 30 km northwest of Johannesburg, where hominid fossils dating back over four million years have been unearthed. There was a drying up of Africa around 2.5 million years ago ... There was a change from forest to grassland, said Ron Clarke, who heads excavations at Sterkfontein.

 Intriguingly, it was in this period that the Sterkfontein fossil record reveals our ancestors first making stone tools.

 Climate change would continue to steer humanitys path.

 About 130,000 years ago, the climate switched ... briefly into a warmer, moister mode, write Chris Stringer and Robin McKie in their book African Exodus: The Origins of Modern Humanity.

 The Sterkfontein Caves, surrounded by rolling farms, are again witness to environmental change ? this time man-made. 

 The water table below the caves is dropping because it is being pumped out by local farmers, said Clarke. And water in the area will become more scarce if temperatures rise as fast as some fear.

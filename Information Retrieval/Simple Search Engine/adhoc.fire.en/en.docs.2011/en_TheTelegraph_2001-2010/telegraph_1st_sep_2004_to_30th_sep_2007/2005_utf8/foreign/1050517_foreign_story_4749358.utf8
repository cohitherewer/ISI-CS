 Rugby and royal duty await William

 Prince William: Solo royal

 London, May 16 (Reuters): Britains Prince William will join the British and Irish Lions rugby union tour to New Zealand in July to support the team, Clarence House said today.

 During the trip, the Prince will also conduct his first solo royal engagements on behalf of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, at events to commemorate the end of World War II.

 William, 22, was invited to support the Lions team by manager Clive Woodward.

 I am delighted that Prince William will be spending some time with us, Woodward said in a statement.

 It will be a great boost for the team as he is a great supporter of the game.

 He is going to be with the team for certain periods and it all adds to the sense of occasion around these key tests.

 William, who is currently studying for his final exams at St Andrews University, will join the Lions squad for the second and third test matches in Wellington and Auckland.

 Williams younger brother, Prince Harry, was in Sydney to support the England team when they won the World Cup in 2003.

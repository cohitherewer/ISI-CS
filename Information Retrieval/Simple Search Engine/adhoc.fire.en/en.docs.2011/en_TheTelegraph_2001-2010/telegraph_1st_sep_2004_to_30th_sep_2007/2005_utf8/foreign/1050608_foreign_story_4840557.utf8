 Dull jobs raise heart disease risk

 Washington, June 7 (Reuters): Dull, steady, unexciting jobs may make the heart beat in an unchanging, rapid rhythm ? which in turn could lead to heart disease, British researchers reported today.

 They found that men with low-grade jobs, meaning they had little control over daily tasks, and men in low social positions had faster and less-variable heart rates.

 This finding helps explain why men with low-paying jobs and less education have a higher risk for heart disease, a trend that has been evident for the last 30 years, said Dr Harry Hemingway, of University College London Medical School, who led the study.

 The heart doesnt, or shouldnt, beat like a metronome, Hemingway said in a statement. A healthy heart rate varies, he said.

 His team studied 2,197 men aged 45 to 68 who worked for the British government, and talked to them about friends and family, education and lifestyle. 

 Job control was rated on a 15-item scale.

 Steadier, faster heart rates were consistently seen in the men with lower social positions, less job control and higher depression.

 007 has the licence to kill and smoke

 NIGEL REYNOLDS

 London, Feb. 10: James Bond can carry on inhaling ? whether from an elegant panatella or one of the Morland Specials that he used to produce from a gun-metal case ? and the censors won?t demand that Rick?s Bar becomes smoke-free if Hollywood remakes Casablanca.

 The British Board of Film Classification yesterday rejected calls from health groups to cut film scenes showing actors smoking. The board said such drastic action smacked of ?the nanny state? and there was little public demand for the change.

 However, in a slight shift in its position, the board said in new guidelines issued yesterday that films ?which promote or glamourise smoking, alcohol abuse or substance misuse, may also be a concern, particularly at the junior categories (in the U, PG and 12A film classifications)?.

 The board?s cautious mention of smoking for the first time falls far short of demands that smoking scenes, particularly in any film likely to be seen by children, should be banned in Britain and consigned to the cutting room floor. 

 Prof. Gerard Hastings, director of cancer research at the UK?s Centre for Tobacco Control, said: ?If the BBFC doesn?t accept its moral responsibility, it might as well pack up and go home.?

 Amanda Sandford, research manager of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), said the new mention in the guidelines was ?a step in the right direction?. But she was surprised that the BBFC had rejected evidence from America of a link between children smoking and seeing role models smoking in films.

 The board said yesterday that it felt no qualms about adult films containing smoking scenes as long as they were not glamourised.

 Bond has continued as a regular, though not chain-smoking, spy for years. In Die Another Day, the last 007 film, Pierce Brosnan, who will not play the hero again, puffed away on cigars.

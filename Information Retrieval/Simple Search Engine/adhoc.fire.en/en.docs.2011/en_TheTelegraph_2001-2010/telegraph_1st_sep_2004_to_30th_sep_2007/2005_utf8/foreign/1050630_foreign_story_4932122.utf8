 Cruise in alien land

 Berlin, June 29 (Reuters): Tom Cruise not only battles creatures from outer space in his latest film War of the Worlds, he also believes aliens exist, he told a German newspaper today.

 Asked in an interview with tabloid Bild if he believed in aliens, Cruise said: Yes, of course. Are you really so arrogant as to believe we are alone in this universe? Millions of stars, and were supposed to be the only living creatures? No, there are many things out there, we just dont know, Cruise, 42, said in the interview published in German. Cruise is a follower of the Scientology church founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard.

 His new film War of the Worlds is based on British writer H.G. Wells 1898 story of the invasion of Earth by Martians.

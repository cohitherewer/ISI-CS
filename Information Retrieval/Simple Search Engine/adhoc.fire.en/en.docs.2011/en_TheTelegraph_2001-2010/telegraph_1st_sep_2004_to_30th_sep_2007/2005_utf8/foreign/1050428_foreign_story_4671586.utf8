 Woman MP shot dead in Baghdad

 Baghdad, April 27 (Reuters): Gunmen shot dead a member of Iraq?s parliament outside her house in Baghdad today, Iraqi police said.

 They identified the victim as Lamea abed Khadawi, a member of caretaker Prime Minister Iyad Allawi?s political party. 

 The attack occurred in front of her home in eastern Baghdad. She is believed to be the first person in the 275-member National Assembly to be killed. The assembly was formed after elections on January 30 this year.

 Insurgents and gunmen have targeted politicians in the past. The former head of the Iraqi Governing Council, the predecessor to the interim government, was assassinated in a car bombing in May last year. Earlier this month, Allawi survived an assassination attempt when his convoy was attacked by a car bomber.

 Iraq?s parliament had met for several hours earlier today to discuss its rules and regulations and other issues.

 Chase by paparazzi injures star

 Lindsay Lohan

 Los Angeles, June 2 (Reuters): US actor Lindsay Lohan and a passenger in her Mercedes suffered minor injuries when a photographer crashed his car into hers after pursuing her through the streets of Los Angeles, police said yesterday.

 Police arrested Galo Cesar Ramirez who they said followed Lohan, 18, and her 19-year-old passenger on Tuesday and tried to snap a photograph of the Mean Girls actor. 

 A spokeswoman for Lohan said the actor knew Ramirez had been arrested. 

 After Lohan made a U-turn to evade Ramirez, he intentionally crashed his minivan into the drivers side door of Lohans Mercedes-Benz coupe, police said. 

 The crash occurred just outside the Beverly Hills city limits, police said.

 Lohan had called police from her cellphone to complain that she was being chased by paparazzi shortly before the crash, police said.

 Ramirez, 24, was booked on a felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon and on an outstanding warrant for misdemeanour marijuana possession, police said. He was released yesterday on $35,000 bail. 

 He is scheduled to appear in court on June 22.

 Arabic papers urge restraint

 Dubai, July 8 (Reuters): Arab newspapers urged Britain today not to turn against Arabs and Muslims after bloody bomb attacks in London blamed on al Qaida Islamist militants.

 While all editorials condemned the onslaught, some linked it to Britains part in the Iraq invasion or its backing for a US-declared war on terror, which, they said, ignores the injustice of occupation fuelling militancy in West Asia.

 The Friday prayer preacher in Tehran said Britain, which has said yesterdays attacks bore the hallmarks of al Qaida, should remember that Osama bin Ladens group was a US creation. Beiruts English-language Daily Star predicted that Muslims would suffer more discrimination after the carnage in London.

 In spite of the fact that all acts of Islamic terrorism blatantly contradict Islamic teachings, such acts serve to further distort the image of Muslims and Islam, it said.

 The stupidity which thought and planned these cowardly and immoral operations has succeeded, once more, in expanding the circle of enemies against Arabs, Muslims and Islam, said an editorial in the London-based pan-Arab daily al-Hayat.

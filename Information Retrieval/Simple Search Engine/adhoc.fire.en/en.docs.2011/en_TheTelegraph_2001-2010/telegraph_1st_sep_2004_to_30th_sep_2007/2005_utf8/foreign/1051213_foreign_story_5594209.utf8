 Holy cops

 Jerusalem, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Hollywood has Robocop. The Holy Land has rabbicops.

 Hundreds of Israeli policemen are under investigation on suspicion of undergoing a quickie rabbinical ordination for a monthly stipend of 2,000 shekels ($432) rather than any sense of religious calling, Haaretz newspaper said.

 Citing justice ministry sources, the newspaper said the affair came to light after a policeman-cum-rabbi was probed for domestic violence, and investigators noticed his padded paycheque. Wages for Israeli police begin at 4,000 shekels ($864).

 Nappy war

 Valletta (Reuters): Regulations to control 

 horse dung in the streets by forcing horse owners to tie 

 bags under horses constituted cruelty to the animals, a 

 Maltese court has ruled. The bags, called nappies, were 

 ordered to stop the horses from fouling the streets, but 

 owners never enforced them and some of them took the government 

 to court. A magistrate found the nappies to breach the Animal 

 Welfare Act after vets explained that a horses tail 

 had to be kept free to swat flies, the Malta Times 

 reported. The practice of putting diapers on horses is also 

 used in other European cities where horses pull carriages 

 for tourists.

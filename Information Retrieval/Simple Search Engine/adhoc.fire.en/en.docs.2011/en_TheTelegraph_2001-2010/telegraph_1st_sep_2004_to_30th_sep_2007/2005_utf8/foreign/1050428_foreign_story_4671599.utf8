 Blair hits back at ?liar? label

 London, April 27 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair accused the opposition Conservatives of desperation today after they branded him a liar with just over a week to go until Britain?s election.

 Campaigning for the May 5 vote has grown increasingly bitter as the Conservatives ? trailing in the polls ? have turned Blair?s integrity into a central issue, using billboard posters to accuse him of lying over the Iraq war.

 Blair said the Conservatives had resorted to personal attacks after failing to win over voters with economic policies and raising immigration in ?a profoundly unpleasant way?.

 ?And finally, when all else fails, they turn to personal attacks on me,? said Blair, campaigning at a school.

 ?My response: I will carry on talking about the issues that matter to the hard-working families of this country,? he said in the northern English town of Bolton.

 Telegenic and articulate, Blair was long regarded as his centre-left Labour party?s greatest asset. But public trust in him has declined dramatically during his eight years in power, particularly over his decision to go to war in Iraq.

 Many Britons feel the Prime Minister, who is campaigning for an unprecedented third straight term for Labour, exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq before the US-led invasion in 2003.

 The latest Conservative poster shows a black and white picture of Blair against a deep red background with large black lettering declaring: ?If he?s prepared to lie to take us to war, he?s prepared to lie to win an election.?

 British politicians normally refrain from accusations of outright lying and are banned from levelling them in parliament. But Conservative leader Michael Howard has insisted Blair?s integrity must be discussed in the campaign.

 ?I think I am entitled to say character and trust are issues and the Prime Minister has not told us the truth,? he said.

 The third-placed Liberal Democrats, the only major party to oppose the war, have stopped short of accusing Blair of lying.

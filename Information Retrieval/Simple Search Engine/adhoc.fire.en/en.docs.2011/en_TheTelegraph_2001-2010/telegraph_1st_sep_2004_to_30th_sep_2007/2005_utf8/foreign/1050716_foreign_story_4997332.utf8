 China general warns US

 Beijing, July 15 (Reuters): A Chinese general has warned that China is ready to use nuclear weapons against the US if Washington attacks his country over Taiwan, the Financial Times reported today.

 Zhu Chenghu, a top general of the Peoples Liberation Army who said he was expressing his own views and did not anticipate a conflict with Washington, nevertheless said China would have no option but to go nuclear in the event of an attack.

 If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition onto the target zone on Chinas territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons, he told an official briefing for foreign journalists. 

 A spokeswoman for Chinas foreign ministry noted that the general had said he was not speaking on behalf of the government. 

 A spokesman later said the ministry was looking into the matter. The defence ministry declined to comment, saying the foreign ministry had organised the event at which the general spoke.

 In Washington, where anxiety about economic and strategic challenges posed by China is widely voiced, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Chinese general had talked about a hypothetical situation.

 China has claimed Taiwan as its own since 1949, and vowed to bring the self-governed democracy back into the fold. In March, Chinas parliament passed an anti-secession law authorising the use of non-peaceful means to do so.

 European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso urged China today to resume dialogue with Taiwan. This will also greatly advance Chinas international standing and reputation as a global player with a particular responsibility for peace and security in East Asia, Barroso said.

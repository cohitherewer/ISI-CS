 New worm attack on computers

 Seattle, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Several new computer worms were being blamed for causing computer system failures at some media outlets and companies in the US yesterday.

 The worms, including two called IRCBOT.WORM and RBOT.CBQ, exploit a recently discovered flaw in Microsoft Corps Windows 2000 operating system and were causing personal computers at more than 100 US companies to restart repeatedly and potentially exposed them to attackers who could take control of a system.

 This is the most significant threat weve seen in at least 12 months, said Vincent Gullotto, vice-president of the anti-virus emergency response team at McAfee Inc. 

 But Symantec Corp. and McAfee, the top two computer security companies, as well as Microsoft, said that damage to computer systems yesterday was limited. 

 CNN reported on air that personal computers at the cable news network were affected by a worm that caused them to restart repeatedly.

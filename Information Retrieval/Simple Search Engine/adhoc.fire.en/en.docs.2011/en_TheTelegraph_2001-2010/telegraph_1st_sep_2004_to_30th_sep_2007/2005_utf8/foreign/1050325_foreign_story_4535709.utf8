 Fresh Iraq war heat on Blair

 London, March 24 (Reuters): The British government came under renewed fire over Iraq today as its opponents sensed a chance to embarrass Prime Minister Tony Blair just weeks before an expected election.

 Opposition leaders and members of Blair?s own Labour Party demanded the government explain why its top lawyer apparently changed his mind over the legality of the 2003 war to topple Saddam Hussein. Encouraged by polls which suggest trust is an area where Blair is vulnerable, the Opposition Conservative Party accused the Premier of being ?extremely selective with the truth?.

 Dominic Grieve, the Conservatives? top lawyer, urged the government to ?come clean? over the sequence of events which led up to the invasion. ?Does the foreign secretary not realise how corrosive this entire episode now is to trust in government,? Grieve told parliament after foreign secretary Jack Straw tried once again to explain how the government reached its decision to go to war.

 The latest assault on Blair?s credibility was triggered by a few key lines from a resignation letter written by the foreign office?s former deputy legal adviser Elizabeth Wilmshurst. She quit her job just days before the war, saying she believed there was no legal basis for an invasion. The foreign office published her letter yesterday but blacked out several lines of it. However, Britain?s Channel 4 News obtained the missing lines within hours and broadcast them in its nightly news bulletin. The lines suggest the government?s top lawyer, attorney general Lord Goldsmith, changed his mind over the legality of the war sometime between March 7 and March 18, 2003 ? days before British and US troops invaded Iraq.

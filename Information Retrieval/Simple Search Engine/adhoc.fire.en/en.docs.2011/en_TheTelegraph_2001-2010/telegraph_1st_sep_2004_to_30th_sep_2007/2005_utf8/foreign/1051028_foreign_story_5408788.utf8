 Bush recall

 Washington, Oct. 27 (Reuters): President George W. Bushs nominee for the US Supreme Court, White House counsel Harriet Miers, abruptly withdrew from consideration today after mounting criticism from the Right and the Left about her credentials for the lifetime job.

 Bush said in a statement he reluctantly accepted the withdrawal of his long-time ally and would move in a timely manner to fill the vacancy left open by the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day Connor. As a reason for pulling out, Miers, 60, cited the need to maintain privacy of her White House service. Members of Congress wanted to see internal records that Bush vowed to keep confidential. Miers said in a letter to Bush she was concerned the Senate confirmation process presents a burden for the White House.

 Maastricht (The Netherlands), Oct. 1 (Reuters): Grandsons of the three World War II allied leaders who attended the 1945 Yalta conference met for the first time today and defended the talks which some have blamed for triggering the Cold War.

 With the German army in retreat and Hitlers vision of a Nazi-controlled continent in tatters, Josef Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met at the Black Sea resort to decide how to occupy Germany and reorganise Europe into spheres of influence.

 At the grandsons first meeting, the trio countered the view that the US and British leaders underestimated Stalins cunning and abandoned central and eastern Europe to five decades of Soviet oppression, starting the Cold War. People imagine that Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin arrived in Yalta with a blank sheet of paper to decide the fate of Europe. Nothing could be further from the truth, Winston Churchill, 64, said. 

 The fate of Europe had been decided several months before with the Red Army sweeping westwards and rolling back the German Wehrmacht ... it was that which led to the enslavement of some 200 million peoples, he added.

 For eastern Europeans the end of World War II and Nazi occupation brought a new totalitarian ruler, the Soviet Union. Sixty years on this legacy still mars relations with Russia. However, Roosevelts grandson Curtis Roosevelt said the conference should be seen in its proper historical context and not merely in the light of the three men. 

 But the personalities loom large for the three grandsons. My grandfather had a very nice phrase about your grandfather, Churchill told Stalins grandson Yevgeny Dzhugashvili, who uses Stalins Georgian surname. He said he was like a crocodile. You never knew whether he was trying to smile or preparing to swallow you up.

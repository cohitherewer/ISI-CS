 Nobel in hand, attack on N-arms

 Oslo, Dec. 10 (Reuters): The world should work to make nuclear weapons as universally condemned as slavery or genocide, UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei said today after receiving the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize.

 ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the world had 27,000 nuclear warheads and to me, that is 27,000 warheads too many.

 The hard part is how do we create an environment in which nuclear weapons ? like slavery or genocide ? are regarded as a taboo and a historical anomaly? ElBaradei, an Egyptian, said in his acceptance speech.

 Announced as laureates in October, ElBaradei and the IAEA shared the Peace Prize for their work to prevent the spread of nuclear arms and promote the safe use of atomic power in a year marking the 60th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.

 ElBaradei and IAEA board of governors chairman Yukiya Amano of Japan received gold medals and Nobel diplomas at a ceremony at Oslo City Hall to applause from about 1,000 guests.

 The 10 million Swedish crown ($1.25 million) award was the 15th Nobel Peace Prize to go to a UN agency or people linked to the world body.

 ElBaradei urged a halt to proliferation of nuclear arms and disarmament by the eight or nine states that now have them.

 We must ensure ? absolutely that no more countries acquire nuclear weapons, he said, adding: We must see to it that nuclear weapon states take concrete steps towards nuclear disarmament.

 A security system that does not rely on nuclear deterrence should be put in place, he said. In areas where conflicts are allowed to fester, some countries may seek weapons of mass destruction, he warned.

 The IAEA has been at the heart of efforts to resolve an international dispute with Iran over its nuclear programme, but ElBaradei did not take up that issue in his speech.

 The choice of laureates this year was seen by experts as a return to the roots of the Nobel prize in disarmament after expansion of the scope of the prize since the 1960s to human rights work and even to environmental protection.

 Swedish philathropist Alfred Nobel said in his 1895 will that the prize should go, among other criteria, to whoever had done most for the abolition of standing armies.

 Nobel would surely have agreed that in our day the struggle against nuclear arms must be even more urgent than opposition to standing armies, Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman Ole Danbolt Mjoes said.

 Despite hopes at the end of the Cold War 15 years ago for a new world order based on human solidarity, the world is still nowhere near that goal, the peace laureate said.

 ElBaradei said the world faced threats without borders that could not be tackled by building walls, developing bigger weapons or dispatching troops, but only through multilateral cooperation.

 Smith smooch

 Berlin, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Hollywood hunk Will Smith is a knock-out kisser.

 He proved it in Berlin yesterday when he jumped from the stage during a raucous press conference, lowered a stunned journalist to the floor and embraced her. In town to promote his hit romantic comedy Hitch, in which he plays a ?date doctor? who gets even mediocre men the women of their dreams, Smith said had not always been so successful in love. ?I desperately needed a date doctor in high school,? said the 36-year-old funnyman. He recalled an experience at school when, after a year of unrequited love, he finally called out to the girl of his dreams in a packed assembly hall.

 ?I screamed to her across the room: ?Hey Charlene, how you feeling??, and back across the room she screamed: ?Too good for you!? It was horrible,? he said. ?So about eight years later I started talking to women again. I was trying to get married as quickly as possible.? Smith, who is married with children, jokingly described his loveless late teens as ?hell?. ?I was not anybody?s first choice. I was skinny, my ears kind of stick out a little bit.?

 Smith was asked in Berlin whether he had slept with his Hitch co-star Eva Mendes. Instead of replying, he mumbled: ?I know what she needs, I know what she needs?, referring to the reporter. He leapt down to the audience of journalists, grabbed the questioner, and as he kissed her lowered her to the floor. The lucky lady? Mirjeta Baraliu from Kosovo. Mendes said she could vouch for Smith?s smooching ability. ?I?ve had some great leading men, and some great Black men,? she said of her co-stars. ?But I really have to say that Will is so sensual, and such a great kisser, he?s by far my favourite on-screen kiss.?

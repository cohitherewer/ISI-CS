 Love loss

 London, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Love may be in the air but it is no longer in the mail, according to a new competition to revive the lost art of love letter writing.

 for the first time last year in the US when it attracted 5,000 entries, philanthropist Henri Zimands competition to find the best written love letters has now opened to entrants from Britain as well.

 In this age of one-line e-mails and abbreviated text messages, the simple art of letter writing has all but been forgotten, he said. 

 For each of the first 10,000 letters submitted to the website www.AndaSpirit.com in Britain or www.AndaSpiritUSA.com in the US, Zimand will make a contribution to a cancer facility in the area where the letter originated. 

 Green Leo

 Oscars in a hybrid car and lobbied loudly for worldwide 

 access to clean water. Now actor-activist Leonardo DiCaprio

 He has started production on 11th Hour, a feature-length 

 film that explores global warming and offers solutions for 

 restoring the planets ecosystems.

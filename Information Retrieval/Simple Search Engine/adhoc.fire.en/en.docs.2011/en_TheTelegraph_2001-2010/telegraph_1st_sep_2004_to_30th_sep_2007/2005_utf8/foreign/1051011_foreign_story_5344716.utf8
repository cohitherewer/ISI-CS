 Web portal opens gates to flights of fancy

 - Choose 

 your co-passenger, for ?3 

 Want to sit next to me? 

 It is every air travellers worst nightmare: the passenger in the next seat who turns a long flight from the unpleasant into the ultimate horror.

 After settling into a seat on a long journey, everything may seem normal. Then in comes a sweaty sumo wrestler with an allergy to deodorant, a family with two screaming children and the man with the worlds loudest snore.

 But now help is at hand, thanks to a website that allows passengers to choose the people who sit next to them, based on a personality profile. 

 It is the idea of marketing executive, Peter Shankman, 33, who flies more than 100,000 miles each year. 

 A little while ago I was on a flight between Houston and New York when Miss Texas sat down next to me, he said. 

 She was lovely. The flight was five hours, but it felt like about 11 seconds. I asked myself why every flight couldnt be that way.

 The website, airtroductions.com, was launched last month and more than 1,600 people have signed up from Britain, the US, Singapore and Australia. 

 Members are asked provide a profile of themselves and detail what type of person they are hoping to talk to ? or, if they prefer, not talk to. 

 They visit the website before flying to see which other members are on their flight. When a desirable match is found, the two are paired up for a fee of ?3.

 The site is not a dating service or a networking tool, Shankman said, but it could be.

 Postings from members include requests for fellow cooks to sit next to one another to share recipes, sports fans to talk about football and even singles looking for dates.

 Comedian Dom Joly of Trigger Happy TV fame recently found himself sitting next to a grandmother with two broken arms on a flight from Canada to London, whom he had to help feed.

 He said: It is typical, you look around the terminal or the gate and the person you spot who you least want to sit with is exactly who has the seat next to yours.

 This website is a good idea, he added. But, of course, there is the probability that most men are going to request someone who is fit, blonde and female.

 Hopkins to play Papa Hemingway

 Anthony Hopkins

 Wellington (New Zealand), Oct. 4 (AP): New Zealand director Roger Donaldson is to make a film about Ernest Hemingway, who will be played by Sir Anthony Hopkins.

 In Wellington, to promote another film ? The Worlds Fastest Indian ? starring Hopkins which premieres next week, Donaldson said Hopkins will play Hemingway in the film titled Papa.

 Its a pretty ambitious movie for what it is ... Hemingway is a great writer and a great character. If anybody can play Hemingway Tony Hopkins can, Donaldson said. He said the movie will be based on Hemingways encounter with Denne Bart Petitclerc, Americas youngest war correspondent in the Korean war, who was inspired by how Hemingway reported on the Spanish civil war.

 Hemingway, then living in Havana, Cuba, received a fan letter from Petitclerc and surprised the reporter by asking to meet him. Hemingway invited him to Havana for some weekends and the movie is really about what happens when he goes there, Donaldson told Dominion Post newspaper.

 Paris woos Hollywood

 COLIN RANDALL 

 Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou

 Paris, April 30: When the film stars Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou step into the Grand Gallery of the Louvre in a few weeks time, the scene will be important for reasons that have nothing to do with its inclusion in the opening sequences of the screen version of The Da Vinci Code.

 It will also mark a milestone in the search for compromise between the competing interests of art, commerce and bureaucracy in France?s love-hate relationship with Hollywood. 

 For years film-makers? desire to make use of Paris?s monuments, buildings and open spaces has been tempered by fear of prohibitive costs and red tape.

 Now a review of the fees and regulations that frequently drive directors abroad has been ordered by the cinema-friendly French culture minister, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres.

 But American producers and directors still complain about the heavy burden of labour charges, and the lack of financial incentives for non-French projects.

 Hollywood?s best hope of change lies in the government?s realisation that high costs can also be a disincentive for French productions to film in France.

 Thus cheaper Zagreb and Sofia have provided settings for the courts of Louis XIV and Napoleon. And De Vabres?s anger on learning that a remake of The Accursed Kings would be shot in Hungary led to 20 days of filming being ?repatriated? to Pierrefonds, a chateau north of Paris.

 His ministry also provided confirmation that Hollywood would be allowed to shoot part of The Da Vinci Code at the museum. 

 De Vabres has now told officials to devise a simplified system for the hiring out of museums, palaces, castles and other monuments to film-makers.

 Sofia Coppola recently created a ballroom scene for her film Marie-Antoinette, featuring Kirsten Dunst in the title role, at the Opera Garnier, Paris?s most expensive film set, and scenes are also being shot at the Bank of France, the National Archive and the Palace of Versailles, thought to cost ?10,000 a day.

 The cost of shooting in the newly-restored foyer of the opera would set a studio back ?20,000-?33,000 a day.

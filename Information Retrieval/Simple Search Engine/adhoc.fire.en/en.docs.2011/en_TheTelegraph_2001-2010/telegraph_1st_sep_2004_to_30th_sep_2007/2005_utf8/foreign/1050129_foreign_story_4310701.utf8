 Timer ticking on Pervez two posts: Aziz

 Davos, Jan. 28 (AP): Pakistan?s Prime Minister today said the ?timer is ticking? on President Pervez Musharraf?s dual reign as army chief and head of state, saying the military leader would take off his military uniform as promised in 2007.

 Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said Musharraf made the decision to renege on a promise to quit as army chief by the end of last year out of concern for stability, a desire to continue his programme of economic reform and to expand a crackdown on terrorism. But he acknowledged that the move was controversial, and that it exposed the weakness of Pakistani democracy.

 The Opposition and many international rights groups say the move short-circuited Pakistan?s fledgling steps back to democratic rule since Musharraf seized power in a bloodless 1999 coup. But Aziz said Pakistani democracy is a work in progress, and that Musharraf had no alternative.

 ?You could argue that if your democracy was more robust, you wouldn?t need that (a military President)... But we didn?t want to take the chance,? Aziz told business leaders on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here.

 ?This is a one time thing and there is a timer on it,? Aziz continued. ?Our feeling is that 2007 will be here very quickly, and after that the dual office is legally not possible.?

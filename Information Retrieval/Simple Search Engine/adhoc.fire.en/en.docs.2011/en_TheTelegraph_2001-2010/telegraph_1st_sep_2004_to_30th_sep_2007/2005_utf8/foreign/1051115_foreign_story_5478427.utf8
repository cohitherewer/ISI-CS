 Paris, Nov. 14: Nicolas Sarkozys image as the tough French interior minister facing down the rioters suffered a blow when he was forced to shelter from angry youths in central Paris.

 His first public outing since the disorder began more than a fortnight ago ended in an embarrassing confrontation on the Champs-Elys?es. 

 Sarkozy came under a vicious verbal assault from youngsters on Saturday night. The former prot?g? of President Jacques Chirac was forced to listen to chants of Sarkozy resign!, Libert?, egalit?, fraternit? ? but not in council estates, and several insults directed at his mother.

 He ducked into his car, but dozens of youths then rushed past the police and chased his motorcade towards the Arc de Triomphe.

 The minister, who is also president of the ruling UMP party, later met police officers manning the entrances to a metro station and had to contend with further calls for him to resign. He tried to make light of the incident once safely inside a police station. 

 On a Saturday night on the Champs-Elys?es, its understandable that its crowded and theres a bit of jostling, he said. 

 Perhaps there were a few people who wanted to make a fuss ? thats all. They were in the minority compared with the applause [I received].

 Nevertheless, he cancelled a planned visit to the Saint-Lazare railway station.

 Sarkozy will take solace from an opinion poll showing him to be the politician the public trusts most to find solutions to the troubles. 

 More powers

 The French cabinet agreed to ask parliament for a three-month extension to emergency powers and President Jacques Chirac prepared to address the nation over the urban violence.

 Although the violence dropped again overnight, police said youths destroyed 284 vehicles in Paris suburbs.

 In New York, a feast of drama and stars

 Theatregoers in New York are looking forward to a feast of classic drama and big stars this spring, from Tennessee Williams to Shakespeare, but one thing in short supply on Broadway is new plays.

 The high cost of mounting a play in a theatre seating 500 or more people means that unknown plays are often deemed too risky, even if their authors are big names.

 Openings in the coming months include The Glass Menagerie with Jessica Lange and Christian Slater, A Streetcar Named Desire starring Natasha Richardson and Kathleen Turner in Edward Albee?s Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Hollywood star Denzel Washington is also set to tread the boards in Julius Caesar and James Earl Jones will play in Ernest Thompson?s On Golden Pond. Excluding one-person shows by the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, new non-musicals on Broadway can be counted on the fingers of one hand this season, down from 13 in the last.

 Of the five, Democracy and The Pillowman were already tested at London?s National Theatre and Doubt has played successfully off Broadway. David Mamet?s Pulitzer-prize winner from 1984, Glengarry Glen Ross, will be revived on Broadway in April, with Oscar nominee Alan Alda in the cast, but his new play Romance will open at the small off-Broadway Atlantic Theater Company. ?Broadway has become very difficult in terms of how much money it costs,? said Neil Pepe, Atlantics artistic director who is directing Romance.

 ?We?re doing something that would be a little bit more risky,? he said, adding that as a not-for-profit company the Atlantic relies on donations to finance plays that typically do not cover their costs.

 With budgets typically around $2 million on Broadway and many more seats to fill, a Broadway show needs to spend more on advertising and run for 20 to 30 weeks to break even, Pepe said, a tall order even for revivals of popular plays. Producer Roy Gabay scored one of last season?s big hits with the new play Frozen, only to see his revival of 1983 Pulitzer winner Night Mother close early despite its big name stars, Edie Falco of The Sopranos and Brenda Blethyn. ?It?s all about minimising risk as much as you can,? said Gabay, who is now working on a revival of Steel Magnolias, an off-Broadway hit from 1987.

 Kremlin crows

 Moscow, Sept. 11: Kremlin officials are using birds of prey to scare off crows that are destroying the beauty of Russias most famous building by scratching the gold leaf off its domes, The Sunday Telegraph reported.

 As well as the scratches left by their skidding talons, acid in the birds droppings is corroding the gold top of the Kremlin and several of Moscows best-loved cathedrals.

 Officials have brought in three trained goshawk falcons and two eagles from Siberia in an attempt to frighten the birds away.

 Rock act

 Rome (Reuters): It was billed as one 

 of Italys biggest ever rock concerts and it seemed 

 as though the whole city had turned out to see Luciano Ligabue 

 play in front of 200,000 fans on Saturday night. Unfortunately 

 for him, at least a handful of people in the northern town 

 of Reggio Emilia decided not to attend the gig. Instead, 

 knowing he was not at home, they opted to burgle the rock 

 stars house. The burglary happened while he 

 was at the concert, a police official said. The burglars 

 made off with two computers, a video projector, a flat-screen 

 TV and even a Renault Clio parked in the 45-year-old rock 

 stars garage, ANSA newswire said.

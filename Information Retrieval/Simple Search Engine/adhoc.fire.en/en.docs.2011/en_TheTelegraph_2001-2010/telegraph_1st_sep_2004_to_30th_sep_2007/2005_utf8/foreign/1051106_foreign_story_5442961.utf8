 Fine Print

 Shine back on Sheen

 Los Angeles, Nov. 5 (AP): Actor Charlie Sheen says his relationship with actor and wife Denise Richards is on the mend.

 told the CBS Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson that things are really good. Sheen then lifted his left hand to show his wedding ring. Thats a pretty good indication, the 40-year-old actor said on Thursday.

 Richards filed for divorce in March after three years of marriage. The relationship appeared to disintegrate publicly just months before Richards, 34, gave birth to their second child.

 The couple were married in June 2002. They met while shooting the independent film Good Advice in 2000 and appeared in 2003s Scary Movie 3.

 Success is Childs Destiny

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Not long after 

 finishing its farewell tour, Destinys Child caps its 

 career by scoring its second number one on the Billboard 

 200 and its third number one on Top R amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. 

 The vocal trio had two other top fives on the big chart. 

 The new number 1s start with 113,500 copies, 

 according to Nielsen SoundScan, light by Destinys 

 Child standards. Last year, Destiny Fulfilled sold 

 497,000 when it jumped to number 2 in its first full week 

 after an acceleration of release date caused 61,000 pre-street 

 sales and a premature chart debut. In 2001, Survivor 

 launched with 663,000 the week it opened at number 1. Even 

 the 1999 set The Writings on the Wall started 

 faster than the new hits compilation, clicking through 133,000 

 copies when it bowed at number 5.

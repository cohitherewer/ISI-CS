 Parties reject Maoist plea

 Kathmandu, July 25 (Reuters): Nepals main political parties rejected today an appeal by the countrys Maoist rebels for talks to plan joint opposition to King Gyanendras seizure of power, saying the guerrillas should stop killing civilians first.

 Their rejection of dialogue with Maoist guerrillas opposed to the monarchy came as political unrest continued in the country and pro-democracy activists clashed with police. We urge the Maoists to stop attacking unarmed civilians, including political activists, and stop extortion, the top leaders of seven parties said in a statement.

 We appeal to the rebels to create an atmosphere of confidence and demonstrate that they are sincere about talks with the political parties.

 Nepals parties have been protesting against the February 1 sacking of the multi-party government by the king, who also suspended civil liberties and curbed media freedom. Earlier this month, the elusive Maoist guerrilla chief Prachanda proposed talks with political parties to discuss the possibilities of common protests against the king to press him to roll back his seizure of power.

 The rebels ? since launching their violent campaign to set up a single-party communist republic by toppling the monarchy ? have killed hundreds of civilians, including political workers, straining their ties with mainstream political groups.

 In April, a landmine planted by the Maoists killed 38 civilians on a bus, but the rebels apologised saying the device was aimed at an army convoy.

 About 200 pro-democracy activists, including journalists and human rights workers, clashed with police today in the heart of Kathmandu.

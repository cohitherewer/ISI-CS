 Mai US trip in doubt

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Mukhtaran Mai

 Islamabad, Aug. 2: Gangrape victim Mukhtaran Mai has been invited to address a protest rally in New York next month being organised by the Asian American Network of Abuse against Women (AANA).

 Mai, whose name had been placed on the exit control list (ECL) on the orders of President Pervez Musharraf a few months ago, said she had not received the invitation as yet.

 However, Mai doubted whether she would get permission from the Pakistan government to travel to the US despite the fact that travel restrictions imposed on her have since been lifted.

 I will take up the matter with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and his adviser Nilofar Bakhtiar to seek permission for travelling to the US Mai told The Telegraph today.

 Observers believe that any speech by Mai in New York on abuse of womens rights in Pakistan will create a difficult situation for the country, already struggling to promote its soft image.

 The AANA plans to organise the rally on September 20 and September 22 to coincide with Musharrafs visit to New York to attend the UN General Assembly session.

 However, Mai said the purpose of her visit would not be to embarrass Pakistanis. My address will basically focus on the plight of women in Pakistani society.

 In June, Pakistans Supreme Court had ordered the arrest of five of the six men accused in the alleged gangrape after a lower court had acquitted the five men.

 Mai then filed an appeal against a March 3 decision by the Lahore High Court which quashed capital punishment handed down by a lower court to the six men and ordered five of them to be released. The death sentence of the sixth accused was commuted to life in prison.

 Mai was raped in 2002 on the orders of a village council in the southern Punjab province to punish her 12-year-old brothers illicit relationship with a woman from a more powerful family.

 Musharraf had recently suggested an international conference of rape victims to discuss measures to prevent discrimination against women.

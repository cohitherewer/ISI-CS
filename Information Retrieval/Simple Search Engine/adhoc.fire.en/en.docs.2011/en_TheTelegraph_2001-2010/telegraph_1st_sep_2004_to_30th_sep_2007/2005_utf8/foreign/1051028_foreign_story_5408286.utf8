 Cadet Harry drops his pants 

 London, Oct. 27 (AFP): Britains Prince Harry was forced to drop his trousers during a military parade to prove he did not have his girlfriends name tattooed on his royal rear, a British newspaper said today.

 The 21-year-old son of Prince Charles, the prince of Wales, is halfway through his British army officer training course at Sandhurst Academy.

 The Sun said Harry (in picture), third in line to the throne, was ordered to bare his bum after rumours spread he had blonde Zimbawean-born girlfriend Chelsy Davys name inked on.

 During a parade, a colour sergeant yelled: Cadet Wales, drop your pants and show me your backside!

 Harry, apparently oblivious to the rumour, replied: Are you serious?

 The Prince had his trousers around his knees before the grinning sergeant said: Its ok, Wales, Ill take your word for it!

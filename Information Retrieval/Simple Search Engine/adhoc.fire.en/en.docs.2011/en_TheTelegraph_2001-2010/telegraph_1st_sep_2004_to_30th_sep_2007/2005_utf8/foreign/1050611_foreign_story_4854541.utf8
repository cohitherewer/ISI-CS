 Hackers send vicious Jackson emails

 Amsterdam, June 10 (Reuters): Emails claiming pop star Michael Jackson, on trial on sex abuse charges, has tried to kill himself are being spread by hackers as a means to break into computers, a British anti-virus firm said today.

 The hackers have sent emails with the subject Re: Suicidal attempt and the message text: Last night, while in his Neverland Ranch, Michael Jackson has made a suicidal attempt, said security software specialists at Sophos.

 Jackson is awaiting a California court verdict on charges of child molestation. The e-mail asks recipients to click on a link that takes them to a website which secretly installs malicious code on their computers.

 If you click on the link, the website displays a message saying it is too busy, which may not surprise people who think it might contain genuine breaking news about Michael Jackson, said Carole Theriault, security consultant at Sophos.

 In Santa Maria, California, jurors ended a shortened fifth day of deliberations without reaching a verdict yesterday. The jury, who have spent some 23 hours considering the charges against Jackson, put in a short working day of about two and a half hours.

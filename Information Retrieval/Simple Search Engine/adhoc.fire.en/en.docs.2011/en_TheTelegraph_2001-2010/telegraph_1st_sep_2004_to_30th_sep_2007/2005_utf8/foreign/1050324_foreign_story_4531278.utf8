 Arnie close to British libel trial

 London, March 23 (Reuters): Arnold Schwarzenegger edged closer to facing a British libel trial after he failed to block a legal action brought by a reporter who alleged the actor-turned-politician sexually assaulted her. 

 British television host Anna Richardson alleges she was libelled by the California governor and two of his campaign workers in a 2003 article over the assault claim.

 She says the article, which appeared in the Los Angeles Times, meant she ?deliberately and dishonestly fabricated? allegations that the Hollywood star groped her breast during a 2000 interview in a London hotel.

 Today, High Court judge David Eady upheld an earlier ruling that said legal papers could be legally served against Schwarzenegger in the US and that he was ?not peripheral? to the case.

 The decision means he could face a libel trial in Britain later this year.

 The 57-year-old Austrian-born bodybuilder and star of the blockbuster Terminator films was dogged by sex allegations during his campaign to become California governor.

 Schwarzenegger?s spokesman Sean Walsh, who is also being sued by Richardson, had previously made unsuccessful attempts to get the case thrown out, arguing that British courts had no jurisdiction. His most recent argument centred on the likelihood of the action failing. That argument failed when senior High Court official Master Leslie ruled there was no way to know the outcome of the trial.

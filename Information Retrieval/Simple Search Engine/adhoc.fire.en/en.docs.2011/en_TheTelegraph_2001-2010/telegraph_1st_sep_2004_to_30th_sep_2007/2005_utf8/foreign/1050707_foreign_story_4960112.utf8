 Gleneagles (Scotland), July 6 (Reuters): Irish rock star and anti-poverty activist Bono today gave up his fight to persuade Canada to boost foreign aid ? but not before telling Prime Minister Paul Martin he was a pain to deal with.

 Bono, like his fellow Irish rock star Bob Geldof, had openly pressed Martin to give a date by which Canada would raise its overseas assistance to 0.7 per cent of Gross Domestic Product.

 Martin refuses, saying it could be too expensive, and stuck to his guns during a meeting with Bono on the margins of a Group of Eight summit in Scotland. 

 Bono reluctantly admitted he could not force Martin to change his mind.

 Hes very difficult to deal with because he wont agree to things that he doesnt believe he can deliver, although that is very frustrating and annoying and infuriating, Bono said while standing next to Martin.

 Canada currently spends the equivalent of 0.26 per cent of GDP on foreign aid. Martin says he would rather commit to small increases he knows he can afford than make long-term promises.

 We will ultimately (reach) the 0.7 percent, but were not going to do it ... until we can basically say to Canadians: Heres how were doing it and heres when were going to do it and there are no caveats and conditions, Martin said. 

 Africans in final plea

 Africa campaigners made a last plea to leaders of the worlds industrialised nations today to boost aid, cancel debt and remove trade barriers to help lift the continent out of poverty.

 As G8 leaders gathered at a luxury hotel for a summit where they will to try to hammer out a deal, campaigners urged the leaders not to fail the worlds poorest.

 Leaving without a good deal would be a terrible failure and 3 billion people are urging you to take it all the way to the last minute to the last second of the last day, rocker and campaigner Bob Geldof told British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

 Although G8 and G7 countries have talked of their concern about Africa for decades, they have undertaken little concrete action, aid groups say.

 Blair, this years G8 president, has put Africa, along with climate change, top of his agenda and celebrities like Geldof and Bono have kept up the pressure by staging the huge Live 8 rock concerts round the globe.

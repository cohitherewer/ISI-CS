 Andrews: Diaz would be perfect as Maria

 Cameron Diaz

 London, Nov. 29 (AP): Julie Andrews says Cameron Diaz would be the perfect choice to play Maria if The Sound of Music is ever remade. 

 Andrews starred in the best-picture Academy Award winner about a nun who leaves the convent behind to wed an Austrian widower (Christopher Plummer) and spread the Do-Re-Mi spirit to his seven kids.

 At a question-and-answer session celebrating the 40th anniversary of the popular film, Andrews recalled the scene in which Maria runs through the mountains singing The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Music.

 It wasnt as serene as it looked, the 70-year-old actress said yesterday. I will never forget it, there was a large helicopter coming towards me through the mountains with a brave cameraman hanging out the side, she said.

 We shot the scene many times, and at the end of each take, the helicopter would circle round. The downdraft nailed me flat onto the grass, and a couple of times I bit the dust. At first it was funny, but after several times I began to get very angry.

 Andrews, who has given up musical roles because of throat problems, said: I miss singing very, very much. She will voice Queen Lillian in the upcoming Shrek 3 . Diaz will voice Princess Fiona.

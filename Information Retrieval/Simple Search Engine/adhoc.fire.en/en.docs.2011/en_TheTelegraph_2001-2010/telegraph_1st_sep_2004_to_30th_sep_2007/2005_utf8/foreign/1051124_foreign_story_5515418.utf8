 Vatican bar on gay priests

 Vatican City, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Practising homosexuals should be barred from entering the Roman Catholic priesthood, the Vatican says, taking a strict line on the place of gays in the clergy, an issue that has divided the faithful worldwide.

 An eagerly awaited Vatican document said the Church would also bar men with deep-seated gay tendencies and those who support gay culture but would admit those who clearly overcame homosexual tendencies for at least three years.

 Key excerpts from the official English-language version of the document, to be issued next week, were read to Reuters late yesterday by a Vatican prelate in possession of the document.

 The document reinforces standing policy that many in the Church believe has not been properly enforced. Its urgency has been highlighted by the 2002 sexual abuse scandal in the US, which involved mostly abuse of teenage boys by priests.

 Frances Kissling, president of the Washington-based dissident group Catholics for a Free Choice, said the document marked a sad moment for the Church because it would exclude faithful and good men who are called to the priesthood.

 The US gay rights group Human Rights Campaign accused the Vatican of using gay people as scapegoats.

 The document, which covers one of the most sensitive issues in the Roman Catholic Church, does not affect those men who are already priests but only those entering seminaries to prepare for the priesthood.

 The document, only 21 paragraphs long, restates Church teaching that deep-seated homosexual tendencies are objectively disordered and that homosexual acts are grave sins. 

 The English title of the document is: Instruction Concerning Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with Regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in View of Their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders.

 Long nails keep cleric from court

 Abu Hamza al-Masri

 London, Jan. 4 (Reuters): Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri failed to appear before a British court today, complaining his toe nails were too long and he could not walk.

 Abu Hamza, who is also wanted by the US over 11 alleged offences, was charged by British police last year on 16 counts including one terror-related offence.

 He had been due to make an appearance via video-link from the high-security Belmarsh jail in London where he is being held. ?Hamza has physical difficulties. He is unable to walk. He has been perambulating barefoot around the prison,? said defence lawyer Peter Hynes.

 Prosecutor Adina Ekiel added: ?He is complaining that his toe nails are too long.?

 Britain accuses Hamza, who lost an eye and both hands in Afghanistan fighting Soviet forces, of 10 charges of using public meetings to incite his followers to kill non-Muslims. Abu Hamza was stripped of his British citizenship in 2003 and banned from speaking at his mosque in north London.

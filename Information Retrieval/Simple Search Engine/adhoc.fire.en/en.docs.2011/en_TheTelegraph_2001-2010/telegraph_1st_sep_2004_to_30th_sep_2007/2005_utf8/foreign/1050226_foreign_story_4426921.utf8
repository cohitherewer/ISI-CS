 Asia pleads for bird flu help

 Ho Chi Minh City, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Asian countries battling a bird flu virus that threatens to create a human pandemic that could kill millions need urgent help from the wealthy West if they are to succeed, a 28-nation conference said today.

 ?The threat is real and the potential is very high? for a pandemic, Samuel Jutzi of the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation said at the end of the three-day conference on bird flu.

 ?The longer the virus continues to circulate in poultry production systems and ducks, the higher is the probability of infection of humans,? he said in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnams commercial hub. All 28 nations sought ?external support?, Jutzi said, but worst-affected Vietnam is the only one to have appealed for help publicly.

 ?Our financial capacity is limited. We are trying our best,? agriculture minister Cao Duc Phat said. Senior UN officials at the conference have complained about what one called ?an alarming lack of commitment? from rich nations in the fight against the H5N1 virus.

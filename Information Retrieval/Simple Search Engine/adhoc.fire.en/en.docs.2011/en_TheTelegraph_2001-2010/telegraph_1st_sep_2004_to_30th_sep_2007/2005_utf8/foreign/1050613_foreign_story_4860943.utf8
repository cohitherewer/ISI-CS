 First penalty for marital sex assault

 Washington, June 12 (PTI): In the first such conviction in the country, a US court has sentenced a man to seven years in prison for marital sex assault. 

 Valentine Selwyn Boston (41), a resident of Prince Georges County in Maryland, was sentenced to seven years jail for the crime. Bostons wife, mother of a 10-month-old daughter, told the court that she was attacked by him on November 4. The victim testified that she and her husband were going through marital difficulties. She had obtained a protective order that allowed him to stay in the same house so long as he was not violent. 

 But on the night of the assault, he choked her and threatened her with a knife and she submitted. The prosecutor said if she had not submitted under threat, Boston would have been prosecuted for rape instead of sex assault and sentenced to a longer term.

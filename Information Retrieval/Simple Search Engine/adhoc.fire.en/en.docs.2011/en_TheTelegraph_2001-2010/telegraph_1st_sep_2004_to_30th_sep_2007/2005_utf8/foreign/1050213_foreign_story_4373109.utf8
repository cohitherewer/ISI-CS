 18 killed in Iraq blast

 Baghdad, Feb. 12 (Reuters): A suicide car bomber killed 18 people near a hospital south of Baghdad today amid a surge of violence by Iraq?s mostly Sunni insurgents ahead of Ashura, the holiest festival on the Shia religious calendar.

 The bomber drove his vehicle towards local government offices and a hospital in the town of Musayyib, southwest of Baghdad, but detonated it outside blast walls protecting the buildings, police said. 

 Around 25 people were also wounded in the attack, the second suicide car bombing in as many days.

 Militants flee prison

 Bagram (Afghanistan), July 

 11 (Reuters): Four dangerous militants escaped from 

 detention today at the main American base in Afghanistan, 

 the US military said, a new embarrassment for US forces 

 struggling with a worsening Islamic insurgency.

 A major search, involving ground forces and helicopters, was launched after the men were reported missing from the detention centre at Bagram Air Base to the north of Kabul, the military said in a statement.

 Arabic television channel al Jazeera quoted unidentified sources as saying the four men were Arabs, but US military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jerry Hara declined to confirm this, describing them only as dangerous enemy combatants.

 The escape is the first known from the heavily guarded detention centre, which is within the sprawling Bagram base, and as such a major embarrassment for the US military. The men were reported missing at about 0030 GMT. An al Jazeera correspondent, quoting Afghan government sources, later told a news bulletin the escapees were al Qaida members. Dozens of US troops could be seen stopping and searching vehicles every few hundreds metres around the base and nearby villages, while US helicopters flew overhead.

 We consider this very serious business, Hara said. These guys are dangerous not only to Afghanistan but to the world in general. He said there had been no US casualties in the escape and he had no reports of violence or any US personnel missing. I cant give specifics on how they escaped, he said. The circumstances surrounding the escape are under investigation as we speak.

 Hara said the men, who would normally wear orange prison uniforms, could still be on the massive base, about 50 km north of the Afghan capital Kabul, and it was being thoroughly searched by military police.

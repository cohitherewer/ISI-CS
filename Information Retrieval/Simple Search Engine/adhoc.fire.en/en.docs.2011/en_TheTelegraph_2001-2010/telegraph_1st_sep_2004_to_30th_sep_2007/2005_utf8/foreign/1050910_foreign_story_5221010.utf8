 Alam plea rejected

 London, Sept. 9 (Reuters): An appeal by a former lover of England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson against the Football Association for wrongful dismissal and alleged sexual discrimination has been rejected by an employment tribunal.

 The FA has consistently viewed the claims as unsubstantiated and without foundation, it said in a statement today. Former secretary Faria Alam, 39, told the tribunal she had been groped by the FAs executive director David Davies, an allegation he denied as cruel and grotesque. Alam had a relationship with former FA chief executive Mark Palios, which led to his resignation in mid-2004, and with England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson.

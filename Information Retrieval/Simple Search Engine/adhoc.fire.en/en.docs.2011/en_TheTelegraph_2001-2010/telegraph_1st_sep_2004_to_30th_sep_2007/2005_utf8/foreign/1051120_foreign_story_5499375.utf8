 Iraq carnage

 Baghdad, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Car bombs killed at least 48 people in Iraq today, a day after more than 80 died in suicide blasts across the country and as President George W. Bush pledged never to relent in his war on terror.

 In the deadliest of todays attacks, a suicide car bomber blew up his vehicle near crowded condolence tents during the funeral of a Shia tribal sheikh in a town north of Baghdad.

 Police Colonel Muthaffar Aboud said 35 people were killed and around 50 wounded in the attack in Abu Sayda, near Baquba, a violent city about 65 km northeast of Baghdad.

 Earlier, another suicide car bomber targeted a crowded market in the Diyala Bridge area of southern Baghdad, killing 13 people and wounding around 20, the interior ministry said.

 The attacks followed twin suicide bombings at Shia mosques in northeastern Iraq yesterday, strikes that appeared intent on aggravating the countrys sectarian divisions, which have only worsened in the run-up to elections set for December 15.

 Today, Ibrahim Ahmed, a local government official in Khanaqin, the town where the mosques were attacked, played down reports that several people linked to the bombings had been arrested, saying there were no strong leads in the case.

 The Khanaqin blasts followed two suicide car-bomb attacks on a Baghdad hotel popular with journalists and contractors. All told, yesterdays violence left 83 people dead and more than 100 wounded, one of the bloodiest days for Iraq in recent months.

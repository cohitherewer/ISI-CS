 Jude sorry for nanny fling

 Actors Jude Law and Sienna Miller

 London, July 18: Hollywood heartthrob Jude Law has made a public apology to his fiancee, actor Sienna Miller, after revelations of an affair with his nanny.

 The tryst with Daisy Wright, 26, is said to have begun in New Orleans as the actor filmed his new film, All The Kings Men.

 The twice Oscar-nominated actor said he was deeply ashamed and upset at his behaviour, following newspaper reports about the fling with Wright, who was employed to care for his children. Law and Miller, 24, became engaged on Christmas Day, 2004, after a year-long romance. 

 This time last year Law seemed unable to put a foot wrong, starring in a string of successful films and topping the lists of the worlds sexiest and best-dressed men. 

 He and Miller were also named the most sought-after couple on Britains party circuit by Tatler magazine.

 But the Hollywood golden boys star appears to have slipped with the revelation of his latest sexual indiscretion.

 Laws antics appear to mirror those of his character in last years remake of Sixties classic Alfie. Blessed with charisma, good looks and talent, Law seemed perfectly cast to take over Michael Caines role of a charming-but-sad womaniser.

 Hijab heat in UK

 GEORGE JONES

 London, Aug. 4: Muslim women were urged yesterday by a leading Islamic cleric to stop wearing headscarves that could lead to them being attacked or verbally abused.

 Zaki Badawi, head of the Muslim College in London and chairman of the Council of Mosques and Imams, advised them to abandon the traditional hijab because of fears of a backlash against the Muslim community after the London bombings.

 However, Rajnaara Akhtar, chair of the Assembly for the Protection of the Hijab, said that the women she had spoken to had reacted very negatively to Badawis comments.

 She added that women did not want to feel victimised and she did not believe they were in serious danger. 

 Badawis intervention came as a political debate intensified over a call from David Davis, the Conservative shadow home secretary, in yesterdays Daily Telegraph for Muslims to integrate into mainstream British society. 

 Badawi said the preservation of life had a much higher priority than appearance.

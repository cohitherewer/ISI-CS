 Race to outrun a moving hillside

 FRED ALVAREZ

 Los Angeles, Jan. 12: As the rain kept coming and mud started to flow, Greg Ray and Tony Alvis decided to lend a hand, helping move a friend out of a Quonset hut at the base of the hillside in La Conchita, California.

 Together, they had only been at it about 15 minutes when neighbour John Morgan sounded the first warning. ?The mountain is coming down!? he shrieked.

 Standing directly underneath the tumbling hillside, hearing its terrible crackle and roar and watching a plume of earth spew toward the sky, the men broke and ran for their lives.

 With the hillside exploding, shooting dirt and boulders 100 feet high, Ray, 61, sprinted down Vista del Rincon Drive, then wheeled right, onto Santa Barbara Avenue, making a beeline for the ocean. He lost sight of the others as the hillside bore down.

 Out of the corner of one eye, he could see a house and a trailer in hot pursuit. Instinctively, he ducked for cover, throwing himself between two cars and wedging into the smallest of lifesaving cracks, just as the mud and debris washed over him.

 ?I just turned and dove underneath these cars, that?s what saved my life,? said Ray from the county hospital in Ventura, with scratches and bruises and a gaping wound where a splintered wooden stake had speared his right leg. His friends weren?t so lucky. Alvis and Morgan were unable to outrun the slide, succumbing to the wall of mud and debris. 

 Ray said he learned yesterday that the men were found dead on each side of him. ?It was so horrific,? he said. ?It all happened so fast.? It took three hours to rescue Ray, an artist who has lived in La Conchita on and off for a decade. 

 Badly hurt and thrown into pitch-black darkness, he could hear people crying and screaming all around him. He reached down to his injured leg, thinking a piece of wood was laying across it, only to find the stake protruding through the limb. 

 He could turn his head a little and move his hands. While trapped, he took a picture of himself with a disposable camera he was carrying in his shirt pocket. 

 Two friends from the community found him within minutes and alerted rescue crews, who cut him out of the wreckage. ?It was scary. I didn?t really know whether I was going to make it,? Ray said. ?I told myself: ?I just have to bear the pain. I have to make it. I have to survive.??

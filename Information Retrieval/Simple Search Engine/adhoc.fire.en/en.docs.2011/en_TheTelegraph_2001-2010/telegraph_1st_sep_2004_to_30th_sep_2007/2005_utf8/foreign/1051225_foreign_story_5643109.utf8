 Putin shows off his judo skills

 St Petersburg (Russia), Dec. 24 (AP): President Vladimir Putin showed off his judo skills today in nationwide television footage, giving a master class in his hometown.

 Russian television stations showed Putin, barefoot and clad in white kimono, doing exercises with other students and then helping them practice various holds at the judo school that he attended in his college years in St Petersburg.

 Putin attended the lesson with Yasuhiro Yamashita, a legendary world and Olympic judo champion from Japan. Putin met Yamashita on a trip to Tokyo last month and invited him to visit Russia. Last night, Putin treated Yamashita to a dinner at a St Petersburg restaurant.

 Putin has earned a black belt in the sport and co-wrote a judo manual several years ago. When I am on a judo mat, I feel at home, the 16-year veteran of the KGB said once.

 Putins accomplishments in judo and downhill skiing have helped his wide popularity among Russians who like having a physically fit, energetic leader ? a sharp contrast to his ailing predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.

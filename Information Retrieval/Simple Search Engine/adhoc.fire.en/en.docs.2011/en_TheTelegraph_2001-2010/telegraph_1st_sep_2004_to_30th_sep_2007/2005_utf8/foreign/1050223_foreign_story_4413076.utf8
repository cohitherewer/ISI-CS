 Fine Print

 Jackie sale

 Los Angeles, Feb. 22 (AFP): Hong Kong action movie star Jackie Chan has put his Beverly Hills mansion on sale for $6.7 million, The Los Angeles Times reported.

 The kung fu-kicking star of such Hollywood hits as Shanghai Knights (2003), The Tuxedo (2002) and Rush Hour 2 (2001) bought the five-bedroom, 7,600 square-feet Los Angeles bolthole in 1998.

 But the actor, director and businessman, who is still based in Hong Kong, spends only four to six weeks a year in Hollywood and seldom brings his family with him, according to the paper?s property section. The luxurious ?French-style? home, built in 1986, boasts of a ?wood-panelled family room with a step-down bar and temperature-controlled wine closet,? as well as a gym that opens to the backyard, a pool and a spa, the Times said.

 The dining room has a hand-painted ceiling, while the master bedroom suite has its own sitting room. 

 Pool steal

 Oslo, Norway (AP): A Norwegian family?s 

 swimming pool wasn?t just bolted down, it was in the ground. 

 But that wasn?t an impediment to a band of determined thieves. 

 When the Nicolaysen family visited their mountain cabin 

 over the weekend, they discovered a big hole in the yard 

 in place of the swimming pool that had been installed 20 

 years ago. ?We didn?t think it was possible,? Arild Nicolaysen 

 told radio network NRK on Monday.

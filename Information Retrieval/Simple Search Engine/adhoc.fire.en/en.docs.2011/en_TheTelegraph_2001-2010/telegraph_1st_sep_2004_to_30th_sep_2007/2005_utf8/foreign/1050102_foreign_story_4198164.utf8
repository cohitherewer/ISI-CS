 Stone haunted by Alexander flop

 London, Jan. 1: The Hollywood film director Oliver Stone said on Thursday that the flop in America of his ?83 million production about Alexander the Great was ?dismaying?, confessing that more people watched it on the opening weekend in Croatia ?than in the entire? Deep South.

 Stone said: ?I still think it?s a beautiful movie, but Alexander deserves better than I gave him. There was clear resistance to his homosexuality. It became the headline to the movie.?

 ?They called him Alexander the gay. That?s horribly discriminatory, but the film simply didn?t open in the Bible Belt.?

 He said that he should have cut it from three hours to two-and-a-half ?and taken out the homosexuality for the US market and for countries sensitive to such things, like Korea or Greece?. He added: ?Kids weren?t comfortable with men who hugged, a king who cries and expresses tenderness.?

 The director, speaking to Variety and the New York Times, said that he had dreamt of the project since film school. ?I really love this subject so much, but perhaps I just failed to communicate that to an American audience and American critics.?

 So far, the film has limped to an ?18 million gross. Critics have ripped it to pieces. One wrote: ?Easily the most fantastic self-destruction I have witnessed in years, Alexander is sordid evidence of what happens when Hollywood producers, burned-out directors and unenthused stars stand in a circle and set fire to $150 million. The real Alexander isn?t just rolling in his grave, he?s clawing his decayed eyes out.?

 Stone said it was ?always? an uphill battle with the critics. He was hoping for ?a breakthrough? after being off the screen for five years. ?But I was surprised by the hardness of the reviews.?

 Moritz Borman, the chairman of Intermedia, the Beverly Hills company that produced the film, said he hoped that the epic mitigated its losses abroad, in places such as Britain.

 He claimed that Intermedia has covered its flanks with pre-sales: ?We will not lose a penny. But if the picture doesn?t work in some foreign territories, they will take the hit. If the picture makes over $100 million foreign, most will be OK. But if the picture fares the way it did here, they will lose.?

 Stone said that making the film was like trying to wrap his arms around an elephant. It could have been five hours long, giving him the chance to explain the complicated rivalry among Alexander?s mother, wife Roxane, and soul mate Hephiastion.

 The director regretted that critics had attacked Anthony Hopkins? lengthy narration scenes as Ptolemy, and an accent used by Angelina Jolie that reviewers mocked.

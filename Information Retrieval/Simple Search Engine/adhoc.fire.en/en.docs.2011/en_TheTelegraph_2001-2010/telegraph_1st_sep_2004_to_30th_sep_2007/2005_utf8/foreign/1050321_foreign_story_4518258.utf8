 29 die in Pak shrine blast

 Quetta, Pakistan, March 20 (Reuters): A time bomb exploded in a Muslim shrine in southwestern Pakistan as devotees were served food, killing at least 29 people and wounding 40, and police said on Sunday they believed local rivalry was the motive.

 Officials earlier said at least 32 people had been killed in the late Saturday blast at the shrine of a saint near Gandhawa town in the province of Baluchistan, and the motive was initially believed to be either sectarian or separatist.

 But interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said 29 people had been killed and police were investigating the possibility that rivalry between caretakers of the shrine might have been behind the attack.

 ?One possibility that police are investigating is rivalry among the descendants of the saint...there were some disputes among relatives,? Sherpao told Reuters.

 Another possibility was that some conservative Muslims were opposed to the celebration of the saint?s day, which includes dancing and singing by women devotees, he said.

 The shrine, 420 km north of Pakistan?s largest city, Karachi, is a Shiite Muslim place of worship but members of the majority Sunni community also traditionally pay their respects there.

 Baluchistan, Pakistan?s largest but poorest province, has a history of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite militants and has also been troubled recently by attacks by ethnic minority militants fighting for autonomy.

 But Sherpao ruled out the possibility that Sunni-Shiite rivalry or the tribal militants were behind the latest blast.

 The bomb went off as food was being distributed after a ceremony. It weighed about 2 kg, Sherpao said. Many of the injured were hurt in a stampede after the blast, he said.

 Provincial police chief Chaudhry Yaqoob said a timing mechanism had been found.?It was a time bomb because we found a time device,? Yaqoob said.

 Security has been tight in Baluchistan since an attack by the nationalist tribal militants on the country?s largest gas field on January 11, in which at least 15 people were killed.

 On Thursday, eight soldiers were killed and 23 wounded in a battle with the militants on the outskirts of Dera Bugti town, 170 km (100 miles) east of Gandhawa.

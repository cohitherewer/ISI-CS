 Eriksson?s saucy private life hits stage

 Stockholm, March 15 (Reuters): An experimental comedy about the private life of England soccer coach Sven-Goran Eriksson will premiere in Stockholm next month, Sweden?s national theatre said today, and could be on British stages soon.

 The Royal Dramatic Theatre said the play was ?freely inspired? by the Swedish football coach?s private life, whose salacious details have been gleefully reported in the tabloid press in England where he is a national hero.

 A theatre spokeswoman said there would be nothing slanderous in the production called: A play in Swedish English and Italian that will open on April 8.

 ?It is a comedy freely inspired by his life but it is not a biography,? she said.

 ?It is humourous and affectionate and it won?t be anything hurtful. It is not inspired by anything that has not been written before.?

 The main character based on Eriksson is simply called ?The Coach? and the other characters, including those inspired by his lady friends, will not be identified by name. 

 In his native Sweden, 57-year-old Eriksson is greatly admired but is not such a focus of media attention as in Britain, where newspapers have detailed his affairs with fellow Swede and TV celebrity Ulrika Jonsson and a Football Association secretary, Faria Alam.

 Eriksson was the first foreigner to become England coach in 2001 after collecting several cups with Italy?s Lazio. He advanced to an English hero after his team thrashed Germany 5-1 in a World Cup qualifier the same year. The Italian of the play?s title could also refer to his long-time girlfriend Nancy Dell?Olio.

 The co-production is by the Swedish national theatre and a British production company which says it plans to transfer the comedy to Britain after up to 20 performances in Stockholm.

 As the title suggests, the play will be a polyglot experience but the final version is still taking shape. ?We don?t yet know exactly what it will be until the opening night,? said the spokeswoman.

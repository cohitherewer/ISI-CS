 Homeless, but not refugee

 Baton Rouge (Louisiana), Sept. 7: Tyrone McKnight sleeps in a shelter. His meals come from the kindness of strangers. Its safe to call him homeless, because his house is under water.

 What he doesnt want you to call him, or the thousands of other New Orleans residents plucked from floodwater, is this word: refugees. The image I have in my mind is people in a Third World country, the babies in Africa that have all the flies and are starving to death, he says, while sitting outside Baton Rouges convention centre, where 5,000 displaced residents are being housed. Thats not me. Im a law-abiding citizen whos working every day and paying taxes.

 Which label to use when describing evacuees might seem trivial when thousands may be dead, thousands are missing, and a major city and its environs have been ravaged. But at shelters in Louisiana and Texas, workers and volunteers have heard loud and clear from those living there that the government, the media and everyone else should call them something other than refugees. We aint refugees. Im a citizen, insists Annette Ellis, also sheltered at the convention centre with her two children.

 Representatives Diane Watson and Elijah Cummings , both members of the Congressional Black Caucus, raised the issue last week at a news conference called to complain about the slow response to Hurricane Katrina. Refugee calls up to mind people that come from different lands and have to be taken care of, Watson said. These are American citizens.

 Added Cummings: They are not refugees. I hate that word.

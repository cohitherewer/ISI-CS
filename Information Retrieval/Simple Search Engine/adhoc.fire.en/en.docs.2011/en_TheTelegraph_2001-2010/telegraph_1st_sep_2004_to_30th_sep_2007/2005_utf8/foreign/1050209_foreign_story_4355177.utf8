 Neutral expert for Indo-Pak dam row

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb 8: The World Bank plans to appoint a neutral expert to resolve a row between India and Pakistan over Indian plans to build a dam on the Chenab river in Kashmir, bank president James Wolfensohn said today.

 ?There are no complexities involved in appointment of neutral expert, whose findings will be binding on both the countries,? Wolfensohn said after meeting both President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in Islamabad.

 Pakistan asked the Washington-based bank to resolve the dispute after bilateral talks on the issue broke down last month. Pakistan objects to India?s plans to build the dam, saying it would affect river flows into Pakistan and contravene the World Bank-brokered water accord. India counters that the project does not propose to store water and will not disrupt flows.

 Wolfensohn denied the World Bank is a guarantor to the substance of the Indus Water Treaty, 1960, saying the bank?s job is to follow the terms of the accord. ?The treaty has served both the countries very well over the years,? he said.

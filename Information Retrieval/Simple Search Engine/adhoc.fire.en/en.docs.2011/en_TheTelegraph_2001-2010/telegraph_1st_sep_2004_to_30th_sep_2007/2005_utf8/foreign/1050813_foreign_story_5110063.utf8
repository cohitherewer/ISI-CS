 Lanka minister shot, in critical condition

 Kadirgamar

 Colombo, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Sri Lankan foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was shot near his Colombo residence late today and rushed to intensive care in critical condition, police said.

 The shooting comes amid escalating tensions between the government and the Tamil Tigers rebels, who have repeatedly threatened to resume a two-decade civil war because of a rash of violence in the islands restive east that each side blames on the other.

 The foreign minister was shot. He is being treated in intensive care, said Constable H.A. Hemapala, who is attached to the police unit at the National Hospital in Colombo.

 Military and government sources confirmed the shooting. His condition is critical, said a top government aide on condition of anonymity. We are awaiting further news from the hospital.

 Officials declined to comment when asked who was suspected to be behind the shooting. Police cordoned off the roads around the residence of Kadirgamar, a top adviser of President Chandika Kumaragtunga in Sri Lankas protracted peace process with the Tigers. Helicopters circled overhead. 

 Heavily armed police officers fanned out into the plush central Colombo neighbourhood, searching the area.

 Kadirgamar is a Tamil Christian, an unusual combination in a country dominated by Sinhalese Buddhists and Tamils. 

 He was educated at Trinity College, Kandy, and obtained a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) degree in 1953. He also has a B.Lit. from Oxford University. He practiced law at the Lanka Bar and in London until 1974, when he became a consultant to the International Labour Organisation in Geneva.

 Kadirgamar is a long-time supporter of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). He was foreign minister in the SLFP government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. After the defeat of the government in 2001, he became special adviser on foreign affairs to Kumaratunga. 

 Despite being himself a Tamil, he strongly supported the Bandaranaike governments policy of not negotiating with the Tamil Tigers in northern Sri Lanka.

 In 2003, Kadirgamar was a candidate for the position of secretary-general of the Commonwealth, but was defeated by Don McKinnon of New Zealand.

 In a separate incident, suspected Tamil Tigers today shot dead a Tamil television presenter and her husband, who was a supporter of the anti-rebel front, police said. 

 Relanki Selvarajah, a presenter for the state-run Rupavahini Television Network and her husband S. Selvarajah were shot dead in Colombos Bambalapitiya area.

 Names and the Pontiff

 Vatican City, April 4 (AFP): A new Pope is free to choose a name he wants to carry during his pontificate after he has been elected by cardinals.

 The successor to Pope John Paul II can choose a Latinised form of his Christian name or the name of an earlier Pope, or a saint?s name. He may also want to pick a name that would attribute a quality to him. Some allow personal considerations to guide them, such as Pope John XXII, who chose his name to honour the memory of his father.

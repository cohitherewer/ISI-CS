 Dummy drive

 Tehran, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Police in northeastern Iran are launching a new morality drive by confiscating alluring mannequins from boutiques and clothes stalls in the bazaar, authorities in the city of Bojnourd said today.

 A spokesman for the citys judiciary, who asked not be named, explained the drive would tackle problems of public chastity. Sixty five mannequins have been impounded so far.

 Saw swipe

 Los Angeles (AP): Horror swung a sharper 

 blade than Zorro at the box office. With Halloween at hand, 

 the bloody Saw II won the weekend with $30.5 million, 

 almost double the $16.5 million opening of Antonio Banderas 

 and Catherine Zeta-Jones swashbuckling sequel The 

 Legend of Zorro. Prime, starring Uma Thurman 

 and Meryl Streep in a romance between a thirty-something 

 woman and a younger man, debuted at number 3 with $6.4 million. 

 Nicolas Cages The Weather Man opened at number 

 6 with $4.3 million.

 Suit sale

 Las Vegas (AP): A white suit belonging 

 to John Lennon that he wore on the album cover of Abbey 

 Road sold for $118,000 at an auction, while the Austin 

 Princess he drove in the movie Imagine went for $150,000. 

 Anthony Pugliese of World Films in Del Ray, Florida, bought 

 the suit, and the automobile was bought by a private Japanese 

 investor.

 Sharon quits Likud to start new party

 Jerusalem, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon quit his Right-wing Likud today to lead a new Centrist party into an early election, taking a gamble likely to reshape Israeli politics for years to come.

 Sharons dramatic move, hours after he asked President Moshe Katsav to dissolve parliament and order a new national ballot, could free him of far-Right constraints in pursuing an end to conflict with the Palestinians. But opinion polls said the success of a Sharon-led centrist party was uncertain, and the 77-year-old former general could face an uphill battle against more established factions in an election likely in March.

 While confidants spoke of blazing a path towards peace following a Gaza pullout, Sharon gave no sign of softening his policy towards the Palestinians while seeking to tap into mainstream support for the withdrawal.We do not have any (new peace) plans. I do not see any further disengagement, a spokesman quoted Sharon as saying in reference to the idea of unilateral withdrawals in the occupied West Bank.

 My policy will be to proceed with the road map while at the same time fighting terrorism, the spokesman quoted Sharon as telling 11 Likud members who also jumped ship in the face of a party rebellion against him over the Gaza pullout. Many in Likud saw the Gaza pullout as a surrender to violence.

 The US-backed peace road map calls for an end to violence and charts confidence-building steps, including the disarming of Palestinian militants and an end to Jewish settlement expansion, towards creation of a Palestinian state.

 Iran breaks UN seals at nuke plant

 Vienna, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Iran began breaking UN seals at a uranium processing plant today, UN and Iranian officials said, a step on the road to production of enriched uranium that could be used for nuclear weapons.

 They have begun breaking the seals, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) spokesman Mark Gwozdecky said. 

 They are going to break all the seals and begin operating the plant in full.

 As Iran prepared to restart the sensitive sections of the plant at Isfahan, the EUs three biggest powers tried to persuade the 35-member board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to warn Tehran to stop the work. Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.

 The UN watchdog put on the seals after Tehran agreed with Britain, Germany and France to suspend all nuclear fuel work last November to ease tensions after the IAEA found Iran had hidden weapons-grade highly enriched uranium.

 Earlier this week, Iran restarted work at less sensitive, unsealed areas of the plant after rejecting a package of economic and political incentives from the EU3 to give up its nuclear programme. 

 IAEA officials agreed Tehrans request to remove the seals after installing surveillance cameras to ensure no uranium is shifted away from the plant for any covert weapons work.

 Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, confirmed on Wednesday that the removal had begun.

 Under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Iran has signed, Tehran may process and enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. But the EU3 say the only way to prove peaceful intentions is to renounce all sensitive technologies.

 The German government said Iran had rejected the EU3s incentives after only brief and superficial review and appealed to Tehran to take the sensible path and look at the proposals again. 

 We appeal urgently to the Iranian side to return to the status quo ante, to a full suspension of all enrichment-relevant activities, a government spokesman said.

 The IAEA board convened an emergency meeting yesterday but adjourned to give the trio time to negotiate with other key members of the board about the text of an IAEA resolution urging Iran to resume the suspension.

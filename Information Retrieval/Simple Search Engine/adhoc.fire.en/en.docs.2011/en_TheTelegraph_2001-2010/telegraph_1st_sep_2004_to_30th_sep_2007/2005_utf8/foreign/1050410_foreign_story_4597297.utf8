 Panda smile

 Beijing, April 9 (Reuters): It?s all smiles for Chinese giant panda Xiaopingping.

 The 17-year-old grandfather became the first panda to undergo successful dental treatment, the China Daily reported today, enduring a two-hour root canal operation to repair teeth damaged with age.

 A second panda, 18-year-old Bobo, has had his teeth disinfected as a first step toward the same procedure, which will leave the two able to chomp away at their staple bamboo diet without pain, the newspaper said. 

 White fowl

 Washington (Reuters): Security is tight in front of the 

White House for a new resident ? a Mallard hen sitting on nine eggs she laid at 

the foot of a sapling over the weekend. The mother duck chose for her nest a fresh 

heap of mulch on the sidewalk outside the heavily guarded entrance of the treasury 

department, next door to the presidential residence. Officers have erected metal 

stanchions around the tree to shield the incubating bird from passersby on the 

crowded pedestrian plaza. ?I?m getting more calls on this than on the Chinese 

currency,? treasury spokesman Rob Nichols said. Treasury staff have dubbed the 

bird ?T-bill,? ?Duck Cheney,? and ?Quacks Reform,? Nichols said.

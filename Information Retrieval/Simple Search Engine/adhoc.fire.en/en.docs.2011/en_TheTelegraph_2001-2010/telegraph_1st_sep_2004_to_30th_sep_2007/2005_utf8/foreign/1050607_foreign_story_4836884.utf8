 Britain puts referendum bill on hold

 London, June 6 (Reuters): Britain today shelved plans to hold a referendum on the EUs troubled constitution, dealing another blow to a treaty already rejected by French and Dutch voters.

 Foreign secretary Jack Straw told Parliament the rejection of the charter in France and the Netherlands had cast its future into doubt, so the government was putting enabling legislation to hold a vote on ice until after EU leaders discussed the way forward at a summit next week.

 We reserve completely the right to bring back the bill providing for a UK referendum should circumstances change. But we see no point in proceeding at this moment, Straw said. It is not for the UK alone to decide the future of the treaty.

 While theoretically reversible, the British decision ran counter to a plea by EU heavyweights France and Germany at the weekend for all other member states to continue the ratification process despite the French and Dutch No votes. 

 EU leaders played down the British move and avoided direct criticism of London. 

 French European affairs minister Catherine Colonna, speaking just before Straws announcement, said: Its a question of democracy. Its not for one member of the EU to decide for the others, or to block the process of ratification of a treaty signed by 25 countries.

 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said it was up to each member state to decide how and when to ratify the text, but he did not believe Britain or any other country had taken a definitive decision not to do so.

 Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who holds the EUs rotating presidency, said the British decision meant the charter was not dead.

 Straw was careful to avoid saying the constitution, designed to give an enlarged EU a more efficient decision-making system, was defunct. But the Eurosceptic opposition Conservative party sought to kill it off.

 This is a constitution that is bad for Britain and bad for Europe, said Conservative foreign affairs spokesperson Liam Fox. I can tell a corpse when I see one. This constitution is a case for the morgue.

 Financial analysts said the British move would increase pressure on the euro, although the currency markets had already priced in the failure of the constitution.

 It does mean the end of the constitution in its current form and it will intensify the debate on the future shape of the constitution, said Mitul Kotecha, head of FX research at investment bank Calyon.

 It is another blow for the euro, but so much of this is already reflected in the price.

 The decision means Prime Minister Tony Blair, who takes the EU chair for six months from July, does not have to hold a referendum next year which opinion polls suggest he would have lost heavily, possibly bringing his premiership to an early end.

 But Britain has avoided blame for sinking the charter, since it was French and Dutch voters who dealt the decisive blows.

 Prison abuse in Iraq again

 Baghdad, Nov. 15 (Reuters): Iraq is investigating allegations of abuse after more than 170 prisoners were found locked in an interior ministry bunker in Baghdad, many of them beaten and malnourished and some apparently tortured.

 The detainees were discovered on Sunday night during a raid by US troops who were searching for a missing teenage boy.

 They were found in an underground cell near an interior ministry compound in Jadriya, a central Baghdad neighbourhood, and many of them showed signs of severe hunger and beatings. I was informed that there were 173 detainees held at an interior ministry prison and they appear to be malnourished, Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari said.

 There is also some talk that they were subjected to some kind of torture, he said.

 Earlier a deputy interior minister put the number of prisoners at 161 and said he was stunned by their treatment. They were being treated in an inappropriate way... they were being abused, Hussein Kamal said. Ive never seen such a situation like this during the past two years in Baghdad, this is the worst, he said.

 I saw signs of physical abuse by brutal beating, one or two detainees were paralysed and some had their skin peeled off various parts of their bodies. 

 This is totally unacceptable treatment and it is denounced by the minister and everyone in Iraq, he said.

 Kamal said the detainees had all originally been detained with arrest warrants but didnt say when. They had now been moved to another facility.

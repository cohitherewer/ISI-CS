 William, the country boy

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 Prince William

 London, June 26: Prince William has set his heart on a career in the countryside and not in the armed forces, his closest friends say.

 He hopes that his work experience this autumn, learning about land management on a country estate, will lead him towards a similar job in the future. 

 According to his friends, Prince William is almost certain to join the armed forces but unlike his brother, Prince Harry, he is looking only at a short stint in the military.

 Prince William said last week he will do three work experience placements at the end of summer: at a financial institution in the city, helping with a mountain rescue team, and on a country estate. The land management experience will hopefully allow me to develop skills and an understanding of how best to look after the countryside, he said.

 When the prince was a boy, his mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, said he was like a caged lion in London and she encouraged him to spend time in the country with friends. There is no doubt that William is a country boy at heart, said one family friend.

 During his gap year before university, Prince William spent time in South America, Africa and the Caribbean. However, he told friends that the best part of the whole year was the month he spent on a farm in the West Country. 

 He was getting up at 4am to milk the cows, but he loved it, said one of his close friends. That tells you a lot about William. 

 One royal official said yesterday: Running a country estate is going to be part of his life at some point in the future ? either as a career or simply when he becomes Prince of Wales and thereby inherits the rights to the Duchy of Cornwall (the landed estate that provides Prince Charles with his income).

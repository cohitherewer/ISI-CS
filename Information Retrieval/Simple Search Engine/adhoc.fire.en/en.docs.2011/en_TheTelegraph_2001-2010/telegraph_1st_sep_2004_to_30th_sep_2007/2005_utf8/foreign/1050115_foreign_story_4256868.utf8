 California killer slide moving again

 La Conchita (California), Jan. 14 (Reuters): Rescuers called off search and recovery efforts today at the site of a mudslide that killed 10 people when it hit a seaside California town and urged residents to leave in case of another collapse.

 The huge pile of sodden earth that swallowed 15 houses on Monday in La Conchita, 130 km north of Los Angeles, began moving again. The 10-metre-deep mound shifted about 1.8 metres yesterday and would likely remain unstable, authorities said.

 ?We believe both the rescue and recovery processes are done,? Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks said. ?We do not recommend people return to this area. Every day, rain or shine, there is the danger of another slide.?

 County officials said they would help residents move their belongings out of homes that were condemned but added no remediation efforts were planned to avert further slides. ?The pile may never be moved,? Ventura county fire chief Bob Roper said yesterday.

 Rescue workers held a memorial service for the people who died when an estimated 1.7 million tonnes of earth slammed into a four-block area in the seaside enclave after weeks of drenching rain.

 More than 30 homes have been destroyed or condemned, but an unknown number of residents remained in the community of 260 anyway, in some cases living in homes that were ?yellow-tagged? as potential hazards.

 Resident Bill Malice, who was evacuated early today, said he did not want to leave despite the threat of more damage from the slide.

 ?I?m way down at the other end of town. I feel secure where I am,? Malice said, adding that he did not trust rescue personnel to tell residents the truth about the danger. Residents said they were preparing to square off with county officials over whether the town, located on a slip of slide-prone land between steep cliffs and the Pacific Ocean, could safely be rebuilt.

 Ventura county supervisor Steve Bennett visited the site yesterday to gather information from geologists but said it was too soon to tell if La Conchita could be rebuilt. ?I have a healthy respect for trying to turn back Mother Nature. I have an open mind,? he said.

 Washington, Jan. 21 (Reuters): President George W. Bush capped the first night of his second term yesterday with a whirlwind tour of nine inaugural balls and an early return home at 10.03 pm.

 In a scene repeated throughout the evening, the President arrived to applause, thanked revellers in packed ballrooms and then took a quick spin around the stage with First Lady Laura Bush, who wore a blue-and-silver evening gown by designer Oscar de la Renta.

 Bush quipped that this was perhaps the first time he had danced with his wife in the last four years. After a brief spin, the couple headed on to the next ball. Conveniently, six of the nine balls were held at the Washington Convention Center.

 Not known for keeping late hours, Bush was back at the White House just after 10 pm, close to his usual bedtime and 82 minutes ahead of schedule. 

 Vice-president Dick Cheney kept up the early-night theme in an appearance at the ?Texas-Wyoming? ball, before the Bush party arrived.

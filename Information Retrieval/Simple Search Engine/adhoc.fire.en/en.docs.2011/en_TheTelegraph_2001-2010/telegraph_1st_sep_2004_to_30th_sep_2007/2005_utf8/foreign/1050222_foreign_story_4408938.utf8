 Fairy-tale reunion

 Sydney, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Australian health minister Tony Abbott said he was ?flabbergasted? to be reunited with the son he gave up for adoption 27 years ago, Especially as they unknowingly worked side-by-side the past three years.

 Abbott, first elected to parliament in 1994, said he was contacted late last year by Daniel ?Connor, the infant boy he and his teenage girlfriend gave up for adoption in 1977. It turned out both men, who bear an uncanny resemblance, worked on opposite sides of the microphone in parliament house, ?Connor as a sound technician for the Australian Broadcasting Corp. and Abbott speaking as a government minister.

 ?I was flabbergasted, but thought to myself: ?What do you know? Truth is stranger than fiction,?? Abbott told reporters about his Christmas reunion with the son he last held as a five-day-old baby. Speaking from England where he is travelling, ?Connor told ABC Radio: ?I was surprised that I worked in the same building as him. We sat down and had a chat.?

 ?Connor often worked beside his biological father at news conferences in the sprawling government building in Canberra, even unwittingly fitting microphones to his father?s lapel or adjusting his earpiece, the ABC said. Abbott, who went on to become a Rhodes scholar before working as a reporter and entering politics, appealed for the privacy of ?Connor?s adoptive family.

 Prime Minister John Howard, however, seemed to hit the right note on a day that had radio talk shows buzzing nationwide.

 ?I think it is a wonderful story,? Howard said in New Zealand, where he is visiting his cross-Tasman counterpart, Prime Minister Helen Clark.

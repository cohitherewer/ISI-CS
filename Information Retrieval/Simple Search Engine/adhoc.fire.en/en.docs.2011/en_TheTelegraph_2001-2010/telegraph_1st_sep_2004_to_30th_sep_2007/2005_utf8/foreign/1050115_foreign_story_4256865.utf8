 Canals dry out in Venice

 Venice, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Gondolas are running aground and hotel docks hang in midair as Italy?s lagoon city Venice, more commonly awash at high tide, dries out because of good weather and an unusual combination of planetary influences.

 Only the Grand Canal, Venice?s biggest and most famous waterway, can still take water traffic, and the falling canal levels have given rise to terms such as ?ghost town? and ?desert? in local papers.

 ?The phenomenon is due to low pressure, that is, the good weather that coincides with the syzygy, the alignment of the moon, earth and sun,? said Venice?s tides office.

 The new moon this week has helped push water levels to their lowest point in more than a decade, nearly 80 cm below sea level, it said.

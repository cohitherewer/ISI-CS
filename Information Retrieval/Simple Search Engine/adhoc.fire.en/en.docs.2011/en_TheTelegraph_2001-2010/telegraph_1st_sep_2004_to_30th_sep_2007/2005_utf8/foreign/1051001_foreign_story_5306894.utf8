 UK crown for US show

 London, Sept. 30 (Reuters): The US breakfast TV show Good Morning America is to be broadcast live from Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle ? and Queen Elizabeth very much approves.

 The British monarch will not be in residence at either of her English homes when the show goes out ? she is currently at her Balmoral residence in Scotland ? but believes the coverage could boost UK tourism.

 The show will be broadcast live next Thursday from Windsor Castles state rooms and switch the next day to the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace. Officials have been concerned that the July suicide bombings in the capital could prompt many tourists to stay away.

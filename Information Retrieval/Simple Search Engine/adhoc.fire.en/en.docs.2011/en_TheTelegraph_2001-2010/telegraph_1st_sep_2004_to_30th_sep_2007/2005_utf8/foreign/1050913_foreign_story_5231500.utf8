 Depp captive to Pirates

 Toronto, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Johnny Depp, the chameleon-like actor who has played so many different roles that he may not have a self, says hes finally found a role he wants to stay in: the buccaneer Captain Jack Sparrow.

 Sequels frighten Depp, but he said the chance to reprise his role as the suave Sparrow in the next two editions of Pirates of the Caribbean was too delicious to pass up.

 For an actor who has received far more critical praise than box office success, it is not about the money.

 More than it having anything to do with money, or franchise, or hopefully continued success, it actually had... more to do with selfishly being able to meet up with that character again, Depp said in an interview at the Toronto Film Festival yesterday.

 He was in town to promote Corpse Bride, an animated feature made by his longtime friend, director Tim Burton.

 Depp said he is often felt separation anxiety when he finishes a film, notably after his breakthrough performance in Edward Scissorhands, also directed by Burton.

 But he said he developed a deep affinity with Jack Sparrow, a character based on Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Depp was nominated for a best actor Oscar for the role.

 Depp had a sneaking suspicion hed see Sparrow again after Pirates was released in 2003, but never imagined he would be part of a franchise. Two Pirates sequels are filming in the Bahamas and are slated for release in 2006 and 2007.

 Over the years, Depp has played many odd characters like Hunter S. Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the cocaine trafficker George Jung in Blow, and Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie in Finding Neverland. Ive always considered myself very lucky to still be getting jobs after all the weirdness Ive put people through in terms of having to watch my films, he said.

 Hes basically a great character actor in a leading mans body. Hes always kept that integrity. To me, its something I find really amazing in this business, said Burton, who has cast Depp in five movies.

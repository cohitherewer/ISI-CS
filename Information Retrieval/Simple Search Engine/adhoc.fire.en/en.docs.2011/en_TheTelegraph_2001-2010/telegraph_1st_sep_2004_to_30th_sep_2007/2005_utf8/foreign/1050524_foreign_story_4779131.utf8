 Pak rape blow to Musharraf

 Islamabad, May 23 (Reuters): Pakistan has ordered an investigation into allegations a policeman raped two women in custody, just weeks after President Pervez Musharraf ordered an inquiry into a teenagers complaint of rape by police.

 For a very long time such incidents have happened in Pakistan but people have tried to cover them up, Shahzad Waseem, the deputy minister of interior, said. We have tried to confront them and we are confronting them.

 The latest move follows a complaint by two women that they were raped at a police station in Islamabad on Tuesday night, Waseem said. He said the officer accused of the rape had been detained and four others had been suspended from duty.

 The News daily said Musharraf had taken a personal interest in the latest case and had instructed officials to keep him informed.

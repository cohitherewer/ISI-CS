 Paris, Aug. 30 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac ordered action on fire safety today after seven immigrants, including four children, died in a blaze in a rundown building in central Paris only days after a similar tragedy.

 Yesterday nights fire raised new questions about the conservative governments fire safety record and housing policies, coming just three days after 17 African immigrants died in a blaze in another district of the capital.

 Chirac expressed his horror at the latest fire, offered his condolences to bereaved families and ordered a prompt investigation into what he called another dreadful fire.

 What seems to me to be vital today, after this second drama, is that we, together with all the relevant authorities ... take the measures needed to avoid dramas such as this, he said during a visit to the city of Reims northeast of Paris.

 Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin would shortly announce strong new measures, Chirac said. The Prime Ministers office said an official inquiry into the fire was under way.

 Firefighters struggled for an hour to bring last nights blaze under control after it broke out in the stairwell of a building in the historic Marais district of the French capital, fire officials said.

 Some terrified residents jumped from windows in an effort to escape the flames.

 A fire brigade spokesman said six people died at the scene. A hospital spokeswoman said a child who fell from the building during the fire later died from injuries.

 Five firefighters were among 13 people injured. Two people were in a serious condition in hospital.

 Immigrants rights groups and Opposition politicians have accused the government of complacency over housing conditions for immigrants, which first hit the headlines in April when a fire killed 24 people at a Paris hotel used by immigrants.

 Pierre Aidenbaum, mayor of the Paris district where yesterdays fire broke out, told France Info radio around a dozen families from west Africas Ivory Coast had lived in the building.

 These people were living in unacceptable and dangerous circumstances, he said. Officials said the city had bought the building but had been unable to rehouse the residents pending a major refurbishment. Aidenbaum urged local authorities in the suburbs surrounding Paris to play their part by providing low cost public housing.

 The tragedies have sparked outrage over safety standards in hostels and rundown buildings used to house immigrants.

 This gives a real idea of the toughness of the society we live in, so the authorities should fulfil the undertakings it has made, Francois Bayrou, leader of the centrist UDF party and a government critic, told France 2 television.

 Thousands of immigrants and poor families live in rundown hotels or shabby buildings in Paris because of pressure on housing.

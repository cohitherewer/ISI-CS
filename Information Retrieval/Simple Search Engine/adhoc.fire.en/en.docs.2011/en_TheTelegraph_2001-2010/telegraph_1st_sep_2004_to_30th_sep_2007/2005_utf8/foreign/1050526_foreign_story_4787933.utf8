 House defies Bush on stem cells

 Washington, May 25: Defying a veto threat from President Bush, the House of Representatives voted yesterday to loosen restrictions on funding for embryonic stem cell research, siding with patients who have debilitating diseases over conservatives who call the research immoral.

 The 238-194 vote brought together most Democrats and a group of 50 Republicans, whose support put them at odds with the conservative House leadership. 

 While proponents fell well short of the two-thirds majority they would need to override a veto, sponsors of the bill said they hoped the vote would draw Bush into talks on a compromise that would expand federal support for the research.

 The House vote put Bush in a predicament. 

 Social conservatives who are a core part of the Republican base object to the research because it destroys human embryos. Bush has said he would use the first-ever veto of his presidency to ensure limits on the research are not eased.

 But a veto might have repercussions at the polls. Many patient groups and scientists say that the research has the potential to cure diseases, and a recent Gallup poll found that 60 per cent of Americans find it morally acceptable.

 The legislation also has strong support in the Republican-dominated Senate. 

 Yesterday, Bush stood his ground. After meeting families who have had children from embryos donated by other couples, the President said the vote raised grave moral issues.

 This bill would take us across a critical ethical line by creating new incentives for the ongoing destruction of emerging human life, Bush said. Crossing this line would be a great mistake.

 On the House floor, majority leader Tom DeLay likened embryonic stem cell research to killing some in the hopes of saving others. But his impassioned appeal was of little avail.

 It was the second time in two days that Republican moderates bucked the conservative congressional leadership.

 On Monday, a group of Republican Senate moderates had helped stop a drive by Senate majority leader Bill Frist to strip Democrats of the ability to block Bushs judicial nominees by filibuster.

 Among those asking lawmakers to support the stem cell bill was Representative James R. Langevin, whose spine was severed in a gun accident as a teen. Langevin said he believed embryonic stem cell research was very consistent with his opposition to abortion.

 What could be more pro-life than extending and improving the quality of life of people suffering from disease? Langevin, who uses a wheelchair, asked during a news conference held by supporters of the bill.

 Stem cells from embryos are thought to be able to develop into any type of cell in the body, such as heart muscle and neurons in the brain. 

 Scientists theorise that if they can discover how that development occurs, they may be able to create a cellular repair kit for the human body, as well as learn how to make cells and tissues that could be transplanted into patients.

 The cells are typically collected from embryos created at fertility clinics. Doctors often create more test-tube embryos than women actually use in the course of trying to become pregnant. The unused embryos are usually frozen, and many are eventually discarded as medical waste.

 Under pressure to fund research using stem cells drawn from those embryos, Bush announced in August 2001 that he would allow the federal government to back the research, but only on stem cells that had already been created. The President said he did not want to induce researchers to destroy additional embryos.

 Privately funded research was not affected by the presidents order.

 Since Bushs announcement, many of the groups of stem cells that were thought to be available for research

 have turned out to be unusable, and others are now

 thought to be unsuitable for experiments involving

 transplantation into patients. Scientists have created

 new groups of embryonic stem cells since August 2001,

 but they are not eligible for taxpayer-funded

 experiments under Bushs policy.

 Under the House legislation, sponsored by Reps.

 Michael N. Castle (R-Del.) and Diana DeGette

 (D-Colo.), the federal government could fund research

 involving embryonic stem cells no matter when they

 were created. The stem cells would still have to come

 from embryos donated by fertility clinic patients who

 no longer planned to use them to become pregnant.

 After the vote, Castle said one possible compromise

 with Bush might be to move forward the August 2001

 cutoff date that Bush set. The pool of stem cells

 eligible for federally funded experiments would then

 be larger, but not unlimited.

 quot;We have moved this issue forward tremendously, quot;

 Castle said. quot;My sense is the White House cannot

 ignore this vote. The Senate certainly will not ignore

 it. quot;

 Castle is a member of a group of centrist Republicans

 called the Main Street Partnership, and the group

 Tuesday boasted of its role in passing the

 legislation. Democrats also cheered the House vote on

 the stem cell measure. quot;The bill is maddeningly

 reasonable, quot; DeGette told reporters. quot;It takes embryos

 that will be thrown out and uses them to the greater

 good. Its taking something that will be thrown away

 and using it for ethical research. quot;

 But the Bush administration said the bill would cross

 a line drawn by the president.

 The legislation, said a White House policy document

 distributed to lawmakers, quot;would compel all American

 taxpayers to pay for research that relies on the

 intentional destruction of human embryos for the

 derivation of stem cells, overturning the presidents

 policy that supports research without promoting such

 ongoing destruction. quot;

 An embryo, DeLay said during the debate, quot;is a baby in

 development. quot;

 quot;The best we can say about embryonic stem cell

 research is that its a scientific exploration into

 potential benefits [from] killing human beings, quot; DeLay

 said. Such research can only be carried out by

 quot;deliberate destruction of a unique, living,

 integrated human person, quot; he added.

 Abortion rights opponents said they are not against

 all stem cell research ? only that which involves

 human embryos. 

 They say that stem cells can be ethically harvested

 from adults, and that umbilical cord blood holds great

 promise as a source.

 In a separate vote Tuesday, the House overwhelmingly

 approved legislation to provide $79 million in federal

 funds to collect stem cells from umbilical cord blood

 and facilitate medical research on therapeutic uses.

 The legislation, approved 431-1, would also set up a

 national registry to help patients looking for

 matches.

 Some conservative leaders in the House had hoped the

 cord blood bill would draw votes away from the

 legislation promoting embryonic stem cell research.

 However, supporters of the Castle-DeGette legislation

 said that stem cells from embryos had greater

 possibilities of being developed into the different

 types of cells that might be used to treat patients.

 Cord blood cells have been mainly used to treat blood

 disorders.

 Castle and DeGette urged their supporters to vote for

 the cord blood bill as a complementary measure. 

 Since Bushs 2001 order, embryonic stem cell research

 has gained support from prominent individuals. Castle

 said that former First Lady Nancy Reagan, for example,

 lobbied for his bill by calling House Republicans.

 Reagan has supported embryonic stem cell research in

 the hope that it could provide a cure for Alzheimers,

 the disease that took President Reagans life. 

 The debate in the House gained urgency after South

 Korean scientists last week announced a potential

 breakthrough in stem cell research.

 They said they had produced embryonic clones of sick

 and injured patients and used them to create lines of

 stem cells that were genetic matches for those

 patients.

 Such techniques offer the potential of developing

 tissues that would not be rejected by a patients body

 after transplantation. However, the scientists said

 they opposed using cloning to produce babies.

 Some House lawmakers said they feared moral

 compunction would cause the United States to lose its

 place as a leader in medical innovation.

 quot;For America to stand back because of a moral

 principle and not allow this scientific research to

 proceed is unconscionable, quot; said Rep. Charles F. Bass

 (R-N.H.).

 Although the House debate involved federally funded

 research, health policy expert Gail R. Wilensky said

 that privately funded studies were proceeding with no

 government oversight.

 quot;There is a downside to having this very small federal

 involvement, quot; said Wilensky, who has served as an

 advisor to the current and the first President Bush.

 quot;You can make the argument that having the government

 involved provides additional protections. The presence

 of the federal government forces ethical

 considerations to be introduced. quot;

 The 50 Republicans voting to ease Bushs limits on

 embryonic stem cell research were joined by 187

 Democrats and one independent. Voting against the bill

 were 180 Republicans and 14 Democrats. 

 All of Californias Democratic House members voted in

 favor of the bill, except Juanita Millender-McDonald

 of Carson, who did not vote.

 California Republicans who voted for the bill were

 Mary Bono of Palm Springs, Ken Calvert of Riverside,

 Randy quot;Duke quot; Cunningham of San Diego, David Dreier of

 San Dimas, Darrell E. Issa of Vista, Jerry Lewis of

 Redlands, Howard P. quot;Buck quot; McKeon of Santa Clarita,

 Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach and Bill Thomas

 of Bakersfield.

 California Republicans opposing the bill were

 Christopher Cox of Newport Beach, John T. Doolittle of

 Rocklin, Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley, Wally Herger

 of Marysville, Duncan Hunter of El Cajon, Dan Lungren

 of Chico, Gary G. Miller of Diamond Bar, Devin Nunes

 of Tulare, Richard W. Pombo of Tracy, George P.

 Radanovich of Mariposa and Edward R. Royce of

 Fullerton.

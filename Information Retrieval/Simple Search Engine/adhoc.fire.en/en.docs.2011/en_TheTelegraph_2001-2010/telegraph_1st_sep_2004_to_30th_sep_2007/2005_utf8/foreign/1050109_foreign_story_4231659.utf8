 Radicals monitor Aceh aid mission

 Banda Aceh (Indonesia), Jan. 8: Radical Islamic groups, some accused of links to terrorism, have moved supporters from all over Indonesia to the tsunami-struck region of Aceh to ?make their presence felt? in the disaster zone.

 One, Laskar Mujahidin, whose leader is in prison accused of responsibility for the Bali bombing two years ago, has established a small camp at the military airport in Banda Aceh, the hub of the international aid operation.

 At the entrance is a sign in English reading: ?Islamic Law Enforcement?. Salman al Farisi, the camp?s leader, said: ?We are ready to go out to the fields to send a message about sharia to the people.? Other groups, such as the international Islamic political movement Hizbut Tahrir, have visible representation, but all appear to be playing down the anti-western part of their message.

 Laskar Mujahidin, part of a wider grouping called Majelis Mojahidin Indonesia, was led by Abu Bakar Bashir until his arrest over the 2002 Bali bombings.

 He, and the group, were accused of being a front for Jemaah Islamiyah, regarded as a southeast Asian wing of al Qaida. Al Farisi said he had brought 90 volunteers to Aceh following the disaster. Other groups are also here, such as Hisbut Tahrir, a radical Islamic political movement which has had representatives stationed near Banda Aceh?s central Raya Baiturrahman mosque.

 He said the main purpose was simply ?about humanity?.

 Al Farisi added that he had ?no problem? with the presence of Americans, Australians and other foreigners in Indonesia, but, asked why his sign was in English, he admitted: ?It is partly a message to foreigners that this is a Muslim country.?

 He also said he was monitoring closely the way the Americans and Australians were distributing aid, noticing that some appeared not to be going through Banda Aceh airport like the rest. ?This is suspicious,? he said.

 Al Farisi, who worked as Bashir?s bodyguard, claimed that his leader was innocent of terrorism and that the Americans and Australians were behind the ?false accusations?.

 Rumours that the Americans would exploit their humanitarian role in the crisis to establish a long-term military presence in the world?s most populous Muslim nation forced the Indonesian military spokesman to hold a press conference yesterday and issue a denial. 

 ?They are merely dealing with a humanitarian operation, not a military one,? said Major General Syafrie Syamsuddin.

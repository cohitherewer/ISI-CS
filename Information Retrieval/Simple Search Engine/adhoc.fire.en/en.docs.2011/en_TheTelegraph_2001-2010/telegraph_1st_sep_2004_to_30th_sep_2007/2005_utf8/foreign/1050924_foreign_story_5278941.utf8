 Clooney denies Pitt, Jolie union at his villa

 Clooney: No secrets

 Washington, Sept. 23 (AP): If Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are planning to get married at George Clooneys villa in Italy, its news to him.

 People have said they were going to get married at my house, Clooney said in a recent interview. Well, I would know, and I can tell you theres not going to be a secret wedding.

 Tabloids have reported that Pitt and Jolie were planning to wed in a private ceremony at Clooneys villa. While magazines have published numerous photos of the couple together, neither has confirmed they are dating ? and Clooney wouldnt either.

 Ive met Angelina ? I like her very much ? but I would never talk about whether they are together or not, the 44-year-old actor said. I dont speak of my own personal life ? I would never speak of my friends.

 Clooneys new film, Good Night, and Good Luck, will open in the US on October 14.

 Meanwhile, several shoppers at the West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Canada, reported seeing the Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith co-stars with Jolies two children, Maddox and Zahara, on Wednesday.

 Kayla Penny, who works in a clothing store, told a TV station that she and her co-workers immediately rushed to snap pictures of the couple on their cell phones. She said most onlookers behaved well.

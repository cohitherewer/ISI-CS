 Poll stink

 Kabul, Sept. 18: It is an insult normally confined to the playground rather than bandied around in political debate. But in the run-up to todays historic Afghan parliamentary elections, the vexed question of whether a certain candidate smells or not has become a potentially vote-winning issue.

 Farida Kuchi, an illiterate Kuchi nomad, was incensed when her posh parliamentary rival Parweena Durrani said that she stank to high heaven. Like any good politician, however, she has now managed to spin the slur to her advantage.

 Of course we smell bad, she told a gathering of fellow Kuchis. We are Kuchis and we have to live in dirty places and use animal dung for our fires. What does she know about the problems of the Kuchi?

 New way to help brain grow its own tissue

 Washington, June 13 (Reuters): Scientists working in mice said they had found a way to identify master cells in the brain and grow them in large batches ? a potential way of helping patients grow their own brain tissue transplants.

 The scientists said they had found a process to make the cells multiply, which would be crucial in fighting degenerative brain diseases like Parkinsons and Huntingtons. The study is one of many focusing on stem cells ? the elusive progenitor cells that are found in all tissue and in blood, but which are difficult to identify.

 In theory, once isolated and cultivated with the right compounds and under the right conditions, they should be able to grow out into large lines, or batches, of the desired tissue.

 These so-called adult stem cells could come from a patient himself so no donor and no immune system suppressing drugs would be needed. 

 Weve isolated for the first time what appears to be the true candidate stem cell, said Dennis Steindler of the University of Florida.

 There have been other candidates but in this case we used a special microscope that allows us to watch living cells over long periods of time through a method called live-cell microscopy, so weve actually witnessed the stem cell give rise to new neurons. Possibly a different method may come up to identify the mother of all stem cells, but were confident this is it.

 The researchers said they also found an efficient way to make the cells multiply. Its like an assembly line to manufacture and increase the number of brain cells, said Dr Bjorn Scheffler, a neuroscientist at the University of Florida who led the study.

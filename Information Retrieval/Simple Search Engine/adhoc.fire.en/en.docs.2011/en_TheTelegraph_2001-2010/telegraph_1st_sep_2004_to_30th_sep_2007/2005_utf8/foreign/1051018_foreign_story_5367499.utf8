 Mobile mistake

 Sofia, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Two Bulgarian border policemen caught red-handed after stealing a mobile telephone belonging to US ambassador John Beyrle could face up to 10 years in prison, officials said today.

 The two took the expensive telephone after Beyrle left it by an X-ray machine at Varna airport, where they worked. They denied having seen the phone when the ambassador called to enquire about it, but the hi-tech gadgets in-built tracking system led to its eventual location in one of the mens pockets.

 Bulgarias interior ministry said the two policemen would be fired and their superiors disciplined following the incident.

 Fog settles

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The Fog 

 crept its way to number one in a relatively quiet weekend 

 at the North American box office, grossing $12.2 million 

 to leave two other new wide-release films in the mist, according 

 to studio estimates issued on Sunday. Columbia Pictures 

 low-budget update of the 1980 horror film bumped last weekends 

 number one film, clay-animation adventure Wallace amp; 

 Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, to second place 

 with ticket sales of $11.7 million. Two rival newcomers 

 at the box office ? Cameron Crowes Elizabethtown 

 and Domino ? opened at third and sixth place.

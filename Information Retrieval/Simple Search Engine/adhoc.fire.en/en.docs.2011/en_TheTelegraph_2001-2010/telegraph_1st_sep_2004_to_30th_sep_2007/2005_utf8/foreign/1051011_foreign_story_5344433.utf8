 Prince picks king of banks

 William: Self-help

 London, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Prince William, second in line to the British throne, is to join Britains biggest bank HSBC for work experience next month, a spokesperson said today. 

 In early November, Prince William will be starting some work experience in the City. He is going to be there for about three weeks, and the majority of his time will be in HSBC in the charity section, the spokesperson for the prince said. 

 She said his decision to work in HSBC was his own personal choice and she did not know if he would be paid.

 William, 23, who is planning to train at Sandhurst next year, has recently been undertaking land management work experience. He had been rumoured to be joining a leading bank, and HSBC, the worlds second biggest bank by market value and headquartered in Londons Canary Wharf area, had been the frontrunner.

 David Buik at financial bookmaker Cantor Index said odds on his joining HSBC had narrowed from 5/2 to 7/4 on Friday, before betting was closed.

 Over a month they will be able to give him a terrific insight into whats going on... he wont be licking the stamps; thats for sure, Buik said. Hell get the broadest possible education in terms of retail banking, international banking and the world economy.

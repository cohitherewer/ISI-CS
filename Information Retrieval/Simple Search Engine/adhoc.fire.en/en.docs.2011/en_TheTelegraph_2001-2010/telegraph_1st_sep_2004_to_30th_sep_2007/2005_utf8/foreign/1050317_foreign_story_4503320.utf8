 Fine Print

 Deadly doll

 Berlin, March 16 (Reuters): A blow-up sex doll sparked a bomb alert in a German post office after it started to vibrate inside a package awaiting delivery, police said today.

 ?Workers were unsettled when it began vibrating and made strange noises,? a spokesman for police in the eastern city of Chemnitz said. ?They were worried the package might be a bomb.?

 Officers brought the sender to the scene and discovered the source of alarm was an electrical device inside a life-size female sex doll. The man told police he had wanted to return the doll because it kept turning itself on at the wrong moment.

 Caesars all

 Berlin (Reuters): Sharing a name with 

 the most famous leader of ancient Rome is not always easy 

 when you?re a modern politician ? especially on the Ides 

 of March, when the first Julius Caesar was assassinated. 

 ?Let?s put it this way, I?m always particularly alert on 

 March 15 and have always come through it fine so far,? said 

 Cajus Julius Caesar, a parliamentarian with Germany?s Opposition 

 Christian Democrats (CDU). ?It?s not a real worry.? Allowing 

 for the alternative spelling of his forename, his name exactly 

 matches that of his Roman predecessor Gaius Julius Caesar, 

 who was stabbed to death by senators in Rome in 44 BC, on 

 March 15 ? the Ides of March. Caesar, 54, said on Tuesday 

 that while his name has made it easy for him to stand out 

 in politics, it does have its drawbacks ? especially when 

 people refuse to believe it?s genuine.

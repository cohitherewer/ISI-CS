 Tragedy halts tsunami of words in its tracks

 Los Angeles, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Before, musicians produced a?sonic tsunami,? Wall Street analysts foresaw ?tsunamis? of bad earnings news and Japanese restaurants served ?tsunami? sushi rolls.

 The word was used in dozens of different contexts, but now it likely will appear with just one, tragic, meaning, a language group said yesterday.

 Because of the South Asian tsunami disaster that has killed more than 150,000 people, the word assumes a solely solemn use, much the way ?Ground Zero,? for the site of the World Trade Center, had its meaning changed from ?starting point? to the centre of the September 11 tragedy, said Paul Payack, head of Global Language Monitor.

 Payack said that since the December 26 tsunami, the Japanese word has appeared more than 18.5 million times and been the subject of 88,000 articles in major media.

 ?Before September 11, 2001, the term ground zero was a business cliche meaning starting point, especially when beginning a project over again as in ?going back to ground zero?. That term now represents what many consider to be hallowed ground and its old usage is rarely employed,? he said.

 ?In the same manner, we envision that the word tsunami will be the subject of considerable discretion before being used in anything other than a most serious manner,? he said.

 He said thousands of sports teams around the world use tsunami into their names, like the Tsunami Aquatics Swim team of Livermore, California. He said there are also some 10,000 products called tsunami, like Tsunami Point-to-Point Wireless Bridges, Tsunami Multimedia Speakers and Tsunami Image Processors.

 Newspaper headline writers also liked the colourful word, as the Detroit News? ?Ford Releases a Tsunami of New Products? and ?Heading for the presidency on a tsunami of visions? in London?s The Times.

 Foreign troops

 Indonesia?s foreign minister said today he welcomed the presence of foreign troops in the country to help with tsunami relief efforts but criticised a local official who suggested those forces might stay for years.

 ?I think that perhaps words expressed at the local level were not too appropriate,? said foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda, speaking at a press conference in Berlin with his German counterpart Joschka Fischer. He added: ?You can rest assured that we welcome even... foreign troops. Their presence is based on our request.? Earlier, the deputy governor of Aceh province on Sumatra island?s northern tip, said he felt foreign troops should stay as long as they were needed, even if that meant years.

 His comments have been contradicted by the Indonesian government, which has said all foreign troops should leave the country by the end of March. Australia, the US, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, China, Spain, Pakistan and Japan all have forces in Aceh

 Queen goes green over new project

 London, July 25: The Queen is to go green after full planning permission was granted to run part of Windsor Castle on hydro-electric power.

 The innovative ?1 million four turbine energy-efficient plant will be built at Romney Weir on the Thames river. It will generate 200 kilowatts which will be used to power about a third of Windsor, the largest occupied castle in the world.

 Were constantly looking at ways of saving energy, said a spokesman for the Queen. We use energy efficient lightbulbs at Buckingham Palace and recycle 99 per cent of green waste. The Royal family has long since embraced the environmentally friendly way of life.

 The Duke of Edinburghs taxi cab which he drives around London runs on liquid petroleum gas, while water in a bore hole at Buckingham Palace is used to supply air conditioning to the Queens Gallery before topping up water levels in the palace lake.

 The electricity from the new plant ? the biggest of its kind in the south of England ? will be fed straight into Windsor Castle and not into the local grid.

 Tony Juniper, director of pressure group Friends of the Earth, said: Were delighted that the Queen is taking a lead in the use of green electricity to help tackle global warming.

 It highlights the massive potential for small scale micro-generation systems within the UK. In 2000, Prince Charles was named as the most inspirational figure worldwide for his work in promoting green issues.

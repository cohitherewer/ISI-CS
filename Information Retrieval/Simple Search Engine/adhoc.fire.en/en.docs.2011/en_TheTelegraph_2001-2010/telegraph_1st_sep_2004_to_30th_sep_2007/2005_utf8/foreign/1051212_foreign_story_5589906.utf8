 WTO street war begins

 Hong Kong, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Several thousand anti-globalisation protesters marched through Hong Kong today shouting down with WTO! and waving colourful banners ahead of this weeks World Trade Organisation meeting.

 The protest was the first of a flurry of demonstrations planned over the next few days against the trade body of nearly 150 rich and poor countries, whose ministers are meeting in Hong Kong from December 13 to 18 to try to lower trade barriers and lift millions out of poverty.

 Organisers said about 4,000 protesters marched today, waving signs reading: Junk the WTO and Rice is life. Life is not for sale in a carnival atmosphere in the shade of skyscrapers in one of the worlds main financial centres.

 Police estimated the crowd at about 3,200.

 Hong Kong is bracing for potential violence as about 10,000 anti-globalisation activists converge on the southern Chinese city for the trade meeting. About 9,000 police have been mobilised in its biggest ever security operation.

 This has been a successful protest and a very peaceful one. The biggest source of violence is from the WTO, said Elizabeth Tang, head of the Hong Kong Peoples Alliance on WTO, which was coordinating the demonstrations.

 Supporters of the talks say a trade deal could generate billions of dollars in benefits and possibly lift millions out of poverty, but many opponents say it would largely benefit richer nations at the expense of developing countries.

 Protesters will be dogging the meetings every move, and will include an estimated 1,500 South Korean workers, students and farmers, who are among the most militant activists in Asia.

 We feel very frustrated with multinational enterprises, said Kenzo Sasaki, owner of a dairy farm north of Tokyo, who led a group of Japanese farmers wearing Samurai clothing.Our main message is for food sovereignty. Junk the WTO.

Worried about a repeat of the violence that marred 

previous trade meetings in Cancun and Seattle, police stepped up patrols today 

near the Hong Kong Convention Centre, the venue for the meeting on the citys 

famous harbour front.

 US caviar import ban to save fish

 Almaty (Kazakhstan), Sept. 30 (Reuters): The US will ban imports of beluga caviar from the Caspian Sea because of concerns that the fish may die out in the wild, an environmental campaign group said.

 The numbers of beluga, the rarest and most valuable sturgeon which produces the tastiest caviar, have fallen by an estimated 90 per cent in the past 20 years as a result of overfishing, pollution and illegal trade, experts say. The US imports 60 per cent of the worlds beluga caviar, environmental group Caviar Emptor said in a statement.

 Most caviar comes from the Caspian and is sold by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan and Russia. Last year, the four exporting countries agreed to cut their overall Caspian caviar quotas by about 20 per cent, but illegal fishing undermines such efforts.

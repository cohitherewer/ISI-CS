 Employees can sue boss for sexual favouritism

 CATHERINE ELSWORTH

 Los Angeles , July 20: A court in California has ruled that bosses create an atmosphere of sexual favouritism by sleeping with their employees and can be sued for harassment even by workers with whom they are not involved.

 The ruling, which is a significant expansion of the states sexual harassment law, means that members of staff can claim harassment even if they were never approached for sexual favours nor were the subject of inappropriate advances.

 Merely conveying the message that the way to get ahead at work is to sleep with the boss is enough to constitute harassment. The California supreme courts unanimous decision related to a suit filed by two female prison workers.

 They accused a warden of giving preferential treatment to at least three of their colleagues with whom he was having affairs. When they complained about the favouritism he retaliated, they claimed.

 Phil Horowitz, of the states employment lawyers association, which supported the womens lawsuit, said: It is the first major decision saying women can sue if they are treated worse because theyre not the paramour of the supervisor. Employment law experts said the ruling conflicted with decisions in other states. 

 Previously, only workers who had an affair or received unwanted sexual attention could sue in California. Lower courts had dismissed the prison employees suit, saying that although the warden might have acted unfairly the women were not discriminated against. 

 But the states high court overturned the decision and said that widespread sexual favouritism in the workplace could be seen as sexual harassment even when the plaintiffs had not been harassed. 

 Chief justice Ronald George said: The message is conveyed to female employees that they are viewed by management as sexual playthings or that the way for women to get ahead in the workplace is by engaging in sexual conduct with their supervisors or the management.

 A spokesman for the states attorney generals office said the decision, which could also lead to suits from male employees who feel they are victims of sexual favouritism, sounded a warning to business owners. 

 The court ruled that mere office gossip was not enough to justify a lawsuit. There must be evidence of widespread sexual favouritism.

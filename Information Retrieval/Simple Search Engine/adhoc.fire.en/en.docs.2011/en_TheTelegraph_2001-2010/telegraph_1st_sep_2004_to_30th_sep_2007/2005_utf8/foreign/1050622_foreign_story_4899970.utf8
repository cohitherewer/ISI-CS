 Fine Print

 Capital offence

 Washington, June 21 (Reuters): No one in the US capital is immune to car theft, not even the citys highest ranking law enforcement official.

 Washington police chief Charles Ramseys unmarked black Ford Crown Victoria disappeared from a street near his home some time between Friday and early Sunday while he was out of town, a police spokesman said yesterday.

 When he went out to use it to go to church, he found it was missing and reported it stolen, police spokesman Quintin Peterson said.

 A riot helmet and some clothing were left in the car, but nothing that would be cause for alarm, he said. 

 French ire

 New York (Reuters): Three former waiters 

 at New Yorks posh 21 Club, where a hamburger costs 

 $30, have filed a $5 million discrimination lawsuit saying 

 they were fired for being French. In a civil suit made public 

 on Monday at a Manhattan court, the three men, Rene Bordet, 

 68, Jean Claude Lesbre, 63 and Yves Thepault, 68, said the 

 restaurants management falsely accused them of drinking 

 wine on the job and created and fostered an environment 

 rife with anti-French sentiment. Both Bordet and Lesbre 

 worked for 10 years as waiters and floor captains before 

 being fired in 2004.

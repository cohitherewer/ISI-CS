 Fresh fuel for Quran row

 Washington, May 19 (Reuters): The International Committee of the Red Cross told the Pentagon as early as 2002 detainees at Guantanamo Bay prison had reported US personnel mishandled the Quran, Red Cross and US officials said yesterday.

 The acknowledgment of the documentation of alleged abuse of the Quran came as Washington sought to defuse anger in the Muslim world after Newsweek reported the Muslim holy book was flushed down the toilet at the Guantanamo prison. The magazine retracted the article on Monday after it sparked deadly riots.

 The International Committee of the Red Cross told the Pentagon multiple times in 2002 and early 2003 prisoners at the base in Cuba alleged US officials showed disrespect for the Muslim holy book, said Simon Schorno, an ICRC spokesman. 

 The US government took corrective measures and those allegations have not resurfaced, Schorno said.

 The ICRC spokesman declined to specify if the complaints included the flushing of the Quran down the toilet or if US officials used the disrespect as part of interrogations. Members of the humanitarian organisation, which is given access to the prison, did not witness any mishandling of the Quran.

 Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the ICRC has come to the Pentagon on rare occasion with allegations made by detainees at Guantanamo.

 They are consistent with the type of things that we have talked about, what we have found in log entries (at Guantanamo), to include things like a Quran inadvertently falling to the floor, Whitman said.

 Former Guantanamo prisoners and lawyers for detainees have for months accused US personnel at Guantanamo of putting the Quran into toilets. Pentagon officials said this week they did not consider such statements as credible allegations meriting investigation.

 Human Rights Watch said the dispute over Newsweeks report overshadowed the fact that religious humiliation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay has been widespread. Around the world, the US has been humiliating Muslim detainees by offending their religious beliefs, Reed Brody of the New York-based group said.

 The group cited a former army translator, who accused Guantanamo guards of routinely tossing the Quran on the ground. Muslims consider the Quran the literal word of God and treat each book with reverence.

 In January 2003, the US military issued guidelines to personnel at the base that included the order: Ensure that the Quran is not placed in offensive areas such as the floor, near the toilet or sink, near the feet or dirty/wet areas. 

 The guidelines didnt come out of nowhere. You dont get such orders unless theres some problem,, said a US official.

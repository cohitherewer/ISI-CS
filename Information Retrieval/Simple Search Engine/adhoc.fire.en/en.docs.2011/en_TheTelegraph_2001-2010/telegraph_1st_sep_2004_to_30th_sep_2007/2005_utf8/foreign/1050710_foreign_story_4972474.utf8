 Birmingham security alert

 London, July 9 (Reuters): Police said today they were evacuating thousands of people from the centre of Birmingham, Britains second city, after receiving intelligence of a threat.

 The security alert came two days after bombings by suspected Islamist militants that killed more than 50 people in London. West Midlands police... are now closing down the Broad Street entertainment zone and asking people to leave Birmingham town centre and go home, a police spokesman said.

 He estimated up to 30,000 people could be in the area being cleared. No arrests had been made, the spokesman said.

 What were talking about is warning the public and making sure people are safe.

 London has seen repeated security alerts since Thursdays attacks on underground trains and a bus, and police have warned the bombers may still be at large and could strike again.

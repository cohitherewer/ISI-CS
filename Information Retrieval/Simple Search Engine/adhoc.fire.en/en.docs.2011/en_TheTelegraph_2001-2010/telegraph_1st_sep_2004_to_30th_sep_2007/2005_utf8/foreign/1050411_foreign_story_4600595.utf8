 Maoists free 28 in jail raid

 Kathmandu, April 10 (Reuters): Maoists stormed a jail in central Nepal, killed two policemen and set free 28 inmates, including guerrillas, late yesterday, police said.

 The rebels also bombed half-a-dozen government offices during the raid in Charikot in Dolakha district, 150 km northeast of Kathmandu, a police officer said.

 ?They broke open the gate of the jail after killing the policemen and escaped with 28 inmates,? he said today. 

 It was not clear if the rebels also suffered casualties during the midnight raid.

 The raid comes two days after troops killed 97 guerrillas and lost three soldiers while repulsing an attack on an army base in western Nepal in the deadliest clash in the country for five months.

 Violence has escalated since the Maoists called an 11-day general strike to protest against King Gyanendra?s February 1 move to dismiss the multi-party government and assume full powers.

 The strike, due to end on Tuesday, has disrupted supplies and travel across the landlocked and impoverished kingdom, wedged between giant Asian neighbours India and China. More than 300 people have died in a surge of violence since the king seized power.

 Gyanendra, who also jailed politicians and suspended civil liberties under a state of emergency, has justified his decision saying it was required to crush the revolt in which more than 11,000 people have died since 1996.

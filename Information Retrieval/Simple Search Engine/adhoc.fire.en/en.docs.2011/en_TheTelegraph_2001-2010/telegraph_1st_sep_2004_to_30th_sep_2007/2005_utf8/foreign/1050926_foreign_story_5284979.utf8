 Big Macs gender bender

 ADAM SHERWIN

 London, Sept. 25: Is it Ronald McDonald or Rhona? The gaudy clown who symbolises fast food has been replaced by a sleek, bikini-clad woman in Japanese advertisements in the latest attempt by the worlds biggest restaurant chain to improve its image. 

 Instead of baggy trousers and outsize shoes, there are leggings and high heels. All that is left of the traditional Ronald (in picture), who made his debut 42 years ago, are the muted stripes and red and yellow livery in which the new model is draped. 

 Disturbingly for the all-American Ronald, websites are speculating as to whether the lady in question is actually a cross-dressing metrosexual male. Beacon Communications, the Japanese agency behind the McMakeover, said that the red, white and yellow colours were so distinctive that it was these that now defined the brand rather than Ronald himself. 

 Faced with growing concerns over obesity and the negative portrayal of its products in the film SuperSize Me, McDonalds has questioned whether even its famous Golden Arches have become a liability. Strategists at the Illinois-based company, which celebrated its 50th birthday this year, blamed the laughing clown.

 The Japanese campaign has been credited with returning customers to McDonalds outlets and won praise from designers and fashion experts. But the gender switch is deemed too radical a change for a global audience and Ronald, albeit slimmer, is not being retired.

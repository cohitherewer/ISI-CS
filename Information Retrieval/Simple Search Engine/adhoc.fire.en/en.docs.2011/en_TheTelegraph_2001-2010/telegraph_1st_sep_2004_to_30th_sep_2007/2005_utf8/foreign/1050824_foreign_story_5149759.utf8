 China gap grows

 Beijing, Aug. 23: China risks social meltdown within five years because of the stresses provoked by its economic boom, government officials were warned yesterday.

 The country was now in a yellow-light zone, the second most serious indicator of social instability, according to an official report focusing on the growing gap between rich and poor. We are going to hit the red-light scenario after 2010 if there are no effective solutions in the next few years, said the report, commissioned by the labour and social security ministry.

 As if to bear out its warnings, police admitted that rioting had broken out in a town in the eastern province of Zhejiang, the latest in a wave of violent protests in the region. Buildings were set alight in clashes led by parents who accused a battery factory of giving their children lead poisoning. 

 Such unrest is now common in many Chinese towns, often triggered by protests against the mixture of corruption and environmental degradation that the dash for development has brought.

 The increased publicity given to them is a sign of growing government anxiety. The national leadership, under President Hu Jintao, which came to power two years ago made the plight of the poor its rallying cry.

 But it has proved unable to prevent the exploitation of Chinas manufacturing boom by local officials eager to bolster both their standing and their bank balances. Han Dong-fang, a Chinese labour rights activist in Hong Kong, said Beijings prophecies of doom appeared to be exacerbating local corruption. 

 For the moment, the officials have positions and economic power, he said. They feel they have to hurry up, because otherwise they will lose their last chance to grab what they can. 

 Ever since market-oriented economic reforms were launched more than 25 years ago, the old Maoist notions of equality have disappeared. Ironically, standard measures of wealth disparity now rank communist China as far more unequal than its old adversary, capitalist Taiwan.

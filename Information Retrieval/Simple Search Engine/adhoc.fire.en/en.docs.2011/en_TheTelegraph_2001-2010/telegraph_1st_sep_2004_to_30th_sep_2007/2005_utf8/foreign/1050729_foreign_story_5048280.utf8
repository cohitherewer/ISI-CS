 Crowe in Good Year wine quest

 Russell Crowe

 Los Angeles, July 28: (Reuters): Russell Crowe is going from the boxing ring to the vineyards of France.

 The actor is in discussions to reunite with his Gladiator director Ridley Scott in A Good Year, a project based on the breezy 2004 novel by Peter Mayle.

 The story revolves around a London banker who moves to Provence after inheriting a vineyard. But when he arrives, he meets a California woman who claims that she owns the place. The Fox film has a tentative September start date in Paris. Crowe was last in theatres with the boxing drama Cinderella Man, which bombed at the box office, not helped by his concurrent arrest for allegedly throwing a telephone at a hotel clerk.

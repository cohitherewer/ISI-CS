 Chandrika moved to tears

 Colombo, Aug. 13 (Reuters): President Chandrika Kumaratunga broke down as doctors battled to save her foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar after he was shot, an official said today as Sri Lanka woke up to its latest political killing.

 Television anchors wore white, the traditional colour of mourning, and shocked Sri Lankans queued up to buy newspapers reporting the ministers assassination. Kadirgamar, an Oxford-educated lawyer, never contested an election and never addressed a rally in a decade-long political career. 

 It was such a shock, I am still recovering. He was undoubtedly Sri Lankas best statesman ever, said Shanthini Anthony, a 32-year old university lecturer, who like Kadirgamar is from Sri Lankas minority Tamil community. Kadirgamar was instrumental in getting the Tigers outlawed as a terrorist organisation by the US and Britain and was long seen as a prime target. A team of over 100 elite commandos and soldiers stood guard around him everywhere he went. It was not immediately clear how his killer found a window.

 I was absolutely shocked. There was this business of him being a target, but I never expected this to happen, lamented Dr D.A.A. Perera as he read the morning newspaper. 

 Kumaratunga cried as surgeons at Colombos National Hospital tried to save Kadirgamars life, a junior minister said on condition of anonymity. Kadir, as he was known to the media and his friends, was a top adviser to Kumaratunga in a protracted effort to bring about a permanent peace with the Tigers, whose two-decade war for a separate state is in limbo thanks to the ceasefire. 

 Hardliners from his own Tamil community called him a traitor. His acts were considered to be treacherous towards the Tamils from the very beginning, said M.K. Sivajilingam, a MP for the Tiger-backed Tamil National Alliance.

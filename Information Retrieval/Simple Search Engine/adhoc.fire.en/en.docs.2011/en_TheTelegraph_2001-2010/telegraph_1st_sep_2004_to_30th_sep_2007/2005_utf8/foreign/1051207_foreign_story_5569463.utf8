 Rice in rare admission of US frailty

 Berlin, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, in a rare concession to US critics, acknowledged today that Washington may make mistakes in its battle against terrorism and promised to put them right if they happened.

 But she restated her defence of the legality of US tactics against a militant enemy which operates from within our society and is intent... on killing innocent civilians.

 Any policy will sometimes result in errors, and when it happens, we will do everything we can to rectify it, Rice said at the start of a European tour overshadowed by allegations of illegal CIA methods against terrorist suspects.

 Speaking in Berlin, she declined to comment on the case of a German man, Khaled el-Masri, who was allegedly abducted to Afghanistan and imprisoned there for five months last year until the CIA realised it had got the wrong man.

 But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the US government had acknowledged it blundered over Masri, who plans to sue the CIA in a case to be filed in the US.

 Masris case has caused a furore in Germany, fuelled by a US newspaper report that the then interior minister was told of the case in May 2004 and agreed to a request from the US ambassador to keep it quiet. Rice was not challenged directly over reports the US had run secret prisons to hold terrorism suspects in eastern Europe, which Washington has refused to confirm or deny.

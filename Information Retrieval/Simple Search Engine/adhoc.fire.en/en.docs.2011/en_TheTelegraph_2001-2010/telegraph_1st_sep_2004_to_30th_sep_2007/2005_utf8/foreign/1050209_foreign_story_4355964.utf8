 Boring Cherie forgets which nation she?s in

 STEPHEN D?ANTAL AND PAUL CHAPMAN

 Auckland/Wellington, Feb. 8: Cherie Blair opened her controversial Australasian speaking tour last night with a spectacular gaffe, forgetting which country she was in.

 Diners at the charity event in New Zealand listened in shock as she confused them with their arch-rivals in Australia. The British Prime Minister?s wife, despite charging a reported ?125,000 for her six-date tour of the two countries, then made the same mistake again.

 ?Calling us Australians was the worst faux pas you can imagine ? and she did it twice,? said a businessman after the speech. ?I don?t think she benefited herself with her presentation. And it was boring. I give her a two out of 10.?

 British newspaper journalists were removed from the Auckland Convention Centre shortly before the half-hour speech began. They were among more than 800 people who had paid between ?90 and ?380 a head to hear Cherie Blair speak at the dinner.

 Despite the presence of several local journalists, the organiser of the event, the Sydney-based PR guru Max Markson, personally stepped in to escort all British press from the building.

 ?There are no media allowed in,? he said. ?There?s nothing I can do. I am following instructions.? Behind closed doors, Cherie Blair was having her picture taken with VIP guests who had paid top prices to meet her at a pre-dinner cocktail party.

 But later, after a dinner of prawns, rack of lamb and pistachio cheesecake, she struggled to live up to her superstar billing, according to members of the audience.

 ?I thought Cherie was very poor,? said Caroline Canning, 34, an insurance executive. ?She flogged her book, and for a woman of her credentials she could have had a lot more weight and talked about her work with human rights. Instead it was all about who painted which walls in Downing Street ? peripheral crap. 

 ?And for all the research she had done into the history of Downing Street, she hadn?t found out which country she was in.? Sharlene McDonald, 45, also an insurance executive, said: ?I?d give her three out of 10. We were expecting nine out of 10. There was only a fleeting reference to raising funds for charity.?

 A local celebrity chef, Peta Mathias, said: ?I was expecting something more intellectual. I had no idea she would be talking about the book. ?

 Cherie, wearing a bright turquoise silk coat and dress, entered the conference hall alongside the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, to a standing ovation the and the strains of a song called You Are Amazing.

 Galaxies found, rethink on universe age

 Paris, March 3 (AFP): The discovery of a rich cluster of hundreds ? possibly thousands ? of galaxies in deep space suggests the universe evolved into its present form far sooner than was once thought, space agencies have announced.

 The sphere-like cluster of galaxies is ?the most distant massive structure yet detected in the universe,? the European Space Agency (ESA) and Nasa declared.

 The huge cluster is located some nine billion light years away, in the constellation pisces australis (the southern fish), about half-a-billion light years farther out than the previous record holder for a formed galaxy, they said in separate press releases.

 The universe is calculated to be about 13.7 billion years old, born from a ?Big Bang,? the explosion which spewed out the hot matter that later formed the galaxies and everything in them.

 As the light from the newly-discovered cluster has taken nine billion years to reach us, its galaxies were already formed when the universe was a mere youth of five billion years old.

 ?We are quite surprised to see that exquisite structures like this could exist at such early epochs,? said US astronomer Christopher Mullis of the University of Michigan.

 ?We see an entire network of stars and galaxies in place at just a few billion years after the big bang, like a kingdom popping up fast.?

 Until now, the earliest evidence for the timetable of galactic development has come from ?proto-clusters? ? galactic clusters in the making ? that have been dated by analysis of their light to be up to 10 billion years old.

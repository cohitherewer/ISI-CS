 Tuneful violin sale

 New York, April 23 (Reuters): A violin made more than three centuries ago by Antonio Stradivari fetched a record $2 million in an auction, the highest price for any musical instrument, Christie?s said yesterday.

 The sale surpassed the previous mark of $1.8 million for a Stradivari violin sold in 1990, according to the auction house. ?The Lady Tennant? violin, made in 1699, the year before Stradivari?s golden period style, had a presale estimate of $800,000 to $1.2 million. Violins made by Stradivari and other prized Italian makers like Amati and Guarneri are highly sought after by concert artists and collectors for their high-quality sound.

 Fiddle fun

 Los Angeles (Reuters): A young musician said on Friday she can fiddle with joy again, after a $500,000 Italian-made violin stolen from her car outside a supermarket was recovered three days later without a scratch. Lindsay Deutsch, 20, said the 260-year-old instrument was found in an alley on April 20 by a man walking his dog near the parking lot where the theft had occurred.

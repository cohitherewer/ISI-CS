 Julia buys land from Rumsfeld

 New York, Jan. 8 (AP): With newly-born twins, it looks like Julia Roberts needs some extra space.

 The actor has bought 32 acres of Taos, New Mexico, real estate from US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld, People magazine reported.

 According to the magazine, since taking up part-time residence in New Mexico in 1995, Roberts has bought other pieces of property adjacent to hers. The plot purchased from Rumsfeld is in an area of Taos known as Des Montes and is near the 80 acres Roberts already owns.

 Messages left at with Julia Roberts? publicist seeking confirmation were not immediately returned. Rumsfeld, though, still owns other real estate holdings in Taos, including several houses.

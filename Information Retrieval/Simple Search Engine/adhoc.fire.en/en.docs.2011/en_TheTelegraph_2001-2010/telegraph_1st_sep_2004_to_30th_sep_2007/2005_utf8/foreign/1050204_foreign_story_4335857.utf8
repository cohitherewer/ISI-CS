 Gas poisoning kills Georgia PM

 Tbilisi (Georgia), Feb. 3 (Reuters): The Prime Minister of ex-Soviet Georgia was found dead today in a bizarre gas poisoning that robs the inexperienced President, Mikhail Saakashvili, of a steadying hand to help run his turbulent country.

 Zurab Zhvania?s bodyguards found the 41-year-old slumped in an armchair near a gas heater at a friend?s apartment, said interior minister Vano Merabishvili. ?This is a tragic accident... It was a gas poisoning,? he said.

 Saakashvili called ministers to an emergency meeting to discuss the death of one of the few political heavyweights in a leadership catapulted to power by a popular uprising a year ago.

 Vice-premier Georgy Baramidze, a close ally of Zhvania?s, was likely to chair cabinet meetings until a new Prime Minister is named. But he is not thought to be in the frame for the job and there is no obvious successor.

 ?(Zhvania?s death) is a huge blow for our country and personally for me as a president and as a person,? a red-eyed Saakashvili told his ministers, many of them dressed in black, his own voice breaking with emotion.

 ?I have lost my closest friend, my most loyal adviser, my biggest ally.?

 Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose relations with Georgia?s leadership have often been fraught, sent his condolences, the Kremlin press service said.

 Zhvanias body was found at 0130 GMT when his guards, worried that he was not answering his mobile phone, broke down the door of the friend?s apartment, said Merabishvili.

 The friend, a middle-ranking official, also died.

 A police forensic expert said an initial examination of Zhvania?s body revealed no evidence of foul play. Gas poisoning is common in Georgia, mainly caused by the heaters run off gas canisters that people use in winter, when power supplies are erratic.

 The Prime Minister was one of a trio of leaders who spearheaded the ?Rose Revolution? in late 2003 that toppled veteran leader Eduard Shevardnadze and set Georgia on a pro-western reform path.

 The state of about 5 million lies in the Caucasus mountains, on the transit route for oil and gas exports from the Caspian Sea to the West, and is racked by simmering conflicts over the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

 Zhvania was widely seen as a moderating influence on Saakashvili, a 37-year-old US-trained lawyer who is prone to emotional outbursts and provoking confrontation. There were widespread reports of rivalry between the two men but they never aired this in public.

 On occasions when Saakashvili?s relations with Moscow or separatist regimes broke down, Zhvania was able to act as a go-between. He was also an able back-room organiser in a cabinet with little experience of the machinery of government.

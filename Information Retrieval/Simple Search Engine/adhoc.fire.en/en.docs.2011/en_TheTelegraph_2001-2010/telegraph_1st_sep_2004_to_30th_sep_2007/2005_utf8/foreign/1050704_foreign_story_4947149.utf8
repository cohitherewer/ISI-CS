 Havana, July 3 (AP): Revolutionary fighter Ernesto Che Guevaras daughter has written a short biography about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez based on an interview in which they discussed his childhood, family and relationship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

 It is always thrilling to know a bit more about a human being who has decided to transform society, especially when that transformation is meant to improve the lives of his people, Aleida Guevara wrote on the books back cover.

 The book, published by Ocean Press and titled Chavez: Venezuela and the new Latin America, was released in Havana.

 The books title in Spanish is Chavez, un Hombre Que Anda Por Ahi.

 Guevara met Chavez two times in February 2004 in Caracas, Venezuela for the interview. 

 In the 145-page book, the President talks about his childhood in the southwest region of Barinas, where he was born in 1954, and his close relationship with his grandmother Rosa Ines, who raised him.

 The Venezuelan leader also speaks openly about his children, his political life and his friendship with Castro.

 Indonesia looks for crash cause

 Medan (Indonesia), Sept. 6 (Reuters): Indonesia will hold a mass burial tomorrow for scores of unidentified plane crash victims as experts sought to determine what caused the Boeing 737 to slam into a crowded residential area of Medan, killing 149.

 Yesterdays disaster in Indonesias third-largest city killed 102 of the 117 aboard the Mandala Airlines domestic flight and another 47 people on the ground.

 There was still no word on the cause of the accident in this Sumatra island city, where the morgue at Adam Malik hospital was filled to overflowing, forcing authorities to set up a tent outside to keep rain off rows of corpses.

 Religious custom in predominantly Muslim Indonesia calls for quick burials of the dead. With many bodies burned beyond recognition, officials planned to give them a mass burial tomorrow afternoon.

 There are still 57 unidentified bodies. We have already prepared 57 coffins to be buried in one big hole, said Edi Sofyan, a North Sumatra provincial government spokesperson. 

 Police watching over the wreckage of the Boeing 737-200 said its black box and flight recorder had been found yesterday and sent for analysis.

 We will send it overseas for further investigation. At this stage it is too early to conclude the cause, said Setyo Rahardjo, head of the national transport safety committee.

 In recent years soaring fuel prices have hit Indonesias airlines hard, while the growth of budget carriers has brought pressure to keep fares down. 

 Officials have said technical problems and pilot error were among possible causes. The aircraft was built in 1981 and was fit for eight more years of flying, according to the airline.

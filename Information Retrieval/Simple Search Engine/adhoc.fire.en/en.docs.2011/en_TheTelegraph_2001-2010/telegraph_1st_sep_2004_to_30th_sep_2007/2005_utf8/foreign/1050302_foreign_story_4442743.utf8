 Asylum levels fall sharply in rich nations

 Geneva, March 1 (Reuters): The number of people seeking asylum in richer countries dropped sharply for the third year in a row in 2004, hitting the lowest levels in 16 years, the UN refugee agency UNHCR reported today.

 Overall numbers fell by an average of 22 per cent across 38 developed countries, including 19 per cent in the 25-nation EU, 26 per cent in North America, and 28 per cent in Australia and New Zealand, compared with 2003, the agency said.

 In European countries, where asylum has become a big political issue, requests were down by 33 per cent in Britain, by 30 per cent in Germany, and a quarter in Sweden.

 In Britain, where immigration is becoming a focus of debate ahead of parliamentary elections expected in May, numbers applying for asylum were back to levels of the mid-1990s, having fallen 66 per cent in two years.

 Afghans asylum seekers, totalling 50,000 in 2001, were now down to 8,800.

 ?This is a clear reflection of the impact a concerted effort to improve conditions in the region of origin can have on numbers seeking asylum further afield,? said Raymond Hall, who directs the agency?s Europe Bureau. The UNHCR said numbers of Iraqi asylum seekers had fallen by 80 per cent since 2002 and totalled only 9,400 last year.

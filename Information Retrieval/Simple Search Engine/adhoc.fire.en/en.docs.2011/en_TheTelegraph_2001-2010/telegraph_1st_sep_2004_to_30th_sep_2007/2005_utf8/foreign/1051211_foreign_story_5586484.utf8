 Port Harcourt (Nigeria), Dec. 10 (Reuters): A Nigerian plane carrying 110 passengers and crew crashed and burst into flames in the oil city of Port Harcourt today killing 103 people, a Nigerian aviation official said.

 A mother awaiting news of her child at the Port Harcourt airport said the plane was carrying 75 secondary school students from a Jesuit college in the capital Abuja.

 I called the school and they confirmed there were 75 students on board, said the mother. The plane, travelling from Abuja to Port Harcourt, was operated by private Nigerian carrier Sosoliso. The plane was carrying 103 passengers and seven crew when it missed the runway on landing and burst into flames.

 Caught by call

 Zagreb, Oct. 25 (Reuters): A phone call to his mother led to the downfall of a suspected German robber, who was arrested in Croatia after eluding police for nearly two weeks.

 Croatian police said the security guard made off with 7.2 million euros ($8.6 million) he was supposed to deliver to a German bank and fled to the Adriatic coast.

 After managing to evade a police and Interpol manhunt for 10 days while hiding out in the coastal Croatian city of Zadar, the suspect was nabbed after making a phone call to his mother, the daily Jutarnji List reported on Tuesday.

 Most of the money was still in his car as he only bought some clothes and shoes, police told the newspaper. 

 Tan amp; ski

 Dubai (Reuters): Tourists tanning in the United Arab Emirates will also be able to ski and snowboard as if in the Alps when a huge indoor ski resort opens in December. The park, sprawling over 3,000 square metres of desert land in Dubai, will include ski-lifts to take guests to five slopes of varying height and steepness.

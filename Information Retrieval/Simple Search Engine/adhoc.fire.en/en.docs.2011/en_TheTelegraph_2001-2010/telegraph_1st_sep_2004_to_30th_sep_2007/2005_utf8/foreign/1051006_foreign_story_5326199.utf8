 Katrina cash fraud

 San Francisco, Oct. 5 (AP{): The FBI has charged nine people with wire fraud in a scheme aimed at milking Red Cross funds allocated for hurricane Katrina victims, the agency said.

 Four of the suspects were contract workers at a Red Cross national call centre in Bakersfield, California, US attorney McGregor W Scott said yesterday. The other five allegedly picked up checks they werent entitled to.

 Eight Bakersfield residents were arrested in recent days on suspicion of wire fraud. One woman, Elizabeth Ray, was still at large and wanted on the same charge.

 The suspects were scheduled to appear today in federal court in Fresno, California. If convicted, each defendant could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

 Scott, the lead federal prosecutor for eastern California, said losses totaled $25,000, but that number was expected to rise as the investigation continued.

 The Red Cross said it set up the national call centre in Bakersfield for hurricane Katrina victims seeking assistance. Operators provide qualifying victims with a personal identification number they then present to receive funds from Western Union.

 The bad guys would call their buddies and give them pin numbers, Scott said. Sometimes theyd just call with unused pin numbers. Sometimes theyd give a victim a pin number and turn around and call a buddy with the same pin, and thered be a race to Western Union. The Red Cross contacted the FBI after it performed an audit of the call centre.

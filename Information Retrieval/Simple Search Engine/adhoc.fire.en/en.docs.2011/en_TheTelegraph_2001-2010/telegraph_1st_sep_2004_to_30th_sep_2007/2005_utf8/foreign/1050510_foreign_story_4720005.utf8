 Clean roots

 London, May 9 (AFP): Drivers born under the signs of Libra, Cancer, Pisces, Taurus, Capricorn are least likely to keep their cars clean, according to a survey that explores the astrological roots of motoring cleanliness.

 Those born under Aquarius, Aries, Scorpio, Leo wash their cars weekly, Sagittarius and Gemini every two weeks and Virgo every month.

 The others simply head to the car wash, or bring out the bucket and hose, when their vehicle is ?too dirty to drive,? says the survey of more han 1,000 people by Comma, a supplier of car care products in southeast England.

 When asked which chore they would chose over the traditional sunday morning car wash, 36 per cent said theyd prefer to mow the lawn.

 Leos, Pisceans and Taureans would all opt to slave over a hot stove, and Librans and Scorpians to wash the dishes. One in three Aquarians would rather sort out the garbage.

 ?It seems the water signs arent quite living up to their reputations and its the fire signs of Leo, Aries and Sagittarius who are more likely to be found with a bucket and chamois,? said Mike Bewsey of Comma.

 Bug bite

 Bangkok (AFP): Thai authorities are urging villagers to embrace a novel eye-for-an-eye approach to ending an insect pestilence ravishing their farmland: eat the pesky critters, a report said on Monday. The chief of a district in Kanchanaburi province, where the so-called rot-eating grub has destroyed more than 60 per cent of crops, said farmers needed a new tactic as insecticide had proved ineffective and some farmers had turned to using chemicals, the Bangkok Post said. Dan Makhamtei district chief Pipat Kankharirk said a healthier and more effective pest control strategy would not be too hard a pill to swallow. ?Eating them is the best way to cut the insects life cycle,? Pipat said. 

 Grope train

 Tokyo (Reuters): A stepped-up campaign 

 by Tokyo train operators to protect women from gropers by 

 increasing the number of women-only carriages is angering 

 some male commuters. Several of the Japanese capitals 

 railway companies introduced the single-sex carriages on 

 Monday as part of an effort to tackle the problem of men 

 who take advantage of overcrowding to grope female passengers.

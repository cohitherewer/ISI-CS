 US aircraft boost to Pak navy

 Islamabad, Aug. 31: Pakistan and the US have formally signed the transfer documents for eight P-3C Orion long-range maritime patrol aircraft, giving a boost to the Pakistani navy.

 The US had announced it would deliver these planes to Pakistan last November, months after granting it the status of a major non-Nato ally to the South Asian nation for its invaluable contribution in the ongoing war against terror.

 The ownership (title) of these aircraft has been shifted to the Pakistan navy with signing of the documents in the United States, a Pakistan navy spokesperson said in Islamabad today.

 He said the US navy would provide the eight planes free of cost and the expenses for modification of the avionics system would be met mostly from US military aid to Pakistan.

 President George W. Bush had unveiled a $3-billion economic and military aid package for Pakistan during President General Pervez Musharrafs visit to Washington in July 2003.

 All sanctions imposed on Pakistan after its May 1998 nuclear detonations were lifted after the package was announced.

 Pakistan will get the first two P-3Cs fitted with the state-of-the-art gadgetry including modern avionics and Harpoon missiles, by December, marking commencement of the delivery process of the planes.

 Pakistan navy pilots are expected to travel to the US in September for advanced training before the planes arrive.

 With the induction of eight P-3Cs, the existing fleet of the aircraft will increase to 10, the spokesperson added.

 The Pakistan navy already has two P-3Cs in addition to French-origin Atlantic surveillance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft, which are currently being overhauled and upgraded by American experts in Karachi. These planes are expected to be operational by end of this year, said the spokesperson.

 Pakistan had initially acquired three P-3Cs from the US in the late 1980s but one was shot down by India for allegedly violating its air space.

 In addition to acquiring P-3Cs, the Pakistan navy also plans to buy four F-22P frigates from China along with at least 4-6 Z-9 standardised helicopters. 

 Under the terms of the contract signed during the Chinese Prime Ministers visit to Pakistan last April, one of the ships will be built in China while remaining three are to be constructed in Karachi by Pakistani experts, for which Beijing will transfer technology to Islamabad.

 The Pakistan navy fleet currently comprises French-origin Agosta and American-made Dephne-class submarines, destroyers, British-origin frigates and domestically manufactured missile boats, mine-hunters, gun boats and small submarines known as midgets.

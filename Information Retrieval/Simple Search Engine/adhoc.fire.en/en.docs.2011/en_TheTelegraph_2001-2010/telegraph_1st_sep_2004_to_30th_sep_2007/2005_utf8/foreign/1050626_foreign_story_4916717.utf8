 Nicoles nose Bewitched

 Los Angeles, June 23 (Reuters): Hollywoods latest film remake of a TV show debuts this week with Bewitched, but the twist in this tale is that director Nora Ephron has chosen to spoof moviemakers obsession with remakes and image.

 Ephrons idea for the romantic comedy sprang from an image ? of Nicole Kidmans nose ? which has an uncanny resemblance to that of Elizabeth Montgomery, who played Samantha Stephens in the hit 1960s television programme.

 The nose, of course, is integral to Bewitched because Samantha twitches it to cast her magic spells.

 In interviews, Ephron said she received a telephone call from Sony Pictures boss Amy Pascal saying Kidman was meeting her in a day to discuss a Bewitched movie, but that no screenplay was written nor plot outlined. Ephron said she agreed to come up with something, hung up the phone and within five minutes had an idea for a movie.

 The kernel of it was Nicoles nose... It was just one of those ideas I had very easily, and, by the way, that was the last easy moment on the movie, she said.

 Not that the film was difficult to make, added Ephron, whose other directing credits include 1993s Sleepless in Seattle and 1998s Youve Got Mail. Bewitched was hard to write, she said, because it is an original take on a Hollywood remake that pokes fun at the systems star-making machinery.

 The TV Bewitched, which aired from 1964 to 1972, was the story of a witch, Samantha, married to an everyday guy, Darrin. The two try to live a normal American suburban life, but Samantha cannot resist using her magical powers to help solve her familys problems.

 Ephrons Bewitched, which she co-wrote with her sister Delia Ephron, takes the original concept and uses it to tell a completely different story of a TV network making a modern version of the old show. 

 The fictional producers of this new TV Bewitched cast a fading film action hero as the new Darrin. That falling star is Jack Wyatt, played in the film by comic actor Will Ferrell.

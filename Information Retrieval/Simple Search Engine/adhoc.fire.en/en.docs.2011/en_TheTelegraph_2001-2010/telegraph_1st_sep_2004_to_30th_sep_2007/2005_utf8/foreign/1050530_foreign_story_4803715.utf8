 Stripper shock

 Nashville (US), May 29 (AP): A mother faces criminal charges after she hired a stripper to dance at her 16-year-old sons birthday party.

 Anette Pharris, 34, and four others were indicted by a grand jury on charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and involving a minor in obscene acts. 

 Its a bunch of bull, Pharris told the Tennessean newspaper on Friday. I tried to do something special for my son. It didnt harm him. About 30 people were at Landon Pharriss 16th birthday party in September, about 10 of them under the age of 18. We even had grandpa there, his mother said.

I wont be truly happy until I see a sign that says Im outside of North Carolina,Allen said.

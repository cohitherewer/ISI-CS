 No desire? Measure your libido

 Jerusalem, Jan. 17 (PTI): Israeli researchers claimed to have developed a test to scientifically determine the level of a person?s libido.

 The method developed by a team led by Yoram Vardi, chief of neurological unit at Rambam hospital at Haifa and professor of urology at the Technion Israel Institute of Science, can enable medical professionals to determine the root cause of diminished sexual desire and the effectiveness of treatment.

 ?What we?ve developed is a test that objectively measures the subject?s amount of interest in sex. It rates their libido,? vardi, who wants to name it ?the libido-meter?, said.

 ?Until now we?ve only had subjective ideas on this matter, mainly what the patient would tell us. There isn?t even an evaluated standardised questionnaire on libido,? he said. 

 ?What we set out to do is to devise something objective that can measure and quantify a person?s sexual desire?.

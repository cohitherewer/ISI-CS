 Schroeder loses vote to force early polls

 Berlin, July 1 (Reuters): German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder engineered his own defeat in a parliamentary vote of confidence today in a bid to force elections he hopes will return him to power with a new mandate for reform.

 Schroeder called for the vote after his Social Democratic Party (SPD), facing criticism over record unemployment and deeply unpopular economic reforms, suffered a string of humiliating defeats in regional polls.

 However, critics who see Schroeders confidence vote as a political trick said they would ask Germanys highest court to block early elections, which opinion polls suggest the SPD would lose to the Christian Democrats, led by Angela Merkel.

 The 601-strong lower house voted 296-151 against the government, with 148 abstentions, Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse announced after a highly-charged two-hour debate, characterised by fierce partisan attacks.

 Of the abstentions, 140 were members of Schroeders SPD acting on party instructions, with the remaining eight from their coalition partners, the Greens.

 Schroeder, 61, had called on parliament in a speech watched throughout the country to open the way for new elections, saying his government needed a mandate to continue its economic reform drive. He said he lacked the necessary support in parliament and faced opposition even in his own party.

 If we are to continue with this agenda, a mandate through new elections is needed, a grim Schroeder said. We need clarity. That is why I am putting the motion of confidence. However, for the vote to take place as planned on September 18 constitutional hurdles need to be cleared.

 President Horst Koehler, the only person with the power to dissolve parliament, must first decide whether Schroeders unusual scheme to deliberately lose the confidence vote conforms with the constitution.

 Schroeder went to the Presidents office after the vote today to ask him in person to endorse his election plan. Koehler said in a statement after the brief meeting that he reserved the right to use the full 21 days allowed him to decide. He said the Schroeder plan raised complex constitutional issues.

 Koehler will be taking his decision in the knowledge that an overwhelming majority of Germans, the countrys main parties and financial markets support early elections.

 There is also a precedent. In 1982 former Chancellor Helmut Kohl deliberately lost a confidence vote to bolster his parliamentary majority ? a move upheld by the constitutional court, albeit with reservations.

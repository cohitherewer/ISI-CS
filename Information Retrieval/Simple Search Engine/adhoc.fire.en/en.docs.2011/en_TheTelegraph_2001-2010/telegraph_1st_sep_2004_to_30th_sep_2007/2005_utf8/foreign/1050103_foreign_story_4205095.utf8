 $45m sale beats Murdoch

 PATRICK ?GILFOIL HEALY 

 New York, Jan. 2: Ocean 

 views, private beaches and 14 bathrooms are fine for some 

 people, but what good is a house in the Hamptons if it doesn?t 

 come with a superlative?

 Stewart Rahr, a pharmaceutical 

 distributor, got one this week when he paid more than $45 

 million for an 18,000-square-foot waterfront estate in Wainscott, 

 East Hampton. Real estate brokers in the Hamptons and Manhattan 

 called it the most expensive home ever sold in New York 

 State.

 The sale eclipses Rupert Murdoch?s 

 purchase this month of a $44-million penthouse on Fifth 

 Avenue once owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller, who died in 

 July.

 Rahr said he had simply fallen 

 in love with the place. ?I had no intention of competing 

 in a price war or setting a record,? Rahr said in a telephone 

 interview from Florida. ?I just found that out today.?

 The estate, named Burnt Point, 

 comes with a private dock and a sailboat. It sits on 25 

 acres, has a half-mile of waterfront, and overlooks Georgica 

 Pond, a jackknife-shaped body of water whose shores are 

 home to Calvin Klein, Steven Spielberg and flocks of endangered 

 birds.

 ?I don?t covet, but I covet this 

 place,? said Dolly Lenz, the broker with Prudential Douglas 

 Elliman who sold the house. ?It definitely is a Northeast 

 record. They bought it with everything. They?re going to 

 walk in with a toothbrush.?

 Rahr is president and chief executive 

 of Kinray, a drug wholesaler, which is based in Queens and 

 distributes vitamins, medical supplies and generic and brand-name 

 drugs to pharmacies across the Northeast. 

 He bought the house from David 

 Campbell, a commodities trader who built and decorated the 

 house about five years ago. The furnishings are included 

 in the deal. And the best part?

 ?I don?t even have a mortgage 

 on that property,? Rahr said. ?I?m able to write a cheque.?

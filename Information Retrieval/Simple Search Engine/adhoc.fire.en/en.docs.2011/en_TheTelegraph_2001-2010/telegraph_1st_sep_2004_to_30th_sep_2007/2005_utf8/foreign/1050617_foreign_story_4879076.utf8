 Qadeer Khan in hospital

 Abdul Qadeer Khan

 Islamabad, June 16 (Reuters): Disgraced Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, known as the father of the countrys atomic bomb, has been taken to hospital with a heart problem, the government said today.

 Khan was placed under house arrest after admitting in early 2004 his role at the centre of a black market network selling nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and possibly North Korea. He has had some heart pressure... and he may have angioplasty surgery in the next two or three days, information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said.

 The government has refused to let foreign investigators question Khan, who is still regarded as a hero by many of his countrymen.

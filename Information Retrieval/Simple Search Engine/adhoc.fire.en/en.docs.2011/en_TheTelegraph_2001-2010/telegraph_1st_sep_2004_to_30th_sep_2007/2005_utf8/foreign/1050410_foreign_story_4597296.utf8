Windsor, April 9 (Reuters): An hour after newly 

weds Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles left the Windsor Guildhall today, 

Fraser and Grace rolled up in a bus.

 The royal wedding was delayed to avoid clashing with Pope John Paul?s funeral. So ?commoners? Fraser Moores, 34, and Grace Beesley, 33, found themselves the unexpected focus of attention as they were the next couple to be married in the public building.

 A beaming Beesley said ? still milling in throngs after covering the royal ceremony ? that it was ?fantastic? to share heir to the throne Charles and Parker Bowles?s big day.

 Charles had wanted to marry his long-time lover inside the chapel of nearby Windsor Castle. But a licensing problem meant he was instead forced to use the more humble surroundings of the Guildhall in the riverside town outside London.

 Delighting in the attention, Beesley laughed and waved to cheering crowds still gathered behind barriers set up for the royal wedding. After their marriage ceremony, the couple kissed and posed for a phalanx of photographers and onlookers, looking more relaxed than the illustrious pair before them, witnesses said.

?The royal couple have gone, they?re doing their thing and we are going to do ours,? guest Helen Kirkby said, before the group moved on to a reception in a double-decker bus.

 An Anglican cleric filed a last-minute objection today to the wedding, maintaining that Charles could not re-marry while being heir to the British throne.

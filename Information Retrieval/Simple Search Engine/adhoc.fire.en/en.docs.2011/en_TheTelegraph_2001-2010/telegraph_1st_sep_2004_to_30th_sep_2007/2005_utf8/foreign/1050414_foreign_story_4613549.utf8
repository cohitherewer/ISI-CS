 Wayne for PM

 London, April 13 (Reuters): If Wayne Rooney ever opts to hang up his soccer boots, there may be a future in politics. At least that is what a survey of British children suggests.

 The next generation of voters feel the Manchester United and England forward would be the best man for the job of Prime Minister, according to this week?s Kids General Election survey.

 Instead of Iraq, immigration and the economy, youngsters would want a Prime Minister Rooney to address bullying, school dinners and the burning issue of the recent break-up of British boy band Busted.

 More vehicles burnt in Belgium

 Brussels, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Youths set fire to 15 vehicles across Belgium in a fourth night of attacks that authorities said looked like imitations of violence in France, leading the far Right to call for the expulsion of the perpetrators.

 Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said in Singapore the burning of cars in Belgian cities were isolated incidents and said they was not comparable to the riots in France, which he described as a very serious, serious situation.

 The arson attacks late yesterday have not sparked worse violence across Belgium, which like France has big Muslim and African immigrant populations.

 Burnt-out cars are rare in Belgium, a spokesman for a government crisis centre said today. This seems to be an attempt to imitate what is happening in France.

 Ten cars were set ablaze in Brussels, with the others in Antwerp and the smaller towns of Lokeren, Mechelen and Ledeberg, the centre said in a statement. There were a number of arrests.

 Brussels firefighters were called out 25 times to deal with attempted arson attacks, including three petrol bombs.

 Belgium has a large immigrant population, many of Moroccan origin, with high unemployment among the young. But unlike France, it does not have a high concentration of immigrants in ghetto-like areas around cities.

 Disguised gunmen kill Iraq teachers

 Baghdad, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Gunmen dressed as policemen shot dead five Shia teachers and a driver in their school south of Baghdad today, and a suicide bomber killed 10 people when he rammed a bus full of oil ministry employees.

 These men were terrorists in police uniform, a spokesman for Babel police said after the teachers were killed in the town of Iskandariya.

 He said the gunmen arrived at the school in two civilian cars, led the teachers and the school driver to a part of the school where no children were present, and shot them.

 Earlier, a suicide bomber rammed his car into a bus carrying oil ministry employees as it passed a police academy in Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and wounding 30, police and witnesses said.

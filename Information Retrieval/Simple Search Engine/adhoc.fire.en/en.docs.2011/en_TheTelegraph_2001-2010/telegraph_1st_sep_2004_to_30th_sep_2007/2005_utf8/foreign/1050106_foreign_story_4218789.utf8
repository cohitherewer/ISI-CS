 Copter crews bring aid, get smiles

 Teuhom (Indonesia), Jan. 5 (Reuters): They seemed to appear from nowhere, a small group of men and boys, eager to get their hands on the precious cargo carried by a US navy helicopter.

 The Seahawk helicopter briefly touched down in the rubble of what used to be the town of Teuhom today, bringing smiles to the faces of survivors of the December 26 quake and ensuing tsunami with its delivery of bottled water and sacks of rice. After quickly and carefully stacking boxes of aid alongside the helicopter, the grateful villagers shook hands with everyone on board before it took off again to return to the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.

 This was one of just 30 sorties planned for the scores of US helicopters delivering aid throughout the devastated province of Aceh on the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where almost all Indonesia?s 94,081 deaths occurred.

 After offloading their cargo, many crews return to the provincial capital Banda Aceh with sick and injured survivors ? many severely dehydrated and weak from a lack of food. ?There was one woman we picked up who was very weak, but with her hands made the number ?six? for me,? helicopter pilot Ralph Topete said. ?It turned out she was telling me she had had six children, but lost five of them in the tsunami. It was heartbreaking.?

 Banda Aceh airport has become a hive of activity, with US, Australian and Singaporean helicopters buzzing in and out. Each day the crews become more efficient at loading aid, dropping it off at remote villages and returning for more.

 US navy Captain David Lausman, the USS Abraham Lincoln?s executive officer, said Indonesian military and civilian officials are directing the US helicopter crews to the villages where aid is needed most.

 Lausman said homeless survivors were ?beginning to coalesce in makeshift refuge camps,? and organise themselves in the unloading of aid supplies, in contrast to earlier trips when desperate villagers dangerously mobbed helicopters for aid.

 Large cargo planes rumble into Banda Aceh airport carrying aid from around the world as hundreds of refugees wait in hope for a seat on the empty aircraft returning to the city of Medan, 450 km to the southeast. The landscape along the devastated west coast of Aceh was one of total and massive destruction, with whole villages levelled by the killer waves with only the foundations of homes remaining.

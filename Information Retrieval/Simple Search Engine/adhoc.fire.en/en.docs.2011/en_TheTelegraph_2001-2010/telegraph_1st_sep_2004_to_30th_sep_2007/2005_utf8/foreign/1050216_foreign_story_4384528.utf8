 Jail for child rape priest

 Cambridge (Massachusetts), Feb. 15 (Reuters): A judge sentenced defrocked priest Paul Shanley to 12 to 15 years in prison today for his child rape conviction last week in one of the most high-profile cases to stem from a US Catholic clergy abuse scandal.

 The judge also sentenced Shanley, 74, to 10 years probation after he is released. A jury found Shanley guilty last week of raping a boy in the 1980s at a Boston-area church. 

 Shanley was indicted in 2002 on charges of child rape and indecent assault and battery on a child. Prosecutors dropped most of the charges because three of the original four accusers either would not testify or could not be found.

 The Vatican defrocked Shanley last year, more than two decades after his superiors received complaints about the priest?s views on sex between men and boys.

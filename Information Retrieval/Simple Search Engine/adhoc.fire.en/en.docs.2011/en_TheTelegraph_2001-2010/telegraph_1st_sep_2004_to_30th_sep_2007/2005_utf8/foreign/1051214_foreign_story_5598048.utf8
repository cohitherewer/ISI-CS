 Fine Print

 Younger groom

 Atlanta, Dec. 13 (AP): A 37-year-old woman who is seven months pregnant by her 15-year-old groom says she prefers older men, but the teenager aggressively wooed her.

 Lisa Clark, who is charged with child molestation, statutory rape and enticing a child for indecent purposes, said in television interviews yesterday that she still hopes to make a life with him and their baby.

 Theyre making a big deal out of a 15-year-old, she said. And I can assure you that he was no victim. Its not like they are making it out to be. Actually, Id told him no several times because I prefer someone older, but he was just so nice and so sweet.

 The boy, who had been on probation on an unrelated burglary case, has been ordered to return to juvenile detention.

 Snake stir 

 Manila (AP): A two-metre python sparked 

 a commotion at a Manila police station on Tuesday, with 

 rattled policemen used to battling tough criminals forced 

 to destroy an officers desk where the snake slithered 

 in to hide. The incident started when a bystander saw the 

 python near a restaurant. Village guards managed to capture 

 the snake and bring it to the police station. But the python 

 quickly slithered out and sneaked into the desk. 

 Fatal drive 

 Strasbourg (Reuters): A French drove up a motorway in the wrong direction for 11 miles, crashing into five other vehicles and killing one person and injuring three others, including two children. The 66-year-old man continued driving after his first two collisions in the hope of finding an exit. The retired motorist, driving with his wife, only came to a halt when he collided head-on with another car.

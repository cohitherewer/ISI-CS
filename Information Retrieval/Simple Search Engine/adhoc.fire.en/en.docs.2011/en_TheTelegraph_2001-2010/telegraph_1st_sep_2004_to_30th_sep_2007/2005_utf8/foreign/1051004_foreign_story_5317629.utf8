 Bush chooses ally as judge

 Washington, Oct. 3 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today nominated a member of his inner circle, White House counsel Harriet Miers, for a Supreme Court vacancy, choosing a woman with plenty of legal experience but who is not a judge to replace the retiring Sandra Day Connor.

 Miers, 60, would be the third woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court.

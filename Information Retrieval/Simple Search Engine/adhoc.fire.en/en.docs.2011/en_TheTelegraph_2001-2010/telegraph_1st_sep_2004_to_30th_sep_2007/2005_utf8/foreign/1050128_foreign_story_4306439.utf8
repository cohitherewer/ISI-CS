 Passive smoking risk for kids

 London, Jan. 27 (Reuters): Children exposed to passive smoking have a higher risk of developing lung cancer later in life than other youngsters, according to new research.

 Daily exposure for many hours could treble the risk but even if children encountered second-hand smoke only on a weekly basis it could be dangerous. ?Passive smoking clearly increases the risk of lung cancer,? Prof. Paolo Vineis, of Imperial College London, said. ?People should not smoke in the presence of their children.?

 Vineis and his team followed up more than 123,000 people who never smoked but who had been exposed to second-hand smoke as children, to see how many developed lung cancer.

 They compared the occurrence of the disease in them with that in children who had not been exposed to smoke.

 In research reported in the British Medical Journal, they said 97 of the passive smoking youngsters suffered from lung cancer, 20 others had upper respiratory cancers and 14 more died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

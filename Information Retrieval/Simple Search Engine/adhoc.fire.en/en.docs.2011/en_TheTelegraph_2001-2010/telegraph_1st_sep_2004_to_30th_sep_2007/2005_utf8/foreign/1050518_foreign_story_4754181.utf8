 Deadly Indian doctor

 Sydney, May 17 (AP): More than 100 patients died or had to be transferred to other hospitals for further care after they were treated by an Indian-born doctor dubbed Dr Death by Australian media, state health officials said in a report.

 Dr Jayant M. Patel was granted permission to practice medicine in Australia in 2003, despite previously being cited for gross negligence by medical boards in two US states ? New York and Oregon.

 Patel worked as a surgeon and later as the director of surgery at Bundaberg Base Hospital in eastern Queensland state for about two years before colleagues made allegations that linked him to the deaths or serious injuries of 14 patients. He is now the subject of an inquiry to be launched next week. Patel left Australia shortly after the allegations surfaced. His whereabouts are unknown.

 A report submitted to the inquiry by Queensland health officials today found that 110 of the 1,202 patients Patel treated had either died or were transferred to other medical facilities for further treatment.

 An appendix to the report obtained by AP shows that among those 110 patients, 30 died in the Bundaberg Hospital, four died after being transferred to another hospital for further treatment and 35 died after being discharged from the Bundaberg Hospital. 

 The allegations against Patel were first raised in March, when a local lawmaker tabled in parliament a letter from a senior nurse at the hospital raising suspicion about 14 cases that were handled by Patel. The suspicious cases included one patient who died of massive chest injuries after the surgeon allegedly blocked his transfer to a larger hospital in the Queensland state capital, Brisbane.

 Prior to moving to Australia, Patel worked for 12 years at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Oregon and at hospitals in Rochester and Buffalo, New York, according to a report.

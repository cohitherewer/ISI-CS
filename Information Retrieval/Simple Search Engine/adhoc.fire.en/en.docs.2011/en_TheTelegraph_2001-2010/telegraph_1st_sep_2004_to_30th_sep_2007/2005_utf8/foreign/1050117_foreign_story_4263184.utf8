 Pak army glare on Baluch revolt

 Islamabad, Jan. 16: The Pakistani army appears all set to tackle the latest wave of insurgency sweeping Baluchistan after the province formally sought the federal government?s assistance to secure its gas installations.

 While interior minister Aftab Sherpao did not rule out a military operation in the area to restore the government?s writ, provincial authorities, including home minister Mir Shoaib Nausherwani, opposed such an action. ?We have simply asked the federal government to take charge of the security,? Nausherwani said.

 He said the decision to seek the federal government?s help was prompted by five days of clashes in Sui between security forces and armed men, which claimed at least 10 lives. The clashes disrupted the supply of gas to several parts of the country after a purification plant was hit by rockets, and forced the shutdown of the largest natural gasfield at Sui a couple of days ago.

 Rich in natural and mineral resources, Baluchistan is the largest of Pakistan?s four provinces, but has a high illiteracy and unemployment rate. 

 A low-level insurgency simmering for years gained momentum in recent months after the Baluchistan Liberation Army ? which cropped up in the 1980s as a pro-Moscow militant organisation to fight for an independent state comprising all Baluch areas in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan ? stepped up attacks on government installations and personnel. 

 Leading the insurgency are provincial tribal chiefs ? Nawab Akbar Bugti (in whose area of dominance the Sui gas fields are located), Nawab Khair Bakhsh Mari and Sardar Attaullah Mengal. Mengal played an important role in instigating an armed rebellion with Bugti and Mari in the mid-1970s, but the revolt was crushed. At stake is a greater share of natural resources in the province. Besides, the chiefs oppose additional military garrisons that the army plans to set up in the near future. 

 Joining this chorus is former Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali, who represents Baluchistan?s Rojhan Jamali constituency in the National Assembly. ?Such a campaign could not be called a liberation movement. But justice should be done to the people of Baluchistan and their genuine demands should be met after talks,? he said. 

 The insurgency has led President Pervez Musharraf to issue a stern warning to Baluch nationalists in an interview earlier this week: ?Don?t push us. It?s not the seventies, when you can hit and run and hide in the mountains?.

 However, political analyst Rashed Rahman pointed out that the army did not succeed in quelling the rebellion in four previous campaigns ? in 1948, 1958-62, 1963-69 and 1973-77. ?Baluchistan needs fast economic development and special human resource development programmes. It needs more educationists, doctors, engineers, technocrats and enough skilled and semi-skilled people to help build this province.?

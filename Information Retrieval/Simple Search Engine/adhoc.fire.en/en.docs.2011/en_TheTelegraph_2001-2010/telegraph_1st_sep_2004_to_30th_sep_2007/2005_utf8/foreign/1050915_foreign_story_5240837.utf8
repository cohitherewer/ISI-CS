 William in Di steps

 SALLY POOK

 London, Sept. 14: Prince William has become patron of Centrepoint, the youth homelessness charity that was one of his mothers favourite organisations.

 It is the princes first patronage and illustrates his desire to continue the legacy of Diana, Princess of Wales, who remained a supporter of Centrepoint despite relinquishing most of her charitable duties in 1996.

 Only months before announcing her decision to sever her links with almost 100 charities, the princess took both Prince William, then 13, and Prince Harry on a late-night visit to one of the charitys shelters in London, where they met young homeless people. The princess took on the role of patron of Centrepoint in 1992 and held it until her death five years later.

 Prince William, 23, has already immersed himself in the work of the charity, spending two days carrying out duties such as serving breakfast and lunch to young homeless people and acting as a care worker to them.

 He also helped to find temporary housing for the homeless and filled in accommodation and benefit forms. Other work included his attendance at workshops where young people were given the chance to talk through their problems. In a statement, the prince said: I have always been deeply concerned for those people, especially young people who, for whatever reason, find themselves living on the streets or without a proper home.

 Prince William sat in on a briefing for volunteers, including a cabbie and a nurse, and was interested in the fact that they had worked hard all day and were now working again. The prince has always been passionate about helping the homeless.

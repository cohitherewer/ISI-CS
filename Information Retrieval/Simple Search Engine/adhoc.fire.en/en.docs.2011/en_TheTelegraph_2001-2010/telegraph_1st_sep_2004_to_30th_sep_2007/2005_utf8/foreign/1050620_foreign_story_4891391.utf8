 Guilt makes 9/11 widow blow bloody money

 JAMES LANGTON 

Long Island, June 19: The nights were worst: 

when the empty side of the bed reminded Kathy Trant of losing her beloved husband, 

Dan, in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. 

 With a pile of glossy catalogues in one hand and a credit card in the other, she would try to ease the guilt she felt about the $4.7 million in compensation she received by spending it ? on seven flat-screen television sets, chandeliers, a swimming pool, and half a million dollars on designer shoes.

 Three years later, what Trant, 43, calls Monopoly money, blood money, is mostly gone. She has $500,000 left to support her three children but is, she says, looking forward to the day when she has burned through the lot and can live a normal life like I was used to.

 I want my husband back. I dont want the money, she explains. Thanks to her shopaholism, the couples modest home in a middle-class suburb of Long Island has been transformed in a $2-million makeover.

 Her walk-in wardrobe is filled with more than 200 pairs of Prada, Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo shoes. They cost between $200 and $1,000 and most have never been worn. Versace and Dior gowns are crushed on dozens of coat hangers, some still bearing $1,200 price tags. 

 For her 16-year-old son, she bought Gucci shoes, until one day he said, Mom, I dont need this stuff.

 Still she shopped. Only last month did she recognise that guilt was fuelling her obsessive spending. 

 Dan Trant, her soulmate of 15 years, had been a trader with Cantor Fitzgerald who died after making one last call home. The plane had struck a few floors below, Trant says. I could hear the fear in his voice. He told me he couldnt breathe, that the heat was unbearable. Then he said, I love you, Kathy. I love you and the kids more than anything. I didnt want him to hang up, I was hysterical. Then the phone went dead.

 Dan Trants ashes lie mingled with the rubble of the twin towers in a Staten Island rubbish dump, along with those of another 1,160 victims whose remains have never been found.

 By accepting compensation from the American government, Trant surrendered any right to sue the authorities who decided that the ashes would not be given an official burial at Ground Zero. It is a decision she bitterly regrets.

 I have so much guilt I vomit. I want to give the money away. The day I signed the Victim Compensation Fund agreement, I signed all my rights to my husband away. I cant get him out of the landfill on Staten Island. And the money, to me, is just evil.

 As a widow, Trant initially turned to alcohol and anti-depressants. The money offered another way to numb the pain. She converted one room into a shrine to her husband, furnished with sofas and cushions in patriotic blue denim, and red and white leather. 

 Kerry Sulkowicz, a psychiatrist at New York University, is not surprised. That money may feel like an unbearable reminder of the loss for the rest of their lives. What many of these people are seeking they can never find: the resumption of their happy lives before September 11.

 While Trant has lavished thousands on herself and her family, she has also been supremely generous to others, paying $20,000 towards one friends bills, spending $150,000 on trips to the Caribbean, Las Vegas and the Superbowl for friends and relations, even giving a beautician $4,000 for breast implants and her cleaner $15,000 to buy a home in El Salvador. 

 The reaction in the US to her obsessive spending has left her astonished and bitter. One female television interviewer gushed that she had every womans dream. 

 Youre wrong, Trant told her. What happened to me is every womans nightmare.

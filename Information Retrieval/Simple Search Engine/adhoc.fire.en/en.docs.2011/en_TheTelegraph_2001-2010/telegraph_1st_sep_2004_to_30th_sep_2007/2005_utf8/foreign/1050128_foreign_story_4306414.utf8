 Death camp revisited

 Oswiecim (Poland), Jan. 27 (Reuters): World leaders and survivors stopped to remember the horror of the Holocaust today at a snow-swept ceremony in Auschwitz-Birkenau on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp.

 Surrounded by barbed wire fences and remnants of the killing machine used to gas and incinerate some of the 11 million people who died in the Holocaust, the leaders arriving for the ceremony vowed that the World War II atrocity should never be forgotten.

 Up to 1.5 million people died in the gas chambers and crematoria of Auschwitz-Birkenau, set up by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II as the main centre of their ?Final Solution?, the genocide of 6 million European Jews.

 Auschwitz was liberated on January 27, 1945, by the advancing Soviet army whose stunned soldiers released 7,000 emaciated prisoners left behind as the Germans withdrew. 

 ?The snow was falling like today, we were dressed in stripes and some of us had bare feet,? Polish survivor Kazimierz Orlowski, 84, said on Thursday. 

 Elderly survivors, many accompanied by younger relatives, walked slowly past the rusting wire fences under a dark grey sky and heavily falling snow towards a monument to the victims.

 ?I am not here to talk about what happened. My only aim is to light a candle for my mother, whose ashes are who knows where in this camp,? said Jan Wojciech Topolewski, a former prisoner whose mother died in Auschwitz. 

 The site has become the most powerful symbol of the Holocaust.

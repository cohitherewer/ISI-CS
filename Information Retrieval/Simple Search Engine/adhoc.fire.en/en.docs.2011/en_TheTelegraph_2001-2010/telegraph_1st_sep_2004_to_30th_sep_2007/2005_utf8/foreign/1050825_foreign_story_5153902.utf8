 Take out Chavez, says US leader 

 TOM BALDWIN

 Washington, Aug. 24: Pat Robertson, the former presidential candidate and founder of the Christian Coalition, has called on the US government to assassinate the democratically-elected leader of Venezuela.

 The right-wing religious broadcaster warned that President Hugo Chavez was a terrific danger to the US because he wanted to use his oil-rich country as a a launching pad for communist infiltration and Muslim extremism.

 Robertson, speaking on the Christian Broadcast Networks The 700 Club television programme, said: We have the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that we exercise that ability. We dont need another $200-billion war to get rid of one strong-arm dictator. 

 Chavez, who faces fresh elections next year, has infuriated the US administration by accusing it of plotting to overthrow his government and kill him. State department officials have dismissed such charges as ridiculous. But Robertson said: If he thinks were trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it. Its a whole lot cheaper than starting a war ? and I dont think any oil shipments will stop.

 The US, which wants to reduce its reliance on West Asia, buys about 10 per cent of its oil from Venezuela.

 Arroyo ringtone

 Manila, June 20 (Reuters): Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo may be struggling with record-low popularity, but a simple two-word greeting attributed to her has shot to the top of the charts in the cellphone-mad country.

 A website offering a mobile phone ringtone featuring the words: Hello Garci, briefly crashed late last week as thousands of Filipinos clamoured to download it. Text message consumer rights group TXTpower said its site (www.txtpower.org) had been overwhelmed by demand for the clip taken from an Arroyo recording.

 at the centre of allegations Arroyo tried to fix the result of last years election.

 So many users were accessing the Web site that the allotted bandwidth was consumed, TXTpowers Ricardo Banague told Reuters on Monday.

 the full conversation, which the government says was illegally wiretapped and then doctored, a woman who sounds like Arroyo asks senior election official Virgilio Garcillano whether she would win by more than 1 million votes in a southern area. The opposition has said the recording bolsters its claim that Arroyo cheated her way to election victory this year.

 The scandal has unnerved markets amid rumours of coup plots and mass protests against Arroyo.

 Banague said the site had received more than 72,000 hits since Friday, when it started offering the ringtone. It was still recording about 170 downloads an hour.

 The countrys 37 million mobile users, more than a third of the population, send an average of seven messages every day.

 Opponents of Arroyos predecessor, former movie star Joseph Estrada, famously used text messaging to help organise a People Power revolt that drove him from office in 2001.

Richmond (Virginia), Feb. 11 (AP): Virginia 

lawmakers dropped their droopy-pants bill after the whole thing became just too 

embarrassing.

 The bill, which would have slapped a $50 fine on people who wear their pants so low that their underwear is visible in ?a lewd or indecent manner?, passed the state House on Tuesday but was killed by a Senate committee two days later. 

 Senator Thomas K. Norment said news reports implied that lawmakers were preoccupied with droopy pants. ?I find that an indignation, which dampens my humour,? Norment said. Senator Kenneth Stolle, the committee chairman, called the bill ?a distraction.?

 The committee hearing drew a standing-room-only crowd that included about 75 government students from Surry County High School. 

 ?If people in Florida can wear bikinis, a little underwear showing isn?t going to hurt anybody,? 17-year-old Elvyn Shaw said.

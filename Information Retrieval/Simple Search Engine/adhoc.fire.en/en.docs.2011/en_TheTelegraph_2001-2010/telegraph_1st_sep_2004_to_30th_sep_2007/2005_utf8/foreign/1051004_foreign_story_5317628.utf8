 US army denies Qaida killed 2 Marines

 Dubai, Oct 3 (Reuters): Al Qaidas wing in Iraq said today it had killed two US Marines it said it seized in western Iraq, according to a web posting, but the US military denied it.

 A spokesman for US forces in Iraq, Lieutenant-Colonel Steven Boylan, described the statement from the Islamist militant group as disgusting propaganda, adding: We have no reports of any deaths.

 The al Qaida group statement posted on the Internet provided no pictures. It said the two were executed after US forces failed to release Sunni women prisoners as demanded by the group.

 After a deadline given to the crusaders passed, in support of our Muslim sisters and fellow Sunnis in prisons ... our lions carried out Gods law against the two prisoners in a way that soothes the faithful, said the statement from al Qaida Organisation in Iraq.

 The statement, posted on a website that often carries al Qaida statements, was issued by the groups spokesman in Iraq. Unlike such statements in the past, it carried no pictures or video.

 Saddam trial

 Iraqs special tribunal, the court set up to try Saddam Hussein, confirmed today that the former President would be tried on October 19 for crimes against humanity, but said it had the right to delay the trial.

 Rice in new warning to Iran

 United Nations, Sept. 17 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice demanded today that Iran abandon a suspected quest for atomic weapons but Tehrans new President said his country would defend its right to enrich uranium.

 Rice told the UN General Assembly that Irans nuclear programme was a real threat to global security and the Security Council must deal with it unless Iran ended sensitive activities and resumed talks with the EU.

 Iran should return to negotiations with the EU3 and abandon forever its plans for a nuclear weapons capability, she said. When diplomacy has been exhausted, the Security Council must become involved.

 However, state department spokesman Sean McCormack later quoted Rice as saying: There is still time for diplomacy but its up to the Iranians to seize the opportunity.

 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a television interview that his countrys programme was entirely legal. He attacked what he called nuclear apartheid that would permit some countries to enrich fuel, but not others. The first point is stressing the right of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue and have the nuclear (fuel) cycle, he told CNN.

 Speaking through an interpreter, Ahmadinejad called for a UN committee to control the spread of nuclear weapons technology and did not rule out triggering an oil price rise if the West hauled Iran to the top UN body for sanctions.

 Any intelligent, healthy smart human being should use every resource in order to maintain his or her freedom and independence, he said when asked about the oil weapon. Iran has the means to defend and obtain its rights, he added.

 Ahmadinejad gave few details of proposals he was to outline to the General Assembly later aimed at allaying international concerns about Irans nuclear ambitions.

 The Islamic Republic swears its programme, concealed from the International Atomic Energy Agency for 18 years, is purely for civilian energy purposes.

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan warned the world in his opening address that the consensus underlying the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was badly frayed while nations pointed fingers at each other rather than working for solutions.

 Iran last month spurned a European package of economic, security and technology incentives for it to abandon sensitive nuclear work and reactivated a factory converting uranium ore into gas, prompting the EU to break off talks.

 Fine Print

 Smelly split

 Tehran, March 2 (Reuters): An Iranian woman has requested a divorce from her husband on the grounds that he has not washed for more than a year.

 ?My husband says he does not like water and does not want to take a shower... He doesn?t even wash his face when he wakes up in the morning,? Mina, 36, was quoted as saying in court by the state-run Iran newspaper.

 When the couple first married 

 eight years ago her husband was obsessively clean, she said. 

 ?He spent hours taking showers three times a day and washed his hands every few minutes,? Mina said. ?But he suddenly changed... Now nobody, including me, my children and his colleagues, can stand him.?

 Mel island

 Suva (AP): Hollywood star Mel Gibson 

 has purchased a Pacific island hideway in northern Fiji, 

 but the sale faces a legal challenge from villagers who 

 claim their ancestors were forced off the island. Gibson 

 purchased the 5,411-acre Mago Island from Japan?s Tokyu 

 Corp for about $15 million. The Fiji government?s cabinet 

 approved the sale last month. 

 Terror trick

 Ottawa (Reuters): Canadian defence minister Bill Graham had trouble boarding a plane to the US in January because his name was on a US no-fly list designed to deter terrorists, the Globe and Mail said on Wednesday. It said Graham had to wait while his staff found ways to vouch for his identity. ?Apparently there is another Bill Graham out there somewhere who did something to get his name on an American watch list,? the paper said. ?Graham was obliged to prove that he was the other Bill Graham, the one in charge of the Canadian (Armed) Forces.?

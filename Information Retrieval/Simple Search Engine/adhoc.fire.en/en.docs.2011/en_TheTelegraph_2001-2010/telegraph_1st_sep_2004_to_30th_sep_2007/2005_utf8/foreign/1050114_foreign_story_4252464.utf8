 A President needs God, says Bush

 Washington, Jan. 13: President George W Bush yesterday placed religion at the very centre of American politics by insisting that all US Presidents needed a relationship with God to do their job.

 However, he also sought to neutralise the controversy such a forthright statement of faith would provoke by stressing that he had no wish to impose his convictions on others. If he did, America would be little different from Afghanistan under the Taliban, he suggested.

 ?I don?t see how you can be President ? at least from my perspective ? without a relationship with the Lord,? he told the Washington Times in an interview a week before his inauguration for his second term. He also appealed to America?s tradition of religious freedom.

 ?I fully understand that the job of the President is, and must always be, protecting the great right of people to worship or not worship as they see fit,? he said. ?That?s what distinguishes us from the Taliban. The greatest freedom we have ? or one of the greatest freedoms ? is the right to worship as you see fit.?

 His comments were none the less sure to prompt renewed outrage from those in America and abroad who see in Bush a Christian fundamentalist let loose on the Oval Office and pandering to the powerful Evangelical movement in the country. The religious Right turned out in record numbers to re-elect Bush, a Methodist, in many ?heartland? states.

 But professions of religious faith are nothing unusual from occupants of the White House. Jimmy Carter preached in church while in office and Bill Clinton regularly took part in religious services.

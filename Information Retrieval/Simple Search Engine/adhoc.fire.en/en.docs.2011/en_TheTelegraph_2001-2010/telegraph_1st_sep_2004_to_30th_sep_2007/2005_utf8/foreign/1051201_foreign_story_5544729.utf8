 Tang Ge grabs phone, talks to woman

 Shanghai, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Tom Cruise got a taste of Asian cellphone etiquette in Shanghai when a local reporter took a call in the middle of his press event on the citys historic Bund today.

 Such chatter is common in much of Asia, where people routinely talk on their phones in the middle of news briefings and many other public gatherings.

 But the American superstar, in town to shoot scenes for his latest Mission: Impossible movie, took it all in his stride, borrowing the phone from the surprised reporter to talk to the woman caller.

 Hello. Xie xie. Ni hao. How are you? said an amused Cruise, dressed in black, exhausting his limited Chinese vocabulary before going on to ask if the woman ? the reporters wife ? was at work and about her marital status. Cruise and his crew were meeting the media after wrapping up two weeks of shooting for Mission: Impossible III.

 The film was being shot in Shanghai and nearby Xitang, a town criss-crossed by canals, with other scenes in Italy, Germany and the US.

 The visit to China by one of the worlds biggest stars, who is travelling with pregnant fiancee Katie Holmes, has created a massive buzz in the local media, where the actor is known affectionately as Tang Ge, or Big Brother Tom.

 Cruise, whose credits include last years War of the Worlds and two previous Mission: Impossible movies, said during the briefing that he and Holmes, who plan to get married, have yet to set a date but that the wedding will happen next year.

 During his brief China trip, Cruise has been spotted at a number of trendy Shanghai hang-outs, including a swanky restaurant on the Bund, and a Sichuan eaterie where he reportedly paid more than 5,000 yuan ($618) for a meal ? an astronomical sum by Chinese standards.

 The producers of M:I3 reportedly payed 100 million yuan for the use of Xitang, which was sealed off to the public during filming. Total production costs for the film are expected to exceed $150 million.

 Shanghais Gotham-esque Jinmao tower, the countrys tallest building and home to the Grand Hyatt hotel, and the citys futuristic Pearl TV tower, will both feature in the movie. So will the Huangpu river, which snakes through the city before feeding into the Yangtze.

 Cruise gushed about the citys spectacular vistas and the general thrill of his brief trip, saying he planned to come back in the future to see more of the country. 

 Its spectacular. Its unbelievable, he said. Its going to look extraordinary on film.

 The first two Mission: Impossible movies made a combined $396 million at the North American box office. The new film is directed by J.J. Abrams, the creator of hit TV series Lost. It is scheduled for release next summer, a year later than originally planned due to production difficulties.

 Sobhraj to stay in jail

 Kathmandu, Aug 4: Bikini-killer Charles Sobhraj today suffered a major setback after an appellate court rejected his appeal and re-affirmed a lower courts order sentencing him to life in prison for the murder of two American backpackers. 

 Life means 20 years in prison in Nepal.

 Soon after the judge read out the verdict dismissing his appeal against the 2003 judgment, Sobhraj said he was simply shocked by the decision. 

 It is unbelievable. I am absolutely shocked, he said as he was taken back to jail. 

 Wearing a polo cap and glasses, the frail Sobhraj said he would appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court. 

 This would, effectively, be his last attempt to overturn the lower courts judgment. 

 Sobhraj, who has already spent 20 years in prison in India for a string of crimes, was arrested from a Kathmandu casino after a local daily, The Himalayan Times, carried a story about his presence in the capital.

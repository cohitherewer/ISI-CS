 Killer Iran tremor

 Tehran, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Ten people were killed and 50 injured when an earthquake razed mud-brick villages on the Gulf island of Qeshm off Irans south coast on Sunday, officials and state media said.

 Irans official news agency Irna said the quake, with a magnitude of 5.9, shook southern Iran for about 10 to 15 seconds at 1.53 pm (10.23 GMT).

 A volunteer with the Red Crescent in Qeshm, said the main hospital on the island was struggling to keep up with the number of patients.

 State media said there were three strong aftershocks.

 Tonban, Gavarzin, Khaledin and Gourian were the hardest hit villages on Qeshm, the biggest island in south Hormuzgan province with a population of about 120,000.

 The US Geological Survey said the quake was of 6.1 magnitude, and placed it about 58 km southwest of the Gulf port of Bandar Abbas.

 Todays temblor is the first killer quake in Iran since February when over 600 people died in a magnitude 6.4 tremor, centred on the town of Zarand about 700 km from Tehran.

 Wolfowitz pats China for progress

 London, April 1 (Reuters): Newly appointed World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz welcomed China?s stunning economic development today and said the world should engage with the Chinese even if they disagreed with their politics.

 In his first radio interview since he was confirmed in the job, Wolfowitz told the BBC that ?the goal of poverty reduction is as valid in China as it is elsewhere?.

 Asked if the World Bank would attach strings to its dealings with China to encourage it to embrace democracy, Wolfowitz said: ?I don?t believe it should.?

 ?The economic development of China is a positive development ... and something that the US and the world should welcome and work with,? he added.

 Critics of Wolfowitzs appointment have said they expect the hawkish U.S. deputy defence secretary to make more demands on recipient countries than his predecessors, insisting they make democratic reforms in exchange for World Bank help.

 Wolfowitz said his critics would find him a capable leader.

 ?Im very prepared to listen, Im very prepared to be an international civil servant,? he said.?I am quite capable of focusing on the mission of the organisation Im working in.?

 The World Bank unanimously approved Wolfowitz as its new president on Thursday despite quiet misgivings by some member countries over his role as an architect of the Iraq war.

 The outcome had largely been decided by the governments of the banks major shareholder nations before the 24-member board met for a vote by consensus.

 Wolfowitz, 61, will overlap with current bank chief and Clinton appointee James Wolfensohn before taking office on June 1.

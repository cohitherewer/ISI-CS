 Domestic dangers 

 Bogota, July 20 (AFP): Failure to help with the kids and the dishes could soon be grounds for divorce in Colombia, if a proposed law gets passed.

 Men treat women like slaves who wash the dishes while they relax, said Senator Carlos Moreno de Caro, the bills author. This injustice has to end. The bill, which will be up for debate in the congressional session, would enable either spouse to accuse the other of domestic sloth. But the text states that cooking, cleaning, and caring for the kids cannot be considered solely the womans responsibility. Starting now it will be cause for divorce if the husband does not help with the domestic work, the lawmaker said. 

 Testing drunken driving

 Stockholm (Reuters): Carmaker Volvo has asked for special 

exemption from Swedens tough drink-driving laws so its test drivers can 

have a glass too many to test new safety systems that warn if a driver is not 

reacting to danger. Volvo, whose success rests on its reputation for building 

safety-conscious family cars, will only let its drunk drivers take the wheel on 

its own test tracks near the west coast city of Gothenburg if it gets permission 

from the Swedish government. Its a matter of developing technical 

systems that warn if the driver isnt reacting properly, said Christer 

Gustafsson, spokesman for Volvo Cars. 

 Naked shopper sent home

 Berlin (Reuters): German police let a nearly naked shopper go home after she told them she was getting groceries in the nude because she lost a spin the bottle contest, a police spokesman in Cologne said. Were a tolerant city that is open to the world, said spokesman Burkard Jahn.She could have been arrested for disturbing the peace, but we decided to let her go home with a verbal warning. The 35-year-old woman entered the 24-hour shop at 4 am wearing nothing but an unbuttoned jacket.

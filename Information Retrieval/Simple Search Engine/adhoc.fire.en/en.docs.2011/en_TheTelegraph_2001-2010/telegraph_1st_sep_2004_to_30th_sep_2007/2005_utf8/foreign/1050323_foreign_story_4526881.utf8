 Lost Dumas novel found

 Paris, March 22 (Reuters): A forgotten novel by Alexandre Dumas, author of The Three Musketeers, is set to go on sale in June after a scholar found the incomplete work buried among archives in France?s national library. 

 Claude Schopp, an expert on Dumas? works, has spent 10 years touching up the story, entitled The Knight of Sainte-Hermine, which was rushed out in rough-and-ready serialised form in Dumas? final days.

 Dumas died in 1870 without completing the 900-page epic, extracts of which were published in serialised form in 1869 in a daily, Le Moniteur Universel.

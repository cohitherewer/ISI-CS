 Director?s grief at tsunami memorial

 HELEN JOHNSTONE

 London, March 8: Lord Attenborough, the actor and film director, made an emotional tribute at a memorial service yesterday to three members of his family who died in the Asian tsunami disaster.

 It was the first time 81-year-old Lord Attenborough had spoken publicly since the Boxing Day tragedy that claimed the lives of his 14-year-old granddaughter, Lucy, his elder daughter, Jane, 49, and her mother-in-law, Jane Holland, 83.

 Two other members of the family survived unscathed, Lord Attenboroughs son-in-law, Michael Holland, and his eldest grandson, Sam. His other granddaughter Alice, 17, also survived but is still recovering from serious injuries.

 The family had gone to Southeast Asia over Christmas to spend two weeks on the island for what had been intended as the first of many visits to their recently acquired Thai holiday home.

 Lucy was killed almost instantly as a wall of water engulfed their beach resort of Phuket. Lord Attenboroughs daughter and her mother-in-law were swept away when the wave struck.

 His face etched in grief at the loss of two generations of his family, Lord Attenborough, who was accompanied at the memorial service by his wife, Sheila Sim, attempted to read the anonymously-written funeral poem, She Is Gone, but broke down in tears before he was able to finish it.

 Canon Andrew Nunn, told more than 500 mourners in Southwark Cathedral, south London, that the Attenboroughs?s grief resonated with everyone affected by the tsunami. ?Members of your family have names and faces known to many. Your tragedy became one shared by many in this country. Your pain became the pain of many,? he said.

 The choir from The Kings School, Canterbury, where Lucy was a pupil, sang at the service.

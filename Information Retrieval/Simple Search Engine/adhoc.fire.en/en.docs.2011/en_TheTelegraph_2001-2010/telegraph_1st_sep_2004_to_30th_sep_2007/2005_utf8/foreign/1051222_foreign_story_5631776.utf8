 Fine Print

 Bad Santa

 Berlin, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Drunken Santas on a rampage in New Zealand, armed German robbers in Santa disguises, a British St Nick wanted for flashing, and a Swedish vandal in a Santa outfit are giving the big man in red a bad name this year.

 Armed with a gun, a man in a Santa outfit held up a furniture store in Ludwigshafen and forced two cashiers to open the safe. He filled his sack with cash, locked the two women in the safe and escaped. 

 Good worm 

 Berlin (Reuters): A child porn offender 

 in Germany turned himself in to the police after mistaking 

 an email he received from a computer worm for an official 

 warning that he was under probe. It just goes to show 

 that computer worms arent always destructive, 

 Paderborn police said. Here it helped us to uncover 

 a crime which would otherwise probably have gone undetected. 

 Shop riddle

 Chihuahua, Mexico (Reuters): Peering through the glass at a mannequins veined hands, sparkling eyes and eerie smile, the small crowd gathered outside a store in northern Mexico tries to settle a macabre riddle beguiling many. Is the tall, slender bridal figure in the window a richly detailed shops dummy or, as a local legend says, the decades-old embalmed corpse of the former store owners daughter? The haunting figure known as La Pascualita, or Little Pascuala first appeared 75 years ago in the window of the bridal gown store. Since then, the striking realism of the dummy has spawned supernatural tales and reports of a miracle.

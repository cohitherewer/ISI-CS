 Stuntmen dying to be given an Oscar

 CATHERINE ELSWORTH

 Los Angeles, June 17: Stuntmen are fighting for the right to Hollywoods ultimate accolade: their own Oscar.

 The stunt profession argues that it has gone unnoticed and unrewarded by the academy for 40 years, a scandal given that its members are the only part of the movie industry that must risk their lives for the sake of their art.

 Yesterday, they took their campaign to the Beverly Hills headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to call for an Oscar for stunt co-ordinators.

 Jack Gill, whose years spent leaping from speeding cars have left him with a titanium plate in his neck, said: I am baffled why all these other categories ? production, design, special effects, wardrobe ? are included and we are left by the wayside.

 Visual effects already enjoy Oscar recognition and the stuntmen say computer-generated special effects increasingly hog the limelight and overshadow their work. 

 The academy has formally recognised only one stuntmans film work, Yakima Canutt, who received an honorary Oscar in 1967 for scenes such as the chariot race in Ben Hur.

 Mexican coast braces for Wilma

 Cancun (Mexico), Oct. 20 (Reuters): Hurricane Wilma closed in on Mexicos Caribbean beach resorts today, forcing thousands of tourists to flee their hotels and take shelter from powerful winds and rain that killed 10 people in Haiti.

 From Mexicos Yucatan peninsula and Honduras to Cuba and the fragile Florida Keys island chain, tens of thousands of people were evacuated as Wilma roared through the Caribbean, swelling seas with winds of around 230 kmph.

 Wilma was briefly the strongest Atlantic storm on record in terms of barometric pressure yesterday. It weakened to a Category 4 hurricane this morning but was expected to strengthen again before slamming into the Yucatan early tomorrow. 

 Wilma killed 10 people when its rains triggered mudslides in Haiti early in the week. It was expected to miss Gulf of Mexico oil and gas facilities, but Floridas orange groves were at risk.

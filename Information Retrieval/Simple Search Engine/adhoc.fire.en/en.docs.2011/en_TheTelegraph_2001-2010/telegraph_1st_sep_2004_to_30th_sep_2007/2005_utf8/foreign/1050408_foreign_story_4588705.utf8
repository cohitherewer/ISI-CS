 Annan slams rights body

 Geneva, April 7 (Reuters): Secretary-general Kofi Annan said the conduct of the United Nations? human rights body was undermining the credibility of the entire UN organisation and urged governments today to support his plan to reform it.

 ?Unless we remake our human rights machinery, we may be unable to renew public confidence in the United Nations itself,? he told the UN Commission on Human Rights, which is holding its annual six-week session at its Geneva headquarters.

 ?We have reached a point at which the commission?s declining credibility has cast a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations system... and where piecemeal reforms will not be enough,? he said.

 Launched some 60 years ago, the commission is the UN?s main mechanism for monitoring respect for human rights around the world. 

 But critics say in-fighting and its inability to act firmly in the face of clear abuse have eroded its authority.

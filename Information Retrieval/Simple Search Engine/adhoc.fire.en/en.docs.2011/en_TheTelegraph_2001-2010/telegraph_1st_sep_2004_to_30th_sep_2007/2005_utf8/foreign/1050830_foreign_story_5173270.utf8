 Australia leader quits over racist Asian slur

 Brogden: Pinch pest

 Sydney, Aug. 29 (AFP): A leading Australian politician resigned today after it was revealed that he called an opponents Malaysian wife a mail order bride, pinched the bottom of one female journalist and propositioned another at an alcohol-fuelled party. 

 New South Wales Opposition Liberal Party leader John Brogden told a hastily-called news conference that he regretted his inappropriate behaviour and would quit the post that could have seen him become state premier.

 He denied being drunk at the party thrown for the media by the Australian Hotels Association three weeks ago but admitted drinking six beers to celebrate the recent resignation of the long-standing Premier, Bob Carr. With Carr out of the way, Brogden, 37, was tipped to have a strong chance of taking the premiership at the next state elections in 2007.

 But his career was in ruins today after reports of his behaviour at the party surfaced in local newspapers, and he told the news conference: I acted dishonourably and now is the time to act honourably.

 Prime Minister John Howard, leader of Brogdens Liberal Party, earlier condemned the remarks about Carrs Malaysian-born wife Helena as just quite wrong.

 I know Helena Carr and shes a very gracious person. That sort of comment should never have been made.

 Carr, who resigned in July after leading Australias most populous state for 10 years, rejected Brogdens apology.

 I think that his apology is entirely unacceptable to Helena and that is the greatest insult not only to her but of every woman of Asian background, Carr said.

 His wife Helena said the remark was hurtful.

 Detention disorder

 A 10-year-old Iranian boy who says he suffers a psychological disorder after being detained for two years in razor-wire immigration detention centres is suing the Australian government.

 Shayan Badraie says he developed traumatic stress disorder while detained with his parents in the Woomera outback immigration centre in South Australia state and Sydneys Villawood detention centre between 2000 and 2002.

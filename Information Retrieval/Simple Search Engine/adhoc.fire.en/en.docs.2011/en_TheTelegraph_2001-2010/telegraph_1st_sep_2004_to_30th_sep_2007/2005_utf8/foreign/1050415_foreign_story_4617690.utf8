 Benazir feelers

 Rawalpindi, April 14 (Reuters): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said today he would be willing to meet Opposition leader-in-exile Benazir Bhutto to advance rapprochement with liberal forces, but not yet.

 Musharraf said Bhutto?s Pakistan Peoples Party was not helping reconciliation by planning rallies this Saturday to welcome back her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, from a visit in Dubai.

 ?Moderate forces need to unite to suppress the extremist forces,? Musharraf said in an interview when asked about reconciliation with liberal parties such as Bhutto?s.

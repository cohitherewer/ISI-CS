 Fine Print

 Beyonce fashion

 New York, Jan. 29 (AP): Beyonce Knowles is planning a new release ? her own fashion collection.

 The Destiny?s Child singer has signed a licencing agreement with the Tarrant Apparel Group to produce a line of apparel for young women. She named it the House of Dereon Collection after her grandmother Agnes Dereon, who worked as a seamstress.

 The first fashions will be in stores this autumn, and the look will be ?a mix of vintage things with contemporary things. It?ll be fur with denim, classic with street,? Beyonce said.

 The collection also will include party dresses, sweaters and even some tailored jackets. 

 Nazi trash

 Portland, Oregon (Reuters): The American Nazi Party has 

volunteered to pick up trash along a quiet stretch of rural road in Oregon state, 

causing an uproar after getting a sign placed there crediting its work. The issue 

has flared up in the same week that world leaders and ageing survivors gathered 

in Auschwitz to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the infamous Nazi 

death camp.

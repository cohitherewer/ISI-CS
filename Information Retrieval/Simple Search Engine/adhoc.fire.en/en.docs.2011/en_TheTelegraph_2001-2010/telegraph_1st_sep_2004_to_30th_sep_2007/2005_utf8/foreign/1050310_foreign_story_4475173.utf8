 Curse saved

 London, March 9 (Reuters): A 14-tonne ?cursed? artwork that some in a northern English city wanted destroyed because they said it had brought misery and misfortune has been saved.

 The city council has rejected a motion tabled by one of its members, councillor Jim Tootle, that the ?cursing stone? should be destroyed, blaming it for Carlisle?s recent bad luck.

 Since the boulder, which is inscribed with a 1,069-word curse, was installed in one of the city?s museums in 2001, Carlisle has been plagued by floods, foot-and-mouth disease, sporting humiliation and job losses.

 Written by the Archbishop of Glasgow in the 16th century, the curse was directed at ?reivers? who terrorised the area with blackmail, rape, pillage and robbery.

 Spoon-bending Israeli psychic Uri Geller even offered to ?save? Carlisle by exorcising the curse of evil forces in his healing garden.

 Porn tones

 San Francisco (Reuters): Adult film 

 company New Frontier Media has something new for cellphones: 

 ring moans. Wireless content company Brickhouse Mobile on 

 Tuesday said that under an agreement with New Frontier it 

 would begin offering ring tones for mobile phone users featuring 

 porn stars making groaning and moaning noises from the suggestive 

 to the positively tantalising.

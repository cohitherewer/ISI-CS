 Pak sisters nabbed for plotting suicide raids

 Islamabad, June 9 (AFP): Pakistani police have arrested two sisters from an Islamic militant group with links to al Qaida who were allegedly plotting suicide attacks against minority Shias, officials said today.

 They would have been the first female suicide bombers to strike the key US ally and were the subject of an intensive year-long hunt by security forces in Pakistan, which has suffered a recent wave of suicide bombings.

 The pair, identified by police as Arifa and Habiba and said to be aged between 18 and 20, were seized from a hideout in the scenic northern tourist town of Swat early this week, a senior security official said.

 Investigators said they were trained by their uncle, a top member of the Sunni Lashkar-e-Jhangvi group, who was sentenced to death last week for killing 45 people in two suicide attacks on Shia mosques in Karachi in 2004.

 Security agencies had been desperately looking for the two sisters and located them hiding in a house in Swat following a tip-off, a security official said. 

 It would have been the first attack of its kind and a very difficult one to prevent, added a senior police official.

 Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is regarded as the fiercest of Pakistans Sunni extremist outfits and has been blamed for the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl in early 2002.

 Kingdom to toe old line

 London, Aug. 1 (Reuters): 

 Monarch in all but name for 10 years already, Saudi Arabias 

 new reformist King Abdullah can wield full authority after 

 succeeding his half-brother Fahd but will not wrench the 

 conservative kingdom onto a different path.

 I cannot imagine there will be any particular change in that (foreign) policy undertaken by the late King Fahd, the Saudi ambassador to London, Prince Turki al-Faisal, said. Asked whether the same applied to oil policy, he said: Absolutely.

 Abdullah has run Saudi Arabias day-to-day affairs since Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995 and has been the central decision-maker on issues ranging from oil and West Asia to the countrys two-year battle against al Qaida militants.

 He has been a driving force behind economic reform in the worlds biggest oil exporter and initiated modest political change when Saudis voted in men-only elections this year for local councils. Four months later these have yet to be set up. Abdullah was named king today as soon as Fahds death was announced. 

 There will be no real change in relations with the US and no change over oil policy or in the security crackdown, predicted Mai Yamani, a Saudi analyst at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.

 Even leading an absolute monarchy, Abdullah will still have to take into account views of other senior royals, including his half-brother Prince Sultan, the new crown prince, Yamani added. Saudi Arabia has been tackling a wave of bombings by Saudi-born Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network since May 2003 and has also been trying to mend ties with Washington hurt by the September 11, 2001, attacks, carried out mainly by Saudi hijackers.

 In recent years the sickly King Fahd made brief public appearances to meet visiting dignitaries or to chair cabinet sessions. Officials who met him said conversation was sometimes limited to a simple exchange of greetings. While he was in hospital, often sedated or unconscious according to medical staff, state media continued to report decrees, telegrams and decisions issued in his name.

 What changed today is that Abdullah is totally in charge. He will have the support of everyone in the royal family to continue with his reform plan, said one Saudi official. He has had experience of being in charge. But being a king is different. Another Saudi source familiar with government policy said stability and continuity will mark Abdullahs reign, echoing a common refrain since Fahd was taken to hospital on May 27. 

 Officials had been anxious to signal clearly to the world that Fahds illness and the succession would not paralyse business in one of Washingtons key West Asia allies.

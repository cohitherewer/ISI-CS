 Unwired beaches

 Seoul, June 28 (Reuters): South Korea wants to make its beaches more user friendly and thinks a good place to start would be by removing enormous stretches of barbed wire from its shores.

 The maritime ministry said today it will start removing barbed wire, used to slow down a possible North Korean landing, from some of its eastern coastal areas next year in order to make the sandy shores more inviting to South Korean tourists. 

 U2 style

 Dublin (Reuters): Irish rock group U2 went to court on Tuesday to recover 5,000 euros ($6,062) worth of memorabilia ? including a pair of lead singer Bonos trousers ? from a former stylist. The multi-millionaires, who played to nearly 250,000 fans in three Dublin concerts over the last few days, are suing Lola Cashman for the return of a number of items she says she received as gifts. Bono rejected Cashmans claim she had been given the articles, including a Stetson hat, a pair of black three-quarter length trousers and earrings worn by him on the bands 1987 Joshua Tree tour. The stylists would never have asked for them and the band would never have given them, Bono said.

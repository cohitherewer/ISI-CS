 Cinema rises above DVDs

 London, Jan. 11: Fears that the rise of the DVD and hi-tech home entertainment would spell the demise of cinemas appear to have been exaggerated after new figures showed that box office takings were at an all-time high last year.

 Filmgoers in Britain and Ireland spent ?839 million over the last 12 months, an increase of almost four per cent on the previous year. Audience figures were also up, with 156.8 million attendances between January and November, according to the research company Neilsen EDI, compared with 148.5 million last year.

 Industry experts said the figures were particularly encouraging because the record takings were achieved despite the absence of any runaway blockbusters. With several heavily hyped releases due this year, including the final instalment of Star Wars, Steven Spielberg?s War of the Worlds and Peter Jackson?s remake of King Kong, many are confident that the British box office could soon top ?1 billion.

 Shrek 2 was the biggest hit of 2004 with takings of ?48.1 million, followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on ?46 million. Bridget Jones and the Edge of Reason was the year?s third highest grossing film, followed by The Incredibles and Spider-man 2.

 Robert Mitchell, box office analyst at Screen International, said the figures showed cinema was ?back on track? after a bumper year in 2002. Cinemas had responded to the challenges of advances in home entertainment to woo back customers, he said. ?They recognised the need to make cinema-going a much more pleasant experience. They have also improved the range of films on offer. It?s no longer just the same few blockbusters.? The greater diversity has also helped lure older cinemagoers back to the big screen. The number of over-35s has risen by 200 per cent in the past five years, the fastest growing of any demographic group.

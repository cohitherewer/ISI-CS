 Real beauty runs into real trouble

 JAMES LANGTON

 Fat not fit 

 London, Aug. 28: Fully clothed, they are a group of ordinary young women whom you might see on their way to work or play in any American city.

 Stripped down to their knickers and bras and magnified on huge advertising hoardings, they are the Amazonian symbols of an ever-widening gulf between Madison Avenues traditional fantasy of the female form and the way most women actually look.

 The Dove skincare companys campaign for real beauty featuring real women, launched in Britain last year, has finally made it to the US to a decidedly mixed reception.

 As in Britain, Doves attempt to sell a firming cream uses amateur models whose bulges and curves are never seen on the pages of glossy fashion magazines such as American Vogue or Harpers Bazaar.

 For many Americans, the sight of so much flesh has proved an unwelcome shock to the system. Dove, which is owned by Unilever, has been forced to replace dozens of posters after they were defaced by graffiti artists. Fat cows was among the few printable observations.

 Dubbed reality advertising by the industry, the campaign has also provoked hostile media reaction. The only time I want to see a thigh that big is in a bucket with bread crumbs on it, grumbled one columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times.

 Richard Roeper, a film critic who perhaps believes that most women look like Hollywood stars, muttered that showing plump gals baring too much skin was unsettling. 

 When were talking women in their underwear on billboards outside my living room windows, give me the fantasy babes, please, he wrote. 

 If that makes me sound superficial, shallow and sexist ? well yes, Im a man.

 The campaign has also provoked complaints that using overweight women as advertising role models could set the wrong example.

 Referring to the Dove campaign, Bill Zwecker, a presenter for CBS television, said: In this day and age, when we are facing a huge obesity problem in this country, we dont need to encourage anyone ? women or men ? to think its okay to be out of shape.

 Much of the campaigns shock value stems from the fact that most Americans have rarely seen ordinary women portrayed as attractive on television dramas or in Hollywood.

 As it seeks to help clients sell millions of dollars-worth of their products, however, the advertising industry is gambling that the time is right for a reality check. The Dove launch has coincided with a blitz by the sports company Nike which has been dubbed the big butt campaign.

 Featuring an oversized womans bottom clad in a pair of tight shorts, one advertisement says: My butt is big but thats just fine because those who scorn it are invited to kiss it. Nike says that the advertisements are a celebration of women and what is real as opposed to what a spokesman called the ideal.

 Julie Arko, a statuesque kindergarten teacher and one of Doves amateur models, happily admits on a company website that her favourite food is pizza and her favourite curves are: My butt and hips.

 Another of the real women, Gina Crisanti from Texas, hopes that the campaign will let American women embrace beautiful reality.

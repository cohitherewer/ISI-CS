 Killings put Israel truce under threat

 Gaza, April 9 (Reuters): A top leader of the Islamic Jihad militant group said today a de facto truce with Israel was still in force despite the killing of three Palestinian youths in circumstances disputed by Israeli forces and Palestinians.

 ?So far, the Palestinian factions have not declared an end to the calm... but they are studying the issue anew because of continued Zionist aggression,? Islamic Jihad chief Mohammed al-Hindi said.

 Earlier, a leader of a branch of Islamic Jihad, the Jerusalem Brigades, said militants were no longer bound by the truce.

 The Palestinian youths had been playing soccer in Rafah refugee camp in southern Gaza when Israeli soldiers across the border, metres away, shot and killed them, Palestinian medics said.

 Israeli military sources said troops spotted five Palestinians inching towards the Israel-Gaza border a number of times and fired at them after they failed to heed calls to stop.

 Rooftop raid nukes Blair energy speech

 London, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Anti-nuclear protesters staged a rooftop demonstration today in a hall where Prime Minister Tony Blair was due to launch a major review of Britains future energy needs, forcing him to deliver his speech elsewhere.

 Later, Blair put nuclear power back on the agenda today when he launched a review of energy policy, pledging to decide by the middle of next year on how to fill a looming energy gap.

 The Greenpeace protesters, dressed in suits to mix in with the business audience, clambered into the rafters of the conference centre shortly before Blair was due to speak, dropping leaflets, saying:Nuclear: Wrong Answer.

 Confederation of British Industry (CBI) chief Digby Jones refused a Greenpeace demand to allow them to speak before Blair ? or have their activists disrupt his delivery.

 He opened up a separate room with standing room only, for the Prime Minister to address his audience.

 Greenpeace director Stephen Tindale said: We think the country is the victim of a classic New Labour spin operation.

 The Prime Minister has made up his mind he wants nuclear power and he is trying to soften public opinion up.

 Several lawmakers in Blairs own Labour party are also known to be opposed to a major programme of new-generation nuclear power stations.

 Officials said Blair will tell the CBI employers group that in 15 years, the mothballing of old coal and nuclear stations will leave a big hole in Britains energy supply.

 Some of this will be replaced by renewables, but not all of it can, he will say.

 Government advisers and industry groups are urging new investment in nuclear power, not least because Britain will probably miss its greenhouse gas reduction goals without it.

 Critics say it will saddle Britain with nuclear waste that will have to be safeguarded for centuries.

 Blairs public statements up to now suggest he believes new nuclear power stations are probably needed. But his aides insist the government has not made up its mind.

 UN agency returns Pak nuke parts

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Aug. 29: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has returned the outdated components of Pakistani centrifuges after inspection.

 With the completion of necessary tests by the IAEA, we have no further role to play, foreign office spokesman Naeem Khan said at his weekly press briefing in Islamabad today.

 Pakistan had sent the components to the nuclear watchdog agency in April for a detailed analysis to find out whether Islamabad had any role in the development of Tehrans nuclear weapons programme.

 We have cooperated with the IAEA on a voluntary basis by sending experts with some outdated components of the centrifuges, Khan said. He added that the discussions between the officials focused on the results of tests conducted by the agency.

 Brown wins ruling

 Dan Brown: Work of God

 New York, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Best-selling author Dan Brown has won a court ruling against another writer who claimed Browns book The Da Vinci Code copied elements from two of his books, Browns publisher, Random House, said yesterday.

 Brown avoided $150 million in damages author Lewis Perdue had sought in a legal ruling that characterised Browns blockbuster book as an intellectual work.

 Perdue had claimed Browns 2003 book The Da Vinci Code, which has 36 million copies in print worldwide, infringed the copyright of his novels Daughter of God, which was published in 2000, and The Da Vinci Legacy, which came out in 1983.

 Perdue sought $150 million in damages and asked the court to block distribution of the book and a movie of The Da Vinci Code that is in production by Sony Pictures. Tom Hanks and French actor Audrey Tautou star in the film.

 He alleged that Brown copied the basic premise of Daughter of God, including notions of a divine feminine and the transition from a female to a male-dominated church under Roman Emperor Constantine.

 Perdue said he would appeal the ruling within 30 days.

 I have no doubt that were going to see this overturned on appeal because there have been copyright infringement cases where the parties had less to go on than we have and they were able to have their cases overturned, he said.

 Perdue said he read Browns book after getting unsolicited e-mails from readers pointing out the similarities in their works.

 The Da Vinci Code has been condemned by the Roman Catholic Church because the plot is based on the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had children, whose descendants have endured to the present day.

 Perdues book Daughter of God is an art-world thriller featuring an American husband and wife and involving a document that tells the story of a second Messiah named Sophia who lived in the fourth century. 

 Judge George Daniels of US district court in New York made a detailed analysis of the plots of the two books, as well as Perdues earlier work,The Da Vinci Legacy, which shares some elements with his later novel.

 Bold book

 London (Reuters): An 1892 book that predicted bullet trains, 

driverless golf carts, televisions and digital watches sold for ?1,200 at auction 

on Saturday. Its author, Scottish professional golfer Jack McCullogh, also predicted 

women would start dressing like men and do all the work while the menfolk took 

to the golf courses full-time. His book, Golf in the Year 2000 or What Are 

We Coming To by McCullogh under the pseudonym J.A.C.K., was bought by James 

Espinola, an American collector. ?This book is a cross between Nostradamus and 

the tale of Rip van Winkle because the main character goes to sleep on March 24, 

1892, and wakes up on March 25, 2000, to find all these amazing changes,? a spokesman 

of auction house Lyon amp; Turnbull said.

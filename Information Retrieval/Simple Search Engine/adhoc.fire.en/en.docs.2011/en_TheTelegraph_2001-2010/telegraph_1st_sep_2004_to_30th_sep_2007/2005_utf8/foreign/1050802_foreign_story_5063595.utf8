 Bush evades Senate to confirm Bolton post

 John Bolton

 Washington, Aug. 1 (Reuters): President George W. Bush bypassed the Senate and appointed John Bolton as US ambassador to the UN today over protests by Senate Democrats that the combative critic of the world body would hurt US credibility.

 Bush installed Bolton in a subdued White House Roosevelt Room ceremony with the mustachioed Bolton beside him and secretary of state Condoleezza Rice standing nearby.

 This post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about UN reform. So today, Ive used my constitutional authority to appoint John Bolton as Americas ambassador to the UN, Bush said.

 Bush bypassed the Senate confirmation process after it became clear he would not be able to overcome Democrats who held up the nomination of the outspoken conservative for months on charges he tried to manipulate intelligence and intimidated intelligence analysts to support his hawkish views as the top US diplomat for arms control.

 The US Senate held thorough confirmation hearings and a majority of United States senators agree that he is the right man for the job. Yet, because of partisan delaying tactics by a handful of senators, John was unfairly denied the up-or-down vote that he deserves, Bush said.

 Bolton will be able to serve until January 2007, when a new Congress is sworn in. Bush gave Bolton a recess appointment, taking advantage of a loophole that allows him to make such appointments when Congress is in recess.

 Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy called Bushs move an abuse of power. Its a devious manoeuver that evades the constitutional requirement of Senate consent and only further darkens the cloud over Boltons credibility at the UN, he said.

 Bush has been insistent that Bolton has the type of personality to pursue reforms at the UN and wants to get him into office to prepare for the UN General Assembly in September. 

 Taking the podium after Bush spoke, Bolton said he was prepared to work tirelessly. It will be a distinct privilege to be an advocate for Americas values and interests at the UN,, Bolton said.

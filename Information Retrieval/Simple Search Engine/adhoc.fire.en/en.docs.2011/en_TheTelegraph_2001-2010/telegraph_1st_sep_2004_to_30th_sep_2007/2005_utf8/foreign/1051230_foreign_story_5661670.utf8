 Last nail in stem-cell scandal

 Hwang: Telling tales?

 Seoul, Dec. 29 (Reuters): A South Korean panel dealt a devastating blow to discredited scientist Hwang Woo-Suk today, concluding that his once-celebrated team provided no data to prove a claim they had produced tailored embryonic stem cells.

 The findings deepened the disgrace of a man once heralded as a national hero for his pioneering work on stem cell and cloning research, who now faces possible criminal charges.

 The panel will also review Hwangs 2004 paper on creating the first cloned human embryos for research and a claim he produced the worlds first cloned dog, an Afghan hound named Snuppy.

 It is the panels judgement that Professor Hwangs team does not have the scientific data to prove that they (patient-specific stem cells) were made, Roe Jung-Hye, chief of Seoul National Universitys research office, said.

 The same investigation panel said last week that a 2005 paper produced by Hwangs team contained data that was deliberately fabricated and had undermined the fundamentals of science.

 It said the team may have produced only two stem cell lines, not 11 as the authors of the landmark paper had claimed.

 Roe told reporters the final two lines, which could have proved the fundamental findings of Hwangs team, were not produced in Hwangs laboratory but at a Seoul hospital.

 The findings of three labs showed the number two and number three stem cell lines that needed confirmation with regard to the 2005 paper did not match with patient tissue cells and were found to be fertilised-egg stem cells of MizMedi Hospital, Roe said.

 The panel has asked three laboratories to conduct DNA tests on cells that were part of work by Hwangs team to see if they were stem cell lines with DNA that matches that of the donors.

 Hwang has been in seclusion for almost a week and did not offer any comment.

 Experts say the stem cell case is fast developing into one of the biggest scientific frauds in recent history: the next questions will be how Hwangs team was able to pull it off and exactly how many people were involved. 

 An official with the Seoul prosecutors office said a criminal investigation would probably be launched after the university panel reaches a final conclusion in January.

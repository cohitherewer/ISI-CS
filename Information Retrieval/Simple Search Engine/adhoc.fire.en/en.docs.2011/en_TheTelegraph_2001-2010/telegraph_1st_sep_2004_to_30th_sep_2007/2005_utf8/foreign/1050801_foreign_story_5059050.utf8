 Pak court glare on new law

 Islamabad, July 31 (Reuters): A move by hardline Islamists to introduce what critics say amounts to a Taliban-style justice system in Pakistans North West Frontier Province will come under the scrutiny of the countrys Supreme Court tomorrow.

 The controversy over the Hasba (accountability) bill is the latest episode of a long struggle between moderates and religious conservatives for control of Pakistans future.

 The issue has blown up amid a recent government crackdown on militants, Islamist activists and firebrand preachers which has netted more than 600 suspects in the past two weeks. Diplomats in Islamabad say President Pervez Musharrafs handling of the bill will show how serious he is about containing and rolling back the religious Right.

 Relations between Musharraf and the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an alliance of religious opposition parties, has soured in the past year. He filed a petition in the Supreme Court for an opinion of the bill after Islamists rushed it through the provincial assembly in Peshawar earlier this month.

 The governor of Frontier province, which borders Afghanistan, will have to wait for the courts observations ? notably on whether the bill breaches Pakistans constitution ? before deciding whether he should sign it into law.

 The bill envisages a Hasba department headed by Islamic clerics, which critics say is modelled on the Talibans department of promotion of virtue and prevention of vice.

 Before the Taliban were driven from power in late 2001, religious police roamed Afghan streets, forcing people to pray, ensuring women did not leave home without a head-to-toe burqa, confronting men who did not have long beards.

 The Hasba bill sets out powers for religious police to ensure observance of Islamic practices and values while curbing activities and customs deemed un-Islamic.

 But Musharraf has said that the proposed law would take away peoples freedom.

 Speaking at a public rally in Frontier provinces Swat valley yesterday, he urged people to reject extremist forces. 

 The News daily quoted him as saying his government would not allow any legislation which was unconstitutional, which maligned Islam or which was harmful for the country.

 The Islamists deny they will use force to make people follow Islamic practices, but instead would use persuasion.

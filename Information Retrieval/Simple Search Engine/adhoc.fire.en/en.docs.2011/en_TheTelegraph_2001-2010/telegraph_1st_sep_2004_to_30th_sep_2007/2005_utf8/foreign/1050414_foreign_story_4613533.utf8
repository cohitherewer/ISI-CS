 Piracy students

 Washington, April 13 (Reuters): Record label and movie studio investigators said yesterday they plan to sue more than 400 college students who used a special high-speed network to copy songs and movies.

 Broadband networks made college campuses hotbeds of illegal copying, but students now use an even faster network known as Internet2, trade groups for the two industries said.

 Designed for academic research, Internet2?s extremely fast speed allows users to download a movie in five minutes or a song in less than 20 seconds. 

 Existing cable or DSL broadband networks usually take an hour to download a movie and two minutes to download a song. 

 ?Internet2 is increasingly becoming the network of choice for students looking to steal songs and other copyrighted works on a massive scale,? said Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Association of America.

 Those targeted in the lawsuits made an average of 3,900 files available for copying over the network, Sherman said.

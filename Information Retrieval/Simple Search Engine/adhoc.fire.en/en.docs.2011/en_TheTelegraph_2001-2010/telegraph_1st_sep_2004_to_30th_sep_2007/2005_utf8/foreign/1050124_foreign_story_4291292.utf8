 Kylie in row over royalties

 Kylie Minogue: Sour note

 Sydney, Jan. 23 (AFP): Pop diva Kylie Minogue has launched legal action against legendary British record producer Peter Waterman alleging underpaid royalties, a report said today.

 Minogue launched the action in her home city of Melbourne against Waterman?s company Pal Productions claiming hundreds of thousands of Australian dollars are due to her, the Sun-Herald said.

 Waterman was part of the legendary trio of Stock Aitken Waterman which has produced many of the biggest hit singles ever and which launched Minogue?s recording career outside Australia in 1988.

 The song they wrote for her, I should be so lucky, was recorded the same day she met them at their London studio and quickly topped the British charts, the newspaper said.

 Two years ago Minogue?s family firm KDB Pty. Ltd hired De la Haye Royalty Service to examine the books of Waterman?s company, which reported back that Minogue had been underpaid by more than 10 per cent, or more than $831,000. Pal subsequently paid Minogue?s company a further $645,000, but papers have now been lodged at the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars more.

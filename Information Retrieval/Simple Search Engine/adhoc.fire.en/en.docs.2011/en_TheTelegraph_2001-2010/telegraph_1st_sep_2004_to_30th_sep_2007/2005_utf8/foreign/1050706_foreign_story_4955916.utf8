 NRI family killers get life terms in grim trial

London, July 5: One of most macabre murder trials in British criminal history ended today when an Old Bailey judge sentenced three Englishmen to life in prison for wiping out an entire Indian family ? and told two of them they will never come out.

 Kenneth Regan, 55, and his two accomplices, William Horncy, 52, and Peter Rees, 39, murdered Amarjit Chohan, 45, in February, 2003, so that they could steal his flourishing freight company in west London and use it as a front for drug running.

 To make it appear the family had sold up and moved abroad, the three gangsters also murdered Chohans wife, Nancy, 25, and his mother-in-law, Charanjit Kaur, 51.

 What makes this case unique is that the gang did not spare Chohans children, Devinder, 18 months, and Ravinder, two months.

 Judge Sir Stephen Mitchell imposed a whole life tariff on Regan and Horncy and said this meant they had no prospect of release.

 What Regan had not understood was the way in which Indian families work. Chohans brother-in-law Onkar Verma who lives in New Zealand, immediately knew something was wrong when told his mother and sister had simply gone away. He flew to London and harangued the police into opening their investigation.

 Despite a 10-month trial, one of the longest in Britain, costing ?10 million, the gangsters have not disclosed how their victims were killed. The bodies were initially buried in a field but when the police closed in on the area, they were removed and tossed out at sea. All but the bodies of the children then washed up and were recovered, although badly decomposed. It seems unlikely now that the remains of the children will ever be found.

 Since the men were convicted last week, they faced mandatory life sentences anyway. Interest centred on whether the judge would impose a tariff ? a minimum period before parole could be considered. 

 Also, for parole to be possible, the convicted have to confess to their crimes, which none of these men has done.

 Your crimes are uniquely terrible, Judge Mitchell said. The cold-blooded murders of an eight-week-old baby and an 18-month-old toddler, not to mention the murders of their mother, father and grandmother, provide a chilling insight into the utterly perverted standards by which you have lived your lives.

 He went on: Your characters are as despicable as your crimes. Each of you is a practised, resourceful and manipulative liar. For these crimes, you two highly dangerous men must now pay the heaviest sentence.

 Neither Regan nor Horncy, career criminals with a long history of violent crime, showed any emotion as they were taken down. The judge told them: The misery, pain and suffering which the two of you have visited on the surviving members of Mr and Mrs Chohans family are immeasurable ? not least because of the contemptible treatment of the bodies of their relatives and not least because the bodies of those two tiny children have never been recovered.The judge accepted Rees was not the planner but his crimes were still of the utmost gravity.

 Speaking outside court, detective chief inspector Dave Little, who led the investigation, said it was the worst crime he had ever dealt with.Three generations of a family were murdered, he said. I cannot see any family ever recovering from that. Their crimes were terrible. They have shown no remorse, no conscience. It was the worst crime I have dealt with. They are despicable, they have murdered people, they have done so in a cold-blooded way and they are career criminals. I cannot think of words to describe them.

 By killing children, the Regan gang has broken an unwritten rule that is observed by even the most hardened of criminals. They will have to be isolated in prison if they are to escape retaliation by fellow prisoners who will be out to get them for breaking the code by which the underworld lives.

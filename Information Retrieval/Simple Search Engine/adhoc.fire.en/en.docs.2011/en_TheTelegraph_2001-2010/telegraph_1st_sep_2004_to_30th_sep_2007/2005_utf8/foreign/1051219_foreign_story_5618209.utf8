 Cuba let go of chance to needle America

 Havana, Dec. 18 (Reuters): American anti-torture activists who marched through south-eastern Cuba to protest the detention of terror suspects at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay had to settle last week for a prayer vigil five miles away.

 Cubas communist government did not allow the 25 members of the Catholic Worker movement to march to the gates of the US military enclave and demand access to the prisoners.

 Instead of jumping at the chance to embarrass its foe, Cuba preferred to avoid an incident in the no-mans land of barbed wire and mines surrounding the 45-square-mile base. Its a very sensitive zone where two enemy armies have faced each other for four decades, a Cuban official said.

 The Guantanamo detention camp, where some 500 suspected al Qaida and Taliban fighters are being held, has been termed the gulag of our time by critics. President Fidel Castro has for long railed against the US presence in Guantanamo.

 But on the ground, the Cuban and American military cooperate through daily telephone contacts in securing the perimeter of the base. 

 The Cuban military is just loath to have any kind of incidents on that trench line that could result in a heated event, said a former CIA analyst.

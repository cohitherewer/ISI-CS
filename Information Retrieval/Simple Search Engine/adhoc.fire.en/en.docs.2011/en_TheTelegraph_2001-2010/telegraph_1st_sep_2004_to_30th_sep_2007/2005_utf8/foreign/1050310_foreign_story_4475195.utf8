 Massacre graves surface in Iraq 

 Baghdad, March 9 (Reuters): 

 Police found the bodies of 41 Iraqis beheaded or shot by 

 insurgents at two sites in Qaim, 500 km west of Baghdad, 

 the latest in a series of mass killings by guerrilla groups.

 In Qaim, the bodies of 26 people, including one woman, were found. A doctor said the victims, in civilian clothes, had been shot two days ago.

 Fifteen bodies ? some shot, others beheaded ? were found just south of Baghdad in the Sunni-dominated area now known as the ?triangle of death?, Iraqi army sources said.

 Insurgents have frequently dumped large numbers of bodies in public places as a warning to others. The victims are usually police, soldiers or Iraqis working with the US military. 

 A doctor at Qaim hospital said a police identification document was found on one of the corpses. 

 Suicide bombing

 A suicide bomber in a garbage truck packed with explosives killed two policemen near a Baghdad hotel today.

 Al Qaida?s wing in Iraq, led by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said it carried out the Baghdad attack that wounded at least 20 others ? part of its relentless campaign to bring down the government and drive out US troops.

 Mainly Sunni insurgents have kept up a campaign of suicide attacks, car bombings and execution-style killings, denting Iraqi and US officials? hopes that landmark January 30 elections would help stabilise the country.

 Their ranks have been boosted by frustration at the US occupation, a growing number of shootings of Iraqi civilians and by abuse of prisoners in US-manned jails.

 ?Our brother Karim ibn al-Karim bin al-Karim, along with a group of mujahideen, targeted... what should be called the hotel of the Jews because it is their safe-haven and stronghold,? al Qaida Organisation for Holy War in Iraq said in a statement posted on an Islamic website.

 ?The mujahideen opened fire on the police and guards protecting the Jews and when the entrance was clear, the hero... blew up the infidels,? the group said, adding that the attack was timed to avoid harming any Muslim passers-by.

 An Iraqi militant group, Islamic Army in Iraq, posted an Internet video showing two Sudanese hostages urging other drivers in Iraq not to work with occupation forces.

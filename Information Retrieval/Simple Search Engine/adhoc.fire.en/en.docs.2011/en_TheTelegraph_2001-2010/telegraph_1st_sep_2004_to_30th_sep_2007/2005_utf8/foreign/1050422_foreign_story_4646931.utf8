 Antarctic glaciers in retreat

 London, April 21 (Reuters): Most of the glaciers on the Antarctic peninsula are in headlong retreat because of climate change, a leading scientist said today.

 An in-depth study using aerial photographs spanning the past half-century of all 244 marine glaciers on the west side of the finger-like peninsular pointing up to South America found that 87 per cent of them were in retreat ? and the speed was rising.

 ?Regional warming is the strongest single factor in this retreat, and there is growing evidence that this is due to global warming,? scientist David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) told a news conference.

 ?The peninsular could end up looking like the Alps if the glaciers retreat far enough from the sea,? he said.

 Fellow BAS researcher Alison Cook, who spent three years studying thousands of old aerial photographs, said they clearly showed a general glacial retreat which had accelerated sharply in the past five years. 

 Scientists have noted before the shrinkage and breakup of some of Antarctica?s giant sea ice shelves, but the new study is the first comprehensive look at the state of the glaciers that flow into the sea. 

 A retreat is when the position of a glacier is farther up than before. Scientists have predicted that global temperatures could rise by up to two degrees Celsius this century.

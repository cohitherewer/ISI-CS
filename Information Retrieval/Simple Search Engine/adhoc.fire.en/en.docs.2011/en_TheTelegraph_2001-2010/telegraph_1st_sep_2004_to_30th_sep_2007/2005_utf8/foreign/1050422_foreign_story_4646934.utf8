 Blair grilled by 20-year-old

 London, April 21: Tony 

 Blair was given a dressing down yesterday by a young Labour 

 supporter who told him of the sense of disappointment and 

 betrayal felt by those who had voted for him.

 Jessica Haigh, 20, told the Prime Minister that her family were all staunch Labour supporters but had ?lost faith? in the party. Haigh, a creative writing student at Leeds University, said: ?In 1997, I was 11 and we were so happy when you got in and now all our family?s trust in your party has gone.

 ?It is so heartbreaking when you work so long to get a Labour government in power and then they turn into a Conservative one.?

 The encounter in a Leeds shopping centre was Blair?s least stage-managed meeting with the public since the election campaign began.

 Haigh told him that she was disillusioned over issues ranging from the Iraq war to globalisation and spin.

 ?My dad was a Labour county councillor but he lost faith in the party and I am going to vote Liberal Democrat,? she said. Mick Haigh, her father, who was Labour group leader on North Yorkshire county council, said: ?I am proud of her. Some senior Labour members should have done the same long ago.?

 Haigh, 51, was the election agent for the current Scarborough MP, Lawrie Quinn, when the party took the seat from the Conservatives in 1997.

 He and his wife, Lynne, from Scarborough, have two daughters ? Jessica, and Poppy, 16 ? and hold traditional socialist values.

 Haigh joined the party at 15 and served on the county council and police authority for eight years until he resigned in 2001 in protest at the direction the party had taken.

 He said: ?We spent a long time trying to get a Labour government in and instead we have a government in with George Bush rather than the rest of the world.?

 When Blair warned Haigh that if she voted Liberal Democrat it could let the Conservatives back into power, she replied: ?I know, that?s the scary thing.?

 Sun backs PM

 Britain?s top-selling daily newspaper The Sun said yesterday it backed Tony Blair for re-election as Prime Minister, a message that is important to parties because of the big influence the paper has.

 Kylie to rock at British fest

 Kylie Minogue

 London, April 11 (Reuters): Kylie Minogue, Coldplay and the White Stripes are among headline acts at this year?s Glastonbury music festival, organisers said today.

 Alongside them on the main pyramid stage will be a mix of old favourites and new talent ranging from Elvis Costello to the Zutons, Ash and The Undertones. Also playing at the three-day event will be Bloc Party, Fatboy Slim and Echo And The Bunnymen. 

 Over the years, the stars who have appeared at the festival, renowned for mud and merriment in the Somerset countryside, has read like a Who?s Who of late 20th century music.

 The 112,000 tickets for this year?s June 24-26 festival, have sold out and organisers said security checks including photo ID will be thorough.

 In addition to the increased moves to stop fake tickets, the festival will also feature a ?silent disco? in an effort to sidestep a noise curfew. Instead of DJs blasting their sounds through speakers, thousands of revellers partying past midnight at the open-air music event will be given wire-free headphones with volume controls that directly tune in to a stereo system.

 The idea is one of several introduced in recent years to improve relations with local villagers. A giant ?super-fence? was erected around the site in 2002 to cut down on crime and foil gatecrashers.

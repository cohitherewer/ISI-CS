 Singlish rap for broadcaster

 Singapore, July 26 (AP): Singapores monopoly broadcaster has been criticised for substandard levels of programming and widespread use of a mutated form of English, known locally as Singlish.

 The Programmes Advisory Committee urged Mediacorp, the countrys only free-to-air broadcaster, to improve the quality and content of its programming.

 Proper standards of English should be maintained. Singlish should be avoided in broadcast programmes, it said in a statement yesterday.

 The call comes just over two months after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged Singaporeans to reduce the use of Singlish, a widely used mishmashed version of English.

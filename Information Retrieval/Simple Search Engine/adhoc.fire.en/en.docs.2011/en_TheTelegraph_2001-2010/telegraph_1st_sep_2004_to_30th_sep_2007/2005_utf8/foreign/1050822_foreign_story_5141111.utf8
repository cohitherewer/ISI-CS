 Fatah gunmen in job challenge

 Gaza, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Palestinians from the ruling Fatah party armed with assault rifles converged on the Gaza parliament building today to demand jobs in a protest that underlined challenges ahead for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

 Abbas has vowed to crack down on worsening internal lawlessness and faces pressure to rein in militants during Israels pullout from the occupied Gaza Strip in order to maintain stability and advance peacemaking efforts.

 But he has shied from direct confrontations with gunmen.

 At least 200 al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades gunmen, most dressed in black, demanded jobs while accusing officials of corruption. Some fired into the air. The protesters came close to scuffles with police before commanders on both sides ordered calm.

 They then dispersed.

 We are here only to send a message that Fatah fighters should be treated fairly. Jobs should be secured for those who made dear sacrifices, said Abu Jihad, a spokesman. He complained that jobs were given to those who did not deserve them while the fighters were forgotten.

 One al-Aqsa protester said through a loudspeaker: We are not here to beg anybody. We are here to seek our fair rights.

 Abbas is under pressure to ensure a smooth pullout ?Israels first removal of settlements from land Palestinians want for a state. But he has struggled to stop internal chaos. His Fatah party has been under fire over accusations of graft, mismanagement and a loss of control over its armed factions.

 Abbas, elected in January to replace Yasser Arafat, vowed during his presidential campaign to boost employment and give jobs to gunmen who fought Israeli forces in a Palestinian uprising that began in 2000. The jobs have yet to materialise.

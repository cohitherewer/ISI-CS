 Jail for Saudi reformists

 Riyadh, May 15 (Reuters): A Saudi court jailed three prominent reformists today for up to nine years for trying to sow dissent and challenge the royal family, dealing a blow to tentative reforms in the absolute monarchy.

 Judges at the Riyadh court, which was ringed by security forces, issued their verdict after a nine-month trial held mainly behind closed doors despite earlier promises of openness.

 The court sentenced academics Ali al-Dumaini to nine years in jail, Abdullah al-Hamed to seven years and Matruk al-Faleh to six years, lawyers said. All three were arrested in March 2004 after petitioning the kingdoms rulers to move towards a constitutional monarchy and speed up political reforms.

 Their arrest ? along with nine other men who were later released ? drew rare public criticism from the US which has pushed for reform in ally Saudi Arabia since the September 11 attacks, which were carried out by mainly Saudi hijackers.

 This is not fair, Falehs wife Jamila al-Ukla said after the sentences. Her husband supportedthe centrality of the royal family, the country and Islam, she said. (To call for) constitutional monarchy is not a criminal issue.

 Lawyer Ali Ghothami said the men would appeal the ruling. Ghothami said the panel of three judges found that the men had overstepped the bounds by talking to foreign media, had ignored national interests, intended to incite people and gave a chance to the nations enemies to harm it.

 They were also convicted of defaming officials and challenging the independence of the judiciary. 

 Specifically the judges cited Falehs criticism of Saudi Arabias education system, which he blamed for two years of violence by al Qaida supporters, Ghothami said.

 Dumaini had incited (people) against the Wahhabi school of Islam in Saudi Arabia, which critics blame for fostering anti-Western sentiment and militancy. Hamed had challenged the authority of the ruler, according to the court.

 Sharon, Abbas to meet soon

 Jerusalem, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas today agreed to meet soon and improve cooperation as Israel suspended an offensive after a halt to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.

 Their first telephone conversation in over five weeks could help put peacemaking back on track after a surge in violence damaged hopes stirred by Israels withdrawal from Gaza last month, which ended 38 years of military rule there. 

 Abbas called Sharon with greetings for the Jewish New Year, which starts at sundown tomorrow. Sharon expressed best wishes for the Muslim holy month of Ramazan, starting this week.

 Hours after his conversation with Sharon, Abbas faced new conflict on the home front, where Palestinian police traded fire with Hamas militants in Gaza City, wounding five people and killing a policeman, medics and witnesses said.

 Palestinian police were placed on high alert after some of the worst internal fighting since Israel withdrew its army from Gaza.

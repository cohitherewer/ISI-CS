 Landslide win gives Mubarak fifth term

 Cairo, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak won a fifth six-year term in office with 88.6 per cent of votes cast in the countrys first multi-candidate presidential election, the official in charge said today.

 The turnout was only 23 per cent, Mamdouh Marei, chairman of the Presidential Election Commission, said.

 Rights groups have complained of widespread voting abuses in the elections on Wednesday, in which Mubarak faced nine rivals. Mubaraks victory was widely expected. 

 Mubaraks main rival, Ayman Nour of the liberal Ghad (Tomorrow) Party, won 7.6 per cent of the vote and Wafd Party candidate Noman Gomaa was third with 2.9 per cent.

 A big surprise was the low turnout figure. When Mubarak won his fourth six-year term by referendum in 1999, the government said 79 per cent of registered voters took part. Judges and monitoring groups say the authorities have inflated heavily the turnout figures in past votes and often less than 10 per cent of people really voted.

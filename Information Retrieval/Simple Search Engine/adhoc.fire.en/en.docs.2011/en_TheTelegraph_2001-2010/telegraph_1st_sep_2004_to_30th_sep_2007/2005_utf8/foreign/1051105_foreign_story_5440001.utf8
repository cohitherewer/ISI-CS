 Maoist talks alarm US

 J HEMANTH 

 Gyanendra: Timely boost

 Kathmandu, Nov. 4: Alarmed over the recent attempts by Nepali political parties to bring the Maoists on a common platform against King Gyanendra, the US today warned the seven-party alliance against forming any union with the rebels. 

 In a statement issued in Kathmandu today, the US embassy referred to Nepali media reports on the possibility of an alliance between the parties and the rebels. It said any such eventuality would be harmful to Nepals interests. 

 The US notes that the parties in the past have said that they would not enter into any formal relationship with the Maoists, unless and until the Maoists firmly renounce violence, put down their weapons and commit to supporting the democratic process. 

 Despite declaring a three-month ceasefire in September, the Maoists have done nothing to indicate that they are prepared to abandon violence in the long term, and abductions and extortion continue unabated, the statement said. 

 It added that the US, which supports the restoration of democracy in Nepal and the prevention of a Maoist takeover, believes the best way to reach these goals is through the union of Nepals legitimate political forces ? the political parties and the monarchy. We urge both to re-establish an effective working relationship to lead Nepal out of its current crisis, and to work towards a democratic and peaceful future for the country and its people, the statement said. 

 The statement comes after reports that the parties, especially the CPN (UML) and Nepali Congress, have made progress in convincing the Maoists to join their struggle for restoration of democracy. 

 Recently, the seven-party alliance named CPN (UML) general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal and Nepali Congress supremo G. P. Koirala to hold talks with the rebels.

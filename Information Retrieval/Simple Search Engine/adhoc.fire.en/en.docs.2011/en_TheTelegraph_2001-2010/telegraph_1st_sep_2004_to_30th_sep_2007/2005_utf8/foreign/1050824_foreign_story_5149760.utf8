 Bangla militants threaten strikes

 Dhaka, Aug. 23 (Reuters): A banned Islamic militant group blamed for hundreds of bomb blasts last week across Bangladesh has threatened to strike again unless the government introduces Islamic rule in the impoverished country.

 If Dhaka authorities failed to establish Islamic law or tried to arrest any member of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, (we) will take direct action, the group said in a statement on the website jihadunspun.com.

 Everybody is the enemy of Islam who wants to launch democracy as an institutional form, said the English-language statement seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

 Therefore we invite the ruling party and also the opposition to initiate the rule of Islam within a short time in Bangladesh.

 Two people were killed and about 100 injured when hundreds of home-made bombs exploded simultaneously across the country last Wednesday, triggering an unprecedented security alarm among Bangladeshs 140 million people, most of whom are Muslims.

 No individual or group has so far claimed responsibility for the bombings but copies of a leaflet found at most of the blast sites carried a call by the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen to impose Islamic rule on democratic secular Bangladesh.

 The leaflet also warned the US and Britain against occupation of Muslim nations.

 There was no immediate government comment on the latest threat by Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, which it banned in February.

 Security forces launched a nationwide hunt after the serial blasts, detaining more than 150 suspects.

 But the widely circulated Dainik Ittefaq and Dainik Sangbad newspapers quoted police sources as saying that Shayek Abdur Rahman, the spiritual leader of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen ? who they said masterminded the bombings ? had since fled the country along with 16 associates.

 Bangladeshs top police officer, inspector-general M. Abdul Quayyum, was unavailable for comment on the newspaper reports, despite several calls to his office.

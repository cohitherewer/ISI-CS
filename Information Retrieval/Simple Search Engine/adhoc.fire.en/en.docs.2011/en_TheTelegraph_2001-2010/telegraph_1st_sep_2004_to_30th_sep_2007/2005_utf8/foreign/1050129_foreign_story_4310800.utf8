 Cheney?s parka stands out at grim Auschwitz

 ROBIN GIVHAN

 Washington, Jan. 28: At yesterday?s gathering of world leaders in southern Poland to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the US was represented by vice-president Cheney. 

 The ceremony at the Nazi death camp was outdoors, so those in attendance, such as French President Jacques Chirac and Russian President Vladimir Putin, were wearing dark, formal overcoats and dress shoes or boots. 

 In short, they were dressed for the inclement weather as well as the sobriety and dignity of the event. 

 The vice-president, however, was dressed in the kind of attire one typically wears to operate a snow blower.

 Cheney stood out in a sea of black-coated world leaders because he was wearing an olive drab parka with a fur-trimmed hood. It was embroidered with his name. It reminded one of the way in which children?s clothes are inscribed with their names before they are sent away to mountain camps. And indeed, the vice-president looked like an awkward boy amid the well-dressed adults.

 Like other attendees, the vice-president was wearing a hat. But it was not a fedora or a Stetson or a fur hat or any kind of hat that one might wear to a memorial service as the representative of one?s country. 

 Instead, it was a knit ski cap, embroidered with the words: ?Staff 2001.? 

 It is also worth mentioning that Cheney was wearing hiking boots ? thick, brown, lace-up ones. Did he think he was going to have to hike the 44 miles from Krakow ? where he had made remarks earlier in the day ? to Auschwitz? 

 His wife, Lynne, was seated next to him. Her coat had a hood, too, and it was essentially a parka. But it was black and did not appear to be functioning as either a name tag or a billboard.

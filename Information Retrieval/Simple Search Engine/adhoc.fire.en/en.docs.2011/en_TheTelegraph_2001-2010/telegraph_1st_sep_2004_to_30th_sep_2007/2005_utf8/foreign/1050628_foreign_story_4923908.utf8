 Dr Death informer feared losing job

 Sydney, June 27 (Reuters): An Australian nurse feared she could be sacked or prosecuted when she repeatedly tried to warn authorities about an Indian-born surgeon dubbed Dr Death, who has been linked to the deaths of 87 patients.

 Jayant Patel, who was banned from surgery in two US states, left Australia in March after he was linked to the deaths at Bundaberg Hospital in Queensland state in 2003-04, when he was head of surgery at the hospital.

 Toni Hoffman, Bundaberg hospitals head intensive care nurse, said today she had raised concerns with health, nursing and hospital officials, as well as the state coroner and police, before an internal audit was finally ordered.

 She said officials told her they would not release the results of the audit and Patel was named employee of the month soon after. 

 The hospital paid for his airfare to leave Australia, media have reported, before authorities began to take seriously claims against Patel, who could face murder, negligence and fraud charges if he returns. Patel is believed to be in the US. 

 Hoffman said she had spoken to police, the Queensland coroner and up to 12 other officials about patient deaths before she went to a state lawmaker and authorities began to take her seriously.

 She said doctors at the hospital and others had warned her about speaking against Patel even after he left. One of the senior doctors came into my office and said to me:Youll be lucky to keep your job after this, Hoffman said.

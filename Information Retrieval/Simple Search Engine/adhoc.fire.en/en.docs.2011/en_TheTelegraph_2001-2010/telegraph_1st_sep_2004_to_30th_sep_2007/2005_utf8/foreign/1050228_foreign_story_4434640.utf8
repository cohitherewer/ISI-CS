 Sharon threatens peace pause

 Jerusalem, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon today said Israel was escalating military measures and would freeze peace efforts after a Tel Aviv suicide bombing unless Palestinians smashed militant groups.

 ?There will not be any diplomatic progress, I repeat, no diplomatic progress, until the Palestinians take vigorous action to wipe out the terror groups and their infrastructure in the Palestinian Authority?s territory,? Sharon said.

 Addressing his cabinet in forceful tones Sharon said that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas?s ?immediate test? was to act against Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for the first deadly Palestinian attack in Israel since November.

 Later Sharon went a step further by saying Israel was already going ahead with military steps after the bombing outside a night club in Tel Aviv shattered a truce that he and Abbas had declared at a February 8 summit in Egypt.

 ?We are stepping up our operations against terror,? he told colleagues of his Rightist Likud Party in Tel Aviv.

 A senior official said Israel would also reconsider a promise to free 400 Palestinian prisoners in addition to 500 released last week in a deal with Abbas. 

 Sharon also told US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice that Abbas had not yet ?taken practical measures against terror and without active measures by the Palestinians there won?t be any movement to implementing,? a US-backed peace ?road map?.

 Palestinian information minister Ghassan al-Khatib said Sharon?s threats ?would be a recipe for more violence?.

 ?It?s Israel?s decision whether to freeze contacts,? Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie said earlier.

 ?We will not shed tears, but we say that after Sharm el-Sheikh there is a chance (for peace) and we would like to press ahead with this effort,? Qurie said.

 Al Arabiya 

 Syrian intelligence sent death threats to Al Arabiya television after it aired an interview with UN chief Kofi Annan in which he urged Syria to withdraw from Lebanon by April, a source at the station said.

 ?There were death threats against Arabiya?s staff in Beirut by the Syrians,? the source said, referring to Syrian intelligence.

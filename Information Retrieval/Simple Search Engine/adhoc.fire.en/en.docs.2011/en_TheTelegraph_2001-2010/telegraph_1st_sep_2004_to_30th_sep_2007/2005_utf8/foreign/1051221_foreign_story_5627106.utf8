 Jackson battles default 

 Los Angeles, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Lawyers for Michael Jackson and a key creditor are in talks to keep the pop star from defaulting on $200 million in loans secured by his prized stake in the Beatles song catalogue, an attorney for the singer said.

 A default on the loans, which are held by the Fortress Investment Group, would allow the New York private equity fund to seize Jacksons 50-per cent interest in Beatles publishing rights valued at some $500 million.

 The catalogue, containing more than 200 Beatles tunes that include such classics as Yesterday, is jointly owned by Jackson and Sony Corp through Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Jackson bought publishing rights to the catalogue for about $48 million two decades ago at the height of his career.

 Brent Ayscough, a civil lawyer for Jackson, said representatives for the 47-year-old entertainer and Fortress were working to renegotiate terms of the loans to give Jackson more time to avoid default.

 And he suggested that the possibility of imminent foreclosure on Jacksons stake in Sony/ATV was unlikely.

 Theres no doomsday, or anything like that, Ayscough said. Nothings going to happen tomorrow.... At the moment people are still talking. He said a deal could be reached as early as this week.

 He said Sony, which music industry experts believe is eager to acquire Jacksons share of the catalogue, also is a party to the talks.

 Representatives of Fortress, which manages about $5 billion in private equity capital, could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for Sony declined to discuss the matter.

 According to prosecution testimony during his sex-abuse trial earlier this year, Jackson had borrowed heavily against his assets, including $200 million secured by his stake in Sony/ATV. Those loans, first provided by Bank of America Corp, were later sold to Fortress.

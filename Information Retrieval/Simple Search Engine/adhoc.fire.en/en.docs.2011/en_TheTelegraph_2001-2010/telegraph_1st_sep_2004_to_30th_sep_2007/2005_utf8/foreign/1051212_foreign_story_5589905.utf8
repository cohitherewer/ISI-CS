 Phrases for fans

 Leipzig, Germany, Dec. 11 (Reuters): The British embassy in Germany has launched a new website for the 2006 World Cup that includes handy German phrases for England fans, such as He was sick as a parrot or He puked his guts up.

 The website, www.britishembassyworldcup.com, is designed to help the estimated 100,000 English fans expected to travel to Germany for the 32-team tournament that starts in Munich on June 9 and concludes with the July 9 final in Berlin. 

 Age record 

 London (Reuters): A 116-year-old Ecuadorean woman has been 

declared the oldest person in the world, lifting the title from a US woman previously 

thought to be the oldest person alive. Maria Esther Capovilla was confirmed as 

the oldest living person after her family sent details of her birth and marriage 

certificates to the Guinness Book of World Records. Shes in 

very good health, shes got good sight, is able to read the papers and watch 

TV, and doesnt walk with a stick, said Kate White, brand manager at 

the records publisher. 

 Dyke bike 

 San Francisco (Reuters): Lesbian motorcycle enthusiasts in San Francisco have won their fight to trademark the name Dykes on Bikes. The US Patent and Trademark Office had denied the phrase to be used, arguing it would be perceived as disparaging to lesbians. But the National Center for Lesbian Rights and the Brooke Oliver Law Group said the word dyke is no longer viewed as derogatory.

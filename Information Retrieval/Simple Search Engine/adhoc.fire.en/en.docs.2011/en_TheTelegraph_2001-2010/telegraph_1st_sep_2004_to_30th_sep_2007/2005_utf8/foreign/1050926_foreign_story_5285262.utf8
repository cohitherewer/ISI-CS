 Pearls put Cherie in tax trouble

 Cherie Blair: Duty problem

 London, Sept. 25 (PTI): Cherie Blair, wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, was involved in a new controversy after she was made to pay value added tax and import duty on expensive pearls she bought on foreign trips.

 According to a report in the Mail on Sunday, customs officials took action after it was revealed that she imported pearls and other jewellery on three trips to China in the past eight years. 

 Senior customs officers contacted Downing Street last week after establishing that she paid no VAT and import duty on them when she returned to Britain.

 According to the report, Chinese jewellers who had supplied her insisted that the true value of the items was at least ?15,000. 

 The report said she was forced to pay the full VAT and duty, though it is not known how much. However, the customs and excise department did not impose a fine, which can be applied if an individual has deliberately tried to avoid the levies.

 The source said Cherie Blair was then told that the matter was closed and no further action would be taken against her.

 Responding to the report, Cherie took the unusual step of authorising the customs and excise department to make a statement about the inquiry into her conduct.

 A customs and excise spokeswoman said: Customs inquired into the circumstances and as far as they are concerned there is nothing to investigate. On this occasion the individual gave consent for their right to confidentiality to be waived.

 It is understood that the reason the matter was closed is because the VAT and duty were paid retrospectively.

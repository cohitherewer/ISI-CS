 Barefoot 4-year-old lost in NY

 Valerie Lozada

 New York, Oct. 1 (AP): Nearly a week after a pigtailed four-year-old girl was found wandering barefoot on the streets of Queens, her mother has been identified and declared missing.

 The child, Valerie Lozada, remained in foster care while authorities tried to piece together her story, which she said began when her father woke her up one night, drove her to a dark street and left her alone. Using records from a Queens daycare centre, police identified the girls mother as 26-year-old Monica Rivadinerra Lozada.

 Valerie was found about 1 am on Sunday. Although she was walking alone and without shoes, she showed no outward signs of neglect or abuse. The little girl said her mothers name was Monica and that she had two fathers, one of whom dropped her off on the street.

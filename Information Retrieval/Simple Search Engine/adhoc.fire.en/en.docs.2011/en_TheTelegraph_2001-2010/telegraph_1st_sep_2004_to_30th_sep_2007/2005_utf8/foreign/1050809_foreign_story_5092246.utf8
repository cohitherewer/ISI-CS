 100,000 SA gold miners go on strike

 Johannesburg, Aug. 8 (Reuters): About 100,000 South African gold miners stayed off work today in the countrys first industry-wide strike in 18 years to demand higher wages in the worlds biggest bullion producer, their union said.

 The gold miners strike is the latest and biggest industrial action in recent weeks in a country plagued by huge income gaps between the rich and mostly black poor, more than a decade after the end of apartheid.

 The strike is 100 per cent countrywide, all our people, about 100,000 of them are on strike, Gwede Mantashe, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), said. The strike started across the country yesterday at 1600 GMT.

 South Africas gold industry accounts for around 15 per cent of total global output, and the mining sector contributes about 8 per cent to the nations gross domestic product.

 A strike would lead to the loss of around 28,000 ounces of gold production and $12.21 million in lost revenue per day, an analyst has estimated.

 Church signal by Rice

 Rice: Talking tough 

 Beijing, March 20 (Reuters) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice attended a church service in Beijing today in a visit that highlighted US concern for religious freedom in the world?s most populous country.

 The symbolic visit to one of China?s largest state-approved churches followed Rice?s repeated denouncements during a tour of Asia about Beijing?s human rights record, and particularly its restrictions on worship.

 But in a sign the public images contrasted with her behind-the-scenes diplomacy, Rice did not make religious freedom a priority in meetings with China?s top leaders on Sunday. Instead, she would discuss rights and democracy at a lower-level on Monday, a senior state department official said.

 Rice?s trip to China ? the last leg of a six-country tour across Asia ? came at an awkward time in Sino-US relations as the major powers are also at odds over Taiwan, Beijing?s rapid military buildup and North Korea?s nuclear ambitions.

 Just before flying to China, Rice made her sharpest criticism to-date of a European Union plan to lift an embargo on arms sales to Beijing at a time when tensions have been rising between China and Taiwan. The US has vowed to defend the island if China attacks what it regards as a renegade province.

 Rice has also warned that the US would not allow a stalemate over North Korea?s refusal to return to nuclear arms negotiations to go on forever.

 With US impatience rising over the stalled six-party negotiations, Rice also prodded China, North Korea?s biggest benefactor, to use more of its leverage to get Pyongyang back to the talks that have been on hold since June. ?It is true that we need to resolve this issue,? Rice said at a news conference in Seoul after talks with South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki-moon and President Roh Moo-hyun.

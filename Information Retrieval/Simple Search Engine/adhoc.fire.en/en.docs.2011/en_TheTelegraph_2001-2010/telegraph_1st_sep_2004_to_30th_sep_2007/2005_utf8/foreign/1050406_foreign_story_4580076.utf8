 Bells to ring in new Pope

 Vatican City, April 5 (Reuters): 

 The Vatican will ring the bells of St Peter?s when the next 

 Pope is chosen, as well as pouring the traditional white 

 smoke out of the Sistine Chapel, to avoid confusion over 

 whether a new pontiff has been elected.

 Cardinals tell the world they have picked a new pope by burning their voting sheets with an additive to make the smoke white. For the outcome of earlier, indecisive ballots, another additive is used to make the smoke black.

 ?The stove ritual will remain the same but we will try to make it work better than last time. The bells will also ring so that journalists have no doubts,? Archbishop Piero Marini, Vatican master of ceremonies, said today.

 At a 1978 conclave, the smoke signal system did not work properly and watchers were confused because the smoke was neither black nor white but grey. Cardinals will meet in a conclave, later this month to choose a successor to Pope John Paul.

 Gunman plea

 Turkish authorities today rejected a request from Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk who shot and gravely wounded Pope John Paul in 1981, to leave prison to attend the pontiffs funeral, his lawyer said.

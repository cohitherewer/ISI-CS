 Amnesty pins blame on US

 London, May 25 (Reuters): Four years after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, human rights are in retreat worldwide and the US bears most responsibility, Amnesty International said today.

 From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe the picture is bleak. Governments are increasingly rolling back the rule of law, taking their cue from the US-led war on terror, the rights watchdog said.

 The USA as the unrivalled political, military and economic hyper-power sets the tone for governmental behaviour worldwide, secretary general Irene Khan said in the foreword to Amnesty Internationals 2005 annual report.

 When the most powerful country in the world thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights, it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity, she added.

 London-based Amnesty cited the pictures last year of abuse of detainees at Iraqs US-run Abu Ghraib prison, which it said were never adequately investigated, and the detention without trial of enemy combatants at the US naval base in Cuba.

 The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay has become the gulag of our times, entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law, Khan said. 

 Accused of being too harsh on the US, Khan replied that the facts spoke for themselves.

 Hundreds of people were being held in Guantanamo and the US airbase at Bagram in Afghanistan ? some for more than three years ? without either charge or trial and no access to legal representation. By actively undermining human rights the US, the EU and others have actually made the security situation worse, she said.

 She also noted Washingtons attempts to circumvent its own ban on the use of torture. 

 The US government has gone to great lengths to restrict the application of the Geneva Convention and to re-define torture, she said, citing the secret detention of suspects and the practice of handing some over to countries where torture was not outlawed. Governments are trying to subcontract torture. Justice is not just being denied it is being diverted, she said.To argue that torture is warranted is to push us back to the Middle Ages.

 Afghan polls in September

 Kabul, March 20 (Reuters): Afghanistan will hold its delayed parliamentary elections on September 18, a joint Afghan-UN election commission said on Sunday.

 The election will require a major security operation to guard against violence by Taliban insurgents and intimidation by regional warlords vying for power. Provincial assembly polls will also be held on September 18, Bismillah Bismil, chairman of the joint electoral management body, told a news conference.

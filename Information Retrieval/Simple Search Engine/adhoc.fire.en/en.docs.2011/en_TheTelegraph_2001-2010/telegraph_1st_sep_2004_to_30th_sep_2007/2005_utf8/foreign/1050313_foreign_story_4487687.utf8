 No Rice pressure on Pervez on posts

 Washington, March 12 (Reuters): Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice suggested yesterday she would not pressure Pakistan leader to give up his army post on a visit next week as Washington balances its push to spread democracy with its need to support anti-terrorism allies.

 Asked twice in an interview if she would urge President Pervez Musharraf to abandon the top army post, which he has held on to despite a pledge to give it up, Rice said only that she would press for democratic progress.

 The top US diplomat praised the general, who seized power in a bloodless 1999 military coup, for helping foster stability over the last few years in a nuclear-armed Islamic country with many al Qaida supporters.

 ?I will certainly, as the President has done in his discussions, urge that democratic process in Pakistan be advanced,? Rice said. ?It?s awfully important, though, to look at what has happened in Pakistan in three-plus years.?

 Rice?s visit to Pakistan as part of a trip to Asia next week tests how far President George W. Bush will go to back up his pledge to make forging democracy a more central element of bilateral relations in his second term.

 A US official, who asked not to be identified, said Rice would focus during the visit on supporting Musharraf for his anti-al Qaida stance rather than criticising him over democracy.

 The Bush administration believes there is no alternative to Musharraf in Pakistan who could better support the US in its war on terrorism, the official said. ?He?s our guy,? he said. ?He expects praise and he will get it ? lots of it.?

 Musharraf, who in December broke his pledge to give up his position as chief of army staff, infuriated hardline Islamist groups allied to al Qaida by siding with Washington in a global war on terror.

 General?s appeal

 Musharraf urged moderate Pakistanis today to rally against Islamic militancy saying the government alone could not combat it.

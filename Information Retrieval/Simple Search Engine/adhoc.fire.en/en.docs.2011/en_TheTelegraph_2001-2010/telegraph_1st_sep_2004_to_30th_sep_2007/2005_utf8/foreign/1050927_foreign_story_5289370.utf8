 Huge Mexico hug

 Ciudad Juarez (Mexico), Sept. 26 (AP): More than 14,000 people in this infamously violent city on the US-Mexico border embraced and held on tight for a 15-minute giant hug, that attempted to set a new Guinness World Record. 

 Mayor Hector Murguia led the gathering yesterday, which took place in the shadow of a Mexican flag close to a bridge leading over the border and into neighbouring El Paso, Texas. The embrace began with the cry: Mexico, Mexico, Mexico around midday. Murguia arrived with Javier Canario Nassar, who verified that 14,200 people participated in the hug, and planned to send documentation stating as such to Guinness officials in London.

 The mayor said the event showed that Juarez was a city made up of caring and morally sound residents who deserved to be recognised around the world for more than the hundreds of largely unsolved killings of women that have taken place here since 1993. 

 Dolls advice: Dont Cha

 London (Reuters): American cabaret act 

 The Pussycat Dolls have scored a third week at the top of 

 the British singles charts with their debut single Dont 

 Cha, the Official UK Charts Company said on Sunday. 

 The all-girl group, based around a Los Angeles burlesque 

 act, perform on the release with New York rapper Busta Rhymes. 

 Their continuing success restricted Chicago hip-hop producer 

 Kayne West to second place with his new single, Gold 

 Digger, featuring Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx.

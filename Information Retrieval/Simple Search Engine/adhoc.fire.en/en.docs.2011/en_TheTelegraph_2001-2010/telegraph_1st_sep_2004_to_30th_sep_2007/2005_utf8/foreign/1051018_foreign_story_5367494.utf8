 Belfast ban on smoking

 Belfast, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Northern Ireland followed in the footsteps of the Irish Republic today by outlawing smoking in all workplaces, including pubs and restaurants.

 The ban, which comes as England debates the imposition of its own such restrictions, comes into effect in April 2007.

 Last year, the Irish Republic, which borders British-ruled Northern Ireland, became the first country in the world to impose a nationwide ban on smoking in pubs, restaurants and workplaces. A number of other countries, including Malta, Norway and Italy, have since followed suit.

 Northern Ireland health minister Shaun Woodward said the move would lead to the prevention of thousands of unnecessary deaths. This is an historic decision for Northern Ireland, he said.

 This is not about banning smoking. People have that freedom of choice. What this decision is about is where people smoke. His focus, he said, had been on the health of non-smokers.

 Rushdie on strong Booker list

 London, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Julian Barnes and Ian McEwan have been installed as favourites to win the Man Booker Prize, one of the worlds top literary awards, after the longlist was announced today.

 Heavyweight authors Salman Rushdie, Zadie Smith and J.M. Coetzee were also confirmed among the contenders for the 2005 award, which judges described as an exceptional year.

 This ... in the judges opinion may rank as one of the strongest ever since the prize was founded in 1969, chair of judges John Sutherland said in a statement. The judges have enjoyed their judging experience enormously, so far.

 The winner will receive ?50,000 and a guaranteed increase in sales. Seventeen books were included in the longlist, including four previous Booker winners and three first novels. Rushdie was looking for his second Booker prize with Shalimar The Clown after winning in 1981, and Smith was included for On Beauty.

 Media focus on my life misguided, says Brad Pitt

 New York, June 7 (AP): Brad Pitt is taking on poverty and AIDS in Africa ? and the tabloids. 

 In an hour-long ABC Primetime Live special, Pitt talks to anchorwoman Diane Sawyer about the humanitarian crisis in Africa.

 I cant get out of the press. These people cant get in the press. So lets redirect the attention a little bit, he tells Sawyer. We have the potential to end poverty (in Africa) in our time. ... Man ? I mean, what is more exciting than that? The potentials there.

 Pitt separated from Jennifer Aniston in January after four and a half years of marriage. Aniston, 36, filed for divorce in March, citing irreconcilable differences.

 He calls tabloid speculation that his Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie (picture above shows the two in a scene from the film) played a role in the breakup of his marriage a good story. 

 Says Sawyer: But thats painful too. 

 Yeah, but, well, listen, let me speak from my experience, he says. You know Ive been in these tabloids for 14 years now. And at some point you just become a Zen master of it all. 

 He calls the media focus on his personal life misguided, and denies that he wanted children and Aniston didnt. Ridiculous... completely fabricated, the 41-year-old actor says. You know, you find that these stories ... will turn one of us into the good guy and one of us into the bad guy. ... Most of these stories, you get probably 2 per cent real fruit juice and the rest is just garbage with no nutritional value.

 Photos of Pitt, Jolie and her 4-year-old son, Maddox, walking together on a beach in Africa were published in April. Did he know there would be cameras there?

 You know, obviously not, he says. I mean, its an amazing fact, the bounty thats on my head and the lengths that these people go to get these shots and the amount of money that theyre paying for these shots... I cant help but think what that money could have gone to... I would have set up the damn pictures myself. 

 However, Pitt says he dreams of having a family someday.

 Just feels like a natural progression, he tells Sawyer. And, you know, anything to get the focus off myself.

 In an interview with Marie Claire magazine, Jolie poured cold water on rumours of a romance with Brad Pitt, saying the two are not intimate. Absolutely not, she said when asked if she had sex with Pitt.

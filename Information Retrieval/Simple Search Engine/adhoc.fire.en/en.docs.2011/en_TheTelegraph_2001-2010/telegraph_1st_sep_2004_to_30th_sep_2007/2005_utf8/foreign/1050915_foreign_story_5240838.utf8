 Osama in poor health, says Arabic newspaper

 Osama bin Laden

 Cairo, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is in poor health and is seeking medical attention, the London-based Arabic newspaper al-Hayat said today, quoting a US officer in Afghanistan.

 Osama bin Laden is trying to obtain medical attention, Colonel Don McGraw, director of operations at the Combined Forces Command in Kabul, told a group of British reporters, including one from al-Hayat, it said.

 He (McGraw) refused to say what the Qaida leader is suffering from or whether it is the same kidney disease which Pakistani officials said in the past he was suffering from, the newspaper added.

 Al-Hayat said it was not clear how the US military had obtained its information or where it thought bin Laden might be.

 However, a US military spokeswoman in Kabul denied that one of its officers had told reporters Osama was seeking medical attention. Colonel McGraw did not say Osama bin Laden was trying to get medical attention, said the spokeswoman Lieutenant Cindy Moore. Were working with the editor to correct the record, she said of the al Hayat report.

 The Saudi-born militant is believed to have taken refuge somewhere on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan after escaping from US troops and their Afghan allies who toppled the Taliban government that had hosted him in 2001.

 Safe passage

 Osama bin Laden was provided safe passage to Pakistan in 2001 by Afghan commanders paid by al Qaida and sympathetic to its cause, a senior Afghan official said today.

 Lutfullah Mashal, Afghanistans interior ministry spokesman, said commanders helped the al Qaida leader escape from the Tora Bora mountains as US warplanes and Afghan forces attacked his hideout near the Pakistan border in late 2001.

 The help was provided because of monetary aid availed by al Qaida and also partly because of ideological issues, Mashal said.

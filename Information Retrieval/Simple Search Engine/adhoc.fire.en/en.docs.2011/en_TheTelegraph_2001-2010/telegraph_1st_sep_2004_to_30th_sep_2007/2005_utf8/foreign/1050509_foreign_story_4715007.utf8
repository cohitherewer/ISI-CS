 Blair-baiters in Brown call

 Blair: Back, but for how long?

 London, May 8 (Reuters): Members of Tony Blairs Labour party called today for him to stand down sooner rather than later even after he won a record third term as British Prime Minister but his allies dismissed them as isolated mavericks.

 Blair could have been forgiven for thinking he had lost Thursdays election as members of parliament from his centre-left party used media interviews to urge a swift handover to heir apparent and finance minister Gordon Brown.

 Blair, the first Labour leader to win three successive elections and once seen as his partys greatest asset, has insisted he plans to serve a full term of four or five years.

 But with public trust in the Prime Minister battered by his unpopular decision to go to war in Iraq and other issues, some Labour members say he was a liability in the election campaign.

 ?Large numbers of people on the doorstep said that they wouldnt vote for Labour because of the war and very many of them went on to say they wouldnt vote Labour so long as Tony Blair remains leader of the Labour party,? said Frank Dobson, a former health minister.

 Labour won 356 parliamentary seats on Thursday, a decrease of 47 over the last election but enough for an absolute majority of 67 with one seat still outstanding. 

 Some Labour members said Blair should quit before the partys annual conference in the autumn. Others said he could wait until Britain finishes presiding over the Group of Eight leading nations and the EU at the end of the year.

 A third group has suggested he wait until after a referendum on the new EU constitution, a tough battle expected next year. ?The sooner we could have a reasonably smooth handover, the better,? Ian Davidson, a Labour member of parliament told The Sunday Times.

 The public calls so soon after the election are likely to be seen as a sign power is already ebbing away from Blair. But his supporters said many of those complaining were longtime critics who did not represent the mainstream.

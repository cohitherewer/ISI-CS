 Charles peeve at press

 London, March 31: The Prince of Wales has revealed his aversion to the press, after comments made under his breath were picked up by microphones at a photocall on his skiing holiday.

 Prince Charles muttered: ?I hate doing this? and ?bloody people? as posed for pictures with sons William and Harry in Klosters, Switzerland a week before his wedding.

 The Prince, who marries Camilla Parker Bowles on April 8, looked uncomfortable as he was asked about the forthcoming nuptials.

 When questioned about how he was feeling before the big day, he said: ?I?m very glad you have heard of it.? But then he muttered: ?Bloody people.? Earlier the Prince had said under his breath: ?I hate doing this.?

 The royals traditionally stage one photocall during their spring break in the exclusive resort in return for peace and quiet while skiing on the slopes. Paparazzi photographers snapped William and girlfriend Kate Middleton together yesterday.

 There was no sign of university student Kate at the photocall today. William was asked about how he and Kate were coping with the media attention. ?I haven?t seen any of it. I?m just gagging to be on the slopes ? simple as that,? he said. Asked if there was likely to be a second royal wedding soon, the Prince dismissed the idea and said: ?No?. 

 Responding to questions about his father?s wedding William said he was ?very happy, very pleased?, adding: ?It will be a good day.?

 Harry, 20, smiled and said little throughout the photo call and made no remarks on the wedding. Paddy Harverson, Charles?s communications secretary, said of the heir to the throne?s comments: ?He wasn?t looking forward to it. He prefers it when he skis and he just wanted to get up into the mountains.

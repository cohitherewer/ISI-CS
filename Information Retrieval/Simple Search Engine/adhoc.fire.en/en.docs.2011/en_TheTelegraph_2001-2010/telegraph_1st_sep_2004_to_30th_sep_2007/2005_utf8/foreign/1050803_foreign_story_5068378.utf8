 Bus fire sparks panic

 London, Aug. 2 (AFP): Frightened passengers on a London bus leapt from the upper deck window today when a small fire on board triggered panic amid fears of another terror attack, witnesses said.

 Police briefly sealed off part of the city centre after smoke was seen billowing from the double-decker bus, but lifted the alert after nothing alarming was found, a spokesman said.

 The incident, the exact cause of which was not immediately clear, reflected jittery nerves of residents in the British capital since the July 7 bombings which left 56 dead. 

 The July 7 death toll included 13 killed on a bus ripped apart by the blast. Police have warned that the threat of further attacks remains very real.

 Everyone panicked, but it was only a small fire and no one was hurt, said a metropolitan police spokesman after the alarm near kings cross station, one of the venues of the deadly suicide bombings last month.

 No signs of fire were visible on the bus, but the access cover to the rear-mounted engine was open.

 Objects left by the bus as frightened passengers ran off included a laptop computer bag, a jacket, a purse and a pair of womens shoes. More afp hk 08022356 del

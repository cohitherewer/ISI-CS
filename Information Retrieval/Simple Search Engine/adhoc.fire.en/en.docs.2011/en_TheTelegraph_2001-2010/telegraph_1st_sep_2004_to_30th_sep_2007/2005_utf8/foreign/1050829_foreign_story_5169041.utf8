 Olivia partner mystery deepens

 JOHN HISCOCK 

 Patrick McDermott

 Los Angeles, Aug. 28: The mystery surrounding the disapperance of Olivia Newton-Johns partner deepened yesterday as it was revealed that his relationship with the singer had petered out and that he was beset by financial problems.

 Investigators searching for Patrick McDermott, a Hollywood cameraman, have unearthed his troubled past, including allegations of abusive and dysfunctional behaviour. They were perplexed to discover that, although he was bankrupt, in debt and being sued by his former wife for child support, McDermott, 48, dropped out of a film industry union earlier this year, forfeiting significant benefits, including pension, medical and life insurance.

 His disappearance from a boat while on an overnight fishing trip off the California coast on June 30 has been widely reported because of his relationship with Newton-John, who last week appealed for information about his whereabouts. Investigations have only raised more questions and failed to supply many answers.

 Personal items, including McDermotts passport, wallet and drivers licence were found on board and his car was in the marina car park. 

 However, he was not reported missing for 10 days and US coastguards looking into his case say they have still have not heard from or spoken to Newton-John.

 Friends believe that the couple, who met in 1996 when the Australian singer was filming a commercial, had drifted apart and had not spoken to each other for several months.

 Investigators are following up various theories but have uncovered no hard evidence. Did he fall overboard? Did he just walk off the boat and disappear? Was it accidental, was it deliberate? Any number of things could have happened from the time he got on the boat until the boat returned to port, said coastguard officer Savannah Trotinksy. 

 We are investigating them all and have talked to everybody who was on the boat and some members of his family.

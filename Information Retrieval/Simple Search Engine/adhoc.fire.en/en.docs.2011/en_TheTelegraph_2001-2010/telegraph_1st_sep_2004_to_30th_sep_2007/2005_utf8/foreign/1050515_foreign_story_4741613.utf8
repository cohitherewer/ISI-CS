 Statins can aid cancer cure

 Orlando (Florida), May 14 (Reuters): Cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins can prevent breast cancer, researchers said today, meaning the already widely used drugs can prevent not only heart disease but range of cancers.

 Female military veterans who were taking statin drugs to lower their cholesterol had a 51 per cent lower risk of developing breast cancer over the six years of the study, the researchers said.

 Only last month a study showed that men who used statins had half the risk of advanced prostate cancer and one-third the risk of fatal prostate cancer over 10 years compared with men who did not use the drugs.

 Studies published in 2004 also suggested statins may lower the risk of prostate cancer and colon cancer.

 Statins ? which include Pfizer Incs $10 billion-a-year Lipitor, Bristol-Myers Squibb Cos Pravachol and Merck and Co. Incs Zocor ? are the worlds bestselling drugs, taken by millions to reduce the risk of heart attack by lowering cholesterol levels.

 It is far too soon to say people should take the drugs strictly to lower the risk of cancer, but the added benefit makes them an easy choice for people with high cholesterol. 

 Right now, if they need to be on something, I think being on a statin might produce a beneficial effect, said Dr Vikas Khurana, who helped organise the study at Overtoon-Brooke VA Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana.

 Capitol salute to Rosa Parks

 Washington, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks became the first woman to lie in honour in the US Capitol Rotunda yesterday, a tribute usually reserved for presidents, soldiers and politicians.

 Thousands of people, in a line snaking from the front of the Capitol into the National Mall, waited to pay respects following a private tribute attended by President George W. Bush and other dignitaries.

 Parks casket was carried by members of the National Guard as a college choir sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush, and Senate and House delegations placed wreaths of red, white and blue carnations at the side of the casket.

 Applause rose from the crowd as the hearse bearing Parkss coffin arrived at the Capitol, followed by a 1950s-era bus draped in black bunting. Her body was flown to Washington after a memorial service in her hometown of Montgomery, Alabama.

 Parks refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white man helped break racial segregation in America. Her quiet protest 50 years ago led to a revolt against the segregation of whites and blacks. Parks, who died on Monday at her home in Detroit at age 92, was remembered as a freedom fighter. 

 Many of the people in Washington who waited to pay tribute to her said they had come to pay their respects to a woman who played an important role in US history.

 She was a revolutionary in a very dignified way and I cant imagine what our country would be like had it not been for Rosa Parks, said Karen Lawson. Bush ordered flags flown at half-mast on buildings on Wednesday when Parks funeral is scheduled to take place in Detroit.

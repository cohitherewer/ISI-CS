 Snake puffs cereal

 London, May 4 (Reuters): A British boy tucking into his breakfast had a nasty surprise when he discovered a two-foot long snake inside his packet of cereal.

 Jordan Willett, 5, thought he had found a toy when the serpent ? a harmless corn snake ? slithered out of the packet of ?Golden Puffs? his parents had bought from discount store Netto in Telford, central England. ?It was quite long and popped its head up. I?ve seen snakes on TV before but never in a box of cereal,? he told the Daily Mail newspaper.

 Netto said today it was talking to its suppliers to review procedures and check on its stock. ?This does seem to be a bizarre incident but we are treating it seriously,? said Netto trading director Clive Cooper. Corn snakes, which feed on mice and birds, are commonly kept as pets around the world.

 West woes

 Brussels (Reuters): Irish boyband Westlife lost the right to hold onto a trademark on its name on Wednesday when an EU court ruled the name was too similar to another trademark, West, which is owned by a German firm. While the four-member group, which has had a string of chart-topping hits in Britain, can still use the name Westlife on merchandise, it cannot stop other people from using it. In 2003, the EU?s community trademark office allowed the band to register Westlife as a trademark despite opposition from a German company which said it was too similar to its trademark West.

 The EUs lower court, the Court of First Instance, found in favour of the German firm on Wednesday and annulled the Westlife trademark, saying the names were too alike and would confuse customers.

 ?The court finds that there is a likelihood of confusion between the two trademarks,? the court judgement said. 

 ?The contested (EU Community Trademark Office) decision must be annulled.?

 The boyband, signed to Sony BMG, can appeal the decision to the EUs top court.

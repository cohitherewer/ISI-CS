 Sharon deal

 Stone: Honourable

 Los Angeles, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Sharon Stone has agreed to drop her lawsuit against a plastic surgeon she accused of libel in return for his performing free surgery for children with facial deformities, the doctors lawyer said yesterday.

 The settlement became final on Monday when Stone filed papers in a Los Angeles court dismissing her complaint against Dr Renato Calabria, whom she accused of making false claims that she had a face-lift, his attorney, Arthur Barens said.

 Stones lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.

 In exchange for dismissal of Stones complaint, the Beverly Hills physician agreed to provide his services on a pro bono basis for a charity the actress is involved in that arranges reconstructive facial surgery for children, Barens said.

 I think Stone did the honorable thing, and I think that Dr Calabria did an honorable thing, too, said another of the surgeons lawyers, Kevin Leichter. (Calabria) managed to turn a lawsuit into a benefit to the community.

 The 47-year-old Basic Instinct star sued the doctor for defamation and libel in December 2004, charging he had falsely claimed to have given the actress a face-lift. Barens has said his client never represented to anyone that he had performed cosmetic surgery on Stone.

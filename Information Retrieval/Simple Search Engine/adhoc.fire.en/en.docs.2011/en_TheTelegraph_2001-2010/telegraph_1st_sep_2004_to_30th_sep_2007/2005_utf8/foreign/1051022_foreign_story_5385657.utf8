 US trip for award soon: Mai

 Mukhtaran Mai

 Multan, Oct. 21 (Reuters): A Pakistani woman whose gangrape on the orders of a village council in 2002 provoked an international outcry said today she will soon travel to the US to receive an award from a magazine.

 Mukhtaran Mai, 33, was gangraped on the orders of a traditional council after her brother, who was 12 at that time, was judged to have offended the honour of a powerful clan.

 I have been invited by a magazine, Glamour, for the award ceremony on November 2. I will use the occasion to also highlight the plight of the earthquake victims in Pakistan, Mai said.

 According to a letter from the magazines editor-in-chief, Cindi Leive, published in the Dawn newspaper, the magazine would honour women who had struggled for the cause of women at its November 2 awards show.

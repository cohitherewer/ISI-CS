 Theron prefers single role

 Charlize Theron

 Los Angeles, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Oscar winner Charlize Theron has played an astronauts wife, a safecracker, serial killer and mine worker, but there is one off-camera role she never wants to give up ? that of a single woman.

 In an interview for the TV show Access Hollywood, the 30-year-old actor said matrimony is not for her. Im happy for people who want to get married, the South African-born Theron said, but added, Its not my thing. Her comments came days after her mother, Gerda, got married again. Theron was 15 years old when her mother fatally shot her alcoholic father as he threatened the family in a drunken rage.

 Although the actor sees no wedding bells in her own future, Theron said she remains committed to her boyfriend of four years, Irish actor Stuart Townsend, star of the ABC television series Night Stalker.

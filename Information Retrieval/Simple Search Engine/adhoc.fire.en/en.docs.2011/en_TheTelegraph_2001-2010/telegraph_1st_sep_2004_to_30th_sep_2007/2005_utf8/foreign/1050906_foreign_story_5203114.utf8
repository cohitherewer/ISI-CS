 Typhoon, as strong as Katrina, hits Japan

 Tokyo, Sept. 5 (Reuters): A typhoon lashed southwestern Japan today, creating nine-metre high waves, cutting power supplies and disrupting transport and work at oil refineries.

 Weather officials in South Korea also warned of flooding, while eastern China braced for possible effects from Typhoon Nabi after another storm last week killed at least 84 people in the east of the country, newspapers said.

 Nabi was 150 km southwest of the tiny southern Japanese island of Yakushima at 0900 GMT, the Meteorological Agency said. Winds were gusting up to 160 kmph at the centre of the typhoon, but the storm weakened slightly as it passed over cooler water.

 The Tropical Storm Risk website had classified Nabi as a Category 4 storm on an ascending scale of 1 to 5, the same category as Katrina, which hit the US Gulf Coast last week. But later today, it downgraded the storm to a Category 3.

 Typhoon Nabi, whose name means butterfly in Korean, was travelling north-northwest at 15 kmph, heading directly for the densely populated southern island of Kyushu.

 The Meteorological Agency expects Nabi to swerve to the east over the next 24 hours, putting it on course to batter much of Japan and southern and eastern parts of South Korea.

 Television pictures showed coastal areas of Amami Oshima being engulfed by waves that national broadcaster NHK said were up to nine metres high.

 At least four people were injured on Kyushu as the storm approached the island, police said.

 Japans top government spokesman, Hiroyuki Hosoda, said the countrys military, police, firefighters and coast guard were on standby.

 Hundreds of flights in and out of Kyushu were cancelled today, NHK said.

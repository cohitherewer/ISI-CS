 Reform sought on UN force

 United Nations, March 21 (Reuters): Secretary-general Kofi Annan advocated yesterday new rules for military intervention, radically changing a key human rights body and adopting an anti-terrorism treaty against Palestinian suicide bombers.

 In a 63-page report on UN reform, Annan also called on nations at a planned UN summit in September to agree on a timetable to provide 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to combat poverty by 2015. 

 Among the more controversial proposals is to abolish the much-criticised Geneva-based 53-member Human Rights Commission, accused of ignoring major abuses. This body, he said, should be replaced by a smaller Human Rights Council, whose members would be elected by a two-thirds vote of the 191-member General Assembly rather than by regional groups. Too many members of the commission, Annan said, protected themselves against ?criticism? or declined ?to criticise others.? 

 Annan also is bound to anger Arab governments by advocating a tough anti-terrorism treaty that would exclude any attacks on civilians, even in face of so-called ?state terrorism.? 

 On security, Annan?s report, In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, Security and Human Rights for All, said the UN Security Council should adopt a resolution on ?when and how force can be used,? with such criteria as whether the military option was proportional to the threat as well as the?right to protect? helpless civilians from their governments. He called for a ?strategic reserve force? of stand-by troops as well as a peace commission to deal with operations of mounting complexity .

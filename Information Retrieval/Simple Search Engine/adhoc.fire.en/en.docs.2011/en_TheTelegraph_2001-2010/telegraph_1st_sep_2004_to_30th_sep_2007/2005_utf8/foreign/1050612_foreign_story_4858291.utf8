 Travel bar on victim

 Multan, June 11 (Agencies): The Pakistani woman at the centre of a high-profile gangrape case has been barred from travelling abroad, the government said today.

 No reason was given for the decision on Mukhataran Mai, whose case has shocked Pakistan and the international community, but junior interior minister Shahzad Waseem said the government had her security in mind. We have put Mukhtaran Mai on the exit control list, he said.

 It was not clear whether Mai, who lives in Meerwala, a village in the eastern province of Punjab, where the rape took place, wanted to leave the country but unconfirmed reports said she was planning a trip to the US. 

 Meerwala lies 180 km southwest of Multan.

 Mai, who was gangraped on the orders of a traditional village council in 2002, said today police were not allowing her to leave her house.

 I urge the government to lift restrictions and allow me to see my lawyer, Mai said by telephone. 

 Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said any security measures were protective as Mai had expressed fears for her safety in March. 

 Whatever we are doing is to protect her, Aziz said.

 Mais case provoked a national outcry and focused internation attention on the treatement of women in feudal-dominated rural Pakistan.

 A high court in Punjab yesterday ordered the release next week of 12 men connected to the case.

 The original trial before an anti-terrorism court in 2002 found that Mai had been gang-raped on the orders of a traditional village council after her brother ? who was 12 at the time ? was judged to have offended the honour of a powerful clan by befriending a woman from their tribe.

 Six men were originally convicted of the crime and sentenced to death, but five were later acquitted after appealing to the Punjab court, which cited a lack of evidence. A sixth man had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment.

 The provincial government subsequently intervened and ordered that the men be detained for three months pending the outcome of an appeal by the victim against the acquittal.

 Six men who served on the village council were detained at the same time.

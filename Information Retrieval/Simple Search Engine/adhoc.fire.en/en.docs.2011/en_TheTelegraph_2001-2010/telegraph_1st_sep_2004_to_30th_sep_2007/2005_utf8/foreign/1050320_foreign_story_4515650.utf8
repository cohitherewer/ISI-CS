 Demi?s not saying it

 Demi Moore

 New York, March 19 (AP): Demi Moore is not answering the question.

 Asked about tabloid stories saying she?s pregnant, the 42-year-old actor told People magazine: ?The rumours are just that: rumours.?

 Moore?s publicist, Stephen Huvane, issued this statement: ?Having another child is something Demi would like to do, but she cannot at this time say she is pregnant.?

 A call to Huvane yesterday by the Associated press wasn?t immediately returned. Earlier in the week, the would-be father, 27-year-old Ashton Kutcher, joked about the reports. 

 At a news conference promoting his new movie, Guess Who, he said: ?Why am I the last person to find out everything? I?m going to be a daddy? God, no one tells me anything.? Moore and her second husband, Bruce Willis, divorced in 2000.

 They have three daughters. She recently finished shooting the thriller Half Light. Her films also include Charlie?s Angels: Full Throttle, G.I. Jane and Striptease.

 Kutcher has an MTV prank show, Punk?d, and co-stars in the Fox sitcom That ?70s Show.

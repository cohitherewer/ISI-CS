 Austrian links Iran leader to Kurd killing

 Vienna, July 2 (Reuters): An outspoken Austrian politician has accused Irans newly elected President of aiding the 1989 assassination of a Kurdish opposition leader in Vienna, the interior ministry said today.

 But the ministry said it was not investigating the charge.

 Austrian Green Party politician Peter Pilz said he had information implicating Iranian President-elect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 1989 assassination of Iranian exile Kurdish leader Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou and two other Kurdish opposition politicians in the Austrian capital.

 Several weeks ago Pilz, the Greens security spokesman, gave Austrias interior ministry documents that he says support the allegation, said ministry spokesman Major Rudolf Gollia.

 These documents were then forwarded to the state prosecutors office, and the matter is in their hands, Gollia said, adding the ministry was not investigating the matter. Until now we have not received a request from the prosecutors office to begin a formal investigation, he said. But that doesnt mean there couldnt be one in the future.

 A senior aide to Ahmadinejad in Tehran said: This is not even worth commenting on. It is like the other accusations and there will be more accusations.

 In an interview with the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, Pilz said his accusation was based on information he received from an extraordinarily credible informer, an Iranian journalist living in France who Pilz calls only witness D.

 Witness Ds information came from one of the alleged gunmen, who contacted Witness D in 2001 but later drowned, Pilz said. He did not say whether Witness D was linked to any exiled Iranian political groups in France.

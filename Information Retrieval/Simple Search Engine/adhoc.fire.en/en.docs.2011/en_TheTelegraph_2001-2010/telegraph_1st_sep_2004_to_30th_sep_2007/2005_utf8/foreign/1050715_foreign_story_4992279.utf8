 Nasa races to fix craft

 - Earliest shuttle launch set for Saturday

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), July 14 (Reuters): Nasa engineers searched today for the cause of a fuel-sensor problem that kept space shuttle Discovery from flying, delaying the first shuttle mission since the 2003 Columbia accident.

 The US space agency called off yesterdays much-anticipated launch of Discovery less than three hours before the scheduled mid-afternoon liftoff. The next attempt could be on Saturday at the earliest, but first Nasa must figure out why the fuel sensor malfunctioned, and that could take time.

 Engineers trouble-shooting meetings at Kennedy Space Center in Florida began early today, with a closed-door gathering of mission managers set for midday. Even after that, a launch timetable may not be clear.

 Nasa has until July 31 to launch Discovery, a deadline dictated by its planned rendezvous with the International Space Station and a new requirement that all shuttle launches take place during daylight hours.

 If Discovery fails to launch this month, the next window of opportunity begins on September 9. Any substantial delay after that could threaten construction of the orbiting station and perhaps the long-term plan to return humans to the Moon and eventually to Mars and beyond.

 Nasa experts acknowledged that the sensor problem ? which they described as an intermittent event with no obvious cause ? represented a difficult challenge.

 It does at this stage remain an unexplained anomaly. It reminds me of an old truck I owned with an intermittent electrical problem, said deputy shuttle programme manager Wayne Hale. 

 The faulty sensor is one of four that would cut off the shuttles three main engines if at least two showed that hydrogen fuel was running low. A premature cut-off might damage the engines, force the shuttle to make an emergency landing.

 Discoverys planned liftoff from Cape Canaveral marks the first shuttle mission since its sister ship Columbia fell apart over Texas on February 1, 2003, killing all seven astronauts. Falling foam from Columbias external fuel tank had knocked a hole in its wing at lift-off 16 days before. The shuttle disintegrated when superheated gases tore into the breach on re-entry into the Earths atmosphere.

 Saudi envoy recalled in soccer row

 Riyadh, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia has recalled its ambassador from Hungary after Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany described the Saudi soccer team as ?Arab terrorists?, a foreign ministry official said today.

 ?He is back in the kingdom. He was summoned back for consultations,? the official said. 

 Gyurcsany was quoted in Hungary?s media praising the national soccer team for fighting ?with death-defying courage? against ?Arab terrorists? after they drew 0-0 in a friendly game against Saudi Arabia on February 2.

 He has since apologised for the comments, made at a private party. His remarks triggered an emergency meeting of Arab ambassadors and consuls in Budapest, but the envoys said at the time the incident would not damage relations between Hungary and the Arab world.

 The Saudi official did not say what further steps the kingdom might consider taking.

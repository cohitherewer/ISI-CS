 Oscar Passion for 9/11 under test

 New York, Jan. 10: It?s hard to feel much sympathy for Oscar voters, with their free screenings, free screeners and somewhat consistent history of picking the wrong movie for the wrong reasons. 

 This year, though, they?ve got a prickly and potentially heated situation. And something of a cross to bear. 

 Both The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 are potential nominees for best picture (nominations will be announced on January 25). Ignoring them ? which Oscar is almost certain to do ? will be tough to justify. The choice is whether to focus on the two very controversial and money-making films or to make the Academy Awards even less relevant than usual. 

 No one can say that box office receipts are the overriding factor in Academy voting. Shrek 2, the biggest earner of 2004, is a long long shot for a best picture nod (it might not even win best animated feature, its likely competition being The Incredibles). And Meet the Fockers ? the holiday juggernaut that made $42-plus million in its second weekend ? won?t be up for many statuettes either. 

 At the indie end of the spectrum, Alexander Payne?s Sideways, starring Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen, would seem to be the odds-on favourite for high-minded awards-giving, based on the awards season thus far (critics? groups and pseudo-critics? groups).

 But the film has made only about $22 million, ranking it behind Ella Enchanted and The Alamo. So its chances would seem iffy. 

 While The Passion is sui generis (or of its own kind) in terms of subject and execution, it has the financial credentials: It was the third-biggest earner of the year, with more than $370 million gross. And, more important, it fed the movie-going desires of a growing and increasingly influential segment of the country ? including an untapped reservoir of people who would never otherwise go to the movies. 

 Does Hollywood, already wearing the Mark of Cain for being licentious, immoral and Jewish, want to antagonise the entire fundamentalist Christian community by overlooking its favourite film? 

 Thinking, as many did, that Mel Gibson made a shockingly tawdry, violent/anti-Semitic movie isn?t important. What is, in the Hollywood mind, is the ability to go about business as usual in a political atmosphere dominated by interests virtually champing at the bit to apply some kind of censorship to the entertainment biz. It?s got to be a concern. 

 Which leads directly to Michael Moore, the anti-Christ to the hard-core Right. He didn?t win the election with Fahrenheit 9/11, but his documentary is precisely the kind of film Oscar voters would nominate in a heartbeat ? if, in fact, this were 1968. Smart, influential and high-minded (enough, at least, for Hollywood), it?s also a major money-making documentary at a time when documentaries seem to be coming into their own. 

 But honouring Gibson without honouring Moore, or vice versa, would be a dicey thing to pull off. 

 That Moore has removed himself from best documentary contention to vie for a best picture nomination (thus shutting down one Oscar voter escape hatch) makes it all the more ticklish. 

 The view from here says that the 2005 Academy Awards will proceed as if neither film ever happened ? along with the war, religious strife and ongoing issues of cultural pollution. 

 That said, the conventional wisdom in the office Oscar pool is to vote with your head rather than your heart. This year, however, it doesn?t seem to be much of a conflict.

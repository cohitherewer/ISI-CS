 Vietnam flu

 Hanoi, Oct. 29 (Reuters): Two people showing symptoms of the bird flu virus have died in the past week in Vietnam, where the disease has already killed more than 40 people, hospital officials said today.

 Its very, very clear that all the critical symptoms pointed to bird flu, Dr Nguyen Ngoc Tai, the director of the Vietnam-Cuba Hospital in Dong Hoi, central Vietnam, said.

 The Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper quoted a report from the hospital in Quang Binh province as saying the victims, a 14-year-old girl and a 26-year-old man, had eaten duck and a chickens egg around a week before they got sick. The girl was admitted to hospital on October 21 and died on October 23 and the man died on October 26 within an hour of arriving at the hospital. Their bodies had been sent home to be buried, Tai said.

 He said the victims were not related and from different towns in the province, about 500 km south of the capital Hanoi. Health officials from Bo Trach district and Quang Trach district where the two victims lived said chicken and ducks were on sale in local markets as usual on Saturday.

 People are taking absolutely no caution at all and chicken and ducks are still consumed normally, which is very worrying, said one health official. Officials also said poultry flocks in the two districts had not been vaccinated against bird flu due to lack of vaccines.

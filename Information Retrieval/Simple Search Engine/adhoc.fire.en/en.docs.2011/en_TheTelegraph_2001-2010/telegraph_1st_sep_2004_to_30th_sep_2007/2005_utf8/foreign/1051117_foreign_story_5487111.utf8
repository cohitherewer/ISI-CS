 Bushs Taiwan reform model

 Kyoto (Japan), Nov. 16 (Reuters): President George W. Bush urged China today to move further to allow political and religious freedoms, and he held up Taiwan as a model for Asia of a free and democratic society.

 In remarks sure to annoy Beijing ahead of his visit there on Saturday, Bush said communist-run China was an example of a society that had taken steps toward more openness but had not yet completed the journey.

 As China reforms its economy, its leaders are finding that once the door to freedom is opened even a crack, it cannot be closed, Bush said in a speech in Kyoto, Japan.

 He painted a different picture of Taiwan, the self-ruled island over which China claims sovereignty, though he reiterated Washingtons support for the one-China policy which maintains that Taiwan is not independent.

 Modern Taiwan is free and democratic and prosperous. By embracing freedom at all levels, Taiwan has delivered prosperity to its people and created a free and democratic Chinese society, Bush said. He also praised Japan as a democratic example for Asia.

 Bush also pressed China to take further steps to liberalise its currency and open its domestic market to US exports and he called for a level playing field for trade.

 Japan was Bushs first stop on a week-long, four-nation tour during which North Koreas nuclear programme, tensions over trade with China and the threat of an avian flu pandemic are high on the agenda. He arrived in South Korea today.

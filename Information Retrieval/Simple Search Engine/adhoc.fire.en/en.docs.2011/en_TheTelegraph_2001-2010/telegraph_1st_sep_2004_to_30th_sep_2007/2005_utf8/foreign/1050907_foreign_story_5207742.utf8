 Fine Print

 Star wear

 London, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Workers sorting through party rental costumes at a London fancy dress shop have discovered the original Obi Wan Kenobi robe worn by the actor Alec Guinness in the film Star Wars, the shop said today.

 The robe was stored for years in a warehouse by British film costume company Angels and Bermans, manager Emma Angel said. Its quite a strange looking robe, so when the guys were sorting through the stuff one of them decided to put it on and play around, she said.

 Another employee recognised it as the famous robe, and the films costume designer certified it was genuine.

 School sack

 Rome (Reuters): The Roman Catholic Church 

 caused a minor media frenzy by firing an Italian religion 

 teacher. Caterina Bonci said Church authorities decided 

 she was just too attractive and dressed too sexy to teach 

 religion after 14 years on the job. The Church says it sacked 

 the 38-year-old blonde from the city of Fano because she 

 is divorced. No matter who is right, Bonci has been all 

 over the Italian media demanding to go back to her job teaching 

 religion to children in state schools on behalf of the local 

 diocese. She said she has never hidden her 2000 divorce 

 from Church authorities, dresses down when teaching and 

 defended her right to dress how she likes in her private 

 life.

 Cab curb

 Beijing (Reuters): In a bid to spruce up the citys image, authorities in Chinas Nanjing are banning taxi drivers who are bald, wear their hair too long, have moustaches or wear too much make-up, media said on Tuesday. The new rules aim to smarten up Nanjing ahead of Octobers National Games which will draw viewers across the country.

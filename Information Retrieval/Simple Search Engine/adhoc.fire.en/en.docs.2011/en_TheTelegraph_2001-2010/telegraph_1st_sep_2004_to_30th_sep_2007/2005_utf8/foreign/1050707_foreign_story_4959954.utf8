 Baghdad, July 6 (Reuters): Iraq and the US sought to prevent an exodus of diplomats from Baghdad today after an ambush prompted Pakistan to pull out its ambassador, Bahrains envoy was shot and Egypts was kidnapped.

 The Pakistani and Bahraini diplomats were both attacked by gunmen in their cars yesterday, three days after Egyptian chief of mission Ihab el-Sherif was snatched from the streets.

 Al Qaidas wing in Iraq said it was holding Sherif. The group, which has beheaded foreign captives in the past, displayed the Egyptians driving license, foreign ministry and health insurance cards on a website to prove it had him.

 Iraqs new leader called on countries not to withdraw.

 The terrorists are targetting not only Iraqis, although it is happening inside Iraq, Prime Ibrahim Jaafari said.

 Washington echoed the plea. Its no secret Iraq is a dangerous place, US embassy spokesman Adam Hobson said. 

 We believe its important for the international community to show support for the Iraqis by establishing and maintaining a diplomatic presence.

 Fine Print

 Death gamble

 London, Dec. 10 (Reuters): A 91-year-old British man who staked a ?500 ($870) bet that he would be dead by the end of the first week in December lost his stake by staying alive, a bookmaker said today.

 Arthur King-Robinson said he put the bet on at odds of 6/1 at the start of the year because his wife would have faced an inheritance tax bill of ?3000 had he died in the intervening period.

 I thought Id heard most things that people want to bet on after 30 years in the business, said Graham Sharpe, spokesman for bookmaker William Hill. But one asking literally to place a dead cert was unique. Im glad Arthur has lost. 

 Rock rut

 Los Angeles (AP): Chris Rock wont 

 be back cracking wise as the host of next years Oscars 

 telecast. He is not hosting the Academy Awards, 

 the comedians publicist said. He said Rock didnt 

 want to do the show in perpetuity but would 

 like to do it again down the road. The 2005 

 telecast was Rocks first as host. He drew younger 

 viewers, but his barbs skewering stars like Jude Law, Tobey 

 Maguire and others alienated some members of the Academy 

 of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In one bit, Rock suggested 

 filmmakers should wait for better talent instead of rushing 

 bad movies into theatres. You want Tom Cruise and 

 all you can get is Jude Law. Wait, Rock joked. You 

 want Russell Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell? 

 Wait. Alexander is not Gladiator.

 Clint award

 Los Angeles (AP): After roughing up bad guys on the big screen for decades, and most recently using a little tough love to train a woman boxer, Clint Eastwood will receive the Directors Guild of Americas highest honour. Eastwood will be honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award during the 58th Annual DGA Awards on January 28.

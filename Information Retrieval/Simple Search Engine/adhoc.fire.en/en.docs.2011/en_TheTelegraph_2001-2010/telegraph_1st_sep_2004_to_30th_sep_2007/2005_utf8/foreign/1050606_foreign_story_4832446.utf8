 Alpine tunnel fire

 Milan/Lyon, June 5 (Reuters): An Alpine tunnel linking France and Italy will be closed indefinitely following a 600-degree Celsius truck blaze that killed two people, Italian and French officials said today.

 The victims, both men, were from Slovakia and Slovenia. The fire occurred yesterday in the Frejus tunnel that cuts under the Alps just 160 km south of the Mont Blanc tunnel where 39 people died six years ago in another fire.

 Fire fighters at Frejus took seven hours to extinguish the blaze in the 13-km tunnel and officials said it would not be opened until they were sure there was no risk of the walls or ceiling collapsing as a result of the searing heat.

 The closure of the Frejus tunnel should take several months, said Gilbert Santel, head of the company that manages the French side of the tunnel.

 Fine Print

 Hitler films

 Vienna, April 17 (AP): Nazi officers in smart uniforms. Photographs of Adolf Hitler in soft halo-like light. 

 The images are from a retrospective of World War II-era propaganda movies being shown this month in Austria. The films include about 50 made in Vienna, which after the Nazis annexed the nation in 1938 was turned into a moviemaking machine dubbed ?Hitler?s Hollywood.?

 It aims to show audiences how the Nazis wove their ideals into films meant to entertain the masses. 

 Hospital 

 London (AFP): Camilla has postponed 

 an official visit to a hospital in southern England until 

 after the May 5 general election, royal aides said. ?Going 

 to a hospital when health is one of the key election issues 

 was considered inappropriate during the election period,? 

 a spokesperson said. He denied a report that Camilla was 

 nervous about appearing in public without Charles at her 

 side. 

 Hot bath

 Tokyo (Reuters): A Japanese policeman returning from an evening?s drinking landed in hot water after climbing into a relaxing hot bath in someone else?s house. The 21-year-old officer was arrested and charged with unlawful entry after being discovered late on Friday night in the bath tub of a house, 50 yards from his own. 

 ?I can?t believe it wasn?t my bath,? NHK television quoted the policeman as telling investigators.

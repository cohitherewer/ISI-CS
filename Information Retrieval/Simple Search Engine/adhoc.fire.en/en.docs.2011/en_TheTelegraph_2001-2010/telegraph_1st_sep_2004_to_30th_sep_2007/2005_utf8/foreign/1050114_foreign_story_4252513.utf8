 Nepal vote call as talks fail

 Kathmandu, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Nepal?s Prime Minister said he would call elections and intensify a crackdown against Maoists, after rebels turned down his offer of peace talks.

 Sher Bahadur Deuba said he would continue consultations with coalition partners before making a final announcement on the polls, but made it clear his mind was made up. ?There is no alternative but to go to the polls,? he said. The soft-spoken bespectacled Premier said he had been appointed by the king with a dual mandate of opening peace talks and holding elections. 

 ?Since they have not come for negotiations to settle the insurgency, therefore I have to do something.? Deuba had given the Maoists until today to come for talks, or he would be forced to call a vote they oppose. He said he was prepared to talk to the rebels, but would at the same time intensify the crackdown against them to pave the way for elections and force them to the negotiating table.

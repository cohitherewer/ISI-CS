 Fine Print

 Hillary for Prez

 Tokyo, Feb. 27 (AP): Former US President Bill Clinton today said his wife Hillary would be an excellent choice as the first female leader of the world?s most powerful nation.

 an interview with Japan?s TV Asahi, Clinton said he did not know whether his wife, the Senator of New York state, has any plans to one day run for the presidency, which has been held by 43 men but no women.

 ?I don?t know if she?ll run or not,? he told the network, but added ?she would make an excellent President, and I would always try to help her.?

 Hillary has said she plans to run for re-election as Senator in 2006. Speculation has periodically surfaced, however, that the 57-year-old former First Lady may have her sights set for the presidency in 2008. 

 Not Arnie

 Sacramento (California), (AP): Governor 

 Arnold Schwarzenegger said he never thought about running 

 for President, denying he is the reason behind talk of amending 

 the constitution so immigrants can occupy the White House. 

 ?I don?t think the idea is that all the push is because 

 of me. I mean, I have never thought about running for President, 

 and this is not my vision,? Schwarzenegger said on the TV 

 show This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Asked 

 why he predicted in 1977 he would become President, Schwarzenegger 

 suggested he was not serious. ?You?ve got to have a little 

 bit of sense of humour about all this,? he said.

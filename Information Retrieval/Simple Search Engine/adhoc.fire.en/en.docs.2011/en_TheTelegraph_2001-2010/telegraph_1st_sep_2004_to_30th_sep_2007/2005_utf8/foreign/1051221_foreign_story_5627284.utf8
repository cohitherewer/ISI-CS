 Sleeping rapist freed

 PAUL STOKES 

 London, Dec. 20: A man was cleared of raping a woman three times in a matter of minutes after a jury accepted yesterday that he was sleepwalking during the attack. 

 James Bilton, 22, admitted he must have had sex with the 22-year-old woman, but claimed he could not remember anything that had happened. 

 It is believed to be one of the first times the condition automania has been used as a successful defence in a sex case in Britain. 

 The pair had been friends for more than a year and had spent a night out drinking before returning to his flat. The woman fell asleep on the sofa before he woke her and put her to bed, saying he would sleep on the sofa. He kissed her on the forehead before leaving the room. She later realised he was lying beside her. He allegedly raped her three times. 

 She said his eyes looked unfocused. His eyes were really funny, she said. They were all over the place. I am not saying he was on drugs, but they looked as if he was. 

 She contacted a friend who called police next morning. Bilton said he had suffered from sleep-walking since he was 13. Its the only explanation I can come up with for this.

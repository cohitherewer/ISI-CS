 Fine Print

 Spears snaps

 New York, Oct. 22 (AP): Britney Spears threatened to take legal action after pictures of her newborn son popped up on the Internet, apparently stolen from a private photo shoot.

 At least two websites showed photos of Spears embracing her child, as well as a family portrait.

 good spirits after her breast cancer treatment, a statement 

 said. Released to dispel rumours that the singer had suffered

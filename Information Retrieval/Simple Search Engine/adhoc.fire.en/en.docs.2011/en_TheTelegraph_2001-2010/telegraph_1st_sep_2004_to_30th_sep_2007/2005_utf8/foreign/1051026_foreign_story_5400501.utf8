 Bush gift

 What should President George W. 

 Bush buy his wife for sticking with him through 28 years 

 of marriage? Diamonds, was the advice given 

 by military wives at a luncheon on Tuesday in Washington. 

 The best decision I ever made was marrying Laura in Midland, Texas, Bush said to applause.

 Some question whether or not it was the best decision she ever made, he said to laughter.

 Speaking about decisions, I got another decision to make, and maybe after lunch you can help me. And that is: What do I get her on the 28th anniversary?

 To which the shouted response was the gemstone of romance ? diamonds.

 Never mind, Bush joked.Sorry I asked.

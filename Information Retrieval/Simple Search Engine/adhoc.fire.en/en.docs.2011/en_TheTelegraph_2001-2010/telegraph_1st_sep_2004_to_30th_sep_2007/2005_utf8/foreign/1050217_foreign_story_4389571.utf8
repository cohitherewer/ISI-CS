 London caught in Nazi row

 Tony Blair

 London, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair urged London?s mayor today to apologise for ?Nazi? jibes which could threaten the city?s bid to host the Olympic Games.

 Blair said mayor Ken Livingstone should say sorry for asking a Jewish reporter from London?s Evening Standard newspaper if he was a ?German war criminal? during a confrontation last week.

 The row threatens to overshadow an Olympic commission visit to London this week to evaluate the British capital?s bid for the 2012 Games.

 Asked on Channel Five?s The Wright Stuff whether Livingstone should apologise, Blair said: ?Yes. That?s the simple answer. I know a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, he should apologise. Apologise and move on.?

 Blair?s comments echo angry calls for an apology from Britain?s Jewish community and Holocaust survivors.

 The outspoken mayor, who was once thrown out of Blair?s Labour Party, now faces an official probe which ultimately could decide to suspend or ban him from holding public office.

 However Livingstone, who will be accompanying the 13-man Olympic team until they finish their inspection on Saturday, has steadfastly refused to say sorry.

 He insists the remarks were not racist and instead accuses the Standard and its sister paper the Daily Mail of mounting a hate campaign against him. ?I could apologise but why should I say words I do not believe in my heart?? he said on Monday.

 The furore erupted after reporter Oliver Finegold accosted Livingstone as he left an official engagement. A row ensued in which the mayor asked him if he was a ?German war criminal?. When the reporter replied he was Jewish, Livingstone responded that he was acting like a ?concentration camp guard?.

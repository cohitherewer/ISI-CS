 Watch for MPs perfect sleep

 Go british: Venezuelan 

 President Hugo Chavez yawns at a meeting. 

 London, Dec. 28: A wristwatch that its makers claim can reduce tension and improve sleep is helping MPs cope with their stressful way of life. 

 Politicians from the three main parties are wearing Philip Stein Teslar electro-magnetic watches after a successful trial at Westminster. 

 In a test overseen by a Harley Street clinic, a cross-party group of 26 MPs took part in a month-long single blind trial, with some given activated watches and others unactivated watches. 

 Dr Nyjon Eccles, from the Chiron Clinic, said the watch was based on measuring heart rates and on a clinical questionnaire the results showed an improvement in those wearing the real watches. 

 There was a definite trend in those wearing the live watches for a reduction in stress and an improvement in sleep. 

 The watch pulses an electro-magnetic frequency of between seven to eight herz which is the Earths magnetic frequency. 

 Mark Lancaster, a Tory MP, said the watch seems to make me sleep more deeply, while another Conservative, Bob Spink, said he felt calmer. 

 Ian Gibson, a Labour MP and doctor, said: I would be very suspicious that any such mechanism with a magnetic field could have an effect on the personalities of humans.

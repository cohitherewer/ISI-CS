 Cannes, scrubbed for show

 Cannes, May 10 (Reuters): The yachts are scrubbed, the red carpet is rolled out, giant movie posters vie for attention on the seafront and long-suffering residents force a smile. Let Cannes, the worlds greatest film festival, begin.

 The 58th Festival de Cannes opens tomorrow in the glamorous Riviera resort, offering up the annual orgy of Hollywood glitz, showbiz excess and a bewildering number of films both in and out of competition. The biggest event of a packed 12-day programme promises to be the sixth and final installment of George Lucass Star Wars epic, which gets its world premiere in Cannes on Sunday. While not in the running for the coveted Palme dOr, Star Wars: Episode III ? Revenge of the Sith will get the star treatment in recognition of a series that changed cinema forever.

 Also appearing out of competition is Woody Allen, whose Match Point is set not in the veterans favoured Manhattan but in London, and stars Scarlett Johansson. Competing for the main prize are 21 films, and the selection of so many ?grands auteurs?, or established directors, has been interpreted as a deliberate attempt to put film back in the limelight ahead of heated political debate.

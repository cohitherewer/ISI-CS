 Fine Print

 Tower top, for love

 Tokyo, Oct. 2 (Reuters): A Japanese man made his way to a spot about 328 ft above ground on a famous Tokyo landmark today in what may have been a reckless attempt to impress a girl.

 Japanese private broadcaster TV Asahi showed footage of a man standing on an iron frame on the exterior of the 333-metre Tokyo Tower and unfurling a banner adorned with a large red heart and words that appeared to be the name of a girl. Maybe he intended this as a message for someone... I suspect thats the case since it had a heart on it, a Tokyo police official said.

 The man, who claims to be 31, came down from a spot around 100 metres high after being persuaded by police and was arrested for tresspasing. Just how he managed to get up there remains a mystery. Its not clear how he got in...and where he began his climb, he said. 

 Hilton halts wedding plan

 Washington (Reuters): Paris Hilton is breaking off her five-month-old engagement with tycoon Paris Latsis because I feel Im just not ready for marriage, the actor and hotel heiress said on Sunday in a statement. I have seen the breakups between people who love each other and rush into getting married too quickly and I do not want to make that mistake. Hilton had rejected his first engagement ring as the diamond was yellow, so another 24-carat emerald-cut diamond ring estimated to cost $2 million had been ordered.

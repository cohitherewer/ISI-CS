 Mexico, Venezuela sucked into big-two mess

 Hugo Chaez: Hard line

 Caracas (Venezuela), Nov. 14 (Reuters): Venezuela today ordered its ambassador recalled from Mexico in an escalating diplomatic dispute between President Hugo Chavez and his Mexican counterpart Vicente Fox over regional trade agreements.

 Mexico yesterday threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Venezuela and send Venezuelas envoy home if Caracas did not apologise after Chavez warned off Fox just days after branding him a lap dog of US imperialism.

 We have ordered the immediate return of our ambassador Vladimir Villegas, leaving our affairs... in the hands of a business attache, Venezuelan foreign minister Ali Rodriguez said.

 Days after branding Fox a lapdog of US imperialism for backing Washingtons trade policies at the Summit of the Americas in Argentina, Chavez warned him: Dont mess with me, mister, because youll get pricked.

 One of Washingtons fiercest critics in Latin America, Chavez made the comments on his weekly television show Hello President, which is broadcast to millions of Venezuelans.

 The Venezuelan Presidents declarations hurt the dignity of the people and government of Mexico, Mexicos foreign ministry said.

 It said it would immediately withdraw its ambassador to Venezuela, unless it received a formal apology.

 The ministry said Chavezs comments yesterday took it by surprise because the two governments had agreed in talks between foreign ministers to try to patch up differences.

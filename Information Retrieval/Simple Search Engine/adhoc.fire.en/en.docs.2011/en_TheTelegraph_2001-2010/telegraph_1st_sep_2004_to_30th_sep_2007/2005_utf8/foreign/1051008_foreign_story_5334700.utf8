 Enter, the sumo gang

 Las Vegas, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Las Vegas knows how to host a heavyweight title fight, but the desert resort city has never seen giant, scantily-clad men square-off quite like this.

 Japans ancient sport, sumo wrestling, arrived at Americas gambling, sporting and entertainment mecca for an exhibition tournament starting today. Top-ranked wrestlers will face off in a three-day Grand Sumo Tournament where, to win a match, a wrestler weighing upward of 140 kg must push his opponent out of a dirt ring or shove him off his feet. 

 It is the first officially-sanctioned sumo tournament in the US in two decades and the organisers are betting that it will spark renewed interest in the 1,500-year-old sport. 

 I want people to fall in love with it, said Musashi-maru, a former yokozuna or grand champion.

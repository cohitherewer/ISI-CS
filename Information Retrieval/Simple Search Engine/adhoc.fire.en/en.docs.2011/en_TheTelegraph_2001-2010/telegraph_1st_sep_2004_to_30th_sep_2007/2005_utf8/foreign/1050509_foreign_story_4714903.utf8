 Sunni setback to Iraq cabinet

 Baghdad, May 8 (Reuters): Iraqs parliament approved six new ministers today hoping to fill the political void that has stoked the insurgency, but one minister turned down the job, leaving the cabinet still incomplete three months after polls.

 Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari had announced the cabinet was complete after months of bickering to agree on the balance of power between competing sectarian and ethnic blocs, and vowed to crack down on an escalating insurgency.

 But proposed human rights minister Hisham al-Shibli said he had been picked purely to placate Iraqs restive Sunni Arab minority, and said he was rejecting the post.

 ?This post was given to me without anyone consulting me. I was surprised when they nominated me. It was just because I am a Sunni,? he said. ?This is something I reject completely. I am a democratic figure ... and I am completely against sectarianism.?

 The Sunni Arab minority dominated Iraq during Saddam Husseins rule but was sidelined after the elections, when most Sunni Arabs stayed away from the polls due to a boycott and fears of insurgent violence. There are only 17 Sunni Arab lawmakers in the 275-member parliament.

 Wary of fuelling sectarian and ethnic tension and determined to defeat an insurgency dominated by Sunni Arab guerrillas, the Shia and Kurdish blocs that dominate parliament pledged to include several Sunni Arabs in their cabinet.

 The confusion over the human rights portfolio is the latest embarrassment for Iraqs leaders, who have infuriated many Iraqis by taking so long to agree a cabinet.

 Other appointments announced today included the important defence and oil ministries.

 Saadoun al-Dulaimi, a Sunni Arab former military officer with tribal ties to Iraqs rebellious western Anbar province, was named defence minister. The government hopes that putting a Sunni Arab in the post will help undermine the insurgency.

 A Sunni Arab was also appointed to the industry ministry, and a Sunni Arab deputy prime minister was named to join Shia and Kurdish deputies already appointed.

 A respected Shia official, Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, was named oil minister, a key post in the oil-rich nation.

 ?Our new motto in the ministry is fight corruption and boost production,? Bahr al-Uloum told a news conference.

 Jaafari had hoped that with a new cabinet fully in place, he would press ahead with efforts to defeat the insurgency. ?We will take all necessary steps to fight this monstrous phenomenon,? he said.

 But the debacle over the human rights post underlines the divisions in government that have hampered efforts to tackle violence. Insurgent attacks escalated over the past 10 days, with at least 300 people killed in suicide attacks and bombings.

 Gunmen assassinated senior transport ministry official Zobaa Yassin as he drove to work today, police said.

 Yesterday, al Qaidas network in Iraq hit a foreign security convoy with a car bomb in the heart of Baghdad, killing at least 22 people including two Americans, Brandon Thomas and Todd Venette, who worked for CTU Consulting. 

 The security firm said five of its employees were also wounded by two suicide car bombers.

 On Iraq, time for Bush to plead 

 Washington, Dec. 19 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush tonight made an unusually direct personal appeal to Americans not to give in to despair over Iraq, insisting we are winning despite a tougher-than-expected war.

 Confronting American doubts about the war, Bush said in an Oval Office address he recognised that people wondered whether the US mission had created more problems than it is solving. I do not expect you to support everything I do, Bush said in remarkably personal terms. But tonight I have a request: Do not give in to despair, and do not give up on this fight for freedom.

 Bush, struggling with low approval ratings and wide public discontent with the rising US death toll, said Iraqs election is a sign of progress in the war, which is costing taxpayers $6 billion a month.

 This was his fifth speech devoted to Iraq since November 30, part of a fierce White House offensive to confront criticism of the war head on. 

 Bush is facing questions about his move to allow eavesdropping on Americans with suspected ties to terrorists. In his remarks, Bush decried thedefeatism of some of his political rivals.

 Cash crunch on Pope mind

 Vatican City, April 27 (Reuters): Cash as much as congregations could be on Pope Benedict?s mind as he gets to grips with heading a financially troubled Vatican.

 The Roman Catholic church is the world?s largest and owns some of the world?s great art and architectural treasures, but it is failing to generate much in the way of money.

 The Vatican?s central administration, the Holy See, recorded a 9.6 million euro ($12.5 million) loss in 2003 as it fell into the red for the third straight year. Its revenues were just 203.7 million euros.

 Vatican City, the papal state that owns treasures such as Michelangelo?s frescoed Sistine Chapel, also lost money.

 The double deficit could have serious consequences. The Holy See runs more than 100 diplomatic missions around the globe and a cut in its budget could affect its ability to reach its flock.

 ?The hole in the Vatican finances is... a threat to whether it can operate on the current scale. They may not be able to expand or even may have to shut some missions,? said Clifford Longley, a writer on Catholic issues based in Britain.

 Returning the Holy See to the black would preserve the Catholic church?s infrastructure particularly in Africa and Latin America, where the religion is growing at its fastest. New priests from the developing world have become vital to offset falling number of clergy in Europe and North America.

 The Vatican?s cash crunch is a surprise to most visitors to the papal state in the heart of Rome. Inside its walls lie not only the Sistine Chapel but the 500-year-old collection of the Vatican Museums, one of the world?s finest.

 But Benedict can?t sell his way out of the Vatican?s liquidity crisis and hawk a Raphael or Caravaggio like a cash-strapped CEO. The Vatican has a policy not to sell its art. 

 Each piece is given only a 1 euro nominal price tag in the Vatican books, underlining that the works are valued purely for their religious and artistic merits.

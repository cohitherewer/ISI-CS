 Fine Print

 David?s trail

 London, April 27 (Reuters): Devotees of English soccer captain David Beckham have a new way to worship their hero ? a ?pilgrims? trail? round his humble London roots.

 Taking advantage of his global fame, a local council has created the ?Beckham Trail? including his birthplace, his school and the playing fields where he first learnt his trade.

 ?We?ve had a huge amount of interest from all over the world. People are fascinated by him and want to see where it all started,? said Waltham Forest council spokeswoman Emma Joy.

 Many tourists walking the two-hour trail in an otherwise unremarkable northeast London suburb are Japanese, no doubt inspired by Beckham and his pop star wife Victoria?s hard work promoting their image and products in Asia. Visitors from Spain, where Beckham currently plays for Real Madrid, have also shown a healthy interest, the council said.

 Ear itch

 Bangkok (Reuters): Doctors found around 

 50 maggots in the ears of an 84-year-old Thai man after 

 he went to hospital complaining of an itch. Wednesday?s 

 Nation newspaper said Anan Temtan, who lives in the 

 tsunami-hit southern resort island of Phuket, had used cotton 

 buds to relieve the itching, but had scratched so hard his 

 eardrums ruptured and started bleeding. ?We believe flies 

 might have gone inside his ears to lay eggs, which hatched 

 into larvae and caused the itching,? said Somsak Nonthasri, 

 the doctor who treated him. Somsak, who used tweezers and 

 a small suction device to remove the maggots, said Anan 

 would be kept in for observation for a while to make sure 

 no more eggs hatched.

 Rare birth

 Phoenix, Arizona (Reuters): An Arizona woman who agreed to be a surrogate mother for a couple unable to have children gave birth to five baby boys on Tuesday at a Phoenix hospital, officials said. Teresa Anderson delivered the rare quintuplets by Caesarean section within five minutes and without complications at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center. All five boys were reported to be doing well in an intensive care unit. Doctors said the quintuplets may be a record for a surrogate mother. ?There are no statistics kept on the number of quintuplet births to surrogate mothers,? said Dr John Elliott, who delivered the babies. ?Suffice to say, it?s incredibly rare.?

 Run-off vote likely in Iran polls

 Tehran, June 16 (Reuters): Campaigning in Irans tight presidential race ended today with moderate cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani leading a pack of seven, but unlikely to secure enough support to avert an unprecedented run-off vote.

 Rival young campaigners came together and clogged the capitals streets into the early morning in a final bid to win over undecided voters before tomorrows election.

 The vote could determine the fate of Irans nuclear stand-off with the West and ties with arch-foe the US, although whoever wins, real power in the country will still rest with conservative, anti-West religious authorities.

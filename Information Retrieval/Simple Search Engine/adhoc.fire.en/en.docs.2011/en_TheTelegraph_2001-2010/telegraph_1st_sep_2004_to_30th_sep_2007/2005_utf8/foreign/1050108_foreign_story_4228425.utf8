 China to end sex-selective abortion

Beijing, Jan. 7 (Reuters): China is to outlaw 

the selective abortion of female foetuses to correct an imbalance in the ratio 

of boys to girls that has grown since the one-child policy was introduced more 

than 20 years ago.

 Government figures show 119 boys are born in the world?s most populous country for every 100 girls, but Beijing has set the goal of reversing the imbalance by 2010, state media reported.

 China implemented the one-child policy in the early 1980s to curb its massive population ? which officially hit 1.3 billion yesterday ? but the restrictions have bolstered a traditional preference for baby boys.

 ?The government takes it as an urgent task to correct the gender imbalance of newborns,? the official Xinhua news agency quoted Zhang Weiqing, minister in charge of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, as saying.

 Paul gets High with kids, in space call

 Paul McCartney: Fine line

 Los Angeles, Nov. 11 (AP): Besides being a grandfather, a knight, and a former Beatle, Paul McCartney is now a childrens book author. 

 The 63-year-old singer entertained a young group of cute but squirmy elementary school students yesterday by reading an excerpt from his new book High in the Clouds and answering questions. Tomorrow, the rock star will provide the first-ever live wake-up call to the crew of the International Space Station.

 The reading got some unexpected responses from the young audience.

 In the first six pages of McCartneys book, about an industrious squirrel named Wirral (named after McCartneys hometown), Wirrals mother is crushed to death by a tree knocked down by nature-hating developers. From there, he sets off for the mythic animal-loving land of Animalia.

 Why did the author make such sad stories for children? asked one perplexed little boy. Caught off-guard, McCartney wrapped his arm around the boy and joked: To make children cry.

 But cheer up. Its going to be all right, he quickly added.

 McCartney co-wrote High in the Clouds with author Philip Ardagh, who was brought in after a first draft to finesse the book, McCartney said.

 The story was his own idea, McCartney said, and was inspired by his collaboration nearly 10 years ago with animator Geoff Dunbar on the animated short Tropic Island Hum. Dunbar also illustrated High in the Clouds.

 Its been my ambition for about 30 years to do a full-length animation film, McCartney said. The book became a substitute for a script.

 The rock icon said hes never read the book to his three grandchildren or his two-year-old daughter Beatrice. Beyond the initial death sequence, the story does get happier, he said.

 Id skip over that bit, with very little kids... My little ones too little., McCartney said. 

 Tomorrow, McCartney will provide the first-ever live wake-up call, two songs, to the crew of the International Space Station from his concert in Anaheim, California. Im singing English Tea from my new album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard. I have a cup of tea in the morning, so its something good to wake up to, McCartney said. The other song will be the Beatles classic Good Day Sunshine.

 Virus spread fuels fear

 SEBASTIEN BERGER AND ROGER HIGHFIELD,

 Hanoi, April 16: The threat of a killer flu pandemic is greater than ever because of the spread of the bird flu virus in southeast Asia, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.

 Avian influenza is still spreading, despite countermeasures, and the possibility of a global epidemic that could kill millions is said to be more likely than not. 

 More than 50 people have died from the H5N1 virus in southeast Asia, most of them in Vietnam, where tens of thousands raise poultry in small backyard farms. In its current form, the virus is difficult for humans to contract, but if it changes its genetic make-up, it could spread rapidly.

 If the virus infects a person who has a human flu virus, the two may shuffle their genes to create a deadly mix. A new strain could combine the lethal effects of the bird virus with the ability to spread easily among people supplied by the human virus.

 The WHO computer models suggest that a pandemic of H5N1 would kill between 2 million and 7.4 million within 12 months in a ?best case scenario? based on the ?mild? pandemic of 1968.

 But if it were similar to the 1918 pandemic, the models estimate a much higher total. Peter Horby, the WHO medical epidemiologist in Hanoi, said that while the mortality rate from H5N1 infections was falling, the virus appeared to be adapting to human hosts, which was taken to be an indication that transmission between humans would become easier.

 ?The fact that it?s been around for a year and we haven?t seen a pandemic is no reason to be complacent,? he said. ?I?m more concerned than I was a year ago.? He said the probability of a pandemic at ?more than 50 per cent?. 

 Dr Klaus Stohr, the WHO global influenza programme chief, reported an increase in the number of cluster cases reported recently, with the biggest a family of five cases.

 Korea rejects N-test reports

 Seoul, May 10 (Reuters): Reports it could soon conduct an underground nuclear weapons test were speculation cooked up by Washington, North Korea said today, but the secretive state did not deny outright that one might be planned.

 Media reports have said spy satellites show North Korea has apparently stepped up activity in its northeastern region of Kilju. The area has been suspected of being where the North would conduct a test. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper in a commentary did not deny North Korea might conduct a test.

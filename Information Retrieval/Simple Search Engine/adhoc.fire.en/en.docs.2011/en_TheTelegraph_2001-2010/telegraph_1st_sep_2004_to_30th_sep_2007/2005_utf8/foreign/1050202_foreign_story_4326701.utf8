 Cervical cancer vaccine soon

 London, Feb. 1 (Reuters): A vaccine that could prevent young women from developing most cases of cervical cancer could be on the market within a few years.

 Researchers are testing dozens of vaccines against different types of cancer but those that protect women against strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), which are linked to more than 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases, are the most advanced.

 ?I believe there will be an HPV vaccine sometime in the next few years,? Anne Szarewski, a clinical consultant at Britain?s Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine, said. Results from early trials of two separate vaccines developed by drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline and Merck, which protect against HPV infection, have been promising.

 HPV is a sexually transmitted infection. More than 75 per cent of women are infected with HPV at some time during their lives. It usually lasts for a short time and produces no symptoms.

 But in some women it can progress to cervical cancer, one of the most common cancers in women. Each year 470,000 women around the world are diagnosed with the disease and 230,000, mostly in the developing world, die, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France. There are more than 100 types of HPV virus, but HPV 16 and 18 are linked to the majority of cervical cancers.

 ?We don?t know how long the immunity will last,? said Szarewski. ?We hope it will deliver lifetime protection against cervical cancer.?

 Developed countries have screening programmes to detect early signs of cervical cancer, which has a good cure rate if it is diagnosed early. Szarewski said an HPV vaccine would have enormous potential in poor countries where screening is not available. She is beginning Phase III trials of one of the vaccines in 300 women aged 15-25.

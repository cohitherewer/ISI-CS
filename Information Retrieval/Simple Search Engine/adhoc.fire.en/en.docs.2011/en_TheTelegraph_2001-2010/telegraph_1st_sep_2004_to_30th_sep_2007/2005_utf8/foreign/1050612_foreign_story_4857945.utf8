 Washington Elizas get elocution classes

 Washington, June 11 (Reuters): Latter-day Eliza Doolittles, carefully enunciating station stops like Pentagon and LEnfant Plaza, today joined the first elocution class for workers in Washingtons beleaguered transit system.

 I heard a T over there, class teacher Doris McMillon said severely as the group intoned LEnfant Plaza.

 The typical pronunciation for that station on the US capitals Metro trains is La-font Plaza, but McMillon, a former television and radio anchor, stressed the French pronunciation, with no final T sound: Lohn-fon Plaza.

 But she wanted to hear the T when they said Pentagon. Too often, McMillon said, it came out Pen-a-gon, which in the Washington area is more than a five-sided military headquarters ? it is a major transfer hub for trains and buses.

 Washingtons 29-year-old Metro system gets hundreds of complaints a year, most about delayed trains, but complaints of inaudible or unintelligible train announcements are among the biggest gripes, with 168 registered from April 2004 to March of this year, Metro spokeswoman Candace Smith said.

 Smith acknowledged elocution was not the only problem, because the original public address system is outdated and in need of an upgrade. She said there were plans to move Metros loudspeakers from their high perch ? where they send sound bouncing around stations and often make it garbled ? to a lower level closer to riders ears.

 Washington is hardly alone in spurring this kind of complaint. Commuters in New York city have groused for years about announcements that give only tantalising hints at critical information.

 Now some New York subways have upgraded public address systems that offer clearer, more timely announcements, replacing the squawky talk that frequently left patrons wondering where they were and what was happening when the train stopped. On some lines, there are pre-recorded announcements.

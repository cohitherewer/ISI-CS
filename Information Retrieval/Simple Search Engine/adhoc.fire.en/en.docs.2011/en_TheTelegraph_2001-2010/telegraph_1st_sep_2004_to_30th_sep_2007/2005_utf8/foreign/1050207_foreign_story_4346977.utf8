 Policeman killed, 10 injured in Bangla clashes

 Dhaka, Feb. 6 (Reuters): A policeman was killed and 10 people were injured in sporadic clashes during a nationwide strike in Bangladesh today, the sixth in two weeks called by the country?s main opposition party.

 The clashes erupted in Sherpur town, 200 km north of Dhaka, as police tried to chase away hundreds of activists, local reporters said.

 ?Police constable Ashraf Siddiqui died after being hit by a piece of brick hurled by a strike activist,? a Sherpur police officer said. Two of the injured were also policemen, he said. Police and paramilitary troops patrolled the streets of capital Dhaka and other main cities as the latest strike called by the opposition Awami League got underway.

 Security forces were on high alert after four journalists were injured in a bomb attack on a press club in Khulna last night.

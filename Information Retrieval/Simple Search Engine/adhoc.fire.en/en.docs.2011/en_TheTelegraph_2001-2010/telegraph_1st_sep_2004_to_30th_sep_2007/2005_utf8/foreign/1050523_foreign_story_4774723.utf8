 Death wish

 Cannes, May 22 (Reuters): Spanish actor Penelope Cruz hopes the more times she dies on screen, the longer shell live.

 I dont care if I die in every movie, she said. I look for something that is going to make me feel alive as a woman, as an actress, Cruz said of her role in her latest film Chromophobia, as a prostitute who passes away after suffering from cancer.

 Other films in which Cruzs character died, or at least may have died amid some ambiguity, include Open Your Eyes, All About My Mother and Vanilla Sky. Its true that I die a lot of times on screen, she said. Some people say it extends your own (life), so I hope its true.

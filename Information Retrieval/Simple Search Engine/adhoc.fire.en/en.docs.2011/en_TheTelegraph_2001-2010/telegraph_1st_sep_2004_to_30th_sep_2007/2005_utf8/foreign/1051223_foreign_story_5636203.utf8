 EU fine cloud on Microsoft

 Brussels, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Europes competition regulator today threatened software giant Microsoft with daily fines for failing to comply with antitrust sanctions a year after a top European Union court ruled it must obey.

 The European Commission said it may fine Microsoft up to 2 million euros a day unless it complies with an order to provide key information to allow rivals group servers to work with its ubiquitous Windows operating system.

 I have given Microsoft every opportunity to comply with its obligations. However, I have been left with no alternative other than to proceed via the formal route to ensure its compliance, EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

 The Brussels EU executive said Microsoft had time till January 25, to show it was in compliance with the EU demands. Any fines would be backdated to December 15, the statement said.

 Microsoft called the move unjustified and said it was doing its best to obey the European antitrust watchdogs landmark March 2004 ruling, but that Brussels kept piling on new demands.

 The company vowed to contest the latest decision to the full extent allowed by EU law, including by demanding an oral hearing, which can take months to organise, stringing out the procedure.

 The commission ruled in 2004 Microsoft had abused its global dominance by leveraging its near monopoly in the market for PC operating systems and for media players to squelch rivals. 

 It imposed a 497 million-euro fine and forced Microsoft to sell a version of Windows without the Windows Media Player software.

 What is at stake now is the decision requiring Microsoft to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow non-Microsoft work group servers to gain full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers.

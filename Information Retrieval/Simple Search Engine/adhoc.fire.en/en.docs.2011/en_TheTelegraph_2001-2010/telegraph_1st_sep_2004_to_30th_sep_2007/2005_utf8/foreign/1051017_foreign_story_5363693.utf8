 Nepal boycott

 Kathmandu, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Nepals oldest political party today said it would boycott planned parliamentary elections because free polls were impossible under King Gyanendras regime.

The monarch (in picture on left), condemned 

at home and abroad for seizing power in February, said last week that he would 

hold polls by April 2007 ? five years later than scheduled.

 This unconstitutional government cannot hold any elections, said Ram Chandra Poudel, a top leader of the Nepali Congress. Well actively boycott the elections. This also means we will campaign against the elections and go door to door urging people not to participate, he said.

 Poudel said the seven major parties that had already agreed to boycott the municipal elections set for February, would soon chalk out a strategy to derail plans for the national polls.

 The parties have formed an alliance to fight Gyanendras direct rule and staged almost daily, often violent, street protests in the capital Kathmandu demanding he restore parliament disbanded in 2002 and hand power back to political parties.

 The demonstrations have been suspended this month due to the Hindu festival season of Dasain and Diwali. The king fired the government and took absolute power on February 1, vowing to crush a Maoist revolt against his rule.

 China firms up Pak ties

 - Trade tops Wen agenda

 Islamabad, April 5 (Reuters): Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began a tour of South Asia in Pakistan today, reinforcing a strategic alliance between the old friends and signing a range of agreements on economic and trade cooperation.

 Wen arrived with a 70-strong delegation of business people and officials and was greeted by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. 

 ?This is a very meaningful day which marks a new stage in Pakistan-China relations,? he said after talks with Aziz.

 Tomorrow, Wen will deliver a keynote address to an Asian ministerial meeting and travel to Lahore on Thursday before heading to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India.

 Analysts said China and Pakistan would reaffirm their long-standing close political ties but booming China?s economic concerns were expected to dominate Wen?s agenda. 

 Among more than 20 agreements signed today was a treaty of friendship and a pact on combating terrorism and separatism.

 ?Both countries have committed themselves to carry forward their strategic partnership in the interests of ... peace,? Aziz said. The treaty bound both to support each others? efforts to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity, a Pakistani official said.

 Despite the reiteration of strategic ties analysts say China is now dealing with the region on a pragmatic basis, with economics setting the agenda, and Pakistan could no longer take a special relationship with China for granted.

 Underlining that, 15 of the agreements today were on trade and investment. ?There?s huge potential,? Wen said when asked about prospects for trade.

 Pakistani officials said the agreements involved Chinese investment of about $350 million.

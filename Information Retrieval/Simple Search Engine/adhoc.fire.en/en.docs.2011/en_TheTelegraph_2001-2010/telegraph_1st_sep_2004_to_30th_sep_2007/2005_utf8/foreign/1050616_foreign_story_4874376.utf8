 New memo doubts Annan credibility

 Annan: Sticky scandal 

 United Nations, June 14 (Reuters): A newly disclosed memo appeared to cast doubt on UN secretary-general Kofi Annans insistence he was unaware of a bid by a Swiss firm that employed his son for a lucrative contract under the scandal-tainted UN oil-for-food programme.

 UN-appointed investigators were urgently reviewing the memo, Michael Holtzman, a spokesman for the Independent inquiry committee led by former US federal reserve chairman Paul Volcker, said yesterday. The memo described a late-November 1998 Paris meeting of Annan with officials of Cotecna Inspection Services, just weeks before the Geneva-based company won the contract.

 The contract has become a focus of Annans critics, including several US Republican lawmakers who have accused him of mismanagement and called for his resignation.

 Chief UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan had no recollection of any such meeting during the trip to Paris, for a summit of French-speaking world leaders.

 Annans son, Kojo Annan, was a Cotecna consultant at the time of the encounter described in the memo, but it was unclear whether Kojo was present at the encounter. The document was written by Michael Wilson, a family friend of the Annans who was at the time a senior Cotecna executive.

 The one-page December 4, 1998, e-mail, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, was addressed to top Cotecna executives and devoted just two sentences to the UN contract matter.

 It stated: We had brief discussions with the SG and his entourage. Their collective advise (sic) was that we should respond as best as we could to the Q amp;A session of the (sic) 1-12-98 and that we could count on their support. The memo was first disclosed by the New York Times.

 Annan, in Paris yesterday, has no recollection of any such exchange, Eckhard said. A view that the UN would support Cotecnas bid could not have come from the secretary-general because he had no knowledge that Cotecna was a contender for that contract, the spokesman said.

 Cotecna officials later attended a question-and-answer session on the UN bidding in New York on December 1, 1998, ? the meeting the memo was apparently referring to. Wilson, in a second memo obtained by Reuters, said the session went well.

 Our chances of getting the contract are very good. We presented a sound technical tender competitively priced. With the active backing of the Swiss Mission in New York and effective but quite (sic) lobbying within the diplomatic circles in New York, we can expect a positive outcome to our efforts, Wilson wrote.

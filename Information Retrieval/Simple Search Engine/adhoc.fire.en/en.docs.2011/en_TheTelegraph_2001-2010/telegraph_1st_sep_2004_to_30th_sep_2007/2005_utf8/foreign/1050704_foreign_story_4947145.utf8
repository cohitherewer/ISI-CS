Nasa craft closes in for deep comet impact

 An artists impression of the comet 

and the spacecraft 

Los Angeles, July 3: Nasas Deep Impact 

spacecraft is closing in on its historic rendezvous with comet Tempel 1, a 

culmination of what Jet Propulsion Laboratory Director Charles Elachi called one 

of the most daring and risky missions we have ever undertaken. 

If all goes well, the spacecrafts 820-pound 

impactor will smash into the comets core at 0552 GMT (1122 IST) on Monday. 

The cosmic collision and its aftermath will be observed by three telescopes in 

orbit and every major telescope on the Earths surface. 

Images of the collision will provide not only the 

most detailed pictures we have ever seen of a comet, said Lindley Johnson, 

the programme executive, but also a first glimpse of the material inside a comet. 

That, in turn, could give valuable new information about the formation of the 

solar system. 

Researchers at JPL north of downtown Los Angeles are 

all sitting on the edge of their seats, said Rick Grammier, the project 

manager. If I could bottle all the adrenaline Ive seen in the last 

couple of days, I wouldnt have to sleep for a year. 

Their target is a jet-black, pickle-shaped icy 

dirtball the size of Washington, D.C., said JPLs Don Yeomans, a co-investigator 

for the mission. It is about nine miles long and three miles wide. 

Deep Impacts goal of crashing a small 

probe into a comet is unprecedented. Scientists have compared the mission to trying 

to hit one speeding bullet with a second, while trying to observe the process 

with a third bullet. 

Thats not quite a fair comparison, Elachi said. 

The spacecraft and comet actually are moving 20 times faster than the fastest 

bullet. To make it even more challenging, he added, scientists want to strike 

Tempel 1 on its sunny side so they will be able to observe the effects of the 

collision better. 

There are no trails for us to follow, 

he said. 

So far, the mission has gone perfectly. Deep Impact, 

launched on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida on 

January 12, has been streaking across the solar system at nearly 50,000 mph to 

intercept Tempel 1 near its perihelion ? the closest point in its orbit to the 

sun ? just short of the orbit of Mars, about 83 million miles from Earth. 

After it releases the impactor, the compact-car-sized 

mother ship will fire its thrusters to slow down by about 220 mph so that it misses 

the comet, coming no closer than about 300 miles from the comets nucleus. 

The battery-powered impactor, which has its own guidance 

system and thrusters, will settle into Tempel 1s orbit, waiting to be overtaken 

from behind at a relative speed of about 23,000 mph. It is capable of making three 

manoeuvres on its own over the last two hours to ensure that it strikes the comet 

properly. 

The craft will take progressively sharper pictures 

of the nucleus and transmit them to the mother ship for relay to Earth. The last 

one could be snapped as few as three seconds before impact, said Monte Henderson, 

the Deep Impact programme manager for Boulder, Colorado-based Ball Aerospace 

 amp; Technologies Corp, which built the craft. 

Meanwhile, the mother ship will be monitoring the 

collision and aftermath with its own telescope and other instruments to identify 

the composition of ejected materials. 

If, for some unforeseen reason, the impactor does 

not separate from the mother ship, engineers will crash the entire assembly into 

the comet, Grammier said. That will yield a larger impact but produce somewhat 

less information, he said. 

Images from Deep Impact should be spectacular, 

Yeomans said. The 1986 Giotto spacecraft that flew by Halleys comet 

could resolve objects about twice the size of a football field. The 2004 Stardust 

mission to comet Wild-2 could reveal objects about a quarter the size of the 

field. 

Deep Impact will resolve objects the 

size of a football, Yeomans said. 

Comets are so valuable scientifically because they 

are leftover matter from the formation of the planets about 4.6 billion years 

ago. They have circled the sun on the far fringes of the solar system ever since. 

Occasionally, gravitational forces perturb a comets 

orbit, causing it to drop into the inner solar system, where it circles the sun 

for several cycles before dissipating. 

The materials inside Tempel 1s nucleus have 

not seen the light of day for 4.6 billion years, said Jessica M. Sunshine, 

a co-investigator from San Diego-based Science Applications International Corp. 

They are a perfectly frozen specimen from our distant 

past. Its pretty well certain we are, in fact, made up of cometary 

stuff, Yeomans said.

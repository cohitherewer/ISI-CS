 5 killed in Karachi suicide raid

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 30: Five people were killed, including two assailants, in a suicide bombing inside a Shia mosque in Karachi today.

 At least a dozen people were wounded in the attack at the Mandinatul Ilm mosque in the middle-class Gulshan-e-Iqbal area of Karachi, hospital officials said.

 This was the second suicide bombing against Shias during the last three days. On Friday, a suicide bombing at a Muslim festival in Islamabad killed 19 people, mostly Shias. 

 A senior police official in Karachi said that those killed in the bombing included the attacker himself, an accomplice, a private security guard, a police official and a civilian. He said the attacker blew himself up when a policeman deployed on security duty intercepted him at the mosque during evening prayers.

 Mobs of angry Shia youths stoned and set fire to a nearby outlet of the American fast food chain KFC and also attacked a hospital and two petrol stations.

 Brando book

 New York, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Actor Marlon Brando has been immortalised in film for playing a Mafia boss, a luckless boxer and a rebellious biker, but 14 months after his death he is now also an author of a swashbuckling pirate novel.

 Fan-Tan, a pulp fiction novel authored by Brando and a longtime associate, movie director Donald Cammell, arrived on bookshelves this week after their unfinished manuscript was polished by film historian David Thomson and published by Random House imprint Alfred A. Knopf.

 Iraq draft sparks Shia violence

 Baghdad, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Several Iraqis died overnight in Shia clashes in the south, apparently triggered by differences over a constitution draft that parliament was meant to back today.

 Supporters of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has denounced the draft, clashed with pro-government police and rival Shia militias in the holy city of Najaf and other southern towns. Clashes broke out last night between Sadrs armed followers and a crowd who burned down his offices in Najaf, killing at least six people.

 That sparked violence in Baghdad and Shia towns across southern Iraq, as members of the pro-Sadr Mehdi Army militia attacked offices of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution and its Badr militia. SCIRI is headed by Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a powerful Shia cleric.

 The Shia-dominated parliament was due to sit today to back the charter that has already provoked warnings of civil war from Sunnis.

 However, parliamentary officials said they did not know when ? or even if ? the National Assembly would convene as a three-day breathing space for final negotiations expires. 

 Sadr, who led two uprisings last year, demanded that a rival Islamist leader condemn his own followers over the deadly Shia infighting that rocked Najaf. I demand that brother Abdul Aziz al-Hakim make an official announcement condemning the aggression by his representatives and some extremists, Sadr said.

 But the violence, coming on top of a bloody show of force by Sunni insurgents on Baghdads streets yesterday, may dent government hopes of a smooth passage for the constitution in an October referendum.

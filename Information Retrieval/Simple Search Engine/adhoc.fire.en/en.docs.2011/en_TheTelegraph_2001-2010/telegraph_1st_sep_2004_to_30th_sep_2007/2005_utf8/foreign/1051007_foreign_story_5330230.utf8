 Not family yet, but in the family way

 Cruise and Holmes: Excited

 Los Angeles, Oct. 6 (Reuters): Tom Cruise and fiancee Katie Holmes are expecting a baby six months into a whirlwind romance that has turned the once intensely private Cruise into a giddy and very public lover.

 News of the pregnancy was first reported by People magazine yesterday. A statement from Cruises publicist, his sister Lee Anne DeVette, added: Tom and Katie are very excited, and the entire family is very excited. Holmes, she said, has never felt better.

 No wedding date for the couple has been set and no details about the sex of the baby or the due date were available. The child would be Cruises first biological child. He adopted two children with actor Nicole Kidman before their marriage ended in divorce in 2001.

 Twice married Cruise, 43, and Holmes, 27, began dating in mid-April but far from keeping their relationship low key, Cruise became the butt of jokes in May after he jumped over a couch in a manic appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show and declared his passion for his new girlfriend.

 He proposed to Holmes in June at the Eiffel Tower in Paris and announced their engagement the next day at a news conference.

 The high jinks prompted suspicion that their relationship was a publicity stunt to promote their summer films ? War of the Worlds for Cruise and Batman Begins for Holmes.

 Cruise rejected the jibes.Its amusing at first. Its funny. But then you sit back and realise how sad it is that there are people who cant even imagine feeling like this. But my friends are happy for me. The people who know me are happy. My mom is happy. My family is happy, he said.

 Holmes made her name in the TV show Dawsons Creek. She ended a five-year relationship with American Pie actor Chris Klein in early 2005.

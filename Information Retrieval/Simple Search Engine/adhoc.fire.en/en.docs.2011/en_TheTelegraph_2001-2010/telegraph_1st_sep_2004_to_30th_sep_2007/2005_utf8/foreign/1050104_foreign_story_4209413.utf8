 Nepal union in comrade ultimatum

 Kathmandu, Jan. 3 (Reuters): A Nepali labour union, considered close to Maoist rebels fighting the monarchy, threatened today to intensify its struggle if the government failed to provide information on missing comrades by next week.

 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has given the Maoists until January 13 to begin peace talks aimed at ending an eight-year revolt in Nepal in which more than 11,000 people have died. 

 ?We want to warn that we will launch a strong struggle if our demands are not fulfilled by January 13,? the All Nepal Federation of Trade Unions said. 

 The statement had no details, but the group had forced dozens of Nepali firms to close for several weeks in August.

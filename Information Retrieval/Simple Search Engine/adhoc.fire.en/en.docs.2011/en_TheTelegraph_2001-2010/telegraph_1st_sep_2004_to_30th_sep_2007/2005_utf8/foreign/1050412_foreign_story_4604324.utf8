 Ransom whiff in Pak envoy snatch

 Islamabad, April 11 (Reuters): A kidnapped employee of the Pakistani embassy in Iraq is safe and is probably being held for ransom, a Pakistani government spokesman said today.

 Malik Mohammad Javed, a Pakistani assistant at the embassy who does not have diplomatic status, went missing in Baghdad on Saturday.

 ?Javed is absolutely safe,? foreign ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani said. 

 A man telephoned the Pakistani embassy in Baghdad yesterday claiming to represent a group called Omar bin Khattab and said it was holding the man. 

 Jilani declined to say if the group holding Malik had made any demands. But he said the motive appeared to be financial, not political.

 Red Cross for prisoner access

 Geneva, Nov. 3 (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called today for access to all foreign terrorism suspects held by the US after a report of a covert CIA prison system for al Qaida captives.

 The Washington Post said yesterday the CIA had been hiding and interrogating inmates at a secret facility in eastern Europe, among so-called black sites in eight countries under a global network set up after the September 11, 2001, attacks.

 We are concerned at the fate of an unknown number of people captured as part of the so-called global war on terror and held at undisclosed places of detention, Antonella Notari, chief ICRC spokeswoman, said in response to a question.

 Access to detainees is an important humanitarian priority for the ICRC and a logical continuation of our current work in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, she added.

 Also in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Committee said it had received two letters and a report from the US which it hoped would address the issue of detainees being held outside the country.

 It was in our request to the US. We are going to see how they answer, committee chairwoman Christine Chanet for France said.

 The European Commission said today it would look into media reports naming two east European countries as allowing the CIA to hold al Qaida suspects outside of any national or international legal jurisdiction.

 Friso Roscam Abbing, spokesman for European Justice and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini, said the EU executive would check the reports with Poland, a new member state, and Romania, which is due to join the EU in 2007. 

 The US-based campaign organisation Human Rights Watch said earlier it had indications the two were hosting CIA prisons.

 Both denied the allegations today and the commissions Abbing said it had no knowledge of any such prisons at present.

 Sing to help you drive better

 London, July 19 (Reuters): Motorists who enjoy a sing-along while driving tend to concentrate more and fall asleep less than their silent counterparts, new research showed today.

 However, drivers should avoid overly rousing tunes or complex rhythms which can divert attention away from the road. Singing while driving stimulates not only the mind but also the body which in turn produces heightened alertness and reduced fatigue, said Nicola Dibben, a music psychologist from the University of Sheffield.

 She said music was more effective than silence, conversation or talk radio in achieving an optimal state of alertness.

 Singing may be less distracting than conversation because drivers recall words to songs they already know, or because it is fairly easy to learn the words to music where it uses repeated lyrics.

 Driving enhancing music might include such favourites as Dont Cha Wanna Ride by soul sensation Joss Stone.

 or the slow-paced classical rondo Canon in D by Pachelbel.

 But tunes like The Prodigys Firestarter or Elgars Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 should be avoided, as they divert motorists attention away from the roads, lead to greater driver aggression and reckless motoring behaviour, Dibben said.

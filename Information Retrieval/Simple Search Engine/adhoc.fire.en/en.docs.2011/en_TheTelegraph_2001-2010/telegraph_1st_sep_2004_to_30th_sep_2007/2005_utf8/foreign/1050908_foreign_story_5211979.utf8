 Bangla crackdown

 Dhaka, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Bangladesh police raided hotels, conducted random checks of people on the street and detained about 25 people across the country to try to thwart more attacks after a wave of bombings, officials said today.

 More than 500 bombs went off across the country on August 17, killing two people and wounding about 100, in a coordinated attack blamed on a banned Islamic party.

 The elite Rapid Action Battalion of the police, using sniffer dogs and metal detectors, searched cars and pedestrians, especially near Dhakas diplomatic areas, today. Security was tightened at airports, rail stations and ferry terminals. Police said 25 people were taken into custody nationwide yesterday.

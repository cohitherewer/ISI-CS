 Jazeera channel for children

 Doha, Sept. 10 (AFP): The al Jazeera Arab satellite channel, known for broadcasting taped messages by al Qaida leaders, has launched a new childrens channel to combine entertainment with teaching tolerance.

 The Al Jazeera Childrens Channel hopes to be a first in the Arab world, as the Qatar-based television network bids to overcome criticism by the US and conservative Arab regimes over alleged bias in its news broadcasts. It will take some time, said the executive director of the channel, Mahmoud Buneb, who stressed that this channel will be different.

 Children adore American cartoons. We will provide subdued, calm content, he said in an interview.

 Arabic-language childrens programming can already be seen on MBC3, a Saudi-based channel that belongs to al Jazeeras rival al Arabiya, and satellite dishes make Cartoon Network-type kids shows widely available.

 But the goal of al Jazeeras youth channel is to teach modern values such as open-mindedness and tolerance to Arab children age three to 15 and their families, organisers said.

 We are embarking on a television project that will, we hope, be viewed by television viewers, families and children alike, Buned said. However, there are no taboos, he said, citing an upcoming programme on female genital circumcision featuring women who were victims of the practice.

 The channel has been in the works for three years, and is a joint venture between al Jazeera and the Qatar foundation for education, science and community development. 

 The Indian embassy in Qatar has started a 24-hour emergency consular service to help Indians stranded at the Doha International Airport. The service is available to the indians who face problems related to their passports.

 Military school for William

 Prince William: Call to arms

 London, March 6 (AFP): Prince William will follow his younger brother Harry to Britain?s elite Sandhurst military academy, the Sunday Times reported.

 William, who graduates from Saint Andrews university in Scotland in June, would enrol at the military school in January 2006, when Harry would be starting his third term of a year-long course, it said.

 Twenty-year-old Harry was accepted last year at Sandhurst, after declaring a desire to follow his father and grandfather into the military. 

 William, 22, also revealed in an interview last November that he was using Harry as a ?guinea pig? at Sandhurst while contemplating a future military career.

 The Sunday Times also reported that William was poised to lose his protected status from Britain?s invasive media when he graduated from Saint Andrews in June.

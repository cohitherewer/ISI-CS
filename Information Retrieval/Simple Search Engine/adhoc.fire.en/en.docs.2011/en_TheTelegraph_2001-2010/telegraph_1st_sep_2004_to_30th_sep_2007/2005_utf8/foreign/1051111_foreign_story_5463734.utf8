 Amman, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Ashraf al-Akhras was celebrating his wedding with friends and family when a bomb tore through the luxury Amman hotel, killing 10 of his relatives and turning the banqueting hall into a scene of despair instead of joy.

 Akhrass father and nine other family members died in one of yesterdays closely synchronised attacks on three hotels in the Jordanian capital.I was getting married, it was my wedding, the distraught groom said. The explosion happened the moment we entered the wedding hall.

 Security officials say over 250 festively dressed guests were celebrating in the banquet room on the ground floor of the Radisson SAS hotel when a young man wearing an explosive vest blew himself up in the crowded hall.

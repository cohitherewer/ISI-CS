 Vow to end farm subsidy

 Gleneagles, July 8 (Reuters): G8 leaders pledged today to end farm export aid and renewed their political backing for a further phase of trade liberalisation under the so-called Doha Round of negotiations by the end of next year.

 The commitment on farm export subsidies, something demanded by African states and others, was made in a communique issued at a Group of Eight summit at the Gleneagles hotel in Scotland. 

 But it set no specific deadline, which may disappoint other nations looking for a rapid end to trade-distorting aid.

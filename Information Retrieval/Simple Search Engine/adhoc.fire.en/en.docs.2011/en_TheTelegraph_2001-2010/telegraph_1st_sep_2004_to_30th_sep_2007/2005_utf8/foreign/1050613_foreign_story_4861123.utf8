 First woman in Kuwait cabinet

 Kuwait, June 12 (Reuters): Kuwait named its first woman cabinet minister today, less than a month after giving women the vote, a key plank in its democratic reforms.

 Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah announced rights activist Massouma al-Mubaraks appointment as planning minister and minister of state for administrative development affairs, state news agency KUNA reported. Naming a Kuwaiti woman as a minister ... is a special step we had longed to achieve, Sheikh Sabah said.

 Kuwait made another breakthrough earlier this month when it appointed two women to its municipal council, the first women to take seats there. In May, despite fierce resistance by Islamist and conservative MPs, parliament gave Kuwaiti women the right to vote and run in elections.

 Mubarak, a 57-year-old columnist and political science professor at Kuwait University, said she was honoured. My appointment as the first Kuwaiti female minister indicates that Kuwaiti women have the capabilities that allow them to occupy various positions, she said.

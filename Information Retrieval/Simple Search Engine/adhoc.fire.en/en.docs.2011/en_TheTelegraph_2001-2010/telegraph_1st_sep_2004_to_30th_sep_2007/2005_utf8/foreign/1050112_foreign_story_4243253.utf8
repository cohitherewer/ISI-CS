 Outspoken Zhao in hospital

 Beijing, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Zhao Ziyang, toppled as China?s Communist Party chief for opposing the army crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations, is in hospital, the government and sources close to the family said today.

 Zhao, 85, has been confined to his courtyard home in Beijing for more than 15 years, but current leaders remain nervous about the residual influence of modern China?s icon of reform, fearing his death could spark widespread protests.

 The government dismissed Hong Kong newspaper reports that Zhao had died of respiratory and heart failure in Beijing on Saturday. ?Zhao Ziyang is an old man who is over 80. He fell ill, but after attentive treatment, his condition is currently stable,? spokesman Kong Quan said.

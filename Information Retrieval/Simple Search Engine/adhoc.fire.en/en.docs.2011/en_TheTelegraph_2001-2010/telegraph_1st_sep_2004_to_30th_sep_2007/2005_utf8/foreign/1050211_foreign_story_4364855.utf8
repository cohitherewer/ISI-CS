 Analysts sceptical

 Kim Jong-il

 Seoul, Feb. 10 (Reuters): North Korea?s declaration that it possesses nuclear weapons does not necessarily mean it has a tested nuclear weapons system that can be deployed, defence analysts said today.

 North Korea made the first official declaration of possessing nuclear weapons today and said it was suspending participation in six-country talks on its nuclear programmes because the US was hardening it stand.

 ?It is one thing to talk about having a weapon and it?s a different matter to talk about a complete nuclear weapons system,? said Baek Seung-joo, who heads research on the North Korean military at South Korea?s Institute for Defence Analyses.

 North Korea has test fired short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, but its missile programme has been marred by accidents.

 The reliability of the north?s boast that it has nuclear weapons does not translate to its possession of a genuine and certified weapons system, which requires tests, Baek said. ?It is questionable whether North Korea has the capability to mount a reliable nuclear warhead,? Baek said.

 Gary Samore, director of Studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the United Kingdom said those looking at the issue are pretty confident that North Korea has enough plutonium to build a small number of weapons. But he cautioned that nothing was confirmed regarding the north?s nuclear capabilities.

 ?Most people in the field assume that North Korea can deliver a simple, implosion weapon by missile with a range that could hit Tokyo,? Samore said, adding that no one was certain if North Korea had actually produced nuclear weapons.

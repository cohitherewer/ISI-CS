 Breakthrough on climate road map

 Montreal, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Environment ministers agreed today to a road map to extend the Kyoto Protocol climate pact beyond 2012, breaking two weeks of deadlock at UN talks aimed at curbing global warming.

 Minutes after passing the Kyoto resolution, ministers also agreed to launch new, open-ended world talks on ways to fight global warming, overcoming objections by the US which had resisted taking part in broader discussions.

 The Montreal meeting had dragged on till nearly dawn today, in part delayed by last-minute Russian objections.

 This has been one of the most productive UN climate change conferences ever. This plan sets the course for future action on climate change, said Richard Kinley, acting head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat.

 Environment activists cheered, hugged and some even cried after the delegates passed what they saw as historic decisions tackling climate change.

 There were many potential points at this meeting when the world could have given up due to the tactics of the Bush administration and others but it did not, said Jennifer Morgan, climate change expert at WWF.

 And we must count on this resolve moving forward to bring the much deeper cuts in emissions in order to avoid the very devastating impacts of climate change, she said.

 The Montreal talks followed a twin track, one pursuing negotiations to advance Kyoto and the other under the broader UN Framework Convention on Climate Convention, Kyotos parent treaty.

 The US, the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and Australia have refused to ratify Kyoto but are members of the parent treaty and Washington had initially refused to support a broader dialogue, fearing it might lead binding commitments for cutting emissions.

 The Kyoto decision urges rich nations to decide new commitments beyond 2012 as early as possible without setting a detailed timetable.

 Under Kyoto, about 40 industrialised nations have to cut their emissions by an average of 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2008-12.

 But developing countries, such as China and India, have no targets under Kyoto and say that rich industrial states have to take the lead in cutting emissions after fuelling their economies with coal, oil and gas since the Industrial Revolution.

 The agreement on a Kyoto renewal road map would give members seven years to negotiate and ratify accords by the time the first phase ends in 2012. Most countries agree that deeper cuts will be needed to avoid climate chaos in coming decades.

 Global warming is widely blamed on a build-up of gases from burning fossil fuels in power plants, autos and factories. With the talks over, a huge sigh of relief swept through the vast conference hall after a 20-hour session that left delegates exhausted.

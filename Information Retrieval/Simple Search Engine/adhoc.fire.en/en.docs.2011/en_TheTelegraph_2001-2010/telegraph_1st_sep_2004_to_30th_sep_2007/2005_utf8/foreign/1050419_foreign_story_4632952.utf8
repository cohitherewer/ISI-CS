 Ballot fraud fears in UK

 AMIT ROY

 London, April 18: Just as ?dimpled chads? raised doubts about the authenticity of the American presidential election in 2000 when George Bush allegedly beat Al Gore, so also postal votes may prove to be the bane of the British general election on May 5.

 The rules have been relaxed to allow many more people to use postal votes, raising fears there will be widespread fraud, especially in marginal constituencies or in seats with large Asian populations where ?community elders? often advise illiterate men and women on how to vote.

 Trouble is already brewing in Leicester, where the sitting Liberal Democratic MP, 38-year-old Parmjit Singh Gill, who got into the House of Commons in July last year by winning a by-election, is already crying foul.

 Gill?s apprehension is understandable. He got in with a narrow majority of 1,654 on a low turnout of 41.6 per cent. The seat is normally a safe Labour seat but the by-election was caused by the death of its previous MP, Jim Marshall, who had held Leicester South for many years.

 At a time when feeling was strong against Tony Blair, who had led Britain into an unpopular war against Iraq, Gill took Leicester South with a 21.46 per cent swing from Labour to the Lib Dems.

 Gill is obviously worried that a few dodgy postal votes, organised for Labour by the ?dadas? of the 28,000-strong Asian community in Leicester ? and the city is now a quarter Asian ? would see him being ousted after a brief taste of life in the Commons.

 Clearly, something odd is going on. In 2001, 3,136 voters sought to vote from home; this year the figure so far is 12,811, ?close to 13,000?.

 Gill told The Telegraph he had been contacted by constituents who said Asian community leaders were at work on behalf of the Labour Party. But his informants said they would not come forward, name the leaders in public and ?bring shame on Asians?.

 Last year, two weeks before the byelection, he had written to all postal voters ? in Urdu, Gujarati and Punjabi ? asking them not to give their postal votes to third parties.

 ?I am meeting the police,? he said. ?It?s very, very important that the democratic process in Britain is not interfered with.? With so many postal votes, the election can, in a sense, be won before polling day. A candidate may win on polling day but lose when postal votes are taken into account.?

 Leicester City Council has sent letters to postal voters, warning them that the ballot should be secret and they should not hand over their unsealed ballot papers to anyone. 

 Sir Peter Soulsby, the Labour candidate for Leicester South, said that Gill should go to the police.

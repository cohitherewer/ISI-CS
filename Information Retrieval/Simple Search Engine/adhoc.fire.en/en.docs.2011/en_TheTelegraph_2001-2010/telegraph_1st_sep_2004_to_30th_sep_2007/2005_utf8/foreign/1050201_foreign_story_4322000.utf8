 Santa Maria (California), Jan. 31 (Reuters): Michael Jackson arrived at a California courthouse today -- his freedom, career and reputation on the line -- as jury selection began in the pop star?s child molestation trial.

 Jackson, who said on Sunday that he would be ?acquitted and vindicated? at trial, walked briskly into the courthouse dressed all in white and accompanied by his lawyer and a phalanx of bodyguards, one of whom held an umbrella over the singer.

 The performer, smiling and appearing upbeat, waved to onlookers and flashed the V-for-victory symbol.

 Dozens of fans cheered as he entered, Many carried signs bearing words of encouragement including, ?France Supports MJ? and ?We Believe You Michael.?

 In the past, Jackson and members of his family have appeared in court dressed in white, which they said was a symbol of innocence. The 46-year-old entertainer is charged with molesting a teenage boy who once lived with him at his Neverland Valley Ranch in central California.

 Jackson sat with his lawyers at the defence table as the first of some 750 prospective jurors were summoned to the courtroom of Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Rodney Melville.

 The would-be jurors were to report to Melville?s courtroom, in the central California city of Santa Maria, in groups of 150 to determine if they can serve in a trial that could last six months. The judge will try to assemble a pool of possible jurors who will be given seven-page questionnaires about the case and told to return on February 7.

 The trial of Jackson, one of the world?s best-known entertainers, has drawn worldwide media attention. 

 Jackson yesterday released a videotaped statement saying that leaks to the media about grand jury testimony in the case contained information that was ?disgusting and false? and predicted victory at trial.

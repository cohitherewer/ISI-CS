 Kate Moss in cocaine apology

 RICHARD ALLEYNE

 Kate Moss: Regretful

 Moss, 31, was said to have put her career, worth up to ?4 million a year, in jeopardy after pictures showed her taking the drug with her boyfriend Pete Doherty, the musician and drug addict, at a studio in west London.

 The fashion and cosmetic houses Chanel, Christian Dior, Robert Cavalli, Burberry and Rimmel have all refused to comment about their contracts with the model.

 But the store H amp;M, which is using Moss for its autumn clothing collection, has decided to stay with the model after she and her agent apologised for the incident.

 A spokesman for the chain said: We met Kate and her agent and she has told us she regrets the incident and has apologised to us. We are going to give her a second chance.

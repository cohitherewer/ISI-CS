 Blair rejects quit call, shuffles cabinet

 London, May 9 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair today rejected calls to resign as he reshuffled the ministerial pack after last weeks election sharply weakened his Labour government.

 Blair won an unprecedented straight third term for the centre-left Labour party last week, but voters whose trust in him was damaged by Iraq more than halved his majority.

 Britains political debate today was dominated by one question: when will he quit?

 ?The whole story of the government is going to be when is he going, ? said Labour parliamentarian Clare Short, a frequent thorn in Blairs side who resigned from the Cabinet over Iraq.

 ?Theres a real danger the government looks divided, doesnt renew itself, we lose seats in local government elections and so on, and get weaker and weaker,? she told BBC radio.

 Blair announced last year he would serve a full third term of four to five years but then would not stand again ? a move that risks turning him into a lame duck, analysts say. His parliamentary majority fell at Thursdays vote to 67 from 161.

 Forecasts for his departure range from months to two years. Finance minister Gordon Brown is Labours heir apparent.

 As Blair prepared to announce appointments of junior ministers to complete a reshuffle of his government, newspapers were full of speculation. The Sun tabloid even published a cut-out ?fun resignation sweepstake?. A poll in the right-leaning Daily Telegraph indicated 46 per cent of voters wanted Blair out by this time next year.

 Some critics want Blair to go by September, when Labour holds its annual conference. Labour parliamentarian John Austin said he would stand for the leadership at the conference with the aim of paving the way for a more serious contender.

 Others say Blair should quit around the 2006 September conference, allowing him to bow out gracefully after Britain completes its presidency of the Group of Eight rich nations and the European Union this year.

 But Blair shows no sign of wanting to give up: ?I have not just gone through four weeks of Hell to bugger off in a few months time,? he was quoted by media as telling confidants.

 Many political pundits see Britains referendum on the EU constitution, planned for 2006, as the moment of truth.

 Presuming France approves the treaty on May 29 and Britains vote goes ahead, Blair will face a battle to convince sceptical Britons to back the project. Defeat could force him out. But Blair loyalists expressed dismay that a man who has seen off four leaders of the main opposition Conservative party since 1997 should be hounded out of office.

 Blair could face a rough ride when he addresses new and old Labour members of parliament on Wednesday before presenting his new legislative slate to parliament on May 17.

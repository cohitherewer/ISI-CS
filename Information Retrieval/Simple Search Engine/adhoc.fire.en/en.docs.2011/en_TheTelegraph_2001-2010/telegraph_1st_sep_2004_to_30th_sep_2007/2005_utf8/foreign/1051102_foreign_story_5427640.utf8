 Bush bid for flu war chest

 Washington, Nov. 1 (Reuters): President George W. Bush asked Congress on Tuesday for $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare the US for a possible pandemic of avian influenza.

 The total includes requests of $1.2 billion to make 20 million more doses of the current vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza, $2.8 billion to accelerate new flu-vaccine technology and $1 billion to stockpile more antiviral drugs.

 To respond to a pandemic we must have emergency plans in place in all 50 states, in every local community. We must ensure that all levels of government are ready to act to contain an outbreak, Bush said in a speech at the National Institutes of Health.

 Several groups said the requests were nowhere near enough, but praised Bush for making a start.

 The H5N1 avian influenza has so far only infected 122 people and killed 62, but it has spread to poultry flocks across many parts of Asia and into Europe.

 It is making steady mutations that scientists say could allow it to spread easily from person to person and cause a catastrophic pandemic.

 The worlds governments have collectively admitted that, despite years of warnings, they are unprepared for a pandemic that could sicken up to a third of the population within months.

 Delegates to an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Brisbane, Australia said on Tuesday they would begin to develop a regional cooperation mechanism, but had no details.

 Bush said he had submitted a $7.1 billion request for emergency avian flu funds to the House of Representatives.

 He repeated the advice of scientists who have said the most immediate need is for global surveillance to catch outbreaks immediately. He requested $251 million to help detect and contain outbreaks before they spread around the world.

 Stockpiles of drugs, lists of emergency responders and other efforts to build up emergency preparedness also figure in the plan, to be spelled out in detail by Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt.

 Bush said he was also asking Congress to reduce liability for companies that make influenza vaccine. 

 Drug companies have said fear of liability suits have helped keep them out of the vaccine market.

 The administration has said it will pursue ways to lure vaccine makers back to the US. 

 Currently, only five companies in the world make vaccine used for routine childhood jabs for the US market.

 Recent shortfalls in influenza-vaccine production -- last year Chiron Corp lost its licence and cost the US half its anticipated supply -- highlight the industrys tenuous state.

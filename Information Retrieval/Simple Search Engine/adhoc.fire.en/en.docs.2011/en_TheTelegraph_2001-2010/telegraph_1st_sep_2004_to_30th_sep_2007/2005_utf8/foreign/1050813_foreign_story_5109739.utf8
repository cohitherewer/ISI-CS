 Stone pleads guilty 

 Los Angeles, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Oscar winning-director Oliver Stone has pleaded no contest to a charge of marijuana possession and was fined $100, officials said yesterday.

 Stones lawyers entered the plea on his behalf at a Beverly Hills court hearing on July 29 ? two weeks ahead of the scheduled hearing date, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorneys office said.

 Stone, 58, was charged after being stopped at a routine traffic checkpoint in May.

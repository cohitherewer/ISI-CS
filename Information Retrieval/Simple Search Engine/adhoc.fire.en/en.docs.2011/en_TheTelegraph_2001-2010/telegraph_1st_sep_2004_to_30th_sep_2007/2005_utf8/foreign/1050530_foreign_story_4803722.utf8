 The key lies with sceptics

 Dijon (France), May 29 (Reuters): Jose Robalo was planning to reject the European Unions new constitution in a French referendum today, but changed his mind at the last minute.

 Until yesterday I said No but today I voted Yes, Robalo, 56, said as he worked the coffee machine behind the bar of his Moulin A Vent restaurant in the city of Dijon in Frances traditional Burgundy heartland. I have disagreed with Europe from the start but we are stuck with it and I am thinking of my children ? perhaps it will be better for them, he said.

 Voters like Robalo are vital for the constitutions supporters, who trailed in opinion polls before voting began.

 The Yes camps hopes of success could depend on the about one-in-five voters who were undecided at the end of campaigning and on sceptics changing their minds at the last minute. 

 His wife Louise, however, remained undecided: I couldnt decide what to think so I am not going to vote today.

 Baker Laurent Gerbert, 49, delivers a sack of croissants to the bar and lights up a cigarette. 

 People are against the current government and they are going to make them pay, he said. But I voted Yes for my kids and for Europe. We will be bigger, and perhaps that will give them more opportunities.

 In a region famed for its wine and mustard, people were voting early, if with tempered enthusiasm, in a referendum on adopting a treaty to make the European Union work more smoothly following its enlargement from 15 to 25 member states last year.

 A French rejection of the charter could provoke a crisis of confidence throughout the Union and delay integration. Opponents want the treaty to be renegotiated and improved.

 Yves Chailly, 36, station master with state-owned rail company SNCF, was adamant about voting No.

 I consider myself first Dijonnais, then Burgundian, then French, then European, and then from the planet Earth, he said, dragging a suitcase home after a holiday in Egypt. But this time I am stopping at French. 

 That is because he is worried about the future of public services in the European Union.

 I said Yes to Maastricht (the 1992 treaty on closer EU integration), Yes to a single currency, Yes to freedom of movement across borders, but in my view Brussels will destroy public services in the name of a notion of profitability that I dont accept, he said. 

 A constitution should not be an economic thing, it should discuss individual rights and leave economic matters out.

 Alain, 60, who runs a Dijon masonry business with eight employees, was sipping coffee with his son in the Place Francois Rude before heading off to vote.

 Im voting No ? I prefer to be a little guy on my own than big with a whole bunch of others, he said, declining to give his last name.I opened the constitution and it put me to sleep. I said Stop! Its too complicated and I didnt understand a thing.

 With 15 countries it was okay, but now Europe is too big. If the French want something they will have to get permission from everyone and it will take four years to get the answer back.

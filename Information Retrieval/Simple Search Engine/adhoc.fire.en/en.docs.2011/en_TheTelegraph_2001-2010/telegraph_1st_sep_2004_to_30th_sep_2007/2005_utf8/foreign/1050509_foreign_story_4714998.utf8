 Crash or not, party goes on

 Tokyo, May 8 (AFP): The railway firm involved in Japans worst train disaster in four decades came under fire today for failing to stop employees holding a banquet and karaoke competition on the night of the fatal accident.

 Nearly 40 employees and retirees of West Japan Railway Co. and a lawmaker were accused by media of insensitivity for not cancelling the annual fraternal banquet after the April 25 disaster, in which 107 people were killed.

 Some of those attending the celebration even held a karaoke singing contest for about two hours after the dinner, the Asahi newspaper, public broadcaster NHK and other media reported. 

 ?We did not make the event public as it was privately held by a group of individuals and it was not an activity organised by a work unit,? a JR West spokesperson said. 

 More than 450 people were injured in the accident.

 The company, serving in and around the Osaka-Kobe region, had already been criticised for failing to prevent 48 of its employees staging a bowling contest while rescue efforts went on, just hours after the crash.

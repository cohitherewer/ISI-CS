 Rolling riots of Paris enter Day 10

 Paris, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Urban violence scaled new heights in France as gangs of youths torched cars, shops and firms in the 10th straight night of violence in poor suburbs of Paris and provincial towns, despite heavy police reinforcements.

 Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was to meet police this afternoon and teachers from tough neighbourhoods to discuss how to respond to youths who have defied all appeals for calm from top officials and exasperated residents.

 Rioting started 10 days ago with the deaths of two youths apparently fleeing police. 

 The deaths ignited pent-up frustration among ethnic minorities over racism, unemployment, police treatment and their marginal place in French society.

 The Socialist Opposition chided the ruling conservatives over their law and order record and demanded President Jacques Chirac, who won re-election in 2002 on security issues but who has kept a low profile, speak out.

 Residents in affected zones wept and vented their dismay.

 This is too much, stop! Stop, do something else, but not this, not violence, sobbed a woman in Evreux, a normally quiet Normandy town where a shopping mall, 50 vehicles, a post office and two schools were destroyed.

 My wifes out of a job now, fumed another resident.Ive two kids, a house to pay for and a car loan. What do I do now?

 Evreux mayor Jean-Louis Debre, a Chirac confidant who is speaker of the lower House of Parliament, told reporters at the scene: A hundred people have smashed everything and strewn desolation. Well, they dont form part of our universe.

 Authorities say the rolling nightly riots are being organised via the Internet and mobile phones, and have pointed the finger at drug traffickers and Islamist militants.

 Across France, 1,300 vehicles went up in flames, with 32 cars destroyed in the city of Paris for the first time. 

 Why would people do such a thing? You should go and ask them. Of course its not normal ? its pure vandalism, said one pensioner in the 17th district of Paris where the wrecks of six burnt-out cars sat surrounded by shards of glass.

 Previously quiet towns like Dreux and the western city of Nantes, were also affected.

 Seven police helicopters buzzed over the Paris region through the night, filming disturbances and directing mobile squads to incidents. Police made 349 arrests and 2,300 officers have been drafted in.

 The violence has tarnished Frances image abroad, forcing Villepin to cancel a trip to Canada, while Russia and the US have warned their citizens to avoid troubled suburbs.

 Authorities have so far found no way beyond appeals and more police to address a problem with complex social, economic and racial causes.

 Many youths have never seen their parents work and couldnt hold down a job if they got one, said Claude Chevallier, manager of a burned-out carpet depot in the rundown Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois.

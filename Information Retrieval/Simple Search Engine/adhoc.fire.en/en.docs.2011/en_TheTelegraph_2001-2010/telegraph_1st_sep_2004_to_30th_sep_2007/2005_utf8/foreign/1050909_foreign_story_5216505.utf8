 Annan free, but not son

 Kojo Annan: Unlike father

 United Nations, Sept. 8 (Reuters): You can choose your friends but not your family.

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan escaped charges of corruption in a report on the Iraqi oil-for-food programme released yesterday, but evidence was presented that his son Kojo brandished his fathers name to avoid paying taxes on a luxury car and lied repeatedly while under investigation.

 Kofi Annan said the report was deeply embarrassing. One of the most embarrassing points for the soft-spoken Nobel Peace Prize winner from Ghana must be the role of his own son.

 Kojo Annan, now 31, was a consultant for the Swiss firm Cotecna SA that won a lucrative UN contract in Iraq and, contrary to his repeated denials, was closely involved in the 1998 bidding process. Around the same time, he lied in order to use his fathers diplomatic privileges to avoid over $20,000 in taxes and duty on a Mercedes-Benz car, the report said.

 I think the report speaks for itself and he will have to speak for himself, Kofi Annan said of his son after he was presented with the results of a year-long probe into the Iraqi oil-for-food programme which revealed inefficiency and mismanagement compounded by political tensions and corruption.

 While the report from the committee headed by former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker did not find reasonably sufficient evidence to conclude the secretary-general knew about Cotecnas bid or his sons involvement, it did fault him for failing to conduct a proper investigation.

 Moreover Volcker noted that he had not said there was no evidence, merely that there was not conclusive evidence.

 Phone records and documents that Cotecna had previously withheld showed Kojo made a string of phone calls to UN officials at key moments in the bidding process, including several to a family friend of the Annans, Diana Mills-Aryee, whom Kojo called Aunty and who worked in the UN procurement department.

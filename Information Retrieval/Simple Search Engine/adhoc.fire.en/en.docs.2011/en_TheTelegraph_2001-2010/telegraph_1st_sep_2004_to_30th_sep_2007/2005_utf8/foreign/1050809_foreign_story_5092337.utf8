 Britain, Pak sign deal to halt illegal immigration

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Aug. 8: The Pakistan and British governments have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to stop illegal immigration from the South Asian nation to the British isles.

 The MoU on managed migration signed between the two countries on July 25 will help regulate visas for Pakistanis wishing to travel to the UK and substantially reduce deportation of our nationals, foreign ministry spokesman Naeem Khan said in Islamabad. The British government had recently decided to appoint liaison officers at its high commission in Islamabad to put a check on illegal immigration to their country from Pakistan.

 The liaison officers will interact with their counterparts in Pakistans interior ministry to deal with the issue, a move senior ministry officials initially opposed saying it will encourage other embassies in the capital to appoint their own officers.

 The British government had also reportedly accused Federal Investigation Agency officials and the immigration department for their involvement in the trafficking of humans.

 Britain is not the only country facing growing number of illegal immigrants from Pakistan. Hundreds have recently been deported from Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.

 Part of the countrys Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the ATU was established with cooperation from the U.S. Bureau for International Narcotics and Law

 Enforcement.

 The latest British governments decision comes to the backdrop of a controversy erupted over involvement of three Britons of Pakistan-origin in recent

 multiple bomb attacks in London.

 Though senior Pakistani officials often said they had no evidence or information about a recent visit to Pakistan by any of the three Britons of

 Pakistan-origin, the British authorities say two of three suspects, visited Lahore last year and one of them stayed at a religious seminary there studying

 Islam.

 Spokesman Khan said that Pakistan and Britain will soon sign an extradition treaty providing for the exchange of criminals wanted to the two governments.

 He said Islamabad and London are presently finalizing procedural formalities and the treaty would be singed once the process is completed.

 The two countries began to work out the treaty at an initiative taken by Islamabad a few years ago, Khan said.

 Pakistan had initiated discussions to sign extradition treaties with several countries including the United States and the United Kingdom a few years ago to

 seek return of a number of what the then military-led government called corrupt Pakistani politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats, who allegedly fled the

 country after plundering national

 wealth before October 1999.

 President General Pervez Musharraf had ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs government in a bloodless military coup in October 1999.

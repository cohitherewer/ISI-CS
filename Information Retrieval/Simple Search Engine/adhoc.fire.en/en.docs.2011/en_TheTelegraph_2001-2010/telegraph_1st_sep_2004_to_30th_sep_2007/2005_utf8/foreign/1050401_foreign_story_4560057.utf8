 Drug hope for arthritis patients 

 Sydney, March 31 (Reuters): Australian scientists have identified an enzyme that destroys cartilage in mice and believe the find may lead to new drugs which stop cartilage joint deterioration and painful arthritis in humans.

 ?We consider this to be a significant advance because until now we did not know what enzyme was doing the damage,? researcher Amanda Fosang from the University of Melbourne said today.

 Fosang was confident that the same enzyme, ADAMTS5, would be involved with breaking down cartilage in humans. 

 ?This could lead to the development of inhibitors which can be prescribed to patients with arthritis,? Fosang said.

 ?For elderly people with rheumatoid and osteoarthritis you can hope that they will never have to have a joint replacement because their cartilage will survive,? Fosang said.

 Aspirin prevention

 Four tablets of regular strength aspirin each day do a better job at safely preventing small strokes caused by narrowed arteries in the brain than the potent blood thinner warfarin, researchers said yesterday.

 Liberal Clooney stands apart

 George Clooney

 Los Angeles, July 2 (Reuters): Wouldnt it be great if more movie stars were like George Clooney?

 Hes the modern model: Hes too cool to demand a $20 million salary to prove his self-worth; he writes, directs and produces; and he expends his movie star capital to push for the things he believes in. Im a hybrid, Clooney said last week after he accepted the Los Angeles Independent Film Festivals first Spirit of Independence Award. 

 I succeed in both worlds. I hope that selling out on Oceans Eleven is not such a bad deal. The trade-off is, I get to go make something uncommercial that will probably lose money.

 Clooney is confident enough to go toe to toe with Fox News Bill Reilly or to protect a movie extra from an abusive director or to coax not only fellow flaming liberals to join his campaign against hunger in Africa but also Pat Robertson as well. And when a completion bond company backed out of Clooneys second directing effort, the $8 million black-and-white drama Goodnight, and Good Luck, starring David Strathairn as newsman Edward R. Murrow, Clooney offered to put up his house to insure the movie himself.

 This is not your average star. So though Clooney boasts a production deal on the Warner Bros. lot, he has more than earned the label independent. Along with his Section Eight producing partner Steven Soderbergh, Clooney balances such big-budget studio pictures as Oceans Eleven and Oceans Twelve that rake in cash with riskier fare that he sometimes stars in and produces ? such as Solaris, Insomnia, Far From Heaven, Welcome to Collinwood, Criminal and his directing debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.

 Section Eights next three movies also push the edge of the studio envelope: Besides Goodnight, and Good Luck, Clooney will star in the provocative West Asia terrorist thriller Syriana. Were going to get in a lot of trouble for putting a face on the evildoers, Clooney says.

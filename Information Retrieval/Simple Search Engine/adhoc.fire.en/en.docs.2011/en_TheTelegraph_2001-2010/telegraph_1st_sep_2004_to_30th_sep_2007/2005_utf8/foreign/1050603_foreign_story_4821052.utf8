 Schumacher guru has had enough

 Balbir Singh

 London, June 2 (Reuters): 

 Even if Michael Schumacher is not thinking of retiring, 

 the world champions wonder guru has had 

 enough.

 Balbir Singh, the Indian-born physiotherapist who has been at the Germans side for the past 10 years and throughout his Ferrari career, wants to spend more time with his family and will step down at the end of the season.

 Balbir is one of the few men that I could and can trust 150 per cent, the seven times Formula 1 world champion told Germanys Bild newspaper today.

 The split will hurt me. I will miss him. I must simply accept that he wants to build a new future, added Schumacher, 36, who insisted earlier this week that he was not thinking of quitting despite his poor start to the season.

 The Ferrari drivers spokeswoman said the two would remain close friends. He is one of the closest people to Michael, she said. Its been 10 years now and at one point he just said I have to care about my family more.

 Dubbed Schumachers wonder-guru by Bild, Singhs behind-the-scenes role has been far more than massaging away the aches and pains of racing. He also keeps an eye on what the driver eats, calms him down and acts as a confidant. He has something in his hands that no-one else has, said Schumacher.

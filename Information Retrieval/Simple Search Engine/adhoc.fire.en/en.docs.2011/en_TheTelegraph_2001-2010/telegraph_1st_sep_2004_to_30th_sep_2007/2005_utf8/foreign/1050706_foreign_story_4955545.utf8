 Pak diplomat unhurt in third raid on envoys

 Mohammad Younis Khan

 Baghdad, July 5 (Reuters): Gunmen opened fire on a convoy carrying Pakistans ambassador to Iraq, Mohammad Younis Khan, today in the third attack on a senior diplomat in three days, police sources said.

 The sources said two cars of gunmen fired at the convoy in the wealthy Mansour district of Baghdad but sped off after guards returned fire. Nobody was reported hurt.

 There were exchanges of fire and one of the three cars in the Pakistani convoy was hit, but the ambassador was unharmed, a police source said. 

 Following the attack, Pakistan decided to relocate Younis Khan from Baghdad to Amman, Jordan. We have decided to relocate him to Amman, Naeem Khan, a ministry spokesman, said in Islamabad.

 Earlier today, gunmen wounded the top envoy from Bahrain. Egypts envoy was kidnapped over the weekend.

 Iraqs government spokesman said the attacks on the Egyptian and Bahraini diplomats were part of an effort to intimidate countries considering upgrading their ties to Iraq.

 Baghdad had indicated last week that the Egyptian diplomat, Ihab el-Sherif, would soon become the first Arab envoy in Baghdad with the full rank of ambassador since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. There has been no word since Saturday on his fate.

 A bomb that targeted private security guards near the Iranian embassy today and reports of a recent attack on Russian diplomats ? unconfirmed by Moscows embassy ? added to a picture of insurgents launching a campaign against diplomatic staff.

 It is not strange, the kidnapping of the Egyptian diplomat in a bid to frighten embassies and missions. This is the goal of terrorism, government spokesman Laith Kubba told a briefing. This is also the case in the shooting of the Bahraini diplomat.

 Iraqi spokesman Kubba said there was some mystery about the disappearance of Egyptian envoy Ihab el-Sherif, just days after Iraq said it expected him to become the first Arab diplomat with full ambassadorial rank in Baghdad since the US invasion ? a promotion which officials in Cairo have not confirmed.

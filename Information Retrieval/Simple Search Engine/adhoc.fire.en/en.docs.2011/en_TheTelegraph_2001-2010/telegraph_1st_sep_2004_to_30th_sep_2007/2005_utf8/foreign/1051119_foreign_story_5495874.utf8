 Cruz in the bullring

 Penelope Cruz: Ole!

 London, Nov. 18: Adrien Brody and Penelope Cruz will star in the long-gestating matador drama Manolete, the films producers said yesterday.

 Set around the passion and the fury of the bullring in 1940s Spain, the film centres on the true story of Spains legendary bullfighter, Manolete, and his obsessive love affair with actor Lupe Sino.

 Writer/director Menno Meyjes (The Color Purple) is scheduled to travel to Madrid next month to start preparation, and Brody is expected to join him in January to train with a bullfighter. Shooting is expected to begin in March.

 The project is a collaboration between UK based Sequence Films, Spains Lola Film and Tunisian producer Tarak Ben Ammars Quinta Communications.

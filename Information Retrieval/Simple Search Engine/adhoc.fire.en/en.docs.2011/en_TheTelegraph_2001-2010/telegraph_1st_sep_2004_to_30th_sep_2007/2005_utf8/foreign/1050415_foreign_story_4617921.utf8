 US tycoon in UN oil scandal

 New York, April 14 (Reuters): South Korean Tongsun Park and a Texas oil businessman have been charged in two separate federal cases involving bribes and kickbacks in the scandal-plagued UN oil-for-food programme, federal authorities said today.

 Park, who was at the centre of the Koreagate influence-peddling scandal in Washington in the 1970s, was charged by the US attorney in New York with being an unregistered agent for Iraq.

 The criminal complaint said he received at least $2 million from Iraq for lobbying UN officials to set up the oil-for-food programme, with an understanding that some of the money would be used to ?take care? of a UN official.

 In a second case, Texan David Chalmers and his two oil companies, Bayoil Inc. and Bayoil Supply and Trading Co., were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan.

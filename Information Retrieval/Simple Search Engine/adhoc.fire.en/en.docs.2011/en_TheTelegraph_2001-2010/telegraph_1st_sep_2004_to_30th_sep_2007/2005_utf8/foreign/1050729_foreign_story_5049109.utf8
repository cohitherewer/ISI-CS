 Fine Print

 Peak palace

 Berlin, July 28 (Reuters): A team of artists will convert the dilapidated former parliament building of East Germany into a large white mountain next week in a public installation that could be the buildings swansong.

 Thousands of metres of white cloth will be draped over a network of scaffolding, covering the buildings dark interior of rusting steel beams, leaky ceilings, tinted glass and crumbling concrete walls.

 A mountain peak will be added to the outside of the Palast der Republik to complete the wintry effect. The installation will give the public perhaps one of its last glimpses inside the long-vacant building. 

 Toy trick

 Ottawa (Reuters): Exasperated Canadian 

 air safety officials on Thursday told passengers to 

 leave their water pistols and toy guns at home because 

 they were triggering big delays at airport security. Screening 

 staff found nearly 3,000 toy guns, water pistols, toy grenades 

 and other items resembling real weapons between January 

 and June of this year.

 Suspense for birthday Blair

 Sedgefield (England), May 5 

 (Reuters): Britons voted today in an election likely to 

 hand Prime Minister Tony Blair a third term despite anger 

 over Iraq, with blasts at the British consulate in New York 

 jangling nerves.

 Blair, far less popular than when he won landslide victories in 1997 and 2001, cast his ballot in the northern English constituency of Sedgefield just before news of the blast broke. 

 A prodigiously charismatic leader who brought his party to power after 18 years in the wilderness, Blair saw his trust ratings plummet after deciding to invade Iraq in 2003. His alliance with President George W. Bush infuriated many traditional supporters of his centre-left Labour party. But he has campaigned on the strength of the economy, which has blossomed throughout his eight years in office.

 Blair walked across a football field to vote in a picturesque mining village near Sedgefield with wife Cherie and sons Euan and Nicky, both old enough to vote for the first time.

 Blair, who will turn 52 tomorrow, says a third term would be his last. 

 Winning a third straight poll would be a first for a Labour leader ? only Conservative Margaret Thatcher has done it. But if Blairs parliamentary majority is much reduced, he could have difficulty pushing through his plans, especially health and education reforms opposed by some in his own party. 

 Blair had a 161-seat majority of 659 members in the outgoing house. There will be 15 fewer seats in parliament after this election, following a redrawing of the electoral map.

 Labour gains from surprise Muslim vote

 AMIT ROY

 London, May 7: The surprise 

 from Tony Blairs point of view is not the number of 

 Muslim voters who wanted to punish him over the Iraq war 

 but the number who, despite all their reservations, decided 

 in the final analysis to back Labour. 

 ?I think thats broadly true,? said the Muslim Council of Britains official spokesman, Inayat Bunglawala, who pointed out that the Labour party had deep links with British Muslims. How Muslims voted was one of the big issues of the general election, which gave Blair a third term in office. Hindus feel left out because no one bothers to discuss them, but that is because they are not seen as troublemakers. 

 Britains Muslim population is most authoritatively put at 1.6 million, and since it is relatively young, the number of voters, spread across constituencies in London, Luton, Bradford, Manchester and Birmingham, is probably in the 700,000-800,000 range. 

 The Muslim Council could have issued a virtual fatwa urging its members of the Islamic faith not to vote for Blair. It didnt. 

 Instead, it issued a 10-point plan, advising Muslims to quiz candidates before making up their minds. Many did just that ? and adopted the ?better the devil you know? approach. 

 An organisation called Muslim Vote UK, run from Birmingham by Shaista Gohir, a woman academic, concluded yesterday: ?The Muslim vote was split in 43 constituencies where it was important. The older generation are traditional Labour supporters. They had nowhere else to go. Its the younger ones who have become politicised.? 

 The Muslim Council seemed pretty pleased today with the result. It is happy that the suggestion of some extremists that it is somehow un-Islamic to vote was rejected. 

 ?The Muslim Council of Britain particularly welcomes the election of two Muslim candidates, Sadiq Khan and Shahid Malik, to the House of Commons, in addition to the existing two, Muhammad Sarwar and Khalid Mahmood, who were re-elected, bringing the total number of Muslim MPs now to four,? it said in a statement. 

 Bunglawala expressed regret that the one Muslim who had an excellent chance of getting in as a Tory MP ? Ali Miraj in Watford ? polled 14,634, only slightly behind Labours 16,578 and the Lib Demss 15,427. ?We hope he gets in next time,? Bunglawala. 

 It will take months to work out how Muslims voted in different constituencies but there is plenty of evidence to show that the Lib Dems and Respect benefited from Muslim anger. 

 In West Ham in London, for example, Respect came from nowhere to pick up 6,039 votes, which probably came from Muslims. In Birmingham, against Roger Godsiffs winning 13,787 for Labour, Salma Yaqoob got close for Respect with 10,498, which again must have come from disaffected Muslims. 

 Labour had one big advantage. It could mobilise Muslim local government councillors, of whom there are a great many, plus assorted activists, to neutralise the Islamic lobby which was out to ?get Blair?. In this inter-Muslim fight, battle honours were even. 

 This explains why Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, did not lose his Blackburn seat ? a quarter of its electorate is Muslim ? as some had predicted. 

 There was another factor. Asians like to be on the winning side and they sensed that Blair would be back, wounded but victorious. 

 ?Muslims are becoming discriminating,? acknowledged Bunglawala. ?This is why we in the council did not go for the anti-Blair line. 

 ?There is no uniform Muslim voting pattern across the country. Its a mixed picture. But Muslims did want to participate and be part of the political mainstream. The Labour partys links with Muslims did not entirely break down because of the war.? 

 In Tooting, south London, where there is a Muslim presence, newcomer Sadiq Khan got in for Labour with 17,914 votes. Even Khalid Mahmood, the sitting Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, who abstained over the war, was forgiven, polled 18,269 votes and retained his seat ? even though two Muslim challengers got 6513 and 2173 votes respectively for the Tories and Respect. 

 In Bethnal Green and Bow, George Galloway, the founder of Respect, was able to unleash Muslim anger over Iraq but this was not repeated elsewhere. 

 ?The candidates records on a whole range of issues was taken into account,? said Bunglawala. 

 This was certainly the case in Leicester East, where Keith Vaz (a Catholic) feared he would lose one in three of his 6,000 Muslim voters because of his backing for the Iraq war. However, because he is considered a good constituency MP, Vaz increased his majority from 13,442 to 15,876. 

 ?The Muslims must have voted for me,? noted Vaz. 

 Perhaps the luckiest ethnic candidate, who wont have the huge immigration case load that MPs like Vaz have to deal with, is Shailesh Vara, an Indian originally from Uganda who stood in North-West Cambridgeshire, a virtually Muslim free zone. He polled 22,504 votes and got in with a majority of 9,833 and is now the new Asian face of the Tory party. 

 The war was an issue but not as an electoral weapon to deploy against the Prime Minister, as happened in Muslim areas. 

 ?People here want an exit strategy for British troops,? Vara said.

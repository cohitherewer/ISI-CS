 Leg lost, Samir goes extra mile

 Baghdad, Jan. 30 (Reuters): Samir Hassan lost his leg in a Baghdad bombing but that did not stop him voting in Iraq?s election today, determined to defy the men who maimed him.

 ?I would have crawled here if I had to. I don?t want terrorists to kill other Iraqis like they tried to kill me,? said Hassan, 32, at a polling station in western Baghdad. 

 ?Today I am voting for peace,? he said propping himself up on crutches as he stood in line to vote in Iraq?s first election since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. 

 In October last year, Hassan was in the wrong place at the wrong time when a suicide bomber struck in Baghdad.

 He thinks the target was probably a police station or a group of men lining up to be recruited. Either way, a piece of burning shrapnel flew from the bomb and lodged in Hassan?s leg just below the knee, shattering the bones.

 ?Everything just blacked out. All I know is that people were running above me and then I was in the hospital,? he said. Doctors were unable to remove the metal and decided to amputate his leg, barely managing to save the knee.

 Hassan became one of the thousands of Iraqis who have been maimed in the several hundred car bomb blasts that have devastated the country over the past two years.

 But Hassan, who hails from the poor, working class district of Hurriya, a mixed Sunni and Shia neighbourhood near Baghdad?s old city, bears no bitterness. If anything, he says his misfortune makes him more determined to battle on ? via the ballot box ? for change in Iraq. 

 Standing in line alone, his shoddy clothes hanging off him, his trouser leg folded up beneath his amputated leg, Hassan hardly looks like a campaigner as he slumps on his worn metal crutches.

 But in his eyes, resolute and reddened at the edges, and in his face, scarred by the October blast, there was absolute determination and not a little defiance today.

 Rubbing the grey stubble on his chin, he was adamant that the only way forward for Iraqis was to vote and show they stand united against the insurgents determined to wreck the polls. ?It is the only way, we must vote against them,? he said.

 As he moved foward in line in Hurriya, others around him seemed to have a similar resolve. With little emotion, hundreds moved through the polling centre today, casting their ballots and quickly moving on.

 Later, several Shias from the neighbourhood arrived at the voting centre, and after casting their ballots, distributed sweets and chocolates, giving what in many parts of Baghdad was a bloody day, a small sense of revelry.

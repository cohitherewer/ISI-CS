 Egyptians ask why

 Sharm el-Sheikh, July 24 (Reuters): People searching for the bodies of relatives killed by bombs at an Egyptian resort said today they could not believe fellow Egyptians had carried out the attacks.

 The friends and family of taxi driver Ayman Mohamed Hassan, one of the 88 people killed, were awaiting his corpse outside a hospital in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea beach and diving resort hit by three bombs yesterday.

 We are going to take him to Ismailia for burial, said Salem Nasar, who with a dozen other taxi drivers from the Suez Canal town will escort an ambulance carrying Aymans body home.

 Two of the bombs exploded at gathering points for taxi drivers, who like many other Egyptians working at the resort leave their families for weeks on end to earn better wages than they can at home.

 Our cars were destroyed, our friends killed and wounded, Nasar said. How has this benefited anyone?

 Nasar and Aymans other friends say Egyptians could not have been responsible. Why would Egyptians do this to their own people? asked Mohamed Salem.

 Inside the hospital Aymans brother Hassan, a taxi driver wounded in the same blast, lies on blood-stained sheets and struggles to swallow the food his uncle feeds him. He does not know Ayman is dead. We dont know yet whether he will be able to see again, his friend Yasser Ibrahim said.

 Some Egyptians are still searching for the bodies of relatives they fear were killed in the attacks, for which a group called the Abdullah al-Azzam Brigades posted a claim of responsibility on the Internet. Analysts doubt the claim is credible.

 Tourists were targeted by militant Egyptian Islamists during a campaign for a strict Islamic state in the 1990s. A small group of Egyptian militants attacked tourists three times in Cairo in April, killing three foreigners.

 The Sharm el-Sheikh bombs killed seven non-Egyptians, including a Czech and an Italian. But most of the dead were Egyptians.

 About 20 Egyptian families looking for the bodies of relatives have visited the morgue of a local hospital where four corpses are yet to be identified, hospital doctor Saeed Eissa said.

 The hospital has delivered by ambulance the bodies of 11 Egyptians to families in towns north of Cairo and in southern Egypt. People are coming to identify the four but they cannot, Eissa said.

 Mohamed Abdou could not tell whether any of the four was the corpse of his cousin, Shaaban, who was on night shift at a hotel partially destroyed by the third bomb. We are searching in all the hospitals, he said.

 If he finds the body, he will escort it for burial to their hometown of Manoufia, north of Cairo. Nobody can say who did this yet, but they were not Egyptians, he said.

 Saleh Saeed, a father of four who was blinded and badly burnt by one of the explosions, said it was impossible that Egyptians carried out the attacks.

 Saeed, who had also worked as a taxi driver, groans in agony as he sits upright. Ive lost my eyesight. What am I going to do now?

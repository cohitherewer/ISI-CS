 Fergie: Harry a good man

 London, Jan. 14 (Reuters): The Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson has defended her nephew Prince Harry for wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party, calling him ?a very good man?.

 Fergie, former wife of Prince Andrew who herself has been the target of media criticism in the past, said Harry made a mistake but should not be pilloried for it in the press.

 ?I want someone to stand up for him and say he?s a very good man, and I?m that person because I know what it?s like to have very bad press,? the Duchess told BBC radio.

 ?I know what it?s like to be continually criticised. It?s very tiring and it?s very unpleasant.?

 Fergie, who made headlines during and after her marriage to Andrew, said she felt ?very strongly? about the treatment meted out to Harry.

 Drink dames

 Sydney, March 15 (AFP): Women who have one or two alcoholic drinks per day are healthier than teetotallers, according to Australian research released today.

 A study on the health of 40,000 women from three generations and across Australia showed that those who consumed up to two drinks a day were better educated, exercised more often and had fewer weight problems than women who never drink alcohol. But women who have more than three drinks a day were also more likely to smoke, to suffer mental illness and use illegal drugs, according to researcher Anne Young.

 Ghost run

 Blantyre, Malawi (Reuters): Malawians 

 prayed for their President on Monday after officials said 

 he had left his 300-room mansion in the capital because 

 of fears it was haunted. Newspapers, however, slammed the 

 spooky talk from the presidency and asked President Bingu 

 wa Mutharika to get on with fighting poverty in the southern 

 African state. Officials said on Sunday the 73-year-old 

 President, a former economist with the World Bank, had decamped 

 from the state house in central Lilongwe because he feared 

 it was haunted.

 Stirrings of peace emerge in West Asia

Talking truce? Mahmoud Abbas (top) and Ariel 

Sharon

 Gaza, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Palestinian militants today signalled they would help maintain calm in Gaza for at least a month but denied Israeli reports they had agreed to a ceasefire at the behest of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

 Abbas, whose election this month as Yasser Arafat?s successor revived hopes for West Asian peace, has been trying to get militants to call off a four-year-old armed revolt so he can start negotiating for a state in Israeli-occupied territories.

 Militants indicated they would carry out no further attacks on Israelis unless provoked while they were conducting ?national unity? dialogue with Abbas expected to go on for about a month, when a firm decision about a ceasefire could be reached.

 Both Israel and the militants have avoided going first in declaring a truce. But relative quiet has taken hold in Gaza since Abbas began trying to swing Palestinian gunmen behind his agenda of non-violence.

 In a further sign of the transformed atmosphere, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon held a cabinet meeting today in Sderot, a southern Israeli town often hit by rocket fire from nearby Gaza until a few days ago.

 ?There is now calm. We don?t know if this is a genuine change yet. We hope so. But one thing is clear ? if terrorism resumes, we will act (militarily),? said Sharon.

 Militants linked the lull to ongoing dialogue with Abbas.

 ?We are still studying the issue of a ceasefire and there has been no decision in this regard,? said Palestinian Abu Qusai, spokesperson for the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an autonomous armed faction within Abbas? Fatah movement.

 Muslim militant factions Hamas and Islamic Jihad also denied having pledged a truce but said they were prepared for one if there were a prior halt to Israeli actions such as airstrikes and incursions to kill or capture militants.

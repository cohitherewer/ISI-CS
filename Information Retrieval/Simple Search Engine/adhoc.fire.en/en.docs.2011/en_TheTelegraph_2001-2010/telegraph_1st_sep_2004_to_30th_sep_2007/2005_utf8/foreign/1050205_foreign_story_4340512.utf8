 Rebuke for fun-to-shoot general

 General James Mattis

 Washington, Feb. 4 (Reuters): A senior US Marine Corps general who said it was ?fun to shoot some people? should have chosen his words more carefully but will not be disciplined, military officials said yesterday.

 Lieutenant General James Mattis, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and is slated to be portrayed by star actor Harrison Ford in an upcoming Hollywood movie, made the comments at a conference on Tuesday in San Diego, California.

 ?Actually it?s quite fun to fight ?em, you know. It?s a hell of a hoot. It?s fun to shoot some people. I?ll be right up front with you, I like brawling,? Mattis said.

 ?You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn?t wear a veil,? Mattis said during a panel discussion. ?You know, guys like that ain?t got no manhood left anyway. So it?s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.?

 In a statement, Marine Corps Commandant General Michael Hagee praised Mattis as ?one of this country?s bravest and most experienced military leaders.?

 ?While I understand that some people may take issue with the comments made by him, I also know he intended to reflect the unfortunate and harsh realities of war,? Hagee said.

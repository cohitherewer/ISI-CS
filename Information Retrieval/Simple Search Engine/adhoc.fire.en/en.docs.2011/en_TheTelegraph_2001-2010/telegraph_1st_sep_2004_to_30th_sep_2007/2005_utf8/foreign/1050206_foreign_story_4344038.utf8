 $5m sweetener helps Brad appear in beer ad

 HUGH DAVIES

 Brad Pitt: Tall drink

London, Feb. 5: He once worried about sullying 

his image by appearing in television advertisements but Brad Pitt appears to have 

swallowed his reservations with the help of a reputed $5 million sweetener.

 The 41-year-old, who might be needing a drink following his marital split with Jennifer Aniston, will be seen promoting beer by more than 90 million American viewers tomorrow night.

 In a 60-second slot during the Superbowl, the televisual highlight of the US year, Pitt will be seen dodging paparazzi on his way to pick up a six-pack of Heineken. The twist is that the photographers are not out to snap the star, but drink his beer.

 Fox Television is charging Heineken at least ?2 million to run the advert from the game in Jacksonville, Florida. Just how much the Dutch brewer has paid out altogether is uncertain. But Pitt is thought to have insisted that his fee be higher than the $3 million paid to Nicole Kidman for a Chanel No 5 advert created by her chosen director, Baz Luhrmann. 

 Pitt also had one his favourite directors, David Fincher, who made Fight Club and Se7en with him, to shoot the commercial.

 Until recently, such blatant money-making was Hollywood?s little secret as actors were unwilling to risk the scorn of their admirers by being seen to sell their supposedly artistic souls. Nevertheless, almost everybody did it ? with the exception of Scientologist Tom Cruise ? but went to exceptional lengths to keep US fans from finding out.

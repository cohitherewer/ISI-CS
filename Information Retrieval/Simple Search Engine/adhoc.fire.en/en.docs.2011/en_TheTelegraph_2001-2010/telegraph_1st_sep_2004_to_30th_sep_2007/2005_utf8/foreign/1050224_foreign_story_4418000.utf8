 Wonder paste 

 London, Feb. 23 (Reuters): Treating early tooth decay could become easier and less painful thanks to a new discovery by Japanese scientists.

 Researchers in Japan have developed a new synthetic tooth enamel that can repair early tooth decay.

 The crystalline white paste can reconstruct enamel without removing the decayed area. It repairs small cavities and helps prevent new ones. ?We have shown that our synthetic material can reconstruct enamel without prior excavation,? a researcher said.

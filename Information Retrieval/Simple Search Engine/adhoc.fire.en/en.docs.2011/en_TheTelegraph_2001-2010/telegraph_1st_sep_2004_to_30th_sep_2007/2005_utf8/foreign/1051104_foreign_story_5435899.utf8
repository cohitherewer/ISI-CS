 Blair admits times are tough

 London, Nov. 3 (Reuters): Tony Blair admitted today he was going through a tough period as his supporters urged him to re-assert his control of government.

 Blair suffered the resignation of close government ally David Blunkett yesterday and was then forced to shelve counter-terrorism plans to avoid losing his first major vote in parliament.

 The Prime Minister told a cabinet meeting today that times are tough, but they are tough because we are trying to do tough things, his spokesman said.

 Blunketts resignation from government, for the second time in the space of just 10 months, captured all the headlines.

 But more worrying for Blair was the way rebels in his Labour party cut his parliamentary majority to just one ? its lowest ever ? over counter-terrorism measures, forcing his ministers to shelve major parts of the legislation.

 Blair had personally insisted yesterday that police needed powers to hold terrorism suspects for up to 90 days. 

 Now the government will consult again in search of consensus. He needs to get back on the front foot and fast, said one Labour parliamentarian loyal to Blair.

 Blair has declared he will not fight another election but insists he will serve a full third term in power and force through radical reforms.

 Many of those ? overhauling schools and hospitals, the terrorism law and plans to get people off welfare and back into work ? are unpopular with a number of Labour MPs who have developed a taste for rebellion.

 What we saw yesterday was the authority of the Prime Minister diminishing to vanishing point, Conservative leader Michael Howard said.

 An election in May cut Blairs parliamentary majority to 66, about 100 less than before, meaning a rump of disaffected Labour members can cause havoc by voting with Opposition parties.

 Blair faces a critical few months, at home and abroad, running up to local government elections next May.

 He might not be seeking re-election but most of his followers are. A meltdown at local level would focus minds. I am looking to next May as a crunch point, said John Curtice, politics professor at Strathclyde University.

 On the foreign front, things look equally difficult. 

 The success or failure of Iraqi elections at the year-end will go a long way to define Blairs remaining time in power.

 He must also try to reach agreement on the EUs budget after talks acrimoniously fell apart in June. 

 Diplomats say if he fails, his EU presidency will be considered a failure.

 And if world trade talks in December falter, experts say Blairs key plan for 2005 ? to secure global deals to lift Africa out of poverty ? will fall short.

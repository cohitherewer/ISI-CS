 Fine Print

 Greek twister

 Strasbourg (France), July 6 (Reuters): After twice mangling the multisyllabic name of a Greek European Parliament member who authored a report on Iraq, British foreign minister Jack Straw gave up and apologised to the speaker.

 I did ancient Greek at school, but it was written rather than oral, Straw quipped.

 European external relations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, whose own double-barrelled surname is a bit of a tongue-twister, also stumbled when trying to pronounce the name of Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, who grinned and applauded at each fumbling attempt.

 Parliament President Josep Borrell rode to the rescue, offering the speakers Greek lessons at parliaments expense if it would be helpful.

 But the most practical suggestion came from German lawmaker Elmar Brok, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of which Dimitrakopoulos is a member.

 We tend to call the rapporteur George. Its much easier, Brok told Straw. The chief British diplomat accepted the advice gratefully and referred repeatedly to George in replying to the debate.

 Doze dare

 London (Reuters): A teenage sleepwalker 

 was rescued after being found fast asleep 40 metres up on 

 the arm of a crane, police said on Wednesday. Emergency 

 services were called to a building site in London after 

 a passerby spotted the 15-year-old girl curled up on top 

 of a concrete counterweight high above the ground. The teenager, 

 who has not been named, had climbed up the crane and walked 

 across a narrow metal beam while fast asleep during the 

 incident, which happened on June 25. It is believed the 

 teenager had walked out unnoticed from her home near the 

 site in Dulwich, southeast London. She was brought down 

 in a hydraulic lift after a two-hour rescue operation. Police 

 and London fire brigade attended and the woman was brought 

 down from the crane at around 4 am and taken to hospital 

 for precautionary checks, police said. The girl was 

 unharmed and later went home.

 Long locks

 Seoul (Reuters): South Korean high school students may be allowed to let their hair down after a government body said regulations which led some teachers to forcibly cut their hair were an infringement. In May, school students held rallies in a number of South Korean cities to protest against the tough rules ? including cases of teachers forcibly cutting hair in the classroom if a students locks were deemed too long.

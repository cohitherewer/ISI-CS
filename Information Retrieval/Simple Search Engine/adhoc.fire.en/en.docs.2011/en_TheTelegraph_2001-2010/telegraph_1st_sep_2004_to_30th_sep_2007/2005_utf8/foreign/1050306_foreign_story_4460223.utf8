 Pak rape victim fears for her life

 Islamabad, March 5 (Reuters): A Pakistani victim of gangrape said today that her life was in danger after the acquittal of five of the six men that she accused.

 In a surprise decision on Thursday, a High Court in the central city of Multan struck down a lower court decision which found the men guilty of raping Mukhtaran Mai, 30, on the orders of a village council in July 2002. The High Court commuted the death sentence of a sixth man to life in prison in an appeal hearing in which the men pleaded not guilty.

 The High Court acquitted the men on lack of evidence. Mai said that she was ?pained? at the court decision.

 ?There are all kinds of dangers for me now,? Mai said in the capital Islamabad. ?They can kill me. They are a threat for my family ... I appeal to the government not to free them.?

 Mai was raped on the orders of a village council which wanted to avenge the alleged relations of her brother with a woman belonging to the superior Mastoi tribe. Mais brother was also kidnapped and sodomised by Mastoi men.

 The Thursday?s court decision once again brought into focus Mai?s case which shocked the country and raised an international outcry over the treatment of women in this Islamic nation of around 150 million people.

 Gangrapes and honour killings of women are common in Pakistans tribal and feudal dominated rural areas.

 In most of the cases the rapist and killers go free because of the poor standard of police investigations and flaws in the countrys legal system. Mai said that she would continue to fight for justice despite the acquittal of the convicts.

 ?Inshallah (God willing), I will appeal in the Supreme Court. I hope I will get justice there,? she said in her native Saraiki language. 

 ?There is another court. And that is the court of Allah ... I will definitely get justice from Him.?

 There has been no official comment on the case, but local newspapers and human rights groups said the acquittal showed lack of commitment by the government to curb crimes against women.

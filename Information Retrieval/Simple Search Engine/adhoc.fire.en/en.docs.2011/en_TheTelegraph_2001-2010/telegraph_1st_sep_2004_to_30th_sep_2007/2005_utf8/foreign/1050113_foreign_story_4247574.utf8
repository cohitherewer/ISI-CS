 Baikonur rocket fuel causing illness in children

 London, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Unburned fuel from rockets launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is causing serious illnesses in children living near the site, a leading science journal said today.

 Researchers from Vector, the State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology in Novosibirsk, showed in an unpublished study that children in areas of Siberia where the fuel is sprayed during take-off suffer health problems. ?The level of some diseases such as endocrine and blood disorders in polluted areas is more than twice the regional average, they say,? according to the journal Nature.

 Baikonur, which is used by the Russian space agency, Rosaviakosmos, European Space Agency (ESA) and Nasa, is the launch pad for many missions to the International Space Station and a source of income for the Russian government.

 An unnamed expert on the country?s space industry told the journal that profit from an individual commercial launch could be as much as $25 million.

 Nature, a peer-review journal, said it published the report as a news story because it has important implications.

 ?The first detailed epidemiological study of people living under the flight path suggests that the rocket fuel is indeed causing health problems,? it said in an editorial.

 Vector scientist Sergey Zykov estimates dozens of litres of unburned fuel from spent rocket stages containing toxic substances are sprayed over several kilometres during a launch. ?Most other major bases used by Nasa and ESA, such as Cape Canaveral in Florida, send rockets out over the ocean,? the journal said. When Nature approached Rosaviakosmos about the study, it rejected the findings. Other scientists who have raised the issue told the journal they had been arrested or harassed.

 ?Despite using Baikonur for launches, neither Nasa nor ESA accepts responsibility for the problems associated with the site,? the journal said.

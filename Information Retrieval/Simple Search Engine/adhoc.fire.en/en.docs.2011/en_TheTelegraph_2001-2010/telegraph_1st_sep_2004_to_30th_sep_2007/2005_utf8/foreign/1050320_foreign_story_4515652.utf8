 ?Wolfie? woos critics

 Paul Wolfowitz

 Washington, March 19 (Reuters): Paul Wolfowitz, picked by President George W. Bush to head the World Bank, said yesterday his image as an architect of the Iraq war was an incomplete portrait and he was confident he could win over his critics for the job.

 In an interview, Wolfowitz said that if confirmed in the post,?I am certainly not going to impose the US agenda on the bank.?Such words are intended to comfort his critics in Europe and elsewhere who fear that he would change bank policies to reflect Bush?s foreign and social policies.

 The US deputy defence secretary described his critics as ?people who don?t know me? and said when they once ?get to know me they will realise fairly quickly that I?m about a lot more than military issues, about a lot more than just the Iraq war and that a good deal that has been written about me is an inaccurate caricature.?

 Although his candidacy is contentious because of his part in the Iraq war, Wolfowitz?s approval by the bank?s board, which operates by consensus, is likely a foregone conclusion. The US has the largest voting share on the 24-member board, which represents the 184 member states, and traditionally nominates the bank president.

 As part of an intensive lobbying effort to defuse opposition to his nomination and prepare himself for the new bank role, Wolfowitz yesterday met Asian, Saudi and French bank directors in his first meetings with board members.

 In the interview in his Pentagon office, Wolfowitz pledged to work closely with non-governmental groups active in development and poverty reduction.

 He also said relations between the World Bank and its sister organisation the IMF were a ?critical issue.? The World Bank and IMF are often criticised for overlapping in their work in developing countries.

 Wolfowitz, nicknamed Wolfie by President George Bush, said that while there was no single answer to the challenge of terrorism, working to reduce poverty could diminish the terrorist threat.

 He described the relationship between terrorism and poverty as complicated, because some leading militants, including Osama Bin Laden were wealthy, while the people they recruited often lived in miserable conditions.

 Some theorists argue reducing poverty will remove a rationale that propels some people into extremist acts.

 Rape victim: I was expelled

 Islamabad, July 4 (PTI): A Pakistani doctor, whose alleged gangrape sparked protests among local tribesmen in southern Baluchistan province, has claimed that she was expelled from the country. 

 I requested justice, but they expelled me from the country, leaving me at the mercy of others, Dr Shazia Khalid said on telephone from London. Dr Shazia, an employee of the Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, was allegedly gangraped by security personnel in January.

 She alleged that the Pakistan government deceived her by expelling her from the country along with her spouse. Her statement was reported by the BBC and published by the Daily Times here today. The doctor made her first public appearance after she had left the country for Britain when a tribunal in Pakistan declared her alleged culprits not guilty. I was not willing to come to Britain, but frequent threats forced me to leave my country, she said adding that she was still scared. 

 Dr Shazia, who failed to identify any of her alleged rapists during an identification parade, said she was not satisfied with the investigations. The tribunal investigations were scheduled to be held in Baluchistan but the Sindh chief secretarys assistant asked me to appear before the tribunal in Karachi. They also forcibly took an undertaking (from me) that I was ill and could not appear at the tribunal in Baluchistan.

 Tasty chocolate art

 Paris, April 18 (AFP): If art is a question of taste, the Australian painter Sid Chidiac, whose works are entirely made of fine Belgian chocolate, has given himself a head start in the popularity ratings.

 Chidiac introduces himself as an oil and chocolate painter, most people assume they have misheard him. In the past three years, the 36-year-old has conjured up dozens of works from pure chocolate ? complete with edible frame, canvas and richly-coloured paint ? portraits ranging from Marilyn Monroe to chat-show host Oprah Winfrey. His tantalising technique uses a rich blend of white chocolate ? copiously donated by a major chocolate maker ? and a range of simple food colourings. 

 ?People stop and stare at my work, as if they have seen something truly different, something new,? said the artist.

 Truant teen?s tram trick

 Sydney (Reuters): An Australian teenager described by police as a good kid with an obsession for trams reached the end of the line on Monday when he faced charges over the theft of two trolley cars in Melbourne. Police say the unidentified 15-year-old stole a tram from a Melbourne depot on Sunday and even stopped to pick up passengers during a 30-minute joyride. His last stop came about 30 km away when police cut the tram?s electricity supply.

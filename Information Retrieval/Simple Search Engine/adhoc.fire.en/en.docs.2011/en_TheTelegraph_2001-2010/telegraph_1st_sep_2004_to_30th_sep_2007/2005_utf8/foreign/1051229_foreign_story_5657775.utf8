 Mideast back on short fuse

 Jerusalem, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian guerrilla groups training base in Lebanon today, the army said, after a rocket strike on an Israeli town raised border tension to its highest level in years.

 The message is to the government of Lebanon which is responsible for preventing terror attacks from its territory, Israels Major-General Udi Adam said. 

 Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible for these attacks, in that it has done nothing to dismantle the terror organisations operating from within Lebanon. 

 The attack targeted a base belonging to the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in Nameh south of Beirut and slightly wounded two of its fighters, the groups spokesman Anwar Raja said.

 He denied the groups involvement in the rocket attack against northern Israel.

 The air strike is an Israeli attempt to depict the presence of Palestinian groups in Lebanon as a source of instability while they (the Israelis) continue to violate Lebanons sovereignty in the air, land and sea, Raja said. Israel wants to bring (UN Security Council) resolution 1559 under the spotlight but we are confident that the Lebanese authorities know of this blatant attempt.

 The 2004 resolution in part demands the disarmament of all militia in Lebanon, a reference to the pro-Syrian Lebanese Hizbollah and armed Palestinian groups. The Beirut government has yet to implement the resolution.

 Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad al-Siniora condemned the rocket attack on Israel and the Israeli airstrike.

 He called on all Palestinian factions to condemn the Katyusha attack and to cooperate with the government to end Palestinian guerrilla presence outside refugee camps.

 Adam blamed Palestinian guerrillas for attempting to escalate tension along the Israel-Lebanon border by slamming at least three Katyusha rockets into the northern town of Kiryat Shemona shortly before midnight on Tuesday.

 It was the first rocket attack 

 in years against the town that was a regular target of Katyusha 

 strikes till Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 after 

 a 22-year occupation.

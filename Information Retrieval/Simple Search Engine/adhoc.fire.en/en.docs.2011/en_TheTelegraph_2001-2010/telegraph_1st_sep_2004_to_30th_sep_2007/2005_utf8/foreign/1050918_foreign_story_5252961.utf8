 Leaders adopt limited goals

 United Nations, Sept. 17 (Reuters): World leaders endorsed modest reforms of the UN yesterday at the end of a summit that made only limited progress on fighting poverty and terrorism, boosting security or protecting human rights.

 The final document was adopted by consensus to polite applause after Venezuela condemned the procedure as grotesque and illegal, and the US put on record its opposition to any support, endorsement, or promotion of abortion.

 We, the leaders of the world, have for three days discussed how the UN can be strengthened to meet the challenges of the 21st century, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson, the co-chairman, told the closing session. With many leaders including President George W. Bush having left New York, those remaining voiced a mixture of hope that the biggest summit in UN history would give new momentum to development goals and disappointment at the meagre outcome.

 Secretary-general Kofi Annan hailed an unprecedented agreement on the international responsibility to intervene to protect civilians from genocide and ethnic cleansing designed to prevent a repeat of massacres in Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo.

 Other achievements he cited included the establishment of a peace-building commission to help nations emerging from conflict, and member states reaffirmation of goals set by a UN Millennium summit in 2000 to halve poverty by 2015.

 In a final statement, Persson regretted the failure to agree on a common approach to preventing the spread of nuclear arms or a comprehensive strategy to counter terrorism.

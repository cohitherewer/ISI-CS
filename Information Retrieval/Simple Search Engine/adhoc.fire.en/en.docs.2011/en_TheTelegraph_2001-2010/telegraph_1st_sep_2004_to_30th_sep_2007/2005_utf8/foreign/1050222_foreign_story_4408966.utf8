 Israel frees prisoners

 Betunia (West Bank), Feb. 21 (Reuters): Israel freed 500 Palestinian prisoners today in the largest mass release for nearly a decade, a gesture meant to bolster a ceasefire deal with new Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

 Even as smiling prisoners flashed V-for-victory signs from bus windows while passing Israeli checkpoints on the way home, the Fatah faction further strengthened Abbas? hand by approving a new cabinet with reform-minded loyalists in key posts. Prospects for peacemaking have brightened since Abbas succeeded the late Yasser Arafat on a platform of non-violence and persuaded militants to abide by a de facto truce.

 But while freed detainees met scenes of jubilation in the West Bank and Gaza, many Palestinians say Abbas will need even larger releases to get armed groups to formalise the ceasefire he agreed with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at a February 8 summit.

 Israel still holds about 8,000 prisoners, and Abbas vowed to put winning their freedom at the ?top of our priorities?. ?We feel pain because we left our brothers... in jail,? said Islamic Jihad member Hassan Abu Armana, who served two years in Israeli prisons. 

 The freeing of detainees came a day after Israel?s cabinet approved a plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, marking the first time Israel decided to dismantle settlements on land Palestinians want for a state.

 Pak: Iran did get nuke tech

 Abdul Qadeer Khan

 Islamabad, March 10 (Reuters): Pakistan acknowledged today for the first time that a disgraced Pakistani scientist at the centre of a nuclear black market gave Iran centrifuges which can be used to make atomic weapons.

 Centrifuges purify uranium for use as fuel in atomic power plants or bombs. Washington believes Iran?s centrifuge programme, which it concealed from UN inspectors for nearly two decades, is at the heart of clandestine atom bomb plans.

 Tehran says its enrichment programme will produce only low-grade enriched fuel for power plants, not highly enriched uranium for weapons. ?(Abdul Qadeer Khan) has given centrifuges to Iran, but the government was in no way involved in this,? Pakistani information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said.

 Pakistan has admitted in the past that Khan, dubbed the father of Pakistan?s atomic bomb, smuggled nuclear secrets to North Korea, Iran and Libya. But this is the first time Islamabad admitted that Khan supplied Iran with centrifuges.

 The UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was not surprised by Pakistan?s public confirmation of Khan?s role in Iran?s programme. ?We?re well aware that Iran received designs and centrifuge components from the Khan network,? IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said.

 The agency has found no clear proof of an Iranian nuclear arms programme, but is not convinced Iran declared everything.

 One western diplomat in Vienna, where the IAEA is based, said Khan clearly knows the answer to the question of whether or not Iran wanted the bomb when it first made contact with Khan?s clandestine nuclear network in 1987.

 ?Khan is the man who would know if the Iranians wanted nuclear weapons,? the diplomat said on condition of anonymity, adding that it was a pity Islamabad refuses to allow the IAEA to question Khan directly.

 Several Vienna diplomats said there is no way Islamabad was was entirely unaware of Khan?s atomic peddling.

 Navy tanker fire

 At least six navy personnel were killed and up to 95 hurt, many of them seriously, when fire broke out aboard a Pakistan navy tanker during routine dockside maintenance in Karachi today, officials said.

 ?The number of deaths has climbed to six,? a senior Navy official said on condition of anonymity.

 MTV to follow Jolie into Kenya villages

 Jolie: Girl positive

 Los Angeles, Aug. 18 (Reuters): MTV plans to chronicle a visit to poverty-stricken African villages by actor Angelina Jolie on September 14, three months after co-star and off-screen companion Brad Pitt gained notice with a similar ABC special.

 The MTV documentary will follow Jolie as she accompanies UN adviser and economist Jeffrey Sachs on a trip to Sauri, a remote group of villages in western Kenya where his team is battling hunger and disease, the cable channel said this week.

 The 30-minute programme, a special episode of MTVs long-running Diary series spotlighting celebrities, will coincide with the opening of a UN special summit on goals for improving living standards in developing nations.

 The actor, an Oscar winner for Girl, Interrupted, has visited UN operations around the world as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees since 2001.

 Sachs serves as a special adviser to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, as well as director of the UN Millennium Project. He also is head of Columbia Universitys Earth Institute.

 The Viacom Inc.-owned network said the special is part of its think MTV initiative, aimed at encouraging greater social activism on the part of its young audience.

 Im certain the stories in this special will inspire viewers the same way these experiences have inspired me, Jolie said in a statement.

 Jolies four-year-old son, Maddox, was adopted in 2003 from a Cambodian orphanage, and the actor recently adopted a baby girl she named Zahara Marley, who was orphaned by AIDS in Ethiopia. Pitt, who co-starred with Jolie in the film Mr. and Mrs. Smith, travelled with her to Africa last month to finalise that adoption.

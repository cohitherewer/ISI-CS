 Envoy in linguistic ordeal

 Moscow, April 20 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice tried out her rusty Russian in a Moscow radio interview today, only to get caught out by a question on whether she might run for president.

 ?Da (Yes),? Rice answered in Russian, before realising her misunderstanding and hastily adding: ?Nyet? (No) ? seven times. Rices interview on Ekho Moskvy radio turned into a linguistic ordeal when the Soviet expert fielded a schoolgirl listeners question on how she achieved her career success. ?It?s too complicated to answer!? Rice started out in English. She then switched into Russian, but quickly hit trouble. 

 Apparently meaning to say that she would like to do her next interview in the language of her host, she chose a verb that sounded more like ?to earn money? than the Russian for ?to do?.

 Cover bald patch with insurance

 BRUCE JOHNSTON

 Rome, June 16: Italians worried about their image are taking out insurance against going bald. 

 The policy is open to anyone aged between 15 and 70, of either sex. It was developed by an insurance firm and a chain of hair care clinics, which ask for ?220 annual premiums regardless of how much or how little hair the insured party has.

 The pay-out, capped at ?5,300, depends on the amount of hair lost between a client first taking out insurance and their final claim. Policy holders also get two free check-ups a year and a kit of products for healthy hair, the use of which is not a condition of the policy.

 Italy pays particular attention to baldness, with widespread advertising devoted to the problem. Despite this, many of Italys great men rejoiced in their smooth pates. Mussolini had a reputation for being especially virile, while the hairless Pierluigi Collina is footballs most recognisable referee.

 However, the countrys Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, had a hair transplant and facelift last summer. Catello Balsamo, the president of the Italian Society of Hair Surgeons, said public interest in hair transplants had surged after Berlusconis operation.

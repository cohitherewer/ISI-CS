 Bikini bar on toddlers

 Oslo, March 31 (Reuters): A Swedish bikini-style top for toddlers will be withdrawn from sale amid criticism from a Norwegian cabinet minister that bra-like clothing was inappropriate for small girls.

 ?It is remarkably daft to make bra-like bikinis for one-year-olds,? Norwegian minister of children and family affairs Laila Daavoey was quoted as telling the Norwegian daily Verdens Gang today.

 ?This is a terrible commercialisation of childhood. Children are not women. Bikinis on small children are a way of linking children to sexuality. We must say: ?No? to this,? she said.

 Kate has a fling in Little Children

 Kate Winslet

 Los Angeles, April 12 (Reuters): Kate Winslet is in negotiations to star in Little Children for New Line Cinema.

 Winslet will play the role of Sarah in the adaptation of Tom Perrotta?s book. The film will be directed by Todd Field who made films like In the Bedroom and The Haunting. 

 Field co-wrote the Little Children screenplay with Perrotta, whose novel Election was the basis for Alexander Payne?s 1999 film.

 The film is set in a suburban town where perfect parents rear perfect children by day and surf Internet porn and have affairs by night. Winslet?s character is a mother who has a fling with a stay-at-home dad.

 Winslet starred last year in Finding Neverland and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which she received her fourth Oscar nomination.

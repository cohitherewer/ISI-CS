 Castro ire over Forbes infamy

 Havana, March 17 (Reuters): Cuban President Fidel Castro criticised Forbes magazine yesterday for the ?infamy? of listing him among the world?s richest people, with a net worth of $550 million.

 ?Once again, they have committed the infamy of speaking about Castro?s fortune, placing me almost above the queen of England,? Castro said in a speech to top officials of Cuba?s ruling Communist Party, military and police. ?Do they think I am (former Zairian President) Mobutu (Sese Seko) or one of the many millionaires, those thieves and plunderers that the empire has suckled and protected?? he said in reference to his capitalist arch enemy, the US. ?What they should be doing is looking for the money of all those people,? he said.

 Castro, 78 and in power since a 1959 revolution, said he was considering suing. It was the second straight year Castro was on the Forbes list. Last year, the magazine put his worth at $150 million. Forbes on Tuesday published a story on the fortunes of rulers and heads of state, which included Castro, Britain?s Queen Elizabeth and the sultan of Brunei, saying none were ?exemplars of capitalism? and did not qualify for the world billionaires list. 

 ?In the past, we have relied on a percentage of Cuba?s gross domestic product to estimate Fidel Castros fortune,? Forbes explained. ?This year, we have used more traditional valuation methods, comparing state-owned assets Castro is assumed to control with comparable publicly traded companies,? it said.

 The magazine said Castro derived his fortune from a web of state-owned companies that included retail and pharmaceutical businesses and a convention centre.

 Blast rips China mine, 203 die

 Beijing, Feb. 15 (Reuters): A gas explosion ripped through a coal mine in China?s northeastern rust-belt province of Liaoning, killing at least 203 workers in the worst disaster in 15 years to hit the world?s most dangerous mining industry.

 The explosion, yesterday afternoon at the mine in Fuxin city, injured 22 miners and 13 were still trapped, the official Xinhua news agency said today. A rescue team of more than 180 people were working to free the trapped workers.

 The blast occurred 242 metres below ground at about 0700 GMT yesterday at the Sunjiawan colliery of the state-owned Fuxin Coal Industry Group, Xinhua said, citing the Liaoning Coalmine Safety Supervision Bureau.

 ?We have never seen such a big accident before,? said an official at Fuxin?s Coalmine Safety Supervision Bureau. ?The rescue operations are still going on and the coal mine is still verifying the conditions of workers. We don?t know the real cause of the accident because the formal investigation has yet to start,? he said.

 More than 200 workers were underground at the time of the blast, he said, largely in line with Xinhua?s reports that 238 miners were involved.

 Workers reported feeling a sudden, strong tremor shake the mine 10 minutes before the blast, Xinhua said, quoting Zhang Yunfu, vice-general manager of Fuxin Coal. Moments later, gas detectors lost their signals and one of the mine?s main pits filled with smoke, it said.

 President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao called for officials to take ?all possible measures? to rescue trapped workers, state television said.

 The mining industry is the world?s biggest and its most deadly despite being the target of regular government campaigns to enhance safety and clean up the poorly regulated sector, the main source of fuel for the world?s seventh-biggest economy. 

 China was the site of the world?s worst recorded mining disaster when up to 1,572 people were killed on April 26, 1942, in an explosion at the Honkeiko mine. 

 The 22 injured workers, some with burns, were taken to hospital. Liaoning governor Zhang Wenyue was supervising rescue operations at the mine, which employed 3,100 workers and was designed to produce up to 1.5 million tonnes of coal a year.

 Output at the mine used to be low, Xinhua said, before it was acquired three years ago by Fuxin Coal, one of China?s biggest coal producers. It was classified as a ?high-gas? mine, with high levels of potentially combustible gases.

 A Fuxin resident said many of her neighbours worked for the mine. ?We are of course shocked and feel very sad about it because people are still enjoying the Lunar New Year,? she said.

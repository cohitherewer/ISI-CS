 Fine Print

 Steamy Scooter

 New York, Nov. 8 (Reuters): A steamy novel by Lewis Scooter Libby has become a hot item now that vice- president Dick Cheneys chief of staff is under indictment.

 inscribed copy of The Apprentice: A Novel, which Libby wrote in 1996 when he was a relative unknown outside Washington, was on sale on online bookseller Amazon.com yesterday for $2,400. Unsigned hardcover copies were going for $700.

 Now out of print, the novel tells the story of an innkeeper apprentice in a bizarre coming-of-age story set in Japan in 1903. It is littered with edgy sexual material and strong language.

 Libby was charged last month with perjury in a special prosecutors probe into how a CIA operatives identity was leaked to journalists.

 Ad apology

 Rome (Reuters): One of Italys 

 most popular magazines, the wholesome Famiglia Cristiana 

 weekly, will apologise to its readers for printing an advertisement 

 which showed a womans naked bottom, the magazine said 

 on Tuesday. The advert caused a storm as it was the first 

 time the Catholic magazine, whose title means Christian 

 Family, had shown nudity, a common feature in many 

 non-religious magazines in Italy in both advertising and 

 editorial content. 

 Tricky tax

 Amsterdam (Reuters): While most people try to avoid paying taxes as best as they can, some Dutch firms have discovered they can earn more money by doing just the opposite. Because the Dutch treasury pays 5 per cent interest on any excess amount paid that it returns later ? more than commercial banks would offer ? some firms gladly accept an estimate that is too high, Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm complained on his weblog on Monday. If it turns out they need the money after all, they just submit a new estimate, Zalm said, adding this kind of banking with the government needed to stop as quickly as possible.

 Sleuth test

 Bogota (Reuters): Colombias scandal-shaken 

 state security agency will investigate detectives 

 bank accounts and make them take lie detector tests in a 

 drive to root out corruption, the agency said on Friday. 

 The anti-corruption drive comes as the Administrative Security 

 Department, or DAS, which is Colombias equivalent 

 to the FBI, is reeling from the resignation of its chief 

 amid media reports agents had links to Right-wing paramilitaries.

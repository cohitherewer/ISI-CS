 Sir John Mills, acting legend, dies

 Sir John Mills

 London, April 23 (Reuters): British actor Sir John Mills, who won an Oscar in 1971 for his portrayal of a mute village idiot in Ryan?s Daughter, died today aged 97, a trustee for his estate said.

 ?Sir John died this morning at around 0530 GMT. He?d been ill for about a month with a chest infection,? the trustee said. Mills made his name in patriotic films during and after World War II including The October Man, Scott of the Antarctic, Dunkirk and Ice Cold in Alex.

 Handsome and dapper, he embodied to many the archetypal British war hero, either as the cool-headed gentleman officer or the resigned working class soldier. His first big break came in 1946, when he played Pip in a film version of Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations. He always maintained his favourite movie was the 1960 production Tunes of Glory, in which he co-starred with Alec Guinness.

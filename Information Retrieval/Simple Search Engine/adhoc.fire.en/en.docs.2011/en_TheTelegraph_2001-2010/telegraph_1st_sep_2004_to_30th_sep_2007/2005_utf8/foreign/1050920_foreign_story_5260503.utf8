 Fine Print

 Jamaica union

 Berlin, Sept. 19 (Reuters): Jamaica appeared an unlikely winner of Germanys general election today as a coalition of parties sharing the colours of its flag became a possibility.

 Germans often refer to parties by their colours: red for the Social Democrats, black for the conservatives, yellow for the Free Democrats and, predictably, green for the Greens.

 Yesterdays inconclusive election result means an inventive new alliance may be needed to replace the old red-green coalition. Television commentator Joerg Schoenenborn mentioned the idea of a Jamaica coalition ? black, yellow and green, like the islands flag ? yesterday after exit polls were published.

 Within three hours it was being used by economists, politicians, journalists and travel agents.

 sold nationwide for Sundays Mid-Autumn Festival, Xinhua 

 news agency said on Monday.

 Angers (France), July 27 (Reuters): A French court today convicted and sentenced 62 people for taking part in a child prostitution ring engaged in the sexual abuse of children as young as six months.

 Billed as the biggest child sex trial in France, 65 men and women were accused of taking part in a child prostitution ring, in which 45 children, aged from six months to 15 years, were raped or sexually assaulted between 1999 and 2002. 

 The court sentenced Philippe V, accused of raping his own grandchildren, to 28 years in jail. Prosecution had described the 59-year-old as a predator, and had called for a 30-year jail sentence.

 Prosecution had also called for 30 years in prison for Eric J. and Jean-Marc J., two central figures of the prostitution ring. They received sentences of 28 and 26 years respectively.

 Labelling some of the accused monsters, prosecutors had called for jail terms of between six months and 30 years. The defence lawyers, who called for the acquittal of some 30 people because of lack of material proof, say some of the accused suffered abuse during their own childhood.

 Some of them were charged with raping their own children or offering them to others for sex, often for food or small sums of money. Most were from low-income backgrounds and were poorly educated. Some were illiterate.

 The trial of an alleged prostitution ring in Outreau, northern France, caused uproar last year when a court convicted 10 of 17 defendants even though the main accuser had withdrawn her charges.

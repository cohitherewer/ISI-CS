 Holocaust row erupts again

 Tehran, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said today that the Holocaust was a myth, triggering a fresh wave of international condemnation.

 Last week Ahmadinejad first aired his doubts on the veracity of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed by the Nazis. His comments drew a rebuke from the UN Security Council.

 They have fabricated a legend under the name Massacre of the Jews, and they hold it higher than God himself, religion itself and the prophets themselves, he told a crowd in the southeastern city of Zahedan today. 

 European countries called the remarks unacceptable and said they could undermine plans for talks with Tehran on its controversial nuclear programme.

 Israel said the comments showed Irans rogue regime was acting outside acceptable international norms.

 Ahmadinejad, a former Revolutionary Guardsman who was elected President in June, in October called Israel a tumour which must be wiped off the map, provoking a diplomatic storm and stoking up fears about Irans nuclear ambitions.

 Washington accuses Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear programme is only for generating electricity.

 German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Holocaust remarks could weigh on European Union efforts to resolve the dispute over Irans nuclear programme. The recent remarks by the Iranian President... are certainly shocking and unacceptable, he said.I cannot deny that they may weigh on our bilateral relations and naturally also on the chances for the negotiations on (Irans) so-called nuclear dossier.

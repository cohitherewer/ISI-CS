 Prosecutions accuser mother plan backfired

 Santa Maria (California), June 14: Eight months ago, defence attorney Thomas A. Mesereau Jr. made a strategic move that may have provided the key to Michael Jacksons court victory: He hired a new private investigator and told him to focus relentlessly on the accusers mother.

 Scott Ross had worked on the Robert Blake defence, digging up unsavoury items about the actors murdered wife. The information allowed defence lawyers to argue that someone other than Blake, who was charged with killing her, had a motive. Moreover, the details gave jurors a reason to dislike the dead woman.

 Mesereau wanted a repeat performance, and he gave his investigator a simple, blunt instruction, Ross recalled yesterday: I want you to do to [the mother of the alleged victim] what you did to Bonny Lee Bakley.

 Yesterday, as the Jackson jurors talked about their deliberations, they made clear how well Mesereaus strategy had succeeded.

 What mother in her right mind would? just freely volunteer your child to sleep with someone, and not so much just Michael Jackson but anyone, for that matter? That is something mothers are naturally concerned with, said juror number 10, a forty-something mother in business attire.

 Mesereaus strategy triumphed. But ironically, it was a decision by prosecutors that made it possible. 

 Rather than file a narrow case against Jackson that would have turned on only the testimony of Jacksons youthful accuser, Santa Barbara county district attorney. Tom Sneddon gambled that a broader indictment would have a greater chance of success. The indictment included a conspiracy charge centring on accusations that Jacksons aides had conspired to kidnap the mother and keep her at Neverland, the stars ranch.

 The prosecutor went for every strategic advantage. He thought he could broaden the case with the conspiracy charge, said Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson. By doing that, he made the mother the focus of the case, and it backfired on him.

 Analysts yesterday called Sneddons decision a fundamental miscalculation. 

 Because Sneddon put the mother on the stand, Mesereau was able to give the jury the allegations that Ross and other investigators had dug up: that the mother had committed welfare fraud, that she had lied in a previous civil suit, that she had left Neverland to get her legs waxed at precisely the time she later claimed she was being held at the ranch against her will.

 The mother was the weakest link in the case. She was walking, talking reasonable doubt, said Levenson, a former federal prosecutor.

 Afghan row over Indian fashion show

 Kabul, Oct. 9 (Reuters): An aide to Afghan President Hamid Karzai has denounced two women who appeared half naked last week at a beauty contest and fashion show, saying their actions were illegal under Islamic law.

 Sutara Bahramia wore a bikini at the Miss Earth beauty pageant in Manila while Vida Samadzai appeared in a bra and loose skirt at a fashion show in India.

 I heard that they have come out half naked in public. Curse be to those who appear this way in front of the public, said Mohaiuddin Baloch, a religious adviser to Karzai.

 This is totally illegitimate from the view point of Shariat (Islamic law). This is a crime and illegal. Both Bahramia and Samadzai have lived abroad for many years.

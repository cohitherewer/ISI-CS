 Mugabe ire

 Rome, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe today railed against President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, calling them unholy men and international terrorists bent on world domination.

 Mugabe departed from his text at a ceremony for the 60th anniversary of the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation to accuse Bush and Blair of illegally invading Iraq and looking to unseat governments elsewhere. Must we allow these men, the two unholy men of our millennium, who in the same way as Hitler and Mussolini formed (an) unholy alliance ... to attack an innocent country? he said,. The voice of Bush and the voice of Blair cant decide who shall rule in Zimbabwe, who shall rule in Africa, who shall rule in Asia, who shall rule in Venezuela, who shall rule in Iran, who shall rule in Iraq, he said.

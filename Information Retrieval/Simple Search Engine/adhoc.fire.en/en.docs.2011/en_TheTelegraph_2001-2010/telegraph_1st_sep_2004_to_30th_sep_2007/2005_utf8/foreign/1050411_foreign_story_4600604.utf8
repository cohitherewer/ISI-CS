 Cardinals hint at universal appeal 

 in Pope profile

 Rome, April 10: The Roman 

 Catholic Cardinals will take an oath of secrecy when they 

 enter the conclave to elect the next Pope, but in the week 

 since John Paul II?s death many have been publicly dropping 

 hints about what kind of man the church now needs.

 The enormous outpouring of affection 

 for John Paul has clearly had an impact on their thinking. 

 Many of the prelates said in noticeably similar language 

 that while the next Pope may have a very different style 

 than John Paul, he must above all be an effective communicator 

 of the faith who can sustain the grass-roots enthusiasm, 

 especially among youth, that John Paul generated. 

 With all but three of the 117 

 cardinal electors selected by John Paul, it is highly unlikely 

 that the new Pope will depart from his conservatism on contraception, 

 divorce, women as priests or the range of what the church 

 considers to be ?sanctity of life? issues, from stem-cell 

 research to abortion and euthanasia.

 Before the Pope?s death, many 

 cardinals and commentators said a decisive factor could 

 be geography ? whether the next Pope should come from Europe, 

 where the church is shrinking, or from Latin America, Africa 

 or parts of Asia, where the church is experiencing rapid 

 growth.

 But since the Pope?s death, the 

 cardinals have said they are looking for someone who can 

 project universal appeal with a personal humility and pastoral 

 presence that embodies the message of the gospel, as they 

 say John Paul did. It is not, many cardinals said in interviews, 

 that they must choose a great orator.

 ?He doesn?t have to be John Paul 

 II and have the same fingerprints,? said Cardinal J. Francis 

 Stafford, formerly the archbishop of Denver and now a high-ranking 

 Vatican official. ?He just has to be his authentic self,? 

 Cardinal Stafford added. ?He will lead them to Christ, and 

 that?s all that?s necessary.?

 Cardinal Stafford and others spoke 

 before yesterday, when the Vatican spokesperson, Joaqu?Navarro-Valls, 

 announced that the cardinals had decided unanimously at 

 their daily meeting ?to avoid interviews and contact with 

 the media,? whose members were ?invited to abstain? from 

 seeking out comment. 

 ?The cardinals have begun a period 

 of more intense silence and prayer in the face of the conclave,? 

 he said. Two cardinals cannot attend for health reasons, 

 bringing the total count of electors to 115, the Vatican 

 said. 

 The men who will elect one of 

 their own to be the leader of a church of more than a billion 

 people are the most ethnically and geographically diverse 

 college of cardinals in history, thanks to the effort by 

 John Paul to increase the number of non-Italians.

 Many cardinals emphasized last 

 week the need for increased dialogue with Muslim leaders. 

 ?You don?t want a clash of religions,? said Cardinal Avery 

 Dulles, a theology professor at Fordham University and a 

 non-voter. He identified ecumenism as one of two priorities 

 for the next Pope along with pushing forward with John Paul?s 

 effort to evangelise in the West.

 More than at any past conclave 

 this one has an unusually large number of papabili, 

 the Italian word to describe those with Pope potential.

 Several cardinals have indicated 

 a strong desire for someone with the pastoral qualities 

 of cardinals who are also archbishops. Perhaps none of this 

 matters, some cardinals suggested, returning to the charisma 

 issue.

 ?He has to be able to communicate 

 with rich, young people in countries like the United States 

 and France,? said Cardinal Philippe Barbarin of France. 

 ?Then he needs to be able to relate to the poor when he 

 goes to places like Brazil or Morocco or Burkina Faso. He 

 has to be a person who can explain the Gospels to every 

 type of audience. He has to really love his flock; he has 

 to understand their sufferings, their difficulties,? he 

 said. ?John Paul II was that kind of Pope.?

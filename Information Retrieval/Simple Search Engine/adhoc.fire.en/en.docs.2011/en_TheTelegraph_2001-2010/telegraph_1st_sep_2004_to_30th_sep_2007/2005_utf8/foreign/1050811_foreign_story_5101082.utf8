 Fine Print

 Cover for fines

 Stockholm, Aug 10 (Reuters): Tired of parking fines and speeding tickets? A Swedish company offers insurance against both, claiming to be the first in the field.

 Swedish drivers who register with the Bisso company at the website www.bisso.se and pay an annual fee of 850 crowns ($112) are covered against three speeding tickets a year, as long as they are not more than 30 km an hour above the limit.

 For an extra fee, drivers can buy cover against parking fines. Fines in Sweden, which has one of the best road safety records in the world, range from 800 to 2000 crowns for speeding and 425 to 700 crowns for parking offences.

 Title tug

 Tokyo (Reuters): A Japanese man aged 

 104 and his 103-year-old wife plan to claim the title of 

 worlds oldest married couple after hearing it had 

 been awarded to two Americans. Yoichi and Kazono Gomi, married 

 72 years, appeared to have difficulty recalling their ages 

 during a televised news conference in their home town of 

 Yokohama this week. But family members said their combined 

 age of 207 should entitle them to the record. Philadelphia 

 residents Herbert and Magda Brown, registered by the Guinness 

 Book of World Records as the worlds oldest couple, 

 are 105 and 100 respectively, giving them an aggregate age 

 of 205. 

 Fat fury

Newspapers reported that in rehearsals Bacon introduced the band by saying: What do you get when you put two brothers and sisters in a band? A big fat melting pot of talent.

 Day and System Of A Down topped the nominations on Wednesday

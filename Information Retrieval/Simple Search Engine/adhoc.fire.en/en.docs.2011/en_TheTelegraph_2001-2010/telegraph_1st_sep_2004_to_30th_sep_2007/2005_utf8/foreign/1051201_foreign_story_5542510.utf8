 Nepal Left plans rally

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kathmandu, Nov. 30: The Communist Party of Nepal (UML) is organising a massive rally near the Tribhuvan International airport to coincide with the return of King Gyanendra from a three-week trip to Africa. 

 Despite the prohibitory orders imposed in the valley by the government, Nepals largest Left party is mobilising its cadre for what it describes as the biggest anti-king rally ever to be held in Nepal.

 In a statement here today, the party secretary, Amrit Kumar Bohora, said the rally would be held at any cost in Baneshwor, which is near the airport. He said the meeting is being organised as part of the partys nationwide public awareness campaign against the monarchy.

 The government had yesterday issued prohibitory orders against holding demonstrations at Baneshwor. The rally is expected to bring life to a standstill in the valley and clashes between the security forces and the UML cadre cannot be ruled out.

 The Left party also submitted a memorandum to the Nepal representative of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, complaining about the governments attempts to bar democratic protests. 

 The memorandum feared that the government was gearing up to disrupt the December 2 rally and urged the UN to monitor the situation in order to defend the human and democratic rights of the people of Nepal.

 The latest government ban on protests comes two days before a unilateral ceasefire by the Maoist rebels is due to expire. 

 An alliance of Nepals seven main parties and the Maoists recently said they had agreed to work together to end the kings absolute powers.

 The Maoists, who are fighting to set up a communist state, have also agreed to end years of war and rejoin main political process after the restoration of democracy.

 But it is not clear when this will happen.

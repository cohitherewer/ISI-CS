 Dissident attack clouds China reforms

 Wen Jiabao: Bad times

 Beijing, Oct. 10 (Reuters): A vicious attack on a Chinese civil rights campaigner who encouraged villagers to vote out a village chief suspected of corruption may complicate the ruling Communist Partys plans for political reforms.

 A four-day closed-door meeting of the Communist Partys elite 354-member central committee ending tomorrow was to call for deepening reform of the political structure, Hong Kongs Beijing-backed Ta Kung Pao daily said today.

 It was unclear if the weekend attack on Lu Banglie, 35, in Taishi, a village in the southern province of Guangdong, would serve as an impetus or impediment to the partys push for political reforms. Lu is missing and feared dead.

 They have many misgivings about political reforms and are worried about stability, said Li Fan, an expert on village democracy and director of the World and China Institute, a private think-tank.

 Sources with knowledge of the reforms said intra-party democracy ? party members directly electing township party bosses ? would be expanded from the current few dozen townships in Jiangsu province in the east and Sichuan and Yunnan in the southwest.

 A pilot programme in which township chiefs are directly elected by the people would also be expanded from the current 10 townships in Sichuan and Yunnan and in Chongqing municipality.

 The party also plans to reduce to just one the number of vice-mayors, vice-governors and deputy party bosses at various levels of government to boost efficiency, they said.

 Direct elections will be gradually expanded to more townships, other provinces and higher levels, a source said.

 Analysts said the planned political reforms were aimed at curbing rampant corruption, boosting efficiency, transparency and accountability and perpetuating, and not ending Communist rule.

 Premier Wen Jiabao, in an interview with the Washington Post in 2003, defended Chinas decision not to hold direct elections at higher levels of office, saying the conditions were not ripe because of the inadequate education level of the population.

 But when British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited last month, Wen pledged to press ahead with development of democratic politics, including direct elections, in an unswerving way.

 The communists flirted in the late 1980s with political reforms, which grounded to a halt after the army crushed the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests on June 4, 1989.

 The party experimented with political changes in recent years but has ruled out Western-style democracy. 

 It is determined to cling to power, but alarmed by growing social tensions.

 Without transparency, there can be no fairness, Tian Yingkui, who teaches economics at the Central Party School which trains up-and-coming Communist cadres, wrote.

 (We should) adhere to marketising the economy, democratising politics, making society fair and (government) decisions transparent, Tian wrote in the weekly magazine Outlook, which is published by the official Xinhua news agency.

 The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, opposition parties sweeping to power in Asias fledgling democracies andcolour revolutions toppling dictatorships in post-Soviet Ukraine and Georgia have all contributed to Chinas fear and resistance of elections and a free press.

 Its all lofty words. They are not prepared to push through real political reforms, Zhang Zuhua, a political theorist and expert on the Chinese constitution, said by telephone. (Additional reporting by Guo Shipeng)

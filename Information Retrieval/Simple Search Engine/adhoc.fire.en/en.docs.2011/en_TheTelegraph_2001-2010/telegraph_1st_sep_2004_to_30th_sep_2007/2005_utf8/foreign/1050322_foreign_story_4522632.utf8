 Ring rush

 Los Angeles, March 21 (Reuters): DreamWorks?s horror sequel The Ring Two, took the number one spot at the North American box office this weekend, knocking the more family-oriented animated sci-fi flick Robots, into second place.

 Ring Two, starring Naomi Watts and David Dorfman as a mother and her brooding son who are haunted by an evil entity and a mysterious unmarked videotape, pulled in $36 million in over the March 18-20 weekend.

 Fox?s Robots, which features the voices of Mel Brooks, Halle Berry, Robin Williams and Ewan McGregor as gleaming, scrappy misfit robots, made $21.8 million over the weekend, falling 39 per cent and bringing its total to-date to $66.9 million.

 Kravitz gave a $5,000 electric guitar to Brazilian President 

 Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Saturday to help him raise

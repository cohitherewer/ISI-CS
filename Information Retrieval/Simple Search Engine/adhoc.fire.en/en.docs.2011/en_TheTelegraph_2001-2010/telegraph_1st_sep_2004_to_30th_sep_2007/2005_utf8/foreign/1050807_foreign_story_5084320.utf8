 Hiroshima, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of people from around the world gathered in Hiroshima today to renew calls for the abolition of nuclear arms on the 60th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city.

 Under a blazing summer sun, survivors and families of victims assembled at the Peace Memorial Park near ground zero, the spot where the bomb detonated on August 6, 1945, killing thousands and levelling the city.

 The anniversary comes as regional powers meet in Beijing to urge North Korea to give up its nuclear programme, seen by Tokyo as a threat and one of the reasons behind rising calls in Japan to strengthen its defence and seek closer military ties with the US. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was among those attending the ceremony in Hiroshima, 690 km southwest of Tokyo. At 8.15 am, the time when the US B-29 warplane Enola Gay dropped the bomb, people at the park observed a minutes silence in memory of those who perished.

 Bells at temples and churches rang and passengers on the streetcars that run throughout the city bowed their heads in remembrance of the dead, including those incinerated while riding the streetcars. Hiroshima mayor Tadatoshi Akiba said in that the five established nuclear powers as well as India and Pakistan werejeopardising human survival.

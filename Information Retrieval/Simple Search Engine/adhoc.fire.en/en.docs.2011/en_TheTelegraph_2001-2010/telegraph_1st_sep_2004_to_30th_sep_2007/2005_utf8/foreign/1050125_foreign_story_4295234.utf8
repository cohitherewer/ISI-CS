 Yahoo baby story a fake

 Bucharest, Jan. 24 (Reuters): A Romanian tabloid said today it had fired a reporter for making up a story about a couple who named their son Yahoo as a sign of gratitude for meeting over the Internet.

 Bucharest daily Libertatea published a story this month saying two Romanians had named their baby for the popular website and printed a picture of his birth certificate. ?It was the reporter?s child?s birth certificate, which he modified,? said Simona Ionescu, Libertatea?s deputy editor-in-chief. ?We fired him.?

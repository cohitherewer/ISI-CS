 Shia former exile leads race for Iraq PM

 Ibrahim al-Jaafari

 Baghdad, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Shia politician and former exile Ibrahim al-Jaafari emerged as the front-runner today to become Iraq?s new Prime Minister as horse-trading to decide who gets what job in the next government entered final stages.

 Jaafari, a physician and father of five, is the leader of the Dawa Party, one of two leading religious parties in the United Iraqi Alliance, a Shia led group which won 48 per cent of the vote in Iraq?s elections on January 30.

 ?The competition is still fierce but it appears so far that Jaafari will be the United Iraqi Alliance candidate because Dawa is insisting on him,? a senior Shia source said.

 While short of the 60 per cent the alliance had expected, the win puts the coalition in a commanding position to take the top job in the next government. A two-thirds majority is needed in the newly-elected National Assembly to form a government.

 The United Iraqi Alliance, which is blessed by top Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, is headed by Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), both of which opposed Saddam Hussein from exile in Iran.

 The source said SCIRI, headed by Abdel-Aziz al-Hakim, had agreed to support Jaafari and withdraw its candidate, finance minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, ?to preserve the unity of the alliance?, which some had feared could collapse after the vote. But the source said a final deal was unlikely to be concluded as other details about the new government, including who gets which ministries, must still be worked out.

 Analysts expect the Kurds, who took 25 per cent of the vote, to play a key role in the talks as Iraqis look towards a reduction and eventual withdrawal of US troops.

 The Kurds? powerful showing puts them in a kingmaker role ? if they ally with the Shia alliance, the pair would have more than two-thirds in the Assembly.

 The Kurds have said they want Jalal Talabani, the head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, to be Iraq?s President. If that is the case, they are likely to support the Shia list?s choice for Prime Minister.

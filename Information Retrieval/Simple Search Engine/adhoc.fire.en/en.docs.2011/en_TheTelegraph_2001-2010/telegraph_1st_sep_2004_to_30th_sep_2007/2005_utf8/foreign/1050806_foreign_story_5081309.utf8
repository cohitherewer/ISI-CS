 2 anti-India militant groups face ban

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Aug. 5: Two militant Islamic organisations, which have campaigned against India on the question of Kashmir, are to be proscribed or banned in Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair said today. 

 They are Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), which has been active in universities and among young Muslims generally, and its breakaway group, Al-Muhajiroun (Arabic for The Emigrants). 

 Let no one be in any doubt that the rules of the games are changing, said Blair at 10, Downing Street. While some will wonder why it has taken the British government so long to get round to banning these hardline organisations, others today expressed concern that the British tradition of free speech is being compromised.

 President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan last week upbraided the British government for not banning these two organisations. 

 They (the British government) should have been doing what they have been demanding of us to do: to ban extremist groups like they asked us to do here in Pakistan and which I have done, complained Musharraf. 

 In particular, Musharraf said Britain should have banned Hizb ut-Tahrir and Al-Muhajiroun, whom he accused of preaching anger and hatred and calling for his own assassination.

 They could have banned these two groups, added Musharraf. Good action is when you foresee the future and pre-empt and act beforehand, instead of reacting as in the case of Britain ? which waited for the damage to be done and is now reacting to it. 

 Blair gave Musharraf some satisfaction by announcing: We will proscribe Hizb ut-Tahrir and the successor organisation of Al Muhajiroun. 

 Unlike Musharraf, who bans organisations but then allows them to resurface under new names, the British intend not to be so double-faced. Blair explained: We will also examine the grounds for proscription to widen them and put forward proposals in the new legislation. 

 Under the Terrorism Act 2000, the home secretary can proscribe any organisation which he believes is concerned in terrorism. The process means that membership of the groups becomes an offence, as does fund-raising for them. It seems unlikely that either group will go down without a fight. Imran Waheed, a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain, said Blairs comments were most unjust and the group would fight any ban through the courts. 

 He said: Hizb ut-Tahrir is a non-violent political party. It has had a history of non-violence for the last 50 years and these measures are like what we have seen in Uzbekistan where President Karimov has been burning his political opponents alive. Our members are all for political expression, not for violence. 

 Doubts about the wisdom of the ban were also expressed by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which is generally projected as the voice of moderate British Islam. The council said it viewed Blairs statement with concern and alarm. 

 Iqbal Sacranie, secretary-general of the council said: The MCB holds no brief for Hizb ut-Tahrir ? they are a group with whom the mainstream Muslim community has strong and well-known disagreements concerning participation in our political process. However, banning Hizb ut-Tahrir is certainly not the solution and may prove to be counterproductive. 

 Sacranie also said: We understand that Hizb ut-Tahrir in the United Kingdom are an avowedly non-violent group. If there are groups that are thought to be contravening our laws, then they ought to be prosecuted in courts of law, not driven underground. Our democratic values need to be upheld, not undermined. 

 He added: In addition, we are seeking clarification from the government to ensure that expressions of support for people who are living under brutal military occupation is not to be outlawed. That would be completely unacceptable. Our faith of Islam commands us to speak out against injustice wherever it occurs. To prohibit support for oppressed peoples would make us complicit in the injustice and would have dire consequences for the upholding of international legality. 

 He recalled the comment made by Chief Justice Lord Woolf who had stated: In defending democracy, we must not forget the need to observe the values which make democracy worth defending. 

 In the real world, concern has been growing about the activities of Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is now banned from many university campuses. 

 Al-Muhajiroun broke away from Hizb ut-Tahrir in 1996 and is now led by Anjem Choudary. At one of its conferences, The Magnificent 19, the 9/11 hijackers were praised. 

 In a world of shifting sands, it is never easy to link individuals with groups. The groups retain a deniability factor in case things go wrong. 

 However, Mohammed Bilal, a 24-year-old former student from Birmingham who died in a suicide car bombing at an Indian Army barracks in Kashmir, is also thought to have had links with Al-Muhajiroun. Nine people died in the Christmas Day bombing in 2000. 

 There have been British suicide bombers before. Two years ago, Asif Mohammed Hanif, 21, and Omar Khan Sharif, 27, went on a mission to Israel. Hanif blew himself up, while Sharif, whose bomb did not explode, was later found drowned. 

 Omar Bakri Mohammed, the self-styled quot;emir quot; of Al Muhajiroun, who is now facing expulsion from Britain, said at the time: quot;These two brothers have drawn a divine road map, one which is drawn in blood. We pray to God to accept one brother as a martyr. I am very proud of the fact that the Muslims grow closer everyday, that the Muslim land is one land and there is no more nationalism or Arabism. quot; 

 Bakri Mohammed, a Syrian based in Tottenham, north London, was quick to add that neither Hanif nor Sharif were members of his group nor were they recruited by him to go abroad and fight the jihad. 

 But equally he was proud of his part in radicalising the young Muslim men of their generation. 

 He said: quot;There are many young Muslims from Britain who have died in Kashmir and Chechnya and Afghanistan - that they are now going to Palestine is not a surprise. quot;

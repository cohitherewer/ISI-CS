 Blair to defy party rebels

 London, May 15 (Reuters): Britains Tony Blair will defy party rebels this week when he unveils plans for public service reforms and contentious anti-terrorism measures to parliament after an election in which his majority was slashed.

 But ministers signalled today they would seek compromise on at least one key piece of controversial legislation ? the introduction of identity cards ? to ensure it succeeds.

 Defeat or a narrow win in parliament could further erode the power of a Prime Minister who already risks becoming a lame duck after he said he would not stand for re-election, analysts say.

 Ministers said the government ? returned on May 5 for a historic straight third term ? would press ahead with a drastic shake-up of public services when it presented its legislative slate in a speech by Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday.

 Within a day or two well have a Queens speech setting out a radical programme of reform, new Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain told BBC Television.

 The centre-left government is set to plough on with changes to schools and hospitals that give greater influence to the private sector ? a move that irks Labour left-wingers and the partys grassroots.

 Blair is also expected to reintroduce the compulsory identity cards bill, unveil plans to tighten the asylum and immigration system, overhaul incapacity benefit and extend anti-terrorism laws.

 Hain acknowledged that operating with a majority of 67, down from 161, would be different.

 Many people blame Labours reduced majority on Blairs decision to back the US-led war in Iraq.

 We will have to fight harder to win our arguments. We wont be able to take anything for granted. Well have to build consent earlier in the process, he added.

 He signalled a willingness to compromise on details of the identity cards bill to get it into law. Public opinion overwhelmingly supports the principle of identity cards, even if we can maybe look at some of the detail if thats necessary, Hain said.

 Blair has pledged an orderly transition to a new Labour leader. Many analysts expect him to step down next year, perhaps after a planned referendum on the European Union constitution.

 China U-turn over flu cases

 RICHARD SPENCER

 Beijing, Nov. 7: The Chinese authorities performed an embarrassing about-turn yesterday and called in the World Health Organisation to examine three suspected human cases of bird flu, including one of a girl who died.

 Newspapers in Hong Kong alleged that a girl from Hunan province in central China had died from an unknown fever after eating a chicken believed to be infected with the H5N1 virus.

 The authorities were quick to deny that she had contracted bird flu but yesterday Xinhua, the state news agency, issued a brief statement saying that the disease had not been ruled out as the cause of her death, or the similar illness that affected her brother and a village teacher.

 As the cause of the illness was difficult to confirm, our country has invited WHO experts to come to China to jointly carry out further investigation into the cause of illness, said the statement, issued by the ministry of health.

 The recent outbreak of bird flu has killed 62 people in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia. Chickens are kept in similar conditions in China as in all of these southeast Asian countries. Six people died in an earlier outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997.

 China has not officially recorded a single human case, which has led to repeated rumours on anti-government websites based abroad of government cover-ups of deaths.

 The World Health Organisation has praised China for being more open about bird flu than it was about the Sars epidemic two years ago, in which hundreds of people died before the government admitted the scale of the problem.

 But the WHO has still reported long delays before being allowed to visit the sites of outbreaks and in receiving samples from infected birds, from which it could identify transmission routes through DNA testing.

 Fears of, at worst, a lack of transparency and, at best, an inability of local authorities to handle the disease, seemed to be confirmed when the two Hong Kong newspapers reported the suspicious illnesses in Hunan on October 26.

 The girl, He Yin, had died 10 days ago after eating a chicken that had fallen ill. The villages birds were later confirmed to be suffering from the disease. But local authorities said preliminary tests had proved negative for the disease, and the state news agency said she had died from pneumonia.

 It is not clear why the ministry has now revised its opinion. But some Chinese officials, and Caijing, the influential business magazine that did much to expose the Sars cover-up, have questioned whether local authorities have shown enough urgency in dealing with bird flu.

 Roy Wadia, a spokesman for the WHO in Beijing, said it was discussing methods of testing for the disease with the Chinese authorities. He suggested that the Chinese had been trying to be thorough before going public. 

 Meanwhile, authorities ordered the slaughter of all poultry in a county of the northern province of Liaoning, on the border with North Korea, after it was struck by the countrys fourth bird flu outbreak in recent weeks.

 According to some reports, more than a million birds have been killed. 

 The North Korean authorities issued a statement saying it was on its guard, and that its leader Kim Jong-il was taking a personal interest.

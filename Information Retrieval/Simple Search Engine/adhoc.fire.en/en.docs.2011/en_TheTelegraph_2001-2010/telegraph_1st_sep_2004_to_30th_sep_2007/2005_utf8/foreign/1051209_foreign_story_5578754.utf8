 Iran leader: Move Israel to Europe

 Ahmadinejad: Holocaust doubts

 Tehran, Dec. 8 (Reuters): Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today expressed doubt that the Holocaust occurred and suggested Israel be moved to Europe.

 His comments, reported by the official Irna news agency from a news conference he gave in the Saudia Arabian city of Mecca, follow his call in October for Israel to be wiped off the map, which sparked widespread international condemnation.

 Some European countries insist on saying that Hitler killed millions of innocent Jews in furnaces and they insist on it to the extent that if anyone proves something contrary to that they condemn that person and throw them in jail, Irna quoted Ahmadinejad as saying.

 Although we dont accept this claim, if we suppose it is true, our question for the Europeans is: is the killing of innocent Jewish people by Hitler the reason for their support to the occupiers of Jerusalem?

 If the Europeans are honest they should give some of their provinces in Europe ? like in Germany, Austria or other countries ? to the Zionists and the Zionists can establish their state in Europe. You offer part of Europe and we will support it, he added.

 Close allies when Iran was ruled by the US-backed Shah, Iran and Israel have become implacable foes since Irans 1979 Islamic revolution.

 Israel accuses Iran of giving arms and funding to militant Palestinian groups and of building nuclear weapons. Iran denies the charges.

 Earlier in his remarks, the Iranian President, a former Revolutionary Guardsman who won a surprise election victory in June, said: The question is where do those who rule in Palestine as occupiers come from? Where were they born? Where did their fathers live? They have no roots in Palestine but they have taken the fate of Palestine in their hands.

 Space tech to clear leaves

 London, Oct. 20 (Reuters): British rail authorities are harnessing space technology this autumn to tackle a major cause of delays on the countrys creaking network ? leaves.

 Rail operator Network Rail will use satellites to spot leaf mulch from space before specially fitted trains and leaf-busting teams are called in to clear the tracks.

 Leaf buildup has been dubbed the rail industrys equivalent of black ice, causing trains to slip on rail lines and threatening delays or accidents. We will never entirely beat Mother Nature but were as prepared as we possibly can be, said Network Rails director of operations Robin Gisby.

 In a nation used to trains arriving late, if at all, autumn is another headache for British commuters as thousands of tonnes of leaves fall onto 21,000 miles of track.

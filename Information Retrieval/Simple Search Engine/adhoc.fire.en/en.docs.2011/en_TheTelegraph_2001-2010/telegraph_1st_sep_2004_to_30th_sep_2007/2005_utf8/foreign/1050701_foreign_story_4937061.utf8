 Confirmed: Affleck marries Garner, and shes pregnant

 Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner

 New York, June 30 (AP): After months of speculation, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have tied the knot ? and shes pregnant.

 Representatives for both actors confirmed the marriage to the Associated Press today. The publicists, Ken Sunshine and Nicole King, also confirmed that Garner is pregnant with her first child. Sunshine and King would not give any other details.

 The confirmation came after US Weekly reported that Affleck, 32, and Garner, 33, were yesterday at the Parrot Cay resort in the Caribbean islands of Turks and Caicos. The National Enquirer also released photos it claimed showed Garner arriving on the islands.

 In stark contrast to Afflecks much publicised relationship with Jennifer Lopez, he and Garner have been tight-lipped about their romance from the start. Aside from appearing at a baseball team Boston Red Sox game last autumn, they have stayed out of the public eye.

 Reports in April about an engagement were never confirmed. In may, E! news reported that Garner was pregnant and the baby was due in November, but neither star confirmed that report.

 This is first marriage for Affleck and the second for Garner. The Alias star divorced actor Scott Foley in March 2004 after three and a half years of marriage.

 Affleck and Lopez called off their September 2003 wedding and broke off their engagement in January 2004. Lopez married Marc Anthony later that year.

 60 years in prison for Mississippi Klansman

 Philadelphia (Mississippi), June 23 (Reuters): Elderly former Ku Klux Klansman Edgar Ray Killen was sentenced today to 60 years in prison for the 1964 killing of three civil rights workers, the notorious crime that galvanised the civil rights movement and inspired the 1988 movie Mississippi Burning.

 Killen wore a yellow prison jumpsuit and showed no emotion as circuit judge Marcus Gordon handed down the maximum possible sentence for the 80-year-old former Baptist preacher, a punishment likely to keep him in prison for the rest of his life. 

 The judge said he took no pleasure in delivering what amounted to a life term but added: The law does not recognise a distinction of age.

 A multiracial jury convicted Killen on Tuesday on three counts of felony manslaughter, finding that he organised a posse to kidnap, beat and shoot Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney and bulldoze their bodies under an earthen dam.

 But the jury cleared him of the more serious charge of murder. Schwerner and Goodman, white New Yorkers, and Chaney, a black Mississippian, were helping blacks register to vote in Neshoba county during the Freedom Summer civil rights campaign when they were killed on June 21, 1964.

 Killen did not testify in his trial in the small Mississippi town of Philadelphia.

 His attorney said he would appeal the verdict with a challenge to the judges instruction to the jury to consider manslaughter if they could not agree on the murder charges. Killen served six months at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman in 1996 and 1997 for a felony conviction of making harassing phone calls.

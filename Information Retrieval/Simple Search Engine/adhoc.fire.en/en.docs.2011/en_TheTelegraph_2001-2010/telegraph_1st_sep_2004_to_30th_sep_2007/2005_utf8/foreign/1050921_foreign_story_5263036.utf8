 Basra burst

 Basra (Iraq), Sept. 20 (Reuters): British troops used an armoured vehicle to burst into an Iraqi jail to rescue two soldiers arrested in Basra, the British army said today after clashes that exposed tensions in the southern city.

 From an early stage I had good reason to believe the lives of the two soldiers were at risk, Brigadier John Lorimer, the British commander in Basra, said.

 He said his concern for the pair increased after he received information they had been handed over to militia elements.

 An armoured vehicle breached the perimeter wall of the jail in a Basra police station yesterday. When it was discovered that the two undercover soldiers were not there, troops rescued them from a nearby house, Lorimer said. An Iraqi government official criticised the British action.

 It is a very unfortunate development that the British forces should try to release their forces the way it happened, Haider al-Ebadi, an adviser to Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari, said.

 The rescue followed rioting in Basra that began, according to police and local officials, when the two men fired on an police patrol. At least two Iraqis were killed in the violence.

 The tough British response will further strain ties between Iraqis and British troops, who had maintained relatively good relations with the Shia population of Basra by pursuing a low-profile security policy, unlike their US allies elsewhere.

 Aping Bush 

 Brussels, March 31 (Reuters): Belgian trainers helping police to understand body language have caused a row by likening George Bush?s facial expressions to a chimpanzee?s.

 The training presentation pictured the President?s face in various expressions beside photographs of a chimpanzee, the paper showed on its front page, in what was meant to be a humourous introduction to the subject of reading expressions.

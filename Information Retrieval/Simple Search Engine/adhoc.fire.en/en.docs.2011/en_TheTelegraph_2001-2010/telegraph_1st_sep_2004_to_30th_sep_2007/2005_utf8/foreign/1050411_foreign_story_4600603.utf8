 Fine Print

 Family films

 Los Angeles, April 10 (Reuters): For years, independent films and the theatres showing them have been mainly the domain of adult stories, but two new movies and one on the way are bolstering the idea that US art houses can be family friendly.

 Millions, from British director Danny Boyle about two boys learning that wealth has little to do with money, and D.E.B.S., a spy film spoof for teen-age girls with questions about their sexuality, are now making the rounds of theatres.

 Independent film veterans cite several reasons why art houses usually lack family fare. One is their reputation for screening intellectual movies, and another is that many theatres are not located in megaplexes ? traditional venues for family films from the major studios such as The Walt Disney Co.

 Hugh home

 London (PTI): The star of Four Weddings 

 and A Funeral Hugh Grant has secretly bought a ?3-million 

 villa on the Caribbean island of Barbados for himself and 

 his heiress girlfriend Jemima Khan. The five-bedroom, five-bathroom 

 villa, with its own pool at the exclusive Royal Westmoreland 

 Golf and Country Club has sweeping views over a lake and 

 on to the ocean, a media report said. An insider at the 

 resort told the Daily Mail newspaper that Hugh and 

 Jemima were there over the new year. ?Hugh looked at properties 

 and this was the one he fell in love with.? 

 Cruz caper

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Penelope Cruz may have stayed away from Los Angeles early in her career because of the difficulty actors can have finding roles that combine beauty and brains. Whatever the reason, the Spanish beauty is back in the US with this weekend?s debut of Hollywood action flick Sahara, co-starring her current flame, Matthew McConaughey. For fans who?d rather watch her brainy side, Cruz, who turns 31 this month, is showing that off in the Italian film, Don?t Move, playing in art house theatres.

 Travel epic

 Dublin (Reuters): Children?s author Darren 

 ?Shaughnessy has two pages left in his passport ? no mean 

 feat for someone who until five years ago had rarely travelled. 

 But, since his vampire epic The Saga of Darren Shan hit 

 the big time, ?Shaughnessy has become something of a globetrotter. 

 In Japan, people queue overnight to get their hands on his 

 dark adventure tales.

 Parody puts Blunkett in bed

 Blunkett (top) and 

 Quinn: Scandalous

 London, Oct. 6: David Blunkett faces fresh embarrassment with the broadcast of a television satire about his affair with a married woman. 

 A Very Social Secretary portrays the former home secretary as foolish, love-struck and hopeless in bed. It includes one ribald sex scene in the early days of their relationship. 

 When Kimberly Quinn, the publisher of the Spectator magazine, demands he talk dirty to her, a bemused Blunkett takes a moment to think, then shouts out: Nipples! Buttocks! Knickers!

 The action then switches to the offices of the magazine where its editor, Boris Johnson, asks Quinn: Is he any good in bed? She replies by asking if he is any good as an MP. Johnson exclaims: Oh, absolutely not!

 Just how Blunkett, now work and pensions secretary, will react when the drama is shown on Channel 4s new digital entertainment channel, More4, is uncertain.

 He has already criticised what he calls the terrible garbage written in newspapers about the affair 

 The drama follows the stage play Whos The Daddy? which mercilessly satirised the affair and played to packed audiences in London.

 Bernard Hill, who has appeared in Titanic and The Lord of the Rings, gives a largely sympathetic portrayal of Blunkett in the new film. Victoria Hamilton plays Quinn as a grasping social climber interested in Blunkett only for his power. 

 At one point Tony Blair, played by Robert Lindsay questions the wisdom of his affair with a married woman. A furious Blunkett tells him: I am not having an affair. You make it sound so cheap, its not cheap. Its the best thing that ever happened to me. 

 Hill, whose resemblance to the politician is uncanny, said he felt some sympathy for him. Theres two levels to this. Theres Blunkett the human being and Blunkett the politician. At some point they got confused.

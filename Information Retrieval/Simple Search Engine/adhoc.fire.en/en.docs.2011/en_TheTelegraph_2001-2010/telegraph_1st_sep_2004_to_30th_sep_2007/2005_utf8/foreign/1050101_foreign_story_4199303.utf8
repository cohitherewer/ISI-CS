 Sydney leads in silence

 Sydney, Dec. 31 (Reuters): Australia led the world in a global minute of silence, parties were cancelled and trees on Paris? grand Champs Elysees were shrouded in black as Asia?s devastating tsunami darkened global New Year celebrations.

 Sydney, the world?s first major city to start celebrations, went ahead with its annual New Year?s eve firework displays, but revellers who flocked to the harbourside city centre were urged to remember the nearly 124,000 dead. Nations worldwide urged revellers to rein in their excesses and spare thoughts for victims and money for survivors.

 The Asian disaster has cast a long shadow over global New Year celebrations, particularly in Europe. Europeans made up the majority of the more than 2,200 foreign tourists known to be dead and more than 6,000 missing. Sweden, Norway, Finland and Germany planned to fly flags at half mast to start 2005 as a mark of respect for their many dead and missing, who had left Europe?s cold winter for the sunshine and golden sands of Asia. 

 Paris draped black mourning crepe on the trees lining the Champs Elysees to pay homage to the victims. Thousands of Parisians traditionally collect on the tree-lined boulevard in the centre of the French capital on New Year?s eve. Istanbul, with memories of a massive earthquake that rocked northwestern Turkey in 1999 and killed more than 18,000, cancelled a concert and firework display in the city centre.

 Sydney rang in the New Year with firework displays along its postcard-perfect harbour, one early show especially for children.

 Sydneysiders and a global television audience of millions were asked to observe a minute?s silence in remembrance of tsunami victims before the children?s display.

 Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra shelved a party with tennis stars, including Russian Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, and tinsel was stripped from hotel foyers. Thailand called off outdoor celebrations in memory of its 4,500 victims. In Hong Kong, political parties across the spectrum decided to postpone a New Years Day march.

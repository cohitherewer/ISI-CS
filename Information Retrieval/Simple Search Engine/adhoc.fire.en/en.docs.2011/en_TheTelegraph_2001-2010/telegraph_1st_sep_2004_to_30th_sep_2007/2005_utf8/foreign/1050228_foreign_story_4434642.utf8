 Saddam brother caught

 Baghdad, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Security forces in Iraq have captured Saddam Hussein?s half-brother, one of the country?s most wanted men and the first top-level Baathist to be caught in a year, the government announced today.

 Sabawi Ibrahim al-Hasan al-Tikriti, an intelligence chief and one-time adviser to the former President, was number 36 on the US military?s list of the 55 most-wanted people in Iraq ? the six of diamonds.

 A statement from Iraq?s government did not say when or where he was seized or whether US or Iraqi forces had captured him. 

 Last year, Iraqi officials said Ibrahim, who was born to the same mother as Saddam, was one of two former Baath Party officials directing the insurgency from Syria.

 Iraq?s US-backed government has repeatedly accused Syria of abetting the insurgency. It has called on Damascus to stop fighters entering Iraq and to track down former Iraqi regime leaders hiding there. Syria denies it supports the insurgency.

 As well as funding insurgents, Iraqi officials have accused Ibrahim of helping coordinate militant cells in Iraq. 

 His capture may put a dent in some insurgent activities, but US commanders have said in the past that the insurgency is multifaceted and innovative and may take years to defeat.

 Hailing the capture, the Iraqi government said it would seize ?all criminals who committed massacres and those who have their hands stained with the blood of the Iraqi people?.

 Ibrahim, who had a $1-million bounty on his head, is the first person on the list to be detained since February 2004, when number 41, Muhammad Zimam al-Sadun, was taken into custody. Nearly a dozen of the 55 remain at large, including Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, one of Saddam?s top aides, who is number six.

 Ibrahim?s capture follows a series of arrests of senior members of the insurgency in recent weeks, both members of the former regime and Sunni fighters.

 The government today also announced the arrest of Lieutenant Colonel Khaled Rajab, accused of running a 40-person militant cell in and around the northern city of Mosul.

 And on Friday, the government said it had captured Abu Qutaybah, described as a key lieutenant of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant who is al Qaida?s leader in Iraq.

 Despite the apparent inroads made against an insurgency that has gripped the country for nearly two years, daily suicide bomb blasts, ambushes and targeted killings persist. A bomb near Mosul today killed eight people and injured at least two more, the US military said. Several of the dead were Iraqi security guards, police said.

 The body of a female news presenter, kidnapped in Mosul a week ago as she was driving with her 10-year-old daughter, was discovered dumped by a road yesterday, neighbours of the family said. Her daughter had earlier been freed.

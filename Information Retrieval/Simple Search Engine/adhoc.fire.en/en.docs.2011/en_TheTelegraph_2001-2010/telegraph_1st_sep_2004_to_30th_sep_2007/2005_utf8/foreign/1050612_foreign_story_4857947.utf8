 London, June 11 (AP): Britains Marks and Spencer retailer today recalled thousands of childrens clothes after parents found sewing machine needles attached to several of the imported garments being sold at its department stores. 

 The company issued an urgent alert regarding about 12,000 items after two youths suffered scratches from the needles and their families complained to stores, the company said. 

 A company spokeswoman said an investigation has begun to discover why the needles were left inside the clothes by a Sri Lankan manufacturer.

 Customers who have purchased or received any of these products as gifts are asked to return them immediately, she said on condition of anonymity. 

 Sewing machine needles have been found in four items and in two cases, children suffered scratches when they put the clothes on, she said. We are in discussions with those customers about reparations and have launched an immediate investigation about the problem with our supplier.

 The affected garments are a pink two-pack jogger set, code t78/08455/2134p; pink gingham dungarees, code t78/07980/3130p; and a white T-shirt and denim jeans set, code t78/07980/3132p. All have been available in the stores since may. Also affected are pure cotton chambray pajamas, code t86/07980/2727w, which have been sold since March.

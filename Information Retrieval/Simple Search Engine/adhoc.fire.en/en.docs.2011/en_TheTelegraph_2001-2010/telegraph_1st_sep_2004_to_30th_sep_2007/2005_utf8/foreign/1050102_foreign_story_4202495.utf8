 Argentina begins new year on grim note

 Buenos Aires, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Argentina began the New Year on a grim note as families identified and prepared for burial 175 victims of a fire in a Buenos Aires rock club, including children and babies who might have died in a makeshift nursery in the bathroom.

 New Year?s celebrations were muted today as the government began handing over bodies to families with the order that they be buried and not cremated due to the criminal investigation into one of Argentina?s worst disasters.

 The blaze during a concert on Thursday night started when concertgoers launched a flare, which ignited foam on the ceiling and sent some 4,000 mostly teenage fans scrambling for the exits amid falling debris and thick smoke. Four of the six doors were locked, officials said.

 Police detained the owner of the Cromagnon Republic club yesterday to question him about overcrowding, the use of flammable materials and locking the exit doors to stop people from entering without paying. The club had a permit for 1,100 spectators.

 Officials are also looking into witness statements the club had a nursery in the women?s bathroom where parents left children while they enjoyed the concert.

 ?How could they permit such a thing?? Marcelo Calderon asked as he waited outside the morgue for the bodies of his brother and nephew. Police said witnesses had also helped them to identify three youths who might have launched the flare, but it was not known if they were among the victims.

 The government decreed three days of mourning, closed nightclubs in the capital for the New Year and cancelled all concerts.

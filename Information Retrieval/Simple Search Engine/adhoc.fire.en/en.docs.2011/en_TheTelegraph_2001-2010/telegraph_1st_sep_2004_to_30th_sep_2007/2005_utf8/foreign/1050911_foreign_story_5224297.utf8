 Wonder replicas

 Dubai, Sept. 10 (Reuters): The Gulf emirate of Dubai will build a city of life-size replicas of seven wonders of the world at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion to house offices, shops and flats, a developer said today.

 The Falcon City of Wonders is the latest of a host of ambitious construction projects in the booming trade hub, which is part of the United Arab Emirates.

 Three buildings will be modelled on structures that were part of the original list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ? the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

 Others will be replicas of more modern wonders ? the Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Great Wall of China, a statement said. 

 Date drain 

 New York (Reuters): A Manhattan fertility 

 specialist has been sued by two women who say he broke their 

 hearts after meeting them through an online dating site 

 on which he pretended to be single. The two women, Tiffany 

 Wang and Jing Huang, accused Dr Khaled Zeitoun, 46, of pretending 

 to be single and using mind games to entice them into sexual 

 relationships with tales of past lives.

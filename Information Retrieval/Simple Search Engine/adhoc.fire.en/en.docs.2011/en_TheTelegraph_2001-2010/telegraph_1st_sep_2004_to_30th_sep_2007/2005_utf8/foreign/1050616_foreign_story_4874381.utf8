 UK firm pioneers fixed-mobile phone

 The Motorola v560 handset

 London, June 15 (Reuters): BT Group Plc has unveiled a pioneering, low-cost cellphone that switches between fixed and mobile networks as the British company steps up efforts to stem a tide of calls moving from landline to cellular networks.

 After more than a year of planning, BT said today an initial 400 customers would use its new BT Fusion handset, made by US vendor Motorola Inc, which hooks onto BTs fixed-line network at home or in the office and automatically latches onto a wireless network when callers are on the move.

 Customers using the black and silver clamshell v560 handset, which also offers video and digital photo services, will pay land-line prices of 5.5 pence for up to one hour of off-peak calls and 3 pence a minute for peak calls to land-line numbers. 

 BT ? which is using Vodafones mobile phone network and selling two keenly-priced tariff plans for ?9.99 and ?14.99 per month ? said an off-peak 10 minute call would cost up to 95 per cent less than a typical mobile call.

 Youre getting the cost of a fixed line, the convenience of a mobile and better coverage, Ian Livingston, head of BTs consumer division BT Retail said on a conference call.

 Consulting firm Ovum called the new service a watershed in a telecoms and technology industry that is offering increasingly intertwined and so-called converged services. 

 It is not overstating the case to say that the industry will never be the same again, Ovum said. But shares in BT, one of only a handful of European telecoms operators to own no mobile phone network of its own after demerging its mobile business in 2001, slipped 1.7 per cent to 219 pence in afternoon trade.

 Analysts said although the product looked interesting, the company had opted for a soft launch, so take-up would be slow before the service became more widely available in September. 

 BTs two price deals, called BT Fusion 100 and BT Fusion 200, offer 100 and 200 minutes of free calls to any network at any time respectively. cellphone groups such as Vodafone Group Plc, Orange and O2 Plc have price plans that cost ?30 per month for 200 minutes of free calls. BT said customers would get a free handset and a free wireless base station, or hub, that can support up to six different mobile phones, three of them simultaneously.

 However, BT Fusion customers will need to subscribe to a high-speed Internet connection from BT Broadband, which costs at least ?17.99 a month, and must have a BT telephone line, for which BT charges a monthly ?10.50 in rental.

 Small Internet telephone rival Vonage slammed BT for untransparent charges that depended on where the caller was, noted that incoming calls were charged at mobile rates and that the service was restricted to BT broadband and landline users.

 Although the concept of BT Fusion may sound appealing, we would urge consumers to gain a clear understanding of the service and its costs before signing up, Vonage UK managing director Kerry Ritz said.

 BTs head of mobility and convergence Steve Andrews said BT Fusion would initially focus on its 1.75 million BT Broadband customers.

 The former telecoms monopoly, which is targeting ?1 billion in annual revenues over five years from services that link mobile and fixed devices, is hoping Fusion will shore up revenues in the face of a rising threat from a fiercely competitive mobile market.

 However, Livingston conceded that BTs costs of winning customers would be higher than mobile operators, as BT is giving away the base station for free.

 Jolie in refugee vow to Pervez

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 6: Angelina Jolie today promised during a meeting with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf that she would continue to focus world attention on the needs of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

 ?I see my role in this regard and hope it will be furthered through United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR by my present visit (to Pakistan),? Jolie, who is the UNHCR goodwill ambassador, said.

 Musharraf, however, asked the UN to re-locate all Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan to their homeland.?Rather than the UN High Commission for Refugees maintaining refugee camps in Pakistan, along the border areas, these should be relocated within Afghanistan,? he said. 

 A recent census conducted jointly by the Pakistan government and the UNHCR revealed that over three million Afghan refugees are living in Pakistan, including those who fled after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and after the US-led assault in December 2001.

 Jolie, who is on her her second Pakistan visit, applauded Musharrafs role in building ?multi-dimensional relations with Afghanistan that provided a favourable environment for the refugees,? an official statement said.

 Dos and donts to bag trophy

 Sydney, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Psst! Want to win a Nobel Prize?

 Live long, dont smoke or drink too much alcohol, eat a balanced diet and take holidays, because it may take 50 years for your discovery to be recognised by the Nobel committee.

 Also dont tell too many people about your idea or it may be stolen, and write good English because your discovery needs to be a memorable story if its to be deemed worthy of a Nobel.

 So says Australian Nobel prize-winning scientist Peter Doherty in his new book The Beginners Guide to Winning the Nobel Prize. Doherty won the 1996 Nobel prize for physiology and medicine, along with Swiss colleague Rolf Zinkernagel, for discovering the nature of cellular immune defence.

 His book coincides with Australias latest Nobel success after scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren won for their 1982 discovery that a bacterium, rather than stress, caused stomach ulcers and inflammation.

 Dohertys autobiography is predominantly the tale of a scientists life but its final chapter ? How to Win a Nobel ? sets out his ideas about the dos and donts of a Nobel life. 

 There is no instruction manual or course that can guide you to a Nobel Prize and, numerically speaking, most of us have more chance of winning an Olympic gold medal.

 However, dont despair. Doherty does have suggestions on how budding scientists can give themselves a long shot at a Nobel.

 Accept nothing at face value and get in the habit of thinking unconventionally. Work hard, work smart and, with a bit of luck, serendipity will play its part.

 Australians Marshall and Warren are good examples of Dohertys advice that prospective Nobel winners need to be patient and long-lived. They won their prize for medicine more than 20 years after making their discovery. Good habits start early: eat and drink moderately, take vacations, dont smoke or over-use recreational drugs (alcohol included), take regular exercise, avoid extreme sports, and seek professional help for suicidal thoughts, Doherty says.

 Youll also need to be able to write about your discovery in an entertaining manner.

 Science is about telling good, readable, memorable stories. It isnt necessary to be a Shakespeare or a Michael Ondaatje, but anyone who wants to be recognised as a top scientist must be able to write clear, concise English, Doherty says.

 And finally, Doherty says: Have fun, behave like a winner.

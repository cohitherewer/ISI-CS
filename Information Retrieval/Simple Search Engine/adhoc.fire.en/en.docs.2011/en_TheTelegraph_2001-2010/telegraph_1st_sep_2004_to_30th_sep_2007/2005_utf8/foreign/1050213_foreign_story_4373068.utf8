 Castro long life

 Madrid, Feb. 12: Opponents of Fidel Castro?s regime who are still waiting for the Maximum Leader?s death are in for some bad news: his doctor has said he may live to the age of 120.

 Eugenio Selman-Housein, the senior doctor in charge of President Castro?s medical team, dismissed recent concerns for the 78-year-old Cuban leaders health. He said: ?Fidel fulfils all the necessary requirements in that he eats well and walks 4 km five days a week, even after the operation on his knee. He could perfectly well live until 120-years-old.

 Speaking at a seminar on the secret of Cuban centenarians? longevity, Dr Selman said to live a long life an individual must meet six basic conditions: motivation to live, appropriate diet, medical attention, intense physical activity, cultural activities and a healthy environment. 

 Chavez threat: Castro warned the US against plotting to kill his most important ally, Venezuela?s Leftist President Hugo Chavez. ?I say to world public opinion: if they assassinate Chavez, the responsibility will fall squarely on the President of the US, George W. Bush,? Castro said.

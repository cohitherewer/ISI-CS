 Star gossip bigger than films

 Angelina Jolie: Box office woes

 Los Angeles, June 27: This may turn out to be the summer when celebrities overshadowed their movies. 

 As the box office continued its slump into an 18th weekend, studio executives were left to ponder whether their films ? even those that performed respectably ? were taking a back seat to the public chatter about their stars. 

 Warner Brothers Batman Begins led the box office, taking in an estimated $26.8 million in its second weekend in theatres, for a total of $121.7 million in domestic ticket sales. Sonys Bewitched, the comedy starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, came in second with $20.2 million in its opening weekend, drawing a nearly 60 per cent female audience, most of which was 25 and over. 

 Mr. and Mrs. Smith, starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, distributed by 20th Century Fox and now in its third weekend, took in $16.7 million, while Disneys Herbie: Fully Loaded took in $12.7 million. 

 That overall box office performance, while solid, still lagged well behind last year, with 2005 revenues off by 7 per cent, according to Exhibitor Relations, which compiles statistics on ticket sales. 

 Hanging over many of these summer movies has been the public focus on the behaviour and personal lives of their leading actors. In the case of Herbie: Fully Loaded, Disney executives had debated whether the sexy, party-going tabloid image of its star, Lindsay Lohan, might discourage parents from letting their children see the film. 

 But it appeared that strong word of mouth buoyed the movie from a tepid opening on Wednesday to a solid estimated finish of $17.8 million for its first five days. 

 If there was hesitation, its been overcome by the numbers, said Chuck Viane, president of distribution for Disneys Buena Vista unit, who noted that attendance jumped an unusual 70 per cent from Thursday to Friday. Based on everything Im seeing, on exit scores and the growth of movie, its all positive.

 At Warner Brothers, executives had been privately miffed that the very public romance between Tom Cruise and the Batman Begins actor Katie Holmes was deflecting attention from the movie during its publicity tour. 

 Publicly, one executive was more circumspect. Asked about the possible effect of celebrity noise on Batman, Jeff Goldstein, Warners executive vice-president of domestic distribution, said: This movie stands on its own. I dont know that we need to take any cues from any other movies in the marketplace, or be concerned about other films.

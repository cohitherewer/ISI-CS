 Leonardo?s class on show 

 Rome, Jan. 11 (Reuters): More than half-a-millennium after Leonardo Da Vinci designed some of the world?s greatest inventions, an Italian exhibition has put the Renaissance master?s foresight on display.

 ?Leonardo Da Vinci: A Curious Genius? seeks to crack the code of Leonardo Da Vinci?s mind and show what enabled the Italian to design diving suits, a bicycle and a car centuries before people even had the tools or skills to make them.

 ?Leonardo was beyond time. He designed most of these things 500 years before they could even be built,? curator Carlo Barbieri said at the show opening in Rome?s Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei today. ?Just take a look and you can peek into the mind of one of the world?s most complex geniuses.?

 There is no copy of the Mona Lisa here or even The Last Supper. These are the gadgets of greatness taken from the Atlantic Codex, a 1,286 page collection of drawings and writings by the painter, sculptor, inventor and scientist.

 What makes this show unique is that models of Da Vinci?s designs appear alongside their modern incarnations. In many cases there is not a great amount of difference between them.

 Da Vinci?s automobile is believed to be history?s first self-propelled vehicle and was conceived and drawn about 1478, some 431 years before Henry Ford?s Model T rolled off the assembly line. The drawing sits next to the design of a modern Ferrari engine, considered by some to be the highest expression of automechanics in the 21st century.

 ?It is impossible to say how he managed to imagine these things, he was too great a mind to comprehend, but what you can see from the drawings is the process of his thought, filling every inch of paper with ideas,? Barbieri said. ?Even the bicycle, is almost exactly like our modern version. It has the spokes and the chains, the only thing missing is the means to change the wheel direction.?

 The exhibition also showcases Da Vincis handwriting, a style so unusual it led some to call him a wizard or mystic, an idea exploited in numerous books including Dan Brown?s best selling thriller The Da Vinci Code. Da Vinci?s script runs from right to left and the characters are inverted, like reading text in a mirror. ?He was left-handed, which is part of the reason for his style of writing. But I think he largely chose to write this way to create a sense of mystery,? Barbieri said.

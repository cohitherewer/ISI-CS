 Iran love fund for the poor

 Tehran, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Iran is to create a $1.3 billion love fund to encourage poor young people to marry, the countrys vice-president said today.

 Iranian youngsters often complain they cannot afford to get married because of Irans economic woes and are living with their parents longer than ever before.

 The love fund is a realisation of the new governments slogan ? taking oil money to the tables of the people, state television quoted vice-president Farhad Rahbar as saying.

 The governments share in the $1.3 billion for the Reza Love Fund will be deducted from the oil income of the National Iranian Oil Company, Rahbar said, without elaborating on how the money would be used to help young couples.

 Each province would have a board of trustees to determine how much money needy couples should get.

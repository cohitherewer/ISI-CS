 Pak not to extradite Khan

 Islamabad, Aug. 28 (PTI): Asking the US to treat it as an ally and not as a target, Pakistan has said it cannot go beyond what it has already done to help the probe into A.Q. Khans nuclear proliferation network and ruled out extradition of the disgraced scientist.

 The United States should realise that Pakistan has extended maximum possible cooperation to the international effort to dismantle the Khan network of nuclear proliferators and cannot go beyond what it has already done, Pakistans ambassador to the US Jehangir Karamat said.

 They should know that we cannot extradite Dr A.Q. Khan. They should not even talk about it, he was quoted as saying at a Washington policy analysis group meeting by the media here today.

 Karamat described US-Pak relations as very good but said the US would have to decide whether it considered pakistan an ally or not. 

 If we are an ally country we should be treated as an ally and not a target, he said.

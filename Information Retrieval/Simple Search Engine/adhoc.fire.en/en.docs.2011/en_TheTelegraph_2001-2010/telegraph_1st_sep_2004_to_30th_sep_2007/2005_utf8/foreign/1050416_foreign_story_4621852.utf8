 Bush not sex-rated

 Los Angeles, April 15 (Reuters): He may be leader of the free world and Time magazine?s ?Person of the Year,? but a new international survey of women makes certain that President George W. Bush is far from being the sexiest man alive.

 In a recent online poll conducted by Esquire magazine, 11,000 women in 15 countries were asked to rate Bush?s sex appeal on a scale of one to 10, and America?s commander-in-chief failed to register much more than a two. 

 Women in Australia, Germany and the Netherlands were the harshest judges of George W.?s sexual allure, giving him an average rating of 1.4 each, Esquire said in its survey released earlier this week.

 By contrast, Indonesian women were the most generous, giving Bush an average score of 2.2; American women found their President slightly less appealing, rating him a 2.1. Other countries contributing to the survey included Austria, Brazil, Britain, Israel, Italy, the Philippines, Russia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

 Bush has fared far better in other recent magazine rankings, having been named Time?s ?Person of the Year? in December and making that magazine?s list of the world?s 100 most influential people this week. But Esquire?s ?Global Survey of the Female Species? was not confined to questions about Bush.

 Eighty-three per cent of Italian women said they preferred sex to cuddling, for instance. And while American women said it takes an average of 5.5 dates with a man before having sex with him, Swedish women said they would sleep with a man after 4 dates, the survey showed.

 E-mail phobia

 Bush said today he does not send e-mail, not even to his twin daughters, because he fears ?my personal stuff? would be made public.

 ?There has got to be a certain sense of privacy,? he told the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Bush volunteered his aversion to e-mail during a discussion on whether his administration is sufficiently responsive to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act.

 Advocates of greater openness in government charge the Bush administration has used the need to guard homeland security as an excuse to keep more information secret.

 Bush has pressured Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow for greater freedom of the press in Russia. ?We got to make sure our own press is free. I know that,? he said. But when it comes to e-mail, Bush said he avoids it because ?everything is investigated in Washington? and as a result ?we?re losing a lot of history.?

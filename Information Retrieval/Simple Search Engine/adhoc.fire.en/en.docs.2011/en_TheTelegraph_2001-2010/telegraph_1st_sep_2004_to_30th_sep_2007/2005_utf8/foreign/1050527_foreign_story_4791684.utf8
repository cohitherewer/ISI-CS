 Indo-Pak truce trips at UN

 K.P. NAYAR

 New York, May 27: Even as Indian and Pakistani officials are discussing peace in Siachen and their top leaders are exchanging greetings instead of invectives, war has broken out between the two countries here at the UN.

 So far, in the 10 days after India and three other countries circulated a draft resolution on Security Council expansion, every day India has gained diplomatic territory, inch-by-inch, in bitterly-fought battles between Nirupam Sen, Indias permanent representative to the UN and his formidable adversary, Pakistans ambassador Munir Akram.

 A meeting between Sen and his Russian counterpart, Andrey Denisov, following the circulation of the draft, resulted in a paragraph expressing Russias unequivocal support for Indias claim for a permanent seat being included today in a joint statement at the end of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams visit to Moscow.

 Assessing India as an important member of the international community, the Russian Federation reaffirmed its support to India as a deserving and strong candidate for the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, the joint statement said.

 Unlike Britain and France, which supported the draft resolution by India, Japan, Germany and France at a meeting on May 16 at the German mission to the UN, Russia was seen here as wavering.

 The next day, Sen, a Kremlinologist of 1972 vintage, met Denisov along with the permanent representatives of Germany, Japan and Brazil.

 The most bruising battle between Sen and Akram so far has been this week at a meeting called by UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.

 At that meeting, Sen challenged Akram to move a resolution in the General Assembly opposing expansion of permanent membership of the Security Council if the Coffee Club had enough support at the UN for its opposition.

 The Coffee Club, officially called Uniting for Consensus has Argentina, Canada, Italy, Mexico, Pakistan, South Korea and Spain as its leading lights.

 Diplomats at the UN estimate that these countries, which want the Security Council to be expanded to 25 members, with no new permanent members, have the support, so far, of no more than 20 countries.

 Naturally, Akram backed off from the challenge by Sen, which was primarily aimed at impressing Annan that the G-4, as India, Japan, Germany and Brazil are known, were confident of a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly for their draft resolution, which is to be put to vote in mid-June.

 Annan has just begun a series of consultations here to find a successful way out of the conflicting claims related to reforming the Security Council.

 Instead, Akram said Pakistan and its supporters will bring out a working paper outlining their proposal for creating 10 new non-permanent seats in the Security Council.

 The paper will call for immediate election of all 20 non-permanent seats as part of reforming the Security Council.

 Akram told Annan that there should be broadest possible agreement on the modalities of Security Council reform and Sen retorted that the G-4 was precisely trying for that objective.

 But he told Annan that agreement could not mean complete agreement between G-4 and the Coffee Club. Akram said the balance of power in the Security Council could not be altered unless any new permanent members had veto power.

 Sen once again retorted that the G-4 draft resolution was calling for the same powers enjoyed by existing permanent members for that reason alone.

 Last week, Akram and other Coffee Club ambassadors met Annan and complained that India and the other G-4 envoys were misusing the secretary-generals name to promote their draft resolution.

 Annan has said that a consensus on Security Council reform is desirable, but that reform should not become hostage to the absence of such a consensus.

 Annan diplomatically called his effort to make peace between G-4 and Coffee Club as healthy discussion. After the meeting, Akram has been lobbying to put off the mid-June vote on the G-4 on the plea that we support agreement for continuing consensus and dialogue with view to reaching agreement.

 But Germanys ambassador Gunter Pleuger said his country and the other G-4 members were prepared to wait no more than few weeks for a vote because this is the only chance after 12 years of discussion on the issue.

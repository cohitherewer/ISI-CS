 Fine Print

 Material trouble

 Jerusalem, Oct. 9 (Reuters): Word that Madonnas upcoming album includes a paean to a 16th-century Jewish mystic has prompted the rabbis who guard his legacy to accuse the pop idol of sacrilege and hint at divine punishment.

 The Confessions on a Dance Floor collection includes a song titled Isaac ? in reference, entertainment media say, to Rabbi Isaac Luria, founder of the Kabbalah school of mysticism which counts Madonna, 47, as one of its devotees.

 The custodians of Lurias tomb in the Israeli town of Safed accused her of breaking a taboo. There is a prohibition in Jewish law against using the holy name of our master, the Sage Isaac, for profit, the seminarys director, Rabbi Rafael Cohen, told the Israeli newspaper Maariv today.

 Puff show

 Ottawa (Reuters): Gruesome Canadian images 

 of tobacco-damaged gums, lungs and hearts will form part 

 of an exhibit at New Yorks Museum of Modern Art, Canadas 

 health ministry said. The graphic images appear as health 

 warnings on Canadian cigarette packs, and they will be part 

 of an exhibition on objects designed to protect the mind 

 and body from dangerous or stressful influences.

 JLo border

 and actor Jennifer Lopez has put aside her usual glamour 

 and is filming in a hilltop shantytown for a gritty movie 

 about murders of hundreds of women on the US-Mexico border.

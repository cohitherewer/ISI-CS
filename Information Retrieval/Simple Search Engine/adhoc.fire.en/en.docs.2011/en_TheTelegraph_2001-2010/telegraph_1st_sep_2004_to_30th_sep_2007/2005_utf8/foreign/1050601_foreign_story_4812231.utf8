 HK scribe accused of spying in China

 Ching Cheong

 Beijing, May 31 (Reuters): China accused a Hong Kong-based reporter for Singapores Straits Times newspaper of spying for foreign agencies today, but his wife said it was a set-up.

 If charged and convicted, Ching Cheong, 55, could face the death penalty. He was detained by agents of the state security apparatus in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on April 22.

 Ching admitted that in recent years he engaged in intelligence-gathering activities on the mainland on instructions from foreign intelligence agencies and accepted huge amounts of spying fees, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

 Like many Hong Kong people, Ching holds a passport of the special administrative region as well as a British National (Overseas) passport issued in the waning days of British colonial rule. He also holds permanent resident status in Singapore.

 The Straits Times publisher, Singapore Press Holdings Ltd, which is indirectly linked to the Singapore government, said it was shocked by the accusation.

 As we have stated in our press statements, we have no cause to doubt that in all the years that Ching Cheong has worked with us, he has conducted himself with the utmost professionalism, it said.

 Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan hinted that Chings detention would not hurt Chinas ties with Singapore, which were strained last year when prime minister-designate Lee Hsien Loong visited Chinas rival Taiwan.

 17 Hindus killed in Pak tribal crossfire

 Quetta, March 21 (AP): Seventeen minority Hindus were killed when their temple was hit by rockets during fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces in a restive tribal town in southwestern Pakistan last week, a government official said today.

 The fighting in the town of Dera Bugti erupted last Thursday after the tribesmen allegedly attacked a convoy of pick-up trucks carrying paramilitary troops along a mountain road.

 Officials have said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen, who dominate Dera Bugti.

 It was an alarming escalation of a low-level rebellion in Baluchistan, the country?s poorest province, where tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army?s moves to set up garrisons in the region.

 Abdul Samad Lasi, the top government administrator in the area, said today that several homes of Hindus near the temple in Dera Bugti also were damaged by rockets in the fighting. ?This is true that some 17 Hindus were killed and their temple was damaged,? Lasi said.

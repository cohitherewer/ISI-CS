 US rejects direct N. Korea talks

 Washington, Feb. 11 (Reuters): The US today rejected North Korea?s demands for direct talks over its nuclear weapons programme and insisted on six-party negotiations.

 ?There?s plenty of opportunities for North Korea to speak directly with us in the context of the six-party talks,? said White House spokesman Scott McClellan.

 North Korea said for the first time yesterday that it possessed nuclear weapons and a North Korean diplomat at the UN in New York said: ?If the US wants to talk to us directly, it can be seen as a sign of a change in the US hostile policy toward North Korea.?

 McClellan insisted President George W. Bush will stick to the negotiating format in which the US, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia negotiate with North Korea. The six parties have held three rounds of talks since August 2003 and the process has stalled.

 ?All of North Korea?s neighbours in the region recognise that this is a regional problem and it requires a multilateral approach for resolving it,? McClellan said. ?We believe the six-party talks, like North Korea?s neighbours, are the way to resolve the situation.?

 He said that as secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said yesterday: ?North Korea should have no reason to believe that any nation wants to attack them, that there?s a proposal on the table that provides the way forward for North Korea to eliminate its nuclear programme.?

 China, South Korea and Germany joined the US and elsewhere for Pyongyang to return to the table. In the firing line is South Korea, under constant threat from a neighbour that keeps 70 per cent of its 1.2-million-strong army along a border that passes just 65 km north of the capital, Seoul.

 South Korean officials said talks were the only solution to end the norths isolation.

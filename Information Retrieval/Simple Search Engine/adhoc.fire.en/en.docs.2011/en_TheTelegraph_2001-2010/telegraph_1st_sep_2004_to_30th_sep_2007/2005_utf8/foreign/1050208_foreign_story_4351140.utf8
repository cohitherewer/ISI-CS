 ?Retirement Pope?s decision?

 Vatican City, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Only Pope John Paul can decide if it would be good for the church for him to retire and not reign for life, his secretary of state said today.

 ?Let?s leave that up to the conscience of the Pope,? Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Pope?s top aide, said, when asked if the Pontiff had considered stepping down. The frail, 84-year-old Pope was rushed to hospital with breathing problems last week, once again reviving debate on what the church would do if he became permanently incapacitated.

 Most Roman Catholic leaders believe the Pope will stay in office until he dies, but Sodano?s comments hinted that the Pontiff could yet retire. 

 ?If there is a man of the church who is guided by the Holy Spirit, if there is a man who loves the church more than anyone else, if there is a man who is possessed with marvellous wisdom, it is the Pope,? Sodano said.

 Church law says a Pope can resign, but it is a highly rare event. The last Pope to resign willingly was Celestine V, who stepped down in 1294. 

 Gregory XII reluctantly abdicated in 1415 when more than one Pope was reigning at the same time.

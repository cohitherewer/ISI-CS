 Europe kinder, US faster

 Brussels, Jan. 16 (Reuters): As Europeans dug deep into their pockets to help victims of Asia?s tsunami they could only watch as the rescue dash of US aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln stole the headlines.

 The role played by thousands of US troops in the tsunami relief effort has not only been a boon to the US image in the world, but also exposed Europe?s inability to act quickly in a crisis.

 ?The real question is: could Europe come together and do likewise on the ground at a distant locale?? said Bill Frist, the top Republican in the US Senate, during a visit to Brussels last week. ?I think the answer to that would be no,? said Frist, just returned from Sri Lanka where he observed the aid mission.

 In a show of generosity matched by none, European Union states have come up with a huge $2 billion of aid, not counting donations from private citizens and debt-easing pacts with countries hit by the December 26 tidal wave.

 But in the critical few days after the disaster, money alone could not help the needy in areas such as Indonesia?s Aceh province, cut off from the outside world by the devastation wreaked on its roads and communications infrastructure.

 It was only the January 1 arrival of US Sea Hawk helicopters from the Abraham Lincoln which began releasing the aid uselessly piling up in the airport of regional capital Banda Aceh.

 Keen to show America?s best side to Muslims angered by its West Asia policies, Washington added further air and sea power and boosted troop numbers to over 16,000 ? dwarfing in size the French, British and other EU contingents.

 It was of course convenient that the Abraham Lincoln was on hand after a port visit to Hong Kong. But few believe Europe could under any circumstances have mounted such a big operation so quickly.

 ?We simply haven?t got the kit,? said defence analyst Daniel Keohane at the London-based Centre for European Reform (CER).

 No one suggests Europe should have an aircraft carrier patrolling the Indian Ocean. But Keohane said the tsunami showed Europe lacks sufficient airlift to carry lots of troops and equipment quickly over large distances.

 While the US has over 200 strategic lift aircraft for despatching troops, kit and supplies, only Britain among the Europeans has such a capability with four leased Boeing C-17s.

 Mid-air refuelling ? vital to covering long distances quickly ? is also identified as another shortfall.

 ?We never claimed we could act as rapidly as the Americans,? said Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for EU policy chief Javier Solana. ?It takes time to develop the structures of the ESDP,? she said of the European Security and Defence Policy, which EU leaders agreed in 1999 should give Europe the military wherewithal to react to international crises autonomously.

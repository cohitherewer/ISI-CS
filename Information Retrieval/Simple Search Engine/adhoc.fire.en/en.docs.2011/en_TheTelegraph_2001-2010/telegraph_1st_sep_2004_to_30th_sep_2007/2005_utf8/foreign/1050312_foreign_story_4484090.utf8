 Fry goes rural

 London, March 11 (Reuters): Actor Stephen Fry has won a celebrity poll to star in a special edition of British radio show The Archers.

 ?Oh Lordy, Lordy. It sounds like it?s Christmas, I couldn?t be more thrilled,? Fry told BBC radio today after beating off competition from celebrities Liza Tarbuck, Ewan McGregor and Sir Ian McKellen.

 Comedienne Victoria Wood, a devoted fan of the rural farming saga, has written a series of short episodes for the radio soap with Fry, 47, set to appear in today?s show as part of the BBC?s annual Comic Relief charity appeal.

 ?I will be more nervous than I?ve probably been about anything,? added Fry. ?As a child, as a barely divided embryo, I remember sitting at my mother?s knee listening to the Archers? music. It?s just stitched into the fabric of my being.?

 Hailed as the world?s longest-running soap opera, The Archers was originally devised in 1951 as an educational drama about farming.

 IKEA vow

 Oslo (Reuters): Swedish home furnishings 

 giant IKEA promised on Thursday to depict more women in 

 its instruction manuals after Norway?s Prime Minister accused 

 it of showing only men assembling furniture. ?IKEA will 

 now review its instructions leaflets to get a more even 

 balance between men and women,? IKEA said in a statement.

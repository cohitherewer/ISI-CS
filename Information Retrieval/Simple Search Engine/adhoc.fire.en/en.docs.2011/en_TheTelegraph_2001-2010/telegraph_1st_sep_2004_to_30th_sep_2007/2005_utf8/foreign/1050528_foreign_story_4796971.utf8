 French set to reject EU treaty in vote

 Paris, May 27 (Reuters): France headed towards a looming electoral earthquake today as polls showed voters were set to reject the EUs constitution in a referendum and open the door to a period of political uncertainty.

 President Jacques Chiracs televised appeal to voters last evening not to use the vote on Sunday to punish his unpopular government left most commentators cold and his hint he would be changing Prime Ministers was met with derision.

 Treaty supporters say rejection would kill the constitution and weaken France within Europe while opponents say a No vote would force the union to redraft the treaty to boost protection for social services and workers threatened by globalisation.

 The charters backers still hoped for a ballot box surprise, but the steady rise of the No vote in recent opinion polls to 55 per cent seemed to make Sundays result a foregone conclusion. First estimates of the vote will come after polling stations close in big cities at 2000 GMT.

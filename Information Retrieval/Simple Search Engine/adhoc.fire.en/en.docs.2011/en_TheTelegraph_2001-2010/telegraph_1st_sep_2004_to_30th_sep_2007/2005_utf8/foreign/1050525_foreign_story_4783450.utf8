 Pak Islamic law review

 Islamabad, May 24 (Reuters): A government-appointed panel plans to review strict Islamic laws in Pakistan which rights activists say discriminate against women.

 The Islamic Hudood Ordinances were passed in 1979 under the military rule of General Zia-ul-Haq.

 One of their most controversial provisions is that a woman must have four male witnesses to prove rape, or face a charge of adultery herself. 

 Men and women found guilty of adultery also face stoning to death or 100 lashes, although such punishments have never been executed after being handed down by a court.

 The Islamic Ideology Council, a government body made up of clerics and lawyers charged with ensuring that laws confirm with Islam, has decided to review the controversial legislation.

 Its chairman, Mohammad Khalid Masood, said the council would consult scholars from Muslim countries attending a conference on Islamic criminal law this month in Islamabad.

 We have the power to review laws in the country. We have reviewed many other laws and we plan to look into these laws as well, he said.

 He said the council would make recommendations to the government but any change in legislation would be a matter for parliament.

 President Pervez Musharraf, who espouses a moderate and modern Muslim state, has long called for a review of Islamic laws but has faced stiff opposition from powerful religious groups.

 Secular political parties, civil rights and womens groups say the numbers of rapes and violence against women have soared since the laws were passed. 

 Womens groups say many rapes go unreported, partly because of the difficulty of proving the crime under the Hudood laws.

 The government has moved to reduce violence against women by toughening up laws against so-called honour killings and prescribing the death penalty for such crimes.

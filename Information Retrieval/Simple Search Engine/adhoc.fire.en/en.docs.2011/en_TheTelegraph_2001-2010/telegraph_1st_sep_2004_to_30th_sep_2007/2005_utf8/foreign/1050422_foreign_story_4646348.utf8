 Russia, US in Belarus clash 

 Vilnius (Lithuania), April 21 (Reuters): Russia and the US clashed on Belarus today as Moscow?s foreign minister rebuffed a call by the US secretary of state for change in what she branded central Europe?s ?last true dictatorship.?

 ?We would not of course advocate what some people call ?regime change? anywhere,? Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting between Nato and Russia in the Lithuanian capital. 

 He was responding to remarks by US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice yesterday that Lukashenko ran ?the last true dictatorship in the centre of Europe,? and that ?it?s time for change to come to Belarus.?

 Rice retaliated by meeting Belarussian Opposition leaders in a show of support for pro-democracy groups in the ex-Soviet state despite Russian concerns that the US was interfering in its traditional sphere of influence.

 ?While it may seem difficult and long, at times even far away, there will be a road to democracy in Belarus,? she told them.

 The Opposition leaders, among them the wife of a journalist who ?disappeared? and the head of a university that has been shut down, told a Vilnius news conference they wanted to hold mass street protests and would boycott elections they believed Lukashenko would rig.

 Rice said yesterday there was nothing wrong with Washington supporting pro-democracy groups ? as it did last year during Ukraine?s ?Orange revolution? ? if it led to Belarussians throwing off the ?yoke of tyranny.?

 EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana agreed with Rice?s call for change.

 Florida weather, fine sensor fuel Discovery blast-off

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), July 26 (Reuters): Nasa successfully launched space shuttle Discovery today after a two-and-a-half-year struggle to rebuild the shuttle programme following the fatal Columbia disaster.

 I want to ask you all to take note of what you saw here today, said Nasas new administrator Michael Griffin, basking in a palpable sense of relief that swept through the launch management team after Discovery safely reached orbit.

 The shuttles launch was delayed for two weeks while engineers searched for the cause of an elusive problem with one of the ships hydrogen fuel-level sensors.

 The sensor glitch cancelled Discoverys first launch attempt on July 13 and briefly overshadowed the fear of falling debris that had preoccupied Nasas engineers for more than two years.

 During todays countdown, however, all the sensors worked perfectly. Even Floridas normally fickle summer weather cooperated and Discovery blasted off smoothly.

 Discoverys main mission on the 12-day space flight under veteran astronaut Eileen Collins is to test new safety measures and heat shield repair techniques introduced since Columbia disintegrated over Texas on February 1, 2003.

 Columbias wing had been damaged by falling foam insulation on liftoff, and superheated atmospheric gases tore into the breach when the shuttle came back to land 16 days later. Seven astronauts died.

 Nasa has spent more than $1 billion on safety upgrades since then.

 We know that the folks back on the planet Earth are just feeling great right now and our thanks to everybody for all the super work thats been done over the past two-and-a-half years to get us flying again, Collins told mission control in Houston just short of three hours after the picture-perfect launch.

 Discoverys other main mission is to deliver several tons of supplies and equipment to the International Space Station, whose construction has been on hold since the remaining three-shuttle fleet was grounded in the aftermath of Columbia.

 Crowds of onlookers, including First Lady Laura Bush and President George W. Bushs brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, held their breath during the critical first two minutes of flight, then cheered when launch commentators announced the shuttle had safely separated from boosters.

 The launch was scrutinised by 112 cameras, and an array of radars, sensors and other imaging equipment so that Nasa can assess how well the newly modified external fuel tank worked. The cameras captured something falling off as the shuttle climbed, but Nasa managers said it would be a while before they could determine whether it was significant or not.

 The shuttle, carrying Collins, pilot Jim Kelly, Japans Soichi Noguchi and astronauts Charles Camarda, Steve Robinson, Andy Thomas and Wendy Lawrence, was scheduled to reach the orbital outpost on Thursday for a week-long stay.

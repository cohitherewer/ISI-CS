 Farrell gets sex-tape reprieve

 Colin Farrell

 Los Angeles, Aug. 12 (AP): A judge has extended a temporary restraining order barring an ex-girlfriend of Colin Farrell from marketing a tape of them having sex.

 Farrells lawsuit against Playboy Playmate Nicole Narain says they made the videotape two-and-a-half years ago with the understanding that it would never be made public.

 Last month, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe blocked Narain from selling, distributing or displaying the 15-minute tape. On Wednesday, Yaffe extended the order.

 The lawsuit by Farrell, 29, accused the 31-year-old woman of working with the owner of an Internet pornography business and contacting the news media about the tape. 

 Leodis Matthews, a lawyer for Narain, said her client had not attempted to profit from the tape, but wanted to keep her half of the rights to the video.

 Farrells lawsuit said the release of the tape would irreparably harm him and his career.

 The actors screen credits include Alexander, S.W.A.T., Daredevil and The Recruit.

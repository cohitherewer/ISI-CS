 US warning 

 Beijing, Sept. 16 (Reuters): The US threatened to freeze North Korean assets if the reclusive state did not toe the line in talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons programme, but a new proposal from China raised hopes for progress.

 The six-party talks in Beijing looked in jeopardy today ? their fourth day ? as Pyongyang hung tough, rejecting a South Korean offer of electricity in return for renouncing nuclear arms and insisting on its right to nuclear energy. But China, hosting the negotiations, put forward a revised draft statement which was thought to acknowledge North Koreas right in principle to an atomic energy programme. US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice warned that the US was not solely dependent on the talks to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions.

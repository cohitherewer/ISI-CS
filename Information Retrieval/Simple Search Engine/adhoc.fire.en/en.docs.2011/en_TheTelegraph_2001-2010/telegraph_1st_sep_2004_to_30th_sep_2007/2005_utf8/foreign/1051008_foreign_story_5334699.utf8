 Red card for author

 London, Oct. 7 (Reuters): A top-selling British childrens author has been thrown out of school for swearing in a talk to 12- and 13-year-olds.

 Reverend Graham Taylor, who wrote the novel Shadowmancer, which centres on witchcraft and battling evil, said teachers got upset because he used the words crap, poo, fart and bogey at Penair School in Truro in southwest England. I think that my language was appropriate, he said. Language changes and words that once were deemed unacceptable are now part of our culture.

 The school said in a statement that teachers had asked Taylor to leave after the children became excitable on hearing him.

 Shadowmancer topped British book charts for 15 weeks and the film rights have been sold for ?2.25 million.

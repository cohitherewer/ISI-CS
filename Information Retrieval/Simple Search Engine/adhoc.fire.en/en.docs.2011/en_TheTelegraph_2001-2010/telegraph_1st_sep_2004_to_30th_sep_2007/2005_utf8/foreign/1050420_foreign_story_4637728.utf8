 Schroeder praises Ratzinger election

 Berlin, April 19 (Reuters): German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder described German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as a worthy successor to John Paul II, saying his election to lead the Roman Catholic church was a great honour for Germany.

 ?That the new Pope Benedict XVI comes from Germany, that is a great honour for our whole country,? Schroeder said in a brief news conference.

 ?In Pope Benedict XVI, a pope has been chosen who knows the world church like no one else. He is a great, world-renowned theologian. Pope Benedict XVI is a worthy successor to Pope John Paul II.? Schroeder added that he looked forward to welcoming him to a Catholic youth rally to be held in Cologne.

 Israel voiced hope today that as a German, Pope Benedict XVI would be especially committed to fighting anti-Semitism, and a prominent Israeli rabbi described him as a friend of the Jewish people.

 A government statement quoted foreign minister Silvan Shalom as welcoming the election of Joseph Ratzinger as the new leader of the world?s Roman Catholics.

 ?The foreign minister expresses his hope that this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism,? the statement said. 

 In Mumbai, Dolphy D?Souza of the All India Catholic Union said: ?It?s not a question of whether we are happy or sad, it?s ultimately the will of God that has led to Cardinal Ratzinger?s election.?

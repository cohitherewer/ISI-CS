 Smoking, cancer link scientist dies

 London, July 25 (Reuters): Sir Richard Doll, the British scientist whose research first established the link between smoking and lung cancer, has died aged 92.

 Oxford University said Doll, who gave up smoking after his groundbreaking work in the late 1940s, died yesterday in hospital after a short illness. 

 His pioneering epidemiological work has led to the dramatic reduction in smoking rates in Britain over the past 50 years, John Hood, the universitys vice-chancellor, said. 

 One of the worlds most renowned epidemiologists, Doll warned in a 1950 study, co-written with Sir Austin Bradford Hill, that smoking was a major cause of lung cancer. 

 Their early results showed that smokers were much more likely to die of lung cancer than non-smokers.

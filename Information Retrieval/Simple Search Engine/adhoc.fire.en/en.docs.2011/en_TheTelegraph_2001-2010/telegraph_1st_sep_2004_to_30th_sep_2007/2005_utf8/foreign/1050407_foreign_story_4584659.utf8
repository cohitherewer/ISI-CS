 Windsor scare

 London, April 6 (Reuters): Two tourists managed to avoid security and reach a private area of Windsor Castle just days before heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles has his wedding reception at the royal residence, police said today.

 The men were held in the grounds of the castle, 32 km west of London, after climbing a perimeter fence on Sunday night. ?The two men had entered the private area of the Windsor Castle estate and were immediately detected,? a police spokesperson said.

 The Sun newspaper said they reached the area of the castle where Queen Elizabeth?s private quarters are located, but the spokesperson said the secure area used by the royal family had not been breached ?at any stage?.

 The tourists were quizzed before being released without arrest, she added, giving no further details.

 The incident came less than a week before a royal wedding that Britain?s most senior police officer has warned poses an obvious potential terrorist target. Prince Charles will marry his long-term lover Camilla Parker Bowles at a civil ceremony at the Guildhall in Windsor on Saturday.

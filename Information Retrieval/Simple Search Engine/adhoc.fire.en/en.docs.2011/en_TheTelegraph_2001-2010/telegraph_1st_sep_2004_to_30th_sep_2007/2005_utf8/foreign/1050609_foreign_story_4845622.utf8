 Court rejects Nepal order 

 Kathmandu, June 8 (PTI): Nepals Supreme Court yesterday overturned a royal government order to close a communication centre which was supplying programmes to several radio stations in the country.

 The ministry for information and communications directive asking the Communication Corner to stop operations was illegal, the court said yesterday.

 The Communication Corner had been catering to the needs of over a dozen FM and community radios prior to King Gyanendras seizure of power on February 1.

 However, after the government banned FM radios from broadcasting news-related programmes, the Communications Corner had limited itself to entertainment and health related issues.

 The communications firm had petitioned the court to reverse the order, which was served on it on May 27 as part of the media crackdown. Suresh Acharya, news coordinator at the communications firm, said the court yesterday asked the government to immediately withdraw its order. 

 Scribes detained

 Dozens of journalists were detained today in Kathmandu as they prepared to defy a ban on protests and hold a demonstration for restoration of press freedom in Nepal.

 Fifty-three journalists were dragged into vans and driven to a police club where they are detained, Dipak Rijal, a local journalist, said, after the demonstrators were detained.

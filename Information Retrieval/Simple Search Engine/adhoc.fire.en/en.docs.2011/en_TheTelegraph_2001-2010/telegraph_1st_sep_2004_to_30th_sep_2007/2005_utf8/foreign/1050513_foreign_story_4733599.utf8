 Urban crime uniform faces ban

 London, May 12 (Reuters): Britains largest shopping centre said today it was banning youths wearing the urban crime uniform of baseball caps and hooded tops, a move supported by deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.

 The Bluewater centre in Kent, southeast England, said it had published a code of conduct for visitors to the 330 store complex that outlined its zero-tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour. Police said they had been called to Bluewater 23 times in the past eight months to deal with rowdy and nuisance behaviour.

 The code bans groups of more than five who do not intend to shop and prohibits caps and hooded tops which could prevent identification.

 Crime and anti-social behaviour was a key issue in Britains election. Blair said today a key part of his new governments programme would be tackling anti-social behaviour. 

 His deputy, Prescott said he welcomed the ban, adding that he had himself been the victim of intimidation by youths wearing hooded tops at a motorway service station last year.

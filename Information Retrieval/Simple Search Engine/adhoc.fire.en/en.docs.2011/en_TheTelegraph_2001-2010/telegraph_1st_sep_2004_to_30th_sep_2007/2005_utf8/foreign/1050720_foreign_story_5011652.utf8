 24 held in Pak militant swoop

 Islamabad, July 19 (Reuters): Pakistan launched a major sweep against Islamist militants today, detaining over two dozen suspects in a series of raids linked to investigations into the July 7 bomb attacks in London, officials said today.

 The latest detentions were made in an overnight crackdown in the most populous province, Punjab, and included members of outlawed Islamist movements. 

 They are being questioned for links with any of the bombers, an official of Punjabs provincial government said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

 He said security agencies had detained 25 suspects in the cities of Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Faisalabad and Khushab.

 In the southwestern city of Quetta, police rounded up nearly two dozen activists of militant groups but officials said those detentions were not linked to the London bombings. A senior police official in Peshawar said he expected a crackdown to begin soon in North West Frontier Province.

 Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf ordered police to act against militant groups and hate literature in the days after Pakistani links to the London bombs were uncovered last week. A senior security official in Punjab said he expected that questioning of a handful of other suspects detained in recent days in Lahore would confirm ties to the London bombers. We suspect two or three of the detained (from Lahore) had links with the bombers. We are interrogating them intensively. We hope we will come out with some positive outcome shortly, he said.

 The death toll from the London underground train and bus bombings stood at 56 today. Three of the four bombers were young British Muslims of Pakistani descent, and officials say all of them entered Pakistan through Karachi last year. The fourth attacker was a Jamaican-born Briton.

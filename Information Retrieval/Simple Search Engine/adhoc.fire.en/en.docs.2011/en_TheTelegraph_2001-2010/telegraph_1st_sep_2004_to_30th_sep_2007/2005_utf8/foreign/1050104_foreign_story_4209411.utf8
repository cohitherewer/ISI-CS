 ?7000 good, 100 Best

 London, Jan. 3 (AFP): A British man celebrated his 100th birthday more than ?7,000 the richer on after placing a bet 10 years ago ? on his own long life expectancy.

 Arthur Best bet he would reach the age of 100, which he did yesterday, and as well as his special congratulatory telegram from Queen Elizabeth he had his winnings on the 66:1 wager to enjoy.

 His secret? Well, according to his son Edward: ?He gave up smoking years ago. Has a drop of Scotch each night but he is not a great drinker.? A birthday party was thrown in his honour in the town of Shrewsbury in eastern England.

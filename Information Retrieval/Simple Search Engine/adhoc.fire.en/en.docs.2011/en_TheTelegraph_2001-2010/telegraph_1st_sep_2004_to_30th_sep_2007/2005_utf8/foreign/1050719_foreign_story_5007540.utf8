 Rats! HK infested

 Hong Kong, July 18 (Reuters): Hong Kongs central business district, famous for gleaming skyscrapers and fashionable bars, is facing an invasion of rats.

 Between January and June, the densely populated areas rodent infestation rate swelled to 17 per cent from zero, based on the number of rats attracted to every 100 pieces of bait.

 Central was virtually rat-free a few months ago, then the situation deteriorated. We have to tackle the problem actively. What is important is sustained action, said Ho Yuk-yin, a consultant with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

 He attributed the influx to poor vigilance at restaurants in the areas old, run-down and poorly-maintained buildings and maze of dank alleyways. The government officers are distributing pamphlets to educate restaurant workers about hygiene, food storage, rubbish disposal and rat prevention.

 Panda run

 Beijing (Reuters): A wild giant panda which wandered into a southwestern Chinese city on the weekend led would-be rescuers on a day-long chase before it was captured and returned to the wild, the China Daily reported on Monday. The animal was first spotted early Saturday morning in Dujiangyuan, a city in Sichuan province, and was pursued by residents of a housing complex who initially thought it was a cat burglar, it said. The panda managed to escape by climbing over roofs and disappearing through an iron gate into darkness. Several hours later, police received reports that the panda had been sighted in a river, the newspaper said. Police observed the swimming panda until it stopped to climb a tree on the riverbank, where it stayed until daybreak. Around 10 am, with the help of a tranquiliser dart and rope, firemen were able to lift the panda from the tree so it could be returned home, the China Daily said.

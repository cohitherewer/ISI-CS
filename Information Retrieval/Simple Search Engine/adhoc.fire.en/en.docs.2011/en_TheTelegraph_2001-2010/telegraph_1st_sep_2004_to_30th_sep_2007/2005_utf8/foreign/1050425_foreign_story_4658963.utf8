 Fine Print

 Bashed by Bono

 Ottawa, April 24 (Reuters): Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, fighting to save his government, took a hit from another corner on Saturday ? rock superstar Bono.

 Bono said he was disappointed Martin had not kept an earlier promise to boost Canada?s foreign aid to a level equivalent to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.

 ?I?m bewildered really. I?m disappointed. I?ve not given up hope. I really can?t believe that Paul Martin would want to hold up history, or indeed would hold up history,? Bono told CBC radio in an interview broadcast on Saturday.

 Bono, a tireless campaigner on behalf of the poor in Africa and other regions, also read out the number of Martin?s office and urged Canadians to flood his office with telephone calls.

 Dogs? day

 Rome (Reuters): Dog owners in Turin will 

 be fined up to 500 euros ($650) if they don?t walk their 

 pets at least three times a day, under a new law from the 

 city?s council. People will also be banned from dyeing their 

 pets? fur or ?any form of animal mutilation? for merely 

 aesthetic motives such as docking dogs? tails, under the 

 law about to be passed in the northern Italian city. ?In 

 Turin it will be illegal to turn one?s dog into a ridiculous 

 fluffy toy,? the city?s La Stampa daily reported.

 Ice melt

 London (Reuters): Most of the glaciers on the Antarctic peninsular are in headlong retreat because of climate change, a leading scientist said. A study using aerial photographs spanning the past half century of all 244 marine glaciers on the west side found that 87 per cent of them were in retreat.

 Beethoven suffered from lead poisoning

 San Jose (California), Nov. 18 (Reuters): An analysis of skull fragments from German composer Ludwig van Beethoven confirms he suffered from lead poisoning for many years, a possible cause for his dour demeanour, researchers said yesterday.

 Beethoven had hoped that some day it would be revealed why he acted the way he did, said Paul Kaufmann, the owner of the skull fragments who loaned them to the Center for Beethoven Studies in San Jose, California.

 He was seen as angry and uncooperative at times. This finding helps shed some light on that, he said.Now we know that this was the reason for his suffering.

 Lead poisoning can lead to headaches, fatigue, concentration problems and other health issues.

 Analysis in the late 1990s from a lock of Beethovens hair indicated that he had lead poisoning at the time of his death, but the latest skull analysis revealed that the condition existed over a long period of time.

 You cant draw any conclusions from the hair sample. This is a more significant finding, Beethoven scholar and biographer Maynard Solomon, who is not involved in the skull testing, said. 

 DNA tests confirmed that the hair and skull fragments did indeed come from the composer whose Fifth Symphony starts with perhaps the best-known four-note motif in music history.

 Syria to begin Lebanon pullout

 Beirut, March 6 (Reuters): Lebanon says Syria will start pulling back its forces in the country tomorrow, as the US warned it would not accept any half measures by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

 Under intense international pressure, Assad announced plans yesterday for a complete withdrawal of troops from Lebanon but said that Damascus would play a role in its neighbour?s affairs.

 ?The withdrawal starts tomorrow,? Lebanese defence minister Abdul Rahim Mrad said, adding that forces would pull back from northern Lebanon and Mount Lebanon in accordance with the Taif Accord that ended Lebanon?s 1975-90 civil war. 

 Mrad said today the pullback would start immediately after a meeting in Damascus between leaders of both countries to approve Assad?s plan for a swift two-phased withdrawal.

 The US has been wary of Assad?s plans. 

 The White House said today that, with its allies, it would not stand by as Assad takes ?half measures? in Lebanon, promising to step up pressure for a complete and immediate withdrawal.

 The US administration has taken issue with Syria?s lack of a timetable and vague reference to a continuing role in Lebanon, despite the announced withdrawal.

 ?Something that he didn?t mention is Syrian secret services and intelligence officials that really keep the clamp of fear in the Lebanese people, to fully withdraw as well,? Bartlett said.

 President George W. Bush is considering new unilateral sanctions, including freezing Syrian assets, US officials say, and Washington was discussing ?next steps? with its European allies.

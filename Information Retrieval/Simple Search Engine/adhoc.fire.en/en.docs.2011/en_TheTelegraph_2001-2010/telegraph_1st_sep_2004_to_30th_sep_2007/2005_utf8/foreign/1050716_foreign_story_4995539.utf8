 Eye on Pak immigrants

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, July 15: The British government has decided to appoint liaison officers at its high commission in Islamabad to check the rising illegal immigration to Britain from Pakistan, media reports said. 

 These officers will interact with the officials in Pakistans interior ministry to deal with the issue of illegal immigration, The Friday Times newspaper quoted an interior ministry official as saying. 

 However, senior ministry officials have opposed the decision, saying it will encourage other embassies to make similar demands and ask for appointment of liaison officers. 

 The British governments decision to set up a separate desk at its high commission in Islamabad stems from a complaint lodged last year with Pakistani authorities citing the inability of the officials concerned to check illegal immigration. 

 The British government had also reportedly accused officials in the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and immigration department of involvement in the smuggling of humans. 

 Britain is not the only country facing a flood of illegal immigrants from Pakistan. 

 In fact, hundreds of illegal Pakistani immigrants have recently been deported from West Asian and Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, Oman,Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. 

 The Pakistan government launched an anti-human trafficking unit (ATU) in May to stop the trafficking of humans. 

 The ATU, which is part of the Federal Investigation Agency, was established with the US Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. 

 Britains decision to appoint a liaison officer comes after three Britons of Pakistani-origin exploded three bombs in London underground stations killing 54 people.

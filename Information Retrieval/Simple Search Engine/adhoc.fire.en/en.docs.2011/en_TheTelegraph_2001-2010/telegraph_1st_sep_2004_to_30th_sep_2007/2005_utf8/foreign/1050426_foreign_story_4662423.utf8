 Connelly big in Little Children

 Jennifer Connelly

 Los Angeles, April 25 (Reuters): Academy Award-winning actor Jennifer Connelly is in negotiations to join Kate Winslet in Little Children for New Line Cinema.

 Todd Field, the filmmaker behind the Oscar-nominated 2001 drama In the Bedroom, is set to direct the adaptation of the Tom Perrotta novel. Field and Perrotta are co-writing the screenplay.

 The novel revolves around a group of weird, suburban characters and their relationships with children. There?s a bisexual feminist addicted to Internet porn (Winslet), a stay-at-home dad who resists his wife?s ambitious plans for him, an uptight supermom who schedules sex with her husband and a paedophile fresh out of prison. Connelly, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for A Beautiful Mind, most recently starred in House of Sand and Fog and The Hulk. Her other credits include Requiem for a Dream and Mulholland Falls. She next appears in Walter Salles? Dark Water.

 Jennifer Connelly was born on December 12, 1970, at Catskill Mountains, New York. The daughter of Gerard, a clothing retailer, and Eileen Connelly, an antiques dealer, she spent four years in Woodstock, New York, but grew up in Brooklyn Heights, just across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan. When she was ten, family friends suggested to her parents that they should take her to a modelling audition. This led Jennifer to a modelling career and she soon began appearing in magazine ads. Her acting debut came in an episode of the British horror-anthology series Tales of the Unexpected.

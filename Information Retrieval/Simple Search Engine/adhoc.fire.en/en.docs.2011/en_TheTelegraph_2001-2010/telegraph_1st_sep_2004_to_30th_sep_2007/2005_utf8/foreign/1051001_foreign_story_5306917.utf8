 Book for that elusive word

 London, Sept. 30 (AFP): Ever needed that elusive word to describe a fear of having no beer? Or for a woman who looks pretty from the back but not the front? Help is at hand from a new book rounding up the worlds most specialised lexicon.

 The Meaning of Tingo, by British author Adam Jacot de Boinod, is somewhat of a labour of love, resulting from a year of solid trawling through 280 dictionaries and many dozens of Internet sites.

 Published yesterday, the title takes its name from a highly particular word in Pascuense, the language of Easter Island, meaning to borrow objects from a friends house, one by one, until there is nothing left.

 Jacot de Boinod was working as a researcher for a BBC Radio quiz when the idea of the book came to him.

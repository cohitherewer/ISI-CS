 Bitter drama

 Hong Kong, Aug. 5 (AFP): A Canadian director has chosen Hong Kongs top actor Chow yun-Fat and ex-Bond girl Michelle Yeoh to star in a World War II drama, a press report said today.

 Roger Spottiswoode, who directed Tomorrow Never Dies starring Yeoh, has cast Chow and the Malaysian-born star in a war drama called The Bitter Sea, the South China Morning Post reported.

 Based on the true story of a British reporter who saved 60 orphans, the movie is set during the Japanese invasion of China, the paper said.

 French hostage in Iraq pleads for help

 Baghdad, March 1 (Reuters): Kidnapped French journalist Florence Aubenas, taken hostage with her driver in Baghdad more than seven weeks ago, made a desperate appeal for help in a videotape released by Iraqi insurgents today.

 ?My name is Florence Aubenas. I?m French. I?m a journalist with Liberation,? she said on the undated tape, speaking in broken English and looking distraught and exhausted.

 ?My health is very bad. I?m very bad psychologically also,? she said, staring at the camera intently. Dressed in a grey sweatshirt and black trousers, she sat with her knees drawn up to her chest in front of a dark red background.

 Her plight underscored the security crisis in Iraq, where a new post-election government that has yet to be formed faces suicide bombings, shootings and kidnappings in an insurgency that shows no signs of easing after nearly two years.

 Yesterday, a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle near a crowd of people seeking jobs in the southern town of Hilla, killing 125 people and wounding 130.

 The tape is the first of Aubenas, 43, to be released since she and her Iraqi driver Hussein Hanun al-Saadi were seized in Baghdad on January 5, and the first indication that she is alive. The driver does not appear in the tape.

 Looking frail, Aubenas sounded desperate and appealed for help to a French parliamentarian. ?I ask particularly for the help of the French deputy Didier Julia. Help me Mr Julia, help me. It?s urgent,? she said.

 Julia, a member of the Lower House of parliament from President Jacques Chirac?s conservative UMP party, came to Iraq last September on a freelance effort to try to secure the release of two other kidnapped French journalists.

 The effort failed and the government denied it had approved his intervention. When the journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot were finally released in December after four months in captivity, they criticised Julia?s mission.

 The French government told Julia today not to undertake any personal initiative to help Aubenas, a senior member of the ruling Conservative party said.

 The foreign editor of Liberation, Francois Sergent, said: ?It is both what we feared and what we hoped for.? He had not seen the video.

 ?It is a sign that they are alive, of course, but we also feared this because the hostages are being held in conditions that make the pictures terrible to see.?

 Partial victory for Harry teacher

 Sarah Forsyth

 London, July 4: A teacher who claimed Prince Harry cheated in his A-level art coursework has won a claim for unfair dismissal against Eton College, despite criticisms of her evidence.

 Sarah Forsyth, 30, who secretly taped Prince Harry in an attempt to save her job, took the world-famous public school to an employment tribunal earlier this year claiming that Eton had unfairly decided not to renew her contract. 

 The tribunal panel today announced that Forsyth had won her case for unfair dismissal but rejected a separate unfair dismissal claim, and threw out her claim of sex discrimination. 

 In a lengthy judgment on the case, the tribunal panel described Forsyth as consistent and truthful on the whole. But the panel cast doubt on her evidence regarding Prince Harry.

 It said: The one reason where she did alter her evidence was in relation to her allegations concerning Prince Harrys expressive art project and the assistance she says she was required to give him. 

 It also criticised her for making a secret tape recording of Harry, something the panel described as the least attractive aspect of the claimants behaviour in these proceedings.

 The panel continued: To tape-record a pupil without that pupils consent is clearly an abuse of the position of trust in the pupil-teacher relationship. Further, the tape-recording took place on what appears to have been Prince Harrys last day at Eton.

 The panel also cast doubt on Forsyths account of the incident in 2002 involving his AS-Level coursework describing it as muddled.

 The ruling said: In terms of what actually happened at the time in 2002 the tribunal are not, in relation to this part of the claimants evidence, satisfied that events took place exactly as she described them.

 In relation to the specific suggestion that she actually worked with Prince Harry on the text, the tribunal prefer the evidence of Burke and Forsyth (no relation) on this point.

 During the tribunal in May, Forsyth claimed she had written most of the text of the princes AS-Level art coursework journal, something she said was unethical and probably constituted cheating. 

 The prince has strenuously denied any suggestion that he cheated and an investigation by the examination board Edexcel found no evidence of any improper behaviour. 

 A Clarence House spokesman said after the tribunals findings: We are delighted that Harry has been totally cleared of cheating. 

 As the tribunal says, it did not believe Forsyths evidence on this point ? these allegations have been thoroughly investigated by the examination board who found there was no evidence of malpractice.

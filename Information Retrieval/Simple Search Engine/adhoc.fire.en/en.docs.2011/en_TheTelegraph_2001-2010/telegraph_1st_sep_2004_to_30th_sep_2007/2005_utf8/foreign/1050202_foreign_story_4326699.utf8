 Strong role for Charlize in new film

 Charlize Theron

 Los Angeles, Feb. 1 (Reuters): Woody Harrelson, Sean Bean, Michelle Monaghan and Richard Jenkins are joining Charlize Theron in a fact-based movie about sexual harassment at a mining company.

 New Zealand director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) will start shooting the untitled Warner Bros. project ? previously known as Class Action ? later this month in New Mexico and Minnesota.

 Theron plays a single mom who rallies her female co-workers to rise above unfair treatment at a local mining company. Harrelson will play Theron?s lawyer, while Bean will play the boyfriend of a mineworker. Monaghan will play a mineworker, while Jenkins will play Theron?s father. Frances McDormand, Sissy Spacek and Jeremy Renner are among the cast.

 The movie is inspired by the book Class Action: The Story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law by Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Gansler.

 Harrelson most recently starred in After the Sunset.

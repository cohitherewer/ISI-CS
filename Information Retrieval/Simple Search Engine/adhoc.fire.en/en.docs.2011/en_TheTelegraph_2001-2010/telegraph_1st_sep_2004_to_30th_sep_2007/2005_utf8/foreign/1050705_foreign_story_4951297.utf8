 Kasparov plots Putin strategy

 Garry Kasparov

 Moscow, July 4 (Reuters): In 20 years at the top of the chess world, he used his laser-like focus to destroy his rivals. Now Garry Kasparov is turning his fearsome brainpower on a new opponent ? Russian President Vladimir Putin.

 Four months after retiring from competitive chess, Russian native Kasparov has re-emerged as the leader of his own Opposition political movement dedicated to destroying what he calls Putins growing dictatorship.

 I dont think intellect harms you in politics, he said in the cramped office of his United Civil Front, flanked by brown paper parcels of anti-Putin leaflets. Im building a strategy, he said. Today our goal is not to lose immediately. Not to get mated in one. Our goal is to survive. 

 Kasparov, 42, is still ranked world chess number one and was undefeated world champion for 8 years in a row.

 But he has swapped the hushed auditoriums where he played chess for boisterous meetings with voters in the Russian provinces. At one, in North Ossetia last week, he had eggs hurled at him.

 Kasparov is unbowed. Like many in Russia, he believes Putin will try to stay on when his final term ends in 2008 and has set himself the task of mobilising people to stop that happening. We want to unify all activists who believe the Putin regime is the greatest danger for Russia, he said. 

 Kasparov says Putins administration has stamped on political freedoms, swiped businesses from their rightful owners and failed to deliver on promises to transform living standards and end a separatist war in Chechnya.

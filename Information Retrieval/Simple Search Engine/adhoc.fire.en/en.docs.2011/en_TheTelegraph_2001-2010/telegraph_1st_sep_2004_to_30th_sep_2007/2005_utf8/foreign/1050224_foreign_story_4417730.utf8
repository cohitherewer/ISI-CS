 Connery a bully, say New York neighbours

 Sean Connery: Bond, Bully Bond

 New York, Feb. 23: Sean Connery and his family are being sued for ?16 million by their Manhattan neighbours who claim they ruined their home and made their lives unbearable.

 According to Dr Burton Sultan, a New York ophthalmologist, and his wife, the Connerys have subjected them to a ?campaign of deceit, harassment, destruction and litigation? aimed at forcing the Sultans to sell their portion of the six-floor Manhattan house at a knockdown price.

 In a legal action at the New York state Supreme Court, they accuse the Scottish actor and his family of allowing builders to subject them to constant and deafening noise, noxious fumes, water pouring through ceilings and even an infestation of rats.

 On one occasion, the Sultan?s daughter, Marla, allegedly went to ask the Connerys to stop making so much noise. 

 According to the action, Sean, 74, answered the door. 

 ?Scarcely, or in any event, no longer ?the sexiest man alive? portrayed in the tabloids and bearing no resemblance to the superspy... Connery?s appearance and behaviour was that of a rude, foul-mouthed, fat old man.?

 A spokesperson for Connery said: ?Sir Sean does not own any property in the United States and is rarely in New York. Anyone in the US can sue for anything. That does not mean that the suit has any merit. The claims are ridiculous.?

 Although Sean and his wife, Micheline, are reported to live principally in the Bahamas, the action claims that they have been living at the two-storey flat in Manhattan?s expensive Upper East Side since April, 2001. 

 The Sultans are also suing the Connerys? contractors and their lawyer.

 Bird flu rings recession bell

Jakarta, Nov. 3 (Reuters): Three Indonesian children are suspected to be the latest victims of bird flu, which the Asian Development Bank said today could trigger a global recession if a pandemic breaks out.

 Underlining the increasing urgency in tackling the H5N1 avian flu virus, the US and China announced new efforts to fight a possible pandemic, including $500 million to monitor the virus in poultry.

 The ADB said a year-long shock from bird flu in humans would cost Asian economies as much as $283 billion and would reduce the regions gross domestic product by 6.5 percentage points, hitting the trading hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore the hardest.

 Avian flu presents a major potential challenge to the development of the region, perhaps the most serious since the financial crisis of 1997, said the Manila-based ADB.

 A pandemic will likely slow or halt economic growth in Asia and lead to a significant reduction in trade, particularly of services. In the long run, potential economic growth will be lower and poverty will increase.

 The World Bank, in its twice-yearly report on east Asias economies, said today avian flu was a big risk to growth in 2006 due to potential policy actions such as quarantines and travel restrictions.

 In Indonesia, where four people have died of bird flu since July, health minister Siti Fadillah Supari said three children, all under the age of 5, had signs of viral infection.

 Asked by a reporter whether test results had been received, Supari said: Not yet, maybe in two or three days hopefully, because this is a holiday, but looking at the symptoms ... theres a large possibility that it is bird flu.

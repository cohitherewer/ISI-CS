 Sin caused tsunami: Scholar

 Riyadh, Jan. 18 (Reuters): A Saudi Muslim scholar who said the Asian tsunami was God?s punishment for Christmas debauchery has divided conservatives and liberals in Islam?s homeland.

 University professor Sheikh Abdulaziz Fawzan said it was no coincidence the December 26 tsunami, which killed 175,000 people, struck just after Christmas, when he said ?fornication and sexual perversion? were rampant in Asian beach resorts.

 ?This is a sign and punishment on which Muslims should reflect,? Fawzan told Saudi TV station al-Majd days after the tsunami devastated communities from Sumatra to Somalia. 

 His comments were echoed by other religious figures in Saudi Arabia.

 But several Saudi newspaper columnists have since hit back, mocking Fawzan and asking why God would choose to kill tens of thousands of Muslims if he was targeting Christmas revelry.

 Salma to bring sizzle to peace concert

 Salam Hayek: Superstar

 Oslo (Norway), Nov. 23 (AP): Oscar-nominated actress Salma Hayek will host this years Nobel Peace Prize concert in honour of laureate Mohamed ElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency he leads, organisers said.

 The 39-year-old superstar from Mexico will be master of ceremonies for a line-up that includes artists Gladys Knight, Duran Duran and Sugababes at the December 11 concert in Oslo, organisers said.

 It is fun to have such a big celebrity and wonderful actress as host, concert producer Odd Arvid Stroemstad said. She is also very concerned about other things than just playing films.

 The concert, held a day after the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo, has become one of the biggest events in the prize celebrations, and is usually broadcast on television in about 100 countries.

 Last year, it was hosted by American superstars Tom Cruise and Oprah Winfrey in honour of the 2004 laureate, Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai. Entertainers booked for this year;s concert also include Irish boy band Westlife, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Colombian rock star Juanes and Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins.

 Hayek was an Academy Awards nominee for best actress in 2003 for her role in the film Frida, which she also produced. She had made her way to Hollywood after starring in a popular Mexican soap opera.

 Geir Lundestad, non-voting secretary of the five-member Norwegian committee that awards the Peace Prize, said he was delighted that Hayek agreed to be host.

 Unwell Pinter to skip

 Harold Pinter, who won this years Nobel Prize in Literature, will not attend next months award ceremony in Stockholm for health reasons, the Nobel Foundation said today.

 The British playwright and poets publisher, Stephen Page, will accept the prestigious prize on Pinters behalf during the December 10 ceremony, the Foundation said.

 But Pinter, who has been treated for cancer in recent years, will come to the Swedish capital before the award ceremony to deliver a traditional lecture to the Swedish academy on December 7. Pinter, 75, looked frail when he spoke to the media after winning the prize in October.

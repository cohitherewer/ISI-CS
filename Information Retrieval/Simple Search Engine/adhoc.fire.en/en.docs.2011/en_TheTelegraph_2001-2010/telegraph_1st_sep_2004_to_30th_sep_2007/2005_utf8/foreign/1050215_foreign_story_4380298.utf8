 Get a taste of what warming can do

 Sydney, Feb. 14 (Reuters): 

 Islanders on tiny Tuvalu in the South Pacific last week 

 saw the future of global warming and rising sea levels, 

 as extreme high tides caused waves to crash over crumbling 

 sea-walls and flood their homes.

 ?Our island is sinking together with our hearts,? wrote Silafaga Lalua in Tuvalu News (www.tuvaluislands.com). Tuvalu is a remote island nation consisting of a fringe of atolls covering just 25.9 square km, with the highest point no more than 5 metres above sea level, but most a mere 2 metres.

 Global warming from greenhouse gas pollution is regarded as the main reason for higher sea levels, now rising about 2 mm a year, which could swamp low-lying nations such as Tuvalu and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean if temperatures keep rising.

 On February 16, a landmark UN pact to curb global warming comes into force. Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries are meant to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, largely from burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil in power plants, factories and cars, by an average 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels during 2008-12.

 But the world?s biggest greenhouse polluter, the US, has refused to join Kyoto, while some Kyoto signatories such as Spain and Portugal have increased greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent over 1990 levels.

 Last Tuesday evening, Tuvaluans in the capital Funafuti watched extreme high tides and strong winds send waves crashing across the islands main road, littering it with rocks and debris. ?Its that time of year again when my tiny island nation gets hit once again by strong winds and high tides,? said Lalua.

 ?The sea-walls that were constructed to be barriers from the wrath of the waves and the sea stood no chance against the damages of the sea over the years, and now they are only tatters of wire among debris along the shores,? said Lalua.

 As children rode the waves on makeshift surfboards, trailing behind cars and vans dashing for higher ground, their parents watched helplessly as their homes were flooded. ?Homes located on the narrower parts of the island experience flooding every time the tides are high,? said Lalua.

 ?I for one do not want my island wiped out from the face of the earth, and I call for help, from those in power who can do something to change our island?s situation,? she said.

 ?Your help and consideration will be treasured by every Tuvaluan around the globe.? In an address to the UN in October 2004, the Tuvalu government pleaded with the world to save the island nation from climate change. Tuvalu said it understood that for many countries, particularly the US, national security was now a priority and the island nation supported the war on terror.

 Tuvalu representative Enele Sopoaga said national security was also a priority for Tuvalu, but the threat it faced was not from terror groups or weapons of mass destruction but climate change.

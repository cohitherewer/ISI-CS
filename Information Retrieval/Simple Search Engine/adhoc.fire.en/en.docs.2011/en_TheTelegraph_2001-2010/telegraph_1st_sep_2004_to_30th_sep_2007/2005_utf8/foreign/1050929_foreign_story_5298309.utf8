 Designer guns for glam girls

 Julia Roberts

 Berlin, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Hollywood actors Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz look like bag ladies compared with the glamorous stars of the past, fashion designer Valentino said in an interview with a German newspaper published today.

 Today you see Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz running around looking unkempt in jogging trousers, they look like bag ladies, like homeless people. In the past you never saw that, Valentino was quoted as saying by weekly paper Die Zeit.

 In the past, actresses had to commit in their contracts to appear in public like stars when they left their homes, added the Italian, who dresses actor Gwyneth Paltrow and is often seen with her at red-carpet events like the Venice film festival.

 Valentino made his name in the 1960s and designed the wedding dress worn by Jacqueline Kennedy for her marriage to Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis.

 He still designs for the Valentino fashion group which was split from the textile holdings of its former parent company Marzotto earlier this year.

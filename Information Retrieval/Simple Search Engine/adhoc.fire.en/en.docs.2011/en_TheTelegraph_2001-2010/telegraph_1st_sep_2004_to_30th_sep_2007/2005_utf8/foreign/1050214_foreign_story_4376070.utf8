 Battleship Potemkin restored

 Berlin, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Battleship Potemkin, Sergei Eisenstein?s 1925 silent classic, has been restored and seen in its uncensored form for the first time in nearly 80 years.

 Cut by the Germans who bought the film, altered by the Soviets and banned in Britain and France for its revolutionary zeal, it nonetheless became one of the most important movies in cinema history.

 Restorers have worked for three years to insert scenes removed by German censors for their extreme violence and to correct translations of the Russian ?inter-titles? which toned down the mutinous sailors? revolutionary rhetoric.

 Based on a true story, Battleship Potemkin dramatises a mutiny on a Russian ship and how it inspired a failed 1905 uprising against the country?s tsars.

 Marxist threat to Chandrika

 Colombo, June 15 (Reuters): Sri Lankas government was set for a defection by its Marxist ally that would reduce it to a hamstrung minority in parliament, but the coalition was not expected to fall entirely ? for now.

 The Peoples Liberation Front (JVP), President Chandrika Kumaratungas Marxist and hardline nationalist ally, has given her an ultimatum to abandon plans to share international tsunami aid with Tamil Tiger rebels. Aides say she has no intention of scrapping the plan.

 That means that tomorrow, the Marxists ? who regard the LTTE as terrorists who do not deserve aid ? will cross over to the Opposition benches and the government will have to limp on.

 It is not likely she will ditch it in the next few hours, so we are definitely leaving the government. We will not be a part of the government after midnight today, said Sunil Hadunnetti, deputy minister of small and rural industries and a senior member of the JVP politburo. Our politburo will meet during the day to decide on the immediate next step after we abandon the government, he added. JVP sources said the partys three cabinet ministers would start to clear their offices today ahead of the deadline.

 Top government aides say the pact ? under which committees comprising rebels, government officials and Muslims can recommend, prioritise and monitor projects funded by $3 billion in pledged aid ? will be formally agreed within days.

 The main Opposition United National Party (UNP) yesterday allayed fears of a total government collapse or imminent snap elections, saying it would not oust the government over the aid-sharing issue.

 A vote of no-confidence would need their backing as well as that of the Marxists, and analysts say the UNP are biding their time and are not ready to face a general election just yet. But protests by the JVP and hardline Buddhist monks who want the rebels crushed are escalating.

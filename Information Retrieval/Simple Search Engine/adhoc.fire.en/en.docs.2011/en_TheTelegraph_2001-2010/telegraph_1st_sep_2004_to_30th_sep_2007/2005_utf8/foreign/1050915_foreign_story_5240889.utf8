 Fine Print

 Bets on beauty

 Rome, Sept 14 (Reuters): A loosening of government gaming rules means that Italians will be able to bet legally on the Miss Italy contest for the first time, upsetting contestants.

 Were people, not objects or, worse, animals, complained Anna Prete, the Miss Calabria from the southern region of the same name and one of the many finalists unhappy with the government-sponsored scheme.

 Betting on Miss Italy is really bad, she told Rome daily Il Messaggero ahead of tomorrows final of the beauty pageant.

 Fuel furore

 Berlin (Reuters): A German inventor 

 has angered animal rights activists with his answer to fighting 

 the soaring cost of fuel ? dead cats. Christian Koch, 55, 

 from the eastern county of Saxony, told Bild newspaper 

 that his organic diesel fuel ? a home-made blend of garbage, 

 run-over cats, and other ingredients ? is a proven alternative 

 to normal consumer diesel. I drive my normal diesel-powered 

 car with this mixture, Koch said.I have gone 

 170,000 km without a problem. But the president of 

 the German Society for the Protection of Animals, Wolfgang 

 Apel, said using dead cats for fuel was illegal.

 Real sheep

 Zagreb, Croatia (Reuters): Croatia has launched a new reality show on the Internet, starring sheep instead of people. The winner of the 10-day Stado (herd) show, which closes on September 17, will receive poetry in its honour instead of money. Those voted out of the seven-member herd might be eaten, the Vecernji List daily reported on Wednesday. The show can be followed 24 hours a day on website www.stado.org, where visitors can see how the sheep feed and interact with each other.

 Toddler peak push

 London, Aug. 13 (AFP): A two-year-old toddler has stormed to the top of Englands tallest mountain Scafell Pike, a newspaper said today.

 Elisha Smith, from York in northern England, is believed to be the youngest person ever to scale the 978 metre high summit, the Daily Mail reported. Elishas parents had expected to carry her up the mountain in the picturesque lake district in the northwest. But the biscuit-fuelled toddler left them stunned as she charged up the peak.

 Now her parents have set their sights on a place in the Guinness Book of Records by taking her to conquer Snowdon, Wales biggest mountain and Scotlands 1,344 metre high Ben Nevis, Britains tallest peak, before her third birthday. We decided to go at her pace and take the most direct route up, proud father Shane Smith said. We had lots of chocolate biscuits with us, and they kept her happy. We had about five breaks but the climb didnt bother Elisha at all.

 Paula probe

 Los Angeles (Reuters): A probe by the 

 Fox television network has found no evidence to support 

 claims by a former contestant on the hit television talent 

 show American Idol, that he had had a sexual affair 

 with judge Paula Abdul. The investigation also found that 

 Abdul had not given Corey Clark any special help with his 

 songs, wardrobe or any related matters, Fox said. 

 Ellens Emmy excuse

 Bush pledge boosts New Orleans rebuild

 New Orleans, Sept. 16 (Reuters): New Orleans famed French Quarter is racing to open its bars and clubs, spurred by President George W. Bushs promise to rebuild a city where rescuers are still picking up the dead of Hurricane Katrina.

 Even as ruined neighbourhoods lay under water and many evacuees scattered in temporary shelters around the country tried to find missing family members, areas that largely escaped the storms damage showed new signs of life.

 Mayor Ray Nagin called on business owners to return to the French Quarter and three other areas this weekend, and said about 182,000 residents, or 40 per cent of the citys population, would be allowed back over the next 10 days.

 Some were already working again, trying to get a head start on the citys recovery.

 Bush pledged massive federal aid to rebuild New Orleans and other Gulf Coast towns and cities ravaged by Katrina.

 There is no way to imagine America without New Orleans, and this great city will rise again, Bush said in a televised prime-time speech from the French Quarters historic Jackson Square last night. He conceded the response to Katrina was poorly coordinated and that all levels of government were overwhelmed by the destruction.

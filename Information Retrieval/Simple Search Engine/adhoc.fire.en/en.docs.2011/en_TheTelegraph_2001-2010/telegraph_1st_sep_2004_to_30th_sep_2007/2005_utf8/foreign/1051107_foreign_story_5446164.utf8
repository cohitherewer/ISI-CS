 Blair softens stand on anti-terror rule

 Blair: Terror trouble

 London, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair today signalled he would climb down in a stand-off over new anti-terrorism powers that had threatened to deal him the first major defeat in Parliament of his eight-year rule.

 The anti-terrorism powers have turned into the first big test of Blairs ability to get his way in Parliament since losing two-thirds of his majority in an election in May and announcing he will not stand for a fourth term.

 His authority was also tested in recent days by the resignation of a top ally and bickering among his cabinet over education and health policies in what newspapers called his week from hell.

 Ministers insisted he had not made an embarrassing volte-face by signalling he would back off from a measure to give police 90 days to hold terrorism suspects without charge.

 Blair gave a tough interview to a Sunday paper insisting that police need new powers to hold terrorism suspects for up to 90 days without charge. He also said police had thwarted two new attacks since suicide bombers killed themselves and 52 passengers in London transport in July.

 I still think there is a woeful complacency about a lot of the public debate about this, Blair said. The police told me, and the security services back them up, that they may have stopped two further attempts since July 7, Blair said.

 What theyre saying is: Look, 90 days is what we believe we need.

 But a source in his Downing Street office told the Observer newspaper: The Prime Minister understands there is likely to be a compromise. 

 Blairs home secretary pulled the 90-day powers out of a flagship anti-terrorism bill last week to avoid losing the vote. The rest of the bills new powers squeaked through by just a single vote ? the closest vote Blair has faced in power.

 A new vote on the powers is due later this week.

 Critics, including many in his own Labour party, say the 90-day power is one step too far in restricting civil liberties, after the government rolled out a host of draconian new powers in April and proposed more since the July attacks.

 A compromise proposal discussed by some in Parliament would extend the existing 14-day detention powers to 28 days. Blairs officials put a brave face on the likelihood of concessions.

 Its certainly not a humiliating U-turn. What we will be doing this week is trying to convince and persuade people to get a consensus across Parliament, home office Minister Hazel Blears told Sky News. 

 Our first responsibility is to protect the public. It is the police who are telling us they need these powers.

 Blairs opponents say the apparent reversal on terrorism powers raises the broader question of whether Blair will be able to persuade his party followers to support other reforms.

 Conservative leader Michael Howard said last week a trickle of authority away from Blair had turned into a flood.

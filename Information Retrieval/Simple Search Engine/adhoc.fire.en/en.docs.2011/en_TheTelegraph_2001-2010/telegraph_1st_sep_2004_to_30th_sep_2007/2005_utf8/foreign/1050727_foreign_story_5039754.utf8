 Rail union in strike threat

 London, July 26 (Reuters): London Underground staff will consider strike action if talks fail on tightening security on the capitals rail network following this months bombings, a union leader said today.

 The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said it would ballot its 11,000 members working on the Tube on strike action if it did not reach a deal with transport officials to step up security.

 Given the urgency of the situation and the fact that it can take up to a month to ballot, we will not be sitting on our hands, RMT general secretary Bob Crow said in a statement.

 The union is due to meet the networks operator and senior police officials tomorrow for security talks after the July 7 bomb attacks on Londons transport network killed 52 people.

 The union said it would demand the introduction of guards on trains, more station staff and better emergency training and equipment including breathing apparatus for rail workers.

 London Undergound managing director Tim Toole said employees had responded magnificently to the dangers posed by the attacks and the company would continue to work with them.

 The RMT said some drivers on the rail network refused to work after an attempted attack last week because they feared for their safety.

 Cherie sermon

 Cherie Blair, wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, today spoke in Kuala Lumpur on the need to respect human rights in counter-terrorism, four days after UK police shot dead a man mistaken for a bomber.

 Blair, an expert in human rights law, said in a law lecture in Malaysia that she did not want to make light of this months horrific bomb blasts in London. But she added: At the same time, it is all too easy for us to respond to such terror in a way which undermines commitment to our most deeply held values and convictions and which cheapens our right to call ourselves a civilised nation.

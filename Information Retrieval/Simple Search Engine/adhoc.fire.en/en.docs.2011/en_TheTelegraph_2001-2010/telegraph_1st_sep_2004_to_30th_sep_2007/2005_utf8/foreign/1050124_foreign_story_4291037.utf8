 King of the Poor costs millions

 King Mohammed VI: Budget blues

 Paris, Jan. 23: The Moroccan king, Mohammed VI, spends ?3.6 million a month on staff wages, ?97,000 on car repairs and almost ?53,000 on animal feed, according to a breakdown of the palace budget that has enraged his poverty-stricken subjects.

 Details of the lavish spending ? the first time that the finances of a royal Arab household have been revealed ? show that the king costs Moroccan taxpayers ?144.6 million a year, 18 times more than Queen Elizabeth II.

 The palace spends ?632,000 on electricity and water, ?600,000 on telephones and ?355,000 on petrol and fuel. The monthly clothes bill comes to ?121,000, while stationery alone costs ?61,000.

 Democracy campaigners have pointed out that six million Moroccans ? a fifth of the 30-million population ? have to survive on about $1 a day.

 The Moroccan royal family?s private wealth is estimated at $4-$5 billion by Forbes magazine, though other estimates put it at $20 billion.

 The revelations, printed in a Moroccan French-language magazine, prompted the king?s cousin, Prince Moulay Hicham, to call for Morocco?s system of rule to be overhauled.

 ?Reforming the monarchy is the only way to ensure it endures,? said the prince, who has been banned from the royal palace in the capital, Rabat, since the two men fell out and now lives in America.

 Last month, Morocco?s parliament, which is controlled by the king, went through the annual ritual of approving the royal budget without debate. About 1,100 people work at the court of Mohammed VI, 42, who gained the reputation of a playboy before he succeeded his despotic father, Hassan II, in 1999. He was once hailed as the ?King of the Poor? for his early promises to reform Morocco?s economy, although on one official visit to the Western Sahara, the king required four Hercules transport aircraft to ferry his retinue.

 According to the magazine, Tel Quel, which compiled the figures from official records and broke a national taboo in publishing them, the king benefits more from his taxpayers than any other royal family or head of state in Europe.

 In Britain, the Queen?s annual budget has been frozen at ?7.9 million for the next five years, while Spain?s royal family costs ?5.05 million and the Belgian monarchy ?4.23 million a year. President Chirac of France has a budget of ?22.3 million a year. The king?s monthly ?salary? of ?25,126 compares with that of senior Western company directors; but the total sum paid monthly to other members of the royal family is ?114,500.

 Abdelhamid Amine, president of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights, which has been campaigning for a minimum wage, praised Tel Quel for publishing the figures. ?People are angry to learn that there is such an enormous disparity between the rich and poor in our country.?

 Tel Quel?s royal budget issue sold 35,000 copies, double its usual weekly circulation. A spokesperson for the independent magazine said: ?We?ve waited for some official reaction to the article, but so far there?s been nothing. Not from the court, from the official press or from MPs. It?s quite bizarre.?

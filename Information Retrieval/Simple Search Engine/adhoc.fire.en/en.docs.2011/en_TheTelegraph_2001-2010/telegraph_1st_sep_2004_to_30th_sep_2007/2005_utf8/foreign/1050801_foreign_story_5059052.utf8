 Man held for racist UK murder

 London, July 31 (Reuters): British police today arrested a man on suspicion of murder in their hunt for the killers of a black teenager left with an axe in his skull following a racist attack in Liverpool.

 Anthony Walker, 18, a local college student, was attacked by a gang of three or four men, just minutes after he had been taunted with racial abuse while waiting for a bus with his girlfriend and a male relative on Friday night.

 Merseyside Police have arrested an 18-year-old man from Huyton on suspicion of the murder of Anthony Walker, a police spokesman said.

 The arrest came after police carried out raids on three addresses in the Huyton area.

 Detectives said Walker had been abused by a man wearing a hooded top as he waited with his 17-year-old white girlfriend and a relative at a bus stop in Huyton.

 They did not respond and moved away through a park when the gang attacked him. 

 The girlfriend and the relative, also 17, ran to get help. When they returned they found the victim slumped on the ground with serious injuries. He later died in hospital.

 What we are dealing with here is an unprovoked and vicious attack on a young black man which we believe to be racially motivated, Merseyside police assistant chief constable Bernard Lawson said.

 In Mais Punjab, feet of woman chopped off

 Islamabad, July 9 (Reuters): A Pakistani man and some of his relatives chopped off his wifes feet after accusing her of being promiscuous, police said today.

 The woman survived the gruesome attack, the latest in a wave of assaults that have raised international concern about the plight of women in Pakistan, particularly in conservative rural areas.

 It is a shameful act of cruelty against a woman and we are taking it seriously, said Talat Ali, a senior police official in Punjab province. Those who have carried out this crime will not be spared.

 The 32-year-old woman told police her feet were chopped off on June 24 by her husband, her father-in-law, a brother-in-law and two others after they accused her of being of bad character, a euphemism for promiscuous.

 Violence against women is common in rural Pakistan where tribal and feudal customs hold sway. The latest incident occurred in central Punjab province where the 2002 gangrape of a woman, Mukhtaran Mai, on the orders of a village council, triggered an international outcry.

 President Pervez Musharraf, who is trying to project Pakistan as a moderate and progressive Muslim nation, has condemned violence against women and said his government was committed to ensuring victims got justice.

 The women in the latest incident had separated from her husband but had gone to his familys house to see her daughter, police said. 

 Her father-in-law chained her up and that night he and the others took her to a river bed on the edge of their village of Mohammadpur and cut off her feet.

 Two days later her parents reported her missing and police raided the house, found her and took her to hospital, where she remains.

 No one can be allowed to treat a woman in this manner no matter what the charges against her, Ali said. There is no evidence that she was of bad character.

 Child marriage

 An eight-year-old boy and a four-year-old girl were allegedly wed near Lahore, a media report said.

 Imran, son of Nazar Hussain, and Shazia, daughter of Manzoor, were married in Nadrabad II in Lahore on Wednesday, the Daily Times newspaper reported today.

 The young bride, who is not even aware that she has been married, will be sent to Imrans house when she turns 14. Police said that it would investigate the matter and take legal action against the parents of the children and the nikah registrar if the marriage was proven.

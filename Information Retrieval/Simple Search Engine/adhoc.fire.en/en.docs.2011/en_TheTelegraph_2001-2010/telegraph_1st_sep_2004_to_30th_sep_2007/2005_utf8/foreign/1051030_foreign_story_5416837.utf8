 Big Ben silent for 24 hours

 London, Oct. 29 (Reuters): The chimes of Big Ben, the tower clock that is an iconic image of London, stopped today for retuning and maintenance work and will remain silent for over 24 hours, the longest period in more than two decades.

 The clock, located in a tower of Britains parliament, became fully operational in 1859. It was stopped on Saturday after the 0700 GMT chimes and is not expected to be back in action until 1600 GMT tomorrow. A spokesman said engineers would be testing for cracks or damage.

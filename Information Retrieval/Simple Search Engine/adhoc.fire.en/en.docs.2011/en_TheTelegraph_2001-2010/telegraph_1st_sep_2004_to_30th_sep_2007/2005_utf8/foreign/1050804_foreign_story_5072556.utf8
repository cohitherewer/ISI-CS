 Gere to tend to Flock in new thriller

 Richard Gere

 Los Angeles, Aug. 3: Richard Gere has signed to play a federal agent in The Flock a $35 million independently-funded thriller that marks the English-language debut of Hong Kong director Andrew Lau .

 Flock follows a hypervigilant agent (Gere) who, while training his young female replacement, must track down a missing girl who may be linked to a paroled sex offender he is investigating.

 Gere is in Manhattan shooting The Hoax, in which he plays author Clifford Irving, who sold a bogus biography of Howard Hughes in the 1970s and touched off a media frenzy. He was last in theatres with Jennifer Lopez in Shall We Dance?.

 Italy ire over CIA kidnap

 CHARLES M. SENNOTT 

 London, July 3: The international fallout from the apparent CIA abduction of an Islamic militant cleric off the streets of Milan highlights the potential for such tactics to heighten friction between the US and its European allies. The issue is how to wage the fight against terrorism. 

 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi summoned the US ambassador, Mel Sembler, on Friday. He demanded that the US show full respect for Italys sovereignty. 

 Berlusconi, a key ally of President Bush on the Iraq war despite its unpopularity in Italy and in much of Europe, called on the US to explain the kidnapping of the Egyptian cleric in Milan, just one month before the US launched its invasion of Iraq in March 2003. 

 European intelligence officials, Western diplomats, and specialists on terrorism say the brazen operation ? whether it had approval from a level of Italian intelligence or not ? has focused a harsh European spotlight on a dark corner of the US antiterrorism campaign. 

 The CIAs increasing use of extraordinary renditions, in which US authorities abduct terrorism suspects and transfer them to third countries that are known to use torture, has inflamed passions across Europe among human rights activists and the intelligence community. 

 It has raised concern that such tactics not only flout international law, but they may also ultimately undercut cooperation between the US and its European allies. 

 Tom Parker, a senior official in the British governments counter-terrorism operations in the 1990s who has subsequently worked in counterterrorism and international law for the UN, said: There is no doubt that this incident in Milan and others like it in other cities in Europe will undercut cooperation between governments and the US. 

 A European counterterrorism official in Brussels said there were many unknowns about what had happened in Milan, and about whether the CIA had Italian approval for the operation. 

 But the official added, There is a public perception issue, and that will almost inevitably hurt cooperation between the US and Europe on fighting terror. 

 The Washington Post, citing unnamed CIA sources, reported that the agency had briefed and had sought approval from intelligence counterparts in Italy before the operation. 

 The Italian government has publicly insisted that such approval was neither sought nor granted. And an Italian magistrate has issued arrest warrants for the 13 alleged CIA agents who are reported to have carried out the snatch-and-grab seizure of Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, 42, who was then flown by the CIA agents to Egypt for interrogation. 

 The imam told his family he had been tortured with electric shocks during his detention.

 Poultry panic flies fast

 London, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Hungarian butchers throw up their arms in despair as customers shun their poultry, anxious citizens across Europe buy up anti-flu vaccine, and Bulgarian newspapers proclaim outright panic.

 The arrival of the deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu on Europes doorstep is viewed with varying degrees of alarm and puzzlement from Dublin to Athens. A Cypriot daily invoked historic parallels of invasion, announcing a feathered Atilla.

 Greece, on one of the main paths for birds migrating to Africa, has reacted calmly. But Bulgaria, bordering Turkey, awoke to alarming headlines. Panic! Dead Birds At Home, Too! runs a headline in red letters in the daily 24 Chasa.

 Hungarian butchers said sales of poultry had fallen sharply over the past week.

 Charles told to atone for adultery

Charles and Camilla: Sorry?

 London, March 27 (PTI): Prince Charles should atone ?for committing adultery? and apologise to Andrew Parker Bowles for breaking up his marriage to Camilla, a leading Church of England bishop has said. 

 David Stancliffee, the bishop of Salisbury, said church rules dictated that the prince should atone for committing adultery, the Sunday Times reported today. The bishop?s intervention demonstrates the church?s determination to extract a price for its endorsement of the wedding. 

 Stancliffee, who is the church?s principal authority on the rules of worship, has made it clear that Prince Charles and his bride would have to do more than simply repeat the formulaic words of a confession during the church service. ?The Prince of Wales and Mrs Parker Bowles will be taking part in prayers of penitence at the service of prayer and dedication following their civil marriage,? Stancliffee, who has made the wedding possible, said in a statement. 

 The bishop declined to specify what form of contrition Charles?s apology to Andrew Parker Bowles should take. But it would have to be offered in advance of the church service in St. George?s chapel, Windsor, on April 8. 

 Divorced men and women who have committed adultery are typically expected to apologise directly to the injured party when seeking a church service. This can be done person to person or by a letter. 

 Another media report today said Charles has rejected legal advice to draw up a pre-nuptial agreement with Camilla. Friends say that despite the unequivocal nature of the advice, Charles dismissed the idea that he should seek to protect his assets in case his second marriage failed, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

 The paper said that Prince Charles was given the legal advice last month when he announced his intention to marry Camilla on April 8 after an on-off relationship spanning 33 years.

 Pre-marriage agreements, which began in the US, are not legally binding, but they are increasingly accepted as valid by divorce courts if certain guidelines have been followed.

 Clarence House yesterday declined to comment on ?a private matter?. However, one friend of the prince said: ?There is no pre-nup. He is adamant that the marriage has to be based from the start on trust and good faith?.

 The prince borrowed money from the Queen to provide Diana, Princess of Wales with a ?17.5-million settlement in 1996. Geoffrey Bignell, who handled Prince Charles?s financial affairs for more than a decade until 1996, disclosed last year that the prince was ?taken to the cleaners? and sold his entire investment portfolio to meet the Princess?s demands.

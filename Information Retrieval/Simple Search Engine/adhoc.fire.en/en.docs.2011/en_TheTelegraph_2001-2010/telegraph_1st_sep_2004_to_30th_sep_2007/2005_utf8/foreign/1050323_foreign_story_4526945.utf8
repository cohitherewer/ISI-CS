 Lens that you can sleep in

 London, March 22 (Reuters): A new generation of contact lenses can significantly reduce the risk of severe eye infections, researchers said today.

 Wearers who keep their lenses in overnight can develop keratitis ? inflammation or irritation of the cornea ? but scientists found the new ones cut that risk fivefold.

 ?Those who choose to sleep in lenses should be advised to wear silicone hydrogel lenses, which carry a five times decreased risk of severe keratitis for extended wear compared with hydrogel lenses,? said Dr Philip Morgan of University of Manchester in the Journal of Ophthalmology.

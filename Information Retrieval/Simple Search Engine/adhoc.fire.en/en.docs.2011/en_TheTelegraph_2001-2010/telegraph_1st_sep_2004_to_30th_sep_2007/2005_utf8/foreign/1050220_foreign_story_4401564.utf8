 Beyonce: Express belief

New York, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Beyonce may not 

be nominated for any Academy Awards, but she will be the main musical attraction 

at this year?s Oscars ceremony. The singer will perform three of the five tunes 

nominated for best original song.

 Josh Groban and Beyonce will perform Believe at the 77th annual ceremony, set for February 27 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles.

 Believe, written by Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri, is from the film The Polar Express. It was performed by Groban on the movie?s soundtrack.

 Beyonce will step in for Minnie Driver to sing Learn to Be Lonely, the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Charles Hart tune from The Phantom of the Opera. Driver performed the song on the film?s soundtrack. Accompanied by the American Boyschoir, Beyonce will also sing Look to Your Path (Vois Sur Ton Chemin) from The Chorus (Les Choristes).

 Counting Crows will do their song Accidentally in Love from Shrek 2. Rounding out the nominations lineup, Carlos Santana and Enrique Iglesias will perform Al Otro Lado del Rio from The Motorcycle Diaries.

 Pepsi is launching a cinema spot featuring Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and soccer star David Beckham that will only run in markets outside the US, the company said.

 The two-minute spot is set in Hong Kong and takes place inside a dojo, a place where martial arts are studied.

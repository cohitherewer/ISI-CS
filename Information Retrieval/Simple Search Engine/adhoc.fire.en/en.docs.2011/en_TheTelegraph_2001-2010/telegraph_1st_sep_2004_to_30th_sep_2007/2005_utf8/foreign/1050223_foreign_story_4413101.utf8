 From Freedom to French fries

 Brussels, Feb. 22 (Reuters): President George W. Bush called the French leader by his first name Jacques, ate ?French fries,? and joked about inviting the Iraq war opponent to his Texas ranch, saying: ?I?m looking for a good cowboy.?

 Bush?s self-described working dinner with President Jacques Chirac, like the rest of his European tour, was meant to showcase his willingness to reach out to long-time European critics, including Chirac, who led opposition to the war.

 A senior Bush administration official described their meeting in Brussels yesterday as the best ever ??warm under any measure? ? and proof relations had come a long way from the tense days before the Iraq invasion, when the US Congress renamed French fries ?Freedom Fries? and Bush?s plane, Air Force One, served ?Freedom Toast? rather than ?French toast.?

 ?This is my first dinner, since I?ve been re-elected, on European soil, and it?s with Jacques Chirac ? and that ought to say something,? Bush said with Chirac at his side. ?It ought to say how important this relationship is for me personally and how important this relationship is for my country,? Bush told reporters.

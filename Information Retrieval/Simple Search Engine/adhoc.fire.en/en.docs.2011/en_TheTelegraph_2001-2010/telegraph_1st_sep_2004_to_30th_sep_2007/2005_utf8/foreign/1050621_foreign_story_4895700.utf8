 Anger at Kuwait woman MP

 Massouma al-Mubarak

 Kuwait, June 20 (Reuters): Amid noisy protests by Islamist and conservative MPs, Kuwaits first woman member of parliament was sworn in today, only weeks after women were given the vote following a 40-year struggle for political rights.

 The appointment of rights activist Massouma al-Mubarak as planning minister and minister of state for administrative development affairs was the latest of Kuwaits democratic reforms.

 She became an MP because all Kuwaiti cabinet members are considered ex-officio MPs and vote along with the 50 regular parliamentarians on all major bills and legislation.

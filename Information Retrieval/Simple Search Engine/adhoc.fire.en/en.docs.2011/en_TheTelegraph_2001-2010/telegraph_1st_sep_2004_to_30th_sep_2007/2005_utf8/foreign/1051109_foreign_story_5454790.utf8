 Copycat clashes in Brussels

 Brussels, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Five cars were set on fire in Brussels overnight, raising the number of vehicles burned in the Belgian capital to 10 since Sunday in what officials say appeared to be an imitation of violence in France.

 There were also minor incidents of arson in the northern town of Sint Niklaas ? where a car was also set ablaze ? and the eastern city of Liege, authorities reported. 

 Belgian officials played down the extent of the incidents.

 There were no riots. These were all very isolated incidents. Whoever set fire to the cars must have been influenced by the footage of what is going on in France, Brussels fire department spokesman Francis Boileau said.

 In a deliberate effort to avoid politicising the incidents, federal police and the governments crisis centre declined to comment, referring the matter to local police and municipal authorities.

 These are only isolated cases. Our prevention units and local police officers are working on it. They really know these youngsters. I have no fear, Jacques Simonet, the mayor of the Brussels district of Anderlecht, told VTM television.

 The Belgian authorities have sought to forestall any spillover of the French violence by stepping up visible police patrols in streets and on public transport while increasing dialogue with immigrant community leaders.

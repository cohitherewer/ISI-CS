 Pole flights

 Hong Kong, March 27 (AFP): Airline Cathay Pacific has limited air crews? flights on the non-stop Hong Kong-New York route after it was found the journey could increase the likelihood of cancer, a report published today said.

 However, unions are concerned that no such limits have been put on passenger flights. The report said officials felt it unnecessary as customers do not fly enough to be at risk.

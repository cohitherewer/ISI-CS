 Zarqawi captured amp; freed

 PHILIPPE NAUGHTON

 Zarqawi: Lucky 

 London, Dec. 16: The Iraqi 

 government admitted today that its security forces had captured 

 Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the one-legged Jordanian terror chief 

 whose picture is plastered all over the country, but let 

 him go because nobody recognised him.

 Iraqs most-wanted man was 

 arrested in the rebel stronghold of Fallujah last year with 

 a group of other insurgents, but he was released after a 

 simple interrogation.

 The confession was made by Hussain 

 Kamal, the deputy interior minister. He was arrested 

 more than one year ago in Fallujah by Iraqi police, 

 Kamal said. It seems they did not recognise him, thats 

 why they released him.

 However, the Pentagon said today 

 it could not confirm that the Iraqi police had captured 

 Zarqawi. That was rumoured a year ago and never proved 

 to be confirmed, said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman.

 The shadowy Jordanian-born Islamist 

 ? who is thought only to have one leg after being injured 

 fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan ? has a $25 million 

 US bounty on his head. He is human, he does not have 

 the power of God, Kamal insisted. We will bring 

 him to justice. He got away once, he will not get away the 

 next time.

 Zarqawi, 39, is allegedly the 

 mastermind of numerous bombings, armed attacks, hostage 

 murders and other acts of violence in Iraq, and has been 

 sentenced to death in Jordan for the 2002 murder of a US 

 diplomat. US forces blame him for the deaths of at least 

 700 people in bombing attacks and abductions in Iraq.

 The leader of al Qaida in Iraq, 

 Zarqawi is also believed to have personally murdered Ken 

 Bigley, the British hostage beheaded in September 2004.

 US forces in Iraq say they have 

 killed or captured a number of Zarqawis operatives 

 and have come close to capturing Zarqawi himself on several 

 occasions. 

 We come close to Zarqawi 

 continuously and at one point in time, in the not too distant 

 future, we are going to get Zarqawi, Major General 

 Rick Lynch, spokesman for the US-led multinational force 

 in Iraq, said last month. 

 In Jordan, he was sentenced in 

 1994 to 15 years in prison for membership in an illegal 

 group and arms possession, but later freed under a general 

 amnesty by King Abdullah in May 1999. 

 He has topped the US most-wanted 

 list in Iraq since Saddam Husseins downfall in April 

 2003.

 Unlike bin Laden, however, Zarqawi 

 has never released a videotaped message and prefers to remain 

 a shadowy figure. Only grainy identity shots and old images 

 from Afghanistan give any clue as to his appearance. 

 Born Fadel Nazzal al-Khalayleh 

 in October 1966, Zarqawi became a radical after being shocked 

 by the social openness that emerged in conservative Jordan 

 with the arrival of tens of thousands of Palestinians who 

 fled Kuwait after Iraq invaded the Gulf emirate in 1990.

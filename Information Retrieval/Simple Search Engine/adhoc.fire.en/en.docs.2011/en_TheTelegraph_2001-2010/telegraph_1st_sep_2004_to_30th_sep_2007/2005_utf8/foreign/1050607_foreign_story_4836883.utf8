 Citigroup data lost in transit

 New York, June 6 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc., the worlds largest bank, today said account and payment history data on 3.9 million of its customers were lost in transit by United Parcel Service Inc.

 The disappearance is the latest in a series of data breaches involving US banks, including No. 2 Bank of America Corp. New York-based Citigroup said the data was stored on computer tapes, and lost while UPS, the worlds biggest package carrier, was shipping them to an Experian credit bureau in Texas.

 The tapes, which also contained social security numbers, covered CitiFinancial Branch Network customers and about 50,000 customers with closed accounts from CitiFinancial Retail Services. Customers of CitiFinancial Auto and CitiFinancial Mortgage are unaffected.

 Citigroup on Saturday mailed a letter to customers about the problem. It said it has received no reports of unauthorised activity, and said there is little risk of the accounts being compromised.

 We were moving this using an enhanced security procedure we specified and developed with (UPS), said Kevin Kessinger, president of Citigroups North America consumer finance unit, in an interview. You can imagine how frustrated and disappointed we are that this occurred.

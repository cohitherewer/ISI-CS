 Actor ire over underwear

 Scarlett Johansson

 New York, July 13 (Reuters): Some Hollywood actors are cautious about revealing too much skin but 20-year-old Scarlett Johansson had to be persuaded to keep her underwear on, according to her director in The Island, Michael Bay.

 Speaking before yesterdays New York premiere of the thriller, which stars Johansson and Ewan McGregor as human clones on the run, Bay said he was prepared for the usual actor nerves when it came to shooting a love scene between the two leads.

 Were ready to go and of course the actor is not there, he said. He was summoned to Johanssons trailer, expecting to have to reassure the star of Lost in Translation that her privacy and dignity would be protected. 

 Shes standing there and she says: Im not wearing this cheap ... bra. Im going naked, Bay said.

 I said: Its PG-13, you have to wear the bra, he said.

 Bay describes The Island ? which carries a PG-13 rating meaning it is suitable for children with parental guidance ? as a summer popcorn movie, though the plot raises important ethical issues about science and the morality of cloning.

 The film by the director of Armageddon and The Rock is a change of direction for Johansson who has played a string of critically acclaimed roles in films such as Girl With a Pearl Earring and In Good Company.

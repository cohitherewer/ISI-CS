 Los Angeles, Dec. 3 (Reuters): Brad Pitt has filed legal papers in Los Angeles to adopt the children of actress Angelina Jolie, news media reported yesterday, adding that this might be a step leading to the couples marrying.

 Life amp; Style magazine said Pitt, 41, has filed to become the legal adopted father of Jolies two children, Maddox, 4, and Zahara, 10 months. They will go by the last name of Jolie-Pitt when the legal steps are completed, the magazine said, quoting a representative for Pitt.

 Jolie, 30, adopted Maddox from Cambodia and Zahara from Ethiopia.

 The ink isnt even dry on the adoption papers, and Brad is literally jumping for joy, the magazine quoted an unnamed insider as saying. Hes calling friends and telling them the great news.

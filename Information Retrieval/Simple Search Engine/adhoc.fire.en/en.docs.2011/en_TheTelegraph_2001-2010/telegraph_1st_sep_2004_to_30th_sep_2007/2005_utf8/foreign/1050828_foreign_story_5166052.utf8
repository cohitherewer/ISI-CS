 Butch buddies to reunite, but not in sequel

 New York, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Robert Redford may soon be reunited on screen with Paul Newman but dont expect a sequel to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or The Sting, which paired one of Hollywoods most popular double acts three decades ago.

 All these years went by and nobody came up with any ideas that were anything but corny and kind of low grade so we just decided probably that wasnt going to happen, Redford said.

 But now theres something rolling around that were talking about it, and the real question is whether he can remember his lines or not, the 68-year-old Redford said in a dig at Newman who turned 80 this year.

 Media reports earlier this year suggested the two would pair up in an adaptation of Bill Brysons travel book A Walk in the Woods, the story of the authors hike through the American wilderness with a friend.

 Redford said he was superstitious about discussing details of projects that were not finalised.

 I think Paul and I are probably alike in that were reluctant to talk about something that is not real yet, but we are talking about it, he told reporters in New York while promoting his new film An Unfinished Life.

 Redford said it was surprising considering Hollywoods penchant for remakes that nothing had come to fruition since the mob and gambling film The Sting in 1973 and the 1969 hit Butch Cassidy, about two bank robbers who flee to Bolivia. 

 Butch was one of the most popular and highest-grossing Westerns ever made. It helped revive the careers of Newman and Redford.

 The stuff that came to us wasnt any good, Redford said. (They said) can you do a sequel to The Sting? No, leave that one alone ... dont try to milk it.

 What about a sequel to Butch Cassidy? Well the guys died in it, what is it going to be, a spiritual film? Well how about a prequel? Thats pretty desperate.

 One film that he is planning a sequel to is The Candidate from 1972, in which he played a Democratic Party candidate for the Senate who has no hope of winning and who finds his ideals compromised by the realities of politics.

 Redford said in the sequel he will play the same character 30 years on, who is now president of the US.

 Right now Im frightened for my country, he said in one of several political asides during a news conference by the actor who makes no secret of his liberal leanings.

 Actors have every right to speak out but they carry more responsibility to know what theyre talking about, he said in an interview, adding that he enjoyed lobbing grenades from a distance.

 But he said he had no intention of stepping into active politics like action star Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is now governor of California.

 I would have to be just consumed with ego and self-absorption. When you enter the political arena its so full of compromise and so full of knots, you tie yourself up, he said.

 New virus linked to Sars affects children

 Washington, Jan. 19 (Reuters): A newly discovered virus related to the Sars virus may cause several mysterious childhood ailments, including Kawasaki disease, US researchers reported yesterday.

 The new virus is a coronavirus, a family of viruses that cause common colds, animal diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome or Sars, a new disease that emerged in China in 2003, killing 800 people globally and causing a worldwide panic before it was contained.

 Two studies in the Journal of Infectious Diseases link this new virus to Kawasaki disease, the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. Jeffrey Kahn and colleagues at Yale University in Connecticut identified what they call the New Haven coronavirus.

 They tested 895 ill children under age 5 who had tested negative for other viral infections.

 They found 79 of them, or 9 per cent, had the New Haven coronavirus. Symptoms included fever, cough, runny nose, rapid breathing, abnormal breath sounds, and low blood oxygen levels.

 And 11 babies infected with the new coronavirus were newborns in intensive care units.

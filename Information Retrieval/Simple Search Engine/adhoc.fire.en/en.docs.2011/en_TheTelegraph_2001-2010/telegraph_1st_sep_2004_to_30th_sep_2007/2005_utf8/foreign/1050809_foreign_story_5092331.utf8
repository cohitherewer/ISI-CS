 New York, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Peter Jennings, prime-time anchorman for ABC News whose career spanned five decades from the Cold War to the war on terrorism, has died of lung cancer, the network said. He was 67.

 The Canadian-born Jennings, host of ABCs World News Tonight since 1983, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. The newsman announced in April he had lung cancer and was beginning chemotherapy. Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace. He knew hed lived a good life, his family said in a statement.

 Jennings was the last of a generation of long-serving lead anchors for major US broadcasters. He was a superb writer, colleague Barbara Walters said in a special broadcast on ABC. She also recalled that no one could ad-lib like Peter.

 Jennings had a 41-year career with ABC, having joined the network in 1964.

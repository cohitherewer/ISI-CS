 Activist beaten up in China

 Beijing, Oct. 5 (Reuters): A blind Chinese activist trying to call attention to forced abortion and other abuses of Chinas one-child policy was beaten and left bleeding on the street, a lawyer and a Washington-based radio station said today.

 Chen Guangcheng, whose whistleblowing in the eastern province of Shandong earlier this year prompted the government to sack and and detain several officials, was found bleeding on a street in his home village of Dongshigu.

 Chen was beaten yesterday after three lawyers arrived in town to meet the activist and negotiate with local officials for lifting the virtual house arrest under which he has been living, Radio Free Asia reported.

 Chen Guangcheng was bleeding from several cuts and injuries to his arms, and also sustained an injury to his leg, the radio service quoted one villager as saying. One of his teeth was loose, too. The government officials refused to take him to seek medical attention, but they sent a doctor to get his blood pressure checked.

 Forget Iraq, focus on economy: Blair

 Sedgefield (England), May 4 (Reuters): On the eve of an election likely to give him an historic third term, Tony Blair appealed to Britons today to swallow misgivings over Iraq and return him to power as a reward for their healthy economy.

 ?Of course there has been disagreement about Iraq,? the Prime Minister said as the US-led war to topple Saddam Hussein again dominated a news conference, his last of the campaign. 

 ?(But) who do people trust with the economy, with the investment in our public services, with the interests of the country? I think we can make a pretty good case of it.? Blair, well ahead in polls, was like his rivals engaged in frenetic last-minute campaign stops round England and Scotland.

 He was then to spend the night in his constituency of Sedgefield, in northeast England, where he will vote after polls open at 0600 GMT tomorrow.

 Blair hopes Britain?s robust economy, which has outperformed its European neighbours during the global downturn of recent years, will be his trump card. Interest rates and unemployment remain low, while growth has been constant. But voters, including many in his own Centre-Left Labour Party, remain deeply uncomfortable with Blair?s backing of President George W. Bush in Iraq.

 Michael Howard, leader of the main Conservative Opposition, accuses Blair of lying over the legality of the war and over intelligence on Saddams weapons of mass destruction. 

 In Sedgefield, an area of old mining towns and picturesque villages where Blair won a huge majority of almost 18,000 in 2001, the father of a soldier killed in Iraq is standing against him as an independent and seeking to garner a protest vote.

 As he knocked on doors, an upbeat Reg Keys said voters were upset over Iraq and responsive to his anti-Blair message.?What we are seeing here are cracks in the foundation of the Labour empire,? he said. ?People want something different.?

 Despite a week of attacks on his integrity, polls put Blair on course for victory, albeit with a likely reduction in his massive 161-seat parliamentary majority.

 The latest survey today gave Labour a commanding 14-point lead on 41 per cent versus the Conservatives on 27. Other recent polls have put Blair between 3 and 10 points ahead. 

 If Blair is celebrating when the results come in on Friday ? which is also his 52nd birthday ? he would be the first Labour leader to win three successive elections.

 Blair, who has said he will step down at the end of a third term, insisted economic stability and investment in health and education would be his domestic priorities. 

 Africa and the environment were his foreign policy priorities, he added. ?I remain passionate about these things.? Blair?s first task on re-election would be to shape a new cabinet. He has already made clear his powerful finance minister and likely successor, Gordon Brown, will remain in his post.

 Analysts believe Blair will step down before he completes a third term ? precipitated, perhaps, if he loses a planned 2006 vote on the EU referendum ? and hand over to Brown.

 Despite his lead, Blair was taking nothing for granted on Wednesday, warning repeatedly that apathy among Labour supporters could scupper him.?Whatever the opinion polls say, in the key seats a few hundred votes or a few thousand votes can determine it either way,? he said.

 To press the point, he began the day in the London seat of Finchley, once political home to Conservative premier Margaret Thatcher and now held narrowly by Labour. 

 When Blair stormed to power in 1997, national turnout was 71 percent, but that slumped to 59 percent in 2001 ? the lowest level since World War One ? and may be even lower this time.

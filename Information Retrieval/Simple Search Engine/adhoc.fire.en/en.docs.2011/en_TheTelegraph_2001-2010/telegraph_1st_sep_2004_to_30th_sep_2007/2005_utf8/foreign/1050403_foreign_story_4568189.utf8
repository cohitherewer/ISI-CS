 Secret-shredder Berger guilty

 Samuel ?Sandy? Berger

 Washington, April 2 (Reuters): Former US national security adviser Samuel ?Sandy? Berger yesterday pleaded guilty to taking classified documents from the National while preparing for an investigation into the September 11 attacks.

 Berger, who served under former President Bill Clinton, pleaded guilty to the misdemeanour in the US district court and will be sentenced on July 8. Under a plea deal, he will not serve jail time but must pay a $10,000 fine.

 Berger, who also agreed to surrender his US government security clearance for three years, was forced to step down as an adviser to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry last summer after reports emerged of the inquiry into the incident.

 He admitted to taking copies of five documents from the National in late 2003 while preparing for testimony before the commission investigating the September 11, 2001 hijacked-airline attacks.

 ?I exercised very poor judgment in the course of reviewing the files,? Berger said outside the courthouse after pleading guilty. ?I deeply regret it. It was mistaken and it was wrong.?

 ?My motivation was to help prepare myself and others,? he said. The plea agreement is subject to approval by magistrate judge Deborah Robinson.

 According to the facts admitted by Berger, who knew he was not authorised to remove classified documents from the archives, he concealed and removed one copy of a document on September 2, 2003, and copies of four others on October 2, 2003.

 He put the documents into his suit pockets to get them out of the archives. He took them to his office and used scissors to destroy three of the copies.

 Berger also admitted to smuggling out handwritten notes from the archives. The notes have since been returned to the government.

 He would not answer questions as to why he decided to destroy three of the documents. One of his associates said he decided to cut up the documents when he realised they were very similar.

 Noel Hillman, chief of the Public Integrity Section at the department of justice, noted that Berger had only taken copies of the documents and said the originals were always in the government?s possession.

 ?We have determined that no documents, no information was lost to the public or lost to the 9/11 Commission,? Hillman said after the hearing.

 The criminal investigation of Berger began in October 2003 but only came to light last July, prompting a partisan fight at a crucial stage of the presidential election campaign.

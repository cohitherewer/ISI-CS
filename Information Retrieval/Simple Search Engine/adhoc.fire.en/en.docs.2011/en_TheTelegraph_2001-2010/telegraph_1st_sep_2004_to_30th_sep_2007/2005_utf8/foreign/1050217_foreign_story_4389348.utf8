 Prince saddles up for last hunt

 London, Feb. 16: The Prince of Wales went hunting for what, in all likelihood, will be his last time before a ban comes into force on Friday.

 He chose to ride with one of his favourite packs in the Derbyshire Peak District, and then stopped off for a drink with other huntgoers at the Blue Bell pub in Tissington, near Ashbourne.

 As he left, he managed a smile despite the ban meaning he can no longer indulge his great passion for hunting. Although others may saddle up in the future, the issue is too controversial for the prince to be seen in the field after the ban.

 With his diary packed with public and private engagements today and tomorrow, it seems unlikely he will have the chance to hunt again. He is a huge supporter of hunting although political sensitivities prevent him from speaking on the subject. But, when plans for legislation were announced, his aides made it known he would give up the sport ?with much sadness?.

 His fiancee, Camilla Parker Bowles has let her feelings be known in the past by driving a car with a pro-hunting sticker on the back windscreen.

 The last chance to stop the ban disappeared today when pro-hunt activists lost a legal appeal. A court comprising three of Britain?s top judges dismissed an appeal that the law used to push the ban through parliament was invalid.

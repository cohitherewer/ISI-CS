 Rice warning on China ban

 Beijing, March 21 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice warned today that EU plans to lift an embargo on arms sales to China might alter the military balance in Asia, where the US stations armed forces.

 Washington has long opposed the plan to lift the arms ban, but Rice?s comments come one week after China passed an anti-secession law that allows the use of military force against Taiwan, heightening US fears.

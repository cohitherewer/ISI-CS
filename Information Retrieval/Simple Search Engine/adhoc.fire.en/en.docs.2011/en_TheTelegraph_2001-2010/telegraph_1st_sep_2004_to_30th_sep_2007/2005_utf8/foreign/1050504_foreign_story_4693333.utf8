 Britons blog to vent their anger

 London, May 3 (Reuters): 

 Once Britons wanting to vent their political spleen either 

 had to write to the Times or take their soapbox to 

 Speakers Corner in London?s Hyde Park for a rant. 

 Now they can blog.

 The campaign for the May 5 election has witnessed an explosion of web logs ? ?blogs? ? from candidates to journalists and political snipers tearing chunks out of the bombast pouring out of party media machines.

 ?I think this is probably the most interesting phenomenon of this election,? said Stephen Coleman of the Oxford Internet Institute.

 ?The key thing about blogs is that they are grass roots and somewhat subterranean,? he said. ?The party websites are extremely technocratic and centralised. The blogs are more what people were hoping would come out of the Internet.?

 All the parties come in for criticism, from Prime Minister Tony Blairs Labour and the Conservatives ? ?Tories? as they are often called ? to the Liberal Democrats. 

 ?It?s a pity that the Tories and Lib Dems are adopting the approach of calling the Prime Minister a liar ... The words ?pot calling the kettle black? spring to mind,? said one message.

 Activists decry hawk?s choice

 Washington, March 17 (Reuters): Development activists yesterday decried the Bush administration?s choice of Iraq war architect Paul Wolfowitz to lead the World Bank, although some analysts said he might bring needed toughness to the job.

 Wolfowitz, number two at the Pentagon, is a divisive figure in Europe and West Asia for helping shape the Iraq war. Some said the US choice, coming on the heels of the appointment of hawk John Bolton as UN ambassador, highlighted White House contempt for international diplomacy. 

 ?If the Bush administration wanted to poke a finger into the eye of every nation on Earth, it couldn?t have made a better choice,? said John Cavanagh, director of the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank.

 ?Wolfowitz does not have an interest or knowledge about poverty and development problems. With him at the helm, the bank will be seen more and more as a tool of US foreign policy, not a multilateral institution,? wrote Alex Wilks, a Brussels-based activist whose website (www.worldbankpresident.org) tracked speculation over the presidency.

 Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs also criticised Wolfowitz?s lack of development mileage. ?We need someone with professional experience in helping people to escape from poverty. Wolfowitz does not have that track record. We need other nominees,? he told CNN. Still, other analysts said Wolfowitz?s years as a Johns Hopkins University dean and as US ambassador to Indonesia worked in his favour.

 ?I honestly think he is going to surprise people and turn out to be quite effective,? said Peter Timmer, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, who served on academic committees with Wolfowitz and worked in Indonesia during his ambassadorship there. John Stremlau, head of the international relations department at Johannesburg?s University of the Witwatersrand, called Wolfowitz a good pick even though his nomination could ?rub people the wrong way.?

 ?He could be a lot better than the initial reaction to the labels that have been attached to him,? he said. ?He could prove over time to be a very important and good leader of the World Bank.?

 Traditionally, the US gets to pick the World Bank president while Europe selects the International Monetary Funds head. The bank?s board must sign off on Washington?s choice, leaving room for a dispute over his appointment.

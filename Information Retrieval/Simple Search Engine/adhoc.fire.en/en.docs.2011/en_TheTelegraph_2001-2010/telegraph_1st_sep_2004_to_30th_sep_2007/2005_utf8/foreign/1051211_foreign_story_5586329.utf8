 Clinton steals the show

 and George Bush

 Washington, Dec. 10: Bill Clinton is no longer US President, but judging by his sudden appearance at a UN Climate Change Conference, it is he ? not his successor George W. Bush ? who is determining US policy on the ground on environment. 

 His aberration assumes significance as Bush, burdened by Iraq and mounting scandals of corruption and wrong-doing in the Republican Party and his administration, is becoming a lame-duck and Senator Hillary Clinton, the former First Lady, is emerging as an undeclared presidential candidate for 2008.

 Yesterday, as Clinton made an eleventh hour appearance at the fortnight-long UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Montreal to save it from collapse, the global disdain for the Bush administrations policies scaled new heights because it is unprecedented for a former US President to slam his successor, that too on foreign soil.

 Clinton stole the show at the conference attended by environment ministers and 10,000 delegates from 180 countries and received a long, standing ovation after he told them that the Bush administration was flat wrong to reject the Kyoto Protocol.

 There is no longer any serious doubt that climate change is real, accelerating, and caused by human activities, Clinton told the conference, adding the earth was literally a biological miracle... it is crazy for us to play games with our childrens future.

 Clinton was invited by Montreal City and the Canadian branch of the environment group, the Sierra Club, in the final hours of the UNFCCC meeting.

 The official US delegation was said to be deeply unhappy with the invitation and in order to quell speculation that the team tried to block Clintons appearance, the delegation issued a statement asserting that it encouraged stakeholder presentations like the one by the former President on behalf of organisations like the Sierra Club. 

 The US delegation, which walked out of the talks on the penultimate day of the conference, was further irritated when Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin said at a press conference: To the reticent nations, including the US, I say there is such a thing as a global conscience, and now is the time to listen to it.

 Jakarta seeks help on rebellion

 Jakarta, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has asked six nations, including the US and Britain, for advice on how to resolve a simmering separatist rebellion in tsunami-devastated Aceh province.

 Yudhoyono met ambassadors from the US, Britain, Japan, Singapore, Sweden and Libya today to hear their views on the long-running conflict between the government and the separatist GAM (Free Aceh Movement).

 For three decades the province on the northern tip of Sumatra ? where almost all Indonesia?s 104,000 deaths from the December 26 tsunami occurred ? has been the site of repeated clashes between the groups that have killed at least 12,000.

 Both sides made conciliatory gestures after the tsunami but have since accused one another of initiating several clashes

 Despite Yudhoyono?s meetings today, the government was adamant that the conflict remained a domestic issue and not an international problem. 

 GAM has been fighting for independence, but the government says it would offer only significant autonomy.

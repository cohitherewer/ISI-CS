 London top cop sticks to his guns

 Ian Blair: Not guilty?

 London, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Londons police chief today defended his handling of the fatal shooting of a Brazilian electrician by his officers, insisting he had still believed the dead man was a suicide bomber 24 hours after the killing.

 Ian Blair, Britains most senior policeman, has come under heavy pressure over the July 22 killing of 27-year-old Jean Charles de Menezes on an underground train.

 Leaked documents from the investigation into the case have exposed blunders and cast doubt on initial accounts from police and witnesses. The shooting took place with the capital on edge, the day after a failed attempt to repeat suicide bombings which killed 52 people on July 7.

 At that time ? and for the next 24 hours ? I and everybody who advised me believed the person who was shot was a suicide bomber, Blair told the News of the World newspaper.

 Relatives of de Menezes have called on Blair to quit because of information they say was misleading. 

 Blair said it was not until the morning after the shooting that he was informed an innocent man had been killed. Somebody came in at 10:30 am and said the equivalent of Houston, we have a problem, he said. I thought: Thats dreadful. What are we going to do about that? 

 But lawyers for the de Menezes family have voiced doubts that senior officers did not know the truth soon after the shooting. We express incredulity that senior police officers would have made extravagant claims from the outset without first informing themselves of the true facts, lawyer Gareth Pierce said.

 Ministers said an independent inquiry must be allowed to proceed without prejudgment. It was a terrible tragedy that that young lad was killed but ... an independent inquiry is underway. Let us wait for the facts, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said.

 Tango then, tempers now

 Aulnay-sous-Bois, France, Nov 6 (Reuters): Down past the burned-out delivery vans, between scruffy trees and high-rises with rusting balconies, stands a firebombed municipal social club. They used to teach tango and jazz dance here.

 Further along, charred patches on the street mark the places where other cars were torched and then towed away. Shoppers hesitate before a supermarket with shattered glass doors. On the edge of town, acrid smoke rises from a smouldering carpet depot. 

 After more than a week of nightly violence, the rundown northeastern Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois is a jumble of frayed nerves and flaring tempers. Residents are fed up with rioters upsetting their homes, lives and dreams.

 My kids cant sleep at night, says a mother who only gives her name as Samia. They hear explosions, they see fires and they think theyre in a war. When the slightest thing happens, they get anxious

 But if the politicians are at a loss for a coherent response to the unrest ? now spreading from Pariss suburbs to other cities ? many of the inhabitants and even the rioters themselves seem similarly trapped between anger and despair.

 Henri Huynh, who came here from Vietnam in 1969, sighs in resignation at the sight of the firebombed social club. Thats where we used to have our dancing lessons. 

 Only minutes later, hes screaming as young men turn up a boom box to blast rap music at the towns silent march against violence as it passes. Stop that now! Stop that provocation! he yells. The grinning youngsters ignore him.

 Just off the highway linking Paris and its Charles de Gaulle airport, Aulnay-sous-Bois is one of many dreary suburbs where young French of Arab and African origin grow up feeling they have No Future tattooed on their foreheads.

 As in many suburbs, unemployment is significantly higher than the national average of about 10 per cent. In the rougher estates, it probably reaches 30-40 per cent or more, feeding a widespread sense theres not much residents can do to get ahead. 

 Even if you have a university degree, in the end all they give you is a broom, hisses an Algerian cafe owner.

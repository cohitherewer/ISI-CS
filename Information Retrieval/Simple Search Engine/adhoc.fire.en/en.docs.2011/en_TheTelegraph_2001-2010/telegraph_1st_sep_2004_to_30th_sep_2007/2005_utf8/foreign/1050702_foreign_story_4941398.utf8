 Chile sight on space collision

 Santiago, July 1 (Reuters): Chile is gearing up to be the eyes of the world as astronomers converge on the telescopes and clear skies of the northern Andes to witness a collision in outer space between a comet and a Nasa probe.

 Nasa scientists plan to slam a tiny spacecraft into a comet half the size of Manhattan on July 4 in a collision aimed at discovering the building blocks of life on Earth, and investigators say Chile is the best place to watch it from.

 Around 10 specialists on comets in the solar system have arrived in Chile in recent days from Germany, the US, France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, French astronomer Olivier Marco said.

 Chile is very well positioned because we have the worlds most powerful observatories there which will follow the collision before, during and after it happens, said Marco, of the European Southern Observatory ? an organisation with 11 member countries that conducts astronomical research and operates observatories in Chile.

 The July 4 mission, known as Deep Impact, aims to uncover and photograph pristine material formed billions of years ago during the creation of the solar system by blasting a crater the size of a football stadium into comet Tempel 1.

 Comets are composed of ice, gas and dust from the solar systems farthest and coldest regions. They often show bursts of activity, during which parts of their crusty surfaces lift off to create fan-shaped jets of dust.

 They are also carriers of basic chemical building blocks for allowing life to occur, Rick Gremmier, project manager for the Nasa mission, said

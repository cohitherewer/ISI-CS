 Sabotage blackout in Pak province

 Quetta, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Suspected tribal militants blew up a major electricity transmission line in Pakistan?s troubled Baluchistan overnight, suspending power supplies to many parts of the province, officials said today.

 The attack, the second on the electricity installations in Baluchistan in less than a week, was the latest in a series of assaults on state infrastructure in the southwestern province blamed on tribal militants seeking greater autonomy.

 The attackers blew up two electricity pylons late yesterday near Sibi district, about 100 km southeast of provincial capital Quetta, suspending power to two thirds of the districts of Baluchistan province, including Quetta.

 ?The bombs were planted at the bases of the towers,? said Jibrail Khan, a spokesman for Quetta Electric Supply Co, a state-run regional power utility.

 He said authorities had restored electricity to parts of Quetta by using an alternate distribution system but it would take at least two weeks to repair the damaged transmission line. On Saturday, three power pylons were blown up in Nasirabad district. Yesterday?s attack came hours after a tribal militant was killed when a bomb he was carrying exploded prematurely in Quetta.

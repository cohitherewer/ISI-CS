 Pak sends task force

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Jan. 3: Pakistan today dispatched a task force to help in relief efforts in tsunami-hit Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

 Two military C-130 transport aircraft, two naval ships and three helicopters left for the two countries carrying a fleet of doctors, paramedics and army engineers to assist in international relief efforts.

 ?The first task force to Indonesia will set up a 50-bed field hospital fully capable of providing medical assistance to the survivors,? military spokesman Major General General Shaukat Sultan said.

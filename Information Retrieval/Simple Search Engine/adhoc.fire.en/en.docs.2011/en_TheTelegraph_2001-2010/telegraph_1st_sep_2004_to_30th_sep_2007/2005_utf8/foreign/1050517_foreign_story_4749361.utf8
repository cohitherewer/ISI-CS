 Blair asks minister to work for no pay

 ANDREW SPARROW

 London, May 16: Tony Blair was accused of sexism yesterday after it emerged that he has asked the new minister for women to do the job unpaid.

 Meg Munn, whose appointment was only announced at the weekend, cannot claim a ministerial salary because the Prime Minister had already used up his allocation of paid jobs when he invited her to join the government.

 Downing Street denied that Munn was appointed late because Blair forgot about the need to have a junior minister for women in his team. But a spokesman was unable to offer any other explanation for her not being included in the full list of appointments released last Tuesday. Only 109 ministerial salaries can be paid at any time.

 It means that the Sheffield Heeley MP, who chaired the Womens Parliamentary Labour Party in the last parliament, cannot have her ?59,000 backbenchers salary boosted to the ?88,000 received by other junior ministers.

 Eleanor Laing, the shadow minister for women, said Munn had been given an important job, but Blair had made it impossible for her to be taken seriously.

 She asked: How can Meg Munn stand up in the House of Commons and argue for equal pay for women when shes not being paid the same as her ministerial colleagues? This is an insult to women.

 Munn will work in the department for trade and industry, which was renamed the department for productivity, energy and industry after the election but given back its former title a few days later after the new name was ridiculed.

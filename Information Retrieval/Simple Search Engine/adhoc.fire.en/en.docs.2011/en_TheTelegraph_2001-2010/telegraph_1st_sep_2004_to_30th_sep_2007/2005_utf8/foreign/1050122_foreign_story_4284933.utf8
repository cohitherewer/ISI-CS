 Veterans seek Zhao honours

 Beijing, Jan. 21 (Reuters): A group of veteran China Communist Party members has urged the leadership to assure proper funeral honours for Zhao Ziyang, purged as party chief in 1989 for sympathising with the Tiananmen Square democracy protests.

 The move by some veterans to request a memorial service rather than a scaled-down ceremony exposes differences between liberal party elders eager to ensure due respect for a man who once headed the party and his successors nervous that publicity could spark protests.

 The authorities have offered Zhao?s family a ceremony to bid farewell to his remains, one notch below a memorial service in Communist protocol, giving as their reason that the party has simplified funerals for leaders in recent years.

 No date has been set for Zhao?s funeral.

 The size and timing of the event remained unclear. It was also not known how widely any funeral would be covered by China?s state media, which have played down Zhao?s death this week for fear of triggering a popular outpouring of sentiment.

 ?He was Premier for two terms and general secretary of the party. A memorial service befitting a national leader should be held,? Di Sha, 75, a liberal former reporter of the official China Youth Daily, said today.

 ?This is the wish of many old comrades,? said Di, wife of Hu Jiwei, reform-minded editor-in-chief of the People?s Daily, mouthpiece of the party, from 1977 to 1983.

 Zhao, who died on Monday aged 85, was deposed for opposing a decision to use troops and tanks to clear Tiananmen Square of protesters on June 3-4, 1989. He spent the last 15 years of his life under house arrest in his Beijing courtyard home.

 Flower girl crosses royal path

 CAROLINE DAVIES 

 Jasper, May 23: When you are two years old, waiting patiently for Queen Elizabeth can be a tiresome business. Brynn Noble had been given a flower to present to the queen who was attending Sunday service in a mountain town in the Canadian Rockies.

 As the smiling monarch walked slowly out of St Mary and St Georges Anglican church in Jasper yesterday, Brynn decided enough was enough. She toddled into the queens path, and lay down.

 The queen, accompanied by the Rt Rev Victoria Matthews, the first female bishop to lead the queen in a church service, was forced to step around her, while Prince Philip roared with laughter behind.

 Unfazed, little Brynn continued to roll at the queens feet, before finally sticking her tongue out and scampering back to her parents, Maggie and Todd.

 We told her to wait for the queen and she had hold of a flower for her, said her mother. But she decided to break free from the crowd and just lay down to wait. The queen seemed to think it was very amusing.

 Brynns encounter took place as the queen enjoyed a private two-day break in the vast wilderness of Canadas Jasper National Park, midway through her nine-day tour of Canada.

 With elks, wolves and bears roaming freely around its glittering lakes and dense forest, it was a spot that had enchanted her parents on their cross-Canada tour 66 years ago.

 Although she was staying in a rustic lakeside cabin, she was hardly roughing it. The Outlook Cabin at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge is among the most luxurious accommodation in Canada.

 It is built on the spot of the original Outlook Cabin, where her parents stayed during their 1939 Canadian tour, the first by a reigning monarch, and a journey that endeared the country to the late Queen Mother.

 That cabin was destroyed by fire in 2000 but was rebuilt, at a cost exceeding ?1 million a year later. 

 The ?2,000-a-night cabin is set deep in woodland and has six bedrooms. Decorated with Italian marble and native granite, it is one of the hotels signature cabins, whose occupants have included Bing Crosby, Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe, who filmed River of no Return in Jasper.

 The church service was the only glimpse Jaspers 4,600 residents had of their royal visitor, and provided the first opportunity for the supreme governor of the Church of England to be led in prayers by a female bishop.

 As Canadas first woman bishop, Matthews, the Anglican Bishop of Edmonton, Alberta, confessed she was a little nervous and confided that she had once met Prince Philip on a previous royal visit to Canada when she was 15.

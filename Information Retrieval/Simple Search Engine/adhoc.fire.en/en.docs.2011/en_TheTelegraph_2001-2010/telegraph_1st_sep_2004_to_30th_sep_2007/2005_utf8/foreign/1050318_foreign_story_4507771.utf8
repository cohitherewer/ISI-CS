 Mafia-style attack on Russia reform architect

 Anatoly Chubais

 Moscow, March 17 (Reuters): Anatoly Chubais, head of Russia?s state power monopoly, survived an assassination attempt today by assailants who detonated a roadside bomb and sprayed his convoy with automatic gunfire.

 The 49-year-old Chubais, one of Russia?s best-known figures, came to prominence as the architect of post-Soviet economic reforms under which two dozen ?oligarchs? acquired vast wealth while ordinary people suffered a huge slump in living standards.

 He is now chief executive of Unified Energy System, and the prime mover behind reforms to introduce competition to the power sector.

 Chubais told a hastily arranged press briefing that he had been aware of a plan to kill him, but would not say who he suspected of carrying out the attack. ?I have an idea of who could have taken out a contract on me,? a shaken but defiant Chubais said from the safety of UES headquarters in Moscow. ?We had reason to believe something like this might happen.? 

 Chubais was travelling to work from his country home along a narrow stretch of the Minsk Highway at 0630 GMT when a roadside bomb rocked his two-car cortege and attackers opened fire with automatic weapons.

 Chubais said his armoured BMW had been able to flee the scene despite being hit in the windscreen, hood and front tyre. Security guards for Chubais travelling in a Mitsubishi Lancer returned fire at two hitmen, who escaped into the surrounding woods. Police said they had found a green Saab they believe was used as a getaway car by the would-be assassins.

 The bomb blast had a force equivalent to at least 500g of TNT, investigators said. Television footage from the scene showed a large crater at the side of the two-lane highway. Chubais, a leader of the Union of Right Forces party, quit active politics in 1998 to take over UES. He was ranked in a recent opinion poll as Russia?s most influential businessman.

 The tough-talking economist was a leading member of the ?young reformers? close to former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and architect of a 1990s privatisation drive which led to vast wealth being concentrated in very few hands. Critics accused Chubais of launching an era of ?wild capitalism? when killings became a widely used method to acquire control of businesses.

 Clash amp; calm in France

 Paris, Nov. 13 (Reuters): France banned large gatherings in Lyon today after security forces clashed with youths in the countrys second city, but police said violence was waning in other areas under emergency measures such as curfews.

 Regional authorities imposed the central Lyon ban after police used tear gas on Saturday to break up the first disturbances in any city centre since frustrated youths began rioting in Frances impoverished suburbs on October 27.

 A fire bomb was also thrown at a mosque in Lyon, a city of 1.2 million people, but did not explode, police said.

 The ban on rallies was imposed until 7 pm (1800 GMT) on Sunday and a curfew on minors was due to go into force from 10 pm until 6 am for the second consecutive night.

 It is not clear why unrest has worsened only now in Lyon. But, like Paris, it has poor and dreary neighbourhoods and violence has erupted before in its suburbs.

 The intensity of unrest elsewhere has weakened since the government adopted emergency measures last Tuesday to crack down on violence by youngsters frustrated by unemployment, racism, harsh police treatment and a lack of opportunities.

 Cars set ablaze in France were down by a quarter on the previous night and fears that violence would grip central Paris proved unfounded after rallies were banned in the capital. 

 Things could calm down very, very quickly, national police service chief Michel Gaudin told reporters in Paris.

 He said the number of cars set ablaze during the night had fallen to 374 from 502 the previous night.

 The weekend had been widely seen as a test of the success of the governments crackdown on the most widespread violence since student and worker protests in May 1968.

 Thousands of police patrolled Paris and a ban was placed on any gathering in the city that could cause trouble. There was no unrest in the heart of the city despite messages on Internet sites and SMS messages which police said had called for unrest.

 Asked about the situation in the suburbs outside Paris one youth said: The situation cannot continue like this. So lets hope there will be some change.

 President Jacques Chiracs government is due to consider on Monday whether to prepare a draft law extending the measures, imposed for 12 days on October 8 to curb rioters who include white youths as well as youngsters of Arab and African origin.

 Interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy iterated a controversial pledge to throw out foreigners caught rioting, saying the expulsions could begin this week.

 Muslim hope

 Jakarta/Cairo, April 20 (Reuters): Muslim leaders today urged the new Pope to follow in the path of his predecessor by building bridges between the two religions and helping to avoid religious bloodshed.

 But officials and intellectuals in the Arab world also said they wanted to see Pope Benedict XVI use his influence to help bring an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Conservative German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who succeeded Pope John Paul II as leader of the Roman Catholic church yesterday, takes over at a time when tensions between traditionally Christian countries and the Islamic world are running high.

 ?I hope the new Pope will follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and try to bring peace in the world,? said Hafiz Hussain Ahmed, a Pakistani Islamic cleric and politician. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi of mainly Muslim Malaysia said he hoped the Islamic world would work with the new Pope and ?engender greater trust and lasting peace between the faithful of all the world?s religions?. Arab officials called on the new Pope to continue to work for understanding but also called for papal efforts to establish a Palestinian state.

 ?We also hope he will continue to call for giving the Palestinian people their right to establish their own state,? Yemeni deputy foreign minister Mustafa Noman said.

 An Egyptian Coptic Christian intellectual said the Pope could work for compromise on the issue of Jerusalem, which both Palestinians and Israelis want as a capital.

 Chandrika relents on relief pact with Tigers

 Kumaratunga: Under pressure

 Colombo, June 10: Under pressure from coalition partners and the Opposition, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga today said she would sign a proposed tsunami aid agreement with the Tamil Tigers only after consulting the powerful Buddhist clergy. 

 In a special letter to senior Buddhist monks, Kumaratunga assured them that she would not sign the deal on the $3 billion aid package without consulting the monks first.

 Today, riot police fired tear gas and water cannons to break up a protest by Buddhist monks. Around 200 chanting monks had gathered near Kumaratungas palace in Colombo to hand over a letter urging her to give up the pact.

 The protests came after Kumaratungas recent announcement that she would sign an agreement with the Tigers for distribution of tsunami aid in areas that are under their control.

 Kumaratungas key coalition partner, the Janatha Vimukhti Peramuna (JVP), which has 39 seats in Parliament and is crucial for her governments survival, has threatened to pull out of the ruling alliance if she goes ahead with the proposed agreement.

 However, the Presidents main threat comes from the Buddhist clergy ? the Maha Sangha, which is the highest religious body in Sri Lanka and one of the most politically influential. It has strongly opposed the agreement.

 One of Sri Lankas most revered religious leaders, Omalpe Sobhitha, has gone on a hunger strike since Monday in Kandy over the issue. 

 Kumaratungas letter assuring the monks they would be consulted before any pact was sent with the minister for advanced technology, Rohitha Bogollagama, to the Maha Sangha in Kandy.

 The Maha Sangha had earlier threatened to organise its followers against the government.

 The President hosted a dinner for Indian foreign minister Natwar Singh tonight and discussed, among other things, the developments in her country. This morning Singh also met Prime Minister Mahendra Rajapakshe and had lunch with foreign minister Lakshman Khadirgamar.

 Natwar Singh will meet Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and the JVP leadership tomorrow. It is not clear to what extent India is willing to get involved in the developments in Colombo, which Delhi has described as Sri Lankas internal affairs.

 But Singhs presence itself has brought some relief to the government.

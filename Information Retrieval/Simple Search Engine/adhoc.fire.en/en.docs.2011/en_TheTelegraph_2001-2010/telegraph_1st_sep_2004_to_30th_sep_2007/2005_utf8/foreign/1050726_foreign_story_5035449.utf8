 Shuttle set for launch despite flaw

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), July 25 (Reuters): Nasa is prepared to launch its first space shuttle mission since the Columbia accident two-and-a-half years ago even if a technical glitch that grounded Discovery on July 13 reoccurs, the US space agency said yesterday.

 The launch of Discovery is scheduled for 1439 GMT tomorrow, and is under intense scrutiny because of safety upgrades and other changes implemented after Columbia fell apart over Texas in February 2003, killing seven astronauts.

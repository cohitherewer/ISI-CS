 Actor gender bender

 Los Angeles, Dec. 6 (Reuters): It is not easy being a woman portraying a man who is really a woman.

 Ask Felicity Huffman, star of hit television show Desperate Housewives, who breaks out of her acting mould to play a transgender character in low-budget comedy movie Transamerica. Huffman had to train, toil and suffer for her craft just to portray ? a woman. Sounds simple, but it was not.

 Huffman plays Bree, a woman who until recently was a man named Stanley. One week before surgery to become Bree, Stanley discovered that he had fathered a son who desperately needs him now. The transformation of Huffman from Stanley into Bree has critics raving, Oscar tongues wagging and filmmakers hoping Transamerica can reach beyond limited gay and arthouse audiences into family-minded America.

 We made this movie for $2, and on a low budget youre always behind schedule. But when it wasnt right, physically, emotionally, externally, Duncan (the director) would say: Im sorry, weve got to do that again, Huffman said. Huffman, who turns 43 on December 10, shakes her blonde hair and lets out a scream.

 Duncan Tucker, sitting next to Huffman in a Beverly Hills hotel, sheepishly adds: I do remember we played with your walk in a few scenes.

 Men dressed as women, and women as men is nothing new. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis did it with aplomb in 1959s Some Like it Hot. But Huffmans mindset, voice, walk and manner had to make audiences believe she is both Stanley and Bree. That is something new. And while some ? including Huffman ? told Tucker he was crazy hiring a woman to play a man playing a woman, he never saw it that way and wanted no other actress.

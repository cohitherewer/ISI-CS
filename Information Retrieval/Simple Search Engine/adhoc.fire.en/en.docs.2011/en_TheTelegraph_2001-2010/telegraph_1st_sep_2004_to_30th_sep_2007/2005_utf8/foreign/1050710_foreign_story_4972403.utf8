 Cage to star in 9/11 movie

 - Dramatic events to come alive on celluloid

 Nicolas Cage

 Los Angeles, July 9 (Reuters): Nicolas Cage will star as a real-life policeman who survived the collapse of the World Trade Center in what would be one of Hollywoods first films to dramatise the September 11 attacks on America, Paramount Pictures said yesterday.

 Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone is on board to direct the untitled movie, which centres on the story of the last two men ? a pair of Port Authority police officers ? rescued from the rubble of the twin towers, Paramount said.

 The two officers, Sergeant John McLoughlin and William Jimeno, sold their life rights to the studio, providing the basis for the original screenplay by relative newcomer Andrea Berloff. Cage, who won an Academy Award for Leaving Las Vegas, will play McLoughlin. 

 No other casting decisions have been made, Paramount said. The Viacom Inc.-owned studio has given producers the go-ahead to begin work on the film, getting an apparent leg up on another 9/11 feature in development at rival studio Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp.

 Columbia announced in February it had optioned screen rights to 102 Minutes, a book by two New York Times reporters chronicling the interval between the crash of the first hijacked airliner into the World Trade Center and the collapse of the first tower. No director or actors have been signed to the 102 Minutes project.

 Word that Paramount had a film in the works dramatising the 9/11 attacks came a day after London was rocked by a series of deadly bomb blasts that renewed anxieties about terror threats.

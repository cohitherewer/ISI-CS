 Iglesias land deal sparks row

 Iglesias

Valencia, March 13: Julio Iglesias, Spain?s singing superstar, has a reputation as the housewives? favourite ? except, that is, among villagers on the Costa Blanca, who accuse the crooner of exploiting Valencia?s controversial ?land-grab? laws to build a development worth an estimated ?370 million.

 Reputed to be worth ?550 million, Iglesias has a near 50 per cent stake in a property company that is planning to build 1,500 villas and a golf course on unspoilt land belonging to poor farmers in the mountains near the resort of Benidorm.

 The plan has prompted fury among 

 locals of Benichembla, which numbers 120 British expatriates 

 among its population of 350. Villagers accuse the mayor, 

 Aurelio Llinares, of signing a secret deal with the developers 

 and are campaigning for his resignation. Valencia?s controversial 

 laws, passed in 1994, were aimed at speeding up urban development 

 but were poorly drafted, enabling some unscrupulous property 

 developers to ask for land to be reclassified.

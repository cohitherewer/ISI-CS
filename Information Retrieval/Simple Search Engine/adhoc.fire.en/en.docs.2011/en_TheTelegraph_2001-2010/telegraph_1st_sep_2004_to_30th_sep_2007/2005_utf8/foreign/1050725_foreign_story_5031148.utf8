 Kathmandu, July 24 (Reuters): At least two dozen people were injured today when supporters of sacked Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba clashed with police when he appeared before an anti-graft body hearing corruption charges, witnesses said.

 Police used batons to push back about 200 activists of the Nepali Congress Party protesting against the anti-graft body, demanding it be abolished as it was illegal.

 The protesters, some of them carrying placards, threw stones and bricks at the heavy security cordon as Deuba arrived for the hearing at the office of the Royal Commission for Corruption Control, which is investigating charges of graft against him.

 Deuba is innocent and he must be freed, read a placard.

 The sacked Premier and Prakash Man Singh, a minister in the ousted cabinet, are in police custody since April. They have been accused of embezzling $5.3 million while awarding the contract for a section of a $464-million water supply project.

 The scheme funded by foreign donors, including the Asian Development Bank and Japan, is aimed at enhancing the supply of drinking water to Kathmandu.

 Deuba and Singh deny any wrongdoing and have refused to appoint lawyers saying the anti-graft body was illegally set up by King Gyanendra, who seized power in February.

 The hearing, which has been postponed several times in the past, was not completed and will resume tomorrow, officials said.

 Deuba was under house arrest for several weeks after February 1 and was arrested in the middle of the night in April by the anti-graft body.

 The king formed the commission with sweeping powers to arrest and jail corrupt bureaucrats and politicians.

 Four other people, three officials and a contractor, are also facing similar charges.

 In July, the same panel cleared Deuba and six other ministers in his sacked cabinet for distributing $54,000 to party workers during the festival of dasain in October.

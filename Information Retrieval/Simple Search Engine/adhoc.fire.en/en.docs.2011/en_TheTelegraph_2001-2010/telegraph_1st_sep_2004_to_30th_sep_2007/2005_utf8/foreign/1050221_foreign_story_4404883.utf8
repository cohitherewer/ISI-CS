 Chinese leave Guinness gasping

 Hong Kong, Feb. 20: China is a country of excess. It has the world?s largest population (1.3 billion), the biggest army

 reserve (206 million), the longest wall (2,150 miles) and carries out more executions than anywhere else on earth (1,750 a year). 

 Now its people ? driven by their innate competitiveness, and the appointment of the first Guinness World Records liaison officer in China ? are laying claim to a host of new titles: the world?s oldest opera singer (93 years old), for example, and the longest karaoke session (100 hours). 

 For five decades of strict Communism, the pursuit of individual glory was frowned upon. Now, a craze for record-breaking is sweeping the nation. Annual sales of the Guinness book have risen to 30,000 copies since it was first published in Mandarin in the late 1990s. 

 Wu Xiaohong, 36, a former university lecturer, and her four-strong team of assistants trawl the country to collect and verify the record attempts. From their office in the northern city of Shenyang, they travel thousands of miles a year to monitor often bizarre feats.

 Last year alone, 20 new records were confirmed or certified, including the tallest building made of flowers, at 23.26 metres, and the largest piece of bean curd, weighing 3,120kg. China?s entries in the 2005 record book rose by one-fifth to more than 100.

 In her first days in the job, Wu recalled, an 80-year-old man turned up at her office after a 10-hour train journey, demanding that she let him demonstrate how he could stand on his head for more than a minute. 

 ?We told him straight away we couldn?t accept his record attempt because it was dangerous to his health, but he wouldn?t listen. He insisted on putting on a show for us,? she said. ?We were terribly worried. At last we managed to persuade him to leave, telling him we would contact Guinness and get back in touch with him. We later sent him a letter explaining why we couldn?t accept his record attempt. He seemed happy with that.?

 China still lags far behind America and Britain, which have dominated the record book since it was launched in 1955, but Laura McTurk, a spokeswoman for Guinness World Records in London, said that China was now in the top 10 and rising.

 Wu said: ?We have so many people, and we can organise many people to break records ? like the 10,000 children who recently brushed their teeth simultaneously in Shenzhen. This country has so much potential.?

 For every new record claim from China accepted by Guinness World Records in London, 10 are rejected and 100 more will never be passed on by Wu in the first place.

 Among the heroic failures are a 35-year-old labourer from Hubei, who walked 100 metres wearing iron shoes weighing more than 100kg each at a Guinness-organised event in Beijing. The record was too specific, and he was probably the only person who could wear the shoes, Guinness judged.

 There was no glory either for Xie Longbang, 35, from Xinjiang, who can wiggle his ears for four hours non-stop at a rate of four wiggles per second, or for Liu Kemin, from Nanchang, who can blow 80 smoke rings from one puff of a cigarette.

 Successful record-breakers, however, include a taxi driver from Shenyang, Zhao Guang, 40, who had nearly driven his wife to divorce because of his habit of spinning a basketball on one finger for hours on end. ?He could do it for nearly four hours without stopping,? said Wu.

 ?Before he found out about the book of records, he used to do it just for fun. Then he contacted us and we set up an event for him. When he became an official record-holder, he was thrilled.

 ?The certificate we presented to him changed his life. He is more content than ever before and has been on television to show off his ability. I think even his wife is a little bit more happy.?

 Wu believed that the passion for setting records was a sign of China?s growing prosperity. ?As Chinese people live more comfortable lives, they have more time to do things they like. They have the time to live out their dreams,? she said.

 Among the hopefuls seeking recognition in the next edition are Jiang Mingsheng, 66, from Nanjing, who can clap at 106.9 decibels, and the owner of a hen in Dongguan, which laid an egg weighing 400g. The hen died laying it.

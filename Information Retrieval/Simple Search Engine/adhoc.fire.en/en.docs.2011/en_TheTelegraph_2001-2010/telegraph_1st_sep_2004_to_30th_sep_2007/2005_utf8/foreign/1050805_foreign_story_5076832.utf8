 Laden deputy warns of London raids

 London, Aug. 4: The operational commander of al Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri, warned Tony Blair today that his policies would bring more destruction to London, in a videotaped message broadcast exactly four weeks after the 7/7 bombings.

 Zawahiri, 54, the Egyptian doctor who is Osama bin Ladens right hand man and the effective controller of the al Qaida network, said that Blair had only himself to blame for what happened to Britain. Blair has brought to you destruction in central London, and will bring you more of that, God willing, he said.

 Zawahiri also had a message for America, warning of horrors worse than they faced in Vietnam.

 In Crawford, Texas, President George W. Bush today said the US would stand its ground in Iraq despite Zawahris threats, whose ideology he dismissed as dark, dim, backwards.

 The videotape was shown on al Jazeera, the Arabic language news channel based in Qatar. The bespectacled Zawahiri was dressed in his customary black and white, wagging his finger at the camera. The video was shot against a plain background with an AK-47 assault rifle propped up behind his right shoulder. 

 Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden have been in hiding since the 9/11 attacks. They are believed to be somewhere in the lawless tribal regions of southern Afghanistan and Pakistans Northwest Frontier Province.

 Todays recording will be intended partly as reassurance to al Qaidas admirers that its leaders are still at large, and able to comment approvingly on recent events in the sporadic campaign of terror attacks by extremists on western targets.

 The reference to the London bombings suggests that the tape was made in the last four weeks. It is not clear if the senior al Qaida leadership still has any practical input into plans for future attacks by the plethora of terror groups that claim affiliation to it. 

 In the last 12 months, the mantle of leadership has appeared to pass to the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who claims to co-ordinate the bloody insurgency in Iraq.

 As for you, the Americans, what you have seen in New York and Washington, what losses that you see in Afghanistan and Iraq, despite the media blackout, is merely the losses of the initial clashes, said Zawahiri, in an apparent reference to the suicide bombings and other terror activities organised by Zarqawis organisation.

 If you go on with the same policy of aggression against Muslims, you will see, with Gods will, what will make you forget the horrible things in Vietnam and Afghanistan.

 The US believes that Zawahiri, who has a $25 million bounty on his head, is the main planner and ideologue in the old Qaida hierarchy. Analysts suspect that the group may issue coded messages in their recordings, to activate sleeper groups to carry out specific terror plots, as well as the customary calls for jihad.

 In his last appearance on a videotape broadcast on Jazeera in June, Zawahiri singled out Egypt particularly for criticism. Less than a month later, three bombers attacked the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing 67 people.

 In London today, the Tube tunnel in which half of the victims died has finally re-opened. An estimated 6,000 officers, half of them armed, were on duty to guard Underground and mainline stations and patrol the streets to deter a repeat of the 7/7 bombings.

 Commuters, many with no alternative but to use public transport, got on with their journeys as normal. 

 It is the first thing I thought of this morning ? it is Thursday, something is bound to happen because it is Thursday, said Rosemary Gajlmal, 20, a Romanian.

 who works as a waitress at a Central London bagel

 restaurant. quot;But I have to catch the bus as there is

 no other way to work. What can I do? quot;

 The Piccadilly Line was fully operational for the

 first time since Jamaican-born Jermaine Lindsay blew

 himself up on a train deep underground between Kings

 Cross and Russell Square stations, killing 26 fellow

 passengers.

 The first train to run along the track this morning

 arrived at Kings Cross at 5.37am and was held at both

 stations for one minute as staff and the few early

 morning commuters held a silent tribute. 

 At Russell Square, which was used as a temporary

 mortuary following the attack, a further tribute was

 spelt out on an electronic message board in the

 station forecourt. It read, quot;In memory of July 7 2005. quot;

 By 8.50am, the time that three co-ordinated blasts

 rocked the Tube network, a steady stream of commuters

 continued to leave Russell Square. A few stopped to

 look at flowers left in tribute, but the moment

 otherwise passed without any special recognition.

 quot;Thats the most significant tribute there could be, quot;

 said a Transport for London spokesman. quot;Life is

 carrying on as normal. quot;

 Last Thursday saw the biggest security presence on the

 streets of London since the Second World War, after

 intelligence warnings of another terrorist strike.

 Even more police were expected to be on duty today,

 including more than 3,000 marksmen. 

 The massive security operation got under way as it

 emerged from New York that the July 7 attackers had

 built their bombs not with military explosives ? as

 had been thought at first ? but from everyday items

 such as hair bleach and food preservative. 

 The easy availability of such ingredients added to

 concerns that the huge police presence in London might

 prompt the terrorists to change tactics and go for a

 soft target in another city. 

 quot;We do not know what it is the minds of these deeply

 evil people but we are doing all we can to thwart them

 with the publics help and determination, quot; one senior

 officer said. 

 The first man to be charged over the London attacks

 was remanded in custody today. 

 Ismael Abdurahman, 23, appeared at Bow Street

 Magistrates Court in Central London charged with

 failing to disclose information to police about

 Hussain Osman, who is suspected trying to explode a

 bomb at Shepherds Bush Tube station on July 21. 

 In a brief hearing lasting just under 10 minutes Mr

 Abdurahman spoke only to give his name. District judge

 Timothy Workman remanded him in custody until a

 further hearing on August 11.

 Fourteen other people are in British custody,

 including three suspected bombers from the failed July

 21 operation. 

 Mr Osman was arrested in Rome last Friday and Italian

 authorities said today that he will face his first

 extradition hearing under the new European arrest

 warrant on August 17.

 Mr Osman, born Hamdi Issac in Ethiopia, is currently

 being held in a high-security jail in Rome after

 fleeing the UK on a Eurostar train last week. His

 lawyer, Antonietta Sonnessa, and the Italian

 prosecutors have said the process could take weeks

 before a decision is reached on Britains extradition

 request.

 According to comments reported in the Corriere della

 Sera newspaper today, Mr Osman has told his lawyer

 that he fears what might happen to him in an English

 prison.

 He told Signora Sonnessa: quot;I am afraid of going back

 to England, I am afraid of what might happen to me in

 prison, I am afraid of spending the rest of my life in

 a cell. I beg of you, do everything you can to keep me

 here. quot;

 Mr Osman has claimed that the device he is said to

 have had with him on a Hammersmith and City Line train

 on July 21 consisted mainly of flour and was only

 designed to make a bang - a suggestion dismissed by

 Scotland Yard.

 He added: quot;I would never have killed anyone, still

 less ever dream of carrying out a suicide attack. I

 love life, I have never thought of dying. The very

 idea terrifies me. quot;

 The leader of Londons rank-and-file police gave

 warning that his members ability to protect London

 could be fatally compromised unless they had time to

 rest and recuperate. Glen Smyth, chairman of the

 Metropolitan Police Federation, said that many

 officers had endured an quot;exhausting regime quot; since the

 bombings. 

 Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner,

 admits that his forces are stretched and there is no

 sign that Scotland Yard can drop its guard yet. 

 Police teams are still investigating possible links

 between the July 7 and July 21 teams. They have

 established that both groups used home-made explosives

 but not whether the chemicals are exactly the same.

 Scientists believe that there may be two bombmakers. 

 Last night the New York Police Commissioner, Raymond

 Kelly, spelt out for the first time how the terrorists

 had constructed their arsenal from a visit to quot;a

 hardware store or some beauty supply store quot;. American

 police officials said that the bombs were made in

 Leeds and stored in an industrial fridge in the city

 before being moved south in drinks coolers stashed in

 the boot of two cars. They were probably set off using

 mobile phones. 

 Commissioner Kelly was briefing business leaders on

 security using information obtained by officers sent

 to monitor the London investigation. 

 Transport for London said today that the number of

 passengers using the Tube had dipped since the July 7

 bombings, although the fact that it was summer and

 that many lines had suffered disruptions had

 contributed.

 A TfL spokesman said that passenger numbers had dipped

 by around 30 per cent at weekends and by between 5 per

 cent and 15 per cent on weekdays.

 Members of Irelands Brazilian community were today

 joining a protest at the fatal shooting of a Brazilian

 electrician at Stockwell Tube station on the day after

 the second wave of attacks. Jean Charles de Menezes

 was shot seven times in the head after being mistaken

 for a suicide bomber.

 His death, for which the Met has accepted full

 responsibility, is being investigated by the

 Independent Police Complaints Commission.

 The Washington Post reported today that the

 International Association of Chiefs of Police had

 issued guidelines to its 20,000 members saying that

 officers confronting suspected suicide bombers should

 shoot the suspect in the head.

 quot;There is not a responsible chief or head of a law

 enforcement agency in this country who isnt now

 pondering the dilemma a suicide bomber presents to

 their officers, quot; Terrance W. Gainer, the US Capitol

 Police Chief, told the newspaper.

 quot;I really empathise with the British authorities, quot;

 added Mr Gainer, who is responsible for protecting

 both houses of Congress as well as staff and visitors.

 quot;Its a Hobsons choice. How do you control someone

 you think has a suicide belt on? But what are the

 consequences of shooting someone, who, because of

 behavioural profiles, looks and acts like a suicide

 bomber but turns out isnt? quot;

 Pope breathes unaided

 Rome, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Pope John Paul spent a restful night in hospital after throat surgery and was breathing unassisted but doctors have advised him not to speak for several days, the Vatican said today.

 The Vatican?s first medical bulletin, issued some 16 hours after the Pope had a tracheotomy to open his windpipe and help him breathe, was aimed at soothing a worried Roman Catholic Church. 

 Spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the 84-year-old Pope?s heart and blood circulation were good and he had no bronchial pneumonia infection. ?The Holy Father spent a night of tranquil rest. This morning he ate breakfast with a good appetite,? he said, adding that it consisted of coffee, biscuits and yoghurt.

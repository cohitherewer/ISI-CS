 Kick-smoking treaty in force

 Geneva, Feb. 27 (Reuters): A global treaty aimed at dissuading children from smoking and helping adults kick the habit came into force today with the UN saying it could save millions of lives.

 The World Health Organisation (WHO) applauded the strong warnings on cigarette packages and the eventual ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship laid down in the the world?s first international public health treaty.

 ?It?s entry into force is a demonstration of governments? commitment to reduce death and illness from tobacco use,? said WHO director general Lee Jong-wook in a statement.

 Tobacco, the second leading cause of preventable deaths globally after hypertension, kills 4.9 million people a year, the UN agency says.

 And the annual death toll from tobacco-related diseases ? lung cancer, heart attacks and cardiovascular diseases ? could soar to 10 million by 2020, with 70 per cent of the deaths in developing countries, it adds.

 The treaty, known as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, gives members three years to slap strong health warnings on tobacco packages and five years to ban advertising, promotion and sponsorship. 

 It also recommends tax increases on tobacco products, a crackdown on smuggling, and reducing exposure to second-hand smoke.

 Approved by the WHO?s 192 member states in May 2003, the pact will only carry legal weight in those countries which have ratified it, now numbering 57.

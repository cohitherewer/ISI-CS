 Royale Bond defects to eastern Europe

 - 007 

struggles to fight UK tax laws 

 Studios not enough: Pierce Brosnan 

 British film-makers were shaken yesterday to discover that negotiations were under way for James Bond to defect to Eastern Europe.

 Casino Royale, the 21st film about the suave spy, is expected to be made in the Czech Republic. Bond may have withstood Goldfinger and other criminal masterminds, but he is struggling to fight changes in the tax laws, seen by film-makers as going for the jugular of the beleaguered British film industry.

 The idea of shooting Bond ? the quintessential Englishman ? overseas would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Producers prided themselves on keeping him in Britain, even if it meant extra costs. Since 1962, 18 of the Bond films have been made at Pinewood Studios. 

 Bonds move overseas would be a devastating blow, with the loss of hundreds of jobs and millions of pounds in revenue.

 The uncertainty over tax breaks and the weak dollar already have caused various big-budget foreign films to be moved abroad. Plans to film The Watchmen, Hollywoods multimillion-pound adaptation of a comic-book superhero story, at Pinewood have been abandoned. Warner Brothers is reported to be considering moving the fifth Harry Potter film, The Order of the Phoenix, to the Czech Barrandov Studios instead of Scotland and Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire.

 Stephen Woolley, who made The Crying Game and Scandal, said of the latest news: Its desperately sad ... Its a kind of suffocation. This will totally hit the whole foodchain.

 He spoke to The Times in Cannes where he is premiering his new film about Brian Jones, the former Rolling Stones guitarist, which was partly filmed at Pinewood. He said that without the big productions, studios would not be able to afford to take a cut in fees for small, independent film-makers. Nor could they provide opportunities for trainees to learn the craft on set. The downside for us is that we will begin to lose people from the industry, Woolley said. 

Bonds producer, EON Productions, said that no 

contracts had been signed with any studio and a spokesman for Pinewood said that 

he could not comment on individual productions. However, Barrandov Studios confirmed 

toScreen International yesterday that they were well along 

in talks. The Czech Republic does not have tax incentives, but shooting there 

can be up to two thirds cheaper. A Czech set-builder receives as much in a week 

as his British counterpart earns in a day ? with the same quality.

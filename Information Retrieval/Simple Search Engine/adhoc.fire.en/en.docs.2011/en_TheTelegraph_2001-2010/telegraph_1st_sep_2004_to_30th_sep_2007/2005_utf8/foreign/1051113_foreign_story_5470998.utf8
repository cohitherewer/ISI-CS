 Annan in Iraq

 Baghdad, Nov. 12 (Reuters): An emotional UN secretary-general Kofi Annan paid tribute to fallen colleagues today when he made his first visit to Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein.

 The UN has been operating at greatly reduced levels in the country since international staff were withdrawn in October 2003 after two bombings at its Baghdad offices.

 I have been wanting to come for quite some time, Annan said, recalling his envoy, Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was among 22 people killed in a truck bombing at the former UN headquarters in August 2003. As I walked into our building I stopped by a monument erected to our dear friends ... They carried no guns, they came to help and their lives were cut short, he said.

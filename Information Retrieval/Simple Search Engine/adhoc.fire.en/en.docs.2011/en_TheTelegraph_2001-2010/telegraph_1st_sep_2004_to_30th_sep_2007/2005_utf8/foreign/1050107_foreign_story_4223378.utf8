 Cancer woman has baby

 London, Jan. 6 (Reuters): A British woman who had been told she was infertile after undergoing chemotherapy has given birth to a son ? described by doctors as a medical first ? British newspapers reported today.

 Now 21 with a one-year-old boy, the unnamed woman was diagnosed with bone cancer seven years ago but made a complete recovery after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. ?It was quite a remarkable event, something unpredictable,? consultant paediatric oncologist Dr Hamish Wallace said in Edinburgh.

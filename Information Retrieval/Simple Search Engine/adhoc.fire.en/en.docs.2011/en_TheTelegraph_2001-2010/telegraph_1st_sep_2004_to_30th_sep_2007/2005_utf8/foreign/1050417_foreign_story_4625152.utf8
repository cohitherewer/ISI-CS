 Fine Print

 Artistic birth

 Berlin, April 16 (Reuters): A Berlin couple plan to have their first baby at an art gallery, the gallery owner said today, confirming a newspaper report.

 ?It?s a gift to humanity, a once in a lifetime thing,? Bild newspaper quoted Winfried Witt, partner of mother-to-be Ramune Gele, as saying.

 Johann Novak, manager of the DNA-Galerie in central Berlin, said the artistic couple wanted to challenge conventional norms. ?It?s a bit of test to see if society can cope,? he said.

 About 30 people are expected to attend the birth, scheduled for April 24. They would be told to come to the gallery as soon as the 27-year-old Gele?s contractions became regular, Witt said.

 Novak said the gallery, which usually shows installations and video art, would be closed during the birth. Another gallery owner said:?I find it mad.?

 Pig charge

 Sofia (Reuters): A herd of 50 wild pigs rampaged through 

a Bulgarian town on Friday, after high waters of the Danube river forced them 

out of a neighbouring Romanian island. The boars swam the border river and stormed 

the northeastern town of Silistra, breaking shop windows and smashing several 

cars. Some ran into a hotel?s yard while others were seen in the hospital?s garden 

and near the police station. While most of the boars later ran off into the forest, 

four were shot down by forest officers. The meat, if deemed edible by a vet, will 

be donated to an elderly people?s home.

 Earth Day founder dies

 Washington, July 3 (Reuters): Former Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson, who founded Earth Day 35 years ago to propagate his lifelong devotion to the environment, died at his home early today.

 Nelson, 89, whose congressional legacy included environmental measures such as the 1964 Wilderness Act and a stand against the Vietnam War, had been suffering from cardiovascular disease, according to his family.

 Nelson, a Democrat, served three terms in the Senate before losing a 1980 election. After that, he joined the Wilderness Society as a counsellor, although his daughter, Tia Nelson, referred to his job as resident pontificator.

 He had an extraordinary sense of humour and an extraordinary commitment to public service all his life, she said. 

 He was a great raconteur. Nobody could tell a story like he could. He had a life of commitment and public service, all done with a great sense of humour.

 In giving Nelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nations highest civilian award, in 1995, President Bill Clinton said: As the father of Earth Day, he is the grandfather of all that grew out of that event: the Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act.

 Nelson said her father continued to work at the Wilderness Society until March. When someone asked why he still went to work, he said, Because the jobs not done, she said.

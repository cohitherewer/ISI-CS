 Pak attack 

 Islamabad, Jan. 19 (Reuters): A diplomat from Kazakhstan was in critical condition in a coma after being found wounded by a gunshot to the head at his home in the Pakistani capital today, officials and police said.

 Pakistani foreign office spokesman Masood Khan named the diplomat as Sapargali Aubakirov, a counsellor at the Kazakh embassy in Islamabad. He said Aubakirov was in critical condition. ?The incident is being investigated,? he said.?So far, the cause is not known.?

 Aubakirov was in a coma on a life support system at Islamabad?s Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, said Amjad Mehmood, a doctor there. ?He is in very serious condition. The treatment part is over, now lets see.? Reporters saw Aubakirov being wheeled into intensive care, his head heavily bandaged.

 Assistant superintendent of police Tahir Ayub said there was nothing to indicate an act of terrorism. Asked if it could have been a suicide, he said: ?That cannot be ruled out.? A security official, who asked not to be identified, quoted doctors as saying that Aubakirov had little chance of surviving.

 He said a .30 mm shell casing had been found in the diplomat?s living room and his car was missing.

 Ayub said two men had stayed with the diplomat overnight. ?They had food and drinks together. We saw no sign of violence. The people who were with him were known to him,? he said, but declined to elaborate.

 Iranian President suffers new rebuff

 Tehran, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Irans parliamentarians threw out President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads third nominee for oil minister today, blowing the worlds fourth biggest crude producer into uncharted constitutional waters.

 Irans oil ministry, the mainstay of the economy, has been rudderless since August and parliamentary hostility to the new President has exposed bitter rifts in the conservative camp.

 Several analysts and lawmakers have speculated the Guardian Council, Irans constitutional watchdog, may have to take the helm. The President is also at odds with the UN nuclear watchdog over Irans uranium conversion programme.

 This vote of no-confidence should carry a message to Ahmadinejad about his method of choosing his oil ministers, conservative lawmaker Ali Riaz said after the vote.

 Out of 254 parliamentarians who cast votes, only 77 voted in favour of Mohsen Tasalloti, a veteran of the petrochemicals industry. Lawmakers heartily congratulated each other when the results of the vote were read out. Lawmakers accused Ahmadinejad of only consulting with a small number of his close allies instead of with them.

 Ahmadinejad has a slogan of co-operation between parliament and government, but it would be better if he actually conferred with his lawmakers, Sattar Hedayatkhah said in the debate before the vote.

 The failure to select an oil minister has severe economic implications for the second biggest exporter in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which derives 80 per cent of its export earnings from hydrocarbons.

 This delay is wasting Irans huge oil and gas assets and damaging its economy, said Manouchehr Takin from the Centre for Global Energy Studies.

 Conservative parliamentarian Kazem Jalali said a competent manager had to be found soon.

 The current situation weakens our stance in Opec and will diminish our chances of co-operation with foreign companies because it indicates instability, he said.

 Lawmakers rejected Ahmadinejads first nominee in August. The second candidate pulled out of the race earlier this month. Ahmadinejad made oil a keystone of his election campaign in June and has, therefore, been keen to appoint an ideologically close comrade as oil minister.

 Star Wars leak plugged

 Washington, May 26 (Reuters): US law enforcers said yesterday that they have shut down a computer network that distributed illegal copies of Star Wars: Episode III ? Revenge of the Sith before it appeared in movie theatres.

 Federal agents executed 10 search warrants and seized the main server computer in a network that allowed people to download nearly 18,000 movies and software programs, including many current releases, the FBI said.

 The Elite Torrents network signed up 133,000 members who collectively downloaded 2.1 million files.

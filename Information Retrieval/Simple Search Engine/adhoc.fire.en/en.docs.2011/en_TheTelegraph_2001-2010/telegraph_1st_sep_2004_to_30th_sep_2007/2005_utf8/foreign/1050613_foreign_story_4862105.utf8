 Fine Print

 Pink power

 London, June 12 (Reuters): Four members of seminal British rock band Pink Floyd will play together for the first time in 24 years at Londons Live 8 charity concert for Africa on July 2, publicists for the event said today.

 Guitarist David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason and keyboard player Richard Wright will be on stage with bassist Roger Waters for their first public performance since they played at Londons Earls Court in 1981.

 The legends will join a star-studded line-up including Coldplay, Elton John and Paul McCartney at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, organised by rocker Bob Geldof to pressure rich nations to ease African poverty.

 Like most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the G8 leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world, said Gilmour.

 Sheer shear

 Sydney (Reuters): Australia out-clipped 

 the world in a 17-nation sheep-shearing contest in championships 

 held in Toowoomba in northeastern Australia on Sunday. Best 

 shearers from champion nations Australia and New Zealand 

 took on contestants from elsewhere including Germany, Norway 

 and South Africa, in the Golden Shears competition. A total 

 of 230 shearers raced for the championship, which was judged 

 not only on speed but also on lack of nicks. Shearers from 

 other countries found it tough to handle the heavy neck 

 wrinkles of Australias prize merino sheep.

 Fat fit

 New York (Reuters): Obese children may 

 have a hard time exercising because of the effort needed 

 to move their bodies ? not because their hearts arent 

 up to the challenge, according to a new study. The findings, 

 published in the journal Pediatrics, suggest obese 

 children should stick with low-intensity activities.

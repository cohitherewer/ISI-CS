 Muzaffarabad (Pakistan), Nov. 11 (Reuters): Pakistani police used canes against people living in an informal tent camp in the earthquake-hit city of Muzaffarabad today, after they protested against plans to evict them, witnesses said.

 Aid organisations are alarmed at the potential for diseases in several spontaneous camps that have sprung up in the quake zone, and the World Health Organisation is testing to see whether cholera has already broken out.

 While the Pakistani authorities are trying to persuade people to move to properly administered camps, people living in Jalalabad Park, having already lost their homes in the quake, demonstrated against being forced to move again.

 We just wanted to convey that we have become used to this place, and we dont want to move from here, said student Raja Abid, one of the camp dwellers involved in the protest.

 Abid and others said about 200 people took part in a protest march from a park in the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, where families have lived in squalid conditions since the October 8 quake. They baton charged us indiscriminately. They didnt discriminate between women, children and men, he said. Protesters said the march had been peaceful.

 But Attaullah Atta, Muzaffarabads additional deputy commissioner, said he ordered the police to act after stones were thrown, injuring two officers, and marchers blocked the way for ambulances passing down one of the citys main thoroughfares.

 Almost 400 tents are pitched in Jalalabad Park ? one of the few open spaces in the ruined city, now surrounded by destroyed buildings.

 The administration has given us two days to shift, but where should we go? We dont have anywhere, Sayed Ismail Shah, one of the camp dwellers, said. Deputy inspector general Tahir Mehmood Qureshi said the administration had tried for days to persuade the people to move to a camp in a neighbourhood less affected by the quake.

 Today, they protested. We tried to disperse them through persuasion, but they didnt. We were forced to baton charge them, Qureshi said.

 Light from distant planets discovered

 Planet Jupiter

 Washington, March 23 (Reuters): Astronomers have detected light from two planets circling stars outside our solar system, using a space telescope to open what they said yesterday is new era in the exploration of distant worlds.

 This is the first time light from so-called extrasolar planets has been confirmed, and scientists say it means other distant planets can be directly measured and compared, according to a Nasa statement.

 ?We?ve been hunting for this light for almost 10 years, ever since extrasolar planets were first discovered.? said David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who studied one of the two planets.

 Astronomers have detected more than 100 extrasolar planets over the last decade, but none had been seen directly until now. Most were inferred by a characteristic wobble in the stars they orbit, and others were identified when they passed in front of their stars, causing the stars to dim slightly.

 The light from these two planets was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope, which observed the planets? warm infrared glow.

 Both planets had been previously detected and both were believed to be ?hot Jupiters? ? big gas planets about the size of the largest planet in our system, but orbiting much closer to their stars.

 These close orbits mean ?hot Jupiters? soak up lots of starlight and give off plenty of infrared light, which was picked up by Spitzer?s instruments.

 ?Spitzer has provided us with a powerful new tool for learning about the temperatures, atmospheres and orbits of planets hundreds of light-years from Earth,? said Drake Deming of Nasa?s Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington. Deming studied the other planet in the pair.

 A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 10 trillion km.

 In visible light, the planets would have been completely overwhelmed by the bright light of their stars. But in infrared light, Spitzer managed to detect them when scientists used a simple trick.

 First, they used Spitzer to collect the total infrared light from both the stars and planets. Then, when the planets dipped behind the stars as part of their regular orbit, the astronomers measured the infrared light coming from just the stars. This determined how much infrared light belonged to the planets.

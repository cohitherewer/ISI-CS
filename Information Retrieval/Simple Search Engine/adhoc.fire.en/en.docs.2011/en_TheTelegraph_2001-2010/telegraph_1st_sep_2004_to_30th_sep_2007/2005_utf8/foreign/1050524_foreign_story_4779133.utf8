 China hit by flu fears

 Beijing, May 23 (Reuters): China has sealed off nature reserves and rushed more than 3 million doses of bird flu vaccine to a remote western province after migratory birds were found dead from the H5N1 strain, which can be fatal to humans.

 Poultry across far-flung Qinghai province, neighbouring Tibet and Xinjiang, had become the target of a compulsory vaccination campaign, the China Daily newspaper said today.

 Scientists had proved that the virus killed scores of geese in Qinghai in early May, media said at the weekend, the first report of H5N1 detected in China since last year.

 There had been no reports of the virus spreading to humans or domestic fowl in Qinghai, officials said. The area where the dead geese were found had been sealed off for 10 days. So far there has not been any human or any other poultry incident that has been reported and there are a lot of measures that have been taken in terms of prevention (and) in terms of vaccination, Noureddin Mona, China representative for the Food and Agriculture Organisation, said. The WHO urged surveillance be stepped up.

 In terms of the evolution of the pandemic (threat) if it spreads over a larger area ? and this does seem like a new area ? then it is going to be harder to prise the virus out of the environment, said Dick Thompson, the WHOs spokesman in Geneva. This doesnt change the risk assessmentl.

 The H5N1 strain has killed 37 Vietnamese, 12 Thais and four Cambodians since it swept across large parts of Asia in late 2003. Vietnamese health officials said today preliminary tests had shown another person had died of the virus at a hospital in Hanoi.

 Bush for complete Syria withdrawal

 Westfield (New Jersey), March 4 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today demanded Syria?s complete withdrawal from Lebanon.

 ?When we say withdraw we mean complete withdrawal ? no half-hearted measures,? Bush said at an event in New Jersey promoting his Social Security plan.

 His comments followed reports that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was expected to announce today a partial pullout of troops from Lebanon, with some leaving completely and the rest redeploying close to the border.

 ?Syrian troops, Syrian intelligence services must get out of Lebanon now,? Bush said. He said he was pleased a similar message was delivered to Assad by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, a leader with close Syrian ties.

 ?We want democracy in Lebanon to succeed. And we know it cannot succeed so long as she is occupied by a foreign power,? Bush added.

 Earlier, Britain urged Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon today and said international peacekeeping troops could be sent to ease the way.

 Pressure has mounted on Syria to leave Lebanon since former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated in a car bomb attack in Beirut last month. 

 ?It?s got to (leave Lebanon). Every one of its neighbours is saying: ?You?ve got to leave?,? British foreign minister Jack Straw told BBC radio.

 ?If they pull their forces out... then they can come back into the fold of the international community. If they don?t, they will be treated as a pariah not just by the West but by most of their Arab neighbours.? Syrian troops have helped Damascus secure influence over its small neighbour for decades and some observers are worried that a swift pullout could destabilise the area.

 Straw raised the possibility of more international peacekeepers being sent to Lebanon. A 2,000-member peacekeeping force has been in southern Lebanon since 1978. ?It is possible that as part of the phased withdrawal from Lebanon by Syria ? it has to be swift but phased ? there could be some more peacekeeping troops,? Straw said.

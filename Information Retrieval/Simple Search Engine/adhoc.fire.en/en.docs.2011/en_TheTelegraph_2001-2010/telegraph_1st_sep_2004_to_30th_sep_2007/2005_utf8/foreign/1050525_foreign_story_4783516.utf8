 Red basket in hand, go shopping for Paris mates

 - Singles 

 prowl store for romance 

 CATCH THEM YOUNG: The Galeries Lafayette store in Paris

 It is said of the French that theyre interested in only two things: food and sex. And so, every Thursday night this month, Galeries Lafayette, Pariss most famous department store, has combined these two obsessions in an evening of shopping and seduction.

 I go along, armed with a red shopping basket (which signifies my availability) and a white mark where my wedding ring normally sits. The idea behind the singles evenings is to encourage Parisians to shop for a mate along with their baguette and brie. The concept of the dating baskets was born in New York in the Eighties, says Sylvie Gaudu, director of Lafayette Gourmet. We are the first store in France to do it.

 The food hall is crawling with hopefuls (mainly men) carrying (predominantly empty) red baskets, searching for romance amid the fresh produce. Among them is Jean-Patrice, a 38-year-old civil servant who has been single for a year and used to be in the music business. Im here to meet people. I like the idea of it, he says. I certainly didnt come for the food ? its far too expensive.

 Jean-Patrice, a tall, good-looking man who claims he was once a great seducer, goes back to lurking around the cheese counter, which seems more popular with the female shoppers than the single men stalking the shop floor.

 When I first heard about the singles evenings, I was astounded. I always thought the French had the love thing well under control. Theyre always calling us Brits repressed and hopeless. I ask Cendrine, a 31-year-old Parisian secretary, if this is how she normally meets people. Its becoming more and more difficult for Parisians to meet people. We work, we go home, we move in small circles. This sort of thing is needed to bring us together. I am here to meet someone to go to the cinema with and then, who knows? I am willing to try anything, she says.

 David, 31, and Deborah, 29, are one lucky couple who have hit it off. We met while choosing apples, says Deborah, and found we have lots in common.

 One marriage in two in Paris ends in divorce and the number of Parisians living alone has more than doubled in 30 years. Statistics such as these should keep the food halls buzzing with singletons, divorcees and even some married women models.

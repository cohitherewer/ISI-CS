 Waves disturb dead

 Sinnamuhattuvaram (Sri Lanka), Jan. 4 (Reuters): A solitary skull sits on the roadside, torn by tsunami waves from the rest of the skeleton that lies nearby, wrapped in dirty cloth in its gaping wooden coffin.

 All around, the jagged edges of smashed blue, green and yellow tombstones poke up from the sand, an unearthed burial site close to Sri Lanka?s easternmost point that is a testament to the power of waves that sent thousands to new sandy graves.

 Some 30,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka by last week?s tsunami, triggered by a huge underwater quake hundreds of miles away, off the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

 Locals have buried many bodies on the beaches, often just a stone?s throw from where they were left by the surging sea, to stop them decomposing in the heat.

 The dead are still being found. Two boys on bicycles stopped yesterday to point out a body that had surfaced in marshland across the road from the disturbed graveyard. The skull is one of many objects caught up, swept away and abruptly discarded by the waves in the eastern district of Ampara, which suffered the worst devastation in Sri Lanka.

 In a nearby inlet, four wheels are all that can be seen of an upturned car, all but submerged. Amid the wreckage of houses, a single woman?s shoe lies partly buried in the sand. Clothes dangle from trees. Boats sit in the middle of roads.

 Only the fittest and the lucky survived the tsunami. Many women and children died, caught by the waves or crushed under debris. Many buildings were destroyed, but some strong, heavy objects escaped almost unscathed.

 A red tractor sits proudly beside mangled trees and a pile of rubble. A man with a sunken face points to his name painted on the side: P. Irajanayagam. ?I lost two houses,? says Irajanayagam, 55, waving his arms at a pile of rubble and pleading for help to get the tractor moving so that he can rebuild his life. ?I can drive it.?

 Irajanayagam is one of several hundred survivors who returned yesterday to the village of Komari, just south of the graveyard, hanging up their washing amid piles of bricks and twisted telegraph wires, determined to start again in the same place.

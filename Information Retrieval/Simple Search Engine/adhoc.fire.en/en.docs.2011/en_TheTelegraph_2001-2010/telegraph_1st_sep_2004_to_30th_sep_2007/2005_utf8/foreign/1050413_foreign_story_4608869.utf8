 Antarctica offers daring women jobs

 London, April 12 (Reuters): Fancy something different? The British Antarctic Survey may have just the job.

 The scientific research organisation has launched a recruitment drive to attract tradeswomen.

 The organisation is looking for female electricians, plumbers, carpenters, steel erectors, chefs and boat handlers to work for 6-18 months at its five research stations on and around the Antarctic.

 ?Where else can you work in an environment surrounded by penguins, seals and icebergs and climb down a crevasse during your lunch hour?? said Jill Thomson, head of building services at the BAS. The starting salary is ?18,338 ($34,640) plus an Antarctic allowance. All food, accommodation and travel are paid for.

 More women are going into the trades and the BAS said it wants to tap into that market. 

 ?This is a tremendous chance for women with a sense of adventure to try something completely different,? Thomson added in a statement. 

 ?While the salaries are not as high as you can earn in the UK, there is an Antarctic allowance and with no outgoing costs on accommodation or food it?s a good way to save money.?

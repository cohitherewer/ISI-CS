 Lines, weather tax pilgrims

 Vatican City, April 6 (Reuters): The closest that 70-year-old Maria Cipriana got to Pope John Paul was the first aid tent at the entrance to St Peter?s Square.

 After travelling across Italy and suffering six hours in a crushing line of more than 1 million people, Cipriana collapsed on the ground, her husband unable to catch her in time. ?We?re not going to see him anymore, are we?? Cipriana asked her daughter, motioning weakly toward the basilica where the Pope?s body lay. She looked dazed, her face flushed and her right knee swollen. 

 Millions of faithful have staged an unprecedented pilgrimage to Vatican City to honour one of the world?s most important leaders since he died on Saturday. But the flood of arriving pilgrims ? hundreds of thousands are pouring in just from John Paul?s native Poland ? have put a nearly impossible strain on Romes crowd control efforts.

 Medical teams stationed around Vatican City said they had treated hundreds of people, most of whom fainted after waiting as long as 14 hours through the bone-chilling spring night and the sunny, sweaty afternoon. ?A lot of these people simply weren?t prepared for this,? said Francesco Pinto Folicaldi, a doctor with Ordine di Malta, which set up a first-aid tent that had attended to some 400 patients since late Tuesday night. 

 Authorities said they would close the line, so the existing crowd had time to snake its way through Vatican City before St Peter?s Basilica shuts its doors to prepare for the Pontiff?s funeral on Friday. 

 The threat of a stampede is an increasing worry, visitors said, as they were being blindly pushed along a line that often took up the whole width of the street. ?What I?m doing is I?m standing at the edge of the line, so in case anything happens, and there?s an avalanche of people, I can get out of here,? said Viviana Moran, 54, pressed up against a metal barricade at the left side of the line.

 Osama not flying in

 Italy?s leading news agency has denied reporting that Osama bin Laden would attend the Pope?s funeral after a story attributed to it circulated widely on the Internet. In a dispatch issued late yesterday, it noted that the prankster, who specified bin Laden would be flying to Rome from Pakistan, had accurately imitated the agency?s signoff style.

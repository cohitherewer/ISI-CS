 Bush snub to UN on birthday

 MARC SANDALOW 

 Washington, June 24: The Bush administration appears ready to help guide the UN through an era of reform, even as the President and members of his party voice displeasure ? and at times disgust ? with the international organisation. 

 The President will not attend Sundays celebration of the 60th anniversary of the signing of the UN charter in San Francisco. 

 The White House rejected requests for the President or a high-ranking surrogate and is scheduled to send Sichan Siv, the US representative to the UN Economic and Social Council. 

 President Bushs absence from an international celebration in a city where 85 per cent of voters cast ballots against him will surprise neither students of foreign policy nor domestic politics. 

 Yet it raises some doubt about Washingtons commitment to the UN, as the 191-member international body celebrates its diamond anniversary. 

 In the past week alone, the House voted to halve the US contribution to the UN, unless significant reforms are made, and the Senate refused to confirm Bushs choice as US ambassador to the UN, leaving the post vacant for the fifth consecutive month.

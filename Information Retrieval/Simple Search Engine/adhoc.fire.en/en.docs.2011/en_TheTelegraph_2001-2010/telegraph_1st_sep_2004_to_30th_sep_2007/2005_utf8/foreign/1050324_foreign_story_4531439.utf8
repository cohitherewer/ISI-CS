 Schiavo parent plea vetoed

Atlanta, March 23 (Reuters): A US court rejected an appeal by the parents of a brain-damaged Florida woman who had asked that their daughter?s feeding tube be reinserted, according to an opinion issued today.

 As Schiavo lay for a fifth day 

 without food or water, the 11th circuit court of appeals 

 acknowledged the ?absolute tragedy that has befallen Schiavo?. 

 Schiavo?s parents, Bob and Mary 

 Schindler, had asked the appeals court to overturn a lower 

 court?s rejection of their bid to have the feeding tube 

 reinserted. The Schindler?s attorney, David Gibbs, had told 

 the court Schiavo was ?fading quickly? and death was imminent.

 However, Schiavo?s parents today asked the full US appeals court in Atlanta to consider their request for her feeding tube be reinserted.

 A lawyer for her husband, Michael Schiavo, who maintains she had said she would prefer to die rather than be kept in a persistent vegetative state, had argued that reinserting the feeding tube would infringe on his wife?s rights.

 The appeals court rejected the parents? appeal in a middle of the night ruling. 

 ?We agree (with the lower court) that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a substantial case on the merits of any of their claims. We also conclude that the district court?s carefully thought out decision to deny temporary relief in these circumstances is not an abuse of discretion,? Judges Ed Carnes and Frank Hull wrote in the majority opinion.

 Judge Charles Wilson dissented, saying: ?Theresa Schiavo?s death, which is imminent, effectively ends the litigation without a fair opportunity to fully consider the merits of plaintiffs? constitutional claims.? Schiavo?s feeding tube was disconnected on Friday under a state court order. Doctors say the 41-year-old woman would likely live for one to two weeks without it.

 Schiavo was left in a persistent vegetative state by cardiac arrest that starved her brain of oxygen in 1990. 

 The case has galvanised the Christian Right and prodded the Republican-led US Congress to pass a special bill to keep her alive. Michael Schiavo?s lawyer, George Felos said both sides were likely to pursue their appeals all the way to the Supreme Court.

 The order to disconnect the tube followed a seven-year legal battle between Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers, whose determination to keep their daughter alive has become a cause celebre for evangelical Christians, anti-abortion activists and conservative lawmakers.

 Fierce lobbying had brought Congress scrambling back from Easter recess to pass the special law allowing the Schindlers to take their fight into the federal courts.

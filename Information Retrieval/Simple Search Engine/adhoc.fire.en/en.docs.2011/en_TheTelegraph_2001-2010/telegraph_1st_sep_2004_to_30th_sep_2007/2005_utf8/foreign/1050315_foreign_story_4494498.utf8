 Bangla ban on smoking in public places

 Dhaka, March 14 (Reuters): Bangladesh has banned smoking in public places, in line with a UN treaty on tobacco control.

 Parliament passed a law implementing the ban late yesterday, setting a fine of 50 taka (80 US cents) for people caught smoking in places such as schools, offices, libraries, hospitals and airports.

 The typical daily wage of a farm labourer in Bangladesh is 60 taka.

 The law prohibits advertisement of tobacco products in cinemas, newspapers or on television in the country of 130 million people.

 The WHO said about half of Bangladeshi men and one-fifth of Bangladeshi women use tobacco in either smoking or smokeless forms.

 The global pact, signed by 167 nations, came into effect in February, despite what UN officials and activists say has been intensive lobbying by the tobacco industry.

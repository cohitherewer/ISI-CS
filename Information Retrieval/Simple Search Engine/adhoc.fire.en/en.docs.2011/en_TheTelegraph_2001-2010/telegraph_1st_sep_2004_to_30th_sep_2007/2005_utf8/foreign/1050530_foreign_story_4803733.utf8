 Netanyahu on fire

 Jerusalem, May 29 (Reuters): No stranger to the burning issues of the day, Israels Benjamin Netanyahu was really fired up during a radio interview today.

 Cant you smell the smoke? an Army Radio reporter suddenly asked Netanyahu, the finance minister, as they spoke about a recent controversial decision to replace Israels army chief.

 What do you mean? Netanyahu, well known for his penchant for cigars, shot back. Your cigar is on fire. The one inside your suit jacket. Minister Netanyahu, you are burning up, the reporter replied, his voice rising in urgency in the interview conducted outside the cabinet room.

 Eh? said a flustered Netanyahu. At this point, housing minister Isaac Herzog came to the rescue. Bibi, throw it on the floor. Throw it ? thats right, he said, using the former Prime Ministers nickname. 

 Emergency over, the reporter asked Netanyahu why he had put a lit cigar in his jacket pocket. I didnt know it was lit, Netanyahu replied.

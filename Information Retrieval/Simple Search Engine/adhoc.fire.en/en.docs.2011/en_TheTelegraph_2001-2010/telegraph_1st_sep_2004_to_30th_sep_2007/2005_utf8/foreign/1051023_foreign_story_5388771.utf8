 Looting of aid rising

 Kachili (Pakistan), Oct. 22 (Reuters): Incidents of people attacking and looting aid trucks in parts of earthquake-stricken Pakistani Kashmir are growing, witnesses say.

 Many of the accessible mountain villages are receiving only a trickle of supplies two weeks after the October 8 earthquake killed more than 51,000 people in Pakistan Kashmir, adjoining North West Frontier Province and Kashmir, local people say.

 Kashmiris living elsewhere in Pakistan have been in the forefront of loading up trucks to get help to their native villages, and some are furious that they are being waylaid.

 They are worse than vultures, said Mohammad Ishaq Khan after two truckloads of food and tents he had sent to his village from Lahore were looted in broad daylight before they got there.

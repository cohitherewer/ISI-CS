 Asean push for Suu Kyi

 Suu Kyi: Democracy cry

 Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Southeast Asias regional grouping wants to send an envoy to visit Myanmar Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Malaysia said today, marking an extraordinary step by its own gentle standards of diplomacy.

 The Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) usually avoids involvement in member states affairs but is running out of patience with military-ruled Myanmar, saying it feels embarrassed at the juntas lack of progress towards democracy.

 You see Myanmar has always asked us to speak on their behalf. I think we have done that for a long time, foreign minister Syed Hamid Albar said. 

We cannot be keeping on promising people.... 

We must be able to come back to ourselves and say, yes, I have met Suu Kyi, yes, 

I have met with some of the leaders, and they are really undertaking their own 

political reconciliation.

 Fine Print

 Parent trap

 London, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Parents in England and Wales who smack children so hard that it leaves a mark now face up to five years in jail under new laws that came into force yesterday.

 Mild smacking is allowed but any punishment which causes visible bruising, grazes, scratches, swellings or cuts can face action under the new legislation. An education department spokesperson said: ?It is vital that children are protected from violence and abuse with adequate safeguards.

 ?This common sense decision balances the essential need for children to be protected with the right of parents not to have the government interfering in family life.?

 Mum at 66

 Bucharest (Reuters): A 66-year-old Romanian 

 woman gave birth to a girl on Sunday after years of fertility 

 treatment and was claimed by Romanian media to be the world?s 

 oldest mother ever. Adriana Iliescu, a university professor 

 and author of children?s books, had been pregnant with twin 

 girls. One died in the womb and doctors decided to perform 

 a caesarean section in the 33rd week of pregnancy to save 

 the other. 

 Deep probe 

 Los Angeles (Reuters): In his 

 new 3D film Aliens of the Deep, director James Cameron has 

 sunk as deep as he could go. The film offers three-dimensional 

 looks at sea creatures rarely seen by man, miles and miles 

 below the ocean?s surface. The 3D technology makes viewers 

 feel they could almost touch the extraordinary animals found 

 by Cameron, such as a glowing, ethereal jelly-fish and swarms 

 of shrimp as numerous as locusts. 

 Rhino drive

 Kinshasa (Reuters): Five of the few northern 

 white rhinos left in the wild will be flown from the Democratic 

 Republic of Congo to prevent poachers wiping them out, conservationists 

 said on Saturday. Fewer than 10 of the rhinos are believed 

 to remain and with poachers carrying out frequent raids 

 in the wilds of northeastern Congo, moving the beasts to 

 sanctuary in Kenya is deemed the only option to guarantee 

 their survival.

 Reality TV

 London (Reuters): Reality TV, meet virtual 

 reality. Electronic Arts, the world?s biggest video game 

 publisher, is considering an interactive TV show that would 

 let viewers control the actions of the characters as in 

 its popular game The Sims.

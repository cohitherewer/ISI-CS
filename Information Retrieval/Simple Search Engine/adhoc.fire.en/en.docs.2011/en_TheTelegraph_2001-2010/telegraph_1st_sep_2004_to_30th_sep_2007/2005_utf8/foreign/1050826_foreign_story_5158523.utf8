 Pak poll fury

 Rawalpindi, Aug. 25 (Reuters): At least 20 people were killed and 100 injured in sporadic violence as Pakistanis voted today in the second phase of local elections expected to lay the ground for President Pervez Musharraf to stay in office beyond 2007.

 Pakistani officials said the violence was unexceptional, although 16 people were killed and hundreds injured during the first phase a week ago. Such violence is normal in local elections but there have been no clashes inside the polling stations, a senior Election Commission official said.

 Although the elections for local councils were held on a non-party basis, most candidates were backed by party factions.

 The ruling Pakistan Muslim League and its allies claimed big wins during the first phase, though opponents of the pro-military government denounced the polls as rigged.

 The local polls, revived by Musharraf as a means to promote grass-roots democracy, will culminate in a third phase on September 29, when the elected councillors will themselves vote for district or sub-district chiefs, or Nazims. The Nazims possess political clout that could prove crucial during elections in 2007 to the national and provincial Assemblies that pick the President.

 Thousands of people flocked to polling stations in the garrison city of Rawalpindi that adjoins Islamabad today and some queued for up to an hour to vote.

 Former PM Callaghan dies

 London, March 26 (Reuters): Former Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday, the BBC reported today.

 Callaghan became Prime Minister in 1976 after the surprise resignation of Labour leader Harold Wilson.

 His three troubled years at 10 Downing Street paved the way for the free-market revolution led by Margaret Thatcher and 18 years of Conservative government.

 He was the only man to have held all the top offices of state ? Prime Minister, foreign secretary, home secretary and chancellor of the exchequer, and spent a total of 32 years as a front bench spokesman, in government and opposition.

 Callaghan?s death comes 11 days after his wife of 67 years, Audrey, died.

 Despite his many achievements he is remembered for the series of crippling strikes which became known as Britain?s ?winter of discontent?.

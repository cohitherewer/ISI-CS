 Grenade was threat to Bush: FBI

 Tbilisi, May 18 (Reuters): The FBI said today a grenade thrown towards President George W. Bush during a visit to Georgia last week had been a threat to the American leader and had only failed to explode because of a malfunction.

 In a statement, a FBI official at the US embassy said the grenade, thrown while Bush made a keynote speech in Tbilisis Freedom Square on May 10, had been live and landed within 30 metres of the President.

 While the President ... was making his remarks on Freedom Square, a hand grenade was tossed in the general direction of the main stage and landed within 100 feet of the podium, said C. Bryan Paarmann, the FBIs legal attache at the embassy.

 This hand grenade appears to be a live device that simply failed to function due to a light strike on the blasting cap, the FBI statement said.

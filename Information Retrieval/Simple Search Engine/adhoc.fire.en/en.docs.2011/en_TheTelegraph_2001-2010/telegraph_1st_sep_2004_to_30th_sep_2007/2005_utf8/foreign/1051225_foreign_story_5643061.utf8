 Amiable Pooh turns 80

 London, Dec. 24 (AFP): One of the best-loved characters in childrens fiction celebrated a special birthday today when Winnie the Pooh turned 80.

 Winnie, an amiable but not overbright bear of little brain, made his debut in the London Evening News on December 24, 1925 and over the decades his fame has spread across the world.

 He was the creation of the writer A.A. Milne, who was inspired by a visit to the London zoo with his four-year-old son Christopher Robin. 

 The zoo was home to a bear named Winnipeg, the World War I gift of a Canadian army veterinary officer Captain Harry Colebourn, born in that city.

 The adventures of Winnie were based on stories Milne told his son and took place in the forest where Pooh devoted much of his energies to the quest for honey.

 He had a coterie of friends including the timid Piglet, the ebullient Tigger (tiger), the melancholy Eeyore (donkey), Kanga, rabbit and owl. Sports included Poohsticks which involve the dropping of twigs into water from one side of a bridge and running to the other side to see which arrives first.

 winnie the pooh was first published in 1926 and was followed by the house at pooh corner. It has been translated into many languages including latin (winnie ille pooh).

 On the death of milne in 1961, rights to winnie were bought by disney who turned the stories into a film and television series. (afp) psc dv 12241809 del

 Brussels bars Pak cleric over Taliban links

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Senator Maulana Sami-ul-Haq

 Islamabad, April 21: Security staff at Brussels airport detained pro-Taliban Pakistan cleric, Senator Maulana Sami-ul-Haq, on Tuesday saying he needed clearance from the Belgian interior ministry to enter the country.

 Haq was held in custody for three hours and was released only after other members of the delegation, led by Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) secretary general Mushahid Hussain, protested and refused to leave without the senator. 

 An eight-member delegation from the Senate, Pakistan parliament?s upper house, arrived in Brussels yesterday for talks on Kashmir and other issues with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.

 However, after Haq?s detention the meeting between the EU parliamentarians and the Pakistan delegation was cancelled.

 Haq is a senior leader of an alliance of Islamic parties the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a strong force in Pakistan?s national party and two states neighbouring Afghanistan.

 Haq also runs a madarsa called Darul Uloom-e-Haqqania, 110 km northwest of Islamabad where several Taliban activists have been groomed. 

 The senator, who decorated the Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar with an honorary degree in Islamic law, also had cordial relations with the Afghan militia.

 Today, the Pakistan National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution condemning the ?humiliating? treatment given to Haq by EU officials, triggering a ?strong? diplomatic protest by the government here.

 The Pakistan foreign office summoned ambassadors of Belgium and the EU to lodge a ?strong? protest over the incident, minister of state for foreign affairs Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar told the National Assembly.

 Rising above the political divide, Assembly members in their resolution condemned the incident.

 ?The House strongly condemns the Brussels incident in which the government of Belgium rendered indecent attitude to the Pakistan Senate delegation and cancelled their scheduled meetings with the delegation,? the resolution said. This particular action has hurt the privilege of Pakistani legislators, it added.

 Christina ring

 Christina Aguilera

 Los Angeles, Feb. 13 (AP): Christina Aguilera may be getting what a girl wants.

 The Grammy-winning singer is engaged to her boyfriend of two years, music executive Jordan Bratman, Aguilera?s representative Meghan Prophet said last night.

 Bratman, 26, proposed to the 23-year-old pop diva on Friday night while the two were vacationing at an undisclosed location, Prophet said. 

 ?No wedding plans have been set yet,? she added.

 Bratman presented Aguilera with a diamond ring designed by jeweller Stephen Webster, accoring to Prophet.

 The engagement initially was confirmed to the magazine?s People and US Weekly.

 Aguilera, whose hits include What a girl wants won a Grammy as best new artist in 2000, another in 2002 for best pop collaboration with vocals for her cover of Lady marmalade with Lil? Kim, Mya and Pink, and a third award last year for female pop vocal performance on Beautiful.

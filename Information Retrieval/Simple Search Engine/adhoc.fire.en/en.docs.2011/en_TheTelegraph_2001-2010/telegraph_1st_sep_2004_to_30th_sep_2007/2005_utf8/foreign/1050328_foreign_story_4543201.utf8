 Schiavo battle nears end

 Pinellas Park (Florida), March 27 (Reuters): A wrenching dispute over the fate of Terri Schiavo neared its end today as the brain-damaged Florida woman moved closer to death and her parents gave up their long and bitter legal battle to prolong her life.

 ?I?m not saying we wouldn?t be open to any idea that comes up. But at this point, it appears that time has finally run out,? David Gibbs, an attorney for Schiavo?s parents Bob and Mary Schindler, said. 

 The tube feeding that sustained Schiavo for 15 years was halted on March 18 under a state court order, setting off a flurry of efforts by her parents to get it restored. The effort brought in the US Congress, President George W. Bush and his brother, Florida governor Jeb Bush. But a string of judicial rebuffs, including from the US Supreme Court, effectively ended the Schindlers? seven-year legal dispute with Schiavo?s husband Michael Schiavo, over whether she should live or die.

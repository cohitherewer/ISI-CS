 Religious visas in UK

 AMIT ROY

 London, Dec. 20: The British government, which is determined to keep out extremist preachers in the aftermath of the July bombs in London, has relented and agreed to allow in religious workers for a maximum period of two years.

 These workers will be allowed to perform rites in mosques, temples and gurdwaras. But they will not be allowed to preach.

 After the attack on the London transport system in July by British-born suicide bombers, the perception has grown that some young people have been brainwashed and encouraged to take up terrorism by mullahs who have come into the country from outside.

 It is known that hundreds, if not thousands, of mullahs have come into Britain from Pakistan over the last 30 years and now play a crucial role in running an estimated 1,000 mosques in the UK. Most are harmless but a few are not, the government has decided.

 The government fears that a proportion ? possibly a small one ? has abused their position and preached dissent among young people, increasing their sense of alienation from mainstream British society.

 But after representations from religious groups that some workers were needed badly to officiate at weddings, funerals and other community functions, the government has relented and agreed to allow them in for a limited period.

 The workers will not be allowed to settle, though. After a maximum of two years, they will have to go back. 

 The governments restrictions on preachers ? in future they will be expected to be competent in English ? will not apply to the workers.

 Whether the government will be able to monitor the activities of any radical worker who seeks to recruit young people to extremist causes remains to be seen. 

 It is not only the Muslim community that has been infiltrated by extremists. Some Hindu militant groups are also trying to flex their muscles under the guise of expressing concern for the community.

 The government, which does not want to be seen to be too repressive, appears to have given in, especially to groups claiming to represent Hindus.

 It also remains to be seen whether at the end of two years, officials will be able to track down and deport religious workers who choose to disappear.

 Home office minister Tony McNulty said: The introduction of a new category for non-pastoral religious workers will help faith communities to find suitably-qualified personnel that are not always available in the UK.

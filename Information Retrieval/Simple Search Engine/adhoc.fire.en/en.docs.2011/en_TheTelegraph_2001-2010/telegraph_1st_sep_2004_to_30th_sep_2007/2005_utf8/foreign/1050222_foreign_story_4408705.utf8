 Scandal-hit UN official cries foul

 Geneva, Feb. 21 (Reuters): UN refugee agency chief Ruud Lubbers, who resigned yesterday amid sex harassment allegations, slammed an internal UN report into the accusations as flawed and unfair.

 In a confidential document, obtained by Reuters, the former Dutch Premier said the report gave no evidence to back up the charges and that remarks in it by UN investigators suggested ?vindictiveness? or a ?determination to suggest guilt.?

 Lubbers, who a 51-year-old American says groped her as she was leaving his office in Geneva in late in 2003, announced his resignation in a bitterly worded letter to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.

 In it he said that Annan, who last year decided against taking action on the report, had apparently caved in to pressure from a host of other problems facing the UN and the media.

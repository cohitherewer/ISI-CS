 Lost girls mother killed

 ROBERT D. MCFADDEN

 Valery: What lies 

 ahead? 

 New York, Oct. 2: The veil of 

 mystery surrounding a sweet four-year-old girl found wandering 

 barefoot and sobbing on a Queens street last week lifted 

 yesterday as the police charged her mothers companion 

 with killing the woman and abandoning the child who had 

 called him her father.

 The suspect, Cesar Ascarrunz, 

 32, a Bolivian doctor who relatives said came to this country 

 last year to seek American medical credentials, told investigators 

 after days of interrogation that he strangled and cut the 

 throat of the woman, Monica Lozada-Rivaineira, last weekend 

 in the apartment they shared in Forest Hills, the authorities 

 said.

 A law enforcement official said 

 Ascarrunz told investigators that he and Lozada-Rivaineira, 

 26, had gotten into a dispute on September 24. (Earlier 

 in the week the police had identified the woman as Monica 

 Rivadinerra Lozada.) He said he had objected to her staying 

 out all night and to the manner in which she was raising 

 her daughter, Valery Bel?Saavedra Lozada. 

 Ascarrunz, said the law enforcement 

 official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the 

 investigation was ongoing, claimed that the woman had tried 

 to attack him with a knife and that he had tried to defend 

 himself with a pillow. The official said the suspect told 

 investigators that he put her into a chokehold and that 

 she went limp. 

 In an attempt to revive her, Ascarrunz 

 said he cut her throat to establish an airway. 

 The killing took place before noon that Saturday.

 Police, acting on a court order, 

 had searched the couples apartment and found bloodstains.

 The police said last night that 

 they were continuing to search for the victims body. 

 It was unclear what was to become 

 of Valery, the dark-eyed girl who ? as New Yorkers have 

 learned in recent days ? has a cat named Gary, knows to 

 brush her teeth in the morning, loves pizza and hates pickles: 

 a child who does not yet know that her world has been shattered. 

 John B. Mattingly, commissioner 

 of the citys Administration for Childrens Services, 

 said she was in the care of a strong, capable foster 

 family in Queens, had been kept away from television 

 news and would be told what had happened at an appropriate 

 time by a counsellor. 

 Mattingly said he had no information 

 about the girls biological father.

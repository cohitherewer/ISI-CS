 Doha suicide bombing

 Doha, March 20 (Reuters): Investigators hunted for clues today as to whether al Qaeda was behind the suicide bombing of a Qatar theatre that killed a Briton, the first such attack in the US-allied Gulf Arab state.

 The bomber, an Egyptian national, rammed an explosive-laden car into the one-storey theatre near a British school in the capital Doha during a production of Shakespeare?s Twelfth Night on Saturday, officials and witnesses said. An interior ministry statement identified the suicide attacker as Omar Ahmad Abdullah Ali.

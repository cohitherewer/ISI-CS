The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

Tremors

 Freed inmates return 

 Colmbo (AP): About 100 Sri Lankan inmates who were released from their cells to escape last week?s tsunami have voluntarily surrendered to authorities while 200 others were missing, officials said on Sunday. 

 ?If the doors were not opened for them, they would have all died,? said prison chief Rumy Marzook. Another 100 inmates freed at the same time were immediately transferred to another prison. 

 It was unclear whether the missing prisoners had been caught in the devastation. 

 Australia plea 

 Sydney (AP): Australians should not travel to tsunami-hit 

areas across Asia in search of the bodies of their loved ones killed in the December 

26 disaster because the rapid decomposition of corpses has made visual identification 

impossible, the government said on Sunday. ?It will be only possible to achieve 

identification through dental records or DNA,? foreign minister Alexander Downer 

said. Twelve Australians have been confirmed dead and 107 others are missing and 

feared dead.

Fish scare 

Colombo (AFP): Seafood has disappeared off Sri Lankan dinner 

tables with people fearful of eating fishes that may have been feeding on corpses 

washed out to sea by tsunamis. ?There is fish coming into the market from trawlers 

that are returning, some after spending three weeks at sea,? said W.S. Dharmawardene, 

supervisor at the main St John?s fish market here. ?But there are no takers.? 

Fish markets were virtually closed in the Sri Lankan capital. 

 Quake alert 

 London (AFP): Countries all around the Atlantic rim could be hit by killer tsunamis at any time between now and the next 10,000 years, the British government?s chief scientific adviser said. Writing in the Independent On Sunday newspaper, David King said danger lies in the potential collapse of one of the Canary Islands into the ocean. ?Tsunamis caused by this would overwhelm the Canary Islands and batter the coasts of Africa, Europe and the Americas.? 

 Baby search 

 Lisbon (AFP): The father of an eight-month-old Portuguese 

girl swept out of his wife?s arms in Thailand in the tsunami said he was giving 

up his search for his daughter. Ricardo Carvalho told lisbon-based radio TSF from 

Thailand that after a seven-day search, he no longer had any hope of finding Mafalda 

alive.

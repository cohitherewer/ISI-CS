 Kurd named Iraq President

 Baghdad, April 6 (Reuters): Parliament elected Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani as Iraq?s President today, breaking a political impasse and paving the way for a new government more than nine weeks after historic elections.

 He is the first Kurd to be Iraq?s President ? and the first non-Arab President of an Arab state ? a sign of the new clout of the Kurdish minority that backed the US-led invasion. Two vice-presidents were elected: Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Shia who was finance minister in the outgoing government, and Sunni Arab tribal leader Ghazi Yawar, the former President.

 ?This is the new Iraq ? an Iraq that elects a Kurd to be President and an Arab former President as his deputy,? parliament speaker Hajem al-Hassani said after the vote. ?What more could the world want from us??

 In Kurdish towns across northern Iraq, residents danced in the streets, waved Kurdish flags and posters of Talabani, and honked their car horns. Kurds also celebrated in Kirkuk, where ethnic tensions have been mounting due to competing Kurdish, Arab and Turkman claims on the strategic oil city.

 Talabani, hailed by a standing ovation in parliament, pledged to work together with all ethnic and religious factions to rebuild Iraq after decades of conflict and dictatorship.

 The Islamist-led Shia alliance that won a slim majority in parliament and the Kurdish coalition that came second in the polls have been arguing for weeks about forming a government.

 They have also been trying to include representatives of the Sunni Arab minority that dominated Iraq under Saddam Hussein but was left sidelined after most Sunni Arabs stayed away from the January polls due to intimidation and calls for a boycott. There are only 17 Sunni Arab lawmakers in the 275-member parliament.

 Disagreement over which Sunni Arab would be vice president held up a deal, but political leaders decided late yesterday to favour Yawar over elder statesman Adnan Pachachi. Now the President and his two deputies have been appointed they must name a Prime Minister within two weeks. Shias and Kurds have agreed that Islamist Shia leader Ibrahim Jaafari should be Prime Minister.

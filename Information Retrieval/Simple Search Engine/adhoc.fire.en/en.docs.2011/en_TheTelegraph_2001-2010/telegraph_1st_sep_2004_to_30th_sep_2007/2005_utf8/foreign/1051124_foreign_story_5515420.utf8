 Clooney: West Asia thriller was torture

 New York, Nov. 23 (Reuters): In a gripping sequence from his West Asian thriller Syriana, George Clooney is tortured and flung to the floor of a Beirut hideaway. In real life, the actor said that scene led to the worst year of his life.

 The movie is getting Oscar buzz and positive reviews, though some wonder whether a complicated story about torture, terrorism, big oil and global politics can become a hit.

 Clooney plays a real-life CIA operative named Robert Baer, whose book See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIAs War on Terrorism, inspired the film, which director Stephen Gaghan shot in over 200 locations on four continents.

 Baer wrote about risking his life in encounters throughout Syriana, the code name for the world of militant Islam during the 1990s, and the subject added resonance following the September 11, 2001, attacks and the anguished national debate over faulty intelligence.

 Clooney was keen to plunge into the weighty thriller and took the challenge literally. He gained more than 13.6 kg to play the part of the paunchy, bearded CIA operative. While some actors enjoy the chance to be freed from incessant dieting, it was torture for fitness freak Clooney.

 There was nothing fun about it, said Clooney. There was not a moment that was fun about shooting this film. Thats not a slap on the film or (the director Stephen) Gaghan. Its just that everybody has that year where you age a decade and this was that one for me.

 In the films most chilling moments, reminiscent of Iraq war scenes, Clooney is strapped to a chair and tortured. 

 A shady West Asia agent, disgusted at his refusal to talk, pulls out a serrated blade to behead him. Clooney, bound and blindfolded, is hurled to the floor.

 The scene was shot more than 20 times, with the athletic actor doing his own stunt work. In one take, Clooney hit his head and experienced extreme back and head pain. Doctors later discovered he had ruptured his spinal fluid sac and he needed multiple surgeries.

 Creatively, it was the best year I ever had in my life, he said. For the rest of it, it was the worst year.

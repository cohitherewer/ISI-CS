 Blair poll plans start a day late

 London, April 4 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair is poised to open Britain?s election campaign tomorrow, a day later than expected due to the death of Pope John Paul.

 Instead of making today?s long-expected announcement of a May 5 election date, Blair attended a service for the late Pontiff at London?s Westminster Cathedral.

 But the Premier is still expected to visit Queen Elizabeth tomorrow to seek symbolic permission for the dissolution of parliament and unveil the election date.

 Blair will go to Buckingham Palace cheered by new polling indications that he will win a third straight term, a unique achievement for a Labour party Prime Minister.

 Iraq has weighed heavily on Blair?s trust ratings but Britain?s eight years of solid economic growth could more than balance the scales.

 The latest poll today put Labour ahead of the main Opposition Conservatives, but with a reduced lead compared to the last election in 2001. The YouGov poll for the Daily Telegraph put Labour on 36 per cent, down 6 points from 2001.

 Lanka govt in minority

 Colombo, Feb. 25 (AP): Sri Lanka?s ruling alliance lost its majority in parliament today after a Tamil political party withdrew its support, putting the country into a state of political uncertainty as it grapples to recover from the Asian tsunami.

 The Ceylon Workers Congress, which has eight seats in the 225-member legislature, said it was joining the Opposition because of unspecified disagreements with President Chandrika Kumaratunga?s government. The move left the ruling alliance with 111 seats.

 Though the loss weakens the government, it is unlikely to cause its downfall. However, the alliance could collapse if its key partner, the Marxist People?s Liberation Front, follows through on a threat it made yesterday to also withdraw because of a dispute over the peace process with Tamil rebels.

 ?We have resigned from the government,? R. Yogarajan, a senior member of the Ceylon Workers Congress, said. He said the decision to quit was prompted by ?the government?s failure to implement certain agreements and programmes.?

 The Marxist People?s Liberation Front threatened to withdraw its 39 lawmakers from the alliance because it opposes the government?s proposed power-sharing agreements with the Tamil Tiger rebels. 

 World Bank aid

 The World Bank yesterday approved an additional $75 million in emergency aid for Sri Lanka?s tsunami recovery and reconstruction effort, bringing to $150 million the total assistance made available this month.

 The new funding will help victims of the December disaster rebuild houses, provide employment opportunities and fund repairs to infrastructure systems including roads and water supply, the World Bank said in a statement.

 Of the funds approved yesterday, $30 million is a grant and the rest is a credit from the bank?s lowest-cost financing arm, the International Development Association. ?The financing package approved today is geared to help people get their lives back,,? said Peter Harrold, World Bank country director for Sri Lanka.

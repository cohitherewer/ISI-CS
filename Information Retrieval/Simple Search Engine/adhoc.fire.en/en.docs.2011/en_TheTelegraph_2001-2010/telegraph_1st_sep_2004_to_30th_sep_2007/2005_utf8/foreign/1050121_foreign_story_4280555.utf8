 Pak bulldozers roll in tribal belt

 Quetta (Pakistan), Jan. 20 (Reuters): Security forces in Pakistan today demolished houses used by tribesmen to launch a bloody attack on the country?s main gas field that forced a costly shutdown of supplies.

 Militiamen used bulldozers to raze the houses near the Sui gas field in the southwestern province of Baluchistan, residents said. ?We are bulldozing those houses from where the rockets were fired,? provincial home minister Mir Shoaib Nusherwani said. ?We are trying to secure the areas near the gas field.?

 The action came a day after police sought arrest warrants against 36 tribesmen for launching the January 11 attack on the Sui field in which as many as 15 people died and the main purification plant and pipelines were damaged.

 It was the latest in a string of attacks by tribesmen seeking more autonomy, development funds and royalties from gas. The wanted group included a son and a grandson of powerful tribal leader and regional political figure Nawab Akbar Bugti.

 Residents of Sui, which is about 400 km east of Baluchistan?s provincial capital Quetta, said security forces stepped up security before demolishing the houses. ?The gas field has been sealed off and helicopters are hovering over it,? resident Niaz Bugti said.

 Military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said the government was determined to ensure the safety of key installations like Sui but denied it had launched any military action.?There is no military operation going on there,? he said.

 Sui produces up to 45 per cent of Pakistan?s gas and the attack disrupted supplies to power firms and factories in northern and southern Pakistan as well as to some domestic consumers.

 Officials said yesterday that the damage had been repaired and supplies partially restored but full supplies would not be resumed before the end of the week. The latest attack was unusually intense and analysts have warned that the unrest could explode into a major insurgency if it was not handled carefully.

 President Pervez Musharraf?s government vowed to prevent future attacks on the Sui facility. But at the same time it expressed hopes for a political solution.

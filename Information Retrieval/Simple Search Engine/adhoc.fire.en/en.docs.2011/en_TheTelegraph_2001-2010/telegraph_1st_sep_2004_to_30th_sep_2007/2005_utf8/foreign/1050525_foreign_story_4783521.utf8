 Zarqawi hurt, says website

 Dubai, May 24 (Reuters): Al Qaidas group in Iraq said today its leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been wounded and urged Muslims to pray for him, according to a web posting. 

 nation of Islam... Pray for the healing of our Sheikh Abu Musab al-Zarqawi from an injury he suffered in the path of God, said a statement from the Al Qaida Organisation for Holy War in Iraq. Its authenticity could not be verified.

 You are the beloved of the mujahideen (holy fighters), and may God heal you and make you steadfast ..., said the statement posted by a user on an Islamist site which often publicises the groups activities.

 Our sheikh has taught us that nothing is worthy compared to...Islam, it added.

 In Baghdad, U.S. army Lieutenant Colonel Steve Boylan, spokesman for U.S. forces in Iraq said:We have no information on whether hes wounded or what the state of his health is. Hes still our number one target to be captured or killed and until that happens, the hunt is still on.

 He also said that such reports had been heard frequently before and were almost impossible to verify. 

 This could be another one of their ploys, you never know, he added.

 The Pentagon in Washington said it had no basis to confirm or deny the story.

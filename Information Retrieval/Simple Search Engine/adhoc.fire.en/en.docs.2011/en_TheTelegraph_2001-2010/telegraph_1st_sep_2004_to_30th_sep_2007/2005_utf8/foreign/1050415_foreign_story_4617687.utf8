 Friends star to act in London

 Schwimmer

 London, April 14 (Reuters): David Schwimmer, who starred as hapless lover Ross in the TV hit Friends, will play a louche lothario on the London stage next month, the latest US star to swap Hollywood glamour for West End kudos.

 Schwimmer makes his debut in the play Some Girls alongside Vera Drake actor Lesley Manville. Schwimmer, who entertained millions as Ross Geller, has said acting in the West End is the realisation of a boyhood dream. He is following a well-trodden path. Batman star Val Kilmer signed up for the lead role in the stage version of The Postman Always Rings Twice at the Playhouse.

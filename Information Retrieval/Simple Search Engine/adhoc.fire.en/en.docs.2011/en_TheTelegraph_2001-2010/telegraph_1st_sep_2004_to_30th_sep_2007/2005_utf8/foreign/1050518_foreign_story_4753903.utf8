 Awami leader shot dead

 Dhaka, May 17 (PTI): An Awami League leader was shot dead here today by unknown assailants, sparking off violent protests which left 20 people injured.

 Khorshed Alam Bacchu, Awami Leagues Dhaka unit law secretary, was attacked by the assailants as he came out of his home in central Dhakas Tejgaon area. The thirty-year-old advocate died instantly.

 Police used batons to disperse Bacchus supporters who damaged passing vehicles as shops downed their shutters, witnesses said.

 A large stretch of dhakas main VIP road was closed to traffic for hours due to violence that left at least 20 people injured.

 The Awami League immediately called for a general strike in Dhaka tomorrow and warned that tough action would be taken if the killers were not arrested.

 Family sources said the victim, who was also the joint general secretary of the district bar council, had earlier dropped his daughter Shyama to a nearby school. 

 Police have begun an investigation.

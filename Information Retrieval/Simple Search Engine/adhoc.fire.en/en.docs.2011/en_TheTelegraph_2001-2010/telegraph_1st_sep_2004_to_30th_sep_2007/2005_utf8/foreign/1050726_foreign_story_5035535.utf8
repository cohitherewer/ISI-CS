 Suspects in botched attack case named

 Failed attack suspect Muktar Said-Ibrahim

 London, July 25 (Reuters): British police today named two suspects wanted for trying to set off bombs across Londons transport network last week as they scrambled to track down the attackers and stop them striking again.

 The botched attacks raised fears among Londoners that the city could be a frequent target for Islamist militants, coming just two weeks after suicide bombers killed 52 people on July 7.

 Anxious to get public attention back on the search for the attackers after killing a Brazilian electrician in error, police named two of the four suspects they have been seeking since releasing security camera images last week.

 I hope that by setting out some of what we have been able to learn over the past few days, the public may be able to contribute even more to the progress of the investigation, Londons anti-terrorist police chief Peter Clarke said.

 He named the two as Yasin Hassan Omar, 24, and Muktar Said-Ibrahim or Muktar Mohammed-Said, aged 27. Police raided a house in north London that Omar had recently visited. Clarke did not say whether they were Britons or foreigners. The four men who carried out the July 7 attacks ? which officials have linked to al Qaida ? were all British Muslims, three of them of Pakistani origin.

 Clarke also revealed a bomb abandoned in a park in west London was similar to those from the failed attacks.

 Police were trying to establish if the device belonged to a fifth man or if one of the attackers had carried two bombs.

 In Aceh, aid has an American face

 Jakarta, Jan. 7 (Reuters): For many of the homeless and hungry in Indonesia?s tsunami-devastated Aceh province, when aid comes it comes with an American face, a plus for sometimes rocky US relations with the world?s most populous Muslim nation.

 But some are wary of the superpower?s ultimate intentions toward a country they fear mixes a war against terror with a crusade against Islam, and analysts say Washington must tread carefully to avoid a backlash.

 The US has promised $350 million in aid to the countries affected by the December 26 tsunami, which hit Indonesia the hardest, killing more than 100,000 people and leaving over half-a-million homeless. 

 Others have pledged more, but Washington was the first to deliver in a big, high-profile way, quickly deploying navy ships and military aircraft to help. US helicopters have flown hundreds of sorties taking desperately needed food and medicine to isolated parts of remote Aceh.

 For people on Aceh?s hard-hit west coast it?s as if ?all there is is Chinooks (helicopters) and the US coming in to help, and there?s going to be real and long-lasting gratitude there,? the International Crisis Group?s Sidney Jones, a long-time Indonesian expert, said today. ?I am touched at how generous they are, helping us without any thoughts,? said Sofyan Ahmad, a pedicab driver said.

 US moves have included a trip to Aceh by secretary of state Colin Powell and President George W. Bush?s brother Jeb, and lifting of a ban on spare part supplies for Indonesian air force C130s to improve Indonesia?s ability to fly in aid.

 Foreign ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa said: ?The very prompt and substantial US response... has not only further confirmed what we knew all along in terms of the robust and the very close relationship between the two countries, but has also further enhanced the relationship.?

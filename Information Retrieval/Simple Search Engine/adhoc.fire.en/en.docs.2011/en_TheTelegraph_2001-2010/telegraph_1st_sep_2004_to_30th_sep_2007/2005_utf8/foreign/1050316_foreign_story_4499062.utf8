 22 killed as police raid Manila jail

 Manila, March 15 (Reuters): Philippine police shot dead 22 prisoners as they stormed a Manila jail today to end a 24-hour standoff with a group of Islamic militant suspects holed up in the building.

 Six police officers were wounded and three leaders of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group accused of murder and kidnapping were among those killed, interior secretary Angelo Reyes said.

 ?The crisis is over,? he said. ?The operation is terminated.?

 Yesterday?s prison uprising, the latest in a series of security lapses in jails involving Islamic militants, was another blow to the government?s anti-terrorism credentials.

 Despite years of training and on the ground advice by US special forces, the government has failed to wipe out the small Abu Sayyaf group, which claimed responsibility for a deadly ferry bombing last year.

 Police said they regained control of the prison building about an hour after starting the assault, in which troops fired tear gas as teams of police commandos scaled the walls of the four-storey detention centre.

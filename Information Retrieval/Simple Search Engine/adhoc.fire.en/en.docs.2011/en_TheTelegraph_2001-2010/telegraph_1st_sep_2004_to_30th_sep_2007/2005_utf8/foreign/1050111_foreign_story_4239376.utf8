 Cracker of a July 4 collision in space

 NIC FLEMING

 The Deep Impact spacecraft

 London, Jan. 10: A spacecraft is to be launched this week on a spectacular mission to blow a chunk the size of Rome?s Coliseum out of a comet.

 The Deep Impact probe?s 80 million-mile journey will end in a 23,000 mph collision creating a celestial firework display visible from earth with binoculars on July 4, American Independence Day.

 Its dramatic encounter with the Tempel 1 comet, creating an explosion equivalent to igniting 4.5 tonnes of TNT, will release a shower of debris that astronomers hope will provide clues to the origins of the solar system and possibly to life on earth. The spacecraft and impactor probe will lift off from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Wednesday.

 Comets are essentially enormous, dirty snowballs from the outer solar system made up of a nucleus of ice and embedded dust and a surrounding ?coma? of gas and debris.

 Some scientists believe comets could have brought material to earth that provided the raw chemical materials that kick-started life.

 Simon Green, a senior lecturer at the Open University?s Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, said: ?If we can study the inside of a comet where the ices are untouched by the sun you can learn about the conditions that prevailed in the outer solar system at the time the solar system and earth were formed 4.5 billion years ago.

 ?We also want to understand the structure of comets, how dense and how porous they are. 

 ?Comets may be the original source of material that provided the raw materials for life on earth. It?s a controversial theory that used to be seen as wacky but is now being taken increasingly seriously.?

 The 3 feet by 3 feet copper-fortified probe will be released from the Deep Impact craft 24 hours before its rendezvous with Tempel 1. It is expected to blast a hole in the comet the equivalent of seven storeys deep. The spacecraft is named after the 1998 Hollywood film Deep Impact, about a comet on collision course with earth.

 One of the project?s aims is to find out more about the structure of comets. However, Nasa stresses that there is no risk of the comet being diverted on to a collision course with earth as its orbit brings it no closer than 50 million miles away and the impact will not change this by more than 330 feet.

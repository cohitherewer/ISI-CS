 Fine Print

 Wonder violin

 London, Oct. 26 (Reuters): A violin created by one of the worlds leading makers and once owned by Italian maestro Nicolo Paganini goes to auction next week with an asking price of ?500,000.

 Not only is it the first time one of Paganinis cherished instruments has come up for auction, it is one of only 50 surviving violins by master craftsman Carlo Bergonzi of Cremona. It is not known when Paganini ? whose virtuoso playing made people believe he had struck a deal with the devil ? acquired the instrument.

 Alien loss

 London (Reuters): Do you have memories of being abducted by aliens and whisked away in a spaceship? You wouldnt be alone. Several thousand people worldwide claim to have had such close encounters, researchers say. But in a new study, a psychology expert at Londons Goldsmiths College says these experiences are proof of the frailty of the human memory, rather than evidence of life in other galaxies.

 Rare tracks

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The Rolling Stones will release an album of rare tracks next month in partnership with coffee retailer Starbucks Corp. and the groups Virgin Records label. Rarities 1971-2003 will be released simultaneously on November 22 both in Starbucks-owned outlets and in traditional music stores across the US.

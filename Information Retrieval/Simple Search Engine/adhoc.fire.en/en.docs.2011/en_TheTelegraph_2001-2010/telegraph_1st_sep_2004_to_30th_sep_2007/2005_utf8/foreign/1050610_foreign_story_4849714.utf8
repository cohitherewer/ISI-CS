 Crowe sorry

 Los Angeles, June 9 (Reuters): Two days after his arrest on assault charges, Oscar winner Russell Crowe shifted into damage-control mode yesterday, publicly apologising for his telephone-throwing tantrum in the midst of a promotional tour for his latest film.

 In television interviews with MSNBC and on the CBS Late Show with David Letterman, Crowe chalked up Mondays outburst at a New York hotel to the strain of loneliness and frustration at being unable to get calls through to his wife in Australia. Im extremely sorry for this whole incident and I regret everything that took place, the New Zealand-born actor told Letterman. The bottom line is I did something pretty stupid... This is possibly the most shameful situation Ive ever gotten myself (into) in my life.

 Poking fun at the actor as he welcomed Crowe onto his show, Letterman picked up the telephone from his desk and moved it off stage. Crowe, who plays a boxer in his new movie Cinderella Man, was arrested on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon in connection with Mondays incident, in which police say he hurled a telephone at the concierge of the Mercer Street Hotel in Manhattan.

 The actor was taken away in handcuffs and later released on his own recognisance. If convicted of assault, he could face up to seven years in prison.

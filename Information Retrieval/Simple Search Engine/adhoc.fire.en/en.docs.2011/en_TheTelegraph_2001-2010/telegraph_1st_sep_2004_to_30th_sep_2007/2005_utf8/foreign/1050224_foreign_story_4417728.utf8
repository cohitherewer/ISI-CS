 Democracy godless: Pope

 Rome, Feb. 23: The Pope published a new book yesterday strongly attacking the ?negative? society of the West, calling it a godless ?anti-Gospel and new totalitarianism? masquerading as democracy.

 Entitled Memory and Identity: Conversations Between Millenniums, John Paul II?s fifth book, printed first in Italian, blames the moral permissiveness of the West for undermining society with divorce, free love, abortion, euthanasia, and genetic manipulation. 

 He also talks for the first time of the attempt on his life in 1981, describing his survival as an ?act of divine intervention?. But its main focus is the risk democracies pose to the law of God. La Repubblica, the Italian daily which was shown advance excerpts, wrote yesterday: ?The nihilism of the West is disturbing to the Pope. His claim is that democratic parliaments are the carriers.?

 Driven by ?powerful economic forces,? the Pope claims, the ?anti-Gospel? is spreading the idea that ?one must live life as if God does not exist?.

 By contrast, Eastern Europe, the Polish Pope said, had reached ?a spiritual maturity for which certain important values are less devalued than in the West?. 

 He adds: ?The main threat which central Europe finds itself facing is that of falling without criticism under the influence of the negative culture so widespread in the West.?

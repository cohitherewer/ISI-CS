 Smoking pact set to become law

 Manila, Feb. 24 (AFP): The world?s first treaty on reducing tobacco consumption which is said to be causing five million deaths a year becomes binding international law on Sunday, the WHO said today.

 The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control aims to curb what has become the second biggest killer of our time, the WHO said in a statement from its Manila-based western Pacific regional headquarters.

 ?The devastation caused by the tobacco pandemic dwarfs Sars and the recent tsunami,? the statement said.

 ?Every year, five million people die from tobacco-related diseases. In the western Pacific region alone, 3,000 people die each day from tobacco use,? it quoted regional director Shigeru Omi as saying.

 ?Now we have the global tools to fight a global problem. It?s time for all countries to join the battle,? the statement said.

 ?Tobacco consumption will prematurely end the lives of 10 million people a year by 2020 if current trends are not reversed.

 ?It is the only legal product that causes the death of one half of its regular users. This means that of the current 1.3 billion smokers worldwide, 650 million people will die prematurely due to tobacco.?

 Convention provisions set international standards on tobacco price and tax increases, tobacco advertising and sponsorship, labelling, illicit trade and second-hand smoke.

 The convention was unanimously adopted by the 56th world health assembly in may 2003, following almost three years of negotiations. Afp hk 02241410 del

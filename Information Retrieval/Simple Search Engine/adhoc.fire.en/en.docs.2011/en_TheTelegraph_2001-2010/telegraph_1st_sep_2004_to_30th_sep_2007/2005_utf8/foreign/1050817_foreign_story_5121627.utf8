 Chandrika in urgent House recall

 Chandrika Kumaratunga

 Colombo, Aug. 16 (Reuters): Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga today recalled parliament from recess to endorse a state of emergency declared after the assassination of her foreign minister raised the spectre of renewed civil war.

 After its ratified, we are going to extend the emergency by one more month, health minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said ahead of the special parliamentary session on Thursday.

 The government declared a state of emergency on Saturday, a day after foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was killed in an attack it blamed on the LTTE rebels, who denied any involvement.

 The emergency would have to be extended because the killers were still at large and the government feared there might be more such attacks despite a ceasefire, he said.

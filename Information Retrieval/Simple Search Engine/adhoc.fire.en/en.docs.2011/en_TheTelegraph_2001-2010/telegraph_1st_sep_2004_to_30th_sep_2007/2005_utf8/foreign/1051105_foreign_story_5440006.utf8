 Fine Print

 Gorilla reality

 Prague, Nov. 4 (Reuters): Big Brother is about to become monkey business.

 Inspired by the television reality show, Czech public radio and television broadcasters have announced that on November 7, they will begin airing a new show that will follow the lives of four gorillas living together at the Prague Zoo.

 The show, to be called Odhaleni (Discovery), will see the primates ? one male, two females and one baby ? battle it out for a grand prize of 12 melons, a delicacy for gorillas. Czech Television will set up 15 cameras to monitor the gorillas. 

 Glue grind

 Los Angeles (Reuters): A Colorado man 

 who had a panic attack when he found he was glued to a toilet 

 seat in a Home Depot restroom has sued the home improvement 

 giant for negligence, saying staff ignored his plight. Retired 

 electrical engineer Bob Dougherty, 57, said he was stuck 

 in the stall with his pants down for about 20 minutes and 

 that two years after the 2003 incident he was suffering 

 from post-traumatic stress.

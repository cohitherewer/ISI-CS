 Roche to ease grip on flu drug

 Zurich, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Drug maker Roche Holding AG would be willing to discuss giving a production licence for its antiviral Tamiflu drug to Indian generic drug maker Cipla, a senior Roche executive said today. 

 Roches head of pandemic sales for Tamiflu, David Reddy, said in an interview that the Swiss firm had not yet been approached by Cipla, which has said it could make a copycat version of the Roche flu treatment to help governments build stockpiles.

 We would welcome if a company believes that it has the competencies then we would like an open discussion with them and, therefore, we are open to being approached, Reddy said.

 We have not yet been approached, he added.

 Reddy also said Roche had been approached by one government in Asia that was also keen to make its own generic version of Tamiflu, one of the drugs which the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends stockpiling in preparation for a possible bird flu pandemic.

 We have been approached by one government in east Asia ? not the Thai government. We are evaluating that and we will enter discussions with them, he said.

 Thawat Suntarjarn, head of Thailands department of disease control, said a version of the drug could be put on sale before October if serious outbreaks hit the country.

 Every country is queuing up to buy Tamiflu from Roche and we are afraid we wont be able to get enough drug when we need it. So we have to produce it ourselves, Thawat said.

 Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, is the most effective anti-viral drug currently available for avian flu.

 Mike Ryan, WHO director for epidemic and pandemic alert, said yesterday supplies were clearly insufficient to face up to a potential bird flu pandemic if the steadily spreading avian virus jumps to humans. Public health must overcome all obstacles in the trade and licensing area, Ryan said.

 eBay sale

 Internet auction site eBay pulled the sale of Tamiflu from its website today, after prices topped ?100. An eBay spokeswoman said the auction had been stopped because the sale of prescription drugs was not allowed under the companys rules.

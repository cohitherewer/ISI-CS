 Defiant survivors start to rebuild

 Banda Aceh (Indonesia), Jan. 6 (Reuters): Butchers, shopkeepers and restaurant owners in this devastated city opened for business today, while a traditional marketplace bustled, as tsunami survivors defiantly began to rebuild their lives.

 ?We have to open, if not, many people will starve,? said Muhammad Saman, whose small restaurant is sandwiched between a refugee tent city and the destroyed homes that litter the coast. ?Our restaurant is opened voluntarily because many refugees come here for food,? Saman said.

 Nearly 100,000 people died in Indonesia?s northern province of Aceh, two thirds of those killed by the December 26 tsunami which swept across the Indian Ocean. Its provincial capital, once home to more than 300,000 people, was flattened and splintered.

 ?The only thing I have ever seen like it is in photos of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,? said British international development minister Hilary Benn after inspecting Banda Aceh.

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and the head of the World Bank James Wolfensohn will visit Banda Aceh tomorrow to inspect first hand the devastation and the relief effort.

 But as Annan and world leaders met in Jakarta today to tackle the tsunami crisis, with the global aid pledge now standing at $3.7 billion, the people of Banda Aceh were defiant they would survive.

 ?The quake can happen anywhere. I?m from here, I feel comfortable here and I intend to stay,? said Cut Yusri, 50, as she queued for rice, noodles and cooking oil at an aid station. But fear lies close to the surface.

 Fresh tremors in the morning sent the hungry and homeless running for their lives as the skeleton of this city shook.

 With much of Banda Aceh looted, people are forced to scavenge in the rubble, littered with dozens of boats tossed from the sea, as Indonesian troops patrol the streets.

 Even a soldier involved in the clean-up is armed as he drives a bulldozer ? a reminder that Aceh is a troubled province wracked by a secessionist conflict. Some residents said they had heard gunshots near the airport today. There was no confirmation, but the Indonesian military said that violent clashes had erupted in the past two days in the area.

 Longest letter, for Bush

 Washington, Aug. 24 (AFP): Whoever said letter writing is out of fashion forgot to tell thousands of US schoolchildren, who plan to roll out a half-mile-long epistle to President George W. Bush next month.

 Some 4,000 eight-to-10 year-olds from each of the 50 states and Washington DC, were asked to write to President Bush with their aspirations for Americas future in a letter. 

 The missives will be joined together to make the worlds longest letter and unveiled in a ceremony sponsored by a pen manufacturer on the US capitals national mall on September 15.

 A student, Gabe, from Morrice, Michigan, wrote: Could you lower taxes and make smoking illegal? My dad is addicted to smoking and I tell him to quit.

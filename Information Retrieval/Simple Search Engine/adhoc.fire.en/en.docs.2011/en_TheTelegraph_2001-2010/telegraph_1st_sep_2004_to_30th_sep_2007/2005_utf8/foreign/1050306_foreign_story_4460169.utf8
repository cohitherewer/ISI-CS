 No mobiles or gifts at Charles wedding

 London, March 5 (PTI): Prince Charles and his long-time companion Camilla Parker Bowles have asked their guests not to bring them gifts and refrain from carrying cameras and mobile phones at their wedding on April 8.

 Charles and Camilla have politely refused gifts because they are desperate to avoid the embarrassment of hundreds of unwanted gifts, the Daily Mirror tabloid reported today.

 After Charles married Princess Diana in 1981, the couple had to burn or gave away many of the bizarre items among their 6,000 gifts, which included a pair of pink and blue toothbrushes.

 Dianas former butler Paul Burrell, who was found not guilty in three cases of theft from the estates of Diana, Charles and Prince William, had revealed how some discarded wedding gifts were handed to royal servants during his Old Bailey trial.

 Shocked at the pictures of Prince Harry wearing a Nazi uniform at a fancy dress party, which was taken on the camera phone of another guest and sold to a newspaper, Charles and Camilla have asked guests to avoid carrying mobile phones and cameras.

 Most of Charles and Camillas 800 guests have been invited only to the blessing in St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle following the small civil ceremony at the towns guildhall. 

 A note inside the wedding invitation from the Lord Chamberlain?s office tells the invitees: ?You are reminded the use of cameras and mobile phones in royal residence are forbidden.?

 Guests will be forced to submit to potentially humiliating searches as they arrive at Windsor Castle, the report said. Police and security will be briefed to confiscate phones and cameras.

 Charles is believed to be considering selling official pictures and film footage of the ceremony to the media, with the profits going to the princes charities, the report said. But experts believe it will be impossible to stop images leaking out as any exclusive pictures would be worth tens of thousands of pounds.

 Meanwhile, the high-profile wedding faced another hurdle yesterday with the filing of nine formal objections against it. A marriage certificate cannot be issued until all objections have been dealt with.

 The deadline for filing of objections expired at 5 pm yesterday.

 MTV slammed

 Los Angeles, Feb. 2 (Reuters): American conservative watchdog group Parents Television Council has blasted MTV as ?smut peddlers?, accusing the music cable network of targeting young viewers with oversexed programming.

 The PTC found fault with the teen-targeted network based on an examination of 171 hours of programming that aired the week of March 20 last year, during its annual ?Spring Break? celebration.

 The analysis, contained in a report titled: MTV Smut Peddlers, spotted 13 sexual scenes per hour in MTV?s reality series, as well as 32 instance of foul language per hour in its music videos.

 ?There?s no question that TV influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers, and MTV is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children,? PTC president L. Brent Bozell said. The report declared reality series Making the Band 2 the channel?s most offensive series.

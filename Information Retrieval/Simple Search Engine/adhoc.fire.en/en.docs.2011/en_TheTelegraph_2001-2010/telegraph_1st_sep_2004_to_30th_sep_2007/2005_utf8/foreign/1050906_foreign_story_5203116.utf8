 Bombed sweets

 London, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Luckily, the exploding Smedleys English Red Plums in Heavy Syrup were intercepted in Turkey before anyone got killed.

 But what of the hand grenade disguised as a chocolate bar? Or the incendiary Vichy pastille sweets? A secret file from the archives of Britains spy services released this week shows ingenious methods, conjured up by Germans during World War II, for disguising bombs.

 The drawing of the design for the chocolate bar grenade says it is made from steel coated with real chocolate, and activated by breaking off a bit at one end. It doesnt say whether the grenade was ever actually manufactured or used. The file also includes photos of the incendiary pastille sweets, and bombs hidden in anything from oil cans and food tins to a lump of coal. 

 Brit best

 London (Reuters): Joseph Turners 

 The Fighting Temeraire was voted the greatest painting 

 in a British art gallery, it was announced on Monday. The 

 painting, which hangs in the National Gallery in London, 

 won 31,892 votes, more than a quarter of the 118,111 cast 

 in a poll organised by the BBC Today radio programme. 

 The Fighting Temeraire shows the 98-gun ship which 

 played a distinguished role in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar 

 being towed towards its final berth in east London in 1838 

 to be broken up. 

 White cuts

 Singapore (Reuters): The sighting of fabled white elephants in Singapores concrete jungle has sparked a police investigation into a rare public protest in the wealthy city-state. Police are trying to find out who put up large cardboard cut-outs of cartoon white elephants in a Singapore suburb last month to grab the attention of a visiting government minister. A police spokesman said on Monday police were also on the lookout for the cut-outs, which vanished on the same day that the minister spotted them outside an urban railway station.

 Train peace

 Moscow (Reuters): Even a goods train 

 rumbling over a Russian mans head failed to spoil 

 his peaceful slumber between the tracks, Interfax news agency 

 reported on Monday. The train driver saw somebody on the 

 line and braked sharply. Rescuers tried to pull the drunken 

 sleeper from underneath the carriages, but failed, and the 

 train had to carry on driving to free him. The young 

 man lying between the rails did not wake up ... which apparently 

 saved his life, said railway policeman Vladimir Slaby.

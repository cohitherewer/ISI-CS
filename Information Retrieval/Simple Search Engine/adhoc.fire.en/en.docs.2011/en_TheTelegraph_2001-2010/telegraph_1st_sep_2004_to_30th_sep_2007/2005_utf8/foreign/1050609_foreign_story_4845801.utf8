 Pak link in US arrests 

 - Father and son held

 GREG KRIKORIAN AND RONE TEMPEST

 Lodi (California), June 8: FBI agents have arrested a man and his father after the son allegedly admitted attending al Qaida training camps in Pakistan that taught participants how to kill Americans, federal authorities said yesterday.

 In a case that was still unfolding, officials confirmed that Hamid Hayat, 23, and his father, Umer, 47, were taken into custody on Sunday. Authorities said late yesterday that they were still trying to determine whether the arrests represented the discovery of a small network of al Qaida sympathisers operating in the agricultural town of Lodi, 40 miles south of Sacramento.

 The arrests came days after the younger man was discovered aboard a San Francisco-bound plane even though his name appeared on a No Fly list of suspected extremists. At the time, according to an FBI affidavit, Hayat was returning to the US after having visited Pakistan.

 According to the affidavit, he told agents that after attending al Qaida training camps in Pakistan in 2003 and 2004, he was given his pick of where to carry out his terrorist mission.

 Hamid advised that he specifically requested to come to the US to carry out his jihadi mission, the affidavit says. 

 Potential targets for attack would include hospitals and large food stores.

 While Hayat and his father remained in custody on charges of lying to federal authorities, family members denied that the ice cream truck driver or his son, who works in a fruit-packing plant, had any links to terrorism.

 The charges are totally false, said a female cousin of Hayat. 

 She said Hayats most recent trip to Pakistan had nothing to do with terrorism. Rather, she said, he went with his mother to arrange some marriages and visit relatives. 

 Hayat is the oldest of four children and was born in Lodi, according to the cousin. He went to Pakistan at the age of nine to memorise the holy Quran, she said.

 These guys have been on the radar for awhile, said one official, referring to the Hayats. And this case has more to it than just these two guys.

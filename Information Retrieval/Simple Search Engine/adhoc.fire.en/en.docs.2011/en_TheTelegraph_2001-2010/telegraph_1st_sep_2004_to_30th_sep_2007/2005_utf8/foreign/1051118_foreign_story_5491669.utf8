 Poor mans $100 laptop unveiled

 Tunis, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Researchers unveiled a $100, hand-cranked laptop computer today and said they hoped to place them in the hands of millions of schoolchildren around the globe.

 About the size of a textbook, the lime-green machines can set up their own wireless networks and operate in areas without a reliable electricity supply, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers said at a UN technology summit.

 The computers operate at 500 MHz and will run on Linux or some other open-source operating system, he said. They can be folded in different ways to serve as an electronic book, a television or a computer.

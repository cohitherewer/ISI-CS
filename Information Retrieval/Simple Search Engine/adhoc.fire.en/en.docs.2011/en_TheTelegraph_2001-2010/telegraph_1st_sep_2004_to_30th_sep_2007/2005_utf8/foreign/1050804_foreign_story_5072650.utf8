 First man charged for attacks

 London, Aug. 3 (Reuters): A 23-year-old man arrested in connection with the July 21 failed bomb attacks on Londons transport network has been charged under British terrorism laws, the police said today.

 He is the first person to be charged as part of the investigation into the attacks, but is not one of the four men suspected of being a would-be bomber.

 Ismael Abdurahman, from Kennington in south London, has been charged with hindering the police investigation by protecting a possible suspect, said a police spokeswoman. He will appear in a London court tomorrow. British police believe all four men they were hunting over the failed July 21 bombings on three underground trains and a bus have now been captured. 

 In addition to Abdurahman, British police said they were holding 14 suspects in connection with the botched attacks after a total of 37 arrests. The failed bombings came after four young British Muslim men killed themselves and 52 other people.

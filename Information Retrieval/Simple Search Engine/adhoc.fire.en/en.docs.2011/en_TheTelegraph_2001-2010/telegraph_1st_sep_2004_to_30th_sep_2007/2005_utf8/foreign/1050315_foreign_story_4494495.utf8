 Peasants moved for Rover plant

 RICHARD SPENCER

 Yizheng (China), March 14: Hundreds of peasants have been cleared off their land so a factory can be expanded to make Rover cars under the company?s proposed buy-out by the Chinese government.

 Half-a-dozen local men were arrested and briefly jailed without trial after protesting to the Communist authorities in Beijing. They were threatened with arrest again after talking to The Daily Telegraph last week.

 A handful are still refusing to accept the compensation they have been offered. They are refusing to leave their houses, some of which are blocking the path of a new road.

 Rover is in the last stages of negotiations to link up with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, China?s largest, state-owned car manufacturer. Although both sides deny it is a takeover, Rover?s remaining operations in Britain will be subsumed into a new company in which the Chinese will have a 70 per cent stake.

 In anticipation of the deal, the local authorities have handed the farmland behind the factory to a special auto industry committee. Local residents and factory workers say they have been told construction will begin on it immediately after the deal is signed, possibly as early as next month.

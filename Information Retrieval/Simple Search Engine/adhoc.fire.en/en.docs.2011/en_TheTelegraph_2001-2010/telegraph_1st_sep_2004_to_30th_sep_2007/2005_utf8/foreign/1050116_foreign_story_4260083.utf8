 Keen senses saved animals from waves

 Colombo, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Wildlife in Sri Lanka?s biggest national park survived last month?s tsunami, but it was probably keen senses and the lay of the land rather than any mysterious instinct for danger that enabled animals to scamper to safety.

 Scores of human corpses were pulled from hotels and bungalows in and around the Yala National Park in the island?s ravaged southeast, and the fact that wardens found no dead animals prompted theories that a ?sixth sense? alerted elephants, leopards and deer to the impending disaster.

 As Yala reopened to visitors this week, officials and naturalists said there was evidence that wildlife fled before the giant waves thundered ashore on December 26. But it was acute natural senses such as hearing that helped give animals time to flee, experts say.

 The beasts also stood a chance because relatively few of them lived in the arid strip of salt flat and sand dune that forms part of Yala?s southern boundary as it slopes into the sea. The dunes, reefs and mangroves may also have helped blunt the impact.

 ?I have been cruising around the park for a few days now and I have not even seen one carcass, not even one of a water buffalo,? Daya Kariyawasam, director-general of wildlife and conservation, said today. ?All the animals appear to have fled before the tsunami struck,? he added.

 The walls of water triggered by an earthquake off Sumatra killed almost 31,000 people in Sri Lanka and virtually obliterated the fishing town of Hambantota, near Yala. The belief that animals have a sixth sense for danger is an ancient one, but experts say it has never been proved.

 Although that theory is likely to gain credence as a result of what happened at Yala, some naturalists believe there may be a more scientific explanation. Naturalist Gehan de Silva Wijeratne said an acute sense of hearing would have warned animals of the tsunamis approach. ?It would have given them that crucial few seconds,? he said.

 Many animals are able to detect ground vibrations imperceptible to humans.

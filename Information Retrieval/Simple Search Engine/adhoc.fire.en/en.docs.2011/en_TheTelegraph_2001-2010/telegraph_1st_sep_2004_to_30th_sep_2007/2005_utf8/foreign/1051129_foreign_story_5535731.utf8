 Lanka in peace offer to Tigers

 Colombo, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse said today he was willing to start immediate talks with Tamil Tiger rebels on improving a 2002 ceasefire, the day after the rebels made what many said was a veiled war threat.

 Peace talks have been stalled since 2003 and violence in the minority Tamil north and east has grown. Yesterday, rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran said that, without a new political deal, the Tigers would intensify their struggle in the new year.

 But in his annual Heroes Day address, he also said Rajapakse ? a perceived hardliner whose Buddhist and Marxist allies loathe the rebels ? had a reputation as a pragmatist, and that the Tigers would wait to see what he had to say.

 I welcome Mr Prabhakarans remarks yesterday recognising my pragmatic approach, and my invitation to talks, as extending the hand of friendship, Rajapakse told diplomats in Colombo.

 Rajapakse has repeatedly said he wants the ceasefire redrawn to stop what he last week called terrorist acts. The Tigers have said that any tampering with the ceasefire could cause it to collapse, but the President said he was willing to discuss any changes with them.

 We can resume work immediately on reviewing the operation of the ceasefire while we prepare ourselves for eventual substantial talks leading to a lasting solution, he said. These processes can work in parallel, not necessarily sequentially.

 Grenade attacks on army outposts in the north and east have mounted in recent months. Some analysts say that, with neither side seen likely to back down, return to a war that has already killed some 64,000 looks increasingly likely.

 Rajapakse has already said he does not believe the Tamil people should have their own homeland, and many analysts doubt he will make any concessions to the rebels, de facto rulers of a seventh of Sri Lanka.

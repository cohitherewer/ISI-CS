 Kylie sets comeback date 

 Kylie: Set to rock again

 Sydney, Nov. 22 (AP): Pop diva Kylie Minogue will hold her homecoming Australian tour at the end of next year, after cancelling the event earlier this year when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, her promoter said.

 The London-based, 37-year-old singer had returned to her hometown in Melbourne to perform her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits tour in May when she was diagnosed. 

 Minogue underwent surgery in a Melbourne hospital to remove the cancer, and doctors said it was a success. 

 Her Australian tour promoter, The Frontier Touring Company, announced on Sunday that the tour would begin at the end of 2006. 

 We appreciate that the end of next year is a long time away for ticket holders and the option of refunding tickets will remain available to fans, Gudinski said.

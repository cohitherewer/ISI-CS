 Home PCs targeted in war against spam

 Washington, May 25 (Reuters): Home computer users who unwittingly send out spam e-mail should be disconnected from the Internet until their machines are fixed, the US Federal Trade Commission said yesterday.

 The FTC said it would ask 3,000 Internet providers around the globe to make sure that their customers computers havent been hijacked by spammers who want to cover their tracks and pass bandwidth costs on to others.

 Online viruses like SoBig turn infected computers into spam-spewing zombies that send out millions of unwanted messages without the owners knowledge. Zombie networks are responsible for 50 per cent to 80 per cent of all spam, according to various estimates. Because many home users lack the technical smarts to fight the problem on their own, the FTC hopes their Internet providers will help, although they are not required to do so.

 Internet providers should identify computers on their networks that are sending out large amounts of e-mail and quarantine them if they are found to be zombies, the FTC said. 

 They should also help customers clean their machines and tell them how to keep them safe in the first place, the FTC said.

 The FTC said Internet providers should route all customer e-mail through their own servers, which could upset more technically proficient users who run their own e-mail servers.

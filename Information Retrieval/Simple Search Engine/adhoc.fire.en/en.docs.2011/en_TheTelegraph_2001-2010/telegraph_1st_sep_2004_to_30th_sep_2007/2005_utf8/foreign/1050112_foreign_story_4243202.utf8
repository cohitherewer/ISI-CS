 Labour MPs tell leaders: get in line

 Finance minister Gordon Brown (left) and Prime Minister Tony Blair

 London, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Chastened by a roasting from their own parliamentarians, Britain?s squabbling Labour leaders organised a show of unity today with finance minister Gordon Brown insisting he did trust Prime Minister Tony Blair.

 Just four months before an expected election, relations between the two men have plumbed new depths with a new book chronicling a furious row about who should lead the government. Labour lawmakers believe their squabbling has become so overt, it may start to cost them votes and seats.

 Brown and Blair?s election supremo Alan Milburn ? anything but close political bedfellows ? launched a pre-election campaign today lauding the government?s economic record. But the glowing facts and figures did little to hide the fact that just hours before, Blair and Brown had been lambasted by Labour parliamentarians.

 At a stormy meeting last evening, several attacked the pair for jeopardising the party?s election drive.

 One described them as having received a ?scorching?, another told Brown to rebut a statement, attributed to him in journalist Robert Peston?s book, that he could never trust Blair again.

 ?Of course I trust the Prime Minister,? Brown said today. ?I have worked very closely with him, and I have done so for the last 20 years, and I will continue to do so.?

 Blair?s spokesman said: ?I don?t think you can get more definitive than that.?

 Witnesses said Blair was chastened by yesterday?s battering from his followers, saying he had got the message.

 But the days when government officials could blame split stories on media myth-making are long gone. Even deputy Prime Minister John Prescott admitted a few home truths were delivered. ?They told them very clearly, troops to the leaders: get in line,? he told BBC radio. ?They want to see unity of purpose.?

 The antagonism flared again last week as a Blair news conference overshadowed a major speech by Brown and Peston?s book claimed Blair had told Brown over a year ago he would make way for him late in 2004 ? a story that has become accepted as fact in British political circles.

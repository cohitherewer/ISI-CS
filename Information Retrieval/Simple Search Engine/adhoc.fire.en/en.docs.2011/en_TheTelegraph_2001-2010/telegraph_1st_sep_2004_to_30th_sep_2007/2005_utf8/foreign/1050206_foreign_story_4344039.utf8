 Iraq urges UN to return money

Schiavulli said she had been talking to kidnapped Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena when she was abducted in Baghdad on Friday. ?She called me as the kidnappers were taking her away. I heard the shots and shouted: ?Giuliana, Giuliana?, but she didn?t reply,? Schiavulli said. (AFP)

 United Nations, Feb. 5 (Reuters): Iraq said it wanted its money back from the scandal-tainted UN oil-for-food programme yesterday as secretary-general Kofi Annan vowed to get to the bottom of wrongdoing by UN staff.

 ?Huge sums of money which should have served the needs of the Iraqi people who were suffering at that time ? a lot of these resources were squandered and misspent,? said Iraq?s UN ambassador, Samir Sumaidaie.

 Iraq, he said, should at minimum not have to pay for the independent probe set up by the UN from remaining oil-for-food funds. The inquiry panel has spent $30 million so far, with the approval of the Security Council.

 A new report by Paul Volcker, the former US federal reserve chairman appointed by Annan to probe the $67 billion programme, found that the director of the plan, Benon Sevan, helped steer oil contracts to a relative of former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

 The report does not accuse any UN officials of getting bribes. But it says Sevan received $160,000 from an aunt in Cyrus, who has since died and had few resources. ?We are as determined as everyone to get to the bottom of this. We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN,? Annan said as he arrived at headquarters. Annan said UN officials would be disciplined and diplomatic immunity would be lifted if criminal acts were committed.

 Among other questionable deals in the report was one in which another UN official, Joseph Stephanides, colluded with a former British UN ambassador so that Lloyd?s Register Inspection Ltd. could get a lucrative contract. Volcker said Stephanides was anxious to get the programme underway.

 The report said a more thorough audit of the humanitarian programme might have uncovered cheating by Saddam Hussein?s government. A CIA report estimated that Saddam skimmed $1.7 billion from the programme and another $8 billion through illegal oil sales outside it.

8 soldiers killed

 Insurgent attacks killed eight Iraqi soldiers today as guerrillas stayed on the offensive after failing to scupper last week?s historic election.

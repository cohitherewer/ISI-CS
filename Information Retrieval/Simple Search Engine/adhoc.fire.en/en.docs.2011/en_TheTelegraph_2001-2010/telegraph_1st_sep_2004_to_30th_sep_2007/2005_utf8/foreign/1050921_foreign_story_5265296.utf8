 Nazi hunter Wiesenthal dead

 Wiesenthal: Conscience of the Holocaust

 Vienna, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Simon Wiesenthal, the veteran Nazi hunter who tirelessly tracked down Nazi war criminals for more than six decades, has died in Vienna at the age of 96, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said today.

 In a campaign aimed at ensuring the world did not forget the terrors of the Third Reich, Wiesenthal brought 1,100 Nazi fugitives to trial. Among them was Adolf Eichmann, the man entrusted by Adolf Hitler with carrying out the Nazi genocide programme against the Jews.

 Simon Wiesenthal acted to bring justice to those who had escaped justice, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev said. In doing so, he was the voice of 6 million.

 Altogether the Nazis are estimated to have murdered 11 million civilians, including 6 million Jews.

 Wiesenthal died in his sleep, Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said by phone. 

 Wiesenthal, born in 1908 in what is now Ukraine, travelled the world into his old age, lecturing on the Holocaust and as director of the Jewish Documentation Centre collecting data on the whereabouts of the last unpunished villains of Nazi Germany.

 Himself a Jew and former concentration camp inmate, Wiesenthal founded the Jewish Documentation Centre in his post-war home Austria. 

 There he built up an information network which he used to uncover and pin evidence on those responsible for World War II atrocities.

 He maintained that his motivation was not anger but justice. I am someone who seeks justice, not revenge, Wiesenthal said.

 His legacy is that he will be regarded by many as the conscience of the Holocaust, Hier said. 

 Speaking of Wiesenthals role as a Nazi hunter, Hier added: He just took the job, nobody appointed him, nobody else wanted it.

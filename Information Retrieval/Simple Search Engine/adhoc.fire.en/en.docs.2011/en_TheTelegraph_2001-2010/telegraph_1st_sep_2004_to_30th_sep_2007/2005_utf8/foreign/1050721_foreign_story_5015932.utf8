 Mayor: West to blame

 ANDREW SPARROW

 Ken Livingstone

 London, July20: Ken Livingstone yesterday blamed western policies for contributing to the spread of the extremist beliefs that inspired the London bombers.

 The mayor of London highlighted the Wests role in the creation of al Qaida by saying: We created these people. We built them up. We funded them.

 His comments coincided with remarks from Muslim extremists that went much further, claiming that ministers were the real terrorists and that voters were to blame for the attacks because they returned Tony Blair to power.

 Livingstone has condemned the London bombings in the strongest terms, and immediately after the attack he was widely praised for the way he spoke up on behalf of all Londoners.

 But yesterday he abandoned his consensual approach when he claimed that western policies in West Asia, Afghanistan and Iraq may have influenced the bombers.

 Livingstone said: This particular strand of extremism was funded by the West in Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden was just another businessman until he was recruited by the CIA.

 I suspect the real problem was that we funded these people, as long as they were killing Russians. We gave no thought to the fact that when they stopped killing Russians they might start killing us.

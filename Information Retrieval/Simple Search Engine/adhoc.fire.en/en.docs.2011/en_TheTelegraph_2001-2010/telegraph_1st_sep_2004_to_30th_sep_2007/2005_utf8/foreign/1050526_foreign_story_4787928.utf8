 Fine Print

 Courting clergy

 Tehran, May 25 (Reuters): Iranian cleric and presidential candidate Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has picked a clergy-bashing filmmaker to direct his electoral broadcasts.

 Director Kamal Tabrizi said today he had agreed to make a 30-minute film for Rafsanjani, an ex-president tipped to win the June 17 poll. Tabrizis The Lizard was a mordant satire on Irans turbanned establishment. It proved a hit with with cinema-goers but was quickly withdrawn from screens.

 It told the tale of a thief who escapes prison by donning the turban and robes of a mullah. Ironically, he proves a crowd pleaser as a preacher.

 I think Rafsanjani had a positive attitude towards The Lizard, Tabrizi said, when asked why he had been chosen. He declined to give a sneak-preview into the contents of Rafsanjanis electoral broadcast.

 Long law

 London (Reuters): A British lawyer will 

 conclude later what is believed to be the longest speech 

 in the countrys legal history, breaking the record 

 set last year by his rival in the same protracted courtroom 

 wrangle. Nicholas Stadlen has spent 119 days presenting 

 the case for the Bank of England which is defending an ?850 

 million compensation claim by creditors of collapsed Bank 

 of Credit and Commerce International, The Guardian 

 said. A five-foot high stack of files has grown between 

 the two legal teams.

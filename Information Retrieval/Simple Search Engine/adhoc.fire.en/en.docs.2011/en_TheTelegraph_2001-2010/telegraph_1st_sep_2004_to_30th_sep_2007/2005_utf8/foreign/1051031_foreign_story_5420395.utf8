 Da Vinci Code faces truth test

 AMIT ROY

 Audrey Tautou and 

 Tom Hanks: Holy pair 

 London, Oct. 30: The trial will begin in the high court in London on February 27 next year to decide whether Dan Brown, author of the biggest selling book of modern times, The Da Vinci Code, stole the idea of Jesus Christ marrying Mary Magdalene and having a child with her from a 1982 work of non-fiction.

 The legal action has been brought against Random House Inc., publishers of The Da Vinci Code, by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.

 Baigent and Leigh wrote their book with a third author, Henry Lincoln, who is not taking part in the claim due to ill-health. 

 Lawyers for Baigent and Leigh will argue that Brown took the notion of Jesus having a child with Mary Magdalene from their book without any acknowledgement.

 A spokeswoman for Baigent and Leigh said the authors had been struck by alleged similarities to their history book. The basis of their case is theft of intellectual property. There are huge chunks of The Da Vinci Code which they say is lifted from their book. 

 The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail features cryptically coded parchments, secret societies, the Knights Templar and links them to a dynasty of obscure French kings and the Holy Grail, she said. 

 The counter argument will be that the idea that Jesus married and had a baby has been around in the public domain for hundreds of years and that Baigent and Leigh are simply trying to cash in on the astonishing success of The Da Vinci Code which has sold an estimated 40 million copies worldwide.

 Unless there is an out-of-court settlement, Baigment and Leigh will be asked whether their idea is really as original as they claim it to be or they, in turn, stole the notion.

 What is ironical is that Century Books, which is part of Random House, published The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and recently even reissued the book, no doubt to encourage fresh sales on the back of the popularity of The Da Vinci Code.

 It has been revealed that Brown, now recognised as the worlds highest paid author, earned ?45million last year. He stands to make even more money soon because a film adaptation of his novel, starring Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou and directed by Ron Howard, is due to be released next year. 

 There was trouble over some British locations but principal photography has now been completed in the UK.

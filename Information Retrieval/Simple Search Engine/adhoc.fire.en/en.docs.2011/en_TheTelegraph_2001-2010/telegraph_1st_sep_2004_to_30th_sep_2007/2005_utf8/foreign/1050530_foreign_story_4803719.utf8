 Tangled tale of Lindbergh love life 

 BOJAN PANCEVSKI 

 Lindbergh 

 Munich, May 29: The extraordinary, tangled love life of American aviator Charles Lindbergh, the first pilot to fly non-stop across the Atlantic, has been revealed by the three illegitimate children whose existence he kept secret for almost 20 years.

 They have disclosed intimate details about Lindberghs affairs in which he fathered children not only by their mother, Brigitte, but also her sister, Marietta, and, allegedly, his private secretary.

 Dyrk and David Hesshaimer and their sister, Astrid Bouteuil, now middle-aged, were born and grew up in Germany without ever being told their fathers true identity. 

 In a new book, The Secret Life of Charles A. Lindbergh, they reveal how the dashing aviators 17-year relationship with Brigitte lasted even after he fathered two children with her sister, Marietta. 

 Although Lindbergh had professed admiration for Nazi Germany in the 1930s and supported ideas about eugenics, his passion for the women outweighed any prejudice: the book reveals that both sisters suffered walking disabilities as a result of childhood illness.

 I am aware that our actions have tainted the image of an impeccable American hero, said Astrid, 44. But they also reveal that a man once thought of as emotionless and unattainable was in fact a caring and loving father.

 Lindbergh was 55 and seemingly happily married to his American wife, Anne Morrow, when he met Brigitte and Marietta at a dinner party in Munich in 1957. He and Anne had six children, their marriage apparently surviving the tragic death of their son, Charles, who at 20 months old was abducted and killed in 1932.

 Yet according to Rudolf Schroeck, the books author, over dinner Lindbergh fell for Brigitte, a 31-year-old hat maker. The sisters were friends of his secretary, Valeska, with whom he was already embroiled in a relationship, said Schroeck.

 Their tempestuous affair end ed only with his death in 1974. Although Lindbergh did not live in Germany, he regularly visited Brigitte in Munich and took her to his secret flat in Rome, previously used for trysts with Valeska.

 Lindberghs sons by Marietta ? Vago, 45, and Christoph, 39 ? have remained silent about their parents, in accordance with their mothers wishes.

 According to Schroeck, Lindbergh also had two children with Valeska but their identities are unknown. None of the three women married.

 Schroeck said: Valeska and Marietta have not taken part in the book as they want to honour the vow of secrecy given to Lindbergh.

 Astrid said: People may wonder about his treatment of his wife and my mother, but the fact that we exist testifies to the fact that he was simply a man ? not a hero.

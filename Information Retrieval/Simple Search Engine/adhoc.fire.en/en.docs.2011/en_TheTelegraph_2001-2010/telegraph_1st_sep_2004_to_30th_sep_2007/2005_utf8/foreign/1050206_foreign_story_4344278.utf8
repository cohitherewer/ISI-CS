 Search starts for new Bond 

 Clive Owen

 Los Angeles, Feb. 5 (Reuters): The search is on for a young actor to fill the tuxedo of agent 007 in the next James Bond film, Casino Royale, to be based on Ian Fleming?s first novel about the suave British spy with a licence to kill.

 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. said yesterday that filmmaker Martin Campbell has signed on to direct the 21st Bond movie, paving the way for casting to succeed Pierce Brosnan, 51, as the star of the multibillion-dollar film franchise. Campbell directed Brosnan in his debut as Bond in the 1995 film GoldenEye.

 MGM and the producers behind the Bond franchise said no decision has been made about casting. Brosnan has suggested that fellow Irish actor Colin Farrell would be ideal for the role, but Farrell has said he was uninterested.

 Other young actors whose names have surfaced as possible replacements include Ewan McGregor, Hugh Jackman, Jude Law, Eric Bana and Clive Owen. Earlier big-screen incarnations of the British agent were played by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and George Lazenby.

 Production on Casino Royale, slated for release in 2006, will start as soon as the New Zealand-born Campbell wraps up filming on his sequel to The Mask of Zorro.

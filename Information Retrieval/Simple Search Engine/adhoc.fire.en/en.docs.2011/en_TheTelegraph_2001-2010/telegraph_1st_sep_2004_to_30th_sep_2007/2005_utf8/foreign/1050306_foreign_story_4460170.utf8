 Drop in Indians studying in UK

London, March 5 (PTI): The number of foreign 

students studying at British universities, particularly Indians, has dropped sharply 

due to hike in visa extension costs and bad publicity about immigration laws, 

a media report said.

 A survey by Universities UK (UUK), the umbrella body for British Higher Education Institutes, shows a dramatic drop in the number of students from Asia, particularly India, enrolling for post graduate courses.

 The survey shows a drop of up to 50 per cent in students coming from China, The Financial Times reported today. 

 Quoting the admissions departments, it said there has been a greater decline in recruiting to post-graduate research posts and courses than to undergraduate programmes.

 Recruitment from India, China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, the US, Thailand, Norway, Turkey and Singapore has been hurt by increased visa extension costs and bad publicity surrounding immigration regime changes as well as the strength of sterling, the UUK said.

 The association called on the British government to follow the US, which last month abandoned tighter immigration policies after Ivy League and state universities experienced significant recruitment difficulties.

 According to UUK, fees from students from outside the European Union provide seven per cent of the higher education budget. Many institutions are dependent on this income.

 Oxford University announced in January that it planned to cut its intake of British students and increase the numbers of non-Europeans entering its colleges as it needed to raise funds to keep its status as one of the worlds best institutes of higher learning.

 Police charged two men and a woman today with a plot to fund terrorism.

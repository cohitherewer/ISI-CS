 Hookahs bad for teeth: Study

 New York, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Though water pipes are widely viewed as a safer way to smoke, they may be as damaging to the teeth and gums as cigarettes are, a new study suggests.

 Water pipes, or hookahs, have long been used for smoking tobacco in West Asia, North Africa and parts of Asia, and hookah lounges are increasingly popping up in the US and other countries.

 The pipes consist of a long tube attached to a glass or plastic container that holds water in its base. The tobacco, which is flavoured with fruits and sugar syrup, is burned using charcoal. Because the smoke passes through the water before the smoker inhales it, water pipes are believed by some to filter out the harmful substances in tobacco smoke.

 However, water pipe smoke contains the same toxins as cigarette smoke, the authors of the new study point out in their report in the Journal of Periodontology. And past studies have suggested that hookah smoking increases heart rate and blood pressure and impairs lung function.

 To see if water pipes are as tough on the teeth as cigarettes are, Suzan Natto and her colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, studied 262 adults in Saudi Arabia, where hookah smoking is widespread.

 Overall, 31 per cent smoked water pipes exclusively, while 19 per cent smoked only cigarettes. Another 20 per cent used both smoking methods, and the rest ? 30 per cent ? were non-smokers.

 The researchers found that about 20 per cent of all study participants had signs of gum disease, which is marked by inflammation and redness in the gums in its earlier stages, and, later, destruction of the bones and soft tissue supporting the teeth.

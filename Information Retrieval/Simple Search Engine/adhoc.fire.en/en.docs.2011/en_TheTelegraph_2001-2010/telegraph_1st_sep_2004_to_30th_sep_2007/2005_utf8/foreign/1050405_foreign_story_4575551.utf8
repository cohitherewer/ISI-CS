 Islamabad, April 4 (Reuters): Pakistan?s navy signed contracts today to have four frigates built in China, the defence ministry said on the eve of a visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.

 The F-22P frigates would be equipped with helicopters for anti-submarine warfare and with surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, a ministry statement said.

 It did not say how much the contracts were worth or when the frigates would be ready, but it described the deal as a breakthrough in defence cooperation between Pakistan and China. The ships would enhance the navy?s operational capabilities and boost Pakistan?s maritime defence, the ministry said. The announcement came on the eve of Wen?s three-day visit.

 China is a long-time ally of Pakistan and its main supplier of military equipment. In recent years, China has also improved relations with India, which Wen will visit from April 9 .

 ?The navy has been looking for frigates for a long time, this is one of its major deficiencies,? said former Pakistani general and defence commentator Talat Masood. 

 Violent clash

 Pakistani police lobbed tear gas and fired shots in the air yesterday to disperse a violent protest by an Islamic Opposition alliance on the participation of women with men in a mini-marathon race, state-run media said.

 The clashes erupted in the eastern city of Gujranwala after activists of the MMA alliance attacked men and women contesting the race with batons.

 UK in partial smoking ban

 London, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Britain unveiled new anti-smoking laws today but failed to impose a total ban on lighting up in workplaces after a heated debate in Prime Minister Tony Blairs Labour party.

 Widespread reports of squabbling over the issue in cabinet have prompted some analysts to wonder whether Blair, having set the clock ticking on his departure, is losing his iron grip over his government. Health secretary Patricia Hewitt announced the ban would cover most ? but not all ? of Englands pubs, bars and restaurants.

 That would put England at odds with Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland who have either fully banned smoking in public places or announced plans to do so. Anti-smoking groups were outraged with Englands bill, saying it did not go far enough while pub management groups warned it could slash their profits. 

 The chairman of the British Medical Association James Johnson, expressed his utter disappointment at the wasted opportunity to protect the publics health. Even Hewitt was forced to concede: Many of us would have liked to go that little bit further.

 Under the new bill, smoking would be banned in restaurants and bars where food is served but private clubs will be exempt and pubs serving no food will be able to choose whether to allow smoking.

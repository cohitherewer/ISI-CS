 2 killed in Kuwait gunbattle

 Kuwait, Jan. 30 (Reuters): A security officer and a militant were killed in a gunbattle in US-ally Kuwait today, the latest clash in the oil-rich Gulf state facing a surge in al Qaida-linked violence.

 The shootout, in which a bystander from Bahrain also died, erupted when special forces raided a residential building where militants believed to be loyal to al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden were hiding.

 It was the third clash with militants this month in Kuwait, which controls a tenth of global oil reserves, was the launchpad for the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and liberated from Iraqi forces by a US-led coalition in the 1991 Gulf War.

 Four policemen and a militant were wounded in the fight in the Salmiya district where many foreigners live, and two militants were arrested, an interior ministry statement said.

 State television showed footage of the dead militant ? identified as Nasser al-Enezi.

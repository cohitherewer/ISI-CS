 Cruz cracks beauty myth

 HELENA DE BERTODANO 

 Penelope Cruz: Earthy seductress

 Pen?lope Cruz was once described by Ralph Lauren as ?the best-looking human being I have ever seen?. Now she?s sitting in a West Hollywood caf? near her home, drinking decaffeinated cappuccino and listing her physical shortcomings with the help of her 19-year-old brother, Eduardo. 

 ?My brother thinks I have a lazy eye,? she says, with a giggle. ?I watched a lot of movies as a child. I felt the political change in my country through them.? 

 She is en route to the gym and is clad in a white Juicy Couture towelling tracksuit, a long cream Puma padded jacket and a thick woolly Mexican hat, which she does not remove, even inside. It is an odd ensemble: she looks more like an Eskimo than a Hollywood superstar. 

 But a superstar she is. Like Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, the 30-year-old has managed to become that rare thing: a European actress who has made it on to the Hollywood A-list, playing opposite the pick of America?s actors: Johnny Depp in Blow (2001), Nicolas Cage in Captain Corellis Mandolin (2001) and Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky (2001). Her reputation for enchanting her leading men ? particularly Cruise, with whom she had a three-year relationship after Vanilla Sky ? has done no harm to her burgeoning fame. 

 Cruz and Cruise split up last January and she is now going out with the Texan actor Matthew McConaughey, whom she met last year while making the upcoming film Sahara. But she and Cruise remain close. ?He?s forever my friend,? Cruz says today. ?He?s a very good person.?

 On the whole, though, she does not like to talk about her relationships, and is irritated because a recent article claims that she ?confirmed? she was dating McConaughey. ?I didn?t confirm anything,? says Cruz, who talks in fluent but heavily accented English, with the occasional Spanish word thrown in. ?If they see us together, bueno, they see us together. But I don?t talk about it. It has nothing to do with my job.?

 Such reticence is at odds with the endearingly natural and adult approach Cruz generally adopts towards the business of being a star. 

 The only hint of glamour is the large diamond-encrusted ring she wears on the first finger of her right hand. ?It comes from me,? says Cruz.

 Cruz?s essential earthiness is reflected in the films she has made. Where Julia Roberts fretted that the sexually explicit lines she had to utter in Closer would make it impossible for her to remain ?America?s sweetheart?, Cruz has had no compunction about playing thoroughly sophisticated, old European parts: her first major film role, at the age of 17, was as a teenage seductress in Jam?Jam?, a sexual farce which made Cruz?s name in Spain. 

 Pedro Almod?var later cast her in two of his films, Live Flesh (1997), in which she plays a prostitute who dies giving birth on a bus, and All About my Mother (1999), in which she plays a nun made pregnant by a transvestite and infected with AIDS. 

 Recently she has made Head in the Clouds, a drama in which she plays a Spanish Civil War refugee who has a lesbian affair with Charlize Theron. ?I like to do material that is risky and different,? she says. ?I?m not scared of anything. I don?t care how difficult, how challenging, how controversial a role is? Also I have a physicality that changes a lot so I don?t always look good ? which is good for my acting.? 

 Cruz, of course, has embraced life, though hers has not always been a life of privilege: ?I didn?t grow up as a millionaire, my parents had to work very hard to raise us.? The family lived in the Madrid suburb of Alcobendas. As well as her brother, Eduardo, she has one younger sister.

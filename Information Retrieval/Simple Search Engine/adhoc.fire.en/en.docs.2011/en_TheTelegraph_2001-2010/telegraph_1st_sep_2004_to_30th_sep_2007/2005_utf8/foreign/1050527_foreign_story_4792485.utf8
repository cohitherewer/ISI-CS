 Russia heat on power CEO

 Anatoly Chubais

 Moscow, May 26 (Reuters): Prosecutors summoned Anatoly Chubais, head of Russias electricity monopoly, for questioning today after opening a criminal case over a power outage that closed the stock exchange and crippled public transport.

 Chubais, chief executive of Unified Energy System (UES), is expected to be questioned as a witness and not as a suspect in the negligence case, which under Russian law must be opened to enable investigators to launch a full-scale probe.

 UES said Chubais, one of Russias best known public figures later than originally planned, giving him more time to bring the metropolitan power crisis under control.

 A sub-station blast paralysed much of Moscow and surrounding regions yesterday, stranding 20,000 people in the citys underground rail system. Traffic light failures triggered a spate of road accidents and snarled traffic into late evening.

 UES, which runs the worlds fourth-largest power network, said it had lifted all restrictions on power supplies to Moscow by lunchtime today.

 Chubais, 49, faced a storm of criticism today from the Kremlin-dominated establishment led by President Vladimir Putin.

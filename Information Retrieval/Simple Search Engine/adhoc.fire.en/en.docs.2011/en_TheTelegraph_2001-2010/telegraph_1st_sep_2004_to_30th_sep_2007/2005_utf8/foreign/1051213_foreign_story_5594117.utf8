 Bush banks on Iraq polls

 Philadelphia, Dec. 12 (Reuters): President George W. Bush acknowledged setbacks today in efforts to create a democracy in Iraq but said elections this week will help the country mark a turning point in East Asia.

 Bush struck a realistic tone in a question-and-answer session, predicting insurgent violence will not end with Thursdays parliamentary polls and saying much work remains to make Iraqs fledgling democracy inclusive to all.

 He also said about 30,000 Iraqis have been killed since the US-led invasion in March 2003, and he denounced the presence of jails in Iraq where mostly Sunni men were held, some of whom have appeared to have been beaten and tortured.

 This conduct is unacceptable, and the prime minister and other Iraqi officials have condemned these abuses, and an investigation has been launched and we support these efforts, Bush said.

 The Iraqi government said earlier today that 13 prisoners found in another Baghdad jail, in addition to a secret bunker found last month and operated by the interior ministry, showed signs of abuse. 

 Bush needs a relatively smooth showing during the elections in Iraq to hold up as a sign of progress and try to counter daily news of suicide bombings and US troop deaths.

 Bush is fighting to get his second term back on track after a year in which Americans lost faith in his ability to manage the war and a growing number came to believe his administration misled them in making the case for the US-led invasion.

 No nation in history has made the transition to a free society without facing challenges, setbacks and false starts, Bush said.

 Its a remarkable transformation for a country that has virtually no experience with democracy and which is struggling to overcome the legacy of one of the worst tyrannies the world has known, he said.

 The speech was Bushs latest attempt to try to bolster support for his Iraq strategy among Americans skeptical of his leadership.

 Speaking at an event hosted by the World Affairs Council, a private, non-profit, non-partisan educational organization, Bush repeated thatwe will accept nothing less than complete victory against what he described as terrorism in Iraq.

 His figure for the death toll among Iraqis was in the range given by Iraq Body Count, a U.S.-British non-government group, which currently says between 27,383 and 30,892 civilians ? rather than all Iraqi citizens ? have been killed in Iraq since the invasion.

 Its figures are based on media reports, which often fail to capture all deaths in the country. Other estimates, including one done by scientists and published in the medical journal Lancet, put the civilian death toll at as high as 100,000.

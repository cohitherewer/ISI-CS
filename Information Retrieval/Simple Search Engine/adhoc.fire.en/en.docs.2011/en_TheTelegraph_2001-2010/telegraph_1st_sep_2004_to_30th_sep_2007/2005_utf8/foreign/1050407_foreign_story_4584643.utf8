 Virtual Charlize

 Los Angeles, April 6 (Reuters): Oscar winner Charlize Theron is the latest actor to go virtual.

 In addition to starring as sexy 

 agent Aeon Flux in the Paramount Pictures film coming to 

 theatres this winter, it was confirmed yesterday that she 

 will provide the voice and likeness for Majesco?s Aeon 

 Flux video game. 

 The game, which serves as a prequel to the film, will tie together Aeon Flux creator Peter Chung?s animated TV series, which aired on MTV from 1992-97, and the liveaction movie directed by Karyn Kusama. ?By including the voice talent and likeness of Charlize Theron, we hope to provide consumers with a product that seamlessly fits within the world of Aeon Flux yet offers an interactive component that complements its entertainment counterparts,? Majesco president Jesse Sutton said. 

 Ban bother

 Boise, Idaho (Reuters): An Idaho strip 

 club that attempted to get around a ban on full nudity by 

 giving patrons sketch pads for special ?art nights? was 

 cited for violating the city?s nudity rules. The citation 

 was issued on Monday night to the Erotic City Gentleman?s 

 Club in Boise, Idaho. Boise allows full nudity for ?serious 

 artistic? expression only, so the club handed out pencils 

 and sketch pads to patrons so they could sketch naked women. 

 A police spokeswoman said officials concluded, however, 

 that patrons were not focused on art, so officers cited 

 three dancers for violations of the city nudity ordinance. 

 ?The case is being reviewed by the Boise city attorney for 

 the possibility of future citations,? said spokeswoman Lynn 

 Hightower.

 Fine Print

 Blind banking

 Dublin, May 16 (Reuters): A Northern Ireland bank has adapted cash machines for the blind and partially sighted.

 The Northern Bank in Belfast has equipped two of its ATM cash points with a device that allows visually impaired people to plug headphones into a jack on the front of the machine and receive instructions on its use.

 automated voice guides the customer to the exact locations of the required keypad numbers. If the six-month pilot scheme ? which began today ? proves successful, the bank will consider extending the service, a spokeswoman said.

 The Royal National Institute of the Blind hailed the scheme as a real breakthrough.

 Horse trick

 Rome (Reuters): Italian police have 

 discovered a mob-linked race track where they say horses 

 were pumped full of Viagra and other drugs to fix races. 

 The illegally built and operated track, known locally as 

 Miss Charmet, is located on the outskirts of 

 Naples city ? home to the Camorra, the local version of 

 the Sicilian Mafia. We are able to ascertain the use 

 of the famous (drug) Viagra to increase the performance 

 of these horses, the police said. It was not clear 

 how Viagra affected the horses speed.

 Signal risk

 London (Reuters): Mobile phones could pose a higher health risk to rural dwellers because they emit more intense signals in the countryside, Swedish scientists said on Tuesday. Base stations tend to be further apart in more remote areas so the phones compensate with stronger signals. We found that the risk of brain tumour was higher for people living in rural areas than in towns, said Prof. Lennart Hardell, of University Hospital in Orebro, Sweden. The stronger the signal, the higher the risk, said.

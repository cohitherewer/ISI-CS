 Jackson ?gave wine to victim?

 Santa Maria (California), March 4 (Reuters): The sister of Michael Jackson?s young accuser told jurors at his sex abuse trial today she once stumbled on the pop star serving wine to her brother and two other young boys in a secret cellar at his Neverland Valley Ranch.

 The girl, now an 18-year-old college student, described the scene as she recounted a week the family spent at Neverland in February 2003.

 The girl?s testimony offered jurors the first direct account of the events at Neverland around the time prosecutors say Jackson sexually abused her brother. The girl said she was mostly left alone while her two brothers spent most of their time during that week with Jackson. 

 ?Me and my brother are very close and this all just felt like he didnt want to talk to me, he didnt want to be near me, he was distant,? she said. ?It felt weird. I just knew something.?

 The sister said Jackson and the boys made her feel unwelcome when she tried to spend time with them but that once she followed as they went down a flight of stairs hidden behind a jukebox in Neverlands arcade room. She found Jackson in a wine cellar, pouring wine into cups for himself, her brothers and another boy.

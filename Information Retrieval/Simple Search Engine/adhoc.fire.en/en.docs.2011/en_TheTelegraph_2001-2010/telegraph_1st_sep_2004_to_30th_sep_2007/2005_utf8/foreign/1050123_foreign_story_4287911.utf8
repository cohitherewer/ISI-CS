 Petty theft cloud on Paris Hilton

 MONTE MORIN

 Paris Hilton: The simple truth?

Los Angeles, Jan. 22: Hotel heiress and television 

personality Paris Hilton could face petty theft charges in connection with the 

alleged robbery of a DVD from a West Hollywood newsstand, according to the Los 

Angeles police.

 Sheriff?s detectives are investigating a December 15 incident in which Hilton visited the Swing News newsstand on Sunset Boulevard and allegedly spotted a sex tape DVD that featured her and a former boyfriend.

 Hilton, who has said that she never wanted the tape to become public, allegedly became enraged and grabbed the DVD, authorities said.

 ?According to the manager, she grabbed the DVD and told him she wasn?t paying,? said detective Vivian May. ?When the manager pointed out that the stand also carried a framed poster featuring the cover of the DVD, Hilton shouted to two men parked in a vehicle in front of the business. The men got out of the vehicle and one walked over to the poster and pulled it from the frame.?

 Portions of the exchange were captured on a surveillance videotape. Images from those tapes recently were posted on the website for the television show Celebrity Justice.

 The police said it referred the case to prosecutors on Thursday, but a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles county district attorney?s office said officials have yet to be presented evidence in the matter.

 Hilton, 23, is a great-granddaughter of Hilton hotels founder Conrad Hilton. She co-stars with Nicole Richie, daughter of pop singer Lionel Richie, in the Fox TV series The Simple Life. Hilton said she has been embarrassed and humiliated by the public release of the sex tape, which surfaced in 2003.

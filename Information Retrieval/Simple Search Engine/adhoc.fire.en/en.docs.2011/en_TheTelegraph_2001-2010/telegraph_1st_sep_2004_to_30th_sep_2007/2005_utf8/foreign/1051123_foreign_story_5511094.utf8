 EU sends nuke olive branch to Iran 

 Vienna, Nov. 22 (Reuters): European Union powers are willing to revive nuclear talks with Iran to discuss a Russian proposal aimed at defusing an impasse over what the West believes is an Iranian atomic bomb programme, diplomats said today.

 Under Russian President Vladimir Putins proposal, Iran would be allowed to continue converting uranium ore but would ship it to Russia for enrichment, a system which, in theory, would prevent Iran from producing weapons-grade uranium.

 Iran, whose President last month said Israel should be wiped off the map, denies western allegations that it has a clandestine atomic bomb policy. It insists its nuclear ambitions are limited to the peaceful generation of electricity.

 We are considering a meeting in December in Vienna. The Iranians would have to say they want to meet and talk about the Russian proposal, a diplomat from the so-called EU3 ? France, Britain and Germany ? said on condition of anonymity.

 He said the EU3 were ready to make a major concession in the interest of resuming dialogue with Iran ? they would be willing to meet even if Tehran did not reinstate a suspension of uranium processing activities at its Isfahan plant.

 The trio had made this a condition of restarting talks, but Tehran has so far ruled out halting work at Isfahan.

 We will probably come back to this issue after the IAEA board meeting, the diplomat said, referring to Thursdays meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agencys board of governors on Iran.

 Another diplomat said a date in early December was being considered for the talks, which Russian officials would also attend.

 No official comment was available from Tehran. However, EU officials said Iran would probably react positively, given that the Europeans and the US were ready to drop the demand for halting work at Isfahan before talks resumed.

 Other EU3 officials confirmed a meeting was under consideration, but said many aspects ? including the timing, the venue and the seniority of officials who would attend ? were unclear and warned that it might never take place.

 The EU3 broke off talks with Iran in August after the Islamic republics new hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ended the suspension of uranium processing, the cornerstone of a 2004 deal called the Paris Agreement.

 Yesterday, EU and US officials said they would not push the IAEAs 35-nation board to refer Iran this week to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions, as the they had previously threatened to do.

 The officials cited a desire to allow Iran more time to think about the Russian plan.

 Last week, US President George W. Bush said he backed Putins initiative to end the standoff in the EU3s drive to persuade Iran to abandon the most sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.

 It would allow Iran to continue converting uranium ore into gas at Isfahan if the most critical stage of nuclear fuel production ? uranium enrichment ? was transferred to Russia in exchange of economic and political benefits.

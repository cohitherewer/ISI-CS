 Paris, Nov. 27 (AFP): A grand-daughter of US screen legend Steve McQueen and one of President George W. Bushs nieces were among 18 young ladies who marked their coming out into high society at a Paris debutantes ball. 

 The event held last night, a hangover from European aristocratic traditions, saw the girls and women, aged between 16 and 19 and hailing from 10 countries, dolled up in designer dresses and jewellery, and accompanied by the bow-tied sons of high-flyers. Ashley Bush, the 17-year-old niece of the US leader, followed in the high-heeled steps of her sister Lauren, who appeared at a Paris Debs ball in 2000. 

 Car-jacking 

 Tirana (Reuters): Albanians are so sick 

 of police doing nothing about the theft and hijacking of 

 luxury cars that theyve taken to setting up their 

 own informal networks of hot-lines and roadblocks. When 

 a big new Mercedes was recently stolen at gunpoint from 

 a parking lot, the lot owner immediately called in his friends 

 instead of the local police precinct. Three cars homed in 

 on the late-model limousine from different directions while 

 a roadblock was set up near the town of Lezhe. The carjackers 

 saw the private roadblock, got out and took off. 

 Condoms 

 Nicosia (Reuters): Condoms, hair gel and waxing are so much a part of Cypriot life that statisticians will from January count them among 150 new products and services used to calculate the monthly consumer price index. Authorities are revising the list of household spending patterns in the Mediterranean country called the island of Aphrodite for the Greek goddess of love and beauty.

 Jolie objects to moving exiles

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 7: Angelina Jolie today wrapped up a four-day visit to Pakistan on a dissenting note, saying that President Pervez Musharrafs suggestion to relocate Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan to their homeland was not ?a good idea?.

 Speaking in Islamabad, Jolie said the relocation would ?not help find a solution to the problem?. Musharraf, during a meeting with Jolie yesterday, had suggested the UNHCR should relocate refugees within Afghanistan rather than maintaining them in Pakistan.

 A recent census jointly organised by the Pakistani government and the UNHCR showed over three million Afghan refugees still residing in Pakistan, including some who fled Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979 and others who left after the US-led military assault in December 2001.

 ?President Musharraf did not mention all the camps? but relocating refugees back to Afghanistan would mean moving backwards,? said Jolie. ?If we move people after 25 years to another camp or a place, we would not be finding a solution,? she added referring to Musharrafs remarks that the UNHCR should focus on creating economic conditions for the return of refugees to Afghanistan by speeding up reconstruction and rehabilitation projects.

 She believed the war in Iraq had caused diversion of funds from Afghanistan and called on the global community to provide more help in the repatriation process in Afghanistan. ?Pakistan is hosting the Afghan refugees for many years and the UNHCR greatly appreciates it,? she said.

 The star, her hair covered by 

 a traditional shawl as she toured a refugee camp near Peshawar, 

 in the North-West Frontier Province, said she was dismayed 

 by the lack of funds spent on education. She said there 

 was a need to boost development efforts in Afghanistan as 

 fast as possible.

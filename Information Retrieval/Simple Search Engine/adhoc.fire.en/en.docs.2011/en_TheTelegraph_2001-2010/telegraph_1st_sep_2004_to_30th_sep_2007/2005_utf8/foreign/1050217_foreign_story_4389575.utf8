 Father fortune

 Rome, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Diagnosed with incurable lung cancer, a 53-year-old Italian father robbed more than 10 banks so he could build a big enough inheritance to leave to his children.

 The married storekeeper, who once sold dresses in the north-eastern town of Savona, netted an estimated $150,000 after turning to a life of crime, according to Italian media reports.

 Police described the robber as ?a pleasant person, well cultured,? who would appear in banks with a bag that he claimed was full of plastic explosives. The bluff worked, so well in fact, that he robbed one bank in the city of Turin three times. 

 Bird brain

 Amsterdam (Reuters): A Dutch farmer has 

 painted pigeons pink and green to ward off hungry birds 

 of prey and it seems to have worked, a Dutch newspaper reported 

 on Wednesday. ?I?m crazy about the birds ... Naturally, 

 birds of prey are going to eat pigeons, but preferably not 

 here?, the farmer told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper. 

 He began painting the birds with environmentally friendly, 

 water-based paint a year ago. ?The colours make the pigeons 

 seem unsuitable as prey. The birds of prey simply don?t 

 recognise them anymore,? he said.

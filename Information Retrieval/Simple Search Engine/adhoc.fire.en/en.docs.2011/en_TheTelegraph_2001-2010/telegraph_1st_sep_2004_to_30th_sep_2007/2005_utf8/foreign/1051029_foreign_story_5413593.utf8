 Jolie keen to adopt again

 Jolie: Family values

 New York, Oct. 28 (AP): Angelina Jolie, often photographed with her two children in her arms, says she wants to adopt again.

 Its a very special thing, the 30-year-old actor told People magazine at the recent Worldwide Orphans Foundation benefit in Manhattan. Theres something about making a choice, waking up and travelling somewhere and finding your family.

 Jolie has a four-year-old son, Maddox, who was adopted from Cambodia, and a nine-month-old daughter, Zahara, adopted from Ethiopia.

 Most of the night I just 

 thought about how quickly I want to adopt again, she 

 said. There are so many wonderful places. There are 

 many parts of Asia, Africa, South America, so sooner or 

 later Ill end up everywhere, Im sure.

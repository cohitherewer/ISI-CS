 John Paul for saint 

 Rome, May 13 (Reuters): Pope Benedict said today he had put his predecessor Pope John Paul on the fast track to possible sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.

 In a surprise announcement to priests in Rome, the Pope told them he had dispensed with Church rules that impose a five-year waiting period after a candidates death before the procedure that leads to sainthood can even start.

 The priests in St Johns Basilica broke into sustained applause when he made his comments in Latin, the official language of the Church. He then joked there was no need to repeat it in Italian since all understood. John Paul died on April 2 and if normal rules had been applied, the procedure leading to his beatification could not have started until 2010.

 The news was received with joy in Poland, where television stations flashed in on the bottoms of screens.

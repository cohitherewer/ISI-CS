 Fine Print

 Critical Crow

 New York, Nov. 11 (AP): Dating Lance Armstrong has given Sheryl Crow a taste of what it feels like to be part of a celebrity couple ? and shes not too crazy about it.

 I think weve actually escaped a lot of it, because Ive seen what happened to Brad and Jen and Nick and Jessica, Crow said.

 The 43-year-old singer and Armstrong, 34, announced their engagement in September.

 When we were rumoured to have split, and when our publicists called these magazines to say we havent split, the magazines were all so disappointed because thats really whats selling, rooting for a couple and then they split, she said. 

 Hail Sean

 Los Angeles (AP): Sean Connery will 

 receive the American Film Institutes Life Achievement 

 Award, its highest honour for a career in film, the institute 

 announced on Thursday. The award will be presented to the 

 Scottish actor on June 8 in Los Angeles next year. Howard 

 Stringer, chairman of the AFI Board of Trustees, called 

 Connery an artist of the highest order. Though 

 best remembered for creating one of the great film heroes 

 of all time, his talents transcend typecasting, 

 Stringer said. 

 Judd aid

 San Salvador (AP): Ashley Judd has come to this Central American capital to join 3,000 Latin American politicians, police chiefs, doctors and activists in a regional forum on HIV. Judd, who has been the ambassador of US-based project Youth AIDS since 2002, on Wednesday met briefly with Salvadorian foreign minister Francisco Lainez, who thanked her for her visit. She can raise interest among the public and politicians about the need to increase efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS, Lainez said. More than 1.7 million Latin Americans have HIV.

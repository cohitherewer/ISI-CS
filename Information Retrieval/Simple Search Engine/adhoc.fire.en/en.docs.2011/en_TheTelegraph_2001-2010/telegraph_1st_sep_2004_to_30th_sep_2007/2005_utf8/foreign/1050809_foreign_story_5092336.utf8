 Saudi Arabia terror alert

 Riyadh, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Britain warned today that militants were in the final stages of planning attacks in Saudi Arabia as Washington shut its missions there for two days and Australia told its citizens to avoid travel to the kingdom.

 Saudi Arabia, battling a two-year campaign of violence by supporters of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, said it had no solid information of any imminent attack in the oil giant.

 There are credible reports that terrorists are in the final stages of planning attacks, said a advisory posted on the website of the British embassy in the capital Riyadh.

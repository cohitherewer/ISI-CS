 ?but Charles, dont go to China

 Prince Charles: Remark jolt

 London, Nov. 13 (AFP): Scathing remarks against the Chinese government by Britains Prince Charles made during the 1997 handover of Hong Kong were revealed in a British newspaper today.

 In his journal of the handover, at which he represented his mother Queen Elizabeth II, heir-to-the-throne Charles allegedly described senior Chinese diplomats as appalling old waxworks, the Mail on Sunday reported.

 The remarks could cause a diplomatic row with China just three days after Chinese President Hu Jintao compl-eted a short state visit to Britain.

 Charles Clarence House office are seriously considering taking legal proceedings relating to the issue, a spokesman said, believing the material was accessed unlawfully. 

 The Mail on Sunday said it came into its possession entirely legitimately.

 The prince allegedly described his horror at the awful soviet-style display as chinese troops goose step to haul down the union jack and raise the chinese flag during a ridiculous rigmarole.

 British prime minister tony blair also came in for criticism.

 The 3,000-word journal, entitled the handover of hong kong - or the great chinese takeaway was circulated to a clutch of relatives, friends, political contacts and courtiers.

 The mail on sunday called it a brilliantly witty but acerbic memoir. (afp) mpb 11131456 del

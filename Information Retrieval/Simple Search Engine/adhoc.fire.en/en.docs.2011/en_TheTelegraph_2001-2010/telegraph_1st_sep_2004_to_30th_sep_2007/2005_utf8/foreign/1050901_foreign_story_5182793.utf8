 Jailed Russian tycoon to contest poll

 Moscow, Aug. 31 (Reuters): Jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, set on needling the Kremlin which he says put him behind bars, today declared he would run for a parliamentary seat in a by-election in December.

 Khodorkovsky, who technically can stand because his appeal against a nine-year jail sentence for fraud has not yet been heard, indicated he did not expect his bid for a seat in the State Duma (lower house) to run its course. But his defiant statement on his website showed he would use the move to embarrass the Kremlin leadership of Vladimir Putin as much as possible. 

 He said huge support within the country had persuaded him to stand for election.

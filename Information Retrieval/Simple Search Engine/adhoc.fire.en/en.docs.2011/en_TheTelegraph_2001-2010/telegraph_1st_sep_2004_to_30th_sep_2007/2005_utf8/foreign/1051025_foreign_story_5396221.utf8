 Riot bares UK race underbelly

 London, Oct. 24 (Reuters): A man stabbed to death during weekend rioting in Britains second city, Birmingham, had been set upon by up to 11 men, police said today.

 Isiah Young-Sam, 23, was attacked in the Lozells area of the city on Saturday as he walked home with his younger brother Zephaniah and two friends from an afternoon at the cinema.

 Detective superintendent Dave Mirfield of West Midlands police said Isiah was brutally assaulted. The group was approached by three cars, Mirfield told a news conference. Those cars contained, we believe, between 10 and 11 men.

 These men got out of the cars, armed with knives, and attacked Isiah and his friends.

 The murder victim, who worked for Birmingham City Council, died from a single stab wound to the chest and his friend was stabbed in the back during the attack.

 Isiah, a trainee analyst described by his mother as well-mannered and old-fashioned, was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital.

 Early today, a teenager was shot dead in Birmingham close to the scene of weekend rioting, but police said it was unclear whether the killing was related to the disturbances. The 18-year old youth suffered fatal gunshot wounds shortly after midnight in the Newtown area, about a mile from where the worst of the weekend violence had occurred.

 Police said there had been sporadic incidents of disorder overnight, but they had been on a much smaller scale than on Saturday night when up to 50 youths rampaged through the area and several men were stabbed, including Young-Sam.

 The Saturday night violence broke out after a public meeting to address community concerns over an alleged sex attack on a teenage girl. Police said they were aware of rape allegations, but that no victim had come forward, making any investigation difficult.

 Glyn Evans, director of infotech at the city council, led tributes to Isiah. This is very sad news indeed for everyone who worked with Isaiah. He was a very pleasant and hardworking young man, he said.

 He was very popular with his colleagues and had a bright future in front of him. He will be greatly missed.

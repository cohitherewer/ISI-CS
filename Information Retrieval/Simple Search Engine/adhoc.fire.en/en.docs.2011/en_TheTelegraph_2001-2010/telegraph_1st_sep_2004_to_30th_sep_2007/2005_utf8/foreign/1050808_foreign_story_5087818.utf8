 Netanyahu pullout punch

 Netanyahu: Firm stand

 Jerusalem, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Israeli finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu resigned in protest on Sunday as the cabinet approved the first phase of evacuations from settlements in the occupied Gaza Strip.

 The resignation of Netanyahu, Sharons main rival in the right-wing Likud party, sent local markets reeling and showed the depth of division in the cabinet over the plan for disengagement from conflict with the Palestinians.

 But the departure of the highest-ranking minister yet to go over the pullout was too late to prevent approval for the forced evacuations of settlers, due to start after August 15.

 The cabinet voted by 17 to five to back the first phase of the initiative ? removal of the settlements of Kfar Darom, Netzarim and Morag, isolated enclaves where resistance is likely to be among the strongest.

 Netanyahu said his resignation letter counted as a vote against. A unilateral withdrawal without anything in return is not the way, he said. I cannot be part of this irresponsible move that divides the people and harms Israels security and will in the future pose a danger for the wholeness of Jerusalem.

 Right wing opponents see the plan as a capitulation to a Palestinian uprising, as well as setting a precedent for ceding land captured in the 1967 war ? which also includes the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem.

 The hawkish Netanyahu had long opposed removing all 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and four of 120 in the West Bank despite the fact that it has the support of most Israelis.

 Israels blue chip stock index closed 5.2 percent lower on news of the resignation. Netanyahu made himself a darling of business for cutting taxes and social benefits as well as other reforms that helped lift Israel out of recession.

 Documents show UN programme lapses

 United Nations, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Internal UN audits of the Iraqi oil-for-food programme found large contractors overcharging the world body by several million dollars and said one UN agency systematically mishandled funds in the field.

 Fifty-eight reports were released yesterday by Paul Volcker, the former US federal reserve chairman, who is conducting an independent probe of the $64 billion programme. The audits had been demanded by at least five US congressional committees.

 The reports from the UN watchdog ? the Office of International Oversight Services ? found ?no irregular activities? or corruption on the part of UN staff.

 Nevertheless, they point to lapses in supervising the programme, especially in keeping a rein on contractors hired.

 The reports indicate that Benon Sevan, head of the programme, complied with many of the requests but it is not clear which ones. But the audits repeatedly criticised the Nairobi-based UN Habitat agency for ignoring recommendations. The programme began in December 1996 to allow Iraq to sell oil and purchase civilian goods, an effort to ease the impact on Iraqis of sanctions imposed after Iraqs 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

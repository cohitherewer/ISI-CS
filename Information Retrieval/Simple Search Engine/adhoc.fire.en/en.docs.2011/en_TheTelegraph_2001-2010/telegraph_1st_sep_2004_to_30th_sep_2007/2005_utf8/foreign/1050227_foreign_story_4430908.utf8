 Stellar Stella

 New York, Feb. 26 (AP): Stella McCartney, fashion designer and daughter of Paul McCartney, has given birth to a baby boy in London, according to People magazine.

 McCartney and her husband, Alasdhair Willis, announced the birth of their first child, born early yesterday morning. ?Both mother and father are thrilled with the news,? the couple?s representative told the magazine.

 McCartney, 33, married Willis in August 2003. Willis, 34, is a former magazine publisher. Her new clothing collection will be unveiled on Thursday in Paris. ?Stella worked on and was able to complete the collection before giving birth,? People quoted her publicist as saying.

 Card crisis

Amsterdam (Reuters): A pharmaceutical company which sent 

anonymous Valentine?s cards to Dutch gynaecologists in a publicity stunt has been 

forced to apologise for sparking family rows. The doctors and their partners were 

furious with the company ? whose website says it mixes ?the ingredients for health 

and happiness? ? after the firm sent cards saying: ?Now shall we tell everyone??, 

De Telegraaf newspaper reported on Thursday. A second card was dispatched 

to the 800 doctors the next day explaining that the first had been a gimmick to 

promote a new product.

 Rafsanjani 

 Tehran, April 25 (Reuters): Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who favours closer ties with the West, today took another step closer to declaring he would run again for the presidency in June elections.

 Rafsanjani, 70, a moderate conservative who held the presidency from 1989 to 1997, has been dropping increasingly stronger hints he would enter a race political analysts say he would be favourite to win.

 ?The issue of the presidency has occupied my mind and even though I would like someone else to take the responsibility I think I?m going to have to swallow this bitter medicine,? the official Irna news agency quoted him as saying.

 ?What I didn?t want to happen is happening now,? he said.

 Analysts say Rafsanjani?s broad political support and reputation as an experienced manager make him a strong candidate for the June 17 vote.

 Rafsanjani?s apparent decision to enter the race may have been encouraged by disarray among his main rivals. 

 Hardline conservatives, who take a less liberal approach to economic, social and political affairs than Rafsanjani, have failed to settle on a consensus candidate and remain divided between six hopefuls.

 Reformists are also struggling to recapture the popular appeal of outgoing President Mohammad Khatami who is ineligible to stand for a third consecutive term.

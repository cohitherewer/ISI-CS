 EU setback after US keeps control of Web

 Tunis (Tunisia), Nov. 16 (Reuters): The US will keep control of the domain-name system that guides online traffic under an agreement today seen as a setback to efforts to internationalise one of the pillars of the Internet.

 Negotiators at the UN World Summit on the Information Society said they had agreed to set up a forum to discuss spam e-mail and other Internet issues and explore ways to narrow the technology gap between rich and poor countries.

 But oversight of the domain-name system will remain with the US, a setback for the EU and other countries that had pushed for international control of one of the most important technical aspects of the Internet.

 The EU said that the agreement would lead to further internationalisation of Internet governance, and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end.

 In the short term, US oversight is not immediately challenged, but in the long term they are under the obligation to negotiate with all the states about the future and evolution of Internet governance, said a member of the EU delegation who declined to be identified. The US said the agreement essentially endorses the status quo. 

 Theres nothing new in this document that wasnt already out there before, said ambassador David Gross, the head of the US delegation.

 We have no concerns that it could morph into something unsavoury, he said about the forum.

 The summit was launched two years ago with a focus on bringing technology to the developing world, but US control of the domain-name system had become a sticking point for countries like Iran and Brazil, who argued that it should be managed by the UN or some other global body.

 The US argued that such a body would stifle innovation with red tape. The EU in recent months had sought to reach a compromise between the two sides.

 Let me be absolutely clear: the UN does not want to take over, police or otherwise control the Internet, said UN secretary general Kofi Annan. 

 Under the agreement, a California non-profit body known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, will continue to oversee the system that matches addresses like reuters.com with numerical addresses that computers can understand.

 Individual countries will have greater control over their own domains, such as Chinas .cn or Frances .fr.

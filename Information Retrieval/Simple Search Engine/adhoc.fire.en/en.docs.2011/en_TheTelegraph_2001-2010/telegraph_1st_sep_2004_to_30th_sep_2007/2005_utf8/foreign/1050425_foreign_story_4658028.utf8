 Tolerance triumph in Kingdom of 

 Heaven 

 - Valiant knight

 Ridley Scott?s new blockbuster, 

 Kingdom of Heaven, could hardly be more topical. 

 It shows Muslims resisting Christian invaders, battles raging 

 in wind-whipped deserts, ancient cities under siege and 

 civilians cowering. 

 Ok, so all this screen mayhem 

 is meant to be happening more than eight centuries ago, 

 but doesn?t it sound like recent news from Iraq?

 Well, the movie is not meant to 

 show that Christians and Muslims have been at one another?s 

 throats for centuries. Rather, by dwelling on the extended, 

 turbulent holy war known as the Crusades, Ridley said he 

 hoped to demonstrate that Christians, Muslims and Jews could 

 live together in harmony ? if only fanaticism were kept 

 at bay.

 To that end, for all the furious 

 battle scenes in Kingdom of Heaven, Scott and screenwriter, 

 William Monahan, have tried to be balanced. Muslims are 

 portrayed as bent on coexistence until Christian extremists 

 ruin everything. And even when the Christians are defeated, 

 the Muslims give them safe passage to Europe. 

 ?It?s actually about doing the 

 right thing,? said Scott, 67, whose screen combat experience 

 includes directing 1492: Conquest of Paradise, Black 

 Hawk Down and Gladiator. ?I know that sounds 

 incredibly simplistic. It?s about temptation and avoiding 

 temptation. It?s about ethics. It?s about going to war over 

 passion and idealism. Idealism is great if it?s balanced 

 and humanitarian.?

 If so, the Crusaders got a few 

 things wrong. From 638 AD, when Muslims first occupied Jerusalem, 

 both Christians and Jews were permitted to visit their holy 

 sites. Then, in 1095, responding to an appeal from the Byzantine 

 Christian Church in Constantinople, Pope Urban II organised 

 the First Crusade to liberate Jerusalem. Four years later, 

 those crusaders seized the city, massacring almost all its 

 inhabitants in a bloodbath invoked to this day.

 Seven more crusades were waged, 

 bringing European monarchs, lords, knights and their armies 

 of devout followers to fight ? and settle ? in an area stretching 

 between what is today Syria and Egypt. The Muslims responded 

 with their own sporadic jihads until finally, by 1291, the 

 Christians had been driven out.

 It?s hard not to wonder, is this 

 really a good time to show warring Christians and Muslims 

 as entertainment?

 ?I think it?s the perfect time 

 for the movie, because it doesn?t paint one side or other 

 as being the goodies or the baddies,? insisted Jeremy Irons, 

 one of several actors who appear as crusaders. ?It just 

 shows human nature getting in the way of possible peaceful 

 coexistence. I don?t think it will anger either side. I 

 think it will make both sides think.?

 Of course, the backers of Kingdom 

 of Heaven, 20th Century Fox, are hardly in the business 

 of offering $140-million lessons in history and morality. 

 The film focuses on a particularly dramatic moment between 

 the Second and Third Crusades, when the Muslims retook Jerusalem. 

 This real history is wrapped in a fictional love story and 

 presented as a rich spectacle of costumes, horses, swords 

 and endless desert.

 The facts are that during a period 

 of relative peace, Baldwin IV, the young king of Jerusalem, 

 again opened the city to all faiths. But after his death 

 in 1185, militant Knights Templar began attacking Muslim 

 desert convoys. In response, the legendary Muslim warrior 

 Saladin, leading an army of 200,000, laid siege to Jerusalem. 

 Balian of Ibelin, the Christian knight who surrendered the 

 city on October 2, 1187, is the movie?s hero.

 Little is known about the real 

 Balian. Played by British actor Orlando Bloom, Balian is 

 handsome, loyal, brave and the perfect match for King Baldwin?s 

 stunning sister, Sybilla, played by French actor Eva Green 

 (The Dreamers). Their clandestine love blossoms, 

 but everything else soon falls apart. In the final confrontation 

 with Saladin, played by veteran Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud, 

 Balian gives up, as huge boulders and balls of fire batter 

 the walls of Jerusalem.

 ?He ultimately surrenders Jerusalem 

 to Saladin to save the lives of the people,? said Bloom, 

 28. ?The conduct of the knight is: be brave that God may 

 help thee; speak the truth even if it leads to your death; 

 and safeguard the helpless. That is the oath, and he follows 

 it to the bitter end.?

 Still, there is a political message, 

 one that Green, 24, interpreted with characteristic French 

 directness. ?It?s a movie with substance. It?s very clever 

 and brave, and I hope it will wake up people in America.? 

 To what? ?To be more tolerant, more open towards the Arab 

 people,? she said. 

 Well, it wasn?t exactly what Scott 

 had in mind, but why not?

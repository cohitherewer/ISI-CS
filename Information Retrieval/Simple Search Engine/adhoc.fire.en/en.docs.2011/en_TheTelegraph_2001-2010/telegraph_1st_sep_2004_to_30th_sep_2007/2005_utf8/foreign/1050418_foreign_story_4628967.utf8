 Texas threat to Bolton?s UN bid

 SONNI EFRON AND RICHARD A. SERRANO 

 John Bolton: Aggressive?

 Washington, April 17: A Texas businesswoman has written to the Senate foreign relations committee that John R. Bolton is unfit to serve as UN ambassador because he threatened, berated and harassed her in a dispute over an overseas contract. 

 ?His behaviour back in 1994 wasn?t just unforgivable, it was pathological,? wrote Melody Townsel, a businesswoman from Dallas, in a letter to the committee that was made public yesterday by Democrats who oppose Bolton?s nomination. 

 ?I cannot believe that this man is being seriously considered for any diplomatic position, let alone such a critical posting to the UN.?

 Hers is the latest in a string of recent accounts alleging that Bolton ? who faces a key committee vote on Tuesday in his nomination to be ambassador to the UN ? has been rude and belligerent toward those less powerful than himself, including three intelligence analysts whose views clashed with his. 

 Also disclosed yesterday was the summary of a committee staff interview with a former National Intelligence Officer for Latin America. He said that in 2003 Bolton and another state department official attempted to pressure him to tailor his judgment on Cuba?s biological weapons programme and attacked his integrity and attempted to have him transferred when he would not do so. 

 A state department official said the administration has checked into the allegations by Townsel and believes they are unfounded. ?This stuff just didn?t happen as far as we know,? the official said. He did say that Bolton, a private attorney at the time, was in Moscow, where Townsel said the incident occurred, and that Bolton was representing the interest of his clients in the business deal. 

 Townsel, who runs her own communications company in Dallas, said at the time of her encounter with Bolton she was working for a company supervising a subcontractor of the US Agency for International Development in Kyrgyzstan. Bolton was representing the subcontractor. 

 ?He threw some things in the first meeting,? including papers and a tape dispenser, Townsel said. ?He yelled and got really abusive.? When she went to her Moscow hotel room to avoid him, she said, ?he proceeded to pound on my hotel door and thrust things under the door?. 

 In her letter to the Senate panel, Townsel wrote that she ?learned firsthand the lengths Mr. Bolton will go to accomplish any goal he sets for himself. Truth flew out the window. Decency flew out the window. In his bid to smear me and promote the interests of his client, he went straight for the low road and stayed there.?

 Sun: Harry had to prove parentage

 Prince Harry: Trivial test

 London, June 29 (PTI): Prince Harry, second son of Princess Diana, was made to undergo a DNA test to disprove rumours that James Hewitt, an army officer with whom she had an affair, was his father, a media report claimed today.

 In a fresh blow to the scandal-ridden British royal family, the Sun tabloid reported that Princess Diana was given the order by senior royals after she confessed on TV to having an affair with Hewitt. The DNA test confirmed that Prince Charles is Harrys father.

 In her new book Diana: The Last Word, Dianas long-time friend Simone Simmons said she was shown a letter demanding the blood test. Simmons said Diana was upset over the whispers about parentage of her younger son, who has red hair like Hewitt, and for making her son undergo the test.

 According to the report, Prince Philip hit the roof when he heard rumours that Hewitt was the father of Prince Harry. But the young prince, aged 11 at the time, was never told the reason for the test. His brother William was also tested, with the same result.

 Simmons also says in her book that Diana rated Charles as a lowly one out of ten between the sheets. John F. Kennedy Junior got the full ten and Hewitt nine.

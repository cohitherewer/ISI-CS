 Suit over abuse snaps against AP

 Los Angeles, March 23 (Reuters): Five US navy SEALs and the wife of one of the men have sued the Associated Press and a San Diego-based reporter, claiming the news organisation endangered their lives and invaded their privacy by publishing photos of the elite unit apparently abusing Iraqi prisoners.

 The lawsuit, filed on Monday in San Diego federal court, marked a broader legal claim by the Coronado, California-based SEALs, who had earlier filed a suit against the AP in state court after it published the 15 photos in December.

 The photos depict SEALs posing with bloodied and bound prisoners apparently taken during raids on civilian homes.

 AP reporter Seth Hettena reported that the photos, date stamped May 2003, were placed on the photo-sharing website Smugmug.com by a navy wife who said her husband brought them back from Iraq.

 Dave Tomlin, assistant general counsel for the AP, called the legal claims by the SEALs ?groundless.?

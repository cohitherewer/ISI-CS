 Islamabad, May 26: President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terrorism, today asked visiting US assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs Christina Rocca for a full inquiry into the alleged desecration of the Quran at Guantanamo Bay.

 Musharraf conveyed to Rocca Pakistans deep anguish over the reported desecration of the holy book by US troops at the military detention centre.

 Hundreds of suspected al Qaida terrorists have been detained at the centre. 

 Musharraf has been criticised by the six-party religious alliance, Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal, after he withdrew his countrys support to the Taliban and helped the US topple the fundamentalist regime in Afghanistan. 

 Rocca is on a three-day visit to Pakistan to discuss regional security, bilateral trade and defence ties and the war against terror with Pakistan leaders.

 She assured Musharraf that her government was investigating the Quran allegations and those held responsible will be punished.

 Rocca also discussed the Pakistan-India peace talks with Musharraf who emphasised the importance of an early solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. 

 He said the US must continue to encourage New Delhi to take advantage of the improved situation between the two countries and move towards a solution in the interest of durable peace and stability in South Asia.

 Assuring Washingtons continuing support to the peace process, Rocca said her government acknowledges Musharrafs efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.

 Reiterating President George W. Bushs commitment to a long-term bilateral relationship with Pakistan, Rocca said the US, is engaged in broadening and deepening ties with Pakistan.

 She also lauded Pakistans support to the international campaign against terror.

 Rocca and Pakistani state minister for economic affairs Hina Rabbani Kharalso signed four MoUs pledging up to $147.6 million for developing social sectors including education, health, job creation and electoral and legislative reforms.

 Last year, the Bush administration approved a $3 billion economic and military aid package for Pakistan.

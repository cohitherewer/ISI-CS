 Prince on public plane

 RICHARD EDEN

 Charles and Camilla

 London, July 10: The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will use a scheduled flight for their first foreign tour together later this year.

 The decision has been taken in response to criticism that the prince received a bill for almost ?380,000 for his last official visit overseas.

 The Sunday Telegraph has learnt that Prince Charles and the Duchess will travel on a regular flight when they visit the US this autumn, in the same way that Prince William sat alongside members of the public on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland last month.

 Charles is mindful of the need to keep costs down and is aware of the reaction to the cost of his last trip, said a courtier. The prince only ever charters a plane when scheduled flights are not practicable and he is confident that on this occasion they will be able to use such a service.

 The ?379,929 bill for a charter aircraft to fly to Sri Lanka, to visit survivors of the tsunami, Australia and Fiji then back to Britain via Tokyo was by far the highest of any journey by a member of the royal family last year. Although Australia reimbursed ?87,700 ? leaving the taxpayer to foot a bill of ?292,229 ? there was strong criticism of the cost of the trip when the royal family published its annual accounts last month. The same journey on scheduled airlines ? in first and business class ? would have been ?9,000 per person. 

 When the prince went to President Ronald Reagans funeral in Washington last year, he chartered an aircraft for ?85,000. By contrast, when Prince Philip flew across the Atlantic to Toronto with his entourage in April 2004 the bill was ?12,800 on a scheduled flight.

 An official at Clarence House, where the prince has his private office, said, however: To allow HRH to fulfil the busy programme and to meet the inevitable security requirements, using scheduled services was not possible, although, of course, that option was considered.

 The couples decision to use a scheduled flight, on which members of the public will be passengers, for the trip to America is notable, as the duchess is known to have a fear of flying. It may, however, help to emphasise her down-to-earth personality in America, where the popularity of the late Diana, Princess of Wales endures eight years after her death.

 The prince has not visited America since the princess died ? other than to attend President Reagans funeral ? and his aides used to call the country Diana territory.

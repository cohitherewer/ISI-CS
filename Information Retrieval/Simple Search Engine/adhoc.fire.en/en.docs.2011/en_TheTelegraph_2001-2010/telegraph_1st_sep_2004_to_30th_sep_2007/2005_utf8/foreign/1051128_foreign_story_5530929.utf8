 Legal eagle from US for Saddam 

 - Former attorney-general 

joins defence; trial today

 Saddam (top) and 

 Clark: New battle

 Baghdad, Nov. 27 (Reuters): The trial of Saddam Hussein and seven co-defendants resumes in a fortified Baghdad courtroom tomorrow with former US attorney-general Ramsey Clark joining the team defending the overthrown Iraqi president.

 Clark, a controversial figure who was the top US attorney in the late 1960s before becoming an anti-Vietnam war activist and a defender of figures, including Slobodan Milosevic, said he hoped to strengthen Saddams defence.

 Our plan is to go to court in Baghdad on Monday morning representing the defence counsel as defence support, Clark said in Amman today before flying to Baghdad.

 A fair trial in this case is absolutely imperative for historical truth, the 77-year-old said. It is absolutely essential that the court is legal in its constitution. A court cannot be a court unless it is absolutely independent of all external pressures and forces.

 Clark will be joined by the former justice minister of Qatar, Najeeb al-Nauimi, lending an international aspect to proceedings which have until now been entirely Iraqi-run.

 It was not clear if the chief judge of the trial, Rizgar Mohammed Amin, would allow Clark and Nauimi into his courtroom, but a spokeswoman for the defence team said their attendance had already been approved by US advisers to the court.

 The trial began on October 19 but is resuming after a 40-day adjournment, granted to give the defence team more time to prepare for a trial involving charges of crimes against humanity.

 Most of the break has been taken up with security issues after one defence lawyer was murdered the day after the trial began and another in early November, throwing proceedings into chaos. A third defence lawyer has fled Iraq after death threats.

 Saddam and the others are accused of ordering and carrying out the deaths of 148 men from the town of Dujail, north of Baghdad, following a failed attempt on his life in 1982.

 The lawyers still involved in representing the eight defendants have agreed to return to court only after security promises were made, although the details of the protections that are being afforded to them have not been revealed.

 Khalil Dulaimi, Saddams chief lawyer, said one of the reasons he had decided to return was because the Iraqi High Tribunal, the US-funded body running the trial, had said it would appoint its own stand-by defence attorneys if the regular defence team failed to show up.

 Monday is expected to move the trial into a dramatic new phase as witnesses take the stand for the first time. With security at a premium, at least some of the prosecution testimony will be given from behind a protective screen.

 Death threats have already been made against some witnesses, residents of Dujail said.

 The trial is expected to continue for at least three days, although the judge will also be asked to consider another adjournment.

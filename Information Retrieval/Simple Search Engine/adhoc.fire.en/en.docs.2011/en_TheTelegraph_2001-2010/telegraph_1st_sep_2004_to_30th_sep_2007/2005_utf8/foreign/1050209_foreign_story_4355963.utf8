 Rice in Europe, calls for new ties

 Paris, Feb. 8 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice urged Europe today to put aside differences over the Iraq war and open a new chapter in relations with the US to help it spread democracy worldwide.

 Rice pointedly made the appeal in France, a fierce critic of the war, during an eight-nation tour to drive home the message that President George W. Bush wants Europe to be Washington?s partner and not its rival.

 ?America stands ready to work with Europe on our common agenda and Europe must stand ready to work with America,? Rice said in comments from a keynote foreign policy speech released to reporters before delivery.

 After all, history will surely judge us not by our old disagreements but by our new achievements,? said Rice, a former university provost.

 Rice is to deliver her speech at the prestigious Sciences Politiques university in Paris which has been at the centre of intellectual and political debate over transatlantic relations.

 The address will be the main speech of her tour in Paris, ?to send the message to Europe that the Bush administration has ended its own internal debate about whether to view a united Europe as a rival or as a partner,? a US state department official said.

 ?It is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past. It is time to open a new chapter in our relationship and a new chapter in our alliance,? Rice said.

 Removing one obstacle to better ties, a French government source said shortly before Rice?s arrival that Washington had agreed to hand over to France its last three citizens held by US forces at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

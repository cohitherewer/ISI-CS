 Hollywood boxes to glory

 Los Angeles, March 7: In the acclaimed 1956 film Somebody Up There Likes Me, director Robert Wise traces the real-life ascent of Rocky Graziano from New York street kid to world boxing champion. 

 In one scene early in the story, Sal Mineo says to Paul Newman (as Graziano): ?Guys like us, we ain?t got no chance, have we??

 Graziano did indeed get his chance, and it?s that opportunity to overcome sociological barriers and achieve success that has made boxing and its gladiators rich material for some of Hollywood?s most celebrated storytelling.

 Fresh off Million Dollar Baby?s knockout performance at the Academy Awards, reality TV guru Mark Burnett aims to bring the tried-and-true elements of the fight game to success on the small screen with his series The Contender.

 Burnett acknowledges that a big part of the show?s appeal is the theme of upward social mobility that has been the backdrop of many a Hollywood boxing film.

 ?The hard-luck story, coming from a disadvantaged background ? Americans like that story,? says Burnett, a British native who boxed in the army and is now a licensed fight promoter in California.

 The format of The Contender incorporates elements of some of Burnett?s current reality show successes such as Survivor and The Apprentice. Sixteen boxers live and train together while vying for a $1 million purse. Each episode ends with a five-round fight, with the loser eliminated.

 ?Last time I checked, there were no applicants from Beverly Hills or the Upper East Side,? Burnett says. ?They come from underprivileged backgrounds, and that is what boxing has always stood for.?

 Since their earliest pairings in the 1890s, boxing and film have been a good match. From the 1920s and ?30s, with Battling Butler and The Champ, to the golden era of boxing movies in the ?40s and ?50s, with John Garfield in Body and Soul and director Wise?s The Set-Up Hollywood has demonstrated a healthy respect for the sport.

 And with former boxer John Huston directing Stacy Keach and Jeff Bridges in Fat City, the immense popularity of Sylvester Stallone?s Rocky franchise and the undisputed artistry of Martin Scorsese?s Raging Bull, the sweet science has long enjoyed sweet success on the silver screen. That was reinforced when Clint Eastwood?s Million Dollar Baby won four Oscars.

 US prayer shooting

 Brookfield, Wisconsin, March 13 (Reuters): A man opened fire with a handgun at a church service in a Wisconsin hotel yesterday, killing seven people and wounding four before taking his own life, police said.

 Four victims and the gunman died at the scene and three others died later at a hospital.

 What prompted the violence at the Sheraton Hotel in Brookfield 10 miles (16 km) west of Milwaukee during a regular service of the Living Church of God in a meeting room was still under investigation, Brookfield?s police chief, Dan Tushaus, told reporters.

 He said the unidentified 45-year-old shooter?was either a member or somehow affiliated with the church? and that he entered the service while in session and began firing.

 A woman present in the room said ?I sat in front of a family that he mowed down. ... I dived under a chair. The man whose chair I dived under, he died,? the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

 She said one of those killed was the group?s minister, the newspaper said.

 Police were searching the man?s residence in the nearby town of New Berlin for more information.

 ?I have no indication of a motive at this time? Tushaus told a news conference. He said the church had been meeting at the same location for the past four to five years.

 The police chief did not release the names of the victims but said the four slain at the scene were two teenaged boys, ages 15 and 17, a 72-year-old man and a woman aged 55.

 Of the seven wounded people taken to hospitals, three later died ? men aged 44, 50 and 58. Still being treated and in serious condition were a 52-year-old man, a 20-year-old woman, a 20-year-old man and a 10-year-old girl.

 The denomination, headquartered in Charlotte, NC, believes that the Sabbath ? the day of worship ? is to be observed on Saturday. 

 Child shoots brother

 A two-year-old in Houston was shot by his four-year-old brother, who may not have known the difference between a real and toy gun, police said.

 The two-year-old, who suffered a single gunshot wound to the temple, was in critical condition at Ben Taub hospital. The shooting occurred on Saturday afternoon at a home in south-west Houston.

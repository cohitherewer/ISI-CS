 Blond Bond Craig just fine, says Connery

 Craig: Licensed to kill 

Connery: Original 007

 London, Dec. 3 (AP): Sean Connery thinks a blond Bond is just fine. The former 007 says Daniel Craig is a terrific choice as the new British superspy.

 Some eyebrows were raised in October when producers cast the sandy-haired, relatively unknown Craig in the next James Bond film, Casino Royale.But Connery, 75, told British Broadcasting Corp. television that he approved.

 Craigs a great choice, really interesting ? different, Connery said in comments released yesterday by the broadcaster. The full interview is due to air on Monday.

 Hes a good actor. Its a completely new departure, he added.

 The respect is mutual. Craig told a news conference in October that Connery was his favourite 007.

 Connery was the first actor to play Bond, appearing in six official Bond films beginning with Dr. No in 1962 and ending in 1971 with Diamonds Are Forever.

 Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have also starred as the womanising, gadget-loving spy.

 Connery said hed left the role in part because I got really fed up with the space stuff and special effects. I just found it getting more and more influential in the movies. Casino Royale is due in theatres next November.

 Daniel Craig will wield 007s famous Walther PPK in the film. 

 But he told OK! magazine: I hate handguns. Handguns are used to shoot people and as long as they are around, people will shoot each other. 

 Thats a simple fact. Ive seen a bullet wound and it was a mess. It was on a shoot and it scared me. Bullets have a nasty habit of finding their target and thats whats scary about them. Nor does the 37-year-old share Bonds love of Martinis, shaken not stirred. 

 I love a Martini straight up. I dont think anybody makes a Martini stirred any more, he said. He is not the first Bond to reveal a hatred of his characters key accessory. 

 Roger Moore, who played the spy from 1973 to 1985, said after quitting the role that he hated that awful pose of Bond with his gun, which has become an iconic movie image. 

 The actor later became an ambassador for childrens charity Unicef and declared: Today I am completely opposed to small arms and what they can do to children.

 Locating Lenin

 Berlin, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Left-wing Berlin senators want to reassemble a giant statue of Russian Communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin that was removed from the former eastern half of the city in 1991 shortly after German reunification.

 A scene showing part of the 19-metre statue being borne through the air by a helicopter featured in the 2003 hit film Goodbye Lenin!. Today it lies buried in pieces in a forest on the outskirts of Berlin.

 Tourist industry experts say the monument would appeal to many of the German capitals six million visitors each year. The Communist period is the most asked-after period by tourists in Berlin, said Natascha Kompatzki of Berlin Tourismus Marketing GmbH.

 One proposal is for the granite statue to be housed in Berlins Museum of German History, Germanys Bild newspaper said today. 

 Film crash 

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Moviegoers shot 

 down a costly action movie for the second consecutive weekend 

 as the $100 million military film Stealth opened 

 at number 4 with sales of just $13.5 million, according 

 to studio estimates issued on Sunday. After two weekends 

 as the box office bridesmaid, the comedy Wedding Crashers 

 swapped places with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 

 to lead the field. The superhero comedy Sky High 

 did the best, opening at number 3.

 Children stung

 New York, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Dozens of children at a Baltimore-area elementary school were stung by bees after stumbling upon them during a science lesson.

 The entire second-grade class of about 100 students at Deep Creek Elementary School was studying trees in the nearby woods when one child disturbed a nest of bees. The distressed bees stung 47 children, two of whom suffered a mild allergic reaction.

 UFO rage

 Berlin (Reuters): Massive fireballs in the skies over Germany this week have led to an upsurge in reports of UFOs, but scientists believe the cause could be a bizarre annual meteor blitz. Nasa says such fireballs have been reported elsewhere in the world and may also be due to the fact that the Earth is now orbiting through a swarm of space debris. Many people in Germany have noticed the fireballs, said Werner Walter, who runs an astronomical website.

 Charles blessing on TV

 London, March 18 (AP): The blessing ceremony following the civil marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles will be shown live on television, the prince?s Clarence House office said today. 

 Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams is to lead the blessing at Windsor Castle following a civil wedding service at Windsor town hall on April 8. The civil service will not be shown on TV, Clarence House said. 

 Clarence House announced last month that the heir to the British throne would wed Parker Bowles, 57.

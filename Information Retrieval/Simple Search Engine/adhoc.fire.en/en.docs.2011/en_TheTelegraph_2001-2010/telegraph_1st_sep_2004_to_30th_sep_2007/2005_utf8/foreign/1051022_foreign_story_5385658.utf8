 Saddam lawyer found executed

 Baghdad, Oct. 21 (Reuters): A defence lawyer for one of Saddam Husseins co-defendants was shot dead after being abducted, police said today, in a grim new twist to a case meant to turn the page on Iraqs bloody past.

 Saadoun Janabi was kidnapped from his small Baghdad office late yesterday, witnesses said. Police said today his body was later found shot execution-style in the chest and head.

 Iraqs government condemned the murder, which some human rights groups said could have a chilling effect on Saddams defence team and dim hopes for a fair trial amid relentless political bloodshed.

 Janabi was attorney for Awad al-Bander, a former judge who appeared with Saddam and six other co-accused in court on Wednesday at the start of their trial on charges stemming from the killings and executions of more than 140 men in the 1980s.

 Bander is accused of overseeing the trials of dozens of men from the Shia town of Dujail north of Baghdad who were sentenced to death in the wake of a failed assassination attempt against Saddam in July, 1982.

 The Dujail case is the first against Saddam, who is also expected to face charges of war crimes and genocide for a series of offences during his brutal three-decade rule over Iraq.

 The assassination of Janabi, who Baghdad lawyers said had been an old personal friend of the former dictator, came as Saddams formerly dominant Sunni minority wages a bloody insurgency against the Shia- and Kurdish-led government and its US backers.

 Both Baghdad and Washington hope the trial, which began just days after a referendum on a new constitution, will prove a unifying force and draw a line under Saddams dictatorship.

 But some human rights groups fear it may be simple victors justice that could further the exacerbate sectarian tensions that have already pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war.

 Iraqs Electoral Commission said today final results from the October 15 constitutional referendum would not be released for another day or two. 

 Witnesses said Janabis kidnappers ? heavily-armed and wearing suits and ties ? identified themselves as employees of the interior ministry, often accused by Sunni groups as sanctioning hit squads run by Shia militiamen. The ministry has repeatedly denied the allegations, and the government today denied any involvement in the murder.

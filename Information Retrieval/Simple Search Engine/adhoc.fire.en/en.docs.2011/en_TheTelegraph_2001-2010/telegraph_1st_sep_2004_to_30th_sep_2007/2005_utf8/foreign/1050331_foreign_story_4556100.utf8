 Pornography school

 San Francisco, March 30 (Reuters): A California university, once ranked by Playboy magazine as the top US party school, is probing a fraternity for a party where a hard-core sex film was made, a school spokesperson said.

 California State University, Chico, has suspended its 25-member chapter of Phi Kappa Tau, while it investigates the party at which professional porn actors were filmed having sex last October, said school spokesperson Joe Wills. ?On Friday we suspended the fraternity,? said Wills. ?We?re trying to gather information as fast as we can right now.? 

 Shane?s World, a southern California maker of adult films, including ones featuring partying college students, provided four female and two male actors for the film, spokesperson Nicole Henderson said. Three students had sex on film, she added.

 She said the filmmaker is contacted by college students, who must verify they are older than 18 and sign release forms to be at parties and appear in its College Invasion series of films. ?We bring the porn stars and the cameras, and just film.?

 Fine Print

 Literate America

 Washington, Dec. 5 (AFP): Seattle, the west coast haven of coffee, culture and the arts has been named Americas most literate city.

 A study put Seattle directly ahead of Minneapolis, Washington D.C., Atlanta and San Francisco in terms of literacy, which researchers said was critical to a citys long term economic and social success.

 Researchers at Central Connecticut State University surveyed the literacy of 69 of Americas largest cities in terms of newspaper circulation, number of bookstores, library resources, periodical publishing resources, educational attainment and Internet use.

 Author Dr John Miller said the purpose of the research was to help improve the quality of life in American cities. 

 Guide gripe

 Canberra (Reuters): One of Australias 

 largest banks apologised on Monday for a grooming 

 handbook that suggested staff wear flesh-coloured 

 underwear and advised against shiny stockings because they 

 make legs look fatter. The grooming guide ? which also recommended 

 that earrings should be no bigger than a small coin ? was 

 given to retail banking staff at the Commonwealth Bank. 

 The guidelines are just that ? guidelines, bank 

 executive Hugh Harley said.

 Royal baby

 Oslo (Reuters): A baby prince born on Saturday to Norways Crown Princess Mette-Marit will be christened Sverre Magnus, the palace said on Monday. Grandson of King Harald, the prince is third in line to the Norwegian throne after his father, Crown Prince Haakon, and one-year-old Princess Ingrid Alexandra. It is a name with beautiful, long and good traditions in Norwegian history, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said on Norwegian television. 

 Cat amp; dolls

 London (Reuters): Los Angeles burlesque 

 act the Pussycat Dolls have danced straight back to the 

 top of the British pop charts with Stickwitu, the 

 Official UK Charts Company said on Sunday. The ballad is 

 the second British number one for the all-girl band after 

 their chart-topping debut single Dont Cha. 

 The Dolls success meant veteran Britpoppers Oasis 

 missed out on scoring a third number one from their latest 

 album Dont Believe The Truth. The Manchester 

 band had to be content with second place for Let There 

 Be Love, after crowning the charts earlier this year 

 with Lyla.

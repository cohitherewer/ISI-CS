 What does Bush carry in pockets?

 Bush: No money

 Washington, Nov. 2 (Reuters): Inquiring minds want to know. What does President George W. Bush carry in his pockets? Not much, it turns out.

 A Latin American journalist at a briefing on the Presidents trip to the region this week told Bush he wanted to ask the unofficial question that he asks all Presidents ? what does he carry in his pockets?

 Bush magnanimously answered by pulling out a white handkerchief with a flourish and then rummaged around in both pockets.

 And finally, showing that he had nothing to hide, Bush pulled both pants pockets inside out. They were empty.

 Es todo. No dinero, (Thats all. No money.) Bush joked in his own brand of Spanglish. No wallet, no bolsa (wallet). 

 He even showed off his Timex wristwatch, but quickly added: Im not supposed to be endorsing products.

 Lasagna luck

 At least 70 federal police officers guarding the beach resort hotel where Bush and others will meet were overcome by diarrhoea and vomiting after dining on lasagna at a nearby hotel late yesterday, police commissioner Daniel Rodriguez told local radio.

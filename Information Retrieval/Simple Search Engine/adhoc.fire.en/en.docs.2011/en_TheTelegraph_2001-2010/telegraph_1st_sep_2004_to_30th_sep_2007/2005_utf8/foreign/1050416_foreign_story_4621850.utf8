 Principal plays down fuss over Japan book

 Tochigi (Japan), April 15 (Reuters): Nestled in scenic mountains north of Tokyo, the Kokugakuin school shows few signs it might be linked to Japan?s feud with China over World War II history.

 Last week anti-Japanese demonstrations in China erupted in violence after Tokyo approved a new version of a history textbook critics say glosses over the brutality of Japan?s past military aggression. More protests are planned this weekend in China.

 Staff at Kokugakuin, one of only a handful of schools to adopt the textbook, say they are nonplussed by China?s outrage. 

 ?I think it is strange,? said Toru Ishitsuka, principal of the co-educational junior high school north of Tokyo.

 ?The contents of the textbook have been approved by the government. If it were in any way dogmatic or complacent, it would not have been passed,? he added.

 The 200-student school is an offshoot of Kokugakuin University, set up by a member of the imperial family in the late 19th century to encourage the study of Japanese culture at a time when Japan was racing to catch up with the West.

 Ishitsuka says Kokugakuin?s aim of engendering a love of things Japanese, evidenced by the school?s prowess in martial arts, has no connection with the militarism some critics fear could one day re-emerge in Japan.

 ?Japan has more than 50 years of history since it abandoned war,? he said, referring to the US-drafted pacifist constitution adopted after World War II. ?I don?t think anyone wants to take up arms and invade another country. I don?t really understand why anyone would worry about that,? he added.

 Demonstrations in China last weekend were sparked by the education ministry?s approval of a new edition of the New History Textbook.

 Written by the Society for History Textbook Reform, a group that criticises other texts as offering a?masochistic? view of history, the original book faced vocal opposition from within Japan as well as abroad. 

 After publication in 2001, it was adopted by only 18 of Japan?s more than 11,102 junior high schools, including Kokugakuin. But the fuss it sparked meant it still sold 600,000 copies to general readers.

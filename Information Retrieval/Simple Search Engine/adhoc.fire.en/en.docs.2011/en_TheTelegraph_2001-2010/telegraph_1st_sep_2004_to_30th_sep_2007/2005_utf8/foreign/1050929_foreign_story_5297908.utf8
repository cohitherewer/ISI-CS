 Suicide attack in Kabul

 Kabul, Sept. 28 (Reuters): A suicide bomber dressed in an army uniform rammed his motorcycle into a fleet of buses carrying Afghan army officers in Kabul today, killing at least nine people and wounding 28, officials said.

 The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack at the Kabul Military Training Centre, set up by US-led forces to train a new national army. It was the bloodiest of several suicide attacks in Kabul since US-led forces overthrew the Taliban in late 2001.

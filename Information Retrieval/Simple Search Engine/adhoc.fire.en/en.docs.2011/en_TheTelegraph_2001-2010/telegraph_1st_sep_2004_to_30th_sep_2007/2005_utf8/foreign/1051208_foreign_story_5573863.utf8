 Suicide by China toxic spill official

 Beijing, Dec. 7 (Reuters): A deputy mayor in charge of evacuating a Chinese city where a chemical plant exploded is believed to have hanged himself, an official said today, as a toxic river flow resulting from the accident spread.

 Wang Wei, deputy mayor in the northeastern city of Jilin, had been in charge of dealing with the aftermath of the November 13 blast, state media reports said at the time.

 Id heard that hed died at home yesterday. Weve heard that he hanged himself, a senior city official said.

 Other city officials confirmed that he had been found dead at home, but would provide no other details. 

 Two others said he was not under investigation of any kind.

 Wang had been quoted as saying that the accident would not cause widespread pollution. In fact 100 tonnes of cancer-causing benzene compounds spilt into the Songhua river which provides drinking water for the 9 million people of the city of Harbin. 

 Tap water supplies had to be shut off for nearly a week.

 Official media have reported that Beijing has promised harsh punishment for anyone guilty of misconduct over the incident.

 Investigators would also look into attempts to cover up the gravity of the incident, Xinhua news agency said.

 The slick is now winding its way northeast towards the Russian Siberian city of Khabarovsk, through areas populated by millions of Chinese, but the cold winter is freezing the Songhua, slowing its movement.

 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has written to his Russian counterpart, Mikhail Fradkov, pledging cooperation with Russia to deal with the slick, the Peoples Daily overseas edition said.

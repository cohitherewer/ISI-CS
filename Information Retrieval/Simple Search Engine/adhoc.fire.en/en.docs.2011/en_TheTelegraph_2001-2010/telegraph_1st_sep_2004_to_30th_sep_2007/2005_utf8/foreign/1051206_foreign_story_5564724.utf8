 Expats turn Pak town into Beverly Hills

 ISAMBARD WILKINSON

 Mirpur (Pakistan), Dec. 5: A construction boom fuelled by money from Britain is transforming what was once one of Pakistans poorest towns into its Beverly Hills.

 The skyline of Mirpur, in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, once boasted nothing more than two-storey brick houses and mud huts.

 All that has changed since British Pakistanis returned to invest money earned in the UK in their ancestral town. Now soaring doric columns jostle with gilded porticos at the entrances of huge houses.

 The result is the regions most spectacular mix of architectural styles since the British Raj introduced disappointed gothic to the subcontinent.

 And, in a striking example of reverse cultural influence, returnees are bringing such British institutions as greyhound racing and fish and chips back to Mirpur with them.

 The UK has greatly helped improve our economy quot;, said Mohamed Chaudhry Saeed, the British honorary consul in Mirpur and the owner of three car showrooms. Noor Hussein spent 25 years in Birmingham working as a taxi-driver but is now a Mirpur estate agent.

 The boom has changed the face of the town, he said. People are building bigger and more decorous houses. It is a sort of status symbol. Property prices have gone up like in London. But compared to terrace houses over there, the houses here are luxurious. Mirpuris form about 70 per cent of the British Pakistani population of 800,000. 

 When David Blunkett, the former home secretary, lifted visa restrictions last year he made the announcement in Mirpur.

 Migration to Britain from this poverty-stricken area, known as Little England quot;, began in the 1880s when Mirpuris worked as stokers on British merchant ships.

 Another wave of migrants from the district headed to England when the nearby Mangla dam was constructed in 1969. The project displaced 100,000 people and 5,000 took up a government offer to move to Britain.

 In the 1980s, remittance wages began to flow into Mirpur, starting an explosion in demand for electric household goods such as televisions and fridges. Todays housing boom is accompanied by an increase in Internet cafes microwaves and shopping malls.

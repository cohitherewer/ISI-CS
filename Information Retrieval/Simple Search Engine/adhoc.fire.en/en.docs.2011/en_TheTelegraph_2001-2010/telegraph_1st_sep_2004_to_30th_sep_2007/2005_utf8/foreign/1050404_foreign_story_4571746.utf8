 Cairo, April 3 (Reuters): Muslims around the world today praised the late Pope John Paul?s drive to build bridges with Islam, saying his compassion and leadership changed their view of the Catholic church.

 The Pope led a campaign to help turn conflict between the world?s 1.1 billion Catholics and 1.2 billion Muslims into cooperation and visiting Syria in 2001 he became the first Pope officially to set foot in a mosque.

 ?His role was vital in gathering people in the dialogue between Christians and Muslims,? said Ali el-Samman, an adviser to the grand sheikh of Egypt?s al-Azhar mosque and university.

 Palestinian and Afghan leaders commended the Pope?s support of their people?s desire for freedom, and clerics in Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh hoped his successor would build on the Pope?s efforts to strengthen ties of understanding with Islam.

 Afghan President Hamid Karzai said: ?We remember that during the years of Afghanistan?s occupation by the Soviet Union, the Pope raised his voice of support to the Afghan people.?

 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak praised the Pope?s ?long journey of giving, during which he remained a symbol of love and peace and one who called for dialogue between religions.?

 Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said the Pope had commanded the three paths of religious learning, philosophical thought and poetic and artistic creativity.

 The first non-Italian Pope in 455 years, John Paul II threw off many of the formalities of his office, travelling widely, writing five books and putting together a CD of religious music. Many Muslims hope the Pope?s successor will continue to tread the path of understanding between the two religions that he chalked out.

 A key event along this route was the Pope?s 1986 invitation to Muslims and adherents of other faiths to pray together at Assisi for world peace.

 The Pope?s vigorous opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was widely appreciated in the Islamic world, Malaysian political analyst Chandra Muzaffar said.

 In largely Catholic Philippines, Sharif Julabbi of the Ulama League, an influential group of Islamic clerics said: ?I was touched by his gesture to pardon a Muslim who tried to assassinate him.? 

 But some in the Arab world had only disdain for the Pope. 

 ?He meant nothing to me,? said Abdul Rahman al-Mashari, an engineer in Riyadh.

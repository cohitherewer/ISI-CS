 Crowe career flies with time

 Cameron Crowe: Right time?

 Los Angeles, Oct. 14 (Reuters): For Jerry Maguire director Cameron Crowe, whose new movie Elizabethtown debuts today, his Hollywood career is all about time.

 Time, Crowe said, puts things in proper perspective.

 The saying is as appropriate for Crowe as it is for the main character in romantic comedy Elizabethtown, a young dreamer named Drew who falls into a funk after an athletic shoe he designs turns into a financial fiasco for its manufacturer.

 Crowe said he suffered a similar fate after his most recent films, 2001s Vanilla Sky and 2000s Almost Famous. Surreal drama Sky proved a hit at box offices, but was panned by critics. Famous, a personal story about a boys first love, was a critical success but a box office flop.

 From Hollywoods perspective, Crowe needs a hit from the new movie he wrote, directed and produced to retain his status as one of his generations top talents. But the director doesnt see it quite that way. Over time, he said Sky and Famous have earned loyal fans, and both have done just fine financially when box office, video and DVD sales are combined.

 Almost Famous felt like a public embarrassment, and it kind of mirrors what happens in this new movie, Crowe said. But now, however many years later, nobody remembers it was a dud in theatres.

 Elizabethtown is a personal story, although not as close to Crowes own life as Famous, in which the main character covers a rock tour for a music magazine much as Crowe wrote about music for Rolling Stone magazine.

 In Elizabethtown, Drews depression following the shoe debacle is interrupted by his fathers sudden death while on a trip home to Kentucky. So Drew goes there to arrange for the body to be returned to Oregon where Drew and his family live.

 Things dont work out exactly as Drew planned, but he is embraced by his country cousins, aunts and uncles. Their warmth and a budding romance with a flight attendant (Kirsten Dunst) he meets on his trip give Drew a new outlook on life.

 The powering thing behind the movie was to capture the feeling of being alone and going back to Kentucky and getting walloped by a sense of family I hadnt realised was so much in place, Crowe said. That root system can really surprise you, particularly if youre caught up in your own little success and failure world, and all of a sudden you realise there are bigger issues: family, life and death, he added.

 Whether Elizabethtown is eventually deemed a Maguire-like hit, a Famous-style flop, or something in between like Vanilla Sky, Crowe said he is not so concerned anymore.

 From the new movie, he said he is most struck by some words he wrote that are spoken by Drews girlfriend, Claire, who tells her moribund beau, Fail big and stick around and make them wonder why youre still smiling.

 Its hard to do, Crowe said. But its good advice. And then he grinned.

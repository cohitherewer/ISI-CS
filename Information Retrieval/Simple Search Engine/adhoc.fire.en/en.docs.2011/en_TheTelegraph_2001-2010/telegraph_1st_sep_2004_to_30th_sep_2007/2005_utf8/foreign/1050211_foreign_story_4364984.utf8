 Crush chaos at UK store opening

 London, Feb. 10 (Reuters): A man was stabbed and several people were crushed today when 6,000 bargain-hunters flocked to the midnight sale of a new IKEA furniture store in north London, emergency services said.

 Five people were taken to hospital, one with chest pains, while 22 people suffering from heat exhaustion and crush injuries were treated by ambulance crews. 

 The Swedish furniture giant was forced to close the store in Edmonton after 30 minutes when it was overwhelmed by shoppers hoping to buy heavily discounted items.

 Police said a man in his 20s was stabbed in the store?s car park 90 minutes after the shop opened and was taken to hospital where his condition was stable. IKEA?s deputy UK manager said the numbers that turned up were far greater than expected. ?We were totally shocked and overwhelmed by what happened,? he said.

 US image damaged: White House

 Washington, May 16 (Reuters): The White House said today that a Newsweek report based on an anonymous source had damaged the US image overseas by alleging that US interrogators desecrated the Quran at Guantanamo Bay.

 The May 9 report triggered several days of rioting in Afghanistan and other countries in which at least 16 people were killed.

 Its puzzling that while Newsweek now acknowledges that they got the facts wrong, they refused to retract the story, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. I think theres a certain journalistic standard that should be met and in this instance it was not.

 McClellan complained that the story was based on a single anonymous source who could not personally substantiate the allegation that was made.

 Massive waves hit Havana

 Havana, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Roaring seas in the wake of Hurricane Wilma sent massive waves crashing over Havanas famed Malecon sea wall today, flooding shoreline neighbourhoods and paralysing the city of 2 million.

 Rescuers used row boats and makeshift rafts, including inner tubes, to ferry stranded residents to higher ground as water levels rose. Parts of the 7 km wall were hidden under the sea.

 Ive never seen the sea come in so far, not even in the storm of the century (in 1993), and it is still rising, said Edith Valdez, a 44-year resident of central Havana.

 In the Vedado district, known for its Art Deco buildings, sea water penetrated four blocks inland in some parts, flooding basements of buildings and hotels. Residents waded to safety through waist-high waters carrying a few belongings.

 The deepest floods were around the Riviera Hotel, build by Mafia boss Meyer Lansky before Fidel Castros 1959 revolution ousted US mobsters and shut down their casinos and brothels.

 Ive lost everything, said a barefooted Juan Villar Cuevas, 41, who lived in a basement apartment.

 Its amazing, the streets have turned into big canals, said Olga Livia Martinez, hugging her boyfriend.

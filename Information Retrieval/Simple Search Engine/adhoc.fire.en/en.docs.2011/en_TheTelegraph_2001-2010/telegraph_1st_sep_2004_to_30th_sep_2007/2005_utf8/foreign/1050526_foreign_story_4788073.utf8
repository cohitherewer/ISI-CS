 Europe faces double rejection of treaty

 Paris, May 25: French voters appear ready to deliver a humiliating rebuff to the European establishment by rejecting the proposed EU constitution, according to opinion polls last night.

 They showed the No vote strengthening to an eight-point lead in the final days of campaigning before Sundays referendum.

 With objectors gaining ground in France and firmly entrenched in Holland, where a referendum is to be held three days later, Brussels is considering how to deal with the previously unthinkable combination of two founder members of the EU turning against the blueprint for further integration.

 A French or Dutch No could defeat the treaty outright or delay it for a number of years, frustrating its stated goal of streamlining decision-making in the expanded 25-member union.

 Each country must approve the constitution for it to take effect next year.

 A negative vote could bring months of political confusion and economic instability amid recriminations and debates over the next move.

 An opinion poll released yesterday for the magazine Paris Match gave an eight-point lead to opponents of the treaty, with 54 per cent saying No and 46 per cent saying Yes. This is the highest No score since the end of April.

 Polls show that there is still a large number of undecided voters whom the French establishment is hoping to bring over with appeals to stand by the countrys pro-European record. A majority of Dutch respondents, who vote on June 1, are also against the constitution. The constitution allows for the creation of an EU president and foreign minister with limited powers.

 Jan Peter Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister, appealed to French and Dutch voters yesterday to shun the appeals from the increasingly confident No campaigners.

 Of course it [the constitution] is not perfect, he wrote in the French newspaper Le Figaro. But it is an undeniable step towards the European ideal. A step forward, towards the Europe we want, the citizens Europe.

 In France the main focus of opposition is among voters of the Left, who see it as a British blueprint for a free-market Europe, which would sweep away the French social model.

 Laurent Fabius, the former socialist Prime Minister who is defying his partys decision to join President Jacques Chirac in a Yes vote, said: It is important that the No vote be from the Left, a Socialist no, a socially-conscious no.

 Harvard loses top professor 

 Lawrence Summers

 Cambridge (Massachusetts), April 6 (Reuters): Another member of Harvard University?s African-American studies department said yesterday he will leave the school in what one critic called the latest sign of discontent with President Lawrence Summers.

 Michael Dawson will be the third professor to leave the department this academic year and the fifth since 2002, when Prof. Cornel West ? known for his book Race Matters on race relations in America ? decamped for Princeton University following a well-publicised dispute with Summers.

 News of the departure dealt a setback both to efforts to rebuild Harvard?s once-vaunted department of African and African American studies and to Summers, who has struggled to defuse a controversy sparked by his remarks on women.

 Summers lost an extraordinary but non-binding faculty vote of confidence last month as Harvard?s undergraduate professors registered their discontent with his comment that inherent differences between the sexes may explain why so few women work in the academic sciences. 

 Dawson, 53, said he will return to the University of Chicago, the school he left three years ago to take a tenured position at Harvard.

 In an interview, he attributed his decision to leave partly to personal reasons and also to the exodus of talent from the department. ?Several of the people I thought I?d be interacting with when I accepted this position are no longer at the university,? he said.

 Following West?s departure in 2002, K. Anthony Appiah also left for Ivy League rival Princeton. In October, Lawrence Bobo and Marcyliena Morgan, who are married, said they would leave for Stanford University.

 ?The fact that Bobo and Morgan left directly influenced my decision to leave,? Dawson said. The departures of Bobo and Morgan came after Summers denied Morgan tenure, overturning what had been a unanimous backing of her request for tenure by department members.

 54 die in Iraq mosque suicide strike

 Baghdad, Nov. 18 (Reuters): Two suicide bombers killed at least 54 people when they blew themselves up inside two crowded Shia mosques in the northeastern Iraqi town of Khanaqin today, police said.

 A member of the local council said the death toll could exceed 100 after bombers attacked the mosques during Friday prayers, destroying the buildings. Another blast was reported near a bank in the town, police said

 Ibrahim Ahmed Bajalan, a member of the Diyala provincial council, said the destruction was so bad that many bodies were trapped in the rubble and couldnt be easily extracted. I think there are more than 100 people dead, he said. Police and Kurdish political officials put the death toll at 54, with 62 wounded, but said the toll could rise.

 The attacks in Khanaqin, a mixed Shia and Kurdish town northeast of Baghdad near the border with Iran, seemed certain to fuel sectarian tensions ahead of a December 15 election that Washington hopes will pave the way for peace and democracy two and a half years after the US-led invasion.

 The Shia- and Kurdish-led government and its US backers are fighting a mainly Sunni insurgency that has frequently targeted civilians in crowded places.

 Police said the bombers entered the small mosques in Khanaqin with explosive belts strapped to their waists and detonated themselves when the buildings were at their busiest.

 Zarqawi defence

 Al Qaida in Iraqs leader Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi said in an Internet audiotape today that the group did not intend to target Muslim wedding parties in deadly bomb attacks in Jordan last week. 

 In the tape, Zarqawi defended the suicide blasts on three hotels saying al Qaida had inside information that they were home to US and Israeli intelligence agencies.

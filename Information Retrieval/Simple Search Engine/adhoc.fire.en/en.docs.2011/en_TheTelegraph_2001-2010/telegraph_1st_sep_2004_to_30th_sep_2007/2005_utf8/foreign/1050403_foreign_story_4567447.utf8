 Exam spice in junk food war

 London, April 2: Children 

 do better in exams if they are given junk food for lunch, 

 new research has found.

 The findings seem to contradict the approach taken by chef Jamie Oliver, who has run a campaign for healthier school meals.

 Jamie Oliver is one of Britain?s most popular celebrity chefs. 

 Researchers found that struggling schools were manipulating their lunch menus to give pupils a lift before vital exams.

 The menus were loaded with pizzas, hot dogs, chocolate drinks and biscuits and improved test results immediately afterwards.

 The research, conducted in America and published in the British Journal of Public Economics, found that many American schools used computers to monitor the nutritional content of their meals.

 Prof. David Figlio, of Florida University, said: ?The evidence suggests that some alter their menus to try to improve test scores and the evidence indicates that this may be successful.?

 Prof. David Benton, a psychologist at Swansea University, has done tests on pupils in Britain.

 He said: ?We found an orange glucose drink increased the ability to concentrate and sustain concentration.?

 A spokesman for Jamie Oliver said: ?Jamie does not suggest that high-calorie foods should be banned. He is just trying to make sure that children get at least one nutritious meal a day.?

 Yesterday, Chris Waterman, executive director of Confed, the confederation of education and childrens services managers, said that exclusion zones could be imposed around schools to stop fast-food vans selling junk food to children during break times.

 Waterman plans to urge the department for education to give local authorities powers to ban vans selling chips, burgers and ice-creams from areas near schools.

 According to Waterman, the government?s drive to improve children?s diet will fail if they can buy fast food at the school gates. 

 ?We must not allow this to be fatally undermined by Whippy and Chippy,? he said. ?In a perfect world the fast-food industry would not target schools at lunchtimes and there would be a voluntary code. 

 ?But as that?s not likely to happen it is vital we set up exclusion zones to keep these vans away.:?

 Kathmandu, March 11: In a development ostensibly aimed at appeasing the international community including India, the Nepal government today released former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba along with 20 other leaders and cadres of various political parties. 

 The release took place two days after foreign minister Rameshnath Pandey returned to Kathmandu after a two-day official visit to New Delhi.

 Among those released were former home minister Purna Bahadur Khadka, spokesperson of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) Minendra Rijal, former lawmaker of the Nepali Congress Hari Bhakta Adhikari and his party colleague Haribol Bhattrai. 

 India, the US and Britain have set several pre-conditions for resuming military aid to Nepal. Topping the list is the release of political prisoners and restoration of fundamental rights. 

 Deuba was sacked by King Gyanendra by a royal proclamation on February 1 and immediately placed under house arrest. However, Communist Party (UML) general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala and People?s Front Nepal president Amik Sherchan continue to remain under house arrest. 

 Talking briefly to the press after his release, Deuba said he was against the royal takeover and asked the government to release other detained leaders as well. He also backed the five-party alliance?s protest programmes. 

 Deuba is scheduled to hold a press conference at his residence tomorrow. 

 Minendra Rijal said he was released by the 1st battalion of the Armed Police Force, Naxal, in central Kathmandu while 17 more leaders and cadres of various parties, including Hari Bhakta Adhikari, were released from Kharipati in eastern Kathmandu.

 Nepali Congress (Democratic) acting president Gopal Man Shrestha welcomed the release of his party?s leader and said that this was a step forward in finding a solution to the present crisis. 

 Pak aid

 Pakistan was ready to supply arms Nepal needs to fight Maoist rebels, it?s envoy to Kathmandu said today, a move that could upset India and Britain who have stopped military supplies to the Himalayan nation.

 Engineer kidnapped

 Baghdad, Dec. 5 (Reuters): Gunmen seized a French engineer from outside his home in Baghdad today, beating their screaming victim as they hauled him to their getaway car, neighbours said.

 It was the third kidnapping of westerners in Iraq in 10 days, after a lull in such abductions in recent months.

 French and Iraqi officials identified him as Bernard Planche, an employee of a non-governmental organisation who worked at the Rusafa water treatment plant in eastern Baghdad.

 The Frenchman was snatched by seven gunmen in two cars as he prepared to leave his home today in the upscale west Baghdad district of Mansour.

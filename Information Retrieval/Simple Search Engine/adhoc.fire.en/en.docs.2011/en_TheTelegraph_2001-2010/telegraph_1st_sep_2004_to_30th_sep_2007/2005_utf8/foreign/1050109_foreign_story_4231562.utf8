 Clapton to play in aid concert

 London, Jan. 8 (AFP): British pop and rock stars headlined by guitar legend Eric Clapton are to play a concert this month in aid of victims of the Asian tsunami, organisers said.

 Clapton was the first big star confirmed along with British acts such as soul singer Lemar and band Feeder. More famous names are expected to be confirmed later for the gig which will be held on January 22.

 Perhaps, inevitably, the concert at the Millennium Stadium Sports Ground in the Welsh capital of Cardiff has already been dubbed ?Live Aid II?, after the massive 1985 concerts in Britain and the US in aid of Ethiopia.

 ?We have a number of irons in the fire but I don?t want to confirm anything until people say yes,? said Millennium Stadium general manager Paul Sergeant yesterday about the prospect of other stars joining the bill.

 ?Not only have people been offering their own labour and cash but in one instance someone offered their own personal jet,? he said. ?We have got to cram in at least six months of work into two weeks. It is doable if everybody pulls together. I still aim to raise ?1 million.? Some of Asia?s biggest stars, including kung fu star Jet Li, dazzled fans in a marathon Hong Kong concert yesterday to raise funds for tsunami survivors.

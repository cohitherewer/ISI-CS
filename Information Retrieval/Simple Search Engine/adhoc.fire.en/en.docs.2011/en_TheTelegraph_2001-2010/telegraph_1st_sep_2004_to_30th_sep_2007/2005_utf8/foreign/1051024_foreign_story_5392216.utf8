 London, Oct. 23 (PTI): One person was stabbed to death and over 20 people were injured in Birmingham as police made a series of arrests and authorities pleaded for calm after a week of rioting over the rumoured sexual assault on a black girl.

 Four persons were stabbed in the clashes, including a black man, who died yesterday. Shops were hit and cars set on fire and hundreds of policemen were attacked. 

 Bishop Joe Aldred from the Council of Black-led Churches said: At the root of it are primarily young people... from the African and Caribbean community. They feel that its Asian men who are the butt of the allegations here.

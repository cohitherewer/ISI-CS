 Pirates attack more vessels

 London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Pirates attacked two more merchant ships off Somalia at the weekend, one close to where a cruise ship was hit on Saturday, a sea piracy watchdog said today, warning that the problem was out of control.

 The London-based International Maritime Bureau (IMB) said a large bulk carrier and a roll-on roll-off cargo ship were attacked on Saturday and yesterday off the east coast.

 The latter was attacked with heavy machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades close to where a US cruise liner carrying holidaymakers had been ambushed on Saturday. They opened fire with RPGs and machine guns, the bridge window was completely shattered ? the problem is totally out of control, Jayant Abhyankar, deputy director of the IMB, said.

 The IMB declined to name the ships but said both managed to outrun the pirate gangs who gave chase in speed boats. No one was injured in the attacks.

 Abhyankar called on coalition ships in the area to coordinate patrols in international waters off the Somalian coast to safeguard important merchant shipping routes. The waters have become a pirates charter, he said. 

 Worried about the security of seafarers, a major maritime union said today it had contacted the UN International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to ask the UN Security Council to assist in the fight against piracy. Piracy is a world problem, a growing plague feeding on global trade, and sad to say it goes far beyond just this one area, said John Bainbridge of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF).

 Its time for decisive action against piracy and armed robbery of ships wherever they happen, he said, adding that the growing anarchy in Somali waters was particularly worrying. The IMO said the problem of piracy, including the wave of attacks off Somalia, was very much on the agenda and had already been referred to the Security Council.

 Men-only polls in Saudi

 Riyadh, Feb. 10 (Reuters): Saudi men voted in a municipal election in the capital Riyadh today, the first stage in an unprecedented nationwide vote as the absolute monarchy inches toward reform.

 ?It took a long time to get here but we?ve broken through a psychological barrier, that we couldn?t deal with ballot boxes,? said university professor Sulaiman Enezi, who raised his arms in triumph after casting his vote.

 The polls, from which women are excluded, are part of a cautious programme of reform introduced by de facto ruler Crown Prince Abdullah. He has faced growing calls for change at home and from key ally US.

 Critics say the elections are largely a cosmetic response in which few are taking part. But diplomats say the vote does at least create a mechanism for Saudis to channel concerns.

 Voters are deciding just half the members of municipal councils, whose powers are likely to be limited. The other council members will be appointed. 

 Women cannot vote and few men registered in the Riyadh area ? just 149,000 in a city of over four million people ? reflecting scepticism that the councils will make much difference to daily life.

 ?This is a crippled democracy. If you half-appointed and half-elected, it?s not fair. We can take it this time. But I hope it no longer exists in the future,? voter Mohammed al-Homaidan, 45, said at one of several Riyadh public buildings that were converted into polling stations.

 ?But it is a step towards a bigger step in future where society raises its voice and participates in decision-making.?

 Barred from the polling stations, as they are from many aspects of public life, were Saudi Arabia?s women. Bucking the trend in Islamic countries like Afghanistan and neighbouring Iraq, Saudi rulers resisted calls for their participation.

 ?An all-male election is a lopsided one. When you exclude 50 per cent of the society and allow criminal prisoners to vote this is an insult to 9 million women,? women?s campaigner Hatoon Fassi said.

 ?Their message to us is that we?re not citizens, we?re not worthy, that we don?t exist?, said Fassi, who pushed for women to vote and stand in the election but was thwarted by powerful and conservative Wahhabi religious authorities.

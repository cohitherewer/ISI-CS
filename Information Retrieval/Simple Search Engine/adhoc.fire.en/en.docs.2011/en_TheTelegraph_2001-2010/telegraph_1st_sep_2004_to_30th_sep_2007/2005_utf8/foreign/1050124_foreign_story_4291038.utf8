 Rumsfeld?s spy arm

 Rumsfeld: Secret mission

 Washington, Jan. 23 (Reuters): The US defence department has created a new espionage arm and is reinterpreting US law to give defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld wide authority over spy operations abroad, the Washington Post reported today.

 Citing Pentagon documents and interviews with participants, the newspaper said Rumsfeld created the organisation, called the Strategic Support Branch, to end ?near total dependence? on the Central Intelligence Agency for human intelligence.

 In response, defence department spokesperson Lawrence DiRita said in a statement posted on the Pentagon?s website: ?There is no unit that is directly reportable to the Secretary of Defence for clandestine operations as is described in the Washington Post article...?

 ?Further, the department is not attempting to ?bend? statutes to fit desired activities, as is suggested in this article,? DiRita said.

 The Strategic Support Branch, which has been operating for two years, deploys teams of case officers, linguists, interrogators and technical specialists with special operations forces, according to the Washington Post.

 It has operated in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as other undisclosed locations, the newspaper reported.

 Quoting a defence department memo, the newspaper said the Pentagon may recruit foreign spies that include ?notorious figures? whose links to the US government would be embarrassing if disclosed.

 The newspaper said the defence department?s espionage activities include missions in both friendly and unfriendly states when conventional war may be distant or unlikely. Those activities traditionally fall to the CIA?s Directorate of Operations, the Washington Post said.

 The Strategic Support Branch was established with ?reprogrammed? funds and without explicit authority from the US Congress, the newspaper reported, quoting unnamed Pentagon officials.

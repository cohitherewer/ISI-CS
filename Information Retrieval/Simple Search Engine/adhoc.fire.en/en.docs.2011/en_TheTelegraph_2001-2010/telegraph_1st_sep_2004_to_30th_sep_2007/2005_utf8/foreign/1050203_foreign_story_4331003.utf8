 Court for DNA test to resolve ?Baby 81? row

 Colombo, Feb. 2 (Reuters): A Sri Lankan court today ordered a DNA test to determine whether a couple claiming to be the parents of a baby who survived last month?s tsunami were really his mother and father.

 A district judge in Sri Lanka?s eastern fishing hamlet of Kalmunai ordered the infant known as ?Baby 81? be returned to the care of staff at a local hospital, pending results of the test. ?It is better to be sure, so the DNA test is the best option,? additional district judge M. P. Mohideen told the court. ?So the court is ordering a DNA test even though there is only one couple claiming the infant.?

 The court?s decision did not go down well with the couple. ?When the judge announced the decision, the gentleman claiming to be the boy?s father almost fainted in court and threatened to kill himself,? the court?s registrar, M. S. M. Nazeer, said.

 The couple was later detained by police after an argument at the hospital where they went to see the child.

 ?The parents say they went to see the baby, the hospital staff says they tried to kidnap the child. Now the the baby is under police guard at the hospital,? said Kalmunai police inspector, Chandrasiri Wijetilleke.

 Police had contacted the judge and the couple was likely to be released, he said.

 Newspaper reports have said nine women claimed the boy as their son in the aftermath of the December 26 tsunami, but police say only one couple had said the baby was theirs.

 Others had expressed interest in adopting the baby if his real parents were not found, police said.

 Murugupillai Jeyarajah, a 31-year-old barber, and his wife, Jenita, lodged a formal custody claim with the court last month, saying documents proving the boy was theirs were lost in the tsunami.

 The infant became known as ?Baby 81? because the three-month old was the 81st person to be brought to the Kalmunai hospital the day the tsunami struck and killed about 40,000 people Sri Lankans.

 ?Baby 81? miraculously survived the giant waves that thrashed his village and was found amidst the debris by rescuers. Jeyarajah and his wife found him in the hospital after searching for days. But their happiness was short-lived as doctors were not willing to release him without confirming that the couple were his real parents.

 A DNA test could take months and samples will have to be sent to the capital Colombo, more than 200 km away. Hospital staff are keeping the baby?s room locked until then. Child protection authorities today sought public help to track down orphans after an initial survey showed that 995 children had lost both parents.

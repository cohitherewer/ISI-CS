 Tehran ups nuclear ante

 Tehran, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Iran insisted today it would resume uranium conversion this week after rejecting European Union incentives to end its nuclear fuel work, and said it was not worried about being referred to the UN for possible sanctions.

 Although we think referral of Irans case to the Security Council would be unlawful and politically motivated, if one day they refer Irans case...we wont be worried in the least, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi.

 Britain, Germany and France, heading nuclear negotiations with Iran for the European Union, have called an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agencys (IAEA) board of governors on Tuesday to discuss Irans case.

 The EU trio say they will recommend referring Iran to the Security Council if it goes ahead with plans to break U.N. seals and resume work at the Isfahan uranium conversion plant.

 Iran, which on Saturday rejected an EU package of economic and political incentives designed to persuade it to halt nuclear fuel work for good, says it will restart the Isfahan plant as soon as IAEA surveillance equipment is in place.

 The European proposal has no value, state television quoted Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying.

 We will insist on our rights and have decided to resume Isfahan activities as the first step of our measures. This does not mean we will stop negotiations with Europe.

 German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Iran faced economic sanctions if it refused to accept the EU proposals.

 I dont think anyone at the moment is thinking about a military confrontation, he told ARD television.

 If Iran doesnt back down, one has to expect it will be referred to the Security Council. If that happens we will be talking about possible sanctions. This would not be good for either side. Therefore I have to say I am very worried by Irans apparent decision to choose a course of confrontation.

 London, July 24: The Metropolitan Police have reported a huge surge in the number of applicants since the bombings on July 7.

 We have seen a huge increase, said an official at the recruitment centre in Hendon, north London. 

 Many want to do volunteer work, but weve also had inquiries from people who ask specifically about anti-terrorist and undercover work.

 She compared the rise with the increase in enlistments during wartime.

 In another sign that the blitz spirit may be returning to Britain, counselling organisations have reported a drop in custom, as Londoners have been cared for by their friends and neighbours.

 Some commuters, however, remain jittery: travellers have been buying commuter emergency kits and booking first-aid courses amid alarm about the second wave of terrorist attacks to hit London. 

 SurvivalBox said sales of its commuter kits have increased by 150 per cent since the July 7 bombings, which claimed 56 lives.

 Simon Johnson, 38, the managing director, said sales had shown signs of returning to normal but bounced up again after last Thursdays failed attacks.

 The kits contain a dust mask, torch, whistle, water and antiseptic wipes. Johnson said: I dont think Londoners are frightened at all. They want to show that they are not afraid and to carry on with their daily lives. People want to get on the Tube, but they want a bit of reassurance.

 Commuters have also been taking first-aid classes. The St John Ambulance said its London district office had recorded a 25 per cent rise in bookings since July 7. A spokesman said: We shall be supplying more courses to meet demand.

 The British Red Cross, which trained more than 140,000 Britons in first aid last year, said inquiries in the London area had nearly doubled since July 7, and had increased by 80 per cent nationwide.

 Transport for London said, however, that the only noticeable dip in Tube passenger numbers were on lines partially closed because of the attacks. On these lines, a spokesman said, there had been corresponding increase in bus passenger numbers.

 On Friday morning, at the Shepherds Bush Central Line station, less than 500 yards from the site of Thursdays attempted bombing on the Hammersmith and City Line, Jennifer Forde, a 23-year-old working in television production, described her emotions. 

 Last night, after the bombing down the road here in Shepherds Bush, I didnt want to get back on the Tube so I walked all the way home to West Acton, quot; she said.

 This morning, though, I knew I had to get back on the Tube and I wasnt especially nervous. I just decided I cant worry about the future forever and do nothing.

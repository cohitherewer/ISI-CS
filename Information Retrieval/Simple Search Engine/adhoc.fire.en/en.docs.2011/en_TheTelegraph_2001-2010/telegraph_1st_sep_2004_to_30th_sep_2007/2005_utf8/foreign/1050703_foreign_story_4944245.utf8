 Deep Impact craft ready

 Paradena (California), July 2 (Reuters): A Nasa spacecraft is healthy and ready for its July 4 collision with a comet and has already provided images critical to understanding the building blocks of life on Earth, officials said yesterday.

 While still roughly 2.4 million km from its target, the fast-moving Deep Impact craft is on track for its Saturday release of a coffee-table sized impactor that is expected to blast a stadium-sized crater into comet Tempel 1.

 Both the fly-by and the impactor spacecraft are healthy and ready for encounter operations, Deep Impacts mission manager, Dave Spencer, said at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

 At 0552 GMT on Monday, the 350 kg copper-fortified impactor is expected to smash into the comet at 37,010 kph.

 Although all of the spacecrafts systems appear to be in working order, officials said there were contingency plans in place if the impactor failed to detach from the ship. One alternative includes sending both to collide with the comet.

 Tempel 1, which JPL scientist Don Yeomans described as a jet black, pickle-shaped, icy dirt ball the size of Washington DC, will be about 133 million km away from Earth at the time of the crash. 

 The aim of the mission, the first to come in direct contact with a comets nucleus, is to photograph material formed billions of years ago during the creation of the solar system.

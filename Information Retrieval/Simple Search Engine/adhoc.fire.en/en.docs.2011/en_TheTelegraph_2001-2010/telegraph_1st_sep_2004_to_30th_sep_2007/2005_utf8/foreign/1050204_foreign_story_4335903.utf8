 Hug that electrified speech

 Washington, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The mother of an American Marine who died in Iraq and an Iraqi human rights activist celebrating her vote in Iraq?s election tearfully embraced in the US Congress yesterday, providing a dramatic highlight to President George W. Bush?s State of the Union speech.

 Clutching a military identification dogtag, Janet Norwood rose with her husband Bill from their seats next to First Lady Laura Bush when the President honoured their son, Sergeant Byron Norwood, as representative of ?freedom?s defenders.?

 Iraqi activist Safia Taleb al-Suhail, who had waved her ink-stained finger from Sunday?s voting as Bush introduced her earlier in the speech, turned from her seat to embrace Janet Norwood.

 Both women showed tears, long applause rang from the lawmakers and dignitaries in Congress, and Bush blinked, his eyes moist, as he stood on the podium.

 Sergeant Norwood, of Pflugerville, Texas, was killed by sniper fire during the US assault on Falluja in November. ?We have said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our freedom,? Bush said.

 Referring to al-Suhail, an adviser to the Iraqi foreign ministry, Bush said: ?Eleven years ago, Safia?s father was assassinated by Saddam?s intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country, and we are honoured that she is with us tonight.?

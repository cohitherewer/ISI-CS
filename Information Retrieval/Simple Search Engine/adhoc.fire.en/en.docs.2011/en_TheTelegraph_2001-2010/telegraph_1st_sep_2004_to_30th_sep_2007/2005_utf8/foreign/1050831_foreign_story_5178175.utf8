 Woman defies burqa ban in Belgium

 DAVID RENNIE

 Brussels, Aug. 30: A Moroccan woman living in a small town in Belgium has single-handedly triggered a national debate on multiculturalism after refusing to obey a municipal injunction to stop wearing a burqa.

 The woman has now prompted politicians in the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium to talk about changing federal law, after she became the first person in Belgium to be fined for wearing the all-enveloping veil and robe.

 She has so far refused to pay the ?80 fine, or even to co-operate with police and municipal authorities in the Flemish town of Maaseik.

 The womans husband was named in a Brussels court yesterday as one of 13 men accused of aiding and abetting terrorists linked to the Madrid train bombings.

 Khalid Bouloudo, 30, a pastry chef, is alleged to be the Belgian co-ordinator of the Groupe Islamique Combattant Marocain, an anti-western organisation linked to the Madrid blasts and the 2003 bombings in Casablanca that killed nearly 50 people.

 The burqa has been banned by bylaw in the cities and towns of Ghent, Antwerp, Sint-Truden, Lebbeke and Maaseik.

 The mayor of Maaseik, Jan Cleemers, said he acted after six women started wearing burqas, alarming locals.

 found trace of Xenophobia in authors attitude

 Blyton: Not for an adult eye

 London, Nov. 20: Enid Blyton, one of the worlds best-loved childrens authors, was branded a racist and ridiculed for her absurd plot lines by her own publisher, the Daily Telegraph can reveal. 

 Documents discovered in the archives of Macmillan show that the company, which had previously published eight of the authors works, was scathing about her 1960 offering The Mystery That Never Was. 

 An internal assessment of the book, which was submitted at the height of Blytons fame, does not pull any punches. 

 The report compiled for Macmillan by Phyllis Hartnoll, the theatre critic, who also worked as a reader for the company for 35 years, is critical of almost all aspects of the work. 

 Hartnoll wrote: There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the authors attitude to the thieves; they are foreign (though one of them is called Harry and they generally talk in English) and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality. 

 The book tells the story of a boy called Nicky Fraser who invents a mystery tale while he is home for the Easter holidays. 

 Nicky, who is aided by his best friend Ken, hopes that a false trail of clues will engage a visiting uncle who has been feeling down. 

 To the amazement of both boys and the uncle, the clues become real and the mystery takes on a life of its own. The story reaches its climax when they confront a group of thieves in an underground cave. 

 Hartnoll is scathing about the plot, which she says has no merit beyond superficial competence. 

 The characterisations are painfully thin and the plot does not stand up to examination, she wrote. We never know why the treasure was left in the cellars or how the thieves know about it. They behave with incredible stupidity and the device of signalling from the hill, which would have attracted the attention of half the neighbourhood, is transparently absurd. 

 She concludes: This is not a book that would reflect any credit on our list, and I think we should reject it.

 The review is one of hundreds of readers reports in the Macmillan archive which have been recently purchased by The British Library. 

 Hartnolls comments seem to predate criticism of Blyton which became fashionable for a short time in the 1980s. 

 In 1982 Channel Fours Comic Strip series lampooned some of the authors most famous characters in Five Go Mad in Dorset. 

 The revelation that a company which published her work was making similar criticisms in 1960, however, will surprise many. 

 Gillian Baverstock, 74, the authors daughter, said she was unaware of Hartnolls review and last night defended the book. It is not one of her best but it is a perfectly acceptable story, she said. 

 She added: I think in those days when you were looking for characters or people who did wrong things you went for foreigners or people from foreign climes. It gave the story an extra frisson. 

 Tony Summerfield of the Enid Blyton Society, last night said he was astonished that Macmillan had been so scathing about the book given that the company had previously published some of her most famous works, including Island of Adventure. 

 He said Hartnoll came across as a prim librarian in her review and was guilty of reading a childrens story with an adults eye. 

 Enid did not give a damn about what the critics said. All she cared about was what the children thought. I think Macmillan were stupid to turn the book down because she was selling very well at the time. 

 Blyton, whose books have sold 400 million copies in 40 languages, would appear to have had the last laugh. The book was subsequently taken up by Harper Collins who printed it in 1961. It was published again in 1965 and 1983. 

 Blyton, whose most famous creations included Noddy, The Famous Five and The Secret Seven died in 1968. 

 Other readers reports in the archive concern the works of Vladimir Nabokov, William Golding and C.P. Snow. They show that Macmillan was not adverse to publishing titles which were criticised by its professional readers

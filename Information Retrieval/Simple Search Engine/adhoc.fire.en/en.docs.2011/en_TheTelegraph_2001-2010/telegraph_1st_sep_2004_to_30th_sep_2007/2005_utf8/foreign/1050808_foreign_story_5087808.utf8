 US Saudi missions shut down

 Riyadh, Aug. 7 (Reuters): US diplomatic missions in Saudi Arabia will be closed on Monday and Tuesday because of a threat against US buildings, the US embassy said today.

 It said the embassy in Riyadh and the consulate in the Red Sea city of Jeddah would be closed on August 8 and 9 in response to a threat against US government buildings in the kingdom.

 The embassy advised US citizens to maintain vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase security awareness.

 Last month, the US warned Americans in Saudi Arabia that militants were planning fresh attacks in the worlds biggest oil exporter, and later banned military personnel from travelling around the kingdom. But it said it had no specific information about the timing, target or method of any possible attacks.

 US diplomatic missions in the kingdom have been closed several times in recent years because of threats of violence.

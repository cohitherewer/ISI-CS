 Scot family of five swept into sea

 AUSLAN CRAMB

 London, Jan. 13: A family of five were killed at the height of the worst storm for a decade as they attempted to escape from their flooded home.

 A married couple, their two young children and one grandparent were in two cars when they were swept into the sea from an exposed causeway in the Western Isles, northern Scotland.

 It is thought that Archie and Murdina MacPherson were driving to a relative?s house when they were overwhelmed by a combination of hurricane force winds and high seas.

 One body, thought to be that of Archie MacPherson, was found on the shore yesterday morning near the village of Creagorry, on the island of Benbecula. A partially submerged car was spotted in the water nearby.

 Police and coastguard teams were yesterday still searching for the bodies of Murdina MacPherson, her two children, Andrew, six, and four-year-old Hannah, and her father Calum Campbell, a well known piping instructor. An unidentified second body was reported to have been found last night.

 The family had moved to South Uist recently and were in the process of renovating an old house in the village of Bualadubh. 

 Archie MacPherson was a builder and his wife formerly worked for the BBC?s Gaelic department in the Western Isles.

 One local spoke of seeing headlights on the low-lying causeway ? which links Benbecula with South Uist ? saying they were ?there one minute, and then they just disappeared?.

 Neil Buchanan, a friend of the family, said: ?We believe they were leaving their home to get away from the flooding. But they must have been hit by a wave as they were driving away in their cars.?

 Peter Carlin, a councillor who lived near the family, said: ?This tragedy is something that has affected us all. They were obviously very desperate when they left their house to try to get to safety at the height of the storm. Some people here have some damage to their houses or belongings, but this tragedy puts it all in perspective. We?re all deeply shocked.?

 The family were heading for the home of MacPherson?s parents, thought to be only two miles from the causeway, when the accident happened on Tuesday night. Worried relatives contacted the police when they failed to arrive at their destination.

 Chief superintendent John D?Arcy said last night he was afraid the worst storm since 1993 had caused a ?major tragedy?. 

 More than 85,000 homes were left without electricity at the height of the storm, and more than 40,000 people in the Highlands were still without power last night.

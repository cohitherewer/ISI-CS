 Zarqawi?s bomb mastermind nabbed

Baghdad, Jan. 24 (Reuters): Iraqi forces have 

captured one of al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi?s top bombmakers in Iraq, the 

Prime Minister?s spokesman said today.

 Sami Mohammed al-Jafi, known as Abu Omar al-Kurdi, is accused of being behind some 32 car bombings since the US-led invasion of Iraq, he said.

 Kurdi was arrested on January 15 but his capture was announced now, just a week before Iraq?s landmark elections in which Prime Minister Iyad Allawi is running on a list that promises to bring security to beleaguered Iraqis.

 ?Kurdi has confessed to some 75 per cent of the car bombs that were used for attacks in Baghdad since March 2003 and to making the explosives used in the attack on the Jordanian embassy in August 2003,? spokesman Thair al-Naqib said. 

 ?Kurdi also confirmed he was responsible for some of the bloody attacks on the police.? Iraqi forces said they also captured another insurgent earlier this month, Nayef Abbas al-Zubaydi, who heads the Abu Talha group linked to Zarqawi in Mosul, Naqib said.

 Zubaydi, known as Abu Moawiya, was captured barely two weeks after the arrest of the previous leader of the group, Zain Abdallah Salah Khalaf al-Jib, or Abu Karam.

 In an audio tape posted on the Internet yesterday, Zarqawi vowed all-out war against the elections and described those planning to participate as ?infidel voters?.

 Insurgents have stepped up attacks intended to derail Iraq?s January 30 poll. Zarqawi has claimed responsibility for some of the bloodiest suicide bombings and hostage beheadings to hit the country.

Blast near PM office

 A suicide car bomber launched an attack today near a checkpoint on a Baghdad street leading to the office of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi?s party, wounding at least seven policemen and three civilians, officials said.

 Allawi was not in the area at the time of the blast, said officials in the Prime Minister?s office. The blast echoed across central Baghdad, and a plume of smoke rose from the scene of the bombing.

 US and Iraqi troops sealed off the area and helicopters buzzed overhead. Zarqawi?s group said it had carried out the bombing.

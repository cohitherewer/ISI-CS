 Van Gogh kins killer jailed for life 

 Amsterdam, July 26 (Reuters): A Dutch court sentenced the self-confessed killer of a Dutch filmmaker critical of Islam to life in jail today, calling the murder which whipped up racial tensions in the Netherlands a terrorist attack.

 Mohammed Bouyeri, an Amsterdam-born Muslim, was convicted of killing Theo van Gogh as he cycled to work on November 2, 2004. 

 Van Gogh, a descendant of the brother of the 19th century painter Vincent van Gogh, angered many Muslims by making a film which accused Islam of condoning violence against women.

 Bouyeri fired seven bullets into Van Gogh with a pistol in a busy Amsterdam street in the morning rush hour, slashed his throat and plunged two knives into his body. Bouyeri was later arrested after he was wounded in a gun battle with police.

 Theo van Gogh was mercilessly slaughtered, judge Udo Willem Bentinck told a packed hearing of Amsterdam District Court, guarded by heavily armed police.

 Bouyeri, a devout Muslim with Moroccan parents, had wanted to die a martyr and regarded himself as an instrument of Allah, the court was told. He killed Van Gogh because he regarded the filmmaker as an enemy of Islam, the judge said.

 The courts three judges ruled that Bouyeri had shown no remorse during his trial for a murder carried out with terrorist intent in order to provoke fear and undermine Dutch democracy.

 The terrorist attack on Theo van Gogh has prompted great feelings of fear and insecurity in society. Moreover, this attack had a destabilising effect. In the days after the murder there were several attacks on mosques and Islamic schools, the judge said.

 Dressed in a grey robe and black and white headscarf, the 27-year-old Dutch-Moroccan remained impassive as the judgment was read out in court.

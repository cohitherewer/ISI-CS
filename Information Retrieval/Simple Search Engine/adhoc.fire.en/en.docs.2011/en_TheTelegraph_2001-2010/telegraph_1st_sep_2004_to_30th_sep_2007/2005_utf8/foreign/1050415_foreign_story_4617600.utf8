 Bushi beetle

 Bush

 New York, April 14 (Reuters): President George W. Bush, vice-president Dick Cheney and secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld can now also be called bushi, cheneyi and rumsfeldi, or simply slime-mould beetles.

 Two former Cornell University entomologists named three species in the genus Agathidium after the US leaders, Cornell announced yesterday. Quentin Wheeler and Kelly Miller christened 65 new species of slime-mould beetles.

 Wheeler, now head of entomology at the Natural History Museum in London, said the leaders were being honoured for having ?the courage of their convictions.? The bushi beetle is found in southern Ohio and North Carolina; rumsfeldi is from Oaxaca in Mexico, and cheneyi is from Chiapas, Mexico.

 Another leaning Pisa tower

 Pisa (Italy), March 28 (AP): The city of Pisa is set to get another leaning tower.

 More than 600 years after this city?s most famous monument went up, officials here have approved construction of a modern office building about 5 km southeast of the original that will simulate a tilt with a trick of lighting, Milan daily Corriere Della Sera reported yesterday.

 Construction of the steel building ? designed by architect Dante Oscar Benini ? is scheduled to begin at the end of summer and last four years, according to the newspaper. 

 It also will house apartments and shops and is expected to cost $ 64.8 million.

 Already, some are denouncing the project as a scandal. ?Towers of steel and glass 57 metres high serve only to deface the view,? Fabio Roggiolani, a Green Party representative in the regional council told Corriere.

 But the city?s urban planner, Giusppe Sardu, said the second tower will attract tourists.

 Japan-China talks fail to halt free fall in ties

 Beijing, April 18 (Reuters): Japan and China held talks in Beijing today but failed to halt a free fall in ties after a third weekend of demonstrations in China against what many see as Japans inability to face up to its wartime past.

 There was little sign of headway after the violent protests which, along with disputes over territory, a Japanese history textbook and Tokyo?s bid for a permanent UN Security Council seat, have dragged relations to their lowest point in decades.

 Japanese foreign minister Nobutaka Machimura met state councillor Tang Jiaxuan, a former foreign minister with broad responsibility for diplomatic issues, who noted that Machimura was visiting ?under very difficult circumstances in Sino-Japanese relations?, established in 1972.

 Tang urged Japan to ?seriously review? its actions and take measures to correct them, Xinhua news agency reported.

 ?I had thought that the Chinese side would express a somewhat more frank feeling over the repeated destruction as well as violence toward Japanese,? Machimura said after the meetings.

 ?I find it unfortunate that they could only deal with the situation by reading from a prepared text,? he said. ?It is very unfortunate that there is no consideration of the feelings of the Japanese.?

 But Machimura also said there were positive aspects to his trip. ?There have been several agreements to promote exchanges in various areas between Japan and China,? he said.

 ?If we can successfully coordinate the dates, (Chinese) President Hu (Jintao) and (Japanese) Prime Minister (Junichiro) Koizumi may be able to hold a meeting later this week? in Indonesia, when they visit the country for the Asia-Africa summit, the minister said.

 Thus far, the two sides have appeared to be talking past each other in discussions on a high-stakes economic partnership that brings $178 billion in annual trade and which Tang has described as ?at a crossroads?.

 Even as a violent demonstration raged in Shanghai, authorities headed off protests in Beijing, where thousands of demonstrators had hurled rocks and bottles at the Japanese embassy only a week earlier.

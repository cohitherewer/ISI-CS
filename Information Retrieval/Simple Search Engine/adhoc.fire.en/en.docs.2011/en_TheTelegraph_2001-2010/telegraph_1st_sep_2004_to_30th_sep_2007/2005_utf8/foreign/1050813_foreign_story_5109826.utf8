 Fatal Fridays

 London, Aug. 12 (Reuters): British drivers using motorways should be aware of the Frustrated Fatal Fridays phenomenon, when they are more likely to be killed, seriously injured or stuck in traffic, the Royal Automobile Club foundation said today.

 The foundation has analysed figures showing when the most accidents happen, with Friday afternoon and early evenings being the worst. August, when most people take their summer holidays, was the worst month.

 Statistics showed that more accidents and heavy congestion occurred between 4 pm and 7 pm on a Friday. 

 Mice surf

 Canberra (Reuters): Australia ? land of sun, sand and ... surfing mice? Australian Shane Willmott is training three mice, named Harry, Chopsticks and Bunsen, to surf small waves on tiny mouse-size surf boards at beaches on the countrys Gold Coast. The mice are put through rigorous bathtub training and then some have their fur dyed when it is time to hit the beach. Usually if he is surfing big waves, I usually colour his hair up. Because hes white, when he gets in the whitewash its hard to find him, Willmott told Australian television.

 Fiery man 

 Draguignan, France (Reuters): A French fireman, a favourite of journalists reporting on forest fires in southern France, admitted to starting seven of them on Thursday, a fire brigade source said. Police found incriminating evidence at the home of the fireman, whom they had suspected for some time, the source said. The fireman, who regularly talked to journalists about the fires in the Var region, will be detained pending investigation. Investigators will look into whether he might have been responsible for more of the fires.

 Rare malt

 Dublin (Reuters): A rare bottle of Irish whiskey is up for sale at a record ?100,000 , making it the worlds most expensive single malt. The whiskey ? spelled whisky in Scotland ? dates from the late 1800s and is believed to be the last surviving bottle from the Nuns Island Distillery in County Galway, western Ireland, which ceased production in 1913. It is a lot of money but its like looking for the last dinosaur really, spirits expert Ken Thomas said on Friday.

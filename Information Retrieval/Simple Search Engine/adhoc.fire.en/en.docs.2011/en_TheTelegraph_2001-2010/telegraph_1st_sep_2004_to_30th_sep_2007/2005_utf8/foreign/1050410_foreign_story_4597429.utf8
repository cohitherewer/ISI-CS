 Expert nod for Camilla outfits

 London, April 9: The Duchess of Cornwall?s outfits for her wedding to the Prince of Wales were a ?double triumph?.

 The duchess wore an oyster silk basket-weave coat and chiffon dress for the civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall, then a porcelain blue silk dress for the blessing of her marriage at St George?s Chapel. Sandra Boler, consultant editor and former editor of Brides magazine, said the first outfit was ?stunning? while the second was ?utterly beautiful?.

 Of the first, she said: ?The outfit had to look stunning but not over the top in the Guildhall, and it really worked. The colour is right, the style is right ? it is elegant and gently romantic. 

 ?The colour goes perfectly with her hair and her fair complexion, everything about it was very flattering.?

 And of the second, she said: ?The colour is not bright and garish. It is elegant, discreet and flattering. It is utterly beautiful and totally tasteful, perfect for a blessing for a second marriage. quot;

 Both outfits were designed by Robinson Valentine, a team established in 1986 by Antonia Robinson and Anna Valentine, who had met on a pattern-cutting course. Anna Valentine has been designing outfits for the Duchess for the past four years.

 The outfit at the Guildhall was an oyster silk basket-weave coat with herringbone stitch embroidery and a chiffon dress with applique woven lacquered disc detail. The designers wanted a ?crisp clean look with subtle detailing?.

 The lacquered discs were made in Switzerland while the hand-worked herringbone detail on the coat was embroidered in-house using silk thread. 

 The garment was hand finished.

 The Duchess wore an elegant court shoe at the

 Guildhall in pale beige suede, with an almond toe and

 a 5cm heel, designed by Linda Bennett, founder of LK

 Bennett.

 The Duchesss handbag was an quot;East/West quot; clutch made

 from embossed calf leather, lined with suede and made

 with a half flap.

 The inside was imprinted with the Launer name and

 Royal Warrant and also included a matching coin purse

 and leather covered mirror.

 The brides hair was prepared by Hugh Green of Hugh

 and Stephen, based at Ebury Road, London. He has been

 styling the Duchesss hair on special occasions for

 nearly two years.

 Her make-up was by Julia B.

 The Duchess changed into a porcelain blue silk dress

 with hand painted ikat design, hand embroidered with

 gold thread work, for the blessing.

 Tones of blue and gold were the favoured colours.

 The design was based on a piece of jewellery 

 Clarence House said the designers starting point was

 the Duchesss comment that she liked the style of the

 velvet dress they had designed for her to wear for the

 gala night at the Royal Opera House.

 A piece of jewellery which belonged to the Duchesss

 mother became the inspiration for the fabric design.

 The Duchess later wore a court shoe with a soft point

 toe and a 5.5cm heel in pale grey shot silk.

 The shoe had a subtle gold embroidery detail on the

 toe. It was bespoke and designed to match the dress,

 by Linda Bennett.

 The Duchess wore a Swarovski-tipped gold leafed

 feather head-dress designed and made by Treacy.

 She carried a small, simple elegant floral bouquet

 bound with silk from her dress.

 Complementing the grey blue of her dress, Auricular

 flowers in dusty shades of greys and creams with

 touches of gold had been mixed with clusters of Lily

 of the Valley.

 The flowers were cut from English plants later to be

 grown in the gardens at Highgrove.

 A sprig of myrtle, representing happy marriage, was

 sent from a well wisher in Cornwall for the bouquet.

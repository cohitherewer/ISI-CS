 Saddam, gassed amp; betrayed

 Saddam: Foul play?

 London, Dec. 19 (PTI): For the first time recounting the moments of his capture by American troops two years ago, former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, through his lawyer, has claimed that he was gassed while hiding in his bunker and betrayed.

 The once-feared despot, who was captured from an underground shelter on a farm near his hometown Tikrit in December 2003, broke his silence in an interview published in the British tabloid The Sun today. The interview was done through his lawyer, Ramsay Clark.

 I came out of the house where I was hiding by this hole. I went through the trapdoor. I went down the hole, through the tunnel, then lost consciousness, Saddam was quoted as saying.

 Clark said Saddam thinks he was gassed in the tunnel. He told us he spent may be minutes in this tunnel, not hours or days, he added.

 When he started to get out there were soldiers around that area. There was supposed to be a motorcycle there. It was gone. Saddam knew the person who owned the house wasnt there. He knew he had been betrayed. Probably American soldiers did not discover the hole. They were told about it. 

 Saddam told his lawyer that he had hoped to emerge unnoticed in nearby bushes and then escape on the motorcycle. I believe I was betrayed. I have been set up.

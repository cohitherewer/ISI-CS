 Israel move sours Abbas swearing in

 Ramallah (West Bank), Jan. 15 (Reuters): Mahmoud Abbas was sworn in as Palestinian president to succeed Yasser Arafat today, but his call for a truce and talks were overshadowed by Israel?s decision to cut ties over a deadly militant attack.

 The ceremony at the battered West Bank compound where Arafat is buried was also soured by further violence in the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops there killed six Palestinians, including some gunmen, witnesses said. ?Our hand is extended towards an Israeli partner for making peace,? said Abbas, calling for a ceasefire by both sides.

 ?Peace can only be achieved by working together to reach a permanent status solution,? he said, restating his support for a US-backed peace ?road map?.

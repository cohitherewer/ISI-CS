 Bangladesh young sons wait in wings

 Hasina: Future Joy

 Dhaka, April 29 (PTI): Dynastic politics is here to stay in Bangladesh?s two main political parties.

 Opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed?s son Sajib Wajed Joy has begun to tread the political waters after Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia?s elder son Tareq Rehman followed in his mother?s footsteps by becoming a senior leader of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

 Joy, who is based in the US and is married to an American, travelled to his scientist father?s village in northern Rangpur district where he met the electorate.

 ?I will not only work for the Awami League (party), but also Bangladesh,? he said, adding that he was here to help his mother. 

 Dressed in a formal suit, unlike other Awami leaders who were attired in pyjama, kurta and the ?Mujib coat?, Joy said at a meeting in Dhaka that fanaticism, violence and corruption were the major obstacles to the country?s development. ?Bangladesh is passing through difficult times due to the growing link between religious fundamentalism and terrorism in recent years,? Joy said. 

 On the economy, Joy backed initiatives to privatise or sell off sick factories and said: ?Privatisation does not mean making thousands unemployed?. He said Bangladesh should move forward for the sake of development and not waste time on ?debates over the past incidents.?

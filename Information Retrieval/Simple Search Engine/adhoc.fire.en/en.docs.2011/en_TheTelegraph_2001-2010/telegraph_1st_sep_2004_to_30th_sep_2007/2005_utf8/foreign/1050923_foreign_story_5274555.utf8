 Moss ends silence, says sorry

 Moss: Remorseful

 London, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Kate Moss broke her silence today following newspaper allegations she had snorted cocaine, apologising to friends, family and business associates for her behaviour.

 But her statement made no specific reference to reports last week in The Mirror tabloid featuring grainy pictures that apparently showed the 31-year-old taking large quantities of cocaine.

 I take full responsibility for my actions, she said. I also accept that there are various personal issues that I need to address and have started taking the difficult, yet necessary, steps to resolve them.

 I want to apologise to all of the people I have let down because of my behaviour which has reflected badly on my family, friends, co-workers, business associates and others.

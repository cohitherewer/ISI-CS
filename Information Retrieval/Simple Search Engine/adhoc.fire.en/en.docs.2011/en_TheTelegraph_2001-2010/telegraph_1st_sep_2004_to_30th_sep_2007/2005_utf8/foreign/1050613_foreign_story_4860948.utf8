 Londons minnows race against giants of New York amp; Paris

 on Olympics

 London, June 12: Two little-known British film-makers will be pitched against the might of Steven Spielberg and Luc Besson in a final attempt to secure the 2012 Olympic Games for London.

 Caroline Rowland and Darryl Goodrich, from the London-based New Moon Productions, will make the film summarising Londons bid that will have a crucial bearing on the International Olympic Committees final vote in Singapore on July 6. 

 The film plugging New York ? one of Londons two chief rival cities to host the 2012 Games ? will be made by Spielberg, famous for a host of Hollywood blockbusters. The one promoting Paris will be by Besson, the leading French director behind films such as Leon and The Big Blue.

 The choice of two movie-making- giants is a clear sign that Paris, the favourite, and New York, which is just behind London in the betting, are planning one last big push to clinch the Olympics.

 All three cities, plus their rivals, Madrid and Moscow, have one last chance to win votes at the meeting in Singapore. The films will play an important role in influencing the IOCs decision.

 Rowland and Goodrich, who produced Make Britain Proud, the first London Olympic bid film, and have made advertisements for Revlon and Peugeot, admit that they face tough competition, but say they are not daunted by the prospect.

 Rowland, 37, who is also the founder and managing director of New Moon, an independent company making advertisements, corporate films and documentaries, said: Our company is only eight years old, so were probably more hungry than Spielberg and Besson and that is quite important.

 Also, you cannot underestimate the amazing feeling and momentum it gives you to be put in the same category as people you have spent years admiring and, in some cases, tried to emulate.

 Details about their film are being kept secret, but Rowland said it would be even better than Make Britain Proud and would be a celebration of London as an iconic city, filmed at various locations, showing the capitals diversity and featuring athletes from across Britain. 

 Its a very ambitious film and its totally different from the last one, she said.

 I cant tell you about the content, as to get the full impact it needs to be a huge surprise. I can guarantee that it will make you feel emotional.

 The production budget was just over ?500,000. Rowland said that, in keeping with the spirit of Londons bid, they were keen to promote new talent. Having a smaller budget lends itself to helping young directors get into the film industry, she said. Many people see it as a labour of love and are giving up their free time to make this work.

 Confidence is running high at New Moon following its success at this years International Visual Communications Awards in London, where the company won 13 prizes, included the Grand Prix award for Make Britain Proud. The new film will last for three-and-a-half minutes.

 The first film followed Jo -Ankier, a young female runner, on a journey through London, while showcasing some of the citys best-known sites including the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. It includes cameo appearances from internationally recognised figures, including Roger Moore, David Beckham, Kelly Holmes and Matthew Pinsent.

 Paris and New York are keeping most of the details of their films secret. The New York bid ran into trouble last week when proposals for the showpiece West Side stadium were rejected. The city has until tomorrow to decide whether to pull out of the race. Work on its film was, however, continuing this weekend. The film will contain scenes and interviews with New Yorkers at three locations: Wall Street, Battery Park and Brooklyn Heights.

 The French supporters are confident that their film will help Paris host the Games in seven years time, but the London team believe that the efforts of New Moon will help them to secure the necessary number of votes.

 A spokesperson for the London Olympic challenge said with two million people now signed up to the campaign backing the bid, momentum is building day by day, and New Moon is the perfect example of the fresh creative talent that London has in abundance, which is what our bid is about.

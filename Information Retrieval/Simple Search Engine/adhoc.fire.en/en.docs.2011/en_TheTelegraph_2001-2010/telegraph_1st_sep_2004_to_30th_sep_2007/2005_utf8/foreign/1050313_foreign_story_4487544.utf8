 Leno last laugh

 Los Angeles, March 12 (Reuters): A judge yesterday gave late-night TV comedian Jay Leno his blessing to tell virtually all the jokes he wants about pop star Michael Jackson and his child molestation trial.

 Siding against Jackson?s lawyers, Santa Barbara county superior court judge Rodney Melville ruled that Leno was not bound as an entertainer by a gag order in the case even though he was a potential trial witness.

 Melville said the host of NBC?s The Tonight Show is prohibited only from talking about issues pertaining to testimony he might give in the case. 

 ?He makes his living as a comedian and a talk show host and it?s not the court?s intent to stop him,? Melville said during the hearing. 

 There was no immediate word from The Tonight Show as to whether Leno would resume personally poking fun at Jackson during his opening monologues or continue with a running gag of handing off jokes about the pop star to a series of guest comics. On Thursday night, it was Drew Careys turn: ?What does Michael Jackson call a school bus? Meals on Wheels.?

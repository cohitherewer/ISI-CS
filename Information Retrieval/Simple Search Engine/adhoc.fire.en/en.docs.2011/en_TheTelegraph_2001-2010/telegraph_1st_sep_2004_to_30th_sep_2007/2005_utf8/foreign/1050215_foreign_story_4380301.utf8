 Italians walk after car ban

 Rome, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Italians took to the streets on foot and bicycles yesterday in seven major cities including Rome, as authorities banned cars and even scooters in an effort lower the levels of smog sullying the skyline.

 The stepped-up campaign came as many Italian cities fast approached their yearly limits for particulate matter emissions under EU rules.

 Each city is obliged to keep levels of small particles in the atmosphere below a set level for at least 330 days a year. But some of Italy?s biggest urban centres, especially in the north, seem destined to miss that target as early as February.

 Financial capital Milan has already nearly reached the yearly limit, exceeding the EU levels during 34 days up to February 9, according to a study by Euromobility, published on its Internet site, www.euromobility.org. 

 Other cities, including Turin have already surpassed the limit. 

 ?We?re not breaking the law. The EU rules require us to intervene, and were intervening,? Turins mayor Sergio Chiamparino, who proposed a multi-city auto ban, said in a newspaper interview.

 Disney chases Potter dream with Narnia

 Los Angeles, Dec. 2 (Reuters): A film starring a talking lion, an evil witch and a magic wardrobe may give the Walt Disney Co. something it desperately needs ? a Harry Potter-like franchise to rejuvenate its lagging film business.

 Disneys film version of the beloved 1950 childrens book, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by Christian author C.S. Lewis, hits US theatres on December 9, riding a massive marketing push.

 We literally left no stone unturned, said Dennis Rice, senior vice-president of publicity for Walt Disney Studios. We went after all fans equally and aggressively.

 The movie, which cost an estimated $250 million to make, represents a bet the studio can score a box-office hit on the order of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which took in $181 million worldwide its first weekend last month.

 I think its a very big factor for the company, Lawrence Haverty, portfolio manager at Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust, said of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.

 If you have a family film that is successful, it is of enormous financial consequences for the company. Youre talking about a franchise value in the billions of dollars, he said.

 Disney and its partner in the film, Walden Media, stand ready to make up to six more films based on The Chronicles of Narnia.

 Disney and Walden are aiming for the success of the Harry Potter film franchise, which has scored more than $3 billion in global box office from four of seven planned films.

 US ponders N. Korea trip

 JEHANGIR S. POCHA 

 Beijing, Sept. 22: Christopher 

 Hill, the US nuclear negotiator, is exploring the possibility 

 of visiting North Korea before a new round of six-party 

 talks designed to de-nuclearise North Korea begin here in 

 early November, according to Chosun Ilbo, South Koreas 

 largest-circulation newspaper.

 The reports said Hill expressed his wish to visit North Korea while meeting South Korean unification minister Chung Dong-Young in Seoul on September 12, the eve of inter-Korean ministerial talks, and that he was even open to holding talks with the communist states supreme leader, Kim Jong-Il. If the visit takes place, it would mark a major change in policy for the US, which has so far refused to negotiate bilaterally with Pyongyang. 

 But this could be the season of compromises. Until last weeks breakthrough agreement at the six-party talks in Beijing, Washington had refused to give Pyongyang any of the security guarantees that it eventually did, and which were instrumental in getting North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons programme and rejoin the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 

 Though Pyongyang changed its tune within 24 hours of signing the agreement by demanding the US supply it with a light-water reactor to be used for civilian purposes before it surrendered its weapons programme, many analysts say that is just another example of Pyongyangs famously tough and erratic negotiation style. Despite the naysayers today, my argument (that the agreement will progress) stands right, said Steven Noerper, a North Asia specialist with the Nautilus Institute in Washington DC. 

 If both North Korea and the US can carry forward their fragile d?tente, it could bring an end to the last and longest-running conflict of the Cold War.

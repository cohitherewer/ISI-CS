 Polanski wins libel case

 London, July 22 (Reuters): Roman Polanski won his libel case against Vanity Fair today, ending a week-long trial in which he gave video evidence from Paris to avoid extradition to America where he is wanted for having sex with a girl aged 13.

 The film director was awarded ?50,000 ($87,500) in damages, and his solicitors estimate that Vanity Fairs bill could run as high as ?1.5 million.

 The 71-year-old went to court in London to sue the magazines publishers over an article in July 2002 alleging he had tried to seduce a woman in a New York restaurant while on his way to his slain wifes funeral in August 1969.

 Vanity Fair conceded the article was inaccurate, saying the incident actually took place weeks after Sharon Tates murder by followers of the Charles Manson clan, but maintained the gist of the contested passage in the article was true.

 It goes without saying that, whilst the whole episode is a sad one, I am obviously pleased with the jurys verdict today, Polanski said in a statement.

 Three years of my life have been interrupted. Three years within which I have had no choice but to relive the horrible events of August 1969, the murders of my wife, my unborn child and my friends. Tate was eight-and-a-half months pregnant when she was killed. 

 Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, said outside the court that he found the decision amazing.

 As a father of four children, one of them a 12-year-old daughter, I find it... outrageous that this story is considered defamatory given the fact that he cannot be here because he slept with a 13-year-old girl a quarter of a century ago. Polanski can be extradited from Britain to the US for his 1977 crime, but not from France, were he was born.

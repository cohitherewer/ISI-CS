 Holocaust dissent in Britain

 London, Jan. 25 (Reuters): British Muslim leaders are unwilling to attend Thursday?s commemoration of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, arguing that Holocaust Memorial Day should honour victims of genocide everywhere.

 Britain?s main Islamic group said it should be called Genocide Memorial Day and commemorate all mass killings, including Bosnia, Rwanda and in Palestinian territories where up to 3.6 million Palestinians live under Israeli occupation.

 ?Israel has also committed mass killings,? said Inayat Bunglawala, spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain. ?It has dispossessed a Palestinian nation. It is an insult to them if we don?t recognise their deaths. The cry ?Never Again? should be for all people.?

 ?We are not belittling the Holocaust. We share the immense pain and anguish felt in the Jewish community about the Holocaust, but feel Britain is a multi-faith country and everyone should be involved,? Bunglawala said.

 Russia anger

 Accusations by a group of Russian lawmakers that Jews provoke anti-Semitism enraged the country?s Jewish community today. About 20 nationalist deputies put their names to a letter calling on the general prosecutor to investigate Jewish organisations and ban them under a law against extremism.

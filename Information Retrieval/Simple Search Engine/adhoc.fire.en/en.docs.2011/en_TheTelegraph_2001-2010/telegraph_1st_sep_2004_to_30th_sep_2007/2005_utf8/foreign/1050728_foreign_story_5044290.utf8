 Party picks Chandrika successor

 Colombo, July 27 (Reuters): Sri Lankas ruling party has chosen Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as its next presidential candidate when the country votes for a successor to Chandrika Kumaratunga, a government source said today.

 Sri Lankas main political parties are locked in a bitter feud over the timing of the next poll, with the main opposition United National Party (UNP) in full election mode having already nominated former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as its presidential candidate.

 First elected President in 1994, Kumaratunga argues her second and final six-year term should end in late 2006. But she went for re-election a year early, and Wickremesinghe, who heads the UNP, is adamant that means her second term ends this year.

 The islands elections commissioner will have the final say ? he must call the election by next month if it is to be held this year. (Rajapaksa) was the obvious choice from the beginning, a senior government source said.

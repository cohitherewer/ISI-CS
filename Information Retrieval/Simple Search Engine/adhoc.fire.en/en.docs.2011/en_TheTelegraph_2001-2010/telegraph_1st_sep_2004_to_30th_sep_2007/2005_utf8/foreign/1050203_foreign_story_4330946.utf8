 Fine Print

 New toy boost

 London, Feb. 2 (Reuters): British condom maker Durex launched a range of vibrators today that can be bought online and sent discreetly wrapped to customers in the mail.

 ?We have helped remove any embarrassment you may have about buying one,? said Durex?s group marketing controller Mark Critchley.

 The line of rechargeable, three-speed ?personal massagers? was developed after the company?s research showed growing ownership of vibrators in Europe and the US. 

 Skin stuck

 London (Reuters): A plan by an animal 

 rights activist to sell-off a lizard tattoo on her right 

 arm came unstuck on Tuesday when the online auction house 

 she was using pulled the plug on electronic bidding. eBay 

 UK removed ?Lizard Skin?, an auction offered by Ingrid Newkirk, 

 the British founder of Peta because her ad breached guidelines. 

 Peta, the world?s biggest animal rights group, said eBay 

 regarded the tattoo as ?human remains?. 

 Newkirk said she was unimpressed by the move: 

 ?I am just another animal, these are animal remains,? she 

 said. ?You can?t miss the irony when it is acceptable to 

 steal skins from their original owners and auction them 

 off, but forbidden to auction a person?s voluntarily offered 

 skin to be surrendered only upon her death.?

 Jailed dogs

 Mexico City (Reuters): Deprived of their flat-screen TVs, mobile phones, pizza deliveries and long visits from lovers, inmates at Mexico?s top security prison complained on Monday they are being treated ?like dogs.? A government crackdown in prisons has the prisoners of La Palma jail close to Mexico City up in arms at the ?sub-human? conditions they face. On Monday, they paid for a full-page advertisement in Mexico?s top daily Reforma and called on President Vicente Fox to respect their human rights.

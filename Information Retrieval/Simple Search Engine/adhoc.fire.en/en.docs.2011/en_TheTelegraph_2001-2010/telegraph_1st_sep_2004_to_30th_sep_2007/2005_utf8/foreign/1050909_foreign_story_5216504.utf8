 Saddam confession denial

 Amman, Sept. 8 (Reuters): Saddam Husseins chief attorney denied today that the ousted President had confessed to ordering executions and waging a campaign against Kurds in which thousands of people are said to have been killed.

 There was no confession by the President and all the investigations in this case do not implicate him at all, Khalil Dulaimi said.

 Iraqi President Jalal Talabani told state television on Tuesday that an investigator who questioned Saddam told him he had extracted important confessions from him and that the ousted leader had signed them.

 Dulaimi said the investigator who was leaking information about the course of the interrogation should resign because he was prejudicing the outcome of the trial.

 If its true that a certain judge had mentioned anything about the course of the investigation to Talabani then this judge should resign immediately, Dulaimi said.

 At any rate Talabani should not give statements on any matter that relates to a judicial process that ought to be conducted in confidence to ensure justice, he added.

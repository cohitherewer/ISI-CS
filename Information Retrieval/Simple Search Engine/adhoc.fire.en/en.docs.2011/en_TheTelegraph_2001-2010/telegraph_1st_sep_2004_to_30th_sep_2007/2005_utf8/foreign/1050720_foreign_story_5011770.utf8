 UK for ban on fail

 London, July 19: The word fail should be banned from use in British classrooms and replaced with the phrase deferred success to avoid demoralising pupils, a group of teachers has proposed.

 Members of the Professional Association of Teachers (PAT) argue that telling pupils they have failed can put them off learning for life.

 A spokesman for the group said it wanted to avoid labelling children. We recognise that children do not necessarily achieve success first time, he said. But I recognise that we cant just strike a word from the dictionary, he said. The PAT said it would debate the proposal next week.

 All smiles Euan

 Euan Blair was all smiles yesterday as his parents, Tony and Cherie, joined hundreds of parents at Bristol University to see their children graduate. The Prime Minister and his wife watched amid tight security as their eldest son was presented with his degree in ancient history.

 Euan, 21, was awarded a 2:1, the same class of degree that his father achieved in law at Oxford in 1975. Wearing a black suit under his gown and burgundy sash, Euan politely told reporters that he could not comment on his graduation. 

 His parents sat in the front row with Cherie Blairs mother, Gale Booth. 

 David Bate, 21, a history graduate, said the Blairs clapped and applauded every student. When Euan was given his degree, his dad gave him a smile, he said.

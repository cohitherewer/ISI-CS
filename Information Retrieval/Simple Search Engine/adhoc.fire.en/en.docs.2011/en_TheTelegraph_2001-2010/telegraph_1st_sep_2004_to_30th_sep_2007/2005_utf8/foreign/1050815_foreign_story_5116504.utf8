 Ban on actor at Olivier service

 CHRIS HASTINGS

 Branagh: No entry?

 London, Aug. 14: Kenneth Branagh was banned from Laurence Oliviers memorial service at Westminster Abbey. 

 Oliviers family kept the young pretender to the Shakespearean throne away as they did not want him upstaging the event. The disclosure is contained in a new authorised biography of Olivier, which has also sparked a bitter family feud by shedding light on the actors homosexual past.

 In Olivier, The Authorised Biography, Terry Coleman reveals that the Oscar-winners family reacted with horror when the Prince of Wales suggested that Branagh should represent him at the memorial service in Westminster Abbey in 1989. They feared that such a prominent role for the then 28-year-old, who like Olivier had directed his own film version of Henry V would have stolen Oliviers thunder on the very day he was meant to be centre stage.

 As Charless representative, Belfast-born Branagh would have taken precedence over everyone else at the ceremony and would have entered Westminster Abbey last while everyone else stood.

 Oliviers family feared that the sight of mourners, who included Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Peter Toole, Lord Attenborough and Alec Guinness, deferring to the newcomer, who was already being hailed as the next Olivier, would have caused a media frenzy and undermined the tribute to the actor, who died aged 82.

 Coleman writes: His family and friends were firm that he really could not be upstaged by Branagh at the service. Laurence Harbottle (the executor of Oliviers estate) thought that the Prince of Waless nomination showed real poverty of imagination.

 He adds: Richard Olivier (his son) thought several senior actors would have died on the spot and knew that the last thing his father would have wanted at his memorial was the apparent crowning of an heir to his throne.

 In the face of protests, Branaghs nomination was withdrawn and he was replaced by the safe Lord Attenborough. 

 The biographys most controversial disclosures, however, deal with Oliviers sexuality. Coleman, who was given access to all of Oliviers private papers and correspondence, disputes the suggestion made in recent years that the actor was a promiscuous bisexual. The author does, however, believe that Olivier had a fling with fellow matinee idol Henry Ainley.

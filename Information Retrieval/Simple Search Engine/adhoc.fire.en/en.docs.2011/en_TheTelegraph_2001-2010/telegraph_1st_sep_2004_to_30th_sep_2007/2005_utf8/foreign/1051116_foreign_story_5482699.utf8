 Drinking crackdown in Britain

 London, Nov. 15 (Reuters): Britain launched its biggest ever crackdown on binge drinking and alcohol-fuelled violence today, just days before new laws will allow pubs to stay open longer.

 The Christmas and New Year campaign will target bars, pubs and clubs that sell alcohol to under-18s and to those who are already drunk, the home office said. Police will also target drunken behaviour with on-the-spot fines and rely on intelligence-led work to identify town-centre venues that cause problems for the local community.

 We know that many Londoners will be out celebrating the festive period in the weeks ahead and we want everyone to enjoy doing so in a safe environment, commander Chris Allison said. New licensing laws come into effect across England and Wales on November 24 which will allow pubs to stay open for longer.

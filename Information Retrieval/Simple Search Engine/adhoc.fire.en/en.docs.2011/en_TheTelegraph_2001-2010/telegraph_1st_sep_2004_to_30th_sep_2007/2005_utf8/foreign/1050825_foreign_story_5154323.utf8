 US emission pact

 New York, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Officials in nine northeastern US states have come to a preliminary agreement to cap and later reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, the New York Times reported today, citing a confidential draft proposal.

 If the agreement is made final, it would be the first of its kind in the US. The US refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a greenhouse gas reduction plan that has been adopted by more than 150 other countries.

 Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont came together in 2003 to form a coalition, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, in order to explore a market-driven cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide emissions in the absence of mandatory emissions reductions at the national level.

 Under the plan, carbon dioxide emissions would be capped at 150 million tonnes a year, about equal to the average emissions in the highest three years between 2000 and 2004, the paper said. In 2015 reductions would be required, which would reach 10 per cent in 2020.

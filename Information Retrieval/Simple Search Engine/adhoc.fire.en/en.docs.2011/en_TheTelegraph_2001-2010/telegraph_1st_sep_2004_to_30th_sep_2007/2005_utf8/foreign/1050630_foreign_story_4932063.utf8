 Pervez justice

 Islamabad, June 29 (Reuters): Pakistan wants to ensure gang-rape victim Mukhtaran Mai finds justice, President Pervez Musharraf said today, as he invited women from around the world to come and tell of their abuse and recommend solutions.

 Mai, 33, was gangraped on the orders of the traditional village council in 2002 after her brother ? who was 12 at the time ? was judged to have offended the honour of a powerful clan by befriending a woman from the tribe. The rape and subsequent acquittal of five of the six men convicted of attacking her provoked an international outcry and focused attention on the plight of women in rural Pakistan.

 I have always condemned in the strongest possible terms the actions of powerful groups to seek revenge on those who are weak by humiliating their women, Musharraf said in a statement posted on his website (www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk).

 The government remains committed to all the victims of such offences, including Mukhtaran Mai, in their quest for justice according to law, he said. Mai has lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the acquittal of the men convicted of attacking her. The court yesterday ordered the re-arrest of 13 men accused of involvement in the gang.rape.

 Angel of death in school carnage

 Bemidji (Minnesota), March 22 (Reuters): A high school student shot dead nine people and then killed himself yesterday at Minnesota?s Red Lake Indian Reservation in the worst school shooting since the 1999 Columbine massacre, authorities said.

 Among the dead at Red Lake High School were a male security guard, a female teacher and at least six students including the gunman, the FBI said. At least a dozen others were wounded in the carnage.

 Today, officials sealed off the remote town, 100 km south of the Canadian border, while they investigated yesterday?s bloodbath.

 Floyd Jourdain Jr., chairman of the Red Lake Indian council, called the tragedy ?the darkest day in the history of our tribe.? The shooter was Red Lake High School sophomore Jeff Weise, according to witnesses and school officials.

 Weise identified himself in Internet site postings as ?Todesengel,? German for ?angel of death? and ?NativeNazi,? the St Paul Pioneer Press reported.

 He also claimed to have been questioned by police in 2004 about an alleged plot to shoot up the school on the anniversary of Adolf Hitler?s birthday, but said he had nothing to do with that, the report said. ?I guess I?ve always carried a natural admiration for Hitler and his ideals, and his courage to take on larger nations,? the newspaper quoted Weise as saying in one forum used by neo-Nazis.

 Other reports described Weise as someone who was often teased at the school.

 Before arriving at the school, Weise shot dead his grandfather, identified as veteran tribal police officer Daryl ?Dash? Lussier, and Lussier?s girlfriend at their home in Red Lake village.

 The gunman then drove his grandfather?s police car to the school, where he killed a male security guard, a teacher and five students before taking his own, the FBI said.

 ?We believe the shooter was acting alone,? FBI agent Paul McCabe said, adding the dead at the school were all in one room. One victim was identified by a friend as teacher Neva Rogers, 62, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune newspaper reported.

 Weise fired at doors of classrooms barricaded by terrified students and teachers, witnesses said.

 ?He came into the school and the first person he shot was the security officer at the door,? said Molly Miron, editor of the Bemidji Pioneer newspaper. ?One of the students told me he pointed his gun at a boy and then changed his mind, smiled, waved at him, and shot somebody else.?

 Police, alerted to the massacre when students used cellphones to call for help, said they exchanged gunfire with Weise who ducked into a classroom and shot himself.

 Witnesses said he was armed with a shotgun or rifle and at least one handgun. The gunman?s motive was not immediately known, the FBI said, though a classmate told a local television station that he had spoken a year ago of wanting to ?shoot up the school.?

 It was the deadliest US school shooting since the April 20, 1999, Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in which 14 students ? including the two killers ? and a teacher died.

 In 2002 a gunman in Erfurt, Germany, killed 13 teachers, two students and a policeman at the Gutenberg secondary school before killing himself.

 The Minnesota reservation 100 km south of the Canadian border is controlled by the Ojibwa tribe, commonly known as the Chippewa, which says it has roughly 10,000 members, about half of whom live on the reservation.

 The tribe runs its own affairs and operates casinos in the state and a small casino in Red Lake, 55 km north of Bemidji on the shores of Lower Red Lake.

 Kabul, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Taliban fighters failed to sabotage Afghanistans first legislative elections in decades, with millions of voters turning out today for a ballot President Hamid Karzai called a defining moment for the nation.

 There was no major violence against voters, despite more than two dozen harassing attacks by the guerrillas across the troubled south and east in which at least 14 people died. 

 Were building our country, were making our parliament, said Mohammed Twahir, 36, after voting in the southern city of Kandahar, once a bastion of support for the Taliban. Before there was no democracy, now we have democracy. Democracy means freedom.

 That enthusiasm was echoed by many other voters.

 Im so happy, I couldnt sleep last night and was watching the clock to come out to vote, said Qari Salahuddin, 21, in the eastern city of Jalalabad soon after voting began.

 There was an early scare in Kabul when two rockets hit a UN compound near an election centre shortly after polls opened, wounding an Afghan worker. Most of the fatalities occurred in violence near the Pakistani border, just before and during the UN-organised vote.

 Rockets and mortars killed at least five civilians, two of them children, and a mine blast killed a French soldier. A Taliban fighter died attacking a polling station overnight and three more were killed in a clash in which two policemen died.

 But the UN-Afghan election commission said voting in the first legislative elections since 1969 had been remarkably peaceful and the government hailed a victory over the insurgents.

 It went very well, beyond our expectations. After all their boasting, its a big failure for the Taliban, said interior ministry spokesperson Lutfullah Mashal.

 Voting was held at over 6,000 polling sites from the deserts of the south to the towering Hindu Kush mountains of the northeast, one of the most difficult logistical operations ever undertaken by international electoral workers. About 12.5 million Afghans registered to vote for a lower house of parliament and provincial councils for which about 5,800 candidates sought seats. 

 Chief electoral officer Peter Erben described it as a peaceful and good election free of significant security incidents and said he believed turnout had been high, although election observers said it appeared fewer had voted than in last years presidential election.

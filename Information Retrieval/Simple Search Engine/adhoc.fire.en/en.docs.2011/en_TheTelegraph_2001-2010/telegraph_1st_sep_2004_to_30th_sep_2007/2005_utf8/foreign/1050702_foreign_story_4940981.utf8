 Inspiration behind Keiras film dies 

 Keira Knightley

 Los Angeles, July 1 (Reuters): A British model turned Los Angeles bounty-hunter who inspired an upcoming movie has died of undetermined causes in Hollywood but the studio said yesterday it planned to go ahead with its August release.

 Police said Domino Harvey, 35, was found in her Hollywood home late on Monday and pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Police said their initial investigations showed no evidence of foul play and indicated Harvey had drowned in her bathtub.

 Coroners official Lieutenant Fred Corral deferred pronouncing on the cause of death saying the coroner wanted blood and drug tests that would take eight to 10 weeks. 

 Harvey was released on bail at the time following an arrest in May on drug charges. Harvey, the daughter of late British actor Laurence Harvey and former Vogue model Pauline Stone, was educated at elite British schools, became a model, then a ranch hand and firefighter in San Diego, California.

 In 1994 she began working for a bail bonds agency in Los Angeles where she hunted down fugitive drug dealers and robbers. Her story inspired the movie Domino, starring British actor Keira Knightley and directed by Tony Scott. Domino never failed to surprise or inspire me over the last 12 years, Scott said in a statement.

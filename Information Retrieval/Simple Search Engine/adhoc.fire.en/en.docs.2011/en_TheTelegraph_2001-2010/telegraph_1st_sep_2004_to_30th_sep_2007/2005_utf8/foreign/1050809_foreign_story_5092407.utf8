 Rebels wife attacked

 Tehran, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Agents from Irans judiciary raided the house of hunger-striking dissident journalist Akbar Ganji today and struck his wife, a family member said.

 A judiciary spokesman said he would not be able to comment until tomorrow.

 The family member, who declined to be identified, said: They raided our house this morning and searched it. They collected some personal stuff and took it with them.

 The family member added that Masoumeh Shafiee, Ganjis wife, was bruised after the agents struck her.

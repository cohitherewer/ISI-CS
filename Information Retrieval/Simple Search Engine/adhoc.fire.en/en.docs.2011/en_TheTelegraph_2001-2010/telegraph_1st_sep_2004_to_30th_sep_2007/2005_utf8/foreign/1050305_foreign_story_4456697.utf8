 Expert disputes findings

 Sydney, March 4 (AFP): An Australian academic, who has examined the skeletal remains of a three-foot hominid discovered in an Indonesian cave, disputed today a report that they represent a new species of humans.

 Prof. Maciej Henneberg, head of anatomy at Adelaide University, said he thought the bones were simply those of a normal human stunted by microcephaly. ?This skeleton is not a skeleton of a healthy individual. I am simply saying this is a human being who suffered from a growth disorder,? he said.

 Coronation streets ahead of Charles wedding 

 London, April 11 (Reuters): The long-awaited wedding of previously married, middle-aged lovers was a big weekend television hit, drawing about 12 million viewers in Britain.

 But only about 7.3 million watched the nuptials of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. The fictional marriage of Ken Barlow and Deirdre Rachid on Britain?s most popular television programme, Coronation Street, attracted about 64 per cent more viewers on Friday night than the royal wedding did on Saturday.

 Alison Sinclair, a spokeswoman for the long-running soap, was magnanimous in victory. ?I?m not going to sit here and crow about it,? she said. ?Coronation Street has a very, very loyal following, and it was on at 7.30 pm on a Friday night. The Royal Wedding was on sporadically throughout Saturday, which is a very busy day for a lot of people who are out doing shopping. They were two very different sorts of events,? she added.

 It is not the first time the beloved soap opera characters have waged televised matrimonial battle with the Prince of Wales.

 Ken and Deirdre, portrayed by William Roache and Anne Kirkbride, married for the first time in July 1981, the same week Charles wed Diana Spencer. Both those ceremonies lured approximately 20 million UK watchers, according to media reports.

 Korea on brink of first nuke blast: US

 FRANCIS HARRIS

 Kim Jong-il

 Washington, May 7: Americas spy satellites have detected frenetic activity in North Korea indicating that the secretive Stalinist state is on the verge of detonating a nuclear weapon for the first time. 

 The preparations include the construction of a reviewing stand that might be used by Pyongyangs leadership to observe a test explosion.

 Intelligence officers regard that as highly significant since Kim Jong-ils regime constructed a similar stand seven years ago when it fired a new missile over Japan, an act which triggered a major regional security crisis.

 Three US officials described evidence of extensive tunnelling in the countrys north-east in an area called Kilchu, similar to that required for an underground nuclear blast, the New York Times reported. The work was said to resemble the activity associated with Pakistans nuclear test in 1998.

 The activity could not be explained by commercial mining, American officials said. To prepare an underground test site, earth is removed and a nuclear device is placed deep underground before the spoil is reused to seal up the shaft.

 The aim is to keep the radioactivity underground. ?You see them ? taking material back into the mine to plug it up,? an official explained. Bush administration officials told the newspaper that it was possible that the activity was designed to fool the Americans, to ratchet up the pressure on them to give ground to the impoverished state in negotiations.

 On Thursday, President George W. Bush made a lengthy telephone call to Hu Jintao, the Chinese President, during which they discussed North Korea. Washington has also passed the intelligence material to its allies in the region, including Japan and South Korea.

 Beijing confirms first human flu cases

 Beijing, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Chinas ministry of health today confirmed the countrys first-ever human cases of bird flu, reporting two in the central province of Hunan and one in eastern Anhui, the official Xinhua news agency said.

 The agencys brief dispatch gave no further details. China has been trying to contain about a dozen outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus among poultry in at least six provinces in the past month.

 The World Health Organisation said it had been informed by China that a 9-year-old boy from Hunan province suspected of having bird flu was indeed stricken by the H5N1 virus, as was his 12-year-old sister, who fell ill and died in October.

 In October, China reported that hundreds of chickens and ducks had died in Wantang village in Xiangtan County, near Hunans provincial capital of Changsha. After mass culling and disinfection, the area was declared free of bird flu this week.

 Chinese officials initially reported that the two children in Hunan had suffered pneumonia and not bird flu, but later invited international experts in to help confirm the cases. The boy, He Junyao, was discharged from hospital last weekend.

 Earlier today, the health ministry said it had not reached a final conclusion regarding the two cases.

 WHO spokesman Roy Wadia said the third case was identified as a woman in Anhui province. The global health organisation had sent a team of experts to Hunan, but was not involved in an investigation in Anhui.

 Its not a surprise. It shows that China like other countries that have bird flu in poultry can have human cases, Wadia said.

 Xinhua did not identify any of the victims. Anhui reported an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry on Monday. Xinhua did not elaborate on the condition of any of the three cases.

 Wadia also said a teacher in Hunan had fallen ill with symptoms of pneumonia and was still considered a suspect bird flu case. A poultry worker in the northeastern province of Liaoning, where an outbreak was reported among domestic birds this month, also was considered a suspected case, he said.

 Human cases of bird flu have killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003.

 So far the H5N1 strain has not shown it can spread easily among people, but scientists fear it may mutate into a form that can do so and spark a global pandemic. Whether it happens in China, Vietnam, or any other country that hasnt reported bird flu yet remains to be seen, Wadia said.

 Outbreaks among poultry also have been reported in Chinas western region of Xinjiang, and in the central province of Hubei and the northern region of Inner Mongolia.

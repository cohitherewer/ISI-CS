 Lanka bans orphan adoption 

 Colombo, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Sri Lanka has banned the adoption of children orphaned by a deadly tsunami until further notice after receiving unconfirmed reports that some children were snatched in the wake of the disaster, government officials said today.

 The UN has voiced concern that criminal gangs could target children orphaned or separated from parents across a host of Asian countries devastated by the disaster to sell them into slavery, but no confirmed cases have surfaced in Sri Lanka.

 ?Adopting the children until a permanent solution is implemented is illegal,? government spokesman Managala Samaraweera said after a cabinet briefing.

 ?Not even a Sri Lankan can adopt a child affected by this disaster until the government has come out with their programme,? he added. ?Even if they are relatives, they are not expected to take children without government permission.?

 Lalith Weeratunga, secretary to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse, said the government had received reports of child snatching from witnesses in areas affected by the December 26 tsunami. ?There are reported incidents,? Weeratunga told a separate news conference. ?If you look at the newspapers there are notices to find children who (witnesses) say have been snatched.?

 ?There is a whole lot that needs to be done to ensure they are totally safe,? he added, saying over 9,000 children had been affected by the tsunami. However, there were no details on how many children had been orphaned or the number of children adopted since the tsunami.

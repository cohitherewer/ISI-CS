 Tigers accuse army of killing top leaders

 Welikanda (Sri Lanka), Feb. 8 (Reuters): Sri Lanka?s Tamil Tiger rebels today accused the military of ambushing and killing one of their top political figures, saying the attack would severely hurt efforts to forge lasting peace after two decades of civil war.

 E. Kousalyan, political head of the LTTE eastern wing, was shot dead along with three companions late yesterday in a government-controlled area in Sri Lanka?s restive east.

 A driver and a pro-rebel former MP were also killed. Kousalyan was the most senior rebel killed since a 2002 ceasefire left the Tigers? bloody fight for autonomy in the north and east in limbo.

 ?Definitely it is going to (cause) severe damage between the parties,? S. Puleedevan, secretary-general of the Tigers? Peace Secretariat, said from the rebels? northern stronghold of Kilinochchi.

 ?It really is a setback for the whole (peace) efforts and the confidence-building measures,? he said. ?The Sri Lankan military intelligence and the paramilitary groups are always working together targeting the LTTE members.?

 Sri Lanka?s military has denied any hand in the ambush, and suspects a breakaway rebel faction led by renegade commander Karuna ? who used to dominate the area ? was responsible.

 The government condemned the attack, saying in a statement it had been timed to erode nascent cooperation between the two sides that has sprouted following Asia?s tsunami.

 The attack took place near the village of Welikanda on a remote stretch of jungle road 500 metres from a no-man?s land that separates rebel-held and military-held areas near the Tigers? eastern stronghold of Batticaloa. 

 Police said they suspected two unidentified gunmen ambushed the van in which Kousalyan was travelling, spraying the vehicle with automatic weapon fire.

 ?This is the most serious attack since the ceasefire,? said Timo Telen, a member of a Nordic team monitoring the truce.

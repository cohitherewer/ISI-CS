 Dhaka, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Security forces in Bangladesh have arrested Mufti Abdul Hannan, accused of leading the Bangladesh chapter of the Islamist militant group Harkatul Jihad, police said today.

 They said Hannan had been in hiding since July 2000 after police found a powerful bomb, suspected of being planted by Harkatul Jihad activists, near a rally addressed by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in western Kotalipara area.

 Last night, members of the elite Rapid Action battalion ? made up of police and armed forces ? arrested Hannan at a house in Dhakas Madhya Badda area and seized explosives and bomb-making materials.

 He appeared before a court in the capital today, wearing a bullet-proof vest, witnesses said. Hundreds of people thronged outside to catch a glimpse of Hannan, they said. 

 The court ordered he be held for 10 days pending further questioning over the July 2000 bomb and other bombings in the country since then.

 Some 500 small bombs exploded on August 17, killing two people and wounding about 100. 

 Police said Hannan, Harkatuls operation commander in Bangladesh, was among the countrys top terrorists but they were not certain if he or his men were involved in the bombings despite media reports, citing unnamed intelligence sources, saying they were.

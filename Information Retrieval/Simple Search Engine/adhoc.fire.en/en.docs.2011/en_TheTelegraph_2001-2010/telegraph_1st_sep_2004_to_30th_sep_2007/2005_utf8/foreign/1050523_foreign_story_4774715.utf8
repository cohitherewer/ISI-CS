 Sharon on pullout mission

 New York, May 22 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon began a three-day visit to the US today to rally support from American Jewish leaders for his Gaza pullout plan.

 On the flight to New York, Sharon reaffirmed to reporters his bedrock demand that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, due to meet President George W. Bush at the White House on Thursday, rein in militants before peacemaking can resume.

 He also said the pullout in Gaza and part of the West Bank would go ahead in mid-August despite reports senior officers were urging a six-month delay over security concerns and the slow pace of preparations for taking care of evacuated settlers.

 This report has no basis. The disengagement is to be carried out on the exact date that has been set, Sharon said. I think it will begin on the 16th or the 17th of August.

 Under heavy security, Sharon was to attend a rally in his honour hosted by US Jewish organisations at Baruch College in Manhattan later in the day.

 Sharon is to hold a series of meetings with American Jewish leaders tomorrow to brief them on his withdrawal plan and deliver a policy address on Tuesday in Washington to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group.

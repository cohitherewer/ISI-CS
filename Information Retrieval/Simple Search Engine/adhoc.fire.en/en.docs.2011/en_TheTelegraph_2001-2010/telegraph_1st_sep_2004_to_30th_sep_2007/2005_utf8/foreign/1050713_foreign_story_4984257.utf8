 Europe to cut off terror cash lifeline

 Brussels, July 12 (Reuters): The EU agreed today to speed up measures to cut off funding for terrorist groups after bombs killed at least 52 people in London last week.

 British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said he was also putting the issue of sanctions against countries that did not act against terror financing on the agenda of IMF meetings this autumn.

 Brown said after chairing a meeting of EU finance ministers the 25-nation bloc was united in its desire to destroy the monetary lifelines used by groups accused of terrorism.

 Just as there will be no safe haven for those who perpetrate terrorism, there will be no hiding place for those who finance terrorism, he said. Across Europe, we will act as one to send a message to terrorism... terrorism will always be defeated by democracy.

 The EU had already adopted an action plan to combat money laundering and banking secrecy that help the illegal moving of money following the September 11 attacks on the US and the March 2004 Madrid bomb blasts. Banks can no longer operate on the principle that they can provide services to anybody, Brown said.

 Treasury officials said no new initiatives were planned during Britains six months in the EU chair but greater energy would be put into implementing existing measures.

 Slur suicide bid

 Brogden

 Sydney, Aug. 31 (AP): A former senior political figure in Prime Minister John Howards liberal party reportedly attempted suicide a day after he quit his leadership post on Monday over a racial slur directed at the Malaysian-born wife of a former political rival.

 A colleague confirmed today that John Brogden was in hospital but said he was expected to be discharged soon.

 Brogden, leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales state, apologised on Monday for recently calling Helena Carr, wife of the states former leader Bob Carr, a mail-order bride. 

 The comments were made while drinking at a function during which Brogden also pinched a female journalist and made a sexual proposition to another.

 Brogden, seen as a rising star in the Liberal Party, announced his resignation as the partys state leader.

 Media reports said Brogden was found unconscious in his office late last night after a suicide attempt and was taken by ambulance to hospital.

 Police confirmed he had harmed himself but details of the attempt were not immediately available.

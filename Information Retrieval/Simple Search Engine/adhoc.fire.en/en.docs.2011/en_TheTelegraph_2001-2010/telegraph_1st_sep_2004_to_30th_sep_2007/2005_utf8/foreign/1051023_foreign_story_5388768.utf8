 Perestroika won: Gorby

 Washington, Oct. 22 (AP): Both the US and Russia emerged victorious with the end of the Cold War, says former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

 I would not be making a mistake to say that perestroika won. It succeeded, he said last night at the 20th anniversary of governmental reforms that ultimately ended the hostilities. America has a right to be a leader, Gorbachev said, adding that this leadership should be realised through partnership, not domination.

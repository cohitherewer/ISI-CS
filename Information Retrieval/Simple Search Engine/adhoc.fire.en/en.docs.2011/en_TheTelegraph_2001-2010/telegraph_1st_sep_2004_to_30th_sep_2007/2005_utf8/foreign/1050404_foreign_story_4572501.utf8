WORLD IN MOURNING

 Taliban message 

 Kabul, April 3 (Reuters): The Taliban leadership in Afghanistan sent a message from their hiding place today calling on Pope John Paul II?s successor to use his influence to stop persecution of Muslims. 

 The Pope?s death left leaders of the puritanical Islamist movement unmoved. ?We neither express grief nor joy over the death of the Pope. Some of what he said about peace and harmony was worth considering,? Taliban spokesperson Abdul Latif Hakimi said by satellite telephone. 

?We hope that his successor will try to lead his followers to the path of peace. Many of the Pope?s followers want peace, but there are many others who are still committing excesses against Muslims,? said Hakimi. 

 Gunman grieves 

 Istanbul (Reuters): Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca, who 

 gravely wounded Pope John Paul in a failed assassination 

 attempt in 1981, was grief-stricken over the Pontiff?s death, 

 Agca?s brother said on Sunday. Agca, now in an Istanbul 

 prison, was mourning the loss of ?a great friend?, the gunman?s 

 brother Adnan Agca said. ?He is extremely saddened, he is 

 in grief. He loved the Pope,? said Adnan Agca. The Pope 

 forgave his assailant during a meeting in his Italian prison 

 cell in 1983, two years after he shot the Pope in the abdomen 

 during a general audience in St. Peter?s Square. 

 China, Cuba mourn 

 Beijing (Reuters): China, which does not recognise the authority of the Vatican, offered its sympathies on the death of the Pope on Sunday and said it hoped his successor would act to improve relations. ?China expresses its condolences on the passing away of Pope John Paul II due to his illness,? foreign ministry Liu Jianchao said. In Cuba, church bells rang out every half hour on Saturday as authorities allowed Catholics to grieve the death of a man they praised for standing up to neoliberal capitalism. President Fidel Castro decreed three days of official mourning Aril 3-5. 

 Vatican interregnum 

Vatican City (Reuters): Time stops at the Vatican between 

the death of a Pope and the ascension to the throne of a successor. The period 

is known by a Latin word ? interregnum ? which means ?between the reigns? and 

reminds the world that the Vatican is one of the world?s last absolute monarchies. 

No one is permitted to take photographs of a dying Pope on his sickbed or to record 

his words on tape. This prohibition is included in regulations because of a 1958 

scandal when an Italian doctor secretly took photos of Pope Pius XII on his deathbed 

and sold them to the media.

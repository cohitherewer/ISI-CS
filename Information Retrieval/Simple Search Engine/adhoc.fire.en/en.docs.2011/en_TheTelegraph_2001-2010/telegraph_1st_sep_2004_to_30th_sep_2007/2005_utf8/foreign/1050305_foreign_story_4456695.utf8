 Pak rights group slams rape verdict

 Mukhtaran Mai

 Multan, March 4 (Reuters): Pakistan?s top human rights group said today that the acquittal of five men earlier sentenced to death for gangraping a woman showed the government?s lack of commitment to curb crimes against women.

 A high court in the central city of Multan yesterday struck down lower court convictions of the five for the gangrape of 30-year-old Mukhtaran Mai on the orders of a village council in July 2002. A sixth man?s death sentence was commuted to life in prison.

 The private Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it was disappointed, saying the victim was paying the price for the ?state?s failure? to ensure justice.

 ?The acquittal... highlights some of the factors behind the continuously soaring rate of crime against women,? the group said in a statement.

 ?The court?s observations ... about flaws in the police inquiry and insufficient evidence against the accused betray a lack of genuine willingness on the part of authorities to pursue cases of crimes against women, especially the rural poor.?

 The attack caused an outcry in Pakistan and focused international attention on the plight of women in the country?s feudal-dominated rural society. Mai broke down in tears after hearing the ruling and said she would appeal.

 Up to 70 rights activists demonstrated today in Multan. ?Mukhtaran Mai, we are with you,? read one placard.

 41 teen troops lost in Chile

 Los Angeles (Chile), May 21 (Reuters): At least 41 soldiers were feared dead today as rescuers searched a fourth day for mostly teenage troops lost in a blizzard during a military exercise in the Andes.

 Grieving families began to identify the 14 bodies that had been found and brought to an army base in the southern Chilean city of Los Angeles. Many bitterly blamed the army for the deaths on the Antuco volcano near the border with Argentina.

 Debris foxes shuttle chief

 - Astronauts: Craft must be repaired before space return

 Houston, July 29 (Reuters): Shuttle Discovery commander Eileen Collins said today she was surprised the flying debris problem that brought down Columbia in 2003 re-emerged on their flight and said shuttles should not return to space until it was fixed.

 She and astronaut Andy Thomas said in press interviews from space they were not worried about damage the debris may have caused Discovery, saying the orbiter looked very clean despite a few nicks to its protective tile.

 What Id like to say is this is something that has to be fixed, Collins said. I dont think we should fly again unless we do something to prevent this from happening again.

 Videos showed loose insulation foam from Discoverys external fuel tank appearing to strike the orbiter wing as it took off on Tuesday, but the US space agency said it believed the shuttle was in good condition. The astronauts were to use lasers and television cameras to inspect Discoverys wings and belly for damage for a second time in the mission.

 Loose foam from the fuel tank knocked a hole in the heat shield of Columbias wing when it launched on January 16, 2003, and 16 days later the shuttle disintegrated over Texas as it glided toward Florida for landing. All seven astronauts died. Nasa has worked for two-and-a-half years and spent $1 billion to stop the foam problem and make the shuttle safer.

 We were actually quite surprised to hear we had some large pieces of debris fall off the external tank. It wasnt what we had expected, Collins said. Frankly, we were disappointed to hear that had happened.

 Thomas added: We werent surprised from the point of view that we think theres a risk to our own entry. We were surprised that it had happened after so many good people worked to mitigate the problem.

 I think its a bit dramatic to say we dodged a bullet, he said. 

 Collins took heart in the fact that the loose foam came from a part of the fuel tank that had not been re-engineered, meaning, she said, that there was hope it could be fixed. But Thomas said it was important that Nasa try to understand why this particular area was not examined originally when the whole issue of foam debris came up.

 Nasa officials on Wednesday grounded the shuttle fleet until the foam problem was resolved. Shuttle Atlantis was scheduled to fly in September, but that mission appears in doubt now. Collins said that despite the debris problem, Discovery was performing well and that she was enjoying her fourth shuttle flight. Its magical up here, she said.

 Discovery was flying with the International Space Station 352 km above the earth after they linked up yesterday. It was the first shuttle visit to the $95 billion station since November 2002.

 On board Discovery was an Italian-built, barrel-shaped multi-purpose logistics module, more colourfully known as Raffaello, filled with 15 tons of supplies and equipment for the station and its two-man crew. Raffaello was removed by robot arm from the shuttle cargo bay and docked to the station today for unloading.

 Later, the astronauts will reload it with an estimated 13 tons of junk that have piled up on the station.

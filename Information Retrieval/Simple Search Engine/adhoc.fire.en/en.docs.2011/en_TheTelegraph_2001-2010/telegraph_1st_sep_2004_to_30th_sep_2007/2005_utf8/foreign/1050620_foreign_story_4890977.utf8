 Fathers art moves De Niro

 Robert De Niro 

 Roubaix (France), June 19 (AFP): The sight of his fathers paintings in an exhibition in this northern French industrial city brought tears to the eyes of actor Robert De Niro.

 I am honoured that hes been treated so respectfully here, De Niro said yesterday after visiting the exhibition containing about 60 works, including still lifes, landscapes and portraits, by Robert De Niro Sr. 

 The retrospective exhibition of paintings by De Niro, who died in 1993, will last until the end of August at the Museum of Art and Industry in Roubaix.

 I just love his work, because of its sensuality, its colours, De Niro said. 

 He was very elegant about his choices, his tastes. He was very sophisticated in what he liked as an artist and what he didnt like.

 The actor said he had seen paintings by his father that he had not seen for years and some that I dont remember ever having seen.

 The museum conservator said De Niro Sr was an American artist much influenced by French masters.

 Putin in Israel, proposes peace meet 

 Tel Aviv, April 27 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived today on the first visit to Israel by a Kremlin leader, after proposing a peace summit in Moscow to try to resolve decades of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

 Putin?s proposal won immediate backing from Palestinians but Israel was wary, saying it would oppose any effort to circumvent the US-backed ?road map? peace plan.

 Putin, speaking in Egypt alongside President Hosni Mubarak, gave few details of the proposal for the autumn summit but said Russia would start contacts to discuss the agenda. He said West Asia peace should be based on UN resolutions and the road map.

 ?I intend to discuss this idea with my other colleagues who are interested in moving the peace process forward in West Asia,? he said. He would talk about it with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, he added.

 Palestinians said the summit would help prepare for final peace negotiations following a ceasefire agreement and a planned Israeli withdrawal this summer from Gaza and part of the West Bank. ?We will commit and we hope it will take place,? said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose election in January to replace the late Yasser Arafat raised hopes for peacemaking.

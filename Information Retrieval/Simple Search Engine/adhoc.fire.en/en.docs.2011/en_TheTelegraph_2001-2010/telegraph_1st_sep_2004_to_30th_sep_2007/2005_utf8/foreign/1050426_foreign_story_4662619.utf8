 Oil prices spark Bush concern

 Crawford (Texas), April 25 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said today he was concerned about near-record oil and fuel prices and pressed Crown Prince Abdullah on how much Saudi Arabia could increase production.

 ?The crown prince understands that it is very important ... (to) make sure that the price is reasonable. A high oil price will damage markets, and he knows that,? Bush said before welcoming Abdullah at his Texas ranch.

 ?I look forward to talking to him about that,? Bush said. ?We?ll talk about his country?s capacity. It?s an important subject.? Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

 ?This is an important relationship,? Bush said. He greeted the prince with a kiss on both cheeks and then held his hand to help him up the stone steps leading to the office on the ranch. The White House is facing growing consumer unease over oil prices that have marched steadily higher.

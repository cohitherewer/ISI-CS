 Fine Print

 Gigolo grouse

 Beijing , July 1: Students at a Chinese university are protesting against new rules banning them from using prostitutes and gigolos or indulging in one-night stands, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 Alarmed at the loosening of Chinas puritan morality, Chongqing Normal University pinned the guidelines in all classrooms last month. The discovery of escort girls, mistresses, gigolos, or anyone caught having a one-night love affair will result in expulsion, it said.

 Rat ruckus

 Paris: A French mayors impromptu 

 rodent control could land him in court after he battered 

 a rat to death with a shovel, reports The Daily Telegraph. 

 Jacques Peyrat, the outspoken mayor of Nice, caused added 

 offence by congratulating himself on his work in the local 

 paper. He spotted the rat during an official visit to a 

 rubbish collection point in the citys old quarter 

 close to the seafront. He told Nice Matin that he 

 grabbed a shovel and used it to smash the rat. 

 I cannot stand those animals, he explained. 

 The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals lodged 

 a criminal complaint with the prosecutors. If it leads to 

 a court case, Peyrat could be fined up to ?2,100.

 Stick smart

 Nicosia, Cyprus (Reuters): A teenage delivery boy caught a fleeing bank robber in Cyprus on Friday, using a broomstick to subdue him and pin him to the ground, police said. Using a fake pistol, the robber had stolen ?2,000 from a Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia. He was running out of the bank when he was spotted by the 19-year-old, who worked for a courier firm. The courier intercepted the thief with his car. There was a bit of a struggle and the teenager attacked the robber and pinned him down with a broomstick, the police said.

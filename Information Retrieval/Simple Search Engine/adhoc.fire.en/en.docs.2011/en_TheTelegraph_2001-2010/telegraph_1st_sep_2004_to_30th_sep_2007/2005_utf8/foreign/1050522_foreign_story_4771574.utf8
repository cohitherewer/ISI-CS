 US teacher weds boy she raped

 Seattle, May 21 (AP): Security leading up to the wedding of Mary Kay Letourneau and her former sixth-grade student rivalled that of a top-secret government operation ? from secret instructions to a hush-hush rendezvous and identity checks.

 Letourneau, 43, and Vili Fualaau, 22, have been in the spotlight since she was imprisoned in 1997 for raping Fualaau. But when she was released last August, the couple ? who have two daughters together ? reunited.

 Since then, details of their wedding last night have been closely guarded ? except for a series of interviews by Entertainment Tonight and its sister TV show, The Insider. The shows have exclusive rights to the nuptials. Show officials said they did not pay for the wedding.

 Janet Annino, ETs co-executive producer in Washington for the wedding, said everyone had gathered by 9.30 pm (local time) but the ceremony had not yet begun. Theyre running a little late, she said. The wedding was held at the Columbia winery in Woodinville, northeast of Seattle, Annino said.

 Letourneaus teenage daughter, Mary Claire, from her earlier marriage, was on hand to serve as her maid of honour, Annino said. The couples two daughters, Audrey, 8, and Alexis Georgia, 7, were flower girls.

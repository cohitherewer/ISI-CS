 Garner lets out a secret

 New York, Sept. 29 (AP): Are Ben and Jen expecting a girl? 

 Jennifer Garner appeared on NBCs Tonight Show on Tuesday night, and seemed to refer to her baby as a she.

 You can just start to feel really pregnant. Like you are the hugest person on the face of the planet... And then I felt just bigger and bigger like she ... Oops. Garner put both hands over her mouth.

 We have one or the other for sure, replied Garner, who is married to Ben Affleck. The 33-year-old actor stars as Sydney Bristow on ABCs Alias. 

 Garners pregnancy was written into the show, even though her character is a globe-trotting spy.

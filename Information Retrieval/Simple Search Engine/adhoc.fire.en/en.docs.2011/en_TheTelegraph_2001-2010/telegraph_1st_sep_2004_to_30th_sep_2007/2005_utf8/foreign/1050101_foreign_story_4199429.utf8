 Celebration amp; collision air in Ukraine

 Kiev, Dec. 31 (Reuters): Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich today pursued a dogged legal challenge to the results of a presidential vote, while supporters of the liberal Opposition prepared a New Year?s party to celebrate their win. 

 The results showed West-leaning politician Viktor Yushchenko won an eight-point lead over Yanukovich at the polls, which followed massive protests and a successful campaign to have an earlier election declared fraudulent. But the Moscow-backed Yanukovich has vowed he will not recognise the result and refused to step down as Prime Minister.

 He has looked increasingly isolated without a power base or any signs of backing from voters in his stronghold in eastern Ukraine to keep fighting to overturn the election outcome.

 The Supreme Court rejected efforts to have the vote annulled on procedural grounds. The Central Election Commission, which has rejected several of his submissions, examined new arguments.

 In Independence Square, focus of weeks of protests in the ?orange revolution? backing Yushchenko, at least 100,000 were expected for festivities as Ukrainians appeared eager to put weeks of turmoil behind them.

 ?We are planning to come to the square,? said Natasha, 29, a sales manager in a Western company. 

 ?It will be good fun and this year is special for Ukraine. We ought to be there.? Celebrations were to culminate with an appearance by Yushchenko, along with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili.

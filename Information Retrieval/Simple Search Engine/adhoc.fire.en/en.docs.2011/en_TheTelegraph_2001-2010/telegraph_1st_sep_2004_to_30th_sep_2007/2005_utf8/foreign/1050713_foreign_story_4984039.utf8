 Vatican call to help prostitutes

 Vatican City, July 12 (AP): The Vatican has called for laws to punish clients of prostitutes and protect women from what it called a modern form of slavery.

 The Vaticans office for migrants and itinerants issued the recommendations in a final communique that stemmed from a two-day symposium on prostitution and human trafficking it hosted in june.

 In the document released yesterday, the Vatican called for the clients of prostitutes to be punished, since they fuel the industry.

 It added though that people who solicit prostitutes also need help to resolve the profound problems that compel them to pay for sex.

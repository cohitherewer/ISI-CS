 W. Asia crisis

 Jerusalem, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon today said he was giving Israel?s army free rein to battle militants in Gaza and accused the new Palestinian leadership he now shuns of doing nothing to stop attacks on Israelis.

 Palestinian officials said Mahmoud Abbas, sworn in as President yesterday, would try again this week to win over fighters defying his calls for an end to a four-year-old armed uprising so as to allow talks.

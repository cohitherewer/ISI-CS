 Flicker of life in New Orleans

 New Orleans, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Signs of life flickered in New Orleans French Quarter and central business district for the first time since Hurricane Katrina, as merchants today returned to abandoned shops and restaurants that on normal weekends would be teeming with people.

 But in neighbourhoods hardest hit by the killer storm, rescue workers said they were beginning to find more bodies.

 Local officials allowed business owners back into parts of the wrecked city as they sought to restore commerce and put the the Big Easy on the road to recovery.

 One well-known French Quarter eatery, Alex Patouts Louisiana Kitchen, placed a table covered with a white tablecloth out front and vowed to start serving the states signature dish ? red beans and rice ? by the end of the day. Just wait til we get the Mardi Gras music going, said restaurant worker Annie Lewis.

 Flood waters that still cover 40 per cent of the historic city were dropping quickly as pumps shot water back into Lake Pontchartrain, allowing search and rescue teams their first look into many homes that had been submerged for nearly three weeks.

 The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported the teams were turning up large numbers of bodies in districts such as the 9th Ward, Gentilly and the Desire-Florida that quickly filled with up to 3.5 meters of water after Katrina broke a nearby levee. As of yesterday, Katrinas death toll stood at 816, with 579 of those in Louisiana, 218 in Mississippi and a total of 19 in Florida, Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee.

 While the chore of collecting the dead went on, local officials encouraged the restoration of commerce in neighborhoods that fared better in the storm and where electricity was slowly being restored.

 In the central business district, Tony and Sharon Schembre were surprised to find their familys 88-year-old brass polishing and plating shop in good shape. They vowed to reopen soon.

 Were coming back. I figured if there was too much damage we would not, but well definitely be back, Tony Schembre said.

 Mayor Ray Nagin called on businesses to come back this weekend and wants residents of the least-affected areas to join a staggered return over the next nine days.

 But it was uncertain how many of the citys 450,000 residents could or would actually return.

 Schools, some hospitals and almost all businesses remain closed and many will not be open again for months. The water is not safe to drink and, with huge swaths of the city devastated, it could take years for a full recovery.

 The storm forced a million people from their homes, hundreds of thousands of whom are now in refugee shelters or temporary housing across the nation.

 BLANCO THANKS AMERICA

 The biggest concentration was in Houston, where 27,000 evacuees once filled the Astrodome complex. On Friday, the last of those in the famed sports stadium had been moved to other locations.

 In Saturdays Democratic national radio address, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco thanked America for taking in the displaced.

 As long as the Mississippi River flows into the gulf, we will never forget your generosity, she said.

 Accept our thanks and hear our resolve: we will bring our people home as soon as we can. We need and we want our people back, Blanco added.

 President George W. Bush, stung by criticism that his government reacted too slowly to the disaster, has vowed to rebuild New Orleans and all the other Gulf Coast cities and towns ravaged by the Aug. 29 hurricane.

 That could cost more than $200 billion, which has prompted concerns about increasing an already large budget deficit.

 The military presence in New Orleans ? already at high levels following the lawlessness and chaos in the days after the storm ? increased further as National Guard troops added new roadblocks on city streets, limiting the movement of the few residents who had remained.

 Two buses carrying members of the Oregon National Guard patrolled near the receding flood waters in the northern part of New Orleans, looking for any residents or looters that may have made their way into the city.

 Despite the muck and stench across much of New Orleans, federal officials said the risk of disease to returning residents was not significant.

 So far there are no big issues long-term, said Jerry Fenner, a public health analyst with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

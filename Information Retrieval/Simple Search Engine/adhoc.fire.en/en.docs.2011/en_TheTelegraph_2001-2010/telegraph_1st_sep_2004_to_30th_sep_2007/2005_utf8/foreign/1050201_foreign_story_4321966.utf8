 Curbs on school smokers

 TOM PETERKIN

 London, Jan. 31: Children as young as 14 will be offered free nicotine patches in a drive to reduce under-age smoking, it was disclosed yesterday.

 Smokers in schools and youth groups will be put on courses of nicotine patches , gum or tablets in an effort to reduce cancer rates.

 The ?180,000 lottery-funded pilot scheme is to be launched in Lanarkshire, where almost half of deaths from cancer are linked to smoking. Children will be trained to counsel each other to stop smoking and can then refer classmates to adult anti-smoking co-ordinators who will decide on the most appropriate form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).

 Tom Bryce, the general manager of Airdrie Local Health Care Co-operative, said: ?The areas we are focusing on are particularly deprived and so there are high numbers of young people who smoke.

 ?Nicotine Replacement Therapy will be prescribed, but at the heart of the project will be other teenagers helping the youngsters through their addiction.? A survey showed last year that 24 per cent of 15-year-old girls in Scotland and 14 per cent of 15-year-old boys are smokers. 

 Some specialists were concerned that NRT, which can usually be given to under-18s only on prescription, could have an adverse effect.

 Prof. Ian Stolerman, a nicotine expert from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College, London, said: ?NRT poses a much greater risk for children than for adults. Children are much more susceptible to becoming dependent upon nicotine.?

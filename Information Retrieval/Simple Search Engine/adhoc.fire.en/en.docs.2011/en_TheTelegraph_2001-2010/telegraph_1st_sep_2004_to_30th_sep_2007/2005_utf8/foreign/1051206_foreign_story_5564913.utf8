 Quake rocks east Africa

 Nairobi, Dec. 5 (Reuters): A strong earthquake jolted Africas Great Lakes region today, killing at least one person in Congos remote east and rattling regional capitals.

 The US Geological Survey reported that a 6.8 magnitude quake struck near the town of Kalemie in the Democratic Republic of Congo at 1219 GMT, some 975 km southwest of the Kenyan capital Nairobi.

 Besides Kenya and Congo, tremors were felt in Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania, impoverished countries connected by a string of lakes and mountains, many of them active volcanoes.

 Residents of Kalemie, an eastern Congolese town on the shores of Lake Tanganyika with a population of 200,000 people, reported at least one death and several injuries and said houses had collapsed in poor neighbourhoods. 

 A child died when the house he was in collapsed during the earthquake. Several other people have broken limbs and are in hospital. Well see in the hours that come if more come to hospitals, Kalemie community leader Fidel Muteba said.

 It was the first fatal seismic event in the region since 2002 when Africas deadliest eruption in 25 years swept away thousands of homes and killed 25 people after the 3,469-metre Mount Nyiragongo exploded near the eastern Congo town of Goma.

 Hundreds of people evacuated office buildings in the centre of Nairobi today after the tremors. People came running down ? scared ? because you dont know what it is. Youre moving this way and that, said Tabitha Nyambati, demonstrating how the tremor made her sway.

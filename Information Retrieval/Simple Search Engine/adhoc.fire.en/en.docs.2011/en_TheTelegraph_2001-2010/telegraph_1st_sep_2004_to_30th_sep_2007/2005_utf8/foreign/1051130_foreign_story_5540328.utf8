 Ricky to fight human trade

 Geneva, Nov. 29 (AP): Pop star Ricky Martin is teaming up with a UN-affiliated migration organisation to fight the illegal trafficking of people in Colombia.

 Martin, from Puerto Rico, will support a campaign in Colombia against human trafficking by appearing in television commercials and through his non-profit charity, the Geneva-based International Organisation for Migration said today.

 More than half of trafficking victims worldwide are children, Martin said. The commercials will be aired starting next year and will focus on the dangers trafficking poses to Colombian children.

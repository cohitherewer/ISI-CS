 Europe stops to remember

 London, July 14 (Reuters): Office workers streamed on to the streets and traffic ground to a halt as London paused in silent tribute today, a week to the day since at least 53 people were killed in suicide bomb attacks.

 The chimes of Big Ben boomed at midday across the city to mark the start of a two-minute silence that was observed across the country and elsewhere in Europe. Black cabs and double-decker buses pulled over as an eerie silence descended on the capital.

 In Paris, President Jacques Chiracs annual Bastille day television address was put back to mark the moment. In Madrid government officials stopped work, Berlins buses, trams and underground trains halted and in Italy, television stations cut into normal broadcasting. 

 At the four sites where suspected Islamic militants struck underground trains and a bus, Londoners bowed their heads in grief on a swelteringly hot day. Some wiped away tears.

 I just lost one of my best mates ? but two minutes aint going to bring him back, said Declan Hora, 22, contemplating the death of his childhood friend Ciaran Cassidy at Kings Cross station.

 Michael Harvey, a 20-year-old New Zealander who survived the bus blast, nursed a broken arm in a plaster cast and said: I came just to show support and pay tribute to people who lost their lives. Its good that everyone came together.

 Landings and take-offs were briefly suspended at Heathrow airport and financial markets paused to remember the dead. Queen Elizabeth stood in silence at Buckingham Palace, while Prime Minister Tony Blair observed the tribute at his Downing Street residence.

 In Trafalgar Square, a giant banner declared: One City, One World. During the silence, all that could be heard was the sound of running water in the fountains. 

 When it finished, everyone applauded. Play was halted in the opening round of the British Open golf at St Andrews in Scotland as a klaxon sounded across the course. 

 In Baghdad, Iraqi policemen huddled in a choking sandstorm at a checkpoint, bemused by the commemoration. Fifty innocent people died in London; it was a terrorist act of the kind we here know all too well, said 25-year-old policeman Ali Qasim as he trained his rifle over a concrete block.

 But one thing makes me wonder ? 50 people died in London and the world is astonished! What about us? Only yesterday 25 children were killed in Iraq by a suicide bomber. Are Iraqis worth less than other human beings? 

 In Spain, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero joined the two minutes of silence during a visit to Valencia.

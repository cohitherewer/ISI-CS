 London, April 10: The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have attended a church service in Scotland in their first public engagement since becoming husband and wife.

 Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, arrived with his new wife at Crathie Parish Church in Aberdeenshire in a metallic grey Audi for the 11 am service.

 The happy couple were greeted with a round of applause by the hundred or so onlookers who had braved the cold winds to greet them.

 Camilla, wearing a matching fuchsia hat and coat, entered the church alongside the Prince who was wearing traditional highland dress.

 At the beginning of the service, session clerk Ed Bushnell extended a warm welcome to the Prince and the Duchess.

 ?May I, on behalf of the congregation of Braemar and Crathie wish you a long and happy future together,? he said.

 This was followed by clapping from the congregation. 

 Lay reader Captain Robbie Middleton then asked for a special blessing for the couple.

 ?We give special thanks for our Queen and royal family and for our leaders in Britain as we move towards the election of a new government,? he said.

 ?We ask for a special blessing for Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, that their life be fulfilled in all that they do together in the coming years.?

 During the service, prayers were also said for Pope John Paul II.

 At the end of the service, the couple emerged from the side door and were met with cheers and claps from the crowd, many of whom were waving flags.

 Before heading back to the Balmoral estate, Prince Charles and Camilla shook hands with a number of people in the crowd and thanked them for braving the cold and coming out to visit them.

 Shootout in Iraq prison

 Baghdad, Dec. 28 (Reuters): At least nine prisoners and guards were killed in a gunbattle at an Iraqi high-security jail today after detained guerrilla suspects, some of them foreign, grabbed weapons and tried to flee, officials said.

 One inmate snatched a Kalashnikov rifle from a guard as a handful of high-risk prisoners were taken out at dawn to clean the yard, a guard from the Baghdad prison said. After raiding the prison armoury, the group freed more comrades but US and Iraqi troops based around the jail quelled the revolt.

 Five staff and four inmates were killed and five prisoners and a US soldier were wounded, the US military said, denying assertions by police, including an interior ministry general, that the death toll was at least 20 among the detainees, who include some of the most violent of Iraqs insurgents.

 A Russian, a Tunisian and a Saudi were involved, he said.

 In other violence, rebels ambushed an Iraqi army patrol near Dujail, 60 km north of Baghdad, late yesterday, killing two soldiers and wounding seven, police said.

 Serious attacks have increased in the past week following a lull around the December 15 election, when some rebels from the once dominant Sunni Arab minority observed an informal truce to encourage their community to vote for the first time and stake a share in the new Parliament.

 Some Sunni politicians have warned that anger at results they say are forged and which confirmed the dominant position of Shia Islamists could prompt more attacks, not just by the al Qaida-linked Islamists bent on wrecking the US-backed political process but also by Sunni groups that backed the vote.

 The electoral commission, assailed by protests over the past week, produced a UN official at its daily news conference today to insist the ballot was fair.

 Commission chief Hussein Hindawi said a few ballot boxes out of more than 30,000 might be ruled invalid but that this would not affect the overall result.

 At the time when many political 

 groups are preparing to end the political crisis through 

 flexibility and patience and insight... the party condemns 

 these acts and calls on all sides to be patient and to act 

 responsibly, said Iraqi Islamic Party, the driving 

 force behind the main Sunni electoral bloc, the Iraqi Accordance 

 Front.

 Islamabad, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Pakistans Prime Minister today ordered an inquiry into a womans claim that she was kidnapped and raped by police after causing a security scare in parliament earlier this year.

 Twenty-three-year-old Sonia Naz was jailed in April after wandering into the National Assembly while seeking help to secure the release of her husband from police custody.

 She was freed from jail in May but newspapers at the time reported that she had gone missing after her release.

 Todays edition of The News newspaper quoted Naz as saying that she was kidnapped at gunpoint after her release and kept in police custody for 15 days. 

 She said she was raped by a police officer on the orders of Khalid Abdullah, a superintendent of police in her home town of Faisalabad. Abdullah denied the charges in an interview with private Geo Television and accused Naz of concocting the allegation to cover up the wrongdoing of her husband, Asim Yusuf.

 He said Yusuf was not in police custody, but on the run from charges of forging documents for stolen cars. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said he had ordered an inquiry into Nazs allegations after Opposition deputies raised the issue in the National Assembly.

 I have seen this report. I have ordered an inquiry. Strict action will be taken against all those found involved in this incident, he told parliament.

 Naz told The News she had strong evidence to proof her case. I will give all evidence before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, if asked. But now I and my kids live in mortal danger after my decision to break the silence, she said.

 After I was raped and driven out of my missing husbands house, I wanted to kill myself. But the cries of my two small kids stopped me as they have already lost their father, she was quoted as saying.

 Rape is not uncommon in Pakistan but most go unreported. But such cases have started receiving prominent coverage in the local media since a notorious gangrape generated massive publicity at home and abroad. Mukhtaran Mai, now an icon for human rights in Pakistan, was gangraped three years ago on the orders of a village council.

 Old is gold in Europe

 Catherine Deneuve

 Berlin, Feb. 13 (Reuters): French film siren Catherine Deneuve believes her career would have ended long ago had she tried to work in Hollywood, where youth and looks count for almost everything.

 In Berlin to promote her latest film Les Temps Qui Changent (Changing Times), Deneuve, 61, said American cinema was merely a reflection of that society.

 ?It?s true that in America you had better die young, because you are not supposed to grow older,? she said when asked if she shared the frustration of Hollywood actresses who find work harder to get as they age.

 ?It?s not only in the cinema, its a reflection of the society,? she added on the sidelines of the annual Berlin Film Festival, where her film is competing for the main prize.

 ?It?s true that it?s much more difficult for a woman, and therefore an actress, to work after 40 or 45. In Europe it?s very different.?

 Deneuve burst on to the film scene more than 40 years ago with Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, and cemented her place as a global object of desire and respect when she played a sexually adventurous housewife in Belle de Jour three years later.

 In her latest film she plays Cecile, a woman whose honest realism contrasts with the idealism of Antoine, acted by Gerard Depardieu, who waits years for a chance to reunite with his one true love.

 ?In the character of the film, Gerard Depardieu is really loving like a woman, I think. He?s certain of this kind of love, (that) the person he wants to live with is the love of his life,? said Deneuve.

 For Deneuve, women generally work harder on relationships, but there is no such thing as eternal love.

 ?Woman are more determined to make things work whatever,? Deneuve said. ?I think men, they would like (love), but I don?t think they really work hard at it. It?s not the main thing in their life. ?It?s not meant to live forever, and that?s the exciting thing.?

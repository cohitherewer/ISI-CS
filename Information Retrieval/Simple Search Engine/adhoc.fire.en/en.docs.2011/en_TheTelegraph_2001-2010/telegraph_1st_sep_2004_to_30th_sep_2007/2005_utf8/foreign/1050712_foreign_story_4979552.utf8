 Taliban shadow looms over radical Pak state

 Islamabad, July 11 (Reuters): Islamists ruling a Pakistani province plan an accountability department to promote Islamic practices but opponents say the proposal conjures up the spectre of the Talibans religious police.

 Almost all of Pakistans 150 million people are Muslim and a tug-of-war over societys direction pits conservatives against liberals. The proposed department in the conservative North West Frontier Province is shaping up as the latest battle front. 

 We will persuade people to follow Islamic practices, provincial law minister Malik Zafar Azam said today.

 Azams Islamist government introduced a bill in the provincial assembly today to set up a Hasba (accountability) department to be headed by an Islamic cleric.

 Liberal and secular critics say the proposed body is modelled on the Talibans department of prevention of vice and promotion of virtue in Afghanistan, which ran the religious police, before the groups 2001 ouster.

 The religious police roamed Afghan streets, forcing people to pray, ensuring women did not leave home without a head-to-toe burkha and confronting men who did not have long beards. Dismissing critics concern about the Talibanisation of the western province bordering Afghanistan, Azam said no one would be forcing people to adopt Islamic practices.

 You dont slap anyone when you are using the means of persuasion, he said.

 North West Frontier came under the control of the Muttahida Majils-e-Amal alliance of religious parties in the 2002 elections.

 The provincial government has taken several steps reminiscent of Taliban rule including a ban on music on public transport, stopping male doctors examining women, men coaching women athletes and male journalists covering womens sports.

 According to a draft of the bill obtained by Reuters, the accountability department will station officials in every district to promote religious observance.

 The department will settle disputes, such as clan feuds in tribal communities, according to the draft. It will also try to end the killing of women in the name of family honour, curb corruption and discourage excessive dowry payments, extravagant weddings and child labour.

 But the bill also sets out powers for religious police under the department to ensure observance of Islamic practices while curbing palm-reading and other customs deemed un-Islamic. Human rights groups say that will promote intolerance.

 This is yet again another move to Talibanise Pakistan, said Iqbal Haider, head of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Giving powers to the government to prescribe what is right and what is wrong, according to its interpretation of Islam, is a dangerous phenomenon., he said.

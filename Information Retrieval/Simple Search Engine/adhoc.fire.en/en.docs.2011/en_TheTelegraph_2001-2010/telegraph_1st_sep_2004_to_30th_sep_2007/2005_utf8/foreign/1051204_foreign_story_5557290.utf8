 No smoking, even at home

 Berlin, Dec. 3: A German company has sacked one of its employees for smoking at home after hiring a detective to catch him in the act.

 Sandro Beier was dismissed from his ?19,000-a-year job with a Berlin printing company after being photographed smoking in his back garden.

 The company, Laserline, which runs a rigorous health and fitness programme for its 100 staff, said Beier, 42, had defrauded it by lying about his smoking habits.

 It claimed that Beier had signed an agreement, renewable every month, in which he stated that he did not smoke. In return he received a monthly bonus of ?68.

 Tip-offs from his fellow workers led us to believe Beier was not sticking to the rules, so we sent a detective to follow him to find out the truth, said Babett Deuse, an operations and risk management supervisor at Laserline.

 The rules were he was to tell us if he smoked. He defrauded us of some 1,200 euros [?800] a year which is enough money for a family holiday. If someone steals from their company, it is normal that they are punished. The company introduced its radical no-smoking policy five years ago and abolished smoking areas last year. Two thirds of its staff are in the programme. 

 Laserline said its no-smoking incentives made economic sense, claiming that every full-time worker who smoked was losing an average of 12 work days a year in cigarette breaks. 

 Beiers lawyer, Manfred Terhedebr?gge, said his client was knocked back after six years service. He said he suspected that the company had used the smoking rules in order to find a way around Germanys extremely stringent employment dismissal laws.

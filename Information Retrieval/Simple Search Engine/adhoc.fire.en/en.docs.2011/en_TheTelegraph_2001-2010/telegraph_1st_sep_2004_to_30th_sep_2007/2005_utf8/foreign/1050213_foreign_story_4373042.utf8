 New York, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Pop diva, actor and budding fashion designer Jennifer Lopez made her New York runway debut yesterday with an eclectic collection that showed she may be able to bring her star power to the world of haute couture.

 The show, which was nothing short of theatrical, featured models in denim shorts and pants, cashmere sweaters, flowered babydoll tops, satin, crystals and lots and lots of fur.

 Supermodel Naomi Campbell strutted down the catwalk in halter-topped jumpsuit with tiered ruffles running down the legs and an enormously wide-brimmed mushroom-like white hat.

 ?I was very pleasantly surprised,? Jane Larkworthy, an editor at W magazine, said of Lopez?s new ?Sweetface? line. ?I love satin pants and I love fur.? The show was divided into three parts meant to correspond to phases of Lopez?s life: her start in the Bronx, her music career and her current red-carpet lifestyle.

 In the background, yellow neon lights spelled out ?JLo Story? during the first phase, then turned into two red turntables for the second, and then into a stretch limo and a velvet rope for the third. During the finale, music from her upcoming album, Rebirth, boomed in the background.

 The hotly anticipated and celebrity-studded event capped off New York?s twice-yearly Fashion Week extravaganza.

 The early pieces in the collection, which included casual items like jeans, belly-baring tops, striped scarves and zippered sweatshirts, did not seem to go over so well.

 ?As I saw those items, all I saw was a J.C. Penney rack,? said Zandile Blay, an editor at Seventeen magazine. Later in the show, Lopez offered more glamourous looks including crystal-studded skullcaps, a silk chiffon jumpsuit and a hooded floor-length fur cape in white. ?It?s a step up from her teenage, pop line. It?s definitely more mature, and it?s more of a replica of what Jennifer does,? said Metanoya Webb, an assistant editor at InStyle magazine. ?It was a reflection of her, and I liked that.?

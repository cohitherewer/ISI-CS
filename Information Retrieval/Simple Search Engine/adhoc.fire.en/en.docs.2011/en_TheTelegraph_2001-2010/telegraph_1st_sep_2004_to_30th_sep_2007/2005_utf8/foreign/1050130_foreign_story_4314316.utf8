 China flights in Taiwan

 Taipei/Beijing, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Taiwan and China launched historic charter flights today with commercial jets flying non-stop between the foes for the first time in more than 55 years, raising hopes for permanent air links and better ties.

 Starting with China Southern Airlines, six planes from the mainland touched down one after another at Taipei?s international airport, becoming the first Chinese planes to land on Taiwan soil since 1949, excluding hijacked aircraft.

 Taipei had banned direct flights on security grounds and still insists the special charters fly through Hong Kong or Macau air space. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and threatens to invade if the democratic island declares formal independence. ?I have never flown home so quickly,? said Jerry Chen who, with his wife and four-year-old son, was one of the 241 passengers on the first 80-minute China Southern flight from Guangzhou. 

 Hundreds of mourners braved police checks today to attend a low-key invitation-only funeral for Zhao Ziyang, the Chinese Communist Party chief purged for opposing the army crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen protests.

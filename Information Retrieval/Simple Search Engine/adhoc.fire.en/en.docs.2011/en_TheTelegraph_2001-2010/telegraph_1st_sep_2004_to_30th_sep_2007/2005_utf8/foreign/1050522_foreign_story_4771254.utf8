 Abuse report irks Karzai

 - Government wants custody of all Afghan prisoners

 Karzai

 Kabul, May 21 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai said today he was shocked by a US army report on abuse of detainees in Afghanistan, saying his government wanted custody of all Afghan prisoners and control over US military operations.

 The abuse described in the report, including details of the deaths of two inmates at an Afghan detention centre, happened in 2002 and emerged from a nearly 2,000-page file of US army investigators, the New York Times reported yesterday.

 It has shocked me thoroughly and we condemn it, Karzai said. We want the US government to take very, very strong action, to take away people like that.

 Karzai, a staunch ally in the US-led war against terrorism, is due to leave on a US trip later. He will meet President George W. Bush for talks next week.

 Karzai wants to forge a broad long-term partnership with his most important ally but he said he would also reiterate a request for the return of Afghan prisoners and control over US military operations.

 The US commands a foreign force in Afghanistan of about 18,300, most of them American, fighting Taliban insurgents and hunting militant leaders, including Osama bin Laden.

 Many Afghans have criticised US troops for what are seen as heavy-handed tactics, such as breaking into peoples homes in the middle of the night in their search for militants.

 Growing resentment of US forces was partly behind violent anti-American protests last week, analysts said.

 The protests were sparked by a report that said US army interrogators had desecrated the Quran. Sixteen people were killed and many wounded in violence in several Afghan cities.

 That report by Newsweek was later retracted, but the International Committee of the Red Cross subsequently said it had told the Pentagon of allegations US personnel had mishandled the Quran.

 Karzai said searches should be carried out in cooperation with Afghan forces. No operations inside Afghanistan should take place without the consultation of the Afghan government, he said.

 They should not go to our peoples homes any more without the knowledge of the Afghan government ... If they want any person suspected in a house, they should let us know and the Afghan government would arrange that.

 Karzai said he would also ask for the return of prisoners to Afghanistan, all of them.

 Darwin passes US test

 - Court vetoes alternative to evolution theory

 HARRY MOUNT 

 Washington, Dec. 21: In the biggest courtroom clash on evolution for 80 years, a Pennsylvania judge yesterday ruled that schools cannot mention divine intervention in biology classes as an alternative to Darwinian evolution. 

 The judges decision to ban any reference to so-called intelligent design, which maintains that life on Earth was produced by an unidentified intelligent cause, is another blow to Christian hardliners in America. 

 Last month, eight members of the school board who introduced the intelligent design policy into schools in Dover, Pennsylvania, last year, were voted out and replaced by Darwin supporters. 

 Federal judge John E. Jones III, appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, said the school board members had violated the Constitution when they ordered that the biology curriculum must include the notion of intelligent design. The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the board, the judge said. We find that the secular purposes claimed by the board amount to a pretext for its real purpose, which was to promote religion in the public school classroom. 

 The old policy required students to listen to a statement about intelligent design before biology lessons on evolution. It said Charles Darwins theory was not a fact and referred students to an intelligent design textbook, Of Pandas and People. Because Darwins theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The theory is not a fact. Gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence, they were told. 

 Intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwins view. The reference book is available in the library for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what intelligent design involves. The boards members were seeking to improve science education by exposing students to alternatives to Darwins theory that evolution develops through natural selection.

 More raids on Shias in Baghdad

 Baghdad, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Insurgents killed at least 23 people and wounded around 90 in a series of suicide attacks and bombings in Shia districts of Baghdad today, the holiest day of the Shia religious calendar.

 Iraq?s security forces had been braced for attacks in the southern holy city of Karbala, where more than 170 pilgrims were killed during the Shia ritual of Ashura last year. 

 But guerrillas targeted the capital, which has borne the brunt of violence since last month?s elections.

 In the worst attack, a man wearing a vest laden with explosives boarded a bus in the Khadamiya district and blew himself up, according to witnesses and the US military.

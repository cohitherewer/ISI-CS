 Islamabad, May 10 (Reuters): Pakistan, a key Muslim ally in the US-led war on terror, has voiced deep concern to Washington over a magazine report that US interrogators in Guantanamo Bay desecrated the Quran.

 Newsweek magazine, in its latest edition, quoted sources as saying that investigators probing abuses at the military prison had found that interrogators ?had placed Qurans on toilets, and in at least one case flushed a holy book down the toilet?.

 The foreign ministry said in a statement that Pakistan conveyed its deep concern to Washington over the reported desecration of the Muslim holy book.

 ?US officials have stated that the alleged perpetrators of the reported desecration would be held accountable after the matter had been appropriately investigated and responsibility is established,? the statement said.

 There has been growing public outrage in Pakistan over the report.

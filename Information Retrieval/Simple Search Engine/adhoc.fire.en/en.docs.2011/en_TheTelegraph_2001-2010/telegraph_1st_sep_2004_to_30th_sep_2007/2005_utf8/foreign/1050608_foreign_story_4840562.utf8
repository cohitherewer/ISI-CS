 Fans hearts, stars for Jackson

 Santa Maria (California), June 7 (Reuters): They have hung banners, carried signs and decorated the entrance to Neverland Valley Ranch with paper hearts and stars.

 They have flown to California from all over the world to be close when the fateful verdict is read. They have strung proclamations of love along quiet rural roads and readied white doves to release to celebrate the acquittal that they expect to hear from court.

 Now Michael Jacksons die-hard fans, who have kept an anxious and sometimes angry vigil for almost five months during the pop stars child molestation trial, can only hope that a jury of eight women and four men agrees with them. Its nerve-racking for us, said 26-year-old Gaby Parker of Austria, adding: It must be worse for Michael.

 More than a hundred fans gathered outside the courthouse, yesterday ready in case a quick verdict would be announced. They waved placards and displayed homemade signs. Dont Mess with MJ Fans read one. Justice Dont Fail Us, read another. But beneath the lively camaraderie among Jacksons supporters, the tension was evident.

 Jurors began deliberations on Friday to determine whether Jackson, 46, molested a 13-year-old cancer survivor in 2003. The singer is also accused of plying the boy with alcohol and conspiracy to commit child abduction, false imprisonment and extortion.

 Were not trying to think about (the verdict) all the time, but we all know it could happen any time, said Ronan Davie, who cancelled a return flight home to Scotland in order to stay in California for the verdict. Being in that courtroom, it could be a dream or it could be a nightmare.

 Pressed against a chain-link fence outside the courthouse and surrounded by a throng of screaming fans sat a cage of 10 white doves. For each innocent verdict, I will release one, said fan Fariba Garmani, 44. And how were the wide-eyed birds reacting to the commotion around them? Theyre shocked, I think, Garmani said.

 After jurors stopped deliberations for the day, fans drove cars emblazoned with MJ is Innocent and We Love Michael to the singers ranch, where streamers and paper decorations of red hearts, stars and doves adorned the entrance. It was supposed to be a surprise for Michael, said Parker.

 Fans swapped Jackson stories, played their favourite Jackson songs on car stereos and complained about the media. One fan wore a: Leave Him Alone T-shirt.

 Another, 21-year-old Sam Davidson of London, recounted how he and his girlfriend were eating at a restaurant near the courthouse earlier when they noticed Jacksons defence team nearby. I said: This ones on us, Davidson recalled telling lead attorney Tom Mesereau before picking up the $60 lunch tab.

 Davidsons parting words to the veteran attorney were clear:Well see you on vindication day.

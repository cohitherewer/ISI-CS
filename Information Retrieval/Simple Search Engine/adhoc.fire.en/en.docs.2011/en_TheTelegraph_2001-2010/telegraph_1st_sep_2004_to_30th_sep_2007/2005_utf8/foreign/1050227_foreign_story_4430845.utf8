 Trekkies rush to protest Trek end

 Los Angeles, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Star Trek fans from around the world gathered at the gates of Paramount Studios in Hollywood yesterday to protest the impending cancellation of the television series Star Trek: Enterprise.

 Carrying signs reading: ?It?s Not Just a Show, It?s a Responsibility? and ?18 Years of Loyalty and This Is the Thanks I Get??, more than 100 people massed at the gates of Paramount, where Enterprise is produced, to show support for a franchise that has perhaps the most loyal fan base in the world. 

 None wore costumes, however, in a departure from many gatherings of ?Trekkies.?

 The UPN network, which like Paramount is a unit of Viacom Inc., said earlier this month it would end Enterprise in May after four seasons on air. But the fans are not letting it go quietly.

 Paramount and UPN officials declined to comment.

 Star Trek: Enterprise... is quality television, unlike a lot of the reality you see on TV today,? said Candice McCallie, the Texas-based publicity director for website TrekUnited.com and an organiser of yesterday?s protest.

 And organised it was ? attendees had professional laminated badges, posters and even permits from the LA police department to block the sidewalks around the studio.

 Although the original series created by Gene Roddenberry ran only from 1966 to 1969, at least one version of Star Trek has constantly been on air since 1987 ? The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and now Enterprise.

 Florida fetters 5-year-old

 St Petersburg (Florida), April 23 (AP): An attorney says he plans legal action against police officers who handcuffed an unruly five-year-old girl after she acted up in her kindergarten class.

 A video camera, which was rolling on March 14 as part of a classroom self-improvement exercise, captured images of the girl tearing papers off a bulletin board, climbing on a table and punching an assistant principal before police were called to Fairmount Park elementary school.

 Then it shows the child appearing to calm down before three officers approach, pin her arms behind her back and put on handcuffs as she screams: ?No!?

 Largo lawyer John Trevena, who provided the tape to the media this week after obtaining it from police, says the officers went too far. 

 ?The image itself will be seared into people?s minds when you have three police officers bending a child over a table and forcibly handcuffing her,? said Trevena, who represents the girl?s mother, Inga Akins. 

 ?It?s incomprehensible ... There was no need for that.?

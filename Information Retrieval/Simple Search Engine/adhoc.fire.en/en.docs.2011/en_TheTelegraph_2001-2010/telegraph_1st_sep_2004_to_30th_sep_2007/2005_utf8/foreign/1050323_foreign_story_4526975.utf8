 Pain reduces Jackson to tears

 Santa Maria (California), March 22: Michael Jackson staged another dramatic entrance at his trial for alleged child abuse yesterday, arriving late, appearing to be in great pain and being almost carried to his seat by aides.

 With the court due to start sitting and Jackson nowhere to be seen, tension in the courtroom grew and rumours spread that yet another medical emergency had laid him low. Thomas Mesereau, his lawyer, paced nervously in the court making frantic phone calls as the minutes ticked by.

 When Jackson finally appeared, he shuffled into court, supported by his bodyguards and brother, Jackie, and accompanied by a hospital doctor, wearing scrubs.

 He was ghostly white, shaking and struggling to walk and his appearance drew gasps from the 40 or so fans in the courtroom. The pop star was lowered slowly into his seat, where he remained for just four minutes before being escorted out. As he was led from court, he dissolved into tears after halting in apparent pain halfway towards the door.

 Holocaust horrors not heeded: UN

 United Nations, Jan. 24 (Reuters): If the world had listened to horrors of the Holocaust, perhaps mass murder in Cambodia, Bosnia and Rwanda could have been prevented, speakers told the first-ever UN General Assembly session on the Holocaust of World War II.

 Both UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, a death camp survivor, also asked how some of Europe?s most cultured people could participate in mass murder of Jews by day and read Schiller and listen to Bach in the evening.

 The special session, at which survivors and the foreign ministers of Germany, France, Argentina, Armenia, Canada and Luxembourg spoke, is a memorial to the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the largest Nazi Germany death camp.

 ?If the world had listened we may have prevented Darfur, Cambodia, Bosnia and naturally Rwanda,? Wiesel told the 191-nation Assembly, whose members agreed to the session.

 ?We know that for the dead it is too late. For them, abandoned by God and betrayed by humanity, victory did come much too late,? Wiesel said. ?But it is not too late for today?s children, ours and yours. It is for their sake alone that we bear witness.?

 The author drew attention to the indifference of the West during the war to accept more refugees, allow more Jews to go to Israel, or bomb the railway lines to the large Auschwitz-Birkenau camp site where more than 1 million people were gassed to death or died of starvation and disease.

 ?In those times those who were there felt not only tortured, murdered by the enemy but also by what we considered to be the silence and indifference of the world,? Wiesel said. ?Now, 60 years later, the world at least tries to listen.?

 The liberation of Auschwitz is to be observed this year as Holocaust Memorial Day, with world leaders attending ceremonies in Poland on January 27, exactly 60 years after Soviet Red Army troops liberated the death camp.

 Annan told the Assembly that at this moment, ?terrible things are happening today in Darfur, Sudan.? He asked the UN Security Council to take action once it received a UN report tomorrow determining whether genocide has occurred and identifying gross violations of human rights.

 And Israel?s foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, warned that ?the brutal extermination of a people began not with guns or tanks but with words systematically portraying the Jews and others as not legitimate, something less than human.?

 He said one would never know if the UN, created after World War II, could have prevented the Holocaust. But he said the UN as well as each individual member state needed ?to re-dedicate ourselves to ensuring that it will never happen again.?

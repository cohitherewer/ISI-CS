 New Bond off the trigger

 Craig: Shaken

 London, Oct. 25: Daniel Craig will wield 007s famous Walther PPK in the upcoming adaptation of Ian Flemings Casino Royale.

 But he told OK! magazine: I hate handguns. Handguns are used to shoot people and as long as they are around, people will shoot each other.

 Thats a simple fact. Ive seen a bullet wound and it was a mess. It was on a shoot and it scared me. Bullets have a nasty habit of finding their target and thats whats scary about them.

 Nor does the 37-year-old share Bonds love of Martinis, shaken not stirred.

 I love a Martini straight up. I dont think anybody makes a Martini stirred any more, he said. 

 Craig was unveiled as the successor to Pierce Brosnan earlier this month after a dramatic launch in which he rocketed up the Thames on a military speedboat.

 He is not the first Bond to reveal a hatred of his characters key accessory.

 Roger Moore, who played the spy from 1973 to 1985, said after quitting the role that he hated that awful pose of Bond with his gun, which has become an iconic movie image.

 The actor later became an ambassador for childrens charity Unicef and declared: Today I am completely opposed to small arms and what they can do to children. I played every role tongue-in-cheek because I dont really believe in that sort of hero. I dont like guns. 

 Craig admitted taking the role was a big responsibility but added: Ive just got to step up the plate and deal with it.

 Pitt, Jolie top most beautiful people list

 Angelina Jolie

 Los Angeles, April 28 (Reuters): Whether or not Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie truly are linked romantically, the pair will always share this: People magazine yesterday named them 2005?s most beautiful man and woman.

 People also reckons motherhood becomes Julia Roberts. The Oscar-winning actress who gave birth to twins in November graces the cover of the magazine?s ?50 Most Beautiful People? special issue due at newsstands tomorrow.

 For Roberts, it marks a record third time she?s been the ?Beautiful People? cover girl and the ninth time she?s made the list, tying Halle Berry for the most appearances on People?s annual roster of good-looking guys and girls.

 This year?s best actor and actress Oscar winners, Jamie Foxx (Ray) and Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby), hit the list, as did singers Jennifer Lopez, Alicia Keys and Usher.

 From the world of sports came soccer star David Beckham and tennis player Maria Sharapova.

 At 51, Oprah Winfrey is on the roster for the second time, and she shares her beauty tips with the magazine. ?It?s a combination of eating consciously, vigorous exercise and being comfortable in my body,? Winfrey tells the magazine.

 Couples on the list are singer Seal and model Heidi Klum, as well as Spanish actress Penelope Cruz and current boyfriend Matthew McConaughey, and Jude Law and Sienna Miller.

 There has been widespread speculation that Jolie and Pitt, who star in summer movie Mr and Mrs Smith, are involved, but they have not publicly acknowledged it. The rumours heated up after Pitt and his wife, Jennifer Aniston, separated in January. Aniston later filed for divorce.

 The list was compiled from an online poll with some 500,000 votes.

 Alarms put UK, Europe on edge

 Rome, July 11 (Reuters): Bomb threats have left European cities on edge after blasts in London that killed at least 52 people last week, with residents wondering where the next attack will hit and trying to cope with nerve-rattling false alarms.

 Londoners, still recovering from Thursdays bombing of three underground stations and a double-decker bus, have had to grapple with a series of threats and evacuations.

 Today, Whitehall, a street that houses many government offices, was evacuated and sealed off for over 30 minutes as police investigated a suspect package. 

 Kings Cross station was also closed briefly due to a security alert.

 But London is not alone.

 Italy and Denmark ? like Britain, key allies in the US-led military operation in Iraq ? have also been the target of bomb scares and menacing Internet messages that threaten to become a daily fixture.

 Of course were afraid, but what can we do? We still have to go to work, we still have to use the Metro to get there, said Adriano Lardera, 64, as he walked out of Milans crowded Duomo metro station by the citys cathedral. Life goes on. And if it happens, it happens.

 There is no reason for particular alarmism, said foreign minister Gianfranco Fini after a reporter asked if he thought Italy would be next.

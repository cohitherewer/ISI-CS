 UN irked by US prison bar

 Geneva, Nov. 19 (Reuters): UN human rights investigators rejected an invitation to visit the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, saying yesterday Washington would not let them interview the more than 500 people held there.

 The envoys, who report on torture, arbitrary detention and other abuses for the UN, had warned that they would not go unless Washington let them speak to detained terrorism suspects as well as US prison staff and officials.

 This was normal practice on all such visits, they said. But Washington replied that only the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was permitted to speak directly to detainees.

 We deeply regret that the US government did not accept the standard terms of reference for a credible, objective and fair assessment of the situation of the detainees, the five UN investigators said in a statement.

 Under the circumstances, we will not be travelling to Guantanamo Bay naval station, they added.

 Washington defends its treatment of prisoners and denies that torture has occurred at the Guantanamo facility, which opened in January 2002, just months after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US. Most of the detainees were seized in Afghanistan.

 Human rights activists have criticised jail conditions and the indefinite detention without trial of suspects at the naval base in Cuba. 

 Of the five envoys, Washington invited only three ? Austrias Manfred Nowak, special investigator on torture; Pakistans Asma Jahangir, who focuses on religious freedom; and Algerias Leila Zerrougui, who looks into arbitrary detention.

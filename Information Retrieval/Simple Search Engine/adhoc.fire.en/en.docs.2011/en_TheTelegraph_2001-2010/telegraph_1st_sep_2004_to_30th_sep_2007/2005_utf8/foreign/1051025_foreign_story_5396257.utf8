 Are you Bangalored?

 London, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Dont know a fanboy from an overdog? Fear not ? help is at hand.

 As the English language battles against a tide of buzzwords and jargon, Susie Dent has sprung to the rescue of the linguistically bewildered.

 From machosexuals to spear-phishing, she has compiled a language report that shows how business, politics and the media are all to blame for the gobbledygook that all too swiftly becomes common parlance.

 In her reference book Fanboys and Overdogs the linguistic expert hails the languages vitality in the age of the Internet and concludes: We can only guess at where English is heading. For the moment though, there is plenty to marvel at.

 For Dent, an editor and translator best known as resident dictionary expert on the cult British TV show Countdown, business-speak deserves a linguistic Oscar for sheer obfuscation.

 For this is the age of the rate tart ? someone who switches credit cards at will in pursuit of the best interest rates ? and the empty suit ? a person in a position of authority but with no real power.

 And anyone downsized from a multinational which outsources business to India now knows what it is like to be Bangalored.

 Jargon can swamp the language, with one investment company mocked for reminding customers: Please ensure that all registered holders complete and sign the enclosed Form of Renunciation. Due to a temporary issue, we are currently unable to pre-populate all holders names and addresses.

 Words bubbling under the surface of everyday usage often catch the lexicographers eye.

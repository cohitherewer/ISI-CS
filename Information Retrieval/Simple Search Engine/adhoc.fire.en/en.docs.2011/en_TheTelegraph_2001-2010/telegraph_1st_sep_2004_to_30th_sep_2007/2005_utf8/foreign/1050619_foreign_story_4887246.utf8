 Dogs life for tigers

 Moscow, June 18 (Reuters): Two Amur tiger cubs rejected by their mother have been adopted by a dog whose owner answered a Russian zoos appeal for a foster parent.

 First Channel television today showed the two cubs being breast fed by a brown and black mongrel called Naida, whose own puppy looked content to share her milk with its new siblings. Tiger cubs weigh more than a kilogram at birth and it is clear that a cat, because of its size, could not produce enough milk to allow the cubs to grow properly, Yuri Makhrov, deputy director of Siberias Krasnoyarsk zoo, told the channel.

 The cubs were gaining 80 grams a day. Amur tigers are the largest cat species in the world, and around 400 still live in the wild in Russias Siberian east. 

 Nutty feast on nettles

 London (Reuters): A handful of hardy 

 souls will descend on a quiet English village this weekend 

 to stuff their mouths full of stinging nettles in a bizarre 

 competition which started as an argument in a pub. Combatants 

 will gather at The Bottle Inn in Marshwood, southwest England, 

 to take part in the 9th annual World Nettle Eating Championship. 

 It is a mouth-watering prospect. Competitors must pluck 

 and eat as many leaves as they can from the feathery, stinging 

 plants in the space of one hour. Their achievement is measured 

 in feet and inches ? the combined length of the bare stems 

 they discard.

 Astronauts look for cracks on shuttle

 Houston, July 27 (Reuters): Astronauts on the shuttle Discovery slowly scanned the wings and nose of their spacecraft with a laser-equipped robot arm today in a critical safety inspection never before performed on a shuttle mission.

 Manoeuvering the computer-aided arm from within the orbiter, the astronauts looked for cracks that could endanger the shuttle when it returns to the Earths atmosphere for landing on August 7 and builds up temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

 Television shots from space showed the procedure from the perspective of the laser, which is accompanied by a television camera, as the robot arm crept along the black edge of the wing. Almost halfway through the inspection, which was expected to take seven hours, no signs of damage had been apparent. 

 At one point, engineers on the ground asked for a second look at a suspect spot, but astronauts went back over the area with the camera at a different angle and it showed nothing.

 Everything has gone exceptionally well, Nasa spokesman Rob Navias said.

 The painstaking inspection is one of many safety measures put in place after the fatal Columbia disaster on February 1, 2003, when a loose chunk of insulating foam at launch damaged the wing and caused the shuttle to disintegrate on re-entry over Texas, killing its seven astronauts. Discovery was launched yesterday from Florida in the first shuttle flight since Columbia. 

 The launch was smooth but not flawless. Video from one of an array of cameras at the takeoff showed a nick in heat-protective tiles near the nose landing gear and an unexplained piece of debris falling away from the exterior fuel tank. The debris did not strike the shuttle, but the 2.5 cm gouge in the tile would require further study, said flight operations manager John Shannon.

 Because of schedule constraints, todays inspection would not include a look at the damaged tile.

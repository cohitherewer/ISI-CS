 Costly yawn

 Los Angeles, April 21 (Reuters): Boredom proved costly to a potential juror who let out a loud yawn in a Los Angeles courtroom and was promptly ordered to to pay a $1,000 fine.

 Los Angeles Superior Court judge Craig Veals found the man in contempt of court during an lengthy April 1 jury selection procedure when he waved his arms, yawned, and told the judge he was ?really bored,? court officials said yesterday.

 Veals imposed a $1,000 fine but slashed it to $100 when the man protested as he turned up to pay a few days later. The man, whose identity was not revealed, was not selected to serve on a jury.

 Under California law, judges can fine anyone up to $1,500 to enforce order in the courtroom. But lawyers said they had never heard of such a punishment for yawning.

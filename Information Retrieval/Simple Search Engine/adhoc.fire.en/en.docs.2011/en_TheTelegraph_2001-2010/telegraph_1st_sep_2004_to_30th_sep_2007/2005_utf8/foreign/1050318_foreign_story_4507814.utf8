 Rape cry at Pervez door

 Islamabad, March 17 (Reuters): The victim of a notorious gangrape in Pakistan appealed to the President today for the re-arrest of four men, convicted for an attack on her but later freed, until a final Supreme Court ruling on the case.

 The men were released from prison in the central town of Dera Ghazi Khan on Tuesday pending a Supreme Court hearing. The victim, Mukhtaran Mai, says she fears for her life now that the four are free and she asked President Pervez Musharraf to intervene. ?It is an appeal to the President to keep these men in custody until a final judgment is made by the Supreme Court,? Mai said in Islamabad.

 Berlusconi left in lurch by ally

 Silvio Berlusconi: Crunch time

 Rome, April 15 (Reuters): An Italian coalition party announced today it was quitting the government in a move likely to force Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to resign and seek a fresh mandate from parliament.

 Sparking the worst political crisis of Berlusconi?s four years in office, the Union of Christian Democrats (UDC) said its four ministers would leave the cabinet and urged the Prime Minister to form a new administration with new policies.

 Berlusconi, who is determined to serve a full five-year term, due to end in spring 2006, has previously said he would not accept a major overhaul of his Centre-Right coalition. But after the UDC decision he said all options were open. :I am completely unworried because as far as I?m concerned, I havent ruled anything out,? he said, adding in his famously self-confident style: ?You?re not going to get rid of me that easily.?

 The political crisis was triggered by local elections earlier this month in which the government parties lost 11 of the 13 regions up for grabs in a sign of voter discontent over months of economic stagnation.

 The centrist UDC party said the unexpectedly heavy defeat meant the government needed a radical revamp in personnel and policies if it wanted to win general elections slated for 2006.

 Berlusconi rejected the demand and UDC leaders decided today to quit the cabinet in an effort to force him into a U-turn, said European affairs minister Rocco Buttiglione, a UDC member.

 ?The leadership of the UDC has approved a document to withdraw its team from the government and reiterates that the party secretary should work for the creation of a new government ... headed by Berlusconi,? said Buttiglione.

 The UDC indicated that if Berlusconi refused the request the party would continue to support his coalition in parliament. 

 But that ?external support? would leave Berlusconi exposed, without a formal majority in either the upper of lower houses of parliament.

 Berlusconi must now decide whether to try to forge ahead with the three remaining major coalition partners or start talks with the UDC on the formation of a new administration.

 Alternatively he could resign and refuse to head a new government. Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi would then have to decide whether to call a snap general election or else try to put together an alternative administration.

 Between meetings with leaders from his coalition today, Berlusconi refused to be drawn on what he may do. Piero Fassino, leader of the main Opposition party, the Democrats of the Left, called on Berlusconi to resign.

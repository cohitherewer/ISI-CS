 Iran lines up human chain

 Tehran, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Irans volunteer Islamic militiamen are vowing to form a human chain along the length of the countrys borders as a show of force against international pressure on Tehrans atomic programme.

 Iran faces referral to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions after failing to convince the world its nuclear fuel programme is intended for power stations rather than warheads. Mohammad Hejazi, head of the volunteer Basij militia, swore he had enough people to girdle the country.

 Nine million Basij will form a human chain around Iran on November 26 in support of the countrys right to peaceful nuclear energy, he said today, adding that the chain would run to about 8,700 km and added President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would attend the ceremony.

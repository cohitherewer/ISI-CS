 BA in bid to save caterer

 London, Aug. 22 (Reuters): British Airways said today talks were under way with Gate Gourmet that could stave off bankruptcy of the caterers UK operations which supply BA with 80,000 in-flight meals a day.

 Europes third-largest airline once owned the loss-making UK arm of Gate Gourmet, which US owners Texas Pacific Group are ready to place into administration this week unless they can cut jobs and win a better contract with BA, a source close to the caterer said at the weekend.

 BA offered Gate Gourmet improved terms as well as a contract extension of two years to 2010 last month, but no deal has been signed. We continue to talk to Gate Gourmet aimed at coming to a conclusion with them, a BA spokeswoman said today.

 The source close to Gate Gourmet said yesterday that the caterer had given BA a deadline of tomorrow evening to strike a new deal or the UK operations could go into administration. 

 Gate Gourmet resumed delivery of hot meals for BAs outbound long-haul flights from Londons Heathrow Airport today after a lapse of more than a week. 

 Inbound long-haul flights are expected to get hot meals again on Wednesday, a BA spokeswoman said.

 Under administration, Gate Gourmets UK operations could continue as normal, run by outside accountants. But analysts say broad powers to restructure the caterer under administration could also trigger disruptions similar to those that sparked a costly walkout at both Gate Gourmet and BA.

 Gate Gourmet has lost money since 2001, including ?25 million last year. Its troubles came to a head this month after staff who were angered by the hiring of temporary workers staged a two-day walkout, which prompted 1,000 BA ground staff to also walk off the job.

 Owners TPG responded by firing more than 500 of Gate Gourmets 2,000 workers based at Heathrow Airport and now face demands from the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) to reinstate them.

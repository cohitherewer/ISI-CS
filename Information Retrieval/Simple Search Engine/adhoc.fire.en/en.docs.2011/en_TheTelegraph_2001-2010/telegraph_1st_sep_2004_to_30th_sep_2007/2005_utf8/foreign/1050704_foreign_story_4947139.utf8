 Islanders cross with Charles

 London, July 3: For nearly 700 years the inhabitants of the Isles of Scilly, the idyllic collection of islands 28 miles south-west of Lands End, have pledged allegiance to king and country.

 This weekend, however, many of the 2,000 islanders are in a state of rebellion against the Prince of Wales because they are appalled and disgusted by the actions of the Duchy of Cornwall, his landed estate.

 Scillonians, as the islanders like to be known, say that over the past year the needs of locals have repeatedly been put second so the Duchy can add further profits to the ?13 million a year it provides in revenues to Prince Charles.

 The latest and most pressing cause of anger is the decision by the Duchy to enter the holiday-home business on the islands for the first time. It has renovated a granite two-bedroom home that has traditionally been used by local teachers on St Marys, the largest island. Following the facelift, the Duchy has put the cottage up for rent as a holiday home for as much as ?1,500 a week. The Guard House is advertised for rent on the Duchys website. 

 The islanders, however, are furious. Mike Brown, the chairman of the 100-member Duchy Tenants Association, said that he was dismayed when he learnt that local people were going to be deprived of the chance of living at the Guard House. With many islanders earning less than ?10,000 a year, it is hard for them to pay more than ?100 a week in rent. I was appalled when I learnt what the Duchy was doing. This is an inappropriate direction for the Duchy to go and it sets a dangerous precedent when we have a tremendous shortage of housing on the island, he said.

 On Bryher, which has just 77 residents, islanders are angry that a property ? the Little House ? has been earmarked as the Duchys second holiday home on the Isles of Scilly.

 The two-bedroom cottage is undergoing renovation after its latest tenants ? a family of four ? were told they could not renew their lease. Now it is expected to fetch more than ?1,000 a week as a holiday home.

 A spokesman for Clarence House denied yesterday that islanders had received a raw deal from the Duchy and said that many tenants had below-market rents.

 Jesus died of blood clot, says researcher

 Jerusalem, June 8 (Reuters): An Israeli researcher has challenged the popular belief that Jesus died of blood loss on the cross, saying he probably succumbed to a sometimes fatal disorder now associated with long-haul air travel.

 Prof. Benjamin Brenner wrote in The Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis that Jesuss death, traditionally believed to have occurred 3-6 hours after crucifixion began, was probably caused by a blood clot that reached his lungs.

 Such pulmonary embolisms, leading to sudden death, can stem from immobilisation, multiple trauma and dehydration, said Brenner, a researcher at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. This fits well with Jesuss condition and actually was in all likelihood the major cause of death by crucifixion, he wrote in the article.

 A 1986 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association mentioned the possibility that Jesus suffered a blood clot but concluded that he died of blood loss. But Brenner said research into blood coagulation had made significant strides over the past two decades.

 Protests leave Laura unfazed

 Cairo, May 23 (Reuters): US First Lady Laura Bush said today she was not surprised at protests by Jews and Muslims during her weekend visit to Jerusalem holy sites, but appealed to both groups to put aside their anger.

 Bush said protesters jostling and haranguing in the walled Old City yesterday had not undermined her solo tour, aimed at countering regional anti-American sentiment.

 These are very, very emotional places. Theyre sacred places to religions, Bush said in a CBS Early Show interview. She told CNN she had spoken to her husband President George W. Bush about the incident, which she said was being exaggerated.

 The First Lady said she deplored any abuses. She told ABCs Good Morning America: Thats not really what happens all the time. Thats not what our troops really do. This is a handful of people.

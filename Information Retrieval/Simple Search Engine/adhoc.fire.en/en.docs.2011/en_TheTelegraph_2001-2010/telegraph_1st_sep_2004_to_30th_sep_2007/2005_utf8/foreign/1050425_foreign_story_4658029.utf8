 Fatal fat figures lose weight, food fight gathers steam 

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 Washington, April 24: A political food fight has broken out in America after obesity was downgraded from the country?s biggest killer after smoking to seventh place. Analysis by government scientists shows that far fewer people than thought die from being fat.

 Their findings ? that 112,000 people are killed by obesity each year, rather than the 400,000 calculated by the US Centre for Disease Control last year ? comes as a blow to ?nanny state? activists seeking tighter regulation of the food industry and lawyers acting for fat clients. 

 The figures also suggest that 87,000 lives were saved because people were moderately overweight. Only extreme obesity carries a severe death risk. 

 Radley Balko, who specialises in ?nanny culture? at the Washington-based Cato Institute, said that the revised estimate would boost those who thought health and diet were a matter of personal choice, not state regulation.

 ?The 400,000 figure was deeply flawed, but it was used by all sorts of policy people ? nutrition activists and politicians ? to argue for government intervention,? he said. 

 ?They want taxes on high-sugar, high-fat foods and severe restrictions on advertising. There are free speech issues. There are clear questions about how effective these measures are. 

 ?Most importantly, all indicators show that we are healthier and living longer. Dig a little more into America?s health statistics and you?ll find that despite our expanding waistlines, we?ve never been healthier.?

 His views were backed by the latest opinion poll, which shows that most Americans believe that responsibility for weight and diet lies with the individual or parents. Only 4 per cent say that responsibility lies with food companies, according to a survey by Dutko Worldwide, a policy management company. 

 In a country where almost two-thirds of the population are officially classed as overweight ? including professional athletes and President George W. Bush who is in good health ? the findings are expected to prompt a rethink of conventional medical wisdom and advice.

 When the Centre for Disease Control released its 400,000 figure last year, Elias Zerhouni, director of the National Institutes for Health, referred to obesity as a ?public health emergency? and demanded more funds. 

 Julie Gerberding, who helped with the first survey, spoke in similarly apocalyptic terms. ?The problem of obesity is really an epidemic, and we need to apply the same tools to combat it as if it were an infectious epidemic.?

 Yet as Americans have become more overweight, rates of heart and cardiovascular disease have fallen. Life expectancy also has risen from 73 to 77 in the past 20 years.

 Walter Willett, chairman of the department of nutrition at Harvard?s School of Public Health, criticised the survey?s methodology. ?I think the papers are really naive, deeply flawed and seriously misleading. Obesity is a huge problem, it?s getting worse fast and there?s no turnaround in sight.?

 Violence mars crucial Pak local polls

 Islamabad, Aug. 18 (Agencies): Ten people were killed and scores injured when clashes erupted between supporters of rival candidates as Pakistanis voted in the first phase of local polls today.

 The three-phase elections are officially being held on a non-party basis, but factions are openly backing candidates to try and ensure their power bases ahead of 2007 general elections.

 Voting to elect councillors was held in 53 districts and in the remaining 56 will be held on August 25.

 Reports said three people were killed in poll-related clashes in southwest Baluchistan and one person in Gujranwala, Punjab. In Bannu, northwestern Pakistan, three people were killed when gunmen opened fire on a candidates supporters.

 A homemade bomb exploded in Khuzdar, a town 400 km south of Quetta, media reports said. Interior minister Aftab Khan Sherpao said that despite the violence the polls have largely been peaceful.

 On September 29, the councillors elected in the first two rounds will elect powerful district chiefs, known as Nazims, who can use their clout to influence the 2007 parliamentary polls.

 The National Assembly and four provincial assemblies formed from the general election will chose a President for a five-year term later in 2007.

 Aides say Musharraf will stand in the next presidential election. He is widely expected to win, but what sort of coalition he will work with remains unclear.

 District poll rivalry is particularly intense in Punjab, Pakistans most populous and politically most important province.

 The main contest there is between the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League and the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party of self-exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. 

 Analysts say Musharraf will be hoping for solid wins by Muslim League-backed candidates, especially in Punjab and Sindh.

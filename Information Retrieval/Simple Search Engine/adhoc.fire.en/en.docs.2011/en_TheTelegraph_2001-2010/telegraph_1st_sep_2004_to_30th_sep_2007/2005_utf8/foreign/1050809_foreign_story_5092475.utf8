 Oil-for-food ex-head took bribes: Probe

 United Nations, Aug. 8 (Reuters): The former head of the UN oil-for-food programme, Benon Sevan, was accused today of receiving nearly $150,000 in kickbacks while another UN official was cited for having received bribes of nearly $1 million.

 The UN-established Independent Inquiry Committee, headed by former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, also said the role of secretary-general Kofi Annan would be investigated further for any role he may have played in the now-defunct $67 billion humanitarian programme for Iraq.

 The probe disclosed that Sevan had funds put in his account through relatives of Annans predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in office from 1992 to 1996.

 And it said a UN purchasing official, Alexander Yakovlev, received some $950,000 from companies or individuals doing business with the UN outside the oil-for-food programme, South African judge Richard Goldsone, a commissioner on the panel, said.

 The inquiry recommended Annan waive immunity for purposes of a criminal investigation of Sevan, a Cypriot, and Yakovlev, a Russian. Separately, the Manhattan district attorneys office is investigating Sevan and Yakovlev.

 Sevan, 67, who served in the UN for 40 years, has denied any wrongdoing. He resigned from the world body yesterday, which automatically lifts his immunity.

 Saddam legal team

 Saddam Husseins family scrapped the international team of attorneys claiming to be representing him today and will pick a new set of heavyweight lawyers to defend him against war crimes charges.

 Benazir, Sharif meet in Jeddah

 Islamabad, Feb. 10 (PTI): Exiled former Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif today met in Jeddah for the first time in six years and discussed a joint strategy to regain their political base in Pakistan.

 The two leaders discussed ?political matters? over lunch, Bhutto?s spokesman Ghulam Muhammad Banglani said. Bhutto?s husband Asif Ali Zardari, who was recently freed after eight years in prison, was also present at the meeting.

 Their meeting came after Musharraf?s overtures to both leaders. Bhutto and Sharif decided to meet again after the PPP chief and Zardari visit the holy city of Mecca.

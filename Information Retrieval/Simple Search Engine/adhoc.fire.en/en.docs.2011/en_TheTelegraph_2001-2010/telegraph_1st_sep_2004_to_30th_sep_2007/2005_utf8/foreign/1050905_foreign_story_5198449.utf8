 Russia navy

 Moscow, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin sacked navy chief Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov today at a time when the military is facing criticism over its handling of a mini-submarine accident last month.

 The Kremlin said Putin had appointed Admiral Vladimir Masorin in his place. Putin did not give a reason for Kuroyedovs dismissal. Local media had speculated that he could be axed after seven Russian sailors trapped in an AS-28 mini-submarine last month were freed with British help.

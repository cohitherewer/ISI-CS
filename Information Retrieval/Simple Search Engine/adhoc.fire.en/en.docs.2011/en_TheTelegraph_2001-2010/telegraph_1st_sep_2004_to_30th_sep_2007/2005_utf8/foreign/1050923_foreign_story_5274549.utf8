 UK plans Agatha boost

 London, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Schoolchildren the world over are brought up on the twists and turns of Agatha Christies crime novels. Except in her British homeland, where critics assail her works as cliched and flimsy.

 So nearly 30 years after the whodunit queen died at the age of 85, a campaign has begun to win her recognition as a page-turner for kids.

 This is not about selling more books. We just want her to be used more in the classroom, said Nicholas James, chief executive of Chorion Plc which owns and manages the Christie copyright. With over two billion books sold, she is listed in the Guinness World Records as the worlds most successful fiction writer. 

 In France, Germany, the US and Japan, she is studied in schools. Here in Britain, she is not a set text, James said.

 Christie has been celebrated by such leading literary lights as Italys Umberto Eco, Frances Roland Barthes and American Raymond Chandler.

 Her books are a perfect way to get children to read. We would like her to be a set text in British schools, James said.

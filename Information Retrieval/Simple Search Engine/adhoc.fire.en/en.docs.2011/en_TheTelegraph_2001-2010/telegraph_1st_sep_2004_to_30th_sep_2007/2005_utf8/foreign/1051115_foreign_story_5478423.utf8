 London, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Many of Britains younger generation of ethnic minorities have broken class barriers and now get managerial jobs faster than their white counterparts, according to research on Monday.

 Educational achievements have helped the offspring of working class parents in the Caribbean, African, Indian and Chinese communities to obtain professional positions, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said. The exceptions to this were youngsters from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities who showed less upward mobility then children from white manual workers families.

 There is good news to the extent that a disproportionate number of the young people who are upwardly mobile are the children of parents who come to this country as migrants, the studys author Lucinda Platt said. The study supports the view that immigrants often experience a drop in their socio-economic class when they arrive in Britain, but often have high aspirations for their children to better their relative ranking.

 It said the class disadvantages of the children of Pakistani immigrants could not be explained by differences in family backgrounds or education.

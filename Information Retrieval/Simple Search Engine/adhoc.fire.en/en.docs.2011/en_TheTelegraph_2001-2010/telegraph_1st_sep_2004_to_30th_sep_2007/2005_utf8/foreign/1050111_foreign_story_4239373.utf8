 Lost post

 London, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Britain?s Ascension Island has been without post since October because the Royal Mail has been sending its mail to South America.

 ?The trouble is virtually nothing has made it here since October,? IT consultant Paul Knowles told the Daily Mirror.

 A British dependency with a population of just over 1,000 people, Ascension Island is 1,131 km northwest of St Helena in the South Atlantic.

 The Mirror said the mail had been mistakenly sent to Paraguay?s capital Asuncion as well as Guyana?s capital Georgetown, which shares the same name as the Ascension Island?s capital. ?Steps have been taken to make sure it doesn?t happen again,? a Royal Mail spokeswoman said. 

 Farm under

 Tokyo (Reuters): Tokyo residents are 

 used to going underground to find food at basement supermarkets 

 and restaurants ? now one firm is taking the process a step 

 further by planning a subterranean farm. A 1,000 square 

 metre former bank vault under an office building in Otemachi, 

 a central Tokyo business district, has been chosen as the 

 site for a high-tech farm growing lettuce, tomatoes, herbs 

 strawberries and rice, the national daily Asahi said 

 on Sunday. The project is aimed at helping the Japanese 

 capital?s jobless to train for careers in agriculture. The 

 underground location will allow complete electronic control 

 of the environment .

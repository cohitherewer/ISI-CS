 Streisand plans new album

 Los Angeles, April 2 (Reuters): 

 Barbra Streisand will release a new album in September 

 to be written and produced by Bee Gees legend Barry Gibb, 

 her publicist said yesterday.

 The as-yet-untitled album comes on the heels of Streisand?s successful return to acting after an eight-year hiatus. 

 She co-starred in last year?s blockbuster comedy Meet the Fockers as a frisky sex therapist for older couples. Gibb will compose a dozen songs for the recording. He worked with Streisand 25 years ago on her Guilty album.

 Streisand?s last album was 2003?s The Movie Album, a collection of original recordings of movie songs.

 Another pop music legend, Neil Diamond is collaborating with producer Rick Rubin on a new studio album. The as-yet-untitled set will be Diamonds first album of original material since 2001?s Three Chord Opera.

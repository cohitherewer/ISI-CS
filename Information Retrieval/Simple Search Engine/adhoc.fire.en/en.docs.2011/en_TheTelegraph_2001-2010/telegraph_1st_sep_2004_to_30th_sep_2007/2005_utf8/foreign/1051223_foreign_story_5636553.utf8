 Zellweger marriage annulled

 Zellweger: No ties

 Los Angeles, Dec. 22 (AP): Oscar-winning actor Renee Zellwegers marriage to country crooner Kenny Chesney never existed ? at least in the eyes of the law. 

 The couples union has been annulled by the Los Angeles Superior Court, according to documents obtained this week by the television show Extra. 

 An annulment is a judicial declaration that a marriage never legally existed. 

 In court papers, Zellweger listed fraud as the reason she was seeking an annulment after four months of marriage. 

 The 36-year-old actor later said it was simply legal language and not a reflection of Kennys character. 

 Zellweger, 36, and Chesney, 37, wed in a small ceremony on the Caribbean island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands in May. It was the first marriage for both.

 In California, an annulment may be granted when either party in the marriage is under 18, of unsound mind, bound to a previous marriage or if the consent to marry was obtained by fraud or force.

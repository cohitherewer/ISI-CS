 Fate of US feed-tube woman with courts

 Washington, March 21 (Reuters): The fate of a brain-damaged Florida woman went back to the courts early today after President George W. Bush signed emergency legislation aimed at prolonging the life of Terri Schiavo.

 The President signed the legislation at 1.11 am (local time) after extraordinary intervention by lawmakers that drew Congress back from Easter recess and into a bitter family dispute as it tried to circumvent years of state court rulings.

 CNN reported a federal judge in Tampa was considering early this morning whether to re-insert the feeding tube that had been removed from the 41-year-old woman on Friday.

 David Gibbs, a lawyer for Schiavo?s parents, filed a restraining order and lawsuit with the federal court as soon as the bill was signed into law in Washington, CNN said.

 Bush had cut short a Texas vacation and flew back to Washington to be available to sign the bill immediately.

 ?Today, I signed into law a bill that will allow federal courts to hear a claim by or on behalf of Terri Schiavo for violation of her rights relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life,? Bush said.

 The House of Representatives passed the measure 203-58 shortly after midnight following three hours of debate. The Senate cleared it unanimously yesterday.

 ?We are very, very thankful to have crossed this bridge,? Suzanne Vitadamo, Terri Schiavo?s sister, said after the House vote. ?We are hopeful, we are very hopeful, that the federal courts will follow the will of Congress and save my sister?s life.?

 The measure gives US district court in Tampa, Florida, jurisdiction on a case that has been taken up by Republican congressional leaders and galvanised activists on both sides of the end-of-life issue.

 Several Democrats objected, calling the legislation a political exploitation of a tragic family matter that undermines Florida courts and states? rights. But House Republican leader Tom DeLay of Texas said: ?This is not a political issue. This is life and death, and this is a bipartisan attempt to save this life.?

 Schiavo has been fed through a stomach tube since a heart attack starved her brain of oxygen in 1990, leaving her in what the courts declared was a persistent vegetative state.

 Schiavo?s husband and legal guardian, Michael Schiavo, has long argued ? and has been supported by the courts ? that his wife would not have wanted to live in such a condition. The tube feeding has twice been halted and resumed in the past amid legal wrangles. 

 Schiavo was expected to survive for one to two weeks without it at the Florida hospice that cares for her. Schiavo?s parents say she is responsive and can be rehabilitated. Her father, Bob Schindler, said he spoke with her about going out to breakfast after the vote.

 ?I got a big smile out of her face, so help me God,? he said.

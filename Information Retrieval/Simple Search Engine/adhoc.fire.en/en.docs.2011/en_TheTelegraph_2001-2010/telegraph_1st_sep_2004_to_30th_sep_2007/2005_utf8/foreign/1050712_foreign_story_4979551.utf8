 Arsonists burn Russia shop, 20 die

 Moscow, July 11 (Reuters): Arsonists torched a Russian shop today, killing 20 people, officials said.

 Bodies were sprawled along the verges of the street in the town of Ukhta, around 1,500 km northeast of Moscow, while medics tried to resuscitate young men and women lying on stretchers as the building burned behind them.

 Television quoted witnesses as saying bars over the shops ground floor windows had stopped people from escaping the blaze. Two teenagers ran into the trading hall on the ground floor and threw a container with a burning substance into the crowd, and the fire spread very quickly, a spokesman said.

 It was probably not a terrorist attack, these were teenagers... the building is two storeys with plastic on the walls, that is why the fire spread so quickly.

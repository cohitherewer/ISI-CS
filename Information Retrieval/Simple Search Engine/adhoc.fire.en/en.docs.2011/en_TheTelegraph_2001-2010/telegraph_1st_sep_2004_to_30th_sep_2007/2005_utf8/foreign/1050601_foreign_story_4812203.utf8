 Saddam trial in 2 months

 Baghdad, May 31 (Reuters): Saddam Hussein could go on trial for crimes against humanity within two months, far earlier than expected, Iraqs new president, Jalal Talabani, said today.

 Asked in an interview televised on CNN when Saddams trial would begin, Talabani said: I hope within two months.

 Leading Iraqi politicians have said several times that the trial could start within months. But Iraqi prosecutors say a trial is more likely in 2006, after several of Saddams lieutenants have been tried, to help build the case against the former dictator.

 US wait- amp;-watch role in nuke scam

 A.Q. Khan: On a long rope

 Washington, Feb. 27: Nuclear warhead plans that Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan sold to Libya were more complete and highly detailed than previously disclosed, raising new concerns about the cost of Washington?s watch-and-wait policy before Khan and his global black market were shut down last year. 

 Two Western nuclear weapons specialists who have examined the top-secret designs say the hundreds of pages of engineering drawings and handwritten notes provide an excellent starting point for anyone trying to develop an effective atomic warhead. 

 ?This involved the spread of very sensitive nuclear knowledge and it is the most serious form of proliferation,? said one of the specialists. Both described the designs on condition that their names be withheld because the plans are classified. 

 The sale of the plans is particularly troubling to some investigators because the transaction occurred at least 18 months after US and British intelligence agencies concluded that Khan was running an international nuclear smuggling ring and identified Libya as a suspected customer, according to US officials and a British government assessment. 

 Interviews with current and former government officials and intelligence agents and outside experts in Washington, Europe and West Asia reveal a lengthy pattern of watching and waiting when it came to Khan and his illicit network. 

 The trail dated back more than 20 years as Khan went from a secretive procurer of technology for Pakistan?s atomic weapons programme, which he headed, to history?s biggest independent seller of nuclear weapons equipment and expertise. 

 For most of those years, Khan?s primary customers were Iran and North Korea. 

 Despite knowing at least the broad outlines of Khan?s activities, American intelligence agencies regularly objected to shutting down his operations and policymakers in Washington repeatedly subordinated stopping him to other strategic goals, according to current and former officials. 

 Some officials said the intelligence was too limited to act on even as the picture of the threat posed by Khan?s operation got clearer and bigger in 2000 and 2001.

 Other officials said the CIA and National Security Agency, which eavesdropped on Khan?s communications, were so addicted to gathering information and so worried about compromising their electronic sources that they rebuffed efforts to roll up Khan?s operation for years. 

 ?We could have stopped the Khan network, as we knew it, at anytime,? said Robert Einhorn, a top counter-proliferation official at the state department from 1991 to August 2001. ?The debate was, do you stop it now or do you watch it and understand it better so that you are in a stronger position to pull it up by the roots later? The case for waiting prevailed.?

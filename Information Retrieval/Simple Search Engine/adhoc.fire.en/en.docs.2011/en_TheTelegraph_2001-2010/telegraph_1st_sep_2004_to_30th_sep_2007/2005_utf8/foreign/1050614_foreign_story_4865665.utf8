 Monks denounce Lanka plan

 Colombo, June 13 (Reuters): Furious Buddhist monks, their eyes streaming from teargas, today denounced Sri Lankas plans to share tsunami aid with Tamil Tiger rebels as riot police broke up the second protest by clergy in a week.

 Sodden by jets from water cannon and coughing amid the acrid gas, around 300 monks carrying banners declaring Defeat the joint mechanism death trap ran for cover as gas canisters rained down to halt their advance towards President Chandrika Kumaratungas palace. 

 We are protesting for the future of your children yelled one shaven-headed monk in saffron, his bloodshot eyes watering and voice breaking as his peers ran for cover. Hardline monks say the Tigers are fascists who should be crushed.

 Kumaratunga met politicians from her ruling coalition as well as the main opposition United National Party today in a bid to muster support for the pact to share $3 billion in international aid with rebel-held areas.

 Sharon to visit US in April

 Jerusalem, March 6 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will meet President George W. Bush in Washington on April 12, Israeli government sources said today, for talks on the West Asian peace process.

 Palestinian officials have already said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a moderate who declared a ceasefire with Sharon last month, will see Bush at the White House next month. The meetings will be separate.

 Sharon and Bush have spoken of a historic opportunity for peace in West Asia after the death of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat last November.

 But they said Abbas, elected two months ago, must rein in militants for any peace efforts to succeed.

 Japan wives

 Tokyo, Feb. 6 (Reuters): For the first time, Japanese who believe that wives should stay home are in a minority ? but an overwhelming majority still wants women to do most household chores.

 The cabinet office survey on gender equality released late yesterday showed that 48.9 per cent of 3,500 respondents were against the view that wives should stay home-bound, while 45.2 per cent supported it.

 But according to the poll conducted last November and December, only 4 per cent said the husband was responsible for cleaning the house, 1.2 per cent for cooking and 3.5 per cent for washing dishes.

 It was not immediately known how many of the respondents were men and how many women.

 Fine Print

 Imagine and play

 Paris, Oct. 24 (AP): A solitary white piano at a John Lennon retrospective invites visitors to play the song Imagine.

 Curator Emma Lavigne said it was a deliberate effort to make people revisit the song that otherwise you might hear in a supermarket, doing your shopping.

 The message is still there. This song is still relevant, she said. I wanted the exhibition to be as alive as possible, so we dont say to ourselves: He (Lennon) is in a museum. Because I think he would have hated that. 

 Cocoa fest

 Paris (AFP): For chocolate lovers, it 

 just doesnt get any better than this. I am in 

 rapture, enthused Maria Costa, 29, of the US, as she 

 sampled her way through dozens of exhibitor stands at the 

 Salon du Chocolat trade show that opened at the weekend 

 in Paris. The gala opening of the 11th annual choco-fest, 

 attended by no less than two French ministers and a bevy 

 models draped in chocolate couture, edible art works, and 

 1001 cocoa-derived comestibles.

 Diva worry

 New York (AP): Madonna is worried that her secret wasnt juicy enough. When her new documentary: Im Going to Tell You A Secret, premiered in New York, she said she was nervous the audience wouldnt like it. It was like: Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, thats too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, theyre going to think its boring! Just worrying the whole way, biting my fingernails off, she told ABC News Radio.

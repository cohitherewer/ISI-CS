 Kylies surgeon hopeful 

 Sydney, May 22 (Reuters): Australian pop diva Kylie Minogue was recuperating today after successful breast cancer surgery.

 Minogue, 36, underwent surgery for early breast cancer on Friday at a Melbourne hospital, and her surgeon was confident the cancer had been caught in time. Local media reported that Kylie left the Cabrini hospital in Melbourne yesterday. Minogues surgeon, Dr Jenny Senior, gave no details about the operation or any follow-up procedures.

 However, Dr Cindy Pam, a medical commentator on Australias Network Seven, said breast surgery patients would normally undergo a course of radiotherapy.

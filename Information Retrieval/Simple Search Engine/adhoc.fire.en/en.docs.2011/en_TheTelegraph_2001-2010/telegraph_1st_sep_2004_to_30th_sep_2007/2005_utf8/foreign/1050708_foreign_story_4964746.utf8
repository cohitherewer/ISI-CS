 Return of 9/11 noise

 London, July 7 (Reuters): For people who experienced the horror of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York, todays blasts in London brought the terror of that day flooding back.

 It was the noise of all the sirens, said Deborah Scott, a financial public relations executive in London who used to live in New York and was there when hijacked planes flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center.

 That was all you could hear, just like that day. That was the most horrible bit.

 Several bankers who were in New York that day said the memories were still too raw in their minds for them to want to make comparisons with London, while others said the attacks would not have as devastating an impact.

 This is not on the same scale and does not have the same psychological impact as September 11 ? though you will not be thinking in that manner if you lost somebody today, said one trader at a US investment bank.

 Theres far less of a sense of panic than 9/11, said one banker who asked to remain anonymous. But also, the scale of todays events is obviously much smaller.

 Another banker who declined to be named said Londoners had lived through decades of violence from the Irish Republican Army. I think were a little more used to it because of the IRA attacks. I remember New York being a virtual ghost town that day, but here it hasnt had the same feeling.

 Still, as news of the devastation filtered out, it was hard not to draw parallels with September 11 and with the March 11, 2004, attacks in Madrid.

 The one thing that totally freaked me and really did give me the heebie-jeebies was the fact that yet again, I could not get hold of my husband or my parents; the phones were completely dead, Scott said.

 But, for the most part, Londoners, renowned for the British stiff upper lip, stayed calm. People are more restrained in London, arent they? Theres less hype, but the same eeriness was there, Scott said.

 In an eerie coincidence, Rudolph Giuliani, who won praise for his quick and cool response to the 9/11 attacks when he was New Yorks mayor, was in London and near the Liverpool Street underground station when the first bomb exploded in a train nearby.

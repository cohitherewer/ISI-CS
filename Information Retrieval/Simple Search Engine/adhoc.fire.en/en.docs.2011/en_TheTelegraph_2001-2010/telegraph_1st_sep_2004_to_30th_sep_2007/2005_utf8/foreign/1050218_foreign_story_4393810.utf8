 30 kg of UK plutonium missing

 London, Feb. 17 (PTI): About 30 kg of plutonium, enough to make seven or eight nuclear bombs, has apparently disappeared from Britain?s largest nuclear plant at Sellafield as it cannot be accounted for by the facility, The Times said today.

 The annual Audit of Nuclear Material at all of Britain?s civil nuclear plants is expected to reveal that the quantity of plutonium at Sellafield was classified as ?material unaccounted for? last year, The Times said. 

 The revelation has been described as an ?accounting issue? by British Nuclear Fuels, which operates the plant. ?There is always a discrepancy between the physical inventory and book inventory,? a British Nuclear Group spokesperson said.

 The spokesperson said the most likely reason for any shortfall was due to the complex measuring processes that are carried out. Asked if it raised concern, she replied: ?I wouldn?t say we would be alarmed by it, because we are only talking about a book figure here.?

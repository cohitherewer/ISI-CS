 Watergate descendants bridge Deep 

 Throat divide

 DEAN E. MURPHY 

 Jones (top) and Felt

 San Francisco, June 5: 

 Nicholas T. Jones and Jarett A. Nixon, law school classmates 

 here, have exchanged tales about Costa Rica, where Nixon 

 was born and Jones enjoyed travelling.

 They have practiced speaking Spanish 

 together, and at one point last year, Nixon, 28, tried to 

 recruit Jones, 23, to work on a law journal at the school, 

 the Hastings College of the Law. Hes a good 

 guy, Nixon said of Jones. Weve had a friendly 

 relationship.

 What neither man knew until the 

 identity of Deep Throat was revealed this week, however, 

 was that they come from opposite sides of one of the most 

 profound divides in modern American political history.

 Nixons great-uncle, whom 

 he recalls fondly as Uncle Dick, was President Richard M. 

 Nixon, a relationship he had never shared with Jones. His 

 grandfather, Donald Nixon, was the Presidents brother. 

 Joness grandfather is W. 

 Mark Felt, the FBI source for The Washington Post who 

 helped bring a premature end to the Nixon presidency. It 

 was Jones who read a statement on behalf of Felt outside 

 the familys home in Santa Rosa, California, the first 

 time Felt publicly acknowledged he was Deep Throat.

 When I found out who it 

 was, it kind of put a smile on my face, Nixon said 

 in an interview. It was like, Hey, wait a minute, 

 I know this guy, he said of Jones, and 

 hes a good guy.

 Since the intersection of their 

 family histories came to light, the two men have not had 

 the chance to speak to each other. Separately, though, the 

 two men have also been trying the same difficult balancing 

 act, staunchly defending their opposing family legacies 

 while insisting in interviews that the past would not poison 

 their own relationship.

 Until this week, Jones said he 

 never made the connection between his law school classmate 

 and the former President, describing it in an interview 

 in his driveway as kind of fun and a cool 

 and interesting factoid. 

 I still see him the same, 

 he said of Nixon. I think hes a cool guy. He 

 seems like the kind of guy whos going to be pretty 

 successful in whatever he chooses to do.

 Even with the pivotal role his 

 grandfather played in the Watergate story, Jones said he 

 was unwilling to criticise President Nixon. He said that 

 this is a time when almost everyone is jumping to 

 conclusions, and that he did not want to do the same. 

 I think its folly, quite frankly, he said.

 Similarly, Nixon refused to pass 

 judgment on Felts role as Deep Throat. He said he 

 would have preferred if Felt had pursued his concerns about 

 Watergate through a more legal route, but he 

 had no interest in joining the debate raging on talk radio 

 and elsewhere as to whether Felt was a hero or a traitor. 

 He said that he had never heard of Felt until Tuesday; his 

 family, he said, had always speculated that Deep Throat 

 was one of his great-uncles secretaries.

 He made a decision and he 

 went with it, Nixon said of Felt. Im not 

 the person to say that was something that was essentially 

 wrong. And God knows, Uncle Dick made his mistakes too.

 When asked about the connection 

 between Jones and Nixon, Amy DerBedrosian, a spokeswoman 

 for Hastings College, said there was a further link. Among 

 the graduates last year was Matthew McGovern-Rowen, the 

 grandson of former Senator George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic 

 presidential nominee.

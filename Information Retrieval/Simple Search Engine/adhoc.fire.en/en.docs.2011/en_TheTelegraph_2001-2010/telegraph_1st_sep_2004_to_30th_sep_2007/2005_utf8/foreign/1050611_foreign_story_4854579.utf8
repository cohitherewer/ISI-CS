 Sleazy secrets

 Beijing, June 10 (Reuters): A graduate student in Beijing has accused her professor of leaking state secrets by giving her copies of exam papers after the two had sex, Xinhua news agency reported today.

 The 26-year-old Beijing Jiaotong University student, referred to by the alias A Fang, claimed she went to the dormitory room of the 51-year-old professor in December 2004 and agreed to sleep with him in exchange for questions and answers from a graduate school entrance exam, it said.

 The woman has accused the professor of leaking state secrets. Under Chinese law, some exam papers are considered state secrets, Xinhua said, based on a report in the Beijing News.

 Mosque raid kills 14 in Baghdad

 Baghdad, Jan. 21 (Reuters): A suicide car bomber killed 14 Shia worshippers as they left a Baghdad mosque today, stepping up a violent campaign to divide Iraq?s religious communities ahead of elections in nine days.

 The bomb, which exploded at a small green-domed mosque in western Baghdad as the faithful finished praying, wounded 40 people, including children, doctors said. 

 The wounded, many wearing smart clothes for the feast of Id ul-Zuha, were taken to a nearby hospital where the emergency room was quickly filled with bloodied bodies, the screams of the wounded and worried relatives. The mosque bombing is the latest in a string of attacks targeting Shia leaders and mosques.

 Fiery Pak cleric hits Dubai barrier

 Fazal-ur-Rehman

 Islamabad, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Pakistans Opposition leader, firebrand cleric Fazal-ur-Rehman, said today he was returning home after authorities at Dubai airport refused him transit to Saudi Arabia and threatened him with deportation.

 Speaking to Pakistans private Geo Television channel from Dubai, Fazal-ur-Rehman said he did not know why the United Arab Emirates had barred him, but he had decided to return to Pakistan.

 It was unclear whether Rehman, who arrived in Dubai airport last night, was being deported.

 They (UAE officials) are not saying anything to us, said Rehman, secretary general of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), an alliance of six hardline Islamic groups.

 First, they told us we can proceed and they stamped (the transit visa). Then they said you should wait and we are waiting, but I have decided to go back to Pakistan.

 Pakistans information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, said the Opposition leader was expected to return tomorrow morning.

 He has been black-listed by the UAE immigration officials and, according to our information, he is being deported, Ahmed said, but he was unable to shed any light on why Rehman was not welcome in the country.

 Rehman led anti-American rallies to protest against the US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

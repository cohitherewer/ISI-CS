 Defence dole for dance

 TOM PETERKIN

 London, May 9: An RAF aircraftswoman received money from Britains ministry of defence to re-train as a stripper, it was disclosed yesterday.

 Stephanie Hulme, 23, was given a resettlement grant to go on a pole dancing course in the West End of London and is now working in a lap dancing club in the capital.

 The disclosure angered politicians, who claimed that it was a waste of taxpayers money at a time when the armed services were facing dramatic cuts.

 A reduction in government defence spending has meant the amalgamation of regiments and a reduction in RAF manpower from 48,500 to 41,000.

 Hulme, who worked in air traffic control and was latterly stationed at RAF Aldergrove near Belfast, took the ?490 course run at the For Your Eyes Only dancing school.

 Yesterday Hulme claimed that the RAF paid her ?2,100 to cover the course, flights to England, accommodation in a four-star hotel and expenses over four weekends.

 ?My request to go on a table-dancing course certainly raised a few eyebrows,? she said. ?The RAF is obliged to help you prepare for work away from the military and has people to help you choose a career or trade. Most people opt for things like plumbing or electrical work, but that didnt appeal to me.?

 Hulme changed career after spending five years in the RAF.

 Patrick Mercer, the Conservative defence spokesperson, said: ?While the resettlement package is very important to help servicemen and women back on to civvy street I do think there is a limit. The MoD has lost sight of its priorities on this one.?

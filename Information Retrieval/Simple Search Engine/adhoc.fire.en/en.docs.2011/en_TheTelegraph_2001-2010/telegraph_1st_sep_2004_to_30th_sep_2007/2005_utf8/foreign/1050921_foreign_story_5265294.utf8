 Korea deal in peril

 Seoul/Beijing, Sept. 20 (Reuters): North Korea jeopardised a six-country deal on giving up its nuclear arms just one day after it was struck by vowing today to keep the weapons until Washington provides civilian atomic reactors.

 The US state department said the Norths views, set out in a long statement, did not match the agreement signed in Beijing.

 China asked all sides to fulfil their promises. Seoul said it would take the lead role in bridging the gap between the US and North Korean views. Japan saw a possible negotiating ploy. We must watch North Korea closely to see if there is really a fundamental difference on that point, Japanese chief cabinet spokesman Hiroyuki Hosoda said. If we are completely at odds, that will mean going back to the beginning. But we do not believe that is the case.

 The six countries had agreed yesterday to a set of principles on winding up Pyongyangs nuclear programmes in return for aid and recognition of its right to a civilian nuclear programme.

 The six agreed to discuss providing a light-water reactor at an appropriate time.

 Analysts noted that the North had backtracked on seemingly rock-solid positions before, and so the deal was not yet dead. Theyve chosen the appropriate time to discuss it as now, said Peter Hayes, a North Korea expert at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I think what theyre doing is negotiating. .

 The Norths foreign ministry statement could be mostly aimed at its own people, said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo.

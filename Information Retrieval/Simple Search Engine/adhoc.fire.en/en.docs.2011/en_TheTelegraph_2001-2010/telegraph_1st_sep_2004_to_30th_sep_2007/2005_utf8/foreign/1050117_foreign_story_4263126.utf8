 Too little, say Iraqis

 Baghdad, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Many Iraqis reacted angrily today to news that US soldier Charles Graner had been sentenced to 10 years in jail for his role in prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib jail, saying he should have faced harsher punishment.

 But struggling to cope with daily violence, crime, and fuel and food shortages, and fearing more bloodshed ahead of January 30 elections, most said they had paid little attention to Graner?s court martial.

 Some said members of Saddam Hussein?s regime responsible for torture and killing at the notorious prison west of Baghdad before the US-led invasion should also be brought to justice. 

 ?It?s too little. This isn?t justice,? trader Ali Ahmed, 23, said of Graner?s sentence. ?Even capital punishment isn?t enough. But since it?s forbidden to torture him the way he tortured the prisoners, I would have settled for the death penalty.?

 Iraqi newspapers had only limited coverage of the court martial and many Iraqis said they had not been following it. 

 ?As an ex-soldier, I admit that no army is perfect,? said 38-year-old meteorologist Ali Mahawi. But he added that he did not think the sentence was sufficient: ?I think 10 years isn?t much and a stronger sentence would have produced a more effective deterrent.?

 Even before the scandal at Abu Ghraib erupted, the prison had a grim reputation because many of Saddam?s enemies were jailed, tortured and killed there. Some Iraqis said that should not be forgotten.

 ?The abuse in Abu Ghraib prison was far worse under Saddam. I don?t blame a foreign army ending up abusing Iraqis because they don?t care about us, but it hurts me to know that Iraqis were abusing Iraqis with the most horrific torture and it?s those I want to see brought to justice,? said Salih al-Jubouri, a 33-year-old unemployed man.

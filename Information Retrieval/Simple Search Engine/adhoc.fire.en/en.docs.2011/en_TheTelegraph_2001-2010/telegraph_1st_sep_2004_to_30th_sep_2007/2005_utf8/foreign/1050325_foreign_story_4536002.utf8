 Smoke sting on principal

 Providence (Rhode Island), March 24 (AP): A student who photographed his principal smoking outside a school building was allowed to return to class after initially being suspended for posting the photos on the Internet.

 School district officials yesterday reversed the suspension of Eliazar Velasquez and said principal Elaine Almagno was wrong to violate a state law that prohibits smoking within 7 meters of a school building.

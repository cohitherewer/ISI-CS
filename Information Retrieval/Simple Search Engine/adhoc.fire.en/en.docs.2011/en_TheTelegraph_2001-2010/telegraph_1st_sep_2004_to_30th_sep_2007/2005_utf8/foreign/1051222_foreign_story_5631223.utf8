 NY begs, bikes and skates to beat strike

 New York, Dec. 21 (Reuters): New Yorkers begged rides on the Internet, dusted off their bikes and put on their skates today in the battle to beat a mass transit strike that has hit business and raised tempers at the height of the holidays.

 I am a fifth grade teacher, and I need to get to my class! read one posting on www.craigslist.com seeking a ride from the Bronx to Brooklyn. Anyone driving from the Met to Brooklyn tonight? read another message from somebody hoping not to waste their tickets to the Metropolitan Opera this evening.

 The bus and subway strike by some 34,000 transit workers is New Yorks first for 25 years. Staff walked out yesterday after talks on pay, healthcare and pensions broke down.

 Todd X, a 36-year-old bicycle mechanic, said his shop, Bicycle Habitat on Lafayette Street in Manhattan, stayed open an extra three hours yesterday to cope with the extra work tuning up old bikes.

 Were getting a lot of flat tires, mostly on decrepit pieces of garbage that people unearth from the basement at the last possible moment, he said. Rudi Hiebert, a medical researcher, said the lack of subways was a good excuse for him to brave the cold and get back on his in-line skates, unused for over a year.

 I need the exercise, he said after crossing Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn. Its a beautiful day ? I think I might keep skating to work even when the strike is over.

 Shopowners, hit at what is usually the busiest time of the year in the week before Christmas, were less cheery: Nobodys walking in, its very dead, said Gary Tepper, who runs an eyeglass shop in Manhattan.

 Officials have said the strike will cost the city $400 million on day one and $300 million a day until Friday.

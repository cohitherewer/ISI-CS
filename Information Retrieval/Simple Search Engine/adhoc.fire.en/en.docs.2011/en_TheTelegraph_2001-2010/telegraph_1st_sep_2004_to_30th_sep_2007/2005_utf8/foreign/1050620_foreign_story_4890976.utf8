 Deal to destroy settler homes in Gaza

 Jerusalem, June 19 (Reuters): Israel and the Palestinian Authority have agreed that Jewish settler homes in the Gaza Strip will be destroyed when Israel pulls out of the area, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said today.

 Rice, visiting Israel and the West Bank, said Israel and the Palestinian Authority had also agreed to cooperate to ensure the withdrawal would proceed peacefully, hailing it as a historic step towards resolving the West Asian conflict.

 Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon reaffirmed there could be no progress along a US-backed peace road map leading to the creation of a Palestinian state unless the Palestinian Authority disarmed and dismantled militant groups.

 In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli soldier was killed and two others were wounded in an attack by Palestinian gunmen on troops and civilian contractors along the border with Egypt, the Israeli army said. One of the attackers was shot dead.

 Israel and the Palestinian Authority agree that the settler homes in Gaza should be removed, Rice told a news conference after meeting Sharon. Therefore the parties will work towards a plan for destruction and cleanup.

 Palestinian officials have said they prefer the red-roofed homes, built on occupied land in 21 Jewish settlements in Gaza, be demolished so that high-rise housing can be constructed in the crowded coastal strip, home to 1.3 million Palestinians.

 It was their choice. If they wanted them, they could have had them, Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Mark Regev said.

 Palestinian officials said rubble from the settlements, whose evacuation is due to begin in mid-August, could be used to build a seaport for Gaza.

 An Israeli official said it would take three to four weeks to complete the pullout and Israel would then immediately raze the houses. He said the Palestinians had agreed to clear the debris in a project that would generate jobs in Gaza.

 During the two-day visit, which included talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas yesterday, Rice called on both sides to agree on specifics about how to carry out the withdrawal, saying time was running out.

 Israel fears that Palestinian militants could fill a security vacuum in Gaza after the pullout unless Palestinian security forces take over from the withdrawing Israeli troops.

 At the news conference, Rice said Israel and the Palestinian Authority recognised the withdrawal must proceed peacefully and without violence directed towards settlers and soldiers.

 Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority will take the necessary actions and will coordinate such actions where appropriate to ensure a peaceful disengagement and economic viability and hope for the Palestinian people, she said, without giving details.

 The most important thing is they need to make certain there are no surprises here, that both sides know precisely whats going to happen and that they can work together, Rice later told Fox News.

 Abbas, citing his fears of civil war, has rejected Israels demands that he confront militant groups that have spearheaded the Palestinian uprising that began in 2000.

 The Palestinian leader has said he prefers to co-opt the gunmen into the Palestinian security services and the groups to which they belong into the political mainstream.

 Sharon is due to hold a summit with Abbas on Tuesday, their first meeting since declaring a truce in Egypt on February 8. Abbas is expected to press Sharon to open Gazas borders, which Israel controls under interim peace deals, to wider movement of people and goods after the pullout.

 Palestinians particularly want to reopen Gazas airport, closed after they began the uprising, and a safe passage for the movement of people and goods between the territory and the West Bank.

 Israel will, consistent with its security needs, evaluate the way it manages the crossings, Rice said at the news conference.

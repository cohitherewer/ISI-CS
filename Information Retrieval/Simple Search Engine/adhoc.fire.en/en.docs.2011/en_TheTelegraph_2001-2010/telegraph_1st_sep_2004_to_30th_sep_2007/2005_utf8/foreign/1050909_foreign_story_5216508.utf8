 Soulful Aretha

 Pasadena (California), Sept. 8 (AP): Mariah Carey, Destinys Child, Alicia Keys and Missy Elliott were the big winners at the 2005 Lady of Soul Awards, but because none of the performers attended the ceremony, Aretha Franklin stole the show.

 The legendary singer received the Lena Horne Award for outstanding career achievements and gave two rousing performances ? Until You Come Back to Me with Stevie Wonder on piano.

 Carey won awards for best solo single and album for The Emancipation of Mimi. Ive got a great place on the mantle, so call me Mariah, joked presenter Dorian Gregory, who accepted the best single award on Careys behalf.

 Powell critical of response

 Washington, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Colin Powell, the former US secretary of state seen as a potential leader for Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts, has joined the chorus of Americans criticising the disaster response at all levels of government.

 There have been a lot of failures at a lot of levels ? local, state and federal, Powell said in an ABC interview for the 20/20 programme.

 There was more than enough warning over time about the dangers to New Orleans. Not enough was done, Powell said.

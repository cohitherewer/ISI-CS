 Fine Print

 Chef for Laura

 Crawford (Texas) Aug. 14 (Reuters): US First Lady Laura Bush, on a quest for the last six months to give White House menus a lighter, more American flair, has hired Filipino-American Cristeta Comerford as the mansions new head chef, the first woman to hold the job.

 After trying out a number of restaurant chefs and other candidates to replace former chef Walter Scheib, the White House settled on an insider in Comerford.

 She devised the menu for last months official dinner for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Phone fear

 London: A mobile phone aimed at primary schoolchildren but withdrawn by the main distributor eight months ago because of health fears continues to be sold in Britain, The Daily Telegraph reported. Health campaigners say they are disgusted that the telephone is still on the market, describing its sale to children as a disgrace. Aimed at four- to eight-year-olds, it can call only five numbers chosen by parents for emergencies.

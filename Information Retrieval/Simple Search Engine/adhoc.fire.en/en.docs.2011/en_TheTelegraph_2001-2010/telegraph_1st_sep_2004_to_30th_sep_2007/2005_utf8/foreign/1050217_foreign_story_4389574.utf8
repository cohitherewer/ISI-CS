 Summers feels the heat at Harvard

 Summers: Under fire 

 Cambridge (Massachussetts), Feb. 16: At the first full faculty meeting since his controversial remarks a month ago on women in the fields of science and engineering, Harvard University president Lawrence Summers yesterday received a rare, full-throated barrage of criticism about his comments and leadership style. 

 At the monthly meeting, eight to 10 speakers lambasted the former treasury secretary, faculty members said, beginning with an attack on his statement at a January academic conference that ?innate differences? could be one explanation for why so few women crack the scientific community?s top ranks. 

 But the focus quickly shifted to a broader critique of Summers? sometimes stormy tenure atop the US? oldest academic institution. 

 ?Usually professors are pretty timid, but they were looking him in the eye and making serious complaints,? said government professor Harvey Mansfield, who joined the faculty in 1962. He said the meeting was the most heated he could remember since the 1960s, when national debates on civil rights and the Vietnam War spilled over into academia. 

 ?It was sustained, and it was passionate. People used this issue to amount a broad, general attack. I think he was stunned by the audacity and the anger,? Mansfield said. 

 Summers, who arrived at Harvard in 2001, has earned praise for his willingness to shake up a sometimes stodgy institution, and enmity for what critics call a heavy-handed and brusque approach to university politics. 

 Several faculty members said he described the backlash that followed his recent remarks about women to the National Bureau of Economics and Research as a ?searing experience?. ?If I could turn back the clock, I would have said and done things very differently,? Summers said, according to an account of the meeting posted on the website of the Harvard Crimson, the only news organisation permitted to attend faculty meetings.

 Walk to the city of death

 Muzaffarabad, Oct. 9 (Reuters): The main city in Pakistan Kashmir was a scene of utter devastation today, 24 hours after a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck, killing thousands across mountainous northern Pakistan.

 Its total devastation. It looks like the city of death, said Reuters reporter Zulfiqar Ali, who was in Islamabad, when the earthquake hit yesterday morning.

 Stopped from reaching his hometown of Muzaffarabad by washed-out roads last night, Ali walked the remaining distance this morning into a scene of complete destruction.

 Most houses, government buildings and shops had collapsed in the small mountain city, he said. No one knows how many have been killed or how many survived. 

 Those buildings that have withstood the shocks are badly cracked and no one is going into them, Ali said.

 Frightened Muzaffarabad residents spent a chilly Saturday night in the open, camped in fields, parks, graveyards and cars.

 Most people had no food because shops or markets did not open. 

 The army had set up camps and provided some food to survivors but much more help was needed, Ali said. 

 Many students of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir University in Muzaffarabad were buried under the debris, residents said. Saturday is a school day in Pakistan.

 Ali said earlier that his house had been destroyed. His young son was buried in rubble but pulled out unharmed, he said.

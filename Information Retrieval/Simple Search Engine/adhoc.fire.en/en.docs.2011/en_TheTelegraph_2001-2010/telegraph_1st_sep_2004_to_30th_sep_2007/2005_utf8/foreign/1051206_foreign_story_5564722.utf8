 Outside zone of comfort, Theron at her best

 - Actress 

 not good at being cool 

 Young and learning: Charlize 

 Theron 

 Charlize Theron took home last years Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a real-life convicted killer in 2003s Monster. More recently, she has been tearing up the screen as a pioneering female taconite miner fighting sexual harassment in the fact-based drama North Country.

 Although the 30-year-old actress may still be, as she says, young and learning, shouldnt she by now be getting used to taking on such strong leading roles? Okay, maybe not ones based on thigh-booted, scantily clad rebel assassin-acrobats from the future. 

 What drew Theron to the title role in Aeon Flux ? a live-action feature film based on the futuristic sci-fi cartoon series by animator Peter Chung ? was the fact that, despite the characters inner and outer strength, the movie felt to her like a foreign genre. But, the actress adds: I like being out of my comfort zone.

 Alluding to the fact that the series was known for its sparing use of dialogue, Theron, who has a 12-year background in ballet, says the thing that fascinated her most about the stunt-heavy movie was the idea of telling stories with your body. That, and the belief that the adaptation, by writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, remained true to Chungs dark original vision. Set in a totalitarian regime, where an underground movement strikes back at government oppression with specially trained killers like Therons character, the film makes larger points about the struggle of the individual today, Theron says.

 Despite the movies setting 400 years in the future, 2415 feels very realistic, she says of the theme of social unrest. I just loved how outrageous this future was and yet how real and contemporary. A bit too real, at one point. Ten days into filming, Theron seriously injured her neck doing a back handspring, forcing a temporary halt in production. After intensive physical therapy, Theron returned to work. Its important for me not to compromise, she says.

 Compromise isnt often an option for the actress, who says that, whether shes doing comedy or an action thriller, shes always looking for projects that can teach her something she didnt know before. Im not very good at doing things just for the sake of being cool. I dont feel I can ever just lean on my crutches.

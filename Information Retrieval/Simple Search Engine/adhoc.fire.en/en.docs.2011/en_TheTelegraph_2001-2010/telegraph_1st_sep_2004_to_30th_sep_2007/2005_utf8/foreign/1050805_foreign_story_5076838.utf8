 London, Aug. 4 (AFP): A new childrens novel featuring a 16-year-old girl being recruited by a terrorist group for a suicide bomb attack has become a British bestseller in the wake of the London bombings.

 Checkmate by Malorie Blackman is number two in the teenage fiction sales charts at Waterstones, Britains leading specialist bookseller. The novel is selling phenomenally well, its publisher said, as Britain hunts down the network behind two sets of bombings in London last month.

 It is our second bestseller in teen fiction, a Waterstones spokeswoman said. Its just outside the top 50 across all genres. Its selling well across the industry.

 Checkmate concludes a trilogy set in a fictional world where noughts, an oppressed class of white people, are dominated by a black ruling class called crosses.

 The three novels focus on a cross girls relationship with a nought boy and centres on how the nought and his family members grow bitter at their unjust treatment and become involved with the Liberation Militia terrorist outfit.

 Nicola Frames, Blackmans publicist at Random House childrens books, insisted the novel could help youngsters understand the turbulent times around them. 

 It looks at why marginalised people might react in certain ways, she said.

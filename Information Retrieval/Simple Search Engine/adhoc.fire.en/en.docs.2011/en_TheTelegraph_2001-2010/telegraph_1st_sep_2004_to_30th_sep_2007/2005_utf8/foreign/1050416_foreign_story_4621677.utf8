 PPP men held ahead of Zardari?s return

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 15: The Pakistan government today put all national airports on red alert as the police arrested thousands of Pakistan Peoples? Party (PPP) activists before the return of Benazir Bhutto?s husband Asif Ali Zardari from Dubai tomorrow.

 While Bhutto described the attitude of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) as contrary to Musharraf?s concept of ?enlightened moderation and liberalism,? PPP spokesman Senator Farhatullah Babar said 17,800 workers were arrested from cities in Sindh, Punjab and North-West Frontier provinces.

 In Islamabad, the police arrested 500 PPP workers as they tried to assemble at the city?s main Aabpara market. 

 The government has already imposed Section 144 throughout Pakistan under the maintenance of public order (MPO) ordinance which prohibits the assembly of more than four persons at one place. Babar said the government wants to intimidate PPP party workers who were preparing to welcome back Asif Ali Zardari.

 Babar was not sure whether the government will deport Zardari after he reaches Lahore. ?I do not know if the government will deport him. What we all know for sure is that the authorities are curbing the democratic and constitutional right of the party workers to receive their leader,? he added. Zardari is reaching Lahore at 4.30 am (local time) tomorrow.

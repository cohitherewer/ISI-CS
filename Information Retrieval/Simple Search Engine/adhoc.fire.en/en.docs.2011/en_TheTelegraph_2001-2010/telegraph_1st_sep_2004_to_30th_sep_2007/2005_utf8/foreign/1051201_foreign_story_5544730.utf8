 Fine Print

 Couple clash

 London, Nov. 29 (Reuters): US pop star Madonna said yesterday she might try her hand at making films, but her British movie director husband Guy Ritchie smilingly said he could do without the competition.

 The 47-year-old singer was attending a London screening of Im Going to Tell You a Secret, a documentary directed by Swedens Jonas Akerlund that follows her 2004 Re-Invention tour. 

 Yeah, this has been a great learning experience and Jonas kept me involved in a lot of the decision-making, she said, when asked if she would consider making a film. Ritchie seemed less enthusiastic. I could do without the competition, he said.

 Record art

 London (Reuters): A Henry Moore marble 

 statuette was sold for more than ?1 million at auction in 

 London on Tuesday, a record price for a carving by the British 

 sculptor. Auction house Bonhams said the ?1,069,600 price 

 paid by a private collector made the 22.3 cm Mother and 

 Child the most expensive 20th century work of art sold 

 in London this year.

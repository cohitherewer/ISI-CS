 Rice keeps pot boiling

 ALEC RUSSELL

 Birmingham (Alabama), Oct. 24: Condoleezza Rice, the ultra-poised American secretary of state, has persistently said that she has no intention of running for the White House and that she expects people to believe her. 

 All weekend, as she roamed her home state of Alabama with her guest Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, she fended off questions about her future. 

 When a girl asked the question on a visit to her old school she looked weary before flashing her famous smile and saying: I dont want to run for office but that doesnt mean some of you cant.

 She tells friends that to run for the presidency you need to want it and that she does not want it. 

 Yet still the question remains and her denials are not convincing enough to rule out the possibility that she may yet seek the ultimate political double of becoming Americas first black and first woman president. 

 The murmur of grassroots support for her is ever present, while with President George W Bush in some difficulties, attention in Washington is shifting to his successor, and the Republicans have no candidate.

 To a casual eye her three-day visit, which focused on her home town, Birmingham, had more in common with the exploratory trips of a prospective politician than the routine of the worlds most powerful diplomat.

 Two things were abundantly clear: she would be brilliant at retail politics and her personal narrative is an image-makers dream.

 At a dress-down dinner on Saturday at Jim N Nicks, a typical southern barbecue joint, she chatted animatedly, exuding the charm that has helped to rescue American diplomacy from the doldrums of Bushs first term. The menu favourites, catfish and pulled pork, were hardly the standard fare of the Washington elite. 

 With many politicians, the meal would have been terribly staged. But Rice is not your average politician. She is a technocrat rather than a politician, having, unlike Straw, never run for office. 

 For Straws aides it was the chance for him to have extended face time with Rice. It was also possibly the most unusual tour of his tenure.

 At each event she was treated like a rock star. She would clearly be a natural at stump politics. Friends suggest, however, that the experience of Colin Powell, her predecessor, who considered running in the mid-Nineties but decided against it, is not lost on her.

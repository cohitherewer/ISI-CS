 UK heat again on Blunkett

 London, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Pressure mounted on senior cabinet minister David Blunkett today as the government said it was looking into claims he may have broken a ministerial code of conduct over his involvement with a hi-tech company.

 The work and pensions secretary, 59, is accused of breaching the code over his involvement with a British DNA testing firm and shares his family holds in it. Advice is being sought. Where there are matters of interpretation its quite reasonable for advice to be sought, said Prime Minister Tony Blairs spokesman.

 Blair brought Blunkett back to government in May, just six months after he had quit as home secretary in a sex and abuse-of-office scandal.

 Blunkett quit last year after weeks of lurid stories about his affair with a married woman, his paternity claims over her son and allegations he abused his office by fast-tracking a residence visa for her nanny.

 Many critics questioned Blairs decision to bring him back so soon.

 If his old ally were forced out again, just months later, serious questions would be posed about the premiers judgment.

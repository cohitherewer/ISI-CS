 Harvard chief sorry for slur on women

 Lawrence Summers

 Cambridge (Massachusetts), Jan. 20 (Reuters): Harvard University president Lawrence Summers has written a lengthy apology, admitting he was wrong to suggest women do not have the same natural ability in math and sciences as men.

 In his third and most repentant statement this week, the Ivy League school chief sought to make amends to faculty not just at Harvard but across the country who were offended by his remarks at a conference last Friday.

 ?I deeply regret the impact of my comments and apologise for not having weighed them more carefully,? Summers said in a letter to the Harvard community posted on his website and dated yesterday. ?I was wrong to have spoken in a way that has resulted in an unintended signal of discouragement to talented girls and women.?

 Earlier this week, a Harvard faculty committee told Summers he may have damaged the school?s efforts to attract more top female scholars with his suggestion that innate differences between the sexes may help explain why fewer women succeed in math and science careers.

 In his most recent statement ? the third in as many days ? the former treasury secretary said the human potential to excel in science is not dictated by gender, as evidenced by the distinguished careers of many women scientists.

 Summers spoke of having learned much in recent days from a number of e-mails that he said ?made vivid the very real barriers faced by women in pursuing scientific and other academic careers.? He admitted there had been slow progress made in luring more women to the sciences.

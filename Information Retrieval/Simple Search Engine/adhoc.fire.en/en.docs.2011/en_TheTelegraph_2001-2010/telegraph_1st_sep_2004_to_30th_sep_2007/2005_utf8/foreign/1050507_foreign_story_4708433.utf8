 $100 m vanishes from Iraq account

 Washington, May 6: American officials who were given huge sums of cash to rebuild Iraq are being investigated for criminal wrongdoing after at least $100 million went missing.

 The inquiry followed a series of damning audits into the management of rebuilding work in Iraq.

 In an embarrassing conclusion for the Bush administration, the US investigators said money-earned under the UNs oil-for-food programme may have been misused by the occupation authorities.

 In one detailed audit of a single reconstruction office in the town of Hillah, south of Baghdad, about $100 million had not been accounted for, according to the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction.

 The findings included the discovery that cash payments were made without any paperwork, that files had been lost, that a number of contractors were paid twice and that evidence was lacking that contractors had carried out the work they were paid for.

 ?There was no assurance that fraud, waste and abuse did not occur in the management and administration of contracts funded by the Development Fund for Iraq (Dfi), that funds were used in a transparent manner, or that Dfi funds were used for the purposes mandated by (UN) resolution 1483,? the report stated.

 The auditors, who examined a 16-month period ending in October, said that they had uncovered ?indications of potential fraud? and referred the matter to criminal investigators. A separate report by the same office issued four months ago said nearly $9 billion spent across Iraq on reconstruction was unaccounted for from the summer of 2003 to June 2004.

 UN Resolution 1483 allowed the occupying authorities in Iraq to spend money raised by sales of the countrys oil, cash left over from the oil-for-food programme and money seized from Saddam Husseins regime. 

 The American official in charge of handing over large sums of cash was told he was to be removed from his post, but was left in the job for another three weeks. Told that he had not accounted for $1,878,870, he returned three days later and handed over precisely that sum. Auditors said that created the suspicion that he possessed ?a reserve of cash and turned in only the amount? required.

 The report stated that 287 cash handouts worth $18 million were cleared without any contract; 879 payments worth $60 million were made without invoices and 789 worth $58 million were cleared without any indication that they had been completed.

 Jim Mitchell, an audit spokesman said: ?We are not saying the money is lost, we are saying we cant account for it. quot;

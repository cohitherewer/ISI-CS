 Condom teeth

 Durban, Nov. 26 (PTI): A new type of condom with sharp teeth has been unveiled in South Africa that can help arrest rapists. 

 The condom named Rapex is made from latex and has several rows of sharp teeth that can only be removed from the male sex organ of a rapist by a doctor, Sonette Ehlers claimed while demonstrating the device. 

 Ehlers told South African national radio that the Rapex is a personal security device that women will use to protect them from rapists. She said women would have to insert and remove the rapex with an applicator. 

 Ehlers, 57, of Kimberley town in the Northern Cape province gave a demonstration of the condom at the start of two weeks of activism against violence against women and children. South Africa has one of the highest rape incidents in the world with more than 55,000 rapes reported annually. 

 Shy crush

 Beijing (Reuters): Practically whispering her shy brogue to a Chinese translator, young Scottish actress Katie Leung faced the press in Chinas capital with poise on Thursday. Leung, who plays Harrys crush Cho Chang in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, stopped in Beijing to build on what has become Warners biggest Chinese premiere.

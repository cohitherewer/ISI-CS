 Munich massageSpielberg: PR blitz

 Tel Aviv, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Steven Spielberg has hired one of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharons top strategists to market his controversial new film about Israels retaliation for the Palestinian attack on its team at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

 Eyal Arad, who helped mastermind the recent Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, said on Sunday he was promoting the film Munich in the Jewish state, where it has already stirred fierce debate.

 This market is an important market, Arad said. We are talking about a film that has generated a lot of interest here, and naturally that sort of interest can entail some negative reactions as well as positive reactions.

 Arad has already arranged a courtesy screening in Tel Aviv for the widows of two of the 11 slain Israeli sportsmen, attended by the films producer and screenwriter. Munich opens in the US on December 23 and in Israel on January 26.

 There is talk in Israeli security circles of a preview for veterans of the spy agency Mossad, which hunted down and killed Palestinians blamed for the Olympics attack, but Arad said this was unlikely.

 Some former agents and diplomats have already ended their silence on learning that Spielbergs main historical source for the film was the widely discredited 1984 book Vengeance.

 Purportedly based on the confessions of a Mossad assassin who broke ranks in protest at his countrys aggressive tactics, Vengeance portrays a hit team torn by questions of conscience, on the run from Palestinian gunmen, and occasionally inept ? a version of events rejected by historians in Israel and abroad.

 Man charged by cellphone

 London, Feb. 4 (PTI): A taxi driver, who could not get to a crown court on time yesterday, has become the first person to be sentenced by an English court in a call to his mobile phone.

 Aftab Ahmed was on his way to the court in Ipswich from his home at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk county, when he was caught up in the jam caused by a pile-up on the main highway.

 The 41-year-old was able to call his lawyer on his mobile to explain the difficulty but judge Caroline Ludlow decided to continue with the case in his absence because she had a full diary and had to sit in a county court later in the day.

 Ahmed, who was facing a charge relating to his bankruptcy, had already admitted failing to explain his financial affairs in full to the official receiver. 

 After consulting law books, the judge said she did not know of a reason why she should not pass sentence over the phone because she was not imposing a custodial sentence. Rachel Bonner, clerk of the court, said that lawyer McCarthy phoned Ahmed to make sure that he was happy with the unusual situation and to check that he was not driving. 

 The judge had already ruled out a custodial sentence and said she was unaware of any legal restrictions that would prevent her from passing sentence in the defendant?s absence.

 After hearing evidence in his defence from McCarthy, the judge dialled Ahmed?s mobile number from a telephone in the court and sentenced him to 140 hours of community service and ordered him to pay ?750 as costs. 

 The court clerk said the judge had asked Ahmed if he was comfortable with being sentenced over the phone, and when he agreed, she spoke to him in open court and repeated his responses out aloud.

 Ahmed, a father of one but divorced, said: ?I took the view that I might as well get it all over with and hear what was going to happen to me on the phone. I had to sit very quiet and not interrupt.

 ?She asked me if I understood everything, and I agreed. Then she asked me if I had anything to say, and I had a bit of a moan about the costs she wanted me to pay.

 ?It does not really bother me that I might have made legal history. At the end of the day I think the court dealt with me in an appropriate manner.?

 Ahmed had earlier admitted failing to explain to the official receiver the loss of ?22,500 between the presentation of his bankruptcy petition in November 2002 and the start of his bankruptcy in June 2003. 

 The Lord Chancellor?s department said that, as far as it was concerned, it was the first time anyone had been sentenced over the telephone in any of the courts in England and Wales.

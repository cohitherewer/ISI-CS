 Smoke stink

 London, Aug. 12 (Reuters): The new anti-smoking ads from Britains National Health Service really stink.

 Several hundred thousand leaflets are being distributed with the sharp stench of tobacco embedded in them to dissuade teenagers from picking up the cigarette habit. Similar ones are appearing in womens magazines Heat, OK! and Cosmopolitan.

 The research suggests that women of that age are unmoved by messages about health but are much more likely to be moved by issues concerning appearance, said Marc Nohr, managing partner of the independent London agency Kitcatt Nohr Alexander Shaw, which created the campaign. The NHS ads feature an attractive woman, but like the ubiquitous perfume ads, when torn open they emit an odour and suggest the damage done by smoking. We think its the first time the scent strip has been used in this subverted kind of way, Nohr said today.

 The stinky ads accompany a broader campaign that plays on young peoples concerns about their looks and suggests smoking also can cause wrinkles and discoloured teeth. You can do things with direct marketing that only direct marketing can do, like appealing to the senses, Nohr said

 Pizza hut ban

 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants said yesterday it will ban smoking beginning next week in all of its restaurants across the US. It also said it plans to encourage its franchisees to follow suit.

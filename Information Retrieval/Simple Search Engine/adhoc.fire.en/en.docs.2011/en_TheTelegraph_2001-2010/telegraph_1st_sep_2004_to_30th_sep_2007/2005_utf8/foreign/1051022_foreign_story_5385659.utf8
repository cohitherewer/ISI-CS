 New York, Oct. 21 (AP): Does Vinnifer have the same ring to it as Brangelina? Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn were photographed kissing, possibly confirming that their relationship has grown romantic. 

 People magazine published the photos, taken last week in Chicago, in its October 31 issue.

 Reports have swirled for months that the two actors were an item. Previously, though, it was impossible to separate fiction from reality since they were at work filming The Break Up. This time, the co-stars were without a film crew while they spent several days together in Chicago. A call to Anistons publicist was not immediately returned.

 Her divorce from Brad Pitt became final on October 2, concluding four and a half years of marriage.Vaughn co-starred earlier this year with Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith. It was then that reports of a romance between Pitt and Jolie began, which were later corroborated by photographs and public spottings.

 In interviews, Aniston, 36, has denied a relationship with Vaughn, 35. In this months Elle magazine, she said: Hes delicious and funny ... but I dont want to be a rebound girl.

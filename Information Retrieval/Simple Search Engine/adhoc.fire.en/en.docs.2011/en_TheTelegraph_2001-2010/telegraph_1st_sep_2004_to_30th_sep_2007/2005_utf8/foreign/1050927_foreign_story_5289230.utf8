 IRA keeps word, says farewell to arms

 Belfast, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Irish nationalist guerrillas have disposed of the weapons used in a 30-year armed campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, international monitors said today.

 We have now reported to the British and Irish governments that we have observed and verified events to put beyond use very large quantities of arms which we believe are all the arms in the IRAs possession, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning said in a statement.

 We are satisfied that the arms decomissioned represent the totality of the IRAs arsenal, it added.

 The Irish Republican Army (IRA) scrapped what was believed to be one of Europes largest illegal arsenals two months after it pledged to end its campaign and get rid of its guns.

 The move is a historic one for an organisation that once viewed arms disposal as akin to surrender, but its significance for Northern Ireland politics will take longer to assess. 

 The IRAs opponents say they will judge whether the guerrillas have kept their promise to end all forms of violence over the next few months and only then will they decide whether to enter talks on restoring local government.

 However, a revival of the provinces stalled Belfast-based Assembly, seen as key to long-term political stability, could still be years away, given the deep mistrust of the IRA among the main pro-British political parties.

 I believe this development will have a liberating impact, Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of the IRAs political ally Sinn Fein, told Irish state radio.

 It may take some little time but clearly the way is now clear for people who wish to see politics replace conflict on our streets to take up their responsibilities.

 Pro-British opponents of the IRA earlier expressed scepticism about the disarmament move, which was witnessed by officials from the provinces Protestant and Roman Catholic churches.

 In the past, decommissioning as a process has been shrouded in secrecy and if we are to increase public confidence in the process then we want it to be more transparent, said Jeffrey Donaldson of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party.

 Kathmandu, Aug. 2: The Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) today denied that it was arming villagers to take on the Maoist rebels in rural Nepal.

 In a statement here today, the RNAs Public Relations Directorate denied the claims made by Amnesty International in its recent report that it was providing support to the so called Village Defence Forces. The accusation that the RNA has been involved in providing support to what Amnesty has termed Village Defence Forces in its report is not well founded, it said. 

 The statement said the RNA had on the 26th of July 2005, made a public appeal to vigilante groups not to take the law into their hands by killing Maoist activists. We all know that people in some villages across the country have come out strongly against Maoist atrocities independently on their own, the statement said.

 It also claimed that it had a zero tolerance policy regarding sexual violence against children and women. The RNA has handed cases of rape and sexual violence by its servicemen to civilian courts, it said adding that it had already handed over two soldiers accused of raping women in Sunsari to the district court earlier this year.

 Latino wins LA mayor race

 Los Angeles, May 18 (Reuters): Challenger Antonio Villaraigosa claimed victory in the Los Angeles mayoral election early today, unseating a lacklustre incumbent and becoming the first Latino mayor to govern Americas second-largest city in over a century.

 Villaraigosa, 52, the son of Mexican immigrants and a high school dropout, becomes the first Latino mayor of Los Angeles since Cristobal Aguilar in 1872 when the city was a frontier town emerging from its days as a Mexican settlement.

 I will never forget where I came from, and I will always believe in the people of Los Angeles, Villaraigosa told supporters packed into a movie studio lot for a victory party.

 Villaraigosa took about 59 per cent of votes cast against 41 per cent for James Hahn, a veteran who beat the more charismatic Villaraigosa in a bitter 2001 election.

 Hahn, 54, the son of a beloved Los Angeles politician who joked about his own charisma deficit disorder, became the first Los Angeles mayor to lose a re-election bid in over three decades and the first to be denied a second term since 1933.

 Turnout was light at about 30 per cent for the rematch between the two candidates after a hard-fought and largely negative campaign that touched on crime, charisma and ethics and highlighted the citys shifting demographics.

 For his part, Hahn had cited falling crime rates as his major achievement but was outshone on the campaign trail by the more energetic Villaraigosa.

 The former state Assembly Speaker cut deeply into Hahns support, winning the backing of Californias Democratic power brokers, moderate Republicans, both daily newspapers in Los Angeles and even a nod from the citys independent weekly.

 Supporters from former mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican with ties to Californias celebrity governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and basketball great Earvin Magic Johnson gathered to congratulate the new mayor.

 Villaraigosa, who is more fluent in English than Spanish, had played down his ethnicity, recognising the need for cross-cultural support and in deference to lingering unease among many in the city about its shifting demographics.

 Latinos are the largest ethnic group in Los Angeles, making up some 47 per cent of the citys 3.7 million population. Whites make up 30 per cent, African-Americans 11 per cent and Asians about 10 per cent.

 In claiming victory, Villaraigosa, joined on stage by his wife and children, thanked volunteers in Spanish: It is an honour to have your love and support, he said.

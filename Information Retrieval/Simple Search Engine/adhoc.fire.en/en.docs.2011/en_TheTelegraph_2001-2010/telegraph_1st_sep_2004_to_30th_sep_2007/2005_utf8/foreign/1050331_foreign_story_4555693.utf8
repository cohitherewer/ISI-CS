 Nasal tube for Pope

 Vatican City, March 30 (Reuters): Pope John Paul is being fed through a nasal tube to boost his strength, the Vatican said today, casting a dramatic new light on the Pontiff?s struggle to recover from throat surgery.

 Doctors inserted the tube after the 84-year-old Pope failed in efforts to speak in public for the second time in four days. He has not been heard in public since an emergency operation on February 24 inserted a tube into his windpipe to help him breathe.

 The surprise medical bulletin from Vatican spokesperson Joaquin Navarro-Valls was the first official statement on the Pope?s condition since March 10, three days before he left hospital.

 ?To improve his caloric intake and promote an efficient recovery of his strength, nutrition via the positioning of a nasal-gastric tube has begun,? he said in a statement.

 The Pope had appeared briefly at his window overlooking St Peter?s Square on the day he normally holds a general audience. 

 Looking weak but determined, he tried to speak into a microphone but, as on Easter Sunday four days ago, could produce no words.

 He has difficulty swallowing because he suffers from Parkinson?s disease, which limits muscle movement. He already has a tube to allow air into his windpipe.

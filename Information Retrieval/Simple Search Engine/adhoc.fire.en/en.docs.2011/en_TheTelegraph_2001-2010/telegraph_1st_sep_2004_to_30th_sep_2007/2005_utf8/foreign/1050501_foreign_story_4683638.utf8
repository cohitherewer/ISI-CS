 Brown?s plan

 London, April 30 (Reuters): Tony Blair?s finance minister Gordon Brown reignited the unpopular Iraq war as an election issue today, just days before Britain?s May 5 vote, by saying parliament should have the last say on military action.

 Brown?s comments came despite attempts by his Centre-Left Labour party to steer its campaign onto what strategists see as vote-winning issues, including the economy and health. Iraq ? widely viewed as Blair?s weakest spot ? has dominated the campaign in its last stretch, especially after leaked advice from the government?s top lawyer showed he had doubts about the legality of the conflict.

 But Brown, widely seen as Blair?s rival and successor, kept Iraq in the headlines by saying parliament, not the Prime Minister, should decide on whether Britain goes to war. In an apparent attempt to reassure supporters disillusioned with Blair over Iraq, Brown told the Daily Telegraph newspaper the precedent set in 2003 to let MPs vote before the Iraq war should remain.

 At present the Prime Minister can use the royal prerogative to launch military action without parliamentary assent. ?Now that there has been a vote on these issues so clearly and in such controversial circumstances, I think it is unlikely that except in the most exceptional circumstances a government would choose not to have a vote in Parliament,? Brown said. Brown is more popular than Blair with traditional Labour supporters and he has played a prominent part in the campaign, appearing in a new show of friendship after months of tension.

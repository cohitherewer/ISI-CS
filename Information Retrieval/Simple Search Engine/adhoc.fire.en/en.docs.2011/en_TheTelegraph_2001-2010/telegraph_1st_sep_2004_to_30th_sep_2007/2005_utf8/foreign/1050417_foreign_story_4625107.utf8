 Reform or die, Rice tells UN

 Washington, April 16 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said yesterday the UN needed to be overhauled ?to survive as a vital force,? in the strongest criticism yet from a senior US official amid a debate on UN reform.

 Rice, who has chosen John Bolton, a longtime critic of the organisation, to be her UN ambassador, said Washington needed to lead changes to fix an institution dogged by scandals over corruption in the Iraq oil-for-food programme and sexual abuse by peacekeepers. ?It is no secret to anyone that the UN cannot survive as a vital force in international politics if it does not reform ? if it doesnt reform its organisations, if it doesn?t reform its secretariat, if it doesn?t reform its management practices,? she told a newspaper editors? conference.

 Last month, secretary-general Kofi Annan proposed the most wide-ranging overhaul of the UN since its creation in 1945. He recommended the expansion of the UN Security Council, a radical programme to combat poverty, a new human rights body and a condemnation of all forms of terrorism and a series of management and watchdog reforms. ?As important an institution as it is, one has to say that there are some things that are not so great about the UN right now. And everybody recognises that. And we?ve got to fix it,? Rice said.

 President George W. Bush has had strained relations with the UN. In his first term, he challenged it to avoid becoming irrelevant and ordered the invasion of Iraq without explicit UN approval before increasingly turning to the organisation for support after the war. Bolton, a hardline conservative who once said the US should only make the UN work to benefit American interests, has pledged to work to improve UN accountability.

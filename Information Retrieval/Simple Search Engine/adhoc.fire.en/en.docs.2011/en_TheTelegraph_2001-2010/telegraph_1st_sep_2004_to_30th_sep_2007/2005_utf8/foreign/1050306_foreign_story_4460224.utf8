 Fine Print

 Daring drive

 Berlin, March 5 (Reuters): An apparently friendly motorist in Germany stopped to tow a broken-down car, stranded the owners as he sped away, crashed their car into a gas station and then drove off, police said on Thursday.

 ?After attaching it, the man sped off so fast that the two hadn?t even got into the car ? and were left gesticulating wildly,? said police in Aachen. The man then drove toward the gas station, swerving his own car at the last minute.

 ?But the trailing vehicle went straight on and smashed into the air pump,? police said. ?The station attendant was roused by the noise and saw a man uncoupling his car from the battered vehicle before departing without further ado.?

 Love lost

 Singapore (Reuters): Singaporean couples may not be happy 

with their partners but they will still marry them anyway, a global survey on 

relationships shows. The poll of 716 couples who planned to wed showed that 39 

per cent were unhappy in their relationships, the highest proportion of nine societies 

surveyed by a US-based organisation. The poll is the latest unflattering survey 

of ardour in a wealthy population that chases what is known in local parlance 

as the Five Cs: career, condominium, club, credit cards and cars.

 Sick swear

 London (Reuters): ?Wanna be an anarchist?? At least one 

of the Sex Pistols, now middle-aged and a father of two, no longer does. Former 

Pistols Bassist Glen Matlock has called for swearing on television to be curbed, 

nearly 30 years after the provocative punk rockers sent shockwaves through Britain 

by using derivations of the dreaded ?f?-word on live TV. In 1976, the volley of 

abuse, chiefly from the punk bands Steve Jones, catapulted the group into 

a media firestorm that ended the career of TV interviewer Bill Grundy.

 Parties in U-turn over Maoist talks

 Kathmandu, Aug. 23 (Reuters): Nepals main political parties today said they were preparing to talk to Maoist rebels to plan joint protests against King Gyanendra, reversing an earlier decision to shun the guerrillas.

 The decision by the seven parties came after Maoist leader Prachanda agreed last month to key conditions set by them.

 Prachanda promised that the rebels would not target unarmed civilians and would stop extortion and he urged the parties to name negotiators for talks on a united campaign against the king.

 The parties will set up a team for meeting the Maoists in due course, Gopal Man Shrestha, chief of the third biggest group, the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party, said.

 Mobile phones

 Nepals government today allowed resumption of pre-paid cellular phone services that had been shut down since Gyanendra seized power. Government-run Nepal Telecom ? which has a mobile phone network monopoly in Nepal ? said service would resume today for prepaid subscribers.

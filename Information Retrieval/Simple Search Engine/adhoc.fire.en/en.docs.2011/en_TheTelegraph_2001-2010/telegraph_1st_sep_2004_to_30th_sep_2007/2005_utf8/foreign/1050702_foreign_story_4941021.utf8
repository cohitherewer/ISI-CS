 Pitt, Jolie snapped together in Britain

 New York, July 1 (AP): After months of avoiding being photographed together, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie appear in new photos published in People magazine.

 In the six pictures featured in the July 11 issue, Jolie stands in a field near her Buckinghamshire, England, estate while a shirtless and bleached-blond Pitt rides a dirt bike with her safety helmet-clad son Maddox. Other photos show Pitt, Jolie and 3-year-old Maddox at Luton airport outside London.

 Larry Hackett, Peoples deputy managing editor, wont disclose how much the magazine paid for the photos, obtained from a photographer in Britain. But he said yesterday that the price tag was under $1 million and there was no bidding war with competitors such as Us Weekly and Star magazines.

 I think theyre better photos than what have been out there of this couple, said Hackett. They represent news about this relationship. For better or worse, people are interested in this.

 For months, rumours have been circulating about the extent of Pitt and Jolies off-screen relationship. In April, photos published by Us Weekly of the couple with Maddox on a beach in Africa fuelled speculation about a possible romance, though Pitt and Jolie werent shown being affectionate with each other.

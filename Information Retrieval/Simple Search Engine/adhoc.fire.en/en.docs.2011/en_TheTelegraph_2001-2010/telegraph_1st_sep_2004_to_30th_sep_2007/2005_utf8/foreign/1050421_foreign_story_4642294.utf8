 Enthusiastic Blair admits popularity has waned

 London, April 20 (Reuters): Britain?s Tony Blair accepted today his popularity had waned since the heady days of 1997 but said his enthusiasm for the premiership had not, vowing again to serve a full third term if re-elected on May 5.

 Polls show Blair?s Centre-Left Labour party well ahead of its opponents, although Britons view the Prime Minister himself with little enthusiasm.

 In an interview with BBC television, Blair denied striking a succession pact with his finance minister Gordon Brown, who is impatiently waiting in the wings. ?I?ve said I?ll serve the full term and exactly what situation happens then and how you hand over, you can leave that to a later time... You don?t do deals about jobs like this.?

 A youthful-looking Blair swept to victory in 1997 on a wave of euphoria. 

 Eight years on, commentators say Blair looks fatigued in the wake of his decision to back the US-led conflict in Iraq and treatment to regulate his heart beat last year. Blair vehemently denied he had resorted to a fake tan to boost his appeal and said he was not weary of office.

 ?The irony of this job is that you are less popular as you go on but in some ways you are better equipped to do the job,? said a bronzed Blair.

 Asked if it had occurred to him to bow out, Blair said: ?Not at the moment, because I still think we?ve got things to do.?

 WTO activists clash with police

 Hong Kong , Dec. 17: Anti-World Trade Organisation activists clashed with the police today in a desperate attempt to break through the security cordon and disrupt the ongoing negotiations. 

 As many as 42 people, including eight policemen, were injured. 

 The police first used pepper spray and water cannons to drive back the protesters but they kept coming back. 

 Tear gas shells and batons were then used to drive back the protesters. The activists broke barricades and hurled ladders at the policemen, some of whom had to be carried off on stretchers. 

 As many as 900 activists have been rounded up for questioning and the police chief has not ruled out carrying out formal arrests of some of them. 

 Curfew was clamped in the area and the security secretary announced on TV that Hong Kong citizens should stay away from the area. 

 He advised all citizens to return to their homes as the police was going in for robust action to restore law and order in the Wan Chai area.

 Representatives of NGOs at the convention centre criticised WTO chief Pascal Lamys first draft saying that it did not contain anything for the poor countries. 

 Relief agency Oxfam rejected the draft saying it was not sufficient to deliver a pro-development outcome. 

 Another NGO said the US must come up with a concrete response on reducing subsidies on cotton as it had already lost the case at the WTO against Brazil. 

 Reuters adds: Police said they had not yet decided whether another large demonstration scheduled for tomorrow would be allowed to proceed.

 It was the worst street violence in Hong Kong since angry protests following the Chinese armys bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989.

 But the fighting was less intense than that which marred the last two big WTO conferences in Cancun, Mexico, and Seattle. A South Korean farmer stabbed himself to death in Cancun during a WTO meeting in 2003.

 Police fired numerous volleys of tear gas in the area near the building, Reuters correspondents said, and television showed officers bringing up what appeared to be armoured vehicles.

 Inside the convention centre, journalists, delegates and policemen crowded round TV monitors watching the brawls outside. 

 European and Japanese delegates were taken to the harbour front centre by boat for late-night meetings as fighting raged.

 Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997. Lee said police had not asked the local Chinese army garrison for help and Chinas state media were silent on the protests.

 Fine Print

 Nicole?s top thrill

 London, April 26 (Reuters): For the second week running, Nicole Kidman?s The Interpreter was top of the British film box office chart, according to Screen International.

 Director Sydney Pollack?s latest offering grossed over ?1.2 million over the weekend, only slightly down from the ?1.6 million the previous weekend.

 Scary movie Amityville Horror retained its momentum in second place bringing in over ?885,000. This week?s top debutant, romantic comedy The Wedding Date, directed by Clare Kilner, was third and Guess Who fourth. 

 Sahara continued its slide down the charts to fifth place and Valiant was sixth. Will Smith?s Hitch came in at seventh position, just ahead of Robots and John Travolta?s Be Cool. Rounding out the top 10 was new Indian film Waqt.

 Lunch stunt

 Rome (Reuters): Who says there are no 

 free lunches? A restaurant owner called the police on Monday 

 after a smartly-dressed customer got up and calmly said 

 he didn?t have any money to pay the bill. Identity checks 

 showed that 96 complaints had been filed against the man 

 for pulling that same stunt across Italy.

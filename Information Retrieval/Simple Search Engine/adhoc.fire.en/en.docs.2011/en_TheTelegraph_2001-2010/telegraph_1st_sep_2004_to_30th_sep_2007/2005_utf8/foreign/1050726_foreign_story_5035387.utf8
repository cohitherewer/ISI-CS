 Saudi most wanted arrested in Medina

 Riyadh, July 25 (Reuters): Saudi security forces arrested one of the countrys most wanted militant suspects in the holy city of Medina today, the interior ministry said.

 It said Mohammad bin Saeed al-Amri was detained after security forces managed to seize a pipe bomb from him. Amri, 25, was arrested along with two other suspects, the ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.

 Saudi Arabia has been battling a two-year wave of violence by supporters of Saudi-born Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network who are trying to expel westerners from the worlds biggest oil exporter and destabilise the pro-western ruling family.

 Many top militants have been killed or captured and the pace of attacks has slowed, but western diplomats say the threat remains.

 Last Wednesday, the US embassy in Riyadh warned American citizens that militants were planning further attacks and the interior ministry said security forces uncovered an arms cache south of Riyadh. The US embassy today imposed a travel ban on its military personnel in the kingdom in response to what it said were continued signs that militants could be preparing attacks.

 Last month the Interior Ministry released a list of 36 wanted suspects, including Amri, and offered rewards of up to 7 million riyals ($1.87 million) to anyone who helps foil a planned attack or track down one of the men. A security source said Amri, who was seized after a group of Saudi citizensbecame suspicious and contacted authorities, was not believed to be one of the most dangerous militants.

 Another man on the wanted list was killed in a fierce gun battle in Riyadh three weeks ago. Authorities say two others are in custody ? one in Saudi Arabia and another in Yemen ? while security sources say three or four may have been killed or captured in neighbouring Iraq.

 Militants have killed 91 foreign nationals and Saudi civilians in the last two years and caused more than 1 billion riyals ($270 million) of damage in a campaign of bombings, shootings and kidnappings.

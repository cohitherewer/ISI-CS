 Nepal factory bombed

 Kathmandu, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Dozens of heavily armed Maoist rebels stormed and bombed a textile factory in southern Nepal but no one was hurt in the attack on one of the impoverished nations biggest plants, police said today.

 The attack on Jyoti Spinning Mills Ltds plant at Parwanipur, 150 km south of Kathmandu, came late yesterday when guerrillas overpowered a guard and set off the bomb, a police officer said. Fire fighters were rushed to the plant. They are still fighting the blaze caused by the blast, the officer said.

 No one has claimed responsibility but police blamed the rebels fighting to overthrow the monarchy and install a communist republic. Nepali investors including the junior finance minister in the Himalayan kingdoms royalist government own the firm.

 It was not clear why the factory was bombed.

 Yesterday, consumer goods maker Unilever Nepal, owned 80 per cent by Hindustan Lever, said it had shut its plant following a threat from rebels.

 The nine-year insurgency has scared investors forcing many industries to close.

 More than 12,500 people have died in the Maoist revolt in the impoverished nation.

 The army said today Nepali soldiers had recovered the bodies of 12 colleagues killed in a deadly gunbattle with rebels earlier this month pushing the militarys death toll in the clash to 55.

 An army officer said the bodies were found in the mountains in Kalikot district, a Maoist stronghold 600 km west of Kathmandu, where the fighting took place on August 7-8. At least 26 rebels also died in the overnight battle.

 The clash in the Himalayan kingdom caused the highest number of military fatalities in the past year and came six months after King Gyanendra sacked the countrys coalition government and seized power in order to crush the Maoist revolt. The army said 64 other soldiers were still missing.

 The Maoists have said they had captured 60 troops as well as a huge cache of weapons from dead soldiers in the battle. The army said it would not comment on the Maoist claim or on the fate of the missing troops.

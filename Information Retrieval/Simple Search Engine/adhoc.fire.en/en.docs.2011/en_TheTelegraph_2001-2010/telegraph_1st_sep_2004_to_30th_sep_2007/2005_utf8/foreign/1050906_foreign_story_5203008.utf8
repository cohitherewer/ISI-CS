 Suicide hoax puts lover in jail

 Karachi, Sept. 5 (Reuters): A love-struck Pakistani faces up to three years in jail for falsely accusing a brother and a cousin of the woman he hoped to marry of planning a suicide attack on the US consulate in Karachi, police said today.

 Jobless labourer Mohammad Imran sparked a security scare when he made the allegations in a telephone call to the US embassy in Islamabad last month after the relatives ordered him not to see or speak to his would-be bride, police said.

 Investigating officer Sadaullah Bangash said Imran, 22, had told police he got the idea after news of a spate of arrests of militant suspects in Pakistan after the July 7 London bombings. 

 Bangash said police had questioned the relatives, who appeared to be ordinary people with no connection to terrorism. Imran is due in court in Karachi on Wednesday and faces up to three years jail if convicted of making false accusations, he said.

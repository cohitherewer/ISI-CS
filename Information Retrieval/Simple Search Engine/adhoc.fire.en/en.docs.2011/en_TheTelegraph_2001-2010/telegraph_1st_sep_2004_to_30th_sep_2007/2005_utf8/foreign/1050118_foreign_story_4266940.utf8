 Tourist warning to Thailand

 Phuket (Thailand), Jan. 17 (Reuters): Nordic countries that suffered hundreds of deaths in the Indian Ocean tsunami urged Thailand today to complete a probe into why no warning was given, saying tourists would not return without an answer.

 Three weeks after the disaster, Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian Prime Ministers visiting devastated Thai resorts also said Thailand had promised to keep searching for bodies. Thailand launched an investigation within days of the tsunami, which killed more than 5,300 people in the country ? half of them foreign tourists ? but no date has been set for a report.

 ?We want to see an investigation about the warning of the catastrophe,? Sweden?s Goran Persson said in Phuket.

 ?The earthquake came a long time before the tsunami,? he said. ?Why wasn?t there a warning? Who was responsible for that? Thai Prime Minister Dr Thaksin has said they had opened an investigation and I welcome that.?

 Most of Thailand?s deaths were on devastated Khao Lak beach, two hours drive north of Phuket and particularly popular with northern Europeans. Nearly 2,000 Swedes, about 90 Norwegian and 175 Finnish tourists are among the dead and missing.

 Persson said Indian Ocean countries needed to put up a tsunami warning system quickly and reconstruct hotels with high safety standards if they wanted tourists to return. The Nordic Prime Ministers flew over Khao Lak by helicopter before meeting Thaksin at a nearby town and said they had been assured the search for bodies would continue. 

 Lanka toll raised

 Sri Lankan officials raised the death toll from last month?s tsunami disaster by more than 7,000 to 38,195 today and said they were still pulling bodies from the rubble every day. Sri Lanka?s body count had largely stabilised around 30,000. But an official said they now expected the toll to top 40,000.

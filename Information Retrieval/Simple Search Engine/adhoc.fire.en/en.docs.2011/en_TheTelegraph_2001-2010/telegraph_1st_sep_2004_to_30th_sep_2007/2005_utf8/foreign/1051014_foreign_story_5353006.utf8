 Iraq prepares to seal borders

 Baghdad, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Iraq prepared to seal itself off from the outside world today and clamp down on movement around the country to ward off threats from insurgents bent on wrecking a referendum on a new constitution.

 Aside from the armed conflict, a US-brokered deal to defuse Sunni political opposition achieved at least a split in the No camp by winning endorsements for the charter from some ? in return for a pledge to consider amendments after the vote.

 At least seven people, including several policemen, were killed in attacks across the country but, as in Januarys vote for the interim parliament, tight security seemed to be working.

 Shias and Kurds ? some three quarters of the 15 million voters ? are likely to ensure a Yes majority nationwide, but a two thirds No vote in three of 18 provinces would veto it. Interior minister Bayan Jabor said frontiers would be closed from midnight until Sunday. 

 Al Qaida letter

 Al Qaidas wing in Iraq rejected as a fabrication a letter by a top group leader that was issued by US officials and suggested deep internal rifts among militants. The letter, said to be from Ayman al-Zawahri, warns Abu Musab al-Zarqawi that brutal tactics risked alienating Muslims at a time when al Qaida should be seeking support for a religious state.

 Oscar has not led to roles: Berry

Los Angeles, Jan. 24 (AP): Winning the Academy 

Award doesn?t mean you?re suddenly bombarded with offers for great movie roles, 

says Halle Berry.

 The best thing to happen to her in the week after winning the best actress award was a phone call from Oprah Winfrey, asking her to play a part in Their Eyes Were Watching God. The movie, a Winfrey production, appears on ABC, an American television network, this spring.

 ?The struggle for a woman of colour to find good material is still very present, and it?s a struggle I fight every day,? Berry said yesterday. ?I think women have a hard time finding good material, in general, be you black, white or sky blue, pink.?

 Developing her own projects or personally acquiring the movie rights to books she likes is probably the best way to develop these roles. Berry said she has four in the works right now. ?I just sort of sift through the other stuff that comes my way and try to make the best out of what comes to me, but it?s going to be about making my own reality, really,? she said. 

 Halle Berry won the best actress Oscar in 2002 for her starring role in the drama Monster?s Ball.

 Commons visit twist

 PAUL STOKES

 London, July 16: One of the suicide bombers visited the Houses of Parliament a year ago as a guest of an MP whose family had known him for 17 years.

 Mohammed Sadique Khan was among a party of staff and pupils who travelled from Yorkshire to meet Jon Trickett, a Labour MP. They were shown around the Palace of Westminster and treated to sandwiches in Portcullis House, a new extension where many members and some ministers have their offices.

 Khan was working as a learning mentor at Hillside Primary School, Leeds, where Tricketts wife, Sarah, is head teacher. He had known the Trickett family since the late 1980s and visited their home, having been in the same year group as their son at Matthew Murray School, Holbeck.

 Sarah Trickett and Khan accompanied pupils on the trip to London, during which they went to the London Eye and St Jamess Park.

 Border bother plagues Bush

 Bush: Hard line

 Washington, Dec. 4 (Reuters): President George W. Bush has said illegal border crossings were adding to cri-me and placing burdens on border communities, pushing his plan to overhaul immigration policy as a poll suggested Americans are sceptical of his handling of the issue.

 Bush, in a visit this week to the border states of Arizona and Texas, promised to provide more manpower and high-tech equipment such as unmanned flying drones to bolster border patrols.

 Reflecting a desire among many conservative Republicans for a harder line against illegal crossings, Bush used his weekly radio address to repeat a promise to promptly return all illegal immigrants.

 He also said he would push for changes to US laws, such as one requiring the release of immigrants if their home countries do not take them back within a set period of time.

 In communities near our border, illegal immigration strains the resources of schools, hospitals and law enforcement, Bush said.

 And it involves smugglers and gangs that bring crime to our neighbourhoods. Faced with this serious challenge, our governments responsibility is clear. Were going to protect our borders, he added.

 A Time magazine poll showed just over one in four Americans approved of his handling of the immigration issue. 

 It also showed more Republicans than Democrats view immigration as a serious concern.

 Seventy-four per cent said the US was not doing enough to secure its borders. 

 However, 72 per cent said they favoured Bushs idea of a guest worker programme to allow immigrants to work temporarily in the US.

 Scapegoats for poll

 US Democratic Party chief Howard Dean has predicted that Republicans would make illegal immigrants their new scapegoats during the 2006 elections, and said splintered Democrats were starting to find common ground on the Iraq war.

 At a Democratic National Committee meeting, Dean criticised the Republican emphasis on illegal immigration and ridiculed Bushs recent tough talk about stronger enforcement of border security.

 He said Republicans exploited the topic of gay marriage in the 2004 elections with a series of state referendums, and were at it again with another hot-button social issue in immigration.

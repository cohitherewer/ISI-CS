 China bird flu culling 

 Beijing, Nov. 6 (Reuters): All poultry in a northeastern part of China hit by the countrys latest bird flu outbreak are expected to be culled tonight as the government steps up measures to stop the diseases spread. 

 Some 1,700 officials, backed by armed police, have been sent to the affected county in Liaoning province to slaughter the birds, the official Xinhua news agency said. Up to a million birds would be culled. 

 Flight to Iran 

 Tehran (Reuters): The first Iraqi passenger flight for 25 years landed in Tehran on Sunday. The Iraqi Airways Boeing 737 is the latest harbinger of rapprochement between the neighbours who fought a war of attrition from 1980 to 1988 which killed hundreds of thousands on both sides. Iraqi Airways is planning to fly scheduled flights to Iran on Wednesdays and Fridays from November 16, sources said. 

 Gaza passage 

 Jerusalem (Reuters): Israels cabinet has postponed a vote to approve a border crossing for Palestinians between Gaza and Egypt because of disagreement over the role of European Union security monitors. Israel, which quit the Gaza Strip in September after 38 years of occupation, had accepted an Egyptian proposal to let Palestinians travel freely via the Rafah terminal, but with foreign oversight ? a role to be filled by the EU monitors.

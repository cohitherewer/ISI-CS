 Hanks chases Deep Throat

 Hanks: Felt attraction

 Washington, June 16: Deep Throat has a book deal and a movie deal, and he could end up being played by Tom Hanks.

 The family of 91-year-old W. Mark Felt, who revealed his role as The Washington Posts key Watergate source two weeks ago, has chosen PublicAffairs Books to publish a combination of autobiography and biography, publisher and CEO Peter Osnos said last night. 

 Osnos said that Universal Pictures has targeted Felts life story and the book for a movie to be developed by Hankss production company, Playtone.

 He said the book will blend Felts own writing about his life, including his out-of-print 1979 memoir, The FBI Pyramid: From the Inside, and some unpublished material, with contributions from Felts family and from lawyer John D. Connor, who has been advising the Felts. Connor wrote the Vanity Fair article that named Felt as Deep Throat.

 The additional material from Felt, Osnos said, includes discussion of how he decided to provide guidance to Post reporter Bob Woodward, and why. The book is to be published next spring. Its working title is A G-Mans Life: The FBI, Being Deep Throat and the Struggle for Honor in Washington.

 David Kuhn, the New York-based agent who has been representing the family, said last night: Hankss company was interested in the rights to the story within a day or two of the revelation of Deep Throats identity. 

 Kuhn would not comment on the sums paid in either the book or the movie deal, except to say that the familys decision on the book was not based on money but rather on the vision for its publication put forth by Osnos, a former reporter.

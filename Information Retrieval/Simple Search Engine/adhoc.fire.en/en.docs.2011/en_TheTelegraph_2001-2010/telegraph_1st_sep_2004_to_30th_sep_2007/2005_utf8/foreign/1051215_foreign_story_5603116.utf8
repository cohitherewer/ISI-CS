 Author paints a US-grown terrorist

 Updike: Pen for a rebel

 Boston, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Updikes next project is bound to stir controversy ? not just in literary circles.

 Titled Terrorist, his next novel confronts the emotional issue of changes in America after the September 11, 2001, attacks with a culturally charged twist: Updikes terrorist is a US teenager given a sympathetic treatment.

 The threat is not anonymous, foreign born or groomed overseas by Osama bin Laden. He is an 18-year-old American-born son of an Irish mother and Egyptian father who finds Islam at a small urban American high school.

 Its my attempt, in a way, to cope with todays world, Updike said, referring to the novel which he expects to be published in June. Terrorism is one of our themes that has changed the texture of American life in a noticeable way. And of course it makes you fearful because you think well Im not a terrorist but somebody could be.

 At one point, Updike considered another title, Land of Fear. But it had been already taken and Terrorist was more arresting, he said. Some scenes are set in Washington with a fictional cabinet but he is careful not to give away the plot.

 I thought my take on it would be different from anybody elses ? trying to understand it from the terrorists point of view and make him a sympathetic character.

 The novel is the latest work by one of Americas most prolific authors who, at 73, says his view of himself as a writer has changed as he produces an increasing volume of art and literary criticism and struggles with the short-story medium.

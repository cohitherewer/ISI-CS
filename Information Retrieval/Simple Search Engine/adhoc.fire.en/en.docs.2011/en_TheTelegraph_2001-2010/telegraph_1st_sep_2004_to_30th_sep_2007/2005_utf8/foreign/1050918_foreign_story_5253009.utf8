 Beer-lovers vow to vote after night of excess

 Munich, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Legions of thirsty beer-lovers flooded Munich for the start of its world-famous Oktoberfest today, bent on bacchanalian excess but vowing to stagger to the polling booths for tomorrows elections.

 Germans face the sober task of choosing a political leader to tackle the countrys mass unemployment and feeble economic growth, which studies say have left them feeling poorer, angst-ridden, and pessimistic about the future.

 But those concerns along with the gloomy skies and drizzle were cast aside today as Germans and thousands of visitors alike donned traditional dress and embraced German culture at its cliched, hedonistic best.

 I have been coming here since I was little, it is just fantastic, said 20-year-old Sonja Maruhn from Munich, wearing a cheerful pink dirndl and rustic Edelweiss flower necklace. Ill stay right to the end at 11, but Im definitely voting tomorrow morning ? or more likely afternoon. The polling station is only staggering distance away.

 Munich mayor Christian Ude got the 172nd festival underway at noon by cracking open the first 200 litre keg to raucous cheers with the traditional shout zapft is! ?the cask is is tapped. The origins of the Oktoberfest date back to 1810 when a celebration was held all over Munich to mark the wedding of Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig.

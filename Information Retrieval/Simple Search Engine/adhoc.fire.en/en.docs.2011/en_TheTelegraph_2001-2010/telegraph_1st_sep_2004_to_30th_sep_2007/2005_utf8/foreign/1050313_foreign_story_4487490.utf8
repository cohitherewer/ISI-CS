 Atlanta judge killer nabbed

 Atlanta, March 12 (Reuters): The suspect in the shooting deaths of a Georgia judge and two other people was taken into custody today after a standoff, Atlanta police said.

 Brian Nichols, 33, was apprehended north of Atlanta in Gwinnett county, police said. ?He is in custody,? said Sergeant Terry Joyner of the Atlanta police department.

 Hundreds of police had fanned out in a search across Georgia and neighbouring southeastern states after the 9 am (local time) shooting yesterday at the Fulton county courthouse.

 Atlanta police said the suspect grabbed a gun from a sheriff?s deputy and opened fire in the chambers of judge Rowland Barnes. The superior court judge and a court stenographer were killed on the spot and a sheriff?s deputy was fatally shot outside the courthouse.

 Today, city police were investigating the fatal shooting of a US customs agent found dead several miles north of where the courthouse killings occurred. ?We?re not sure if it?s related or unrelated at this time,? said Joyner. But CNN quoted the head of the state bureau of investigation today as saying the death of the customs agent was likely tied to the Nichols case.

 ?They only call me when they know it is connected,? said Georgia Bureau of Investigation director Vernon Keenan. Police chief Richard Pennington said today Nichols had taken a second gun before entering the courtroom.

 ?We think right after he took the first deputy?s weapon, he got engaged with another deputy and we believe that he took that person?s weapon, too,? Pennington told CNN. ?He?s in possession of two weapons.?

 Outside the court building yesterday, Nichols assaulted a journalist and carjacked several vehicles in quick succession, according to police and witness reports. However, it remains unclear whether the suspect escaped on foot or in a car. The deputy who lost her gun was in critical condition but expected to survive, police said.

 Today, television reports showed video from a security surveillance camera shortly after the shooting in which a man resembling Nichols walks calmly down the stairwell of a nearby parking lot where one of the hijacked cars was found. The bald man wore a black jacket over his bare chest.

 Nichols was being retried on rape and other charges involving an ex-girlfriend and faced a possible life sentence if convicted.

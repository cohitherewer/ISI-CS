 Beckhams to sue ex-nanny

 London, April 26 (Reuters): England soccer captain David Beckham and his wife Victoria are to sue their ex-nanny over allegations about the state of their marriage made in a British tabloid newspaper, their spokesman said today.

 The Real Madrid midfielder and his wife, who live in Madrid, took the decision after failing at the weekend to win a court order banning the News of the World from publishing an interview with former nanny Abbie Gibson, 27.

 ?The Beckhams will be commencing legal proceedings against their former nanny, Abbie Gibson, for breach of confidence,? the spokesman said.

 ?They will also be applying to the courts to amend their outstanding action commenced last year against the News of the World to include all of these issues by way of seeking aggravated damages,? he added.

 The Beckham?s relationship came under close scrutiny last year following tabloid allegations that Beckham had had an affair with his personal assistant Rebecca Loos ? a claim Beckham dismissed as ?ludicrous.? Beckham joined Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2003 to become one of the world?s highest paid football players. In February, Victoria gave birth to the couple?s third son, Cruz.

 Hawks in Quran rallies

 Islamabad, May 27 (Reuters): Thousands of Islamic activists rallied across Pakistan today to protest against alleged desecration of the Quran by US forces at Guantanamo Bay detention centre in Cuba.

 The rallies, called by hardline Islamic groups opposed to Pakistans support for the US-led war on terrorism, came hours after a deadly bomb blast at the Bari Imam shrine in Islamabad that killed at least 19 people and wounded dozens of others.

 We condemn sacrilege of the Quran by the US extremists, said a banner held by women protesters at a rally in Islamabad attended by about 5,000 people in front of the parliament building about 1 km from the scene of the blast.

 Protesters in Quetta burned effigies of President George W. Bush and his key allies in the war on terrorism ? President Pervez Musharraf and President Hamid Karzai.

 Yesterday, Brigadier General Jay Hood, commander of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, told a Pentagon briefing that no credible evidence had been found that a Quran had been flushed down a toilet but said US military had identified five incidents of mishandling of a Quran at the prison. He refused to specify the nature of the mishandling.

 Protests also took place today in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. America, listen, listen, with my blood I will protect my Quran, shouted thousands of Lebanese at a Hizbollah rally in a Shia suburb of Beirut.America is the enemy of Muslims.

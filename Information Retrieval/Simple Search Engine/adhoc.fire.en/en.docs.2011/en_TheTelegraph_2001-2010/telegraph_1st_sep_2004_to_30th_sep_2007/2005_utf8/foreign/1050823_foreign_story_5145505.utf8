 Bangla cleric held as manhunt intensifies

 Dhaka, Aug. 22 (PTI): Bangladesh today arrested a former chief of the state-owned Islamic foundation in connection with the serial blasts even as investigators stepped up a nation-wide manhunt for the two main suspects of the attack.

 The arrest of Maulana Fariduddin Masood, a former director general of the foundation, came as investigators tried to decipher a telephone conversation in Arabic mixed with Bangla to find valuable clues regarding the blasts.

 The elite Rapid Action Battalion of the Bangladesh police arrested Masood from the Zia International Airport here when he was about to board a plane for London, media reports said.

 The police suspect that Masood might have links with the Jammat ul-Mujahideen group suspected of being involved in the August 17 serial blasts, which killed two people and injured several others.

 The police said they have stepped up their hunt for Aheikh Abdur Rahman, the suspected mastermind, and Siddiq ur-Rahman alias Bangla Bhai.

 So far over 130 people have been arrested and many of them have confessed that they were members of the banned outfit and Abdur Rahman was their leader. 

 The police are keeping a close watch on Abdur Rahmans madarsa in Jamalpur. Although some intelligence officers believe the two are hiding abroad, they continue to look for them in the country.

 A list of 400 members of the banned party has also been distributed among the police, the Rapid Action Battalion and intelligence agencies in all districts.

 Foreign minister Morshed Khan said Bangladesh will not hesitate to seek foreign assistance to probe the bomb blasts.

 The government will not hesitate to take foreign intelligence help, if needed, to unearth the incident, Khan said yesterday. 

 Asked if he admitted the failure of the countrys intelligence agencies, he said: I cannot say they were successful.

 Investigators are also trying to decipher a telephone conversation in Arabic mixed with Bangla tapped on Saturday for any possible clues.

 In the conversation two men were talking in Arabic interspersed with Bangla which seems pretty suspicious, intelligence sources told the Daily Star.

 White tide streams through Edinburgh

 Edinburgh, July 2 (Reuters): A tide of some 200,000 people dressed in white streamed through Edinburgh today to demand that leaders of rich nations agree measures to attack global poverty at a summit near the Scottish capital next week.

 As part of a day of pressure on the Group of Eight nations, including the Live 8 rock concerts, the marchers urged rich states to double aid to poor countries, especially in Africa. They also called for debt relief and trade reform.

 The marchers, wearing the colour of the Make Poverty History movement ? a coalition of charities, churches and other groups ? flooded the city for five hours to form a human version of the campaigns white band symbol.

 This has delivered a historic moment. Ordinary people have come and expressed clearly what they want, Matt Phillips of the Save the Children charity said. There is no misunderstanding the message ? end poverty and end injustice.

 Police and organisers estimated the number of demonstrators at 200,000, making the march one of the biggest in Scottish history.

 Men, women and children from all corners of Europe flocked to Edinburgh to demand that the heads of the worlds richest nations end the triple scourge of debt, disease and poverty.

 I am reassured that there are so many people who really care about what I care about, said teacher Caroline Neil from the county of Yorkshire.

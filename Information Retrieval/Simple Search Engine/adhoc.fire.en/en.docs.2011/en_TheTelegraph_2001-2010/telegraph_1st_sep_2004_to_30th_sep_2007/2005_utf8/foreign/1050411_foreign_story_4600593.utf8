 HK leader

 Beijing, April 10 (Reuters): China?s cabinet today ordered the country?s top parliamentary body to rule on how long Hong Kong?s next leader will serve.

 Hong Kong?s government last week asked China?s parliament to interpret the city?s constitution to clarify whether the next chief executive will only serve the remainder of the term of Tung Chee-hwa, who quit last month with two years left in his term. 

 The constitution has no provision on how to replace a leader who quits before his five-year term is up. Beijing is said to favour a two-year term so it can test the loyalties of acting chief executive Donald Tsang.

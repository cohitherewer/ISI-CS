 Schroeder signals retreat

 Berlin, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder today signalled he may be ready to relinquish power two weeks after Germanys most inconclusive post-war election, saying he would accept any decision his party takes.

 For the first time since his Social Democrats (SPD) finished second to Angela Merkels conservatives in the September 18 election that produced a hung parliament, Schroeder said he would not stand in the way if a stable government could be formed by the two main parties.

 The Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), won 226 parliament seats to 222 for the SPD, leaving each side and its allies short of a majority. The two rivals have been edging towards a grand coalition.

 Schroeder said today that he was fighting to stay in the chancellery on behalf of the SPD and its Centre-Left policies ? and not for his own personal ambitions.

 It is not about my claim and definitely not about me, Schroeder said. It is about the political leadership claim of my party and that can only be decided by the partys executive.

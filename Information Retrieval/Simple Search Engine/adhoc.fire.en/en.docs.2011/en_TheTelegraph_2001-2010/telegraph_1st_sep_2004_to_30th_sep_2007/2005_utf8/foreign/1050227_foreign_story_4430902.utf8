 Zarqawi hunt

 Haditha (Iraq), Feb. 26 (Reuters): US and Iraqi troops swept into towns along the Euphrates river valley today in a push to flush out insurgents, and the government said it was closing in on al Qaidas leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

 As politicians haggled in Baghdad over who will get which posts in the new government, Marines and Iraqi soldiers fought militants in the towns of Haditha and Ramadi, capital of the vast and often lawless western province of Anbar.

 Some intelligence reports have suggested Jordanian militant Zarqawi, who has a $25 million US bounty on his head, has been hiding in the Haditha area. The Iraqi government said it had captured one of his senior aides.

 Afghan, US troops raid Taliban hideouts

 Kandahar, June 22 (Reuters): Afghan and US troops backed by warplanes blasted Taliban hideouts for a second day today, killing scores of militants in some of the bloodiest fighting in years, officials said.

 Kandahars deputy police chief, General Salim Khan, leading about 400 police troops, said by satellite telephone from the scene that at least 64 Taliban fighters had been killed since yesterday and 30 captured.

 Two Afghan soldiers died and six US soldiers were wounded in the operation where Kandahar, Zabul and Uruzgan provinces meet, aimed at checking a surge in violence ahead of September 18 parliamentary elections, Afghan and US officials said.

 This is the heaviest bombing and fighting I have seen since the fall of the Taliban, Khan said, referring to the overthrow of the Taliban government in late 2001 by US-led forces. Hundreds of people have died in a surge in militant violence in recent months, raising concerns about the elections.

 Pak assurance

 Pakistan has assured Afghanistan of its support in maintaining security after angry words between the neighbours over accusations Pakistan is not doing enough to stop Taliban violence.

 Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf telephoned Afghan President Hamid Karzai yesterday after a 15-minute conversation between the Pakistani leader and President George W. Bush. President Musharraf assured President Karzai of Pakistans continued support and cooperation in the fight against terrorism, the Afghan government said in a release today.

 Typhoon hits China province

 Beijing, Sept. 11 (Reuters): A typhoon hit a sprawling city in prosperous eastern China today after nearly a million villagers and farmers had been evacuated from their flimsy coastal and hillside huts to safety.

 Typhoon Khanun, which spared the island of Taiwan yesterday after forecasts of a near direct hit, made landfall in Chinas mountainous Zhejiang province, where storms regularly trigger fatal floods and landslides.

 The new city of Taizhou, with a population of over five million, took the full brunt, a government official said, adding that those evacuated by the army had been taken to schools, railway stations, hotels and other solid buildings for protection.

 Signboards have been blown down and definitely trees will be uprooted and houses damaged, the official said, adding that 330,000 people had been moved to safety in Taizhou alone. 

 Its too early to talk about damage to property.

 Khanun had a radius of 400 km and was moving northwest at about 25 to 30 km per hour, prompting an official to predict the storm could cause more havoc than Typhoon Matsa which swept through Chinas east coast in August, killing three people and forcing more than a million to flee their homes.

 Details of damage and casualties are not expected until tomorrow.

 Xinhua said Zhejiang had so far evacuated 814,267 people to safer places. About 35,400 ships and other vessels had returned to port.

 The ancient trade port of Ningbo was directly in the path of the storm, which was unleashing maximum sustained winds of up to 177 km per hour, according to a typhoon tracker website.

 The storm had dropped to a category two after the eye crossed the coast, down from category four, with five being the strongest.

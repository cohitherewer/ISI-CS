 Islamabad, May 5 (Reuters): Pakistani security forces have rounded up about two dozen al Qaida suspects after arresting a man President George W. Bush called ?a top general? of Osama bin Laden, intelligence officials said today.

 They said Abu Faraj Farj al Liby, who US counter-terrorism agents say became al Qaidas third most important figure two years ago, could provide clues to the whereabouts of bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri.

 Pakistan says Liby was the ringleader of at least two assassination attempts against President Pervez Musharraf in December 2003.

 Al Libys capture was announced late yesterday and he has been brought to Rawalpindi for questioning. 

 ?Raids are being carried out in several cities after his interrogation,? a Pakistani intelligence official said. 

 US security officials said they had supplied information that helped track Liby down, but the White House emphasised that Pakistan took the lead in the arrest.

 There were varying versions of when and where Liby was run to ground, but the most detailed account was given by a policeman in North West Frontier Province and several intelligence sources.

 Liby was caught along with four comrades on Monday morning, said Amanullah Khan, deputy superintendent of police in Mardan, a town 110 km northwest of Islamabad.

 And after catching Liby, security forces closed the net on other suspects with several raids elsewhere in the country. 

 They also recaptured a man sentenced to death for his role in one of Libys plots to kill Musharraf.

 Mushtaq Ahmed was caught on the road from Lahore to Islamabad earlier this week, a senior security official said today. He had escaped last December with embarrassing ease from the air force base in Rawalpindi last December.

 The official said the timing of Ahmeds recapture was a coincidence, unrelated to operations surrounding Libys arrest.

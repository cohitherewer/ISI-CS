 Aggrieved Aniston

 Aniston: Upset

 New York, Nov. 7 (AP): Jennifer Aniston says shes been wrongly pegged as a crier since splitting with Brad Pitt.

 Aniston reportedly broke down during an interview for the September issue of Vanity Fair. I was upset about the Vanity Fair article. I had one moment when I got emotional because I hadnt sat down with an interviewer since this whole debacle took place, Aniston told Newsweek magazine. It happened for a second and then it was over.

 The 36-year-old actor has said the media coverage and tabloid rumours were hard to deal with ? especially reports that she didnt want to start a family. Her divorce from Brad Pitt became final on October 2 concluding four and a half years of marriage.

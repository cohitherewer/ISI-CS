 Aid flights trickle into island

 Nias Island (Indonesia), March 29 (Reuters): Aid flights today began reaching Indonesia?s Nias island, where more than 1,000 people are believed dead after a massive earthquake.

 Bad weather, a damaged airport and heavy cloud cover kept many flights from landing, but in the afternoon there were reports of at least three planes arriving on the island, where hundreds of buildings collapsed in the quake.

 A small plane from Medan carrying journalists and aid workers landed at the devastated island this afternoon.

 Much of the island looked serene from the air, with palm trees and white sandy beaches that showed no signs of damage from the earthquake. But there were also dozens of collapsed houses.

 US to cut Iraq troops in 2006

 Baghdad, July 27 (Reuters): The US hopes to sharply reduce its forces in Iraq by the middle of next year if all goes according to plan, its top commander on the ground said today.

 At a briefing with visiting defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, General George Casey said he expected troop cuts after a referendum on a new constitution due in October and an election for a new leader in December.

 I do believe that if the political process continues to go positively, if the developments with the (Iraqi) security forces continue to go as it is going, I do believe we will still be able to make fairly substantial reductions after these elections ? in the spring and summer of next year, he said.

 It appeared to be the first time since the insurgency worsened in April that top Pentagon officials have suggested a timeline for withdrawal.

 Caseys remarks came as a new poll showed most Americans think the US will lose the war in Iraq. Early this year Casey made a similar prediction, but US officials have avoided suggesting a timetable since violence worsened sharply after the new government took power in April.

 Hours later a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to a Baghdad hospital, killing at least five people and wounding 10, police sources said.

 Although many Iraqis resent the presence of US troops, they fear an escalation in suicide bombings, shootings and kidnappings, and possibly civil war, if the Americans pull out before Iraqi forces can stand up to the Sunni-led insurgency.

 A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published in USA Today said 32 per cent of respondents believed the US could not win the war in Iraq. Another 21 per cent said it was possible the US could win but they did not believe it would.

 Just 43 percent said they were confident of victory.

 Refugees: Uzbek dead in thousands

 Kara-Suu (Kyrgyzstan), May 17: Refugees who fled from the massacre committed by Uzbek security forces agreed on one thing yesterday: the number of dead is not 500 ? the most common reported figure ? but could be in the thousands.

 As reports continued to come in of clashes spreading outside the town of Andizhan, a sergeant in charge of the bridge at the border village of Kara-Suu said he believed that 2,000 had been massacred during three days.

 There is no way to confirm numbers offered by refugees, but it seemed likely that when the truth emerges, the massacre in Uzbekistan, an American ally in the fight against terrorism, could become the deadliest assault on civilians since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

 The Uzbek-Kyrgyz border at Kara-Suu was open periodically yesterday under the watchful eye of Kyrgyz soldiers armed with machineguns.

 The US, hardening its line on its ally, said today it was deeply disturbed by reports that soldiers fired on protesters. An Uzbek Opposition party said it had compiled a list of 745 people killed. Uzbekistans prosecutor general said the toll was 169.

 Kara-Suu, which is divided between the two former Soviet republics, was tense as traders hurried goods between the two sides of town, divided by a fast flowing river straddled by a makeshift metal bridge.

 A few refugees from Andizhan remained in the town staying close to their Kyrgyz relatives and homes. Apart from the 500 believed dead in Andizhan on Friday, there were reports of further deaths in nearby areas.

 Saidjahon Zaynabitdinov, the head of the local Appeal human rights group, said yesterday that government troops had killed about 200 demonstrators on Saturday in Pakhtabad, about 18 miles northeast of Andizhan.

 Suvahuan, a mother of four in her 40s who fled the town on Saturday with her children, gave a harrowing account of the scene in Andizhan.

 They had snipers everywhere and they didnt care who they shot down. I saw hundreds of people dead in the street. I saw them shoot boys, women and children, she said They shot at the crowd like animals. They were firing at us from helicopters. People got confused running everywhere, trying to hide in buildings or behind cars.

 Rakhmat, a trader who crossed the hastily rebuilt Kara-Suu river bridge, said he saw desperate refugees drown in the river swollen by spring rains. President Islam Karimov took that bridge down in 1999 because he didnt want us trading in Kyrgyzstan, thats half the reason why there were protests in Andizhan, it was poverty not politics that drove people on to the streets.

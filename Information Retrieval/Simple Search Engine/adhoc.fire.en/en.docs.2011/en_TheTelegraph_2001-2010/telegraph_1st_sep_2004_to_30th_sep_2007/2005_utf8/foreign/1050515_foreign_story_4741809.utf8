 Ministers wine joke on vagrant falls flat

 KATE CONNOLLY 

 Berlin, May 14: The deputy leader of the German state of Bremen has been forced to relinquish his post after he poured a magnum of champagne over a homeless man in what he claimed was a joke.

 Germanys newspapers yesterday carried frame-by-frame shots of the incident, in which Peter Gloystein, a member of the Christian Democrats and Bremens economics minister, was shown on a podium, gleefully dousing Udo Oelschl?ger with champagne.

 Gloystein, who was attending the public opening of Bremen Wine Week, said as he poured: Heres something for you to drink as well. Oelschl?ger burst into tears and responded: Who are you? Why are you doing this? at which Gloysteins aides attempted to bundle him away.

 As the crowd looked on in shock, Gloystein tried to apologise to Oelschl?ger. First he handed him his business card, then he offered him money and his ?150 Montblanc pen.

 When Oelschl?ger declined them, he reportedly offered him a night in a luxury hotel, followed by a holiday and promised he would pay to have his clothes cleaned.

 Oelschl?ger, 45, told him: I dont need your money, Im not going to be bribed. You offended me and wanted to make me look like an idiot.

 Gloystein, a former banker, told angry onlookers his actions had been meant as a joke. He claimed he had wanted to pour the champagne into Oelschl?gers mouth, but that he had turned his head the wrong way at the last minute. Gloystein later issued a written apology, in which he said he sincerely regretted the incident but pressure from rival political parties led to his resignation.

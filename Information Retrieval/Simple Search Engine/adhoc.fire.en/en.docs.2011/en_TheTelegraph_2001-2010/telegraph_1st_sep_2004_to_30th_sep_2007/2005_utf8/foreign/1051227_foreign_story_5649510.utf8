 Lanka eyes Delhi help

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rajapakse

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: Struggling to preserve a fragile ceasefire with the Tamil Tigers, new Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse has turned to India for help.

 Rajapakse will fly to New Delhi tomorrow to ask leaders here to play a more proactive role in the peace process that has come under strain after the LTTE launched attacks against government troops.

 Colombo wants Delhi to participate in the peace process in the same manner as the US, Norway, Japan and the European Union. 

 Sources here, however, said Delhi would stick to its position of supporting the peace initiative but stay away from direct mediation between Colombo and the Tamil Tigers. 

 The mediation is being carried out by Norway and India is comfortable with its efforts, officials said. 

 Officials had talks with top Norwegian leaders last month on their approach to revive the peace process.

 Several Sri Lankan political leaders have made representations to the Indian envoy in Colombo seeking resumption of peace talks despite the resurgence of violence. 

 The Sri Lankan leadership fears another round of bloodshed in the island nation after the recent killing of 13 personnel of the Sri Lankan navy and the murder of pro-LTTE MP Joseph Parajasingham in Batticaloa yesterday. 

 Indian intelligence agencies had tipped Colombo about the LTTEs plan for creating unrest.

 Tomorrows visit will be Rajapakses first foreign one after assuming office a month back and its significance is not lost on South Block. 

 The groundwork for Rajapakses visit was done by his foreign minister Mangala Samareera who was in New Delhi last month. 

 Apart from holding talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rajapakse will meet President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the ministers of industry, commerce, highways and planning. 

 Officials said the sides are also going to spend considerable time chalking out plans to strengthen their relations.

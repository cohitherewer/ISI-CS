 Cash for UN linked to reforms

 United Nations, Dec. 24 (Reuters): The UN General Assembly, at the insistence of the US and others, adopted an unprecedented budget with a spending cap aimed at pressuring countries into approving reforms within six months.

 Under the deal, the 191-member Assembly passed a resolution late yesterday for a two-year, $3.8-billion administrative budget, thereby averting a financial crisis.

 But the resolution capped UN spending at $950 million, which is enough only for the first six months of 2006. After that, secretary-general Kofi Annan will have to ask the Assembly for more funds to pay staff.

 Claiming victory, US ambassador John Bolton said: This evening the US obtained something it had been striving for the last three months, which is a clear linkage between management reform and the budget process of the UN.

 Rich countries as well as Annan have been pushing hard for management reforms following allegations of corruption and mismanagement at the world body.

 Included among the reforms that the General Assembly still has to consider are a new human rights body and a review of programmes older than five years. The budget makes provisions for an ethics office Annan called for, a new whistle-blower policy and other reforms.

 Cloud over Iraq law panel

 Baghdad, July 24 (Reuters): A suicide bomber in a truck blew himself up outside a Baghdad police station today, killing at least 40 people and wounding 25, police and interior ministry sources said.

 The bloodshed came amid growing tensions over a committee drafting a constitution that is seen as a vital mechanism for drawing Arab Sunnis, who form the bulk of the insurgency, into a peaceful political process.

 The blast in the Mashtal area of eastern Baghdad killed and wounded both policemen and civilians, the police sources said. Television pictures showed a deep crater in the road as ambulances and firefighters attended the scene. The wreckage of a vehicle smouldered more than an hour after the blast.

 This is a very cowardly act carried out by criminals, not mujahideen, said a police major who gave his name as Kasim.

 Militants have stepped up suicide bombings in the last two weeks in a campaign designed to topple the US-backed Iraqi government. There have been more than 20 suicide attacks in the past 10 days alone.

 Todays attack was the deadliest since a suicide bomber blew himself up next to a fuel truck on July 16, causing a huge conflagration that killed 98 people in a town south of Baghdad.

 Sunni officials on the constitution-drafting committee, who walked out after a Sunni member and an observer were shot dead last week, say they will not return unless their demands, including an international investigation, are met.

 In Amman, Iraqi foreign minister Hoshiyar Zebari said Iraq would finish writing the constitution and hold elections at the end of the year, even if the countrys once dominant Sunni minority continued to boycott the process.

 It is in the interest of the Sunnis to participate without making excuses, Zebari said.

 If they do not take part, the constitution will not reflect their hopes and ambitions and the process will not stop. There is a timetable and Iraq has to honour international commitments according to UN resolutions, said Zebari, who chaired a meeting of senior Iraqi diplomats in the Jordanian capital.

 Saleh al-Mutlaq, a spokesman for the Sunni National Dialogue Council, said the Iraqi government could not afford to move ahead with the political process without Sunnis.

 My message to brother Zebari is that we are not Sunni members, we are sons of Iraq, we represent a wide proportion of the Iraqi people, he told a news conference. 

 We represent more than 42 per cent. Thats why Zebari or any power on earth cannot sideline this big proportion of Iraqis.

 Signs Sunnis might turn to politics, rather than violence, had encouraged members of the government but problems with the constitution committee have raised fresh concerns.

 Asked whether Sunnis would accept an Iraqi government investigation into the killing of the Sunnis on the constitutional committee, Mutlaq said:We believe that the government is not qualified to undertake an investigation that will lead to results that will expose the crime.

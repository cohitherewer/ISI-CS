 Lost dog drama

 London, Aug. 27: A couple desperate to get back their 14-year-old dog have put up a ?40,000 reward for its return, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 Diane Cousins and her husband Roy Zifras have re-mortgaged their ?200,000 home and sold jewellery worth ?4,500 to raise the reward for the return of Natasha, a Labrador cross.

 Diane Cousins, 55, who believes that the dog was kidnapped when it disappeared from the couples house in Downham, London, five months ago, has even sold her ?1,500 engagement ring. The couple have gone out searching for their pet in the evenings and have put up posters for miles around. 

 Diane Cousins said yesterday: Selling the jewellery and re-mortgaging the house is not a huge step to take to get my dog back.Theyre just objects. A ring is only a ring, a house is a house ? but a dog is a life.

 Pak link in US envoy plot

 - 3 militants held for planning to kill future Iraq ambassador

 Kabul, June 20 (Reuters): Afghan security forces have arrested three Pakistanis for allegedly planning to assassinate the US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, Washingtons future envoy to Iraq, an Afghan government official said today.

 The Pakistanis, who were suspected of being linked to a Pakistani Islamic militant group, were arrested in the eastern province of Laghman on Saturday, the day before Khalilzad made a visit there, said the official, who declined to be identified. They admitted they were there to try to get Khalilzad, he said.

 Afghanistans presidential palace provided Reuters with a brief videotape showing three young men who identified themselves as Morad Khan, Zahid, the son of Omar Said, and Gul Alem.

 The men, who appeared to be in their late teens or early 20s, were dressed in traditional salwar kameez outfits and all said they were from the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, which is close to Afghan border.

 The Afghan official said the three men were caught in the Laghmans Charkhakan district with two AK-47 rifles and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and rocket grenades, which were shown in the videotape.

 A US embassy spokesman said the Washington appreciated the support of the Afghan government in ensuring the protection of its diplomats, but added that he could not comment further on security matters. Pakistan was confident Afghanistan would investigate the matter to determine the facts, a Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman said in Islamabad.

 Pakistan condemns all acts of terrorism, said the spokesman, Jalil Abbas Jilani. We are confident that Afghan authorities will properly investigate the matter in order to ascertain the identity and motives of the plotters.

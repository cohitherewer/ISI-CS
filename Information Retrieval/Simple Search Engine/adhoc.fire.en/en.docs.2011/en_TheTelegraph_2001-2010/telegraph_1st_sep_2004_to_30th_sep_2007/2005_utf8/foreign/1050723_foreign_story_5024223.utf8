 Muslim fears

 London, July 22: Muslim leaders have called on the police to explain why an Asian man was shot dead at Stockwell station.

 The Muslim Council of Britain said Muslims were concerned there was a shoot to kill policy in operation. A spokesman said Muslims he had spoken to this morning were jumpy and nervous.

 Media secretary at the Muslim Council of Britain Inayat Bunglawala said: I have just had one phone call saying: What if I was carrying a rucksack?.

 Its vital the police give a statement about what occurred and explain why the man was shot dead. There may well be reasons why the police felt it necessary to unload five shots into the man and shoot him dead, but they need to make those reasons clear. We are getting phone calls from quite a lot of Muslims who are distressed about what may be a shoot to kill policy. He said in the current atmosphere Muslims were very afraid and other people were looking at them in a very suspicious manner.

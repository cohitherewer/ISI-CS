 UK website sorts out poll issues

 London, April 15 (Reuters): Confused about who to vote for in the May election? Too busy or indifferent to read all those election leaflets? www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com can sort you out.

 The website lists 23 big issue statements ? ranging from ?The UK was right to go to Iraq? to ?Foxhunting should be made legal again?. The user must decide how much they agree or disagree with each one. Each opinion is given a score depending on how closely the views match that of a party and the party that gets the highest score is apparently yours.

 The quiz is the brainchild of Paul Lenz from Thoughtplay, a London-based creative agency who said he spent days trawling through campaign literature and speeches looking for areas where parties had a distinctive policy difference.

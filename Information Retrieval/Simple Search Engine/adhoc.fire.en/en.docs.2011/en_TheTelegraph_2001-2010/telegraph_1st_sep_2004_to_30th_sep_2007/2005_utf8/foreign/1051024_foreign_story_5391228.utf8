 - From Asia to America, natures fury roars across continents

 Dubai, Oct. 23 (Reuters): Al Qaidas second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahri urged Muslims in a video broadcast today to help Pakistans earthquake victims even though its government was an agent of the US.

 I call on all Muslims and Islamic charity organisations in particular to go to Pakistan and give a helping hand to the victims there, a bespectacled Zawahri said in the tape aired on Al Jazeera.

 Wearing a white turban and seated beside an assault rifle, Zawahri denounced Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.

 We all know that Musharrafs government is an agent of the United States but despite that I call on all Muslims to run to the help of their brothers in Pakistan, he said.

 We all know the United States is against the activities of Islamic charities, said Zawahri, the Egyptian right-hand man of Osama bin Laden. He is wanted by Cairo for anti-government attacks.

 The tape appeared to have been recorded on October 9, as Zawahri said the earthquake had occurred the day before.

 Pakistan is a key ally in the US war against terrorism and has launched frequent raids against al Qaida militants and tribal supporters.

 Washington has accused a number of Islamic charities of funnelling funds to Muslim militants.

 Zawahri and bin Laden, believed to be hiding in the border regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, have eluded capture since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US, carried out by al Qaida.

 The appeal came as international efforts to help up to three million survivors of the earthquake are gathering momentum, but time is short and much more is needed, aid officials said.

 It is very high risk that this population is in, UN Humanitarian coordinator Rashid Khalikov told reporters, estimating rescuers had only five or six weeks to get people under shelter before the harsh Himalayan winter sets in.

 Whether we are able to do it in six weeks or not, we will know only six weeks after today, but we will do our best, he said as the confirmed death toll in northern Pakistan passed 53,000, with more than 75,000 seriously injured.

 Clearly much more needs to be done, Khalikov said.

 Vital helicopters needed to reach otherwise inaccessible mountain vill- ages cut off by landslides were arriving ? three British Chinook heavy transporters the latest ? and more were due.

 Aid officials, who have been complaining ever more loudly for days that the world is not doing enough, say time is crucial in a region where winters bring deep snows.

 The scarcest commodity at this time is time. All the rest money can buy, but money cant buy time, said UN coordinator Jan Vandermoortele.

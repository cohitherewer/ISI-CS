 Tehran, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Angry relatives of more than 100 people killed in Irans worst air disaster for three years complained today that officials knew in advance that the crashed plane was not safe to fly.

 Military officials denied knowing that the air force plane had problems but the judiciary said it had appointed a judge to investigate the relatives claims. The US-made C-130 Hercules struck a Tehran apartment block yesterday as it tried to make an emergency landing at the capitals main airport after reporting engine problems.

 The plane was taking scores of journalists to cover military exercises in the Gulf. All 94 aboard died and several others were killed as flames engulfed the building and nearby cars.

 Why did they send all those journalists in a plane with technical problems? asked Mojgan Afshar, sister of a reporter from the state broadcasting network IRIB who was on the plane. She was among hundreds of relatives and colleagues of those killed who went to Tehrans main coroners office trying to identify their loved ones.

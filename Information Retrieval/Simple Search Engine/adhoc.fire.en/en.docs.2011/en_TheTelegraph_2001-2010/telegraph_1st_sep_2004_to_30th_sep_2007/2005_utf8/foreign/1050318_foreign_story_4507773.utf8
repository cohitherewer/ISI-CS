 Stab amp; sorry

 Tokyo, March 17 (AFP): Two Japanese gangsters apologised to the man they had repeatedly stabbed at his apartment after realising he was not the one they were looking for, police and newspaper reports said today.

 Nakasuji, 28, and Masahiko Ohtsuka, 21, were arrested yesterday for allegedly trying to kill a 27-year-old businessman in Kita Kyushu in southern Fukuoka prefecture, police said.

 The assailants, who were after a man who had money troubles with the gang, stormed the apartment on June 2 last year, a local police spokesman said.

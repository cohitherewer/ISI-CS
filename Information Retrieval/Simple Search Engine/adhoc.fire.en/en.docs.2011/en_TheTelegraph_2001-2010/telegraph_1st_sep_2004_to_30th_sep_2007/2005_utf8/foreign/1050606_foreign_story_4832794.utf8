 Wife stands by tycoon

 COLIN FREEMAN

 Inna Khodorkovsky

 Moscow, June 5: The wife of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed Russian billionaire oligarch, has vowed to continue visiting her husband in prison even if he is incarcerated in one of the countrys far-flung gulags.

 Inna Khodorkovsky, who sobbed in court last week as her husband was sentenced to nine years, faces the prospect of him being sent to one of the remote Soviet-era prison camps in far eastern Russia.

 Asked how she would cope if he were held thousands of miles from the family home in Moscow, she said: I will certainly go to his penal colony, take a look around. Well shuttle there and back to see him more often.

 Without her powerful husband by her side, she said, she has been forced to manage the familys affairs alone. Most of the people she thought she could rely on disappeared after Khodorkovsky was arrested in October 2003 and she has faced open hostility from Russian officialdom.

 When the people we considered friends vanished it came as a shock. Now I dont regret it or miss them. A new life has to be created with new people come to fill the gaps.

 Bemoaning her treatment by the state, she added: I discovered that our children had no residence certificates so I had to recover and file some documents. I obtained medical insurance papers for them. The women at the housing department complained a lot about me. They whispered among themselves, said nasty things and rejected my documents. But the people in the queue were always friendly ? young and old people sympathised with me and helped me to fill out the forms.

 While international attention has focused on the trials wider political fallout, Russians have been engrossed in the personal drama of how his wife has coped with becoming a prison widow. 

 Since Khodorkovskys arrest at an airport in Siberia, his wifes sole contact with him has been through the reinforced glass screens of the prison visiting room at the notoriously overcrowded Matrosskaya Tishina remand centre in Moscow.

 Inna Khodorkovsky, who has five-year-old twin boys, Gleb and Ilya, and a daughter, Nastya, 12, said that the younger children could not understand why they could not kiss or hug their father. On their first visit, the twins tried to smash the screen with the telephone to help their father to escape. They really could not understand that this talk through the glass on the phone was their meeting with their father, she said. She never took them back.

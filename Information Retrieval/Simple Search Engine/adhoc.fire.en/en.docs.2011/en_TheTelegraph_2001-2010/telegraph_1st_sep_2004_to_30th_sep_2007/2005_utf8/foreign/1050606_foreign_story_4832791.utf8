 Fine Print

 Kylie battle

 London, June 5 (PTI): Australias 

 pop singer Kylie Minogue will be off-stage at least for 

 a year as she battles breast cancer.

 The singer will have six months of intensive therapy and will then need a further six to recuperate. Initially doctors said they were confident they had caught the cancer before it spread and there were hopes she might soon be back performing.

 She is on the road to recovery, and she isnt going to die, but this is serious and its going to take time, the Daily Mail tabloid said, quoting a source. Sources close to Kylie believe the 37-year-old singer will have to have a course of chemotherapy, although that has not been confirmed by her management.

 Perfect pix

 Francisco (Reuters): People 

 who solicit prostitutes in Oakland, California, could find 

 their faces plastered on billboards under a new shaming 

 programme that a civil rights group calls bad public policy. 

 The city started putting up billboards on Wednesday showing 

 men arrested for soliciting sex. Other signs invite prostitutes 

 to quit by calling a help line. The photos on the billboards 

 were partially blurred so the men are not easily identifiable. 

 But in the future photos might be displayed unaltered, an 

 aide to city council president Ignacio De La Fuente said. 

 Russia rap

 Moscow (Reuters): Russians who marry 

 foreigners could be exiled and stripped of their citizenship 

 under a bill being drafted by a group of members of parliament, 

 a deputy said on Sunday. One of the bills authors, 

 Duma deputy Nikolai Kuryanovich said: Our women, the 

 most beautiful and best in the world, are going abroad. 

 By doing this, they are wasting the most valuable thing 

 we have ? the gene pool of our nation.

 Battle of machines enters living room

 London, May 18: It cost a billion pounds to develop, runs at ten times the speed of most home computers and, its makers say, is capable of making computer games look like Hollywood films.

 Sony unveiled PlayStation 3 yesterday, its next generation of video games machine, and hopes to take it from childrens bedrooms into the living room. 

 After four years of development, the Japanese computer giant believes that it has come up with a super-computer capable of playing high-definition DVDs, video-conferencing, and Internet music and films.

 After dominating the market for ten years, Sony knows that it must broaden appeal from its core market of teenagers and embrace their families.

 Capability is the key, said Ken Kutaragi, the head of Sony Computer Entertainment who is credited with inventing the PlayStation. It has had a radical redesign. Gone is the hulking black box with trademark fins, and in its place a slimline cream machine with a hood.

 The wires that once blighted every teenage bedroom are also gone: it will operate using cordless hand-held controls. It will not be sold in Britain until at least next spring, and is expected to cost about ?299.

 This is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter battle with Microsoft, which last week revealed its own contender, Xbox 360. 

 Sony and Microsoft each claim that their machines are the best but technical experts say that the PlayStation could be at least twice as fast.

 PlayStation 3 is powered by the Cell processor, a microchip jointly developed by IBM and Toshiba that boasts more than 300 million transistors capable of 36 trillion calculations a second. Sony said PS3 will display computer graphics of similar quality to those in studio animation films such as The Incredibles.

 PlayStation 3 has a powerful machine under the hood, said Kaz Hirai, president of Sony Computer Entertainment of America, at a press conference.

 But there are fears that it could be delayed. Sony hopes to use Blu-Ray technology. which stores much more data than regular DVDs. Technical specifications still have to be agreed with Toshiba, which had intended to produce its own version.

 Sony already plans several games for the PS3, including the boxing game Fight Night, produced by Electronic Arts. Were going to blur the lines between the real world and the computer generated cyberworld, Kutaragi said.

 Computer games are worth dollars 30 billion a year, and makers believethat all homes will use a single device in the living room for all kindsof media.

 Customers expect more in the way of digital entertainment, said RobbieBach, head of Microsofts Xbox division. It has spent dollars 12 billionand incurred losses of more than dollars 2.4billion developing and sellingXbox. It is targeting a billion homes with the worlds biggest softwareoffer, of free internet via Xbox Live and the ability to send text, videoand audio messages.

 Nintendo, the third-ranked games maker, revealed its new product,code-named Revolution, late last night (Tuesday). It is about the size ofa stack of three DVD cases but has no visible knobs, buttons or ports forjoysticks.

 This system, with far less computing power, appeals to the older-gamingmarket. It offers free internet services and will play games on full-sizeor mini DVD and DVD films.

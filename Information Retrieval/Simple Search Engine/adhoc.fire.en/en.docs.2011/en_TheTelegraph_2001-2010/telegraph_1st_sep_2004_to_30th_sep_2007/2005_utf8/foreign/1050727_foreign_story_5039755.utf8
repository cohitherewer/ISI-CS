 Blair outlines battle plan

 AMIT ROY

 London, July 26: Tony Blair is planning a new package of measures to tackle terrorism, which the British Prime Minister outlined today.

 He said he welcomed moves by Pakistan to deal with extremists, thereby implying it was inevitable Islamic schools which preached hate would breed terrorists.

 It is important Britain and Pakistan work on these issues together, he said.

 Three of the four suicide bombers on July 7 ? Hasib Hussain, 17, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, and Mohammed Sidique Khan, 30, were British Pakistanis. Two of them, possibly all three, had visited Pakistan in the months leading up to the attacks in London.

 Which madarasas or military training camps they visited is still unclear though Blair and his security advisers appear to have come round to the view that Pakistan is involved and the long-term solution somehow lies in Pakistan.

 There are issues to do with Pakistan, said Blair.

 He added: If over a long period of time young people are having this extremism inculcated into them, taught into them, with a teaching about Islam that is fanatical and extreme then I dont think we can be surprised that some of them at least end up becoming extremists prepared to kill people.

 Needless to say, this view that Pakistan is involved in the London terror attacks is not shared by President Musharraf. The problem the British are having with Pakistan is reflected in a report in todays Evening Standard, Pakistan dismisses links to bombings.

 It begins: Britain reacted with dismay today after Pakistan denied any connection between terrorists there and the London bombings.

 The paper points out that Musharraf has said there is no evidence of a link between terror networks in Pakistan and the attacks in Britain and the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where 11 Britons are missing.

 Musharraf claims security forces have destroyed al Qaidas capability to run operations from his country. I am saying very clearly that al Qaida does not exist in Pakistan any more, he declared.

 Britain is not impressed by Musharrafs declaration. 

 Under the new terror laws Blair is contemplating, it will probably become an offence for British Pakistanis to wander off to Pakistan to get a bit of military training.

 In the past, neither the British nor the Americans were too bothered about such activity, provided the terrorism was confined to Kashmir.

 Meanwhile, the hunt for the would-be bombers of July 21 goes on. Police today found a white Volkswagen Polo in north London which may have belonged to one of them.

 It has also been disclosed that Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, the innocent Brazilian electrician mistakenly gunned down by police, was shot not five times, as earlier reported, but eight times. There were seven bullets into his head and one into his shoulder.

 The Daily Mail, which generally supports the forces of law and order on such matters, carries an article today by its commentator, Stephen Glover, which is headlined: Am I alone in thinking that pumping seven bullets into the head of an innocent man is NEVER justified?

 That rhetorical question probably sums up the national mood.

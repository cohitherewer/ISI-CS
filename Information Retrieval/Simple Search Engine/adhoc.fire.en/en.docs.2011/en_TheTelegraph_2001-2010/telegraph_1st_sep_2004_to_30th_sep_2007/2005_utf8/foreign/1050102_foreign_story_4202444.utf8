 Zarqawi in deaths claim

 Dubai, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Militants from a group led by al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi said they had killed five members of the Iraqi National Guard and warned those working with the US-backed government they faced the same fate.

 A video posted on the Internet today from al Qaida Organisation of Holy War in Iraq showed masked militants lining up the five captives in a street and shooting them from behind. 

 ?To the families of civil defence forces, the National Guard and the police we tell you to say your final goodbyes to your sons before you send them to us. Our reward to your sons is slaughter,? a masked militant said earlier, reading a statement.

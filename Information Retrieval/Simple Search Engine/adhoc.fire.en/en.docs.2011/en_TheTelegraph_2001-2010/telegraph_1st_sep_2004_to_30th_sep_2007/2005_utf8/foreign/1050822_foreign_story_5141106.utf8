 Weary Lanka fears fresh war

 Jaffna, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Buildings lie in ruins, signs warn of landmines, people watch heavily-armed army patrols with suspicion: scars of war have yet to heal in Sri Lankas ravaged north and fears it will re-ignite are palpable.

 Residents can only pray the government and Tamil Tiger rebels can defuse an escalating silent war that has killed dozens of police, soldiers, rebel cadres and now the islands foreign minister since a 2002 truce halted two decades of civil war.

 I want peace. I want my children to study, to become big people, like doctors, said N. Sundarabawan, 42, a Tamil who returned to the northern town of Jaffna to reopen his vegetable stall only after the ceasefire was signed.

 If the war starts, nobody will do business. I will leave and go to a safer place, the anxious father-of-two added.

 While the truce has technically held, relations between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government soured soon afterwards, peace talks broke down and a dirty war the military and the rebels each blame on the other is raging in the restive east.

 The spree of violence culminated last week in the assassination of foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, an ethnic Tamil who opposed the Tigers. President Chandrika Kumaratunga accuses the rebels, and few in Colombo believe their claim of innocence.

 Peace mediator Norway has called emergency talks between the foes to find ways to keep the truce alive and avoid a return to a civil war in which more than 64,000 people have been killed. But many in Jaffna doubt they will be fruitful.

 Any solution is still a long way off. The south ? the islands industrial heartland and political power-base ? has enjoyed steady economic growth since the ceasefire, and fears of a return to war are more muted. But the souths majority Sinhalese and the norths minority Tamils are both feeling the strain.

 Analysts say the main reason the islands longest truce since war broke out in earnest in 1983 is holding because most northern Tamils and southern Sinhalese are weary of war and neither want it to resume. No-one wants war. We are so tired of it, said E. Gunasekara, who works as an accountant in Colombo. But it will probably take generations for the animosity to die down and bring real peace.

 Sunni cleric killed in Karachi

 Karachi, July 9 (Reuters): Gunmen killed a Sunni cleric in Karachi in what police said today appeared to be a sectarian attack.

 The bullet-riddled body of the cleric, identified as Mufti Shams Uddin, 55, was found today on a street in the poor Orangi district, said area police officer Rasheed Khan.

 This appears to be an incident of a targeted killing, Khan said. 

 Thousands of people have been killed in tit-for-tat attacks by rival Sunni and Shia militants over the past 15 years. More than 100 people have been killed in the past year.

 Danger! Saucy ads up ahead

 Risky roads: Eva 

 Herzigova 

 London, Nov. 21 (Reuters): 

 Almost a quarter of British motorists admit they have been 

 so distracted by roadside billboards of semi-naked models 

 that they have dangerously veered out of their lane.

 In research released today, one in five male drivers said their eyes were diverted from the road by posters of scantily clad women ? such as the saucy cleavage shots of model Eva Herzigova in her notorious adverts for Wonderbra. However, only one in 10 women were put off by the sight of a semi-dressed male model.

 Flashing warning signs, huge advertising hoardings and Christmas decorations were also said to be major distractions. Mark Young, an expert in transport ergonomics, said novel advertising could cause a significant risk of distracting drivers at crucial times, such as going round a difficult roundabout.

 The study, by Privilege Insurance, said a 5 second distraction at 97 kmph equated to driving at least the length of a soccer pitch without fully concentrating.

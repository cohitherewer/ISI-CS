 Teen cookie surprise crumbles

 Durango (Colorado), Feb. 5 (Reuters): A Colorado judge ordered two teenage girls to pay about $900 for the distress a neighbour said they caused by giving her home-made cookies adorned with paper hearts.

 The pair were ordered to pay $871.70 plus $39 in court costs after neighbour Wanita Renea Young, 49, filed a lawsuit complaining that the unsolicited cookies, left at her house after the girls knocked on her door, had triggered an anxiety attack that sent her to the hospital the next day.

 Taylor Ostergaard, then 17, and Lindsey Jo Zellitte, 18, paid the judgment on Thursday after a small claims court ruling by La Plata County court judge Doug Walker, a court clerk said yesterday.

 The girls baked cookies as a surprise for several of their rural Colorado neighbours on July 31 and dropped off small batches on their porches, accompanied by red or pink paper hearts and the message: ?Have a great night.?

 Young said she was frightened because the two had knocked on her door at about 10.30 pm and run off after leaving the cookies. She went to a hospital emergency room the next day, fearing that she had suffered a heart attack, court records said.

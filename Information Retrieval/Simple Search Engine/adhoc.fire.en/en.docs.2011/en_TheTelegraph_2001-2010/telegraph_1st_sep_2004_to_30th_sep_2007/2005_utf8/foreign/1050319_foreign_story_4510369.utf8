 Pak rapists re-arrested

 Islamabad, March 18 (Reuters): Pakistani police today re-arrested four men convicted in a notorious gangrape, hours after the victim asked Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz to intervene.

 Yesterday, Mukhtaran Mai, the victim of the 2002 rape said she feared for her life after the release of the men on Tuesday pending a Supreme Court appeals hearing. ?We have detained them on the orders of the government we have just received today,? said Ehsan Mehboob, police chief of central town of Muzaffargarh.

 Mai said the Prime Minister had promised to help her in her bid for justice and she felt encouraged. ?I am satisfied that at least now I can go home, although I still fear danger from them,? she said.

 Libyan cadet with William at Sandhurst

 London, Aug. 28: Prince William will have unusual company when he enters the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst in January: an army officer from Libya ? until recently regarded as one of the most detested regimes for its terrorist acts against the West.

 The thawing of relations between Britain and the regime led by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi has resulted in an invitation to send one of his armys brightest young officers to attend Sandhurst next year.

 The chance for a Libyan to train alongside the heir to the throne is a remarkable transformation for a country whose agents murdered 281 people in 1988 by blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie in Scotland, that ran guns for the IRA and one of whose diplomats shot dead Pc Yvonne Fletcher in 1984 in London.

 Prince William and the Libyan recruit will be together during his 12-month training course to become an army officer. Like his brother Harry, who is already halfway through his commissioning course, Prince William will probably go on to join one of the infantry or cavalry regiments in the Household Division. Prince Harry is due to pass out in December.

 Libya has also sent senior officers to the British Armys Higher Command and Staff course, and Britain is understood to be sending a team out to train Libyan troops in peace-keeping duties. Joint desert exercises are also expected over the next few years.

 The initiative is part of a relationship-building process, according to the ministry of defence, and follows Gaddafis declaration last year that the Arab state has ended attempts to acquire and manufacture weapons of mass destruction.

 Before Gaddafi, who also trained at Sandhurst, seized power in a coup in 1969, Britain had a very strong military relationship with Libya. 

 A spokesman for the MoD said: Libya has expressed a desire to develop its peace support operations capability to enable them to contribute to peace-keeping operations under the auspices of the African Union, and we have offered them a comprehensive package of training.

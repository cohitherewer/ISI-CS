 Amnesty founder dies

 London, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Peter Benenson, the British lawyer whose outrage at the jailing of two Portuguese students in 1960 spawned the Nobel Prize-winning human rights group Amnesty International, has died at the age of 83.

 His organisation, with its symbol of a burning candle wrapped in barbed wire, now numbers 1.8 million members and supporters. It was the students? toast to freedom in Antonio Salazar?s dictatorship in Portugal, leading to their arrest, that first fired Benenson into action. He wondered how to get them released, hitting on the idea of bombarding the authorities with letters demanding they be freed.

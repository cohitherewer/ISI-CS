 Koizumi sorry for war past

 Jakarta, April 22 (Reuters): Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi apologised today for Japan?s wartime past and said he wanted to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao in a bid to repair ties between the Asian giants, at their worst in over 30 years.

 Koizumi, speaking after making the apology in front of world leaders at a multilateral forum, said he would meet Hu tomorrow on the sidelines of the Asia-Africa summit in Jakarta.

 However, China said it could not confirm the talks would take place. Koizumi?s spokesman told a late night news conference that both sides wanted the meeting to take place, but added officials were having problems scheduling a time.

 ?Nothing is produced by antagonism,? Koizumi said. ?Friendship is most important. I would like to hold the meeting from that perspective.? Asked if he would meet Hu tomorrow, Koizumi said: ?I?ve been told that we will hold it tomorrow.?

 But Kong Quan, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said in Jakarta: ?We can?t confirm (it). The foreign ministries of the two countries are still talking.? 

 Relations between the two Asian powerhouses have been at the worst in decades following violent anti-Japan demonstrations in China over school history textbooks which critics say sugarcoat its wartime history and other irritants.

 The spat puts at risk economic ties worth $212 billion in annual trade.

 Addressing the gathering of leaders from 100 Asian and African countries including Hu, Koizumi earlier apologised for the pain inflicted by Japan.

 ?In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations,? he said.

 ?Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility,? he said, adding the Japanese people have engraved in their minds ?feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology.?

 The apology mirrors past statements by Tokyo but such an admission in front of foreign leaders is rare. ?We welcome that he made known his stance... More important, he should follow it up with action,? Kong, the Chinese spokesman, said without elaborating.

 Thousands have demonstrated in cities across China the past three weekends in violent protests against the Japanese textbooks and against Tokyo?s campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

 In a sign of how easily ties can be affected, a Japanese cabinet minister and 80 other parliamentarians paid their respects today at a war shrine that has become a symbol of the animosity, prompting an angry response from Beijing.

 ?Sino-Japanese relations are facing a grim situation, and we express our strong dissatisfaction for some Japanese political personnel?s negative behaviour in disregarding the general situation,? the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement in Beijing.

 Ties with China chilled markedly after Koizumi took office in 2001 and began annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.

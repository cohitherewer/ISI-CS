 LTTE chief 

 Colombo, Jan. 18 (Reuters): The reclusive leader of Sri Lanka?s Tamil Tiger guerrillas appeared in public for the first time since last month?s tsunami, quelling rumours that he had been killed in the disaster, a pro-rebel website reported.

 LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran met relief workers in the northern town of Kilinochchi yesterday, tamilnet.com said. 

 It carried a picture showing him in combat fatigues chairing a meeting.

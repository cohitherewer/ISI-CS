 China heat on Christians

 Beijing, Nov. 8 (Reuters): A Chinese court sentenced a Protestant minister, his wife and her brother to prison terms of up to three years today for illegally printing Bibles and other Christian publications, one of their lawyers said.

 The conviction of house church minister Cai Zhuohua, 34, and his family by the Beijing Peoples Intermediate Court came days before President George W. Bush arrives for a visit. In atheist China, printing of Bibles and other religious publications needs approval from the State Bureau of Religious Affairs. Bibles cannot be openly bought at bookshops in a country long criticised overseas for intolerance of religion.

 Cai, arrested in September last year, was sentenced to three years in prison on charges of illegal business practices after pleading not guilty, lawyer Zhang Xingshui said by telephone.

 His 33-year-old wife, Xiao Yunfei, was given a two-year prison sentence and her brother, Xiao Gaowen, 37, an 18-month term, the lawyer said. Both were convicted on similar charges. They were expected to appeal and have 10 days to do so. Court officials reached by telephone declined to comment.

 Cais mother defended her son but said she was neither sad nor incensed. The prosecution could not find a witness to testify that my son received any money, Cai Laiyi, 61, said. But Im not sad or angry because this is Gods arrangement, said Cais mother, who is looking after his five-year-old son. The court fined minister Cai 200,000 yuan ($25,000), his wife 150,000 yuan and her brother 100,000 yuan.

 The defendants were calm when they appeared in court wearing handcuffs.

 A fourth defendant, Hu Jinyun, Xiao Gaowens wife, was exempted from criminal punishment on charges of secretly storing illegal goods because she made contributions by informing against her sister-in-law, the lawyer said, quoting the verdict. Eight lawyers and legal experts had offered their services to the defendants free of charge.

 A prosecutor, in the bill of indictment, accused the defendants of illegally printing 200,000 copies of the Bible which were found in Cais warehouse. 

 In July, Hong Kongs Beijing-funded Ta Kung Pao newspaper quoted Ye Xiaowen, director of the State Bureau of Religious Affairs, as saying Cai illegally printed 40 million copies of the Bible and other Christian publications. Ye accused Cai of illegally selling over two million copies of the Bible instead of giving them away for free, the newspaper said.

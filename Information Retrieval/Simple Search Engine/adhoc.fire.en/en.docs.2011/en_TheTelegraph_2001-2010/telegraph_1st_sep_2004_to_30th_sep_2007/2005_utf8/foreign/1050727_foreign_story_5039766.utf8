 Myanmar skips Asean chair

 Vientiane, July 26 (Reuters): Army-ruled Myanmar will skip its turn as Asean chairman in 2006, defusing a simmering row between the southeast Asian bloc and the West over the juntas lack of democratic reform and detention of Aung San Suu Kyi.

 We agreed that once Myanmar is ready to take its turn to be the Asean chair, it can do so, Lao foreign minister Somsavat Lengsavad said today, reading out a joint statement by the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).

 Myanmar wanted to focus its full attention on efforts at national reconciliation and restoring democracy after more than four decades of military rule, the statement said. We expressed our sincere appreciation to the government of Myanmar for not allowing its national preoccupation to affect Asean solidarity and cohesiveness, Somsavat said, adding that 2006 would be a critical year for the former Burma.

 Few western governments believe Yangons democracy rhetoric, especially while Nobel laureate Suu Kyi ? whose National League for Democracy won a landslide election victory in 1990 only to be denied power by the army ? remains under house arrest. On the eve of the Asean meeting in Vientiane, British foreign office minister Ian Pearson had repeated US and European threats to boycott Asean proceedings in 2006 if the generals took up the reins without embracing any meaningful political reform.

 The Philippines will now become chairman after Malaysia finishes its stint in mid-2006. 

 Singapore foreign minister George Yeo said the decision removed a thorny problem, although the group would have supported Yangon if it had insisted on assuming the chair.

 12 years ago, great leader ruled Iraq

 MICHAEL GEORGY

 Baghdad, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Twelve years ago, I could never have imagined that Iraqis would put their former President on trial.

 It was 1993, UN sanctions were starting to bite and an American newspaper editor wanted a piece on what Iraqis thought about Saddam.

 I spent a month in Baghdad interviewing people from morning until night. They scarcely seemed able to think at all when it came to their leader, at least not in public. However much I asked, I kept hearing the same words of praise. After a while, I found I no longer needed to write down what they said. It was nearly all the same. Saddam is our great leader.

 The US and the UN are evil. They want to destroy the Iraqi people, were the most common lines. I heard it in the streets, in shops, in offices. I heard it in schoolyards across the capital where future generations were rounded up for Saddam pep talks several times a day.

 Even after persuading the nervous taxi driver I had hired to break the rules so that we could conduct interviews without our government minder, everyone kept referring to great Saddam. We headed to Saddam City, an eastern Baghdad slum where two million members of Iraqs long-oppressed Shia majority lived with potholed streets and piles of fetid garbage, which also served as soccer pitches for children in ragged clothes. 

 Sure at last that I would find critical comments, I eagerly pulled out my notebook again. But no. Just the same answers, rehearsed over two decades of Saddam, who had a penchant for standing on balconies and firing a rifle into the air as thousands chanted support in footage routinely broadcast on state television. People were polite with warm smiles. But they clearly feared departing from the official line in one of the worlds most ruthless police states.

 After an entire month of combing Baghdad, my notebook contained a single line from a solitary Iraqi, one of hundreds I spoke to, that suggested that life might perhaps not be ideal.

 One woman in Saddam City had said: We are tired of wars.

 Who was she? Like nearly every other, even those who spoke in praise, she was too scared to give her name.

 I went back to the high-rise Rashid Hotel, where the secret police often shifted around belongings of foreign journalists to remind them they were being watched. 

 I packed up. Denied air travel by UN sanctions, I took a taxi to Jordan.

 Dejected by my efforts, I tried my luck one more time, asking the taxi driver what he thought of Saddam every time we passed the murals of the leader found across Iraq. 

 The Iraqi driver sped along the barren highway toward the border, offering time and again a single predictable answer as I tried to probe his mind. Saddam is a great leader, he said, as we drove by one of Iraqs most feared institutions, Abu Ghraib prison.

 At the border crossing, we both looked up and noticed at the same time another huge mural of Saddam. And there it happened. On the frontier of Saddams Republic of Fear, the driver finally spoke up:Can you believe it?

 That bastard wants us to think hes a farmer too?

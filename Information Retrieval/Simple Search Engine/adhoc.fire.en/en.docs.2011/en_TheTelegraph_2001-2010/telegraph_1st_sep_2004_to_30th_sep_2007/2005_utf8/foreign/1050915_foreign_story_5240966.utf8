 Sharon meets Musharraf

 Jerusalem, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon met Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on the sidelines of a UN summit today, Israeli television said.

 Channel Two said the two leaders, whose countries have no formal ties, exchanged pleasantries in a corridor of the UN building. The Israeli and Pakistani foreign ministers held talks earlier this month, signalling a possible thaw in relations.

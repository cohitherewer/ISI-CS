 Labour trouble brews in star club

 WALTER ELLIS AND CHRISTOPHER HASTINGS

 Jude Law: Soho regular

 New York/London, Sept. 11: Its members, who pay $1,100 a year for the privilege, include the cream of New Yorks celebrity circuit. 

 In the bar, spa and restaurant of the citys private Soho House club there is always a chance of catching a glimpse of David Bowie rubbing shoulders with film stars ranging from Jude Law to Nicole Kidman. Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, may be seen sipping cocktails on a 39ft Chesterfield sofa, while on the roof, well-groomed women gather for long, languid afternoons around the heated pool.

 Now the club founded four years ago in a former warehouse in New Yorks meatpacking district ? part of a growing chain which includes the original London Soho House ? is becoming a victim of its own success.

 As its members shell out $100 a head for dinner with wine at its restaurant ? once used as the location for an episode of Sex and the City ? or spend up to $1,000 for a night in its most luxurious bedroom, below stairs a revolt is being fomented among its staff.

 Nick Jones, the Soho House groups British owner, is caught up in an old-fashioned New York labour battle as two rival trades unions scrap for members among his staff in an increasingly heated drive for official recognition. The unions complain that while the average wage for a room attendant elsewhere in the city is $36,000 a year, plus medical cover and a pension, at Soho House workers earn considerably less.

 Although a top bartender can take home as much as $1,000 a day in tips, a typical room cleaner or pool attendant makes as little as $24,000 a year. Many of those employed at the exclusive Ninth Avenue club have only elementary medical cover, and are excluded from the company pension scheme.

 Disgruntled workers are being asked to vote on the vexed issue of union recognition. Should the decision go against management, the New York Hotel Trades Council will open negotiations on behalf of its members that could see the clubs wage bill jump by as much as $2 million a year.

 Jones says his staffs pay and conditions are comparable to those offered by other non-unionised employers in New York. 

 If people are really unhappy then they do have the opportunity to go elsewhere but they choose not to. I think that tells you something.

 John Turchiano of the Hotel Trades Council is optimistic that before long he will be sitting down with management to discuss improved pay and conditions for the clubs estimated 170-strong bargaining unit ? its workers. If a deal can be struck, it will be champagne all round.

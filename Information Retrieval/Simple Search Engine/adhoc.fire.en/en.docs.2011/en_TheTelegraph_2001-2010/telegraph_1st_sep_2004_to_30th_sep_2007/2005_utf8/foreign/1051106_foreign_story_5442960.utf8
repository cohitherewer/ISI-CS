 Poor Paris burns in riots

 Aulnay-Sous-Bois (France), Nov. 5 (Reuters): Hit-and-run arson attacks escalated in poor Paris suburbs as the government met to formulate a political response to nine nights of urban violence that has spawned copycat unrest in major towns.

 Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin summoned eight key ministers and a top Muslim official to his offices today as he sought to chart an end to violence some foreign newspapers have likened to the Palestinian intifada.

 Violence is not a solution, interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy, accused of stoking passions by calling rioters scum, said after the meeting.

 Once the crisis is over, everyone will have to understand there are a certain number of injustices in some neighbourhoods. We are trying to be firm and avoid any provocation. We have to avoid any risk of explosion, he said.

 Overnight, rioters burnt almost 900 vehicles in the Paris region and large provincial cities like Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Pau, Rennes, Toulouse and Lille, the highest total since unrest sparked by the deaths of two youths apparently fleeing police.

 Initially seen as the expression of pent up anger by youths of mainly North African and black African origin over police, racism, unemployment and their marginal place in French society, residents of all backgrounds are tiring of the nightly violence.

 In Aulnay-sous-Bois, a rundown suburb of 80,000 inhabitants northeast of Paris, several thousand residents, some singing the national anthem, marched past burnt out vehicles and a community centre behind a No To Violence, Yes To Dialogue banner.

 Its a sign that the laws of the republic apply to everyone and that we will not give in to violence, said mayor Gerard Gaudron. Overnight, police arrested 258 suspects and drafted in a helicopter in the Paris region to film events. 

 While fewer clashes with youths were reported, judicial officials said the unrest was being organised via the Internet and mobile phones.

 Washington, May 31 (Reuters): Tobacco companies designed cigarettes to appeal to womens desires to be thin and healthy in ways that went far beyond marketing and advertising, health researchers said yesterday.

 They said internal documents released by tobacco companies under a 1998 court settlement show the companies created cigarettes, including slim and so-called light brands, in part to attract women.

 These internal documents reveal that the tobacco industrys targeting of women goes far beyond marketing and advertising, said Carrie Murray Carpenter of the Harvard School of Public Health, who led the study.

 Writing in the June issue of the journal Addiction, Carpenter and colleagues said their study of tobacco company documents show a clear effort to find out what might make women want to smoke. The firms also considered putting appetite suppressants into cigarettes so they could promote them as weight control products, they said.

 How unfortunate that the industry used these findings to exploit women and not help them. Cigarette designs and ingredients were manipulated in an effort to make cigarettes more palatable to women and to complement advertising allusions of smooth, healthy, weight-controlling, stress-reducing smoke, Jack Henningfield of Johns Hopkins University and colleagues wrote in a commentary.

 Carpenters team said tobacco companies efforts to attract women included the creation of slim cigarettes in the 1970s.

 These studies demonstrate that marketing strategies, especially for female brands, have contributed to the association of smoking with appealing attributes including female liberation, glamour, success and thinness, they wrote.

 Carpenters team sifted through more than seven million internal tobacco industry documents made public through the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between the state attorneys general and major US tobacco manufacturers.

 Tobacco companies also targeted light cigarette brands, with their promise of smaller amounts of harmful tar and nicotine, to women torn between the desire to smoke and health worries.

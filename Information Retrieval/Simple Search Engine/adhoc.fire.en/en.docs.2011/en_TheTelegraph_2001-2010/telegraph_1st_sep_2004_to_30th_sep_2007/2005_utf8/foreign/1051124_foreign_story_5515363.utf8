 Fine Print

 Turkeys Bushed

 Washington, Nov. 23 (Reuters): It was a dream come true for Marshmallow and Yam, two lucky turkeys from Henning, Minnesota.

 President George W. Bush yesterday spared them from being served for Thanksgiving dinner and, to top it off, sent the pair on an all-expenses-paid trip to Disneyland.

 I know that Marshmallow and Yam are going to feel pretty good strutting around sunny California remembering the cold days of Minnesota, said Bush.

 Bush said the turkeys were named after a nationwide election on the White House website. In the end, the voters made the choice, and it was a close election. You might say it was neck and neck, Bush said. 

 Flyer fraud

 Sydney (Reuters): An Australian man 

 who illegally collected 17.6 million frequent flyer points 

 with some of the worlds biggest airlines, without 

 getting onto a plane, was jailed for fraud on Wednesday, 

 local media reported. Austin Perrott, 45, pleaded guilty 

 in Melbourne court to nine counts of obtaining financial 

 advantage by deception and was jailed for six months.

 Devil climb

 Houston (Reuters): A daredevil climber known as the French Spiderman, who has scaled skyscrapers around the globe, was arrested on Tuesday as he tried to clamber up a Houston office building. Alain Robert, 43, dashed from a taxi to the 46-story Houston Center but was stopped just as he was starting his ascent.

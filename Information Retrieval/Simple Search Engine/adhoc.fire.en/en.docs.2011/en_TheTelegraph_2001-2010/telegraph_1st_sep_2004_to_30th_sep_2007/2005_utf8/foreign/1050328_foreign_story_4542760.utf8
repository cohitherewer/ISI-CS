 Gaza pullout boost

 Jerusalem, March 27 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon cleared a major hurdle to a planned Gaza pullout, winning the support of a key opposition party for the state budget and avoiding an election that could have delayed the withdrawal.

 In another boost for Sharon, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice made it clear today that Washington was sticking to its support for Israel?s intention to retain large West Bank settlement blocs in any final peace deal with the Palestinians.

 Palestinian Deputy Prime Minister Nabil Shaath voiced dismay at Rice?s remarks. He said Israel would use the Gaza withdrawal as cover for ?stealing the rest of the territories, including Jerusalem?, dimming Palestinian hope for a viable state.

 Palestinian officials also objected to word from Israel that it would delay the handover of the third of five West Bank cities to Palestinian control agreed at a February 8 ceasefire summit between Sharon and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

 Sources said Israeli defence minister Shaul Mofaz would put off the transfer of Qalqilya due this week as Palestinians had not seized weapons as promised from 52 militants in towns already turned over, Tulkarm and Jericho.

 The 52 militants are on Israel?s wanted list for suspected involvement in attacks. But Palestinian officials said the agreement called only for gunmen to register weapons and not carry them around, and urged Israel not to delay handovers.

 An end to crippling Israeli military clampdowns on West Bank cities is seen as an important step towards easing tension and reviving West Asian peace talks frozen by fighting since 2000.

 Sharon ended weeks of political uncertainty when he wrapped up a deal yesterday with Yosef Lapid, head of the opposition Shinui party, to support the budget. Defeat in a parliamentary vote later this week would have triggered a new election by law.

 Berlin, Nov. 22 (Reuters): Angela Merkel was today elected Germanys first woman Chancellor in a parliamentary vote that ends months of uncer- tainty and ushers in a fragile new government that must prove it can revive Europes top economy.

 Merkel, the 51-year-old leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), won 397 votes in the 614-seat Bundestag, easily securing the majority she needed to become Germanys eighth post-war Chancellor and first to have grown up in the ex-communist east.

 Her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder, who initially refused to cede his post after her conservatives narrowly beat his Social Democrats (SPD) in a September 18 election, was the first to congratulate a smiling Merkel after parliamentary speaker Norbert Lammert announced the result to a hushed chamber.

 Dear Dr Merkel, you are now the first ever elected female head of government in Germany. That is a strong signal for many women, and certainly for some men too, Lammert said to laughs.

 President Horst Koehler wished her lots of luck, lots of strength and Gods blessing.

 Merkel and her cross-party cabinet of conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) will be sworn in later today, formally taking over from the SPD-Greens government that Schroeder has led for the past seven years.

 Her confirmation as Chancellor comes two months after her conservatives only narrowly beat Schroeders party in a vote she was expected to win easily, and a half year after Schroeder shocked the nation by calling for early polls.

 The election result left the pastors daughter with no choice but to form a coalition with the SPD, arch-rivals of her conservatives for much of the post-war era.

 During tough month-long coalition negotiations, Merkel, who has been compared with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was forced to abundon her most ambitious plans for shaking up the German social welfare system.

 Her new government has vowed to repair ties with Washington, strained by Schroeders opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.

 It is also promising to revive the economy, once Europes motor but now one of the more sluggish in the 25-nation EU, and cut unemployment that hit post-war highs under Schroeder.

 She must hope that the central plank of her coalition policy ? an agreement to bring the budget deficit back within EU borrowing limits by 2007 through higher sales taxes ? will not hinder growth by cramping consumer spending.

 With 397 votes, Merkel won more support in Parliament than any previous Chancellor, but 51 of the 448 deputies from her coalition chose not to support her, eliciting some expressions of disappointment from her cabinet.

 Perhaps it would have been nicer to have a 4 before the figure, but thats an aesthetic issue, not a question of stability in the coming years, said her new foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

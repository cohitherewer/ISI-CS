 Search for friend

 London, July 8: A woman is desperately searching for her boyfriend, who is still missing following yesterdays bus bombing in London. 

 Yvonne Nash said she feared 30-year-old Jamie Gordon was on the double-decker, which was ripped apart by an explosion in Tavistock Square.

 Nash, 30, an events marketing manager for the mobile phone company Orange, said her boyfriend had phoned work at 9.42 am yesterday to say he was on a bus from Euston to Kings Cross ? just five minutes before the blast.

 He has not been heard from since and has not returned any calls or texts to his cellphone, she said.

 Nash said Gordon, who works for City Assets Management, would not normally have taken that route to work, but had stayed at a friends house the previous evening following a night out.

 She said there appeared to be no other explanation but that he had been on the Number 30 bus devastated by the blast. The worst case scenario is that he is dead, she said.

 I just have to find him, said Nash, who has lived with Gordon in Enfield, north London, for seven years. I have to know what happened. Is he dead? Is he alive? Not knowing is dreadful.

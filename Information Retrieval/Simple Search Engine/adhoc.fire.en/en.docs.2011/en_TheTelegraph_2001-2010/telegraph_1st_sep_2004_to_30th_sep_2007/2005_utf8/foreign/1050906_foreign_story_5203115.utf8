 Two bars defy monster storm

 New Orleans, Sept. 5 (Reuters): At least two bars in New Orleans fabled French Quarter are honouring the tradition that drinking establishments in the boisterous tourist district stay open during hurricanes, even apocalyptic monsters like Hurricane Katrina.

 Mollys at the Market shut down on the evening of August 28 as Katrina bore down on New Orleans. The storm struck the city with damaging winds that night, then floodwaters began to seep in through levee breaches on the north end of town the next day.

 Except for wind damage, the Quarter stayed high and dry and so did Mollys and Johnny Whites. And both were back in business on Monday, August 29, with little apparent damage despite a lack of electricity and running water. 

 Thats our job. Thats just what we do, Mollys owner Jim Monaghan, 47, said.

 Mollys somehow managed to serve iced drinks yesterday to a mixed crowd of die-hard locals, visiting authorities and the media gaggle. Monaghan wouldnt say where he got the ice, and any inquisitors didnt much care.

 This is gold, said Sonny Fyler, 45, a builder who chatted over a well-iced vodka and cranberry cocktail. This is definitely gold. Im coming in here every day.

 While Mollys stays open only during daylight hours and caters to a varied clientele, the customers at Johnny Whites were different. 

 A late-night visit found a group of dedicated, mostly intoxicated, locals who drank uncooled cocktails by candlelight in the bar at the corner of Orleans and Bourbon in the heart of the Quarter. The open air joint has no doors, so the proprietors decided to hang on for as long as possible.

 New Orleans police, normally ambivalent about the public drunkenness that occurs most nights throughout the district, seemed strangely intolerant of it over the weekend even as it seemed they had bigger problems at hand. 

 We have a makeshift jail. You cross this line, and well take your ass there, a policeman, screamed at a drunken woman who had stumbled out of the door momentarily.

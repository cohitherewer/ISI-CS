 Pak scribes protest for more wages

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad , May 3: Pakistani journalists got police batons instead of an audience with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz today during a protest over better salaries. 

 The scribes had assembled in front of parliament house to protest against low salary structures and ?exploitative tactics? by newspaper owners who, they said, had been won over by the government. 

 They condemned the owners and their organisation ? the All Pakistan Newspapers Society ? for employing journalists on low wages without issuing appointment letters to them. 

 ?We will no longer tolerate injustices and intensify our struggle to ensure a better pay structure for the working journalists compatible with the current inflation rate,? a senior member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists said. 

 As the journalists began their march towards Aziz?s house, the police charged down on the scribes armed with batons. Thirty journalists were arrested. 

 In the National Assembly, leading Opposition parties blamed the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Q) for exceeding all limits of ?decency? in a bid to impose one-party dictatorial rule in the country.

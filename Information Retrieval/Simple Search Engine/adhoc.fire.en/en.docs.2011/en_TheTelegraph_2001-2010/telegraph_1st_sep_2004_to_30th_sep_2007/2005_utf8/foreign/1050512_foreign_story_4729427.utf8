 Foes turn friends in changing Pak

 Islamabad, May 11: Against the backdrop of emerging political realignments in Pakistan, yesterdays foes may be tomorrows friends, with Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) sharing power with President General Pervez Musharraf.

 Speculation on the PPPs role in the future political set- up rose following President Musharrafs statement in Lahore yesterday that he is still in touch with the party.

 It is not a one-way traffic because both the sides are willing to continue dialogue, he told newspersons amid reports of a deal, which if struck, will lead to dissolution of assemblies and holding of fresh elections by end of this year.

 Contact is a permanent thing and is still alive between us regardless of the outcome, Musharraf said, adding that not only the government, but the PPP has also shown interest in continuing dialogue.

 Musharraf, a strong advocate of allowing moderate forces to rule Pakistan to improve the countrys image abroad, particularly in the West, says these forces should be encouraged to combat extremism.

 A key US ally in the ongoing war on terror, Pakistan has taken several measures to propagate a soft and liberal image abroad by launching a manhunt for al Qaida and Taliban fugitives and militants involved in fanning sectarianism in the country.

 While the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q), a breakaway faction of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs PML, rules out the possibility of fresh parliamentary elections before 2007, Benazirs husband Asif Ali Zardari insists that 2005 is poll time.

 Observers believe that Zardaris bail in one of the many corruption cases last year after spending nine years in jail, was also part of reconciliatory moves towards the PPP and other moderate forces in the country.

 While media reports today suggested the PPP has forwarded the names of its stalwarts for key portfolios in a future national set-up prior to fresh elections, senior party leader and PPP spokesperson Senator Farhatullah Babar said the reports were an attempt to discredit the party.

 Both parties are close to an agreement for national reconciliation. In this regard, President Musharrafs emissaries sought names of PPP leaders for inclusion in the national set-up and the PPP forwarded their names, the reports said.

 Benazir was reported to have suggested the name of Aftab Shaban Mirani as the caretaker Prime Minister, but the government opposed it and requested her to forward Makhdoom Amin Fahims name for the slot. The reports, quoting sources, added that she accepted the demand.

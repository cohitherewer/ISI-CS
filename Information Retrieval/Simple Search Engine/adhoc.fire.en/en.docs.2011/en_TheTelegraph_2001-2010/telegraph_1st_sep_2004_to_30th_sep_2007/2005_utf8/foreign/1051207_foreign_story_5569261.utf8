 The trauma of Witness A

 Baghdad, Dec. 6 (Reuters): The first woman to testify in the trial of Saddam Hussein broke down in tears today as, in fear of her life, she testified behind a curtain about how she was tortured by Iraqi prison guards and jailed in Abu Ghraib.

 Identified only as Witness A, she said she was given electric shocks and beaten with cables after being forced to strip, and was fed bread through a tiny window in a prison cell she shared with a young girl.

 The woman was held with hundreds of others rounded up after an attempt on Saddams life in the village of Dujail in 1982. She said she had been moved from one prison to another over four years during Saddams rule, and had spent a bitter winter at the notorious Abu Ghraib jail in western Baghdad.

 From there she was driven through the desert to another jail. She said she saw animals by the roadside during the journey.A second witness, an elderly woman named only as Witness B, told the fortified Baghdad court that Saddams men had taken her away, along with her husband, five daughters and two sons.

 Saddam, 68, accused of crimes against humanity and facing possible execution, at first sat impassively through the fourth hearing of his trial but then lost his temper, thumping his desk, and wagging a finger at the judge.

 Telling his judges to Go to hell, Saddam Hussein threatened not to attend court in future, saying his trial on charges of crimes against humanity was unfair.

 Witness A began by speaking through a computerised voice modifier to protect her identity, but Saddams defence team complained they could not hear the evidence and the trial judge was forced to order a recess which lasted 40 minutes.

 It was unclear from the womans testimony when or where all the alleged incidents took place. The trial is centred on the killings of 148 men from the Shia village of Dujail.

 Witness A said that after being tortured, she had been thrown into a small cell.

 The light was red. It was all red. I had a girl with me ? Laila Jassim. We put shoes down as pillows, then the door was locked. 

 From a small window, they gave us two loaves of bread. After all that torture, do you think we could eat?

 She described being taken from there to Abu Ghraib.

 I cannot describe what was there, she said. In winter, the water was freezing ... We saw lice in our hair, everywhere. We had no shoes, we used to go barefoot. We would use cardboard and fashion a shoe out of it to go to the restroom.

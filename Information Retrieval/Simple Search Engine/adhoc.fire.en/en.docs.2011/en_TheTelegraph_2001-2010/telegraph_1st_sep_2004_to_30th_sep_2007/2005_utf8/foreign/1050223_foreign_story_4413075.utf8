 France race raids slammed

 Paris, Feb. 22 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac today condemned an attack in which swastikas were daubed on the main mosque in Paris, and faced pressure from Jewish groups to intensify the fight against anti-Semitism and all racism.

 The graffiti scrawled on the outer wall of the Grand Mosque and an arson attack on a railway carriage that is now a monument to Jews killed by the Nazi Germans, were the latest in a wave of racist attacks that have alarmed Muslims and Jews in France.

 Chirac telephoned Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Grand Mosque, to express his indignation over the graffiti. ?Everything will be done to find the culprits?, Chirac said. A dozen swastikas, and the SS initials of Adolf Hitler?s guard were found yesterday written in black paint on the outer wall of the mosque in central Paris.

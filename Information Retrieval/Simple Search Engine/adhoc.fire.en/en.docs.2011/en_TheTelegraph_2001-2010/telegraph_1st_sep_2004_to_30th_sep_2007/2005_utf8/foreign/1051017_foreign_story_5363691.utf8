 Spy leak cloud on Bush aides

 Washington, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Vice-President Dick Cheneys chief of staff could face obstruction and other charges over exchanges with a New York Times reporter as prosecutors wind up an investigation of who leaked a covert CIA operatives identity, people close to the case said today.

 President George W. Bushs top political adviser, Karl Rove, and Cheneys chief of staff, Lewis Libby, were among the possible targets of the probe. Legal sources said special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was likely to decide this week whether or not to bring indictments.

 While Fitzgerald could try to charge administration officials with knowingly revealing the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame, several lawyers in the case said he was more likely to seek charges for conspiracy and easier-to-prove crimes such as disclosing classified information, making false statements, obstruction and perjury. 

 Fitzgerald could also decide that no crime was committed.

 Plames diplomat husband, Joseph Wilson, says White House officials outed his wife, damaging her ability to work undercover, to discredit him for accusing the administration of twisting intelligence to justify the Iraq war in a New York Times opinion piece on July 6, 2003.

 Fitzgerald is putting together a big case, and hes looking for little pieces of a puzzle, Robert Bennett, the lead attorney for New York Times reporter Judith Miller, said on ABCs This Week.

 Legal sources said Rove could be vulnerable to a perjury charge for not initially telling the grand jury that he talked to Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper about Plame.

 White House officials were bracing for the possibility of bad news from the inquiry.

 Iraq-abuse Lynndie gets 3 yrs in prison

 England: Sorry

 Fort Hood (Texas), Sept. 28 (Reuters): Lynndie England, the US soldier pictured holding a leash to a naked Iraqi inmate at Abu Ghraib prison in a scandal that prompted global outrage, was sentenced yesterday to three years in prison and given a dishonourable discharge.

 In sentencing testimony just hours before, England, who had faced a maximum of nine years behind bars, said she was sorry for her actions but said she remained an American patriot.

 After the photos were released, Ive heard that attacks were made on US armed forces because of them, she said. I apologise to coalition forces and all the families, England, speaking slowly, told the jury of five officers.

 In Baghdad, Iraqis expressed fury today over the sentence, saying it exposed American hypocrisy. They said the sentence would have been more harsh had she been convicted of abusing Americans.

 England, 22, stood at attention to hear the verdict and remained standing and looking toward the front of the courtroom after the trial ended as tears welled in her eyes. Her mother, Terrie, then came over to give her a very long hug. Within 45 minutes, Englands hands and feet were shackled and she was slowly walked from the courthouse to a van that brought her to jail.

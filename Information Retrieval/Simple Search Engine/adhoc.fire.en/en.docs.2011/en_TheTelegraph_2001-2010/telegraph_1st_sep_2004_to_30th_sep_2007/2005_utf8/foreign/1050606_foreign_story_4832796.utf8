 Budget blow to Harry

 SEAN RAYMENT

 Prince Harry

 London, June 5: Moves by senior officers to improve security at the Sandhurst Royal Military Academy, where Prince Harry is an officer cadet, have been rejected by the ministry of defence.

 Officers at the academy made a request this year to the Army Training and Recruiting Agency ? the organisation responsible for army training ? for a ?1.5-million budget increase to improve security for VIP cadets.

 The Sunday Telegraph has learnt, however, that the request was refused after civil servants at the MoD ruled that the armys ?600-million training budget was exhausted.

 The ruling has astonished officers because of the heightened security threat against military and official government buildings from al-Qaida-linked organisations.

 It is understood that senior officers wanted to improve fencing in parts of the academy and replace many of the older closed-circuit television cameras with more effective devices that can operate 24-hours a day in all-weather conditions. 

 It is understood that the security review took place earlier this year when Prince Harrys impending arrival at the academy helped to focus the minds of those officers responsible for security of VIP cadets, usually from foreign royal families.

 The academy is regarded as a nightmare to secure because it is home to hundreds of servicemen and women and their families and borders a military training area covering several hundred acres of wood and scrubland.

 Although the academy is surrounded by razor wire-topped fencing, hundreds of civilians enter its grounds each week on guided tours, to visit the museum or attend private functions in the chapel.

 Details of the ruling come in the same week that Prince Harry, 20, was photographed taking part in exercise Self Reliance, one of the first exercises that cadets undertake.

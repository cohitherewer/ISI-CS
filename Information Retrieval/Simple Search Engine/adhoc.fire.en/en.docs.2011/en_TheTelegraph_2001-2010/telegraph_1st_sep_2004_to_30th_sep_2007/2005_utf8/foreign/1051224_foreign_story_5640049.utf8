 US to cut troops by early 2006

 Falluja, Dec. 23 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld today said the number of US combat troops in Iraq would be cut by some 7,000 by early next year, but the number involved in training Iraqs new military would increase.

 Rumsfeld, the second senior US official to visit Iraq this week after last weeks election, said progress in Iraqs politics, economics and security lay behind the decision to scale back the combat troops.

 President (George W.) Bush has authorised an adjustment in US combat brigades in Iraq from 17 to 15, Rumsfeld said, addressing several hundred US troops at a military camp east of Falluja.

 This will include increases in the number of US forces involved in transition teams, intelligence support, and logistics, to assist the Iraqi security forces in continuing to assume greater responsibility for the security of their country.

 The adjustment being announced today is a recognition of the Iraqi peoples progress in assuming added responsibility for their country, he said, adding that the US and Iraqi governments would continue to evaluate the troop situation in the coming months.

 Some troops from the two brigades affected would be transferred from combat to training Iraqis, Rumsfeld said.

 The Pentagon said in a statement: The effect of these adjustments will likely reduce the forces in Iraq by the Spri-ng of 2006 below the 138,000 baseline, the current normal level of US troop strength in Iraq.

 Elements of the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division will deploy to conduct missions such as providing security forces and conducting transition training for Iraqi security forces, it added.

 The 2nd Brigade, 1st Armoured Division has already deployed to Kuwait and will remain there available as a call-forward force for the commander, US Central Command to support operations in Iraq. It said troop numbers might further fluctuate if needed.

 US democrats have been pressing the Bush administration to lay out plans for a withdrawal.

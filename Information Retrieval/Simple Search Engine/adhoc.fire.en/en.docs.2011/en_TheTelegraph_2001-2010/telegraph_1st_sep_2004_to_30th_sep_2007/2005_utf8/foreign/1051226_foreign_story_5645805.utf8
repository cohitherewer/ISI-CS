 Fruits of truce in Christs homeland

 - biggest influx of pilgrims to bethlehem in years

 Bethlehem, West Bank, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Calls for peace resonated in Bethlehem today as a lull in violence spurred the biggest influx of Christmas pilgrims for years to the town where Christians believe Jesus was born.

 Both Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said in messages they were committed to peacemaking in 2006. In Rome, Pope Benedict offered a special prayer for peace in the Holy Land. 

 In Bethlehem, an intermittent battleground in the five-year-old Palestinian uprising, Vatican envoy Michel Sabbah said there was a real opportunity to grasp, with both Israelis and Palestinians due to hold elections early next year.

 A new Israeli and Palestinian political landscape is taking shape, said the Latin Patriarch Sabbah, a Palestinian. Leaving all violence, all vengeance, freeing political prisoners and putting the past behind can create a new land in which we can assure security for Israelis... and give Palestinians liberty and an end to occupation, he said.

 Taking advantage of a truce that Palestinian militants have said they will follow to the end of the year, thousands of pilgrims and tourists came to Bethlehem. 

 Braving gusts of icy rain, they dashed from tour buses to the candle-lit warmth of the grotto in the Church of the Nativity, revered by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus. Outside, monks and pilgrims sang hymns.

 We hope that the Palestinians and Israelis will have peace and the whole world is waiting for this, said Yves Chaleon, an engineer from Paris.

 Bethlehem is dependent on tourism and the towns mayor said he was expecting 30,000 visitors on Saturday and Sunday, far more than in any year since a Palestinian uprising began in 2000. 

 Souvenir sellers were out in force, hawking olivewood carvings, rosaries and black and white keffiyeh Arab headdresses. Some did a good trade in umbrellas.

 People start to get a sense of security in this town, said Bethlehem resident Elias Deik. It is good for economy.

 Israels army has eased restrictions to allow foreigners, as well as Israeli and Palestinian Christians from the West Bank and Gaza, to visit the town. But for the first time, pilgrims taking the road from Jerusalem have to pass through an iron gateway in an eightmetre-high concrete wall. Israel erected it aiming to stop Palestinian suicide bombers. 

 In our bitter and painful reality, we use this spiritual and religious occasion to send a message of peace to our Israeli neighbours, said Abbas. He is a Muslim, like most Palestinians.

 Sharons office said the prime minister also wanted to push for peace. We all need (peace) and I intend to make every effort to achieve it, Sharon told Christian leaders.

 Although both sides have long said they want peace, there is no sign of early talks. While Bethlehem has escaped violence, bloodshed elsewhere has dimmed hopes that Israels withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip this year can spur peacemaking.

 Ushering in his first Christmas as pontiff, Pope Benedict, who has been invited to visit both Israel and Palestine, made a special appeal for peace in the Holy Land.

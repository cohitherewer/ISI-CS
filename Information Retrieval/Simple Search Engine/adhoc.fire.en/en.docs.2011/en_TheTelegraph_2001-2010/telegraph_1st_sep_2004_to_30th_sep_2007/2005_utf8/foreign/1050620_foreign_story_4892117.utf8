 Fines not fine

Beijing, June 19 (Reuters): A Chinese vegetable peddler has 

asked a Beijing court to overturn police fines totalling more than a years 

pay after he made the same illegal turn 105 times, state media said on Sunday.

 Du Baoliang was captured making the illegal turn past a no-entry sign on his way from home to his vegetable stall by a hidden camera, part of a network set up to automatically record traffic violations, reports said.

 Du, 40, was unaware of the violations until he went to the traffic management office and was told he owed 10,500 yuan ? more than the 9,422 yuan average annual per capita income for urban residents. Du paid the fines, but sued to get his money back and a further 3,000 yuan for lost vegetable sales while fighting the case, the Xinhua Daily Telegraph said.

 He argues that traffic officials hold some responsibility for failing to notify him that he had broken the law early on.

 Special vow

Edinburgh (Scotland), (AP): Everyone feels their wedding 

is special, but for Karen Watts and Martin Reijns it was also historic. The couple 

wed in the first legal marriage ceremony in Britain categorised as neither religious 

nor civil. The ceremony at Edinburgh zoo was led by a humanist celebrant, one 

of 12 members of the Humanist Society of Scotland granted the right to legally 

conduct marriages by the countrys registrar general starting June 1. Humanists 

believe in leading moral lives by using reason instead of religious doctrine or 

god worship, said Ivan Middleton, the celebrant who married the couple.

 Fat kids 

Beijing (Reuters): China, enjoying rapidly rising incomes 

and an increasingly rich diet, will have at least 200 million obese people in 

10 years, official media reported on Saturday. Among the obese, children 

are the most disturbing, the official Xinhua news agency said, quoting a 

doctor at a hospital in Guangdong.

 province. Ten per cent are obese and the number is undergoing an annual 8 percent increase. Thanks to official policy discouraging women from having more than one child, many Chinese families have just one boy or girl doted on by six adults: two parents and four grandparents.

 And in a country that suffered mass starvation only a few decades ago, it is difficult to persuade those grandparents not to give the child just a little bit more to eat. Xinhua said Chinas traditionally slim population of 1.3 billion included more than 90 million obese people ? whose weight exceeded the standard by 20 per cent.

 Cause chains bras

 Nicosia, July 5 (Reuters): Britains first woman speaker of the House of Commons is aiding a bra collection on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus with her own tarty offering to raise breast cancer awareness.

 British women on the island plan to make the worlds longest chain of bras to heighten breast cancer awareness and raise funds for research. Labour peer Baroness Betty Boothroyd, a former dancer who was Britains first woman speaker in parliament and is now a member of the House of Lords, has given to the cause. 

 In her own words it is a rather tarty red one, the Cyprus Mail daily reported.

 Smokers in UK face complete ban

 TOBY HELM AND DUNCAN GARDHAM

 London, Oct. 24: The British cabinet will debate today on a wider than expected ban on smoking that will cover private clubs as well as all pubs and restaurants.

 The ban will mean an end to smoking at places of work, probably within two years, although companies and licensed premises will be able to provide sin bin rooms for employees or customers who wish to smoke. In an unexpected extension of the ban, Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, has decided to include membership clubs, such as golf, other sports clubs and gentlemens clubs.

 The move represents a significant tightening of the policy presented to voters at the May election. Labours manifesto promised that private members clubs ? and pubs that do not serve food ? would be free to choose to allow smoking or be smoke-free.

 But Hewitt decided that such a policy, which was drawn up by her predecessor John Reid, a former heavy smoker, was completely unworkable.

 The pressure for change grew after research suggested that pubs in poorer areas would stop serving food in order to allow smoking.

 The plans are expected be published in a bill on Wednesday, showing how urgently ministers view the problem of smoking-related illnesses. 

 But there is a price for the government to pay in reducing smoking: the treasury receives around ?8 billion in tax from tobacco sales. Smoking will be banned in all public places in Scotland next year and North Ireland will follow in 2007.

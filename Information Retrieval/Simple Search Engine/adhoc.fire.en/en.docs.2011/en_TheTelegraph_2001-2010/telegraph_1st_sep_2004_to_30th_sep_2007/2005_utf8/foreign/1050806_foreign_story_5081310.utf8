 Dylans Stone hits number one spot

 HUGH DAVIES

 Bob Dylan in 1965

 London, Aug. 5: Bob Dylans Like A Rolling Stone ? the song that, according to Bruce Springsteen, sounded like somebodyd kicked open the door to your mind ? was yesterday judged the most important of 100 music, movie and television moments that have changed the world.

 Uncut magazine polled industry experts, musicians and actors for their seminal experiences in the past 50 years. Dylan just edged out the day that rock roll finally took off across the world ? the first radio broadcast of Elvis Presleys Heartbreak Hotel.

 Dylans single, recorded in 1965 for his influential album Highway 61 Revisited, was remarkable for its lyrics. Griel Marcus, his biographer, said the phrase: How does it feel? does not just come out of his mouth, it explodes, with Al Cooper on organ seemingly determined to catch every fragment of the song as it flies away.

 Heralded as the first six-minute single, it was originally issued on a double-sided 45 to allow radio stations to keep to their three-minute rule. However, DJs soon came under fire from fans for cutting it and started taping both sides to broadcast the song in full.

 The Presley track was a breakthrough moment for young people in Britain already stirred by Bill Haleys Rock Around The Clock. Recorded at RCA studios in Nashville in 1956, with Bill Black on base and Scotty Moore on lead guitar, Heartbreak Hotel was just two minutes 11 seconds long. But with its use of reverberation and echo chamber, the recording became an instant classic.

 British listeners first heard it on the American Forces Network, broadcast on a Saturday night. They had to wait six months for the single to be shipped from America.

 Sir Paul McCartney said it was his first choice in the poll. Its the way he sings it as if he is singing from the depths of Hell. His phrasing, use of echo, its all so beautiful. Musically its perfect.

 In third place was Sir Pauls classic Beatles song She Loves You, written with John Lennon after a concert at the Majestic ballroom in Newcastle while touring with Roy Orbison in 1963. Lennon said they had the main catch phrase and suddenly realised we needed more, so we added yeah, yeah, yeah, and it caught on.

 At number four is (I Cant Get No) Satisfaction by the Rolling Stones. The lyrics and distinctive guitar riff were thought up by Keith Richards in a hotel in Clearlake, Florida, during the Stones third US tour in 1965. 

 Patti Smith said of the Dylan song: I absolutely remember where I was when I first heard it. It got me through adolescence.

 The magazine consulted a range of experts, among them Sir Paul, Keith Richards, Noel Gallagher, the former Beach Boy Brian Wilson and Lou Reed.

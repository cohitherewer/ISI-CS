 Baghdad, April 5 (Reuters): Gunmen kidnapped an Iraqi army general in western Baghdad, police said today, the latest insurgent abduction of a top Iraqi official.

 Police said Brigadier General Jalal Mohammed Saleh was pulled from his car. He was the commander of a special armoured division, one of the first armoured units in the re-formed Iraqi army.

 Insurgents have kidnapped several leading Iraqi officials and military officers. Some have been killed, with video footage of their deaths posted on the Internet.

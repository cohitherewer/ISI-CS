 Parasite puts Nepal in splits

 - Gyanendra 

 cartoons are serious stuff 

 BHARAT BHUSHAN 

 (Top) The Mak--Man 

 cartoon and (below) the caricature by Nepalese cartoonist 

 Batsyayana

 New Delhi, Aug. 26:

 Parasite: Mother of all parasites. 

 Scientific Name: Rigvedicus Ramapithicus Rexvishnucus. 

 Common Name: Abominable Apeman of Annapurna 

 Natural Habitat: Until June 2001 Rigvedicus Ramapithicus Pre-vishnucus was a tree dwelling animal in the Annapurna Conservation Area. Later shifted to Narayanhiti Palace, Kathmandu, and became Rexvishnucus. Travels aboard frequently. 

 Who do you think the cartoonist is talking about? Look for the formal name of this species. It says: Shree Panch Maharajadhiraj Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. Yes, the King of Nepal. And what is his son, with whom he is believed to be on backstabbing terms called? Psychopathus Parasites Rakshas Rakshas!

 The mother of Parasites as they call King Gyanendra is depicted giving the middle finger to the Nepalese people while proclaiming We are all One. 

 Rexvishnucus, we are told, is supposed to be partial to drinking Famous Grouse whiskey along with smoking a black substance in the company of his son Psychopathus Parasites. It might be recalled that it was after drinking Famous Grouse whiskey and smoking a mysterious black substance that the then Crown Prince Deependra had allegedly carried out the massacre of the royal family. 

 What on earth is going on, one might wonder? Some expatriate Nepalese in Minnesota, USA, calling themselves Gang of Four have started a cartoon strip under the name of Mak--Man exposing Nepali parasites ? from the royalty to press barons and human rights activists. And this is just a brief extract from their site www.geocities.com/man_mako. 

 Worthy of greats like Steve Bell whose cartoons in The Guardian newspaper made Margaret Thatchers entire cabinet a public laughing stock in the early 1980s, these Nepalese cartoonists are using humour to challenge everything and everyone held sacred in their society up to now. 

 Clearly Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz did not have the Nepalese monarchy and Nepalese people in mind when he said: We do not take humour seriously enough. The people of Nepal as well as the monarchy seem to take it seriously enough.

 This is what the Gang of Four has to say about their crime-fighter who exposes Nepalese parasites: Mak--Man or Macho Man is a modern day crime fighter. His mission is to rid the world of scum by unmasking them and showing their naked true selves. Mak--Man does not have superpowers or fancy costumes except white socks and black shoes. True to his mission, he fights crime with no clothes on. 

 Who is funding these cartoonists? No one, they claim: Mak--Man doesnt receive funds from any public source. That is where his power comes from. His silence cannot be bought. His mission cannot be stopped. Mak--Man doesnt claim to help the poor, usher in democracy, defend human rights... he only unmasks parasites.

 The Nepalese are clearly using humour to get around their painful political predicament while the government is busy suppressing anything that smacks of disrespect for the monarchy. While expatriate Nepalese can escape persecution and only have their sites banned, those in Nepal are paying for their political humour. 

 That humour can get you into serious trouble was made painfully clear to the editors of the two most widely read broadsheets of Nepal ? Narayan Wagle of Kantipur Dainik and Prateek Pradhan of The Kathmandu Post ? earlier this week. 

 The duo was sought to be interrogated by the government for publishing a cartoon by Batsyayana last Sunday which showed Girija Prasad Koirala, president of the Nepali Congress carrying the carcass of a donkey labelled Constitutional Monarchy after having picked it up from a garbage-bin. Originally, the bin was labelled Royal Garbage but the editors had removed the word garbage before publishing it. 

 But that did not end their problems with the government. Kantipur had to publish a clarification the very next day saying: We found that the cartoon published on Sunday has created confusion among the people vis-?-vis our editorial policy [on constitutional monarchy] ? This newspaper affirms its commitment to the constitutional monarchy and democracy. 

 Immediately after publishing the cartoon, the duo was summoned to the office of the Chief District Officer (CDO) of Kathmandu for interrogation. When the editors reached the office, they found officials of the information and communication ministry wanted to question them. They demanded a written authorisation for their questioning. The minister for information and communication Tanka Dahal, however, reportedly warned that the government was serious about the cartoon caper and was contemplating strictest action within the legal periphery. 

 Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post may or may not decide to behave after this warning but Mak--Man emanating from the US can go about his business of exposing parasites freely.

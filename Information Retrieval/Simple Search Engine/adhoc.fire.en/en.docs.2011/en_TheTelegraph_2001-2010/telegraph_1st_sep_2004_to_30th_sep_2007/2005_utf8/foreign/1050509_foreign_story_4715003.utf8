 Putin asks old club to stay together

 Moscow, May 8 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin today urged leaders of the 12-member club of ex-Soviet states, some of them already shifting to the West, to stick together to fight extremism and terrorism.

 Putin, avoiding controversy as he raised the curtain on three days of summits and parties marking the Allied victory over Nazi Germany, made no mention of the political about-face in four members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

 But, referring to a UN call to fight national extremism, terrorism, racism and xenophobia, he said: ?I am convinced the CIS is capable of becoming an effective instrument for such a joint fight.?

 Security forces threw a ring of steel around Red Square and the Kremlin ? focal points for celebrations tomorrow that will be attended by President George W. Bush and more than 50 other world leaders.

 The biggest danger comes from Chechen separatists who have staged deadly attacks throughout Putins five years in power and rarely let Victory Day pass without incident. Russia seeks help from CIS neighbours in efforts to cut their supply routes and end a campaign seen by many here as a threat to Russian unity.

 Ten of the 12 leaders attended the informal summit of the CIS, an ill-assorted alliance of states stretching from Central Asia on the border with China to the edge of the EU.

 It was an occasion for Putin to reflect on Russias waning influence, in a region where it once held absolute sway, as former colonies shift their allegiance from Moscow and towards a welcoming and more financially alluring West.

 Georgias pro-western leader boycotted because of a row with Moscow over Russian bases on its territory. Azerbaijans President stayed away because of tension with the Armenian leader over a disputed territory.

 But Ukraines Viktor Yushchenko, elected against Moscows wishes after a pro-western revolution late last year, was present as was the leader of Moldova who also wants to turn his tiny country away from Moscow.

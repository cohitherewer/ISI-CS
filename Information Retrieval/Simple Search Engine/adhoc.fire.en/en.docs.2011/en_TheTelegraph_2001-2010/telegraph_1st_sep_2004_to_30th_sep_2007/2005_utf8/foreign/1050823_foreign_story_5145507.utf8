 Blair office ends holiday blackout

 Blair: Barbados farce

 London, Aug. 22 (Reuters): Tony Blairs office ended an unprecedented news blackout on the British Prime Ministers summer holiday location today when a spokeswoman said he and his wife Cherie were staying in Barbados.

 Amid jitters after Julys bomb attacks on London, Blairs media chief David Hill wrote to media last month asking them not to report Blairs destination for security reasons.

 But the mystery unravelled after the Prime Minister accepted an invitation from the Barbados Legion to an event yesterday marking the end of World War II and the contribution made by the people of Barbados. As this was a public event, his protection team accept the location of his holiday will be reported, said a spokeswoman.

 British media had broadly observed Hills plea ? the first such request from the Prime Ministers Downing Street office.

 But at the same time newspapers ridiculed and criticised the decision to shroud the Blairs holiday destination in secrecy, noting that even President George W. Bush has made no attempt to disguise a summer stay at his Texas ranch. 

 Jitters about Blairs whereabouts are all to do with how it looks that he is sunning himself while we sweat through the threat in London, and hardly anything to do with security, columnist Alice Miles wrote in The Times last week.

 As Londons Madame Tussauds dressed their Blair waxwork in a Hawaiian shirt and put a white knotted handkerchief on his head, some media dropped heavy hints about the location. 

 Tabloid newspapers published photographs of beachwear-clad Blair and Cherie on a sun-drenched boat in sparkling blue water, but stopped short of naming the exact spot.

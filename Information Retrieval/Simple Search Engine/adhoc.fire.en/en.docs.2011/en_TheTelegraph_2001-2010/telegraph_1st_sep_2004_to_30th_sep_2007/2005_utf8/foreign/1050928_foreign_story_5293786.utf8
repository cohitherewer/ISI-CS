 Blogging leaves most people clueless

 London, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Proponents of the latest Web trends were warned today that the rest of the world may not have a clue what they are talking about.

 A survey of British taxi drivers, pub landlords and hairdressers ? often seen as barometers of popular trends ? found that nearly 90 per cent had no idea what a podcast is and more than 70 per cent had never heard of blogging.

 When I asked the panel whether people were talking about blogging, they thought I meant dogging, said Sarah Carter, the planning director at ad firm DDB London.

 Dogging is the phenomenon of watching couples have sex in semi-secluded places such as out-of-town car parks. News of such events are often spread on websites or by using mobile phone text messages.

 More people (56 per cent) understood the phrase happy slapping ? a teenage craze that involves assaulting people while capturing it on video with their mobile phones ? than podcasting (12 per cent) or blogging (28 per cent).

 Our research not only shows that there is no buzz about blogging and podcasting outside of our media industry bubble, but also that people have no understanding of what the words mean, Carter said. Its a real wake-up call.

 A blog, short for Web log, is an online journal, while podcasting is a method of publishing audio programmes over the Internet ? a name derived from combining iPod with broadcasting, even though portable devices are not necessary to listen to a podcast. DDB said the survey results indicate that agencies may be pushing their clients to use new technology too quickly.

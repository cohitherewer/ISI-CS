 Pop gets China ears

 Andy Lau

 Shanghai, March 16 (Reuters): China will let Cantopop star Andy Lau?s music into classrooms for the first time to spice up the lives of students bored by a decades-old diet of revolutionary tunes.

 This year?s list of 100 approved songs for mandatory music lessons in middle schools also includes pop songs by Taiwan hip-hop star Jay Chou and singer-songwriter Jonathan Lee, the Shanghai Daily reported today. ?We are always asked to sing monotonous revolutionary songs,? local student Wang Wenjia told the English-language newspaper. ?Finally, we can sing something of our own.? As recently as the early 1990s, some local schools banned students from listening to pop music on campus as an unwanted distraction.

 This years sanctioned pop songs were selected by the city?s education commission because they ?laud the good natures of the Chinese?, the newspaper said. For instance, Lau?s song Chinese proclaims: ?We are all Chinese?.

 Revolutionary songs have been sung since 1949 and have served as a tool to praise Mao Zedong and the Communist Party. But today?s youths, exposed to an increasingly materialistic culture, are tuning in to the thriving music industries of Hong Kong and Taiwan and disavowing the communist anthems of old.

 The newspaper said many students were simply bored with singing old patriotic songs praising the virtues of communism, such as Seeing Off The Red Army and Chairman Mao Is With Us Forever. 

 Andy Lau is a star of over 100 films and one of Asia?s most popular singers.

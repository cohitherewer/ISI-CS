 Fine Print

 Wonder weavers

 Tehran, Sept. 24 (Reuters): Iran is seeking to revive its carpet industry by weaving the worlds biggest rug, weighing in at 35 tonnes.

 The mammoth rug from the spiritual homeland of Persian carpets will cover almost 6,000 square metres and will fetch some $8.2 million, its makers said today.

 The carpet has been ordered by the Sheikh Zayed mosque that is being built in Abu Dhabi, after Iran scoured its Gulf neighbours for contracts.

 Surf sizzle

 Sydney (Reuters): An Australian surfer 

 survived a shark attack by repeatedly punching a small shark. 

 Brad Satchell, 44, was surfing near Perth on Friday when 

 he was attacked. I actually had a smile on my face 

 when I first saw the thing because I thought it was a seal, 

 Satchell said.

 Shoplifter slur on men

 SARAH WOMACK

 London, July 18: Women may be the dominant sex on the high street, but it is men who like going shopping for the wrong reason ? to steal, according to latest research.

 Not only do more men end up in prison for shoplifting and theft, but they are older, more organised and stealing expensive goods to order, which explodes the myth of store theft being a young, opportunistic and harmless offence, says the report.

 Terrorism and drugs are funded by shoplifting, said David Nuttall, a security expert. It is big business. 

 Theft by staff is also on the increase but differs from shoplifting in its offender profile and pattern. 

 The report, by the Centre for Retail Research, was commissioned to look at new strategies and technologies that make it easier to identify and tackle shop theft.

 According to the figures compiled by Prof. Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR, out of a prison population of 75,000 there are currently 1,200 women behind bars for retail-related crimes, compared with 4,000 men. Prof. Bamfield, author of the European Retail Theft Barometer ? which put the cost of retail crime across Europe at ?21 billion last year ? says there is not much to differentiate the amounts stolen by men and women, averaging ?83 per offence. 

 But as they get older the gap widens. Between the ages of 21 and 23, men steal an average of ?163.64, compared with ?92.84 for women, although female retail crime tends to carry on longer.

 However, there are some anomalies in the findings. Anecdotal evidence suggests that womens criminal behaviour tends to tail off when they get married. The figures suggest that there are fewer married women actively involved in customer theft.

 Women target clothes, grocery, perfumery, toiletries and health products with men going for television sets, hairdryers, electric toothbrushes, power tools and CDs.

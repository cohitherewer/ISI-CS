 Rescuers in race against time, shocks rattle islands

 Gunungsitoli (Indonesia), March 31 (Reuters): Rescuers raced to pull survivors from collapsed buildings and deliver urgently needed food and water today as strong aftershocks rattled earthquake-devastated islands in northern Indonesia.

 Nearly three days after the huge quake, several people were pulled alive from the rubble of their homes, but they were greatly outnumbered by dead bodies and aid officials warned the toll could rise as rescuers reach remote areas.

 French firefighters in worst-affected Nias island pulled a woman from the rubble of her home alive early in the morning, footage shot by Australias Seven Network television showed. ?Hot, hot,? the long-haired woman identified as Suri said after being pulled out. ?My daughter and my sister are dead.?

 Rescuers also pulled an 11-year-old boy from the wreckage of a five-storey building today, his only injury a small cut on his toe. ?He was dehydrated, he was nervous, but also excited about being found,? said Olaf Lingjarde, a Norwegian firefighter, who added that the chances of finding survivors were growing slim.

 Three or four international rescue teams, Singaporeans and volunteers from places such as Norway, along with hundreds of Indonesian troops are scouring the rubble looking for survivors.

 As many as 2,000 people are feared to have died, many of them trapped under the rubble, according to Indonesian officials. A UN statement said some 500 were confirmed killed.

 Several hundred people are reported to have died on the isolated Banyak island group just north of Nias. Simeulue island, also to the north of Nias, suffered widespread damage as well.

 Aid officials said relief supplies were flowing better today, but water and food remained in short supply.

 ?There?s very little water and people are panicking,? Jude Barrand, spokeswoman for aid agency SurfAid International, said from northern Medan city.

 ?They?re hungry, there?s no food. The market was destroyed.?

 The UN?s World Food Programme estimated 200,000 Nias residents would need food aid for about two months. Government data show 700,000 residents on the island.

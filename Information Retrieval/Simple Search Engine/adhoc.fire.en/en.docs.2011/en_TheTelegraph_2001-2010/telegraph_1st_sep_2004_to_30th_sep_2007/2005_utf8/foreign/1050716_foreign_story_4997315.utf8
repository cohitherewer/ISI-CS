 Tiger threat to break truce

 Colombo, July 15 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tiger rebels said today they would violate a three-year ceasefire and carry arms in military-held areas unless the government safeguarded their cadres following attacks in the restive east.

 As a two-week rebel ultimatum seeking safety assurances lapsed, the Tigers vowed to make their own security arrangements and use armed escorts unless measures were taken immediately.

 Analysts and diplomats say the standoff could spark an armed confrontation, breaking the truce and raising the spectre of a return to a civil war that has already killed over 64,000 people.

 Please be advised that we will be forced to resort to our means and modes of transport if suitable action is not taken, LTTE political wing head, S.P. Thamilselvan, said in a letter to the Nordic monitors of the 2002 ceasefire, who act as intermediaries with the government. 

 If... the military attempts to prevent or hinder such travel, we would be compelled to act suitably, he added. Under the truce, the rebels can move through government areas. But dozens of rebel cadres, police, soldiers and civilians have been killed in recent months despite the ceasefire.

 Sri Lankas military said it killed a Tiger cadre in a firefight in the islands eastern district of Trincomalee last night. 

 The army has beefed up patrols as tension escalates over the violence, which it blames on feuding between the mainstream rebels and a renegade faction.

 The Tigers closed their political offices in government-held areas in the east yesterday and pulled their cadres back to pockets of jungle they control.

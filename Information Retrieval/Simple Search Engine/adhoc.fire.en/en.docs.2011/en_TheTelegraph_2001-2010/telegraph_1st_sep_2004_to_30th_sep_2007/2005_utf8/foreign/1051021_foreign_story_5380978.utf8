 Taliban-burning slur on US

 Sydney, Oct. 20 (Reuters): Australian television yesterday broadcast footage of what it said was US soldiers burning the corpses of two dead Taliban fighters with their bodies laid out facing Mecca and using the images in a propaganda campaign in southern Afghanistan.

 The television report said US soldiers burnt the bodies for hygienic reasons but then a US psychological operations unit broadcast a propaganda message on loudspeakers to Taliban fighters, taunting them to retrieve their dead and fight.

 A US military statement released in Afghanistan said Army criminal investigators had launched a probe into alleged misconduct by US service members, including the burning of dead enemy combatant bodies under inappropriate circumstances.

 This command does not condone the mistreatment of enemy combatants or the desecration of their religious and cultural beliefs, Major General Jason Kamiya said.

 This alleged action is repugnant to our common values, is contrary to our commands approved tactical operating procedures, and is not sanctioned by this command.

 In Washington, the Pentagon expressed concern. These are very serious allegations and, if true, very troublesome, spokesman Bryan Whitman said.

 It is the policy of the US, as well as the defence department, to treat all remains consistent with the Geneva Convention and with the utmost respect. These allegations will be aggressively investigated and, if proven to be true, the individuals will be held appropriately accountable, Whitman said.

 The Dateline current affairs programme on the ethnic Special Broadcasting Service said the story was filmed in early October. The footage of the burning corpses was shot by Australian photojournalist Stephen DuPont, who was embedded with a US unit.

 Dateline said the two Taliban fighters burnt on hills above the village of Gondaz, north of Kandahar, were killed by the US soldiers the night before. The footage showed flames licking two charred corpses, their legs and arms outstretched, and a group of five US soldiers standing watching from a rocky ledge.

 Footage showed two US soldiers reading from a notebook two messages that they said had earlier been broadcast.

 Attention Taliban you are cowardly dogs, read the first soldier, identified as Sergeant Jim Baker.

 You allowed your fighters to be laid down facing west and burnt. You are too scared to retrieve their bodies. This just proves you are the lady boys we always believed you to be.

 The other unidentified soldier read a second message, part of which said: You attack and run away like women. You call yourself Talibs but you are a disgrace to the Muslim religion.

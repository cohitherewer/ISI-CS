 Save your teeth, stop smoking

 London, July 18 (Reuters): Smokers are more than 6 times more likely to develop gum disease than non-smokers but kicking the habit can prevent them from losing their teeth prematurely, according to new research published today.

 Scientists at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in England have shown that chronic gum disease in smokers significantly improves after they quit.

 Our study shows that people should stop smoking now if they want to increase their chances of keeping their teeth into old age, said Dr Philip Preshaw, a specialist in gum disease who reported the findings in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology.

 Smokers are more prone to chronic gum disease than non-smokers because the habit has a detrimental effect on the bodys immune system. Their bodies are less well equipped to fight the build up of bacteria in plaque that accumulates on the teeth.

 The bacteria causes the gums to become inflamed, recede and bleed.

 Fierce storm batters UK coasts

 London, Jan. 12 (Reuters): A fierce storm packing winds of up to 200 kmph battered Scotland and Northern Ireland, killing three people and leaving tens of thousands without electricity, police and emergency services said today.

 In Northern Ireland?s second city, Londonderry, a man was killed when the vehicle he was driving was blown off a bridge and plunged 30 metres onto a riverbank.

 A second driver was killed in eastern Scotland when a lorry rolled onto his car. The storm, one of the strongest to hit northern Britain in a decade, was blamed for a third death in Dundee, Scotland, but details were not immediately available.

 Scottish Hydro Electric said 60,000 people had lost power and repairs were delayed by the weather, which brought heavy rain and snow to some areas.

 A Spanish fishing trawler carrying 19 crew went missing overnight in rough waters about 190 km off the coast of Scotland, but was later spotted by a Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft.

 ?It appears all on board are safe,? an RAF spokesman said. With possible widespread damage to trees, structural damage to buildings and coastal flooding at high tides, the Met office warned motorists and others to avoid unnecessary travel.

 ?Driving conditions will become extremely dangerous. High-sided vehicles could be easily overturned, especially if unladen,? it said in a warning for northern Scotland.

 The severe weather followed a storm that killed three people, caused rivers to overflow and widespread damage to parts of northern Britain at the weekend.

 European havoc

 More than 250,000 homes and businesses were without power today as work crews from Denmark to Lithuania moved to clean up debris in a fierce storm that claimed 11 lives. 

 In southern Sweden, seven people were killed during the storm, which packed hurricane-strength winds, including four motorists who died after trees fell onto their cars. Another man was killed when bales of hay stacked at his farm overturned, crushing him, police said.

 In neighbouring Denmark, four people died when hit flying debris or trees crashed onto them. Several western Denmark towns were flooded by the rising sea and residents piled sandbags to prevent the water from entering their homes.

 Some 219,000 homes in Sweden remained without power and electricity companies said it was gradually being restored. 

 Some 12,500 homes were still without electricity in western Denmark.

 Across the Baltic Sea, nearly 40 per cent of Latvia and thousands more in neighbouring Estonia and Lithuania were still without power.

 The storm, which meteorologists say was among the worst to hit the region in four decades, brought 145 kmph gusts that ripped roofs from homes and damaged property in coastal towns and villages.

 Flying gift

 Chicago (Reuters): If that Hummer is 

 draining your cash at the petrol pump, Neiman Marcus Group 

 Inc has the perfect holiday gift: a fuel-efficient, $3.5 

 million Skycar that flies 350 miles per hour 

 and burns environmentally friendly alcohol. The M400 Skycar 

 prototype is a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft that 

 is designed to be as safe as an automobile.

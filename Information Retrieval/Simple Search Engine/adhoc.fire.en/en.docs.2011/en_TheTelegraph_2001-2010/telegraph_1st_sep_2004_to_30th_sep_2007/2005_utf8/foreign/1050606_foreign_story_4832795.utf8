 Britain bid to dump EU constitution

 London, June 5 (Reuters): Britain is tomorrow expected to consign the EU constitution to limbo after voters in France and the Netherlands overwhelmingly rejected it.

 But, afraid of being the first government to publicly declare it dead and therefore bear the blame for its demise, the move is likely to take the form of an indefinite postponement of the government bill paving the way for a promised referendum.

 A spokesperson for Prime Minister Tony Blair said today that foreign secretary Jack Straw would make a statement on the constitution to parliament tomorrow, but following parliamentary protocol she declined to hint at its content.

 However, Anthony King, professor of politics at Essex University, had no such qualms. I will be amazed if Straw doesnt explicitly or implicitly make it clear that Britain will not go ahead with the referendum plans, he said. 

 My guess is that he will signal ? even if he doesnt say in as many words ? that he and the British government regard the constitution as dead, he said.

 Advocates argue the constitution is needed to streamline the blocs unwieldy bureaucracy and decision-making process, while opponents say it centralises power in Brussels and reduces national governments to bit players.

 Ten EU countries, accounting for about half the blocs population, have approved the constitution but the rejections by France and Holland have triggered doubts about if it remains viable. Opinion polls in Denmark, Portugal, Poland and the Czech Republic ? once favourable to the constitution ? have tumbled since the French and Dutch rejections.

 The official position in Britain, which takes the helm of the 25-nation EU in July for six months, is that everything should wait for the EU summit on June 16 to mark the end of Luxembourgs presidency.

 That period of abeyance holds despite a call yesterday after an emergency meeting of French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for ratification to proceed at full speed.

 Blair, in power for a third and final term and keen to secure a legacy other than the unpopular Iraq war, has long declared an ambition to put Britain at the heart of Europe.

 But while ratification of the constitution could have been just the epitaph he is looking for, deeply Eurosceptic Britons were unlikely to have done him the favour.

 I suspect that Blair would have liked the constitution to have been adopted by the whole of Europe ? after all the British government put a lot of effort into drafting it, King said. 

 But now that the French and the Dutch have said no, Tony Blair has got off a political hook because it would have been rejected by the British people, he said.

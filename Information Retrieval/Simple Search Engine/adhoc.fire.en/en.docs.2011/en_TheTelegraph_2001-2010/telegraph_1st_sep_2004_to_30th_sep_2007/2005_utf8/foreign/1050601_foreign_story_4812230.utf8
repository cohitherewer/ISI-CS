 Villepin new PM

 Paris, May 31 (Reuters): French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin became the first victim of a crisis over the EUs constitution today as EU leaders braced for Dutch voters to follow France by rejecting the new charter.

 President Jacques Chirac accepted Raffarins resignation and appointed loyal ally Dominique de Villepin ? an opponent of the US-led war in Iraq ? to replace him in a shake-up that had become inevitable after voters rejected the constitution.

 The result of Sundays referendum has plunged the 25-nation EU as well as France into crisis. Those problems are likely to deepen when the Netherlands holds a referendum on the treaty tomorrow because opinion polls point to another heavy defeat.

 We had hoped for a neck-and-neck race (but) ... it looks as if it is going to be a No vote, Dutch foreign minister Bernard Bot told CNN.

 Concerns that the charter, intended to ensure the enlarged EU runs smoothly, is now close to death helped drive the euro down to new seven-month lows against the dollar and unsettled stocks and bonds.

 The euro sank as low as $1.2312 today before rising back to $1.2317. This reflected the EUs problems with which France is the traditional driving force of European integration.

 The magnitude of the French No was surprising and it is likely to be No with a fairly large margin in the Netherlands, and it terms of investor sentiment it raised political uncertainty, said Adam Cole, a senior currency strategist.

 Nine countries representing nearly half the EUs 454 million citizens have approved the constitution, but Denmark, due to vote on September 27, said next months EU summit must decide if ratification should proceed in remaining member states.

 The EUs first constitution sets new rules for the union designed to make decision-making easier after it took in 10 new members last year, mostly from eastern Europe, but it requires the backing of all 25 member states to go into force.

 Despite the deep crisis in France over the charter, Chirac has ignored calls to quit. But he made Raffarin the scapegoat and signalled he would make some policy adjustments to take account of voters dissatisfaction which is as much to do with domestic politics as with disillusionment with the EU.

 As a loyal ally, Villepin will have the task of steadying the ship of state as Chirac considers whether to seek a third term as president in an election due in 2007.

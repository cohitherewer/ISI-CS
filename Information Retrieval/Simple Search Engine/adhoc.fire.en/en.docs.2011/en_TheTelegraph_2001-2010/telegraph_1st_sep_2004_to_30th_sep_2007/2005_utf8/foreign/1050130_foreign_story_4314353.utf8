 Pak raid for Peres report

 Karachi, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Unidentified armed men ransacked offices of Pakistan?s largest media group in Karachi today, apparently in protest against the companys interview with Israeli deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres, management said.

 At least 25 armed men stormed the offices of the daily Jang and the Geo television station, both owned by the Jang Group, beating security guards and employees, and damaging furniture. Police said the attackers also fired dozens of shots in the air and damaged parked cars but no one was hurt.?They were chanting Allah-u-Akbar ,? said Azhar Abbas, director of news at Geo Television. ?It could be a reaction to an interview with Shimon Peres.?

 Yesterday, Jang and Geo quoted Peres as saying that Israel and Pakistan should have direct public contact ?without being ashamed about it?. Muslim Pakistan has no diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. ?We cannot blame any political or religious group as we don?t know who the attackers were,? said police officer Haseeb Beig. No group had yet claimed responsibility, he added. Media offices in Pakistan often face threats from political and religious groups, usually over coverage which offends their political and religious beliefs. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf drew strong criticism from Islamists at home for calling on his nation to consider recognising Israel if the West Asian peace process stayed on track.

Gas pipeline attacked

 Unidentified attackers blew up a natural gas pipeline in eastern Pakistan, disrupting supplies, officials said today, the second such attack in less than a month. A spokesman for the Sui Northern Gas Co, which distributes gas to central and northern Pakistan, said an 18-inch diameter pipeline was ruptured last night near Lahore, causing disruption in supplies to the city.

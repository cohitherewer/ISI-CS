 Dark chocolate good for heart

 Washington, July 19 (Reuters): Dark chocolate can not only soothe your soul but can lower blood pressure too, researchers reported today.

 The study, published by the American Heart Association, joins a growing body of research that show compounds found in chocolate called flavonoids can help the blood vessels work more smoothly, perhaps reducing the risk of heart disease.

 Previous studies suggest flavonoid-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, tea, red wine and chocolate, might offer cardiovascular benefits, but this is one of the first clinical trials to look specifically at dark chocolates effect on lowering blood pressure among people with hypertension, said Jeffrey Blumberg of Tufts University in Boston, who led the study.

 This study is not about eating more chocolate, Blumberg added. It suggests that cocoa flavonoids appear to have benefits on vascular function and glucose sensitivity. Scientists are far from being able to make specific recommendations for patients based on their research on chocolate, and nutritionists have urged people to be cautious because chocolate is high in fat, sugar and calories.

 Writing in the journal Hypertension, Blumbergs team said when the volunteers ate the special dark chocolate, they had a 12 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) and a 9 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) on average. Blood pressure did not change when the volunteers ate white chocolate.

 Lahore, April 17 (Reuters): The husband of Pakistan opposition leader-in-exile Benazir Bhutto said today despite police action against his supporters his party would engage the government in a dialogue to promote democracy.

 Asif Ali Zardari was briefly detained yesterday upon his arrival in the eastern city of Lahore from a visit to his wife in Dubai and he said up to 70,000 of Pakistan Peoples Party workers were detained to prevent them from holding a rally.

 ?We will condemn this action on all forums, we will go to the court and also raise it in parliament. They choked the entire country,? Zardari told a news conference.

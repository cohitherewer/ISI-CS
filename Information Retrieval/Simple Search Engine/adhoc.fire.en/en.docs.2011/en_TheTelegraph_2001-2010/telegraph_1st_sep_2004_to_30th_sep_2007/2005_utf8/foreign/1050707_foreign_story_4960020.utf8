 Los Angeles, July 6 (Reuters): Angelina Jolie is adopting a newborn Ethiopian girl orphaned by AIDS, People magazine reported yesterday.

 Jolie, who has toured the world as goodwill ambassador for the UN High Commissioner on Refugees, said the baby would be named Zahara Marley Jolie but would not reveal the childs age, height or weight, People said.

 The magazine had no further information on the babys health but said she had been left an orphan by AIDS.

 Jolie, 30, told People that she and her son Maddox, 3, who she adopted from a Cambodian orphanage, were very happy to have a new addition to our family.

 Arrangements for the adoption were expected to be completed today.

 Angies over the moon, a source close to the actor told People. Its a dream come true. Shes always wanted to extend her family.

 Jolie has been romantically linked with Brad Pitt, her Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith co-star, but the source denied they were planning a family.

 This has nothing to do with her relationship with Brad Pitt. 

 People are going to try to say its about their relationship. But its not. Angelinas adopting as a single mother and she wants that emphasised, the source told People. The twice-divorced Jolie has often talked of adopting a second child. 

 After a trip to Ethiopia earlier this year, Jolie said of Maddox: My son is in love with Africa, so he has been asking for an African brother or sister.

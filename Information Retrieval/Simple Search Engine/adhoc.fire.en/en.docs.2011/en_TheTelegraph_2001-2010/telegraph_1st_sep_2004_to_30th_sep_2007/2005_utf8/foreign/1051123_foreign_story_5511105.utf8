 Nike air scare

 Portland, Oregon, Nov. 22 (Reuters): A Nike Inc. corporate jet carrying chief executive William Perez and other executives landed safely at an Oregon airport on Monday after a landing gear problem forced it to circle over Portland for hours.

 Its nice to be on the ground, Perez told reporters shortly after landing, I wasnt at all worried the whole time.

 Also among the seven people on board were Nike Brand co-president Charlie Denson and Mary Kate Buckley, vice-president and general manager of the Americas region.

 With its right-wing landing gear stuck in its bay, the Gulfstream jet landed with its wheels down and slowed to a safe halt, TV pictures showed.

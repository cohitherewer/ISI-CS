 Bali bomber caught on video

 Kuta (Indonesia), Oct. 2 (AFP): Indonesian police today showed a chilling video of one of the Bali suicide bombers walking into a restaurant packed with holidaymakers before exploding in a ball of fire.

 This is a suicide bombing, this is our intention in showing this video, Bali police chief Made Mangku Pastika said at a press conference where the footage was aired.

 The video (images in Reuters picture on left), shot by a man whose identity is being kept secret for his protection, showed the bomber enter the Raja restaurant in Balis Kuta entertainment district and walk slowly between the busy tables. He appeared in the background of the shot, behind dozens of customers including western and Asian tourists, all talking and laughing and unaware of what was to follow.

 The bomber reached the back of the room and entered the kitchen, which was screened off from the dining room by a chest-high partition, and was engulfed by a blinding flash.

 An explosion followed which tore apart the back of the restaurant. He said one person was killed other than the bomber. The victim was not identified but friends of Raja waiter Wayan Sudike said outside the morgue today that they had identified his body and were waiting to claim the remains so they could bury him.

 Pastika did not explain why the bomber chose an apparently less devastating position to detonate the bomb, and said authorities were probing whether the device was operated by a timer or set off by the suspect himself. 

 A British educated bomber, Azahari bin Husin, is suspected of masterminding the near simultaneous attacks, a media report said today. The 48-year-old Husin, who completed a doctorate at Reading University in the 1990s before being trained with the al Qaida, is known in his native Malaysia as demolition man, the Sunday Times said. Azahari learnt his bomb-making craft in one of Osama bin Ladens Afghan training camps, it said.

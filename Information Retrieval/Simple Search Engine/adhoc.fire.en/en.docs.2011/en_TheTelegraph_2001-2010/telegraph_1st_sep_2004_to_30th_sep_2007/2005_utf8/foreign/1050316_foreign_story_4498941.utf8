 India scare for UK science

 AMIT ROY

 London, March 15: Gordon Brown, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), is expected to put more money into science in his budget tomorrow so that Britain does not lag behind China and India.

 ?We have got to do something if we don?t want to live in a world by the time you and me are claiming our pensions in which China and India have overtaken us,? said Peter Cotgreave, director of the Save British Science pressure group.

 ?We are just some fiddling little wet island off the coast of Europe, wittering on about how we used to have an empire,? he added.

 Ahead of the budget, the government today announced extra funding of ?100 million which will be available to businesses to enable them to ?take new ideas off the drawing board and into the marketplace?.

 The science and innovation minister, Lord Sainsbury, said: ?To keep Britain at the leading edge of the global economy it is essential that we invest in new technologies.?

 Areas the government is keen to develop include the ?automotive, energy and aerospace sectors?. Tackling issues like climate change is also at the forefront, with zero emission enterprises and emerging energy technologies highlighted as priority areas. Other areas are advanced materials, biopharmaceutical bioprocessing and micro amp; nanotechnology.

 The problem for the government is not simply one of pumping in more money into science, although that will undoubtedly help. It is one of changing cultural attitudes and encouraging children to become more enthusiastic about science at school.

 This is well nigh impossible in a country where the role models for children are either footballers, pop singers, soap actors and actresses and Page 3 girls. 

 If David and Victoria Beckham can become hugely rich without mastering the secrets of DNA, children cannot see why they should. The nation?s number one female role model is ?Jordan? (real name Katie Price), a model famed not for the size of her brain but her breasts. Even Indian children would today much rather go into acting, adding to a real crisis in science.

 The Confederation of British Industry has just said that encouraging girls to study science and maths and offering more help to working mothers would do more to close the gender pay gap than forcing companies to carry out an audit of their wage structures.

 Patricia Hewitt, the trade and industry secretary, has called for greater engagement and dialogue to help the UK retain its position as the best place in the world for science.

 A new and disturbing MORI research report, ?Science in Society?, showed that ?only 40 per cent of UK adults consider themselves very or fairly well informed about science? ? and this in a nation which gave Isaac Newton to the world.

 If today someone were to be hit on the head by an apple, he or she would consider ways of turning it into apple pie ? not surprising given that Jamie Oliver, a young chef, is one of the biggest personalities on TV and Nigella Lawson is revered as ?the domestic goddess?.

 Following publication of the report, Hewitt said: ?The UK has an excellent history of scientific achievement but with only four in ten people feeling informed about science and eight out of ten supportive of public consultation, now is the time for greater engagement and dialogue.?

 She said: ?There is a key role for the media to play in informing and engaging people. 

 ?Television and newspapers are the most commonly used method for people to find out about science, but seven out of ten people think the media sensationalise issues.?

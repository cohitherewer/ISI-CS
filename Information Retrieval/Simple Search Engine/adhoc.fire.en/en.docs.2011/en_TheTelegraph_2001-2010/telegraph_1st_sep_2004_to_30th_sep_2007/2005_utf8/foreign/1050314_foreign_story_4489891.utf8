 Full power falls into hands of Hu

 Beijing, March 13 (Reuters): Chinese President Hu Jintao vowed to protect the sovereignty of the world?s most populous nation today after being chosen head of the state Central Military Commission, completing the handover of power from Jiang Zemin.

 He urged the People?s Liberation Army (PLA) to perform its ?historical mission? a day before parliament votes on an anti-secession bill that allows the use of military force against Taiwan if the island which Beijing claims as its own formally declares statehood.

 Delegates to the National People?s Congress approved Hu?s election to the largely ceremonial post with loud applause and a near unanimous vote, the final step in a leadership transition that began when he took over the Communist Party helm in November 2002.

 An overwhelming 2,886 delegates cast their ballots for Hu, with six voting against him and five abstaining.

 Hu, 62, succeeded Jiang as state president in March 2003 and as head of the partys Central Military Commission last September. He now holds all the top positions as head of the party, military and state.

 ?I think this really reflects popular feeling in the country,? a delegate said as he filed out of the chamber in the Great Hall of the People after the secret ballot.

 Jiang, 78, who was known to enjoy the limelight during his 16-year reign, made no appearance in the assembly hall crawling with security and next to a Tiananmen Square emptied but for delegates? buses.

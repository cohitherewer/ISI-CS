 After fall, Madonna recovering

 Madonna: Horse tales

 London, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Madonna was recovering at home today after suffering several broken bones in a riding accident at her English country estate, her spokeswoman said.

 The singer cracked three ribs and broke her collar bone and a hand when she fell off her horse yesterday at Ashcombe House, where she had been celebrating her 47th birthday with husband Guy Ritchie and two children Lourdes and Rocco. She is recovering at home, spokeswoman Barbara Charone said.

 Madonnas New York publicist said the American artist was riding a new horse at the time of the fall. She was treated at a local hospital in Salisbury, a city about 144 km southwest of London, and later discharged.

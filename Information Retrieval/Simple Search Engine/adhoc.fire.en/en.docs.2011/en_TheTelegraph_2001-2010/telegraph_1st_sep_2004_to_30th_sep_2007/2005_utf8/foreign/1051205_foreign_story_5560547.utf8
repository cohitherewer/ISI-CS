 Sexsomnia, what?

 Toronto, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Ontario plans to review a court decision that acquitted a man of sexual assault charges because he suffers from sexsomnia and was asleep at the time of the incident.

 Luedecke, 33, has been acquitted of sexual assault charges because he said he was asleep during the attack. A sleep expert testified that Luedecke suffers from a disorder that causes sexsomnia ? involuntary sexual behaviour during sleep ? which he had experienced before. 

 The office of the attorney-general, which oversees the provinces prosecutions, said it needs to research its options for an appeal because of the strange circumstances of the case. 

 Bug bane

 New York (Reuters): Hotels offer many 

 amenities, but being eaten by bedbugs should not be one 

 of them, say two Swiss women suing a prominent Manhattan 

 hotel. The women want Hotel Pennsylvania and its owners 

 to pay unspecified damages for physical pain, mental anguish, 

 emotional distress and lost earnings. They say they were 

 repeatedly bitten by the insects while spending a week at 

 the hotel, one of the citys largest.

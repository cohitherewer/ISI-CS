 Pak promises to reopen Khan case

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Abdul Qadeer Khan

 Islamabad, Feb. 14: Pakistan today promised to re-open the investigation into nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan?s involvement in proliferation on the basis of fresh evidence. 

 ?Pakistan will confront Dr Khan and share information with the US and Great Britain, if they bring forth any fresh evidence on Khan?s involvement in nuclear proliferation,? foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said while addressing a joint press conference with his British counterpart Jack Straw.

 Kasuri was commenting on a report that appeared in The Sunday Telegraph which said Pakistani officials had admitted during private talks with senior EU officials in Brussels last January that Khan aided Tehran in acquiring nuclear technology.

 Pakistan faced international criticism after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) revealed in 2003 that Khan and a few of his close associates at Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), the country?s premier uranium enrichment facility, aided the illegal nuclear programmes of Iran, Libya and North Korea.

 After several months of investigations, Khan was found to be involved in the illegal business but pardoned for being revered at home as a ?national hero?. 

 He also admitted his involvement in nuclear proliferation, saying his decision was based on ?error of judgment?.

 The newspaper reported that the EU officials were told that cooperation between Tehran and Khan and his KRL associates began in the mid-1990s and included more than a dozen meetings over several years.

 Kasuri said both President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair have expressed satisfaction and appreciated Pakistan?s support on the issue. 

 However, he neither confirmed nor denied the newspaper report, saying the press in Britain was as free and independent as in Pakistan. 

 ?What can I say about this report except making an observation that there are persons with strong views, who wish to keep the matter alive,? Kasuri said.

 Straw also avoided comments on the issue, saying he did not directly raise the issue with the Pakistani leadership.

 ?However, we have substantial confidence in President Musharraf and the government of Pakistan due to the way in which they were dealing with the issue in the aftermath of the IAEA?s revelation in respect of Dr A.Q. Khan,? the British foreign secretary said.

 Straw was also optimistic of finding a diplomatic solution to resolve the current standoff between the US and Iran over the latter?s nuclear programme.

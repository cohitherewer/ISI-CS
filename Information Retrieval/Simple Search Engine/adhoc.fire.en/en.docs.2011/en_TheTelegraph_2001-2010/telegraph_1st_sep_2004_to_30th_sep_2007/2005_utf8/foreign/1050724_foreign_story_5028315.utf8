 JLos store in a store to open in Chicago

 Jennifer Lopez

 Chicago, July 23: State Street, meet JLo. 

 Jennifer Lopez has selected Marshall Fields store on State Street as the first US store to house a boutique for her JLo line of products. The first JLo boutique opened in Moscow last year.

 Electric-pink cargo pocket knit pants, a faux crocodile leather clutch purse and a wild rose camisole with a removable garter belt are among items likely to be featured at the singer-actors store within a store.

 Planning with the Minneapolis-based Fields began in March.

 We kind of approached each other, explained Andy Hilfiger, president and co-founder of JLo parent company Sweetface Fashion and brother of designer Tommy Hilfiger. Our long-term plan is to open concept shops in many stores, but Chicago is such a brilliant start.

 Lopez, who began her design career in 2001, is set to open the Fields boutique on September 22, when shell also attend a fashion show highlighting her clothing. The event will benefit Childrens Memorial Hospital.

 Hilfiger said he hopes to open boutiques in department stores in New York, Miami, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

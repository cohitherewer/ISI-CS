 After 10 yrs of Hurley, Paltrow new Lauder face

 Paltrow: Stylish

 Los Angeles, May 24 (Reuters): Oscar-winning actor and new mother Gwyneth Paltrow will become the latest celebrity spokeswoman for makeup and fragrance icon Estee Lauder Cos. Inc., the company said yesterday.

 Terms of Paltrows multi-year contract were not disclosed.

 Gwyneth personifies the image of our brand, Aerin Lauder, the companys senior vice-president of global creative directions, said in a statement. She is aspirational and stylish while being grounded, family-oriented and approachable.

 The actor, 32, will begin appearing in print and television advertisements this holiday season as part of a 10-year anniversary celebration of Estee Lauders Pleasure fragrance line.

 Paltrow will also appear in other Estee Lauder fragrance and makeup ads, the company said in a statement.

 Also yesterday, Estee Lauder said long-time spokeswoman Elizabeth Hurley, 39, will become the new face of its Re-Nutriv skincare line. The British model-turned-actor, who has been the face of Estee Lauder for over a decade, will be featured in a new ad campaign for the Re-Nutriv brand later this year.

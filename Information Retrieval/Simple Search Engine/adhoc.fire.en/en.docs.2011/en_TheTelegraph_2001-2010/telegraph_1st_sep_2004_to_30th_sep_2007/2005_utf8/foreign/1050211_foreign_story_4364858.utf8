 Charles was keen on Camilla from the start

 Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles

 London, Feb. 10: The saga of Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles has spanned more than three decades.

 It was clear the heir to the throne was keen on country-loving, hunting fan Camilla from the start, especially when she jokingly mentioned that her maternal great-great-grandmother, Alice Keppel, was the long-time mistress of Charles? great-great-grandfather, Edward VII.

 Parker Bowles ? then Camilla Shand ? is said to have told the Prince: ?My great-great-grandmother was your great-great-grandfather?s mistress, so how about it??

 They first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970 and came across each other again in June 1972 at a London club. The two became very close but the relationship cooled when Charles joined the Royal Navy in 1971.

 Two years later Camilla married her long-standing admirer, army officer Andrew Parker Bowles. Throughout the late 1970s Charles and Camilla kept in contact and became close again towards the end of the decade. But Camilla did play a part in encouraging the match between Charles and Princess Diana, and it is thought he proposed to Diana in the Parker Bowles? vegetable garden.

 After his marriage, in July 1981, Charles remained close to Camilla. Diana was intensely jealous of her husband?s relationship with her and quizzed his aides about it constantly.

 Royal watcher Andrew Morton named Camilla as ?the other woman? in the Prince?s life and said the Princess referred to her as ?The Rottweiler?.

 It is thought after Charles and Diana drifted further and further apart, and following the birth of Prince Harry in 1984, he eventually returned to his old flame. The depth of their intimacy became clear in 1992 when the so-called ?Camillagate? tape surfaced.

 In the recording of a telephone conversation between the two, made in December 1989, Charles said: ?I love you? to Camilla and added many other highly personal endearments. Camilla has consistently maintained a dignified silence about her friendship with Charles, who said of her in the 1994 Jonathan Dimbleby TV documentary: ?Mrs Parker Bowles is a great friend of mine... a friend for a very long time. She will continue to be a friend for a very long time.?

 Diana later went on television to say there had been three people in the marriage and it had been too crowded.

 Camilla was now recognised everywhere and her comfortable, country-set life was turned upside-down. 

 Women threw bread rolls at her in a supermarket as she faced a public backlash. Camilla had become ?the marriage-wrecker?.

 No foreign Khan probe, says Musharraf

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 24: Pakistan today renewed its offer to re-open the probe into nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan?s involvement in proliferation on the basis of fresh evidence.

 However, it ruled out any foreign access to the scientist for questioning.

 ?If anybody still had questions for Dr Khan, they must ask us and we will interrogate him and share the results with them,? Musharraf said without naming US and Britain. He was speaking at a briefing for newspaper columnists, editors and senior journalists in Islamabad.

 Musharraf said in view of the sensitive nuclear issue, ?we cannot allow anybody to question him (Dr Khan)?. Pakistan is capable of doing it themselves, he added.

 Musharraf?s remarks came after The Sunday Telegraph reported that Pakistani officials had admitted during private talks with senior EU officials in Brussels last January that Khan aided Tehran in acquiring nuclear technology.

 Pakistan faced international criticism after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) revealed in 2003 that Khan and a few of his close associates at Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), the country?s premier uranium enrichment facility, aided the illegal nuclear programmes of Iran, Libya and North Korea.

 After several months of investigations, Khan was found to be involved in the illegal proliferation of nuclear knowhow but was pardoned as he was revered in Pakistan as a ?national hero?. 

 Soft image

 Musharraf today came down heavily on an Opposition alliance for its objection to government-sponsored activities like the Kite-flying festival on religious grounds. ?Such activities are helpful in promoting Pakistan?s soft and liberal image,? he said.

 Third day of protests in Nepal

 Kathmandu, Sept. 5 (Reuters): More than a dozen demonstrators were hurt in violent clashes with police today, the third day of protests against King Gyanendras seizure of power seven months ago, witnesses and party officials said.

 About 100 protesters were hauled into waiting police vans as thousands of activists from seven main political parties tried to enter the heart of Kathmandu where protests have been banned since Gyanendras February 1 power grab. Witnesses said police burst tear gas shells and used canes to break up the rally as activists emerged from a maze of alleys.

 Witnesses said more than a dozen protesters had been hurt in the baton charge and at least two had been rushed to hospital. The clashes followed yesterdays release of 160 pro-democracy activists, including former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who were detained at the weekend.

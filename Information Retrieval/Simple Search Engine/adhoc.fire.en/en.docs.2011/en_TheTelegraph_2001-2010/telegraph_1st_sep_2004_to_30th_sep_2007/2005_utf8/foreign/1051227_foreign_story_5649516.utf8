 Nun bun stolen

 Nashville, Tennesee, Dec. 26 

 (AP): A cinnamon bun that bears a striking likeness to Mother 

 Teresa has gone missing from coffee house where it was displayed.

 The owner, Bob Bernstein, arrived to find an early Christmas morning break-in and the world-famous pastry gone.

 Bernstein said he believes that the culprit is someone angry over the shop displaying the nun bun, which has been preserved with shellac. Money left next to it was not stolen. They went right for the bun, he said. Unfortunately I think its somebody who wanted to take it to destroy it.

 The nun bun gained worldwide attention in 1996 when a Bongo Java customer nearly took a bite of it before recognising the revered nun in the folds of flaky pastry.

 The bun was featured on World News programmes, the late show with David Letterman and was even mentioned on episodes of The Nanny and Mad about you.

 bongo java sold t-shirts, prayer cards and mugs with the buns image before mother teresa wrote a personal letter to the coffeehouse asking the sales be stopped. (ap) rpb 12261843 del

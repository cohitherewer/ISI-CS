 Annan accepts oil-for-food lapses

 United Nations, Sept. 7 (Reuters): UN secretary-general Kofi Annan accepted responsibility today for mismanagement of the oil-for-food programme in Iraq in an address to the Security Council on the investigation of the programme.

 The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism, he said after Paul Volcker, the head of a year-long probe, told the 15-nation council its members too shared the blame for failing to supervise the $64 billion program.

 The findings are deeply embarrassing to us all, Annan said. The inquiry committee has ripped away the curtain and shone a harsh light into the most unsightly corners of the organisations.

 The report by the Independent Inquiry Committee, headed by Volcker does not accuse Annan personally of wrongdoing but found that the cumulative management performance of the secretary-general fell short of the standard that the UN organisation should strive to maintain.

 Volcker told the council that the programme, which allowed Saddam Hussein to sell oil to buy food and choose his own customers,was a compact with the devil and the devil had means for manipulating the programme to his ends.

 He recommended the creation of a new chief operating officer with mandate for administration as well as a strong and independent oversight board, reforms still in dispute among UN members.

 The report said a major problem was that no one was in charge of the $64 billion program ? neither the Security Council, meant to supervise it, nor the UN secretariat headed by Annan. 

 The report said the former Iraqi President was able to divert $10 billion under oil-for-food, which began in late 1996 and ended in 2003. Of this, $1.8 billion was from revenues related to the programme, the Independent Inquiry Committee said.

 Another $8.4 billion came from smuggling oil to Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Turkey, with the knowledge of UN Security Council members, who were to enforce sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. The committees central conclusion is that the UN requires stronger executive leadership, thoroughgoing administrative reform and more reliable controls and auditing, the panel said

 The report also said Iraq paid more than $1 million in cash to bribe former UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali but investigators said they had no evidence he ever received the money.

 Boutros-Ghali was in office in 1996 when the programme was created that allowed Iraq to sell oil in order to buy food, medicine and offset the impact of 1990 UN sanctions.

 Zeta-Jones stalker

 Catherine Zeta-Jones

 Los Angeles, July 9 (Reuters): A woman with a girlish crush on Michael Douglas was sentenced to three years in prison yesterday for making death threats against his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones.

 Dawnette Knight, 34, pleaded no contest in a Los Angeles court to charges of stalking and making criminal threats against Zeta-Jones through dozens of phone calls and letters.

 The letters accused the Oscar-winning star of Chicago of being a gold digger who was having an affair with George Clooney and made chilling threats comparing her death to John F. Kennedy.

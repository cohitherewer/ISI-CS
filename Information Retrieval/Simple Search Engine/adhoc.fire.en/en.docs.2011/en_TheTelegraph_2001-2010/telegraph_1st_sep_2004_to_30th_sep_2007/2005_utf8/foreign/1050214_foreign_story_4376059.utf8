 Israel to free 500 Palestinians

 Jerusalem, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Israel?s cabinet today approved the release of 500 Palestinian prisoners in what Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called a goodwill gesture to bolster Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and build mutual trust.

 In a further step to support peace moves after Sharon and Abbas agreed on a ceasefire at a groundbreaking summit five days ago, Israel let more than 200 Palestinian labourers enter from the Gaza Strip for the first time in months.

 Abbas won a pledge from Islamic militants yesterday to keep a de facto truce while they weigh the ceasefire. In a major policy shift, the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups said they would not retaliate immediately for any Israeli military action.

 Government officials said the 500 prisoners could go free as early as Tuesday. Another 400 are due to be released in the next few weeks under a decision announced by Sharon last week.

 ?This is not an easy step, but this gesture possibly could help the Palestinian Authority solidify its rule and boost trust between the two sides,? a government statement quoted Sharon telling ministers. Their names will first be published on a government website, giving the public an opportunity to appeal against the release of individual prisoners in a fast-track legal procedure.

 Freedom for 8,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails is a highly emotive issue for Palestinians, who regard them as heroes of an uprising that began more than four years ago. 

 An Israeli government official said of the 500 slated for release, around half belonged to Abbas? mainstream Fatah faction and the others were members of militant groups.

 Hassan Abu Libdeh, a senior Palestinian official, welcomed approval of the prisoner release. ?However we reiterate that specific criterion should be adopted that would guarantee the release of all prisoners,? Abu Libdeh said. ?Priority should be given to women prisoners, teenagers and elderly prisoners.?

 Israel, which has refused to free prisoners convicted of attacks that caused deaths or serious injuries, agreed last week to set up a joint committee with the Palestinians on expanding the list.

 But an Israeli government official said the jailed son of Marwan Barghouthi would not be released despite reports he would be freed at Abbas? request. The father is a grassroots Fatah leader serving five life terms over the killing of Israelis.

 ?He has blood on his hands,? the official said about Qassam Barghouthi, who was detained in 2003 over what Israel described at the time as his membership in a ?terrorist group?. Israel?s Haaretz newspaper said he was also involved in a West Bank ambush which wounded an Israeli Arab.

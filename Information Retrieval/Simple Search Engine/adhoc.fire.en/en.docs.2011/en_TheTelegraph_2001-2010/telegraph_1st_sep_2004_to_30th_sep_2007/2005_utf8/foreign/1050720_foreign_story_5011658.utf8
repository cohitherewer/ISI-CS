 Warlord convicted in Britain

 SALLY POOK

 London, July 19: In the first successful prosecution of its kind in the world, a former mujahideen commander from Afghanistan who settled in Britain was convicted at the Old Bailey yesterday of waging a campaign of torture and kidnap in his homeland.

 The Crown Prosecution Service said the historic conviction clearly demonstrated that there was no hiding place for torturers and hostage takers. 

 Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, 42, controlled a key road that connected Pakistan with the Afghan capital, Kabul, via the Khyber Pass. He set up military checkpoints that enabled him to steal money and goods from travellers. 

 With up to 1,000 men under his command, he ordered the torture of civilians, who were beaten with rifle butts, hung from ceilings, attacked with rubber pipes and threatened with rape. Some had their ears cut off.

 Many were held in appalling conditions for months, either at the checkpoints or at a nearby prison. 

 Some witnesses said they had been tortured by Zardad himself.

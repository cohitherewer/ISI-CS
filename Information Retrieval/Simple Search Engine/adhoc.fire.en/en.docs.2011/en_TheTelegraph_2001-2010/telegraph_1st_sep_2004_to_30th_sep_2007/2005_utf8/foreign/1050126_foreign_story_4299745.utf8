 Patient blow to Jeb Bush

 Washington, Jan. 25 (Reuters): The US Supreme Court dealt a setback yesterday to Florida governor Jeb Bush?s efforts to keep a severely brain-damaged woman on life support despite the wishes of her husband.

 Without comment, the justices rejected Bush?s appeal of a Florida Supreme Court ruling that struck down a state law which had allowed him to intervene in the case of Terri Schiavo, who has been on a feeding tube since a 1990 heart attack. Doctors have testified she is in a ?persistent vegetative state.? Michael Schiavo, her husband and legal guardian, asked a Florida court to have the tube removed in 1998. 

 He testified that his wife told him she would not want to be kept alive under such conditions.

 Terri Schiavo?s parents, Mary and Robert Schindler, have argued that hope remains for their daughter and oppose removing the tube. Ken Connor, a Tampa attorney representing Bush, said the Florida governor had no additional legal remedies available to him but that a stay remained in place while a Florida appellate court hears appeals from the Schindler family.

 The parents have asked a trial judge in Florida to remove Michael Schiavo as his wife?s guardian. They said he has a conflict of interest because he has lived with another woman for several years and is the father of her two children. The high court?s denial of Bush?s appeal marked the second time the justices have refused to get involved in the dispute. The Supreme Court declined to consider Schiavo?s case in 2001.

 But after two more years of court battles, Schiavo?s feeding tube was removed in October 2003. At Bush?s request, Florida?s lawmakers quickly adopted a law allowing him to intervene, and the tube was re-inserted six days later.

 The Florida Supreme Court ruled in September that the law violated the constitutional separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. It said that if the legislature and governor were allowed to retroactively overturn court rulings, no judgment would ever be final.

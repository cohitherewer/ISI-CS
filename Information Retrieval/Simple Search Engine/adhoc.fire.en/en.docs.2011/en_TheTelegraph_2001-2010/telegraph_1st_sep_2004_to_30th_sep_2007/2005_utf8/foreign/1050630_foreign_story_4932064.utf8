 Thousands riot in poor China state

 Beijing, June 29 (Reuters): Thousands of Chinese rioted in a dispute sparked by a lopsided roadside brawl, set fire to cars and wounded six police officers in an outburst likely to worry communist leaders in Beijing desperate to cling on to power.

 The official Xinhua news agency, in a rare report on a local disturbance, blamed Sundays riot in Chizhou in dirt-poor eastern Anhui province on a few criminals who led the unwitting masses astray. The violence was the latest in a series of protests which the Communist Party fears could spin out of control and become a channel for anger over corruption.

 Poor forced into unsafe buildings

 Paris, Aug. 30 (Reuters): The deaths of nearly 50 people in fires in rundown buildings in Paris in the past few months has highlighted a housing crisis that is forcing poor families and immigrants to live in desolate and unsafe apartments.

 Some 300,000 people, many of them African immigrants, are waiting to be allocated social housing in the greater Paris area, officials say.

 In the meantime, families and children are forced to live in shabby hotels, squats or tiny flats.

 We want decent and definite homes, said Oumar Cisse, who has camped in a gym since the temporary apartment he lived in for years went up in flames on Friday.

 Pope to miss services

 Vatican City, Feb. 5 (Reuters): Pope John Paul is not yet strong enough to read his entire traditional noon message tomorrow and looks set to miss Ash Wednesday services for the first time in his papacy.

 The Vatican said today that the 84-year-old Pope, who has been in hospital since last Tuesday for breathing problems caused by flu, will only make a blessing tomorrow from his hospital suite.

 Deputy secretary of state Archbishop Leonardo Sandri will read the address and recite the so-called ?Angelus? prayer ? both of which the Pope normally does himself in St Peters Square ? before the Pontiff himself delivers a blessing. In a separate statement, the Vatican said the Pope would not preside at Ash Wednesday services marking the start of Lent next week.

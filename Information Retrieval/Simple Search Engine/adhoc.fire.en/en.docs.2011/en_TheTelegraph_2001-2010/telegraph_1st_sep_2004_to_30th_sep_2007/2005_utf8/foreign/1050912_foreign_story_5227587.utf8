 Terror threat

 Washington, Sept. 11 (Reuters): A videotape televised today purportedly from a US-member of al Qaida threatened Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia, on the fourth anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

 ABC News said it had received the video in Pakistan. It reported the masked speaker appears to be Adam Gadahn, from southern California, who threatens attacks on the two cities, Allah willing, and warns that the attackers will show no compassion. Yesterday, London and Madrid. Tomorrow, Los Angeles and Melbourne, he said. We love peace, but peace on our terms.

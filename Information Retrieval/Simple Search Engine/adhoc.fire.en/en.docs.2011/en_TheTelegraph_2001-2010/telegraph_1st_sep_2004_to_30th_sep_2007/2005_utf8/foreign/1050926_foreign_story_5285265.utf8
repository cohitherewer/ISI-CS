 Iraq attacks

 Baghdad, Sept. 25 (Reuters): A suicide bomber on a motorbike killed himself and six other people when his motorbike exploded today in the mainly Shia city of Musayyib, south of Baghdad, police said.

 Earlier today a suicide car bomber attacked an elite Iraqi police unit in Baghdad, killing 13 commandos. Ten were also wounded, police said. That bomb followed clashes overnight between US troops and Shia militiamen loyal to cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in the eastern Baghdad district of Sadr City.

 Vodka cartel

 Moscow, July 2 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin said today he favoured the creation of a monopoly on spirits to cut corruption and the sale of low quality alcohol, local news agencies reported.

 The best way for us to solve this problem is if we got from the government a decision which would practically move to a monopoly on spirits, Putin said in Kaliningrad, Russian news agencies reported. A state monopoly in vodka ? Russians favourite tipple ? was a considerable source of revenue for the treasuries of both Tsarist and Soviet Russia.

 After the fall of the Soviet Union, hundreds of little known brands appeared and the volume of bootleg low quality alcohol soared, often controlled by organised crime groups. Even some politicians, eager for support, created their own vodka brands in the chaotic 1990s. Putin said about 40,000 people died in Russia each year from drinking poor quality alcohol and criticised the current system of production as corrupt.

 About 2.2 billion litres of vodka was sold officially in 2003, equivalent to about 15 litres per person a year. Analysts estimate the market is worth about $9 billion a year, of which about $2 billion is sold unofficially without duty being paid. Putins comments come as ministers have pushed for the sale of RosSpirtProm, the state-owned alcohol producer that accounts for about 60 percent of the countrys spirits production.

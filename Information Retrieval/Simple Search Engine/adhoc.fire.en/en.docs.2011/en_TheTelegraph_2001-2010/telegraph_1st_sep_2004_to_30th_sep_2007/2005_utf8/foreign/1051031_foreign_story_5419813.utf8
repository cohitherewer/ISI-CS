 Paris riots, three nights in a row

 Paris, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Gangs of youths lobbed stones at police and set cars ablaze in a northeastern suburb of Paris in a third night of riots sparked by the deaths of two teenagers electrocuted while fleeing police, officials said today.

 The youths set some 20 cars ablaze and threw bottles and rocks. Nobody was hurt but 15 people were arrested.

 The unrest was less severe than previous nights in Clichy-Sous-Bois, where the riots broke out on Thursday.

 There were some cars ablaze and some arrests, but nothing like what we saw in the two previous nights, a police spokesman said.

 On Friday night, youths set garbage bins and cars ablaze and also fired a shot at police in the suburb, where many of the 28,000 residents are immigrants, mainly from Africa. Sixteen people were lightly injured in Fridays violence.

 Hundreds of residents silently marched through the suburb yesterday in an appeal for calm and to pay their respects to the two dead teenagers, whom media identified as 15-year-old Banou and 17-year-old Ziad, both believed to be of African origin.

 Prosecutor Francois Molins said the two boys, accompanied by a friend who was injured at the substation, had fled from police investigating the scene of a break-in.

 They started to run because the other youths were running, he said yesterday. 

 The three adolescents wereno delinquents, he said, adding: They thought they were being chased although that was not the case.

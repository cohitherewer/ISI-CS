 Toilet trained

 Shanghai, April 13 (Reuters): China is coming clean about its filthy toilets, first hosting a world toilet summit and now about to hold its first ever toilet exhibition which will lift the lid on new technology.

 The World Toilet Expo will run from May 8-10 in Shanghai, with some experts going potty about a dial-a-loo phone line people can call to find the nearest public toilet, the Shanghai Daily said today.

 ?It?s expected to solve the long-lasting problem that tourists, cab drivers and people unfamiliar with the city cannot find a toilet when they need one,? Han Yurong, a Shanghai Public Sanitation Bureau official said.

 Beijing, eager to freshen up its primitive privies before it hosts the 2008 summer Olympics, recently added high-tech, self-cleaning toilets near tourist sites.

 Youth 

 Stockholm (Reuters): The youth wing of Sweden?s ruling Social Democrats, which has acknowledged padding its membership list to get more funding, signed up a 73-year-old former cabinet minister without his knowledge. ?There has been a lot of talk about the youth movement?s dubious methods, but I?d never have believed the SSU (Social Democrat Youth) would use an old lefty like me for such ends,? Kjell-Olof Feldt wrote in Aftonbladet newspaper on Wednesday. Feldt said he had received a letter from the organisation summoning him to its annual meeting, 50 years after his youth party membership expired. 

 The SSU has asked all 29,000 people on its register to confirm if they are genuine members after it discovered district organisations had padded their lists by continuing to pay the membership fees of former members, thereby boosting their state funding.

 SSU chairman Ardalan Shekarabi said this week he would step down later this year, citing the need for a?new start? in the organisation.

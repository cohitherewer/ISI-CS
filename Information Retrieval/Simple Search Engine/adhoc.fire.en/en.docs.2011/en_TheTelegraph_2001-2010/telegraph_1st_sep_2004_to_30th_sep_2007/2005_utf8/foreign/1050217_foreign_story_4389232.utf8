 Baby 81 turns Abilass

 Kalmunai (Sri Lanka), Feb. 16 (Reuters): Sri Lanka?s ?Baby 81? finally recovered his parents and name today, two months after he was found alive in tsunami debris ? and was carried straight to a Hindu temple where the gods were thanked with smashed coconuts.

 Dressed in a girl?s pink smock after outgrowing all his baby boy clothes while in hospital, three-month-old Abilass was handed back to his elated mother in a packed courtroom in this tsunami-ravaged town on Sri Lanka?s east coast.

 But not before he woke up half-way through the judge?s protracted 22-page judgement in a case that sparked a national media circus and was finally settled with DNA tests. 

 He wailed and interrupted proceedings for a quick bottle-feed. ?I am very happy!? his mother Jenita Jeyarajah said in her native Tamil as she was escorted from court by heavily armed police, grinning from ear-to-ear and smothering her baby with kisses.

 Cherubic Abilass, whose plight became a beacon for bereaved parents whose children were swallowed by Sri Lanka?s worst natural disaster, was placed on a mat at a nearby temple. Chanting ?Om? behind him, two dozen relatives broke coconuts in a traditional ritual of thanks ? as police kept back a frantic press pack.

 Abilass was nicknamed ?Baby 81? because he was the 81st person taken to Kalmunai hospital on Sri Lanka?s east coast after December?s tsunami. Grieving families flocked to offer to care for him.

 He was then put under police guard after his father Murugupillai Jeyarajah tried to forcibly take him from nurses and was arrested and briefly detained. The court ordered DNA tests after 31-year-old barber Jeyarajah and his wife argued they could not prove he was theirs because his birth certificate and other documents were washed away by the tsunami along with their house. When the tests were ordered, Jeyarajah nearly fainted and threatened to kill himself.

 Newspaper reports have said nine women claimed the boy as their son in the aftermath of the tsunami, but officials say the Jeyarajahs were the only couple to say the baby as theirs. ?Only one couple claimed the baby throughout and I did not understand media reports that said nine people claimed the child,? additional district Judge M.P. Mohideen told the court hearing.

 The infant?s survival was hailed a miracle in a disaster that killed nearly 40,000 people along the islands southern, eastern and northern shores.

 He has grown considerably in the interim. He weighed 5.5 kg when taken to the hospital and now weighs 6.9 kg.

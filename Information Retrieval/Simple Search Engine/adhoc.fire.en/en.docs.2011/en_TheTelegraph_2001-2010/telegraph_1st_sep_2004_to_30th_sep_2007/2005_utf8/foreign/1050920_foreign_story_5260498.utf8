 Pak row over Israel ties

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 19: Targeting last weeks historic handshake between President Pervez Musharraf and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA) threatened to oppose any resumption of relations with the Jewish state.

 The MMA chief Qazi Hussein Ahmad said establishment of direct contacts between Islamabad and Tel Aviv is an attempt to isolate Pakistan.

 At a gathering of the American Jewish Congress in New York, Musharraf said Pakistan would open a new chapter in friendly ties between Islamic countries and Israel, leaving the hardline MMA worried. 

 We will give stout resistance to any effort that is aimed at recognising the Jewish state, Ahmad said in Peshawar, adding that Musharrafs friendly gestures towards Israel will isolate Pakistan in the Islamic world.

 However, analysts believe the meeting between Musharraf and Sharon is only the tip of an iceberg in promotion of cordial ties between Islamabad and Tel Aviv.

 The handshake has not yet led to a turnaround in Pakistans policies towards Israel. Musharraf and his allies are still on the defensive to prevent any outcry by the Right-wing parties.

 Before the handshake and meeting between the two foreign ministers, the Pakistani government had backed the Palestinians and Israels unconditional pullout from the occupied territories.

 Musharraf and his government still deny any changes in Pakistans principled position on Jerusalem and say that Israels recognition will remain linked to the establishment of a Palestinian state.

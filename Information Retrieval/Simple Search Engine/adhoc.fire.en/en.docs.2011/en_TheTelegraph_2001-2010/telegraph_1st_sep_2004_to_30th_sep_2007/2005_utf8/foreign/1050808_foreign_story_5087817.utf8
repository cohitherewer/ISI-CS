 Taishan, Taiwan, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Barbie is making a comeback in a small town in Taiwan that used to churn out the blonde plastic dolls for US toymaker Mattel nearly 20 years ago.

 But instead of strolling off factory belts, Barbie is showing off her outfits at a museum dedicated to the worlds most famous fashion doll.

 Since it opened last year, the museum in Taishan township on the outskirts of Taipei, which is known more for its manufacturing plants and car repair shops than tourism, has drawn more than 30,000 visitors.

 While larger Barbie museums can be found all over the world, from California to Germany, the exhibits in Taishan are unique because they have been set up by former employees of Mattel, which closed the plant as part of the exodus to cheaper manufacturing centres in China and Southeast Asia.

 We were very proud of ourselves because we made the finest-quality Barbie dolls for Mattel in the world at that time, said Taishan township chief Lee Kuo-shu.

 At its peak, about 8,000 people were on Mattels payroll, including factory workers, raw material suppliers and housewives contracted for work such as fastening buttons and bow-ties.

 Many ex-workers say they still remember how to make a Barbie doll, recalling how they used to curl her hair with chopsticks and steam the strands using rice cookers in the early days.

 Taishan was devastated in 1987 when Mattel closed its factory, which had been the mainstay of the towns economy. But Barbie remained in their collective memories and residents decided to build the Taishan Doll Museum to house an 800-plus collection of dolls.

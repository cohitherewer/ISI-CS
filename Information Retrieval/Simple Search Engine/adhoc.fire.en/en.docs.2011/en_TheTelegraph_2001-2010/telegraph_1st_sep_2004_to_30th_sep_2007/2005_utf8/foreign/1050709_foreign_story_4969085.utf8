 G8 aid for Africa in terror shadow

 Gleneagles (Scotland), July 8 (Reuters): World leaders agreed today to more than double aid for Africa to $50 billion, presenting the deal as a message of hope that countered the hatred behind the London bomb attacks.

 The announcement was the culmination of a Group of Eight summit of rich nations hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who had been determined to focus on African poverty despite yesterdays attacks, which killed more than 50 people.

 We speak today in the shadow of terrorism but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve, Blair declared, flanked by fellow leaders of the G8 and seven of their African counterparts on the steps of the Gleneagles hotel in Scotland.

 It isnt the end of poverty in Africa ? but it is the hope that it can be ended.

 Campaigners described the increase as welcome progress but said it fell far short of the hopes of millions of people who had backed the Make Poverty History campaign and attended the Live 8 rock concerts around the world to put pressure on the G8.

 The G8 leaders also agreed to start talks on global warming with major emerging economies such as India and China. Environmentalists said their declaration was a missed opportunity to take concrete action on climate change.

 On the world economy, they called for more investment in refining as well as greater access for foreign investors to oil-rich states to tackle record high oil prices.

 In foreign policy, the leaders agreed a package of aid worth up to $3 billion to help the Palestinian Authority and foster peace in West Asia.

 The G8 said annual development aid to Africa would increase by $25 billion by 2010, more than doubling the 2004 level. They also said overall annual development aid ? currently around $50 billion ? would increase by $50 billion by 2010.

 The worlds richest nations have delivered welcome progress for the worlds poor people but the outcome here in Gleneagles has fallen short of the hopes of the millions around the world campaigning for a momentous breakthrough, said Jo Leadbeater, head of policy for the aid agency Oxfam.

 Blair defended the deal. Politics is about getting things done step by step, progress by progress, he said.This is big progress, and we should be proud of it.

 Blair has called African poverty a scar on the conscience of the world.

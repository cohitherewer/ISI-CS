 Robot helps in operation

 ROGER HIGHFIELD

 London, May 18: A woman has donated a kidney to her fianc? after undergoing Britains first transplant operation conducted with the help of a robot.

 The ?1 million machine at Guys Hospital in London, bought with charity funding, helped remove the organ from Pauline Paynes body using two mechanical arms and a 3D camera.

 Conventional surgery was then employed to implant the kidney into her seriously-ill partner, Raymond Jackson. It is very, very emotional, she said yesterday. Theres a part of me that is now a part of Ray.

 The da Vinci robot has been used before in Britain to remove diseased organs and carry out advanced reconstructive surgery but the keyhole kidney operation by a team led by Prokar Dasgupta, a consultant urologist at Guys, marks the first time it has been used for an organ transplant in Britain.

 Two pencil-thin robot arms were inserted through 8mm holes in Paynes body. Their delicate hands, wielding surgical tools, snipped and sewed in response to finger and wrist movements made by an operator at a console a few feet away. Although the mechanical movements are slower than those of the surgeons hand, the machine compensates for any tremor.

 A third arm, passed through another hole, carried a miniature camera. Images were viewed in 3D by the operating surgeon peering into a pair of binoculars, who controlled the position of the camera with foot pedals. You feel a lot less tired because youre sitting comfortably and your movements are very controlled, said Dasgupta.

 Israel cabinet nod to pullout

 Jerusalem, July 3 (Reuters): Israels cabinet today rejected a proposal to delay the start of a Gaza pullout for three months, setting the stage for a showdown between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his main political rival Benjamin Netanyahu.

 The attempt to force Sharon to postpone the withdrawal slated to begin in mid-August was a sharp reminder of the opposition he faces in his right-wing Likud party to the plan he has championed and a sign of internal leadership battles ahead.

 Fears that ultranationalist opponents of the move out of Gaza might attack Israeli leaders also surfaced at the Prime Ministers office, where the Shin Bet security service fitted cabinet members for new bulletproof vests before they convened.

 The bulky Sharon, who has quipped that no bulletproof vest fits him, was also issued body armour, an Israeli source said, adding that threats on his life were likely to increase as the pullout grows nearer.

 The Israeli Prime Minister aims to evacuate all 21 Jewish settlements in Gaza, home to 1.3 million Palestinians, and four of 120 in the West Bank. US-led mediators hope the disengagement will foster a road map peace process between Israel and Palestinians seeking statehood in occupied lands. While opinion polls have shown most Israelis favour his plan, Sharon has been confronted with escalating protests by fringe ultranationalists, some of whom have threatened his life.

 Palestinians welcome any Israeli withdrawals from lands occupied in the 1967 war. However, they say they fear Sharon intends to leave Gaza mainly in order to cement Israels hold on much larger settlements in the West Bank.

 At a stormy session, the cabinet voted 18-3 against Likud agriculture minister Yisrael Katzs proposed three-month delay.

 Netanyahu, a former Prime Minister who has long sought a political comeback, supported Katz, who said more time was needed to complete pullout preparations. Opponents of the plan have questioned the readiness of Israeli forces.

 Sharon, with backing from his main coalition partner, Shimon Peress Labour Party, had been widely expected to beat back Katzs proposal before a parliamentary vote on the issue on Wednesday that seems certain to go the Israeli leaders way.

 Any delay is dangerous, a government official quoted Sharon as telling the cabinet against the backdrop of confrontations last week between ultranationalists and soldiers who ejected them from a Gaza stronghold they had seized.

 Ahead of the Knesset vote, a face-off was shaping up between Sharon and Netanyahu, who now holds the finance portfolio and who an aide said intends to show his disapproval of an August pullout by staying away from Wednesdays legislative session.

 Sharon has signalled he could take Netanyahus absence as tantamount to voting in parliament against the government, grounds in Israel for firing a cabinet member. But while flexing his muscles, Sharon would divide the Likud more deeply.

 In 2003, Netanyahu embarked on a series of free-market reforms such as cutting taxes and government spending and privatising state-owned companies. Netanyahu, who reluctantly voted in parliament for the pullout, has come under pressure from Jewish settler leaders to take a strong position against the first evacuation of settlements built on land Palestinians want for a future state.

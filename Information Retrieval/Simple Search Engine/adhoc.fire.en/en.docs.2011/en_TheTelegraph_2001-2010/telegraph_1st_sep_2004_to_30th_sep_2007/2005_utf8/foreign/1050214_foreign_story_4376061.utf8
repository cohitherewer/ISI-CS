 Boating break

 Venice, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Venice?s more than 400 gondoliers, furious over a ban on overnight boating, stopped ferrying tourists around the lagoon city in protest on Saturday and briefly blocked the Grand Canal.

 ?It?s a strike ... But not because we don?t like tourists,? said Roberto Luppi, president of the gondoliers? union. Angered over a city ban on boating in the early hours, the gondoliers walled off traffic by lining their vessels across the Grand Canal in a spectacle that had tourists clutching their cameras.

 Gas attack on mall in Russia

 St Petersburg, Dec. 26 (Reuters): A gas smelling of garlic hurt dozens of Russian shoppers when it was released into a supermarket here today, but police ruled out a terrorist attack.

 Two other shops of the handyman store chain Maksidom were evacuated at the height of the pre-New Year shopping period, after rescue workers found two other suspicious canisters fitted with timing devices. 

 Local media quoted officials as saying the gas was probably released by criminals trying to blackmail the stores managers. 

 They ruled out an attack such as those launched by Chechen rebels against civilians. There were devices made out of ampoules containing a so far unknown substance, which on dispersal gave out a strong pungent smell like garlic, said a spokeswoman for the local Federal Security Service, the successor of the Soviet-era KGB.

 She said the service was struggling to identify the gas released in the shop.

 Local media quoted prosecutors as saying the gas was methyl mercaptan, a compound added to domestic gas to give it its odour which is poisonous in large quantities.

 The likely explanation for what happened is that it was malicious competition. Not long before the incident, the managers of Maksidom appealed to the police because they had begun to get letters with threats to disrupt pre-New Year trade, a local police spokesman told Interfax news agency.

 Now we can definitely say that the possibility of a terrorist act is ruled out. A spokesman for the Emergencies Ministry said 78 people had appealed for help after smelling the gas, and 66 had been hospitalised. No one was seriously hurt.

 Suspicious containers with pipes were found in two other shops, they are being defused, Emergencies Ministry spokesman Andrei Alyabyev said.

 Threats and raids are frequent tactics in commercial disputes between Russian businessmen, although it would be rare for shoppers to be targeted.

 Pitt proud of time spent with Aniston

 Brad Pitt

 New York, May 17 (AP): Brad Pitt says hes still proud of his relationship with Jennifer Aniston, four months after their separation. 

 In an interview in GQ magazine, Pitt expresses nostalgia and happiness for his four-and-a-half years of marriage with Aniston, who filed for divorce in March.

 Theres a beauty in our coming together, theres a beauty in our time together, and theres a beauty in this, for us, Pitt says. Im actually really proud of us... Weve done it our way, and I love her for that. Weve kept the love we have for each other.

 On reports that he wanted children, but Aniston didnt, Pitt says: That was one version, but totally unfounded.

 As to reports of a romance with his Mr and Mrs Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, Pitt didnt explicitly deny them, but said he pays it no mind.

 Jen and I have felt pretty impervious to it all. We have not seen a thing, so that we can carry on this new incarnation with the love we still have for each other. My attitude was, say what you want, were not playing.

 Instead, Pitt describes the reasons for their breakup as complex and multifaceted and not one thing.

 Now, the 41-year-old actor says, he has growing interest in doing things other than movies: Truthfully, Im interested in other things now. Like family.

 Though Pitt says hes not ready to re-marry and start that family yet, he adds: Im not worried that its not gonna happen. Ill make it happen. You go make the thing that you want.

 Liberias Iron Lady takes charge

 Johnson-Sirleaf: New start

 Monrovia (Liberia) , Nov. 23 (Reuters): Liberias former finance minister Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf became the first woman to be elected head of state of an African country today when she was declared the winner of a presidential run-off.

 Liberias electoral commission said official results from the November 8 run-off showed the Harvard-trained World Bank economist beat soccer millionaire George Weah by winning 59.4 per cent of the valid votes, compared to Weahs 40.6 per cent.

 Consequently, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, having received more than 50 per cent of the valid votes cast from November 8, is hereby declared the winner of the presidential election, NEC chairwoman Frances Johnson-Morris announced at an official ceremony in the capital Monrovia.

 I feel very fine. I am happy about my election and I thank the Liberian people for their support, the 67-year-old President-elect, who wore a maroon African robe and headcloth, said as her supporters cheered and sang around her. She is nicknamed the Iron Lady.

 Liberias electoral authorities confirmed Johnson-Sirleafs win even though they were still investigating a formal complaint from Weah that the polls were fraudulent.

 Supporters of the former AC Milan striker, who has a strong following among mostly young Liberians, staged street protests last week, some of which turned into clashes with police.

 International observers had praised the elections, the first since the end of a 14-year civil war in the West African state, as free and fair. Several hundred foreign observers and 15,000 UN troops and police supervised the polls.

 Weahs Congress for Democratic Change party said it would continue to contest the election result.

 Zarqawi war on Iraq polls

 Baghdad, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi declared war on Iraq?s landmark elections today in a warning intended to scare away voters a week before they go to the polls amid a raging insurgency.

 But interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi vowed that his US-backed government would do everything possible to safeguard voting stations against what he called ?evil forces determined to hurt Iraq?.

 Zarqawi, a shadowy Jordanian militant who tops America?s wanted list in Iraq, berated the country?s Shia majority for embracing the election and urged Saddam Hussein?s once-dominant Sunni minority to wage a holy fight against it.

 ?We have declared a bitter war against the principle of democracy and all those who seek to enact it,? a speaker identified as Zarqawi said in an audio tape on the Internet.

 ?Candidates in elections are seeking to become demi-gods while those who vote for them are infidels. And with God as my witness, I have informed them (of our intentions),? he said.

 Zarqawi?s network has targeted politicians and beheaded foreign hostages in the countdown to the election. Despite a $25-million US bounty on his head, he has eluded a US-led manhunt and continues to thumb his nose at American troops.

 His group?s almost daily attacks ? including most of the deadliest suicide bombings of the past year ? have raised fears of a bloodbath during next Sunday?s election, Iraq?s first since the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam.

 Sunni guerrillas have stepped up their campaign of intimidation in the final days before the election, which is expected to cement the new-found power of Iraq?s 60 per cent Shia majority, long oppressed under Saddam.

 ?We are determined to do our best to put an end to the escalation of violence,? Allawi told BBC television.

 Many Sunni leaders have called for an election boycott, saying insurgent attacks in the Sunni heartland will prevent voting and skew the outcome in favour of Shias. A low Sunni turnout could undermine the election?s credibility.

 Officials of Iraq?s US-backed interim government say insurgents are trying to provoke sectarian civil war. The guerrillas have killed hundreds of politicians and security men they brand as collaborators with foreign occupiers.

 A recent recording said to be from al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden backed Zarqawi as the network?s leader in Iraq.

 Zarqawi accused Shias of engaging in a plot with Washington to seize absolute power. ?Oh people of Iraq, where is your honour? Have you accepted oppression of the crusader harlots ... and the rejectionist pigs?? he said. 

 Zarqawi vowed in an earlier audiotape that militants were ready to fight for years to drive out US-led forces.

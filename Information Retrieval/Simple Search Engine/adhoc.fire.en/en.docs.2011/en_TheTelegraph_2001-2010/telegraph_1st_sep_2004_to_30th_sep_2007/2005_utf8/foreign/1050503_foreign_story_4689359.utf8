 US soldier admits Iraq abuse

 Fort Hood (Texas), May 2 (Reuters): US soldier Lynndie England, pictured holding a naked Iraqi on a leash in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, pleaded guilty to seven charges of abuse today but the judge did not immediately accept her plea.

 Lynddie England, who appeared in photographs that touched off an international furore at a time when the US was under pressure over the 2003 Iraq invasion, pleaded guilty to charges that can carry a maximum sentence of 11 years.

 The judge at her military trial, Colonel James Pohl, called a break in the proceedings to consider whether to accept her plea, prompted by remarks in court in which she said she did not believe at the time that her actions were wrong. The plea had been worked out with prosecutors, who had dropped two of the charges as part of a deal. The charges she admitted to could bring her 11 years in prison, but her lawyer hoped for a much shorter punishment.

 Questioned by Pohl about the incident portrayed in the leash picture, England, 22, said she had visited that section of the prison to see Sergeant Charles Graner.

 ?(Graner) handed me the leash and said hold this, I?m going to take a picture,? the diminutive soldier said.

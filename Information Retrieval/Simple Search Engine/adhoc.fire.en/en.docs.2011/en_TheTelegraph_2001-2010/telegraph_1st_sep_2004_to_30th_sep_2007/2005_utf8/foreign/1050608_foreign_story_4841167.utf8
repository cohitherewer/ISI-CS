 Iraq backs away from trial claims

 Baghdad, June 7 (Reuters): Iraqs government backed away today from recent claims that Saddam Hussein could be tried within weeks, saying it was up to the countrys independent Special Tribunal to decide when he goes to court.

 Senior officials, including the president and the prime ministers spokesman, had said in the past week that Saddam could be tried within two months. 

 The announcements appeared designed to show that the government was making progress in bringing the former president to justice more than two years after his overthrow.

 But the Special Tribunal, an independent body set up in late 2003 by US-backed authorities, issued a statement saying no date had been set for any trial. There is no exact scheduled time... to achieve the work according to the independence of the Iraqi Special Tribunal.

 Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafaris spokesman today backed away from his earlier comments on the timing of Saddams trial. A fixed date has not been presented, Laith Kubba said. (The Special Tribunal) assured me that they have a media official and they wish that information is given by them directly.

 Ex-cop reveals al Qaida bid on Blair

 Tony Blair: Terror target

 London, Sept. 11 (Reuters): British police thwarted an al Qaida plot to assassinate Prime Minister Tony Blair during celebrations to mark Queen Elizabeths 50 years on the throne, according to a former London police chief.

 Former Metropolitan police commissioner John Stevens, who was Britains most senior officer, said officials had learned that al Qaida snipers intended to kill Blair and his wife Cherie in front of a major parade through London in June 2002.

 In extracts of his new autobiography serialised in the News of the World newspaper, Stevens, who retired in January, said the plot was foiled after a huge covert operation was carried out to protect the Blairs.

 It was a significant threat, Stevens said. Mr Blair remained very calm and very pragmatic. He knew there was a specific threat against him and his wife yet he remained absolutely unfazed.

 Neither Downing Street nor the police would comment on the claims.

 More than a million people thronged through the streets of London during the queens golden jubilee celebrations, while a parade passed in front of the monarch and other dignitaries, including Blair, near Buckingham Palace.

 Stevens said a large number of secretly armed elite police officers were deployed around the Blairs.

 I felt acutely nervous as the procession approached, Stevens said. I was constantly scanning faces in the crowd looking for signs of trouble.

 Stevens also accused former cabinet minister David Blunkett of being untrustworthy and of trying to destroy him.

 He said the ex-home secretary knew little about policing and had used the September 11 attacks on the US to score political points against officers. 

 Blunkett was forced to resign last year after an inquiry found he intervened in a visa application for his ex-lovers nanny.

 After the Labour Partys election win in May, he returned to government as work and pensions secretary.

 Coincidentally, the Sunday Telegraph, citing unnamed sources, claimed Blair intended to give him his old job back in a cabinet reshuffle.

 Stevens said Blunkett had publicly misrepresented their private discussions. There were only three of us in that office ? myself, the home secretary and his dog. And it didnt come from the dog.

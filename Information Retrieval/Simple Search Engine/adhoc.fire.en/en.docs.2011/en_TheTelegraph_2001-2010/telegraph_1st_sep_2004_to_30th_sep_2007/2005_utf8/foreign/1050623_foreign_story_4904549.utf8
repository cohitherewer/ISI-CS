 Rebel pact angers Nepal

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, June 22: As King Gyanendra today returned to Kathmandu after attending the G-77 summit in Doha, Qatar, the government filed cases against a dozen Maoist leaders including its chairman Prachanda and military chief Ram Bahadur Thapa alias Badal. 

 The cases were filed at the appellate court in Lalitpur after the government spokesman and information minister Tanka Dhakal warned political parties against joining hands with the rebels.

 In his statement, Dhakal warned that political parties would also be treated as terrorists if they teamed up with the Maoists to launch a combined struggle for restoration of democracy in the Himalayan kingdom. It will be unfortunate if the government is compelled to look at the constitutional forces and terrorists in the same light, he said. 

 Dhakals warning came after the Maoists welcomed an offer from the seven-party Opposition alliance to launch a combined struggle against Gyanendra. 

 The cases against the Maoists were filed by the government attorney in connection with an 18-month-old case in which two security personnel were killed in a landmine explosion at Fisling, Chitwan district. The Maoist leaders were made defendants on the basis of the deposition of a rebel activist, Ram Bahadur Kumar, who was allegedly involved in the attack. 

 Kumar was arrested by the security forces recently.

 The government has demanded life sentences for Maoist leaders and seizure of their property in the cases filed under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Act. 

 In a separate development, Prachanda denied that his outfit considers India as its principal enemy. 

 In an interview to the rebel outfits mouthpiece, Janadesh, Prachanda said reports that his partys central committee meeting had identified India as the principal enemy were wrong. 

 Definitely, in the context of the threat of foreign intervention our party had called upon people to prepare for ideological, political and physical resistance, he said.

 US prison to close, but Bush has to decide

 Brussels, June 15 (Reuters): The US will stop holding prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, but the decision to do so rests with the US President, attorney general Alberto Gonzales said today.

 There will of course be an end, Gonzales said when asked if the camp would exist indefinitely. 

 Ultimately that will be... for the commander-in-chief to decide when that will be, he said in Brussels after meetings with EU officials. Gonzales did not indicate any timetable, but added that soldiers captured during World War II had been held for many, many, many, many years.

 Guantanamo Bay was established in January 2002. Gonzales said the camp had been erected to protect the country against its enemies.

 But it was never intended that we would never think about... is this the right approach, he said. 

 Defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and vice-president Dick Cheney both defended the camp after US lawmakers said it had created an image problem for the US.

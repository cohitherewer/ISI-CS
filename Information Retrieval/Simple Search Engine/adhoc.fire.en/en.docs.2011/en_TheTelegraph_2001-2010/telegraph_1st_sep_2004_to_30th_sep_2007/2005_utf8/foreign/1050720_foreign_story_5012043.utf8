 Bhattarai welcomes induction into party

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, July 19: Senior Maoist leader and the rebel outfits ideologue Baburam Bhattarai today welcomed his reinstatement in the central leadership of the party. 

 Bhattarai said that the move to induct him into the party again should not be seen as a victory or defeat for either side. He added that the party had taken action against him and politburo members Dina Nath Sharma alias Ashok and his wife Hisila Yami due to policy disputes. 

 Late last night, Prachanda, in a statement, said that Bhattarai had been reinstated in the standing committee, the apex policy-making body of the party, and the politburo. Sharma and Yami were reinstated only in the politburo. 

 Prachanda, who is also the Maoist military commander, had demoted Bhattarai, Sharma and Yami to ordinary members after they failed to toe the party line. Bhattarai had, in fact, questioned Prachandas actions in January this year.

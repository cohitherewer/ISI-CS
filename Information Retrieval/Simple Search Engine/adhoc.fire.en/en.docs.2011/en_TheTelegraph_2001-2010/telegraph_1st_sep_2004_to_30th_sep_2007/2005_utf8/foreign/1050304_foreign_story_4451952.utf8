 China turns rights tables on America

 Beijing, March 3 (Reuters): China took a tit-for-tat swipe at the US today for abusing Iraqi prisoners of war and other human rights violations in a report released days after Washington criticised China?s rights record.

 The US state department accused China in its annual rights report on Monday of using the global war against terrorism to crack down on peaceful opponents of its rule in the Muslim Xinjiang region and of committing persistent abuses in 2004.

 China?s State Council, or cabinet, issued its own annual report, citing atrocities by US troops against Iraqi prisoners which ?exposed the dark side? of the US rights record.

 ?The scandal shocked... humanity and was condemned by the international community,? the State Council said in its report. 

 Ironically, the US posed as the ?world human rights police? while keeping silent on its own misdeeds, it said. Iraqi prisoners were kept naked, stacked on top of each other, forced to engage in sex acts. The report made no mention of President George W. Bush condemning the abuses.

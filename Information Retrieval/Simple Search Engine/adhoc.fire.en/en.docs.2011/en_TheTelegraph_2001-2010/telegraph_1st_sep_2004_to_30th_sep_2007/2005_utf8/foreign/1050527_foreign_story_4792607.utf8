 US woman in scarf row

 Madison (Wisconsin), May 26 (AP): A Muslim woman who was ordered by male prison guards to take off her headscarf before she could visit her estranged husband filed a lawsuit alleging her constitutional right to practice religion had been violated.

 Cynthia Rhouni, 43, of Madison, says the scarf, or hijab, that always covers her head and shoulders in the presence of men shows the world she is a devout Muslim.

 Rhounis lawsuit filed yesterday claims that male prison guards at the Columbia Correctional Facility north of Madison told her rules prohibited any head covering in the visiting room.

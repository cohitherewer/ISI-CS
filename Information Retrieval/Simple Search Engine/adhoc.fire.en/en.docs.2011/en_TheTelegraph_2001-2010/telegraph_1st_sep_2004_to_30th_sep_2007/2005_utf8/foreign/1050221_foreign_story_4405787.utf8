 Fine Print

 Italian ire

 Rome, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Reports that the European Commission has cut back on its use of the Italian language have caused dismay and fuelled fears that Italy?s international influence is in irreversible decline.

 Italian officials have complained that the Commission in Brussels has removed simultaneous Italian translation from all but one of its weekly news conferences. In a further snub to the melodic language of Dante, not one of the Commission?s myriad spokesmen and women are mother-tongue Italian speakers.

 Italy?s commissioner in Brussels, Franco Frattini, who holds the justice and security brief, also waded into the row, telling Corriere della Sera newspaper that from now on he would only speak in Italian at his own news conferences.

 Wet lands

 Washington (Reuters): Wetlands that 

 once sheltered Marsh Arabs and a host of wildlife in southern 

 Iraq are being partly restored and could offer a haven once 

 again if it is done right, experts said on Saturday. Luckily, 

 water coming into the area from the Tigris and Euphrates 

 rivers is unexpectedly clean, washing away toxic salts that 

 built up when the area was drained under Saddam Hussein?s 

 regime, the experts reported.

 Scent trap

 Washington (Reuters): The sexy scent used by female cockroaches to attract males could be the best tool yet against the creepy pests, US researchers said. 

 Friday. They made an artificial version of the mating pheromone used by the bugs and hope it could be used to lure them into traps.

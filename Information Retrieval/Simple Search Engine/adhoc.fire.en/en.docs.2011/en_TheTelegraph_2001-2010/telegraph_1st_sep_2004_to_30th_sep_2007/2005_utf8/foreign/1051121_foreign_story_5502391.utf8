 America backs plan to avert Iran vote

 Rice: Peace push?

 New York, Nov. 20: President George W. Bush has backed a plan to allow Iran to enrich uranium in Russia, a change in tactics that could avert a showdown in Vienna.

 Bushs shift, which has angered hawks in Washington, holds implications for the Indian government, too, as a compromise in Vienna would help Prime Minister Manmohan Singh defuse a standoff with his Left allies.

 Bush, who met President Vladimir Putin at a Pacific Rim summit on Friday, told him he would support Moscows plan to offer Iran the chance to conduct nuclear enrichment at facilities in Russia. The US was previously against any deal that would allow Iran to enrich its own uranium. 

 The latest proposal would allow Teheran to convert uranium if subsequent enrichment, which could have weapons applications, took place only overseas, under Russian control.

 It is the first compromise offer in which America has shown any interest and is designed to develop a joint front with Russia, a long-term ally of Iran. 

 Washington previously adhered to a strict hands-off approach to any negotiations with the Islamic regime, including the offer that Teheran rejected earlier this year from the so-called EU3 of Britain, France and Germany. 

 The tactic was seen as a key part of the American bad cop diplomatic stance, compared with the more conciliatory good cop European approach.

 The strategy will alarm administration hardliners ? most notably Vice-President, Dick Cheney, and John Bolton, a former number three at the state department and now ambassador to the UN ? who wielded the upper hand on foreign policy during Bushs first term. 

 They maintain that any offer to Teheran is a sign of weakness, effectively rewarding long-standing Iranian deception over its nuclear programme and buying the clerical regime more time to develop clandestine weapons. 

 The significant switch in Americas position comes even though Iran, which western intelligence is convinced is secretly seeking to develop nuclear arms, admitted last week that it had resumed conversion of uranium, the stage before enrichment, in defiance of an international ban. 

 The regime also admitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it had possessed a document containing partial instructions on making a nuclear bomb, believed to have been obtained through the black market weapons network of Pakistani atomic scientist A.Q. Khan. 

 The fresh diplomatic manoeuvring seems certain to mean that America and EU3 will not try to have Iran referred to the UN Security Council over its forbidden nuclear activities at Thursdays meeting in Vienna of the IAEA. Until the middle of last week, America intended to push for referral. 

 European officials, who back the Russian initiative, have been surprised by how openly America has entered the process. 

 The shift in outlook is believed to be largely down to the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who is one of Bushs closest confidantes. She has promoted a less confrontational foreign policy since taking up her position in January. 

 Iran salvo

 In public, Tehran kept up the tempo. Iranian lawmakers voted today to oblige their government to stop allowing snap UN checks of its atomic sites and to resume uranium enrichment if Tehran is referred to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions.

 In the vote, broadcast live on state radio, 183 out of 197 lawmakers present voted for the bill.

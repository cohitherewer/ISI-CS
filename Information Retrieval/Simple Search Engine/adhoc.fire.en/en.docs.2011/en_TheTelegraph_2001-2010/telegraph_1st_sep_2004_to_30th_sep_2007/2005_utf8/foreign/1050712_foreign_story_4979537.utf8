 No-backlash pat for Britain

 London, July 11 (Reuters): Britains leading campaigner for racial equality said today the country has been spared a major backlash against Muslims after 52 people were killed in suspected al Qaida bomb attacks on London.

 What was remarkable about what happened is that there have been so few incidents, that we have not been turning our neighbours into our enemies, Trevor Phillips said after signing a book of condolence for the victims. A decade ago, he said, things might have been very different. 

 The chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) said: The bombers want to divide this city because of its easy-going, multi-cultural mix. The fact that people work together and live together is an affront to them. Muslims say they have been subjected to a higher than usual level of abuse since the attacks, including hate mail and attacks on mosques. But they have also received many messages of support from non-Muslims who realise they have no sympathy for the bombers

 In what he felt was a fitting epitaph to the innocent London commuters caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, Phillips wrote:London. Many races, many faiths, one people undivided and undefeated. Phillips, a black Briton, heads the CRE, a publicly funded non-governmental body which was set up in the late 1970s to tackle racial discrimination. 

 Phillips felt real progress had been made. Five or 10 years ago I think we would have found ourselves in a position of great tension this weekend where people were pointing the finger at one community specifically, he said. This is a real watershed for this country. At the moment of the greatest stress you could imagine, with the utmost provocation, the temptation would have been to divide. That is not happening. 

 Just one day before the bomb blast, London won the right to host the 2012 Olympics with a world in one city slogan that rejoiced in the capitals reputation as one of the worlds most culturally diverse cities. Muslim Londoners were part of the force that won us the Olympics. The unity we showed last Wednesday was what saw us through Thursday, Friday and Saturday. It will be the best answer we can ever give to the bombers, Phillips said.

 Germany jail jolt to US

 Berlin, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Germany has quietly released a Hizbollah member jailed for life for the murder of a US Navy diver, disregarding Washingtons desire that he either be extradited or remain behind bars, officials said today.

 The government said there was no link between Hammadis release and that of a German hostage in Iraq just days later. He served his term, the justice ministry said.

 Sources in Berlin and Beirut said earlier that Mohammad Ali Hammadi, convicted of killing navy diver Robert Dean Stethem in Beirut during the 1985 hijacking of a TWA flight and sentenced to life in prison, was flown back to Lebanon last week.

 German legal sources said he had been released on Thursday and travelled to the Lebanese capital on Friday. Hizbollah sources confirmed that Hammadi had returned.

 German government sources said Washington knew Hammadis release was imminent but had submitted no extradition requests since his 1989 conviction.

 Afghan troops 

 The Pentagon has called for a small cut in the American troop numbers in Afghanistan ? from 19,000 to about 16,000 by next spring.

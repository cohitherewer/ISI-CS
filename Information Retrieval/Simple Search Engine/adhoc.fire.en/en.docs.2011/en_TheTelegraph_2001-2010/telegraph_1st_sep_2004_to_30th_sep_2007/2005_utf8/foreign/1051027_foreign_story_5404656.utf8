 More quake aid pledged

 Muzaffarabad (Pakistan), Oct. 26 (Reuters): Donor governments promised half a billion dollars of new earthquake aid to Pakistan today after UN officials warned that hunger, cold and injuries might kill more people than the quake itself.

 But millions of survivors with little food or shelter were left guessing how much would reach them before winter snow blankets the remote Himalayan valleys of Pakistan Kashmir.

 The UN recorded an initial $525 million in new aid pledges at an emergency conference in Geneva of around 60 nations on the aftermath of the October 8 disaster. The organisation had earlier doubled its appeal target to $550 million. 

 We needed the money yesterday, UN emergency relief chief Jan Egeland said in Geneva.

 Officials warned that only part of the new money was earmarked for emergency relief like food, medicine and tents, with most being set aside for later reconstruction efforts. Relief workers are racing against time to get people under shelter and to stockpile food to last them through the winter.

 Some UN agencies had run out of cash, Egeland said, amid a chorus of complaints that the world was not helping enough. Doctors are having to amputate the limbs of many survivors because they have gone so long without help, he said. Many more lack shelter as night temperatures plunge below freezing, with the full force of winter only a few weeks away.

 This disaster may have the number of people who died after the disaster bigger than those killed by the earthquake, UN chief aid coordinator Rashid Khalikov said at his tent office in the wrecked city of Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan Kashmir.

 With the known quake death toll at more than 54,000, relief workers had until the end of November to provide shelter, treat the countless injured and supply food, Khalikov said.

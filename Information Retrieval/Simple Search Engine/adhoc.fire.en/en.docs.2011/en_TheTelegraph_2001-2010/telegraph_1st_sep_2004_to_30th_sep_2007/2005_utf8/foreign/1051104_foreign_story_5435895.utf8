 Google to put library books on the Web

 San Francisco, Nov. 3 (Reuters): Google Inc. and four US libraries plan to unveil the first collection of thousands of mostly 19th century American literary and historical works as the Web search leader seeks to regain momentum for its project to put library books online.

 Sidestepping lawsuits by the US publishing industry that seek to derail a related effort by Google to scan copyrighted books, the company and its library partners said they will put up their first large collection of public domain works.

 Harvard University, Stanford University, University of Michigan and the New York Public Library have contributed US Civil War history books, government documents, the writings of Henry James and other books to the Google Print programme.

 The books were scanned by the Mountain View, California-based companys book digitisation project and can be read in their entirety at http://print.google.com/. The text is searchable and users can save images of individual pages.

 Today we welcome the world to our library, Mary Sue Coleman, president of the University of Michigan said in a statement.

 As educators we are inspired by the possibility of sharing these important works with people around the globe.

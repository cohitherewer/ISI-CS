 Flus deadly storm theory

 Washington, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Scientists believe they may have worked out why H5N1 bird flu kills so many young adults while Kuwait said today it had found the deadly virus in a flamingo as it spreads around the world.

 It is the first known case of H5N1 in the Gulf Arab region. The highly pathogenic form of the virus has killed more than 60 people in Asia and 150 million birds.

 Scientists in Hong Kong said H5N1 apparently causes a storm of immune system chemicals that overwhelms the patient.

 The H5N1 virus caused proteins known as cytokines to rush to infected lung tissue ? evidence of a so-called cytokine storm, an immune system overreaction that can be fatal.

 The study, published in the online medical journal Respiratory Research, might suggest that if H5N1 does cause a pandemic, it could disproportionately affect the young and healthy as compared with seasonal flu, which kills many elderly people but few young adults.

 It also raises questions about how effective drugs will be in controlling such a pandemic, experts said.

 Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, said the study supports predictions that any possible H5N1 pandemic would be especially severe.

 This is looking more and more like an H1N1 1918, he said in a telephone interview. The worst recorded influenza epidemic was in 1918, when an H1N1 strain swept the globe in a few months, killing anywhere between 20 million and 100 million people.

 Vietnam, where bird flu has killed 42 people, treated two more people today showing symptoms of the virus. Vietnam said the two were in hospital in the northern Bac Giang province.

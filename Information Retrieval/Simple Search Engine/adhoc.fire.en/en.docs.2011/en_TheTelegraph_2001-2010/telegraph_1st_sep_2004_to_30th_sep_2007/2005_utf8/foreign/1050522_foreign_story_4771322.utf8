 Plaza in pieces

 New York, May 21 (Reuters): No one can sleep at the shuttered Plaza hotel these days, but they can take pieces of the famed ornate hotel home instead.

 Crowds of shoppers withstood long lines and checkout mayhem yesterday for a liquidation sale at The Plaza, which is selling off decor as the landmark hotel undergoes a controversial renovation.

 From minibars and martini glasses to king-size mattresses and crystal sconces, the hotels merchandise filled its ballrooms and floors on the opening day of the six-week sale.

 Volume, its all about volume, said Jim DelRio of Atlanta as he dragged plastic garbage bags full of Plaza goods to a cashier. Ive got seven pairs of slippers.

 Jack LaPadula, balancing a stack of towels, leather-bound menus and cream dispensers, said he got married at The Plazas Oak Room and just marked an anniversary there. Its just a little memory, he said.

 Shoppers who like to cook grabbed battered copper pots and banquet-size chafing dishes; decorators snagged draperies and armchairs, and costume-lovers collected maid uniforms and gilt-edged bellhop jackets.

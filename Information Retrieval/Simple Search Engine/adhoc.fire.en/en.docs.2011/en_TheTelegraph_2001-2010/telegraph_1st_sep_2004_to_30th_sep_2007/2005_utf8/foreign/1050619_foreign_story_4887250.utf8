 Princely peck

 MARCO GIANNANGELI

 London, June 18: It may have been a spontaneous act, but to onlookers yesterday the first public kiss between Prince William and his new stepmother was the seal of approval to his fathers marriage.

 The peck on the cheek came after the young prince was forced to concede defeat in a charity polo match with the Highgrove team, which included the Prince of Wales. The event at the Cirencester Polo Club in Gloucestershire was presided over by the Duchess of Cornwall, the president of one of its benefactors, the National Osteoporosis Society.

 Despite a last-minute goal by Prince Charles, however, the team lost 5-4 to the home side. The Duchess of Cornwall, wearing a white dress and pale green jacket, presented the Burberry Cup to the home side. All eyes were on Prince William when he stepped forward to greet her. The duchess smiled as he kissed both of her cheeks. After Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall married in Windsor, both William and Prince Harry kissed her goodbye inside the grounds of the castle.

 But this display of affection was filmed by a camera crew working on a behind the scenes documentary.

 9/11 victims compared to Nazis

 Denver, Feb. 4 (Reuters): The University of Colorado launched an investigation yesterday into a professor who wrote an essay comparing some of the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks with Nazis.

 The decision by the Boulder, Colorado, university is a step toward possibly firing Ward Churchill, whose controversial writings have sparked a debate on the First Amendment free speech rights of tenured professors at state-funded schools.

 Churchill?s post-September 11 essay called some of the victims ?little Eichmanns,? a reference to the German war criminal Adolf Eichmann, saying all of those killed in the hijacked airliner attacks were not blame-free because of the policies of the US government.

 The remarks came to light after Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, scheduled Churchill for a panel discussion. Hamilton cancelled the panel after the professor and college administrators received death threats.

 Colorado Gov. Bill Owens has asked Churchill to resign from the University of Colorado and state lawmakers have passed resolutions denouncing him.

 Churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department on Monday, but has said he will not resign as a professor and will sue the university if he is fired. Some state lawmakers have threatened to pull funding from the ethnic studies department as a way to punish Churchill.

 The Colorado investigation into Churchills writings is expected to take 30 days. It will be conducted by two deans at the school and then reviewed by a committee.

 After a closed-door meeting, the universitys regents announced a resolution that apologized for Churchills remarks and said they dishonored the school.

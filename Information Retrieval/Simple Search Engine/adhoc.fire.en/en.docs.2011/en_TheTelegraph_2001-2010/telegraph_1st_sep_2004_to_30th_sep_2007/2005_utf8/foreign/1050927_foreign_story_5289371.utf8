 Moss support

 London, Sept. 26 (AP): The modelling agency representing Kate Moss said it would support her in the face of allegations that she used cocaine. 

 I feel compelled to speak out in defence of Kate Moss following recent days of speculation and, in many cases, ill-informed and inaccurate stories, Storm Agency director Sarah Doukas said in a statement yesterday. I know Kate, and I have represented her for the last 18 years. Over this time she has consistently demonstrated herself to be a professional and exceptional model and a loyal, special and dear friend to me and countless others, said Doukas, who helped launch the models career after she spotted her in New Yorks John F. Kennedy international airport when Moss was 14. 

 Doukas said Storm would fully support Kate both professionally and personally throughout what she called a difficult time. Moss, 31, has lost three modelling contracts since the Daily Mirror newspaper published photos that showed her snorting cocaine. 

 Naomi backs friend

 Naomi Campbell has expressed support for Kate Moss in the face of cocaine abuse allegations as she joined a UN campaign to prevent girls from being tricked into sex slavery. Kate Moss is my friend ... I think its like everybody is being bad to her, the supermodel said.

 Its not the first time it has happened in the world ... Its really like a vendetta, she said. Campbell, who has confessed to using cocaine in the past, insisted it was wrong to blame the modelling industry for drug abuse and eating disorders among young women, but encouraged aspiring models to complete their education in case their modelling careers fail to take off.

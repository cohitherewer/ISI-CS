 Sonogram in house puts glare on Cruise

 Cruise: Mission impossible

 Los Angeles, Dec. 3 (AFP): Tom Cruise is at the centre of a fresh medical row as experts expressed concern over his purchase of a sonogram machine to perform at-home scans on expectant fiancee Katie Holmes.

 Cruise told US television interviewer Barbara Walters last month that he had bought an ultrasound machine to peek at the foetus of his unborn baby with the Batman Begins actress who he has been dating since April.

 But medical experts were yesterday warning that it is dangerous for untrained Cruise and Holmes to be operating a complex piece of medical equipment such as an ultrasound machine at home.

 Both the the Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (SDMS) and the American College of Radiology are up in arms at the Mission Impossible and Top Gun stars admission that he bought the machine that can cost anywhere between $15,000 and $200,000.

 The society is concerned about the safety of Cruises decision to purchase a medical device and perform a medical diagnostic procedure without appropriate training, the SDMS said in a statement.

 Diagnostic medical sonographers complete educational programmes and take national certification examinations to ensure they can perform sonograms safely and in a manner that obtains accurate results, it added.

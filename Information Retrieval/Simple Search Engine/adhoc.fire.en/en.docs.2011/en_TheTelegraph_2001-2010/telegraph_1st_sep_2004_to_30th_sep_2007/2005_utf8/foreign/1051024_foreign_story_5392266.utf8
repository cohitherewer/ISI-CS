 Tiniest car

 New Delhi, Oct. 23 (PTI): American scientists at Rice University in Houston have constructed the worlds smallest car ? a single molecule nanocar which has a chassis, axles and four buckyball wheels.

 Researchers say they would eventually like to use the nano cars for moving objects and doing work in a controlled fashion on the molecular scale.

 Dead dash

 Miami (Reuters): A 93-year-old Florida 

 motorist hit a pedestrian, killing him and severing his 

 leg, and then kept driving 5 km to a toll bridge with the 

 bloody corpse stuck in his windshield. The driver, who 

 is possibly suffering from dementia, did not realise he 

 had been involved in a crash, police said. 

 Jail BPO 

 Amsterdam (Reuters): The Dutch justice ministry is planning to set up call centres in prisons. In the Dutch prison system it is normal for prisoners to work part of the day, it said. The WGCC Dutch call centre association has reacted angrily, saying it insults the professionalism of call centre agents.

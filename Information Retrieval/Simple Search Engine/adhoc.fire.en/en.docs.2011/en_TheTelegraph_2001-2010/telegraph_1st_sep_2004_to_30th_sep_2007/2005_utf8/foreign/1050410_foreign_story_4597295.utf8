 Khatami denies gesture

 Tehran, April 9 (Reuters): Iran?s President Mohammad Khatami strongly denied that he shook hands with his Israeli counterpart Moshe Katsav at Pope John Paul?s funeral, the official Irna news agency said today.

 Katsav said he shook hands with both Khatami and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the funeral yesterday, when hundreds of international dignitaries gathered in the Vatican to pay homage to the late Pope.

 Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom said the handshakes did not have political significance but nevertheless gave Israel a ?glimmer of hope that something can change in West Asia?. It was believed to be the first time an Israeli President had shaken hands with Syrian and Iranian leaders. But Khatami told Irna after his return from Italy: ?I strongly deny shaking hands, meeting and talking to the Israeli President.?

 ?This claim is like other baseless claims made by the Zionist media in the past,? he said. Syria?s official news agency yesterday confirmed Assad shook hands with Katsav but said it was just a formality, adding that the two leaders did not exchange any words. Syria is formally at war with Israel.

 The Pope has been praised by many as a force for peace and the church invites people at its masses to offer each other a sign of peace such as a handshake. Catholics also often exchange the words: ?Peace be with you? while shaking hands.

?I told him ?Good morning? and he shook my hand,? 

Katsav, whose post is largely ceremonial, told Israels Channel 2 television.

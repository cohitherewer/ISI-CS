 Alanis plans another sweet Pill

 Morissette: Isn?t it ironic?

 Los Angeles, March 5 (Reuters): As she neared the 10th anniversary of her landmark album Jagged Little Pill, Alanis Morissette began pondering how to commemorate the occasion.

 She ultimately decided to do it all again. Together with the albums producer/co-writer, Glen Ballard, she is in the middle of recording an acoustic version of the career-defining set.

 ?It just sounded much more appealing than creating my own awards show,? Morissette, 30, said with a laugh. ?Theres no better way to honour things than through music.?

 The as-yet-untitled album will come out on June 13 ? exactly 10 years to the day after the original release. It will initially be sold only at Starbucks? 4,500 North American outlets for a six-week exclusive period, after which it will hit traditional retail outlets on July 26. The collection, which will feature the songs in their original order, will include previously unreleased video footage from that era plus different artwork.

 In the decade since its release, Jagged Little Pill has sold 30 million copies across the globe, according to her label, Warner Music Groups Maverick Records. In the US, it has sold 14.4 million units.

 The album featured a number of hits, many of which are still in recurrent rotation on adult top 40 stations, including You Oughta Know, Hand in My Pocket, You Learn, Head Over Feet and Ironic. But perhaps the biggest ?irony? is that Morissette barely remembers the 18 months surrounding the projects peak period.

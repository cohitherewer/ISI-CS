 Annan cleared in scandal probe

 United Nations, March 29 (Reuters): A key inquiry into the UN oil-for-food programme concluded today that secretary-general Kofi Annan had not interfered in the awarding of a contract in Iraq to a firm that employed his son.

 But the report, prepared by a committee headed by Paul Volcker, the former US federal reserve chairman, faulted Annan for an ?inadequate? inquiry into his son?s employment with the Swiss-based Cotecna firm, hired by the UN to verify goods coming into Iraq.

 Annan?s son Kojo, now 31, was a trainee with Cotecna about the time the contract was awarded and then continued to receive a retainer.

 ?There is no evidence that the selection of Cotecna in 1998 was subject to any affirmative or improper influence of the secretary-general in the bidding or selection process,? said the report. 

 As for the younger Annan, the report said he ?intentionally deceived the secretary-general about the continuing financial relationship? with Cotecna.

 Pak minister dressing down

 ISAMBARD WILKINSON 

 Mushtaq Cheema

 Islamabad, Dec. 10: A Pakistani minister has been criticised after claiming that he could not attend a parliamentary committee meeting because he had no clothes to wear.

 Mushtaq Cheema was due to be questioned this week by the Senate over the distribution of sub-standard tents to survivors of the Kashmir earthquake that killed 73,000 people and left 3,300,000 homeless.

 Cheema, dubbed minister without porte-manteaux by one columnist, is minister for textiles, one of Pakistans main sources of foreign revenue through the export of cloth.

 He apologised for his absence at the meeting in Islamabad by explaining he was unable to attend because all his clothes had been burnt.

 A ministry spokesman told the committee that Cheemas lodgings in the Pakistani capital had caught fire and all his garments had been lost in the flames.

 He has asked for his clothes from Faisalabad [his hometown] and has assured me that he will attend the committee meetings as soon as he gets his clothes, the official told The Daily Times.

 But Waqar Ahmed, the committee chairman, was not amused and berated the minister for his absence. 

 This is something like the emperor without his clothes, he said. 

 Except that we have evidence of neither the emperor nor his clothes.

 Quake rape protest

 Political groups in Pakistan Kashmir held a demonstration in the quake-ravaged capital of Muzaffarbad to protest against the alleged rape of a quake victim in a Lahore hospital. 

 The groups took out a procession yesterday to protest the alleged rape of a 20 year-old girl from Muzaffarabad by a doctor of the Mayo Hospital in Lahore on December 4. The demonstrators, who demanded that earthquake victims be shifted from Pakistani cities to the Pakistan Kashmir area, were stopped by police from entering the main market.

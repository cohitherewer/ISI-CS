 Castro on Maradona guest list

 Havana, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Argentine soccer hero Diego Armando Maradona appears to have landed a big interview in his new career as TV showman: Cuban President Fidel Castro.

 An employee at a Havana health retreat where Maradona (in picture) lived for four years fighting cocaine addiction said he was back in town with a team of producers to interview the Cuban leader.

 Maradona arrived yesterday and looks like a young boy. He is so thin, said the source at La Pradera health spa.

 The man once hailed as the greatest player of his generation looks upon 79-year-old Castro a friend and a father figure who helped him kick drugs.

 A slimmer Maradona appeared on Argentine television on August 15 for the debut of his weekly show La Noche del 10 (The Night of the Number 10) in reference to his shirt number on Argentinas national team. His first guest was Pele.

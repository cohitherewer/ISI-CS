 Tortoise reaches 175

 Canberra, Nov. 15 (Reuters): One of the worlds oldest living animals, Harriet the tortoise, celebrated her 175th birthday today ? with a pink hibiscus flower cake at her retirement home in northern Australia.

 Australia Zoo, where Harriet has spent the past 17 years, says the Giant Galapagos Land Tortoise was collected by British scientist Charles Darwin in 1835, although some historians have disputed this.

 There is no doubt however over the age of Harriet ? who for more than a century was thought to be a male and named Harry ? and she is recognised by Guinness World Records as the worlds oldest living chelonian, or reptile with a shell of bony plates.

 She would definitely be the oldest living animal on Earth, Australian conservationist and television celebrity Steve Irwin said.

 Unborn, yet a wannabe brand 

 Sydney/ Washington, Feb. 9 (Agencies): An unborn baby girl and a new monkey species can be named on the Net.

 An Australian couple has been attempting to sell the ?naming, advertising and promotional? rights to their unborn child for $750,000 via an Internet auction site.

 In an advertisement on ?ebay Australia? under the item title ?Truman baby?, the unnamed couple from the Western Australian capital of Perth invites bids on the right to name their baby girl, due on March 1. ?Offers are invited for your opportunity to be part of history in the making,? states the ad, which features a picture of a pregnant woman?s stomach with the words ?Reality bites! Your brand here? written across it.

 ?We are taking bids on the naming, advertising and promotional rights to my unborn baby girl!? the ad states.

 ?For a period of five years from the date of birth, we are offering the exclusive naming rights (first name only) to my unborn baby due March 1, 2005. Your company can have the exclusive rights to name my baby and use for all appearances, advertising, promotion and marketing (for) a period of five years.

 ?This is a unique and historical opportunity to promote your business, company or brand for a period of 5 years,? it says. The child?s 38-year-old mother, described as having ?blue eyes, blond hair?, said she would accompany her daughter ?on all performances? as a condition of the deal.

 The advertisement was listed on ebay on February 2 and the auction, which had attracted no bids as of this morning, was due to end later in the day.

 Another naming rights auction will take off on the Net later this month, for a monkey species. 

 Britain?s Queen Victoria had a pigeon named after her and US President Theodore Roosevelt?s dedication to conservation earned him an elk bearing his name. Now ordinary people can bid online to officially name an orange and brown monkey documented last year in Bolivia?s Madidi National Park, seen by scientists as one of the most biologically diverse places on earth.

 Conservationist Robert Wallace of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, who discovered the new monkey species, came up with the idea of a naming auction to raise money for the management of Madidi park.

 ?To discover a new species of mammal is just incredibly exciting and we decided to use this opportunity to raise the profile of Madidi by doing this,? Wallace said in La Paz, Bolivia. The auction runs from February 24 to March 3 on www.charityfolks.com, which recently sold a guitar autographed by Paul McCartney.

 Tehran, Oct. 28 (Reuters): President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, cheered by thousands of supporters, signalled today he stood by his call for Israel to be wiped off the map, while Irans foreign ministry sought to defuse a diplomatic storm.

 Israel said it would request an emergency session of the UN Security Council over the comments, which have drawn the condemnation of the West and Tehrans ally Russia.

 Iranians chanting Death to Israel and Death to America, converged from nine points in the Iranian capital for a rally attended by most of Irans top officials. Some protesters set fire to Israeli and US flags.

 Ahmadinejad took a short walk in the crowd, rallying in support of his comments that the Islamic world could not tolerate the Jewish state in its heartland. He said western criticism carried no weight.

 My words are the Iranian nations words, he told the official IRNA news agency, when asked if he had a message for the world. Westerners are free to comment, but their reactions are invalid. The Islamic Republic has never acknowledged Israels right to exist.

 The Iranian embassy in Moscow, however, sought to soften the effect of the comments by Ahmadinejad.

 Mr Ahmadinejad did not have any intention to speak up in such sharp terms and enter into a conflict, the embassy said in a statement, a first official reaction to the Wests outrage.

 Its absolutely clear that, in his remarks, Mr Ahmadinejad underlined the key position of Iran, based on the necessity to hold free elections on the occupied territories.

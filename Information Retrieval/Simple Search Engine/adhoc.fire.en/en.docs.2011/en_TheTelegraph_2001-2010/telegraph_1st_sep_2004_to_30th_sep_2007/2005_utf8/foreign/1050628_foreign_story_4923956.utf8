 Deuba cleared of graft slur

 Kathmandu, June 27 (Reuters): A powerful anti-graft body today cleared former Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of corruption charges, officials said.

 The Royal Commission for Corruption Control (RCCC) said Deubas decision to distribute $54,000 in state money to his supporters during the Hindu festival of Dasain last October was against standard procedure but did not amount to corruption.

 RCCC spokesman Prem Raj Karki said six other former ministers facing similar charges and those who received the money had also been cleared.

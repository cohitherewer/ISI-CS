 Blunkett on baby trail

 PATRICK HENNESSY

 David Blunkett

 London, Feb. 13: David Blunkett, the former British home secretary, has launched a legal challenge to try to prove that he is the father of the newborn son of his ex-lover, Kimberly Quinn.

 Lawyers for Quinn, who gave birth to her second son on February 2, have received ?six or seven? letters from Blunkett?s solicitors, Bindman and Partners, dated from around the time of the baby?s birth.

 The letters demand a DNA test to determine whether Blunkett is, as he believes, the father of the boy. A similar test has already established that the MP is the father of Quinn?s other son, two-year-old William. Court proceedings in which Blunkett is demanding access to William are already under way.

 Blunkett?s solicitors are also understood to have warned lawyers for Quinn and her husband, Stephen, that they should not have registered Quinn as the father of the newborn baby on his birth certificate while his paternity is in dispute.

 The letters have also told the Quinns? legal team at Mishcon de Reya that the couple should not have named the child, whom they have called Lorcan Patrick, while legal proceedings are going on, The Daily Telegraph has learnt.

 Blunkett?s spokesman said last night: ?David Blunkett has never discussed or revealed details of the legal proceedings taking place behind closed doors and has no intention of starting now.?

 The revelation that Blunkett is pursuing his paternity claim over Quinn?s latest child with the same zeal with which he has pressed his claim over William is certain to cast questions over plans by Tony Blair to recall him to the Cabinet after the general election, which is expected in May.

 Blunkett, the MP for Sheffield Brightside, resigned as home secretary after he learnt that an inquiry had found that he had ?fast-tracked? a visa application submitted by Leoncia Casalme, the nanny who was looking after William Quinn.

 The former minister had denied the original allegations that he had misused his position to speed up the application, which were made in the paper.

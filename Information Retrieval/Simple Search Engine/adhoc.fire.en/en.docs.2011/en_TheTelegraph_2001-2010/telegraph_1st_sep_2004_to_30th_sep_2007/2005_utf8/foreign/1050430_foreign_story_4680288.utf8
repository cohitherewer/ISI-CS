 ?No peace of mind for Bush?

 Dubai, April 29 (Reuters): Al Qaida?s leader in Iraq has called for more suicide attacks on US forces and vowed that President George W. Bush will enjoy no ?peace of mind?, according to an Internet audio tape attributed to him today.

 The speaker, who made a reference that suggested the tape was recorded in late March, identified himself as Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He said that the holy war, or jihad, was still being waged vigorously two years after the US invasion.

 He also warned fellow insurgents, however, against entering any negotiations with the Americans or their Iraqi allies. ?We promise God that the dog ... Bush will not enjoy peace of mind and that his army will not have a good life as long as our hearts are beating,? the speaker said. 

 Washington?s top general acknowledged this week that the insurgency appeared as strong as it was a year ago, despite US efforts to train Iraqi forces.

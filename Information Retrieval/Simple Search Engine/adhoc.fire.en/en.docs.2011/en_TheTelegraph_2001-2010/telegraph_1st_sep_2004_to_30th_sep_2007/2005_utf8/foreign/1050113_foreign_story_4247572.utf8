 Fashion?s top 10, from the bottom

 Paris Hilton: Wanted, renovation

 Los Angeles, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Desperate Housewives star Nicollette Sheridan, known for short skirts, tight pants and a famously dropped towel in a television ad, was named the worst-dressed woman of 2004 yesterday by fashion designer Blackwell.

 In his 45th annual no-puns-barred list of what he calls ?The Bad, The Sad and The Downright Ugly,? Blackwell said the 41-year-old actor, who a plays a suburban vamp in the hit ABC series, is ?a taste-free pain?. 

 ?Let?s crown her the Tacky Temptress of Wisteria Lane!? he added as he placed her at the top of his list, which has become a Hollywood tradition.

 Also on this year?s list were teen actor Lindsay Lohan, sisters Jessica and Ashlee Simpson and a potpourri of other celebrities: Courtney Love, Paris Hilton, Serena Williams, Britney Spears, Paula Abdul, Meryl Streep and Anna Nicole Smith. 

 Blackwell said the biggest fashion faux pas of 2004 was Janet Jackson?s famed ?wardrobe malfunction? which involved her briefly baring a breast during the Super Bowl?s half-time show. But he added that her ?peekaboo flash was a total tempest in a teapot as far as I?m concerned. If you really want a stylistic scandal, look no further than the Ten Terrors gracing this year?s List.?

 Sheridan caused her own controversy last year, provoking some 50,000 complaints when, during a promotional spot for Desperate Housewives preceding an American football game, she dropped a towel and jumped, apparently naked, into the arms of receiver Terrell Owens. Blackwell had no comment on that, possibly because he found the towel tasteful.

 He gave second spot on his list to teen star Lohan, calling her, ?Over-hyped and under-dressed. What?s happened to Lindsay? When it comes to fashion she?s in a schizophrenic frenzy!? The singing Simpson sisters tied for third.

 He called singer Courtney Love ?a Medusa stuck in a meltdown mode? and named her fourth. Socialite Paris Hilton was fifth: ?This is one Hilton that should be closed for renovation.?

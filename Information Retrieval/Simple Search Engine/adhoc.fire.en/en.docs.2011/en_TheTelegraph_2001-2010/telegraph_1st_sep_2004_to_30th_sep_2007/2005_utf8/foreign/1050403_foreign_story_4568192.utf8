 China and Cuba in rare gestures

 Beijing, April 2 (Reuters): China, whose communist rulers do not allow its Catholics to recognise the Vatican?s authority, expressed concern today about Pope John Paul as he slipped towards death after a 26-year reign.

 In Cuba, the state-run television gave the country?s top Roman Catholic prelate rare air time yesterday to inform Cubans that the Pope was on his deathbed.

 ?A great man is dying,? Cardinal Jaime Ortega, Archbishop of Havana, said in a six-minute statement on the nightly television newscast. It was only the second time the cardinal had addressed Cubans on television. The first was on the eve of the pontiff?s historic visit to Cuba in January 1998.

 China broke ties with the Vatican in the 1950s after expelling foreign clergy. 

 ?We have noticed reports on the health of the Pope,? a foreign ministry spokesman said by telephone. 

 ?China expresses its concern and hopes the Pope can get meticulous medical treatment, recover and restore his health.?

 Amid statements about the Pope?s health, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls issued a written declaration that reported the recent arrests Catholic clergymen in China without comment.

 It said that police had arrested Bishop Filippo Pietro Zhao Zhendong, 85, of Xuanhua diocese in Hebei province on January 3 and Bishop Giacomo Lin Xili, 86, of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province on March 20.

 A priest in Xuanhua province, Tomasso Zho Kexiun, was also arrested on March 30 while returning home from a funeral and was being held in an undisclosed location.

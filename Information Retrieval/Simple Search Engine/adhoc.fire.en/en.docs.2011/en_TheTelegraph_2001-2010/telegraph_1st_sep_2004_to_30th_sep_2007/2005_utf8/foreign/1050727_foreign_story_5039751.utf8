 Fine Print

 Number cruncher

 Tokyo, July 26 (Reuters): A group of professors, irked at an attack on the French language by Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, gave the outspoken politician a set of French textbooks today and urged him to study during his holidays.

 Ishihara said last October that French was disqualified as an international language because French is a language which cannot count numbers, prompting 21 French teachers and researchers to file a suit against him this month.

 We would like you to study this summer the fact that one can count in French, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper quoted 13 Meiji University professors as saying in a letter, which they presented along with the textbooks and a dictionary.

 Milk mishap

 Zagreb (Reuters): A Croatian farmer 

 was killed when a cow he was about to milk fell and crushed 

 him, local media reported on Tuesday. The 61-year-old farmer, 

 from the village of Cadjavacki Lug in central Croatia, went 

 into the stable where his family keeps nine cows, the Vecernji 

 List newspaper reported. I think he slipped, grabbed 

 the milking machine and knocked it over. That must have 

 frightened the cow, which slipped and fell on top of him, 

 his daughter-in-law, who was in the stable with him, said. 

 She said the cow had been very meek and even children could 

 milk her. 

 Bust up

 San Antonio (Texas), (Reuters): A Texas man was arrested after calling police to complain about the theft of his marijuana. Stephen Knight, 17, said three men had broken into his apartment, hogtied him with Christmas lights and stole some marijuana, along with a plasma screen television. Police are looking for the suspects but arrested Knight after finding marijuana plants growing under heat lamps in the apartment, four grams of harvested marijuana and a tablet of ecstasy.

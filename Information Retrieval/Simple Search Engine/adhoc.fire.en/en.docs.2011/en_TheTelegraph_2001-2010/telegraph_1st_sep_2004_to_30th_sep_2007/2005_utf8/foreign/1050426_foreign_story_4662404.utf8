 Hidden luxury turns to scrap

 Dhaka, April 25 (Reuters): Bangladeshi customs officials found luxury cars, large-screen television sets and refrigerators in a container declared to be carrying metal scrap ? so they made it just that at a public ceremony today.

 Hundreds of people watched as officials from the National Board of Revenue (NBR) used bulldozers to crush a Mercedes Benz and a Toyota car and other luxury goods at a railway container terminal in Dhaka.

 NBR chairman Khairuzzaman Chowdhury said a trading firm had sought to evade customs duties by falsely declaring that the container carried iron scrap. ?They wanted to befool us by saying they brought in scrapped metals... so we are giving them the same. They, or anyone like them, will not forget this,? he said at the site.

 Cash-strapped Bangladesh is trying hard to increase domestic revenue ahead of announcing the budget for the 2005-06 fiscal year, beginning next July.

 Officials say tax revenues were 9 per cent short of target in the first nine month of the current 2004-05 fiscal year, partly owing to lower-than-expected import taxes.

 Embassy in Kuwait ransacked

 Hundreds of Bangladeshi workers ransacked their embassy in Kuwait yesterday to protest against not being paid by their Kuwaiti employer, police and embassy officials said.

 The workers broke windows of the building and of embassy cars and damaged furniture and office equipment before police arrested up to 150 to restore order while other Bangladeshis fled, police said. Ambassador Nazrul Islam Khan said none of the embassy staff had been hurt but two Bangladeshi civilians were injured. ?They came to the embassy, walked in and started breaking the glass and damaging furniture and office computers,? he added.

 Bush aide testifies in spy leak case

 Washington, Oct. 14 (Reuters): President George W. Bushs top political adviser, Karl Rove, went before a federal grand jury for a fourth time today as prosecutors neared a decision on whether to bring charges over leaking a covert CIA operatives name.

 Rove, the most powerful and controversial political strategist in Washington, made no comment as he entered the federal courthouse to begin his testimony, hoping to convince grand jurors that he did nothing illegal.

 Prosecutors have told Rove that they cannot guarantee that he will not be indicted over the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plames identity.

 Plames diplomat husband, Joseph Wilson, asserts administration officials outed his wife, damaging her ability to work undercover, to discredit him for criticising Bushs Iraq policy in a New York Times opinion piece on July 6, 2003.

 While special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald could bring charges against officials for the crime of knowingly revealing the identity of an undercover CIA operative, several lawyers in the case said he was more likely to bring a broad conspiracy charge or easier-to-prove crimes such as making false statements and perjury.

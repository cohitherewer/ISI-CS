 Partial Iran recount

 Tehran, June 20 (Reuters): Electoral authorities today ordered a limited recount of Irans inconclusive presidential election after reformists accused military organisations of rigging the vote in favour of a hardline candidate.

 The recount comes four days before an unpredictable second round run-off between the top two candidates in Fridays poll ? pragmatic former President, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the hardline mayor of Tehran.

 Fridays run-off, forced after none of the original seven candidates won an absolute majority, is likely to have a major impact on Irans relations with the world and the future of fragile reforms in the Islamic republic.

 Rafsanjani, 70, bidding to regain the post he held from 1989 to 1997, rebranded himself as a liberal for the campaign, saying the time was right to open a new chapter in Iran-US ties and indicating he would increase social and political freedoms.

 His surprise rival Ahmadinejad, 49, criticised the current governments approach to talks with the West.

 Those who are in negotiations are frightened and dont know the people, the ISNA students news agency quoted him as saying. A popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change the countrys stance in favour of the nation.

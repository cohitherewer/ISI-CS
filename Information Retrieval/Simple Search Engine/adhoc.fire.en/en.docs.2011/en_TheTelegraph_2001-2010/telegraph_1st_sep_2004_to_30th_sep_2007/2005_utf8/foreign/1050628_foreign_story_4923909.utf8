 Fine Print

 Super sauna sizzle

 Berlin, June 27 (Reuters): A German man endured scorching temperatures of 110 degrees Celsius for almost five minutes to win the nations first sauna endurance competition.

 Andreas Kramp, from Lemgo in western Germany, edged out competitors with his 4 minutes 52 seconds inside the blistering sauna in the eastern village of Dolle on Saturday, the Magdeburger Volksstimme newspaper reported today. Kramps time falls short of the almost 12 minutes set by Finn Leo Pusa to win last years international championship in Heinola, Finland.

 The German sauna competition uses the same rules: participants sit in 110-degree heat, with water poured on the stove every 30 seconds to create more steam.

 Rapper rocks to top

 London (Reuters): American rapper 2Pac topped the British music charts on Sunday with Ghetto Gospel almost nine years after he died, the Official UK Charts Company said. The single, which also features Elton John, was reworked and entered in first place, finally displacing the Crazy Frog mobile phone ring tone which held the top spot for four weeks.

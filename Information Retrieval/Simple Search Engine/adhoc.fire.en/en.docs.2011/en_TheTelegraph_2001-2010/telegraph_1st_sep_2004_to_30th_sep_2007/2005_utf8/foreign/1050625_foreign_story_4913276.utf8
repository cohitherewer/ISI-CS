 Nelson watch on the block

 London, June 24 (Reuters): The gold watch British naval hero Horatio Nelson had in his pocket when he was shot dead by a French sniper at the height of the Battle of Trafalgar goes on sale in October for the first time in over 200 years.

 The Josiah Emery watch is one of only 22 examples of the master watchmakers timepieces still in existence, and its rarity and history have prompted auction house Sothebys to give it a price tag of ?350,000. 

 It is the last and the greatest thing left that he owned. It would have been his prize possession, Nelson expert Martyn Downer said today.

 Accurate timekeeping was vital for navigation, and watches from Emerys shop in London were the envy of the day. Nelsons watch would have cost around ?100 when it was made in 1787 ? equivalent to some ?10,000 in todays money.

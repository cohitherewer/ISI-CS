 Mobile phone virus in the US

 San Francisco, Feb. 19 (Reuters): The world?s first mobile phone virus ?in the wild? has spread to the US from its birthplace in the Philippines eight months ago, a security research firm said yesterday.

 The virus, called Cabir, has spread slowly into 12 countries and marks the beginning of the mobile phone virus era, which could one day disrupt the lives of many of the world?s 1.5 billion mobile phone users.

 The biggest impact of the relatively innocuous virus, found in about 15 variations so far, is draining mobile phone batteries, said Mikko Hypponen, director of Finnish anti-virus research company F-Secure. Hypponen said Cabir was found on Monday in a technology gadgets store in Santa Monica, California, when a passing techie spotted a tell-tale sign on the screen of a phone in the store.

 ?It?s interesting (the Cabir variant) has now been found in the US, but it?s not the end of the world,? said Hypponen.

 The mobile-virus threat will grow in the future as virus-writers become more sophisticated and phones standardise on technologies that make it easier for viruses to spread across not the whole industry.

 Skin bank for burn victims

 Rome, May 30 (Reuters): Italian researchers are creating what they say is the worlds first skin bank for fire-fighters, steelworkers and others at high risk of being burned in accidents.

 The bank will store sheets of skin cultivated from the hair follicles of high-risk workers so they can be produced at short notice in the case of an emergency. 

 It will really make a difference for people who are more vulnerable to burn incidents, said Edoardo Raposio, one of the researchers at the plastic surgery unit of the University of Genoa in northern Italy.

 Burn victims currently have to wait about 20 days while skin grafts are developed from healthy tissue. 

 While they wait, they use ointments or temporary sheets of skin created using tissue from cadavers or animals and kept in more general tissue banks. But they must use skin created from their own cells for the final graft.

 Those 20 days are the most critical for many patients, Raposio said today. With the bank, the skin will be waiting for them. We can store it for up to 20 years.

 The sheets of skin will be kept at minus 180 degrees Celsius in liquid nitrogen.

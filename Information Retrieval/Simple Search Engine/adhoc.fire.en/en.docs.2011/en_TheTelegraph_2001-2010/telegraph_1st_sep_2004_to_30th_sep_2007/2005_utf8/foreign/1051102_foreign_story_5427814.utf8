 Buenos Aires, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Soccer great Diego Maradona has had some impressive guests on his new TV show, from former rival Pele to British pop star Robbie Williams. But hes never interviewed anyone quite as weighty as Fidel Castro.

 Despite Maradonas efforts to lighten the mood, Cubas President stuck mainly to serious musings about his old comrade Che Guevara and hemispheric politics.

 Castro warned US President George W. Bush to stay away from this weeks summit of leaders of the Americas, to which Cuba was the only nation not invited. It would be better for him to find a pretext and not go. This is seriously an error, the FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) is already dead and buried, Castro said in the five-hour interview, which was aired in part on Monday night.

 The stalled US proposal to create an FTAA has been slammed by Left-leaning Latin American leaders as potentially harmful to local economies.

 Maradona urged his compatriots to join him at an anti-Bush march in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where the US President will attend the November 4-5 summit.

 Castro joked that Maradona could become the target of assassination attempts, like those against him, if the soccer legend gets labelled a subversive.

 He said Bush should not underestimate Argentines strong opposition to the US administration.

 100% hangover-proof

 London, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Forget aspirins, hairs of dogs and hot baths, the only sure way of avoiding a hangover is not to drink in the first place, according to a new study.

 A group of researchers from the Peninsular Medical School at Exeter University, surfed the Internet and combed medical databases to study a range of hangover cures from the traditional to the novel.

 They roamed from the humble aspirin to fructose, artichokes and even prickly pears but found no silver bullet. However, they did hold out some hope for the potential of borage, a bright blue herb with star-shaped flowers used traditionally to decorate gin-based summer cocktails.

 But their conclusions were sobering. 

 No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any complementary or conventional intervention is effective for treating or preventing alcohol hangover, they wrote in the British Medical Journal. The most effective way to avoid alcohol-induced hangover is thus to practise abstinence or moderation.

 EU high on vodka

 Vodka made from an array of produce such as grapes and sugar cane could get the EU stamp of approval under proposed rules to open up the spirits market from traditional potatoes and grain.

 A draft law has been prepared on how vodka should be distilled. It will now be discussed by EU ministers.

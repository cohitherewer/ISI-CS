 Muslims issue fatwa on Osama in Spain

 Madrid, March 11: Muslims in Spain issued a fatwa against Osama bin Laden yesterday.

 The ruling by the Islamic Commission of Spain, the main body representing the nation?s one million Muslims, came on the eve of the first anniversary of the Madrid train bombings, which were linked to the al Qaida network.

 The commission?s leader, Mansur Escudero, said the group had consulted Muslim leaders in other countries, such as Libya and Morocco ? home to most of the suspects in the March 11 bombings.

 The fatwa said that, in accordance with the Quran, ?the terrorist acts of Osama bin Laden and his organisation al Qaida... are totally banned and must be roundly condemned as part of Islam?. The fatwa is believed to represent the first major condemnation of bin Laden by a mainstream Muslim organisation.

 The statement was intended as a move to rehabilitate the reputation of the Spanish Muslim community after the attacks, when Islamist terrorists exploded 10 bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 and injuring 1,500.

 Silent tributes

 Today, Spain commemorated the first anniversary of the bombings with tears, church bells and silent tributes to the 191 people who died in al Qaida?s worst attack in Europe.

 Trains and buses came to a halt as Spaniards observed five minutes of silence, flags flew at half-mast and mourners left candles and flowers outside Madrid?s Atocha station ? scene of two of the blasts. One of many notes left with the flowers said: ?Today, after a year, we haven?t forgotten you.?

 Relatives of some victims stayed home or left the country to avoid reliving raw memories of the attacks. ?The world mourns with you,? UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said in Madrid.

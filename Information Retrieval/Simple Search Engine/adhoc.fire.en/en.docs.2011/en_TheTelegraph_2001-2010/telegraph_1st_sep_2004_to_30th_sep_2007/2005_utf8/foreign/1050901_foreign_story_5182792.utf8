 Divorce decree

 Vancouver, Aug. 31 (Reuters): A Canadian woman won a divorce yesterday after a Vancouver court conceded that her husbands affair with another man did in fact amount to adultery.

 In the first case of its kind 

 in the country, the British Columbia Supreme Court granted 

 a woman it named only as Ms P. an immediate divorce from 

 her husband of 17 years after he admitted to having an affair 

 with a younger man. 

 We argued that the historic definition of adultery, which is limited to sex between a spouse and someone of the opposite gender, was anachronistic, said Ms P.s lawyer, Barbara Findlay.

 Modern man

 London (Reuters): A group of scientists 

 claim to have proof ? based on radiocarbon dating of artefact 

 finds in France ? that Neanderthals and the first ancestors 

 of modern man shared the same space at the same time some 

 38,000 years ago. These data strongly support the 

 chronological coexistence ? and therefore potential demographic 

 and cultural interactions ? between the last Neanderthal 

 and the earliest anatomically and behaviourally modern human 

 populations in western Europe, they wrote in Nature.

 Walk way

 London (Reuters): The first four-limbed 

 animals on land may not have hopped or waddled but rather 

 shuffled like modern-day caterpillars, scientists from Uppsala 

 University in Sweden and McGill University in Canada said.

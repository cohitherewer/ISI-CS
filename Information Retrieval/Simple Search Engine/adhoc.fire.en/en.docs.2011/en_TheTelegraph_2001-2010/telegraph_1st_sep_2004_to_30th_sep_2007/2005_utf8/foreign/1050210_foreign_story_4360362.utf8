 Pak arms plea

 Karachi, Feb. 9 (Reuters): Pakistan has asked the Us to help stop the smuggling of weapons and drugs from Afghanistan into its troubled southwestern region, shaken in recent weeks by a spate of attacks by tribal militants.

 Baluchistan provincial governor Owais Ahmed Ghani said the militants, involved in what he called the ?recent sabotage and terrorist activities?, were getting weapons from across the border in Afghanistan. ?Afghanistan still remains an unsettled place and its government does not have full control over the country,? Ghani sais in Karachi today.

 Soviet-era weapons, including multi-barrel rocket launchers, and narcotics worth millions of dollars were being smuggled in from Afghanistan, he said. ?We have raised the issue with American officials, asking for their help to fight weapons and narcotics smuggling.? Tribal militants, demanding greater political and economic rights, have intensified attacks on government installations and infrastructure in recent weeks.

 The worst attack came last month, when tribesmen attacked Pakistan?s largest gas field, forcing its closure for more than a week. Since then, militants have carried out almost daily attacks targeting railway tracks and telecommunications lines.

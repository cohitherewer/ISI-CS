 Turner tirade against Fox

 Las Vegas, Jan. 27 (AP): CNN founder Ted Turner has called the Fox television network a ?propaganda voice? of the Bush administration and compared Fox news channel?s popularity to Adolf Hitler?s rise in Germany before World War II.

 Fox News issued a statement in New York saying: ?Ted is understandably bitter having lost his ratings, his network and now his mind ? we wish him well.?

 During a question-and-answer session moderated by former CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw, Turner called it ?not necessarily a bad thing? that Fox?s ratings top those for CNN. ?Adolf Hitler was more popular in Germany in the early ?30s than... People that were running against him,? Turner said. ?So just because you?re bigger doesn?t mean youre right.?

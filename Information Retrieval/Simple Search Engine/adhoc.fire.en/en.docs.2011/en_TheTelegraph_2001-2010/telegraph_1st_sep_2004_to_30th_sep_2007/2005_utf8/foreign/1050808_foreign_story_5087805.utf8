 Discovery enters butterflies phase

 Houston, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Discovery astronauts enjoyed their final scheduled day in space today and prepared for the shuttles fiery return to the Earths atmosphere, the anxious phase that doomed space shuttle Columbia in 2003.

 The weather forecast for the scheduled predawn Monday arrival at Kennedy Space Center in Florida called for light winds and a small chance of showers, entry flight director LeRoy Cain said.

 I see a pretty straightforward (weather) situation lining up on Monday, Cain said, cautioning that forecasts can be wrong and that the shuttle will not land in rain.

 After 13 days in orbit, Discovery was set to begin its descent at 0740 GMT (1.10 pm IST) and land at 0847 GMT (2.17 pm IST) on Monday. A second landing time after two hours is available if the first attempt is waved off.

 The first re-entry path would take Discovery over Central America and Cuba, where its brilliant trail of superheated plasma would be visible in the darkness. The later time slot would put it over southern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula.

 Alternate runways in California and New Mexico will be considered if landing is pushed to Tuesday or Wednesday.

 The astronauts inspected Discovery on Sunday and made pre-landing preparations before their sleep shift. Commander Eileen Collins and pilot Jim Vegas Kelly checked flight control systems and practised landings on a laptop computer.

 Discovery is in absolutely great shape, Collins said in a media interview from space on Sunday, which was a partial day off for the seven-person crew. Im pretty confident about the entry and Im thinking about the landing.

 The space agency has pronounced the shuttle fit to withstand the burning descent into the Earths atmosphere that shattered Columbia on February 1, 2003.

 Cain admitted the first return home since that tragedy, which killed seven astronauts, will bring butterflies to his stomach until the spacecraft safely rolls to a stop.

 But he said Nasa cant dwell on Columbias failure. Were looking forward, were not looking back. 

 Columbia was a few minutes from landing in Florida when it broke apart over Texas as superheated gases generated by re-entry penetrated its structure through a hole in the wing heat shield.

 The wing had been struck by a briefcase-size piece of insulating foam that broke loose from its external fuel tank.

 Nasa spent 2-1/2 years and $1 billion making safety upgrades, so the stakes are high for Mondays landing to prove it can still conduct safe space flights.

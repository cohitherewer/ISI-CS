 Fine Print

 Bacall bashing

 New York, Aug. 2: Lauren Bacall has a few unkind words to say about Tom Cruise. 

 In an interview in the August 

 8 issue of Time magazine, now on newsstands, the 

 80 year old actor says: When you talk about a great 

 actor, youre not talking about Tom Cruise. 

 His whole behaviour is so shocking, she says. Its inappropriate and vulgar and absolutely unacceptable to use your private life to sell anything commercially, but I think its kind of a sickness.

 Bacall was alluding to Cruises displays of emotion and public courting of Katie Holmes in the weeks leading up to the release of his new film, War of the Worlds. Cruise and Holmes became engaged in June after he proposed at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. 

 Male pride

 Tel Aviv (Reuters): Challenged by female 

 pride after the success of the Hebrew-language version of 

 The Vagina Monologues, an Israeli playwright has 

 put the penis centre-stage. Rafael Milo-Amar said on Tuesday 

 that his one-man show, The Holy Phallus, was inspired 

 by a disparaging remark one of the Israeli actors in the 

 local production of Eve Enslers celebrated play had 

 made about the male member. She said there was nothing 

 to say about the penis. I told myself: I have something 

 to tell her about the penis, Milo-Amar told 

 the Jerusalem Post. 

 Kim digits

 Seoul (Reuters): North Koreas Dear Leader Kim Jong-il never forgets a phone number, a cadres career or a line of computer code. According to an article posted on Tuesday on a website run by North Korea, Kim wakes up early every day for intensive memory training where he sits down and commits to his keen mind items such as the phone numbers of workers in his Stalinist state. I remember all computer codes and telephones that workers are using now, Kim was quoted as saying on the website Uri-Min-jok-kiri (www.uriminzokkiri.dprkorea.com), or Among our People. 

 Red call

 Sydney (Reuters): An Australian bus 

 driver who called police after he found a package on his 

 bus which emitted a strange sound when touched was left 

 red-faced when it turned out to be a novelty store cushion. 

 The driver found the package on the rear seat of his bus 

 after completing his route around the Sydney beachside of 

 Coogee on Sunday. Fearing it could be an explosive device 

 of some kind, he called the police. It was an unattended 

 item, emitting a popping sound, the police said.

 Stun gun row worsens 

 London, July 29: The row between two police forces over the use of Taser guns when arresting suspect bombers intensified today.

 West Midlands police officers used a stun gun during the arrest of Yasin Hassan Omar, a July 21 London bomb suspect, in Birmingham this week. 

 But the move was criticised by Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, who told a television programme last night that it was an incredible risk because the Taser could set off an explosive device.

 Undercover police officers fired seven shots to the head in a case of mistaken identity at Stockwell Tube station in London, which sparked a controversy over the so-called shoot to kill policy. West Midlands defended its decision in a statement.

 Every situation in which firearms are deployed is unique, it said.

 The shooting of Mr de Menezes in London and the arrest of Yasin Hassan Omar in Birmingham may appear similar but they were separate incidents. 

 The information and intelligence would have been different, the threat level to officers and the public was different.

 Sir Ian had told last nights BBC News special programme Questions Of Security: I cant imagine how that was used. We use Tasers in London regularly but a Taser sends electric currents into the body of somebody. If there is a bomb on that body then the bomb can go off. I cant imagine... it may be that it was clear there wasnt a bomb, I dont know what the situation was. 

 Sir Ian said it was his belief that the only way to stop a suicide bomber was by shooting them dead.

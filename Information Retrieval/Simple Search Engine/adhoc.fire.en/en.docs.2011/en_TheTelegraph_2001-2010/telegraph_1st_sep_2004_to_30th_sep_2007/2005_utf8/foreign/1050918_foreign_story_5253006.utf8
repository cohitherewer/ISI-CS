 Afghans excited and fearful

 Kandahar, Sept. 17 (Reuters): On the eve of Afghanistans first parliamentary election in living memory, excitement and optimism mix with anxiety and fear, ignorance and scepticism.

 Most Afghans are determined to vote for the new Wolesi Jirga, or House of the People tomorrow, despite the risk of violence from Taliban holdouts, believing the new parliament is an important step on the path to a better future.

 But they harbour few illusions. They know its a small step and that the road ahead is long and uncertain. I am excited, said 19-year-old high school student Roya Khushal, who will work as an election official helping women in their segregated polling booths, in the southern city of Kandahar, the Taliban heartland.

 We get to choose. I hope they will work for us, work for our society, she said of the the new parliament.

 Under the Taliban, ousted by US-led forces in 2001, women like Khushal were not allowed outside without a male relative as an escort. Their schools were closed. Now, hundreds are standing for parliament and the 34 provincial assemblies despite death threats and attacks, and they are playing critical roles in running the polling.

 There are complaints too many of the almost 6,000 candidates have tainted pasts. Like scissors, says Kabul student Abullah Jaghuri, 28. If warlords and Taliban find their way into parliament theyll be like scissors working in opposite directions and theyll tear us apart like ... a piece of cloth.

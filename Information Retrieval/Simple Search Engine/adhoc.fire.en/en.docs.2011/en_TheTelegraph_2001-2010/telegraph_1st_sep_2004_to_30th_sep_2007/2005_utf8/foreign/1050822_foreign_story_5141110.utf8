 Fine food 

 Cologne, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Part of the joy of coming home is eating favourite foods, and it is no different for German-born Pope Benedict despite living 24 years in Rome amid some of the best Italian cuisine in the world.

 We must have half of all the different types of German liverwurst and sausage in the refrigerator, his host, Cologne Cardinal Joachim Meisner, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper during the World Youth Day festival the Pope is attending.

 The Pope is very happy in Cologne, thats obvious, Vatican spokesperson Joaquin Navarro-Valls added. There hasnt been a single meal with pasta.

 Rule book

 London: Dont drink the wine and 

 whatever you do, dont mention the war. These are among 

 the helpful hints in an army booklet that advised British 

 troops how to behave in Nazi-occupied France, The Sunday 

 Telegraph reported. Instructions for British Servicemen 

 in France 1944, issued to soldiers involved in the liberation 

 of Europe, gives advice on everything from the sexual habits 

 of French women to the potency of local wine. One section 

 warns: If you should happen to imagine that the first 

 pretty French girl who smiles at you intends to dance the 

 cancan or take you to bed, you will risk stirring up a lot 

 of trouble for yourself ? and for our relations with the 

 French. On the equally sensitive subject of drink, 

 it says: If you get a chance to drink wine, learn 

 to take it.

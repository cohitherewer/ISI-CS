 Jail for suicide consultant

 Amsterdam, Dec. 7 (Reuters): A Dutch court sentenced a man calling himself a suicide consultant to a year in jail today for helping a mentally ill woman end her life.

 Jan Hilarius, the 73-year-old founder of Dutch suicide consultancy De Einder, was found guilty of helping a 25-year-old woman acquire medicines to kill herself in 2003.

 A court said in a statement that Hilarius had corresponded with the woman and given her information about the deadly doses available online.

 The court said the fact that Hilarius was not present when the woman killed herself was not the decisive factor. On the basis of his experience as a social worker, J.H. should have known that he could not diagnose whether the woman was suffering unbearably, it said.

 Castle auction

 Denver, March 20 (AP): 

 A historic castle where John D. Rockefeller and Theodore 

 Roosevelt were guests and where a coal barons 

 ghost is said to haunt the halls was auctioned for 

 $4 million, two years after the IRS seized the century-old 

 mansion in a fraud investigation.

 A Pasadena, California, man made the winning bid, said John Harrison, an IRS special agent. The unidentified buyer declined to talk with reporters.

 ?I had a brief moment to meet him, and I think he?s going to be a real asset to the redstone community,? said Walter Stanaszek, a university of Oklahoma professor who had the winning bid for a nearby Victorian home. ?I?m just excited to say I have a neighbour that owns a castle.?

 IRS agents seized the 42-room redstone castle in the mountains near Aspen in March 2003 while investigating an international investment scheme. 

 Rich on run

 Berlin (Reuters): Germany?s biggest 

 individual lottery winner had no time to celebrate after 

 becoming 20.4 million euros ($27 million) richer, because 

 he was too worried about being late for work. When the salesman, 

 who was not identified by WestLotto, arrived Thursday to 

 buy his weekly lottery ticket at a shop in the industrial 

 Ruhr area he was told last week?s 12-euro ticket that he 

 hadn?t bothered to check had won the jackpot. The man?s 

 reaction left the lottery operator dumbfounded. ?After he 

 was told he had won the jackpot, he said he didn?t have 

 time to chat because he would get into trouble with his 

 boss,? a lottery spokesperson in the western city of Muenster 

 said. Instead, he rushed off to catch a bus to work.

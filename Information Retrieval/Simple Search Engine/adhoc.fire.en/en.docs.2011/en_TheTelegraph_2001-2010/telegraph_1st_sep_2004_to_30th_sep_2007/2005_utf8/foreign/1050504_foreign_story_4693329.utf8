 Women miss Kuwait vote

 Kuwait, May 3 (Reuters): Kuwaiti women will not be able to take part in local elections this year after a suffrage bill was delayed in parliament, but similar polls in 2009 could yet be opened to them, parliament?s speaker said today.

 ?Women will not participate in this (year?s elections) but if the law is approved, women would take part in the coming polls,? Jassem al-Kharafi said. A bill to grant women the right to vote or run in municipal polls for the first time failed to pass in parliament yesterday, but was not defeated, after many Islamist and conservative MPs abstained. 

 Kharafi said parliament had decided today to delay a further vote on the bill for two weeks, meaning that even if it is approved, it is unlikely to be soon enough to allow women to participate in the 2005 polls.

 Among the 60 deputies and ministers present at yesterday?s session, 29 voted in support, two against and 29 abstained. The abstentions mean the required quorum of 33 MPs was not achieved because an abstaining MP is counted as absent.

 Some MPs privately said the abstention was a delaying tactic by the bill?s opponents. Others may have abstained because a vote against the bill would upset the pro-western government, while a ?yes? vote risks angering Islamist or conservative tribal supporters who are against giving women more rights.

 Parliament approved the legislation in a first vote two weeks ago, but many Islamists, tribal and other MPs opposed to female suffrage were then absent. Kuwaiti women are traditionally more liberal and educated than their Gulf Arab counterparts but lag behind some of them in political rights.

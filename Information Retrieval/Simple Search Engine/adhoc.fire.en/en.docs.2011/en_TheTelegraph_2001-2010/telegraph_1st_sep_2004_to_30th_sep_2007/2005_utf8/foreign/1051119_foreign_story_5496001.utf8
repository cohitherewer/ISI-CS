 UN: Iran has cookbook to make nukes

 Vienna, Nov. 18 (Reuters): The UN nuclear watchdog said in a confidential report today it had found an Iranian document which one European diplomat described as a cookbook for a nuclear weapon.

 Also among the documents was one ... on the casting and machining of enriched, natural and depleted uranium into hemispherical forms, said the report by International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei to the IAEA board of governors, which was seen by Reuters.

 A diplomat described it to Reuters as a cookbook for making the enriched uranium metal core of an atomic weapon.

 The US and EU suspect Iran is developing nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian atomic energy programme. Tehran denies wanting nuclear weapons. The Iranians told the IAEA they had received the document from individuals linked to the nuclear black market set up by disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan.

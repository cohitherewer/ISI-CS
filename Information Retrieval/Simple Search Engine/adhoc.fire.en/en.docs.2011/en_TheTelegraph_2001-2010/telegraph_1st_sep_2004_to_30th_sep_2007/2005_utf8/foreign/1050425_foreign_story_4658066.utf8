 Tories take on Tony over Iraq

 London, April 24 (Reuters): Tony Blair?s main rivals urged British voters today to turn a May 5 election into a referendum on his honesty over the Iraq war, targeting what they see as a chink in the Prime Minister?s armour.

 In his most vicious attack yet, Conservative leader Michael Howard called Blair a liar over Iraq while the anti-war Liberal Democrats, placed third, vowed to put the conflict at the centre of their campaign over the remaining 10 days of the race. 

 Polls put Blair?s Centre-Left Labour party on course for an unprecedented third term but point to the first real electoral contest since 1992. The impact of Iraq is a big unknown. 

 ?He has told lies to win elections. On the one thing on which he has taken a stand in the eight years he has been Prime Minister, which is taking us to war, he didn?t even tell the truth on that,? Howard told BBC Television. 

 Asked if he was calling Blair a liar, he said: ?Yes.?

 The attack overshadowed a speech by Blair to mark World Poverty Day, despite a solid endorsement for Labour from former President Bill Clinton via video link to a party rally.

 Iraq has barely featured in the poll race so far with the Conservatives hamstrung by their support for the conflict.

 But with polls showing they have failed to make inroads on key issues like health and education, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats appeared determined to change that dynamic. Howard said the poll was the public?s last chance to ?make a judgment on Mr Blair?s character?.

 The call came as a newspaper report kicked up a fresh row over the legal advice Blair was given before the Iraq war.

 Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy stopped short of calling Blair a liar but urged him to publish the legal advice given by the country?s top lawyer Lord Goldsmith: ?The longer he remains unwilling to publish in full the attorney general?s advice, the more people are going to view this election as an issue of trust and as a referendum on the trust which they felt was so badly lacking over the decision to go to war,? Kennedy told BBC Radio.

 Pubs ban Happy Hour

 London, May 23 (Reuters): British pubs are to ban Happy Hour drinking promotions which allow people to consume large amounts of alcohol cheaply and quickly, in an attempt to tackle alcohol-fuelled violence.

 The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said that its 32,000 members would adhere to the ban on Happy Hours and drink-all-you-can schemes with immediate effect.

 Binge drinking has become a major problem in Britain over the last few years and has turned many town centres into virtual no-go areas on Friday and Saturday nights. Offers like pay ?10 on the door and all drinks are free; drinking games and schemes that encourage people to drink too much too quickly have no place in our sector and we are determined to stamp them out, said Mark Hastings of the BBPA. With the backing of the government, the police and licensing authorities across the UK, we aim to ensure that all pubs operate to these standards of corporate and community social responsibility.

 The BBPA owns nearly two thirds of Britains 59,000 pubs. 

 The All Bar One, Slug amp; Lettuce and Pitcher amp; Piano pub groups are all taking part in the ban. The move to curb Happy Hour schemes comes ahead of a change in the licensing laws across England and Wales and a plan to allow some bars to stay open 24 hours a day. Scotland already has extended drinking hours. The government has said the old system, under which drinkers all spilled out onto the street at the same time as the pubs closed, fuelled drunken fights and vandalism in public.

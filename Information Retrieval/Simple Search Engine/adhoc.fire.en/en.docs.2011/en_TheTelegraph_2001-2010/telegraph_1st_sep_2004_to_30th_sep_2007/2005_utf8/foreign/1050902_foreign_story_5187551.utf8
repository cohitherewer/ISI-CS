 Beslan grieves in anger

 Beslan (Russia), Sept. 1 (Reuters): Grief mingled with anger in the ruins of Beslans School No. 1 today as the Russian town marked the first anniversary of a hostage siege that ended in the deaths of 331 people.

 Weeping mothers who lost their children appealed for asylum abroad, saying they did not want to live in a country where officials ? who some say made the death toll worse by botching the rescue operation ? value human life so little.

 In a provincial town 500 km away, President Vladimir Putin, in a sombre black tie, led a minutes silence for the Beslan victims but he faces tough questioning on Friday when he is to meet a group of the mothers in the Kremlin.

 Half of Beslans dead were children. 

 They had, exactly a year ago, arrived in their smartest clothes for the start of the academic year, only to be met by heavily-armed hostage-takers.

 In the schools wrecked sports hall, where many of the victims perished two days later in an explosion and fire, women pressed their foreheads against photographs of their dead children that hung in rows on the walls.

 In some places, several photographs carrying the same surname hung next to each other ? a sign that a whole family had been wiped out in the bloodshed.

 Klara Gasinova had brought her granddaughter, 18-month-old Alyona, to the sports hall to show the child a photo of her mother, Fatima, and sister, Kristina. Both had died and Alyona was rescued from the school in the arms of a soldier.

 We went and laid flowers and lit candles and we showed Alyona the picture. She said: Fatima, Fatima, because thats what she calls her, Gasinova said.

 Visitors had to pass through metal detectors, mirroring the tight security at schools across Russia as children arrived for the first day of the new term amid fears militants could mark the anniversary with new attacks.

 Putin was visiting a university in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar where students, as throughout Russia, were taking part in traditional celebrations to mark the first day of term.

 Today, a year on from the terrible tragedy in Beslan, millions of people in our country and abroad, all those who know about this terrible catastrophe, anyone who has a heart, are of course remembering that nightmare, he said.

 Let us fall quiet for a few seconds and remember those children, all those who died, who suffered at the hands of terrorists, Putin said in televised remarks.

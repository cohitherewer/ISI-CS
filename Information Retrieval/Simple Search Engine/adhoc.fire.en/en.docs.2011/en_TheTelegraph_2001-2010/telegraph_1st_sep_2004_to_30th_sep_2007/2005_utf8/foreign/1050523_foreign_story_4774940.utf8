 Dark side of Bush lines 

 Darth Vader (top) and Bush

 Los Angeles, May 22 (AFP): A powerful leader moves to suspend civil liberties to defend the republic during a time of war. The subject of political debate in Washington? No, its the new Star Wars movie.

 Star Wars: Episode III ? Revenge of the Sith has barely hit screens, but political activists are already drawing heated comparisons between Darth Vaders battle in a galaxy far, far away and President George W. Bushs war on terror.

 George Lucass sixth and final offering in the classic film series is stirring up a hornets nest of controversy in the US, whether or not the director intended to bring modern politics into his sci-fi allegory.

 If youre not with me, youre my enemy, Anakin Skywalker, who goes to the dark side as the evil lord Darth Vader, tells his one-time mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi in one scene in the film that raked in a record $50 million on its opening day in North America on Thursday.

 The phrase eerily echoes Bushs warning to the world following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on US targets: Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

 In another scene that has annoyed conservative groups and delighted liberals, chancellor Palpatine exploits war fears to consolidate his power and turn the republic into an empire ruled by him alone.

 Senator Padme Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, watches the scene, played out during a legislative session, and says with disdain: This is how liberty dies: with thundering applause. 

 Some liberals are comparing Palpatines actions to those of Bush in persuading US legislators to adopt the Patriot Act that critics say imposed limits on civil liberties in name of the war on terror after September 11.

 But Lucas insists that the films dialogue was written long before the war on terror or conflict in Iraq took centre stage in US politics. When I wrote it (Sith), Iraq didnt exist.

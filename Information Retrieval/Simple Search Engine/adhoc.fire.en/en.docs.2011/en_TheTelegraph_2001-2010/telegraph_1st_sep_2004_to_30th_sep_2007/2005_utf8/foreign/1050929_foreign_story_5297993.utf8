 Jury indicts top US Congressman

 Tom DeLay: Conspiracy

 Houston, Sept 28 (Reuters): The second-ranking Republican in the US House of Representatives, Tom DeLay, said today he would step aside temporarily from his leadership post following an indictment on a campaign-finance charge.

 A grand jury in Travis county, Texas, indicted DeLay on a single felony conspiracy charge related to fund-raising activities by a political action committee he created, CNN and the Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported.

 I have notified the speaker that I will temporarily step aside from my position as majority leader pursuant to rules of the House Republican Conference and the actions of the Travis county district attorney today, DeLay said.

 Republican Party rules require DeLay to step aside in response to an indictment, although he can remain in Congress. DeLay dismissed the charges as having no basis in the facts or the law.

 This indictment is nothing more than prosecutorial retribution by a partisan Democrat, he said.

 DeLay represents a Houston-area district. He has been under investigation by Travis county district attorney Ronnie Earle for possible illegal fund-raising and use of corporate funds by his Texans for a Republican Majority committee.

 DeLays lawyer, Bill White, said in a quote reported by CNN: Its a skunky indictment if they have one. Like a dead skunk in the middle of the road, it stinks to high heaven. 

 DeLays lawyers will hold an afternoon news conference in the Texas capital Austin, where the grand jury met. 

 On September 8, the committee and lobby group Texas Association of Business were indicted on charges of illegally funnelling corporate donations into the 2002 elections for Texas Legislature.

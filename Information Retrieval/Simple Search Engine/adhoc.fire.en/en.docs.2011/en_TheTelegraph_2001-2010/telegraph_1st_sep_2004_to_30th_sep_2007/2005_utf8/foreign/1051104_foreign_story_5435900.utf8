 Undercover obese Tyra shocked

 Banks: Discrimination

 Los Angeles, Nov. 3 (AP): Tyra Banks has gone undercover as a 350-pound woman. Banks wore the fat suit to experience what its like to be obese.

 It seemed like the last form of open discrimination thats OK, and I decided to put on a 350-pound suit myself and live that life for a day and see what happens, the 31-year-old former supermodel said in a recent interview. And it was one of the most heartbreaking days of my life.

 Banks said she was shocked at the reaction. I started walking down the street and within 10 seconds, a trio of people looked at me, snickered, looked me right in my eye and started pointing and laughing in my face, the talk-show host said. 

 Banks is also planning a November 18 segment on pursuing a beautiful booty. She will reveal her own dimpled butt and receive endermologie treatment on the set.

 Uzbek troops charge rebels

 Islam Karimov: Under threat

 Andizhan (Uzbekistan), May 13 (Reuters): Uzbek troops today stormed a state building held by rebels who had broken their comrades out of prison and led anti-government protests that left at least 10 dead.

 Rebels led thousands in protests against what they said was the authoritarian rule of President Islam Karimov after seizing the building in Andizhan, a town in Uzbekistans Ferghana Valley that the government says is home to Muslim extremists.

 Troops then opened fire on a square in Andizhan where protesters had massed and stormed the building. By evening, a government source said the building had been taken back but declined to comment on the number of casualties.

 Some of the rebels said they wanted Karimov to stand down. 

 This is the limit. Our relatives started to disappear, one rebel leader, who declined to give his name, said inside the administration building. He said he had been freed from jail. We suffered too much, people have been driven to despair, it has to be stopped.

 Uzbekistan, a Central Asian country bordering Afghanistan, was quick to offer the US an airbase after the September 11, 2001 attacks on US cities and has become a key ally in Washingtons war on terrorism.

 But Karimov, in power since the country won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, has been widely criticised by the West for human rights abuses. Rights groups say there are at least 6,000 religious and political prisoners in Uzbekistan, where only state-sponsored Islam is allowed.

 Peaceful protests broke out in Andizhan earlier this week to demand the release of 23 Muslim businessmen, who one rights group said were facing trumped-up charges of religious extremism.

 In Washington, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan urged the Uzbek government and demonstrators to show restraint. The European Union blamed Karimovs government for the violent protests.

 A government source said troops had taken back the building, but there was no independent confirmation of the report.

 The square has been cleared. Protesters have left. The building has been freed from those who seized it. The search for weapons is under way, the government source said from the capital Tashkent.

 A police officer, reached by telephone by the Russian news agency Interfax, also said the building had been cleared by 1600 GMT, but he had no word on the fate of the rebels.

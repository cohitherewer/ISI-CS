 Bush not haunted by ?ghosts?

 Washington, Jan. 29 (AFP): President George W. Bush jokes in an interview to be broadcast tomorrow that there is a simple explanation for why he does not see the ghosts of past Presidents: ?I quit drinking in (1986).?

 Bush also told C-Span public affairs television that he and his father, former President George Bush, like to chat by telephone but don?t talk much about decisions facing the current White House occupant.

 ?It may come as a surprise to you,? he said. ?I like to check in with him, he likes to ask about this trip where you saw so and so, or (ask) how would that go, particularly when I have been overseas.

 ?But we really haven?t gotten to the stage yet where we are sharing common experiences in the White House,? the younger Bush said in the interview.

 Asked whether, as he embarked on his second four-year term, he saw ghosts of past Presidents, the President quipped: ?Well, I quit drinking in ?86.? 

 Bush said he ?tried to empathise, at times,? with Abraham Lincoln, whom he dubbed ?the countrys greatest president? for steering US through its bloody 1861-1865 civil war.

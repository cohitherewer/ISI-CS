 CIAs covert prison system

 Washington, Nov. 2: The CIA has been hiding and interrogating some of its most important al Qaida captives at a Soviet-era compound in eastern Europe, according to US and foreign officials familiar with the arrangement.

 The secret facility is part of a covert prison system set up by the CIA nearly four years ago that at various times has included sites in eight countries, including Thailand, Afghanistan and several democracies in eastern Europe, as well as a small centre at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, according to current and former intelligence officials and diplomats from three continents.

 The hidden global internment network is a central element in the CIAs unconventional war on terrorism. 

 It depends on the cooperation of foreign intelligence services, and on keeping even basic information about the system secret from the public, foreign officials and nearly all members of Congress charged with overseeing the CIAs covert actions.

 The existence and locations of the facilities ? referred to as black sites in classified White House, CIA, justice department and congressional documents ? are known to only a handful of officials in the US and, usually, only to the President and a few top intelligence officers in each host country.

 The CIA and the White House, citing national security concerns and the value of the programme, have dissuaded Congress from demanding that the agency answer questions in open testimony about the conditions under which captives are held. 

 Virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the facilities, what interrogation methods are employed with them, or how decisions are made about whether they should be detained or for how long.

 While the defence department has produced volumes of public reports and testimony about its detention practices and rules after the abuse scandals at Iraqs Abu Ghraib prison and at Guantanamo Bay, the CIA has not even acknowledged the existence of its black sites.

 To do so, say officials familiar with the programme, could open the US government to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home.

 But the revelations of widespread prisoner abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq by the US military ? which operates under published rules and transparent oversight of Congress ? have increased concern among lawmakers, foreign governments and human rights groups about the opaque CIA system. 

 Those concerns escalated last month, when vice-president Cheney and CIA director Porter J. Goss asked Congress to exempt CIA employees from legislation already endorsed by 90 senators that would bar cruel and degrading treatment of any prisoner in US custody.

 Although the CIA will not acknowledge details of its system, intelligence officials defend the agencys approach, arguing that the successful defence of the country requires that the agency be empowered to hold and interrogate suspected terrorists for as long as necessary and without restrictions imposed by the US legal system or even by the military tribunals.

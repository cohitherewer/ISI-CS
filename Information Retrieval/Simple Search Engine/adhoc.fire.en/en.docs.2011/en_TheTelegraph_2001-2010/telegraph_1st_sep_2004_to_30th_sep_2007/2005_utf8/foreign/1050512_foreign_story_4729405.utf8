 Culkin roots for Jackson

 Santa Maria (California), May 11 (Reuters): Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin took the witness stand in defence of Michael Jackson today and denied the singer had ever molested him, terming such allegations absolutely ridiculous.

 Culkin, one of a series of boys named in the trial as having special friendships with Jackson, 46, said he had never witnessed any improper behaviour by Jackson with anyone else. Ive never seen him do anything improper with anybody, he said.

 The former child actor, now 24, was the first of what is expected to be a parade of celebrity witnesses planning to testify in defence of Jackson, who is accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy in February and March 2003.

 Culkin said he had formed a special bond with Jackson when he was 9 or 10 years old and became a star overnight with the release of the first Home Alone movie in 1990. Jackson, he said, understood the pressures of fame at a young age.

 Did Mr Jackson ever molest you? Jacksons lawyer, Tom Mesereau, asked Culkin. Never, the former child star replied. Did he improperly touch you? Absolutely not.

 Did he ever touch you in a sexual way?

 No.

 Asked what he thought about testimony last month from a former cook at Jacksons Neverland home who said he had seen the pop star with his hand down Culkins pants, Culkin said: I think (the allegations) are absolutely ridiculous.

 Jackson, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to imprison the family, as well as molesting the boy and plying him with alcohol in order to seduce him.

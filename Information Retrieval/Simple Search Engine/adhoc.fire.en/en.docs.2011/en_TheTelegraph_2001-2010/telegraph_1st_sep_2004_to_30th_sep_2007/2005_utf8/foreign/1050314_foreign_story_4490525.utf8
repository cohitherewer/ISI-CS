 Cry to bring back crown

 Ayutthaya, March 13: A temple raider struggling with 50 years of guilt has admitted looting priceless Thai treasures in the hope that his confession will secure the return of a gold crown from an American museum.

 Li Kasemsang, 78, has revealed that he was part of a gang that stripped 300lb of gold crowns, swords, jewellery and statues ? some dating back to the 15th century ? from one of the biggest temples in Ayutthaya, Thailand?s ancient capital.

 After the raid in 1957, only 20 per cent of the haul was recovered. The Thai authorities had no idea that an ornate gold crown, which they believe could have been stolen, was in the US until it emerged last month at an exhibition in San Francisco. 

 The Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, is now fighting to get it back, plunging the exhibition into controversy and putting the crown at the heart of the latest fine art ?custody battle?.

 The crown, which is owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was listed in a catalogue for The Kingdom of Siam exhibition as ?probably from the crypt of the main tower of Wat Ratchaburana, Ayutthaya? ? the temple emptied by Mr Li and 20 accomplices.

 The museum paid $18,700 (?9,700) for the crown at a Sotheby?s auction in 1982. It had previously been owned by a collector from Pennsylvania, who bought it from a New York antiquities dealer in 1965.

 Its whereabouts between 1957 and then are unknown. ?We take issues of provenance very seriously,? said Anne d?Harnoncourt, the director of the museum. ?We would of course be ready to explore any questions about the history of the object with the appropriate Thai officials.?

 Ayutthaya was the capital of the kingdom of Siam from 1351 until it was razed by the Burmese army 400 years later. It was also home to Li, who made a living selling amulets scavenged from the ruins.

 When officials from Thailand?s fine arts department started to pore over one of the city?s finest temples, built in 1424, the interest of Li and fellow ?collectors? was piqued. ?I was poor; I had no job,? said Li, one of only two gang members who are still alive. ?Many people did the same things as me.?

 The temple, built to commemorate a king and two princes, turned out to hold thousands of golden objects.

 With the help of a policeman guarding the site, the gang broke into the temple and spent three nights digging through the brickwork until they reached a chamber hidden 30 feet underground. The contents surpassed their wildest dreams.

Davos (Switzerland), Jan. 29 (Reuters): Sharon 

Stone raised $1 million in five minutes from business tycoons at the Davos World 

Economic Forum yesterday to fund bed nets to protect African children from malaria-carrying 

mosquitoes.

 Responding to an appeal from Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa for immediate help, the movie star jumped up from the audience at a session on debt relief and challenged the assembled political and business leaders to pledge donations.

 ?I was particularly moved by President Mkapa and by his urgent need of today, so if you don?t mind I?d like to offer my help and support to you, and I?d like to offer you $10,000 to help you buy some bed nets today.

 ?Would any one else like to be on a team with me and stand up and offer some money and help him as well?? the star of sultry thrillers such as Basic Instinct asked. ?President Mkapa needs help today because people are dying in his country today and that?s not OK with me today.?

 A man next to her rose and pledged $50,000, prompting a stream of participants to stand and offer donations amid rising applause. Volunteers took the names of the donors. ?Sharon, you got $1 million already,? US Senator Bill Frist announced at the end.

 However, Angelina Jolie today said that celebrities grandstanding as advocates of the poor can do more harm than good.

 ?I think you can do damage,? Jolie said. ?Celebrities have a responsibility to know absolutely what they?re talking about, and to be in it for the long run,? said Jolie, 29, who has has spent four years as goodwill ambassador to the UN?s refugee agency.

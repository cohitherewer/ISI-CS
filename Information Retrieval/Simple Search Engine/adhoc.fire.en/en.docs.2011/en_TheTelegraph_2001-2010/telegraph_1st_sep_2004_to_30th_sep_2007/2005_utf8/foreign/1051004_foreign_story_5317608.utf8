 11 killed in Seoul concert

 Seoul, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Thousands of people stampeded at a public-holiday music concert in South Korea today, killing 11 and injuring more than 50 others, news reports said.

 More than 5,000 surged to enter one of the gates at a stadium in the southern city of Sangju, and those waiting at the front fell and were crushed, the organiser of the concert, the broadcaster MBC, said in a news report.

 All 11 killed were elderly women or children, reports said.

 Lonely lion

 Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Police seized a lion in poor health from a private home in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after scared neighbours squawked about the beasts roar, police said today.

 Inspector Ione Rodrigues said the owners of the 15-year-old retired circus lion called Baby did not have a licence for the animal and would face criminal charges for ill-treatment.

 The lion was kept in a small cage in the covered backyard of the house. It was very skinny and presented signs of atrophy, she said.

 Boar battle

 Seoul (Reuters): This wild piggy went 

 to an upmarket hotel. This wild piggy went to an historic 

 palace. And all the wild piggies were chased by South Korean 

 police. Police in the capital have been battling an invasion 

 of wild boars that have come down from the mountains into 

 densely populated areas in and around Seoul foraging for 

 food before the onset of winter. On Friday, one turned up 

 at an apartment complex in Kuri, east of Seoul.

 Anti-graft body arrests Nepal ex-minister

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, April 21: Former minister Prakash Man Singh, who was the first politician to defy the King Gyanendra government, was arrested today for refusing to appear before the Royal Commission for Corruption Control (RCCC).

 According to his family members, the Nepali Congress (Democratic) leader was picked up from his residence in Chhetrapati, Kathmandu. Man Singh, who is the son of late pro-democracy leader Ganesh Man Singh, was minister for physical planning and works in the Sher Bahadur Deuba government which was dismissed by Gyanendra on February 1.

 The family members said the plainclothed security personnel were led by RCCC officials. The group forcefully escorted Man Singh out of his house after he refused to accept an arrest warrant that the officials produced. 

 Man Singh was summoned by the RCCC last Monday for questioning over the construction of the multi-billion rupee Melamchi Drinking Water Project.

 However, Man Singh refused the summons and questioned the anti corruption body?s constitutional status. The RCCC was set-up by the king after he assumed power to check corruption. The body had reviewed several decisions made by the Deuba government.

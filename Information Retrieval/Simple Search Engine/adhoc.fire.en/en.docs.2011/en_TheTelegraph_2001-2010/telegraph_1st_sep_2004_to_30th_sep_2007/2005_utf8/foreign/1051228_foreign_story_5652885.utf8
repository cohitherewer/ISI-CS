 Munich mastermind unmoved by movie

 Gaza, Dec. 27 (Reuters): The Palestinian mastermind of the Munich Olympics attack in which 11 Israeli athletes died said on Tuesday he had no regrets and that Steven Spielbergs new film about the incident would not deliver reconciliation.

 Spielberg has called Munich, which dramatises the 1972 raid and Israels reprisals against members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), his prayer for peace.

 Mohammed Daoud planned the Munich attack on behalf of PLO splinter group Black September, but did not take part and does not feature in the film.

 He voiced outrage at not being consulted for the thriller and accused Spielberg of pandering to the Jewish state.

 If he really wanted to make it a prayer for peace he should have listened to both sides of the story and reflected reality, rather than serving the Zionist side alone, Daoud said from Damascus in Syria.

 Daoud said he had not seen the film, which will only reach most screens outside the US next month.

 But he noted that Spielberg arranged previews in Israel, where some have accused Munich of lacking historical accuracy.

 Several Israeli historians have also complained about what they see as a moral symmetry in the film between slain Olympians and the Palestinians assassinated by the Mossad spy service.

 Spielberg showed the movie to widows of the Israeli victims, but he neglected the families of Palestinian victims, said Daoud. How many Palestinian civilians were killed before and after Munich?

 The Munich attack was one of the pivotal moments of modern terrorism the Los Angeles Times said last week.

 Daoud used different terms.

 We did not target Israeli civilians, he said.

 Some of them (the athletes) had taken part in wars and killed many Palestinians. Whether a pianist or an athlete, any Israeli is a soldier.

 Though Mossad veterans say the reprisals are over, Daoud, who survived a 1981 shooting in Poland, said he feels he could still be targeted.

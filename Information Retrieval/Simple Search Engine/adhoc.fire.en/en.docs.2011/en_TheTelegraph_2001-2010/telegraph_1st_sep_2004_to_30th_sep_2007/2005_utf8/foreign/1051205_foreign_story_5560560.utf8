 Coffee, tea good for liver

 Washington, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Coffee and tea may reduce the risk of serious liver damage in people who drink too much alcohol, are overweight or have too much iron in the blood, researchers have said.

 A study of nearly 10,000 people showed that those who had over two cups of coffee or tea a day developed chronic liver disease at half the rate of those taking less than a cup.

 The study, conducted by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and Social amp; Scientific Systems, Inc, found that coffee provided no protection to people at risk of liver disease from other causes.

 While it is too soon to encourage patients to increase their coffee and tea intake, the findings potentially offer people at high risk for developing chronic liver disease a practical way to decrease that risk, said Dr Constance Ruhl, who headed the study.

 In addition, we hope the findings will offer guidance to researchers who are studying liver disease progression.

 Writing in the American Gastroenterological Association journal Gastroenterology, Ruhl and colleagues said caffeine seemed to hold the key.

 They analysed the records of 9,849 participants in a government survey whose coffee and tea intake was evaluated and who were followed for about 19 years.

 No excuse for Crowe conduct: Wife

 Danielle Spencer 

 Sydney, June 12 (AFP): Russell Crowes wife said today there was no excuse for his telephone-throwing tantrum that left a New York hotel clerk with facial cuts last week.

 The 41-year old Crowe has blamed his frustration at missing wife Danielle Spencer and a malfunctioning telephone for the bust up.

 Spencer told the Sun-Herald paper in Sydney: I understand when youre apart the loneliness kicks in and obviously the phone becomes of paramount importance. This is where its difficult, because Im not condoning his behaviour. I dont want to make excuses for him because Im certainly not.

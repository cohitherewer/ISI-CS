 Russia brakes on EU action on Iran

 Vienna, Sept. 21 (Reuters): An EU drive to haul Iran before the UN Security Council over its nuclear plans was in jeopardy today following stiff opposition from Russia, which warned against escalating the standoff with Tehran.

 The EU has circulated a draft resolution calling on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) governing board to report Irans secretive nuclear programme to the Security Council, which could impose sanctions on Tehran.

 But Russia, which as a permanent, veto-wielding member of the council could block any action, warned against antagonising Iran, which western countries suspect is developing atomic weapons under cover of a civilian nuclear energy programme.

 While Iran is cooperating with the IAEA, while it is not enriching uranium and observing a moratorium,, it would be counter-productive to report this question to the UN Security Council, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said. Russia is building a $1 billion nuclear reactor for Iran.

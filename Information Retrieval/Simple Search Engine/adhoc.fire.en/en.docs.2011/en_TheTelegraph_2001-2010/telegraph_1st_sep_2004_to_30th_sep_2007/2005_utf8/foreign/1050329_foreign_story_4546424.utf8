 Ireland relief after smoke-free year

 Dublin, March 28 (Reuters): Ireland can breathe a smoke-free sigh of relief tomorrow when it marks the first anniversary of a pioneering ban on smoking, the success of which has inspired similar moves elsewhere.

 The ban on smoking in pubs, restaurants and workplaces, introduced on March 29, 2004, had been expected to meet with widespread resistance in a country where the pub culture of a drink and a smoke were considered part of its lifeblood. 

 Instead, the sight of smokers puffing away outside pub doors has become familiar across Ireland, and the only haze wafting through bars these days comes from having one drink too many. 

 Similar laws had been introduced in cities and states like New York and California, but Ireland was the first country to introduce a nationwide ban. Malta, Norway and Italy have since followed suit. 

 ?It?s healthier,? said bartender and non-smoker Paddy Martin, pouring pints at Foley?s Bar. ?I feel better when I go home.?

 But not everyone has welcomed it. Some pub owners and drinks firms blame the ban for a drop-off in sales ? bar revenues fell 6.3 per cent in the first nine months of 2004.

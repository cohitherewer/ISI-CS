 Hunt for clue to join the dots

 London, July 10: Police are counting on forensic teams to provide the breakthrough that will enable them to find the terrorist cell responsible for the bombings.

 The scientific teams have accumulated sacks full of material as evidence, some of it so small that it is barely visible to the eye.

 A senior officer at Scotland Yard said last night: Right now we have a ton of material to investigate. There are hours of CCTV footage to go through, thousands of telephone calls and e-mails to pore over as well as the testimony of survivors.

 What we need is that first, practical clue so we can start joining up the dots.

 In Madrid, it was a partial thumbprint on a mobile telephone sim card that led police to their first suspects. In Istanbul, it was a chassis number on a truck used in a suicide bombing that helped investigators to identify the terrorist cell responsible.

 The problem for Scotland Yard detectives is that this scientific operation requires patience and time. They are piecing together the biggest forensic jigsaw puzzle that London has ever seen.

 Today, forensic teams were picking metal fragments from the bombed-out bus that were embedded in buildings a hundred yards away. They will also recover evidence from the bodies of the victims.

 From the remains, the police will be able tell for certain whether a suicide bomber was responsible, or if not it will show where the terrorist left the bomb. Im afraid you have to recover every damn thing you can, the officer said.

 The chances of someone coming forward to identify the cell is unlikely so its the evidence which is likely to lead us to these people.

 Police said that they were confident today that the terrorist who blew up the Number 30 bus died with his victims. Their effort now is to discover if there is enough DNA to identity him.

 Find one of the gang, and it leads you to the rest of the cell, the officer said. The other priority is to piece together the design and construction of the bombs.

 Experts say that those who make bombs leave their tell-tale trademarks, which is why police have asked their counterparts around Europe to send their files from the most recent atrocities.

 The officer at Scotland Yard, a veteran of the 30-year battle with IRA bombers, said: We need to know the explosive used, the type of detonator and timer, wires, tape.

 We even need to know all we can about the bags that they were carried in because we might be able to trace where they were bought and so narrow down the location of the bombers.

 A closely guarded military and scientific complex near Seven Oaks in the heart of the home counties (a group of counties that border London) and a nondescript office block in Lambeth in south London will be the twin centres in this manhunt.

 The first, Fort Halstead, is the home of the forensic explosives laboratory. Scientists there have handled material from blasts as big as the Lockerbie bombing and as small as IRA devices hidden in lunch boxes.

 The forensic laboratories in South Lambeth Road, an ugly brick-and-concrete 1970s tower block, will co-ordinate the other parts of the search, from fingerprints to DNA and fibres.

 The next step will be for the forensic teams to stage what they call a Byford Conference to figure out who should do what. The name comes from Sir Lawerence Byford, a former police chief inspector, who wrote a damning report on the failures of the police investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper case.

 His recommendation was that one scientist should be chosen to oversee a whole operation. Each of the others should run an area of expertise and all would advise the senior police investigator.

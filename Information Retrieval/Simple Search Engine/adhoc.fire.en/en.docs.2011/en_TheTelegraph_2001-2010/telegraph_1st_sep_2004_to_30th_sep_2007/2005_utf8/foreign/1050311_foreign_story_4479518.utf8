 Funeral tunes

 London, March 10 (Reuters): Robbie Williams has topped the UK funeral music chart, leaving Mozart trailing in his wake, according to a survey today.

 Williams? Angels was the record most Britons would like played at their funeral, with Mozart?s Requiem coming in at five in digital broadcaster Music Choice?s poll of top 10 British funeral songs.

 Frank Sinatra?s My Way was second, just ahead of Monty Python?s Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. The rest of Europe favoured a more soft rock approach.

 Queen?s The Show Must Go On topped the European chart, with Led Zeppelin?s Stairway to Heaven and AC/DC?s Highway to Hell in second and third place. Over 45,000 music fans from across Europe were polled, with 20,000 Britons taking part. 

 Fish help

 Seoul (Reuters): South Korea will soon 

 have its first fully licensed fish hospital with specialists 

 trained to treat trout with fin fungus and grouper with 

 gill infections. The Yosu Fisheries Clinic will open on 

 Saturday on South Korea?s southern coast, operated by a 

 husband and wife team of marine biologists who are among 

 the first to pass an exam to treat fish and shellfish.

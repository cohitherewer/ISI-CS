 Suicide bomber shatters post-Gaza calm

 Beersheba (Israel), Aug. 28 (Reuters): A Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up, critically wounding two guards at an Israeli bus station today in the first such attack since the eviction of Jewish settlers from Gaza and part of the West Bank.

 There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast in Beersheba, three days after troops killed five Palestinians in a raid on a militant hideout in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, drawing a vow of revenge from the Islamic Jihad group.

 A police spokesperson said nearly 50 people were treated at hospital, most of them for shock. The two guards, who chased the bomber, were critically hurt, the spokesperson said.

 The explosion, at the entrance to Beershebas central bus station, followed a call by President George W. Bush for Palestinians to respond to last weeks pullout from occupied Gaza by showing they will fight terrorism.

 Bush, who hopes the Gaza withdrawal will help revive a US-backed peace road map envisaging a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel, stopped short of demanding President Mahmoud Abbas dismantle militant groups.

 Abbas condemned the suicide bombing, calling it a terrorist attack in a statement issued by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. He described Israels Tulkarm raid as a provocation and urged all sides to show restraint.

 Holding its weekly meeting against the backdrop of the Beersheba attack, Prime Minister Ariel Sharons cabinet took a key step towards ending Israels 38-year-old military presence in Gaza.

 By a vote of 18-2, it approved the deployment of 750 Egyptian border police on the Egyptian side of the Gaza frontier to replace Israeli troops trying to prevent arms smuggling to Palestinian militants.

 Police said the Beersheba bomber tried to board a bus at the start of the Israeli work week but drew the drivers suspicion. 

 The driver signalled two security guards to go to him, Uri Barlev, the police chief for southern Israel, told Army Radio. These two security guards ultimately prevented an attack that could have been a lot worse.

 Minutes before the explosion, Israel Radio broadcast a pledge by Abbas to maintain indefinitely a ceasefire he declared along with Sharon in February.

 According to the agreement, the truce is continuing and its not linked to a time ... and everyone knows that, Abbas told the radio.

 Israeli Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told reporters the bombing proves again the Palestinian Authority has to do a lot more in order to stop the terrorists, and I promise you that well continue to fight against them everywhere.

 A suicide bomber last struck on July 12, killing five people outside a shopping mall in the coastal city of Netanya.

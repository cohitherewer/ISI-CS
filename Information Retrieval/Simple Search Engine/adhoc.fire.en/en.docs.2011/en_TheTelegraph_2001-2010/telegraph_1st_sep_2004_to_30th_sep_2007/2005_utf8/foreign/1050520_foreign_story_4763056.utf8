 Kylie faces tests ahead of surgery

 Sydney, May 19 (Reuters): Pop diva Kylie Minogue is undergoing medical tests in Melbourne in preparation for breast cancer surgery later this week, her management said in a statement today.

 Initial tests showed the cancer was confined to the breast.

 Minogue announced on Tuesday that she had been diagnosed with early breast cancer and postponed her Australian and Asian Showgirl Tour concerts.

 Kylie is currently undergoing tests at a first class medical facility in Melbourne in preparation for an operation this week by one of Australias leading surgeons, said the statement. Thankfully, tests so far have confirmed the earlier diagnosis that the cancer appears to be confined to the breast.

 Early breast cancer means the disease is confined to the breast, has not spread to vital organs and can be surgically removed, according to the National Breast Cancer Centre.

 Surgery would usually involve cutting out just the cancer if it is small enough, or removing the entire breast, followed by radiotherapy and possibly chemotherapy.

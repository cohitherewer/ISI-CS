 Radicals hijack UK poll meet

 London, April 19: A group of 15 men, two of them masked, burst into the Central London Mosque in Regent?s Park just as the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) was unveiling its election manifesto.

 The council, which claims to be the voice of Britain?s 1.6 million Muslims, has drawn up a list of 10 questions, covering immigration, education, religious discrimination and Iraq, which it wants voters to ask of their parliamentary candidates before making their choice.

 From the Labour Party?s point of view, the bad news is that the Muslim leadership is not asking the faithful to vote for Tony Blair. However, the good news from Blair?s point of view is that no fatwa is being issued urging Muslims ? and many of them are in key constituencies such as foreign secretary Jack Straw?s Blackburn seat ? not to support Labour.

 But Muslim politics is a dangerous business, even in Britain. For the radical fringe, even the act of voting is haram or not lawful according to Islam. In marked contrast, the council wants Muslims to vote: ?We encourage all Muslims to take an active part in all the issues of the election campaign.?

 At Regent?s Park mosque, the biggest in the country, there was a large media turnout, which was hijacked by the intruders. There were chaotic scenes as the council?s secretary general Iqbal Sacranie suspended the press conference. 

 Sacranie?s line was: ?We know there is a lot of disillusionment out there about the manner in which anti-terror measures have been applied against our community in recent years. The questions are there to help guide British Muslims towards a more informed decision concerning the main issues facing them today.?

 One of the protesters, who said he belonged to the Saviour Sect, claimed voting in the general election was ?an act of apostasy? and announced: ?We are here to condemn you and your organisation.? One of the masked men screamed: ?Kaffirs. MCB are dirty kaffirs.?

 Another man yelled: ?The MCB are a mouthpiece of the British government of Tony Blair and George Bush. They don?t represent Islam. They don?t represent British Muslims.?

 The Saviour Sect handed out a leaflet reading: ?Vote today... become Kaafir tomorrow! Voting for any political party which has a policy of legislating a law is Kufr Akbar (a major apostasy) and will take you outside the fold of Islam. It will also nullify all your good deeds and guarantee your seat in hellfire for ever.?

 After enjoying their 15 minutes of fame, surrounded by photographers and cameramen, the men left. Ten policemen outside made no attempt to stop them.

 The break-in was a major distraction for the council today issued a major document which sets out how it thinks a future government should conduct its relationship with British Muslims.

 Much of what the council had to say on issues such as curbing terrorism, education, tackling unemployment among Muslims ? half the Muslim population of Britain is British-born and under 24 ? seemed eminently sensible.

 However, the council could not resist a little dig at India for failing to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir, something which even President Musharraf hasn?t raised.

 ?International law is enforced very selectively allowing some countries (example Israel, Russia, India) to flout UN resolutions with impunity,? it said. 

 Perhaps the most important demand from the council is that in order to achieve a more equal and just society, Asians should be promoted not on the basis of their ethnicity, as has so far been the case, but their religion.

 ?For many Muslims,? the council said, ?religion ? and not ethnicity ? forms the primary basis of their primary identity.? This is a crucial shift in the battle for equality and runs the risk of importing the Hindu-Muslim divide from the subcontinent into British public life. 

 So far, most Hindus, however devout ? and many are ? do not like to be defined primarily by their religion. But there are Hindu groups waiting in the wings keen to be given equal billing with the Muslim Council of Britain.

 So far as this election is concerned, some Muslims are starting to appreciate the fact that voting against Labour and backing the Lib Dems, for example, could let in the Tories by the back door in some constituencies.

 This is probably why a group of eight Muslim scholars wrote to the Guardian today, urging Muslims to vote Labour. 

 ?We have of course all been angry at the Labour government, principally over Iraq and the anti-terror laws, but at the next election the country will be faced with a choice,? wrote the scholars. ?We encourage British Muslims that when the elections finally come to support Labour.?

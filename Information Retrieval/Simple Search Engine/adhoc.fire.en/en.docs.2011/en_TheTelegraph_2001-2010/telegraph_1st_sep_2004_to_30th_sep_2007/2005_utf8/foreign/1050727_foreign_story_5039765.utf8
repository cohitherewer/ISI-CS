 King court hands Deuba 2-year jail

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, July 26: The Royal Commission for Corruption Control today held former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and former minister Prakash Man Singh guilty of corruption in a drinking water project case and sentenced them to two years in prison.

 The powerful body, constituted by King Gyanendra in the aftermath of his February 1 coup, also directed Deuba and Singh to pay a fine of Rs 90 million each. 

 It sentenced former secretary Tika Dutta Niraula, executive director of the project Dhruba Bahadur Shrestha, deputy executive director Dipak Kumar Jha and contractor Jep Chhring Lama of Lama Constructions to a year in jail on charges of corruption.

 A three-member panel of chairman Bhakta Bahadur Koirala and members Raghu Chandra Bahadur Singh and Haribabu Chaudhary announced the verdict today.

 The commission also ordered the cancellation of the contract that was awarded to Lama Construction for building the access road to the project. 

 Deuba, Singh and the others were convicted for irregularity in the process of awarding the contract. 

 Soon after the commission announced its verdict, violent protests erupted outside its office with activists of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) going on the rampage.

 Deuba said the commission was specifically formed to malign politicians. It is all a part of the conspiracy hatched by the king to tarnish my political image, he said, adding that the verdict was politically motivated and constitutionally invalid. 

 Deuba said he would decide on his next move after consulting the seven-party alliance. I am not worried about being jailed, he asserted. 

 Prakash Man Singh said the verdict was aimed at fixing leaders who fought for democracy. We should look for a political solution. The seven-party alliance has already demanded scrapping of the Commission. 

 Singh, however, ruled out taking any legal steps. It is up to the seven-party alliance, which will take a decision after consultations, he said.

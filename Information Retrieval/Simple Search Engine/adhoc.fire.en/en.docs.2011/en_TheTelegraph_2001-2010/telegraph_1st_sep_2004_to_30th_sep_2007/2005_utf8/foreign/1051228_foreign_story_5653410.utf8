 Mobile scare

 Seoul, Dec. 27 (Reuters): South Koreans may look at their mobile phones with some trepidation in the new year because prosecutors will start telling people they have been indicted via text messages.

 a country where about 75 per cent of the population carries mobile phones, prosecutors felt as the notices dont reach them immediately by regular mail, this is a more definite way for the individuals to know they have received a legal notice. 

 Icy bath

 Berlin (Reuters): Saying ice cold water is good for their health, about 30 naked Germans jumped together into a Berlin lake for their annual Christmas swim. Wearing nothing but red Santa Claus caps, the men and women aged between 25 and 73 went cheerfully en masse into the Oranke Lake, which had temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius. It feels great though its not as cold this year as in the past, said Kathrin Hornack after her five-minute swim.

 Marlboro Man?s home stubs out smoking

 The Marlboro Man

London, April 9: The home of ?Marlboro Man?, 

the destination of cigarette-puffing cowboys heading for ?where the flavour is?, 

is banning smoking almost everywhere except in the great outdoors itself.

 Legislators in Montana, known as Big Sky Country, voted this week to outlaw smoking in all enclosed public spaces, including bars and restaurants.

 They agreed on the health risks of inhaling second-hand smoke but argued over whether a ban was in the spirit of Montana?s love of freedom and individualism, as embodied by the cowboys in the Marlboro advertisements.

 ?Smoking is just plain stupid,? Joe Balyeat, a Republican state senator, said.

 ?But if this legislature decided to outlaw stupidity, two thirds of us would be behind bars. I just don?t think we can legislate against stupidity.?

 Brooding, tattooed Marlboro Man, an advertising icon since the 1950s, was dreamed up by executives looking for the ultimate symbol of rugged masculinity.

 Marlboro cigarettes were originally pitched at women but failed to take off. Philip Morris then asked its marketing experts to turn the product into the smoking choice of macho men.

 The cowboy was chosen as the most manly candidate and the change turned Marlboro into the company?s best-selling brand, with widespread television advertising.

 Part of the campaign?s success was attributed to the fact that real cowboys starred in the adverts, many of which featured music from The Magnificent Seven film.

 The cowboys were filmed herding cattle or kicking up dust as they rode across canyons, pausing to draw on cigarettes from the brand?s new hard-surfaced red and white packet.

 Marlboro Man muscularly survived the 1971 ban on television cigarette advertising, appearing on billboards and in magazines instead.

 However, two Marlboro Men, Wayne McLaren and David McLean, died of lung cancer.

 While the Montana ban comes into force on October 1, the state?s 1,700 bars have until 2009 to comply.

 The fines range from a written warning for the first offence to a ?270 fine for a fifth.

 Arms apology

 Jerusalem, June 19 (Reuters): Israel publicly apologised to the US today over arms exports to China that have drawn criticism from Washington and strained US-Israeli security ties.

 It is impossible to hide the crisis between Israel and the United States with regard to the security industries. We are doing everything possible to put it behind us, Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom said on Israel Radio.

 The dispute centres on Israels sale of Harpy attack drones and other advanced technology to China that the Pentagon fears could tilt the balance of power and make it difficult to defend Taiwan, which Beijing deems a renegade province. 

 If things were done that were not acceptable to the Americans then we are sorry but these things were done with the utmost innocence, Shalom said.

 Unilever to reopen Nepal factory

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Sept. 1: The Maoist-affiliated trade union today withdrew their threat to Unilever Nepal paving the way for the reopening of their factory near Hetauda in Makwanpur district.

 According to company sources, the rebels faxed a letter to the factory withdrawing their demands. The factory will reopen tomorrow.

 The rebels were demanding several new welfare measures for the 250 Unilever workers and the reinstatement of some sacked employees. 

 As a result of the threat, the Unilever management announced the factorys closure two weeks ago leading to protests from the employees. Several human rights groups and the Nepalese chambers of commerce joined hands to request the Maoist leaders to leave the industries alone.

 The sources said some human rights activists urged the Maoist trade union to scale down their demands. 

 Party drops pledge

 Nepals largest political party today dropped a 60-year-old written pledge to uphold constitutional monarchy. The Nepali Congress party said a party convention had approved a resolution deleting the reference to constitutional monarchy from its constitution.
